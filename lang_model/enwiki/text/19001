'''Stanis<U+0142>aw Koniecpolski''' (1590/1594{{Ref_label|a|a|none}} &ndash; 11 March 1646) was a Polish [[nobleman]] ([[szlachta|szlachcic]]), [[magnate]], [[official]] ([[starost]] and [[castellan]]), [[voivode]] of [[Sandomierz]] from 1625, and Field and later Grand Crown [[hetman]] ([[commander-in-chief|second highest military commander]], after the king) of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Stanis<U+0142>aw Koniecpolski lived a life that involved almost constant warfare, and during his military career he won many victories. Before he reached the age of 20, he had fought in the [[Dymitriads]] and the [[Moldavian Magnate Wars]], where he was taken captive by the forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] at the [[Battle of Cecora]] in 1620. After his release in 1623 he defeated Ottoman [[vassal]]s the [[Tatar]]s in 1624. With inferior forces fought the [[Sweden|Swedish]] forces of [[Gustavus Adolphus]] to a stalemate in [[Prussia]]. Koniecpolski tried several more times, July 15 and Aug 9, but was repelled by the Swedes, during the second phase of the [[Polish-Swedish War]] (1626<U+2013>1629), which ended with the [[Truce of Altmark]]. Koniecpolski defeated a major Turkish invasion at [[Kamianets-Podilskyi|Kamieniec Podolski]] (Kamianets-Podilskyi) in [[Ukraine]] in 1634, and during his life led many other successful campaigns against the rebellious [[Cossacks]] and invading Tatars. He is considered to be one of the most skilled and famous military commanders in the history of [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]].<ref name=dict/><ref name=WIEM/>

==Childhood==
Stanis<U+0142>aw Koniecpolski was born between 1590 and 1594{{Ref_label|a|a|none}} into the szlachta and magnate family of [[Koniecpolscy]], likely in their seat of [[Koniecpol]]. His father was [[Aleksander Koniecpolski (1555-1609)|Aleksander Koniecpolski]], a wealthy [[magnate]], voivode ([[Count palatine|palatine]]) of [[Sieradz]], a staunch supporter of [[monarch|king]] [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]] of the Swedish [[House of Vasa]].<ref name=WIEM>{{pl icon}} [http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/21838,,,,koniecpolski_stanislaw,haslo.html Koniecpolski Stanis<U+0142>aw], [[WIEM Encyklopedia]], retrieved on 16 July 2009</ref> His mother was Anna Sroczycka, daughter of [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Sroczycki]], voivode of [[Kamianets-Podilskyi|Kamieniec Podolski]], who brought into the Koniecpolscy family large [[Estate (house)|estate]]s in [[Podolia]]. Stanis<U+0142>aw's brothers were [[Krzysztof Koniecpolski]] (''chor<U+0105><U+017C>y koronny'', voivode of [[Be<U+0142>sk]] from 1641), [[Remigiusz Koniecpolski]] ([[bishop of Che<U+0142>m]], died in 1640), [[Jan Koniecpolski]] (castellan and voivode of Sieradz) and Przedbor Koniecpolski (died in 1611).<ref name="Podhorodecki14-15">Podhorodecki, p. 14-15</ref>

[[Image:Rzeczpospolita.png|thumb|left|The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] at its greatest extent, 1648]]

Stanis<U+0142>aw Koniecpolski had a speech impediment, and throughout his life he [[stutter]]ed on longer words.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} When he was 15, his father's influence at the [[royal court]] got him the [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth district office]] of [[starosta]] (mayor) of [[Wielu<U+0144>]]. Around that time (1603) he studied at the [[Jagiellonian University|Cracow Academy]] in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]].<ref name=dict/><ref name="Podhorodecki22-23">Podhorodecki, p. 22-23</ref> After several years of studies, he was sent by his father to the royal court, to continue his education in a more practical fashion; he stayed there for a year or two.<ref name="Podhorodecki28">Podhorodecki, p. 28</ref> He also might have undertaken, over a period of several months, a tour of [[Western Europe]] (mostly France).<ref name="Podhorodecki28"/> Afterward, Koniecpolski returned to his family's estates.<ref name="Podhorodecki28"/>

==Early career==
[[Image:Husaria pod Kluszynem.jpg|thumb|Polish elite heavy cavalry, the [[hussar]]s, at [[Battle of K<U+0142>uszyn|K<U+0142>uszyn]]]]

Koniecpolski chose to follow a military career, and in 1610 he took part in the [[Dymitriads]] against [[Muscovy]].<ref name=dict/>  He participated in the [[battle of K<U+0142>uszyn]]. During the [[Siege of Smolensk (1609<U+2013>11)|siege of the Smolensk fortress]] on 8 July 1611, the collapsing walls killed his brother, Przedbor, and Stanislaw returned to Koniecpol with his body.<ref name="Podhorodecki33-34">Podhorodecki, p. 33-34</ref> In the autumn of the same year he rejoined the army and under the command of Grand Lithuanian [[Hetman]] [[Jan Karol Chodkiewicz]] took part in the effort to relieve and bring supplies to the [[siege|besieged]] Polish forces in the [[Moscow Kremlin]].<ref name="Podhorodecki35">Podhorodecki, p. 35</ref> During that time, he was entrusted by the hetman with the important command of the right [[flank]] of the Polish forces.<ref name="Podhorodecki35"/>

In 1612, Koniecpolski joined the units of ''[[wojsko kwarciane]]'' (regular Commonwealth army) in Ukraine under the command of hetman [[Stanis<U+0142>aw <U+017B><U+00F3><U+0142>kiewski]],<ref name="Podhorodecki35"/> who greatly influenced his career.<ref name="Podhorodecki36">Podhorodecki, p. 36</ref> In 1614, he was given the responsibility of destroying rebellious units of ''wojsko kwarciane'', who were led by [[Jan Karwacki]].<ref name="JB">Jerzy Besala, ''Stanis<U+0142>aw <U+017B><U+00F3><U+0142>kiewski'', PIW, 1988</ref><ref name="Podhorodecki42-43">Podhorodecki, p. 42-43</ref> On May 17, together with [[Jan <U+017B><U+00F3><U+0142>kiewski]], he won a [[battle of Rohatyn|victory at Rohatyn]] and captured Krawacki.<ref name="Podhorodecki42-43"/> In 1615, he married the daughter of <U+017B><U+00F3><U+0142>kiewski, [[Katarzyna <U+017B><U+00F3><U+0142>kiewska|Katarzyna]].<ref name="Podhorodecki42-43"/> Soon after the marriage, he received an official rank of [[podstoli koronny]].<ref name name="Podhorodecki44">Podhorodecki, p. 44</ref>

In 1615 and 1616, Koniecpolski gained experience in Ukraine fighting against Tatar [[horde]]s, but he failed to break or capture any sizable enemy units.<ref name name="Podhorodecki45">Podhorodecki, p. 45</ref> In 1616, his first wife, Katarzyna, died in labor with his first son, Andrzej.<ref name name="Podhorodecki46-47">Podhorodecki, p. 46-47</ref> In 1617, alongside <U+017B>o<U+0142>kiewski, he took part in the [[Moldavian Magnate Wars]] and stood against the powerful Turkish army of [[Iskander Pasha]]. The conflict ended in a negotiated cease-fire that year.<ref name name="Podhorodecki46-47"/> He also negotiated with Cossacks near [[Olszanica]], Russia, where the [[Registered Cossacks|Cossack register]] (list of privileged Cossacks in the Commonwealth military) was limited to 1,000 and Cossack raids on the [[Black Sea]] were forbidden.<ref name name="Podhorodecki48-49">Podhorodecki, p. 48-49</ref> Those raids, which reached and pillaged wealthy Ottoman cities, contributed to the Cossacks' income but provoked retaliation raids into the Commonwealth territory.<ref name="Podhorodecki40-41">Podhorodecki, p. 40-41</ref>

In 1618, during the session of the Commonwealth [[parliament]] ([[Sejm]]) and ignoring the opposition of magnate [[Krzysztof Zbaraski]] and his allies, king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] granted the [[bu<U+0142>awa]] ([[ceremonial mace]] or [[Baton (symbol)|baton]]) of Grand Crown Hetman to Stanis<U+0142>aw <U+017B><U+00F3><U+0142>kiewski and the baton of Field Crown Hetman to Koniecpolski.<ref name name="Podhorodecki51">Podhorodecki, p. 51</ref><ref name=dict/>

Soon afterward, Koniecpolski was defeated by the Tatars near [[Oryn]], where he made a mistake of charging in front of his army against overwhelming odds and consequently barely made it out of the battle alive.<ref name name="Podhorodecki56">Podhorodecki, p. 56</ref> Koniecpolski thereafter married [[Krystyna Lubomirska]], who in 1620 gave birth to [[Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620-1659)|Aleksander]].<ref name name="Podhorodecki58">Podhorodecki, p. 58</ref>

In 1620, Koniecpolski and <U+017B><U+00F3>lkiewski led the army to [[Cecora]] to fight against the horde of Kantymir ([[Khan Temir]]). The army numbered more than 10,000, and consisted of such regiments as the private forces of magnates Koreccy, Zas<U+0142>awscy, Kazanowscy, Kalinowscy and [[Potoccy]]. Koniecpolski commanded the right flank of the Commonwealth forces during the [[battle of Cecora]].<ref name=WIEM/> On September 19, the Polish forces were defeated but were able to retreat in an organised fashion. The [[morale]] of the army was low, and while Koniecpolski stopped the army from disintegrating on 20 and 21 September,  the army collapsed and ran towards the river during the later retreat. In the ensuing battle, <U+017B><U+00F3>lkiewski was killed and Koniecpolski and many magnates ([[Samuel Korecki]], [[Miko<U+0142>aj Stru<U+015B>]], [[Miko<U+0142>aj Potocki]], [[Jan <U+017B><U+00F3><U+0142>kiewski]], son of Stanis<U+0142>aw and [[<U+0141>ukasz <U+017B>o<U+0142>kiewski]]) were taken captive.<ref name name="Podhorodecki65-100">Podhorodecki, p. 65-100 (very detailed account of the battle)</ref> The prisoners were transported to [[Bia<U+0142>ograd]], to Iskander pasha, then near [[Constantinople]] to the [[Castle of Seven Towers]] and held in the Black Tower. They returned to Poland in spring 1623 during the aftermath of the [[Battle of Khotyn (1621)|Ottoman defeat at Khotyn]] and the stabilization of Polish-Ottoman relations that was helped by the [[diplomatic mission]] of Krzysztof Zbaraski which bought the freedom of captives for 30,000 [[talar]]s.<ref name name="Podhorodecki101-110">Podhorodecki, p. 101-110</ref><ref name=dict/> 

[[Image:Castle of Seven Towers Istanbul.png|thumb|Castle of the Seven Towers in Istanbul, where Koniecpolski was imprisoned]]

In July 1623, Koniecpolski took part in the skirmishes against Tatars near [[Tremblowla]].<ref name=WIEM/> Around February 1624, the Kantymir's forces (''horda budziacka'') attacked southern Poland. One of its armies was intercepted and destroyed on February 6 by Koniecpolski near [[Szma<U+0144>kowice]] and [[Martyn<U+00F3>w]] ([[Battle of Martyn<U+00F3>w]] around 20 June), forcing the forces of [[Ali]] pasha to retreat towards [[Bukowina]].<ref name=Jacques>Tony Jaques, "Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: A-E", Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, pg. 155, [http://books.google.com/books?id=3amnMPTPP5MC&pg=PA155&dq=Koniecpolski+Martynow&as_brr=3]</ref><ref name=interia/> Kantymir's forces crossed the border on June 5 and hetman Koniecpolski crushed them on June 20. Koniecpolski used a new strategy - light Cossack [[cavalry]] that was as fast as the Tatars' had driven the enemy towards fortified positions called the [[Tabor (formation)|tabor]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} For his victory, the Sejm awarded him 30,000 [[zloty]]s and made him voivode of Sandomierz in 1625.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In 1625, the [[Zaporizhzhia (region)|Zaporozhian]] Cossacks rebelled, allied with [[Szanhin Girej]], and tried to form an alliance with Muscovy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Koniecpolski reasoned that the Tatars had their share of trouble with [[Porta]] and that the budziacka horda of Kantymir would not be able to send major assistance. He gathered a 12,000-strong army of wojsko kwarciane and private units. He promised all Cossacks loyal to the Commonwealth fair treatment, and death to the rebels remaining under [[Marko Zhmailo|Mark <U+017B>maj<U+0142>a]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} On October 25, 1625 near Kryk<U+00F3>w, he attacked the Cossacks, who managed to stop the first attacks of cavalry and retreated towards Lake Kurukowski. They managed again to stop the second assault and Koniecpolski was "in grave danger at one moment". The conflict ended with a cease-fire, the [[Treaty of Kurukove]]; the Cossack register was set at 6,000; and again they promised to stop raiding the Black Sea and provoking the Tatars.<ref>Brian L. Davies, "Warfare, state and society on the Black Sea steppe, 1500-1700", Routledge, 2007, pg. 100, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XH4hghHo1qoC&pg=PA100&dq=Kurukove+Tatars&lr=&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=Kurukove%20Tatars&f=false]</ref>

In 1626, the Tatars invaded again, razing and pillaging territories as far as the [[voivodeship]]s of [[Belz]], [[Halych]] and [[Lviv]], while some advance units reached the cities of [[Ternopil]] and Tremblowla. Koniecpolski intercepted them near [[Bila Tserkva]].<ref name=interia/> A small army of wojsko kwarciane under Koniecpolski managed to defeat the rear guard of the main Tatar army, which crossed the borders with many treasures and [[slavery|slave]]s in [[jasyr]]. Later that year, fearing a repeat of the invasion, Koniecpolski violated a Sejm declaration and recruited and fielded an army of 8,000 against the expected Tatar second wave.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In 1626, the Tatars did not invade again, but the Swedes crossed the Commonwealth borders instead, rekindling the [[Polish-Swedish War]].<ref name=Bain>R. Nisbet Bain, "Slavonic Europe - A Political History of Poland from 1447 to 1796", READ BOOKS, 2006, pg. 155, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PdZBZcUbSewC&pg=PA155&dq=Polish+Swedish+war+1626+Koniecpolski&lr=&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=&f=false]</ref> In May 1626, Gustavus Adolphus landed in [[Baltiysk|Pi<U+0142>awa]]<ref>Norman Davies, "God's playground", Oxford University Press, 2005, pg. 238</ref> with more than 8,000 soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Near the village of Gniew in a battle (22<U+2013>30 September 1626) Gustav defeated a Polish army led by King Sigismund. Sigismund retreated and called from reinforcements from other parts of the country. Koniecpolski was tasked with defending [[Prusy Kr<U+00F3>lewskie]] (Royal Prussia) from the Swedish incursion.<ref name=dict/><ref name=WIEM/> 

Koniecpolski's force of 4,200 light cavalry, 1,000 [[dragoon]]s, and 1,000 infantry quickly moved to Prussia. Strengthened by other units, he had 9,000 men against the 20,000-strong Swedish force.<ref name=Bain/> Using the tactic of [[maneuver warfare]], with small mobile units striking at the enemy's communication lines and smaller units, he managed to stop the Swedish attack and force the units under [[Axel Oxenstierna]] into a defense.<ref name=Scott>Franklin D. Scott, "Sweden", SIU Press, 1992, pg. 172, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Qv8zxie3A18C&pg=PA172&dq=Oxenstierna+Koniecpolski&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=Oxenstierna%20Koniecpolski&f=false]</ref>

The Sejm agreed to raise money for the war, but the situation of the Polish forces was difficult.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Lithuanian forces were dealt a serious defeat in December 1626 near Koknese in [[Inflanty Voivodeship]] and retreated behind the [[Western Dvina|Dvina]] river. The Swedes planned to strike Koniecpolski from two directions - Oxenstierna from direction of the [[Vistula]] and [[Johann Streiff von Lawentstein]] and [[Maxymilian Teuffl]] from Swedish held [[Pomorze]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The flooding of the Vistula disrupted their plans and allowed Koniecpolski to intercept the enemy units coming from Pomorze. In March/April (dates vary, 12 March being most common) of 1627, near Czarne (Hamersztyn), the Poles forced the Swedish forces to retreat inside the city, and three days later to surrender, leaving behind their banners and insignia.<ref name=dict/><ref name=WIEM/> Some Swedish soldiers and mercenaries changed sides at that time. This victory also convinced the [[Prince-elector|Elector]] of [[Brandenburg]] to declare his support for the Commonwealth, and the Lithuanian forces resumed the offensive in Inflanty.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[Image:Koniecpolski small2.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of hetman Stanis<U+0142>aw Koniecpolski]]

On April 2, 1627, Koniecpolski managed to recapture [[Puck, Poland|Puck]].<ref name=dict/><ref name=interia>{{pl icon}} [http://encyklopedia.interia.pl/haslo?hid=79491 Koniecpolski Stanis<U+0142>aw], [[Encyklopedia Internautica]], retrieved on 16 July 2009</ref><ref name=CHP>THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF POLAND, CUP Archive, pg. 473, [http://books.google.com/books?id=N883AAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA473&dq=Puck+Koniecpolski&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=Puck%20Koniecpolski&f=false]</ref> During the crossing of the Vistula near [[Kie<U+017C>mark]], in the vicinity of [[Gda<U+0144>sk|Danzig]], Gustav met the Polish forces but was wounded in the [[hip]] and forced to retreat. In July, he led forces to lift the siege of [[Braniew]], and lay siege to [[Orneta]]. Koniecpolski responded with the sudden attack and capture of [[Gniew]].<ref name=dict/> Gustavus was reported to be impressed by the speed of Koniecpolski's reaction. 

With about 7,800 men (including 2,500 cavalry and [[hussar]]s, Commonwealth elite heavy cavalry), Koniecpolski tried to stop the Swedish army from reaching Danzig, near [[Tczew]]. On 7<U+2013>8 August, a battle with the Swedish forces (10,000 men including 5,000 infantry) took place near the [[swamp]]s of [[Mo<U+0142>tawa]]. The Swedes wanted to provoke the Poles into an attack then destroy them with infantry fire and [[artillery]], but Koniecpolski decided not to attack. The Swedes then took the initiative and attacked with cavalry, but did not manage to draw the Poles within the range of their fire. The consequent Swedish attacks dealt severe damage to Polish cavalry units, but did not manage to cripple the army (whose morale was kept high, thanks to Koniecpolski).<ref>Podhorecki, pg. 88</ref> The battle ended when Gustavus Adolphus was once again wounded and the Swedes retreated.<ref name=CHP/>

After the battle, Koniecpolski saw the need to reform the army and strengthen the [[Fire power|firepower]] of infantry and artillery to match the Swedish units.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The Swedes, on the other hand, learned arts of cavalry attacks, charges and melee combat from the Poles. Koniecpolski's tactics led to the defeat of a Swedish [[flotilla]] by the small [[Polish Navy]] on 28 November 1627 at the [[battle of Oliwa]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In 1628, the Polish forces, lacking funding, were forced to stop their offensive and switch to defense. Gustavus Adolphus captured [[Nowy]] and [[Brodnica]]. Koniecpolski counterattacked by using his small forces most efficiently - fast cavalry melee attacks combined with the supporting fire of infantry and artillery, and using fortifications and [[terrain advantage]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The Sejm decided to increase the funds for the war after the battle of [[G<U+00F3>rzno]], where [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Potocki]] was defeated. [[Austria]] sent help to the Commonwealth in the form of units under [[field marshall]] [[Jan Jerzy Arnheim]]. Nonetheless, Koniecpolski was forced to withdraw Commonwealth forces from many strategic Polish strongholds in Prussia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The final battle took place on 27 June 1629 near [[Battle of Trzciana|Trzciana]] (or Trzcianka).<ref name=dict/><ref name=WIEM/> The Swedes attacked in the direction of [[Grudzi<U+0105>dz]], were stopped, and retreated to [[Szturm]] and [[Malbork]].

This counterattack was also stopped, and the Swedish forces were saved by the last reserve units led by field marshal [[Herman Wrangel]], who managed to stop the Polish attack. Gustavus Adolphus was wounded and barely managed to escape with his freedom.<ref name=dict/> 1,200 Swedes were killed, Jan Wilhelm Reingraff,{{Who|date=August 2009}} and a few hundred were captured.

In 1633, Koniecpolski thwarted the Turks' attacks on the Commonwealth, defeating their forces on July 4 at [[Sasowy R<U+00F3>g]].<ref name=WIEM/><ref name=interia/> On October 22 of that year, he resisted and repulsed a larger Ottoman invasion force of over 20,000 at [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]].

Koniecpolski understood the need to modernize the army and actively cooperated with W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV on various projects leading to this goal, like drafting mercenary units experienced in the western art of war, and further development of artillery (he supervised the construction of [[arsenal]]s in [[Kodak Fortress|Kudak]], [[Bar, Ukraine|Bar]] and Kamieniec Podolski, and built [[forge]]s on his Ukrainian estates). He was the patron of many talented artillery and engineering officers. It is possible that he also sponsored [[cartographer]]s like William le Vasseur de Beauplan,<ref name=Stone /> who created a map of Ukraine, and [[Sebastian Aders]], who created a map of the [[Crimea]].<ref>Polish Museum in [[Rapperswil]], "Works by William le Vasseur de Beauplan", [http://www.muzeum-polskie.org/muzeum/beauplan-eng.htm]</ref>  He also supported the plan to create the [[Navy of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth Baltic Fleet]].<ref name=Stone>Daniel Stone, "The Polish-Lithuanian state, 1386-1795", University of Washington Press, 2001, pgs. 152, 158, 195, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA151&dq=Koniecpolski+Baltic+Fleet&lr=&as_brr=3], [http://books.google.com/books?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA195&dq=Koniecpolski+Podhorce&lr=&as_brr=3], [http://books.google.com/books?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA158&dq=Koniecpolski+Tatars&lr=&as_brr=3]</ref>

Koniecpolski became the ''de facto'' unofficial ruler of Ukraine as king W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw trusted him with most political decisions about this southeastern region of the Commonwealth.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Some foreigners referred to him as the 'viceking of Ukraine', although such a position never existed in the Commonwealth.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} With the knowledge and support of the king, Koniecpolski sent and received diplomatic missions from [[Istanbul]], carried out negotiations and signed out treaties, and as a hetman, had a direct control over a significant part of Commonwealth military. He had his own espionage network stretching from Muscovy to the Ottoman Empire.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==The magnate==
[[Image:Caspod1.gif|thumb|[[Pidhirtsi Castle]], was constructed by Wilhelm Beauplan between 1635-1640 and sponsored by hetman Koniecpolski]]

Over the course of his life, Koniecpolski gathered much wealth. He was a possessor of 16 districts (''starostwa''), and his yearly revenue was more than 500,000 [[zloty]]s. He sponsored the construction of the [[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|Koniecpolski Palace]] in [[Warsaw]].<ref name="eguide">{{en icon}} {{cite web |author = |url = http://www.um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/perelki/index_en.php?mi_id=101&dz_id=12 |title = Presidential Palace |work = eGuide / Treasures of Warsaw on-line |publisher = |pages = |page = |date = |accessdate = 2008-07-24}}</ref> Koniecpolski invested much of his wealth into developing his Ukrainian estates.<ref name=WIEM/> He founded the town of [[Brody]], which flourished with his investments, becaming an important local commercial center; Koniecpolski fortified the town with a [[citadel]] and [[bastion]]s in 1633 and set up [[workshop]]s (a [[manufacture]]) producing [[Persian carpet|Persian]]-type [[samite]] fabrics, [[carpet]]s and rugs there.<ref name=WIEM/><ref name=Stone>Daniel Stone, "The Polish-Lithuanian state, 1386-1795", University of Washington Press, 2001, pgs. 158, 195, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA195&dq=Koniecpolski+Podhorce&lr=&as_brr=3], [http://books.google.com/books?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA158&dq=Koniecpolski+Tatars&lr=&as_brr=3]</ref> He also constructed a fortified [[palace]] in [[Pidhirtsi]] (Ukraine) with beautiful [[Italian garden]]s.<ref name=WIEM/><ref name=Stone/> More than 100,000 people lived on his estates in Western Ukraine.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Koniecpolski was regarded{{By whom|date=August 2009}} as an honorable and fair person, and liked by most of the szlachta.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} What was especially rare for a Commonwealth magnate, he was said to have almost no enemies.{{By whom|date=August 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} His main opponents in politics were those who opposed king W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw, and on Ukraine, magnate [[Jeremi Wi<U+015B>niowiecki]], who vied with Koniecpolski about the control over Ukraine region.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Last years==
After 1635 Koniecpolski's declining health made him reliant on the younger hetman [[Miko<U+0142>aj Potocki]], who successfully crushed Cossack uprisings in 1637 and 1638, and a Tatar uprising in 1639. Koniecpolski's influence also protected the outlaw [[Samuel <U+0141>aszcz]]<ref>Orest Subtelny, "Ukraine: a history", University of Toronto Press, 2000, pg. 108, [http://books.google.com/books?id=HNIs9O3EmtQC&pg=PA108&dq=Koniecpolski+Laszcz&lr=&as_brr=3]</ref>, another able commander.

[[Image:Miko<U+0142>aj Potocki.PNG|upright|thumb|Hetman Miko<U+0142>aj Potocki]]

One of the Koniecpolski's greatest victories was during the winter campaign against the Turks in 1644. This{{Which?|date=August 2009}} was the largest army he had commanded so far: 19,000 soldiers (60% of them were private forces of the magnates, Koniecpolski's own forces numbered 2,200).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} He dealt a crushing defeat to [[To<U+011F>ay bey]]'s (Tuhaj Bej) forces near [[Ochmat<U+00F3>w]] and pursued them.<ref name=Bain>R. Nisbet Bain, "Slavonic Europe - a Political History of Poland from 1447 to 1796", READ BOOKS, 2006, pg. 207, [http://books.google.com/books?id=PdZBZcUbSewC&pg=PA207&dq=Koniecpolski+Ochmatow&lr=&as_brr=3]</ref> Many Turks drowned near Sina Woda when the ice cover on the water collapsed. This campaign brought more fame to Koniecpolski, who had not only predicted the place and time of the Turks' attack, but also destroyed their forces before they used their usual strategy of splitting the main forces into highly mobile and difficult to intercept units (''czambuls'').{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

This victory led W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV to consider waging an offensive war against the Turks. Koniecpolski supported the limited war against the [[Crimean Chanate]], but opposed W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's plan to wage the war on the entire Ottoman Empire, considering it an unrealistic folly.<ref name=Bain/> He set forth his strategic concept in a plan he titled "Dyskurs o Zniesieniu Tatarow Krymskich" (''A Discourse on the Destruction of the Crimean Tartars''). Koniecpolski also strongly advised that a coalition with Moscow would be useful for this campaign.<ref>Stanis<U+0142>aw Przy<U+0142><U+0119>cki, Zygmunt Stefan Koniecpolski, "Pami<U+0119>tniki o Koniecpolskich: przyczynek do dziej<U+00F3>w polskich XVII. wieku" (Memoirs about the Koniecpolskis), Nak<U+0142>.

King W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw continued to push for a crusade against Turkey, but the push had little internal support and failed to achieve anything except to spread false hope among the Cossacks, to whom he promised privileges and money for participation in that crusade.<ref>Daniel Stone, "The Polish-Lithuanian state, 1386-1795", University of Washington Press, 2001, pg. 158, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA158&dq=Koniecpolski+Tatars&lr=&as_brr=3]</ref> Koniecpolski foresaw danger in the discontent of the Cossacks and advocated a policy designed to accommodate their demands. This was met with little support or success.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

After Koniecpolski's wife Krystyna died, Koniecpolski soon married the 16-year-old Zofia Opali<U+0144>ska,<ref name=Bogucka>Maria Bogucka, "Women in early modern Polish society, against the European background", Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, pg. 6, [http://books.google.com/books?id=9n_bfZthkvEC&pg=PA6&dq=Koniecpolski+married&as_brr=3]</ref> daughter of future Crown Marshal [[<U+0141>ukasz Opali<U+0144>ski (1612-1666)|<U+0141>ukasz Opali<U+0144>ski]] on 16 January, 1646. Koniecpolski died on 11 March, 1646 in Brody. Many sources point to his new marriage as the source of his death.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} [[Joachim Jerlicz]] wrote in his diary that he overdosed on an [[aphrodisiac]].<ref name=Bogucka/>

==Notes==
'''a.''' {{Note_label|a|a|none}} The year of Koniecpolski's birth is not certain since there are several conflicting sources. [[Leszek Podhorodecki]], in his biography ''Stanis<U+0142>aw Koniecpolski ok. 1592<U+2013>1646'', chose the date 1592, which is likely the "average" of other sources (1590 being the earliest, 1594 the latest given by various sources).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} As he notes, the date 1591 is the most common ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046002/Stanislaw-Koniecpolski used] for example by [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]], 7 August 2007), and the date 1593 or 1594 was proposed in [[Polski S<U+0142>ownik Biograficzny]] by historian  [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Czapli<U+0144>ski]], whom Podhorodecki calls 'a great specialist of that era', noting however that Czapli<U+0144>ski fails to justify this date.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
