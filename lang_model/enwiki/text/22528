'''Stanislaw Marcin Ulam''' ({{lang-pl|Stanis<U+0142>aw Marcin Ulam}}, pronounced {{IPAc-pl|'s|t|a|<U+0144>|i|s|<U+0142>|a|f|-|'m|a|r|<U+0107>|i|n|-|'u|l|a|m}}) (13&nbsp;April 1909&nbsp;<U+2013> 13&nbsp;May 1984), was a renowned [[Polish-American]] [[mathematician]]. He participated in  America's [[Manhattan Project]], originated the [[Teller<U+2013>Ulam design]] of [[thermonuclear weapons]], invented  the [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo method of computation]], and suggested [[nuclear pulse propulsion]].  In pure and applied mathematics, he produced many results, proved many theorems, and proposed several conjectures.

==Poland==
Ulam was born in [[Lviv#Habsburg Empire|Lemberg]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], on 13 April 1909.  At this time, Galicia was in the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], but in 1918, it became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]], and the city took its Polish name, [[Lviv#Second Polish Republic|Lw<U+00F3>w]].<ref name="ULAM 9-15"/>

The Ulams were a wealthy [[Polish Jewish]] family of bankers, industrialists, and other professionals.  Ulam's immediate family was "well-to-do but hardly rich".<ref name='AULAM'/>  His father, J<U+00F3>zef Ulam, was born in Lw<U+00F3>w and was a lawyer, and his mother, Anna (Auerbach), was born in [[Stryi|Stryj]].<ref name='FAMILY'/>  His uncle, Michael Ulam, was an architect, building contractor, and lumber industrialist.<ref name='MIKE'/>  He also served on the Polish National Wood Industry Council and on the board of the Central Bank of Lw<U+00F3>w.<ref name='AULAM'/>  From 1916 until 1918, J<U+00F3>zef's family lived temporarily in [[Vienna]].<ref name='VITA'/>  After they returned, Lw<U+00F3>w became the epicenter of the [[Polish<U+2013>Ukrainian War]], during which the city experienced a Ukrainian siege.<ref name="ULAM 9-15"/>

In 1919, Ulam entered Lw<U+00F3>w Gymnasium Nr. VII, from which he graduated in 1927.<ref name='AJMAA'/>  Soon, he began studies of mathematics at the [[Lviv Polytechnic|Lw<U+00F3>w Polytechnic Institute]].  Here, under the supervision of [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], he received his M. A. degree in 1932 and his D.Sc. in 1933.<ref name='VITA'/>  From 1931 until 1935, he traveled to and studied in [[Vilnius|Wilno]], [[Vienna]], [[Zurich]], [[Paris]], and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge, England]], where he met [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]].<ref name="ULAM 56-60"/>

[[File:Lwow - Kawiarnia Szkocka.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Picture of the building that used to house the Scottish Caf<U+00E9>|The [[Scottish Caf<U+00E9>]]'s building now houses the Universal Bank in [[Lviv]].]]
Along with [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Mazur]], [[Mark Kac]],  [[W<U+0142>odzimierz Sto<U+017C>ek]], Kuratowski, and others, Ulam was a member of the  [[Lw<U+00F3>w School of Mathematics]].  Its founders were [[Hugo Steinhaus]] and [[Stefan Banach]], who were professors at the [[Lviv University|University of Lw<U+00F3>w]].  Mathematicians of this "school" met for long hours at the [[Scottish Caf<U+00E9>]], where the problems they discussed were collected in the famous [[Scottish Book]], which is a thick notebook provided by Banach's wife.  Ulam is a major presence in the Scottish Book.  Of the 193 problems recorded between 1935 and 1941, he contributed 40 problems as a single author, another 11 with Banach and Mazur, and an additional 15 with others.  In 1957, he received from Steinhaus a copy of the book, which had survived the war, and translated it into English.<ref name='BOOK'/>  In 1981, Ulam's friend Daniel Maudlin published an expanded and annotated version.<ref name='MAUDLIN'/>

==Coming to America==
In 1935, [[John von Neumann]], whom Ulam had met in Warsaw, invited him to come to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton, NJ]], for a few months.  In December of that year, Ulam sailed to America.  At Princeton, he went to lectures and seminars, where he heard [[Oswald Veblen]], [[James Waddell Alexander II|James Alexander]], and [[Albert Einstein]].  During a tea party at von Neumann's house, he encountered [[G. D. Birkhoff]], who suggested that he apply for a position with the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]].<ref name='VITA'/>

From 1936 to 1939, after following up on Birkhoff's suggestion, Ulam spent summers in Poland and academic years at [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, MA]].  Here, he worked with John C. Oxtoby<ref name='OXTOBY'/> to establish important results regarding [[ergodic theory]], which appeared in [[Annals of Mathematics]] in 1941.<ref name='AJMAA'/>

On 20 August 1939, in [[Gdynia]],  J<U+00F3>zef Ulam, along with his brother Szymon, put his two sons, Stanislaw and 17 year old [[Adam Ulam|Adam]], on a ship headed for America.<ref name='VITA'/>  Within two weeks, the [[Invasion_of_Poland#Phase_1:_German_invasion|Germans invaded Poland]].   Within two months, the Germans completed their [[History_of_Poland_(1939<U+2013>1945)#Treatment_of_Polish_citizens_under_German_occupation|occupation]] of western Poland, and the Soviets [[Invasion_of_Poland#Phase_2:_Soviet_invasion|invaded]] and [[History_of_Poland_(1939<U+2013>1945)#Treatment_of_Polish_citizens_under_Soviet_occupation|occupied]] eastern Poland.  Within two years, J<U+00F3>zef Ulam and the rest of his family were victims of the [[Holocaust]], [[Hugo Steinhaus#World War II|Steinhaus]] was in hiding, [[Kazimierz Kuratowski#During snd sfter the War|Kuratowski]] was lecturing at the [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground university]] in Warsaw,  [[W<U+0142>odzimierz Sto<U+017C>ek|Sto<U+017C>ek]] and his two sons had been killed in the [[Massacre of Lviv professors|massacre of Lw<U+00F3>w professors]], [[Stefan Banach#Later Life and Death|Banach]] was surviving Nazi occupation by feeding [[lice]] at [[Rudolf Weigl|Rudolf Weigl's typhus research institute]], and the last problem had been recorded in the Scottish Book.  In 1963, [[Adam Ulam]], who had become an eminent [[Kremlinology|kremlinologist]] at Harvard,<ref name='ADAM'/> received a letter from George Volsky,<ref name='VOLSKY'/> who hid in J<U+00F3>zef Ulam's house after deserting from the Polish army.  This reminiscence gave a chilling account of Lw<U+00F3>w's chaotic scenes in late 1939.<ref name='MOLLY'/>

In 1940, after being recommended by Birkhoff, Ulam became an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison.  Here, he became an [[United States|American]]  citizen in 1941.<ref name='VITA'/>  That year, he married Fran<U+00E7>oise Aron.<ref name='AJMAA'/>  She had been a French exchange student at [[Mount Holyoke College]], whom he met in Cambridge.  They had one daughter, Claire.  In Madison, Ulam met his friend and colleague C. J. Everett.<ref name="ULAM 125-130"/>

==Manhattan Project==
[[File:Stanislaw Ulam ID badge.png|thumb|right|200px|Ulam's ID badge photo from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] ]]
In early 1943, Ulam asked von Neumann to find him a war job.  In October, he received an invitation to join an unidentified project near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].<ref name='VITA'/>  The letter was signed by [[Hans Bethe]], who had been appointed  as leader of the theoretical division  of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] by [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], its scientific director.<ref name="ULAM 143-147"/>

At this time, Ulam knew nothing of Los Alamos.  To learn more, he checked out of the library a New Mexico guidebook. On the checkout slip, he found the names of his Wisconsin colleagues, [[Joan Hinton]], [[David H. Frisch|David Frisch]], and Joseph McKibben,<ref name='MCKIBB'/> who had mysteriously disappeared from Madison to secret war work.<ref name='VITA'/>  This was Ulam's introduction to the [[Manhattan Project]], which was America's wartime effort to create the atomic bomb.<ref name='LANLBIO'/>

===Hydrodynamical calculations of implosion===
A few weeks after Ulam reached [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]] in February 1944, the project experienced a crisis.  In April, [[Emilio G. Segr<U+00E8>|Emilio Segr<U+00E8>]] discovered that [[plutonium]] made in [[Nuclear reactors#Early reactors|reactors]] would not work in a [[gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] plutonium weapon like the "[[Thin Man nuclear bomb|Thin Man]]", which was being developed in parallel with a uranium weapon, the "[[Little Boy]]" that was dropped on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Hiroshima|Hiroshima]].  This problem threatened to waste an enormous investment in new reactors at the [[Hanford site]] and to make slow [[Isotope separation|separation of uranium isotopes]] the only way to prepare [[fissile]] material suitable for use in bombs.  To respond, Oppenheimer implemented, in August, a sweeping reorganization of the laboratory to focus on development of an [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion-type weapon]] and appointed [[George Kistiakowsky]] head of the implosion department.  He was a professor at Harvard and an expert on precise use of explosives.<ref name="HODDESON 130-137"/>

The basic concept of [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] is to use chemical explosives to crush a chunk of fissile material into a [[critical mass]], where [[neutron]] multiplication leads to a [[nuclear chain reaction]], which suddenly releases a large amount of energy.  Cylindrical implosive configurations had been studied by [[Seth Neddermeyer]], but von Neumann, who had experience with [[shaped charges]] used in [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|armor piercing ammunition]], was a [[John_von_Neumann#Nuclear_weapons|vocal advocate of spherical implosion]] driven by [[explosive lens]]es.  He realized that the symmetry and speed with which implosion compressed the plutonium were critical issues,<ref name="HODDESON 130-137"/> and enlisted Ulam to help design lens configurations that would provide nearly spherical implosion.  Within an implosion, because of enormous pressures and high temperatures, solid materials behave much like fluids.  This meant that  [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamical]] calculations were needed to predict and minimize asymmetries that would spoil a nuclear detonation.  Of these calculations, Ulam said:{{quote|The hydrodynamical problem was simply stated, but very difficult to calculate&nbsp;<U+2013> not only in detail, but even in order of magnitude.  In this discussion, I stressed pure pragmatism and the necessity to get a heuristic survey of the problem by simpleminded brute force, rather than by massive numerical work.<ref name='VITA'/>}}

Nevertheless,  with the primitive facilities available at the time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations that led to a satisfactory design.  This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years,<ref name='COMPEARLY'/> continued through the cold war, and still exists.<ref name='COMPLATE'/>

===Statistics of branching and multiplicative processes===
Even the inherent statistical fluctuations of [[neutron]] multiplication within the [[chain reaction]], have implications with regard to implosion speed and symmetry.  In November 1944, [[David Hawkins (philosopher)|David Hawkins]]<ref name='HAWKINS'/> and Ulam addressed this point in a report entitled "Theory of Multiplicative Processes I", whose last page gives some suggestions pertinent to bomb design.<ref name='LA171'/>   However, this report, which invokes [[probability-generating function]]s, is also an early entry in the extensive literature on statistics of [[Branching process|branching]] and multiplicative processes.  In 1948, its scope was extended by another pioneering exploration by Ulam and C. J. Everett.<ref name='MULT123'/>

Early in the Manhattan project, [[Enrico Fermi]]'s attention was focused on the use of reactors to produce plutonium.  In September 1944, he arrived at Los Alamos, shortly after breathing life into the [[Manhattan Project#Hanford reactors|first Hanford reactor]], which had been [[Nuclear poison|poisoned]] by a [[Xenon-135|xenon isotope]].<ref name="HEWLETT"/> Soon after Fermi's arrival, [[Teller's "Super" bomb]] group, of which Ulam was a part, was transferred to a new division headed by Fermi.<ref name="ULAM 152-153"/> Fermi and Ulam formed a relationship that became very fruitful after the war.<ref name="ULAM 162-167"/>

==Post war Los Alamos==
In September 1945, Ulam left Los Alamos to become an associate professor at the [[University of Southern California]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].  In January 1946, he suffered an acute attack of [[encephalitis]], which put his life in danger, but which was alleviated by emergency brain surgery.  During his recuperation, many friends visited, including [[Nicholas Metropolis]] from Los Alamos and the famous mathematician [[Paul Erd<U+0151>s]],<ref name='ERDOS'/> who remarked: "Stan, you are just like before."<ref name='VITA'/>  This was encouraging, because Ulam was concerned about the state of his mental faculties, for he had lost the ability to speak during the crisis.  Much later, after Ulam's death, another friend, [[Gian-Carlo Rota]], asserted that the attack changed Ulam's personality; afterwards, he turned from rigorous pure mathematics to more speculative conjectures concerning the application of mathematics to physics and [[biology]].<ref name='ROTA'/>  However, this suggestion was not accepted by Fran<U+00E7>oise Ulam.<ref name='FULAM'/>

By late April 1946, Ulam had recovered enough to attend a secret conference at Los Alamos to discuss [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapons]].  Those in attendance included Ulam, von Neumann, Metropolis, Teller, [[Stan Frankel]], and others. Throughout his participation in the Manhattan Project, Teller's efforts had been directed toward the development of a "super" weapon based on [[nuclear fusion]], rather than toward development of a practical fission bomb.  After extensive discussion, the participants reached a consensus that his ideas were worthy of further exploration.  A few weeks later, Ulam received an offer of a position at Los Alamos from Metropolis and [[Robert D. Richtmyer]], the new head of its theoretical division, at a higher salary, and the Ulams returned to Los Alamos.<ref name="ULAM 184-187"/>

===Monte Carlo method===
[[File:STAN ULAM HOLDING THE FERMIAC.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Stan Ulam Holding the [[FERMIAC]]<br/>From a Los Alamos Technical Report.]]
Late in the war, under the sponsorship of von Neumann, Frankel and Metropolis began to carry out calculations on the first general-purpose electronic computer, the [[ENIAC]].  Shortly after returning to Los Alamos, Ulam participated in a review of results from these calculations.<ref name='METROPOLIS'/>  Earlier, while playing [[Patience (game)|solitaire]] during his recovery from surgery, Ulam had thought about playing hundreds of games to estimate statistically the probability of a successful outcome.<ref name='ECKHARDT'/>  With ENIAC in mind, he realized that the availability of computers made such statistical methods very practical.  John von Neumann immediately saw the significance of this insight, and in March 1947, proposed to Robert Richtmyer, a statistical approach to the problem of neutron diffusion in fissionable material.<ref name='LAMS551'/>  Because Ulam had often mentioned his uncle "who just had to go to Monte Carlo" to gamble, Metropolis dubbed the statistical approach "The [[Monte Carlo method]]".<ref name='METROPOLIS'/>  In this context, the fact that Ulam's uncle Michael died in [[Monte Carlo]] is interesting.<ref name='MIKEDEATH'/> 

In 1948, ENIAC was moved from the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]], where it had been conceived and designed by [[John Mauchly]] and [[J. Presper Eckert]], to the [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] in [[Aberdeen, Maryland]].  Here, with von Neumann's inspiration, Richard Clippinger suggested that it could be configured in a [[Jury-rig|jury rigged]] version of the [[von Neumann architecture|stored-program architecture]] that has become standard on most computers.  This architecture greatly facilitated programming, and  on 16 September 1948, ENIAC was first run as a [[stored-program computer]].  Soon, it was put to work on Monte Carlo calculations of neutron transport by Metropolis and von Neumann.  In 1949, Metropolis and Ulam published the first unclassified paper on the Monte Carlo method.<ref name='MONTEPAPER'/>

Statistical techniques began in the 18th century, when [[Buffon's needle]] was proposed as a way to approximate the number [[pi|&pi;]].  Fermi used them in the 1930s, and when he heard of Ulam's breakthrough, created the [[FERMIAC]], which performs a mechanical simulation of random diffusion of neutrons.<ref name='METROPOLIS'/>  These ideas embody the context of Ulam's innovation, but not its essence, which is the probabilistic use of electronic computers to carry out ''rapidly'' the large numbers of tedious repetitions that are needed to achieve usable accuracy.  As computers improved, these methods became more useful.  In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern [[massively parallel]] [[supercomputers]] are [[embarrassingly parallel]] applications, whose results can be very accurate.<ref name='COMPLATE'/>

===Teller<U+2013>Ulam design===
On 29 August 1949, the [[Soviet Union]] tested its first fission bomb, the [[RDS-1]].  Created under the supervision of [[Lavrentiy Beria]], who sought to duplicate the American effort, this weapon was nearly identical to Fat Man, for its design was based on information provided by spies [[Klaus Fuchs]], [[Theodore Hall]], and [[David Greenglass]].  In response, on 31 January 1950, [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] announced a crash program to develop a fusion bomb.<ref name='DUNCAN'/>

To advocate an aggressive development program, [[Ernest Lawrence]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] came to Los Alamos, where they conferred with [[Norris Bradbury]], the laboratory director, and with [[George Gamow]], [[Edward Teller]], and Ulam.  Soon, these three became members of a short-lived committee appointed by Bradbury to study the problem, with Teller as chairman.<ref name='VITA'/>  At this time, research on the use of a fission weapon to create a [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reaction]] had been ongoing since 1942, but the design was still essentially the one originally proposed by Teller.   His concept was to put some  [[tritium]] and/or [[deuterium]] in close proximity to a fission bomb, with the hope that the heat and intense flux of neutrons released when the bomb exploded, would ignite a self-sustaining [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reaction]].  Reactions of these [[isotopes of hydrogen]] are of interest because the energy per unit mass of fuel released by their fusion is much larger than that from fission of heavy nuclei.<ref name="RHODES"/>

[[File:IvyMike2.jpg|left|thumb|300px|[[Ivy Mike]], the first full test of the Teller<U+2013>Ulam design (a [[Nuclear weapon design#Two-stage thermonuclear weapons|staged]] fusion bomb), with a [[TNT equivalent|yield]] of 10.4 megatons on 1 November 1952]]
Because the results of calculations based on Teller's concept were discouraging, many scientists believed it [[History of the Teller<U+2013>Ulam design#Teller's "Super"|could not lead to a successful weapon]], while others had moral and economic grounds for not proceeding.  Consequently, several senior people of the Manhattan Project opposed development, including Bethe and Oppenheimer.<ref name= "HEWLETT AND DUNCAN"/>

To clarify the situation, Ulam and von Neumann resolved to do new calculations to determine whether Teller's approach was feasible.  To carry out these studies, von Neumann decided to use electronic computers. This approach was made possible by his access to computers: ENIAC at Aberdeen, a new computer, [[MANIAC I|MANIAC]], at Princeton, and its twin, which was under construction at Los Alamos.  Ulam enlisted C. J. Everett to follow a completely different approach, which was guided by physical intuition.  With the aid of a cadre of female "[[Human computers#Wartime computing and the invention of electronic computing|data analysts]]", including Fran<U+00E7>oise Ulam,<ref name='FULAM'/>  who performed computations on [[mechanical calculator]]s, and whose efforts were supplemented and confirmed by Everett's use of his [[slide rule]], they carried out laborious and extensive computations of many thermonuclear scenarios.  Ulam and Fermi collaborated on further analysis of these scenarios.  The results showed that, in workable configurations, a thermonuclear reaction would not ignite, and if ignited, it would not be self-sustaining.  In late 1950, these conclusions were confirmed by von Neumann's results.<ref name="RHODES 422-424"/>

In January 1951, Ulam had another idea: to channel the mechanical shock of a nuclear explosion to compress the fusion fuel.  On the recommendation of his wife,<ref name='FULAM'/> Ulam discussed this idea with Bradbury and Mark before he told Teller about it.<ref name='MARKBIO'/>   Almost immediately, Teller saw its merit.  However, he noted that soft [[X-rays]] from the fission bomb would compress the thermonuclear fuel more strongly than mechanical shock and suggested ways to enhance this effect.  On 9 March 1951, Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report describing these innovations.<ref name='LAMS1225'/>  A few weeks later, Teller suggested placing a [[fissile]] rod or cylinder at the center of the fusion fuel.  The detonation of this "spark plug",<ref name='LAMS1230'/> would help to initiate and enhance the fusion reaction.  The design based on these ideas, called staged radiation implosion, has become the standard way to build thermonuclear weapons. It is often designated as the "[[Teller<U+2013>Ulam design]]".<ref name="RHODES 455-464"/>

[[File:Ivy Mike Sausage device.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Sausage'' device of [[Ivy Mike|Mike]] nuclear test (yield 10.4 Mt) on [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak Atoll]]. The test was part of the [[Operation Ivy|Operation Ivy]]. The Sausage was the first true H-Bomb ever tested, that is - the first [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] device built upon the [[Teller<U+2013>Ulam design|Teller-Ulam]] principles of staged radiation implosion. It consisted of a thick steel radiation case ''(left)'', containing a [[Mark 5 nuclear bomb|TX-5 fission bomb]] at bottom as a trigger, and above it a [[Cryogenic storage dewar|dewar]] containing several hundred liters of liquid [[Deuterium|deuterium]], the fusion fuel, and a [[Plutonium|plutonium]] rod called the "sparkplug" to initiate the fusion reaction.  The large pipes at right are "light pipes" to conduct the initial radiation emitted by the explosion to remote instruments to study the physics of the thermonuclear reactions.]]
In May 1951, during [[Operation Greenhouse]], the explosions of devices "George" and "[[Greenhouse Item|Item]]" proved that a fission explosion could trigger non-sustaining fusion reactions in a mixture of deuterium and tritium.  Although these tests did not produce a thermonuclear detonation, they showed that a small fusion component could significantly enhance a fission explosion.  These results validated Teller's concept of [[boosted fission weapon|boosted fission]], which is incorporated in nearly all modern weapons.<ref name="RHODES 471-475"/>

Although Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report on their design<ref name='LAMS1225'/> and jointly applied for a patent on it,<ref name='LANLBIO'/> they soon became involved in a dispute over who deserved credit.<ref name='MARKBIO'/>  After the war, [[Hans Bethe]] returned to [[Cornell University]], but he was deeply involved in the development of thermonuclear weapons as a consultant.  In 1954, he wrote an article on the history of the H-bomb,<ref name='BETHE'/> which presents his opinion that both men contributed very significantly to the breakthrough.  This balanced view is shared by others who were involved, including Mark and Fermi, but Teller persistently attempted to downplay Ulam's role.<ref name = 'UCHII'/>

With the basic fusion reactions confirmed, and with a feasible design in hand, there was nothing to prevent Los Alamos from testing a thermonuclear device.  On 1 November 1952, the first thermonuclear explosion occurred when [[Ivy Mike]] was detonated on [[Enewetak Atoll]], within the US [[Pacific Proving Grounds]].  This device, which used liquid deuterium as its fusion fuel, was immense and utterly unusable as a weapon.  Nevertheless, its success validated the Teller<U+2013>Ulam design, and stimulated intensive development of practical weapons.<ref name="ULAM 220-221"/>

On 12 August 1953, the Soviets detonated their [[Joe 4|RDS-6s]] device, which incorporated the [[Sloika]] design that had been developed by [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Vitaly Ginzburg]].  This code name, which refers to a Russian layer cake, reflects the design, in which fusion fuel is layered within a fission bomb.  This configuration is similar to that of [[Operation Greenhouse|Greenhouse "George"]] and of the "[[Nuclear_weapon_design#Alarm_Clock.2FSloika|Alarm Clock]]", which Teller proposed as an implementation of his original ideas.  Although the Soviet design did not lead to full thermonuclear detonation, it embodied Ginzburg's crucial idea of November 1948, which is to use lithium deuteride as a fusion fuel.<ref name='GONCH'/> 

When fission neutrons break apart the lithium nuclei, some of the fragments are tritium nuclei, which participate in a very effective fusion reaction with the deuterium that is already present.  The great advantage is that, in effect, both tritium and deuterium are encapsulated in a dense chemical compound.  There is no need to use the cryogenic equipment for liquid deuterium that made the Ivy Mike device impractical as a weapon.  On 1 March 1954, this advantage was realized in the "shrimp" device of [[Castle Bravo]], which produced the largest American test explosion and provided a prototype for nearly all subsequent thermonuclear weapons.  On 22 November 1955, the Soviets set off [[RDS-37]], which was their first thermonuclear bomb.  It embodied the Teller<U+2013>Ulam design, which Sakharov and other Soviet scientists had worked out independently.<ref name='GONCH'/>

===Fermi<U+2013>Pasta<U+2013>Ulam problem===
When Ulam returned to Los Alamos, his attention turned away from weapon design and toward the use of computers to investigate problems in physics and mathematics.  With [[John Pasta]], who helped Metropolis to bring MANIAC on line in March 1952, he explored these ideas in a report "Heuristic Studies in Problems of Mathematical Physics on High Speed Computing Machines", which was submitted on 9 June 1953. It treated several problems that cannot be addressed within the framework of traditional analytic methods: billowing of fluids, rotational motion in gravitating systems, magnetic lines of force, and hydrodynamic instabilities.<ref name='LA1557'/>

Soon, Pasta and Ulam became experienced with electronic computation on MANIAC, and by this time, Enrico Fermi had settled into a routine of spending academic years at the University of Chicago and summers at Los Alamos. During these summer visits, Pasta and Ulam joined him to study a variation of the classic problem of a string of masses  held together by springs that exert forces linearly proportional to their displacement from equilibrium.  Fermi proposed to add to this force a nonlinear component, which could be chosen to be proportional to either the square or cube of the displacement, or to a more complicated "broken linear" function. This addition is the key element of the [[Fermi<U+2013>Pasta<U+2013>Ulam problem]], which is often designated by the abbreviation FPU.<ref name='LA1940'/><ref name='FPU'/>

With the aid of standard mathematics, the classical spring system can be described in terms of  vibrational modes, which are analogous to the harmonics that occur on a stretched violin string.  If the system starts in a particular mode, vibrations in other modes do not develop.  With the nonlinear component, Fermi expected energy in one mode  to transfer gradually to other modes, and eventually, to be distributed equally among all modes.  This is roughly what began to happen shortly after the system was initialized with all its energy in the lowest mode, but much later, essentially all the energy periodically reappeared in the lowest mode.<ref name='FPU'/>  This amazing behavior is very different from the expected [[Equipartition theorem|equipartition of energy]].  It remained mysterious until 1965, when [[Martin David Kruskal|Kruskal]] and [[Norman Zabusky|Zabusky]] showed that, after appropriate mathematical transformations, the system can be described by the [[Korteweg-de Vries equation]], which is the prototype of nonlinear [[partial differential equations]] that have [[soliton]] solutions.  This means that FPU behavior can be understood in terms of solitons.<ref name='ZABUK'/>

===Nuclear propulsion===
[[File:NASA-project-orion-artist.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An artist's conception of the NASA reference design for the Project Orion spacecraft powered by nuclear propulsion.]]
During the war, Ulam and [[Frederick Reines]] considered [[nuclear propulsion]] of aircraft and rockets.<ref name='LAMS2186'/>  This is an attractive possibility, because the nuclear energy per unit mass of fuel is a million times greater than that available from chemicals.  From 1955 to 1972, their ideas were pursued during [[Project Rover]], which explored the use of nuclear reactors to power rockets.  It was administered by Los Alamos, but many of its activities were carried out elsewhere.  In particular, fuel rods were developed at the [[Rocky Flats Plant]], and twenty rockets were tested at the Nuclear Reactor Development Station, which was located at [[Area 25 (Nevada National Security Site)|Jackass Flats]] within the [[Nevada Test Site]].<ref name="ULAM 249-254"/>

In 1955, Ulam and C. J. Everett proposed, in contrast to [[Nuclear thermal rocket|Rover's continuous heating of rocket exhaust]], to harness small nuclear explosions for propulsion.<ref name='LAMS1955'/>  [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] was a study of this idea.  It began in 1958 and ended in 1965, after the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963 banned nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere and in space.<ref name='ORION'/>  Work on this project was spearheaded by physicist [[Freeman Dyson]], who commented on the decision to end Orion in his article, "Death of a Project".<ref name='DEATH'/>

In 1957, Bradbury appointed Ulam and [[John H. Manley]] as research advisors to the laboratory director.  These newly created positions were on the same administrative level as division leaders, and Ulam held his until he retired from Los Alamos.  In this capacity, he was able to influence and guide programs in many divisions: theoretical, physics, chemistry, metallurgy, weapons, health, Rover, and others.<ref name="ULAM 249-254"/>

In addition to these activities, Ulam continued to publish technical reports and research papers. One of these introduced the [[Fermi<U+2013>Ulam model]], which is an extension of Fermi's theory of [[Fermi acceleration|the acceleration of cosmic rays]].<ref name='FUM'/>  Another, with Paul Stein, which was titled "Quadratic Transformations", was an early investigation of [[chaos theory]].<ref name='LA-2305'/>

==Return to academia==
During his years at Los Alamos, Ulam was a visiting professor at: Harvard from 1951 to 1952, [[MIT]] from 1956 to 57, the [[University of California, San Diego]], in 1963, and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] from 1961 to 1962 and 1965 to 1967.  In 1967, the last of these positions became permanent, when Ulam was appointed as professor and Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at [[Boulder, Colorado]].<ref name="AIP"/>  However, he kept a residence in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], which made it convenient to spend summers at Los Alamos as a consultant.

In Colorado, where he rejoined his friends Gamow, Richtmyer, and Hawkins, Ulam's research interests turned toward [[biology]].  In 1968, recognizing this emphasis, the [[University of Colorado Denver|University of Colorado School of Medicine]] appointed Ulam as Professor of Biomathematics, and he held this position until his death.  With his Los Alamos colleague  Robert Schrandt he published a report, "Some Elementary Attempts at Numerical Modeling of Problems Concerning Rates of Evolutionary Processes", which applied some of his earlier ideas on branching processes to biological inheritance.<ref name='LA-4246'/>  Another, report, with William Beyer, Temple F. Smith, and M. L. Stein, titled "Metrics in Biology", introduced some new ideas about biometric distances.<ref name='LA-4973'/>

[[File:Ulam 1.png|right|thumb|300px|When the positive integers are arrayed along the [[Ulam spiral]], prime numbers, represented by dots, tend to collect along diagonal lines.]]

When he retired from Colorado in 1975, Ulam had begun to spend winter semesters at the [[University of Florida]], where he was a graduate research professor. Except for [[sabbatical]]s at the [[University of California, Davis]] from 1982 to 1983, and at [[Rockefeller University]] from 1980 to 1984,<ref name="AIP"/> this pattern of spending summers in Colorado and Los Alamos and winters in Florida continued until Ulam died on 13 May 1984, in Santa Fe.<ref name='LANLBIO'/>  Fran<U+00E7>oise Ulam continued to live there until she died on 30 April 2011, at the age of 93.<ref name='FULAMOBIT'/> In 1987, she deposited his papers with the [[American Philosophical Society]] Library in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name="PAPERS"/>

==Mathematics==
From the publication of his first paper in 1929, during his  days as a student, until his death, Ulam was constantly writing on mathematics.  The list of Ulam's publications, which includes more than 150 papers,<ref name='AJMAA'/> contains many on pure mathematics.  Some topics represented here by a significant number of papers are: [[set theory]] (including [[measurable cardinal]]s and abstract [[measure (mathematics)|measures]]), [[topology]], [[Transformation (function)|transformation theory]], [[ergodic theory]], [[group theory]], [[Variety (universal algebra)|projective algebra]], [[number theory]], [[combinatorics]], and [[graph theory]].<ref name='UPUBS'/>

Ulam's colleague at Colorado, [[Jan Mycielski]], has given his perspective on Ulam's contributions to mathematics.<ref name='UMATH'/>  In their paper honoring the 100th anniversary of his birth,<ref name='AJMAA'/> [[List of Polish mathematicians|Ciesielski]] and [[Themistocles M. Rassias|Rassias]] give more insight, and note that, in March 2009, the [[Mathematical Reviews]] database contained an "amazing" 697 papers with the name "Ulam" in their titles.<ref name='UAMS'/>  [[Paul Erd<U+0151>s]] has also commented on Ulam's work in mathematics.<ref name='ERDOS'/>

==Impact and legacy==
With his pivotal role in the development of thermonuclear weapons, Stanislaw Ulam changed the world.  He felt very little guilt.  According to Fran<U+00E7>oise Ulam: "Stan would reassure me that, barring accidents, the H-bomb rendered nuclear war impossible."<ref name=FULAM/> In 1980, Ulam and his wife appeared in the television documentary ''[[The Day After Trinity]]''.<ref>{{imdb title|id=0080594|title=The Day After Trinity}}</ref>

The [[Monte Carlo method]] has become a ubiquitous and standard approach to computation.  In addition to problems in science and mathematics, the method has been applied to:  [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|finance]], [[social science]],<ref name='MONTESOC'/> environmental [[risk assessment]],<ref name='MONTERISK'/> [[linguistics]],<ref name='MONTELING'/> [[radiation therapy]],<ref name='MONTEONC'/> sports,<ref name='MONTEBIG10'/> and many other fields.  In 2011, a search for books about the method on [[amazon.com]], produced more than 13,000 items.<ref name='MONTESEARCH'/>

The [[Fermi<U+2013>Pasta<U+2013>Ulam problem]] is credited not only as "the birth of experimental mathematics",<ref name='FPU'/> but also as inspiration for the vast field of Nonlinear Science.  In his [[Lilienfeld Prize]] lecture, Donald Campbell noted this relationship and described how FPU gave rise to ideas in [[Chaos theory|chaos]], [[solitons]], and [[Dynamical systems theory|dynamical systems]].<ref name='CAMPB'/>  In 1980, [[Donald Kerr]], laboratory director at Los Alamos, with the strong support of Ulam and [[Mark Kac]],<ref name = 'CNLSSCOTT'/> founded the Center for Nonlinear Studies  (CNLS).<ref name='CNLSHIST'/>  Alwyn Scott was its first director, and Kac was chairman of its first external advisory committee, on which [[Martin Kruskal]] also served. The purpose of CNLS is to continue the laboratory's tradition of work in nonlinear science, which began with FPU, but which also includes [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]]'s important work in [[Chaos theory|chaos]] and [[fractal]]s (1975). In 1985, CNLS initiated the ''Stanislaw M. Ulam Distinguished Scholar'' program, which provides a prestigious annual award that enables a noted scientist to spend a year carrying out research at Los Alamos.<ref name='CNLSULAM'/>  To celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the original FPU paper, the problem was the subject of a focus issue of the journal Chaos,<ref name='FPUCHAOS'/> and of the 25th Annual International Conference of CNLS.<ref name='CNLSFPU'/>

The [[University of Southern Mississippi]] and the University of Florida supported the ''Ulam Quarterly'',<ref name='UQUART'/> which was active from 1992 to 1996, and which was one of the first online mathematical journals.<ref name='UQUART2'/>  Florida's Department of Mathematics has sponsored, since 1998, the annual ''Ulam Colloquium Lecture'',<ref name='UCOLLOQ'/> and in March 2009, the ''Ulam Centennial Conference''.<ref name='UCONF'/> In 1985, Beyer, Sellers, and [[Michael Waterman|Waterman]] reviewed Ulam's contributions to theoretical biology in terms of his work in [[Cellular automata#History|cellular automata]] theory, [[population biology]], [[pattern recognition]], and biometric spaces.<ref name='BIOLOGY'/>  In much of this work, Ulam attempted to define distance metrics, which differ from Euclidian distances, but which are appropriate measures in the context of molecular  biology.  In 1982, Ulam gave an overview of these ideas in his Gamow memorial lecture at the University of Colorado.<ref name='GAMOW'/>  His Los Alamos colleague, [[Walter Goad]], has described their impact on [[sequence analysis]].<ref name='GOAD'/>

In 1987, Los Alamos issued a special issue of its ''Science'' publication, which summarized his accomplishments,<ref name='UTRIB'/> and which appeared, in 1989, as the book ''From Cardinals to Chaos''.  Similarly, in 1990, the University of California Press issued a compilation of mathematical reports by Ulam and his Los Alamos collaborators: ''Analogies Between Analogies''.<ref name='ANALOG'/> During his career, Ulam was awarded honorary degrees by the Universities of [[University of New Mexico|New Mexico]], [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], and [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]].<ref name='VITA'/>
