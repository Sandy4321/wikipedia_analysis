'''Northern England''', also known as the '''North of England''', '''the North''' or the '''North Country''', is a [[cultural region]] of [[England]]. It is not an official [[Regions of England|government region]], but rather an informal amalgamation of [[counties of England|counties]]. It extends roughly from the [[River Trent]] to the south,<ref>{{cite web |title=Entire Catchment Flood Modelling as a Planning Tool <U+2013> River Trent Case Study|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090914214327/http://glenelg-hopkinsvicgovau.ascetinteractive.com.au/images/file/Joel%20Leister%20-%20Entire%20Catchment%20Flood%20Modelling%20as%20a%20Planning%20Tool.doc|publisher=Glenelg Hopkins CMA}} Retrieved on 23&nbsp;February 2009.</ref> to [[Scotland]] in the north.

Northern England includes three [[Regions of England|Euro constituencies]]: the [[North East England|North East]], [[North West England|North West]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]]. These have a combined population of around 14.5 million and an area of 37,331&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (14,414 sq mi).

During antiquity most of the area was part of ''Brigantia''<U+2014>homeland of the [[Brigantes]] and the largest [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] kingdom of [[Great Britain]]. After the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] the city of [[York]] became capital of the area, called [[Britannia Inferior]] then [[Britannia Secunda]]. In [[Sub-Roman Britain]] new Brythonic kingdoms of the ''[[Hen Ogledd]]'' ("Old North") emerged. The [[Angles|Angle]] settlers created [[Bernicia]] and [[Deira]] from which came [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] and a [[Northumbria's Golden Age|Golden Age]] in cultural, scholarly and monastic activity,  centred on [[Lindisfarne]] and aided by Irish monks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historical background to The Golden Age|url=http://www.goldenageofnorthumbria.com/history.html|publisher=Golden Age of Northumbria}} Retrieved on 23&nbsp;February 2009.</ref> [[Norsemen|Norse]] and [[Norse Gael|Gaelic]] [[Viking]] raiders gained control of much of the area, creating the [[Danelaw]]. During this time there were close relations with [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles|Mann and the Isles]], [[Kingdom of Dublin|Dublin]] and [[Norway]]. Northumbria was unified with the rest of England under [[Eadred of England|Eadred]] around 952.

After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] in 1066, the [[Harrying of the North]] brought destruction, but afterwards many towns were built and founded. A [[Council of the North]] was in place during the [[Late Middle Ages]] until the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] after the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. The area experienced [[Anglo<U+2013>Scottish border]] fighting until the [[History of the formation of the United Kingdom|unification of Britain]] under the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]].

==Definitions==

===Linguistically===
{{main|Northern English}}
Concepts of the North take account of perceived "northern" [[English language in England|regional accents]].  Experts on historical dialects categorise as northern the area north of a line that begins at the [[Humber estuary]], and runs up the [[River Wharfe]] and across to the [[River Lune]] in [[north Lancashire]].<ref>See, for example, John Wells, ''Accents of English Volume 2'', pages 349-350, or Peter Trudgill, ''The Dialects of England'', pages 39-41</ref> However, the linguistic elements that traditionally defined this area, such as use of ''doon'' instead of ''down'' and substitution of -''ang'' noise in words that end -''ong'' (''lang'' instead of ''long''), are now prevalent only in the more northern parts of the region; these linguistic features may reflect a more modern interpretation of where the line sits today. As speech has changed, there is little consensus on what defines a "northern" accent or dialect. Many people in northern England omit certain sounds from sentences in casual speech, such as saying "I'm goin't shops" or "I'm going the shops" as opposed to "I'm going to the shops." This is particularly common in Yorkshire and Lancashire and can be found as far south as [[Leicestershire]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

This much-lampooned speech habit is often misunderstood or misrepresented. The "t'" is usually more of a [[glottal stop]]<U+2014>and it replaces "the" entirely when the next word begins with a consonant: "I'm going to t'shops" is often rendered in mimickery with the "t'" sounded distinctly. This is actually very unusual in natural northern speech. The "t" should be silent, represented by almost a stutter. Exceptions to this occur when the next word begins with a vowel: "Put t'pie in th'oven" would ''not'' sound the "t'" (as described above) but ''would'' run the "th'" audibly into "oven". This would give a word sound "thoven", just perhaps with a slight stop between "th" and "oven".

===Geographically===
[[File:Route A1.jpg|thumb|200px]] 
The north of England may also be considered as the area (from coast to coast) surrounding the [[Pennines]], an [[Highland (geography)|upland]] chain often referred to as "the backbone of England". This stretches from the [[Cheviot Hills]] on the border with Scotland to the [[Peak District]]. The areas defined were formerly dominated by heavy industry and mineral extraction and processing. Combined with the characteristically wild, hilly landscape of the region, this has led to the popular belief, mainly by those from the south of England, of it being "grim up North".

It is an area of contrasting landscapes. There are several urban belts, many of which join to form one larger belt that runs from Liverpool to Leeds along the [[M62 motorway|M62]] corridor, then south to Sheffield along the [[M1 motorway|M1]] corridor. There are further agglomerations in the north-east and east of Preston. Around 11 million people live in the area covered by [[the Northern Way]], most in its largest cities [[Leeds]], [[Sheffield]], [[Liverpool]], [[Bradford]] and [[Manchester]].

===Government Office Regions===
The north might also be considered to include the three former [[Regions of England|Government Office Regions]] of [[North East England]], [[North West England]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]]. This area consists of the ceremonial counties of [[Cheshire]], [[Cumbria]], [[County Durham]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], [[Greater Manchester]], [[Lancashire]], [[Merseyside]], [[Northumberland]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[Tyne and Wear]], [[West Yorkshire]] and part of [[Lincolnshire]]. The regions also hold the [[North of England Inward Investment Agency]] which is a UK government sponsored agency that represents two Regional Development Agencies in north England: Northwest Regional Development Agency (NWDA) and One Northeast (ONE).

====Traditional counties====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}
Alternatively, the north might be considered to comprise the seven [[Historic counties of England|traditional counties]] of [[Cheshire]], [[Cumberland, England|Cumberland]], [[Northumberland]], [[Westmorland]], [[County Durham|Durham]], [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]]. The eastern part of this region coincides with the old Kingdom of [[Northumbria]] apart from those areas which were later absorbed into Scotland.

====Ecclesiastical====
Northern England is sometimes defined to coincide with the ecclesiastical [[Province of York]], which is overseen by the [[Archbishop of York]]. The Province includes the [[Isle of Man]], which in ecclesiastical terms is the see of [[Sodor and Man]].  A comparable definition in [[Roman Catholic]] terms would be the [[Archbishop of Liverpool|Province of Liverpool]].<ref>[http://www.valladolid.org/images/Dioceses%20E&W%20col%20gif%20names.gif Royal College of St. Alban, Valladolid] - The five provinces of England and Wales</ref>

==Sport==

===Football===

Football is the most popular sport in the north of England, and has many big clubs including four of the most successful teams in the country, [[Liverpool F.C|Liverpool]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Manchester United F.C|Manchester United]],  Northern clubs have won the [[List of English football champions|English league title]] 77 times, which is more than double the number of wins achieved by the rest of the country, taking into account that [[The Football League]] predominantly featured Northern and Midland clubs during the league's first two decades. Large Northern clubs are usually well supported. The largest football stadiums in the north are [[Old Trafford]] and [[City of Manchester Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] (Manchester), [[St James Park]] (Newcastle), [[Stadium of Light]] (Sunderland), [[Anfield]] and [[Goodison Park]] (Liverpool), [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] (Sheffield), [[Elland Road]] (Leeds) and [[Riverside Stadium]] (Middlesbrough).

===Rugby===
{{see also|History of Rugby League}}
The sport of [[Rugby football|rugby]] underwent a [[History of rugby league|schism]] in 1895 when many teams based in [[Yorkshire]], [[Lancashire]] and surrounding areas broke away from the [[Rugby Football Union]] and formed their own [[Rugby League]].<ref name= begin>{{cite book

The north contributed to a powerful [[Rugby Union]] team in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s who beat the [[New Zealand]] [[All Blacks]] and the [[Australian]] [[Wallabies]]. Former players include [[Bill Beaumont]], [[Will Carling]] and [[Rory Underwood]], but more recently the region's club sides have become relatively weaker, with [[association football]], [[cricket]] and Rugby League being cited as more popular across the region.<ref>{{cite web|last=Eykyn |first=Alastair |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/13279854.stm |title=BBC Sport - Rugby union in the north of England is dying |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-05-04 |accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:England-878ad.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Danelaw]]]]

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] called an area similar to northern England "[[Britannia Inferior]]" (Lower Britain) and it was ruled from the city of ''[[Eboracum]]'' (modern [[York]]).<ref>''The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume XII'', London:  Cambridge University Press, 1970:  p.706</ref> The [[Brigantes]] occupied the region between the rivers [[River Tyne|Tyne]] and [[Humber]]. The sub-capital held sway over the rest of the land north of there, which included for a brief period the part of the [[Scottish lowlands]] between [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the [[Antonine Wall]].

After the arrival of the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]], the north was divided into rival kingdoms, Bernicia and Deira. Bernicia covered lands north of the Tees, whilst Deira corresponded roughly to the eastern half of modern-day Yorkshire. Bernicia and Deira were first united as [[Northumbria]] by [[Aethelfrith]], a king of Bernicia who conquered Deira around the year 604.<ref name="Kirby">D. P. Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'', pages 60<U+2013>61.</ref> An area east and west of the [[Pennines]] was divided into two [[Celts|Celtic]] kingdoms, [[Rheged]] (Cumbria and Lancashire) and [[Elmet]] (West Riding of Yorkshire).<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.geocities.com/heartland/lane/8771/elmete.html |publisher=Heartland |title=Kingdom of Elmete |date=24 October 2007 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080328132558/http://www.geocities.com/heartland/lane/8771/elmete.html |archivedate=28 March 2008}}</ref> The north of England forms a large part of the [[Hen Ogledd]], Welsh for 'Old North'. The north-west of England still retains vestiges of a Celtic culture, and had its own Celtic language, [[Cumbric Language|Cumbric]], spoken predominately in [[Cumbria]] until around the 12th century.

Parts of the north and east of England were subject to Danish control (the [[Danelaw]]) during the [[Viking era]], but the northern part of the old Anglo Saxon kingdom of [[Northumbria]], remained under Anglo-Saxon control.<ref>"The [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''Dene'' <U+2018>Danes<U+2019> usually refers to [[Scandinavia]]ns of any kind; most of the invaders were indeed Danish (East [[Old Norse|Norse]] speakers), but there were Norwegians (West Norse ''[speakers]'') among them as well." <U+2014>Lass, Roger, ''Old English: A Historical Linguistic Companion'', p.187, n.12. Cambridge University Press, 1994.</ref> Viking control of certain areas, particularly around Yorkshire  is recalled in the [[etymology]] of many place names and surnames in the area. [[Anglo-Norman]] aspirations in the [[the Pale|Pale of Ireland]] have some roots in the Viking forays on the [[Irish Sea]] and the trade route which ran from York and crossing the [[Edinburgh]]-[[Glasgow]] area in Scotland, to [[Dublin]] in Ireland.

Historically the north was controlled from London by the [[Council of the North]], based at the [[King's Manor]], York, set up in 1484 by Richard III.<ref name=founded>[http://richardiii-ipup.org.uk/timeline Richard III Timeline]</ref> However the major decisions affecting the north of England have been made entirely in London since this institution was abolished in 1641.<ref>[http://www.historyofyork.org.uk/themes/tudor-stuart/king-s-manor-tudor-and-stuart King's Manor Tudor and Stuart]</ref>

As the centre of the industrial revolution, northern England has long been characterised by its industrial centres, from the mill towns of Lancashire, textile centres of Yorkshire, shipyards of the north-east to the mining towns found throughout the north and the fishing ports along both east and west coasts. However, whilst much of the south and east of England has in general prospered economically, the north and west have remained relatively poor; consequently there are currently many government-subsidised [[urban regeneration]] projects happening across northern towns and cities, aiming to redress the lack of private investment in the area. Five of the ten most populous cities in the United Kingdom lie in the north.

The picture is not clear-cut, however, as the north has areas which are as wealthy as, if not wealthier than, fashionable southern areas such as [[Surrey]]. Yorkshire's "[[Golden Triangle (Yorkshire)|Golden Triangle]]" which extends from north [[Leeds]] to [[Harrogate]] and across to York is an example, as is [[Cheshire]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZBytBOxT_GAC&pg=PA1 |title=To the edge: entrepreneurial secrets from Britain's richest square mile |author=Malcolm McClean |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84112-782-8}}</ref> Equally, counties such as [[Cornwall]] share the relative economic deprivation often associated with parts of the north.

==Religion==
[[Image:York Minster (Blue Sky).jpg|160px|thumb|right|[[York Minster]].]]
Many religions are present in northern England, with [[Christianity]] remaining the largest since the Early Middle Ages; its existence in Britain dates back to the Roman era and continued through [[Early Insular Christianity]]. The ''Holy Island'' of [[Lindisfarne]] played an essential role in the Christianisation of [[Northumbria]], after [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]] from [[Connacht]] founded a monastery there as the first [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]] on the request of King [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Religious History of Lindisfarne|url=http://www.lindisfarne.org.uk/general/aidan.htm|publisher=Lindisfarne.org.uk}} Retrieved on 23&nbsp;February 2009.</ref> It is known for the creation of the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] and remains a place of pilgrimage.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Easter Walking Pilgrimage to Holy Island|url=http://www.northerncross.co.uk/about.htm|publisher=NorthernCross.co.uk}} Retrieved on 23&nbsp;February 2009.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The history of The Gospels|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/features/gospels/gospels_tense_past.shtml|publisher=BBC.co.uk}} Retrieved on 23&nbsp;February 2009.</ref> [[Paulinus of York|Paulinus]], as part of the [[Gregorian mission]], became the first [[Bishop of York]]. It was at the [[Synod of Whitby]] that calculations of Easter were brought into line with Roman calculations.

In the modern day, the three main forms of Christianity practised are [[Anglicanism]], [[Catholicism]] and [[Methodism]]. In terms of ecclesiastical administration of the [[Church of England]], the entire north is covered by the [[Province of York]], which is represented by the [[Archbishop of York]]. Likewise, with the exception of ''old'' Cheshire, the north is covered in [[Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales|Roman Catholic Church administration]] by the [[Province of Liverpool]] represented by the [[Archbishop of Liverpool]].

There is a sizeable [[Muslim]] population in the north, which ranges from zero percent in many rural areas to 19.4% in [[Blackburn with Darwen]].
