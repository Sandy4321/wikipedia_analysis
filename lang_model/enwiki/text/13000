'''Claudia Alta Taylor Johnson''' (born [[December 22]] [[1912]]) is the widow of former President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and was [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1963-1969. From infancy she has been known as '''Lady Bird'''.

==Early life==
[[Image:Andrews-Taylor_House_in_Karnack,_Texas.jpg|thumb|left|The Brick House, Lady Bird Johnson's birthplace and childhood home in Karnack, Texas.]]
Of English and Scottish descent, Claudia Alta Taylor was born in [[Karnack, Texas]], at The Brick House, the plantation home of her parents. Her father was Thomas Jefferson Taylor, a wealthy businessman who owned a general store; her mother, who died when she was five, was the former Minnie Pattillo. She had two elder brothers, Thomas and Antonio.

During her infancy, a nursemaid commented, "She's as pretty as a [[coccinellidae|ladybird]]", and the nickname virtually replaced her given name for the rest of her life. After her mother's death, she and her siblings were largely raised by Minnie Taylor's sister, Effie Pattillo.

Lady Bird Taylor graduated from Marshall Senior High School in [[Marshall, Texas]], studied [[journalism]] and [[art]] at St. Mary's Episcopal School for Girls, and graduated from the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]].

==Marriage and family==
She married [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] on [[November 17]] [[1934]], at [[Saint Mark's Episcopal Church, San Antonio|Saint Mark's Episcopal Church]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]].  After several miscarriages, they had two daughters, [[Lynda Bird Johnson Robb|Lynda]] (born [[1944]]), wife of [[Charles S. Robb]], and [[Luci Baines Johnson|Luci]] (born [[1947]]), who married Pat Nugent and Ian Turpin.

She is known for her love of the environment, which she developed as a child growing up near [[Caddo Lake]] in [[East Texas]]. She helped convince [[Texas]] to plant [[wildflower]]s on [[numbered highways in the United States|state highways]].

==First Lady of the United States==

As [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], Johnson started a capital beautification project (''Society for a More Beautiful National Capital'') to improve physical conditions in [[Washington, D.C.]], both for residents and tourists.  Her efforts inspired similar programs throughout the country. She was also instrumental in promoting the Highway Beautification Act, which sought to beautify the nation's highway system by limiting [[billboard (advertising)|billboards]] and by planting roadside areas.  

She was an advocate of the [[Head Start]] program.

Johnson's [[press secretary]] from 1963-1969 was [[Liz Carpenter]], a fellow University of Texas alumna. Carpenter was the first professional newswoman to be press secretary to a first lady, and she also served as Lady Bird's staff director.

In 1968, the First Lady cried uncontrollably at a White House luncheon for women after hearing anti-war statements by singer/actress [[Eartha Kitt]].  As a result, Kitt could not gain work in the U.S. for the next ten years and she was forced to work overseas.

==Later life==
In the 1970s, she focused her attention on the [[Austin, Texas]] riverfront area through her involvement in the Town Lake Beautification Project. She founded the [[Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center|National Wildflower Research Center]], a nonprofit organization devoted to preserving and reintroducing native plants in planned landscapes. The center is now known as the [[Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]]. On [[June 20]] [[2006]], The University of Texas at Austin announced plans to incorporate the Wildflower Center into the University. <ref name="Office of Public Affairs">{{cite press release | publisher=University of Texas at Austin | date=[[June 20]] [[2006]] | url=http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/2006/06/wildflower20.html | title=University of Texas System Regents authorize union of The University of Texas at Austin, Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center | accessdate=2006-07-02}}</ref>

After President Johnson died in 1973, Lady Bird remained in the public eye, honoring her husband and other Presidents.  She was the most active presidential widow during the 1970s, 1980s, and the early 1990s. She was in attendance at the inauguration of [[President George W. Bush]] in January of 2001.

By 1993, however, Johnson's health began to fail. She suffered a minor stroke in August 1993 and became [[legally blind]] due to [[macular degeneration]]. Johnson was hospitalized for a fainting spell on [[November 11]], [[1999]]. On [[May 2]], [[2002]], she suffered another [[stroke]] and was left unable to [[speak]] coherently or walk without assistance. In January of 2005, she spent a few days in an Austin hospital for treatment of [[bronchitis]]. 

In February 2006, Lynda Johnson Robb told a gathering at the Truman Library in [[Independence, Missouri]] that her mother is now totally blind and "is not in very good health". Mrs. Robb also said that she and her sister, Luci Johnson Nugent, still read to their mother and talk to her. <ref>http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/13834818.htm</ref>

At 94, Lady Bird Johnson is currently the oldest surviving First Lady of the United States. Only one former First Lady has lived longer: [[Bess Truman]] died at the age of 97 in [[1982]]. Mrs. Johnson and Bess Truman are the only First Ladies of the United States to live to 90 or more. Should Lady Bird Johnson live to or beyond [[August 26]], [[2010]], she will become the longest living First Lady of the United States. Mrs. Johnson has outlived one of her successors, [[Pat Nixon]], and has also outlived three of her husband's successors as president: [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. Lady Bird Johnson has personally known every other First Lady from [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] through [[Laura Bush]].

She was the only living presidential widow from [[May 19]], [[1994]] to [[June 5]], [[2004]] (some ten years), i.e. between the death of [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] and the day when [[Nancy Reagan]] was widowed.

She has been protected by the [[United States Secret Service]] longer than anyone else in history.

Poor health prevented Lady Bird Johnson from attending the state funerals of former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan in 2004 and Gerald Ford in 2007. During both funerals, she was represented by her elder daughter, Lynda Bird Johnson Robb.

Lady Bird Johnson, [[Betty Ford]], and Nancy Reagan are, [[as of 2007]], the only three surviving widows of former U.S. Presidents.

She was an honorary pallbearer for the funeral on [[May 29]], [[2006]], of former [[Senator]] [[Lloyd Bentsen]] of Texas. It is unclear whether or not she actually attended the funeral.
    
On [[September 13]] [[2006]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] news anchor Bill Balleza, when reporting on the death of [[Ann Richards]], said the former Texas governor's death had come as Texans were still mourning the "recent passing" of Lady Bird Johnson. Balleza was actually referring to [[Nellie Connally]], the former First Lady of Texas, who had passed away on [[September 6]] [[2006]]. A clearly embarrassed Balleza apologized later in the broadcast.  
    
On [[October 13]] [[2006]], Lady Bird Johnson made a rare public appearance at the renovation announcement of the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Library and Museum|Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]]. Sitting in a wheelchair and showing signs of recent health problems, Lady Bird seemed engaged and alert, and clapped along with those present at the ceremony.

==In popular culture==
[[Lady Bird Johnson Park]] is located in Washington, D.C.

Lady Bird Johnson Grove is located in [[Redwood National and State Parks]], Orick, [[California]].

In the show ''[[King of the Hill]]'', Hank stated that his dog, Lady Bird, was named after Lady Bird Johnson.

Lady Bird Johnson is also a huge supporter of the University of Texas athletics department. She has received the largest donation of football tickets in 2005 (130 total tickets per game) and the third largest donation of basketball tickets in 2005.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
