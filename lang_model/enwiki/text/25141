'''Hurricane Beatriz''' was a [[SSHS#Category 1|Category&nbsp;1]] hurricane that killed four people after brushing the [[Western Mexico|western coast of Mexico]]. Originating from an area of disturbed weather on June&nbsp;19, several hundred miles south-southeast of [[Mexico]], Beatriz gradually intensified. Gaining latitude, the system became increasingly organized and reached hurricane status on the evening of June&nbsp;20. The following morning, Beatriz attained winds of 90&nbsp;mph (150&nbsp;km/h) as it passed roughly 15&nbsp;mi (20&nbsp;km) of Mexico. Due to its interaction with land, the hurricane abruptly weakened hours later. Early on June&nbsp;22, Beatriz dissipated over open waters. Prior to Beatriz's arrival in Mexico, [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watches and warnings]] were issued for coastal areas. Hundreds of shelters opened across the states of [[Colima]] and [[Guerrero]]. Heavy rains from the storm triggered significant flooding along the Sabana River in [[Acapulco]], killing four people. However, the overall effects of Beatriz were limited and the rains were largely beneficial in mitigating a severe [[drought]].

On June&nbsp;16, 2011, a [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] situated off the southern coast of [[Guatemala]] showed signs of possible [[tropical cyclogenesis]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Robbie Berg|work=[[National Hurricane Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=June 16, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2011|title=Tropical Weather Outlook|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5zTflqbWV}}</ref> Though located within an area favoring development, the system remained broad and disorganized as it moved slowly west-northwestward.<ref>{{cite web|author=Todd Kimberlain|work=National Hurricane Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 16, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2011|title=Tropical Weather Outlook|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5zUW5wdyk}}</ref> Gradually, [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] consolidated around an [[Low-pressure area|area of low pressure]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Lixion Avila|work=National Hurricane Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2011|title=Tropical Weather Outlook|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5zVyzZYkR}}</ref> On June&nbsp;18, a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert]] was issued for the system as it was expected to develop into a [[Tropical cyclone#tropical depression|tropical depression]] within 24&nbsp;hours.<ref>{{cite web|work=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy|date=June 18, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2011|title=Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5zY5zmmZg}}</ref> The following morning, the low further developed and was declared Tropical Depression Two-E by the [[National Hurricane Center]].
