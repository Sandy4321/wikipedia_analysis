The '''Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin''' was a battle on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]]. As part of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] counteroffensives on the Western Front in the late summer of 1918, the [[Australian Corps]] crossed the [[Somme River]] on the night of August 31, and broke the [[German Empire|German]] lines at [[Mont Saint-Quentin]] and [[P<U+00E9>ronne, Somme|P<U+00E9>ronne]]. The [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|British Fourth Army]]'s commander, General [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Henry Rawlinson]], described the Australian advances of August 31 <U+2013> September 4 as the greatest military achievement of the war.<ref name = "AWM-MStQ">{{cite web  | url = http://www.awm.gov.au/1918/battles/mtstquentin.htm  | title = Mont Saint Quentin and P<U+00E9>ronne | work = Australian Victories: 1918 Australians in France | publisher = Australian War Memorial | accessdate = 2007-08-31}}</ref> During the battle Australian troops stormed, seized and held the key height of Mont Saint-Quentin (overlooking P<U+00E9>ronne), a pivotal German defensive position on the line of the Somme.

==Background==
The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] were pursuing the [[German Empire|Germans]], and the greatest obstacle to crossing the [[Somme River]] in pursuit was Mont Saint-Quentin which, situated in a bend of the river, dominated the whole position. The ''Mont'' was only 100 metres high but was a key to the German defence of the Somme line, and the last German stronghold. It overlooked the Somme River approximately 1.5 kilometres north of [[P<U+00E9>ronne, Somme|P<U+00E9>ronne]]. Its location made it an ideal observation point, and strategically, the hill's defences guarded the north and western approaches to the town.<ref>{{cite web  | year = 2005 | url = http://www.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/print.asp?id=1049 | title = The Battle for Mont St Quentin: 31 August 1918 <U+2013> 3 September 1918 | work =  | publisher = Penrith City Council Library Service, [[City of Penrith|Penrith City Council]]| accessdate = 2007-08-31 }}</ref>

==Battle==
[[File:MontStQuentinLeistAWMart02929.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Capture of Mont Saint Quentin'' painting by [[Fred Leist]] (1920)]] The offensive was planned by General [[John Monash]]; Monash planned a high-risk frontal assault which required the [[2nd Division (Australia)|Australian 2nd Division]] to cross a series of marshes to attack the heights. This plan failed when the assaulting troops could not cross the marshes. After this initial setback, Monash man<U+0153>uvred his divisions in the only free man<U+0153>uvre battle of any consequence undertaken by the Australians on the Western Front.<ref>Fidge, AC. 2003.

Australians of the Second Division crossed to the north bank of the Somme River on the evening of 30 August. At 5 am on 31 August 1918, supported by artillery, two Australian battalions, charged up Mont St Quentin.  The Germans quickly surrendered and the Australians continued to the main German trench-line. In the rear, other Australians crossed the Somme by a bridge which Australian engineers had saved and repaired. The Australians were unable to hold their gains on Mont St Quentin and German reserves regained the crest. However, the Australians held on just below the summit and next day it was recaptured and firmly held. On that day also, 1 September 1918, Australian forces broke into P<U+00E9>ronne and took most of the town. The next day it completely fell into Australian hands. In three days the Australians lost 3000 casualties but ensured a general German withdrawal eastwards back to the [[Hindenburg Line]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ww1westernfront.gov.au/battlefields/mont-st-quentin-peronne-1918.html|title = Mont St Quentin <U+2013> P<U+00E9>ronne 31 August <U+2013> 2 September 1918 |publisher = Australian Government: Department of Veterans' Affairs together with Board of Studies NSW| work = Australians on the Western Front 1914<U+2013>1918| date = 12 February 2008|accessdate = 2008-08-18}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
Looking back after the event, Monash accounted for the success by the wonderful gallantry of the men, the rapidity with which the plan was carried out, and the sheer daring of the attempt. In his ''Australian Victories in France'', Monash pays tribute to the commander of the 2nd Division, Major-general [[Charles Rosenthal]], who was in charge of the operation. But Monash and his staff were responsible for the conception of the project and the working out of the plans.<ref>Serle, Percival (1949).

The Allied victory at the Battle of Mont Saint Quentin dealt a strong blow to five German divisions, including the German elite [[2nd Guards Infantry Division (German Empire)|2nd Guards Division]]. As the position overlooked much of the terrain east of Mont St. Quentin, it guaranteed that the Germans would not be able to stop the allies west of the [[Hindenburg Line]] (the same position from which the Germans had launched their offensive in the spring). 2,600 prisoners were taken at a cost of slightly over 3,000 casualties.<ref name="diggerhistMStQ"/>

The following soldiers were awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for their role in the battle:
*[[Albert David Lowerson]], 21st Battalion, originally from [[Myrtleford, Victoria]]
*[[Robert MacTier]], 23rd Battalion, originally from [[Tatura, Victoria]]
*[[Edgar Thomas Towner]], 2nd Machine Gun Battalion, from [[Blackall, Queensland]]

All three men were with the Australian Second Division.
