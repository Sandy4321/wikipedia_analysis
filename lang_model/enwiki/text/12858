'''Royal Air Force Station Bircham Newton''' or more simply '''RAF Bircham Newton''' is a former [[Royal Air Force]] [[Royal Air Force station|station]] located {{Convert|2.1|mi}} south east of [[Docking, Norfolk|Docking]], [[Norfolk]] and {{Convert|13.4|mi}} north east of [[King's Lynn]], Norfolk, [[England]].

==History==

The site was first used during the [[First World War]] and received the largest British bomber of the time, the [[Handley Page V/1500]]. They would have carried out bombing missions against [[Berlin]] but the [[Armistice]] was arranged before any missions were actually flown.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=64}}

The airfield was equipped with one aircraft repair shed and three double bay general service sheds, although these had been demolished by 1937. It had two Belfast hangars, three C Type hangars, three Bellman hangars and ten Blister hangars.<ref name="CT">{{cite web|url=http://www.controltowers.co.uk/B/Bircham_Newton.htm |title=RAF Bircham Newton airfield|publisher=Control Towers|accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref>

It operated through the [[Second World War]] as part of [[No. 16 Group RAF]] as part of [[Coastal Command]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rafweb.org/Stations/Stations-B.htm|title=RAF Bircham Newton|publisher=Air of Authority - A History of RAF Organisation|accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref>

[[No. 206 Squadron RAF]] was one of the squadrons being based there, on maritime patrol duties.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=69}} Two satellite airfields, [[RAF Docking]]{{sfn|Bowyer|1979|p=61}} and [[RAF Langham]] were opened to accommodate units.{{sfn|Bowyer|1979|p=139}}

In 1965 the airfield was used for evaluation trials of the [[Hawker Siddeley Kestrel]] V/STOL aircraft.{{sfn|Bowyer|1979|p=68}}

==Current use==

After closure as an operational airfield in 1966, the airfield became the home of the [[Construction Industry Training Board]]. The runways have gone, but the majority of buildings on the site, including some hangars and the control tower, remain in use by the CITB.<ref>[http://airfieldarchaeology.fotopic.net/c1495033.html Airfield Archeology - Bircham Newton]</ref>The control tower was demolished in 2010 due to its poor condition.<ref name="CT"/>

Constructionarium is also based within the estate, providing a week's practical learning opportunity for undergraduates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionarium.co.uk/pages/where-is-it-held.php|title=Where is it held|publisher=Constructionarium|accessdate=1 February 2014}}</ref>
