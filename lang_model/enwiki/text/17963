{{otherships|USS Kanawha}}

The third '''USS ''Kanawha'' (AO-1)''' (originally Fuel Ship No. 13) was the first purpose-built [[replenishment oiler|oiler]] of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]]. She was laid down 8 December 1913 by the [[Mare Island Navy Yard]], [[Vallejo, California]]; launched 11 July 1914; sponsored by Miss Dorothy Bennett; and commissioned 5 June 1915, Lt. Comdr. Richard Werner, USNRF, in command.

''Kanawha'' cleared [[San Diego]] 9 June 1915 and arrived [[Newport, Rhode Island]], for service with the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]]. During the following year the oiler made seven trips to [[Port Arthur, Texas]], for fuel oil and gasoline. On 11 October 1916 ''Kanawha'' was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. Then, in addition to her fueling duties, she participated in tactical exercises, carried mail, and towed targets.

After America entered [[World War I]], the oiler was assigned to Commander, Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, as an escort for the first A.B.F. sent to [[France]]. ''Kanawha'' cleared [[New York]] 17 June 1917 and crossed the submarine-infested Atlantic, arriving [[St. Nazaire]] 2 July. She returned to New York 10 August for repairs before sailing again 23 September. The oiler cruised in Atlantic waters until 1 November supplying fuel oil to the cruiser force and escorting convoys to Europe. ''Kanawha'' returned to [[Philadelphia]] for repairs, then joined [[Naval Overseas Transportation Service|NOTS]] 8 January 1918. For the rest of the war, the oiler, ignoring torpedo warnings, carried fuel oil from [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] to [[United Kingdom]] and French ports. ''Kanawha'' arrived New York 1 May 1919 from her final cruise; she was detached from NOTS 12 May for reassignment to the Atlantic Fleet.

The oiler departed Port Arthur 24 July and arrived at [[San Pedro, California]] 9 August. From 1919 to 1929, ''Kanawha'', with the exception of three cruises to Port Arthur to supply units and ports along the Atlantic coast, operated in the Pacific. In addition to servicing ships, the oiler participated in the Army-Navy maneuvers in [[Hawaii]] during April 1925. She then accompanied the Battle Fleet on a goodwill cruise to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] before resuming coastal fueling operations 25 September 1925. ''Kanawha'' was decommissioned at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] 18 December 1929.

She was recommissioned 5 June 1934 and cleared [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]] 21 June for her base at San Pedro. For the following six years she cruised along the West Coast supplying oil and gasoline to ports in the [[Panama Canal Zone]], the [[Caribbean]], and Hawaii. In 1941 ''Kanawha'' widened her operations, sailing east to [[Midway Atoll|Midway]] and [[Wake Island]]s and as far north as [[Alaska]]. The oiler was at [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard|Mare Island]] undergoing overhaul at the time of the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]].

''Kanawha'' departed San Pedro 21 March 1942 with a convoy loaded with supplies for Hawaii. She continued convoy runs from [[California]] to Pearl Harbor until 18 May when she arrived [[Tongatapu]] for fueling operations in the South Pacific. Throughout the summer she cruised to [[New Caledonia]], [[Espiritu Santo]], and [[Efate]], providing fuel for destroyers and transports en route to the Pacific campaigns. The oiler departed [[Pago Pago]] 12 October and put into San Francisco 29 October for repairs and overhaul.

''Kanawha'' resumed fueling operations upon her return to Pago Pago 13 February 1943. For the next two months she serviced ships engaged in the struggle in the [[Solomon Islands]].

On 7 April a group of enemy [[Aichi D3A|Vals]] slipped through fighter defenses and zeroed in on ''Kanawha'' as she awaited an escort in [[Tulagi]] harbor. At 1502, shortly after clearing the harbor, the slow and vulnerable oiler came under bomb attack. The first five planes hit an oil tank under the bridge, causing fires to spread rapidly along the deck. Lt. Comdr. Bock ordered the ship abandoned to minimize danger to his crew from burning oil on the surface. After rescue operations were underway, volunteers returned on board and extinguished fires amidst exploding ammunition. The tug ''Rail'' towed ''Kanawha'' to the west side of Tulagi where she was beached shortly before midnight. However, she slid off into deep water and sank before daybreak 8 April. Nineteen of her crew were lost.

''Kanawha'' received one [[battle star]] for [[World War II]] service.
