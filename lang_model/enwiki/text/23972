'''The Order of the Stick''' ('''OOTS''') is a comedic [[webcomic]] that satirizes tabletop [[roleplaying games]] and medieval [[fantasy]] through the ongoing tale of the eponynmous fellowship of heroes. The comic is written and illustrated by [[Rich Burlew]], who creates the comic in a colorful [[stick figure]] style.

Taking place in a magical world that loosely operates by the rules of [[Editions of Dungeons  & Dragons#Dungeons & Dragons v3.5|3.5 edition]] ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', the comic follows the farcical exploits of six flawed adventurers as they strive to save the world from an evil [[lich]]. Much of the comic's humor stems from these characters either being aware of the game rules that affect their lives or having [[anachronism|anachronistic]] knowledge of modern culture, which in turn is often used by the author to [[parody]] various aspects of roleplaying games and fantasy fiction. While primarily comedic in nature, ''The Order of the Stick'' features a continuing storyline serialized in one- to four-page episodes, with over 650 such episodes released so far.

The award-winning comic is both a critical and popular success, having received strong praise from reviewers in the comic and roleplaying press on the basis of its plotting and character development while maintaining a place as one of the most widely-read of all webcomics. Although it is principally distributed online at the website ''Giant in the Playground'',<ref>http://www.giantitp.com/</ref> five book collections have been published, including two print-only stories (''On the Origin of PCs'' and ''Start of Darkness''). An alternate version of the strip also appeared monthly in [[Dragon (magazine)|''Dragon'' Magazine]] for 22 issues.

==History==
''The Order of the Stick'' began its run on September 30, 2003 on what was (at the time) Rich Burlew's personal site for gaming articles. Initially, the strip was intended to feature no plot whatsoever<U+2014>depicting an endless series of gags drawn from the D&D rules instead<U+2014>but Burlew quickly changed his mind, laying down the earliest hints of a storyline as early as strip #13.<ref name=DCFp20>Burlew, ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools'', Author Commentary, p. 20.</ref> The strip was originally produced simply to entertain those who arrived at the site for his articles, but it quickly became the most popular feature on the site (leading him to eventually abandon writing articles almost entirely).<ref name=DCFp5>Burlew, ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools'', Introduction, p. 5.</ref>

There have been several upgrades to the comic's art style, which is created directly on a computer using the [[vector graphics editor|vector-based software]] [[Adobe Illustrator]].<ref name=FAQ3>{{cite web|url=http://www.giantitp.com/FAQ.html#faq3 |title=How do you make the OOTS strips? |accessdate= 2008-04-12 |last=Burlew |first=Rich |authorlink=Rich Burlew |date=2005-03-04 |work=Giant in the Playground FAQ |publisher=GiantITP.com}}</ref> In strip #103, the curved and crooked [[Panel (comics)|panel]] borders (which Burlew has since questioned how he could ever have thought were acceptable) are replaced with straight<U+2014>though still slanted<U+2014>black lines.<ref name=oots0101 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Man-to-Man Chat |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0101.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2004 |issue=#101 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref><ref name=DCFp158>Burlew, ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools'', Author Commentary, p. 158.</ref> After he sprained his wrist in 2005, Burlew used some of the time he took off from the comic to improve the character designs of the main cast, straightening their lines and adding tiny details like the [[rune]]s stitched along the edge of Vaarsuvius' cloak.<ref name=NCPBp108/> These changes were humorously acknowledged by the characters themselves when they premiered.<ref name=oots0198 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=The Great Kazoo |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0198.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2005 |issue=#198 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref> Burlew also adjusted a number of the colors to reflect changes he had needed to make to the comics when they were first compiled for printing.<ref name=NCPBp108 /> The comic also features more frequent double- and even triple-page strips than in its early days, where longer strips were once reserved for special occasions (such as reaching #200). In addition to these permanent improvements to the art, there have been two variant art styles used, in both cases to distinguish the events of certain comics from those taking place in the story's present. Historical events relating to the plot have been portrayed in a hand-drawn [[crayon]] style both in the online comic and in ''Start of Darkness'',<ref name=oots0273 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=The Crayons of Time: Doodles on the Sketch Pad of Eternity |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0273.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2006 |issue=#273 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref><ref name=SODp36 group=n>Burlew, ''Start of Darkness'', p. 36.</ref> while events in both the "prequel" print-exclusive stories have been shown in black-and-white.

''The Order of the Stick'' has held several different update schedules through the years, beginning as a twice-weekly comic that debuted new strips on Mondays and Thursdays. When presales of the first ''OOTS'' compilation book allowed Burlew to make writing his full-time job, he increased the number to three-per-week.<ref name=GITPNews2/17/05>{{cite web|url=http://www.giantitp.com/index4.html#ZO077QwnU5SEfN09hcw |title=Do Quit Your Day Job |accessdate= 2008-04-12 |last=Burlew |first=Rich |authorlink=Rich Burlew |date=2005-02-17 |work= Giant in the Playground News |publisher=GiantITP.com}}</ref> Currently, however, the comic updates on a random schedule due to the author's ongoing health concerns.<ref name=GITPNews7/7/07>{{cite web|url=http://www.giantitp.com/index.html#yOSODsgTNhjraLs4GSe |title=An Important Announcement About OOTS |accessdate= 2008-04-12 |last=Burlew |first=Rich |authorlink=Rich Burlew |date=2007-07-07 |work= Giant in the Playground News |publisher=GiantITP.com}}</ref>

The ''Dragon'' version of ''OOTS'' featured the same main cast of six adventurers, but saw them adventuring in an unspecified underground location.

*The '''[[Monster in the Dark]]''': An enigmatic, childlike monster who was originally designated as Xykon's secret weapon. Redcloak and Right-eye rescued the Monster from a circus.   Although he is supposed to be the ultimate weapon at the disposal of the lich Xykon, he is terrified of practically everything, including the dark. Redcloak himself corrected Xykon on this matter by saying "Sir, he's about as scary as musty styrofoam". However, on the rare occassions he has actually used force he has indeed demonstrated incredible power, causing an earthquake by lightly stomping on the ground and smashing a high level paladin through a wall after hitting her 'as lightly as I can'.

*The '''[[Linear Guild]]''': An adventuring party comprised of "[[evil twin|evil opposites]]" to the Order, led by Elan's literal evil twin, '''Nale'''. While the Guild originally seeks a powerful magic artifact, its purpose turns solely toward defeating the Order after their first encounter with them. The Guild also includes '''Sabine''', a seductive shape-changing fiend and Nale's lover (evil opposite of Haley), and '''Thog''', a dim-witted [[half-orc]] [[Barbarian (Dungeons & Dragons)|barbarian]] (evil opposite of Roy). The other "evil opposites" vary, but are apparently picked out by the three main members specifically to fit the "evil opposite" theme.

==Plot synopsis==
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2008}}
[[Image:OOTS1withbkgd.png|thumb|right|''The Order of the Stick #1'' begins with the protagonists in the midst of a battle.]]
While the online version of ''The Order of the Stick'' unfolds continuously, the strips have been broken down into plot arcs for purposes of publishing them; the plot summary that follows breaks the story down into these arcs for clarity. The most recent strips, those which have yet to be compiled for print, have no title yet. Burlew notes in the commentary of ''War and XPs'' that the strips contained within that volume were the first to be plotted with publication in mind from the very beginning.<ref name=WAXPp5>Burlew, ''War and XPs'', Introduction, p. 5.</ref>

====Dungeon Crawlin' Fools====
The comic begins with the Order fighting [[Goblin (Dungeons & Dragons)|goblins]] and other monsters on their way through the Dungeon of Dorukan. They are led by [[Roy Greenhilt]] on a quest to destroy a [[lich]] sorcerer named [[Xykon]]. Roy is motivated by nightly visits from the ghost of his father, from whom he receives a cryptic warning. They then briefly join forces with an adventuring party known as the [[Linear Guild]], led by Nale (the [[evil twin]] of the Order's happy-go-lucky [[bard]], Elan). The Guild eventually betrays the Order, but the Order prevails due to Roy's sudden understanding of his father's earlier prophecy. The Order goes on to battle Xykon near a mysterious magical gate. Xykon shatters Roy's ancestral sword, but before he can release his ace-in-the-hole (a powerful monster shrouded in darkness), Roy flings him into a deadly mystic rune that protects the gate. Xykon's body is destroyed, but his disembodied soul is ferreted to safety by his lieutenant, the goblin cleric [[Redcloak]]. The book ends with Elan accidentally destroying the entire dungeon, including the gate, by activating another magic rune. The Order escapes to safety.<ref name=DCFTotal>Burlew, ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools''.</ref>

====No Cure for the Paladin Blues====
After a brief visit to a nearby village, the Order travel to Wooden Forest to retrieve rare "starmetal" to repair Roy's broken sword. After retrieving the metal along with treasure from a dragon's hoard, the party is arrested by the [[Paladin (Dungeons & Dragons)|paladin]] [[Miko Miyazaki]] for the capital crime of destroying the magical gate in the Dungeon of Dorukan. Roy persuades the party to comply with the arrest, and the group is led south to Miko's home in Azure City. While stopping at an inn, the party loses the dragon's treasure in an explosion, the shock of which renders the rogue [[Haley Starshine|Haley]] unable to speak coherently.

In Azure City, the Order is made to stand trial for the destruction of the gate, which Miko's liege Lord Shojo informs them is one of five gates that reinforce the structure of the universe. Without them, a god-killing abomination known as the Snarl would escape and destroy all of creation. Meanwhile, the party's violent halfling ranger [[Belkar Bitterleaf|Belkar]] kills a prison guard and escapes, leading Miko on a chase around the castle. The Order is ultimately acquitted with the help of Celia, a sylph they had aided in the Dungeon of Dorukan, and an enraged Miko swears to bring them to justice. Later, Shojo explains that the entire trial was a sham to get the Order's assistance in defending the remaining gates. Roy reluctantly agrees once he learns that his old foe Xykon has survived and is recruiting a massive army of [[Hobgoblin (Dungeons & Dragons)|hobgoblins]] to seize the remaining gates. Each member of the Order is given a boon by Lord Shojo as payment for their future aid: Roy's sword is repaired, and Belkar is released back into the Order's custody, although he receives a magical Mark of Justice to control his violent behavior.<ref name=NCPBTotal>Burlew, ''No Cure for the Paladin Blues''.</ref>

====War and XPs====
The party celebrates New Year's Eve, during which Roy begins a romantic relationship with Celia. The Order makes a brief diversion to Cliffport to confront the Linear Guild, during which Haley recovers her speech when she confesses her love for Elan. The Order returns to Azure City to ask Lord Shojo for further directions. Miko, who does not know about the plan to find the gates but does know about Xykon's army, overhears the conversation and jumps to the conclusion that both are in league with Xykon. She strikes her master down, and is immediately stripped of her paladin status by her gods and imprisoned.

The following day, Xykon's hobgoblins attack the city, with the Order helping Shojo's heir Hinjo hold the city walls. Xykon attempts to circumvent the defenders and seize the castle that holds the gate, but Roy leaps up to the [[Zombie (Dungeons & Dragons)|zombified]] dragon that Xykon is riding. The two duel once more, but Xykon overpowers Roy and sends him falling to his death. Xykon and Redcloak attempt to activate the gate hidden within the castle's throne room, and become locked in a losing battle with ghost-martyrs of the Sapphire Guard. Right before the villains are vanquished, Miko, having escaped from prison, destroys the gate in an attempt to protect it. In the ensuing explosion, Miko is killed, and Xykon and Redcloak escape. The city falls to the hobgoblins. Haley and Belkar become separated from the party when they go to recover Roy's corpse, while the others sail away with Hinjo and the surviving Azurites.<ref name=WAXPTotal>Burlew, ''War and XPs''.</ref>

====Current storyline====
Looking down from the Afterlife, Roy finds himself with his father, who cannot find rest until Xykon is gone. Roy is judged and found worthy of entrance to paradise, where he encounters his other dead relatives. He returns to his father's side when he learns that almost four months have passed, and looks down to see where his friends are (and why they have not raised him from the dead using clerical magic yet). He finds the Order still separated, with Haley and Belkar having formed an underground resistance movement in hobgoblin-occupied Azure City. When Haley accidentally summons Celia, the sylph convinces her to begin looking for the other half of the party. As they are traveling, Celia sneaks off into Greysky City, where she finds a necromancer; thinking he will resurrect Roy, she accidentally has him turn Roy into a [[List of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition monsters|bone golem]]. Haley, who is a former member of this town's Thieves' Guild and has a bad history with them, leads the group into the safehouse of one of her old friends, but he betrays them. In the ensuing battle, Belkar is healed of his Mark of Justice by a hired cleric, and Haley eventually defeats the leader of the Thieves' Guild.

In the meantime, Elan, Durkon, and Vaarsuvius have landed with Hinjo's fleet at an isolated island. They learn from a half-[[Orc (Dungeons & Dragons)|orc]] ninja named Therkla, who is attracted to Elan, that the nobleman Kubota is planning to assassinate Hinjo. Therkla is later arrested for her part in the conspiracy, and Kubota kills her to pin the blame on her. As he is escaping, however, Vaarsuvius kills him, flying away from the ship shortly thereafter to search for Haley.  On an island, s/he is attacked and defeated by the mother of the black dragon whom s/he had killed earlier.  The dragon threatens to kill Vaarsuvius' own children and escapes. To stop the dragon, Vaarsuvius contracts with fiends to rent out the souls of three evil wizards that will augment his/her own arcane power.  Vaarsuvius then kills the black dragon and its entire family, losing control of one of the souls shortly afterwards.

By various means, the Order is reunited in Greysky City, where Haley has negotiated with the Guild to retrieve Roy's body. Vaarsuvius teleports them back to Hinjo's fleet, where Durkon begins resurrecting Roy.  Vaarsuvius, loathe to waste the limited time he/she has with increased arcane power, teleports to Azure City to defeat Xykon once and for all.  However, he/she soon finds out that he/she is no match for the epic power of the lich ruler, and is knocked out, the last of the souls under his/her command fleeing. In the ensuing battle, O-Chul escapes from the prison to help Vaarsuvius, causing V to escape by casting Invisibility. O-Chul attacks Redcloak, causing him to flee while also losing Xykon's phylactery, when O-Chul is knocked out by the [[lich|lich]] while trying to destroy the phylactery.

==Fictional world==

The world the characters inhabit is similar to those depicted in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', complete with functional magic and monsters. According to an introductory strip included in ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools'', the world operates under three sets of laws: Physics, Magic, and Gaming (specifically, paper-and-pencil roleplaying).<ref name="DCFp8" group=n>Burlew, ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools', p. 8.</ref> Despite its ostensibly medieval nature, the ''OOTS'' world is rife with [[anachronism]]s, both social (such as college admissions standards for the Evil [[Ivy League]]<ref name=oots0100 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Teenage Boys Are CR 1 |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0100.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2004 |issue=#100 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref>) and technological (such as coffee makers<ref name=oots0317 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=The Best Part of Waking Up |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0317.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2006 |issue=#317 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref>). The characters make references to real-life individuals ([[Michael Jackson]]<ref name=oots0413 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Not to Scale |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0413.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2007 |issue=#413 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref> or [[Jessica Biel]]<ref name=oots0606 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=The Philosophy of Chaos |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0606.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2008 |issue=#606 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref>), fictional characters from other sources ([[Green Lantern]] and [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]),<ref name=oots0359 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Roll Over |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0359.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2006 |issue=#359 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref> or [[pop culture]] in general. Sometimes, fictional characters (or explicit "third-rate knock-offs" thereof) from other fantasy works cross paths with the main characters, such as the halfling Frudu.<ref name="DCFp8" group=n/><ref name=oots0415 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Idiot Box |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0415.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2007 |issue=#415 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref>

====Geography====
Three main areas of the world's geography have been mentioned: the Northern Lands, the Southern Lands,<ref name=oots0204 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=What's My Motivation? |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0204.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2005 |issue=#204 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref> and the Western Continent.<ref name=OTOPCp11 group=n/> The Northern Lands resemble medieval Europe in setting, but with a wider variety of skin colors than was present in medieval Europe. For example, [[Roy Greenhilt]] and his family have dark brown skin, and are not referred to as coming from a different area or having a different cultural background to the characters with light skin. Other characters, such as the lawyer Phil Rodriguez, show a third (light brown) skin color. Non-human races which are often player characters in ''D&D'', such as dwarves and gnomes, have both dark- and light-skinned members as well. The people of the Southern Lands are significantly different ethnically and culturally, with nations roughly analogous to real-world Asian cultures such as feudal Japan, China, and India. 
As most of the Western Continent has only been mentioned and not seen in the comic, it is unknown what its inhabitants might be like.  Vaarsuvius's homeland is apparently on the Western Continent, as are the ruins to where s/he teleported the Azurite fleet.

====Afterlife====
Like most of the worlds of ''Dungeons & Dragons'', the ''Order of the Stick'' universe contains a verifiable [[afterlife]]: a series of [[Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|planes]] to which dead souls are drawn. The afterlife in the ''OOTS'' world resembles the [[Outer plane|Great Wheel]] cosmology, with separate planes for the departed of each [[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignment]].<ref name=oots0445 group=n/> In order to enter the afterlife, however, a planar being must assess whether or not a soul has fulfilled the tenets of their alignment throughout their life.<ref name=oots0487 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Their Concierge Service is Heavenly |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0487.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2007 |issue=#487 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref>

The only afterlife plane that has been seen in the comic so far is the Northern Lands' Lawful Good afterlife, which is a mountain with seven plateaus loosely based on [[Mount Celestia]]. The first plateau is dedicated to satisfying physical desires, such as for sex and food, while higher levels offer spiritual satisfaction and the seventh level, at the mountain's peak, holds <U+201C>true perfect enlightenment.<U+201D><ref name=oots0493 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Led Zeppelin Lied to Us All |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0493.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2007 |issue=#493 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref> Below the mountain is a demiplane of blue skies and clouds, where dead souls, archons, and gods from all of the Good-aligned planes can look down on the mortal world.<ref name=oots0486 group=n>{{cite journal | last=Burlew | first=Rich | authorlink=Rich Burlew | url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0486.html | journal=The Order of the Stick | year=2007 | issue=#486 | accessdate=2008-10-05 | publisher=GiantITP.com | title=Next on "As the Plane Turns"...}}</ref>

==Commentary on role-playing games==
Much of humor of ''The Order of the Stick'' is heavily based on roleplaying games (specifically, the [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|''Dungeons and Dragons'' 3rd Edition]] ruleset), with characters freely discussing experience points, skill sets, and random encounters.<ref name="comixtalk" /> The characters know very well that they live in a world controlled by the rules of roleplaying games, but attempt to function normally within it, often with nonsensical results.<ref name="comixtalk" /><ref name="ComicBuyersGuide" /> Characters have been shown literally browsing through rulebooks for the D&D game to select a certain monster<ref name=oots0431 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=The Three Xykons |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0431.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2007 |issue=#431 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref> for use or to learn about a new class.<ref name=oots0390 group=n>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=In a Class All His Own |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0390.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2006 |issue=#390 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref> Common techniques of players and Dungeon Masters alike are also spoofed, such as the weather of the campaign world changing to herald a dramatic encounter<ref name="burns199" /> or a player who does not bother to complete the details of his character's backstory.<ref name=OTOPCp4>Burlew, ''On the Origin of PCs'', Introduction, p. 4.</ref> Burlew's satirical humor also addresses many of the clich<U+00E9>s of the fantasy genre as a whole, often by twisting them in new and different ways.<ref name="Rothfuss">[[Patrick Rothfuss|Rothfuss, Patrick]]. Foreward to ''War and XPs''. p. 3.</ref>

Burlew occasionally creates characters and situations specifically to highlight what he considers common problems and deficits among roleplayers. The controversial [[paladin]] [[Miko Miyazaki]] is one such character; Burlew has said that she represents the division among players of the game over whether or not one character should be allowed to "police" the remainder of an adventuring party.<ref name=NCPBp106>Burlew, ''No Cure for the Paladin Blues'', Author Commentary, p. 106.</ref> He also has referred to her as being "one of the WORST ways to play a paladin."<ref name=NCPBp108>Burlew, ''No Cure for the Paladin Blues'', Author Commentary, p. 108.</ref> Another example is the creation myth of the ''OOTS'' world, which shows a group of gods bickering over how to create the world<U+2014>accidentally creating the world-devouring Snarl through their refusal to compromise. In the commentary for ''No Cure for the Paladin Blues'', Burlew likens this story to the squabbles that might arise in a group of roleplayers, which threaten to destroy the fun that they have created together.<ref name=NCPBp180>Burlew, ''No Cure for the Paladin Blues'', Author Commentary, p. 180.</ref>

The comic occasionally also directly comments on current events in the roleplaying game industry by the inclusion of characters that represent the participants. In the last three comics to appear in ''Dragon'', the ''OOTS'' members encounter a green dragon that serves as a self-identified allegorical figure for the magazine itself,<ref name=Dragon357>{{cite journal | last = Burlew | first = Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew | year = 2007 | month = July | title = The Order of the Stick: Stop Dragon My Art Around | journal = Dragon | issue = 357 | publisher = [[Paizo Publishing|Paizo Publishing, LLC]].}}</ref> who then proceeds to recount the magazine's long history complete with representations of its various publishers, including a [[Wizards of the Coast|wizard of the coast]] and [[Mr. Potato Head]] (the signature toy of Wizards of the Coast's corporate parent, [[Hasbro]]).<ref name=Dragon358>{{cite journal | last = Burlew | first = Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew | year = 2007 | month = August | title = The Order of the Stick: Claw/Claw/Bite the Hand That Feeds Me | journal = Dragon | issue = 358 | publisher = [[Paizo Publishing|Paizo Publishing, LLC]].}}</ref> In the final issue, the dragon escapes the wizard of the coast's lawyers by flying through a room featuring characters from many of the comics that have appeared in ''Dragon'' over the years, such as ''[[David A. Trampier|Wormy]]'', ''[[Knights of the Dinner Table]]'', and ''[[What's New with Phil & Dixie]]'', before the ''OOTS'' characters directly thank the dragon for its long years of service.<ref name=Dragon359>{{cite journal | last = Burlew | first = Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew | year = 2007 | month = September | title = The Order of the Stick: End of the Line, Thanks for Riding | journal = Dragon | issue = 359 | publisher =[[Paizo Publishing|Paizo Publishing, LLC]].}}</ref> This theme was employed again when a character in the online strip voiced Burlew's eulogy to ''D&D'' co-creator [[Gary Gygax]] immediately after his death was announced.<ref name=oots0536>{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=A Brief Tribute |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0536.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2008 |issue=#536 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref><ref name=News3/4/2008>{{cite web|url=http://www.giantitp.com/index.html#AmQKTxMeXozCUZHVw0L |title=In Memorium: E.

==Publications==
[[Image:OOTS OTOPCsCover.jpeg|thumb|right|The cover of ''On The Origin of PCs'', the first of two ''OOTS'' prequel books.]]
''The Order of the Stick'' books are published by Giant in the Playground Games, a small press publishing company formed by ''OOTS'' creator [[Rich Burlew]]. The books are widely distributed to both online and brick-and-mortar retailers in the hobby game market,<ref>Greater Games Industry Catalog, Fall 2007, page 151.</ref><ref name=AllianceListing>{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance-games.com/publicaccess/results.asp?SearchArg=Giant+in+the+Playground+Games&list=By_Company |title=Company Listing for Giant in the Playground |accessdate=2008-04-22 |work=Alliance Game Disrtibutors Online Catalog |publisher=Alliance Game Distribution }}</ref> as well as to comic book direct retailers. All four books feature an introduction by the author, as well as a preface written in the voice of one of the characters from the strip. The compilation books also feature a number of pages of "bonus material", primarily additional strips inserted into various points in the story. The bonus material for ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools'', for example, includes an 9-page opening to the story that Burlew felt introduced the characters in a more organic way than the online comic's cast page.<ref name=DCFp5 />

==Board game==
[[Image:OOTSGame.gif|thumb|left|Box cover for ''The Order of the Stick Adventure Game''.]]In partnership with APE Games, Giant in the Playground released the first ''OOTS'' game, '''The Order of the Stick Adventure Game: The Dungeon of Dorukan'''. The game, which was released in September 2006, utilizes both cards and a board and has strong influences from games such as ''[[Talisman (board game)|Talisman]]'' and ''[[Dungeon!]]'', as well as the less known "Kings & Things".

''The Dungeon of Dorukan'' is designed for 2-6 people, aged twelve and older. Each player controls one member of the OOTS team to explore the dungeon and hunt down Xykon. The player is able to train their chosen member with a variety of [[shtick]] cards. Each character provides a different gaming experience, but the players always have the ability to either aid or harm their team mates.

A second, stand-alone game, '''The Order of the Stick Adventure Game: The Linear Guild''', is set to be released by APE Games in the Fall of 2008.<ref name="GTS" /> Players will be able to take on the parts of Nale, Thog, Sabine, and other members of the [[Linear Guild]] in their own dungeon adventure, or they can combine the materials in the game with those from the Dungeon of Dorukan set for a massive Order of the Stick vs. Linear Guild head-to-head adventure.
