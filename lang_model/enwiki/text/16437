'''Canon 915''', one of the canons of the current [[Canon law (Catholic Church)#Codification|Code of Canon Law]], forbids the administration of [[Holy Communion]] to those upon whom the penalty of [[excommunication]] or interdict<ref>On interdict, see [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P4V.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1332]</ref> has been imposed or declared or who persist in manifest grave sin. While canon 1331 <U+00A7>1 forbids an excommunicated person, even one who has incurred excommunication only ''lata sententia'' (automatically), from receiving Holy Communion, it is to the minister of Holy Communion, not the excommunicated person, that canon 915 is directed.<ref>"Those upon whom the penalty of excommunication or interdict has been imposed or declared, and others who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin, are not to be admitted to holy communion" ([http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P38.HTM English translation of canon 915]).</ref>

==Juridical context==
''Latae sententiae'' (automatic) excommunication, such as that incurred, according to [[canon 1398]],<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P55.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1398]</ref> by someone who actually procures an [[abortion]], is unrelated to canon 915, unless an [[Ordinary]] or an [[ecclesiastical court]], having taken note of the commission of this offence and giving the accused the right to defend against the charges, issues a decree that the person involved has indeed incurred excommunication. Someone who has incurred a non-declared automatic  excommunication is forbidden to receive Holy Communion,<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P4V.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1331 <U+00A7>1]</ref> but this obligation directly affects the excommunicated person, while the obligation that canon 915 imposes concerns instead those in charge of distributing Holy Communion.

For this reason, canon 915 does not apply to those members of the Diocese of Lincoln who by decree of the diocesan bishop [[Fabian Bruskewitz]] are under automatic interdict or excommunication because of membership of certain associations,<ref>In 1996, American bishop [[Fabian Bruskewitz]] gained national attention (see [http://sfbayc.org/magazine/html/sfbay__today_show_interview_-_.htm The Televised Today Show Interview Segment]) for imposing automatic excommunication on local Catholics who persist in being members of several problematic associations which he declared to be "totally incompatible with the Catholic Faith", and which included [[Planned Parenthood]] and its affiliate [[Catholics for a Free Choice]] ([http://sfbayc.org/magazine/html/sfbay_catholic__nebraska_excom.htm SFBay Catholic: Current Issues In Catholicism]). His decree was appealed to Rome, but in 2006 was upheld by the [[Congregation for Bishops]] ([http://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/otr.cfm?id=3974&repos=6&subrepos=4&searchid=395450 The Call Stands: Runner is Out], [http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=48072 "Vatican confirms excommunication for US dissident group']).</ref> since 

==Alleged applicability to pro-choice politicians==
Canon 915 has been invoked by opponents of abortion as applicable to the giving of Holy Communion to Roman Catholic politicians who have voiced support for artificial [[birth control]] and [[sexual liberation]],<ref>[http://www.canon915.org/ Canon915.org]</ref> if those politicians persist in what the opponents of abortion consider to be manifest grave sin.

Archbishop [[Raymond Burke]], who is the current Prefect of the [[Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura]], has written extensively on the subject and has argued in favour of a more rigid observance of the canon by ministers of Holy Communion in the case of Catholic politicians who publicly, after admonition, continue to support legislation favouring procured abortion and other legislation contrary to the natural moral law.<ref>[http://www.therealpresence.org/eucharst/holycom/denial.htm "Canon 915: The Discipline Regarding the Denial of Holy Communion to Those Obstinately Persevering in Manifest Grave Sin," in Periodica, 96 (2007) 3-58]</ref>

Unrelated are cases of Catholic politicians who have at some time advocated or voted for legalization of procured abortion, but who are not seen to be obstinately persisting in grave sin.

===Notable cases===

====Joe Biden====
After his selection as a vice presidential candidate, Biden was criticized by his own [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington]] Bishop [[Michael Angelo Saltarelli]] over his stance on abortion, which goes against the church's pro-life beliefs and teachings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/sep/08090212.html |title=Scranton Bishop Says He will Refuse Communion to Joseph Biden |publisher=Lifesitenews.com |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref>  The diocese confirmed that even if elected vice president, Biden would not be allowed to speak at Catholic schools.<ref name="ce082808">{{cite news | url=http://www.catholicexchange.com/2008/08/28/113619/ | title=Biden<U+2019>s Bishop Will not Permit Him, Even if Elected VP, to Speak at Catholic Schools | author=Westen, John-Henry | publisher=''[[Catholic Exchange]]'' | date=2008-08-28 | accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref>  Biden was soon barred from receiving [[Holy Communion]] by the bishop of his original hometown of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], because of his support for abortion rights;<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Kirkpatrick |title=Abortion Issue Again Dividing Catholic Votes  |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/us/politics/17catholics.html?bl&ex=1221883200&en=1e3acb5115249581&ei=5087%0A |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2008-09-16 |accessdate=2008-09-19 }}</ref> however, Biden did continue to receive Communion at his local Delaware parish.<ref name="ce082808"/>  Scranton became a flash point in the competition for swing state Catholic voters between the Democratic campaign and liberal Catholic groups, who stressed that other social issues should be considered as much or more than abortion, and many bishops and conservative Catholics, who maintained abortion was paramount.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/us/politics/05catholic.html | title=A Fight Among Catholics Over Which Party Best Reflects Church Teachings | author=Kirkpatrick, David D. | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=2008-10-04 | accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref> Biden said he believed that life began at conception but that he would not impose his personal religious views on others.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Phillips |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=As a Matter of Faith, Biden Says Life Begins at Conception |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/us/politics/08campaign.html?ref=us |work= |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=September 7, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-07 }}</ref> Bishop Saltarelli had previously stated regarding stances similar to Biden's: "No one today would accept this statement from any public servant: <U+2018>I am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena.<U+2019> Likewise, none of us should accept this statement from any public servant: <U+2018>I am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena.'"<ref name="ce082808"/>

====John Kerry====
A [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], Kerry was said to carry a [[rosary]], a prayer book, and a [[St. Christopher]] medal (the patron saint of travellers) when he campaigned. However, while Kerry is personally against [[abortion]], he supports a woman's right to have one, which puts him at odds with the [[Catholic Church]]. Similar tension exists between the Church and several other Catholic national political figures, including [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[George Pataki]], [[Nancy Pelosi]], [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Tom Vilsack]] (one of his possible vice-presidential choices in the [[2004 election]]), [[Joe Biden]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Discussing his faith, Kerry said, "I thought of being a priest. I was very religious while at school in Switzerland. I was an altar boy and prayed all the time. I was very centered around the Mass and the church." He also said that the [[Pauline epistles|Letters of Paul]] moved him the most, stating that they taught him to "not feel sorry for myself."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/150/story_15043_1.html |title=John Kerry's Spiritual Biography |last=Caldwell |first=Deborah}}</ref>

====Kathleen Sebelius====
[[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]] [[Archbishop]] [[Joseph Fred Naumann|Joseph Naumann]] asked that Sebelius no longer receive [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] because of her position on abortion. Naumann criticized Sebelius for vetoing HS SB 389.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=Sadowski |title=Archbishop Naumann: Kansas governor should stop receiving Communion |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0802605.htm |work=Catholic News Service |publisher=U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops |date=May 12, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-11 |quote=[Naumann] said many Kansans "find it more than an embarrassment" that the state had become "infamous for being the late-term abortion center for the Midwest." }}</ref>  The action received mixed reviews in the Catholic press.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rigid bishops one-up the popes |url=http://ncronline3.org/drupal/?q=node/1110 |work=National Catholic Reporter |date=May 30, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Whelon |title=Conservatives gear up again to use Communion as a political weapon,, no matter the cost to American Catholicism |url=http://www.catholicdemocrats.org/news/2008/05/conservatives_gear_up_again_to.php |work=Catholic Democrats |date=May 14, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Catholic Governor Sebelius Corrected |url=http://www.catholic.org/politics/story.php?id=27933 |work=National Catholic Register |date=May 13, 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Archbishop asks Kansas governor to refrain from Communion for abortion support, awaits response |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=12619 |work=Catholic News Agency |date=May 12, 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref>

====Nancy Pelosi====
Peter Vere, professor of Canon Law at Catholic Distance University and the author of "Surprised by Canon Law: 150 Questions Laypeople Ask about Canon Law", said that Pelosi's pastor would be in violation of canon 915, if he allowed her to receive communion.<!-- Canon 915 applies to the person who gives communion, not to the person receiving communion.--> <ref>[http://www.cnsnews.com/public/Content/Article.aspx?rsrcid=43884 Catholic Group Petitions Pope to Excommunicate Nancy Pelosi]</ref>
