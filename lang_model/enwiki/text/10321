The '''Communist Party USA''' ('''CPUSA''') is a [[Marxist-Leninist]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Constitution of the Communist Party USA |year=2001}}</ref> political party in the [[United States]], established in 1919.  It has a long, complex history that is closely related to the histories of similar communist parties worldwide and the [[Communists in the U.S. Labor Movement (1919<U+2013>1937)|U.S. labor movement]].

For the first half of the 20th century, the CPUSA was the largest and most influential [[communist party]] in the United States. It [[Communists in the U.S. Labor Movement (1919<U+2013>1937)|played a prominent role]] in the U.S. labor movement from the 1920s through the 1940s, having a major hand in founding most of the country's first [[industrial unions]] (which would later use the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] to expel their Communist members) while also becoming known for [[The Communist Party and African-Americans|opposing racism]] and fighting for integration in workplaces and communities during the height of the [[Jim Crow]] period of U.S. [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]]. Historian [[Ellen Schrecker]] concludes that decades of recent scholarship<ref>She mentions James Barrett, Maurice Isserman, Robin D. G. Kelley, Randi Storch, and Kate Weigand</ref> offers a "nuanced portrayal of the party as both a Stalinist sect tied to a vicious regime and the most dynamic organization within the American Left during the 1930s and '40s".<ref>Ellen Schrecker, "Soviet Espionage in America: An Oft-Told tale", ''Reviews in American History'', Volume 38, Number 2, June 2010 p. 359</ref> In regards to the former charge, the CPUSA, claiming [[proletarian internationalism]] (while the U.S. Government called it espionage), sponsored an elaborate intelligence network on behalf of the Soviet Union, involving over 500 members acting as agents. The most prominent example dealt with the [[Manhattan Project]] in which the network was accused in giving the blueprints of the atomic bomb to the Soviets; [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] were thereafter convicted and executed as the chief architects of this plan. Subsequent examination of the trial record shows that while Julius was certainly guilty, some of the evidence against Ethel was conflicted and possibly false.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/15/weekinreview/nation-rosenbergs-50-years-later-yes-they-were-guilty-but-what-exactly.html?ref=juliusrosenberg | work=The New York Times | first=Sam | last=Roberts | title=The Nation: The Rosenbergs, 50 Years Later; Yes, They Were Guilty. But of What Exactly? | date=June 15, 2003}}</ref>

By August 1919, only months after its founding, the CPUSA had 60,000 members, including anarchists and other [[Far left|radical leftists]], while the more moderate [[Socialist Party of America]] had only 40,000 members. The sections of the CP's [[International Workers Order]] meanwhile organized for communism around linguistic and ethnic lines, providing [[Benefit society|mutual aid]] and tailored cultural activities to an IWO membership that peaked at 200,000 at its height.

But the CP's early labor and organizing successes did not last. As the decades progressed, the combined effects of the [[Red Scare|second Red Scare]], [[McCarthyism]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1956 [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]] denouncing the previous decades of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s rule, and the adversities of the continued [[Cold War]] mentality, steadily weakened the Communist Party's internal structure and confidence. CPUSA's membership in the [[Comintern]] and its close adherence to the political positions of the Soviet Union enabled anti-communist critics to constantly present the party as not only a threatening, subversive domestic entity, but also as a "foreign" agent fundamentally alien to the "American way of life". Internal and external crises swirled together, to the point where members who did not end up in prison for party activities tended either to disappear quietly from its ranks or to adopt more moderate political positions at odds with the CPUSA's [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. By 1957, membership had dwindled to less than 10,000, of whom some 1,500 were FBI informants.<ref>Gentry, Kurt, J. Edgar Hoover: The Man and the Secrets. W. W. Norton & Company 1991. P. 442. ISBN 0-393-02404-0.</ref>

The party attempted to recover with its opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] during the U.S. [[Civil rights movement]] in the 1960s, but the continued uncritical support of the CPUSA for an increasingly stultified and militaristic [[Soviet Union]] increasingly alienated them from the rest of the U.S. left, who saw this supportive position as outdated and even dangerous. At the same time, the party's aging membership demographics and noticeably hollow calls for "[[peaceful coexistence]]" failed to speak to a [[New Left#United States|new Left in the United States]]. 

With the rise of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and his effort to radically alter the Soviet economic and political system from the mid-1980s, the CPUSA finally became estranged from the leadership of the Soviet Union itself; the USSR cut off major funding to the CPUSA in 1989 due to the CP's opposition to [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]. With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the party held its convention and attempted to resolve the issue of whether the Party should reject [[Marxism-Leninism]]. The majority reasserted the party's now purely Marxist outlook, prompting [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism|a minority faction]] which urged [[Social Democracy|social democrats]] to exit the now reduced party. The party has since adopted Marxism-Leninism within its program.<ref>{{cite book |title=Constitution of the Communist Party USA |year=2001}}</ref>  

The CPUSA is based in New York City. For decades, its West Coast newspaper was the ''[[People's World]]'', and its East Coast newspaper was ''[[The Daily World]].''<ref>''Yates v. United States'', 354 U.S. 298 (1957) http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0354_0298_ZD.html</ref>  The two newspapers merged in 1986. ''[[Political Affairs Magazine]]'' is a monthly magazine.  [[International Publishers]] is its publishing house.

==History==
===Formation and early history (1919<U+2013>1921)===
[[Image:Wagenknecht-a-1918.jpg|thumb|right|Executive Secretary of the Communist Labor Party [[Alfred Wagenknecht]].]]
{{See also|Communist Labor Party}}
The first US socialist political party was the Socialist Labor Party, formed in 1876 and for many years a viable force in the international socialist movement. By the mid 1890s, however, the SLP came under the influence of [[Daniel De Leon]], and his radical views led to widespread discontent amongst the members, leading to the formation of the reformist-oriented Socialist Party of America around the turn of the 20th century. A left wing gradually emerged within the SP, much to the consternation of many Party leaders.

In January 1919, Vladimir Lenin invited the left wing of the Socialist Party of America to join Comintern. During the spring of 1919 the Left Wing Caucus of the Socialist Party, buoyed by a large influx of new members from countries involved in the Russian Revolution, prepared to wrest control from the smaller controlling faction of moderate socialists. A referendum to join Comintern passed with 90% support, but the incumbent leadership suppressed the results. Elections for the party's National Executive Committee resulted in 12 leftists being elected out of a total of 15. Calls were made to expel moderates from the party. The moderate incumbents struck back by expelling several state organizations, half a dozen [[language federations]], and many locals, in all two-thirds of the membership.

The Socialist Party then called an emergency convention on August 30, 1919. The party's Left Wing Caucus made plans at a June conference of its own to regain control of the party, by sending delegations from the sections of the party that had been expelled to the convention to demand that they be seated. However, the language federations, eventually joined by [[Charles Ruthenberg|C.E. Ruthenberg]] and [[Louis C. Fraina]], turned away from that effort and formed their own party, the Communist Party of America, at a separate convention on September 1, 1919.  Meanwhile plans led by [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] and [[Benjamin Gitlow]] to crash the Socialist Party convention went ahead. Tipped off, the incumbents called the police, who obligingly expelled the leftists from the hall. The remaining leftist delegates walked out and, meeting with the expelled delegates, formed the [[Communist Labor Party]] on August 30, 1919.<ref name="Buhle, 1987"/>{{page needed|date=November 2010}}

The Comintern was not happy with two communist parties and in January, 1920 dispatched an order that the two parties, which consisted of about 12,000 members, merge under the name United Communist Party, and to follow the party line established in Moscow. Part of the Communist Party of America under the leadership of Charles Ruthenberg and [[Jay Lovestone]] did this but a [[faction (communist)|faction]] under the leadership of Nicholas I. Hourwich and [[Alexander Bittelman]] continued to operate independently as the Communist Party of America. A more strongly worded directive from the Comintern eventually did the trick and the parties were merged in May, 1921. Only five percent of the members of the newly formed party were native English-speakers. Many of the members came from the ranks of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]].<ref name="Buhle, 1987">Buhle, ''Marxism in the USA: From 1870 to the Present Day'' (1987)</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2010}}<ref>Fraser M. Ottanelli, ''The Communist party of the United States: from the depression to World War II'' (1991) p. 10</ref>

===The Red Scare and the communist party (1919<U+2013>1923)===

From its inception, the Communist Party USA came under attack from state and federal governments and later the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].  In 1919, after a series of unattributed bombings and attempted assassinations of government officials, and judges (later traced to militant ''Galleanist'' adherents of radical anarchist [[Luigi Galleani]]), the [[US Department of Justice]] headed by Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]], acting under the [[Sedition Act of 1918]], began arresting thousands of foreign-born party members, many of whom the government deported. The Communist Party was forced underground and took to the use of pseudonyms and secret meetings in an effort to evade the authorities.

The party apparatus was to a great extent underground. It re-emerged in the last days of 1921 as a legal political party called the [[Workers Party of America]]. As the [[Second Red Scare|red scare]] and deportations of the early 1920s ebbed, the party became bolder and more open. An element of the party, however, remained permanently underground and came to be known as the "CPUSA secret apparatus."

During this time, immigrants from Eastern Europe are said to have played a very prominent role in the CPUSA.<ref name="(Klehr 1978, p. 37ff).">Klehr, Harvey. ''Communist cadre: The social background of the American Communist party <U+00E9>lite. Stanford, California: Hoover Institution Press.</ref> A majority of the members of the Socialist Party were immigrants and an "overwhelming" percentage of the CPUSA consisted of recent immigrants.<ref name="(Glazer 1961, p. 38 p. 40).">Glazer, Nathan ''The Social Basis of American Communism.</ref>

===The factional war (1923<U+2013>1929)===
[[Image:Ruthenberg-c-e.jpg|right|thumb|Executive Secretary C.E. Ruthenberg, 1924.]]

Now that the above ground element was legal, the communists decided that their central task was to develop roots within the working class. This move away from hopes of revolution in the near future to a more nuanced approach was accelerated by the decisions of the Fifth World Congress of the Comintern held in 1925. The Fifth World Congress decided that the period between 1917 and 1924 had been one of revolutionary upsurge, but that the new period was marked by the stabilization of capitalism and that revolutionary attempts in the near future were to be stopped. The American communists embarked then on the arduous work of locating and winning allies. 

That work was, however, complicated by factional struggles within the CPUSA. The party quickly developed a number of more or less fixed factional groupings within its leadership: a faction around the party's Executive Secretary C.E. Ruthenberg, which was largely organized by his supporter [[Jay Lovestone]]; and the Foster-Cannon faction, headed by [[William Z. Foster]], who headed the Party's [[Trade Union Educational League]], and [[James P. Cannon]], who led the International Labor Defense (ILD) organization.<ref>Ottanelli, ''The Communist Party of the United States: from the Depression to World War II'' (1991) p 13</ref>  

Foster, who had been deeply involved in the [[Steel Strike of 1919]] and had been a long-time [[syndicalist]] and a Wobbly, had strong bonds with the progressive leaders of the [[Chicago Federation of Labor]] and, through them, with the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)]] and nascent farmer-labor parties. Under pressure from the Comintern, however, the party broke off relations with both groups in 1924. In 1925 the Comintern, through its representative [[Sergei Gusev]], ordered the majority Foster faction to surrender control to Ruthenberg's faction; Foster complied. The factional infighting within the CPUSA did not end, however; the Communist leadership of the New York locals of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] lost the 1926 strike of cloakmakers in New York City in large part because of intra-party factional rivalries.<ref>Ottanelli, ''The Communist party of the United States: from the depression to World War II'' (1991) p 125</ref>  

Ruthenberg died in 1927 and his ally, Lovestone, succeeded him as party secretary. Cannon attended the Sixth Congress of the Comintern in 1928, hoping to use his connections with leading circles within it to regain the advantage against the Lovestone faction. However Cannon and [[Maurice Spector]] of the [[Communist Party of Canada]] were accidentally given a copy of [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'s "Critique of the Draft Program of the Comintern", that they were instructed to read and return. Persuaded by its contents, they came to an agreement to return to America and campaign for the document's positions. A copy of the document was then smuggled out of the country in a child's toy.<ref>Palmer, Bryan D., [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/56/palmer.html "Maurice Spector, James P. Cannon, and the Origins of Canadian Trotskyism"]. ''Labour/Le Travail''.56 (2005): 72 pars.

However, as this attempt to develop a [[Left Opposition]] came to light, they and their supporters were expelled. Cannon and his followers organized the [[Communist League of America]] as a section of Trotsky's [[International Left Opposition]].

At the same Congress, Lovestone had impressed the leadership of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] as a strong supporter of [[Nikolai Bukharin]], the general secretary of the Comintern. This was to have unfortunate consequences for Lovestone when, in 1929, Bukharin was on the losing end of a struggle with Stalin and was purged from his position on the [[Politburo]] and removed as head of the Comintern. In a reversal of the events of 1925, a Comintern delegation sent to the United States demanded that Lovestone resign as party secretary, in favor of his archrival Foster, despite the fact that Lovestone enjoyed the support of the vast majority of the American party's membership. Lovestone traveled to the Soviet Union and appealed directly to the Comintern. Stalin informed Lovestone that he "had a majority because the American Communist Party until now regarded you as the determined supporter of the Communist International. And it was only because the Party regarded you as friends of the Comintern that you had a majority in the ranks of the American Communist Party."<ref>Theodore Draper, ''American Communism and Soviet Russia'' (2003) p. 419</ref>

When Lovestone returned to the United States, he and his ally [[Benjamin Gitlow]] were purged despite holding the leadership of the party. Ostensibly, this was not due to Lovestone's insubordination in challenging a decision by Stalin, but for his support for [[American Exceptionalism]], the thesis that socialism could be achieved peacefully in the USA. Lovestone and Gitlow formed their own group called the "Communist Party (Opposition)", a section of the pro-Bukharin [[International Communist Opposition]], which was initially larger than the [[Trotskyist]]s but failed to survive past 1941. Lovestone had initially called his faction the "Communist Party (Majority Group)" in the expectation that the majority of the CPUSA's members would join him, but only a few hundred people joined his new organization.

===The Third Period (1928<U+2013>1935)===

The upheavals within the CPUSA in 1928 were an echo of a much more significant change: Stalin's decision to break off any form of collaboration with western socialist parties, which were now condemned as "social fascists." This policy had particularly severe consequences in Germany, where the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] not only refused to work in alliance with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic Party]], but attacked it and its members.

The impact of this policy in the U.S. was counted in membership figures. In 1928 there were about 24,000 members.  By 1932 the total had fallen to 6,000 members.<ref>Ottanelli, ''The Communist Party of the United States: from the Depression to World War II'' (1991) p. 43</ref> 

Opposing Stalin's [[Third Period]] policies in the Communist Party USA was [[James P. Cannon]].  For this action, he was expelled from the party.  He then founded the [[Communist League of America]] with [[Max Shachtman]] and [[Martin Abern]], and started publishing ''[[The Militant]]''.  It declared itself to be an external faction of the Communist Party until, as the Trotskyists saw it, Stalin's policies in Germany helped Hitler take power.  At that point they started working towards the founding of a new international, the [[Fourth International]].

In the United States the principal impact of the Third Period was to end the CPUSA's efforts to organize within the AFL through the Trade Union Educational League and to turn its efforts into organizing [[Dual unionism|dual unions]] through the [[Trade Union Unity League]]. Foster went along with this change, even though it contradicted the policies he had fought for previously.

By 1930, the party adopted the title of Communist Party of the USA, with the slogan of "the united front from below". The Party devoted much of its energy in the [[Great Depression]] to organizing the unemployed, attempting to found "red" unions, championing the rights of African-Americans and fighting evictions of farmers and the working poor.<ref>Ottanelli, ''The Communist Party of the United States'', ch 2<U+2013>3</ref> At the same time, the Party attempted to weave its sectarian revolutionary politics into its day-to-day defense of workers, usually with only limited success. They recruited more disaffected members of the Socialist Party and an organization of African-American socialists called the [[African Blood Brotherhood]], some of whose members, particularly [[Harry Haywood]], would later play important roles in communist work among blacks.

In 1932, the retiring head of the CPUSA, [[William Z. Foster]], published a book entitled ''[[Toward Soviet America]]'', which laid out the Communist Party's plans for revolution and the building of a new socialist society based on the model of Soviet Russia.  In that same year [[Earl Browder]] became General Secretary of the Party.  At first Browder moved the party closer to Soviet interests, and helped to develop its secret apparatus or underground network. He also assisted in the recruitment of espionage sources and agents for the Soviet [[NKVD]]. Browder's own younger sister Margerite was an NKVD operative in Europe until removed from those duties at Browder's request.<ref name="ryan172">{{Harvnb|Ryan|1997|p=172}}</ref>  It was at this point that the CPUSA's foreign policy platform came under the complete control of Stalin, who enforced his directives through his secret police and foreign intelligence service, the NKVD. The NKVD controlled the secret apparatus of the CPUSA, including responsibility for political murders, kidnappings, and assassinations.<ref>James G. Ryan, "Socialist Triumph as a Family Value: Earl Browder and Soviet Espionage," ''American Communist History'' 1, no. 2 (December 2002)</ref><ref>John E. Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Fridrikh I. Igorevich, ''The Secret World of American Communism,'' (Yale University Press, 1995)</ref>

===The Popular Front (1935<U+2013>1939)===

[[Image:Earl Browder.jpg|thumb|right|CPUSA General Secretary [[Earl Browder]]]]
The ideological rigidity of the third period began to crack, however, with two events: the election of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as president of the United States in 1932 and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power in Germany in 1933. Roosevelt's election and the passage of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] in 1933  sparked a tremendous upsurge in union organizing in 1933 and 1934. While the party line still favored creation of autonomous revolutionary unions, party activists chose to fold up those organizations and follow the mass of workers into the AFL unions they had been attacking.

The Seventh Congress of the Comintern made the change in line official in 1935, when it declared the need for a ''[[popular front]]'' of all groups opposed to fascism. The CPUSA abandoned its opposition to the New Deal and provided many of the organizers for the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]].

The party also sought unity with forces to its right. [[Earl Russell Browder]] offered to run as [[Norman Thomas]]' [[running mate]] on a joint Socialist Party-Communist Party ticket in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1936|1936 presidential election]] but Thomas rejected this overture.

The gesture did not mean that much in practical terms, since the CPUSA was, by 1936, effectively supporting Roosevelt in much of his trade union work. While continuing to run its own candidates for office, the CPUSA pursued a policy of representing the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] as the lesser evil in elections.

Party members also rallied to the defense of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] during this period after a Nationalist military uprising moved to overthrow it, resulting in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939). The CPUSA, along with leftists throughout the world, raised funds for medical relief while many of its members made their way to Spain with the aid of the party to join the [[Lincoln Brigade]], one of the [[International Brigades]]. Among its other achievements, the Lincoln Brigade was the first American military force to include blacks and whites integrated on an equal basis.

Intellectually, the [[Popular Front]] period saw the development of a strong communist influence in intellectual and artistic life. This was often through various organizations influenced or controlled by the Party or, as they were pejoratively known, "[[communist front|fronts]]."

The CPUSA under Browder supported Stalin's [[show trials]] in the Soviet Union, called the [[Moscow Trials]].<ref name="ryan154">{{Harvnb|Ryan|1997|p=154}}</ref>  Therein, between August 1936 and mid-1938 the Soviet government indicted, tried, and shot virtually all of the remaining [[Old Bolsheviks]].<ref name="ryan154"/> Beyond the show trials lay a broader purge, the [[Great Purge]], that killed millions.<ref name="ryan154"/> Browder uncritically supported Stalin, likening [[Trotskyism]] to "cholera germs" and calling the purge "a signal service to the cause of progressive humanity."<ref name="ryan155">{{Harvnb|Ryan|1997|p=155}}</ref> He compared the show trial defendants to domestic traitors [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Aaron Burr]], disloyal War of 1812 Federalists, and Confederate secessionists, while likening persons who "smeared" Stalin's name to those who had slandered Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt.<ref name="ryan155"/>

In allegiance to the Soviet Union, the party changed this policy again after [[Adolf Hitler]] broke the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact by [[Operation Barbarossa|attacking the Soviet Union]] on June 22, 1941.

Throughout the rest of World War II, the CPUSA continued a policy of militant, if sometimes bureaucratic, trade unionism while opposing strike actions at all costs. The leadership of the CPUSA was among the most vocal pro-war voices in the United States, advocating unity against fascism, supporting the prosecution of leaders of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] under the newly enacted [[Smith Act]],<ref>[[John Earl Haynes]].

Prominent CPUSA members and supporters, such as [[Dalton Trumbo]] and [[Pete Seeger]], recalled anti-war material they had previously released.

Earl Browder expected the wartime coalition between the Soviet Union and the west to bring about a prolonged period of social harmony after the war. In order better to integrate the communist movement into American life the party was officially dissolved in 1944 and replaced by a "Communist Political Association".

That harmony proved elusive, however, and the international Communist movement swung to the left after the war ended. Browder found himself isolated when a [[Duclos letter|critical letter]] from the leader of the [[French Communist Party]] received wide circulation. As a result of this, in 1945 he was retired and replaced by [[William Z. Foster]], who would remain the senior leader of the party until his own retirement in 1958.

In line with other Communist parties worldwide, the CPUSA also swung to the left and, as a result, experienced a brief period in which a number of internal critics argued for a more leftist stance than the leadership was willing to countenance. The result was the expulsion of a handful of "premature anti-revisionists".

More important for the party was the renewal of state persecution of the CPUSA. The [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] administration's loyalty oath program, introduced in 1947, drove some leftists out of federal employment and, more importantly, legitimized the notion of Communists as subversives, to be exposed and expelled from public and private employment. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], whose hearings were perceived as forums where current and former Communists and those sympathetic to Communism were compelled under the duress of the ruin of their careers to confess and name other Communists, made even brief affiliation with the CPUSA or any related groups grounds for public exposure and attack, inspiring local governments to adopt loyalty oaths and investigative commissions of their own. Private parties, such as the motion picture industry and self-appointed watchdog groups, extended the policy still further. This included the still controversial [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklist of actors, writers and directors in Hollywood]] who had been Communists or who had fallen in with Communist-controlled or influenced organizations in the pre-war and wartime years.

The union movement purged party members as well. The CIO formally expelled a number of left-led unions in 1949 after internal disputes triggered by the party's support for [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]]'s candidacy for President and its opposition to the [[Marshall Plan]], while other labor leaders sympathetic to the CPUSA either were driven out of their unions or dropped their alliances with the party.

In 1949's [[Foley Square trial]], the FBI prosecuted eleven members of the CPUSA's leadership, including [[Gus Hall]] and [[Eugene Dennis]]. The prosecution argued that the Party endorsed a violent overthrow of the government; but the defendants countered that they advocated for a peaceful transition to socialism, and that the [[First Amendment]]'s guarantee of free speech and association protected their membership in a political party.   The trial <U+2013> held in Manhattan's [[Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse|Foley Square courthouse]] <U+2013> was widely publicized by the media, and was featured on the cover of [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] twice. Large numbers of protesters supporting the communist defendants protested outside the courthouse daily. The defense attorneys used a "labor defense" strategy, which attacked the trial as a capitalist venture that would not provide a fair outcome to proletarian defendants. During the trial, the defense routinely antagonized the judge and prosecution, and five of the defendants were sent to jail for contempt of court for disrupting the trial.   Public opinion was overwhelmingly against the defendants, and after a ten month trial, the jury found all 11 defendants guilty, and they were sentenced to terms of five years in federal prison.  When the trial concluded, the judge sent all five defense attorneys to jail for contempt of court. Two of the attorneys were subsequently disbarred. The government prosecutors, encouraged by their success, arrested and convicted over 100 additional Party officers in the early 1950s.<ref>Belknap, Michal, R., "Foley Square Trial", in ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=CopQakAajYQC American political trials]'' (Michal Belknap, Ed.), Greenwood Publishing Group, 1994, ISBN	9780275944377</ref>

The widespread fear of Communism became even more acute after the Soviets' explosion of an [[atomic bomb]] in 1949 and discovery of Soviet espionage.<ref>[http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/postwar.htm History of the FBI: Postwar America: 1945<U+2013>1960s], Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), undated.

Liberal groups, such as the [[Americans for Democratic Action]], not only distanced themselves from communists and communist causes, but defined themselves as anti-communist. The Congress outlawed the CPUSA in the [[Communist Control Act]] of 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=2769 |title=This Day in History <U+2014> History.com <U+2014> What Happened Today in History |publisher=History.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}</ref> However, the act was largely ineffectual thanks in part to its ambiguous language. In the 1961 case, Communist Party v. Catherwood, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that the act did not bar the party from participating in New York's unemployment insurance system. No administration has tried to enforce it since.

By the mid-1950s, membership of Communist Party USA had slipped from its 1944 peak of around 80,000<ref>Summers, Anthony, ''Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover.''

===Party in crisis (1956<U+2013>1989)===

The [[Hungarian Revolution, 1956|1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary]] and the [[20th Party Congress|Secret Speech]] of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union criticizing Stalin had a cataclysmic effect on the previously [[Stalinist]] majority membership CPUSA.<ref>[[Howard Fast]], "On Leaving the Communist Party", ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|The Saturday Review]]'', November 16, 1957. [http://www.trussel.com/hf/onleave.htm Reproduced at trussel.com], Retrieved August 29, 2006.</ref> Membership plummeted and the leadership briefly faced a challenge from a loose grouping led by ''[[Daily Worker]]'' editor [[John Gates]], which wished to democratize the party. Perhaps the greatest single blow dealt to the party in this period was the loss of the ''Daily Worker'', published since 1924, which was suspended in 1958  due to falling circulation.

Most of the critics would depart from the party demoralized, but others would remain active in progressive causes and would often end up working harmoniously with party members. This [[diaspora]] rapidly came to provide the audience for publications like the ''National Guardian'' and ''Monthly Review'', which were to be important in the development of the [[New Left#New Left in the United States|New Left]] in the 1960s.

The post-1956 upheavals in the CPUSA also saw the advent of a new leadership around former steel worker [[Gus Hall]]. Hall's views were very much those of his mentor Foster, but the younger man was to be more rigorous in ensuring the party was completely orthodox than the older man in his last years. Therefore, while remaining critics who wished to liberalize the party were expelled, so too were [[anti-revisionist]] critics who took an anti-Khrushchev stance.

Many of these critics were elements on both U.S. coasts who would come together to form the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Movement]] in 1961. Progressive Labor would come to play a role in many of the numerous [[Maoism|Maoist]] organizations of the mid-1960s and early 1970s. [[Jack Shulman]], Foster's secretary, also played a role in these organizations; he was not expelled from the CP, but resigned. In the 1970s, the CPUSA managed to grow in membership to about 25,000 members, despite the exodus of numerous [[Anti-Revisionist]] and Maoist groups from its ranks.

An overview of the Communist Party's current ideology can be found in the near-definitive report, "Reflections on Socialism", by Sam Webb, the Party's national chair.  The article explains the Party's support for a democratic, anti-racist, anti-sexist, immediate left-wing change for the United States. The report also covers the fall of the [[Socialist Bloc]], claiming that democracy was not sufficiently developed in these countries. The report states that, "On the one hand, socialism transformed and modernized backward societies, secured important economic and social rights, assisted countries breaking free of colonialism, contributed decisively to the victory over Nazism, constituted by its mere presence a pressure on the ruling classes in the capitalist world to make concessions to their working classes and democratic movements, and acted as a counterweight to the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism for nearly fifty years." The report stresses its dedication to revolutionary struggle, but states that Americans should look for peaceful revolutionary change.  Webb says that capitalism cannot solve problems such as economic stagnation, racism, gender discrimination, or poverty.  The report explains that there will be many transitory stages from capitalism, to socialism, and finally to [[stateless society|communism]]. On the issue of markets in a socialist society, Webb states, "Admittedly, [[market mechanism]]s in a socialist society can generate inequality, disproportions and imbalances, destructive competition, downward pressure on wages, and monopoly cornering of commodity markets <U+2013> even the danger of capitalist restoration. But this is not sufficient reason for concluding that markets have no place in a socialist economy."

The CPUSA recognizes the right of independence-seeking groups, many of whom have been led by communist and communist-oriented partisans, to defend themselves from [[imperialism]], but rejects the use of violence in any United States uprising. The CPUSA argues that most violence throughout modern history is the result of capitalist [[ruling class]] violently trying to stop social change.<ref>[http://www.cpusa.org/article/static/511/#question32 Does the CPUSA advocate the violent overthrow of the government?

{{cquote|While some governments run by people calling themselves Communists have been responsible for horrible acts of violence and repression, notably the [[Pol Pot]] regime in [[Cambodia]], much if not most of the violence often blamed on revolutionary governments and parties is actually the responsibility of the conservative, reactionary, capitalist governments and parties. ...

The archives of the Communist Party USA were donated in March, 2007 to the [[Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives|Tamiment Library]] at [[New York University]]. The massive donation, in 12,000 cartons, included history from the founding of the party, 20,000 books and pamphlets, and a million photographs from the archives of the ''Daily Worker''. The Tamiment Library also holds a copy of the microfilmed archive of Communist Party documents from Soviet Archives held by the Library of Congress and from other materials which documents radical and Left history.<ref>"Communist Party USA Gives Its History to N.Y.U.", article by Patricia Cohen in the [[New York Times]], March 20, 2007</ref>

==Ideology==
===The CPUSA constitution and program===

According to its 2001 Constitution, the party operates on the principle of [[democratic centralism]], its highest authority being the quadrennial National Convention. Article VI, Section 3 of the 2001 Constitution lays out certain positions as non-negotiable:
<blockquote>"struggle for the unity of the working class, against all forms of national oppression, national chauvinism, discrimination and segregation, against all racist ideologies and practices<U+2026> against all manifestations of male supremacy and discrimination against women<U+2026> against homophobia and all manifestations of discrimination against gays, lesbians, [[Bisexuality|bisexuals]] and [[Transsexualism|transgender]] people<U+2026>"<ref name="CPUSA Constitution">[http://www.cpusa.org/cpusa-constitution/ CPUSA Constitution] Amended July 8, 2001 at the 27th National Convention, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Retrieved November 11, 2011.</ref></blockquote>

Among the points in the party's "Immediate Program" are a $12/hour [[minimum wage]] for all workers, national universal health care, and opposition to [[privatization]] of [[Social Security (United States)|United States Social Security]]. Economic measures such as increased taxes on "the rich and corporations", "strong regulation" of the financial industry, "regulation and public ownership of utilities", and increased federal aid to cities and states; opposition to the [[Iraq War]] and other military interventions; opposition to [[free trade]] treaties such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA); [[nuclear disarmament]] and a reduced military budget; various [[civil rights]] provisions; [[campaign finance reform]] including public financing of campaigns; and [[election law]] reform, including [[Instant Runoff Voting]].<ref name="Immediate Program"/>

===Bill of Rights socialism===

The Communist Party USA emphasizes a vision of socialism as an extension of American democracy.
Seeking to "build socialism in the United States based on the revolutionary traditions and struggles" of American history, the CPUSA promotes a conception of "Bill of Rights Socialism" that will "guarantee all the freedoms we have won over centuries of struggle, and also extend the [[Bill of Rights (United States)|Bill of Rights]] to include freedom from unemployment"<U+2013> as well as freedom "from poverty, from illiteracy, and from discrimination and oppression."<ref name = "28th Party Program">[http://www.cpusa.org/party-program/ Program of the Communist Party]</ref>

Reiterating the idea of property rights in socialist society as it is outlined
in [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]'s ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'',<ref>See Karl Marx, ''The Communist Manifesto'', Chapter 2.</ref> the Communist Party emphasizes that

<blockquote>
"Many myths have been propagated about socialism. Contrary to right-wing claims, socialism would not take away the personal private property of workers", but "the private ownership of major industries, financial institutions, and other large corporations, and the excessive luxuries of the super-rich."<ref name="28th Party Program"/></blockquote>

Rather than making all wages entirely equal, the Communist Party USA holds that building socialism would entail "eliminating private wealth from stock speculation, from private ownership of large corporations, from the export of capital and jobs, and from the exploitation of large numbers of workers."<ref name="28th Party Program"/>

===Living standards===

Among the primary concerns of the Communist Party are the problems of unemployment, [[underemployment]] and [[job insecurity]], which Communism understands as the natural result of the profit-driven incentives of the capitalist economy. <blockquote>"Millions of workers are unemployed, underemployed, or insecure in their jobs, even during economic upswings and periods of 'recovery' from recessions. Most workers experience long years of stagnant and declining real wages, while health and education costs soar. Many workers are forced to work second and third jobs to make ends meet. Most workers now average four different occupations during their lifetime, many involuntarily moved from job to job and career to career. Often, retirement-age workers are forced to continue working just to provide health care for themselves and their families. Millions of people continuously live below the poverty level; many suffer homelessness and hunger. Public and private programs to alleviate poverty and hunger do not reach everyone, and are inadequate even for those they do reach. With capitalist globalization, jobs move from place to place as capitalists export factories and even entire industries to other countries in a relentless search for the lowest wages."<ref name="28th Party Program"/></blockquote>

The Communist Party believes that "class struggle starts with the fight for wages, hours, benefits, working conditions, job security, and jobs. But it also includes an endless variety of other forms for fighting specific battles: resisting speed-up, picketing, contract negotiations, strikes, demonstrations, lobbying for pro-labor legislation, elections, and even general strikes."<ref name="28th Party Program"/></blockquote> The Communist Party's national programs understands that workers who struggle "against the capitalist class or any part of it on any issue with the aim of improving or defending their lives" are part of the class struggle.<ref name="28th Party Program"/>

===Imperialism and war===

The Communists maintain that developments within the [[foreign policy of the United States]]<U+2013>as reflected in the rise of [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]] and other groups associated with right-wing politics<U+2013>have developed in tandem with the interests of large-scale capital such as the [[multinational corporation]]s. The state thereby becomes thrust into a proxy role that is essentially inclined to help facilitate "control by one section of the capitalist class over all others and over the whole of society."<ref name="28th Party Program"/>

Accordingly, the Communist Party holds that right-wing policymakers such as the neoconservatives, steering the state away from working-class interests on behalf of a disproportionately powerful capitalist class, have <blockquote>"...demonized foreign opponents of the U.S., [[Iran-Contra Affair|covertly funded]] the right-wing-initiated [[History of Nicaragua#Communist leanings and U.S. Contras|civil war]] in Nicaragua, and [[United States support for Iraq during the Iran<U+2013>Iraq war|gave weapons]] to the [[Saddam Hussein]] dictatorship in [[Iraq]]. They picked small countries to invade, including [[United States invasion of Panama|Panama]] and [[Invasion of Grenada|Grenada]], testing new military equipment and strategy, and breaking down resistance at home and abroad to U.S. military invasion as a policy option."<ref name="28th Party Program"/></blockquote>

From its ideological framework, the Communist Party understands [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|imperialism as the pinnacle of capitalist development]]: the state, working on behalf of the few who wield disproportionate power, assumes the role of proffering "phony rationalizations" for economically driven imperial ambition as a means to promote the sectional economic interests of big business.<ref name="28th Party Program"/>

In opposition to what it considers the ultimate agenda of the conservative wing of U.S. politics, the Communist Party rejects such foreign policy proposals as the [[Bush Doctrine]], rejecting the right of the American government to attack

<blockquote>"any country it wants, to conduct [[Long War (21th century)|war without end]] until it succeeds everywhere, and even to [[Jorge E. Hirsch#Nuclear war analyses|use 'tactical' nuclear weapons]] and [[Militarization of space|militarize space]]. Whoever does not support the U.S. policy is condemned as an opponent. Whenever international organizations, such as the United Nations, do not support U.S. government policies, they are reluctantly tolerated until the U.S. government is able to subordinate or ignore them."<ref name="28th Party Program"/></blockquote>

Juxtaposing the support from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and the right wing of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]-led invasion of [[Iraq]] with the many millions of Americans who opposed the invasion of Iraq from its beginning, the Communist Party notes the spirit of opposition towards the war coming from the American public:

<blockquote>"Thousands of grassroots peace committees [were] organized by ordinary Americans... neighborhoods, small towns and universities expressing opposition in countless creative ways. Thousands of actions, vigils, teach-ins and newspaper advertisements were organized. The largest demonstrations were held since the Vietnam War. 500,000 marched in New York after the war started. Students at over 500 universities conducted a Day of Action for '[[Student Peace Action Network#Books Not Bombs|Books not Bombs]].'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Over 150 anti-war resolutions were passed by city councils. Resolutions were passed by thousands of local unions and community organizations. Local and national actions were organized on the Internet, including the 'Virtual March on Washington, D.C.'... officials were flooded with millions of calls, emails and letters.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In an unprecedented development, large sections of the US labor movement officially opposed the war. In contrast, it took years to build labor opposition to the [[Vietnam War]]... Chicago labor leaders formed Labor United for Peace, Justice and Prosperity. They concluded that mass education of their members was essential to counter false propaganda, and that the fight for the peace, economic security and democratic rights was interrelated.<ref>Bachtell, John.

The Party has consistently opposed U.S. involvement in the [[Korean War]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War|First Gulf War]], and the post-[[September 11 attacks|September 11]] conflicts in both [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]].

The Communist Party holds that racial and ethnic discrimination not only harms minorities, but is pernicious to working-class people of all backgrounds, as any discriminatory practices between demographic sections of the working class constitute an inherently divisive practice responsible for "obstructing the development of working-class consciousness, driving wedges in class unity to divert attention from [[Marxism#Exploitation|class exploitation]], and creating extra profits for the capitalist class."<ref>[http://www.cpusa.org/cpusa-constitution/ CPUSA Constitution] Amended July 8, 2001 at the 27th National Convention, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Supporting cooperation between economically advanced and less economically developed nations in the area of environmental cooperation, the Communist Party USA stands in favor of promoting <blockquote>"transfer from developed countries to developing countries of sustainable technology, and funds for capital investment in sustainable agriculture, energy, and industry.

===Religion===
The Communist Party is not against religion, but instead regards positively religious people's belief in [[justice]], peace and respectful relations among the peoples. To build good relations with supporters of religion, the party has its own Religious Commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpusa.org/faq/ |title=FAQ |publisher=cpusa |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}</ref>

==Relations with other groups==
===The U.S. labor movement===
:''See main article: [[Communists in the U.S. Labor Movement (1919<U+2013>1937)]], [[Communists in the U.S. Labor Movement (1937<U+2013>1950)]]''

The Communist Party has sought to play an active role in the US labor movement since its origins as part of its effort to build a mass movement of American workers to bring about their own liberation through socialist revolution. As the prospects for such a social cataclysm have faded over time, the party has increasingly emphasized the ameliorative value of trade unions in capitalist society.

===Soviet funding and espionage===
From 1959 until 1989, when Gus Hall attacked the initiatives taken by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in the Soviet Union, the CPUSA received a substantial subsidy from the Soviet Union. There is at least one receipt signed by Gus Hall in the KGB archives.<ref>This claim is made [http://members.iglou.com/jtmajor/SovWorl.htm on the personal site of Joseph T Major], Retrieved August 30, 2006. He cites it to Harvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes, and Kyrill M. Anderson, ''The Soviet World of American Communism'', Yale University Press (1998); ISBN 0-300-07150-7; '''Document 45''', p. 155. The text of a $3 million receipt dated March 19, 1988 is given on the site, but the receipt is not reproduced.</ref> Starting with $75,000 in 1959 this was increased gradually to $3 million in 1987. This substantial amount reflected the Party's subservience to the Moscow [[political line|line]], in contrast to the [[Italian Communist Party|Italian]] and later [[Spanish Communist Party|Spanish]] and [[Communist Party of Great Britain|British]] Communist parties, whose [[Eurocommunism]] deviated from the orthodox line in the late 1970s. Releases from the Soviet archives show that all national Communist parties that conformed to the Soviet line were funded in the same fashion. From the Communist point of view this international funding arose from the internationalist nature of Communism itself; fraternal assistance was considered the duty of Communists in any one country to give aid to their comrades in other countries. From the anti-communist point of view, this funding represented an unwarranted interference by one country in the affairs of another.

The cutoff of funds in 1989 resulted in a financial crisis, which forced the CPUSA to cut back publication in 1990  of the Party newspaper, the ''People's Daily World'', to weekly publication, the ''[[People's World|People's Weekly World]]''. (references for this section are provided [[#References for:Soviet funding of the Party|below]])

Much more controversial than mere funding, however, is the alleged involvement of CPUSA members in espionage for the Soviet Union. [[Whittaker Chambers]] has alleged that Sandor Goldberger<U+2014>also known as "Josef Peters", who commonly wrote under the name [[J. Peters]]<U+2014>headed the CPUSA's underground secret apparatus from 1932 to 1938 and pioneered its r<U+00F4>le as an auxiliary to Soviet intelligence activities.<ref name=Witness>

Stalin publicly disbanded the Comintern in 1943. A Moscow NKVD message to all stations on September 12, 1943 detailed instructions for handling intelligence sources within the CPUSA after the disestablishment of the Comintern.

There are a number of decrypted World War II Soviet messages between NKVD offices in the United States and Moscow, also known as the [[Venona cables]]. The Venona cables and other published sources appear to confirm that [[Julius Rosenberg]] was guilty of espionage. [[Theodore Hall]], a Harvard-trained [[physicist]] who did not join the CPUSA until 1952, began passing information on the atomic bomb to the Soviets soon after he was hired at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] at age 19. Hall, who was known as Mlad by his KGB handlers, escaped prosecution. Hall's wife, aware of his espionage, claims that their NKVD handler had advised them to plead innocent, as the Rosenbergs did, if formally charged.

It was the belief of opponents of the CPUSA such as [[J. Edgar Hoover]], long-time director of the FBI, and [[Joseph McCarthy]], for whom [[McCarthyism]] is named, and other [[anti-communism|anti-communists]] that the CPUSA constituted an active [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]], was secretive, loyal to a foreign power, and whose members assisted Soviet intelligence in the clandestine [[Espionage|infiltration]] of American government.  This is the "traditionalist" view of some in the field of [[Soviet and Communist studies|Communist studies]] such as Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes, since supported by several memoirs of ex-Soviet KGB officers and information obtained from VENONA and Soviet archives.<ref name="Haynes, John Earl 2000">Haynes, John Earl, and Klehr, Harvey, ''Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America'', Yale University Press (2000)</ref><ref>Schecter, Jerrold and Leona, ''Sacred Secrets: How Soviet Intelligence Operations Changed American History'', Potomac Books (2002)</ref><ref>Sudoplatov, Pavel Anatoli, Schecter, Jerrold L., and Schecter, Leona P., ''Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness <U+2013> A Soviet Spymaster'', Little Brown, Boston (1994)</ref>

At one time this view was shared by the majority of the [[United States Congress]]. In the "Findings and declarations of fact" section of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. Chap. 23 Sub. IV Sec. 841), it stated,

:"although purportedly a political party, is in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy... prescribed for it by the foreign leaders... to carry into action slavishly the assignments given...acknowledges no constitutional or statutory limitations... its dedication to the proposition that the present constitutional Government of the United States ultimately must be brought to ruin by any available means, including resort to force and violence... as the agency of a hostile foreign power renders its existence a clear present and continuing danger."<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sec_50_00000841----000-.html Title 50 > Chapter 23 > Subchapter IV > <U+00A7> 841. Findings and declarations of fact]. US Code collection, on the site of [[Cornell University]]. Accessed August 30, 2006.</ref>

In 1993, experts from the Library of Congress traveled to Moscow to copy previously secret archives of Communist Party USA (CPUSA) records, sent to the Soviet Union for safekeeping by party organizers. The records provided an irrefutable link between Soviet intelligence and information obtained by the CPUSA and its contacts in the U.S. government from the 1920s through the 1940s. Some documents revealed that the CPUSA was actively involved in secretly recruiting party members from African-American groups and rural farm workers. Other CPUSA records contained further evidence that Soviet sympathizers had indeed infiltrated the State Department, beginning in the 1930s. Included in CPUSA archival records were confidential letters from two U.S. ambassadors in Europe to Roosevelt and a senior State Department official. Thanks to an official in the State department sympathetic to the Party, the confidential correspondence, concerning political and economic matters in Europe, ended up in the hands of Soviet intelligence.<ref name="Haynes, John Earl 2000"/><ref>''Retrieved Papers Shed Light On Communist Activities In U.S.'', Associated Press, January 31, 2001</ref><ref>Weinstein, Allen, and Vassiliev, Alexander, ''The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America <U+2013> the Stalin Era'' (New York: Random House, 1999)</ref>

===Criminal prosecutions===
When the Communist Party was formed in 1919 the United States government was engaged in prosecution of socialists who had opposed World War I and military service. This prosecution was continued in 1919 and January, 1920 in the [[Palmer Raids]] or the [[Second Red Scare|red scare]]. Rank and file foreign-born members of the Party were targeted and as many as possible were arrested and deported; leaders were prosecuted and in some cases sentenced to prison terms. In the late 1930s, with the authorization of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) began investigating both domestic Nazis and Communists. Congress passed the [[Smith Act]], which made it illegal to advocate, abet, or teach the desirability of overthrowing the government, in 1940.

In 1949, the federal government put [[Eugene Dennis]], [[William Z. Foster]] and ten other CPUSA leaders on trial for advocating the violent overthrow of the government. Because the prosecution could not show that any of the defendants had openly called for violence or been involved in accumulating weapons for a proposed revolution, it relied on the testimony of former members of the party that the defendants had privately advocated the overthrow of the government and on quotations from the work of [[Karl Marx]], Lenin and other revolutionary figures of the past. During the course of the trial the judge held several of the defendants and all of their counsel in contempt of court.

All of the remaining eleven defendants were found guilty. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of their convictions by a 6<U+2013>2 vote in [[Dennis v. United States]], {{ussc|341|494|1951}}. The government then proceeded with the prosecutions of more than 100 "second string" members of the party.

Panicked by these arrests and the fear that it was compromised by informants, Dennis and other party leaders decided to go underground and to disband many affiliated groups. The move only heightened the political isolation of the leadership, while making it nearly impossible for the Party to function.

The widespread support of action against communists and their associates began to abate somewhat after Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] overreached himself in the [[Army-McCarthy Hearings]], producing a backlash. The end of the [[Korean War]] in 1953 also led to a lessening of anxieties about subversion. The Supreme Court brought a halt to the Smith Act prosecutions in 1957  in its decision in [[Yates v. United States]], {{ussc|354|298|1957}}, which required that the government prove that the defendant had actually taken concrete steps toward the forcible overthrow of the government, rather than merely advocating it in theory.

===African Americans===
{{Main|The Communist Party USA and African-Americans}}
The Communist Party USA played a significant role in defending the rights of African-Americans during its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s. Earlier however, at the direction of the Comintern in 1928, the party advocated for many years a separate 'Negro Republic', to be founded in the heavily black populated areas of the Southern part of the United States. Based on Stalin's nationalities policy in the Soviet Union, blacks throughout the US were to be declared citizens of this new Republic, then shipped off to it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Throughout its history many of the Party's leaders and political thinkers have been African Americans. [[James W. Ford|James Ford]], [[Charlene Mitchell]], [[Angela Davis]], and [[Jarvis Tyner]], the current executive vice chair of the Party, all ran as presidential or vice presidential candidates on the Party ticket. Others like [[Benjamin J. Davis]], [[William L. Patterson]], [[Harry Haywood]], James Jackson, [[Henry Winston]], [[Claude Lightfoot]], Alphaeus Hunton, Doxey Wilkerson, [[Claudia Jones]], and John Pittman contributed in important ways to the Party's approaches to major issues from human and civil rights, peace, women's equality, the national question, working class unity, Socialist thought, cultural struggle and more. Their contributions have had a lasting impact on not only the Party but the general public as well. Noted African American thinkers, artists, and writers such as [[Claude McKay]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Ann Petry]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Shirley Graham Du Bois]], [[Lloyd Brown]], [[Charles Wilbert White|Charles White]], [[Elizabeth Catlett]], [[Paul Robeson]], [[Frank Marshall Davis]], [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], and many more were one-time members or supporters of the Party, and the Communists also had a close alliance with Harlem Congressman [[Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]]<ref>Mink, Gwendolyn, and Alice O'Connor. ''Poverty in the United States: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, and Policy''. ABC-CLIO, 2004. ISBN 1-57607-597-4, ISBN 978-1-57607-597-5. P. 194.</ref> The party's work to appeal to African-Americans continues to this day. It was instrumental in the founding of the [[Black Radical Congress]] in 1998.

===The gay rights movement===
One of America's most prominent sexual radicals, [[Harry Hay]], developed his political views as an active member of the CPUSA, but his founding in the early 1950s of the [[Mattachine Society]], America's second [[gay rights]] group, was not seen as something Communists should associate with organizationally. Most Party members saw homosexuality as something done by those with fascist tendencies (following the lead of the Soviet Union in criminalizing the practice for that reason)  and Hay was expelled from the party as an ideological risk. In 2004, the editors of ''[[Political Affairs Magazine|Political Affairs]]'' published articles detailing their self-criticism of the Party's early views of gay and lesbian rights<ref>[http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/view/115/ In this issue...], ''Political Affairs'', April 2004. Retrieved August 29, 2006.</ref> and praised Hay's work.

The CPUSA endorsed [[LGBT rights]] in a 2005 statement. <ref>"Communist Party, USA: Resolution on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Rights". Convention Resolution. July 20 2005. ''Resolution''. ''CPUSA Online''. http://www.cpusa.org/communist-party-usa-resolution-on-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-rights/ Retrieved Aug. 20, 2012</ref> CPUSA affirmed the resolution with a statement a year later in honor of [[gay pride]] month in June, 2006. <ref>"Gay Pride Month: Communists stand in solidarity". Statement. June 24 2006. ''Statement''. ''CPUSA Online''. http://www.cpusa.org/gay-pride-month-communists-stand-in-solidarity/ Retrieved Aug. 20, 2012</ref>

===The U.S. peace movement===
The Communist Party opposed the U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], the invasion of [[Grenada]], and U.S. support for anti-communist military dictatorships and movements in Central America.  Meanwhile, some in the [[peace movement]] and the [[New Left]] rejected the CPUSA for what it saw as the party's bureaucratic rigidity and for its steadfastly close association with the Soviet Union.

The CPUSA has been consistently opposed to the U.S.'s 2003<U+2013>2010 in Iraq.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20030407153812/http://cpusa.org/ No to Bush's War!], CPUSA Online, archived on the [[Internet Archive]] April 7, 2003.</ref>
[[United for Peace and Justice]], currently the largest peace and justice coalition in the U.S., includes the CPUSA as a member group, with Judith LeBlanc, who chairs the CPUSA's Peace and Solidarity Commission, being a member of the Steering Committee of UFPJ.
