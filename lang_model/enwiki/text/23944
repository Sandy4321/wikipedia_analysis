[[Alessandra Rosaldo]] started singing at the age of 12, soon becoming a backup singer for Latin star Lucero. Joined by [[Chacho Gayt<U+00E1>n]], the act released a self-titled debut album in 1993, getting their songs "Historias De Amor" and "Escribeme En El Cielo" climbing on local charts. A year later, Sentidos Opuestos recorded Al Sol Que Mas Calienta, moving to Barcelona, Spain, to make Viviendo Del Futuro, produced by Eduardo Posada and released in 1996. After issuing Viento A Favor in 1998, [[Chacho Gayt<U+00E1>n]] began working as a producer and arranger while [[Alessandra Rosaldo]] was making her debut as an actress in a soap opera called Sue<U+0144>os de Juventud.
