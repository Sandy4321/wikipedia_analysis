Arhopala amantes is largest lycanid in Sri Lanka.It's surprisingly inconspicuous on the wing despite the brilliant metallic blue markings on its upper side. 
In the female, the blue scales are restricted to the center and basal part of both wings; 
the outer margins are marked by a wide black band.
It is a butterfly of the canopy of small trees, occasionally coming down to settle on shrubs and low bushes. 
It flies about a great deal during the day but often with long periods of resting in between flights. 
To rest, it usually selects a leaf exposed to full sun at a considerable height above ground. 

The eggs are laid on the leaves of Syzigium spp.The larvae and pupae are always attended by red ants.
