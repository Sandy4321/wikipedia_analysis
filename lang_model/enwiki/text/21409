There have been two '''Baronetcies''' created for members of the '''Jessel family''', both in the [[Baronetage of the United Kingdom]]. One creation is extant as of 2010. 

The '''Jessel Baronetcy''', of Ladham House in Goudhurst in the County of Kent, was created in the [[Baronetage of the United Kingdom]] on 25 May 1883 for Charles Jessel, in honour of his father, the prominent lawyer and judge [[George Jessel (jurist)|Sir George Jessel]], [[Master of the Rolls]] from 1873 to 1883. The first Baronet was later [[High Sheriff of Kent]] in 1903. 

The '''Jessel Baronetcy''', of Westminster in the County of London, was created in the [[Baronetage of the United Kingdom]] in 1917 for the politician [[Herbert Jessel, 1st Baron Jessel|Herbert Jessel]], second son of Sir George Jessel and younger brother of the first Baronet of the 1883 creation. He was elevated to the peerage as [[Baron Jessel]] in 1924 (see this title for more information).
