'''Point Fermin''' is a [[lighthouse]] on Point Fermin in the [[San Pedro Harbour]], [[California]] 

==History==
The original fourth order [[Fresnel lens]] was removed in 1942 and a wood replica lantern was installed in 1974. The lighthouse was saved from demolition in 1972 and refurbished in 1974, and a new lantern room and gallery were built by local preservationists. In 1972, the light was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. 

Historical Information from Coast Guard web site:
