The '''MIT License''' is a [[free software license]] originating at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). It is a [[permissive software license|permissive]] license, meaning that it permits reuse within [[proprietary software]] on the condition that the license is distributed with that software, and [[GNU General Public License#Compatibility and multi-licensing|GPL-compatible]], meaning that the [[GPL]] permits combination and redistribution with software that uses the MIT License.

According to the [[Free Software Foundation]], the MIT License is more accurately called the '''X11 license''', since MIT has used many licenses for software and the license was first drafted for the [[X Window System]].<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#X11License |title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them |accessdate=2007-07-07 |last=Stallman |first=Richard |publisher=Free Software Foundation }}</ref>

[[Computer software|Software packages]] that use the MIT License include [[Expat (XML)|Expat]], [[PuTTY]], [[Mono (software)|Mono development platform]] class libraries, [[Ruby on Rails]], [[Cakephp]], [[Twisted (software)|Twisted]], [[Paint.NET|Paint.NET]], [[Lua Programming Language|Lua 5.0 onwards]] and the [[X Window System]], for which the license was written.

Some software packages [[dual license]] their products under the MIT License, such as older versions of the [[cURL]] library, which allowed recipients to choose either the [[Mozilla Public License]] or the MIT License.

== License terms ==

The license is as follows:

 Copyright (c) <year> <copyright holders>
 
 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person
 obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation
 files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without
 restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,
 copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
 copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the
 Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following
 conditions:
 
 The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
 included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
 
 THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
 EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES
 OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
 NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT
 HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
 WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
 FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR
 OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

== Modified versions of the license ==

The license can be modified to suit particular needs. For example, the [[Free Software Foundation]] agreed in [[1998]] to use a modified MIT License for [[ncurses]], which adds this clause:<ref>{{cite web
   |url=http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#is_it_gpl
   |title=NCURSES - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
   |last=Dickey
   |first=Thomas E.
}}</ref>

:''Except as contained in this notice, the name(s) of the above copyright holders shall not be used in advertising or otherwise to promote the sale, use or other dealings in this Software without prior written authorization.''

The XFree86 Project uses a modified MIT License for [[XFree86]] version 4.4 onward. The license includes a clause that requires attribution in software documentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfree86.org/current/LICENSE4.html#6 |title=XFree86 License (version 1.1) |accessdate=2007-07-12 |publisher=XFree86 Project }}</ref> The [[Free Software Foundation]] contends that this addition is incompatible with the version 2 of the GPL, but compatible with version 3.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/index_html#XFree861.1License |title=Licenses |accessdate=2007-07-12 |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] }}</ref>

:''The end-user documentation included with the redistribution, if any, must include the following acknowledgment: "This product includes software developed by The XFree86 Project, Inc <nowiki>(http://www.xfree86.org/)</nowiki> and its contributors", in the same place and form as other third-party acknowledgments. Alternately, this acknowledgment may appear in the software itself, in the same form and location as other such third-party acknowledgments.''

== Comparison to other licenses ==

The MIT License is similar to the 3-clause "modified" [[BSD license#Terms|BSD license]], except that the BSD license contains a notice prohibiting the use of the name of the copyright holder in promotion.  This is sometimes present in versions of the MIT License, as noted above.

The original BSD license also includes a clause requiring all advertising of the software to display a notice crediting its authors. This "advertising clause" (since disavowed by UC Berkeley<ref name=update>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change|title=To All Licensees, Distributors of Any Version of BSD|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|date=[[1999-07-22]]|accessdate=2006-11-15}}</ref>) is only present in the modified MIT License used by [[XFree86]].

The MIT License states more explicitly the rights given to the [[end-user]], including the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell the software.

A 2-clause BSD-style license used by [[FreeBSD]] (and preferred for [[NetBSD]]) is essentially identical to the MIT License, as it contains neither an advertising clause, nor a promotional use of copyright holder's name prohibition.

Also similar in terms is the [[ISC license]], which has a simpler language.

The [[University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License]] combines text from both the MIT and BSD licenses; the license grant and disclaimer are taken from the MIT License.
