==Biography==
===Early life===
Saberi was born in [[Belleville, New Jersey]],  the daughter of Reza Saberi, who was born in Iran, and Akiko Saberi, who is from [[Japan]]. When she was six months old, her family moved to [[Fargo, North Dakota]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Mackey |title=Iran Says an American<U+2019>s Reports Were <U+2018>Illegal<U+2019> |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2009-05-11 |url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/iran-says-an-americans-reports-were-illegal/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=M.J. |last=Stephey |title=Imprisoned Journalist Roxana Saberi |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2009-05-07 |accessdate=2009-06-15 |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1896532,00.html }}</ref> Graduating with honors from [[Fargo North High School]] in 1994, Roxana played [[piano]] and [[soccer]], and took part in [[Key Club]] and [[cheerleader|danceline]].<ref name="FNHS">{{citeweb|url=http://www.fargo.k12.nd.us/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=19180|title=2007 Hall of Fame|publisher=Fargo North High School|accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> Saberi was inducted into the school's Hall of Fame in 2007.<ref name="FNHS"/>

She graduated in 1997 from [[Concordia College (Minnesota)|Concordia College]] in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]], with degrees in [[Communication studies|Communication]] and [[French language|French]]. Saberi also played for the Cobbers [[soccer]] team in both the 1994 and 1996 seasons.<ref name="Concordia">{{citeweb|url=http://www.cord.edu/dept/sports/sportsbackup/ws8nrsab.html|title=Roxana Saberi|publisher=Concordia College|accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>

NPR and BBC do not say-->

===Career===
Saberi, who works as a freelance journalist, moved to Iran in 2003. She arrived in [[Tehran]] in February 2003 to open a fully accredited news bureau for the independent broadcast news agency Feature Story News (FSN).  FSN distributed her reports to a wide range of broadcasters around the world, and Roxana's work soon became familiar to the viewers and listeners of [[Channel News Asia]], [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|South African Broadcasting]], [[Deutsche Welle|DW Radio]], [[Vatican Radio]], [[Radio New Zealand]], Australian Independent Radio News, and others.  She also made occasional contributions to [[PBS]], [[NPR]], and [[Fox News]].

In June 2003, without explanation, the Iranian authorities revoked Roxana's press accreditation and closed the FSN bureau in Iran.  A second press accreditation was then issued, permitting Roxana Saberi to freelance in Iran for the [[BBC]].  In late 2006, it was also peremptorily revoked.  Roxana Saberi remained in Iran to research a book, and filed occasional reports from the country for NPR and [[ABC Radio]].  She was imprisoned by the government of Iran from February until May 2009.

===Iranian imprisonment===
Saberi's father reported that he last heard from her on February 10, 2009, and that she reported being held in detention for 10 days at that time. Saberi holds both Iranian and US [[citizenship]], although the Iranian authorities do not recognize [[dual citizenship]] and were believed to be treating her as one of their own nationals.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7921907.stm|title=Iran confirms reporter detention|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-03-03|accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>

Saberi was arrested in February, 2009 for [[espionage]].<ref name="AP">{{ cite web | title = Daughter Now Suicidal  [[Iran]] | url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090324/us_nm/us_iran_usa_journalist_1 |accessdate=2009-03-24 }}</ref><ref name="NPR">{{ cite web | title = American Journalist Arrested In Iran | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101306180 | accessdate=2009-03-01 }}</ref> According to one of Saberi's lawyers, she had obtained a classified document while working as a translator for a powerful clerical lobby. This had been used as evidence to convict her on charges of espionage.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6274496.ece Jailed US journalist Roxana Saberi 'had secret document on war in Iraq'], TimesOnline </ref> The document was a confidential Iranian report on the U.S.-led war in Iraq, and Saberi had taken a copy for herself of the confidential report, which she later stated that she had done "out of curiosity."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/12/AR2009051203477.html Journalist Copied Iranian Report on U.S. and Iraq, Washington Post]</ref> At the appeals court, Saberi was given an opportunity to explain her side, and acknowledged copying the document two years ago but denied passing it on to the Americans. She apologized, saying it had been a mistake to take the report.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/12/AR2009051203477.html Journalist Copied Iranian Report on U.S. and Iraq, Washington Post]</ref>

Saberi was first charged on March 2, while working as a reporter without press credentials, which were revoked in 2006.<ref name="BBC3">{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7919458.stm|title=Iran 'holds unlicensed' reporter|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-03-02|accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> On March 13, a number of international news organisations wrote an open letter to the Iranian government, calling on Iran to allow independent access to Saberi. Signatories included: president of [[NPR]], [[Vivian Schiller]]; president of [[ABC News]], [[David Westin]]; [[Wall Street Journal]] editor-in-chief, [[Robert Thomson]]; [[John Stack]] of [[Fox News]]; and World Editor at the [[BBC]], Jon Williams. The open letter expresses deep concern about Saberi's well-being and "the deprivation of her rights:"<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.npr.org/about/press/2009/031009.RoxanaSaberi.html|title=MAJOR WORLDWIDE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS PRESS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING AMERICAN JOURNALIST ROXANA SABERI BEING HELD IN IRAN|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=2009-03-13|accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7936659.stm|title=Broadcasters urge Saberi access|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-03-13|accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>

After a month long period of captivity, on March 13, a family attorney was allowed to see Saberi and she was allowed to call her family.<ref name="BBC3"/> On March 18, marking 47 days of detention, the Saberi family called on Iran's Supreme Leader, [[Ayatollah]] [[Ali Khamenei]], to intervene ahead of the Persian [[Nowruz]] holiday.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/mar/24/iran-usa|title=Iran must free Roxana Saberi|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|author=Henry Newman and Coco Ferguson|date=2009-03-25|accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> The US administration expressed its concern at Saberi's detention, dismissing allegations against her as "baseless."

On April 8, the Iranian government charged Saberi with espionage,<ref name="FoxNews">{{ cite web | title = Iran Charges Detained American Reporter With Espionage  [[Iran]] | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,513207,00.html |accessdate=2009-04-08 }}</ref><ref name="NYT1">{{citeweb|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/world/middleeast/15iran.html?hpw|title=American Journalist Stands Trial in Iran|publisher=New York Times|author=Nazila Fathi|date=2009-04-18|accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> while the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] quoting a judge who is the deputy head of Iran's prosecutor's office, said Saberi had "accepted" the accusation of espionage.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.reuters.com/news/pictures/entertainment/picture?channelId=5002&currentPic=232&picId=9619612|title=ISNA: "Saberi "accepted" accusation of espionage|publisher=Reuters|date=2009-04-18|accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> On April 18, according to her lawyer Abdolsamad Khorramshahi speaking to [[Reuters]], after a five day trial ''"Saberi has been sentenced to eight years in jail.

[[Switzerland]] represents United States interests in Iran, as Iran and the United States do not presently have [[Iran <U+2013> United States relations| diplomatic relations]]. US State Department spokesman Robert Wood raised questions about the transparency of Iran's [[Islamic Revolutionary Court]] judicial system, commenting that a Swiss representative was not allowed in the courtroom during Saberi's trial.<ref name="WashP1"/>

On April 19, 2009, President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] emphasized that Saberi must have her legal right to defend herself. He wrote to the prosecutors: "Please, personally observe the process to ensure that the defendants are allowed all legal rights and freedom in defending themselves and that their rights are not violated even by one iota".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8006861.stm]</ref>  It was reported on April 21 that Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Shirin Ebadi]]'s organization, Human Rights Defenders, would defend Saberi during her appeal.<ref>Thomas Erdbrink, "Iranian Nobel Winner to Defend U.S. Journalist", ''The Washington Post'' (April 21, 2009), available online at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/20/AR2009042003232.html?hpid=topnews</ref> This appointment was never completed, amid reports of objections by Iranian authorities.
On April 21, 2009 [[Bahman Ghobadi]], an Iranian film director, published a letter declaring Roxana's innocence and urging those who knew her to step in and defend her. <ref>http://www.iranhumanrights.org/2009/04/ghobadiletter/</ref> Ghobadi described himself as Roxana's fianc<U+00E9>. 

====Hunger Strike====
On April 25, 2009, the BBC reported that Roxana's father, Reza Saberi, claimed to have received word from his daughter that she had been on [[hunger strike]] for 5 days.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Saberi 'on hunger  strike' in Iran|date=2009-04-25|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8018193.stm|accessdate=2009-04-25|work=BBC}}</ref>  She allegedly discontinued the hunger strike after two weeks, for "health reasons."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Roxana Saberi interrupts hunger strike|date=2009-05-06|url=http://asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=15172&size=A|accessdate=2009-05-07|work=AsiaNews.it}}</ref> No Iranian sources confirmed the hunger strike.<ref>[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&categ_id=2&article_id=101460]</ref>

On May 10, 2009, Saberi's appeal was heard by an Iranian appeals court. A day later, on May 11, 2009, preliminary reports suggested Saberi's appeal had been granted. The court is said to have suspended the immediate prison term, and reduced the original sentence to 2 years. At the same time, she is supposedly allowed to leave Iran immediately. However, this contradicts the sentence reduction.<ref name="Fox-5-11-2009"/><ref>"Iran 'to release' Reporter Saberi." BBC News | Middle East. British Broadcasting Corporation. 11 May 2009 accessible online at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8043768.stm.</ref>

Around 9:30 AM EST on May 11, 2009, news network [[MSNBC]] reported that Saberi's lawyer said that she'd already been freed.

Her situation was followed closely by [[Amnesty International]],<ref>{{cite web

====Possible politics behind Saberi's case====
===== Speculations and alleged scenarios proposed by some American analysts =====
Separate news analyses in different publications have suggested two advantages to the [[Iranian government]] for the speedy conviction of Saberi:<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/opinion/17fri1.html?ref=opinion "Editorial: Roxana Saberi", [[New York Times]], April 17, 2009]</ref><ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iran-journalist15-2009apr15,0,4355386.story "Trial of Iranian American journalist over, officials say", by Borzou Daragahi, April 15, 2009 [[Los Angeles Times]]]</ref>

* She can be used as a bargaining chip to obtain the release of [[US raid on Iranian Liaison Office in Arbil|5 Iranian officials detained by the U.S. government in Iraq in 2007]].  Iran is also suspected of secretly holding former [[FBI]] agent [[Robert Levinson]] as collateral against such an exchange.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-04-20-voa44.cfm "Iran Careful in Response to US Criticism of Saberi Case", by Edward Yeranian, April 20, 2009, [[Voice of America]]]</ref>  On July 9, 2009, the 5 Iranian diplomats, identified as Mohsen Bagheri, Mahmoud Farhadi, Majid Ghaemi, Majid Dagheri and Abbas Jami on Iranian TV according to The Associated Press, were released to Iraqi custody where they were expected to be transferred to the Iranian Embassy in Baghdad. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/07/09/world/AP-ML-Iraq-Iranian-Diplomats.html?hp "U.S. Hands 5 Detained Iranians to Iraq," By The Associated Press, July 9, 2009 [[New York Times]]<ref>  

* As a way for some in the Government to deflect [[Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration#Iran|President Obama<U+2019>s effort to engage Tehran]].  A move by Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] to offer a fuller defense to Saberi on appeal calls this motive into question.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iCJY4lE5kHBHPnISEZo0LopbpHPgD97LP1C80 "Iran president urges full defense for US reporter", by NASSER KARIMI, [[Associated Press]], April 20, 2009]</ref>  However, an analysis in the [[New York Times]] on April 29, 2009 suggests that the conflict is not between conservatives and reformers but within the conservatives.  The article notes that [[Mehdi Karroubi]] asserted that certain conservatives own 63 ports that are outside of government control, and stand to lose money if US economic sanctions are removed.  This gives them a financial incentive to oppose reconciliation.<ref>[http://nytimes.com/2009/04/29/opinion/29iht-edsahimi.html?hpw "Iran<U+2019>s Power Struggle", by Muhammad Sahimi, [[New York Times]], April 29, 2009]</ref>

===== Accusations of a double standard of United States in treating similar cases =====

American civil right activist [[Glenn Greenwald]], while stating his belief that Saberi's conviction was improper, has pointed to the hypocrisy of American reporters who rallied to Saberi's defense but have been silent about the plight of journalists like [[Sami Al-Haj]], an Al Jazeera cameraman who was held for six years in [[Guantanamo]] by the U.S. government.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/05/11/journalists/ Roxana Saberi's plight and American media propaganda]</ref> Al-Haj<U+2019>s imprisonment received nearly no news coverage. Associated Press photographer, [[Bilal Hussein]], was imprisoned in Iraq for close to two years with no charges. Hussein has photographs from the Anbar province which contradicted Bush administration claims of the state of affairs in Iraq. [[Salon.com|Salon]] analysts accused United States for double standard in treating Saberi and Hussein's case.<ref>[http://www.collegenews.com/index.php?/article/iranian_american_journalist_released_from_imprisonment_05112009138/ Iranian-American journalist released from prison]</ref><ref>[http://www.dailytexanonline.com/opinion/viewpoint-05-12-09-1.1749124]</ref>

The Committee to Protect Journalists documented seven cases in 2005 alone in which U.S. forces detained Iraqi journalists for many weeks or months without charge or due process. One CBS cameraman, Abdul Ameer Hussein, shot by U.S. forces, was imprisoned for one year without due process.<ref>"[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/05/iraq/main1472263.shtml CBS Cameraman Acquitted In Iraq]", CBS Cameraman Acquitted In Iraq, April 5, 2006</ref>
