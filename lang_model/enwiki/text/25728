The {{nihongo|'''''Tosa'' class'''|<U+52A0><U+8CC0><U+578B><U+6226><U+8266>|Kagagata Senkan}}<ref group=A>The ships are sometimes referred to as the ''Kaga'' class, after the ship that was planned to have been completed first.</ref> of battleships was a [[Japan]]ese [[dreadnought]] class planned as part of the "[[Eight-eight fleet|Eight-Eight]]" fleet. The ships were a larger version of the preceding {{sclass|Nagato|battleship|0}}, and mounted an additional dual 16&nbsp;in (406&nbsp;mm) [[gun turret]]. The ships were also larger, in both length and beam, and [[Draft (hull)|drew]] an additional 10&nbsp;inches (25.4&nbsp;mm) at full load.<ref name="Conways232">Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 232</ref> The design for the class also served as a basis for the contemporary {{sclass|Amagi|battlecruiser|4}} battlecruisers.<ref name="Conways232" />

The ''Tosa'' class consisted of {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Tosa||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaga||2}}. Both were canceled according to the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] before either could be completed. ''Tosa'' was sunk as a gunnery target in the [[Bungo Channel]], while the incomplete hull of ''Kaga'' was converted into an [[aircraft carrier]].<ref group=A>Originally, ''Kaga'' was not going to be converted in favor of the two ''Amagi'' class. However, {{Ship|Japanese battlecruiser|Amagi||2}} was severely damaged in the [[1923 Great Kant<U+014D> earthquake|Great Kant<U+014D> earthquake]] of 1923, so ''Kaga'' was converted instead.</ref> After having been converted into an aircraft carrier, ''Kaga'' took part in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], before eventually being sunk at the [[Battle of Midway]] in 1942.

== Design ==
=== Dimensions and machinery ===
The ships had a planned displacement of {{convert|39900|LT|t|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|44200|LT|t|abbr=on}} at a full load. They would have been {{convert|715|ft|m}} long at the [[Length at the waterline|waterline]], and {{convert|760|ft|m}} [[Length overall|overall]]; they would have had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|100|ft|m}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|30|ft|10|in|m}}. Although a [[turbo-electric]] drive was considered for these ships after the United States announced that the plant was a great success in the battleship {{USS|New Mexico|BB-40|6}} (the Japanese estimated that a {{convert|70000|shp|lk=in}} turbo-electric plant could be installed in the ''Tosa'' class, which would have given the ships a speed of {{convert|25.25|knot|km/h}}, a {{convert|2500|nmi|km}} range at full speed, and a {{convert|7800|nmi|km}} range at {{convert|14|knots|km/h}}, it was rejected, and more conventional Curtis [[Steam turbine|turbines]] were chosen. These turbines would have used 4 propeller shafts, and would have been powered by 12 Kampon [[water-tube boiler]]s, 8 of which would have been oil fired, while the other 4 would have mixed oil and coal for fuel. This system would have provided {{convert|91000|shp}} for a top speed of {{convert|26.5|knots|km/h}}. The fuel stores would have amounted to 3,600&nbsp;tons of oil and 1,800&nbsp;tons of coal; at a speed of 14&nbsp;knots, this would have enabled a maximum range of {{convert|6500|nmi|km}}.<ref name="Conways232" />

=== Armament ===
The ships of the class were planned to be equipped with a main battery of ten {{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}} L/45<ref group=A>L/45 denotes the length of the gun barrels; in this case, the gun is 45 [[Calibers#Caliber_as_measurement_of_length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 45 times long as it is in diameter.</ref> guns in five twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]. The guns fired {{convert|2205|lbs|kg|adj=on}} [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] [[projectile]]s with a [[propellant]] charge weighing {{convert|494|lbs|kg}} at {{convert|2592|ft/s|m/s}}, at a rate of fire between 1.5 to 2.5 rounds per minute. Each gun had 90 rounds, and had an approximate barrel life of 250 to 300 shots. The turrets would have been arranged along the centerline: two superfiring turrets fore, and three in line aft of the superstructure. The gun turrets weighed {{convert|1004|LT|MT}}, and allowed for depression down to <U+2212>5<U+00B0> and elevation to 30<U+00B0>.<ref>{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = Japanese 41 cm/45 (16.1") 3rd Year Type, 40 cm/45 (16.1") 3rd Year Type | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_161-45_3ns.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 19 April 2007 | accessdate = 18 January 2009 }}</ref>

The secondary battery would have consisted of twenty {{convert|5.5|in|mm|adj=on}} L/50 guns mounted in [[casemate]]s along the center of the ship. These guns fired {{convert|83.8|lbs|kg|adj=on}} projectiles and used between {{convert|22.8|and|24.2|lbs|kg}} of propellant at a [[muzzle velocity]] between {{convert|2789|and|2805|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The guns had a maximum elevation of 25<U+00B0>, which enabled a maximum range of {{convert|19140|yards|m}}.<ref>{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = Japanese 5.5"/50 (14 cm) 3rd Year Type  | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_55-50_3ns.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 23 August 2007 | accessdate = 18 January 2009 }}</ref> Four<U+2014>later increased to six<U+2014>{{convert|4.7|in|mm|adj=on}} L/45 anti-aircraft guns were to have been mounted amidships, along with eight {{convert|24|in|mm|sigfig=2|adj=on}} above-water torpedo tubes.<ref name="Conways232" />

=== Armor ===
The ships would have been protected by a [[Belt armor|main belt]] of armor 11&nbsp;in (279.4&nbsp;mm) thick, sloped at 15&nbsp;degrees. The belt armor was designed to be able to defeat 16&nbsp;in (406&nbsp;mm) shells from a distance of 12,000<U+2013>20,000&nbsp;meters (13100<U+2013>21900&nbsp;yards). The main battery turrets and barbettes would have had between 9<U+2013>12&nbsp;in (229<U+2013>305&nbsp;mm) of armor plating, and the [[conning tower]] would have had armor 14&nbsp;in (356&nbsp;mm) thick. The decks would have been 4&nbsp;in (102&nbsp;mm) thick. The ''Tosa'' class battleships would have had a [[torpedo bulkhead]] 3&nbsp;in (76.2&nbsp;mm) thick, which connected at the top to a 1.5&nbsp;in (38.1&nbsp;mm) splinter deck beneath the main deck.<ref name="Conways232" />

== Background ==
Experiences in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] convinced naval war planners that more fast capital ships were needed, so on 4 April 1907, the [[Imperial Defence Council]] approved an "[[Eight-eight fleet|Eight-Eight]]" policy. This plan originally called for a fleet of eight [[battleship]]s and eight [[armored cruiser]]s that would all be under ten years old (later changed to eight [[battlecruiser]]s and reduced to eight years old). However, the advent of the [[dreadnought]] crippled this plan at the beginning; given Japan's economy<ref name="Conway's223">Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 223</ref> and the enormous strain that had been put on it during the Russo-Japanese War (Japan emerged from the war victorious, but bankrupt),<ref name="Conway's222">Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 222</ref> the launch of [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] was a "disaster" for Japan.<ref name="Conway's223"/>

In 1907, Japan was nominally halfway to the eight-eight with two newly-delivered [[pre-dreadnought]] battleships (the {{Sclass|Katori|battleship|0}}) in the fleet and two more pre-dreadnoughts (the {{Sclass|Satsuma|battleship|0}}) and four armored cruisers authorized or under construction. In addition, three more battleships and four armored cruisers had been authorized, though not funded. However, naval technology was changing; armored cruisers were seemingly obsolete in the face of the new battlecruisers being laid down by Great Britain and Germany. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]] recognized this, and so they proposed in 1909 that two battlecruisers be ordered from British plans, with one to be built in Great Britain and one to be built at home. These two ships became the {{Sclass|Kong<U+014D>|battlecruiser|0}}.<ref name="Conway's223"/>

In 1910, there was still authorization for one battleship and four armored cruisers. This battleship, the battleship version of the ''Kongo''-class battlecruisers, became Japan's first [[super-dreadnought]] [[Japanese battleship Fuso|''Fuso'']]. With these ships, Japan appeared to be getting closer to the eight-eight goal; however, these new ships represented a "new level of naval strength" for the IJN, and they made all previous Japanese capital ship obsolete. This meant that any naval planner aiming for an eight-eight fleet would have to call for seven more battleships and four more battlecruisers<ref name="Conway's223"/> when Japan was trying to weather a world economic depression.<ref name="Conway's222"/>

After proposals from the IJN in 1911 and 1912 for massive shipbuilding programs, the Cabinet compromised down to a "four-four" plan; under this, three new battleships and no new battlecruisers were authorized.<ref>Gardiner and Gray (1984), pp. 222<U+2013>223</ref> However, the Navy did not agree, and instead called for an "eight-four" fleet, while the Imperial Defence Council called for the original eight-eight. The Cabinet relented, and by July 1914, it was decided to go first for an eight-four fleet, followed by the eight-eight fleet. The eight-four plan was presented to the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] in 1915; it planned to have the eight battleships and four battlecruisers by 1923 with the building of two {{Sclass|Nagato|battleship|0}} and two ''Tosa''-class battleships.<ref>Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 224</ref>

== Construction, cancellation and fates ==
[[File:Japanese battleship Tosa.jpg|thumb|right|''Tosa'', partly constructed, being towed from Nagasaki in 1922]]
The ships were laid down in 1920, with ''Tosa'' being laid down on 16 February 1920 at the [[Mitsubishi]] shipyard in [[Nagasaki]], and ''Kaga'' following on 19 July 1920 at the [[Kawasaki]] shipyard in [[Kobe]]. Both were launched a little less than two years after they were laid down; ''Tosa'' on 18 December 1921 and ''Kaga'' on 17 November 1921. Even though ''Tosa'' was laid down first, she was scheduled to be completed in March 1923 while ''Kaga''{{'}}s planned completion date was 25 December 1922.<ref name="Conways232" /> However, the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]] intervened; this mandated the cancellation of all naval ships under construction, including the two ''Tosa'' class battleships;<ref>See: [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Washington_Naval_Treaty,_1922#SECTION_II_REPLACEMENT_AND_SCRAPPING_OF_CAPITAL_SHIPS Washington Naval Treaty, Chapter II, Part III, Section II]</ref> construction stopped on both ships on 5 February 1922. After being stricken on 1 April 1924, ''Tosa'' was expended as a [[target ship|target]] in the [[Bungo Channel]]s on 9 February 1925; she was used as practice for naval gunfire and to test her armor scheme against mines and torpedoes. Accounts of these tests mention that shells struck the ship below the waterline, which could explain later IJN interest in internal armor;<ref name="Conways232" /> the results from all of these tests was used to design the protection of the {{Sclass|Yamato|battleship|6}}s.<ref>Gardiner and Chesneau (1980), p. 172</ref>

It was originally planned that ''Kaga'' would be scrapped. However, {{Ship|Japanese battlecruiser|Amagi||2}}, one of the two {{Sclass|Amagi|battlecruiser|4}} battlecruisers which were being converted to [[aircraft carrier]]s, was severely damaged in the [[1923 Great Kant<U+014D> earthquake|Great Kant<U+014D> earthquake]] in 1923 and rendered unusable.<ref name="Conways232" /> This meant that her conversion under the terms of the treaty<ref group=A>See: [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Washington_Naval_Treaty,_1922#Article_IX Washington Naval Treaty, Chapter I, Article IX]</ref> was impossible, so ''Kaga'' was reordered as a carrier in her stead; the conversion took 5 years (1923<U+2013>28).<ref name=Poolman120>Poolman (1997), p. 120</ref>

[[File:Japanese Navy Aircraft Carrier Kaga 1928.jpg|thumb|left|''Kaga'' under construction in Yokosuka naval yard in November 1928]]
As originally completed, ''Kaga'' seemed to combine the concept of an aircraft carrier with a cruiser; she mounted a cruiser-like ten {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}}/50 caliber guns (four mounted dually, six mounted singly) and had a [[Belt armor|belt]] that was {{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The carrier officially [[Displacement|displaced]] about 29,600&nbsp;[[tonne|t]], although the actual figure was likely closer to 30,000&nbsp;t;<ref name="Conway's180">Gardiner and Chesneau (1980), p. 180</ref> she was capable of steaming for {{convert|8000|nmi|km}} when going {{convert|14|knots|km/h}}, though she was able to go at a maximum of {{convert|27.5|knots|km/h}} if needed.<ref>Fontenoy (2006), p. 214</ref> Similar to the former ''Amagi'' class carrier {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}}, ''Kaga'' was fitted with two flying-off decks "stepped down" from a flight deck that extended two-thirds of the ship; in theory, this allowed planes to take off directly from the hangars while other planes landed on the top. However, because operations proved dangerous and were impossible to conduct in rough weather, a 1935 reconstruction removed the lower two decks and extended the top flight deck to the bow.<ref name=Poolman120/>

After the reconstruction, ''Kaga'' officially displaced 38,200&nbsp;t standard; better boilers allowed her to obtain a top speed of around {{convert|28|knots|km/h}}, and the aircraft capacity was raised to 90. Interestingly, the ten 8-inch guns, although now all mounted singly, were retained.<ref name="Conway's180"/> After supporting operations in China, ''Kaga'' took part in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941.<ref name=NHC>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-fornv/japan/japsh-k/kaga.htm |title=''Kaga'' (Aircraft Carrier, 1927-1942) |accessdate=18 January 2009 |dateformat=dmy |last= |first= |date=6 April 1999 |work= |publisher=[[Naval Historical Center]] }}</ref><ref>Fontenoy (2006), p. 215</ref> She covered [[amphibious assault]]s for the first three months of 1942, although she hit a reef in February. After receiving repairs for that damage in April, she sailed to support the landings on Midway; however, the IJN was surprised by the appearance of three U.S. carriers, beginning the [[Battle of Midway]]. Due in part to [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Isoroku Yamamoto's]] plan, in which ships were dispersed and not close enough to mutually support one another, ''Kaga'', along with the other three carriers present, were sunk by U.S. aircraft from {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}},  {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}} and {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|2}}.<ref name=NHC/>
