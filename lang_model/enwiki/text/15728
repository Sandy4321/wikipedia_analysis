'''Hurricane Erika''' was the strongest and longest-lasting [[tropical cyclone]] in the [[1997 Atlantic hurricane season]].  Erika developed from a [[tropical wave]] on September 3 and moved west-northwestward across the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]]; it steadily intensified until it attained [[Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale|hurricane status]] on September 4, becoming the fifth named storm, third hurricane, and only major hurricane of the [[Atlantic hurricane season|season]]. Erika passed a short distance to the north of the [[Lesser Antilles]], and later turned to the north in response to an approaching [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. The hurricane quickly strengthened to reach maximum sustained winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) on September 8; after maintaining its peak strength for 24&nbsp;hours, Erika began to weaken as it passed over cooler waters. It turned to the east, weakened to a [[tropical storm]], and became extratropical after passing near the [[Azores]] [[archipelago]].

The hurricane produced light rainfall and winds throughout the northern [[Lesser Antilles]]. The passage of Erika carried a cloud of [[volcanic ash]] to [[Antigua]] from the eruption of the [[Soufri<U+00E8>re Hills|Soufri<U+00E8>re Hills Volcano]] on [[Montserrat]], a rare occurrence. Strong waves from the hurricane produced [[beach erosion]] and coastal flooding in northern [[Puerto Rico]], and caused the death of two surfers. Moderate wind gusts in northern [[Leeward Islands]] and [[Puerto Rico]] left thousands of residents without power, and resulted in $10&nbsp;million (1997&nbsp;USD, $12.6&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD) in damage in the [[Insular area#Uninhabited|Caribbean territory]] of the [[United States]]. Erika also produced gusty winds and light rain in the Azores. Erika was the only tropical cyclone in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the months of August and September, the first occurrence of such event in an [[Atlantic hurricane season]] since [[1929 Atlantic hurricane season|1929]].<ref name="septmon">{{cite web|author=Miles Lawrence|date=1997-10-01|title=September Monthly Tropical Weather Summary|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-11-12|url=http://mpittweather.com/txt/sept97atl.txt|format=TXT}}</ref>

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Erika 1997 track.png}}
A large [[tropical wave]], which eventually became Erika, moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on August 31. Shortly after leaving the coast, it displayed of a large low-level [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]], though as it tracked westward, the circulation failed to contract significantly. It slowly organized, and by September 3 the [[convection]] within the circulation had sufficiently organized for the system to be classified as [[Tropical Depression]] Six, while located about 1150&nbsp;miles (1850&nbsp;km) east of the southernmost [[Lesser Antilles]]. The depression moved west-northwestward at approximately 20&nbsp;mph (32&nbsp;km/h) under the influence of a well-established [[subtropical ridge]], and late on September 3 the system intensified into a [[tropical storm]]. At that time, the [[National Hurricane Center]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] gave the storm the name of ''[[Erika (given name)|Erika]]''.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Miles B. Lawrence|date=1997-10-24|title=Hurricane Erika Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-10-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1997erika.html}}</ref>

Erika continued to the west-northwest, and early on September 4, an [[eye (cyclone)|eye-like feature]] appeared to have developed in the center of the deep convection. The feature was not an eye, though, as visible [[satellite imagery]] revealed a center partially exposed from the convection. Despite unfavorable [[wind shear]], Erika strengthened further and intensified into a hurricane late on September 4, while located 530&nbsp;miles (850&nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Guadeloupe]]. Deep convection re-developed near the center, and the hurricane slowly strengthened as it continued west-northwestward. Hurricane Erika decelerated its forward motion as it approached the Lesser Antilles, and passed within 85&nbsp;miles (135&nbsp;km) of the islands as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1 hurricane]]. An approaching [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] weakened the subtropical ridge, resulting in Erika turning to the north and later to the northeast. On September 7, Erika began to quickly intensify, and the hurricane reached its peak strength of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) on September 8, while located about 350&nbsp;miles (565&nbsp;km) north of the Lesser Antilles. Erika maintained peak intensity for about 24&nbsp;hours before weakening over cooler waters.<ref name="tcr"/>

After passing about 350&nbsp;miles (565&nbsp;km) east of [[Bermuda]] on September 10, Erika turned to the east-northeast in response to westerly steering currents. Increased upper-level [[wind shear]] weakened the hurricane to a tropical storm on September 12. Erika continued to weaken as it turned to the east-southeast, though it maintained deep convection near the center despite unfavorable atmospheric conditions. On September 14 the storm turned to the northeast again, and re-strengthened to reach winds of {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} while located 510&nbsp;miles (820&nbsp;km) west-southwest of the [[Azores]]. On September 15 Erika passed near the western Azores islands, and quickly weakened as deep convection diminished. Erika became an [[extratropical cyclone]] on September 16 north of the Azores, and after executing a clockwise loop, the extratropical storm dissipated on September 19 about 230&nbsp;miles (370&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Ireland]].<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
[[Image:Erika-1997-pic.gif|right|thumb|Erika near the [[Lesser Antilles]]]]
Early in its path, forecasting Erika's motion was difficult, with a persistent leftward bias in official forecasts. In response to Erika's threat, the government of [[Saint Martin]] first issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] late on September 4. The next day, the respective governments of [[Antigua]], [[Montserrat]], [[Barbuda]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Anguilla]], [[Dominica]], [[Guadeloupe]], and [[Saint Barthelemy]] issued tropical storm warnings for their islands. When Erika's motion resulted in a path that would take it closer to the islands, all of the aforementioned islands excluding Guadeloupe upgraded the tropical storm warning to a hurricane warning. In addition, a hurricane watch was issued for the [[British Virgin Islands|British]] and [[United States Virgin Islands]], as well as [[Puerto Rico]]. In public advisories, the [[National Hurricane Center]] stated tropical storm conditions were likely to be experienced in the [[Azores]].<ref name="tcr"/> Early forecasts anticipated a threat to the island of [[Bermuda]].<ref name="erikareuter">{{cite web|author=Reuters|date=1997-09-10|title=Hurricane Erika Swirls out over Atlantic|accessdate=2006-11-12|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/ACOS-64CTN5?OpenDocument|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060311064346/http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/ACOS-64CTN5?OpenDocument|archivedate=2006-03-11}}</ref>

The governments of the islands in the predicted path of Erika urged residents to quickly prepare for the hurricane through radio addresses.In the wake of busy seasons in [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995]] and [[1996 Atlantic hurricane season|1996]], which some islands were still recovering from, emergency preparations began.<ref name=Faul>{{cite news|author=Michelle Faul|agency=Associated Press|date=1997-09-06|title=Hurricane Erika Headed for Montserrat, Antigua|accessdate=2011-10-25|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/165298/}}</ref> In [[Puerto Rico]], fishermen secured their boats in preparation for the storm. Also on the island, citizens formed long lines at gas stations and purchased emergency supplies. Officials in [[Anguilla]] enacted a plan that would turn off the island's power supply if the winds exceeded 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="syr96">{{Cite news|author=Syracuse Post-Standard|date=1997-09-06|title=Islanders, yachters prepare for the wrath of Hurricane Erika}}</ref>  As a precaution, authorities on [[Saint Martin]] enacted a curfew for all but those in service jobs.<ref name="reliefweb1">{{cite web|author=Suzanne Gordon|date=1997-09-06|title=Hurricane Erika Spares Leeward Islands|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2006-11-12|url=http://wwwnotes.reliefweb.int/w/rwb.nsf/480fa8736b88bbc3c12564f6004c8ad5/6c8c1b8ea3bd925bc125650c004e5a97?OpenDocument|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927185134/http://wwwnotes.reliefweb.int/w/rwb.nsf/480fa8736b88bbc3c12564f6004c8ad5/6c8c1b8ea3bd925bc125650c004e5a97?OpenDocument|archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref>

==Impact==
Hurricane Erika produced strong waves and high low-level winds throughout the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Just weeks after the eruption of the [[Soufri<U+00E8>re Hills|Soufri<U+00E8>re Hills Volcano]] on [[Montserrat]], the storm blew a cloud of falling ash over Antigua. Tropical storm-force winds affected several of the island in the Lesser Antilles.<ref name="tcr"/>

Winds from Hurricane Erika peaked at 37&nbsp;mph (60&nbsp;km/h) with a gust of 47&nbsp;mph (76&nbsp;km/h) in the [[Cyril E. King Airport]] on [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]]. The outer rainbands produced light to moderate rainfall in the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]], peaking at 3.28&nbsp;inches (83&nbsp;mm) at the [[University of the Virgin Islands]] in Saint Thomas and 1.32&nbsp;inches (36&nbsp;mm) in [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]]. The precipitation produced localized street flooding, while the combination of winds and rain caused power interruptions. Offshore, strong waves capsized one [[dinghy]] and broke a 50-foot (15&nbsp;m) boat from its moorings.<ref name="vincdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=2006-11-11|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~315261|year=1997|title=Event Report for the Virgin Islands}}</ref> On [[Saint Croix]], the hurricane produced sustained winds of 25&nbsp;mph (40&nbsp;km/h) and a peak wind gust of 29&nbsp;mph (46&nbsp;km/h) at the [[Henry E. Rohlsen International Airport]]. Rainfall on the island was light, peaking at 0.83&nbsp;inches (21&nbsp;mm) at [[Christiansted, U.S. Virgin Islands|Christiansted]]. The wind gusts downed a few power lines, and damage was minor.<ref name="scncdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=1997|title=Event Report for St. Croix|accessdate=2006-11-11|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~315262}}</ref>

The outer [[rainband]]s of Erika passed over [[Puerto Rico]], producing maximum sustained winds of 23&nbsp;mph (37&nbsp;km/h) and a peak wind gust of 42&nbsp;mph (68&nbsp;km/h) at the [[Luis Mu<U+00F1>oz Mar<U+00ED>n International Airport]]. The wind gusts snapped tree branches into power lines, leaving up to 12,000&nbsp;people without power in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Guaynabo, Puerto Rico|Guaynabo]] and [[Bayamon, Puerto Rico|Bayamon]]. Rainfall was light on the island, with [[Caguas]] reporting a peak total of 0.77&nbsp;inches (20&nbsp;mm). The hurricane produced swells of 10 to 12&nbsp;ft (3 to 3.7&nbsp;m) on the northern coast of Puerto Rico, causing beach erosion or coastal flooding. One road was closed when sections of it were flooded or washed out. The strong waves forced the evacuation of eight families in the northern portion of the island.<ref name="prncdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=1997|title=Event Report for Puerto Rico|accessdate=2006-11-11|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~315259}}</ref> The strong waves killed two surfers in the northeastern waters of the island.<ref name="tcr"/> Damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands totaled to $10&nbsp;million (1997&nbsp;USD, $12.6&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD) in a preliminary estimate.<ref name="usatoday">{{cite news|author=Usatoday.com|year=1997|title=Erika swipes Caribbean, hits Azores|accessdate=2006-11-12|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/werika.htm| work=USA Today | date=1999-06-11 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ybqzB7B1|archivedate=2011-05-11}}</ref>

Thirty-one ships encountered Erika from September 4, when it was a tropical storm, to September 18, when it was extratropical. Two recorded hurricane force winds, with a peak wind report of {{convert|99|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The lowest recorded pressure by a ship was 1000.4&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.542&nbsp;[[inHg]]) while located 105&nbsp;miles (170&nbsp;km) from Erika as an extratropical storm. The lowest recorded pressure while Erika was a tropical cyclone was 1000.5&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.545&nbsp;inHg) while located 190&nbsp;miles (305&nbsp;km) from the center. While passing near the [[Azores]], Tropical Storm Erika produced maximum sustained winds of 30&nbsp;mph (48&nbsp;km/h) at [[Lajes Field]]. Gusts were much stronger, with a report of 87&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h) in [[Flores]]. In addition, a 200&nbsp;ft (61&nbsp;m) tower on [[Lajes (Praia da Vit<U+00F3>ria)|Lajes]] recorded a gust of 105&nbsp;mph (169&nbsp;km/h). The storm dropped up to 2.35&nbsp;inches (60&nbsp;mm) of rain in Flores<ref name="tcr"/> and produced rough seas throughout the archipelago. Damage, if any, is unknown in the Azores.<ref name="usatoday"/>
