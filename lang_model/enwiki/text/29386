The audio rights has been bought by [[T-Series]].<ref>[http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2010/apr/070410-Ranbir-Kapoor-A-R-Rahman-Rockstar-Imitaz-Ali.htm Ranbir-Rahman get jammin'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> According to Rahman, "''Rockstar'' is a character driven film and as one can guess from the title, there will be lots of guitar." In brief, the music will have very different vibrations. [[Neeraj Shridhar]] and [[Rahat Fateh Ali Khan]] will associate with Rahman for the first time through this film. Italian-Canadian singer Natalie Di Luccio has recorded two songs for the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Nothing-gets-Rahman-worked-up/Article1-707089.aspx|title=Nothing gets Rahman worked up|date=June 2011|publisher=''Hindustan Times''|accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref> [[A.

Ranbir had travelled to Chennai and stayed with Rahman for a week in order to "feel the song imbibe and absorb it" so that when he finally performs it, "the song would be an extension of his personality."<ref>[http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/2011/04/18/15650/index.html "Ranbir Kapoor rushes to Chennai for the recording of climax song of Rockstar"].
