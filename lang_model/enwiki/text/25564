Composed and produced by [[Martin O'Donnell]] and [[Michael Salvatori]] for [[Bungie Studios]], the soundtrack was released on [[June 11]], [[2002]]. Most of the music from ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' is present on the CD, although some songs have been remixed by O'Donnell in medley form for "more enjoyable" listening.<ref name=album/> The first piece O'Donnell wrote, known as "Halo", became the basis for ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]''{{'}}s "signature sound" which has been heard in the other games of the [[Halo (series)#Main trilogy|main trilogy]].

The soundtrack features a wide range of musical styles, including chanting, string orchestra, and percussion. Upon release, the soundtrack was well received by critics. Some complimented the wide range of musical styles, while most agreed that playing the game is not required to enjoy the soundtrack. A special edition of the soundtrack was released on [[October 28]] [[2003]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://music.msn.com/album/?album=39728620&|title= Halo: Original Soundtrack|accessdate=2008-06-26 |publisher= [[MSN]]|date= }}</ref> featuring a [[DVD]] with a trailer, demo movie, and high quality music for ''[[Halo 2]]''.

==Background==
As the audio director for [[Bungie]], [[Martin O'Donnell]] was tasked with writing the music for ''Halo: Combat Evolved''.<ref name=ancient>{{cite web|author=Carlson|year=2001|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/h/halo/themakers3.htm|title=Just the Right Sense of "Ancient"|publisher=Xbox.com|accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref> He had scored previous Bungie projects, including ''[[Riven|Riven: The Sequel to Myst]]'' and ''[[Myth (computer game series)|Myth: The Fallen Lords]]'', while working for his audio company, TotalAudio, along with [[Michael Salvatori]].<ref name=ancient/><ref name=BungieCast>{{cite web |url= http://download.microsoft.com/download/d/8/5/d85ce76f-0cb2-41df-aaae-a8c96790332b/Bungie_Podcast_121207.mp3|title= Podcast Ep. 51: With Martin O'Donnell|accessdate=2008-06-21 |author= O'Connor, Frank; O'Donnell, Martin; Smith, Luke; Jarrard, Brian|date= 2007-12-12|work= |publisher=[[Bungie.net]]}}</ref> O' Donnell was nervous about the project, saying he approached it, "with fear and trepidation".<ref name=ancient/> O'Donnell stated his main influences were music he liked<U+2014>"a little [[Samuel Barber]] meets [[Giorgio Moroder]]".<ref name=ancient/> Bungie's Director of cinematics, [[Joseph Staten]] told O'Donnell, "the music should give a feeling of importance, weight, and sense of the "ancient" to the visuals of Halo".<ref name=ancient/> O' Donnell's first piece of music, "Halo", which would become the "the signature theme for ''Halo''", was written and recorded in three days.<ref name=ancient/> O'Donnell recruited Salvatori and three other colleagues he had recorded jingles with<U+2014>Robert Bowker, Jeffrey Morrow, and Rob Trow<U+2014>to produce the "chanting monks" that open the piece. Originally, he had intended the [[Qawwali]] accents to be sung by one of the professionals, but after singing an example of what he wanted, the others suggested using O'Donnell's own rendition instead.<ref name=ancient/> The theme premiered at the [[Macworld Conference & Expo#1999|1999 Macworld Conference & Expo]] demonstration of ''Halo: Combat Evolved''.<ref name=ancient/>

The remaining themes were simultaneously written, recorded, and produced from July to September of 1999.<ref name=ancient/> The music was written with a variety of equipment including, "keyboards, synths, and samplers as well as digital recording equipment controlled by computers".<ref name=ancient/> Live instrumentations, from members of the [[Chicago Symphony]] and Chicago Lyric Opera Orchestra, were added where needed.<ref name=ancient/><ref name=TotalAudio>{{cite web|author=[[Martin O'Donnell|O'Donnell, Martin]], [[Halo.Bungie.Org|Wu, Louis]]|year=1999|url=http://nikon.bungie.org/music.html|title=TotalAudio Questions and Answers|work=[[Halo.Bungie.Org]]|accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref> The soundtrack features a wide range of sounds, O'Donnell described it as, "[[Gregorian chant]], string orchestra, percussion and just a bit of a 'Qawwali voice'".<ref name=ancient/> Working closely with level designers, O'Donnell divided the music "into chunks". Based on these "chunks", "[''Halo''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s] audio engine could play [the music] back dynamically based on the player's actions".<ref name=ancient/> For the soundtrack release, O'Donnell rearranged the music featured in the game in order to make listening to the soundtrack "more enjoyable".<ref name=album/>

==Reception==
Reception of the soundtrack was generally positive from critics. [[IGN]] praised the soundtrack for its wide use of instruments stating, "Where other videogame scores tend to miss their mark when combining electronic and organic elements, O'Donnell and Salvatori seem to have found a rather stable balance between the two divergent sounds." Adding, overall, the soundtrack is "one of the better videogame oriented musical experiences out there" and playing the game is not required to find enjoyment within the score.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://music.ign.com/articles/822/822717p1.html|title= Halo Original Soundtrack|accessdate=2008-05-30 |author= Spence D.|date= 2007-09-24|work= |publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> Reviewing for Monsters At Play, Michael Johnson called the soundtrack "66 minutes of orchestral goodness" citing the wide range of music covered as a strong point.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://games.monstersatplay.com/review/soundtrack/halo.php|title= Halo Original Soundtrack|accessdate=2008-05-30 |author= Michael Johnson|date= |work= |publisher=Monsters at Play}}</ref> Nuketown gave the soundtrack  9 out of 10, stating, "the soundtrack is a welcome and invigorating reminder of good times had blasting unstoppable alien hordes".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nuketown.com/node/489|title= Halo: The Soundtrack|accessdate=2008-05-30 |author= Kenneth Newquist |date= 2004-09-09|work= |publisher=Nuketown}}</ref>
