'''''The Simpsons''''' is an American [[cartoon series|animated]] [[sitcom]] created by [[Matt Groening]] for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The series is a [[satire|satirical]] parody of a [[working class]] American lifestyle epitomized by its [[Simpson family|family]] of the same name, which consists of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. The show is set in the fictional city of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], and lampoons [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], society, television and many aspects of the [[human condition]].

The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of [[The Simpsons shorts|animated shorts]] with the producer [[James L. Brooks]]. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the first Fox series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989<U+2013>1990).

Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the show has broadcast [[List of The Simpsons episodes|486 episodes]] and the [[The Simpsons (season 22)|twenty second season]] started airing on September 26, 2010. ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27, 2007, and grossed US$527 million worldwide.

''The Simpsons'' has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 27 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, 27 [[Annie Award]]s and a [[Peabody Award]]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's December 31, 1999 issue named it the 20th century's best television series, and on January 14, 2000 the Simpson family was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. ''The Simpsons'' is the [[List of longest running United States television series|longest-running]] American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in [[2009 in American television|2009]] it surpassed ''[[Gunsmoke#Television version|Gunsmoke]]'' as the longest running American primetime entertainment series. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase "[[D'oh!]]" has been adopted into the [[English lexicon]], while ''The Simpsons'' has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms.

==Origins==
{{Main|History of The Simpsons|The Simpsons shorts}}
Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]'s office. Brooks had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his ''[[Life in Hell]]'' series. However, when Groening realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require the rescinding of [[publication right]]s for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a [[dysfunctional family]].<ref name=inter>{{cite interview|last=Groening|first=Matt|subjectlink = Matt Groening| interviewer = David Bianculli| title = Fresh Air| program = [[National Public Radio]]| callsign = [[WHYY-FM|WHYY]]| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1162008| city = Philadelphia| date = 2003-02-14| accessdate = 2007-08-08}}</ref> He named the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart" for his own name, adapting an anagram of the word "brat".<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video|people=BBC|date=2000|title='The Simpsons': America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD)|format=DVD|location=UK|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

[[File:Simpsons on Tracey Ullman.png|thumb|left|The [[Simpson family]] as they first appeared in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'']]
The [[Simpson family]] first appeared as [[The Simpsons shorts|shorts]] in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on April 19, 1987.<ref name="goodnight">Richmond, p. 14</ref> Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/> One of the earliest jobs of the [[Klasky Csupo]] company was creating animated sequences for ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' which led to the start of The Simpsons.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The animated movie guide|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|year=2005|page=239|isbn=9781556525919}}</ref> The animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo,<ref name="animation">{{cite news |first=Harvey |last=Deneroff|title=Matt Groening's Baby Turns 10|publisher=Animation Magazine, Vol. 14, #1|date=January 2000|pages=10, 12}}</ref> with [[Wes Archer]], [[David Silverman]], and [[Bill Kopp]] being animators for the first season.<ref name="silverman"/> Gyorgyi Peluce was the colorist and the person who decided to make the characters yellow.<ref name="silverman"/>

In 1989, a team of production companies adapted ''The Simpsons'' into a half-hour series for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The team included what is now the [[Klasky Csupo]] animation house. Jim Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32|title='3rd Degree: Harry Shearer'|accessdate=2006-09-01|author=Kuipers, Dean|date=2004-04-15|publisher=Los Angeles: City Beat|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080308105912/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |archivedate = March 8, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called "the mainstream trash" that they were watching.<ref name="toonterrific">{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Tucker|title=Toon Terrific|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|date=1993-03-12|page=48(3)}}</ref> The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989 with "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]", a Christmas special.<ref name=officialsite>[http://www.thesimpsons.com/recaps/season1/#episode1 "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"] ''The Simpsons.com''.

With one exception, episode credits list only the [[voice actor]]s, and not the characters they voice. Both Fox and the production crew wanted to keep their identities secret during the early seasons and, therefore, closed most of the recording sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recording artists.<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; James L.

Up until 1998, the six main actors were paid [[American dollar|$]]30,000 per episode. In 1998 they were involved in a pay dispute with Fox. The company threatened to replace them with new actors, even going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The series creator Groening supported the actors in their action.<ref>{{cite news|first=Brian|last=Doherty|title=Matt Groening|publisher=''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]''|date=March/April 1999}}</ref> However, the issue was soon resolved and, from 1998 to 2004, they were paid $125,000 per episode. The show's revenue continued to rise through syndication and DVD sales, and in April 2004 the main cast stopped appearing for script readings, demanding they be paid $360,000 per episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/02/1080544690429.html|title=Simpsons actors demand bigger share|accessdate=2008-02-09|date=2004-04-03|author=Dan Glaister|publisher=[[The Age]]|location=Melbourne}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Rick|last=McGinnis|title=Star talks Simpsons|publisher=''[[Metro International|metro]]''|date=2004-08-09}}</ref> The strike was resolved a month later<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/01/entertainment/main615066.shtml|title='Simpsons' Cast Goes Back To Work|accessdate=2008-02-09|date=2004-05-01|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}</ref> and their salaries were increased to something between $250,000<ref>{{cite news|title=Meet the Simpsons|date=2004-05-06|accessdate=2008-02-09|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|Daily Express]]|author=Peter Sheridan}}</ref> and $360,000 per episode.<ref name=2008actors>{{cite news | author = Michael Schneider | title = Still no deal for 'Simpsons' cast | publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | date = 2008-05-19 | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117986121?refCatId=14 | accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> In 2008, production for the [[The Simpsons (season 20)|twentieth season]] was put on hold due to new contract negotiations with the voice actors, who wanted a "healthy bump" in salary to an amount close to $500,000 per episode.<ref name=2008actors/> The negotiations were soon completed, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode.<ref name="Strike">{{cite news | title = Simpsons cast sign new pay deal | publisher = [[BBC|BBC News]] | date = 2008-06-03 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7434296.stm | accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref>

==Characters==
{{Main|List of characters in The Simpsons}}
[[File:Simpsons cast.png|thumb|right|300px|''The Simpsons'' sports a vast array of secondary and tertiary characters.]]
The Simpsons are a typical family who live in a fictional "[[Middle America (United States)|Middle American]]" town of Springfield.<ref name="Turner28">Turner, p. 28</ref> Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], a position at odds with his careless, [[jester|buffoonish]] personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] American [[homemaker|housewife]] and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]], the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a [[pacifier]]. The family owns a dog, [[Santa's Little Helper]], and a cat, [[Snowball V]], renamed [[Snowball II]] in "[[I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot]]".<ref>{{cite episode| title=I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot| episodelink=I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot| series=The Simpsons| serieslink=The Simpsons| network=Fox| airdate=2004-01-11}}</ref> Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes. Despite the passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays, the Simpsons do not physically age and still appear just as they did at the end of the 1980s. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.<ref>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The show includes an array of quirky characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople and local celebrities. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokesters or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]''.<ref name="avclub1">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/|title=Matt Groening: Interview|accessdate=2006-10-22|author=Rabin, Nathan|date=2006-04-26|publisher=The A.V.

==Themes==

''The Simpsons'' uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town,<ref name="Turner28"/> serving as a [[satire|satirical]] parody of a [[working class]] American lifestyle.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Simpsons: Culture, Class and Popular TV|author=Flew, Terry|work=Metro|issue=97|date=1994-03-03|url=http://www.metromagazine.com.au/magazine/backisues.asp?keywords=cultu&whichpage=12&pagesize=15}}</ref> However, because of its animated nature, ''The Simpsons''' scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment.<ref>Turner, p. 55</ref> Through Bart and Lisa's days at [[Springfield Elementary School]], the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of media channels<U+2014>from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry.<ref>Turner, p. 388</ref>

Some commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a left-wing bias.<ref>Turner, pp. 221<U+2013>222</ref> [[Al Jean]] admitted in an interview that "We [the show] are of liberal bent."<ref name="turner223">Turner, p. 223</ref> The writers often evince an appreciation for liberal ideals, but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum.<ref>Turner, p. 224</ref> The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker.<ref name="turner223"/> Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In ''The Simpsons'', politicians are corrupt, ministers such as [[Reverend Lovejoy]] are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.<ref>Turner, p. 56</ref> Religion also figures as a recurring theme. In times of crisis, the family often turns to God, and the show has dealt with most of the major religions.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mark I|last=Pinsky|title=The Gospel According to Homer|publisher=''[[Orlando Sentinel]]''|date=1999-08-15}}</ref>

==Hallmarks==
===Opening sequence===
[[File:Simpsons couch gag.jpg|thumb|Extended couch gags, such as one featuring a large stage show, have been used to fill time in shorter episodes.]]
{{Main|The Simpsons opening sequence}}
''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[Title sequence|opening sequence]] is one of the show's most memorable hallmarks. Most episodes open with the camera zooming through the show's title towards the town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The opening was created by [[David Silverman]], the first task he did when production began on the show.<ref name=silverinter>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/interviews/silverman/page4.shtml|title=Top titles|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The series' distinctive [[The Simpsons Theme|theme song]] was [[composer|composed]] by musician [[Danny Elfman]] in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece. This piece has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.<ref name="elfman">{{cite web|url=http://elfman.filmmusic.com/elfman_la_times.html|title=Danny Elfman in the L.A. Times|accessdate=2006-07-03|last=Glionna|first=John M.|year=1999|publisher=Danny Elfman's Music For A Darkened People}}</ref>

One of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of the segments change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard,<ref name=silverinter/> Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone, and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch.<ref>Richmond, pp. 90<U+2013>91</ref> On February 15, 2009, a new opening credit sequence was introduced to accompany the switch to HDTV. The sequence had all of the features of the original opening, but added numerous details and characters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4682314/The-Simpsons-opening-sequence-changes.html|title='The Simpsons' opening sequence changes|last=Leonard|first=Tom|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2009-03-02|date=2009-02-17 | location=London}}</ref>

===Halloween episodes===
[[File:Bart Night Gallery.jpg|thumb|Bart introducing a segment of "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]" in the manner of [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Night Gallery]]''.]]
{{Main|Treehouse of Horror (series)}}
The special [[Halloween]] episode has become an annual tradition. "[[Treehouse of Horror]]" first broadcast in 1990 as part of [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] and established the pattern of three separate, self-contained stories in each Halloween episode.<ref name="BBCI">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season2/page3.shtml|title=The Simpsons Halloween Special|accessdate=2007-11-09|last=Martyn|first=Warren|last2=Wood|first=Adrian|year=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> These pieces usually involve the family in some [[Horror film|horror]], [[science fiction]], or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|page=31}}</ref> They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Although the ''Treehouse'' series is meant to be seen on Halloween, in recent years, new installments have premiered after Halloween due to [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]]'s current contract with [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Pick of the Day: The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror XVII|last=Ryan|first=Andrew|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=2006-11-04|page=12}}</ref>

===Humor===
The show's humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show.<ref name="referential">Turner pp. 63<U+2013>65</ref> Such references, for example, come from movies, television, music, literature, science, and history.<ref name="referential"/> The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show's background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, newspapers, and elsewhere.<ref name="turner62">Turner p. 62</ref> The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show.<ref name="turner62"/> Kristin Thompson argues that ''The Simpsons'' uses a "...flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show."<ref name="Thompson">{{cite book|last=King |first=Geoff|authorlink=Kristin Thompson|title=New Hollywood Cinema: An Introduction |accessdate=2007-12-18|date=2002-03-29|publisher=I B Tauris & Co|isbn=1860647502}}</ref>

One of Bart's early [[hallmark]]s were his prank calls to [[Moe's Tavern]] owner [[Moe Szyslak]] in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a [[gag name]]. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were based on a series of prank calls known as the [[Tube Bar prank calls|Tube Bar recordings]]. Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner [[Louis "Red" Deutsch]], whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent side.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hudsonreporter.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15354520&BRD=1291&PAG=461&dept_id=523586&rfi=6|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071218105842/http://www.hudsonreporter.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15354520&BRD=1291&PAG=461&dept_id=523586&rfi=6|archivedate=2007-12-18|title=Joke on 'Simpsons' started in JC|accessdate=2008-10-30|date=2005-08-10|publisher=''[[Hudson Reporter]]''|work=[[Jersey City Reporter]]|author=Kaulessar, Ricardo}}</ref> As the series progressed, it became more difficult for the writers to come up with a fake name and to write Moe's angry response, and the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season.<ref name="Some">[[James L.

The show uses [[catchphrases]], and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each.<ref>Turner p. 60</ref> Notable expressions include Homer's annoyed grunt "[[D'oh!]]", Mr. Burns' "Excellent..." and [[Nelson Muntz]]'s "''Ha''-ha!". Some of Bart's catchphrases, such as "''[[<U+00A1>Ay, caramba!]]''", "[[Don't have a cow]], man!" and "Eat my shorts!" appeared on t-shirts in the show's early days.<ref>Turner p. 25</ref> However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the [[merchandising]]. The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The episode "[[Bart Gets Famous]]" mocks catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the ''Krusty the Clown Show'' solely for saying "I didn't do it."<ref>Turner p. 61</ref>

==Influences on culture==
===Idioms===
A number of [[neologism]]s that originated on ''The Simpsons'' have entered popular vernacular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/beyond-doh-simpsons-quotes-for-everyday-use,1543/|title=Beyond "D'oh!": Simpsons Quotes For Everyday Use|author=Bahn, Christopher|coauthors=Donna Bowman, Josh Modell, Noel Murray, Nathan Rabin, Tasha Robinson, Kyle Ryan, Scott Tobias|accessdate=2006-07-03|date=2006-04-26|publisher=The A.V.

===Television===
''The Simpsons'' was the first successful animated program in American prime time since ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]'' in the 1970s.<ref>Alberti, p. xii.</ref> During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. ''The Simpsons'' changed this perception.<ref name="animation"/> The use of Korean animation studios for [[tweening]], coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of ''The Simpsons'' and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other animated series.<ref name="animation"/> This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows, such as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', and ''[[The Critic]]''.<ref name="animation"/> "''The Simpsons'' created an audience for prime-time animation that had not been there for many, many years", said ''[[Family Guy]]'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]. "As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways<U+2014>you could classify it as<U+2014>a wholly new medium."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/08/simpsons200708|accessdate=2008-10-18|date=August 2007|title=Simpson Family Values|author=John Ortved|publisher=''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''}}</ref> ''South Park'' later paid homage to ''The Simpsons'' with the episode "[[Simpsons Already Did It]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1647331,00.html|title=The Simpsons, Bigger and Better|accessdate=2007-08-01|date=2007-07-29|author=Richard Corliss|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''}}</ref> In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the animated television sitcom ''[[The Samsonadzes]]'', launched in November 2009, has been noted for its very strong resemblance with ''The Simpsons'', which its creator Shalva Ramishvili has acknowledged.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8494926.stm "Putin appears in Georgia's Simpsons-like cartoon show"].

In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, "That's so wrong.

The popularity of ''The Simpsons'' has made it a billion-dollar merchandizing industry.<ref name="mikescully"/> The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from t-shirts to posters. ''The Simpsons'' has inspired special editions of well-known board games, including [[Cluedo|Clue]], [[Scrabble]], [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], [[Operation (game)|Operation]], and [[The Game of Life]], as well as the [[trivia]] games What Would Homer Do? and [[Simpsons Jeopardy!]]. Several card games such as [[Trump (card game)|trump cards]] and [[The Simpsons Trading Card Game]] have also been released. Many official or unofficial ''Simpsons'' books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years.
