"'''Second Generation'''" is a 2006 [[television advertisement]] introducing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s [[Air Jordan XXI]] brand of [[basketball shoe]]s.<ref name=Nike>{{Citation |author=Nike, Inc. |date=15 February 2006 |title=Long-Anticipated Air Jordan XXI Release Takes Jordan Into The Next Generation Of Athletic Luxury Design And Technology |url=http://nikeinc.com/news/air-jordan-xxi-release |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> The ad depicts signature moves from [[Michael Jordan]]'s [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] career, recreated in the present day by twelve young basketball players around the world. Included are moments from the 1989, 1991, 1992, and 1998 [[NBA playoffs]] and the iconic 1992 [[slam dunk]].

The ad was produced by [[Smuggler (production company)|Smuggler]] and directed by Brian Beletic for the [[advertising agency]] [[Wieden+Kennedy]]. Casting began in November 2005, filming took place in January 2006, and the ad debuted on television that February. Advertising publications gave favorable reviews to "Second Generation", although it did not win major awards.

The ad is also listed as "'''2nd Generation'''"; its [[tagline]] is "'''Let your game speak'''".

==Production==
The ad was conceived by the agency Wieden+Kennedy. Copywriters Derek Barnes and Paul Renner were in a shopping mall when they noticed many of the youths around them wearing [[Air Jordan]] shoes, despite Jordan having retired in 2003: "Just one look around the food court, you knew kids still waved his flag."<ref>{{Citation |last=Renner |first=Paul |title=second coming |url=http://rennerexit10.com/work/second_coming.html |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> The creative directors were Kevin Proudfoot and Todd Waterbury.<ref name=SHOOT /> Waterbury explained, "We thought of the fact that a version of him is alive in everyone that loves basketball. And there are moments in Jordan's career where you just say the move, or the game, and people who love the man, and love the sport, immediately can imagine that scene. Here, we were just taking advantage of those incredible moments."<ref name=Rovell />

Wieden+Kennedy hired [[Brian Beletic]] to direct the ad. W+K art director Jesse Coulter said of choosing Beletic, "He gets it. He brings the flavor."<ref name=BeingLikeMike /> The music was composed by [[Jonathan Elias]] and David Wittman of Elias Arts.<ref name=SHOOT />

[[Casting call]]s were held in three U.S. cities.<ref name=BeingLikeMike>{{Citation |author=RH |date=April 2006 |title=Being Like Mike; Wieden + Kennedy Replicates Jordan's Signature Moves |work=[[Creativity (magazine)|Creativity]] |volume=14 |issue=4 |page=42 |id={{Factiva|ADAGEC0020060429e2410000y}}}}</ref> A November 2005 ad put out by Ulysses Terrero and T&T Casting asked for "[BOYS] All ethnicities, ages 13-21, with amazing basketball skills - amazing enough to recreate some of Michael Jordan's greatest moments on the basketball court."<ref name=casting>{{Citation |author=T&T Casting |date=21 November 2005 |title=BOYS /13-21/basketball skills/ commercial /LA |publisher=aimoo.com |url=http://forum1.aimoo.com/ECAforum/postforum-21230/topicname-topic/replytopic-318782/pageindex-1/newpost.html |accessdate=9 November 2011}}</ref> Some 350 young basketball players auditioned over eight days; Beletic recalls the process as "an absurd amount of casting".<ref name=Defy /> The main challenge was in finding players who could match Jordan's jumping ability; the toughest shots were cast for older players.<ref name=BeingLikeMike /> Casting was also complicated by the amateurism rules of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA): anyone who might play [[college basketball]] in the future couldn't appear in the ad.<ref name=Defy>{{Citation |last=Fera |first=Rae Ann |date=May 2006 |title=Defy categorization: Brian Beletic finds that the more things change, the more they stay the same |work=[[Boards (magazine)|Boards]] |url=http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20060501/beletic.html |accessdate=10 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006115056/http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20060501/beletic.html |archivedate=October 6, 2008 |id={{Factiva|BOARD00020060530e25100004}}}}</ref>

Filming took place in [[Los Angeles]] in January 2006.<ref name=Rovell /><ref name=casting /> The action is set in the present day, across the world; various scenes take place in [[Africa]], [[China]], [[Chicago]], and [[New York City]].<ref name=BeingLikeMike /> Each scene is a few seconds long, depicting a young basketball player recreating a famous Jordan moment in [[slow motion]]. The actors were not shown footage of the moves they were performing; rather, their performances were based on their own memories. The staff then "fine-tuned" the scenes for accuracy.<ref name=Rovell />

==Sequence==
The ad opens on a young man [[dribbling]] in place. The music starts with a simple [[ostinato]] [[C (musical note)|C]]<U+2013>[[G (musical note)|G]]<U+2013>[[B<U+266D> (musical note)|B{{music|flat}}]]<U+2013>C line played by a muted synth bass. At 0:05, a young man wags his tongue while dribbling. This is a signature move of Jordan's.<ref name=SHOOT>{{Citation |date=3 March 2006 |title=Dir. Brian Beletic Captures Youngsters Capturing MJ's Classic Basketball Moves |work=[[SHOOT]]online |publisher=DCA Business Media |url=http://www.shootonline.com/node/33883 |accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=Rovell>{{Citation |last=Rovell |first=Darren |authorlink=Darren Rovell |date=2 March 2006 |title=The Jumpman in us all |work=[[Page 2]] |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=rovel/060302 |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> At 0:09, a player drives to the basket with his tongue hanging out. He recreates a moment from the [[1991 NBA Finals]], game 2: Jordan scored a layup after switching hands in midair to avoid [[Sam Perkins]] of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].<ref name=SHOOT />

The music starts growing in complexity, adding violins and a new bass line as a piano takes over the ostinato. At 0:13, the camera shows a young man chewing gum.<ref name=Rovell /> At 0:15, a young man spreads his arms in a defensive stance. His jersey is colored red, yellow, and black to evoke Africa.<ref name=Rovell /> At 0:21, an Asian boy palms the basketball.<ref name=Rovell /> At 0:22, a young woman shoots a fall away jumper.<ref name=SHOOT />

The music adds a second violin line and a [[snare drum]] cadence. At 0:25, a young man performs a "rock the cradle" [[slam dunk]]. At 0:29, a young man recreates Jordan's [[free throw line dunk]] from the <!--Rovell says 1987; this is apparently a typo.--> [[1988 NBA All-Star Game]] [[NBA All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest|Slam Dunk Contest]]. This is the only shot where the original scenery is imitated. The set colors match the colors of the [[Chicago Stadium]], and the crowd is spaced out in the same way as the crowd during Jordan's dunk; they nevertheless wear modern clothes, as the ad is set in the present.<ref name=SHOOT /><ref name=Rovell /> The intent is that by this point, the viewer is aware of the significance of each shot. Waterbury said, "We built the action in a way so that it created tension in the spot. As the commercial continues to build, the viewer will recognize scene after scene after scene."<ref name=Rovell />

At 0:35, the camera cuts to the aftermath of [[The Shot]]. A young man jumps in the air and pumps his fist as another young man in an opposing jersey sinks to the floor. The moment is from the [[1989 NBA Playoffs]], when Jordan hit a game-winning jump shot over [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] [[guard (basketball)|guard]] [[Craig Ehlo]].<ref name=SHOOT /><ref name=Rovell /> At 0:38 is Jordan's last shot with the [[Chicago Bulls]], after a [[crossover dribble]] past [[Utah Jazz]] guard [[Bryon Russell]] at the end of [[Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals]].<ref name=SHOOT /><ref name=Rovell /> These scenes are musically punctuated with a bass drum roll and a cymbal crash. Finally, at 0:44 a young man shrugs after hitting a shot, as Jordan shrugged after scoring six [[three-point field goal]]s in the first half of Game 1 of the [[1992 NBA Finals]] against the [[Portland Trail Blazers]].<ref name=SHOOT />

The rhythm of the music pauses for two beats. It resumes at a calmer level as the camera shows Jordan in street clothes, watching from the sideline. Jordan is shown for just two seconds, smiling and nodding. Waterbury said of this shot, "We wanted to make sure that, through this commercial, people understood Michael's role as a mentor and a coach. His nod of approval at the end is his way of saying, 'Go.'"<ref name=Rovell /> The camera cuts back to the young player; the tagline "LET YOUR GAME SPEAK" is shown, and the scene fades to black with the "XXI" logo and then the [[Jumpman (logo)|"Jumpman" logo]].<ref name=SHOOT />

==Reception==
The ad received positive reviews from advertising publications. It listed by ''[[Adweek]]'' as the "Ad of the Day" and as one of the "Best Spots of February 2006".<ref>{{Citation |author=Adweek Staff |date=1 February 2006 |title=Second Generation |work=adweek.com |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/second-generation-129536}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Parpis |first=Eleftheria |author2=Adweek Staff |date=13 March 2006 |title=Best Spots of February 2006 |work=adweek.com |url=https://secure.adweek.com/aw/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002200279 |accessdate=5 November 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/Zi7c |archivedate=17 December 2012}}</ref> ''[[SHOOT]]'' named the ad their "Top Spot of the Week".<ref name=SHOOT /> [[ESPN]]'s [[Darren Rovell]] wrote that "it deserves to be considered at the top of the list" of Jordan's more than 400 commercials.<ref name=Rovell /> ''[[Creativity (magazine)|Creativity]]'' called the ad "impeccably executed", and ''[[Boards (magazine)|Boards]]'' called it "so rich in detail that it entices in an instant".<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Staff |date=May 2006 |title=Top of the heap: Our annual look at directors in demand |work=[[Boards (magazine)|Boards]] |id={{Factiva|BOARD00020060530e2510000m}}}}</ref> ''Second Generation'' did not win any major industry awards. Another Nike/W+K/Smuggler effort in August 2006, ''[[Pretty (advertisement)|Pretty]]'' starring [[Maria Sharapova]], would fare much better in that category.<ref>{{cite web|last=Diaz|first=Ann-Christine|title=Film Grand Prix goes to dove "Evolution"|url=http://creativity-online.com/news/film-grand-prix-goes-to-dove-evolution/118806|work=[[Creativity (magazine){{!}}Creativity]]|accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref>

On February 27, 2006, an anonymous Jordan fan uploaded a breakdown of the ad on [[YouTube]], showing it side-by-side with the original footage.<ref>{{YouTube|id=SZjbTq4DcAQ|title=Jordan XXI Spot + Original Jordan Moves}}</ref> In an interview, Beletic commented on this video: "It is pretty awesome to watch."<ref name=Noisemakers>{{Citation |author=AD |date=June 2006 |title=The Noisemakers |work=[[Creativity (magazine)|Creativity]] |volume=14 |issue=6 |page=57 |id={{Factiva|ADAGEC0020060616e2610000d}}}}</ref>
