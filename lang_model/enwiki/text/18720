'''"Not Ready to Make Nice"''' is a [[country music|country]]-[[pop music|pop]] song written and performed by the [[United States|American]] [[All-women band|all-female band]] [[Dixie Chicks]] for their seventh [[studio album]] ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' ([[2006]]). The song was released as the first physical [[single (music)|single]] from the album in March 2006.

In [[February 11]], [[2007]], it won three [[Grammy Awards]] in the categories of [[Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], and [[Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]. <ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003544431 "Dixie Chicks Soar, Blige, Chili Peppers Win Big At Grammys"]. Jonathan Cohen, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. February 12, 2007. Retrieved November 24, 2007.</ref>

==Song information==
''Taking the Long Way'' was the first studio album released by the Dixie Chicks after controversy erupted over them in [[2003]] following a critical comment vocalist [[Natalie Maines]] made of the [[President of the United States|American President]] [[George W. Bush]] while performing in a concert in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. The controversy and the band reaction to it is the major theme of some of the songs in the album, including "Not Ready to Make Nice".

The song, which was written by all three band members (Maines, [[Emily Robison]] and [[Martie Maguire]]) along with [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]], is a statement of how they feel over the controversy, the banning of their songs from country music radio stations, and [[freedom of speech]]. 

The band went on to the [[October 25]] episode of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' to promote their [[documentary film]] ''[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing|Shut Up and Sing]]'' and the music video of the song was quickly shown<ref>[http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200610/20061025/slide_20061025_350_201.jhtml "Not Ready to Make Nice: Controversy in London"]. ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''.</ref>. While interviewing the band, [[Oprah Winfrey|Winfrey]] said the song is so well written that someone cannot even tell if it concerns the controversy. Indeed, Maines said that she and the other songwriters wanted the song to have a universal interpretation. However, the final lines of the fourth verse are unequivocally about the [[death threats]] the band received during the 2003 [[Top of the World Tour]]:

:''"And how in the world
:''Can the words that I said
:''Send somebody so over the edge
:''That they'd write me a letter
:''Saying that I better shut up and sing
:''Or my life will be over."

Some other lines in the beginning of this same verse are about a scene featured in the documentary ''Shut Up and Sing'', in which a mother, who was protesting the Dixie Chicks at one of their concerts, is goading her young son to say ''"screw 'em!"'':
:''"It's a sad sad story
:''When a mother will teach her 
:''Daughter that she ought'a hate a perfect stranger"
In the song, "daughter" was used instead of "son" as a matter of [[poetic license]].

===Comments by band members===
The band members released their comments about writing the songs of ''Taking the Long Way'' through the website Frontpage Publicity<ref>[http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/content/cutxcut.html The Chicks talk about the writing process of the songs of ''Taking The Long Way''] at FrontPagePublicity.com</ref>. They commented the following about "Not Ready to Make Nice":

*Emily: ''"The stakes were definitely higher on that song. We knew it was special because it was so autobiographical, and we had to get it right. We've all gone through so many emotions about the incident. We talked for days with Dan before putting pen to paper, and he really helped get inside our heads and put these feelings out. And once we had this song done, it freed us up to do the rest of the album without that burden."''

*Martie: ''"We had reached a point where we were laughing a lot about it, and people didn't really know how far it had gone. I realized I had suppressed a lot about the death threat. It all came flooding back in the process of writing this song, I think we all realized just how painful it had been for us.."''

*Natalie: ''"We tried to write about the incident a few times, but you get nervous that you're being too preachy or too victimized or too nonchalant. Dan came in with an idea that was some kind of concession, more 'can't we all just get along?' and I said, nope, I can't say that, can't do it. And we talked about it, and he said, what about "I'm not ready to make nice?" From the outside, normal people really weren't aware of how bizarre and absurd it got. Dan was really good at cluing in to that, saying something that didn't back down, but still had a vulnerability to it. This album was therapy. To write these songs allowed me to find peace with everything and move on."''

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for "Not Ready to Make Nice", which was directed by the acclaimed British director [[Sophie Muller]], uses the contrast of dark and white colors. The video starts with a scene of Natalie painting the white clothes of the other two band members, Martie and Emily, with black paint, which symbolizes the boycott of the band. Then, Natalie is seen wearing a black dress with her hands on a puddle of black paint. In another scene, the band members are sitting in a chair and when Natalie gets up to say something, Martie and Emily pull her back in to the chair. Then, Natalie and the other Dixie Chicks are seen in an environment that looks like a [[classroom]] and the teacher sends Natalie to write ''"To talk without thinking is to shoot without aiming"'' on the [[blackboard]]. On the final scenes of the video, Natalie is seen in front of three doctors in what appears to be a [[mental institution]], trying to escape from them.

The music video of the song broke the record as the longest run at #1 on [[VH1]]'s ''[[VSpot Top 20 Countdown]]'' spending 14 weeks at the top, 13 of them consecutive. The video also became the second ever to retire on the show on [[7 October]], [[2006]], when it was at #9 on the countdown. In [[December 2006]], it was named one of the best videos of the year by VH1. "Not Ready to Make Nice" was ranked #36 on CMT's 100 Greatest Videos.<ref>>{{cite web | title=100 Greatest Videos |url=http://lounge.teamshania.com/showthread.php?t=6760|accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref>

===''MADtv'' parody===
The [[FOX Network|FOX]] late-night sketch show ''[[MADtv]]'' performed a [[parody]] of the "Not Ready to Make Nice" music video. In the parody, [[Crista Flanagan]] portrays Natalie Maines as standing by her comments about [[George W. Bush]]; however, her bandmates, portrayed by [[Nicole Parker]] and [[Arden Myrin]], want to apologize so they can remain popular in the United States. Flanagan, as Maines, states that there is no [[God]], she supports radical [[Islam|Islamic]] [[Jihad]], and that every woman should wear a [[burqa]]. In the parody, Flanagan writes on a blackboard, "I am angry and important"; in the original video, Maines' wrote, "To talk without thinking is to shoot without aiming." In the parody, Flanagan is [[Lobotomy|lobotimized]] and her bandmates toast the operation; in the original, Maines resists being treated by doctors and is toasted by her bandmates.

==Critical response==
"Not Ready to Make Nice" was very well-received by music reviewers from publications like [[Allmusic]], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]''. The song has been praised by these critics for being a statement in which the band does not regret Maines' anti-Bush statement.

*[[Allmusic]] reviewer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] said the following about "Not Ready to Make Nice" <ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:bb821v06zzca/ ''Taking the Long Way'' review], [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], [[Allmusic]]</ref>:

:''"Given the controversy of 2003, the conscious distancing from country makes sense <U+2014> and given songs like the defiant "Not Ready to Make Nice", the Dixie Chicks don't sound like they're in retreat on ''Taking the Long Way''; they merely sound like they're being themselves."''

*''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' music reviewer David Browne commented the following about the song <ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1195635,00.html ''Taking the Long Way'' review], David Browne, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' (May 19, 2006)</ref>:

:''"If you wonder whether they have regrets about the incident, "Not Ready to Make Nice" makes it clear they don't. When Maines gets to the part about all the death threats, her voice rises and the strings well up; it's a true pop-money-shot moment."''

*''[[Rolling Stone]]'' music reviewer Barry Walters commented the following about the song <ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/10193414/review/10203846/taking_the_long_way ''Taking the Long Way'' review], Barry Walters, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' (May 2, 2006)</ref>:

:''"Rather than try to forget about singer Natalie Maines' anti-Bush remarks of 2003 -- which landed them in hot water with a lot of station program directors -- the threesome declares it's still "Not Ready to Make Nice"."''

*''[[USA Today]]'' music reviewer Brian Mansfield commented the following about the song <ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2006-05-22-listen-up_x.htm "Dixie Chicks make nice music; Snow Patrol has 'Eyes Open'"]. Brian Mansfield, ''[[USA Today]]''. May 22, 2006.</ref>:

:''"They're "Not Ready to Make Nice" with the yahoos who threatened their lives over an offhanded comment. So give the Chicks credit for sticking to their guns, and give them more for getting on with life."''

==Live performances history==
To promote both the single and the album, the Dixie Chicks performed the song live on some television programs such as on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'', among others. It was also performed to [[internet radio]]s such as [[Sessions@AOL]] and [[LAUNCHcast]]. It was performed in every single concert of the band's ''[[Accidents & Accusations Tour]]'' ([[June 15]]&ndash;[[December 5]], [[2006]]). It was also performed at the [[49th Grammy Awards]], just minutes before the band won the awards for [[Song of the Year]] and [[Record of the Year]].  (In a nod to the controversial origins of the song, Grammy producers had longtime singer-activist [[Joan Baez]] introduce the performance.)

==Chart performance==
"Not Ready to Make Nice" initially peaked at #23 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=379&cfgn=Singles&cfn=The+Billboard+Hot+100&ci=3066206&cdi=8609321&cid=05%2F13%2F2006 "Dixie Chicks - Not Ready to Make Nice"]. Billboard.com. Retrieved [[November 24]] [[2007]].</ref>, becoming the first song by the band to chart in the U.S. after the 2003 controversy. It was able to chart in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 because of a high number of [[digital download|download]] sales (it debuted at #11<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=395&cfgn=Singles&cfn=Hot+Digital+Songs&ci=3066104&cdi=8605228&cid=05%2F06%2F2006 "Dixie Chicks - Not Ready to Make Nice"]. Billboard.com. Retrieved [[November 24]] [[2007]].</ref> and peaked at #8<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=395&cfgn=Singles&cfn=Hot+Digital+Songs&ci=3066203&cdi=8609173&cid=05%2F13%2F2006 "Dixie Chicks - Not Ready to Make Nice"]. Billboard.com. Retrieved [[November 24]] [[2007]].</ref> on the [[Hot Digital Songs]] chart), despite low country radio airplay. 

For the issue dated February 24, 2007, in the wake of its Grammy success, the song re-entered the Hot 100 at #4, after a 20-week absence<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003548654 "Timberlake Scores Third Hot 100 No. 1 From 'FutureSex'"]. Jonathan Cohen, ''Billboard''. February 22, 2007. Retrieved November 24, 2007.</ref>, becoming the band's highest charting single to date. It also tied with [[LL Cool J]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]]' "[[Control Myself]]" as the highest re-entry at the chart. That same week, the song would also receive a Gold certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for digital downloads of over 500,000. However, its drop to #28 in the next week broke the record for the biggest drop out of the top five in a single week, beating [[Clay Aiken]]'s "[[The Way/Solitaire|Solitaire]]", which fell from #4 to #27 four years earlier. <ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/chart_beat/chat_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003556386 Chart Beat Chat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The song was also very popular in [[Canada]], where it peaked at #3 on the [[Jam!|BDS]] chart. It also became a Top 20 hit in [[Australia]], becoming the second single of the band to chart on the [[Australian Recording Industry Association#ARIA Charts|ARIA chart]], at #18<ref name=australian-charts/>. In the United Kingdom, the song charted poorly on the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking at #70<ref name=aCharts/>; however, it became the fourth single by the band to chart in that country. The song ended up going Platinum in the United States.
