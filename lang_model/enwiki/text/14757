'''Malia''' or '''Mallia''' (Greek: <U+039C><U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03B1>) is a coastal town and a [[Communities and Municipalities of Greece|municipality]] on the island of [[Crete]], in [[Greece]], 34&nbsp;km east of [[Heraklion]], the Cretan capital city. The town (pop. 3,722 in 2001) is the seat of the '''Municipality of M<U+00E1>lia''' (pop. 6,212), located in the northeast corner of [[Heraklion Prefecture]]. The municipality also includes the villages of Mochos ''([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+039C><U+03BF><U+03C7><U+03CC><U+03C2>)'' (1,155), Krassi ''([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+039A><U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03C3><U+03B9>)'' (348), and [[Stalis]] ''([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+03A3><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03AF><U+03B4><U+03B1>)'' (987), and has a total land area of 60.720&nbsp;km<U+00B2>. The town is a tourist attraction, primarily for its significant [[archaeological]] site and nightlife.   The [[Minoan]] town [[ruins]] lie three km east of the site and cover an area of approximately 1&nbsp;km<U+00B2>. The original name for the town is not known.

==History==
The palace of Malia, dating from the Middle [[Bronze Age]], was destroyed by an [[earthquake]] during the Late Bronze Age;<ref>[http://www.ancient-greece.org/archaeology/malia.html Mallia archaeological site]</ref> [[Knossos]] and other sites were also destroyed at that time. The palace was later rebuilt toward the end of the Late Bronze Age. Most of the ruins visible today date from this second period of construction. The palace features a giant central courtyard, 48m x 23m in size. On the south side are two sets of steps leading upwards and a maze of tiny rooms. Also here is a strange carved stone called a [[kernos]] stone, which looks like a millstone with a cup attached to the side of it. On the north side of the courtyard were storage rooms with giant earthenware [[pithos]] jars, up to two metres tall. These were used for holding grain, [[olive oil]] and other liquids; the floor of these rooms has a complex drainage system for carrying away spilled liquids.

The palace of Malia was discovered in 1915 by [[Hadzidakis]], a Greek archaeologist. It was fully excavated from 1922 onwards by the [[French School at Athens]] in collaboration with Greek scholars. Importantly, the palace was surrounded by a [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] town which has only recently been uncovered. [[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavation]] is ongoing. Important parts of the old and new excavations are covered by a series of large semi-transparent roofs, which protect them from the elements. In places tourists are allowed to wander among the [[ruins]]; in others, walkways allow passage above. There are rooms which have been identified as metal workshops, ceramic workshops and meeting rooms; there is also a large residential dwelling with on-suite bath, which is similar to a design at [[Phaistos]], both taking advantage of expansive views.<ref>C.

==Malia the Resort==
Modern day Malia is a holiday resort, [[tourism]] and [[commerce]] are the main economic activities in the town, with plenty of [[hotels]], [[restaurants]], [[gift shops]], bars and nightclubs. Malia has become one of the most popular tourist locations of Crete, and one of the most popular in Europe, rivalling [[Ibiza]] and [[Magaluf]]. It is mainly visited by young  [[British people|British]] tourists. The prominence of Malia as one of the leading spots for nightlife in Europe is cemented by the attraction of big name DJs and events.  The Main Strip is home to many bars, clubs, taverns and restaurants. This is supported by the many close by hotels and apartments in Malia and the immediate area. 
Malia has a fine sandy beach which starts from the bottom of the strip and continues towards the East near to the Minoan palace of Malia.

During the summer of 2008, Malia attracted increased attention from the British [[news media]], centering on the wild nightlife and the antisocial behaviour attributed to this. Various newspapers and television news services such as [[BBC News]] and [[GMTV]] sent reporters to highlight the growing concern at the violence and alcohol problems in the popular resort.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1040733/Sex-drugs-booze-violence-Welcome-Malia-party-resort-serving-lethal-holiday-cocktail-young-Brits.html |title= Sex Drugs Booze Violence welcome To Malia|publisher=Daily Mail |accessdate=01/08/2008}}</ref> This behaviour was also brought to light in the [[2002]] [[Sky 1]] documentary titled ''Sex on the Beach'' which was filmed in Malia and followed the experiences of different groups of British holidaymakers during their stay with an emphasis on their drinking binges and sexual [[promiscuity]].
