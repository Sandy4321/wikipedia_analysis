'''Parallel ATA''' ('''PATA''') (Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment) is an [[Electrical connector|interface]] [[standardization|standard]] for the connection of [[computer storage|storage]] devices such as [[hard disk]]s, [[solid-state drive]]s, [[Floppy disk|floppy drive]]s, and [[CD-ROM]] drives in [[computer]]s. The standard is maintained by X3/[[INCITS]] committee<ref>http://www.t13.org T13</ref>. It uses the underlying '''AT Attachment''' ('''ATA''') and '''AT Attachment Packet Interface''' ('''ATAPI''') standards.

The current Parallel ATA standard is the result of a long history of incremental technical development, which began with the original AT Attachment interface, developed for use in early [[PC AT]] equipment. The ATA interface itself evolved in several stages from [[Western Digital]]'s original '''Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE)''' interface. As a result, many near-synonyms for ATA/ATAPI and its previous incarnations exist, including abbreviations such as ''IDE'' which are still in common informal use. After the market introduction of [[Serial ATA]] in 2003, the original ATA was [[retronym|retroactively renamed]] ''Parallel ATA''.

Parallel ATA only allows cable lengths up to {{convert|18|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. Because of this length limit the technology normally appears as an internal computer storage interface. For many years ATA provided the most common and the least expensive interface for this application. By the beginning of 2007, it had largely been replaced by Serial ATA (SATA) in new systems.

==History and terminology==
The standard was originally conceived as "[[PC/AT]] Attachment" as its primary feature was a direct connection to the 16-bit [[ISA bus]] introduced with the IBM PC/AT. The name was shortened to "AT Attachment" to avoid possible trademark issues. It is not spelled out as "Advanced Technology" anywhere in current or recent versions of the specification; it is simply "AT Attachment".

===IDE and ATA-1===

The first version of what is now called the ATA/ATAPI interface was developed by [[Western Digital]] under the name ''Integrated Drive Electronics'' (IDE). 
Together with [[Control Data Corporation]] (who manufactured the hard drive part) and [[Compaq|Compaq Computer]] (into whose systems these drives would initially go), 
they developed the connector, the signaling protocols, and so on with the goal of remaining software compatible with the existing [[ST-506]] hard drive interface.<ref>{{cite web

The term ''Integrated Drive Electronics'' refers not just to the connector and interface definition, but also to the fact that the [[drive controller]] is integrated into the drive, 
as opposed to a separate controller on or connected to the [[motherboard]]. 
(The interface cards used to connect a parallel ATA drive to, for example, a [[PCI slot]] are not drive controllers, they are merely bridges between the host bus and the ATA interface. Since the original ATA interface is essentially just a 16-bit [[ISA slot]] in disguise, the bridge was especially simple in case of an ATA connector being located on an ISA interface card.) 
The integrated controller presented the drive to the host computer as an array of 512-byte blocks with a relatively simple command interface. 
This relieved the mainboard and interface cards in the host computer of the chores of stepping the disk head arm, moving the head arm in and out, and so on, as had to be done with earlier [[ST-506]] and [[Enhanced Small Disk Interface|ESDI]] hard drives. 
All of these low-level details of the mechanical operation of the drive were now handled by the controller on the drive itself. 
This also eliminated the need to design a single controller that could handle many different types of drives, since the controller could be unique for the drive. 
The host need only ask for a particular sector, or block, to be read or written, and either accept the data from the drive or send the data to it.

The interface used by these drives was standardized in 1994 as ANSI standard X3.221-1994, ''AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives''. After later versions of the standard
were developed, this became known as "ATA-1".<ref>{{cite web

===Second ATA interface===
When PC motherboard makers started to include on-board ATA interfaces in place of the earlier ISA plug-in cards, there was usually only one ATA connector on the board, which could support up to two hard drives. At the time in combination with the floppy drive, this was sufficient for most people, and eventually it became common to have two hard drives installed. When the [[CD-ROM]] was developed, many computers would have been unable to accept these drives if they had been ATA devices, due to already having two hard drives installed. Adding the CD-ROM drive would have required removal of one of the drives.

[[SCSI]] was available as a CD-ROM expansion option at the time, but devices with SCSI were more expensive than ATA devices due to the need for a smart interface that is capable of [[bus arbitration]]. SCSI typically added US$ 100-300 to the cost of a storage device, in addition to the cost of a SCSI host adapter.

The less-expensive solution was the addition of a dedicated CD-ROM interface, typically included as an expansion option on a [[sound card]]. It was included on the sound card because early business PCs did not include support for more than simple beeps from the internal speaker, and tuneful sound playback was considered unnecessary for early business software. When the CD-ROM was introduced, it was logical to also add digital audio to the computer at the same time (for the same reason, sound cards tended to include a [[gameport]] interface for joysticks). An older business PC could be upgraded in this manner to meet the [[Multimedia PC]] standard for early software packages that used sound (which required the sound card) and colorful video animation (which required the CD-ROM as floppy disks simply didn't have the necessary data capacity).

The second drive interface initially was not well-defined. It was first introduced with interfaces specific to certain CD-ROM drives such as Mitsumi, Sony or Panasonic drives<ref>Creative Labs sound card documentation showing diagram with custom Mitsumi, Sony, and Panasonic CD-ROM drive connectors http://stason.org/TULARC/pc/sound-cards-multimedia/CREATIVE-LABS-INC-Sound-card-16-BIT-AUDIO-CARD-PAN.html</ref>, and it was common to find early sound cards with two or three separate connectors each designed to match a certain brand of CD-ROM drive. This evolved into the standard ATA interface for ease of cross-compatibility, though the sound card ATA interface still usually supported only a single CD-ROM and not hard drives.

This second ATA interface on the sound card eventually evolved into the second motherboard ATA interface which was long included as a standard component in all PCs. For a long period of time, ATA ruled as the primary storage device interface and in some systems a third and fourth motherboard interface was provided (for example, Promise Ultra-100), for up to eight ATA devices attached to the motherboard.

After the introduction of SATA or [[Serial ATA]], use of ATA declined and motherboards began to be shipped with only a single interface, for up to two ATA optical drives, along with two or more SATA connectors for hard drives. Optical drives are now available with SATA, so the ATA interface often goes unused. Several modern PC [[chipset]]s have removed support for parallel ATA connectors, so that motherboard vendors still wishing to offer ATA will have to include an additional interface chip for that purpose.

===EIDE and ATA-2===
In 1994, about the same time that the ATA-1 standard was adopted, Western Digital introduced drives under a slightly new name, '''Enhanced IDE''' (EIDE). These included most of the features of the forthcoming ATA-2 specification and several additional enhancements. Other manufacturers introduced their own variations of ATA-1 such as "Fast ATA" and "Fast ATA-2".

The new version of the ANSI standard, ''AT Attachment Interface with Extensions ATA-2'' (X3.279-1996), was approved in 1996. It included most of the features of the manufacturer-specific variants.<ref>{{cite web |title=The PC Guide: ATA (ATA-2) |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/stdATA2-c.html |accessdate=2008-08-23 |author=Charles M. Kozierok |date=2001-04-17}}</ref><ref name=ATA2>{{cite book |last=Technical Committee T13 AT Attachment |authorlink=http://www.t13.org/ |title=AT Attachment Interface with Extensions (ATA-2) |publisher=Global Engineering Documents |year=1996}}</ref>

ATA-2 also was the first to note that devices other than hard drives could be attached to the interface:
{{quotation|

}}

===ATAPI===

As mentioned in the previous sections ATA was originally designed for and worked only with hard disks and devices that could emulate them. The introduction of ATAPI (ATA Packet Interface) by a group called the Small Form Factor committee allowed ATA to be used for a variety of other devices that require functions beyond those necessary for hard disks. For example, any removable media device needs a "media eject" command, and a way for the host to determine whether the media is present, and these were not provided in the ATA protocol.

The Small Form Factor committee approached this problem by defining ATAPI, the "ATA Packet Interface". ATAPI is actually a protocol allowing the ATA interface to carry [[SCSI]] commands and responses; therefore all ATAPI devices are actually "speaking SCSI" other than at the electrical interface. In fact, some early ATAPI devices were simply SCSI devices with an ATA/ATAPI to SCSI protocol converter added on. The SCSI commands and responses are embedded in "packets" (hence "ATA Packet Interface")
for transmission on the ATA cable. This allows any device class for which a SCSI command set has been defined to be interfaced via ATA/ATAPI.

ATAPI devices are also "speaking ATA", as the ATA physical interface and protocol are still being used to send the packets. On the other hand, ATA hard drives and solid state drives do not use ATAPI.

ATAPI devices include CD-ROM and [[DVD-ROM]] drives, [[tape drive]]s, and large-capacity [[floppy disk|floppy]] drives such as the [[Zip drive]] and [[SuperDisk drive]].

The SCSI commands and responses used by each class of ATAPI device (CD-ROM, tape, etc.) are described in other documents or specifications specific to those device classes
and are not within ATA/ATAPI or the T13 committee's purview. <!-- ATAPI Packet Commands for Block Devices (SFF-8070i) ATAPI Packet Commands for CD-ROMs (SFF-8020i) -->

ATAPI was adopted as part of ATA in INCITS 317-1998, ''AT Attachment with Packet Interface Extension (ATA/ATAPI-4)''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The PC Guide: SFF-8020 / ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/stdATAPI-c.html |accessdate=2008-08-23 |author=Charles M. Kozierok |date=2001-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The PC Guide: ATA/ATAPI-4 |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/stdATA4-c.html |accessdate=2008-08-23 |author=Charles M.

===UDMA and ATA-4===
The ATA/ATAPI-4 also introduced several "Ultra DMA" transfer modes. These initially supported speeds from 16 MByte/s to 33 MByte/second. In later versions faster Ultra DMA modes were added, requiring a new 80-wire cable to reduce crosstalk. The latest versions of Parallel ATA support up to 133 MByte/s.

===Current terminology===

The terms "integrated drive electronics" (IDE), "enhanced IDE" and "EIDE" have come to be used interchangeably with ATA (now Parallel ATA, or PATA). However the terms "IDE" and "EIDE" are at best imprecise. Every ATA drive is an "integrated drive electronics" drive, but SCSI drives could also legitimately be described as having "integrated drive electronics". However the abbreviation IDE is rarely, if ever, used for SCSI drives.

In addition there have been several generations of "EIDE" drives marketed, compliant with various versions of the ATA specification. An early "EIDE" drive might be compatible with ATA-2, while a later one with ATA-6.

Nevertheless a request for an "IDE" or "EIDE" drive from a computer parts vendor will almost always yield a drive that will work with modern systems' ATA interfaces.

Another common usage is to refer to the specification version by the fastest mode supported. For example, ATA-4 supported Ultra DMA modes 0 through 2, the latter providing
a maximum transfer rate of 33 megabytes per second. ATA-4 drives are thus sometimes called "UDMA-33" drives, and sometimes "ATA-33" drives. Similarly, ATA-6 introduced a maximum transfer speed of 100 megabytes per second, and some drives complying to this version of the standard are marketed as "PATA/100" drives.

===Drive size limitations===

<!-- Also, do we need to mention the earlier 504 MB limit in earlier BIOSes, and make clear that it was not the interface's problem but rather the BIOS... or was it? Or is that so old that we don't need to bother? [_maybe the words "such as" already allow for the 504 MB, 32 MB, and other random limits_]-->

The original ATA specification used a 28-bit addressing mode, allowing for the addressing of 2<sup>28</sup> (268,435,456) sectors (blocks) of 512&nbsp;bytes each, resulting in a maximum capacity of 128&nbsp;[[Gibibyte|GiB]] (137&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]])<ref>{{BDprefix|p=d}}</ref>. The BIOS in early PCs imposed smaller limits such as 8.46&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]], with a maximum of 1024 cylinders, 256 heads and 63 sectors, but this was not a limit imposed by the ATA interface.

ATA-6 introduced 48-bit addressing, increasing the limit to 128&nbsp;[[Pebibyte|PiB]] (144&nbsp;[[Petabyte|PB]]). As a consequence, any ATA drive of capacity larger than about 137&nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s must be an ATA-6 or later drive. Connecting such a drive to a host with an ATA-5 or earlier interface will limit the usable capacity to the maximum of the interface.

Some operating systems, including Windows XP pre-SP 1, and Windows 2000, disable 48-bit [[Logical block addressing|LBA]] by default, requiring the user to take extra steps to use the entire capacity of an ATA drive larger than about 137&nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Large Disk HOWTO: History of BIOS and IDE limits|url=http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Large-Disk-HOWTO-4.html}}</ref>

==Parallel ATA interface==
[[Image:nappe.svg|center|Ribbon cable with two connectors]]

Until the introduction of Serial ATA, 40-pin connectors generally attached drives to a [[ribbon cable]]. Each cable has two or three connectors, one of which plugs into an adapter interfacing with the rest of the computer system. The remaining connector(s) plug into drives. Parallel ATA cables transfer data 16 bits at a time.

ATA's ribbon cables have had 40 wires for most of its history (44 conductors for the smaller form-factor version used for 2.5" drives&nbsp;<U+2014> the extra four for power), but an 80-wire version appeared with the introduction of the ''Ultra DMA/33'' (''UDMA'') mode. All of the additional wires in the new cable are [[ground (electricity)|ground]] wires, interleaved with the previously defined wires to reduce the effects of [[capacitive coupling]] between neighboring signal wires, reducing [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]]. Capacitive coupling is more of a problem at higher transfer rates, and this change was necessary to enable the 66 megabytes per second (MB/s) transfer rate of ''UDMA4'' to work reliably. The faster ''UDMA5'' and ''UDMA6'' modes also require 80-conductor cables.
[[Image:ATA cables.jpg|thumb|300px|ATA cables:<br>40 wire ribbon cable (top)<br> 80 wire ribbon cable (bottom)]]

Though the number of wires doubled, the number of connector pins and the pinout remain the same as 40-conductor cables, and the external appearance of the connectors is identical. Internally the connectors are different; the connectors for the 80-wire cable connect a larger number of ground wires to a smaller number of ground pins, while the connectors for the 40-wire cable connect ground wires to ground pins one-for-one. 80-wire cables usually come with three differently colored connectors (blue&nbsp;<U+2014> controller, gray&nbsp;<U+2014> slave drive, and black&nbsp;<U+2014> master drive) as opposed to uniformly colored 40-wire cable's connectors (all black). The gray connector on 80-conductor cables has pin 28 CSEL not connected; making it the slave position for drives configured cable select.

; Pin 20
In the ATA standard pin 20 is defined as (mechanical) key and is not used; i.e., this socket on the female connector is often obstructed, and a cable or drive connector with a pin in this position cannot be connected, making it impossible to plug in a connector the wrong way round. However, some [[flash memory]] drives can use pin 20 as VCC_in to power the drive without requiring a special power cable<ref>[http://www.transcendusa.com/Support/FAQ/index.asp?axn=Detail&LangNo=0&FAQNo=212 Welcome to Transcend website<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

; Pin 28
Pin 28 of the gray (slave/middle) connector of an 80 conductor cable is not attached to any conductor of the cable. It is attached normally on the black (master drive end) and blue (motherboard end) connectors.

; Pin 34
Pin 34 is connected to ground inside the blue connector of an 80 conductor cable but not attached to any conductor of the cable. It is attached normally on the gray and black connectors. See page 315 of [http://www.t10.org/t13/project/d1321r3-ATA-ATAPI-5.pdf].

===Differences between connectors on 80-conductor cables===
[[Image:PATA-Connectors-exposed.png|center|400px|Differences between connectors]]
The image shows PATA connectors after removal of strain relief, cover, and cable. Pin one is at bottom left of the connectors, pin 2 is top left, etc., except that the lower image of the blue connector shows the view from the opposite side, and pin one is at top right.

Each contact comprises a pair of points which together pierce the insulation of the ribbon cable with such precision that they make a connection to the desired conductor without harming the insulation on the neighboring wires. The center row of contacts are all connected to the common ground bus and attached to the odd numbered conductors of the cable. The top row of contacts are the even-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the even-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to every other even-numbered conductor of the cable. The bottom row of contacts are the odd-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the odd-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to the remaining even-numbered conductors of the cable.

Note the connections to the common ground bus from sockets 2 (top left), 19 (center bottom row), 22, 24, 26, 30, and 40 on all connectors. Also note (enlarged detail, bottom, looking from the opposite side of the connector) that socket 34 of the blue connector does not contact any conductor but unlike socket 34 of the other two connectors, it does connect to the common ground bus. On the gray connector, note that socket 28 is completely missing, so that pin 28 of the drive attached to the gray connector will be open. On the black connector, sockets 28 and 34 are completely normal, so that pins 28 and 34 of the drive attached to the black connector will be connected to the cable. Pin 28 of the black drive reaches pin 28 of the host receptacle but not pin 28 of the gray drive, while pin 34 of the black drive reaches pin 34 of the gray drive but not pin 34 of the host. Instead, pin 34 of the host is grounded.

The standard dictates color-coded connectors for easy identification by both installer and cable maker. All three connectors are different from one another. The blue (host) connector has the socket for pin 34 connected to ground inside the connector but not attached to any conductor of the cable. Since the old 40 conductor cables do not ground pin 34, the presence of a ground connection indicates that an 80 conductor cable is installed. The wire for pin 34 is attached normally on the other types and is not grounded. Installing the cable backwards (with the black connector on the system board, the blue connector on the remote device and the gray connector on the center device) will ground pin 34 of the remote device and connect host pin 34 through to pin 34 of the center device. The gray center connector omits the connection to pin 28 but connects pin 34 normally, while the black end connector connects both pins 28 and 34 normally.

===Multiple devices on a cable===
If two devices attach to a single cable, one must be designated as ''device 0'' (commonly referred to as ''master'') and the other as ''device 1'' (''slave''). This distinction is necessary to allow both drives to share the cable without conflict. The ''master'' drive is the drive that usually appears "first" to the computer's [[BIOS]] and/or [[operating system]]. On old BIOSes ([[Intel 486]] era and older), the drives are often referred to by the BIOS as "C" for the master and "D" for the slave following the way DOS would refer to the active primary partitions on each.

The mode that a drive must use is often set by a [[Jumper (computing)|jumper setting]] on the drive itself, which must be manually set to ''master'' or ''slave''. If there is a single device on a cable, it should be configured as ''master''. However, some hard drives have a special setting called ''single'' for this configuration (Western Digital, in particular). Also, depending on the hardware and software available, a single drive on a cable can work reliably even though configured as the ''slave'' drive (this configuration is most often seen when a CD ROM has a channel to itself).

===Cable select===<!-- This section is linked from [[CS]] -->

A drive mode called ''cable select'' was described as optional in ATA-1 and has come into fairly widespread use with ATA-5 and later. A drive set to "cable select" automatically configures itself as master or slave, according to its position on the cable. Cable select is controlled by pin 28. The host adapter grounds this pin; if a device sees that the pin is grounded, it becomes the master device; if it sees that pin 28 is open, the device becomes the slave device.

This setting is usually chosen by a [[Jumper (computing)|jumper setting]] on the drive called "cable select", usually marked ''CS'', which is separate from the "master" or "slave" setting.

Note that if two drives are configured as ''master'' and ''slave'' manually, this configuration does not need to correspond to their position on the cable. Pin 28 is only used to let the drives know their position on the cable; it is not used by the host when communicating with the drives.

With the 40-wire cable it was very common to implement cable select by simply cutting the pin 28 wire between the two device connectors; putting the slave device at the end of the cable, and the master on the middle connector. This arrangement eventually was standardized in later versions. If there is just one device on the cable, this results in an unused stub of cable, which is undesirable for physical convenience and electrical reasons. The stub causes [[signal reflections]], particularly at higher transfer rates.

Starting with the 80-wire cable defined for use in ATAPI5/UDMA4, the master device goes at the end of the {{convert|18|in|mm|sing=on}} cable<U+2014>the black connector<U+2014>and the slave device goes on the middle connector<U+2014>the gray one<U+2014>and the blue connector goes onto the motherboard. So, if there is only one (master) device on the cable, there is no cable stub to cause reflections. Also, cable select is now implemented in the slave device connector, usually simply by omitting the contact from the connector body.

====Master and slave clarification====
Although they are in common use, the terms [[Master/slave (technology)|''master'' and ''slave'']] do not actually appear in current versions of the ATA specifications. The two devices are correctly referred to as ''device 0'' (master) and ''device 1'' (slave), respectively. It is a common myth that the controller on the master drive assumes control over the slave drive, or that the master drive may claim priority of communication over the other device on the channel. In fact, the drivers in the host operating system perform the necessary arbitration and serialization, and each drive's controller operates independently.

The terms "master" and "slave" have not been without controversy. In 2003, the [[County of Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States|US]] requested that, when possible, suppliers stop using the terms because the county found them unacceptable in light of its "cultural diversity and sensitivity".[http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/outrage/master.asp]

===Serialized, overlapped, and queued operations===
The parallel ATA protocols up through ATA-3 require that once a command has been given on an ATA interface, it must complete before any subsequent command may be given. Operations on the devices must be serialized<U+2014>with only one operation in progress at a time<U+2014>with respect to the ATA host interface. A useful mental model is that the host ATA interface is busy with the first request for its entire duration, and therefore can not be told about another request until the first one is complete. The function of serializing requests to the interface is usually performed by a device driver in the host operating system.

The ATA-4 and subsequent versions of the specification have included an "overlapped feature set" and a "queued feature set" as optional features, both being given the name "[[Tagged Command Queuing]]", a reference to a set of features from SCSI which the ATA version attempts to emulate. However, support for these is extremely rare in actual parallel ATA products and device drivers, because these feature sets were implemented in such a way as to maintain software compatibility with its heritage as originally an extension of the ISA bus, this resulted in excessive CPU utilization, which largely negated their advantages. By contrast, overlapped and queued operations have been common in other storage buses, in particular, SCSI's version of tagged command queuing had no need to be software compatible with ISA's APIs, allowing it to attain high performance with low overhead on buses which supported first party DMA like PCI. This has long been seen as a major advantage of SCSI.

The Serial ATA standard has supported [[Native Command Queuing|native command queueing]] since its first release, but it is an optional feature for both host-adapters and target-devices. Many less expensive PC motherboards do not support NCQ. Many SATA/II hard drives sold today support NCQ, while no removable (CD/DVD) drives do because the ATAPI command set used to control them prohibits queued operations.

===Two devices on one cable&nbsp;<U+2014> speed impact===
There are many debates about how much a slow device can impact the performance of a faster device on the same cable. There is an effect, but the debate is confused by the blurring of two quite different causes, called here "Lowest speed" and "One operation at a time".

===="Lowest speed"====
It is a common misconception that, if two devices of different speed capabilities are on the same cable, both devices' data transfers will be constrained to the speed of the slower device.

For all modern ATA host adapters this is not true, as modern ATA host adapters support ''independent device timing''. This allows each device on the cable to transfer data at its own best speed. Even with older adapters without independent timing, this effect only applies to the data transfer phase of a read or write operation. This is usually the shortest part of a complete read or write operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confTiming-c.html |title=Independent Master/Slave Device Timing |accessdate=2008-08-08 |author=Charles M. Kozierok |date=2001-04-17 |work=The PC Guide}}</ref>

===="One operation at a time"====
This is caused by the omission of both overlapped and queued feature sets from most parallel ATA products. Only one device on a cable can perform a read or write operation at one time, therefore a fast device on the same cable as a slow device '''under heavy use''' will find it has to wait for the slow device to complete its task first.

However, most modern devices will report write operations as complete once the data is stored in its onboard cache memory, before the data is written to the (slow) magnetic storage. This allows commands to be sent to the other device on the cable, reducing the impact of the "one operation at a time" limit.

The impact of this on a system's performance depends on the application. For example, when copying data from an optical drive to a hard drive (such as during software installation), this effect probably doesn't matter: Such jobs are necessarily limited by the speed of the optical drive no matter where it is. But if the hard drive in question is also expected to provide good throughput for other tasks at the same time, it probably should not be on the same cable as the optical drive.

===HDD passwords and security===
The disk lock is a built-in security feature in the disk. It is part of the ATA specification, and thus not specific to any brand or device.

A disk always has two passwords: A User password and a Master password. Most disks support a Master Password Revision Code. Reportedly some disks can report if the Master password has been changed, or if it still the [[default password|factory default]]. The revision code is word 92 in the IDENTIFY response. Reportedly on some disks a value of 0xFFFE means the Master password is unchanged. The standard does not distinguish this value.

A disk can be locked in two modes: High security mode or Maximum security mode. Bit 8 in word 128 of the IDENTIFY response shows which mode the disk is in: 0 = High, 1 = Maximum.

In High security mode, the disk can be unlocked with either the User or Master password, using the "SECURITY UNLOCK DEVICE" ATA command. There is an attempt limit, normally set to 5, after which the disk must be power cycled or hard-reset before unlocking can be attempted again. Also in High security mode the SECURITY ERASE UNIT command can be used with either the User or Master password.

In Maximum security mode, the disk cannot be unlocked without the User password&nbsp;<U+2014> the only way to get the disk back to a usable state is to issue the SECURITY ERASE PREPARE command, immediately followed by SECURITY ERASE UNIT. In Maximum security mode the SECURITY ERASE UNIT command requires the User password and will completely erase all data on the disk. The operation is slow, it may take longer than half an hour or more, depending on the size of the disk. (Word 89 in the IDENTIFY response indicates how long the operation will take.) <ref>[http://www.rockbox.org/lock.html Rockbox - Unlocking a password protected harddisk<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===External parallel-ATA devices===
It is extremely uncommon to find external PATA devices that directly use the interface for connection to a computer. PATA is primarily restricted to devices installed internally, due to the short data cable specification. A device connected externally needs additional cable length to form a U-shaped bend so that the external device may be placed alongside, or on top of the computer case, and the standard cable length is too short to permit this.

For ease of reach from motherboard to device, the connectors tend to be positioned towards the front edge of motherboards, for connection to devices protruding from the front of the computer case. This front-edge position makes extension out the back to an external device even more difficult. Ribbon cables are poorly shielded, and the standard relies upon the cabling to be installed inside a shielded computer case to meet RF emissions limits.

All external PATA devices, such as external hard drives, use some other interface technology to bridge the distance between the external device and the computer. USB is the most common external interface, followed by Firewire. A bridge chip inside the external devices converts from the USB interface to PATA, and typically only supports a single external device without cable select or master/slave.

==ATA standards versions, transfer rates, and features==
The following table shows the names of the versions of the ATA standards and the transfer modes and rates supported by each. Note that the transfer rate for each mode (for example, 66.7&nbsp;MB/s for UDMA4, commonly called "Ultra-DMA 66", defined by ATA-5) gives its maximum theoretical transfer rate on the cable. This is simply two bytes multiplied by the effective clock rate, and presumes that every clock cycle is used to transfer end-user data. In practice, of course, protocol overhead reduces this value.

Congestion on the host bus to which the ATA adapter is attached may also limit the maximum burst transfer rate. For example, the maximum data transfer rate for [[conventional PCI]] bus is 133&nbsp;MB/s, and this is shared among all active devices on the bus.

In addition, no ATA [[hard drive]]s existed in 2005 that were capable of measured sustained transfer rates of above 80&nbsp;MB/s. Furthermore, sustained transfer rate tests do not give realistic throughput expectations for most workloads: They use I/O loads specifically designed to encounter almost no delays from seek time or rotational latency. Hard drive performance under most workloads is limited first and second by those two factors; the transfer rate on the bus is a distant third in importance. Therefore, transfer speed limits above 66&nbsp;MB/s really affect performance only when the hard drive can satisfy all I/O requests by reading from its internal [[cache]]&nbsp;<U+2014> a very unusual situation, especially considering that such data are usually already buffered by the operating system.

As of April 2010 mechanical [[hard disk drive]]s can transfer data at up to 157&nbsp;MB/s,<ref name="Tom2010HardDrives">{{cite news |title=VelociRaptor Returns: 6Gb/s, 600GB, And 10,000 RPM  |publisher=tomshardware.com |author=Patrick Schmid and Achim Roos |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wd6000hlhx-velociraptor-600gb,2600-5.html |date=2010-04-06 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref> which is beyond the capabilities of the PATA/133 specification. High-performance [[Solid-state drive|flash drives]] can transfer data at up to 308&nbsp;MB/s.<ref name="Tom2010SolidStateDrives">{{cite news |title=Spring 2010 Solid State Drive Roundup, Part 2 |publisher=tomshardware.com |author=Patrick Schmid and Achim Roos |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/6gb-s-ssd-hdd,2603-7.html |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref>

Only the Ultra DMA modes use [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] to detect errors in data transfer between the controller and drive. This is a 16 bit CRC, and it is used for data blocks only. Transmission of command and status blocks do not use the fast signaling methods that would necessitate CRC. For comparison, in Serial ATA, 32 bit CRC is used for both commands and data.<ref>{{cite web|title=serialata&nbsp;<U+2014> a comparison with ultra ata technology|url=http://www.serialata.org/docs/serialata%20-%20a%20comparison%20with%20ultra%20ata%20technology.pdf}} www.serialata.org</ref>{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}

===ATAPI Removable Media Device (ARMD)===

ATAPI devices with removable media, other than CD and DVD drives, are classified as ARMD (ATAPI Removable Media Device) and can appear as either a super-floppy (non-partitioned media) or a hard drive (partitioned media) to the [[operating system]]. These can be supported as bootable devices by a BIOS complying with the
'''ATAPI Removable Media Device BIOS Specification''',<ref>[http://www.phoenix.com/NR/rdonlyres/EDD1AAA0-177E-4024-A0B1-E4BD06B673F7/0/specsatapi.pdf ATAPI Removable Media Device BIOS Specification]</ref> originally developed by [[Compaq|Compaq Computer Corporation]] and [[Phoenix Technologies]]. It specifies provisions in the [[BIOS]] of a [[personal computer]] to allow the computer to be [[booting|bootstrapped]] from devices such as [[Iomega Zip drive|Zip drives]], [[Iomega Jaz drive|Jaz drives]], [[SuperDisk]] (LS-120) drives, and similar devices.

These devices have removable media like [[Floppy disk|floppy disk drives]], but capacities more commensurate with [[hard drive]]s, and programming requirements unlike either. Due to limitations in the floppy controller interface most of these devices were [[AT Attachment|ATAPI]] devices, connected to one of the host computer's ATA interfaces, similarly to a hard drive or [[CD-ROM]] device. However, existing BIOS standards did not support these devices. An ARMD-compliant BIOS allows these devices to booted from and used under the operating system without requiring device-specific code in the OS.

A BIOS implementing ARMD allows the user to include ARMD devices in the boot search order. Usually an ARMD device is configured earlier in the boot order than the hard drive. Similarly to a floppy drive, if bootable media is present in the ARMD drive, the BIOS will boot from it; if not, the BIOS will continue in the search order, usually with the hard drive last.

There are two variants of ARMD, ARMD-FDD and ARMD-HDD. Originally ARMD caused the devices to appear as a sort of very large floppy drive, either the primary floppy drive device 00h or the secondary device 01h. Some operating systems required code changes to support floppy disks with capacities far larger than any standard floppy disk drive. Also, standard-floppy disk drive emulation proved to be unsuitable for certain high-capacity floppy disk drives such as [[Iomega Zip drive]]s. Later the ARMD-HDD, ARMD-"Hard disk device", variant was developed to address these issues. Under ARMD-HDD, an ARMD device appears to the BIOS and the operating system as a hard drive.

===ATA over Ethernet===

In August 2004, Sam Hopkins and Brantley Coile of [[Coraid]] specified a lightweight [[ATA over Ethernet]] protocol to carry ATA commands over [[Ethernet]] instead of directly connecting them to a PATA host adapter. This permitted the established block protocol to be reused in [[storage area network]] (SAN) applications.
