'''''Peter Gabriel''''' is the first album [[Peter Gabriel]] recorded after leaving the [[progressive rock]] band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], and the first of four with the same [[eponym]]ous title.  Upon the album's release, Gabriel began touring with a seven-piece band under his own name.

Gabriel and [[Record producer|producer]] [[Bob Ezrin]] assembled a team of talented musicians, including [[Robert Fripp]] of [[King Crimson]], to record the album.

The album's second track, "[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]," describes Gabriel's departure from Genesis and has become one of Gabriel's more popular songs. [[Erasure]] covered the song in 2003 on ''[[Other People's Songs]]''.

After release, Peter Gabriel felt that the track "Here Comes the Flood" was over-produced. Since then he has created far simpler renditions such as the one on [[Robert Fripp]]'s album, ''[[Exposure (Robert Fripp album)|Exposure]]'', his appearance on [[Kate Bush]]'s 1979 TV special, and yet a third version on Peter Gabriel's first greatest hits album, ''[[Shaking the Tree|Shaking the Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats]]''. He often performs the song live accompanied by only himself on keyboard.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlRLvaXVyk8 youtube.com]</ref>

The album went to #7 in UK and #38 in the USA.

This album is often referred to as '''''Car''''', or '''''Rain''''', referring to the album cover by [[Peter Christopherson]] (a.k.a. "Sleazy" from [[Hipgnosis]]). The car was a [[Lancia Flavia]] owned by [[Storm Thorgerson]].<ref>[http://www.hypergallery.com/prints/car-146.html hypergallery.com]</ref>

There is a slightly different version of this album released through Direct Disk Labs, a halfspeed mastered version from the original master tapes. It has a longer version of "Slowburn" (5:16 instead of 4:36) with the song's introduction intact. All other versions of the song seem to have this intro edited out. Normally the song starts with a piano, but this rare version begins with a full band.
