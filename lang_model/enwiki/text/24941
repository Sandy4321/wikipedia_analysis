==Meaning==
'''Korphai''', literally means a bunch of bamboo, is a new generation of Thai musicians who has joined the musical journey together since their age of high-school. 

==History==
From 1980, the History began at the time when [[Anant Narkkong]], the present musical director of the ensemble, started to collect his family members and friends and established a circle of young amateur musicians. The group became well known in 1983 when it won a prestigious national music contest. Ever since, the name of Korphai became famous among various groups of music lovers. The ensemble is also unique for its remarkable fact that many of its members, who are multi-talented, are musicians by interest, rather than by profession. Yet its professionalism is never to be questioned and the group's image as a new hope of Thai music remains unchallenged.

==Music==
The group is internationally renowned for its excellent rendition of [[Thai Classical Music]] as well as Thai Contemporary Music. Throughout the past 20 years, Korphai has been released a number of CD albums and performed in numerous public concerts in Thailand and aboard. The group also extensively involved in making background for Thai films, documentaries, theatres, plays and festival presentations. Their latest work on original music for a hugely successful Thai film <U+201C>Homerong (the Overture)<U+201D>, inspired by the life of the greatest Thai xylophonist and composer of the last century Luang Pradithphairoh, was launched in February-March 2004 and received highly acclaimed by international media critics and general public.
