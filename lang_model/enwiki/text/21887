'''Cheese''' is a solid [[food]] made from the [[milk]] of [[cattle|cow]]s, [[goat]]s, [[domestic sheep|sheep]],  and other [[mammal]]s. Cheese is made by [[curdling]] milk using a combination of [[rennet]] (or rennet substitutes) and [[Acid|acidification]]. [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] acidify the milk and play a role in defining the [[texture (food)|texture]] and flavor of most cheeses. Some cheeses also feature [[mold]]s, either on the outer [[rind]] or throughout.

There are [[List of cheeses|hundreds of types of cheese]] produced all over the world. Different styles and flavors of cheese are the result of using milk from various mammals or with different [[butterfat]] contents, employing particular species of bacteria and molds, and varying the length of aging and other processing treatments. Other factors include animal diet and the addition of flavoring agents such as [[herb]]s, [[spice]]s, or [[smoking (food)|wood smoke]]. Whether the milk is [[Pasteurization|pasteurized]] may also affect the flavor. The yellow to red coloring of many cheeses is a result of adding [[annatto]]. Cheeses are eaten both on their own and cooked as part of various dishes; most cheeses melt when heated.

For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding [[acid]]s such as [[vinegar]] or [[lemon]] juice. Most cheeses, however, are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn [[lactose|milk sugar]]s into [[lactic acid]], followed by the addition of rennet to complete the curdling. Rennet is an [[enzyme]] mixture traditionally obtained from the stomach lining of young [[cattle]], but now also laboratory produced. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the [[fungus]] ''Mucor miehei'', but others have been extracted from various species of the ''[[Cynara]]'' thistle family.

==Types of cheese==
{{main|List of cheeses}}
No one categorization scheme can capture all the diversity of the world's cheeses. Some common systems used are:
* Length of aging.
* Texture (hard or soft); this is correlated to the moisture content: the more moist a cheese, the softer. This classification is common in the US, but is inaccurate: many types of cheese are made in softer or firmer variations. 
* Methods of making: pressed or unpressed curd, heated or unheated curd, mold growth, etc.
* Fat content.
* Kind of milk (cow's milk, goat's milk cheese, etc.)

===Fresh Cheeses===

For these simplest cheeses, milk is curdled and drained, with little other processing. Examples include [[cottage cheese]], Romanian [[Romanian cas|Ca<U+015F>]], [[Neufch<U+00E2>tel (cheese)|Neufch<U+00E2>tel]] (the model for American-style [[cream cheese]]), and fresh goat's milk [[Ch<U+00E8>vre cheese|ch<U+00E8>vre]]. Such cheeses are soft and spreadable, with a mild taste. Fresh cheeses without additional [[preservative]]s can spoil in a matter of days. 

Whey cheeses are fresh cheeses made from the [[whey]] discarded while producing other cheeses. Provencal [[Brousse]], Corsican [[Brocciu]], Italian [[Ricotta]], [[Romania|Romanian]] [[Romanian Urda|Urda]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Geitost]] are examples. Brocciu is mostly eaten fresh, and is as such a major ingredient in Corsican cuisine, but it can be aged too.

Traditional [[Mozzarella]] also falls into the fresh cheese category. Fresh curds are stretched and kneaded in hot water to form a ball of Mozzarella, which in southern [[Italy]] is usually eaten within a few hours of being made. Other firm fresh cheeses include [[paneer]] and [[queso fresco]].

===Texture===
[[Image:Kaasmarkt2 close.jpg|thumb|A [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]] cheese market]]
Categorizing cheeses by firmness is a common but inexact practice. The lines between "soft", "semi-soft", "semi-hard", and "hard" are arbitrary, and many types of cheese are made in softer or firmer variations. Harder cheeses have a lower moisture content than softer cheeses. They are generally packed into molds under more pressure and aged for a longer time.

The familiar [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar]] is one of a family of semi-hard or hard cheeses (including [[Cheshire cheese|Cheshire]] and [[Gloucester cheese|Gloucester]]) whose curd is cut, gently heated, piled, and stirred before being pressed into forms. [[Colby cheese|Colby]] and [[Monterey Jack]] are similar but milder cheeses; their curd is rinsed before it is pressed, washing away some acidity and [[calcium]]. A similar curd-washing takes place when making the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] cheeses [[Edam (cheese)|Edam]] and [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]].

Swiss-style cheeses like [[Emmental (cheese)|Emmental]] and [[Gruy<U+00E8>re (cheese)|Gruy<U+00E8>re]] are generally quite firm. The same bacteria that give Emmental its holes contribute to their aromatic and sharp flavors. The hardest cheeses &mdash; "grating cheeses" such as [[Parmesan cheese|Parmesan]], [[Pecorino]], and [[Romano cheese|Romano]] &mdash; are quite firmly packed into large forms and aged for months or years.

===Methods===
====Use of mold====
Soft-ripened cheeses such as [[Brie (cheese)|Brie]] and [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]] are made by allowing white ''[[Penicillium candida]]'' or ''[[Penicillium camemberti|P. camemberti]]'' [[mold]] to grow on the outside of a soft cheese for a few days or weeks. The mold forms a white crust and contributes to the smooth, runny, or gooey textures and more intense flavors of these aged cheeses. Goats' milk cheeses are often treated in a similar manner, sometimes with white molds (Ch<U+00E8>vre-Bo<U+00EE>te) and sometimes with blue.

Blue-mold cheese is a category comprised of many specific cheeses, all of which are lumped together under the common monicker [[blue cheese]]. In reality, there are many different kinds, including [[Roquefort (cheese)|Roquefort]], [[Gorgonzola (cheese)|Gorgonzola]], and [[Stilton (cheese)|Stilton]]. They are generally produced by inoculating loosely pressed curds with ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]'' or ''[[Penicillium glaucum]]'' molds. The mold grows within the cheese as it ages. These cheeses have distinct blue veins and, often, assertive flavors. Their texture can be soft or firm. "Roka blue cheese", for example, is roquefort cheese, considered by some to be as different from stilton and gorgonzola as [[parmesan]] is from [[romano]] or [[asiago]].

====Washing====
Washed-rind cheeses are periodically bathed in a saltwater [[brine]] as they age, making their surfaces amenable to a class of bacteria (the reddish-orange "smear bacteria") which impart pungent odors and distinctive flavors. Washed-rind cheeses can be soft ([[Limburger cheese|Limburger]]), semi-hard ([[Munster (cheese)|Munster]]), or hard ([[Appenzeller (cheese)|Appenzeller]]).

====Processed cheese====
[[Processed cheese]] is made from traditional cheese and emulsifying salts, often with the addition of milk, more salt, [[preservative]]s, and [[food coloring]]. It is inexpensive, consistent, and melts smoothly. This is the most-consumed category of cheese in the [[United States]]. The most familiar processed cheese may be pre-sliced mild yellow American Cheese or [[Velveeta]]. Many other varieties exist, including [[Easy Cheese]], a [[Kraft Foods]] brand sold in a spray can.

==Health and nutrition==
[[Image:Cheese market Basel.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Cheese selection on market stand in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].]]
In general, cheese supplies a great deal of [[calcium]], [[protein]], and [[phosphorus]]. A 30-gram (about one&nbsp;ounce) serving of cheddar cheese contains about seven&nbsp;grams of protein and 200&nbsp;milligrams of calcium. Nutritionally, cheese is essentially concentrated milk: it takes about 200&nbsp;grams (seven&nbsp;ounces) of milk to provide that much protein, and 150&nbsp;grams to equal the calcium.<ref>Nutritional data from [http://www.cnn.com/FOOD/resources/food.for.thought/dairy/compare.dairy.html CNN Interactive]. Retrieved [[October 20]] [[2004]].</ref>

Cheese shares milk's nutritional disadvantages as well. The [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] describes cheese as America's number one source of [[saturated fat]], adding that the average American ate 30&nbsp;pounds (13.6&nbsp;kg) of cheese in the year 2000, up from 11&nbsp;pounds (5&nbsp;kg) in 1970.<ref>Center for Science in the Public Interest (2001). [http://www.cspinet.org/new/cheese.html Don't Say Cheese]. Retrieved [[October 15]] [[2005]].</ref> Their recommendation is to limit full-fat cheese consumption to two&nbsp;ounces (60&nbsp;grams) a week. Whether cheese's highly saturated fat actually leads to an increased risk of heart disease is called into question when considering [[France]] and [[Greece]], which lead the world in cheese eating (more than 14&nbsp;ounces (400&nbsp;grams) a week per person, or over 45&nbsp;pounds (20&nbsp;kg) a year) yet have relatively low rates of heart disease.<ref>McGee, p 67. McGee supports both this contention and that more food poisonings in Europe are caused by pasteurized cheeses than raw-milk.</ref> This seeming discrepancy is called the [[French Paradox]]; the higher rates of consumption of [[red wine]] in these countries is often invoked as at least a partial explanation.


Some studies claim to show that cheeses including Cheddar, Mozzarella, Swiss and American can help to prevent [[tooth decay]].<ref>National Dairy Council. [http://www.nationaldairycouncil.org/NationalDairyCouncil/Nutrition/Products/cheesePage6.htm Specific Health Benefits of Cheese]. Retrieved [[October 15]] [[2005]].</ref> Several mechanisms for this protection have been proposed:
* The calcium, protein, and phosphorus in cheese may act to protect [[tooth enamel]].
* Cheese increases saliva flow, washing away acids and sugars.
* Cheese may have an antibacterial effect in the mouth.

===Controversy===

====Opiate====

Cheese is produced with [[casein]], a substance that breaks down, when digested by humans, into several chemicals including [[casomorphine]], an [[opiate]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=1374738&dopt=Abstract | title = A naturally occurring opioid peptide from cow's milk, beta-casomorphine-7, is a direct histamine releaser in man | author = Kurek M. | coauthors = Przybilla B., Hermann K., Ring J. | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information | accessdate = 2007-04-16}}</ref> Cheese is (and, to a lesser extent, other dairy products are) therefore suspected by some to play a role in behavioral disorders among children, especially with regards to [[autism]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://autism.healingthresholds.com/therapy/casein-free-diet | title = Casein-Free Diet | year = 2006 | publisher = Healing Thresholds | accessdate = 2007-04-16}}</ref>

Some even go so far as to promote casein-free diets for everyone.<ref>[http://www.enabling.org/ia/celiac/aut/autintro.html]</ref> It is also one of the reasons cited by some [[vegan]]s, for avoiding dairy as well as meat.<ref>[http://www.vegsource.com/articles2/barnard_food_seduction.htm]</ref>

====Cancer====

Casein, and therefore cheese, is also a suspected carcinogen [http://www.vegsource.com/articles2/barnard_food_seduction.htm].

====Lactose====

Cheese is often avoided by those who are [[lactose intolerance|lactose intolerant]], but ripened cheeses like [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] contain only about 5% of the [[lactose]] found in whole [[milk]], and aged cheeses contain almost none.<ref>[http://www.ilovecheese.com/lactose_intolerant_faqs.asp Lactose Intolerance FAQs] from the American Dairy Association. Retrieved [[October 15]] [[2005]].</ref> Some people suffer reactions to [[amines]] found in cheese, particularly [[histamine]] and [[tyramine]]. Some aged cheeses contain significant concentrations of these amines, which can trigger symptoms mimicking an [[allergic reaction]]: [[headache]]s, [[rash]]es, and [[blood pressure]] elevations.

====Obesity====

It should also perhaps be noted that under certain scientifically controlled dietery studies, people whose diets which particularly consisted of the high intake of dairy foods had shown that obesity had prevailed at a higher rate than of those persons whose diets consisted of only vegetable based fats.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

====Pasturization====

A number of food safety agencies around the world have warned of the risks of raw-milk cheeses. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] states that soft raw-milk cheeses can cause "serious infectious diseases including [[listeriosis]], [[brucellosis]], [[salmonellosis]] and [[tuberculosis]]".<ref>[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2005/fda_cheese.html FDA Warns About Soft Cheese Health Risk]. Retrieved [[October 15]] [[2005]].</ref> It is U.S. law since 1944 that all raw-milk cheeses (including imports since 1951) must be aged at least 60 days. [[Australia]] has a wide ban on raw-milk cheeses as well, though in recent years exceptions have been made for Swiss [[Gruy<U+00E8>re (cheese)|Gruy<U+00E8>re]], [[Emmental (cheese)|Emmental]] and [[Sbrinz]], and for French [[Roquefort (cheese)|Roquefort]].<ref>Chris Mercer (2005). [http://www.ap-foodtechnology.com/news/ng.asp?id=62799-fsanz-roquefort-speciality-cheese Australia lifts Roquefort cheese safety ban]. Retrieved [[October 22]] [[2005]].</ref> 

Government-imposed pasturization is, itself, controversial. Some say these worries are overblown, pointing out that [[pasteurization]] of the milk used to make cheese does not ensure its safety in any case.<ref>Janet Fletcher. [http://www.specialtyfood.com/do/news/ViewNewsArticle?id=1841 The Myths About Raw-Milk Cheese]. Retrieved [[October 15]] [[2005]].</ref> 

This is supported by statistics showing that in Europe (where young raw-milk cheeses are still legal in some countries), most cheese-related [[food poisoning]] incidents were traced to pasteurized cheeses. 

Pregnant women may face an additional risk from cheese; the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] has warned pregnant women against eating soft-ripened cheeses and blue-veined cheeses, due to the [[listeria]] risk to the unborn baby.<ref>[http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancycomplications/listeria.html Listeria and pregnancy], from the American Pregnancy Association. Retrieved [[28 February]] [[2006]].</ref>

==Making cheese==
===Curdling===
The only strictly required step in making any sort of cheese is separating the milk into solid [[curd]]s and liquid [[whey]]. Usually this is done by acidifying the milk and adding [[rennet]]. The acidification is accomplished directly by the addition of an acid like [[vinegar]] in a few cases ([[paneer]], [[queso fresco]]), but usually starter [[bacteria]] are employed instead. These starter bacteria convert [[Lactose|milk sugar]]s into [[lactic acid]]. The same bacteria (and the enzymes they produce) also play a large role in the eventual flavor of aged cheeses. Most cheeses are made with starter bacteria from the ''[[Lactococci]]'', ''[[Lactobacilli]]'', or ''[[Streptococci]]'' families.  [[Cheeses of Switzerland|Swiss]] starter cultures also include ''[[Propionibacter shermani]]'', which produces carbon dioxide gas bubbles during aging, giving [[Swiss cheese]] or [[Emmental (cheese)|Emmental]] its holes. 

Some fresh cheeses are curdled only by acidity, but most cheeses also use [[rennet]]. Rennet sets the cheese into a strong and rubbery [[gel]] compared to the fragile curds produced by acidic coagulation alone. It also allows curdling at a lower acidity&mdash;important because flavor-making bacteria are inhibited in high-acidity environments. In general, softer, smaller, fresher cheeses are curdled with a greater proportion of acid to rennet than harder, larger, longer-aged varieties.

===Curd processing===
[[Image:Production of cheese 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|During industrial production of [[Emmental (cheese)|Emmental]] cheese, the as-yet-undrained curd is broken up by rotating mixers.]]
At this point, the cheese has set into a very moist gel. Some soft cheeses are now essentially complete: they are drained, salted, and packaged. For most of the rest, the curd is cut into small cubes. This allows water to drain from the individual pieces of curd.

Some hard cheeses are then heated to temperatures in the range of 35<U+00B0>C&ndash;55<U+00B0>C (100<U+00B0>F&ndash;130<U+00B0>F). This forces more whey from the cut curd. It also changes the taste of the finished cheese, affecting both the bacterial culture and the milk chemistry. Cheeses that are heated to the higher temperatures are usually made with [[thermophilic]] starter bacteria which survive this step&mdash;either [[lactobacilli]] or [[Streptococcus salivarius|streptococci]].

[[Edible salt|Salt]] has a number of roles in cheese besides adding a salty flavor. It preserves cheese from spoiling, draws moisture from the curd, and firms up a cheese<U+2019>s texture in an interaction with its [[protein]]s. Some cheeses are salted from the outside with dry salt or brine washes. Most cheeses have the salt mixed directly into the curds.

A number of other techniques can be employed to influence the cheese's final texture and flavor. Some examples:
*Stretching: ([[Mozzarella]], [[Provolone (cheese)|Provolone]]) The curd is stretched and kneaded in hot water, developing a stringy, fibrous body. 
*Cheddaring: ([[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]], other English cheeses) The cut curd is repeatedly piled up, pushing more moisture away. The curd is also mixed (or ''milled'') for a long period of time, taking the sharp edges off the cut curd pieces and influencing the final product's texture.
*Washing: ([[Edam (cheese)|Edam]], [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]], [[Colby cheese|Colby]]) The curd is washed in warm water, lowering its acidity and making for a milder-tasting cheese.

Most cheeses achieve their final shape when the curds are pressed into a mold or form. The harder the cheese, the more pressure is applied. The pressure drives out moisture &mdash; the molds are designed to allow water to escape &mdash; and unifies the curds into a single solid body.

===Aging===
A newborn cheese is usually salty yet bland in flavor and, for harder varieties, rubbery in texture. These qualities are sometimes enjoyed&mdash;[[cheese curds]] are eaten on their own&mdash;but usually cheeses are left to rest under carefully controlled conditions. This aging period (also called ripening, or, from the [[French language|French]], ''affinage'') can last from a few days to several years.  As a cheese ages, microbes and enzymes transform its texture and intensify its flavor. This transformation is largely a result of the breakdown of [[casein]] [[proteins]] and [[butterfat|milkfat]] into a complex mix of [[amino acid]]s, [[amine]]s, and [[fatty acid]]s.

[[Image:Vacherin_du_haut_Doubs.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Vacherin du Haut-Doubs cheese, a French cheese with a white ''Penicillium'' mold rind.]]Some cheeses have additional bacteria or [[mold]]s intentionally introduced to them before or during aging. In traditional cheesemaking, these microbes might be already present in the air of the aging room; they are simply allowed to settle and grow on the stored cheeses. More often today, prepared cultures are used, giving more consistent results and putting fewer constraints on the environment where the cheese ages.

For the [[blue cheese]]s ([[Roquefort (cheese)|Roquefort]], [[Stilton (cheese)|Stilton]], [[Gorgonzola (cheese)|Gorgonzola]]), ''[[Penicillium]]'' mold is introduced to the curd before molding. During aging, the blue molds (''[[Penicillium roqueforti|P. roqueforti]]'' or ''[[Penicillium glaucum|P. glaucum]]'' ) grow in the small fissures in the cheese, imparting a sharp flavor and aroma.  The same molds are also grown on the surface of some aged [[goat cheese]]s. The soft cheeses [[Brie (cheese)|Brie]] and [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]], among others, get a surface growth of other ''Penicillium'' species, white-colored ''[[Penicillium candida|P. candidum]]'' or ''[[Penicillium camemberti|P. camemberti]]''. The surface mold contributes to the interior texture and flavor of these small cheeses.

Some cheeses are periodically washed in a saltwater [[brine]] during their ripening. Not only does the brine carry flavors into the cheese (it might be seasoned with [[spice]]s or [[wine]]), but the salty environment may nurture the growth of the ''[[Brevibacterium linens]]'' bacteria, which can impart a very pronounced odor ([[Limburger cheese|Limburger]]) and interesting flavor. The same bacteria can also have some impact on cheeses that are simply ripened in [[humid]] conditions, like [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]]. Large populations of these "smear bacteria" show up as a sticky orange-red layer on some brine-washed cheeses.

Cheeses may be [[smoking (cooking technique)|smoked]] during aging to produce [[smoked cheese]]s. This adds a smoky flavor and a brown or yellow color.

== Eating and cooking ==

At [[refrigerator]] temperatures, the fat in a piece of cheese is as hard as unsoftened [[butter]], and its protein structure is stiff as well. Flavor and odor compounds are less easily liberated when cold. For improvements in flavor and texture, it is widely advised that cheeses be allowed to warm up to [[room temperature]] before eating. If the cheese is further warmed, to 26&ndash;32<U+00B0>C (80&ndash;90<U+00B0>F), the fats will begin to to "sweat out" as they go beyond soft to fully liquid.<ref>McGee, p. 63.</ref>

At higher temperatures, most cheeses melt. Rennet-curdled cheeses have a [[gel]]-like protein matrix that is broken down by heat. When enough protein bonds are broken, the cheese itself turns from a solid to a viscous liquid. Soft, high-moisture cheeses will melt at around 55<U+00B0>C (130<U+00B0>F), while hard, low-moisture cheeses such as Parmesan remain solid until they reach about 82<U+00B0>C (180<U+00B0>F).<ref>McGee, p. 64.</ref> Acid-set cheeses, including [[halloumi cheese|halloumi]], [[paneer]], some whey cheeses and many varieties of fresh [[goat cheese]], have a protein structure that remains intact at high temperatures. When cooked, these cheeses just get firmer as water evaporates. 

Some cheeses, like [[raclette]], melt smoothly; many tend to become stringy or suffer from a separation of their fats. Many of these can be coaxed into melting smoothly in the presence of acids or [[starch]]. [[Fondue]], with wine providing the acidity, is a good example of a smoothly-melted cheese dish.<ref>McGee, p. 66.</ref> Elastic stringiness is a quality that is sometimes enjoyed, in dishes including [[pizza]] and [[Welsh rabbit]]. Even a melted cheese eventually turns solid again, after enough moisture is cooked off.  The saying "you can't melt cheese twice" (meaning "some things can only be done once") refers to the fact that oils leach out during the first melting and are gone, leaving the non-meltable solids behind.  

As its temperature continues to rise, cheese will [[Non-enzymatic browning|brown]] and eventually burn.  Browned, partially-burned cheese has a particular distinct flavor of its own and is frequently used in cooking (e.g., sprinkling atop items before baking them).

==History==
[[Image:Kaesetheke-supermarkt.jpg|thumb|right|Variety of cheeses in a supermarket]]
Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate [[prehistory|recorded history]]. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheesemaking originated, either in [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]] or the [[the Middle East]], but the practice had spread within [[Europe]] prior to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times and had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the [[Ancient Rome|Roman Empire]] came into being. As [[Rome]]'s influence receded, distinct local cheesemaking techniques emerged. This diversity reached its peak in the early [[industrial age]] and has declined somewhat since then due to mechanization and economic factors.

Cheese has served as a hedge against famine and is a good travel food. It is valuable for its portability, long life, and high content of [[fat]], [[protein]], [[calcium]], and [[phosphorus]]. Cheese is lighter, more compact, and has a longer shelf life than the milk from which it is made. [[Cheesemaker]]s can place themselves near the center of a dairy region and benefit from fresher milk, lower milk prices, and lower shipping costs.  The substantial storage life of cheese lets a cheesemaker sell when prices are high or when money is needed.

===Origins===
The exact origins of cheesemaking are debated or unknown, and estimates range from around 8000 [[Common Era|BCE]] (when [[sheep]] were [[domestication|domesticated]]) to around 3000 BCE. Credit for the discovery most likely goes to [[nomad|nomadic]] [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes in [[Central Asia]], around the same time that they developed [[yogurt]], or to people in the [[Middle East]]. A common tale about the discovery of cheese tells of an [[Arab]] nomad carrying milk across the desert in a container made from an animal's stomach, only to discover the milk had been separated into [[curd]] and [[whey]] by the rennet from the stomach. 

Folktales aside, cheese likely began as a way of preserving soured and curdled milk through pressing and salting, with rennet introduced later&mdash; perhaps when someone noticed that cheese made in an animal stomach produced more solid and better-textured curds. The earliest [[archeology|archaeological]] evidence of cheesemaking has been found in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb murals, dating to about 2300 BCE. The earliest cheeses would likely have been quite sour and salty, similar in texture to rustic [[cottage cheese]] or [[feta]], a crumbly, flavorful Greek cheese.

From the Middle East, basic cheesemaking found its way into [[Europe]], where cooler climates meant less aggressive salting was needed for preservation. With moderate salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for a variety of beneficial [[microbe]]s and molds, which are what give aged cheeses their pronounced and interesting flavors.

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
Ancient [[Hellenic civilization|Greek]] mythology credited [[Aristaeus]] with the discovery of cheese. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' ([[8th century BC|8th century BCE]]) describes the [[Cyclops]] making and storing sheep's and goats' milk cheese. From [[Samuel Butler (1835-1902)|Samuel Butler's]] translation:
{{cquote|We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went inside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could hold...</br> 
When he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each of them have her own young. He curdled half the milk and set it aside in [[wicker]] strainers.}}

By [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, cheese was an everyday food and cheesemaking a mature art, not very different from what it is today. [[Columella]]'s ''De Re Rustica'' (circa 65 CE) details a cheesemaking process involving rennet coagulation, pressing of the curd, salting, and aging. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']] (77 CE) devotes a chapter (XI, 97) to describing the diversity of cheeses enjoyed by Romans of the early [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. He stated that the best cheeses came from the villages near [[N<U+00EE>mes]], but did not keep long and had to be eaten fresh. Cheeses of the [[Alps]] and [[Apennines]] were as remarkable for their variety then as now. A [[Ligures|Ligurian]] cheese was noted for being made mostly from sheep's milk, and some cheeses produced nearby were stated to weigh as much as a thousand pounds each. Goats' milk cheese was a recent taste in Rome, improved over the "medicinal taste" of [[Gaul]]'s similar cheeses by [[smoking (food)|smoking]]. Of cheeses from overseas, Pliny preferred those of [[Bithynia]] in Asia Minor.

===Post-classical Europe===
[[Image:9-alimenti, formaggi,Taccuino Sanitatis, Casanatense 4182..jpg|thumb|250px|Cheese, [[Tacuinum sanitatis]] Casanatensis (XIV century)]]
Rome spread a uniform set of cheesemaking techniques throughout much of Europe, and introduced cheesemaking to areas without a previous history of it. As Rome declined and long-distance trade collapsed, cheese in Europe diversified further, with various locales developing their own distinctive cheesemaking traditions and products.  [[France]] and [[Italy]] are the nations with the most diversity in locally made cheeses&mdash; today with approximately 400 each. (A French proverb holds there is a different French cheese for every day of the year, and [[Charles de Gaulle]] once asked "how can you govern a country in which there are 246 kinds of cheese?"<ref>Quoted in [[Newsweek]], [[October 1]] [[1962]] according to ''The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations'' (Columbia University Press, 1993 ISBN 0-231-07194-9 p 345). Numbers besides 246 are often cited in very similar quotes; whether these are misquotes or whether de Gaulle repeated the same quote with different numbers is unclear.</ref>) Still, the advancement of the cheese art in Europe was slow during the centuries after Rome's fall. Many of the cheeses we know best today were first recorded in the late [[Middle Ages]] or after&mdash; cheeses like [[cheddar cheese|cheddar]] around 1500 CE, [[Parmesan cheese|Parmesan]] in 1597, [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]] in 1697, and [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]] in 1791.<ref>{{cite book | author=Smith, John H. | title=Cheesemaking in Scotland - A History | publisher=The Scottish Dairy Association | year=1995 | id=ISBN 0-9525323-0-1}}. [http://www.ebs.hw.ac.uk/SDA/publshr.html Full text], [http://www.ebs.hw.ac.uk/SDA/cheese1.html Chapter with cheese timetable].</ref>

In 1546, [[John Heywood]] wrote in ''Proverbes'' that "the moon is made of a greene cheese." (''Greene'' refers here not to the color, as many now think, but to being new or unaged.)<ref>Cecil Adams (1999). [http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a990723a.html Straight Dope: How did the moon=green cheese myth start?]. Retrieved [[October 15]] [[2005]].</ref> Variations on this sentiment were long repeated. Although some people assumed that this was a serious belief in the era before [[space exploration]], it is more likely that Heywood was indulging in [[nonsense]].

===Modern era===
Until its modern spread along with European culture, cheese was nearly unheard of in oriental cultures, uninvented in the pre-Columbian Americas, and of only limited use in sub-mediterranean Africa, mainly being widespread and popular only in Europe and areas influenced strongly by its cultures. But with the spread, first of European imperialism, and later of Euro-American culture and food, cheese has gradually become known and increasingly popular worldwide, though still rarely considered a part of local ethnic cuisine.

[[Image:Cheese 39 bg 053006b.jpg|thumb|St. Pat Goat's Milk Cheese ]]
The first factory for the industrial production of cheese opened in Switzerland in 1815, but it was in the United States where large-scale production first found real success. Credit usually goes to Jesse Williams, a dairy farmer from [[Rome, New York|Rome]], [[New York]], who in 1851 started making cheese in an [[assembly line|assembly-line]] fashion using the milk from neighboring farms. Within decades hundreds of such dairy associations existed.

The 1860s saw the beginnings of mass-produced rennet, and by the turn of the century scientists were producing pure microbial cultures. Before then, bacteria in cheesemaking had come from the environment or from recycling an earlier batch's whey; the pure cultures meant a more standardized cheese could be produced. 

Factory-made cheese overtook traditional cheesemaking in the [[World War II]] era, and factories have been the source of most cheese in America and Europe ever since. Today, Americans buy more [[processed cheese]] than "real", factory-made or not.<ref>{{cite book | author=McGee, Harold | title=On Food and Cooking (Revised Edition) | publisher=Scribner | year=2004 | id=ISBN 0-684-80001-2}} p 54. "In the United States, the market for process cheese [...] is now larger than the market for 'natural' cheese, which itself is almost exclusively factory-made."</ref>

==World production and consumption==
Worldwide, cheese is a major [[agriculture|agricultural]] product. According to the [[Food and Agricultural Organization]] of the [[United Nations]], over 18 million [[metric ton]]s of cheese were produced worldwide in 2004. This is more than the yearly production of [[coffee]] beans, [[tea]] leaves, [[cocoa]] beans and [[tobacco]] combined. The largest producer of cheese is the United States, accounting for 30 percent of world production, followed by Germany and France.

The biggest exporter of cheese, by monetary value, is France; the second, Germany (although it is first by quantity). Among the top ten exporters, only Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Australia have a cheese production that is mainly export oriented: respectively 95 percent, 90 percent, 72 percent, and 65 percent of their cheese production is exported.<ref>Sources: FAO and Eurostat.</ref> Only 30 percent of French production, the world's largest exporter, is exported. The United States, the biggest world producer of cheese, is a marginal exporter, as most of its production is for the domestic market.

Greece is the world's largest ([[per capita]]) consumer of cheese, with 27.3 kg eaten by the average Greek. ([[Feta]] accounts for three-quarters of this consumption.) France is the second biggest consumer of cheese, with 24 kg by inhabitant. [[Emmental (cheese)|Emmental]] (used mainly as a cooking ingredient) and [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]] are the most common cheeses in France<ref>Cidilait, ''Le fromage'' [http://www.cidil.fr/1152.0.html?&i=2&j=3]</ref> Italy is the third biggest consumer by person with 22.9 kg. In the U.S., the consumption of cheese is quickly increasing and has nearly tripled between 1970 and 2003. The consumption per person has reached, in 2003, 14.1 kg (31 pounds). [[Fior di latte]] (commonly known as mozzarella) is America's favorite cheese and accounts for nearly a third of its consumption, mainly due to it being one of the main ingredients of pizza.<ref>Source USDA [http://www.ers.usda.gov/AmberWaves/February05/Findings/CheeseConsumption.htm]</ref>

==Cultural attitudes==
[[Image:Cormeilles Market 9 Artlibre jnl.jpg|thumb|right|A cheese seller in a French market]]
Cheese is rarely found in [[Asian cuisine|East Asian]] dishes, as [[dairy product]]s in general are rare. However, East Asian sentiment against cheese is not universal. Cheese made from [[yak]]s' (''chhurpi'') or [[Mare (horse)|mares']] milk is common on the Asian [[steppe]]s; the national dish of [[Bhutan]], ''ema datsi'', is made from homemade cheese and hot peppers; and cheese is used in [[Cuisine of India|India]], where [[paneer]] [[curry|curries]] are popular. [[Yunnan cheese]] is produced by several ethnic minority groups in the [[Yunnan]] province of China by mixing water buffalo milk and rice vinegar. Cheese consumption is increasing in China, with annual sales more than doubling from 1996 to 2003 (to a still small 30 million [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] a year).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rebecca Buckman | title=Let Then Eat Cheese | journal=Far Eastern Economic Review | year=2003 | volume=166 n. 49 | pages=41}} [http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/2003/1211chinacheese.htm Full text]</ref> Certain kinds of Chinese preserved [[Bean curd#Fermented|bean curd]] are sometimes misleadingly referred to in English as "Chinese cheese", due to their texture and strong flavor.

Strict followers of the dietary laws of [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] must avoid cheeses made with rennet from animals not slaughtered in a manner adhering to [[kosher foods|kosher]] or [[halal]]<ref>Toronto Public Health. [http://www.toronto.ca/health/nm_faq_halal_foods.htm Frequently Asked Questions about Halal Foods]. Retrieved [[October 15]] [[2005]].</ref> laws. Both faiths allow cheese made with vegetable-based rennet or with rennet made from animals that were processed in a kosher or halal manner. Many less-orthodox Jews also believe that rennet undergoes enough processing to change its nature entirely, and do not consider it to ever violate kosher law. (See ''[[Kosher foods#Cheese|Cheese and kashrut]]''.) As cheese is a dairy food under kosher rules it cannot be eaten in the same meal with any meat.

Many [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]]s avoid any cheese made from animal-based rennet. Most widely available vegetarian cheeses are made using rennet produced by fermentation of the [[fungus]] ''Mucor miehei''. [[Vegan]]s and other dairy-avoiding vegetarians do not eat real cheese at all, but some vegetable-based substitute cheeses (usually [[soybean|soy]]-and [[almond]]-based) are available.

Even in cultures with long cheese traditions, it is not unusual to find people who perceive cheese &mdash; especially pungent-smelling or mold-bearing varieties such as [[Limburger cheese|Limburger]] or [[Roquefort (cheese)|Roquefort]] &mdash; as unappetizing, unpalatable, or disgusting. Food-science writer [[Harold McGee]] proposes that cheese is such an acquired taste because it is produced through a process of controlled [[Decomposition|spoilage]] and many of the odor and flavor molecules in an aged cheese are the same found in rotten foods. McGee notes "An aversion to the odor of decay has the obvious biological value of steering us away from possible food poisoning, so it's no wonder that an animal food that gives off whiffs of shoes and soil and the stable takes some getting used to."<ref>McGee p 58, "Why Some People Can't Stand Cheese."</ref>

==Cheese in language==
Throughout the history of the [[English language]], the word ''cheese'' has been ''chese'' (in [[Middle English]]) and ''c<U+012B>ese'' or ''c<U+0113>se'' (in [[Old English]]). Similar words are shared by other [[West Germanic languages]] &mdash; [[Frisian language|Frisian]] ''tsiis'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''kaas'', [[German language|German]] ''K<U+00E4>se'', [[Old High German]] ''ch<U+0101>si'' &mdash; all of which probably come from the reconstructed West-Germanic root ''*kasjus'', which in turn is an early borrowing from Latin. The [[Latin]] word ''caseus'' &mdash; from which are derived the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''queso'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''queijo'', [[Malay Language|Malay/Indonesian Language]] ''keju'' (a borrowing from the Portuguese word queijo), [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''ca<U+015F>'' and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''cacio'' &mdash; and the [[Celtic languages|Celtic root]] which gives the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''c<U+00E1>is'' and the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''caws'' are also related. This whole group of words is probably derived from the [[proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] root ''*kwat-'', which means "to ferment, become sour". 

When the Romans began to make hard cheeses for their legionaries' supplies, a new word started to be used: ''formaticum'', from ''caseus formatus'', or "molded cheese". It is from this word that we get the [[French language|French]] ''fromage'', [[Italian language|Italian]] ''formaggio'', [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''formatge'', [[Breton language|Breton]] ''fourmaj'' and [[Proven<U+00E7>al language|Proven<U+00E7>al]] ''furmo''. ''Cheese'' itself is occasionally employed in a sense that means "molded" or "formed". ''[[Head cheese]]'' uses the word in this sense. 

In modern English [[slang]], something "cheesy" is [[kitsch]], cheap, inauthentic, or of poor quality. One can also be "cheesed off"&mdash; unhappy or annoyed. Such negative connotations might derive from a ripe cheese's sometimes-unpleasant odor.  Almost certainly the odor explains the use of "cutting the cheese" as a [[euphemism]] for [[flatulence]], and the term "cheesy feet" to mean [[foot|feet]] which smell. A more upbeat slang use is seen in "the big cheese", an expression referring to the most important person in a group, the "big shot" or "head honcho". This use of the word probably derived not from the word ''cheese'', but from the [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Hindi language|Hindi]] word ''chiz'', meaning ''a thing''.<ref>Michael Quinion (2000). [http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-big1.htm World Wide Words: Big Cheese]. Retrieved [[October 15]] [[2005]].</ref>

A more whimsical bit of American and Canadian slang refers to school buses as "cheese wagons", a reference to [[school bus yellow]]. Subjects of [[photograph]]s are often encouraged to "[[say cheese]]!", as the word "cheese" contains the [[phoneme]] [[Close front unrounded vowel|/i/]], a [[long vowel]] which requires the lips to be stretched in the appearance of a [[smile]].<ref>Straight Dope Staff Report (2005). [http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/msaycheese.html Why do photographers ask you to say "cheese"?]. Retrieved [[October 15]] [[2005]].</ref> People from [[Wisconsin]] and the [[Netherlands]], both centers of cheese production, have been called [[cheesehead]]s. This nickname has been embraced by Wisconsin sports fans &mdash; especially fans of the [[Green Bay Packers]] or [[University of Wisconsin-Madison|Wisconsin Badgers]] &mdash; who are now seen in the stands sporting plastic or foam hats in the shape of giant cheese wedges.
