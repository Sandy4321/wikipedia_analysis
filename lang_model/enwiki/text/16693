==Historical==
Flintham ''"is a pleasant and well-built village, 6<U+00BD> miles south-west by south of Newark, including within its parish 637 inhabitants and {{convert|2110|acre|km2}} of rich loamy land, at a rateable value of <U+00A3>3,324, which was enclosed about the year 1780, when {{convert|172|acre|km2}} were allotted to the vicar, and about {{convert|300|acre|km2}} to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], in lieu of tithes, exclusive of {{convert|165|acre|km2}} which had previously belonged to the said college.

Although Thoroton received no order in council for land in East Florida, he was a member of the East Florida Society and also of the Nova Scotia Society of London as well. Thoroton was the link between the East Florida and Nova Scotia speculators, particularly after [[Richard Oswald 1705-1784|Richard Oswald]] and [[James Grant (British army officer)|James Grant]] decided to give up their Nova Scotia interests and concentrate on Florida.[http://brokert10.fcla.edu/DLData/CF/FullText/fhq_54_4.txt] Apparently Thomas Thoroton and Levett Blackborne often acted in concert in business matters.[http://books.google.com/books?id=IgoRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA313&vq=levett&dq=%22thomas+thoroton%22+marquess+of+granby&source=gbs_search_r&cad=0_1#PPA315,M1]</ref> His eldest son [[Thomas Thoroton-Hildyard|Thomas Blackborne Thoroton Hildyard]] (1821<U+2013>1888) also lived at Flintham Hall and was educated at Eton and Oxford.

It was a toughly contested election. Hildyard was supported, according to the University of Nottingham, by the 4th Duke of Newcastle under Lyne "in spite of the fact that Newcastle's son, the Earl of Lincoln, was his opponent. Lincoln attacked Hildyard's youth and inexperience, but the 'young squire' still defeated him by a majority of almost 700. Hildyard held South Nottinghamshire from 1846 until 1852. He was re-elected in 1866.

==Myles Thoroton Hildyard==
In 2005 the family's best-known representative, [[Myles Thoroton Hildyard]], landowner and historian, died at Flintham. Hildyard, a Cambridge-educated landowner and historian, won the Military Cross for his daring escape from a prisoner of war camp following the Battle of Crete.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article560627.ece Myles Hildyard: Soldier and aesthete who devoted his life in peacetime to improving his splendid house with gardens and woodlands, Obituary, The Times of London, 31 August 2005]</ref> He also became well known for his work at Flintham Hall, a Grade I-listed home, which ''The Independent'' noted in its obituary of Hildyard, has been described as "perhaps the most gloriously romantic Victorian house in England."<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/myles-hildyard-506709.html The Independent, 14 September 2005]</ref> Myles Hildyard had worked extensively during his tenure to restore the landscape park and woodland which enclose the Hall and the Conservatory, as well as the Hall's walled garden.
 
Myles Hildyard<ref>Hildyard's niece, Marianna Hildyard, is the wife of British Labour politician [[Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton]], whose title derives from his wife's family's name.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1999/dec/11/1]</ref> was also an historian and writer, and for 40 years served as President of The Thoroton Society, the leading Nottinghamshire history organisation named in honour of Dr. [[Robert Thoroton]], author of the first history of the county, ''The Antiquities of Nottinghamshire'', published in 1677, and the brother of Hildyard's ancestor Thomas Thoroton.<ref>[http://www.thorotonsociety.org.uk/events/lectures_winter200102.htm Commemorative Tree planted at Flintham Hall, The Thoroton Society, thorotonsociety.org.uk]</ref><ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/articles/tts/tts1908/autumn/robertthoroton.htm Dr. Robert Thoroton, Nottinghamshire History, nottshistory.org.uk]</ref> Myles Hildyard himself wrote detailed histories of the Thoroton and Hildyard families, as well as a history of Flintham village. In 1975 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries]]. But Hildyard's greatest literary accomplishment were the wartime letters and the diary he wrote during the Second World War, when he served as [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in [[Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry|Nottinghamshire Yeomanry (Sherwood Rangers)]]. Hildyard was captured by the Germans during their airborne invasion, but he eventually escaped from the prisoner-of-war camp where he was being held. His letters home as well as the diary he kept during his escape were collected into a book published by Bloomsbury in 2005 entitled ''It is Bliss Here: Letters Home, 1939<U+2013>1945''.<ref>''It is Bliss Here'', published by Bloomsbury in England, is ISBN 0-7475-7802-8.</ref> For his wartime exploits, Capt. Hildyard was appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]].<ref>[http://www.sal.org.uk/salon/index_html?id=289 SALON <U+2013> The Society of Antiquaries of London Online Newsletter, sal.org.uk]</ref>

Hildyard also served as [[Deputy Lieutenant]] and [[Justice of the Peace]] for Nottinghamshire. He was [[Lord of the Manor]] of Flintham and of Screveton, and patron of the living of Flintham. Hildyard was a barrister of [[Lincoln's Inn]] but chose not to practice law.

Aside from his efforts as writer, historian and architectural restorer, Myles Hildyard became known in the community for his good fellowship. "Flintham was, for the years Myles Hildyard was its guardian," noted The Independent in its recent obituary, "a most remarkable place to visit. Not just because of the beauty and richness of its physical surroundings, but also because he himself was so remarkable a person. 'He was, in a way,' writes [[Antony Beevor]],<ref>Historian and writer Antony Beever wrote the introduction to the Hildyard book published by Bloomsbury</ref> 'the local equivalent of Nancy Mitford's Lord Merlin.' At Flintham he encouraged and received a stream of visitors young and old, who brought lively conversation, stimulation and enjoyment to a house which, when his father inherited, had been a rather forbidding and lifeless place."<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/myles-hildyard-506709.html Myles Hildyard, 'Lord Merlin' of Flintham and author of a vivid account of the Second World War, Obituary, The Independent, 14 September 2005]</ref>

Myles Hildyard never married, and his two brothers predeceased him. He was the eldest son of Judge Gerard Moresby Thoroton Hildyard, [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] of Flintham Hall and his wife, the former Sybil Hamilton [[Sir Richard Colt Hoare, Bart.|Hoare]] of [[Stourton, Wiltshire]], and the grandson of [[Henry Hildyard|General Sir Henry John Thoroton Hildyard]], who was active in the [[Second Boer War]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article560627.ece Obituary, The Times of London, 31 August 2005]</ref> The [[Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire]], the county's foremost historical organisation, of which Myles Hildyard was longserving president, recently staged its first Myles Thoroton Annual Lecture Series, for which Thoroton had left a bequest in his will.<ref>[http://www.thorotonsociety.org.uk/events/lectures_winter200708.htm The Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire, thorotonsociety.org.uk]</ref> Myles Hildyard was buried 24 August 2005, at St. Augustine's Church in Flintham, where many of his ancestors lay.

Flintham Hall is a grade I listed country house which stands in the Flintham estate on the western edge of Flintham village. It was built in 1798 on the site of an earlier house bought from the Disney family in 1789. It was extended in 1820<U+2013>30 by the architect [[Lewis Wyatt]] for Col. T. Thoroton and again remodelled between 1853 and 1859 by [[George Thomas Hine]] for Thomas Blackborne Thoroton Hildyard. It is built in two and three storeys, 11 bays wide and 3 bays deep with an attached glassed Victorian conservatory. The conservatory, influenced by London's Crystal Palace, is the finest of its type left in England.<ref>[http://www.rushcliffe.gov.uk/doc.asp?cat=9995 Flintham Hall, Rushcliffe Borough Council, rushcliffe.gov.uk]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-448096-flintham-hall-and-adjoining-terrace-wall|title= Flintham Hall and Adjoining Terrace Wall, Flintham|publisher= British Listed Buildings|accessdate= 11 February 2014}}</ref>
