'''''Reaper''''' is a restored historic [[Fifie]] [[herring]] [[Drifter (fishing boat)|drifter]] which is registered by the [[National Historic Ships Committee]] as part of the Core Collection of historic vessels in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and currently operates as a [[museum ship]].

==History==
Built by J. & G. Forbes of [[Sandhaven]] in 1901, she is 21 metres long and of [[Carvel (boat building)|carvel]] construction, using [[larch]] planking on larch and [[oak]] frames. First registered at [[Fraserburgh]] in 1902, she operated initially as a sailing [[lugger]] with a [[Mast (sailing)|main]] dipping [[lugger|lugsail]] and a [[Mast (sailing)|mizzen]] standing lug sail. There would have been a crew of around eight to work the nets which were set at [[dusk]] and hauled in at [[dawn]]. Once the haul was complete, a swift return to port would ensure the best prices for the earliest-sold catches.

''Reaper'' later spent many years in [[Shetland]] fishing for herring in the summer and she was fitted with an engine between the Wars. During [[World War II]] she was requisitioned by the [[Admiralty]] and served in the southeast of [[England]], often being used as a [[barrage balloon]] mooring. After the war, she resumed fishing in Shetland and continued until 1957. She holds the record catch for Shetland of 233 [[cran (unit)|cran]] (almost 250,000 herrings).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} 

From 1959 she served the local council as a general purpose [[cargo]] boat until the introduction of the [[RORO|roll on-roll off ferries]] when she was retired from service. 

==''Reaper'' today==
''Reaper'' was purchased by the [[Scottish Fisheries Museum]] in [[Anstruther]], [[Fife]] in 1975 and restored to her traditional sailing configuration as a two-masted sailing lugger, much as she would have appeared when first going to sea in 1902. Renamed ''Reaper FR958'', she is one of the last authentic survivors of this type of vessel, once plentiful on the east coast of [[Scotland]].

Listed as part of the [[National Historic Fleet, Core Collection]], she sails regularly in the summer months. When not sailing, the boat is berthed in Anstruther harbour opposite the fisheries museum. In 2003 she visited 14 ports around Britain, attracting 24,000 visitors. In 2005 she visited 12 ports around Britain, including a visit to the [[Festival of the Sea]] in [[Portsmouth]], and attracted 20,000 visitors.

In 2001, with seven people aboard, she was the centre of an emergency off the coast of northeast [[England]] when she began to take on water due to the failure of a [[bilge pump]]. A rescue helicopter was scrambled from [[RAF Boulmer]] in [[Northumberland]]. A [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] dispatched from [[Amble]] transferred a new pump and escorted her to harbour for repairs.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1479855.stm| title=Museum ship saved from sinking| date=8 August 2001| publisher=[[BBC News]]| accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref>
