McKinney is the only Texas city in the top 10. (McKinney ISD Website))</ref> McKinney is one of several fast-growing communities on the northeastern edge of the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]]. Both the city and county are named after [[Collin McKinney]], a signer of the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]], and a congressman for the Red River district of the [[Republic of Texas]].

==History==
McKinney was named for Collin McKinney, signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence and author of a bill establishing counties in the northern part of the state. On March 24, 1849, William Davis, who owned {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} where McKinney now stands, donated {{convert|120|acre|km2}} for the townsite. Ten years later McKinney was incorporated, and in 1913 the town adopted the commission form of government.

For the first 125 years of its history McKinney served as the principal commercial center for the county. The county seat provided farmers with flour, corn, and cotton mills, cotton gins, a cotton compress and cottonseed oil mill, as well as banks, churches, schools, newspapers, and, from the 1880s, an opera house. Businesses also came to include a textile mill, an ice company, a large dairy, and a garment-manufacturing company.
The population grew from 35 in 1848 to 4,714 in 1912. By 1953 McKinney had a population of more than 10,000 and 355 businesses. The town continued to serve as an agribusiness center for the county until the late 1960s.

By 1970, McKinney was surpassed in size by Plano. McKinney experienced moderate population growth, from 15,193 in the 1970 census, to 21,283 in the 1990 census. By the mid-1980s the town had become a commuter center for residents who worked in Plano and Dallas. In 1985 it had a population of just over 16,000 and supported 254 businesses. Since then, McKinney's rate of increase has been much more dramatic. In the 2000 census, McKinney had grown to 54,369 with 2,005 businesses, and in the Census Bureau's 2006 estimate, the population was 107,530. The current population for McKinney (2010) is rounded up to 128,000.

In 2010, McKinney was ranked number 5 in ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'''s list of best small cities in the United States.<ref>"[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2010/snapshots/PL2718116.html?hpt=C1 Best Places to Live Money's list of America's best small cities]."

Though McKinney has grown like mad over the past decade, you'd never suspect it when driving through its tree-filled communities surrounded by ponds, parks, and hiking trails."

Over the last several years McKinney has gained national media attention for the multiple [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] and sustainable (Green) buildings that have been constructed within the city.  McKinney is home of the first privately developed [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum office building, which was speculatively developed by Westworld Holdings, as well as Roy Lee Walker Elementary, the first sustainable school in Texas.  [[Pat Lobb Toyota]] (designed by [[Gensler]]) is the first LEED certified Automotive Dealership (NC Silver Rating), and has become the hallmark for the greening of automotive dealerships, receiving visitors from around the world.

Additionally, one of the two experimental sustainable Wal-Mart stores is in McKinney ([[Wal-Mart]] did not pursue [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] status). The facility has been designed to test and promote a number of sustainable design elements and concepts, including [[photovoltaic array]]s, [[rainwater harvesting]], a waste-oil heating system, and two [[wind turbine]]s of 50&nbsp;kW and 1&nbsp;kW [[Intermittent power source#Terminology|nameplate capacity]] from Bergey Windpower.<ref name="sustainable_walmart">

A housing development in McKinney, [[Adriatica McKinney, Texas|Adriatica]] in [[Stonebridge Ranch]], recently made the news in [[Croatia]], as it is being built as a partial faithful replica of the town of [[Supetar]] on the Croatian island of [[Bra<U+010D>]].<ref name="slobodna_adriatica">[http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Mozaik/tabid/80/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/53692/Default.aspx "A Million Dollars for a Villa in American Supetar"], article on Adriatica McKinney in [[Slobodna Dalmacija]] {{hr icon}}</ref>
