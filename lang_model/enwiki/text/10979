The '''''Millennium'' Bridge''' ({{lang-tt|<U+041C><U+0438><U+043B><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+0438><U+0443><U+043C> <U+043A><U+04AF><U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0435>|Millennium K<U+00FC>pere}}, [[Russian language|Russian]]: <U+041C><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442> <U+041C><U+0438><U+043B><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+0438><U+0443><U+043C>) is a [[cable-stayed bridge]] that spans [[Kazanka River]], in [[Kazan]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Russia]]. Its name originates from [[Kazan]]'s thousand anniversary, widely celebrated in [[2005]] and the shape of its M-like pylon. 

The construction of the bridge began in 2004, the first part was ready in 2005 and the second part in 2007. The building cost was approximately 94 million [[euro]]s.

The bridge is 831 m long. The main part of this bridge is the 45-m [[Abutment|pylon]] which looks like the letter M. This form originates from ''Me<U+00F1>y<U+0131>ll<U+0131>q'' ([[Cyrillic]]: <U+041C><U+0435><U+04A3><U+044A><U+0435><U+043B><U+043B><U+044B><U+043A>), the Tatar for ''thousand years old'', or its [[Latin language|Latin]] variant ''[[Millennium]]''. The roadway carries three lanes of traffic and a pedestrian walkway in each direction. The bridge connects [[Gorky park (Kazan)|Gorky park]] and [[Fatix <U+00C4>mirxan]] Avenue.
