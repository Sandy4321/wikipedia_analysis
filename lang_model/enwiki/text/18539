'''Pierre le Picard''' (1624-1679?) was a 17th century French buccaneer.<ref>[[Albert Montefiore Hyamson|Hyamson, Albert M.]] ''A Dictionary of Universal Biography of All Ages and All Peoples''. Baltimore, Maryland: Genealogical Publishing Company, 1995. (pg. 508)</ref> He was both an officer to [[l'Ollonais]] as well as Sir [[Henry Morgan]], most notably taking part in his raids at [[Maracaibo]] and [[Panama]], and may have been one of the first buccaneers to raid shipping on both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts.

==Biography==
Pierre le Picard is first referred to as an officer with [[l'Ollonais]] in his buccaneering expedition from [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]]. Leaving with the fleet, he commanded a [[brigantine]] with 40 men and was present at the later raids against [[Maracaibo]] and [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]] in 1666 and [[Puerto de Cavallo]] and [[San Pedro]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} in 1667.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pubcat.org.uk/history2.htm |title=17th Century Buccaneers on the Spanish Main: Part Two |accessdate= |author=Piractical Union of Buccaneers, Corsairs and Associated Trades |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2005 |month= |work= |publisher=Pubcat.org.uk |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> The fleet then stopped to regroup sometime after this point, capturing a Spanish ship off the coast of the Yucat<U+00E1>n, before l'Ollonais called a council of his officers. Although proposing to sail to [[Guatemala]], he and [[Moise Vauquelin]] opposed l'Ollonais' plan and, it is alleged, they encouraged the rest of the officers to leave their commander. The fleet did disband after this meeting, with Picard and Vauquelin leaving together to raid the coast of [[Costa Rica]]. The two successfully occupied and looted [[Veraguas]] that same year, however they parted ways after failing to capture the nearby town of [[Nata]]. This attack was included in [[Alexander Esquemeling]]'s ''The Buccaneers of America'' years later.

In 1669, he returned to Maracaibo once more as a guide for Sir [[Henry Morgan]] expedition and, two years later, joined him at [[Panama]] in command of the 10-gun ''Saint-Pierre''. Although his activities are unknown during the next few years, at least one published source reporting his death in 1679, he is mentioned by then acting Governor of Jamaica Sir Henry Morgab as being active against English and Spanish shipping near [[Port Royal]] in 1682.

He may have also been the Captain le Picard who, in early 1685, sailed with the French buccaneering expedition including [[Francis Grognet]] and a Captain Townley that crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] to raid unprotected Spanish settlements in the South Seas. They later joined with English buccaneers [[Edward Davis (buccaneer)|Edward Davis]], [[Charles Swan]] and [[Peter Harris (buccaneer)|Peter Harris]], although Picard apparently did not get along with their English partners. He returned to the Caribbean after the raid on Guayaquil in May 1687 and, while en route to [[Hispaniola]], looted the city of [[Segovia]] before eventually retired to [[Acadie]] in southeastern Canada. During [[King William's War]], he may have also commanded a small squadron during [[King William's War]] and attacked the English colony at [[Rhode Island]] in 1690 although was forced to withdraw due to heavy casualties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Garden/5213/vanclein.htm |title=Privateers and Pirates: Moise Vauquelin |accessdate= |author=Bruyneel, M. |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2005 |month= |work= |publisher=Isle of Tortuga |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>
