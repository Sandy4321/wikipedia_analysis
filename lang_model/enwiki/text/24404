===World Class Championship Wrestling (1980<U+2013>1982)===
Most of Kerry's fame was made in [[Texas]]' [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW), where he was nicknamed "The Modern Day Warrior." On December 28, 1980, his first [[WCWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA American Heavyweight Championship]] reign came after he defeated [[Gino Hernandez]] for the vacant title.<ref name="nwaamericantitle"/> He lost the title to [[Ken Patera]] before winning his second NWA American Heavyweight Championship from [[Bill Eadie|The Masked Superstar]].<ref name="nwaamericantitle"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldclasswrestling.info/results/1980res.htm#DEC|title=WCCW Results| accessdate=2008-05-08|date=1980-12-28|work=World Class Memories|first=John|last=Dananay}}</ref> In May and June 1981, Kerry exchanged the NWA American Heavyweight Championship with [[Ernie Ladd]].<ref name="nwaamericantitle"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/wccw/miscsw.html#0681|title=Wrestling Star Wars 6/81 results|accessdate=2008-05-07|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}</ref> On October 25, he teamed with Terry Orndorff and they defeated The [[Great Kabuki]] and Chan Chung to win the [[WCWA World Tag Team Championship|NWA American Tag Team Championship]].<ref name="americantagtitle"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/wccw/miscsw.html#1081|title=Wrestling Star Wars 10/81 results|accessdate=2008-05-07|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}</ref> After having short [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angles]] as a singles wrestler, he began teaming with his brother [[Kevin Von Erich|Kevin]].

Kerry started [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]]ing with the NWA World Heavyweight Champion [[Ric Flair]]. On August 15, he got his very first shot at the NWA title against Flair in a [[two out of three falls match]], which Flair won to retain the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/wccw/miscsw.html#0882|title=Slamboree 1998 results| accessdate=2008-05-07|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}</ref> On December 25, Kerry got his next title shot against Flair in a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|no disqualification]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]], with [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael "P.S."

Kerry's biggest career highlight was on May 6, 1984, when he beat "Nature Boy" [[Ric Flair]] in a historic match, in front of over 45,000 fans at [[Texas Stadium]] to win the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].<ref name="nwaworld">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/nwa/world/nwa-h.html|title=N.W.A.

Kerry has the [[List of NWA World Heavyweight Championship reigns by length|12th shortest NWA World title reign in history]]. In reality, the NWA only allowed Kerry a short reign due to his substance abuse, and he was told to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Drop|drop]] the belt to Flair before the May 29 encounter between Flair and [[Ricky Steamboat]].<ref name="acceleratorbio"/>

On July 4, the Von Erichs lost the six man tag title to the Fabulous Freebirds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldclasswrestling.info/results/1984res.htm#JUL|title=WCCW Results|accessdate=2008-05-08|date=1984-07-04|work=World Class Memories|first=John|last=Dananay}}</ref> The title was held up due to the Freebirds winning after interference by [[Killer Khan]]. On September 3, they defeated the Freebirds in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|Loser Leaves Texas match]] for his fourth six man tag title reign.<ref name="nwasixmantag"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldclasswrestling.info/results/1984res.htm#SEP|title=WCCW Results|accessdate=2008-05-08|date=1984-09-03|work=World Class Memories|first=John|last=Dananay}}</ref>

====Later feuds; amputation (1984<U+2013>1989)====
After ending their rivalry with the Fabulous Freebirds, Von Erich brothers next feuded with [[Gino Hernandez]], [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]], and [[Jake Roberts]]. Kerry's angle with Adams was born out of Adams' angle with his brother Kevin, which began on September 28, 1984 (when Adams [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] heel against Kevin following a tag team loss).  In order to remain on [[kayfabe]] terms, Adams and Kerry wrestled as a tag team two days later in San Antonio, since the heel turn had not aired on television yet. On October 27, 1984, Hernandez, Adams, and Roberts defeated the Von Erichs to win the Six Man Tag Title in a match that saw [[James Hines|Bobby Fulton]] substitute for an injured Kevin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldclasswrestling.info/results/1984res.htm#OCT|title=WCCW Results|accessdate=2008-05-08|date=1984-10-27|work=World Class Memories|first=John|last=Dananay}}</ref> On October 29, he defeated Gino Hernandez for his fifth NWA American Heavyweight Championship.<ref name="nwaamericantitle"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldclasswrestling.info/results/1984res.htm#OCT|title=WCCW Results|accessdate=2008-05-08|date=1984-10-29|work=World Class Memories|first=John|last=Dananay}}</ref> On November 22, he teamed with [[King Parsons|Iceman Parsons]] to defeat Jake Roberts and [[Kelly Kiniski]].<ref name="November 22, 1984">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldclasswrestling.info/results/1984res.htm#NOV|title=WCCW Results|accessdate=2008-05-08|date=1984-11-22|work=World Class Memories|first=John|last=Dananay}}</ref> He later [[Referee (professional wrestling)|refereed]] a Texas Deathmatch between longtime rival Terry Gordy and Killer Khan, which Gordy won, via Kerry's decision. On December 25, Kerry again got a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, a title he had lost many months ago. The champion Ric Flair intentionally got disqualified to retain the title.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.worldclasswrestling.info/results/1984res.htm#DEC|title=WCCW Results|accessdate=2008-05-08|date=1984-12-25|work=World Class Memories|first=John|last=Dananay}}</ref> On December 31, the Von Erichs defeated Hernandez, Roberts, and Adams to regain their NWA Six-Man Tag Team Title.<ref name="nwasixmantag"/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.worldclasswrestling.info/results/1984res.htm#DEC|title=WCCW Results|accessdate=2008-05-08|date=1984-12-31|work=World Class Memories|first=John|last=Dananay}}</ref>

On June 4, 1986, Kerry was in a motorcycle accident that nearly ended his life and left him with a dislocated hip and a badly injured right leg. Doctors eventually had to [[amputation|amputate]] his right foot.<ref name=NWAstory>{{cite book|title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling|last=Hornbaker|first=Tim|pages=337<U+2013>338|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}</ref> According to brother Kevin, Kerry injured the foot following surgery by attempting to walk on it prematurely, crushing the bones beyond repair and thus forcing the doctors to amputate it. He was able to continue wrestling after the accident with a fused ankle. Kerry was able to keep his amputation secret for a while. However, during a match on an [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]] card in Las Vegas against [[Edward Wiskoski|Colonel DeBeers]], Kerry's secret was exposed. During the bout, DeBeers ended up on the outside, but he grabbed Kerry's foot and tried to pull him out of the ring. However, he ended up pulling off Kerry's boot with the prosthetic foot attached.

During his last days in WCCW, Kerry Von Erich would be embroiled in a feud with [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]] ([[AWA World Heavyweight Championship|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]]) over who would be the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion. Kerry was then the WCWA (World Class Wrestling Association (World Class' final used name before the USWA days) Heavyweight Champion.<ref name="wcwatitle"/> They would meet at an interpromotional event called [[SuperClash#SuperClash III|SuperClash III]] to settle the dispute. Prior to this match, Kerry accidentally cut his arm causing it to bleed. During the match, he also received a cut to the head. When he later had Lawler in a clawhold on the mat with Lawler's shoulders down, the referee saw the blood on Kerry's head, thought it was excessive, and stopped the match. The crowd thought Kerry won by submission but instead "due to excessive bleeding" the referee stopped the match and awarded the decision and the WCWA Championship to Jerry Lawler.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/awa/superclash.html#sc3|title=SuperClash III results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref> This would mark the end of Kerry's WCWA run.

===United States Wrestling Association (1989-1990)===
Kerry did continue to wrestle at the Dallas Sportatorium under the [[United States Wrestling Association|USWA]] banner, which acquired World Class in early-1989. He formed a tag team with [[Jeff Jarrett]], and won the Texas heavyweight title twice.<ref name="wcwatag"/><ref name="texastitle"/> In 1990, Kerry feuded violently with [[Matt Osborne|Matt Borne]], who turned heel during a ringside interview; during one match, the two battled outside the Sportatorium into the parking lot during a thunderstorm. Manager [[Percy Pringle]] also [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], and began feuding with Kerry. During the height of their angle, Kerry abruptly left the USWA/World Class and joined the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]], billed as ''The Texas Tornado'', leaving the Von Erich tradition to older brother [[Kevin Von Erich|Kevin]] (who was considered semi-active) and [[Chris Von Erich|Chris]]. Honorary Von Erich [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|"Gentleman" Chris Adams]] then became the Sportatorium's main headliner, feuding with Pringle, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]], and [[Jeannie Clark]]. World Class withdrew from the USWA soon thereafter, but without Kerry, manager Gary Hart, and lack of television and revenues, World Class ceased operations three months later.

===World Wrestling Federation (1990<U+2013>1992)===
In the summer of 1990, he signed a contract with [[Vince McMahon]]'s [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) and debuted on the [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event XXVII|July 28, 1990 edition]] of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] [[ring name|named]] The Texas Tornado, defeating [[Buddy Rose]], who coincidentally was older brother Kevin's opponent when he made his wrestling debut in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/snme/history/1985to1992/july281990|title=Saturday Night's Main Event results - July 28, 1990|date=1990-07-28|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref> At [[SummerSlam (1990)|SummerSlam]], Tornado substituted for the injured [[Edward Leslie|Brutus Beefcake]] and defeated [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] (Curt Hennig) to win the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1990/results/|title=SummerSlam 1990 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322432|title=Texas Tornado's first Intercontinental Championship reign|publisher=WWE| accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref> After he became Champion, Tornado defended the title for three months including a match against [[Tonga Fifita|Haku]] on the [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event XXVIII|October 13 edition]] of ''Saturday Night's Main Event''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/snme/history/1985to1992/oct131990|title=Saturday Night's Main Event results - October 13, 1990|date=1990-10-13|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref> before losing the title back to former champion Mr. Perfect in a rematch on the December 15 (taped November 19) edition of [[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|''Superstars'']].<ref name="superstars">{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/superstars.htm| title=WWF Superstars Results (1986-1997)|work=Angelfire|accessdate=2008-05-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080429091409/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/superstars.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-29}}</ref> Kerry lost this match, and the title to Perfect due to interference from [[Ted DiBiase|"Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase]].<ref name="superstars"/>

Fritz, Kevin, Dave, Kerry, Mike and Chris Von Erich were the members of the family that were inducted. Kevin received rings for his father, Fritz, as well as each of his brothers.

Murray.<ref>[http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/25456?c=search&first=kerry&last=adkisson Texas Marriages]</ref> They had two daughters, Hollie Brooke (born September 19, 1984) and [[Lacey Von Erich|Lacey]] (born July 17, 1986). The couple divorced on April 22, 1992.<ref>[http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/31992?c=search&first=kerry&last=adkisson Texas Divorces]</ref>

Kerry had a history of drug problems, and drugs may have been a factor in the motorcycle crash in 1986 that cost him his right foot. Kerry committed suicide by shooting himself with a magnum revolver in the chest, at his father's ranch in [[Denton, Texas]], on February 18, 1993. Kerry drove a Jeep over a steep embankment at the time he shot himself. It was only one day after being indicted on a drug charge.<ref name="PS55"/> Kerry was facing jail time for a pending prescription forgery charge. A memorial service for Kerry was held at the [[Dallas Sportatorium]] the day after his suicide, with both Chris Adams and [[Marc Lowrance]] delivering emotional speeches to the crowd. Two months later, a memorial wrestling card in his honor was held at the Sportatorium, which featured the last-ever match between the Freebirds and the Von Erichs. The funeral for Kerry Von Erich was held at the First Baptist Church in downtown Dallas. The Reverend [[W.A. Criswell]] officiated and reduced himself to tears as he described his "anger" over Kerry's death. His former wife, Cathy, attended with the couples' two daughters, Hollie and Lacey. Although already divorced and therefore not his widow, Cathy wore a black mourning suit complete with black hat and veil.  Others, including Fritz, Kevin, Adams, Lowrance, Bill Mercer, Bronko Lubich, David Manning, Gary Hart, and bodyguard Bill Colville attended.

When his father, Fritz Von Erich, died in 1997 he was cremated and his ashes interred in the same plot as Kerry. David Von Erich, Mike Von Erich, Chris Von Erich, and Natasha Adkisson (Natasha is the infant daughter of David Von Erich and his first wife Candy) are all buried in Grove Hill Memorial Park as well and are all buried next to each other. The grave with Kerry's body and Fritz' ashes is not immediately adjacent to the other members of the family, but is close by.

He was close friends with [[Brian Adias]] and [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]].
