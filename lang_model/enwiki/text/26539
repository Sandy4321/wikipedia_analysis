A hip injury kept him in a wheelchair during his freshman year at [[Thomas Kelly High School]].<ref name=rossi/>

Chico pursued a [[pre-medical]] degree at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana<U+2013>Champaign]], but after his sophomore year he transferred to the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Jackson |first=Brian |title=Making the City That Works Work; Daley Aide a Stickler for Detail |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=October 24, 1993 |page=1}}</ref> A political science major, he volunteered in the 11th [[Wards of the United States|Ward]].

Chico has been married twice; his first wife was Jeryl Minow, with whom he had three daughters. He is currently married to Sunny Pineda Chico, who has a son and daughter from a previous marriage.<ref name=rossi/><ref name=mendell/> A former [[U.S. Department of Education]] employee, Sunny runs a consulting firm that focuses on, among others, tutoring services and curriculum advice.<ref name=heinzmann/>

==Legal career==
Chico began working as an associate of the law firm [[Sidley Austin]] in 1987, and he also served as General Counsel to the Chicago Development Council, the city's largest real estate development association.<ref name=chiconunes.com/> He left the firm in 1991 to become the Deputy Chief of Staff for Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]],<ref name=rossi/> but he later returned as partner in 1995 and 1996, leading the firm's practice related to state and local government.

In 1996 he became a senior partner of [[Altheimer & Gray]]<ref name=chiconunes.com/> until it became insolvent and dissolved in 2003. Some partners blamed the bankruptcy on poor management by Chico, while an attorney who sat on two financial committees blamed an economic downturn.<ref name=rossi/> He also served as Special Counsel to Arnstein & Lehr in 2003 and 2004.<ref name=chiconunes.com/> In 2004, he, along with Planning Department colleague Marcus Nunes, formed the law firm Chico & Nunes,<ref name=rossi/> which lobbies for clients seeking government business.<ref name=heinzmann>{{cite news|title=Gery Chico made millions from law firm that lobbies City Hall |url=http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2010/12/gery-chico-made-millions-from-law-firm-that-lobbies-city-hall.html |last=Heinzmann |first=David |newspaper=Chicago Breaking News |date=December 21, 2010 |accessdate=February 5, 2011}}</ref>

==Mayoral Chief of Staff==
Chico was appointed in 1991 as a Deputy Chief of Staff for Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]].<ref name=chiconunes.com/> He coordinated efforts to drain freight tunnels that were flooded with water from the [[Chicago River]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Oclander |first=Jorge |title=Board President Chico's Duties Just Beginning |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=July 2, 1995 |page=11}}</ref> Chico was later promoted to Chief of Staff, a position he held from 1992 to 1995.<ref name=chiconunes.com/> As part of his duties, he oversaw the completion of the International Terminal of [[O'Hare International Airport]], preparations for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], and the construction of new schools.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oclander |first=Jorge |title=City School Chief On the Way Out; Daley Staff Chief To Head Board |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=June 1, 1995 |page=1}}</ref> Along with Budget Director [[Paul Vallas]], Chico helped add 1,000 officers to the police force and improved neighborhoods through a program called Neighborhoods Alive.<ref name=rossi/>

==Chicago Public Schools board==
[[File:CPS mural.jpg|thumb|right|Murals like these were preserved and restored during Chico's tenure at Chicago Public Schools.]]
In 1995, the Illinois state legislature passed the Chicago School Reform Act, which gave the Mayor of Chicago unprecedented new control over [[Chicago Public Schools]] (CPS).<ref>{{cite news |title=The Educator's New Clothes: Everybody Loves Arne Duncan. But Do His Reforms Work? |last=Blake |first=Matthew |date=May 30, 2009 |publisher= Understanding Government |url=http://understandinggov.org/2009/05/30/the-educators-new-clothes-everybody-loves-arne-duncan-but-do-his-reforms-work/ |accessdate=February 5, 2011}}</ref> Daley asked Chico to become the CEO, but Chico refused because he was resuming his law career. Chico instead recommended that Daley appoint colleague [[Paul Vallas]] as CEO, and Chico was named chairman of the School Reform Board of Trustees. City Hall insiders did not expect them to succeed, as Chico had many opponents from his time as the mayoral chief of staff and he had already suggested his intentions to succeed Mayor Daley. Vallas was also expected to eventually seek statewide office. However, during their administration test scores improved, the budget was balanced, and graduation rates rose. Then-President [[Bill Clinton]] hailed the school system as a national model, a decade after [[William Bennett]], then [[U.S. Secretary of Education]], had criticized it as the worst public school system in the nation.<ref name=neal>{{cite news |last=Neal |first=Steve |title=Chico needs a lesson on sharing spotlight |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=May 7, 1999 |page=7}}</ref>

Tensions between Chico and Vallas began in 1998 after Vallas revoked an insurance contract over complaints that subcontractors were receiving unfair treatment. Chico had strong ties to the insurance broker and disagreed with the decision. The tensions grew as a private poll conducted in 1999 indicated that the public identified Vallas with school reform more than Chico. Chico resented this, even though his part-time role of presiding over monthly board meetings was dwarfed by the CEO's full-time employment. While chairmen, Chico's judgemnt was questioned after he hired a former journalist for a senior position on the Board of Education who had previously taken money from a politician that he had covered.<ref name=neal/>

Chico was also partly responsible for efforts to preserve and restore hundreds of murals in the public schools, which had been commissioned by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during the [[Progressive Era|Progressive]] and [[New Deal]] eras. They had since been hidden under layers of dirt and paint.<ref>{{cite book |last=Becker |first=Heather |title=Art for the People: The Rediscovery and Preservation of Progressive- and WPA-Era Murals in the Chicago Public Schools, 1904<U+2013>1943 |publisher=Chronicle Books |location=San Francisco |year=2002 |isbn=0811835790 |pages=1, 20}}</ref> Under his administration, CPS appointed an Arts Education Task Force and a Bureau of Cultural Arts.<ref>Becker 2002, p. 110.</ref>

Many clients of Altheimer & Gray contracted with the school board, forcing Chico to abstain on hundreds of votes. The firm's clients received contracts that totaled $577&nbsp;million during Chico's tenure, but Chico claims that those clients had received contracts before he arrived and still did afterwards.<ref name=mendell/>

In 1997 Chico was named Outstanding School Board President by the Illinois State Board of Education for his reforms in education and fiscal policies.<ref>{{cite news |last=Talapian |first=Kathlyn |title=Gery Chico, potential mayoral candidate |date= November 4, 2010 |newspaper=The Wright Times |url=http://media.www.wrighttimes.net/media/storage/paper1129/news/2010/11/04/News/Gery-Chico.Potential.Mayoral.Candidate-3955016.shtml |accessdate=February 5, 2011}}</ref> While the schools saw a rise in test scores, they were criticized for becoming "test-prep mills". In 2001, a dip in test scores prompted Daley to consider appointing new management, and Chico resigned.<ref name=rossi/>

In 2004, Chico ran for the Democratic nomination to succeed retiring Republican U.S. Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (politician)|Peter Fitzgerald]].

His Senate committee preferences included education, transportation, and foreign relations. He also criticized the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] and the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], but supported [[gay marriage]],<ref name=mendell/> [[abortion rights]], [[stem cell research]], the [[death penalty]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Kapos |first=Shia |title=Some help with narrowing the choices |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=March 10, 2004 |page=1 }}</ref> and [[universal healthcare]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Beckless |first=Ferman Mentrell |title=Chico: Healthcare should be a fundamental right |newspaper=Chicago Defender |date=March 6, 2004 |volume=XCVIII |issue=214 |page=9}}</ref> Chico was the only candidate who supported gay marriage out of all seven Democrats and eight Republicans.<ref>{{cite news |last=Krol |first=Eric |title=Only one candidate backs gay marriage |newspaper=Daily Herald |date=February 15, 2004 |page=1}}</ref> Then-State Senator [[Barack Obama]] ultimately won the nomination over six other candidates including Chico, who won only five percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |last=Finke |first=Doug |newspaper=State Journal Register |title=Two emerge from pack of Senate candidates |location=Springfield, Illinois |date=March 17, 2004 |page=1}}</ref>

==City Colleges of Chicago board==
In March 2010, Mayor Daley appointed Chico to the board of trustees of the [[City Colleges of Chicago]] and recommended that the board elect Chico president.<ref name="chiconunes.com"/> Along with Chancellor Cheryl Hyman, Chico reformed the City Colleges budget by laying off 225 employees, removing unfilled jobs, and reducing executive spending to increase spending on technology and training for students. Furthermore, Chico and Hyman reduced taxation on property for two straight years, repealed the system's "open-door" admissions policy, and cancelled nursing programs.

==2011 campaign for Mayor of Chicago==
[[File:Gery Chico rally.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-election rally at [[Roberto Clemente High School]].]]
{{See also|Chicago mayoral election, 2011}}
On September 27, 2010, Chico announced that he would run for mayor of Chicago in 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gery Chico To Run For Mayor |newspaper=Progress Illinois |date=September 27, 2011 |url=http://www.progressillinois.com/news/content/2010/09/27/gery-chico-run-mayor |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}</ref> He was one of six candidates on the ballot. By January 31, 2011, Chico had raised $2.5&nbsp;million in campaign funds. 

Chico pledged to hire 2,000 police officers but did not offer specifics on how he would raise the funds.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chico says he'll hire more police officers |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=January 27, 2011 |page=10}}</ref> He opposed making the school board an elected body, and he favored extending the school day and school year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hispanic candidates disagree on public education in Chicago |publisher=Fox News Latino |url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2011/02/09/hispanic-candidates-disagree-public-education-chicago/ |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=February 10, 2011}}</ref> He became the favorite candidate of organized labor, picking up endorsements from unions that represented, among others, police officers, firefighters, laborers, painters, operating engineers, iron workers, roofers, and sheet metal workers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Spielmanand |first1=Fran |last2=Pallasch |first2=Abdon M. |title=More unions endorse Chico, bash Emanuel |date=February 8, 2011 |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/3704956-418/more-unions-endorse-chico-bash-emanuel.html |accessdate=February 9, 2011 |work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> If elected, Chico would have severed ties with his law firm, but he would not have prevented it from lobbying for clients seeking city contracts.

If no candidate had won a majority in the February 22 election, the top two candidates would have faced each other during an April&nbsp;5 runoff. [[Rahm Emanuel]] was considered to be the leading candidate before the election. Chico, who had 19% support according to a February&nbsp;10 poll, was considered "the rival with the best chance of forcing him into a runoff".<ref>{{cite news |last=Chase |first=John |title=Emanuel at 49%, Chico at 19% in Tribune/WGN poll |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=February 10, 2011 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/elections/ct-met-chicago-mayor-race-0211-20110210,0,4985218.story |accessdate=February 11, 2011}}</ref> During the election on February 22, Chico and Emanuel's other rivals could not gain enough votes to force a runoff election; Emanuel's 55% support dwarfed Chico's 24% support.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pallasch |first1=Abdon M. |last2=Spielman |first2=Fran |title=Rahm Emanuel wins Chicago mayor race |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=February 23, 2011 |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/elections/3958856-505/rahm-emanuel-wins-chicago-mayor-race.html |accessdate=April 12, 2011}}</ref> Chico won in 10 of Chicago's 50 [[Wards of the United States|wards]], while Emanuel won 40.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schulte |first=Sarah |title=Is Chicago past racial elections? |publisher=ABC 7 Chicago |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/politics&id=7976358 |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref> The campaign's communications director attributed the loss in part to Chico's focus on fundraising and resulting lack of time for media interviews.
