{{Chinese name|[[Cao (Chinese surname)|Cao]]}}
'''Cao Teng''' (<U+66F9><U+817E>) was a [[eunuch]] who served the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] in its later years. He served four Han emperors ([[Emperor Shun of Han|Shun]], [[Emperor Chong of Han|Chong]], [[Emperor Zhi of Han|Zhi]], and [[Emperor Huan of Han|Huan]]). Through his adopted son [[Cao Song]], he was the adoptive grandfather of [[Cao Cao]], a major player in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period of [[Chinese history]]. Upon the creation of [[Cao Wei]], he was posthumously named '''Emperor Gao of Wei''' (<U+9B4F><U+9AD8><U+5E1D>).

Cao Teng served as Attendant at the Yellow Gates (<U+5C0F><U+9EC3><U+9580>) in the court during the reign of [[Emperor An of Han|Emperor An]]. In 120 AD, when Shun was the Prince, the Empress Dowager Deng appointed Cao Teng to serve the Prince Shun because Cao Teng was honest, modest and prudent. Cao Teng gained the trust of the future Emperor Shun and became his personal friend. In 126 AD, after Prince Shun ascended to the throne, Cao Teng was promoted as Regular Attendant (<U+4E2D><U+5E38><U+4F8D>), the highest possible rank for a court eunuch.

After Emperor Shun died, Shun's infant son died after just one year on the throne. General [[Liang Ji]] promoted the seven-years-old Liu Zuan (<U+5218><U+7F35>) over the more popular Liu Suan (<U+5289><U+849C>) to be the emperor. Despite being a child, Liu Zuan showed signs of resenting Liang Ji's power, and was soon poisoned by the powerful general. The court was once again split in deciding the successor. One group, led by [[Li Gu]] (<U+674E><U+56FA>), wanted to promote Liu Suan as the emperor, while Liang Ji led another group that wanted the young Liu Zhi (<U+5218><U+5FD7>) to be enthroned. Cao Teng took Liang Ji's side and urged him to defy his critics, and soon the majority backed down.

After Liu Zhi, or Emperor Huan as he came to be known, ascended to the throne, Cao Teng was rewarded with enfeoffment as Marquis of Bi Village (<U+8CBB><U+4EAD><U+4FAF>) for his participation in the succession debate. He was later promoted to Grand Prolonger of Autumn (<U+5927><U+9577><U+79CB>), in charge of the household of the [[Empress Liang N<U+00FC>ying]], and served also as Coachman of the Changle Palace (<U+9577><U+6A02><U+5BAE><U+592A><U+50D5>) of the [[Empress Liang Na|Dowager Liang Na]].

Cao Teng stayed in the court for 30 years, having served four emperors, and was said to have never made big mistakes. The people he promoted were all very famous throughout the empire, such as [[Yu Fang]] (<U+865E><U+653E>), [[Bian Shao]] (<U+8FB9><U+97F6>), [[Zhao Dian]] (<U+8D75><U+5178>) and so on. Cao Teng was a broad-minded person. Once, a provincial governor [[Zhong Hao]] (<U+79CD><U+66A0>) found evidence that Cao Teng had received bribes and tried, unsuccessfully, to impeach Cao Teng. Despite this, Cao Teng often recommended Zhong Gao to higher positions. Cao Teng was remembered by his contemporaries for his personality and integrity. After Cao Teng died in the late 150s, his son Cao Song inherited his marquis title.
