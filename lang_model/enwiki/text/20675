The '''Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum''' ({{zh|c=<U+660E><U+5B5D><U+9675>|p=M<U+00ED>ng Xi<U+00E0>o L<U+00ED>ng}}) is the tomb of the [[Hongwu Emperor]], the founder of the [[Ming Dynasty]]. It lies at the southern foot of [[Purple Mountain]], located east of the historical centre of [[Nanjing]], [[China]]. Legend says that in order to prevent robbery of the tomb, 13 identical processions of funeral troops started from 13 [[city gates]] to obscure the real burying site.<ref name=oa>[[#oa|Asian Historical Architecture]]</ref>

The construction of the [[mausoleum]] began during the [[Hongwu Emperor]]'s life in 1381 and ended in 1405, during the reign of his son the [[Yongle Emperor]], with a huge expenditure of resources involving 100,000 labourers. The original wall of the mausoleum was more than 22.5 kilometres long. The mausoleum was built under heavy guard of 5,000 troops.

==Layout and monuments==
[[File:Stone Sifangcheng.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Shengong Shengde'' stele in the Sifangcheng pavilion]]

===Great golden gate and Square city===
'''Da Jin Men and Sifangcheng'''. One enters the site through the monumental Great Golden Gates (''Da Jin Men''), and is soon faced by a giant stone tortoise (''[[bixi (tortoise)|bixi]]''), which resides in the ''Sifangcheng'' ("Square city") pavilion. The tortoise supports a splendid carved stone [[Stela|stele]], crowned by intertwining [[chi (mythology)|hornless dragons]]. The  well-preserved stele is known as the "''Shengong Shengde'' Stele" (<U+795E><U+529F><U+5723><U+5FB7><U+7891>), i.e., literally, "The Stele of Godly Merit and Saintly Virtue". The inscription of the stele, extolling the merits and virtues of the  Hongwu Emperor [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuanzhang]] was written by his fourth son, the [[Yongle Emperor]]. The tortoise is 5.15 m long, 2.54 m wide and 2.8 m tall,<ref>[http://www.js.xinhuanet.com/xin_wen_zhong_xin/2009-06/10/content_16771522.htm <U+660E><U+4EE3><U+5E1D><U+9675><U+7816><U+6750><U+79D1><U+6280><U+542B><U+91CF><U+9AD8> <U+660E><U+5341><U+4E5D><U+5E1D><U+9675><U+56FE><U+7247><U+5C55><U+7B79><U+5907>] (High-tech bricks of Ming imperial mausolea: preparing for an exhibition of images of the 19 Ming imperial tombs) Xinhua, 2009-06-10. (Source for sizes)</ref>
the stele stands 8.78 m tall (including the tortoise)<ref name=nj/> and is one of the best-known examples of its genre. 

It is thought that originally the Yongle Emperor planned to install a much bigger stele here. The work on making it was started in the [[Yangshan Quarry]] (some 10&nbsp;km east of the mausoleum) in 1405, but the unfinished stele was abandoned in the quarry, as it was realized that it would not be possible to move it.<ref name=njmq>{{harvnb|Yang|Lu|2001|pp=616<U+2013>617}}</ref>

Unlike the [[:File:Mingdynastytombs3.jpg|similar pavilion]] at the [[Thirteen Ming Tombs]] near Beijing, Nanjing's  ''Sifangcheng'' does not have its roof anymore, as it was destroyed during the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. Recently, Chinese engineers have conducted research in regard to the possibility of restoring the roof.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.scientific.net/AMR.163-167.2618

===The Sacred Way===
The Sacred Way is a  1800-metre-long<ref name=nj>[http://www.nanjing.gov.cn/cyjl/jltj/200911/t20091101_282136.htm <U+660E><U+5B5D><U+9675><U+666F><U+533A>] (MIng Xiaoling Scenic Area); at the Nanjing city Government site. {{zh icon}}</ref>  winding [[Spirit way|Sacred Way]] (''Shendao'') starts near the Sifangcheng pavilion. It includes sections: the Elephant Road and the ''Wengzhong'' Road. The Elephant Road is lined by 12 pairs of 6 kinds ([[Chinese lion|lions]], ''[[xiezhi]]'', camels, elephants,
''[[qilin]]'', and horses), guarding the tomb. Beyond them is a column called ''[[huabiao]]'' in Chinese. One then continues along the Wengzhong Road. Four pairs of ministers and generals (or warrior guardian figures, ''wengzhong'') of stone been standing there for centuries to accompany His beneath.

===Lingxing Gate===
The Lingxing Gate, a ''[[pailou]]'' at the end of the Wengzhong Road was destroyed long ago, but rebuilt in 2006.<ref>[[:File:Lingxing Gate - plaque - P1060493.JPG|Information plaque at the Lingxing Gate]]</ref>

===The central area===
One enters the central area of the mausoleum complex through the ''Wen Wu Fang Men'' (The Gate of the Civil and the Military). 
On an inscribed stone tablet outside of the gate is an official notification of the local government in the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644<U+2013>1911) is ordered to protect the tomb. Inside the gate, there the Tablet Hall (''Bei Dian'')  in which 5 steles stand. The one in the middle, also mounted on a [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]], is inscribed with 4 Chinese characters, "<U+6CBB><U+9686><U+5510><U+5B8B>", which were written by the Qing Dynasty's [[Kangxi Emperor]] on his third inspection tour of the South in 1699. The text is interpreted as alluding to the greatness of the Ming Dynasty founder Zhu Yuanzhang, matching (or surpassing) that of the founders of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] Dynasties of old.<ref name=pd2003>[http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/9409/871387.html <U+660E><U+5B5D><U+9675><U+4E24><U+5927><U+201C><U+7891><U+77F3><U+4E4B><U+8C1C><U+201D><U+88AB><U+7834><U+89E3>] (Solving the two great riddles of the Ming Xiaoling's stone tablets).

The inscription is interpreted as "His reign was as glorious as that of the Tang and Song"]</ref>

Behind the pavilion, there used to be other annexes; however most of them have collapsed into relics from which the original splendor can still be traced. The emperor and his queen were buried in a clay [[tumulus]], 400 metres in diameter, known as the Lone Dragon Hill (''Du Long Fu''). A stone wall with a terrace on top, known as ''Ming Lou'' (Ming Mansion) or the Soul Tower is half-embedded into the front face of the tumulus. On a stone wall surrounding the vault, 7 Chinese characters were inscribed, identifying the mausoleum of Emperor Ming Taizu (respected title of Emperor [[Zhu Yuanzhang]]). 

The mountain to the south of the tomb, known as Meihua Shan ("Plum Flower Mountain"),  is the mausoleum of [[Sun Quan]], King of the [[Kingdom of Wu]] in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (220-265). The existence of this tomb is the reason why the Sacred Way is not straight.

==Later history==
The mausoleum complex suffered damage during the mid-19th century [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping War]], but was restored during the [[Tongzhi Emperor|Tongzhi]] era thereafter.

Along with the [[Ming Dynasty Tombs]] north of [[Beijing]], the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum of Nanjing was inscribed by [[UNESCO]] as part of the [[World Heritage Sites]] "[[Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties]]".

==The mystery of the third tortoise==
[[File:Hong Lou Park - Blank stele bixi - P1060592.JPG|thumb|The unfinished ''bixi'' with a blank stele, re-installed in the Red Chamber Culture Park]]
In 1999, another, unfinished, [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]] and an unfinished  stele lying on the ground were discovered in a ravine just over 100 m to the southeast from the Sifangcheng Pavilion, and even closer to [[Soong May-ling|Madame Chiang Kai-Shek]]'s former villa (known as Meiling Gong). The tortoise,  larger than those under the Shengde stele and the Kangxi Emperor's steles, and the matching blank stele were recognized by experts as being products of the early [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]], but the reasons for their manufacture and abandonment became subjects for speculation among historians. A number of possible explanations - from faulty material to the overthrow of the [[Jianwen Emperor]] by the [[Yongle Emperor]] in 1402 - have been advanced. 

In the meantime, the tortoise and the blank stele (<U+65E0><U+5B57><U+7891>)  have been moved to the Red Chamber Culture Park (<U+7EA2><U+697C><U+827A><U+6587><U+82D1>, Honglou Yiwen Yuan), located just east of the Ming Xiaoling complex.<ref name=nj/><ref name=pd2003/> The park (which otherwise is a modern [[Dream of the Red Chamber|Dream-of-the-Red-Chamber]]-themed landscape and sculpture park) can be visited on the same ticket with the Ming Xiaoling proper.
