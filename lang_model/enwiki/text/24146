The''' red flour beetle''' is a [[Tenebrionidae|tenebrionid]] beetle. It is a worldwide stored product pest.

Red flour beetles attack stored [[grain]] products (flour, cereals, pasta, biscuits, beans, nuts, etc.) causing loss and damage. They may cause an [[allergic response]]  but are not known to spread disease and cause no damage to structures or furniture. 

The red flour beetle is of [[Indo-Australia]]n origin and less able to survive outdoors than the closely related species ''[[Tribolium confusum]]''. It has, as a consequence, a more southern distribution, though both species are worldwide in heated premises. The adults are long-lived and may live for more than three years.
