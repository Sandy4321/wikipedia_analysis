The '''Nyon Conference''' was held between European nations at [[Nyon]], [[Switzerland]], in September 1937. It was set against the backdrop of a wider plan of [[non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War]]. It dealt with international piracy in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in relation to the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]], and was led by the [[United Kingdom]] and [[French Third Republic|France]].  [[Bulgaria]], [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], [[Romania]], [[Turkey]], the [[USSR]] and [[Yugoslavia]] also attended.

The first agreement, signed on 14 September, dealt with plans to attack aggressive [[submarine]]s, which would be counter-attacked by naval vessels. Naval patrols were established &ndash; Britain and France would patrol most of the western Mediterranean, and parts of the east; the other signatories would patrol their own waters. Italy would be allowed to join the agreement and patrol the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] if wished. It was followed three days later with a second agreement, which dealt with surface ships and applied similar provisions. Italy and Germany did not attend, although Italy did take up naval patrols in November. Efforts to prevent attacks by submarines were successful, in marked contrast to the [[Non-Intervention Committee]] and the [[League of Nations]].

==Context and organisation==
The [[Non-Intervention Committee]], set up in 1936, had attempted to restrict the flow of weapons to the parties of the Spanish Civil War.<ref name="review103">''The English Historical Review'' (1975). p. 103.</ref> Under a committee plan, neutral observers were posted to Spanish ports and borders.<ref name="thomas394">Thomas (1961). p. 394.</ref> Zones of patrol were assigned to Britain, France, Germany and Italy.<ref name="thomas395">Thomas (1961). p. 395.</ref> Following attacks on the German cruiser ''[[German cruiser Leipzig|Leipzig]]'' on 15 and 18 June, Germany and Italy withdrew from the patrols.<ref>Thomas (1961). p. 457.</ref><ref>''Bulletin of International News'' (August 1937). pp. 4&ndash;5.</ref> Britain and France offered to replace Germany and Italy in patrols of their sections, but the latter powers believed these patrols would be too partial.<ref name="bulletin7">''Bulletin of International News'' (August 1937). p. 7.</ref> The [[British Admiralty]] believed that a significant control effort was the best solution, of four which were put forward, in response to attacks on British shipping;<ref name="review105">''The English Historical Review'' (1975). p. 105.</ref> previous control measures had been widely evaded.<ref name="review103"/> This would be the basis for a Mediterranean meeting, suggested by French Foreign Minister [[Yvon Delbos]].<ref name="review105"/> The Italian submarine ''Iride'' attacked the British destroyer ''Havock'', unsuccessfully, strengthening Eden's stance towards Italy.<ref>''The International History Review'' (1993). p. 12.</ref>

A conference was arranged for all parties with a Mediterranean coastline, along with Germany and Italy, by the British on September 5 or 6.<ref name="review106">''The English Historical Review'' (1975). p. 106.</ref><ref name="thomas475">Thomas (1961). p. 475.</ref> France wanted Russia and the Republican Spain to be invited, but the United Kingdom would grant only the former. Hence, no Spanish representative was invited.<ref name="review106"/> Direct intervention on the Spanish question was avoided in France, with the new prime minister, [[Camille Chautemps]], against.<ref>''The International History Review'' (1993). p. 13.</ref> It was held at [[Nyon]], Switzerland &ndash; although [[Geneva]] would have been more usual, it was avoided because it was associated in Italy with the actions of the [[League of Nations]] over the [[Abyssinian Crisis]].<ref name="thomas475"/> The Russian government formally accused the Italians of sinking two Russian vessels, the ''Tuniyaev'' and the ''Blageav''. This was perhaps an attempt by Russia to push Italy and Germany away from the conference.<ref name="thomas476">Thomas (1961). p. 476.</ref> There were appeals by Italy and Germany that the Non-Intervention Committee handle the piracy and other issues the conference was to discuss, not a conference like Nyon. Britain and France rejected this suggestion, and continued to prepare for the conference.<ref name="thomas476"/> The British believed they could convince Italy to abandon Germany, as was one of the aims of [[appeasement]] in general. Italy and Germany were not present on September 10, at the start of the conference.<ref>Thomas (1961). pp. 475&ndash;476.</ref>

==Provisions==
[[File:Map of the Nyon Conference.svg|thumb|right|500px|Map of the Mediterranean, showing some of the features referred to at the conference.]] In drawing up plans for the conference, British and French naval staffs rejected the idea of a [[Convoy|convoy system]].The British focussed on efforts to curb submarine activity, while the French considered surface vessels and aircraft just as important.<ref name="review106"/> Air and surface attacks had been open, whereas submarine attacks were covert &ndash; focussing on submarines would help avoid confrontation. Groups of ships made up from different nations was unacceptable to the French, who were unhappy at the prospect of French ships under foreign command.<ref name="review106"/>  On September 8, plans were discussed in cabinet, including the setting up of eight groups of three [[destroyer]]s for the western Mediterranean. Preliminary talks with the French were held on 9 September.<ref name="review107">''The English Historical Review'' (1975). p. 107.</ref> The Conference began on the 10th. Proceedings took two forms: discussions between the British and French, and formal situations. The participation of the Russian navy in the Mediterranean was disputed by the lesser nations.<ref name="review107"/> Britain and France would take control of Aegean patrols, rather than Russia. This was, perhaps surprisingly, accepted by Russia.<ref name="review108">''The English Historical Review'' (1975). p. 108.</ref>

It ended on September 14 with the signing of the "Mediterranean Agreement". Signatories to the agreement were the countries of Bulgaria, Egypt, France, Greece, Romania, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the USSR and Yugoslavia.<ref name="bulletin12">''Bulletin of International News'' (September 1937). p. 12.</ref> The agreement noted attacks on neutral shipping by submarines. This was in contravention of the [[London Naval Treaty]] (signed in 1930) and the Submarine Protocol, part of the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] (signed in 1936).<ref name="bulletin12"/>

It clauses provided for any submarine that attacked neutral shipping to be confronted, and if possible sunk. This would also be the case if the submarine was in the vicinity of a recent attack and there were suitable grounds to believe it was responsible.<ref name="bulletin12"/> It was decided that French and British fleets patrol the areas of sea west of Malta, and attack any suspicious submarines.<ref name="thomas476"/> The division of patrols between Britain and France would be decided by their governments. They would patrol both the [[high seas]] and territorial waters of signatory countries.<ref name="bulletin12"/> The possibility of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] coming under Italian patrols was agreed.<ref name="review108"/> In the Eastern Mediterranean, British and French ships would patrol up to the [[Dardenelles]], but not in the [[Adriatic Sea]].<ref name="bulletin12"/> In this area, signatory countries would patrol their own territorial waters, and would provide any reasonable assistance to the French and British patrols. The revision of these provisions, including the way the area had been divided into zones, would be allowed.<ref name="bulletin12"/> Submarine activity would be banned, subject to two exemptions: submarines on the surface, accompanied by a [[surface ship]]; and activity in certain areas. Each of the governments would only allow foreign submarines into each of their territorial waters in extreme situations, such as immediate distress. Merchant shipping would also be advised to stick to particular [[shipping route]]s.<ref name="bulletin12"/> The agreement also repeated the suggestion Italy join in the proposal.<ref name="bulletin13">''Bulletin of International News'' (September 1937). p. 13.</ref> Delbos mentioned that similar proposals about surface craft would be prepared. The provisions of the agreement would come into force on 20 September.<ref name="review108"/> The British and French knew that Italian "pirate" submarine operations had already been paused,<ref name="review107"/> but actions to enforce the conference started at midnight on 19/20 September.<ref name="review108"/> The French and British camps moved to Geneva.<ref name="review109">''The English Historical Review'' (1975). p. 109.</ref> The parties to the agreement were happy; ''[[The Times]]'' likened them to [[cricket]]ers, 'reviewing their innings, over by over'.<ref name="review108"/>

A second agreement was signed into force on 17 September 1937.<ref name="thomas477">Thomas (1961). pp. 476&ndash;477.</ref><ref name="review109"/> It was signed in Geneva, and official versions were made in French and English.<ref>Schindler, Toman (1988). p. 890.</ref> It made the rules governing submarine warfare also applicable to surface vessels.<ref name="thomas477"/> Several proposals were not implemented. The British wanted the Spanish parties to be able to verify flags, thereby preventing innocent British shipping being attacked if Republican ships continued to use the British flag as a means of escape. This would have benefited the Nationalists, and the French made sure it was dropped.<ref name="review109"/> A suggestion to fire at any attacking aircraft was easily passed. Another, on surface ships (which stated no attack had yet been proven, incorrectly) was eventually hardened on request of the French, so text stating aggressors would be attacked was added. A Russian proposal strengthening the agreement was made.<ref name="review109"/> Greece and Turkey, keen not to be forced to fire on a German or Italian warship, wished ships with a clear identifying mark to be excluded, this was impractical, but an amendment was made to this effect, covering only ships in their own territorial waters.<ref name="review109"/>

==Aftermath==
Italy was very discontented at the agreement, whereas [[Maxim Litvinov]], the Russian representative, was pleased. Italy requested that it be included in the plans, in what it called 'parity of duties'. However, on the 15th, [[Mussolini]]'s government sent two submarines to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s [[National Faction (Spanish Civil War)|National Faction]].<ref name="thomas476"/> The agreement also allowed for greater military resources to be deployed to the Mediterranean as required. Litvinov, in particular, stressed Russia's "indisputable right" to commit naval forces to the Mediterranean (something Germany and Italy had opposed in meetings of the Non-Intervention Committee). He also said he regretted that Spanish merchant shipping had been left out &ndash; on the basis this would have been intervention.<ref name="bulletin13"/> [[Anthony Eden]] noted the barbarous nature of submarine attacks, that attacks on submarines would be restricted to suitably extreme circumstances, and that the two parties in the war would still not be able to engage neutral vessels.<ref name="bulletin13"/> British press was in favour, although ''The Times'' and ''[[The_Guardian#Spanish_Civil_War|The Guardian]]'' expressed some concerns. French public opinion was strongly in favour of the outcome of the conference.<ref>''The English Historical Review'' (1975). p. 109&ndash;110.</ref> The German mood was restrained; in Spain, the Republicans &ndash; on the verge of disaster &ndash; were largely in favour, the Nationalists strongly against. The Nationalists made several complaints, none of which were accepted.<ref name="review110">''The English Historical Review'' (1975). p. 110.</ref>

On 18 September, the Italian government was provided with the text of the agreement, and asked for some interpretation of 'parity'. Improved [[Italy-United Kingdom relations|Anglo-British relations]] were desired by the British government, particularly [[Neville Chamberlain]].<ref name="thomas477"/> This feeling would lead to the [[Anglo-Italian Agreements of 1938]]. An invitation was made to Italy to patrol the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], but this met with defiance. Italy demanded 'absolute parity' with Britain and France, meaning the same right of patrol in the Mediterranean.<ref name="review110"/><ref name="bulletin14">''Bulletin of International News'' (September 1937). p. 14.</ref> Russia refused to use routes patrolled by the Italians; the Turks, Greeks and Yugo-Slavs refused to let the Italians use their ports.<ref name="review110"/> A compromise was signed on the 29th, and Italian patrols started on 10 November.<ref name="review111">''The English Historical Review'' (1975). p. 111.</ref> The patrols were a strain on the British Navy, and the provisions were relaxed with French agreement, effective from January. However, submarine activity resumed and the patrol was brought up to full strength almost immediately.<ref>''The English Historical Review'' (1975). pp. 111&ndash;112.</ref> On the whole, submarine activity during this period did not amount to much; patrols were again relaxed in May, and the agreement suspended in August. The success of the conference was in marked contrast to the failure of the Non-Intervention Committee.<ref>''The English Historical Review'' (1975). p. 112.</ref>

Italian historians tend to downplay the importance of the Nyon Conference (often seeing it as a mere extension of the Non-Intervention Committee). British historians, however, have tended to see the Nyon Conference as an important stand against aggression, but have had reservations.<ref name="intreview3">''The International History Review'' (1993). p. 3.</ref> [[Christopher Seton-Watson]] describes it as a 'diplomatic victory',<ref name="intreview3"/> Jill Edwards points out that the Italian nonchalance means it failed to achieve a change in Italian policy.<ref name="intreview4">''The International History Review'' (1993). p. 4.</ref> It would also provide a further division between [[Anthony Eden]] as foreign minister and [[Neville Chamberlain]] as prime minister.<ref name="intreview4"/>
