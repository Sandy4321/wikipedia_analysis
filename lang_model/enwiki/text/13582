The '''Muhammad al-Durrah incident''' took place in the [[Gaza Strip]] on September 30, 2000, on the second day of the [[Second Intifada]], amid widespread rioting throughout the [[Palestinian territories]]. Jamal al-Durrah and his 12-year-old son, Muhammad, were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma, a Palestinian cameraman freelancing for [[France 2]], as they sought cover behind a concrete cylinder after being caught in crossfire between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian security forces. The footage, which lasts just over a minute, shows the pair holding onto each other, the boy crying and the father waving, then a burst of gunfire and dust, after which the boy is seen slumped across his father's legs.<ref name=tape1>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/french-court-examines-footage-of-mohammad-al-dura-s-death-1.233240 ''Haaretz'', May 16, 2007].

Fifty-nine seconds of the footage were initially broadcast in France with a voiceover from [[Charles Enderlin]], France&nbsp;2's bureau chief in Israel, who did not witness the incident himself but got all information by phone from the cameraman, telling viewers that the al-Durrahs had been the "target of fire from the Israeli positions," and that the boy had died.<ref name=Moutet>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/284xawsb.asp?pg=1 Moutet 2008]. Enderlin's report said: "Here, Jamal and his son Mohamed are the target of fire from the Israeli positions ... Another burst of fire. Mohamed is dead and his father seriously wounded."</ref> After an emotional public funeral, Muhammad was hailed throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds as a [[shahid|martyr]].

The [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) accepted responsibility at first<ref name=Seaman2008/> and Israel initially apologized for the boy's death but issued a retraction when an investigation indicated the IDF probably did not shoot the al-Durrahs and the boy was most likely killed by Palestinian fire.<ref>Avi Issacharoff.

France&nbsp;2's news editor said in 2005 that no one could say for sure who fired the shots, but other commentators, including the director of the Israeli government press office, went further, saying the scene had been staged by Palestinian protesters. [[Philippe Karsenty]], a French media commentator, was sued for libel by France&nbsp;2 for suggesting this; a ruling against him was overturned by the Paris Court of Appeal in May 2008 who agreed that some scenes did not seem genuine and that he had presented a "coherent mass of evidence". The court also found that the Palestinian cameraman for France 2 and the network's main witness was not "perfectly credible."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121183757337520921.html | title=Al-Durra Case Revisited | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=May 27, 2008 | accessdate=August 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/court-backs-claim-that-al-dura-killing-was-staged-1.246313 | title=Court backs claim that al-Dura killing was staged | publisher=Haaretz | accessdate=August 12, 2012}}</ref>  France&nbsp;2 has appealed the decision.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/in-the-footsteps-of-the-al-dura-controversy-1.232296 Schwartz 2007]: "In the last picture Mohammed al-Dura is seen lifting his head".

The footage of the father and son acquired what one writer called the power of a battle flag. For many Palestinians, it confirmed their view of Israel's brutality toward them, while for sections of the Israeli and Jewish communities the allegations were a modern [[Blood libel against Jews|blood libel]], the ancient antisemitic association of Jews with child sacrifice.<ref name="Who Shot Mohammed al-Dura?">{{cite web | url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/06/who-shot-mohammed-al-dura/302735/ | title=Who Shot Mohammed al-Dura? | publisher=The Atlantic | date=June 2003 | accessdate=August 26, 2012 | author=Fallow, James}}</ref>  The scene was evoked in other deaths.

Jamal (born c. 1966) lived with his wife Amal and their seven children in the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UNRWA]]-run [[Bureij (camp)|Bureij]] refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Jamal was a carpenter and house painter who had worked for Moshe Tamam, an Israeli contractor, for 20 years. Israeli writer Helen Schary Motro came to know him when she had employed him to help build her house. She wrote in 2000 of his years of rising at 3:30&nbsp;am to catch the bus to the border crossing at four, then a second bus out of Gaza so he could be at work by six. The border was closed on the day of the incident because of the rioting, which is why Jamal was not at work.<ref name=ScharyMotro>[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2000/10/07/jamal/ Schary Motro 2000].</ref> Muhammad (born 1988) was in fifth grade, but his school was closed that day because of the protests.<ref name=Orme1/> His mother said he had been watching the rioting on television and asked if he could join in.<ref name=Goldenberg/> Father and son decided instead to go to a car auction, according to an interview Jamal gave Abu Rahma in hospital the day after the shooting.<ref>Abu Rahma said in an affidavit sworn in October 2000 that he was the first journalist to interview the father after the shooting, an interview that was broadcast; see [http://web.archive.org/web/20080507120225/http://www.pchrgaza.ps/special/tv2.htm Abu Rahma 2000].</ref>

==Media figures==
===Charles Enderlin===
[[Charles Enderlin]] was born in 1945 in Paris. He moved to Jerusalem in 1968 where, Jewish himself, he became an Israeli national. He began in journalism in 1971, and after studying film and television he started working for France&nbsp;2 in 1981, becoming their bureau chief in Israel in 1990. He is the author of several books about the Middle East, and is highly respected within the French establishment. He is married to Danielle Kriegel, the daughter of historian [[:fr:Annie Kriegel|Annie Kriegel]], and cousin of philosopher [[:fr:Blandine Kriegel|Blandine Kriegel]], a former aide to President [[Jacques Chirac]].<ref name=Moutet/> During a 2006 libel action he brought against Philippe Karsenty, who alleges the incident was staged by protesters (see [[#2006: Enderlin-France 2 v. Karsenty|below]]), Enderlin submitted a letter from Chirac, who wrote in flattering terms of his integrity.<ref name=Chiracletter>[http://www.m-r.fr/download/jacques_chirac.pdf Letter from Jacques Chirac], February 2004.</ref> In August 2009 he was awarded France's highest decoration, the [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]].<ref>[http://info.france2.fr/medias/Charles-Enderlin-d%C3%A9cor%C3%A9-de-la-L%C3%A9gion-d%27honneur-56553145.html France&nbsp;2, August 12, 2009].</ref>

Journalist Anne-Elisabeth Moutet writes that Enderlin's coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is regularly criticized in Israel. He not only produced a documentary series on the [[Oslo Accords]] and the 2000 Camp David talks, but arranged for parties to the peace talks to hold discussions at the France&nbsp;2 bureau as neutral ground.<ref name=Moutet/> The criticism reached the point in 2008 that the [[Shurat HaDin|Israel Law Center]] unsuccessfully asked a court to revoke his Israeli press credentials.<ref>[http://jta.org/news/article/2008/05/12/108513/alduraenderlin JTA May 12, 2008]; [http://www.ynet.co.il/english/Ext/Comp/ArticleLayout/CdaArticlePrintPreview/1,2506,L-3562706,00.html Sofer 2008].</ref> Like Talal Abu Rahma, Enderlin has expressed astonishment at the allegation that the shooting was faked.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FePRL2WSmo Schapira 2009], 2/5, interview with Enderlin begins at 6:18&nbsp;minutes, ''YouTube''.</ref>

===Talal Abu Rahma===
Talal Hassan Abu Rahma, who lived in Gaza, had worked as a freelance cameraman for France&nbsp;2 since 1988. He ran his own press office, the National News Center in Gaza, and contributed to CNN through the Al-Wataneya Press Office.<ref name=affidavit/> He studied business administration in the U.S., and was a board member of the Palestinian Journalists' Association. He won a number of awards for his coverage of the al-Durrah story, including the [[Rory Peck Award]] in 2001,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080317162040/http://www.rorypecktrust.org/Awards01/talal.htm Rory Peck Awards 2001]; Gutman 2005, p.&nbsp;71.</ref> though Israeli military officials stopped him from traveling to London to receive the award for security reasons.<ref>Agence France-Presse, October 16, 2001.</ref> France&nbsp;2 correspondent, G<U+00E9>rard Grizbec, wrote in 2008 that Abu Rahma had never been a member of a Palestinian political group, had twice been arrested by Palestinian police for filming images that did not meet the approval of [[Yasser Arafat]], and had never been accused of security breaches by Israel.<ref>[http://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.lemeilleurdesmondes.org/A_chaud_Gerard-GRIZBEC-Affaire-al-Dura-Charles-Enderlin-Arlette-Chabot-Taguieff-Palestine.htm&ei=ukhMS6uNFY_iNdmioe8M&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBAQ7gEwAQ&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dg%25C3%25A9rard%2Bgrizbec%2Bdes%2Bmondes%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DG%26num%3D100 Grizbec 2008].</ref> [[Daniel Seaman]], director of the Israeli government press office, accused Abu Rahma on September 23, 2007 of the "systematic staging of action scenes," with reference to the al-Durrah footage,<ref name=Kalman>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/10/04/MNENSJ5ME.DTL Kalman 2007].</ref> in a letter France&nbsp;2 said was full of slander and half-truths.<ref name=Schwartz1/> "I'm a professional journalist," Abu Rahma said in 2001.

Diagonally across from the IDF position, on the upper left quadrant, was a small building housing a Palestinian police post under the command of Brigadier-General Osama al-Ali, a member of the [[Palestine National Council]].<ref name=Schemla>[http://web.archive.org/web/20021019090628/http://www.proche-orient.info/xjournal_pol_int.php3?id_article=5225 Schemla 2002].</ref> In front of it was a sidewalk along which ran a concrete wall. This was the wall Jamal and Muhammad crouched against. The upper right and lower left of the crossroads consisted of vacant land. According to several commentators<U+2014>such as James Fallows in ''The Atlantic'' in 2003, and a diagram prepared in 2008 by a French ballistics expert (above right)<U+2014>the lower left quadrant contained a circular dirt [[berm]] known locally as the "pita," because it was shaped like [[pita]] bread.

===News organizations and protesters===
Abu Rahma said that Palestinian protesters had gathered from around seven in the morning on September 30, throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails, and the IDF had returned rubber bullets and tear gas.<ref name=Schapira2002b/> Several cameramen were there, including from Reuters and the Associated Press, both of whom captured moments showing the al-Durrahs,<ref>[http://www.seconddraft.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=455:reuters-cameraman&catid=61:aldurah-footage-selections&Itemid=192 180&nbsp;seconds filmed by a Reuters cameraman crouching behind the al-Durrahs], ''Seconddraft.com''; [http://www.seconddraft.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=443:ap-cameraman&catid=61:aldurah-footage-selections&Itemid=192 Eight&nbsp;seconds of the same scene], filmed by an Associated Press cameraman, ''Seconddraft.com''.</ref> but the crucial minute of footage was captured only by Abu Rahma.

James Fallows writes that the [[Dailies|rushes]] (raw footage) from these cameramen show scenes involving several hundred protesters. Groups of young men are seen walking around, joking, sitting down, and smoking. Other scenes show them yelling and throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails. Some run around waving the Palestinian flag and try to pull down an Israeli flag. Several had pistols and rifles, as did the Palestinian policemen, and shots occasionally ring out. In some scenes protesters duck for cover, while others continue talking and smoking just feet away. One protester is seen falling and clutching his leg as if shot; an ambulance appears immediately to pick him up. Fallows writes that one camera caught a man being loaded into an ambulance, while footage from a different camera shows the same man jumping out of the ambulance a few minutes later. Several scenes show smoke coming from [[M16 rifle|M16]]s pointed through the slits of the IDF outpost. According to Israeli spokesmen, the soldiers were under orders to fire only if they were fired at, and not in response to rocks or other objects being thrown at them. There is no obvious link between any of the scenes, which according to Fallows gain narrative coherence only when packaged together for a news report.<ref name=Fallows>[http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/06/who-shot-mohammed-al-dura/2735/ Fallows 2003].</ref>

Several commentators agree there was at least some play acting that day. [[Denis Jeambar]], editor of ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', and [[:fr:Daniel Leconte|Daniel Leconte]], a former France&nbsp;2 correspondent, who were invited by France&nbsp;2 to view the rushes in 2004, said that a network official told them, "You know it's always like that."<ref name=Cahen/> Enderlin responded that just because scenes are played out for the camera does not mean they are not also real.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp8CnS2mEw8&feature=related Schapira 2009], 2/5, 2:27&nbsp;minutes.</ref>

==Report of attack==
After leaving the auction Jamal and Muhammad took a cab home. They arrived at the Netzarim junction around noon, according to ''Time'' magazine,<ref name=Rees>[http://www.time.com/time/pacific/magazine/20001225/poy_mohammed.html Rees 2000].</ref> though that timing has been disputed. Abu Rahma says the "intensive shooting" began around noon, and his attention was drawn at around that time to Jamal and Muhammad by Shams Oudeh, a Reuters cameraman who briefly took shelter with them behind the concrete drum.<ref name="affidavit"/> Fallows writes that Jamal and Muhammad first appear on the footage around 3&nbsp;pm (GMT+3), and Enderlin's report said the shooting took place at 3&nbsp;pm. The discrepancies have not been resolved; see [[#Confusion about timeline|below]].

When he saw the demonstrators, the cab driver reportedly refused to go any further, or was stopped by a policeman.<ref name=Orme1>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505EEDD123DF931A35753C1A9669C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print Orme, October 2, 2000].</ref> As Jamal and Muhammad were about to cross the junction on foot, Palestinian gunmen started shooting at the Israeli soldiers, and the Israelis returned fire.<ref name=Rees/> They waited until it had stopped, then crossed the road. The shooting started again, and Jamal, Muhammad, and Oudeh, the Reuters cameraman, crouched against the concrete wall in the upper left/south east quadrant of the crossroads, diagonally across from the Israeli outpost. They used a three-foot-tall (0.91 m) concrete drum that was lying against the wall as cover.<ref name=affidavit/> A large paving stone sat on top of the drum, which offered further protection.<ref name=Fallows/> The Reuters cameraman later moved away, and Jamal and Muhammad were left there alone.

Abu Rahma was the only cameraman to record the incident. He swore in an affidavit on October 3, 2000, that he had filmed 27&nbsp;minutes of the incident which he said had lasted 45&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=affidavit>In his [http://web.archive.org/web/20080507120225/http://www.pchrgaza.ps/special/tv2.htm affidavit], Abu Rahma said: ""Shooting started first from different sources, Israeli and Palestinian. It lasted for not more than 5 minutes. Then, it was quite clear for me that shooting was towards the child Mohammed and his father from the opposite direction to them. Intensive and intermittent shooting was directed at the two and the two outposts of the Palestinian National Security Forces. The Palestinian outposts were not a source of shooting, as shooting from inside these outposts had stopped after the first five minutes, and the child and his father were not injured then. Injuring and killing took place during the following 45 minutes."</ref> Around 64&nbsp;seconds of his footage is focused on Jamal and Muhammad. The tape was edited for broadcast down to fifty-nine&nbsp;seconds of the scene with the al-Durrahs; Enderlin then added a voiceover. The footage shows Jamal and Muhammad crouching behind the cylinder, the child screaming and the father shielding him. Jamal is seen waving toward the Israeli position, and appears to shout something in the direction of the cameraman. There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus. When the gunfire subsides, the footage shows Jamal sitting upright, appearing to have been injured, and Muhammad lying over his legs.<ref name=tape1/>

Ambulances were called but were delayed by the shooting. Bassam al-Bilbeisi, the driver of the first ambulance to arrive, was reported to have been shot and killed, as was a Palestinian jeep driver.<ref name=France2vKarsenty>[http://www.theaugeanstables.com/al-durah-affair-the-dossier/courts-decision-in-the-karsenty-case/ Enderlin, France&nbsp;2 v.

(see [[#Allegations about father's injuries|below]]).

===Cameraman's account===
Enderlin based his allegation that the IDF had shot the boy on the report of the cameraman, Abu Rahma.<ref name=EnderlinFigaro>[http://www.shalomarchav.be/imprimer.php3?id_article=978 Enderlin 2005].</ref> ''The Guardian'' quoted Abu Rahma saying of the IDF: "They were aiming at the boy, and that is what surprised me, yes, because they were shooting at him, not only one time, but many times."<ref name=Goldenberg>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/oct/03/israel6 Goldenberg, October 3, 2000].</ref> Abu Rahma said shooting was also coming from the Palestinian National Security Forces outpost south of the junction, behind the spot where Jamal and Muhammad were crouching, but he said they were not shooting when Muhammad was hit. The Israeli fire was being directed at this Palestinian outpost, he said. There was another Palestinian outpost 30 meters away. He said his attention was drawn to the child by Shams Oudeh, the Reuters photographer who for a time crouched beside Jamal and Muhammad behind the cylinder.<ref name=affidavit/> Abu Rahma told National Public Radio on October 1, 2000:

<blockquote> ... I saw the boy getting injured in his leg, and the father asking for help. Then I saw him getting injured in his arm, the father. The father was asking the ambulances to help him, because he could see the ambulances. I cannot see the ambulance ... I wasn't far away, maybe from them [Jamal and Muhammad] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked at me and he said, "Help me." I said, "I cannot, I can't help you." The shooting till then was really heavy ... It was really raining bullets, for more than for 45&nbsp;minutes. Then I find, I hear something, "boom!" Really is coming with a lot of dust. I looked at the boy, I filmed the boy lying down in the father's lap, and the father really, getting really injured, and he was really dizzy. I said, "Oh my god, the boy's got killed, the boy's got killed," I was screaming, I was losing my mind. While I was filming, the boy got killed ...<ref name=nprinterview>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1111864 National Public Radio 2000].</ref></blockquote>

An hour later, after the al-Durrahs had been evacuated by ambulance, Abu Rahma managed to escape from the scene, he said. In 2002 he told German journalist [[Esther Schapira]] that he hid behind a white minivan for safety while he was filming, and that it was around 15&nbsp;minutes after the shooting ended before he felt it was safe to drive to his studio in Gaza to send the footage by satellite to France&nbsp;2's bureau in Jerusalem,<ref name=Schapira2002a/> where Enderlin watched the footage and compiled his report. An affidavit sworn by Abu Rahma on October 3, 2000, says the Israeli soldiers shot the boy in cold blood: "I can assert that shooting at the child Mohammed and his father Jamal came from the above-mentioned Israeli military outpost, as it was the only place from which shooting at the child and his father was possible. So, by logic and nature, my long experience in covering hot incidents and violent clashes, and my ability to distinguish sounds of shooting, I can confirm that the child was intentionally and in cold blood shot dead and his father injured by the Israeli army."<ref name=affidavit/> The affidavit was given to the [[Palestinian Centre for Human Rights]] in Gaza, and signed by the cameraman in the presence of [[Raji Sourani]], a human rights lawyer. France&nbsp;2's communications director, Christine Delavennat, later said Abu Rahma denied having accused the Israeli army of firing at the boy in cold blood, and that this had been falsely attributed to him.<ref name=Cahen>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060207062000/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewForeignBureaus.asp?Page=\\ForeignBureaus\\archive\\200502\\FOR20050215c.html Cahen 2005].</ref>

===Israeli response===
[[File:Isaac Herzog 2004.JPG|right|thumb|130px|[[Isaac Herzog]], Israeli Cabinet Secretary, said the Palestinian police could have stopped the shooting.<ref name=BBCOct2/>|alt=photograph]]
The position of the Israeli government and IDF changed over time, from accepting responsibility in October 2000 to retracting that admission in September 2007.<ref name=Seaman2008/> The IDF's first response when Enderlin contacted them before his broadcast was that the Palestinians "make cynical use of women and children," which he decided not to air.<ref name=Schwartz1/> The day after the shooting, the IDF issued a statement saying it was impossible to determine the origin of the fire.<ref name=France2vKarsenty/> On October 3, the Israeli army's chief of operations, Major-General [[Giora Eiland]], said the shots had apparently been fired by Israeli soldiers; the soldiers had been shooting from small slits in the wall, he said, and had not had a clear field of vision.<ref name=mekki/> Second Lieutenant Idan Quris, who was at the time in command of an engineering platoon at the Israeli outpost, and Lieutenant-Colonel Nizar Fares of the Herev Battalion, at the time acting commander of the outpost, said they did not know who killed the boy, and that no one had seen him from the Israeli position.<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/73699799.html?dids=73699799:73699799&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jun+6%2C+2001&author=ARIEH+O%27SULLIVAN&pub=Jerusalem+Post&edition=&startpage=02&desc=Southern+Command+decorates+soldiers%2C+units O'Sullivan 2001].</ref> The Israeli Cabinet Secretary, [[Isaac Herzog]], said that Palestinian security forces could have intervened. "[I]f Palestinian policemen had wanted to save the boy," he told the BBC, "they could have walked into the square, said 'Stop the fire'...&nbsp;and rescued the kid". He said the Israelis had been trying to speak to Palestinian commanders for hours.<ref name=BBCOct2>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/952600.stm BBC News, October 2, 2000].</ref>

In late October 2000, IDF's southern commander, Major General [[Yom Tov Samia]], set up a controversial team of largely non-military investigators (see [[#October 2000: IDF investigation|below]]), who concluded that the IDF was probably, or certainly, not responsible, depending on who was issuing the statement. The investigators' report was not published, but was presented in 2001 to the prime minister's foreign media adviser, [[Raanan Gissin|Ra'anan Gissin]], and Daniel Seaman, director of the Israeli government press office. Gissin and Seaman began to challenge France&nbsp;2 in media interviews, to the point where the network threatened the prime minister's office three times with legal action. In 2005, Major-General Eiland publicly retracted the army's admission of responsibility, and in September 2007 a government press office statement to that effect was approved by the prime minister's office. Seaman writes that this was done, at least in part, because Israel's reluctance to support Philippe Karsenty in the libel action France&nbsp;2 had brought against him (see [[#Philippe Karsenty litigation|below]])<U+2014>based on an unwillingness to appear to interfere in another state's legal proceedings<U+2014>was being misinterpreted as a validation of the France&nbsp;2 report.<ref name=Seaman2008/>

==Controversy==
===Overview===
Next to the view that Israeli gunfire killed the boy, two alternative narratives emerged, known as the "minimalist" and "maximalist" narratives. The "minimalist" narrative is that Palestinian gunfire caused his death, or that no one knows who did. The "maximalist" narrative is that the incident was staged by the Palestinians for propaganda purposes<U+2014>without Enderlin's knowledge<U+2014>and that the boy may not be dead at all, or may have been killed as part of the staging.<ref name=Schwartz1>[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/in-the-footsteps-of-the-al-dura-controversy-1.232296 Schwartz 2007], and [http://web.archive.org/web/20080531030409/http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1211872839035&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Derfner 2008].</ref>

The controversy centers on two areas: the raw footage and its interpretation by Enderlin, and the lack of any investigation into the boy's death. There is confusion about when the incident occurred, how much footage was shot, why it was blurred at the moment the shots were fired, why France&nbsp;2 cut the final scene, and what time the boy arrived at the hospital. No ballistic tests were conducted.<ref name=Shuman>[http://www.israelinsider.com/channels/diplomacy/articles/dip_0182.htm Shuman 2002]; also see [[Richard Landes]]'s [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOwZ8wgV7I4 ''Al Durah: According to Palestinian sources II. Birth of an icon''], 2005.</ref> Within days of the incident, the IDF demolished the wall and concrete cylinder the al-Durrahs had sheltered against; they said they did this to remove hiding places for snipers.<ref name=Orme2>[http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/28/world/israeli-army-says-palestinians-may-have-shot-gaza-boy.html?scp=1&sq=Israeli%20Army%20Says%20Palestinians%20May%20Have%20Shot%20Gaza%20Boy&st=cse Orme 2000b].</ref> There is no evidence that bullets were recovered, whether from the scene, from the bodies, or from Jamal. There was no full autopsy, though a pathologist did examine the boy's body.<ref name=Fallows/> In an interview with Esther Schapira in 2002, Abu Rahma, the cameraman, said bullets had indeed been recovered. He suggested Schapira ask a named Palestinian general about them. The general told Schapira that he had no bullets, and that there had been no Palestinian investigation because there was no doubt as to who had shot the boy. When told the general had no bullets, Abu Rahma said that France&nbsp;2 had collected bullets at the scene. He said: "We have some secrets for ourselves ... We cannot give anything ... everything."<ref name=Schapira2002a>Schapira 2002a.</ref>

===Confusion about timeline===<!--this subhead is linked to-->
Confusion has also arisen about the timeline, some reports suggesting the boy was shot before ten in the morning; others at noon; others at three in the afternoon. Even within France 2 itself there is unresolved confusion, with the cameraman placing the shooting around noon local time, while Enderlin's report<U+2014>which aired on France&nbsp;2's nightly news program at 8:00&nbsp;pm (GMT+2)<U+2014>gave the time as 3:00&nbsp;pm Israeli local time (GMT+3).<ref>Enderlin's report said: "1500 hours, everything has just erupted near the settlement of Netzarim ..." [http://www.theaugeanstables.com/al-durah-affair-the-dossier/courts-decision-in-the-karsenty-case/ Enderlin, France&nbsp;2 v. Karsenty, 2006]. [[Israel Standard Time]] is two hours ahead of GMT, while [[Israel Summer Time]] is three hours ahead. According to a law enacted by the [[Knesset]] in July 2000, Israel Summer Time ended that year on October 6, meaning that on September 30, Israel was three hours ahead of GMT. See Israeli Government Printing Office, 2000; here [http://www.webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/g.html#i] for further information about time in Israel.</ref> James Fallows wrote in ''The Atlantic'' in 2003 that Jamal and Muhammad first made an appearance in the footage at 3:00&nbsp;pm (GMT+3), arguing that the time can be judged by later comments from Jamal and some journalists on the scene, and by the length of the shadows.<ref name=Fallows/> [[Brian Whitaker]] wrote in ''The Guardian'' in 2000 that the news first arrived in London from the Associated Press at 6:00&nbsp;pm BST (GMT+1), followed minutes later by a similar report from Reuters.<ref name=Whitaker2000>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/oct/05/israel6 Whitaker 2000].</ref>

Contradicting the 3&nbsp;pm timeline, Mohammed Tawil, the doctor who admitted Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital, told Esther Schapira that he was admitted around 10:00 am (GMT+3).<ref>Mohammed Tawil interview in [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0TyGuLh-8Y Schapira 2009], begins at 1:18&nbsp;minutes.</ref> Abu Rahma, the France&nbsp;2 cameraman, insisted that the intensive shooting had begun at noon.<ref name=affidavit/> According to St<U+00E9>phane Juffa of the Israeli Metula News Agency, another doctor at the Shifa hospital, Dr. Joumaa Saka, said that Muhammad was admitted before 1:00&nbsp;pm.<ref name=Juffa1>[http://www.menapress.com/article.php?sid=962 Juffa 2003].</ref> Fallows said he saw a hospital report saying a dead boy with an eight-inch (20-cm) cut down his belly was admitted at 1:00&nbsp;pm. Fallows also said there was a discrepancy regarding the time of the funeral. A boy wrapped in a Palestinian flag, with his face exposed, who Fallows said looked like Muhammad, was carried through the streets of the refugee camp in front of thousands of mourners. Several news organizations said this occurred on the evening of September 30. Fallows said it appeared to take place in full sunlight, with shadows suggesting it was midday.<ref name=Fallows/>

In addition to confusion about the timing, early reports named the boy as Rami Aldura.<ref name="Whitaker2000"/> Abu Rahma explained later that it was believed his name was Rami until a local CBS stringer, who was married to Jamal's sister, identified the couple in the footage as Jamal and Muhammad al-Durrah.<ref>Abu Rahma interview in [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0TyGuLh-8Y Schapira 2009], begins at 6:17&nbsp;minutes.</ref> This early confusion over times and names is one of the arguments Esther Schapira advances for her hypothesis that two boys were involved in shooting incidents that day (see [[#2009: Das Kind, der Tod und die Wahrheit|below]]).<ref>[http://www.faz.net/s/Rub510A2EDA82CA4A8482E6C38BC79C4911/Doc~E522A31B482904CC285E3B2DAA55275F3~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html ''Frankfurter Allgemeine'', March 4, 2009].</ref>

===October 2000: IDF investigation===
Major General [[Yom Tov Samia]], the IDF's southern commander, set up a team of investigators shortly after the incident, though the extent to which it was an official investigation remains unclear. IDF Chief of Staff [[Shaul Mofaz]] said the team was put together by Samia alone, not by the IDF's General Staff,<ref name=CygielmanNov8>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080719131233/http://www.ajds.org.au/intifada/netzarim.htm Cygielman, November 8, 2000].</ref> but Daniel Seaman, the Israeli government's press spokesman, said in 2008 that the investigation was an official one by virtue of Samia's rank.<ref name=Seaman2008>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080628194920/http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1214132686919 Seaman 2008].</ref> James Fallows writes that Israeli commentators questioned the legitimacy of it as soon as it started; ''Haaretz'' called it "almost a pirate endeavour."<ref name=Fallows/> The team appears to have been led by Nahum Shahaf, a physicist, and Joseph Doriel, an engineer and former director of the Israel Institute of Productivity.<ref>[http://books.google.ca/books?id=aMKwIlEXHkEC&pg=PA152 Business and Economics Research Directory, 1996], p.&nbsp;152.</ref> The team included Meir Danino, a physicist and chief scientist at Elisra Systems; Bernie Schechter, a ballistics expert and former head of the weapons laboratory at the Israel's police criminal identification laboratory; and Chief Superintendent Elliot Springer, also from the criminal identification lab. A full list of names was never released, and a request by ''Haaretz'' to see the team's order of appointment was turned down.<ref name=Schwartz1/>

[[Nahum Shahaf]] is known as one of the leading developers of pilotless light aircraft and video instrumentation, and was awarded a medal in 1997 by the Israeli Ministry of Science for his work on compressing digital video transmission.<ref>[http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp482.htm Lord 2002]; [http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/06/who-shot-mohammed-al-dura/2735/ Fallows 2003].</ref> He had previously worked as an inventor, and for a time was a hang-glider instructor in California. According to Anat Cygielman in ''Haaretz'', Shahaf was involved in some of [[Yitzhak Rabin assassination conspiracy theories|the conspiracy theories]] surrounding the murder of Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] in 1995.<ref name=Cygielman/> Shahaf contacted Samia shortly after the al-Durrah incident to say he had noticed an anomaly, namely that the concrete drum itself seemed undamaged, though the people sheltering behind it were alleged to have been hit from a direction that should have seen the drum punctured too.<ref name=Fallows/> He suggested that he and Doriel<U+2014>they knew each other from previous discussions about the Rabin assassination, according to Cygielman<ref name=Cygielman/><U+2014>be engaged to conduct an investigation, free of charge. Enderlin said that Shahaf wrote to him requesting a copy of the unedited footage, saying it was for "various professional audiences, including film schools," with the name of a company, Eye to Eye Communications, next to his signature.<ref name=Schemla/> Enderlin declined, and was subsequently concerned to learn that Shahaf was associated with an IDF inquiry.<ref name=Cygielman>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080719131233/http://www.ajds.org.au/intifada/netzarim.htm Cygielman 2000].</ref>

====Reconstruction====
Because General Samia had destroyed the wall and the concrete drum, Shahaf and Doriel built models of the wall, the drum, and the IDF post in a location near [[Beersheba]] in the [[Negev]] desert. Fallows writes that the concrete drum with its two-inch-thick walls, which sat between the al-Durrahs and the Israeli line of fire, can be seen in the footage with a mark from the Israeli Bureau of Standards. This allowed Shahaf and Doriel to determine its dimensions and composition. They used mannequins to represent the al-Durrahs, then reproduced the shooting using M16 rounds. Each bullet made an indentation in the drum of two-fifths to four-fifths of an inch deep. Footage taken by Abu Rahma for France&nbsp;2 the day after the incident does show ten indentations on the side of the drum that faced the IDF, but photographs of the drum reportedly show no damage on the side that the al-Durrahs were huddled against. That is, no bullets went right through the drum, Shahaf and Doriel concluded. They also concluded that the round shape of the bullet holes in the wall showed the fire did not come from the IDF. They fired into the reconstructed concrete wall from different angles, and found that, to produce a round hole, they had to fire from more or less straight on. A shot from the angle representing the position of the IDF post produced an elongated hole. They concluded that the evidence was consistent with shots coming from a position behind the France&nbsp;2 cameraman, roughly in the location of "the pita," the circular dirt berm in the north-west quadrant of the junction, where Palestinian police officers are alleged to have been standing, armed with automatic rifles (see [[#Netzarim junction layout|above]]).<ref name=Fallows/>

====Conclusions, withdrawal of Israeli responsibility====
[[File:Ophir Pines-Paz.jpg|right|thumb|120px|[[Knesset]] member [[Ophir Pines-Paz]] said the inquiry had "foregone conclusions."<ref name=HaaretzNov8/>|alt=photograph]]
On October 23, 2000, Shahaf and Doriel invited a CBS camera crew to film the reenactment, Doriel telling the correspondent, [[Bob Simon]], that he believed the boy's death was real, but had been staged to besmirch Israel's reputation. Those in the know included the cameraman and the boy's father, Doriel said, though the latter had not realized the boy would be killed. The interview was aired on November 12.<ref>Cordesman and Moravitz 2005, p.&nbsp;372; [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/11/09/60minutes/main248255.shtml Simons 2000].</ref> When General Samia saw it, he removed Doriel from the investigation.<ref name=Cygielman/>

The report was never published. It was shown to the head of Israeli military intelligence, and the key points were presented to the media in November 2000 as not ruling out that the IDF had shot the boy, though describing it as unlikely.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/28/world/28MIDE.html ''The New York Times'', November 27, 2000].</ref> Danny Seaman and the prime minister's foreign media adviser, Dr. Ra'anan Gissin, were shown the report in early 2001; Seaman said the investigation convinced him that the France&nbsp;2 story was inaccurate.<ref name=Seaman2008/> The investigation provoked widespread criticism.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/nov/28/israel Goldenberg 2000b].</ref> A ''Haaretz'' editorial said, "it is hard to describe in mild terms the stupidity of this bizarre investigation."<ref>[http://www.seconddraft.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=283:stupidity-marches-on&catid=43:the-a-dura-case Haaretz, November 10, 2000]; [http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/06/who-shot-mohammed-al-dura/2735/ Fallows 2003].</ref> Knesset member [[Ophir Pines-Paz]] said the army had set up an inquiry with foregone conclusions.<ref name=HaaretzNov8>''Haaretz'', November 8, 2000.</ref> An unnamed senior army officer said the investigation was a disgrace that had piled shame on what was a terrible accident.<ref>Kiley 2000.
*Shahaf's position was taken up in 2002 by the [[:fr:Metula News Agency|Metula News Agency]], also known as Mena, an Israeli French-language press agency created in May 2001 by St<U+00E9>phane Juffa, and based in [[Metula]], Israel. See [http://www.revue-medias.com/article.php3?id_article=288 Deguine 2006]; and for more information about Mena, see [http://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.menapress.com%2Fapropos.php Introduction to Mena], Metula News Agency. Mena wrote about the al-Durrah case on an almost daily basis, and in November 2002 produced a 20-minute documentary called ''Al Dura<U+2014>The Investigation'', based largely on Shahaf's work. Juffa concluded that the incident was a set up. In January 2003, G<U+00E9>rard Huber, a French psychoanalyst who was Mena's permanent correspondent in Paris, published a book, ''Contre expertise d'une mise en scene'' ("Second opinion on a set-up") expounding the same theory.</ref>

In February 2005, Shahaf presented his views to the [[American Academy of Forensic Sciences]]. In addition to concluding that Palestinian gunmen had fired the shots, he also said a long cut on Muhammad's body described by one of the doctors was more consistent with a knife wound than a bullet. He said the evidence of the doctors was not consistent with photographs of the boy's body, suggesting that the dead boy in the photographs was not al-Durrah, that the body had reached the hospital before the incident was reported to have started, and that the signs of injury on the boy's body were not consistent with fresh blood. He added that several manufactured incidents, including gunfights, were visible in the television footage.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070801122544/http://www.aafs.org/pdf/NewOrleansabstracts05.pdf Rogev and Nahum 2005], section B27, p.&nbsp;44.</ref>

In September 2007, an Israeli government press office statement, approved by the Prime Minister's office, withdrew the IDF's October 2000 acceptance of responsibility (see [[#Israeli response|above]] for more details),<ref name=Seaman2008/> and in 2008, an IDF spokesman, Col. Shlomi Am-Shalom, said the Shahaf report showed the IDF could not have shot Muhammad and asked France&nbsp;2 to send the IDF the unedited 27&nbsp;minutes of raw footage, as well as footage the France&nbsp;2 cameraman shot the day after the incident.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080526213849/http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1211288137213&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Rettig Gur 2008].</ref>

===Questions about the footage===
====How much was taken====
There is confusion regarding how much footage was taken and what it shows. Abu Rahma said that the gunfight lasted 45&nbsp;minutes, and that he filmed about 27&nbsp;minutes of it.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080507120225/http://www.pchrgaza.ps/special/tv2.htm Abu Rahma 2000], and [http://www.haaretz.com/news/independent-expert-idf-bullets-didn-t-kill-mohammed-al-dura-1.240438 Schwartz 2008].</ref> Just over one minute shows the al-Durrahs, and 59&nbsp;seconds were broadcast. No part of the footage shows the boy dead,<ref name=Schwartz1/> though Enderlin did announce his death: "Another burst of fire. Mohamed is dead and his father seriously wounded."<ref name=France2vKarsenty/> Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the end, during which the boy appears to lift his hand away from his face, leading critics to say he was peeking at the camera.<ref name=Fallows/> Enderlin said he cut this scene in accordance with the France&nbsp;2 ethical charter, because it showed the boy in his death throes ("''agonie''"), which he said was "unbearable".<ref>Enderlin wrote to ''The Atlantic'' in response to an article in September 2003 by James Fallows: "James Fallows writes, 'The footage of the shooting ... illustrates the way in which television transforms reality' and, notably, 'France&nbsp;2 or its cameraman may have footage that it or he has chosen not to release.' We do not transform reality. But since some parts of the scene are unbearable, France&nbsp;2 cut a few seconds from the scene, in accordance with our ethical charter."</ref>

The issue of how much footage exists was further confused in November 2007. France&nbsp;2 sued Philippe Karsenty, a French media commentator, for libel, after Karsenty accused them of having broadcast a hoax. A court ruled in France&nbsp;2's favor, but Karsenty appealed; see [[#2007: Karsenty v. Enderlin-France 2|below]]. The court of appeal asked to see the footage, and in November 2007, France&nbsp;2 presented the court with just 18&nbsp;minutes of footage. According to Agence France Press, France&nbsp;2 said the rest had been destroyed because it had not been about the shooting.<ref>Agence France Presse, November 14, 2007: "Alors que la cour s'attendait <U+00E0> voir 27&nbsp;minutes de rushes, France&nbsp;2 n'en a pr<U+00E9>sent<U+00E9> mercredi que 18&nbsp;minutes, assurant que le reste avait <U+00E9>t<U+00E9> d<U+00E9>truit car il ne concernait pas l'<U+00E9>pisode incrimin<U+00E9>" ("While the court waited to see the 27&nbsp;minutes of rushes, France&nbsp;2 presented on Wednesday only 18&nbsp;minutes, assuring the court that the rest had been destroyed because it did not concern the incriminating episode").</ref> Enderlin then seemed to say there had never been 27&nbsp;minutes of footage; according to ''The Jerusalem Post'', he said just before the screening, "I do not know where this 27&nbsp;minutes comes from. In all there were only 18&nbsp;minutes of footage shot in Gaza."<ref name=Schoumann2007>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080622192742/http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?c=JPArticle&cid=1195036613140&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Schoumann 2007].</ref>

====2004: French journalists view the footage====
In February 2004, [[Arlette Chabot]] became news director of France 2, replacing [[:fr:Olivier Mazerolle|Olivier Mazerolle]], who had been in the position since March 2001. On October 22, 2004, the network allowed three senior French journalists to view the footage<U+2014>[[Denis Jeambar]], the editor-in-chief of ''L'Express''; [[:fr:Daniel Leconte|Daniel Leconte]], a former France 2 correspondent, and head of news documentaries at Arte, a state-run television network; and [[:fr:Luc Rosenzweig|Luc Rosenzweig]], a former managing editor of ''Le Monde''. The journalists asked to speak to the cameraman, who was in Paris at the time, but France 2 told them he did not speak French and that his English was not good enough.<ref name=Poller2005>[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/printarticle.cfm/myth--fact--and-the-al-dura-affair-9935 Poller 2005].</ref>

Having viewed the footage, Jeambar and Leconte wrote in ''Le Figaro'' on January 25, 2005, that there was no scene in it that showed the boy had died.<ref name=Jeambar>[http://www.shalomarchav.be/imprimer.php3?id_article=978 Jeambar and Leconte 2005].</ref> When Enderlin said Muhammad was dead, they wrote "he had no possibility of determining that he was in fact dead, and even less so, that he had been shot by IDF soldiers."<ref name=Schwartz1/> While they did not believe the scene was staged, they said the footage did not show the boy's death throes. "This famous 'agony' that Enderlin insisted was cut from the montage," they wrote, "does not exist."<ref name=Carvajal>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/07/business/worldbusiness/07iht-video07_ed3_.html Carvajal 2005]</ref>

The first 23&nbsp;minutes of the footage showed Palestinians playing at war for the cameras, they said, falling down as if wounded, then getting up and walking away. A France&nbsp;2 official told them, "You know it's always like that,"<ref name=Cahen/> a comment that Leconte said he found disturbing. "I think that if there is a part of this event that was staged, they have to say it," he said, "that there was a part that was staged, that it can happen often in that region for a thousand reasons."<ref name=Carvajal/> Leconte did not conclude that the shooting was faked. He said, "At the moment of the shooting, it's no longer acting, there's really shooting, there's no doubt about that."<ref name=Cahen/> In an interview with ''Cybercast News'', he said he believed the Palestinians had shot the boy. "The only ones who could hit the child were the Palestinians from their position," he said. "If they had been Israeli bullets, they would be very strange bullets because they would have needed to go around the corner." He dismissed France&nbsp;2's explanation<U+2014>that perhaps the bullets that hit the boy had ricocheted off the ground. "It could happen once, but that there should be eight or nine of them, which go around a corner? They're just saying anything."<ref name=Cahen/>

The third journalist to view the raw footage, Luc Rosenzweig<U+2014>who had previously written material about the incident for the Metula News Agency (Mena; see [[#Metula News Agency|above]])<U+2014>disagreed with Jeambar and Leconte. He concluded that the shooting had been staged, calling it "an almost perfect media crime."<ref>[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/david/gelernter091205.php3 Gelertner 2005]; also see [http://www.m-r.fr/actualite.php?id=1499 Rosenzweig 2007].</ref> Jeambar and Leconte say they and Rosenzweig had agreed not to discuss what they saw on the footage until all had agreed on a response, but Rosenzweig spoke to Mena about it, and Mena published his account, concluding that it supported the allegation of staging. Jeambar and Leconte distanced themselves from that conclusion. They wrote in ''Le Figaro'': "To those who, like Mena, tried to use us to support the theory that the child's death was staged by the Palestinians, we say they are misleading us and their readers. Not only do we not share this point of view, but we attest that, given our present knowledge of the case, nothing supports that conclusion. In fact, the reverse is true."<ref name=France2vKarsenty/>

====Enderlin's response====
On January 27, also in ''Le Figaro'', Enderlin responded to Leconte and Jeambar's article. He said the whispering campaign against him had resulted in death threats against him that were taken seriously by the Israeli police, forcing him to move house. He wrote that he had said the bullets were fired by the Israelis because he trusted the cameraman, who had worked for France 2 since 1988. It was the cameraman who made the initial claim during the broadcast, and later had it confirmed by other journalists and sources. Enderlin said the Israeli army did not respond to France 2's offers to cooperate in an investigation. "The image corresponded to the reality of the situation," he wrote, "not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank." Citing Ben Kaspi in the Israeli newspaper, ''Maariv'', he said during the first months of the Second Intifada, the IDF had fired one million rounds of ammunition<U+2014>700,000 in the West Bank and 300,000 in Gaza. He said that, from 29 September to late October 2000, 118 Palestinians were killed, including 33 under the age of 18, compared to 11 adult Israelis killed during the same period.<ref name=EnderlinFigaro/>

===Esther Schapira documentaries===<!--this subhead is linked to-->

====2002: ''Drei Kugeln und ein totes Kind''====
In March 2002, the German network [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] broadcast ''Drei Kugeln und ein totes Kind'' ("Three Bullets and a Dead child") by [[Esther Schapira]]. Muhammad's mother told Schapira that Muhammad had left with his father for Gaza after breakfast at 10 am (GMT+3). Jamal said they arrived at the junction around 11 am, then headed to a car auction. They approached the junction a second time around midday on the way back in a cab, but it was closed to allow ambulances through, so they proceeded on foot. At around midday, there was suddenly live fire.<ref name=Schapira2002b/> At the point at which Muhammad was seen lying in Jamal's lap, Schapira said a hand covered the lens of the France 2 camera, and the film was cut, returning only when the dust had settled.<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6816147079262871882&ei=O05LS4u_OJm-qQLdy0E&q=three+bullets+and+a+dead+child# Schapira 2002(b)], from around 13:00&nbsp;minutes.</ref> Abu Rahma told her he reached his studio in Gaza at 4:15&nbsp;pm (GMT+3)<U+2014>with 60&nbsp;minutes of footage, according to Schapira<U+2014>where he was scheduled at 4:30&nbsp;pm to feed his pictures to the France 2 Jerusalem office by satellite. He said he fed six&nbsp;minutes back to Jerusalem, which he described as "from the shooting to the end." Schapira said the footage arrived at the France 2 studio at around 6&nbsp;pm. Enderlin asked the army for a statement and compiled his report.<ref name=Schapira2002b/>

Schapira interviewed three anonymous Israeli soldiers who had been on duty at the IDF post. One of them said they knew something was about to happen because of the number of camera crews that had gathered; Schapira said that at least 10 Palestinian photographers and camera crews working for Western news agencies had assembled at the junction. The situation began to escalate around midday.<ref name=Schapira2002b/> One of the soldiers said the live fire started from the high-rise Palestinian blocks known as "the twins"<U+2014>see the lower right quadrant of [[:File:Diagram with cameraman's affidavit1.JPG|this image]]. The shooter was firing at the IDF post, the soldier said, who added that he had not seen the al-Durrahs.<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6816147079262871882&ei=O05LS4u_OJm-qQLdy0E&q=three+bullets+and+a+dead+child# Schapira 2002(b)], 16:03&nbsp;minutes</ref> The Israelis returned fire on a Palestinian station 30 meters to the left of the al-Durrahs; the soldier said their weapons were equipped with optics that allowed them to fire accurately, and that none of them had switched to automatic fire.<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6816147079262871882&ei=O05LS4u_OJm-qQLdy0E&q=three+bullets+and+a+dead+child# Schapira 2002(b)], 17:00&nbsp;minutes.</ref> In the view of the soldier, the shooting was no accident, because the range was too close and the visibility too good, but the fire did not come from the Israeli position, he said.<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6816147079262871882&ei=O05LS4u_OJm-qQLdy0E&q=three+bullets+and+a+dead+child# Schapira 2002(b)], 18:13&nbsp;minutes.</ref>

The French [[Jewish Defense League]] organized a demonstration of 1,000 protesters outside the France 2 offices in Paris in October 2002,<ref>[http://www.revue-medias.com/article.php3?id_article=288 Deguine 2006].</ref> where Schapira's film was projected onto a giant screen, and France 2 and Enderlin were awarded a "prize for disinformation."<ref name=France2vKarsenty/> Enderlin described the event as a deliberate incitement to hatred and violence.<ref name=Schemla/> Israeli historian [[Tom Segev]] wrote that the documentary said nothing new about the incident, but conveyed something about the power of propaganda and the failures of the IDF spokesman's office. He said Schapira had not succeeded in ruling out that the IDF had killed the boy, but had shown that it was impossible to say with certainty that they did.<ref name=Segev>[http://web.archive.org/web/20061119084403/http://www.proche-orient.info/images/mbd/Segev_haaretz.htm Segev 2002]</ref>

====2009: ''Das Kind, der Tod und die Wahrheit''====
In a second ARD film broadcast in March 2009, ''Das Kind, der Tod und die Wahrheit'' ("The Child, the Death, and the Truth"), Schapira and George M. Hafner report another Palestinian boy died earlier that day, and that images of the boy who died may not have been of Muhammad.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_3tg1_bt0 Schapira 2009] (German).

=====Interview with Dr Tawil=====
Schapira interviewed Dr Mohammed Tawil of the Al-Shifa Hospital. He said that at 10 am (GMT+3) two people were delivered within a minute of one another, both dead. One was a small boy, the other an ambulance driver who had been shot through the heart. Tawil said he learned later that the boy was Muhammad Jamal al-Durrah. He said the boy had a serious injury to his abdomen, and that his bowels were lying outside his body.<ref name=SchapiraTawil>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL_7W3buoLY&feature=related Shapira 2009, part 3], from 9:22&nbsp;minutes; [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aaickqggI0&feature=related Shapira 2009, part 4], from the beginning (German).</ref> Schapira said that, according to all other reports, Jamal and Muhammad had not yet reached the junction by 10 am (GMT+3), and that the shooting is reported to have started between midday and 2&nbsp;pm (GMT+3). She also said that Jamal and Muhammad were reportedly transported away from the scene together, yet did not arrive at the hospital together, according to Dr. Tawil. She argues that the discrepancies suggest there was a mix-up of some kind.<ref name=SchapiraTawil/>

Hospital records show that, at midday, a young boy was examined in the pathology department. Schapira argued that it was the same boy Tawil had admitted, because the pathologist noted the same kind of injury. The pathologist, Dr Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined the boy for half an hour, and told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs had been expelled and were lying outside his body. He showed Schapira images that he had taken of the body, with cards identifying it as Muhammad's.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aaickqggI0&feature=related Schapira 2009, part 4], from 2:20&nbsp;minutes.</ref> Schapira's camera zoomed in to show a watch on the wrist of one of the pathologists, which appeared to say 3:50 (GMT+3).<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aaickqggI0&feature=related Schapira 2009, part 4], from 1:25&nbsp;minutes.</ref> That evening, before dusk, the funeral took place in the al-Bureij refugee camp, about one hour away by car. Her camera zoomed in to show a watch on the wrist of a mourner, which appeared to say 5:30 (GMT+3). Schapira argued that this could not have been Muhammad, because the time that had elapsed between the incident<U+2014>reported by Enderlin as taking place at 3&nbsp;pm (GMT+3)<U+2014>and the funeral was too short (but see [[#Confusion about timeline|above]] regarding confusion over the timeline).<ref name=Schapirafuneral>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aaickqggI0&feature=related Schapira 2009, part 4] from 2:55&nbsp;minutes.</ref>

=====Confusion over the name=====
Schapira suggested the dead boy may have been called Rami al-Durrah, the name first reported by Reuters and the Associated Press.<ref>Brian Whitaker wrote in ''The Guardian'' on October 5, 2000: "The first report of Mohammed's killing came from the American agency, Associated Press, just before 6pm last Saturday [GMT+1]. Unedited, the relevant part said: 'Among those killed was a 12-year-old boy who was caught in the crossfire. The boy, Rami Aldura, and his father, were crouched behind a metal barrel, trying to seek cover and pleading for a ceasefire. The father held his hand protectively over the boy, who was screaming with fear, only to see his son fatally shot in the stomach.'<p> A few minutes later, Reuters circulated a report which said: 'In Netzarim, 12-year-old Rami Aldura and his father Jamal were caught in the crossfire.' Both reports got the boy's name partly wrong ..." (see Whitaker, October 5, 2000).</ref> The name was changed to Muhammad by Abu Rahma, the France 2 cameraman, when another journalist, Sami<U+2014>who was married to Jamal al-Durrah's sister<U+2014>saw the footage. Abu Rahma told Schapira: "[Sami] shouted, 'That is Muhammad al-Durrah, that is Jamal al-Durrah. I'm married to his sister.' In that moment, they were reporting the name of the boy as Rami al-Durrah. As I then played back my material, I changed the news reports from Rami to Muhammad Jamal al-Durrah."<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aaickqggI0&feature=related Schapira 2009, part 4], from 4:32&nbsp;minutes.</ref>

The assumption that the boy in the footage was also the boy in the hospital morgue may not have been correct, Schapira suggested.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aaickqggI0&feature=related Schapira 2009, part 4], from 3:34&nbsp;minutes.</ref> She arranged for Kurt Kinderman, a facial imaging expert, to examine images of Muhammad. Kinderman said that the faces in the pathology and funeral images belong to the same boy, but in his view they are not the boy in photographs identified as Muhammad; he said there were significant differences in the shape of the eyebrows and mouth.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aaickqggI0&feature=related Schapira 2009, part 4], from 5:28&nbsp;minutes.</ref> She obtained other images of an injured boy being taken to hospital, on or around that day, which appeared to be Muhammad, but their authenticity had not been established and their source was unknown. Schapira also argued that there was no blood in the France 2 footage, except for one red mark that she said was a red piece of cloth. There were no blood stains by the concrete drum in some of the footage taken the next day, and in the images that show blood stains, she argued that the color of the blood was too bright given the time that had elapsed.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp8CnS2mEw8&feature=related Schapira 2009, part 2], 9:35&nbsp;minutes, and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL_7W3buoLY&feature=related part 3], from the beginning].</ref> She concluded that Muhammad may have died, but that he did not die as presented by France 2.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aaickqggI0&feature=related Schapira 2009, part 4], from 7:22&nbsp;minutes.</ref>

===Allegations about father's injuries===<!--this subhead is linked to-->
On December 13, 2007, Israel's Channel 10 aired an interview with Dr. Yehuda David, a physician at [[Sheba Medical Center|Tel Hashomer hospital]] near Tel Aviv. David told Channel 10 that he had treated Jamal Al-Dura in 1994 for knife and axe wounds to his arms and legs sustained during a Palestinian gang attack. David said the scars Jamal presented as bullet wounds from the 2000 incident were actually scars from a tendon repair operation that David performed in 1994.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U03h2oEZd0 Channel 10, December 13, 2007]; [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121183795208620963.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries Poller May 2008].</ref>

David made the same assertions in an interview with a "Daniel Vavinsky," published in ''Actualit<U+00E9> Juive'' (Jewish News) on September 4, 2008. Charles Enderlin sent a "right of reply" to ''Actualit<U+00E9> Juive'', along with medical documents and photographs of Jamal's injuries. In late 2008, Jamal filed a defamation complaint against ''Actualit<U+00E9> Juive'' with the ''Tribunal de grande instance'' (superior court) of Paris. The court subsequently established that "Daniel Vavinsky" was a pseudonym for Cl<U+00E9>ment Weill-Raynal, a deputy editor at [[France 3]], and a former adviser on antisemitism and misinformation to the Council of Jewish Organizations. In October 2009 the Paris magistrate issued defamation charges against Weill-Raynal and Serge Benattar, the managing editor of ''Actualit<U+00E9> Juive''.<ref>[http://replay.web.archive.org/20080118045931/http://blog.france2.fr/charles-enderlin/index.php/2007/10/13/60155-message-a-clement Enderlin 2007]; [http://www.politis.fr/Apres-le-drame-la-diffamation,8448.html Sieffert 2009]; [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=2&cid=1261364558103&pagename=JFrench%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull Rosenzweig 2009b].</ref>

In April 2011 the court ruled that David and ''Actualit<U+00E9> Juive'' had defamed Al-Dura. David, Weill-Raynal and Serge Benattar, the managing editor of ''Actualit<U+00E9> Juive'', were fined <U+20AC>5,000 each, and ''Actualit<U+00E9> Juive'' was ordered to print a retraction. David indicated that he would appeal, and the Israeli government said it would finance his case going forward.<ref name=JPostApril292911>[http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=218467 "French court convicts Israeli of slandering al-Durra"], ''The Jerusalem Post'', April 29, 2011.

Media-monitoring NGO, [http://keshev.org.il/en/ Keshev], tracked the way the Israeli media portrayed the verdict in the al-Durrah libel case. The French court ruled that there was not enough information to determine the cause of al-Durrah's wounds. The ruling only determined that the publication was not considered libel under French law. However, Keshev's findings reveal that this outcome was excluded by all media outlets except for Ha'aretz. The verdict was covered extensively, but readers were not provided with the actual text of the French court of appeal's decision. This purposeful choice presented the verdict as a victory to Israeli public diplomacy and as proof that Palestinians are using false propaganda in order to delegitimize Israel. Even further, some of the media outlets presented the verdict as proof that the IDF could not be held responsible for Mohammad's death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://keshev.org.il/en/media-analyses/jamal-al-dura-feb-2012.html |title=Victory in blue & white |publisher=Keshev.org.il |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref>

==Philippe Karsenty litigation==
===2006: Enderlin-France 2 v. Karsenty===
[[File:Philippe Karsenty.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Philippe Karsenty]] was sued for calling the footage a hoax. In 2008, the French court ruled that Karsenty had presented a coherent mass of evidence, and had exercised in good faith his right to criticize.|alt=photograph]]
In response to the claims that it had broadcast a staged scene, Enderlin and France&nbsp;2 filed three defamation suits, seeking symbolic damages of [[Euro|<U+20AC>]]1 from each of the defendants.<ref name=Carvajal2>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/17/technology/17iht-blogs18.2838546.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Can%20Internet%20criticism%20of%20Mideast%20news%20footage%20be%20slander?&st=cse Carvajal 2006].</ref> The most notable lawsuit was against [[Philippe Karsenty]], a deputy mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine and financial consultant, who runs a media watchdog, Media-Ratings.<ref>[http://www.ville-neuillysurseine.fr/1-14550-Vos-elus.php Vos <U+00E9>lus - Site officiel de la ville de Neuilly-sur-Seine], Mayors and deputies of Neuilly-sur-Seine].</ref> He wrote on November 26, 2004 that the shooting scene had been faked by the cameraman, that Muhammad had not been killed, and that Enderlin and Chabot, France&nbsp;2's news editor, should be sacked.<ref>[http://www.m-r.fr/actualite.php?id=1064 Karsenty 2004]. A second case, against Pierre Lur<U+00E7>at of the Jewish Defense League, was dismissed on a technicality. A third, against Dr. Charles Gouz, whose blog republished an article in which France&nbsp;2 was criticized, resulted in a "mitigated judgement" against Gouz for his posting of the word "d<U+00E9>sinformation".</ref> On December 9, 2004, Enderlin issued a writ for libel, followed by France&nbsp;2 on December 3, 2005.<ref>[http://www.theaugeanstables.com/al-durah-affair-the-dossier/courts-decision-in-the-karsenty-case/ Enderlin, France&nbsp;2 v. Karsenty, 2006]; [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J63FZz6k2Wo&feature=related Simon interview with Karsenty 2008].</ref>

The case began on September 14, 2006. Witnesses who testified for Karsenty included the French journalist Luc Rosenzweig, media professor [[Francis Balle]], American historian [[Richard Landes]], G<U+00E9>rard Huber, author of ''Contre expertise d'une mise en scene'', and [[Daniel Dayan]], research director of the French National Centre for Scientific Research.<ref name=France2vKarsenty/> Enderlin submitted as evidence a February 2004 letter from [[Jacques Chirac]], then president of France, which spoke of Enderlin's integrity.<ref name="Chiracletter"/> The court upheld the complaint on October 19, 2006, fining Karsenty <U+20AC>1,000 and ordering him to pay <U+20AC>3,000 in costs.<ref name=Moutet/> He lodged an appeal that same day.<ref name=Karsenty>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J63FZz6k2Wo&feature=related Simon interview with Karsenty, 2008].</ref>

===2007: Karsenty v. Enderlin-France 2===
The case opened on September 19, 2007 in the Paris Court of Appeal, the three-judge panel presided over by Judge Laurence Tr<U+00E9>bucq.<ref name=Poller2008>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121183795208620963.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries Poller, May 2008].</ref>
The court asked France&nbsp;2 to turn over the 27&nbsp;minutes of raw footage the cameraman said he had shot, to be shown during a public hearing on November 14. France&nbsp;2 produced only 18&nbsp;minutes; Karsenty refers to this as "the first tampering of the evidence."<ref name=Karsenty/> Enderlin told ''The Jerusalem Post'' on the day of the hearing that France&nbsp;2 had produced all the raw footage it had, based on "an original tape that was kept in a safe until now. We presented a DVD that was made in front of a bailiff from the original tape... not from the various copies you can find here and there." He said, "I do not know where this 27&nbsp;minutes comes from. In all there were only 18&nbsp;minutes of footage shot in Gaza."<ref name=Schoumann2007/>

The screening lasted from 2:15 to 4&nbsp;pm, interrupted several times so that Enderlin could describe what was happening.<ref name=Schoumann2007/> The footage showed the incident with the al-Durrahs in the last minute. The court heard that the boy put his hand to his forehad and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, and that there was no blood on the boy's shirt.<ref name=Schoumann2007/> Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying,<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/french-court-examines-footage-of-mohammad-al-dura-s-death-1.233240 ''Haaretz'', May 16, 2007].</ref> though the cameraman himself told National Public Radio on October 1, 2000 that he had said out loud, "the boy got killed," when he saw Muhammad lying in his father's lap.<ref name=nprinterview/>
[[File:Diagram of junction with Schlinger report.JPG|thumb|270px|alt=A colored diagram of a crossroads.|Schlinger showed the court this diagram of the junction. It included a position called the "pita" (lower left), where several sources said Palestinian police officers were armed with automatic rifles.<ref name=Schlinger60/> The pita did not appear on the France&nbsp;2 cameraman's diagram, which marked that area as "Fields" (see [[#Netzarim junction layout|above left]]).]]

Karsenty commissioned Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert, to write a 90-page report for the court.<ref>[http://www.m-r.fr/balistique.pdf Schlinger 2008].</ref> Schlinger recreated the incident, examining the angle of the shots, the weapons, and the reported injuries. A diagram he produced (right) included a position behind the France&nbsp;2 cameraman and in front of the al-Durrahs, a circular dirt berm known locally as "the pita," where Palestinian police were armed with automatic rifles.<ref name=Schlinger60/> This position did not appear in the cameraman's report; see the image on the left [[#Netzarim junction layout|above]]. Schlinger concluded: "If Jamal and Mohammed al-Dura were indeed struck by shots, then they could not have come from the Israeli position, from a technical point of view, but only from the direction of the Palestinian position." He said there was no evidence that the boy was wounded in his right leg or abdomen, as reported, and that if the injuries were genuine, they did not occur at the time of the televised events. Had the shots come from the Israeli position, he wrote, only the lower limbs could have been hit.<ref name=Schwartz2>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/independent-expert-idf-bullets-didn-t-kill-mohammed-al-dura-1.240438 Schwartz 2008].</ref>

On February 27, 2008, France 2's lawyer, Ma<U+00EE>tre Fran<U+00E7>ois Szpiner, counsel to former President of France [[Jacques Chirac]], called Karsenty "the Jew who pays a second Jew to pay a third Jew to fight to the last drop of Israeli blood," comparing him to 9/11 conspiracy theorist [[Thierry Meyssan]] and Holocaust denier [[Robert Faurisson]]. Karsenty had it in for Enderlin, Szpiner argued, because of Enderlin's even-handed coverage of the Middle East.<ref name="Poller2008"/>

====2008: Appeal upheld====
The judges overturned the ruling against Karsenty on May 21, 2008 in a 13-page decision. They ruled that he had presented a coherent mass of evidence, had exercised in good faith his right to criticize, and that the cameraman's statements were "not perfectly credible either in form or content."<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/court-backs-claim-that-al-dura-killing-was-staged-1.246313 "Court backs claim that al-Dura killing was staged"], ''Haaretz'', May 22, 2008.

Doreen Carvajal wrote that the France 2 footage acquired the power of a battle flag,<ref name=Carvajal/> with Helen Schary Motro arguing that it took its place alongside other iconic images of children under attack: the [[:File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 06b.jpg|boy with raised hands]] in the Warsaw ghetto (1943), the [[:File:TrangBang.jpg|Vietnamese girl]] doused with napalm (1972), the [[:File:Firefighterbabyocb.jpg|firefighter carrying the dying baby]] away from the Oklahoma City bombing (1995).<ref name=ScharyMotro/> Arab countries issued postage stamps bearing the images, parks and streets were named in Muhammad's honor, and [[Osama bin Laden]] mentioned Muhammad in a "warning" to President George Bush after 9/11.

The French news program ''Jeudi Investigation'' attributed the controversy to radical pro-Israeli commentators and their determined use of the Web to undermine Enderlin, because Muhammad is "an unbearable symbol" for them.<ref name="CanalPlus"/> Mid-East expert Jonathan Randal said: "Charles Enderlin is an excellent journalist!

In 2012, journalist Doha Shams interviewed Jamal Al-Durrah, who maintains that he holds pride in his son as a "martyr": "I am proud of him not just as my son, but as a son of the Arab and Islamic nation. Muhammad<U+2019>s cause and the images of his martyrdom moved the entire world, even people with little conscience...His cause is still out there, every day there are arguments over it".<ref name="english.al-akhbar.com"/> In the same interview, he criticized supporters of Israel over perceived contradictions in their version of the events of his son's death.
