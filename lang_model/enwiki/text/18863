==School==
===Primary===

The primary school currently provides education for children aged 3 to 11. The students are taught according to the [[United Kingdom|British]] curriculum.  The school also follows Ministry of Education guidelines and provides compulsory [[Islamic]] studies courses for Islamic students.

The children have their own eating and play areas. Although very much part of the whole school, they are able to operate independently. The Nursery children have their own outdoor working area and play area.

Reception, Year 1 and Year 2 children share a building and have classes around a central area. The children have their own outside play areas.

The [[Key Stage]] 2 building is identical in design, but houses a study area in the center.  This is used for small group work, independent study and one on one activities.  There is also a primary ICT laboratory in the building.

===Secondary===
The curriculum in the Senior School is based on the English National Curriculum for Key Stage 3, with individual department heads. In Key Stage 4, pupils follow two-year courses culminating in the [[GCSE]] and [[IGCSE]] examinations. Pupils then continue their studies at [[Advanced Subsidiary level|AS]] and [[A level]].

Outside of the academic curriculum, pupils have the opportunity to take part in a small selection of sports and clubs, including the [[Duke of Edinburgh Award]] program.

The school staff are all trained and certified.  Most of the teachers have been trained in England, with the exception of the foreign language teachers who are hired from their own countries.

The first established houses were named after famous explorers; Armstrong [[Neil Armstrong]], Thesiger [[Wilfred Thesiger]] and Cousteau [[Jacques Cousteau]].
