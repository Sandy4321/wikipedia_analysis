===Controversy===
In January 2011 [[Capcom]] released an [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] game entitled ''MaXplosion'', which featured several similarities to ''{{'}}Splosion Man'', including the same game mechanics.  Speaking on [[Twitter]], Twisted Pixel programmer Mike Henry believed the game to be "a complete theft". Twisted Pixel CEO Michael Wilford also pointed out that Twisted Pixel Games once pitched ''{{'}}Splosion Man'' to Capcom, but the game was rejected.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=283185?cid=OTC-RSS&attr=CVG-General-RSS |title=Splosion Man dev accuses Capcom of 'complete game theft' |publisher=[[Computer and Video Games]] |first=Tom |last=Ivan |accessdate=2011-01-12 |date=2011-01-12}}</ref> Twisted Pixel do not plan to take legal action against Capcom.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/01/12/twisted-pixel-ceo-we-wont-pursue-legal-action-over-maxplosion/ |title=Twisted Pixel CEO: We won't pursue legal action over Capcom's MaXplosion |first=Justin |last=McElroy |publisher=Joystiq |date=2011-01-13 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}</ref> Capcom responded to the allegations saying that the game was developed independently by Capcom Mobile, a different division from the one that had discussions with Twisted Pixel, and the game's similarities to ''{{'}}Splosion Man'' was a coincidence.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5733120/capcom-saddened-by-plagiarism-allegations |title=Capcom 'Saddened' By Plagiarism Allegations |first=Owen |last=Good |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=2011-01-20 |date=2011-01-13}}</ref>
