== Biography ==

She has a BA in History of Art and Architecture from the [[University of Manchester]], and is currently a [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] student in journalism at the [[London School of Journalism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourgibraltartv.com/ygtv-news/written-news/politics/4087-june-05-gsd-present-marlene-hassan-nahon-as-by-election-candidate|title=June 06 <U+2013> GSD Present Marlene Hassan-Nahon As By-Election Candidate|editor=YGTV|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=30 June 2013}}</ref>

After the death of the minister [[Charles Bruzon]], she launched herself as a candidate by the [[Gibraltar Social Democrats]] (GSD) in the [[Gibraltar by-election, 2013|by-election of 4 July 2013]]. In a press conference, she stated that she hasn't an agenda (besides the desire to contribute positively to [[Gibraltar]]), and said that she was "disappointed" with the policy practised by the ruling party ([[Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party|GSLP]]) and willing to change the composition of the [[Gibraltar Parliament|parliament]], where there is an "overwhelming number of lawyers" representing both groups of parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsdlive.gi/marlene-hassan-nahon-statement-gsd-mps-in-town-tomorrow-leafleting|title=Marlene Hassan Nahon statement: GSD MPs in Town tomorrow leafleting|editor=GSD|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=30 June 2013}}</ref>

Nahon received 39.95% of the total votes cast, but was not elected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gi/images/parliamentary_election_results/GibratarParliamentBy-Election.pdf|title=The Result-2013|format=pdf|editor=HM Government of Gibraltar|accessdate=7 September 2013}}</ref>
