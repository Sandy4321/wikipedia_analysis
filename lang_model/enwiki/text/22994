The '''Swahili language''', or '''Kiswahili''',<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]]</ref> is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] and the [[mother tongue]] of the [[Swahili people]]. It is spoken by various communities inhabiting the [[African Great Lakes]] region and other parts of [[Southeast Africa]], including [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Mozambique]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].<ref>Prins 1961</ref> The closely related [[Comorian language]], sometimes (and incorrectly) considered a Swahili dialect, is spoken in the [[Comoros|Comoros Islands]].

Although only around five million people speak Swahili as their mother tongue,<ref>{{cite book |title=African folklore: an encyclopedia |last=Peek |first=Philip M. |authorlink= |coauthors=Kwesi Yankah |year=2004 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=0-415-93933-X |page=699}}</ref> it is used as a [[lingua franca]] in much of [[Southeast Africa]].The total number of Swahili speakers exceeds 140 million.<ref>Irele 2010</ref> Swahili serves as a [[national language|national]] or [[official language]] of four nations: Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is also one of the official [[languages of the African Union]].

Some Swahili vocabulary is derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] through more than twelve centuries of contact with Arabic-speaking inhabitants of the [[Swahili Coast]]. It has also incorporated [[German language|German]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] words into its vocabulary through contact with empire builders, traders and slavers during the past five centuries.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
[[File:Swahili-pn.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Although originally written with the [[Arabic script]], Swahili is now written in a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] that was introduced by [[Missionary|Christian missionaries]] and colonial administrators. The text shown here is the Catholic version of the [[Lord's Prayer]].<ref>http://wikisource.org/wiki/Baba_yetu</ref>]]
Swahili is traditionally regarded as being the language of coastal areas of [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]], formalised after independence by presidents of the [[African Great Lakes]] region. It was first spoken by natives of the coastal mainland and spread as a fisherman's language to the various islands surrounding the [[Swahili Coast]].

In any case traders from these islands are known to have had extensive contact with the coastal peoples from at least the 2nd century A.D. and Swahili began to spread along the Swahili Coast from at least the 6th century. There is also cultural evidence of early [[Zaramo people]] settlement on Zanzibar from [[Dar-es-salaam]] in present-day [[Tanzania]]. The African population of the island holds the tradition that it is descended from these early settlers.

[[Clove]] farmers from [[Oman]]<ref>Kharusi, N.S. (2012) The ethnic label Zinjibari: Politics and language choice implications among Swahili speakers in Oman. Ethnicities June 2012 vol. 12 no. 3 335-353, DOI: 10.1177/1468796811432681</ref> and the Persian Gulf farmed the [[Zanzibar Archipelago]], slowly spreading Islam and adding a few words to Swahili language and building forts and castles in major trading and cultural centers as far as [[Sofala]] (Mozambique) and Kilwa (Tanzania) to the south, [[Mombasa]] and [[Lamu]] in Kenya, the Comoros Islands and northern Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, and [[Barawa]] to the north in southern [[Somalia]].

Demand for cloves soon established permanent trade routes, and Swahili-speaking merchants settled in stops along the new trade routes. For the most part, this process started the development of the modern Swahili language. However, the spread was hampered during colonization and did not occur west of [[Lake Malawi]], in what is now [[Katanga Province]] of the Belgian-controlled Democratic Republic of the Congo, thus making it a secondary rather than a primary language in that region.

The earliest known documents written in Swahili are letters written in [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] in 1711 A.D.,in the [[Arabic script]]. They were sent to the Portuguese of Mozambique and their local allies. The original letters are now preserved in the Historical Archives of Goa, India.<ref>E.A. Alpers, ''Ivory and Slaves in East Central Africa'', London, 1975, pp. 98<U+2013>99 ; T. Vernet, "Les cit<U+00E9>s-Etats swahili et la puissance omanaise (1650<U+2013>1720), ''Journal des Africanistes'', 72(2), 2002, pp. 102<U+2013>105.</ref> Another ancient written document is an [[epic poem]] in the Arabic script titled ''[[Utendi wa Tambuka]]'' (''The History of Tambuka''); it is dated 1728.  However, the [[Latin script]] later became standard under the influence of European colonial powers.

=== Colonial period ===
After Germany attacked the region known as [[Tanganyika]] (present-day mainland Tanzania) for a colony in 1886, it took notice of the wide prevalence of Swahili, and soon designated Swahili as a colony-wide official administrative language. The British did not do so in neighbouring Kenya, even though they made moves in that direction. The British and Germans both sought to facilitate their rule over colonies where the inhabitants spoke dozens of different languages <U+2013> thus the colonial authorities selected a single local language which they hoped the natives would find acceptable. Swahili was the only good candidate in these two colonies.

In the aftermath of Germany's defeat in World War I, it was dispossessed of all its overseas territories. Tanganyika fell into British hands. The British authorities, with the collaboration of British Christian [[missionary]] institutions active in these colonies, increased their resolve to institute Swahili as a common language for primary education and low-level governance throughout their East African colonies (Uganda, Tanganyika, Zanzibar, and Kenya). Swahili was to be subordinate to English: university education, much secondary education, and governance at the highest levels would be conducted in English.

One key step in spreading Swahili was to create a standard written language. In June 1928, an inter-territorial conference took place at Mombasa, at which the [[Zanzibar]] dialect, [[Kiunguja]], was chosen to be the basis for standardizing Swahili.<ref>Whiteley 1969: 80</ref> Today's standard Swahili, the version taught as a second language, is for practical purposes Zanzibar Swahili, even though there are minor discrepancies between the written standard and the Zanzibar vernacular.

=== Current status ===
Swahili has become a second language spoken by tens of millions in three African Great Lakes countries, Tanzania, Kenya, and Congo (DRC), where it is an official or national language. The neighboring nation of Uganda made Swahili a required subject in primary schools in 1992<U+2014>although this mandate has not been well implemented<U+2014>and declared it an official language in 2005 in preparation for the [[East African Federation]]. Swahili, or other closely related languages, is spoken by relatively small numbers of people in Burundi, the Comoros, Rwanda, northern [[Zambia]], [[Malawi]], and Mozambique.<ref>Nurse & Thomas Spear (1985) ''The Swahili''<br /></ref> and the language was still understood in the southern ports of the Red Sea and along the coasts of southern Arabia and the Persian Gulf in the twentieth century.<ref>Kharusi, N. S. (2012). The ethnic label Zinjibari: Politics and language choice implications among Swahili speakers in Oman.  Ethnicities 12(3) 335<U+2013>353, http://etn.sagepub.com/content/12/3/335</ref><ref>Adriaan Hendrik Johan Prins (1961) ''The Swahili-speaking Peoples of [[Zanzibar]] and the East African Coast.'' ''(Ethnologue)''</ref> In the Guthrie non-genetic classification of Bantu languages, Swahili is included under Zone G.

At the present time, some 90 percent of approximately 39 million Tanzanians speak Swahili in addition to their first languages.<ref>Brock-Utne 2001: 123</ref> Kenya's population is comparable as well, with a greater part of the nation being able to speak Swahili. Most educated Kenyans are able to communicate  fluently in Swahili, since it is a compulsory subject in school from grade one to high school and a distinct academic discipline in many of the public and private universities.

The five eastern provinces of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] are Swahili-speaking. Nearly half the 66 million Congolese reportedly speak it,<ref>{{cite news |first=Juakali |last=Kambale |title=DRC welcomes Swahili as an official AU language |url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=134530&area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__africa/ |work=Mail & Guardian |date=2004-08-10 |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> and it is starting to rival [[Lingala]] as the most important national language of that country.

In Uganda, the [[Baganda]] and residents of [[Buganda]] generally do not speak Swahili, but it is in common use among the 25 million people elsewhere in the country and is currently being implemented in schools nationwide in preparation for the [[East African Community]].

The usage of Swahili in other countries is commonly overstated, being widespread only in market towns, among returning refugees, or near the borders of Kenya and Tanzania. Even so, Swahili speakers may number some  120 to 150 million people.<ref>(2005 World Bank Data).</ref> Many of the world's institutions have responded to Swahili's growing prominence.

== Name ==
''Kiswahili'' is the Swahili word for the  language, and this is also sometimes used in English. The name ''Kiswahili'' comes from the plural ''saw<U+0101><U+1E25>il'' ({{lang|ar|<U+0633><U+0648><U+0627><U+062D><U+0644>}}) of the Arabic word ''s<U+0101><U+1E25>il'' ({{lang|ar|<U+0633><U+0627><U+062D><U+0644>}}), meaning "boundary" or "coast", used as an adjective meaning "coastal dwellers". With the prefix ''ki-'', it means "coastal language", ''ki-'' being a [[affix|prefix]] attached to [[noun]]s of the [[#Noun classes|noun class]] that includes languages.

== Phonology ==
Swahili is unusual among African languages in having lost the feature of [[Tone (linguistics)|lexical tone]] (with the exception of the numerically important Mvita dialect, the dialect of Kenya's second city, the Indian Ocean port of [[Mombasa]]).{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}

=== Vowels ===
Standard Swahili has five vowel [[phoneme]]s: {{IPA|/<U+0251>/}}, {{IPA|/<U+025B>/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/<U+0254>/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}. The pronunciation of the phoneme /u/ stands between [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] [u] and [o]. Vowels are never [[vowel reduction|reduced]], regardless of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. The vowels are pronounced as follows:
* {{IPA|/<U+0251>/}} is pronounced like the "a" in ''father''
* {{IPA|/<U+025B>/}} is pronounced like the "e" in ''bed''
* {{IPA|/i/}} is pronounced like the "i" in ''ski''
* {{IPA|/<U+0254>/}} is pronounced like the "o" in "cord"
* {{IPA|/u/}} is pronounced like the "u" in "rule".

Swahili has no [[diphthong]]s; in vowel combinations, each letter is pronounced separately. Therefore, the Swahili word for "leopard", ''chui'', is pronounced {{IPA|/t<U+0283>u.i/}}; that is, as two syllables.

Notes:
* The nasal stops are pronounced as separate syllables when they appear before a [[Homorganic consonants|heterorganic]] plosive ''(e.g. mtoto'' {{IPA|/m.<U+02C8>to.to/}} 'child') or represent a separate morpheme ''(e.g. nilimpiga'' {{IPA|/ni.li.'''m'''.<U+02C8>pi.<U+0260>a/}} 'I hit '''him''''), and prenasalized stops are decomposed into two syllables when the word would otherwise have one (e.g. ''mbwa'' {{IPA|/<U+02C8>m.bwa/}} 'dog'). However, elsewhere this doesn't happen: ''ndizi'' ('banana') has two syllables, {{IPA|/<U+02C8>ndi.zi/}}, as does ''nenda'' {{IPA|/<U+02C8>ne.nda/}} (not {{IPA|*/<U+02C8>nen.da/}}) 'go'.
* The fricatives in parentheses, ''th dh kh gh,'' are borrowed from Arabic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Many Swahili speakers pronounce them as {{IPA|/s z h r/}}, respectively.
* Swahili orthography does not distinguish aspirated from [[tenuis consonant]]s. When nouns in the N-class begin with plosives, they are aspirated (''tembo'' {{IPA|/tembo/}} '[[palm wine]]', but ''tembo'' {{IPA|/t<U+02B0>embo/}} 'elephant') in some dialects. Otherwise aspirated consonants are not common.  Some writers mark aspirated consonants with an apostrophe (''t'embo'').{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}
* Swahili ''l'' and ''r'' are merged for many speakers (the extent to which this is demonstrated generally depends on the original mother tongue spoken by the individual), and are often both realized as [[alveolar lateral flap]] {{IPA|/<U+027A>/}}, {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} a sound between a flapped ''r'' and an ''l''.
* After a nasal prefix, ''l/r'' becomes {{IPA|/d/}} and ''w'' becomes {{IPA|/b/}}. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} (See [[fortition]].)

Swahili is currently written in a slightly [[defective script|defective]] alphabet using the [[Latin script]]; the defectiveness comes in not distinguishing aspirated consonants, though those are not distinguished in all dialects. (These were, however, distinguished as ''kh'' etc. in the old German colonial Latin alphabet.) There are two [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] for native sounds, ''ch'' and ''sh''; ''c'' is not used apart from unassimilated English loans and occasionally as a substitute for ''k'' in advertisements. There are in addition several digraphs for Arabic sounds which are not distinguished in pronunciation outside of traditional Swahili areas.

The language had previously been written in the [[Arabic script]]. Unlike adaptations of the Arabic script for other languages, relatively little accommodation was made for Swahili. There were also differences in orthographic conventions between cities, authors, and over the centuries, some quite precise, but others defective enough to cause difficulties with intelligibility.

Vowel diacritics were generally written, effectively making the Swahili-Arabic script an [[abugida]]. /e/ and /i/, /o/ and /u/ were often conflated, but in some orthographies /e/ was distinguished from /i/ by rotating the [[Kasrah|kasra]] 90<U+00B0>, and /o/ from /u/ by writing the [[damma]] backwards.

Several Swahili consonants do not have equivalents in Arabic, and for these often no special letters were created, as they were for example in [[Persian script|Persian]] and [[Urdu script|Urdu]]. Instead, the closest Arabic sound is substituted. Not only does this mean that one letter often stands for more than one sound, writers made different choices as to which consonant to substitute. Some of the equivalents between Arabic Swahili and Roman Swahili are,

This was the general situation, but conventions from Urdu were adopted by some authors; for example, to distinguish aspiration and /p/ from /b/: <U+067E><U+06BE><U+0627> /p<U+02B0>aa/ 'gazelle', <U+067E><U+0627> /paa/ 'roof'. Although not found in Standard Swahili today, there is a distinction between dental and [[alveolar consonant]]s in some dialects, and this is reflected in some orthographies, for example in <U+0643><U+064F><U+0679><U+064E> ''-kuta'' 'to meet' vs. <U+0643><U+064F><U+062A><U+064E> ''-kut<U+0320>a'' 'to be satisfied'. A ''k'' with the dots of ''y'', <U+06B1>, was used for ''ch'' in some conventions; this ''ky'' is historically and even contemporaneously a more accurate transcription than Roman ''ch''. In Mombasa, it was common to use the Arabic emphatics for Cw, for example in <U+0635><U+0650><U+0635><U+0650> ''swiswi'' (standard ''sisi'') 'we' and <U+0643><U+0650><U+0637><U+064E> ''kit<U+0320>wa'' (standard ''kichwa'') 'head'.

Word division differs from Roman norms. Particles such as ''ya, na, si, kwa, ni'' are joined to the following noun, and possessives such as ''yangu'' and ''yako'' are joined to the preceding noun, but verbs are written as two words, with the subject and [[tense<U+2013>aspect<U+2013>mood]] morphemes separated from the object and root, as in ''aliye niambia'' "he who asked me".<ref>Jan Knappert (1971) ''Swahili Islamic poetry'', Volume 1</ref>

== Noun classes {{anchor|Noun classes}} ==
In common with all [[Bantu languages]], Swahili [[grammar]] arranges nouns into a number of [[noun class|classes]]. The ancestral system had 22 classes (counting singular and plural separately, according to the [[Carl Meinhof|Meinhof]] convention), with most Bantu languages sharing at least ten of these. Swahili employs sixteen: six classes that usually indicate singular nouns, five classes that usually indicate plural nouns, a class for abstract nouns, a class for verbal infinitives used as nouns, and three classes to indicate location.

Nouns beginning with ''m-'' in the singular and ''wa-'' in the plural denote animate beings, especially people. Examples are ''mtu'', meaning 'person' (plural ''watu''), and ''mdudu'', meaning 'insect' (plural ''wadudu''). A class with ''m-'' in the singular but ''mi-'' in the plural often denotes plants, such as  ''mti'' 'tree', ''miti'' trees. The [[infinitive]] of verbs begins with ''ku-'', e.g. ''kusoma'' 'to read'. Other classes are more difficult to categorize. Singulars beginning in ''ki-'' take plurals in ''vi-''; they often refer to hand tools and other artefacts. This ''ki-/vi-'' alteration even applies to foreign words where the ''ki-'' was originally part of the root, so ''vitabu'' "books" from ''kitabu'' "book" (from Arabic ''kit<U+0101>b'' "book"; similar to how Arabic itself deals with the name [[Alexandria]]). This class also contains languages (such as the name of the language ''Kiswahili''), and [[diminutive]]s, which had been a separate class in earlier stages of Bantu. Words beginning with ''u-'' are often abstract, with no plural, e.g. ''utoto'' 'childhood'.

A fifth class begins with ''n-'' or ''m-'' or nothing, and its plural is the same. Another class has ''ji-'' or no prefix in the singular, and takes ''ma-'' in the plural; this class is often used for [[augmentative]]s. When the noun itself does not make clear which class it belongs to, its concords do. Adjectives and numerals commonly take the noun prefixes, and verbs take a different set of prefixes.

The same noun root can be used with different noun-class prefixes for derived meanings: human ''mtoto (watoto)'' "child (children)", abstract ''utoto'' "childhood", diminutive ''kitoto (vitoto)'' "infant(s)", augmentative ''toto (matoto)'' "big child (children)". Also vegetative ''mti (miti)'' "tree(s)", artefact ''kiti (viti)'' "chair(s)", augmentative ''jiti (majiti)'' "large tree", ''kijiti (vijiti)'' "stick(s)", ''ujiti (njiti)'' "tall slender tree".

=== Semantic motivation ===
Although the Swahili noun-class system is technically [[grammatical gender]], there is a difference from the grammatical gender of European languages: In Swahili, the class assignments of nouns is still largely [[semantics|semantically]] motivated, whereas the European systems are mostly arbitrary. However, the classes cannot be understood as simplistic categories such as 'people' or 'trees'. Rather, there are extensions of meaning, words similar to those extensions, and then extensions again from these. The end result is a semantic net that made sense at one time, and often still does make sense, but which can be confusing to a non-speaker.<ref>Contini-Morava (1994)</ref>

Take the ''ki-/vi-'' class. Originally it was two separate genders, artefacts (Bantu class 7/8, utensils and hand tools mostly) and diminutives (Bantu class 12), that were conflated at a stage ancestral to Swahili. Examples of the first are ''kisu'' "knife", ''kiti'' "chair" (from ''mti'' "tree, wood"), ''chombo'' "vessel" (a contraction of ''ki-ombo''). Examples of the latter are ''kitoto'' "infant", from ''mtoto'' "child"; ''kitawi'' "frond", from ''tawi'' "branch"; and ''chumba'' (''ki-umba'') "room", from ''nyumba'' "house". It is the diminutive sense that has been furthest extended. An extension common to diminutives in many languages is ''approximation'' and ''resemblance'' (having a 'little bit' of some characteristic, like ''-y'' or ''-ish'' in English). For example, there is ''kijani'' "green", from ''jani'' "leaf" (compare English 'leafy'), ''kichaka'' "bush" from ''chaka'' "clump", and ''kivuli'' "shadow" from ''uvuli'' "shade". A 'little bit' of a verb would be an instance of an action, and such ''instantiations'' (usually not very active ones) are found: ''kifo'' "death", from the verb ''-fa'' "to die"; ''kiota'' "nest" from ''-ota'' "to brood"; ''chakula'' "food" from ''kula'' "to eat"; ''kivuko'' "a ford, a pass" from ''-vuka'' "to cross"; and ''kilimia'' "the [[Pleiades]]", from ''-limia'' "to farm with", from its role in guiding planting. A resemblance, or being a bit like something, implies marginal status in a category, so things that are marginal examples of their class may take the ''ki-/vi-'' prefixes. One example is ''chura'' (''ki-ura'') "frog", which is only half terrestrial and therefore marginal as an animal. This extension may account for disabilities as well: ''kilema'' "a cripple", ''kipofu'' "a blind person", ''kiziwi'' "a deaf person". Finally, diminutives often denote contempt, and contempt is sometimes expressed against things that are dangerous. This might be the historical explanation for ''kifaru'' "rhinoceros", ''kingugwa'' "spotted hyena", and ''kiboko'' "hippopotamus" (perhaps originally meaning "stubby legs").

Another class with broad semantic extension is the ''m-/mi-'' class (Bantu classes 3/4). This is often called the 'tree' class, because ''mti, miti'' "tree(s)" is the prototypical example. However, it seems to cover vital entities which are neither human nor typical animals: trees and other plants, such as ''mwitu'' 'forest' and ''mtama'' 'millet' (and from there, things made from plants, like ''mkeka'' 'mat'); supernatural and natural forces, such as ''mwezi'' 'moon', ''mlima'' 'mountain', ''mto'' 'river'; active things, such as ''moto'' 'fire', including active body parts (''moyo'' 'heart', ''mkono'' 'hand, arm'); and human groups, which are vital but not themselves human, such as ''mji'' 'village', and, by analogy, ''mzinga'' 'beehive/cannon'. From the central idea of ''tree'', which is thin, tall, and spreading, comes an extension to other long or extended things or parts of things, such as ''mwamvuli'' 'umbrella', ''moshi'' 'smoke', ''msumari'' 'nail'; and from activity there even come active instantiations of verbs, such as ''mfuo'' "metal forging", from ''-fua'' "to forge", or ''mlio'' "a sound", from ''-lia'' "to make a sound". Words may be connected to their class by more than one metaphor. For example, ''mkono'' is an active body part, and ''mto'' is an active natural force, but they are also both long and thin. Things with a trajectory, such as ''mpaka'' 'border' and ''mwendo'' 'journey', are classified with long thin things, as in many other languages with noun classes. This may be further extended to anything dealing with time, such as ''mwaka'' 'year' and perhaps ''mshahara'' 'wages'. Animals which are exceptional in some way and therefore do not fit easily in the other classes may be placed in this class.

The other classes have foundations that may at first seem similarly counterintuitive.<ref>See Contini-Morava for details.</ref> In short,
* Classes 1<U+2013>2 include most words for people: kin terms, professions, ethnicities, etc., including translations of most English words ending in ''-er.'' They include a couple generic words for animals: ''mnyama'' 'beast', ''mdudu'' 'bug'.
* Classes 5<U+2013>6 have a broad semantic range of groups, expanses, and augmentatives. Although interrelated, it is easier to illustrate if broken down:
** Augmentatives, such as ''joka'' 'serpent' from ''nyoka'' 'snake', lead to titles and other terms of respect (the opposite of diminutives, which lead to terms of contempt): ''Bwana'' 'Sir', ''shangazi'' 'aunt', ''fundi'' 'craftsman', ''kadhi'' 'judge'.
** Expanses: ''ziwa'' 'lake', ''bonde'' 'valley', ''taifa'' 'country', ''anga'' 'sky'
*** from this, mass nouns: ''maji'' 'water', ''vumbi'' 'dust' (and other liquids and fine particulates which may cover broad expanses), ''kaa'' 'charcoal', ''mali'' 'wealth', ''maridhawa'' 'abundance'
** Collectives: ''kundi'' 'group', ''kabila'' 'ethnic group', ''jeshi'' 'army', ''daraja'' 'stairs', ''manyoya'' 'fur, feathers', ''mapesa'' 'small change', ''manyasi'' 'weeds', ''jongoo'' 'millipede' (large set of legs), ''marimba'' 'xylophone' (large set of keys)
*** from this, individual things found in groups: ''jiwe'' 'stone', ''tawi'' 'branch', ''ua'' 'flower', ''tunda'' 'fruit' (also the names of most fruits), ''yai'' 'egg', ''mapacha'' 'twins', ''jino'' 'tooth', ''tumbo'' 'stomach' (cf. English "guts"), and paired body parts such as ''jicho'' 'eye', ''bawa'' 'wing', etc.
*** also collective or dialogic actions, which occur among groups of people: ''neno'' 'a word', from ''kunena'' 'to speak' (and by extension, mental verbal processes: ''wazo'' 'thought', ''maana'' 'meaning'); ''pigo'' 'a stroke, blow', from ''kupiga'' 'to hit'; ''gomvi'' 'a quarrel', ''shauri'' 'advice, plan', ''kosa'' 'mistake', ''jambo'' 'affair', ''penzi'' 'love', ''jibu'' 'answer', ''agano'' 'promise', ''malipo'' 'payment'
*** From pairing, reproduction is suggested as another extension (fruit, egg, testicle, flower, twins, etc.), but these generally duplicate one or more of the subcategories above
* Classes 9<U+2013>10 are used for most typical animals: ''ndege'' 'bird', ''samaki'' 'fish', and the specific names of typical beasts, birds, and bugs. However, this is the 'other' class, for words which don't fit in well elsewhere, and about half of the class 9<U+2013>10 nouns are foreign loanwords. Loans may be classified as 9<U+2013>10 because they lack the prefixes inherent in other classes, and most native class 9<U+2013>10 nouns have no prefix. Thus they do not form a coherent semantic class, though there are still semantic extensions from individual words.
* Class 11 (which takes class 10 for the plural) are mostly nouns with an "extended outline shape", in either one dimension or two:
** mass nouns which are generally localized rather than covering vast expanses: ''uji'' 'porridge', ''wali'' 'cooked rice'
** broad: ''ukuta'' 'wall', ''ukucha'' 'fingernail', ''upande'' 'side' (<U+2248> ''ubavu'' 'rib'), ''wavu'' 'net', ''wayo'' 'sole, footprint', ''ua'' 'fence, yard', ''uteo'' 'winnowing basket',
** long: ''utambi'' 'wick', ''utepe'' 'stripe', ''uta'' 'bow', ''ubavu'' 'rib', ''ufa'' 'crack', ''unywele'' 'a hair'
*** from 'a hair', [[singulative]]s of nouns, which are often class 6 ('collectives') in the plural: ''unyoya'' 'a feather', ''uvumbi'' 'a grain of dust', ''ushanga'' 'a bead'
* Class 14 are abstractions, such as ''utoto'' 'childhood' (from ''mtoto'' 'a child') and have no plural. They have the same prefixes and concord as class 11, except optionally for adjectival concord.
* Class 15 are verbal infinitives.
* Classes 16<U+2013>18 are locatives. The Bantu nouns of these classes have been lost; the only permanent member is the Arabic loan ''mahali'' 'place(s)'. (Though in Mombasa Swahili, the old prefixes survive: ''pahali'' 'place', ''mwahali'' 'places'.) However, any noun with the locative suffix ''-ni'' takes class 16<U+2013>18 agreement. The distinction between them is that class 16 agreement is used if the location is intended to be definite ("at"), class 17 if indefinite ("around") or involves motion ("to, toward"), and class 18 if it involves containment ("within"): ''mahali pazuri'' 'a good spot', ''mahali kuzuri'' 'a nice area', ''mahali muzuri'' (it's nice in there).

== Verb affixation ==
Swahili [[verb]]s consist of a [[Root (linguistics)|root]] and a number of affixes (mostly prefixes) which can be attached to express grammatical persons, [[Grammatical tense|tense]], and [[subordinate clause]]s, which require a [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] in languages such as English.

Verbs of Bantu origin end in '-a' in the [[indicative mood|indicative]]. This vowel changes to indicate the subjunctive and negation.

In most [[dictionary|dictionaries]], verbs are listed in their indicative root form, for example ''-kata'' meaning 'to cut/chop'. In a simple sentence, prefixes for grammatical tense and person are added, as ''ninakata'' 'I cut'. Here ''ni-'' means 'I' and ''na-'' indicates a specific time (present tense unless stated otherwise).

=== Verb conjugation ===
:{|
|''ni-''||''-na-''||''kata''
|-
|1sg||DEF. TIME||cut/chop
|}
:'I am cutting (it)'

This sentence can be modified either by changing the subject prefix or the tense prefix, for example:

:{|
|''u-''||''-na-''||''kata''
|-
|2sg||DEF. TIME||cut/chop
|}
:'You are cutting'

:{|
|''u-''||''-me-''||''kata''
|-
|2sg||PERFECT||cut/chop
|}
:'You have cut'

The animate/human subject and object prefixes, with the ''m-/wa-'' (human class) in the third person, is:

<div><!-- The indent on this table propagates through and indents the whole rest of the article without this kluge.  Better fixes? -->
:{|

|-
!3rd
|''-m-''||''-wa-''
|}
|}
</div>

In Standard Swahili, 2pl and 3pl objects are both ''-wa-.'' However, in Nairobi Swahili, 2pl is ''-mu-.''

The most common tense prefixes are:

:{| class=wikitable
|+ Tense and mood prefixes
|''-a-''||gnomic (indefinite time)
|-
|''-na-''||definite time (often present progressive)
|-
|''-me-''||perfect
|-
|''-li-''||past
|-
|''-ta-''||future
|-
|''hu-''||habitual (does not take subject prefix)
|-
|''-ki-''||conditional
|}

The indefinite ([[gnomic tense]]) prefix is used for generic statements such as "birds fly", and the [[vowel]]s of the subject prefixes are assimilated. Thus, ''nasoma'' means 'I read', although colloquially it is also short for ''ninasoma.''

:{| class="wikitable"

|}
:'I read'

:{|
|''{{lang|swa|mwa}}-''||''soma''
|-
|2pl:GNOM||read
|}
:'You (pl) read'

Conditional:
:''ni-ki-nunua nyama ya ng'ombe soko-ni, ni-ta-pika leo.''
:'If I buy cow meat at the market, I'll cook it today.'
The English conjunction 'if' is translated by ''-ki-''.

A third prefix is the object prefix. It is placed just before the root and refers a particular object, either a person, or rather as "the" does in English:

:{|
|''a-''||''na-''||''{{lang|swa|mw}}-''||''ona''
|-
|3sg||DEF.T.||3sg.OBJ||see
|}
:'He (is) see(ing) him/her'

:{|
|''ni-''||''na-''||''{{lang|swa|mw}}-''||''ona''||''mtoto''
|-
|1sg||DEF.T.||3sg.OBJ||see||child
|}
:'I (am) see(ing) ''the'' child'

The ''-a'' suffix listed by dictionaries is the positive indicative mood. Other forms occur with negation and the subjunctive, as in ''sisomi'':

:{|
|''si-''||''som-''||''-i''
|-
|1sg.NEG:PRES||read||NEG
|}
:'I am not reading/ I don't read'

Other instances of this change of the final vowel include the subjunctive in ''-e.'' This goes only for Bantu verbs ending with ''-a''; Arabic-derived verbs do not change their final vowel.

Other suffixes are placed before the end vowel, such as the [[applicative voice|applicative]] ''-i-'' and [[Passive voice|passive]] ''-w-'':
:{|
|''wa-''||''na-''||''pig''||''-w''||''-a''
|-
|3pl||DEF.T.||hit||PASSIVE||IND.
|}
:'They are ''being'' hit'

== Concord ==
Swahili phrases agree with nouns in a system of [[Agreement (linguistics)|concord]], though if the noun refers to a human, they accord with noun classes 1 & 2 regardless of noun class. Verbs agree with the noun class of their subjects and objects; adjectives, prepositions, and demonstratives agree with the noun class of their nouns. In Standard Swahili ''(Kiswahili sanifu)'' which was based on the dialect spoken in Zanzibar the system is rather complex; however, it is drastically simplified in many local variants where Swahili is not the native language, such as in Nairobi.

In places where Standard Swahili is not commonly used, concord reflects only animacy. Human subjects and objects trigger ''a-, wa-'' and ''m-, wa-'' in verbal concord, while non-human subjects and objects<U+2014>of whatever class<U+2014>trigger ''i-, zi-,'' and infinitive verbs vary between standard ''ku-'' and reduced ''i-.''<ref>Kamil Ud Deen, 2005. ''The acquisition of Swahili.''</ref> ("Of" is animate ''wa'' and inanimate ''ya, za.'') In Standard Swahili, human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger animacy concord in ''a-, wa-'' and ''m-, wa-,'' while non-human subjects and objects trigger a variety of gender-concord prefixes.

== Dialects of Swahili and languages closely related to Swahili ==
This list is based on Nurse, Derek, and Hinnebusch, Thomas J. ''Swahili and Sabaki: a linguistic history''.

=== Dialects of Swahili ===
Modern standard Swahili is based on ''Kiunguja,'' the dialect spoken in [[Zanzibar Town|Zanzibar town]].
There are numerous dialects of Swahili, some of which are mutually unintelligible, including the following.<ref>H.E.Lambert 1956, 1957, 1958</ref>

==== Old dialects ====
Maho (2009) considers the following to be distinct languages:
* ''[[Kimwani]]'': spoken in the Kerimba Islands and northern coastal Mozambique.
* ''[[Bravanese dialect|Chimwiini]]'' is spoken by the ethnic minorities in and around the town of [[Barawa]] on the southern coast of Somalia.
* ''[[Kibajuni dialect|Kibajuni]]'': spoken by the [[Bajuni people|Bajuni]] minority ethnic group on the coast and islands on both sides of the Somali<U+2013>Kenyan border and in the [[Bajuni Islands]] (the northern part of the Lamu archipelago). Also called ''Kitikuu'' and ''Kigunya''.
* [[Socotra Swahili]] (extinct)
* [[Sidi language|Sidi]], in Gujarat (extinct)
The rest of the dialects he divides into two groups:
* Mombasa<U+2013>Lamu Swahili
** Lamu
*** ''Kiamu'': spoken in and around the island of [[Lamu]] (Amu).
*** ''Kipate'': local dialect of [[Pate Island]], considered to be closest to the original dialect of Kingozi.
*** ''Kingozi'', an ancient dialect spoken on the Indian Ocean coast between Lamu and Somalia, sometimes still used in poetry. It is often considered the source of Swahili.
** Mombasa
*** ''Chijomvu'': subdialect of the Mombasa area.
*** ''Kimvita'': the major dialect of Mombasa (also known as "Mvita", which means "war", in reference to the many wars which were fought over it), the other major dialect alongside Kiunguja.
*** ''Kingare'': subdialect of the Mombasa area.
** ''Kimrima'': spoken around [[Pangani]], [[Vanga]], [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Rufiji District|Rufiji]] and [[Mafia Island]].
** ''Kiunguja'': spoken in [[Stone Town|Zanzibar City]] and environs on [[Zanzibar|Unguja (Zanzibar) Island]]. Kitumbatu (Pemba) dialects occupy the bulk of the island.
** Mambrui, Malindi
** ''Chichifundi'': dialect of the southern Kenya coast.
** Chwaka
** ''Kivumba'': dialect of the southern Kenya coast.
** Nosse Be (Madagascar)
* Pemba Swahili
** ''Kipemba'': local dialect of the [[Pemba Island]].
** ''Kitumbatu'' and ''Kimakunduchi'': the countryside dialects of the island of Zanzibar. Kimakunduchi is a recent renaming of "Kihadimu"; the old name means "serf", hence it is considered pejorative.
** Makunduchi
** Mafia, Mbwera
** Kilwa (extinct)
** ''Kimgao'': formerly spoken around [[Kilwa District]] and to the south.

Maho, following outdated classifications, incorrectly includes the Comorian dialects as a third group. Comorian is now recognised as a Sabaki language distinct from Swahili

==== Historically recent varieties ====
* ''Kingwanai:'' spoken in the eastern and southern regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
* ''Shaba Swahili'' (Katanga Swahili, Lubumbashi Swahili). Sometimes called ''Copperbelt Swahili''.
* ''[[Sheng language|Sheng]]'': a street [[patois]] that blends Swahili, English, and ethnic languages spoken in and around [[Nairobi]].  Sheng originated in the Nairobi slums and is considered fashionable and cosmopolitan among a growing segment of the population.
* ''[[Engsh]]''
* ''[[Asian Swahili]]'' (Kibabu) and ''[[Cutchi-Swahili]]''
* ''[[Kisetla]]'' (Settler Swahili)
* ''[[Kikeya]]''

=== Other regions ===
In [[Somalia]], where the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[Somali language|Somali]] language predominates, a variant of Swahili referred to as [[Bravanese dialect|Chimwiini]] (also known as Chimbalazi) is spoken along the [[Benadir]] coast by the [[Bravanese people]].<ref name="Ethnolsom">[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=SO Ethnologue report for Somalia]</ref> Another Swahili dialect known as [[Kibajuni dialect|Kibajuni]] also serves as the mother tongue of the [[Bajuni people|Bajuni]] minority ethnic group, the latter of whom inhabit the tiny [[Bajuni Islands]] as well as the southern [[Kismayo]] region.<ref name="Ethnolsom"/><ref name="Godfrey">{{cite book| last = Mwakikagile| first = Godfrey| title = Kenya: identity of a nation| publisher = New Africa Press| year = 2007| page = 102| url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=lsqjN-t6mP4C| isbn = 0-9802587-9-0}}</ref>
