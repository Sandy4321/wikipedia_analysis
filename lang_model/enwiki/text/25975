The '''''F<U+0101>ngy<U+00E1>n''''' ({{zh-cw|c=<U+65B9><U+8A00>|w=''Fang yen''}}; literally meaning "regional speech"), edited by [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]], was the first [[Chinese dictionary]] of dialectal terms. The full title is ''Y<U+00F3>uxu<U+0101>n sh<U+01D0>zh<U+0115> ju<U+00E9>d<U+00E0>i y<U+01D4> sh<U+00EC> bi<U+00E9>gu<U+00F3> f<U+0101>ngy<U+00E1>n'' (<U+8F36><U+8ED2><U+4F7F><U+8005><U+7D55><U+4EE3><U+8A9E><U+91CB><U+5225><U+570B><U+65B9><U+8A00>) "Local speeches of other countries in times immemorial explained by the Light-Carriage Messenger," which alludes to a [[Zhou Dynasty]] tradition of imperial emissaries who made annual surveys of regional vocabulary throughout China. Yang's preface explains that he spent 27 years collating and editing the ''Fangyan'', which has some 9000 characters in 13 chapters (<U+5377>). 

''Fangyan'' definitions typically list regional synonyms. For instance, chapter 8, which catalogs animal names, gives regional words for ''hu'' (<U+864E> "tiger") in Han times. <blockquote> (<U+864E>, <U+9673><U+9B4F><U+5B8B><U+695A><U+4E4B><U+9593><U+6216><U+8B02><U+4E4B><U+674E><U+7236>, <U+6C5F><U+6DEE><U+5357><U+695A><U+4E4B><U+9593><U+8B02><U+4E4B><U+674E><U+8033>, <U+6216><U+8B02><U+4E4B><U+65BC><U+83DF>. <U+81EA><U+95DC><U+6771><U+897F><U+6216><U+8B02><U+4E4B><U+4F2F><U+90FD>.) "Tiger: in the regions of Chen-Wei Song-Chu [Central China], some call it ''lifu''; in the regions of Jiang-Huai Nan-Chu [Southern China], they call it ''li'er'', and some call it ''wutu''. From the Pass, east- and west-ward [Eastern and Western China], some call it also ''bodu''." (adapted from Serruys 1967: 256) </blockquote>

Comparative linguists have used dialect data from the ''Fangyan'' in reconstructing how Chinese was pronounced during the [[1st century]] CE, which is an important diachronic stage between [[Old Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]]. In the above example, Serruys reconstructs "tiger" as Old Chinese *''blx<U+00E2>g''.

The Chinese word ''fangyan'' is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''fang'' [[Wikt:<U+65B9>|<U+65B9>]] "direction; locality; side; place; region; area" and ''yan'' [[Wikt:<U+8A00>|<U+8A00>]] "speech; talk; language; word; saying". ''Fangyan'' semantically ranges across "[[language]]", "[[regional language]]", "[[variety (linguistics)|variety]]", and "[[dialect]]" in [[comparative linguistics]] terminology, which involve criteria of [[mutual intelligibility]], [[vocabulary]], [[idiom]], and [[pronunciation]]. Chinese ''fangyan'' is usually, but problematically, translated as English "dialect". Regarding the differences between ''fangyan'' and ''dialect'', [[Victor H. Mair]] says,
<blockquote>It is no wonder that massive confusion results when one is used as a translational equivalent of the other. The abuse of the word ''fangyan'' in its incorrect English translation as "dialect" has led to extensive misinformation concerning Chinese language(s) in the West. (1991:6) </blockquote>
Two English [[neologisms]] have been coined to remedy this mistranslation of ''fangyan''. [[John DeFrancis]] (1984:57) suggests ''regionalect'' for the mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese, leaving ''dialect'' for the mutually intelligible sub-varieties. Mair (1991:7) suggests ''topolect'', which is fully [[English words of Greek origin|Greek]] in derivation and size-neutral in regard to the speech area. ([[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] includes ''topolect''). Although these ''fangyan'' distinctions may seem like pedantic hair-splitting, this word is crucial in some political, social, and linguistic arguments whether [[Spoken Chinese]] consists of "dialects" or "languages" (see [[Identification of the varieties of Chinese]]). Julie M. Groves (2008) analyzes attitudes among native speakers of Cantonese and [[Putonghua]] whether [[Standard Cantonese]] is a language or a dialect.
