<!-- DEFINITION, SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, COMPLICATIONS -->
'''Lead poisoning''' (also known as '''plumbism''', '''colica pictonium''', '''saturnism''',  [[Devon colic]], or '''painter's colic''')  is a medical condition caused by increased levels of the heavy metal [[lead]] in the blood. Lead interferes with a variety of body processes and is toxic to systems including the [[cardiovascular]], [[Haematopoiesis|hematopoietic]], [[Reproductive system|reproductive]], [[gastrointestinal system|gastrointestinal]], [[renal system|kidney]], and [[nervous system|nervous]] systems.<!--<ref name="Kosnett06-238">[[#CITEREFKosnett06Pois|Kosnett (2006)]] pp.238 </ref> -->  It interferes with the development of the nervous system and is therefore particularly toxic to children, causing potentially permanent learning and behavior disorders.  Symptoms include abdominal pain, headache, [[anemia]], irritability, and in severe cases seizures, coma, and death.  

<!-- EXPOSURE ROUTES, PREVENTION, EPIDEMIOLOGY --> 
Routes of exposure to lead include air, water, soil, food, and consumer products.<ref name="Dart041423">[[#CITEREFDart04|Dart, Hurlbut, Boyer-Hassen (2004)]] pp. 1423</ref>  Occupational exposure is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults.  One of the largest threats to children is [[lead paint]] that exists in many homes, especially older ones; thus children in older housing with chipping paint are at greater risk.  Even an item as small as a paint chip can contain tens to hundreds of milligrams of lead, presenting a serious risk if ingested.  Prevention of lead exposure can range from individual efforts (e.g. removing lead-containing items such as piping or blinds from the home) to nationwide policies (e.g. laws that ban lead in products or reduce allowable levels in water or soil).

<!-- Dx and Rx -->
Elevated lead in the body can be detected by the presence of changes in blood cells visible with a microscope and dense lines in the bones of children seen on X-ray.  However, the main tool for diagnosis is measurement of the [[blood lead level]]; different treatments are used depending on this level.  The major treatments are removal of the source of lead and [[chelation therapy]] (administration of agents that bind lead so it can be excreted). 

<!-- HISTORY --> 
Humans have been mining and using this heavy metal for thousands of years, poisoning themselves in the process.  Although lead poisoning is one of the oldest known work and environmental hazards,<ref name="Flora08"/> the modern understanding of their full extent and the small amount of lead necessary to produce them is relatively recent; blood lead levels once considered safe are now considered hazardous.  No level of lead in the body below which no harm occurs has been discovered.<!--<ref name="Merrill07861"/><ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/>-->

==Classification==
<!-- DEFINITIONS -->
Classically, "lead poisoning" or "lead intoxication" has been defined as exposure to high levels of lead typically associated with severe health effects.<ref name="Grant09-785">[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] pp. 785</ref>  Poisoning is a pattern of symptoms that occur with toxic effects from mid to high levels of exposure; toxicity is a wider spectrum of effects, including [[subclinical]] ones (those that do not cause symptoms).<ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin">{{Cite pmid|17448358 }}</ref>   However, professionals often use "lead poisoning" and "lead toxicity" interchangeably, and official sources do not always restrict the use of "lead poisoning" to refer only to symptomatic effects of lead.<ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin"/>  

The amount of lead in the blood and tissues, as well as the time course of exposure, determine toxicity.<ref name="Pearson03"/> 
<!-- ACUTE VS. CHRONIC -->
Lead poisoning may be acute  (from intense exposure of short duration) or chronic (from repeat low-level exposure over a prolonged period), but the latter is much more common.<ref name="Trevor07-479">[[#CITEREFTrevor07|Trevor, Katzung, Masters (2007)]] pp. 479</ref>  
<!-- BLOOD LEVELS -->
Diagnosis and treatment of lead exposure are based on blood lead level (the amount of lead in the blood), measured in [[microgram]]s of lead per [[deciliter]] of blood (<U+03BC>g/dL).  The US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[World Health Organization]] state that a blood lead level of 10&nbsp;<U+03BC>g/dL or above is a cause for concern; however, lead may impair development and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, and there is no known safe exposure level.<ref name="Rossi09"/><ref name="Barbosa">{{Cite pmid|16330345 }}</ref>  Authorities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics define lead poisoning as blood lead levels higher than 10&nbsp;<U+03BC>g/dL.<ref name="Ragan09-JAAPA"/>

<!-- ORGANIC VS. INORGANIC -->
Lead forms a variety of compounds and exists in the environment in various forms.<ref name="Grant09-761">[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] pp. 761</ref>   Features of poisoning differ depending on whether the agent is an [[organic compound]] (one that contains carbon), or an [[inorganic]] one.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/>  Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, due to the fact that countries across the world have phased out the use of organic [[gasoline#Lead|lead compounds as gasoline additives]], but such compounds continue to be used in industrial settings.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/>  Organic lead compounds, which cross the skin and respiratory tract easily, affect the [[central nervous system]] predominantly.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
<!-- ABOUT S/S -->
Lead poisoning can cause a variety of [[symptom]]s and [[medical sign|signs]] which vary depending on the individual and the duration of lead exposure.<ref name="Karri08"/><ref name="Kosnett05-825"/>  Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, or someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms.<ref name="Mycyk05-463"/>  Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur.<ref name="Dart041426"/>  The delay between exposure and onset of symptoms varies widely depending partly on the individual and intensity and tempo of exposure.<ref name="Kosnett05-825"/>  

<!--
CHILDREN V. ADULTS-->
Symptoms may be different in adults and children; the main symptoms in adults are headache, abdominal pain, muscle weakness, memory loss, kidney failure, male reproductive problems, and weakness, pain, or tingling in the extremities.<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol">{{Cite pmid|17179719 }}</ref>  The classic signs and symptoms in children are loss of appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, constipation, anemia, [[kidney failure]], irritability, [[lethargy]], [[learning disabilities]], and behavior problems.<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/>  Children may also experience [[hearing loss]], delayed growth, drowsiness, clumsiness, or loss of new abilities, especially speech skills.<ref name="Mycyk05-463"/>  Symptoms may appear in children at lower blood lead levels than in adults.<ref name="Marshall08">{{cite book |author = |title= Clinical Chemistry, 6th edition |chapter= Therapeutic drug monitoring and chemical aspects of toxicology |editor= Marshall, W.J.; Bangert, S.K. |year= 2008 |publisher= Elsevier Health Sciences |location= |isbn= 0723434557 |page= 366 }}</ref>

<!--
EARLY SIGNS -->
Early symptoms of lead poisoning in adults are commonly nonspecific and include [[depression (mood)|depression]], loss of appetite, intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and [[myalgia|muscle pain]].<ref name="Merrill07"/>  Other early signs in adults include [[malaise]], fatigue, decreased [[libido]], and problems with sleep.<ref name="Karri08"/>  An unusual taste in the mouth and personality changes are other early signs.<ref name="Patrick06"/> 
<!--
BLL-ASSOCIATED SIGNS -->
In adults, symptoms can occur at levels above 40&nbsp;<U+03BC>g/dL, but are more likely to occur only above 50<U+2013>60&nbsp;<U+03BC>g/dL.<ref name="Karri08"/> Symptoms begin to appear in children generally at around 60&nbsp;<U+03BC>g/dL.<ref name="Needleman04-AnnRev">{{Cite pmid|14746518 }}</ref>  However, the lead levels at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual.<ref name="Bellinger04-Pedi"/>  At blood lead levels between 25 and 60&nbsp;<U+03BC>g/dL, [[neuropsychiatric]] effects such as delayed reaction time, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, as well as slowed [[motor nerve]] conduction and headache can occur.<ref name="Kosnett06-240">[[#CITEREFKosnett06Pois|Kosnett (2006)]] pp.240 </ref>  [[Anemia]] may appear at blood lead levels higher than 50&nbsp;<U+03BC>g/dL.<ref name="Merrill07"/>  In adults, Abdominal [[colic]], involving paroxysms of pain, may appear at blood lead levels greater than 80&nbsp;<U+03BC>g/dL.<ref name="Kosnett05-825">[[#CITEREFKosnett05|Kosnett (2005)]] pp. 825 </ref>  Signs that occur in adults at blood lead levels exceeding 100&nbsp;<U+03BC>g/dL include [[wrist drop]] and [[foot drop]], and signs of [[encephalopathy]] (a condition characterized by [[cerebral edema|brain swelling]]), such as those that accompany increased [[intracranial pressure|pressure within the skull]], [[delirium]], [[coma]], [[seizures]], and [[headache]].<ref name="Henretig061314">[[#CITEREFHenretig06|Henretig (2006)]] pp. 1314</ref>  In children, signs of encephalopathy such as bizarre behavior, discoordination, and apathy occur at lead levels exceeding 70&nbsp;<U+03BC>g/dL.<ref name="Henretig061314"/>  For both adults and children, it is rare to be asymptomatic if blood lead levels exceed 100&nbsp;<U+03BC>g/dL.<ref name="Kosnett05-825"/>

<!-- ORGANIC LEAD -->
Poisoning due to organic lead compounds has symptoms predominantly in the central nervous system, such as [[insomnia]], [[delirium]], [[cognitive deficit]]s, [[tremor]], hallucinations, and convulsions.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/>

===Acute poisoning===
In acute poisoning, typical neurological signs are pain, muscle weakness,  [[paraesthesia]], and, rarely, symptoms associated with [[encephalitis]].<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/> Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> Lead's effects on the mouth include [[astringent|astringency]] and a metallic taste.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> Gastrointestinal problems, such as [[constipation]], [[diarrhea]], [[poor appetite]], or [[weight loss]], are common in acute poisoning.  Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause [[shock (medical)|shock]] due to loss of water from the gastrointestinal tract.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/>  [[Hemolysis]] due to acute poisoning can cause [[anemia]] and [[hemoglobinuria|hemoglobin in the urine]].<ref name="Brunton07-31"/>  Kidney damage can cause changes in urination such as [[oliguria|decreased urine output]].<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> People who survive acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/>

===Chronic poisoning===
Chronic poisoning usually presents with symptoms affecting multiple systems,<ref name="Katzung07-948"/> but is associated with three main types of symptoms: [[gastrointestinal]], [[neuromuscular]], and [[neurological]].<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/>  [[Central nervous system]] and neuromuscular symptoms usually result from intense exposure, while gastrointestinal symptoms usually result from exposure over longer periods.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/>  Signs of chronic exposure include loss of [[short-term memory]] or concentration, [[depression (mood)|depression]], loss of coordination, nausea, abdominal pain, and numbness and tingling in the extremities.<ref name="Patrick06"/>  Fatigue, problems with sleep, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anemia are also found in chronic lead poisoning.<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/>  A "lead hue" of the skin with [[pallor]] is another feature<!--of chronic lead poisoning-->.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005).

==Exposure routes==
<!-- ENVIRONMENT -->
Lead is a common environmental pollutant.<ref name="Ragan09-JAAPA">{{Cite pmid|19697571}}</ref>  Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as is found in plants that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries.<ref name="Ma<U+00F1>ay08"/> Children living near facilities that process lead, such as smelters, have been found to have unusually high blood lead levels.<ref name="Sanborn"/>  In August 2009, parents rioted in China after [[2009 Chinese lead poisoning scandal|lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children]] living near zinc and manganese smelters.<ref name="Watts09-Lancet">{{Cite pmid|19757511}}</ref> Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products.<ref name="Rossi09"/>  

===Occupational exposure===
[[File:Recycling lead in a lead-acid battery recovery facility.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A man in a hard hat with a clear face plate leans over a conveyor belt with a metal instrument. He is in a factory setting with heavy machinery in the background.|Battery recycling workers are at risk for lead exposure.<ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ">{{Cite pmid|17200393 }}</ref>  This worker ladles molten lead into billets in a lead-acid battery recovery facility.]]

In adults, occupational exposure is the main cause of lead poisoning.<ref name="Needleman04-AnnRev"/> People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include [[radiation shield]]s, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes.<ref name="Patrick06"/>  In addition, lead mining and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure.<ref name="Sanborn"/>  Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, [[zinc]] and [[copper]] smelting, processing of [[ore]], combustion of [[solid waste]], and production of paints and pigments.<ref name="Dart041424">[[#CITEREFDart04|Dart, Hurlbut, Boyer-Hassen (2004)]] pp. 1424</ref>  Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children.<ref name="Dart041424"/>

===Paint===
Some lead compounds are bright colors and are used widely in paints,<ref name="Henretig06">[[#CITEREFHenretig06|Henretig (2006)]] pp. 1310</ref> and [[lead paint]] is a major route of lead exposure in children.<ref name="Gilbert06">{{Cite pmid|16889836 }}</ref>  Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil.<ref name="Dart041423"/>  Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning.<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/> Many young children display [[pica]], eating things that are not food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead.<ref name="Kosnett06-241"/>   Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust.<ref name="Chisolm04-222"/>  However, removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching, can create lead-containing dust and fumes.<ref name="Salvato03"/>  Therefore, special precautions must be taken when removing lead paint.<ref name="Salvato03">[[#CITEREFSalvato03|Salvato (2003)]] pp.116 </ref>

Residual lead in soil contributes to lead exposure in urban areas.<ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin"/>  Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline or [[pesticide]]s used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as [[foundry|foundries]] or smelters.<ref name="Woolf07-PedClin"/>  Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have [[gasoline#Lead|leaded gasoline]], it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of [[urban agriculture]];<ref>{{cite news|author=Murphy, K. |date=May 13, 2009 |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/garden/14lead.html?pagewanted=1&hpw |title= For urban gardeners, lead is a concern |publisher=New York Times |accessdate = September 18, 2009}}</ref> eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.<ref name="Yu05-188">[[#CITEREFYu05|Yu (2005)]] pp.188 </ref>  

===Water===
Lead from the atmosphere or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water.<ref name="Yu05">[[#CITEREFYu05|Yu (2005)]] pp.187 </ref>  It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder.<ref name="Chisolm04-222">[[#CITEREFChisolm04|Chisolm  (2004)]] pp. 221<U+2013>22</ref><ref name="Menkes06-703">[[#CITEREFMenkes06|Menkes  (2006)]] pp.703</ref>  Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals can be added to municipal water to increase the [[pH]] and thus reduce the [[Corrosion|corrosivity]] of the public [[water supply]].<ref name="Chisolm04-222"/> [[Chloramine]]s, which were adopted as a substitute for [[chlorine]] [[disinfectant]]s due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity.<ref name="Maas2005" />  In the US, 14<U+2013>20% of total lead exposure is attributed to [[drinking water]].<ref name="Maas2005">{{cite pmid|16134575}}</ref>  In 2004, a team of seven reporters from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' discovered [[Lead contamination in Washington, D.C. drinking water|high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C.]] and won an award for [[investigative reporting]] for a series of articles about this contamination.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alum Wins Investigative Reporting Award with Post Team |publisher=[[University of Maryland College Park|University of Maryland]] |date=February 25, 2005 |url=http://www.journalism.umd.edu/newrel/05newrel/scohen05.html |doi= |accessdate=2007-11-07 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=HONORS |newspaper=The Washington Post |pages= |year= |date=February 23, 2005 |url= }}</ref>

===Lead-containing products===

Lead can be found in products such as [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]], a South Asian cosmetic, and from some toys.<ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin"/>  [[2007 Chinese export recalls|In 2007, millions of toys made in China were recalled]] from multiple countries due to safety hazards including lead paint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/08/14/recall/index.html |author=|title=Mattel CEO: 'Rigorous standards' after massive toy recall|publisher=CNN|date=November 15, 2007|accessdate=September 26, 2009}}</ref>  Vinyl mini-blinds, found especially in older housing, may contain lead.<ref name="Ragan09-JAAPA"/>
<!--
MEDICINE-->
Lead is commonly incorporated into [[herbalism|herbal remedies]] such as Indian [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] preparations and remedies of Chinese origin.<ref name="Karri08"/><ref name="Rossi09"/><ref name="Patrick06"/> There are also risks of elevated blood lead levels caused by folk remedies like ''azarcon'' and ''greta'', which each contain about 95% lead.<ref name="Karri08"/>  
<!--
FOOD -->
Ingestion of metallic lead, such as small lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels and can be fatal.<ref>{{cite pmid|16625019}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|3190952}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|2869380}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|16572103 }}</ref>  Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat.  Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning.<ref name="Salvato03-117"/>  In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead.<ref name="Patrick06"/>  People who eat animals hunted with lead bullets may be at risk for lead exposure.<ref>{{cite pmid|19390698}}</ref>  Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead poisoning,<ref name ="Spitz08-ArqNeruo">{{cite pmid|18813727}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|6859004}}</ref> but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.<ref>{{cite pmid|2926538}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Tera-ethyl-lead-chemical.png|right|thumb|[[Tetra-ethyl lead]], still used as an additive in some fuels, can be absorbed through the skin.<ref name="Patrick06"/> |alt=Two chemical diagrams of tetra-ethyl lead, or (CH3CH2)4Pb. On the left one, carbon and hydrogen are labeled, on the right they are shown as lines only.]]

<!-- MEANS OF ABSORPTION -->
Exposure occurs through [[inhalation]], [[ingestion]] or occasionally skin contact. Lead may be taken in through direct contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through breaks in the skin.  [[Tetra-ethyl lead]], which was a gasoline additive and is still used in fuels such as aviation fuel, passes through the skin; however [[inorganic]] lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin.<ref name="Patrick06"/>  The main sources of absorption of inorganic lead  are from ingestion and inhalation.<ref name="Merrill07">[[#CITEREFMerrill07|Merrill, Morton, Soileau (2007)]] pp. 860</ref>  In adults, about 35<U+2013>40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of that goes into the bloodstream.<ref name="Merrill07"/>  Of ingested inorganic lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with deficiencies of calcium, zinc, or iron.<ref name="Karri08"/> Children and infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children.<ref name="Grant09-767">[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] pp. 767</ref> 

<!--
STORAGE -->
The main body compartments that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life of lead in these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone.<ref name="Karri08"/> Lead in the bones, teeth, hair and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful.<ref name="Rubin08">[[#CITEREFRubin08|Rubin, Strayer (2008)]] pp. 266</ref>  In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health impacts on children.<ref name="Barbosa"/> The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20<U+2013>30&nbsp;years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone.<ref name="Patrick06"/>  The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40&nbsp;days, but it may be longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing [[bone remodeling|remodeling]], which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream.<ref name="Barbosa"/>  Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone.<ref name="Hu07"/> Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.<ref name="Dart041426">[[#CITEREFDart04|Dart, Hurlbut, Boyer-Hassen (2004)]] pp. 1426</ref>  
<!-- 
EXCRETION 
-->It is removed from the body very slowly, mainly through urine.<ref name="Pearson03"/>  Smaller amounts of lead are also eliminated through the feces, and very small amounts in hair, nails, and sweat.<ref name="Kosnett06-238"/>

HARMFUL EFFECTS -->
Lead has no known physiologically relevant role in the body,<ref name="White07">{{Cite pmid|17904601 }}</ref><ref name="Ma<U+00F1>ay08">{{Cite pmid|18418955 }}</ref> and its harmful effects are myriad.  Lead and other heavy metals create reactive [[free radical|radicals]] which damage cell structures including  [[DNA]] and [[cell membrane]]s.<ref name="Flora08">{{Cite pmid|19106443}}</ref>  Lead also interferes with [[Transcription (genetics)|DNA transcription]], [[enzyme]]s that help in the synthesis of [[vitamin D]], and enzymes that maintain the integrity of the [[cell membrane]].<ref name="Dart041426"/> Anemia may result when the cell membranes of [[red blood cell]]s become more fragile as the result of damage to their membranes.<ref name="Yu05-193">[[#CITEREFYu05|Yu (2005)]] pp.193 </ref>  Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth<ref name="Casarett07-946"/> and alters the permeability of blood vessels and [[collagen]] synthesis.<ref name="Needleman04-AnnRev"/>  Lead may also be harmful to the developing [[immune system]], causing production of excessive [[inflammation|inflammatory]] proteins; this mechanism may mean that lead exposure is a risk factor for [[asthma]] in children.<ref name="Casarett07-946">[[#CITEREFCasarett07|Casarett, Klaassen, Doull (2007)]] pp. 946 </ref>  Lead exposure has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as [[polymorphonuclear leukocyte]]s.<ref name="Casarett07-946"/>  Lead also interferes with the normal metabolism of [[calcium in biology|calcium in cells]] and causes it to build up within them.<ref name="Chisolm04-222"/>

===Enzymes===
The primary cause of lead's toxicity is its interference with a variety of enzymes due to the fact that it binds to [[sulfhydryl group]]s found on many enzymes.<ref name="Pearson03"/>  Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as [[cofactor]]s in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act.<ref name="Dart041426"/> Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same [[enzyme]]s as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions.  Among the essential metals with which lead interacts are calcium, iron, and zinc.<ref name="Kosnett06-238">[[#CITEREFKosnett06Pois|Kosnett (2006)]] pp.238 </ref>


<!-- HEME -->
One of the main causes for the pathology of lead is that it interferes with the activity an essential enzyme called [[delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase]], or ALAD, which is important in the biosynthesis of [[heme]], the cofactor found in [[hemoglobin]].<ref name="Patrick06"/>  Lead also inhibits the enzyme [[ferrochelatase]], another enzyme involved in the formation of heme.<ref name="Barbosa"/><ref name="Patrick06"/><ref name="pmid12498316">{{cite journal |author=Fujita H, Nishitani C, Ogawa K |title=Lead, chemical porphyria, and heme as a biological mediator |journal=Tohoku J.

[[Blood film]] examination may reveal [[basophilic stippling]] of red [[blood cells]] (dots in red blood cells visible through a microscope),  as well as the changes normally associated with iron-deficiency anemia ([[microcytosis]] and [[hypochromic|hypochromasia]]).<ref name="Patrick06"/><ref name="Rubin08-267"/> However, basophilic stippling is also seen in unrelated conditions, such as megaloblastic anemia caused by [[vitamin]] B12 (colbalamin) and [[folate]] deficiencies.<ref>{{cite book |author=Fischer C |title=Kaplan Medical USMLE Steps 2 and 3 Notes: Internal Medicine, Hematology |pages=176<U+2013>177 |year=2007}}</ref>

Exposure to lead also can be evaluated by measuring [[zinc protoporphyrin|erythrocyte protoporphyrin]] (EP) in blood samples.<ref name="Patrick06"/> EP is a part of red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks.<ref name="Kosnett05-825"/>  Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent.<ref name="Kosnett05-825"/><ref name="Kosnett06-240"/>  However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35&nbsp;<U+03BC>g/dL.<ref name="Patrick06"/>  Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in [[iron deficiency]], use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.<ref name="Grant09-784">[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] pp. 784</ref>

In most cases, lead poisoning is preventable;<ref name="Sanborn">{{cite pmid|12041847}}</ref>  the way to prevent it is to prevent exposure to lead.<ref name="Rossi09"/>  Prevention strategies can be divided into individual (measures taken by a family), preventive medicine (identifying and intervening with high-risk individuals), and public health (reducing risk on a population level).<ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin"/>

Recommended steps by individuals to reduce the blood lead levels of children include increasing their frequency of hand washing and their intake of calcium and iron, discouraging them from putting their hands to their mouths, vacuuming frequently, and eliminating the presence of lead-containing objects such as blinds and jewelery in the house.<ref name="Payne08"/>  In houses with lead pipes or plumbing solder, these can be replaced.<ref name="Payne08"/>  Less permanent but cheaper methods include running water in the morning to flush out the most contaminated water, or adjusting the water's chemistry to prevent corrosion of pipes.<ref name="Payne08"/> Lead testing kits are commercially available for detecting the presence of lead in the household.<ref name="Salvato03-117">[[#CITEREFSalvato03|Salvato (2003)]] pp.117 </ref>

Screening is an important method in preventive medicine strategies.<ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin"/>  Screening programs exist to test the blood of children at high risk for lead exposure, such as those who live near lead-related industries.<ref name="Mycyk05-463"/>

Prevention measures also exist on national and municipal levels.

<!--DEFINITION-->
A chelating agent is a molecule with at least two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead.<ref name="Trevor07-480">[[#CITEREFTrevor07|Trevor, Katzung, Masters (2007)]] pp. 480</ref> The [[chelate]] that is thus formed is nontoxic<ref name="Lightfoot08-VetClin"/>  and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate.<ref name="Kosnett05-822">[[#CITEREFKosnett05|Kosnett (2005)]] pp. 822 </ref>  The chelating agents used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium ([[EDTA|CaNa<sub>2</sub>EDTA]]), [[dimercaprol]] (BAL), which are injected, and  [[Dimercaptosuccinic acid|succimer]] and d-[[penicillamine]], which are administered orally.<ref name="Menkes06">[[#CITEREFMenkes06|Menkes  (2006)]] pp.706</ref> 
<!-- 
INDICATIONS 
-->
[[Chelation therapy]] is used in cases of acute lead poisoning,<ref name="Patrick06">{{Cite pmid|16597190 }}</ref> severe poisoning, and encephalopathy,<ref name="Olson07"/> and is considered for people with blood lead levels above 25&nbsp;<U+00B5>g/dL.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/>   While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/>  Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead.<ref name="Meyer08-MutatRes">{{Cite pmid|18436472 }}</ref>  Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms go away or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/>   When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone;<ref name="Katzung07-948"/> thus repeated treatments are often necessary.<ref name="Needleman04-AnnRev"/>  
<!-- 
SIDE EFFECTS 
-->Chelating agents can have [[adverse medical effect|adverse effects]];<ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/>  for example, chelation therapy can lower the body's levels of necessary nutrients like zinc.<ref name="Lightfoot08-VetClin"/> Chelating agents taken orally can increase the body's absorption of lead through the intestine.<ref name="Pearson03-370"/>

<!--
CHELATION CHALLENGE
-->
Chelation challenge, also known as provocation testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead.<ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/> This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine.<ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/>  Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred.<ref>{{cite pmid|7697134}}</ref>  Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, and may not accurately reflect long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/>  Although the technique has been used to determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, evidence does not support either of these uses because levels after chelation are not comparable to those in the general population.<ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/>

==Prognosis==

Although regulation reducing lead in products has greatly reduced exposure in the developed world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries.<ref name="Pokras08-Ecohealth"/> In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply.<ref name="Meyer08-MutatRes"/>  However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline,<ref name="Payne08"/> which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries.<ref name="Meyer-IntJHyge"/>  Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning.<ref name="Meyer-IntJHyge">{{Cite pmid|12971691 }}</ref>  Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 <U+03BC>g/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33<U+2013>34%.<ref name="Payne08"/>  About one fifth of the world's [[disease burden]] from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.<ref name="Payne08"/> 

<!-- 
RACE AND SES -->
In developed countries, nonwhite people with low levels of education living in poorer areas are most at risk for elevated lead.<ref name="Pokras08-Ecohealth"/>  In the US, the groups most at risk for lead exposure are the impoverished, city-dwellers, and immigrants.<ref name="Cleveland08">{{Cite pmid|18827541 }}</ref> African-American children and those living in old housing have also been found to be at elevated risk for high blood lead levels in the US.<ref name="Jones09">{{Cite pmid|19254973 }}</ref>  Low-income people often live in old housing with lead paint, which may begin to peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust.  

<!-- RISK FACTORS -->
Risk factors for elevated lead exposure include alcohol consumption and smoking (possibly because of contamination of tobacco leaves with lead-containing pesticides).<ref name="Hu07"/>  Adults with certain risk factors might be more susceptible to toxicity; these include calcium and iron deficiencies, old age, disease of organs targeted by lead (e.g. the brain, the kidneys), and possibly genetic susceptibility.<ref name="Kosnett07EnvironHealthPers"/>  <!--
SEX -->
Differences in vulnerability to lead-induced neurological damage between males and females have also been found, but some studies have found males to be at greater risk, while others have found females to be.<ref name="Bellinger04-Pedi"/>

<!-- AGE -->
In adults, blood lead levels steadily increase with increasing age.<ref name="Rossi09"/>  In adults of all ages, men have higher blood lead levels than women do.<ref name="Rossi09"/>  Children are more sensitive to elevated blood lead levels than adults are.<ref name="Murata">{{Cite pmid|18987427}}</ref>  Children may also have a higher intake of lead than adults; they breathe faster and may be more likely to have contact with and ingest soil.<ref name="Dart041423"/> Children ages one to three tend to have the highest blood lead levels, possibly because at that age they begin to walk and explore their environment, and they use their mouths in their exploration.<ref name="Bellinger04-Pedi"/>  Blood levels usually peak at about 18<U+2013>24&nbsp;months old.<ref name="Pearson03"/> In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.<ref name="Dart041423"/>

In 17th-century [[Germany]], the physician [[Eberhard Gockel]] discovered lead-contaminated wine to be the cause of an epidemic of [[colic]].<ref name="Eisinger-colic" /> He had noticed that monks who did not drink wine were healthy, while wine drinkers developed colic,<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/> and traced the cause to sugar of lead, made by simmering [[litharge]] with vinegar.<ref name="Eisinger-colic" /> As a result, [[Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of W<U+00FC>rttemberg]] issued an edict in 1696 banning the adulteration of wines with litharge.<ref name="Eisinger-colic">{{Cite pmid|6750289}} </ref>

In 18th-century [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], lead poisoning was fairly frequent on account of the widespread drinking of [[rum]], which was made in [[still]]s with a lead component (the "worm").<ref>{{cite book |author=Brands, H.

<!-- 19TH AND 20TH CENTURIES -->
With the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th&nbsp;century, lead poisoning became common in the work setting.<ref name="Henretig06"/>  The introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th&nbsp;century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millenia before this, most lead exposure had been occupational.<ref name="Bellinger04-Pedi"/> An important step in the understanding of childhood lead poisoning occurred when toxicity from lead paint was recognized in Australia in 1897.<ref name="Henretig06"/>  France, Belgium and Austria banned white-lead interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922.<ref name="Gilbert06"/> However, in the US, laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978.<ref name="Gilbert06"/>

The 20th&nbsp;century saw an increase in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal.<ref name="Grant09-757">[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] pp. 757</ref> Beginning in the 1920s, [[Gasoline#Lead|lead was added to gasoline]] to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust still exists in dust in buildings and in soil.<ref name="Rossi09"/>  Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out.<ref name="Rossi09"/>  In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned leaded gasoline additives, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.<ref name="Mycyk05-467">[[#CITEREFMycyk05|Mycyk, Hryhorczuk, Amitai (2005)]] pp. 467</ref>

==In other species==
Humans are not alone in suffering from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species.<ref name="Yu05-188"/>  Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral [[neuropathy]], and behavioral changes such as increased aggression.<ref name="Pokras08-Ecohealth"/>  Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies.<ref name="Bellinger04-Pedi"/>  Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents,<ref name="Redig08">{{Cite pmid|18406387 }}</ref> and to provide information the pathophysiology lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.<ref name="Grant09-768-71">[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] pp. 768, 771, 774</ref>  

Farm animals such as cows and horses<ref name="Neathery">{{cite pmid|1107364}}</ref> as well as pet animals are also susceptible to the effects of lead toxicity.<ref name="Lightfoot08-VetClin"/>  Sources of lead exposure in pets can be the same as those that present health threats to humans sharing the environment, such as paint and blinds, and there is sometimes lead in toys made for pets.<ref name="Lightfoot08-VetClin"/>  Lead poisoning in a pet dog may indicate that children in the same household are at increased risk for elevated lead levels.<ref name="Pokras08-Ecohealth"/>

The [[Critically endangered species|critically endangered]] [[California Condor]] has also been affected by lead poisoning.
