'''The Casbah Coffee Club''' was a [[rock and roll music]] venue in [[West Derby]], [[Liverpool]], started by [[Mona Best]] in 1959 in the cellar of the family home.<ref name="ForthlinRoad">{{cite web |url=http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=8+Hayman's+Green,+&sll=54.162434,-3.647461&sspn=17.81631,31.289063&ie=UTF8&ll=53.431807,-2.911634&spn=0.017642,0.030556&t=p&z=15&iwloc=addr&om=1 |title=8 Hayman<U+2019>s Green  |publisher=[[Google Maps]] UK |accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> The Casbah, as it became widely known, was planned as a members-only club for Best's sons [[Pete Best|Pete]], his younger brother, Rory, and their friends.<ref name="BillboardPeteBestBiog"/>

[[The Quarrymen]]<U+2014>[[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Ken Brown (guitarist)|Ken Brown]]<U+2014>often played at The Casbah as other venues, like the [[The Cavern Club]], had a [[jazz]]-only policy at that time. The cellar<U+2014>with its original decoration<U+2014>still exists. 

In 2006, the property was accorded a [[Grade II]] Heritage listing, and has been opened as a tourist attraction in Liverpool, along with McCartney and Lennon's previous homes.<ref name="nationaltrust">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-20forthlinroadallerton/w-20forthlinroadallerton-seeanddo.htm |title=Photo of Forthlin Road |publisher=The National Trust |accessdate=2007-12-20|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071118022334/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-20forthlinroadallerton/w-20forthlinroadallerton-seeanddo.htm |archivedate = November 18, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

== History ==
Mona Shaw was born on 3 January 1924, in [[Delhi]], and married John Best in India before moving with him and their two children, Pete Best (b.1941) and Rory Best (b.1944) back to Liverpool in 1945, where they lived in various houses.<ref name="BestRoagPetep12">Best, Best & Best (2003) p12</ref> After moving to Queenscourt Road in 1948<U+2014>where the Bests lived for nine years<U+2014>Mona was told by Rory about a large Victorian house for sale at 8 Hayman's Green, in 1954. The Best family claim that Mona then pawned all her jewellery and placed a bet on a horse that was ridden by [[Lester Piggott]] in the 1954 [[Epsom Derby]] called, "Never Say Die", which won at 33-1, and used her winnings to buy the house in 1957.<ref name="BestHappyMan">{{cite web |first=Ray |last=Connolly |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=447201&in_page_id=1773 |title=Pete Best is a happy man |publisher=Daily Mail |date=2007-04-07 |accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> To place the bet, Mona would have had to travel more than 220 miles from Liverpool to [[Epsom]] (as bets were only allowed at race tracks at the time) or placed the bet with an illegal [[bookmaker]] in Liverpool.<ref name=" Corporate History ">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://miranda.hemscott.com/servlet/HsPublic?context=ir.static.jsp&client=wmh&path=util&service=getPage&page=corporate_history&rightnav=nav_history |title=Corporate History |publisher=Miranda Hemscott |accessdate=2008-09-05}}</ref> The house had previously been owned by the West Derby [[Association of Conservative Clubs|Conservative Club]], and was unlike many other family dwellings in Liverpool, as the house (built around 1860 by an unknown architect) was set back from the road, had 15 bedrooms and an [[acre]] of land.<ref name="BestRoagPetep16">Best, Best & Best (2003) p16</ref> All the rooms were painted dark green or brown, the garden was totally overgrown, and the cellar was used for storing coal.<ref name="Spitzp161">Spitz (2005) p161</ref><ref name="MilesPage57">Miles (1997) p57</ref>

Mona came up with the idea of the club after watching a TV report about [[The 2i's Coffee Bar]] in [[London]]'s [[Soho]] where several singers had been discovered. She decided to open the club, which was located in her cellar, on 29 August 1959, for her sons, their friends and young people to meet and listen to the popular music of the day, unlike The Cavern Club, which had a jazz-only policy at that time.<ref name="BillboardPeteBestBiog">{{cite web |first=Sean |last=Egan |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1713012 |title=New Book Chronicles Pete Best's Beatles Adventures |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |date=2002-10-25 |accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref><ref name="MaxwellEdisonCasbah">{{cite web |first=David |last=Holmes |url=http://maxwelledison.blogspot.com/2005_10_16_maxwelledison_archive.html  |title= Best to play in What Cheer |publisher= WalrusGumboot Beatle News |date=2005-10-22 |accessdate=2007-12-20|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070915010008/http://maxwelledison.blogspot.com/2005_10_16_maxwelledison_archive.html |archivedate = September 15, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Mona charged [[half a crown]] annually for membership<U+2014>to "keep out the rough elements"<U+2014>and served soft drinks, snacks, cakes, and coffee from an [[espresso machine]], which no other club had at that time.<ref name="Spitzp160">Spitz (2005) p160</ref><ref name="Liverpoolcradle">{{cite web |first=Vanessa |last=Thorpe |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,780459,00.html |title=Beatles' Liverpool cradle will rock once again |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |date=2002-08-25 |accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> Records were played on a small [[Dansette]] record player, which amplified them through a [[inch|3"]] speaker.<ref name="Dansette">{{cite web |url=http://www.casbahcoffeeclub.com/default.asp?section=3,1 |title=Photo of the Dansette record player |publisher=casbahcoffeeclub.com |accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref> Mona had booked the [[The Quarrymen|Les Stewart Quartet]] to play the opening night with Harrison on guitar, but they cancelled the booking after Stewart and Brown had a quarrel.

All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows and stars, but as Lennon was [[short-sighted]], he mistook [[Gloss (paint)|gloss]] for [[Paint|emulsion]] paint, which took a long time to dry in the dark, damp cellar. [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia Powell]], later the wife of Lennon, painted a silhouette of him on the wall, which is also still there.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp43-44">Lennon (2006) pp43-44</ref><ref name="CasbahListedStatus"/><ref name="TheCasbahClub">{{cite web |first=Dick |last=Matthews |url=http://www.samleach.com/photos_beatles.html |title=Early Photos of The Casbah Club |publisher=SamLeach.com |accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref>

The Quarrymen played a series of seven Saturday night concerts in The Casbah for 15 [[shillings]] each, starting on 29 August to October 1959, featuring Brown, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, but without a drummer, and only one [[microphone]] connected to the club's small [[Public address|PA]] system.<ref name="Milesp51">Miles (1997) p51</ref><ref name="CasbahPhotos">{{cite web |first=David |last=Hughs |url=http://www.beatlesource.com/savage/1950s/59.08.29%20casbah/59.08.29casbah.html |title=Casbah photos |publisher=The Source |accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> The opening night concert was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air-conditioning, and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp44">Lennon (2006) p44</ref> After the success of the first night, Mona gave The Quarrymen a residency, and paid the whole group [[<U+00A3>]]3 a night.<ref name="Spitzp162">Spitz (2005) p162</ref> Every Saturday thereafter, queues lengthened onto the street, which was financially good for Mona, as she charged one shilling admission on top of the annual membership fee.<ref name="Spitzp164">Spitz (2005) p164</ref> As there was no amplification, Lennon later persuaded Mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called Harry to play a short set before The Quarrymen, but this was only so they could use his [[Amplifier|40-Watt amplifier]].<ref name="Spitzp163">Spitz (2005) p163</ref> 

Pete Best was studying at the Collegiate Grammar School when he decided he wanted to be in a music group, so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler's music store and Best formed his own band; The Black Jacks, who later played in The Casbah.<ref name="Spitzp161"/><ref name="liverpoolcollegiate">{{cite web |url=http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/liverpoolcollegiate |title=Liverpool Collegiate - Icons: A Portrait of England |publisher=Icons of England |accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref><ref name="RadioDJJimLadd">{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Ladd |url=http://www.eskimo.com/~bpentium/beatles/besttape/besttape.html |title=Best of The Beatles - an interview with Pete Best |publisher=The Beatles at the Web Spot |date=1982-04-01 |accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> Chas Newby joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after he had left The Quarrymen.<ref name="CasbahPhotos"/><ref name="Spitzp4-5">Spitz (2005) pp4<U+2013>5</ref><ref name="PhotoRecordCover">{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/uheep2/casbah.htm  |title=Photo of record cover showing Ken Brown with Harrison, McCartney and Lennon |publisher=Ozit Records |accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref> The reason for Brown's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the [[influenza|flu]], so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best's living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel with the rest of the group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown's money to be shared amongst the three of them, as Brown had not played. Mona refused, so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out.<ref name="Spitzp164-165">Spitz (2005) pp164<U+2013>165</ref> Colin Manley from The Remo Four was also given a booking to play in the club, which was the only venue that young amateur bands could play at the time.<ref name="Spitzp162"/> Other artists and groups like [[Cilla Black]], [[Rory Storm and the Hurricanes]], [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]] and [[Gerry & The Pacemakers]] later played in the club.<ref name="DrinkingCoffeeBeatles ">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/264205.stm |title=Drinking coffee with The Beatles  |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2003-01-27 |accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> The Black Jacks became the resident group at The Casbah, although The Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp44"/> It was in The Casbah Club that Lennon and McCartney persuaded Sutcliffe to buy a [[H<U+00F6>fner]] 500/5 model<U+2014>known in [[Europe]] as a ''President'' bass<U+2014>with the money he had won in the [[John Moores (merchant)|John Moores]] art exhibition.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD"><U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:28:02) Harrison and McCartney talking about Sutcliffe<U+2019>s first bass guitar.</ref><ref name="SutcliffePresidentBass">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockmine.com/Stu2.html |title=Sutcliffe's President Bass |publisher=Rockmine |accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref><ref name="SutcliffeChequeBook ">{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/cheque.asp |title=Sutcliffe's cheque book |publisher=Rockmine |accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> Even though the membership list later spiralled to over a thousand, Mona closed the club on 24 June 1962, with The Beatles as the last group to perform.<ref name="EndfOfTheCasbah">{{cite web |url=http://www.casbahcoffeeclub.com/default.asp?section=3,4,3 |title=The end of the club and the performers who played there |publisher=casbahcoffeeclub.com |accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref>
