The '''1910&nbsp;Cuba hurricane''', popularly known as the '''Cyclone of the Five Days''', was a destructive and unusual [[tropical cyclone]] which struck [[Cuba]] and the [[United States]] in October&nbsp;1910. It formed in the southern [[Caribbean]] on October&nbsp;9 and intensified as it moved northwestward, becoming a [[hurricane]] on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked on October 16, corresponding to Category&nbsp;4 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. It moved in a counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba again. It then tracked toward [[Florida]], landing near [[Cape Romano]]. After moving through the state, it hugged the coast of the [[Southeastern United States]] on its way out to sea.

Due to its unusual loop, initial reports suggested it was two separate storms that developed and hit land in rapid succession. Its track was subject to much debate at the time; eventually, it was identified as a single storm. Analysis of the event gave a greater understanding of weather systems which took similar paths.

The storm is considered one of the worst natural disasters in Cuban history. Damage was extensive and thousands were left homeless. It also had a widespread impact in Florida, including the destruction of houses and flooding. Although total monetary damage from the storm is unknown, estimates of losses in [[Havana, Cuba]] exceed $1&nbsp;million and in the [[Florida Keys]], $250,000. At least 100&nbsp;deaths occurred in Cuba alone.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|1910 Atlantic hurricane 5 track.png|alt=A map depicting the track of a hurricane that starts in the southern [[Caribbean Sea]], heads north towards Cuba, and completes a counter-clockwise loop in the extreme southern Gulf of Mexico. It then proceeds northeastward through the Florida Peninsula and ultimately dissipates over the Atlantic.}}
On October&nbsp;9, the fifth tropical depression of the 1910&nbsp;season formed from a tropical disturbance in the extreme southern [[Caribbean Sea]], to the north of [[Panama]]. It tracked steadily northwestward, and attained tropical storm intensity on October 11. It continued to strengthen, and became a hurricane the next day.<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Specialists Unit|publisher=National Hurricane Center|year=2010|accessdate=April 29, 2010|title=Easy to Read HURDAT 1851<U+2013>2009|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/easyread-2009.html}}</ref> On October&nbsp;13, the storm was observed to the southwest of [[Cuba]].<ref name="MWR">{{cite journal|volume=38|issue=10|authors=Charles F. von Herrmann|work=[[Monthly Weather Review]]|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|pages=1488<U+2013>1491|date=October 1910|accessdate=April 29, 2010|title=District No. 2, South Atlantic and East Gulf States|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/038/mwr-038-10-1487.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Early on October&nbsp;14, the hurricane briefly reached an intensity corresponding to [[SSHS#Category 4|Category&nbsp;3]] status on the modern-day [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] before tracking ashore along the western tip of Cuba. However, it weakened somewhat after crossing the island. Upon emerging into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the hurricane slowed considerably.<ref name="hurdat"/>

Steered by currents from an area of [[high pressure system|high pressure]] to the north, the [[storm]] began to drift northwestward and rapidly deepen over warm waters of the Gulf. It executed a tight counterclockwise loop, and continued to mature;<ref name="florida">Barnes, p. 93</ref> on October&nbsp;16 it reached peaked winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h) with a minimum barometric pressure of 924&nbsp;mbar (hPa;&nbsp;27.29&nbsp;inHg).<ref name="hurdat"/> The hurricane turned northeastward, again approaching western Cuba, and began to accelerate towards the [[Florida Panhandle]] on October&nbsp;17.<ref name="hurdat"/> Its center passed west of [[Key West]] and made landfall near [[Cape Romano, Florida|Cape Romano]].<ref name="florida"/> The storm moved due north for a time as it moved inland, and deteriorated into a tropical storm. From northeastern Florida, the cyclone curved northeastward and hugged the coast of the [[Southeast United States]] before heading out to sea.<ref name="florida"/> The storm is estimated to have dissipated on October&nbsp;23.<ref name="hurdat"/>

The storm is unusual in that due to its loop near Cuba, initial reports suggested that it was actually two separate cyclones.<ref name="florida"/> The ''[[Monthly Weather Review]]'' describes the event as multiple disturbances and reports that the first hurricane dissipated in the central Gulf of Mexico after crossing Cuba, while the second formed subsequently and hit Florida.<ref name="MWR"/> At the time, the storm's track was subject to much debate. It was later identified as a single storm, although observations on the hurricane led to advances in the understanding of tropical cyclones with similar paths.<ref name="florida"/> On October&nbsp;19, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "Whether two storms have been raging in Cuban waters within the past week, or whether the same storm has revisited Cuba, traversing southern Florida in its backwards course, remains to be determined. If the later supposition be correct, the recurve of the storm, after its entrance into the Gulf of Mexico, must have been unusually sudden and sharp."<ref>{{cite news|author=|title=The West Indian Hurricane|date=October 19, 1910|publisher=''The Washington Post''}}</ref>

==Impact==
On October&nbsp;15, all vessels within a {{convert|500|mi|km|abbr=on}} radius of Key West were warned of the approaching storm, and many ships anchored in harbors.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Hurricane Nears the Florida Coast|date=October 15, 1910|publisher=''The New York Times''|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9903E4DD1330E233A25756C1A9669D946196D6CF|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}</ref> Throughout the region, storm warnings and advisories were issued.<ref name="MWR"/>

===Cuba===
The storm wrought severe destruction in Cuba, considered to be among the worst effects from a tropical cyclone on record. High winds and torrential rainfall flooded streets, destroyed crops,<ref name="MWR"/> and damaged plantations.  In particular, the storm caused substantial damage to the tobacco in the region of [[Vuelta Abajo]].<ref>{{cite news|title = Great Storm in Cuba: Severe Damage Done to the Tobacco Crop | work = The Observer | date = October 16, 1910 |  page = 9}}</ref> Many towns were severely damaged or destroyed.<ref name="destroyed">{{cite news|author=|title=West Indian Hurricane|date=October 18, 1910|publisher=''The Scotsman''}}</ref> The city of [[Casilda, Cuba|Casilda]] was devastated,<ref name="cuba">{{cite web|author=|title=Terrific Hurricane|date=October 15, 1910|publisher=''The Evening Post''|accessdate=December 24, 2009|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=EP19101015.2.54}}</ref> while the town of [[Bataban<U+00F3>, Cuba|Bataban<U+00F3>]] was inundated by flood waters.

It is estimated that at least 100&nbsp;people lost their lives, mostly due to mudslides, including five persons in Havana.<ref name="long">Longshore, p. 109</ref><ref name = "Liners Defy"/> However, reports range as high as 700.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Cuba Hurricanes Historic Threats: Chronicle of hurricanes in Cuba|date=|publisher=Cuba Hurricanes|url=http://www.cubahurricanes.org/history-hurricanes-chronicles.php|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}</ref>   Initial estimates of the financial damage caused by the storm were in the millions of dollars, including losses of $1 million in Havana, largely from the destruction of Customs House sheds there, which were filled with many valuable goods.<ref name="havoc"/> Some of these buildings were swept {{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} away, and the winds tore the roof off the main warehouse.<ref name="america"/> In the aftermath<U+2014>while the hurricane was still widely considered to be two separate storms<U+2014>rumors arose "of the approach of a third storm",<ref name = "havoc"/> although in actuality no additional storms were known to have occurred in the 1910&nbsp;season.<ref name="hurdat"/>

===''Holliswood''===
A four-masted schooner, the ''Holliswood'', became trapped in the storm in the Gulf of Mexico. The vessel departed from [[New Orleans]] on October&nbsp;1, carrying cypress wood. The crew fought the storm for days and eventually the masts were cut to avoid capsizing.<ref name="sticks">{{cite web|author=|title=Sticks to His Ship, a Derelict at Sea|date=October 25, 1910|publisher=''The New York Times''|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9903E6DF1339E433A25756C2A9669D946196D6CF|accessdate=February 2, 2010 | format=PDF}}</ref> Waterlogged, the ship was blown miles off course.<ref name="skipper">{{cite web|author=|title=Skipper, Who Stood by Ship, Picked Up|date=October 27, 1910|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=February 2, 2010|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950CEED91F39E333A25754C2A9669D946196D6CF}}</ref> As described by the owner of the schooner, Paul Mangold:<ref name="sticks"/>

{{quote|On Wednesday, the 12th, we began to get the first of the hurricane. We were running under very little canvas. Early Saturday morning we got the full force of the storm. We managed to get the sails fast and ran with the hurricane under bare poles. The wind circled about us sometimes at a hundred-mile rate. The seas came from all directions, though it was from the starboard that the real trouble seemed to come.}}

The steamboat ''Harold'' spotted the ship and rescued all of its crew except Captain E. E. Walls, who opted to stay behind with the order "Report me to my owners".<ref name="sticks"/> At the time, the ''Holliswood'' was badly damaged, with her house destroyed and her rudder torn away. The crew apparently advised the captain that the ship would not stay afloat for another five hours, although he dismissed their concerns. After the crew was rescued, Captain Walls struggled against the storm for days without food or fresh water. On October&nbsp;20, the ''Parkwood'' rescued Walls unconscious, but initially feared to be dead.<ref name="skipper"/> Once aboard, he regained consciousness and, reportedly amidst an episode of delirium, asked to be returned to the ''Holliswood''. Ultimately, the captain of the ''Parkwood'' agreed to tow the battered ship to shore.<ref name="skipper"/>

===Southern Florida===
At Key West, pressures began to fall at midnight on October&nbsp;12 as the storm approached from the southwest. By late on October&nbsp;13, heavy rain had begun to fall, and winds began to increase, reaching {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on October&nbsp;14.<ref name="MWR"/><ref name = "Liners Defy">{{cite news|title = Liners Defy Cyclone | work = The Washington Post | date = October 15, 1910 | page = 1}}</ref>  Gusts reached {{convert|110|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and storm tide ran {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}}; swells in the area attained "unusually high" levels. Many docks were destroyed, and on October 17, the basement of the [[Weather Bureau]] office was submerged by rising waters.<ref name="florida1">Barnes, p. 94</ref> Before the rain gauge was washed out to sea, {{convert|3.89|in|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation was recorded. Damage throughout the Florida Keys was moderate, estimated at worth around $250,000 (1910&nbsp;USD). Property damage was generally limited to structures along the shore.<ref name="MWR"/>

As the storm progressed westward, [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and nearby locations started to experience its effects. Strong winds from the northeast blew water out of the [[Tampa Bay]] to the lowest level ever recorded. The barometer fell to 961&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 28.40&nbsp;inHg), and extremely high waves battered the shore from [[Flamingo, Florida|Flamingo]] to Cape Romano. The surf continued well inland, forcing survivors to cling atop trees.<ref name="florida1"/> North of Tampa, the hurricane's effects were moderate or light, while in the southwestern part of the state, damage increased in severity. A portion of the local citrus crop was destroyed.<ref name="MWR"/> Property damage was widespread from Tampa to [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] and points south. High winds tore the roofs off homes and shook some structures off their foundations.<ref name="florid">{{cite web|author=|title=West Indian Storm and Cold Wave May Meet|date=October 19, 1910|publisher=''The Galveston Daily News''|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}</ref>

Seven men lost their lives in the wreckage of several Cuban schooners at [[Punta Gorda, Florida|Punta Gorda]]. Nearby, one man and a baby drowned as a result of the storm surge, and another died while attempting to cross a flooded river.<ref name="MWR"/> A French steamship, the ''Louisiane'', went ashore with 600&nbsp;passengers; all people aboard the vessel were rescued by the ''Foreward'', a Revenue cutter.<ref name="florida1"/>

===Northeastern Florida and southern United States===
Damage on the Atlantic coast was less severe, although at [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]], the Weather Bureau office reported: "the rainfall at this point did more damage than the wind. It had rained every day from the 3rd to the 13th, with a total fall of 5.96&nbsp;inches, and the creeks and flat woods were full of water when the first storm began. From the 14th to the 18th, inclusive, 14.27&nbsp;inches more fell. The inlet being closed the rivers rose 8 feet above normal high water, which in a flat country like this, puts practically all land under water from 1 to 8 feet. Fortunately the sea remained low and comparatively smooth so that it was possible to open the inlet and let the water out."<ref name="florida1"/>

A large number of pine trees were blown down near the city of Jupiter. One man near [[Lemon City, Florida|Lemon City]] was killed by falling timber. Small watercraft, docks and boathouses sustained damage, but otherwise the storm's effects on the east coast were more moderate compared to other areas. Portions of the [[Florida East Coast Railroad]] bed were washed out, and repairs were anticipated to be costly. An American schooner blew ashore at [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]], killing three and leaving the rest of the crew stranded for 12&nbsp;hours until help arrived.   Estimates of the cyclone's impact on citrus crops in the region vary widely.<ref name="MWR"/>

On its way to sea, the storm passed just west of Jacksonville. Although very little damage occurred in and around the city, persistent northeasterly winds caused flooding in low-lying coastal areas. Minor flooding extended northward into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]]; initially, interruptions of communication between cities led to exaggerated reports of damage in those states. Early on October&nbsp;18, light precipitation began to fall in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] as the winds picked up. By October&nbsp;19, winds had reached {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. However, it was said that the city's worst damage came as a result of the high tides rather than the intense winds. Certain rivers exceeded their banks, submerging surrounding farmland. Minor damage occurred in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].<ref name="MWR"/>
