The '''fauna of Scotland''' is generally typical of the north-west [[Europe]]an part of the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]], although several of the country's larger [[mammal]]s were hunted to [[extinction]] in historic times and human activity has also led to various species of wildlife being introduced. [[Scotland]]'s diverse [[temperate]] environments support 62&nbsp;species of wild mammals, including a population of [[Wild Cat]]s, important numbers of [[Grey seal|Grey]] and [[Harbour seal|Harbour Seals]] and the most northerly colony of [[Bottlenose Dolphin]]s in the world.<ref>{{cite paper | last = Thompson | first = P.M. | coauthors = Corkrey, R.; Lusseau, D.; Lusseau, S.M.; Quick, N.;Durban, J.W.; Parsons, K.M. & Hammond, P.S. | date = 2006 | title = An assessment of the current condition of the Moray Firth bottlenose dolphin population | location = Perth | publisher = Scottish Natural Heritage Commissioned Report No. 175}}</ref><ref name =Matt>Matthews (1968) p. 254.</ref><ref name=snhmam>{{cite web | url = http://www.snh.org.uk/scottish/species/mammals.asp | title = Mammals | accessdaymonth = 1 January | accessyear = 2007 | publisher = Scottish Natural Heritage}}</ref>

===Carnivores===
[[Image:Wildkatze 002.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wildcat|Wild Cat]] (Felis silvestris)]]
The representation of the weasel family ([[Mustelidae]]) in Scotland is typical of Britain as a whole save that the [[European polecat|Polecat]] is absent and that Scotland is the UK's stronghold of the [[Pine Marten]],<ref>Corbet and Ovenden (1984) pp. 180&ndash;86.</ref> although the purity of the latter breed is threatened by a release of [[American Marten]]s in northern [[England]].<ref>Benvie (2004) p. 48.</ref> Scotland hosts the only populations of [[Wild cat#European Wild Cat|European Wild Cat]] in the [[British Isles]] with an assumed total of between 400 and 2,000&nbsp;animals,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.scottishwildcats.co.uk/ | title = Scotland's Cat; 400 and counting... | publisher = Scottish Wildcat Association | accessdaymonth = 1 January | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> and of the [[Red Fox]] sub-species ''Vulpes vulpes vulpes,'' a larger race than the more common ''V. v. crucigera'' and which has two distinct forms.<ref>Matthews (1968) pp. 231&ndash;32.</ref> The Wild Cat is at risk due to the inadequacy of protective legislation and is now considered at serious risk of extinction.<ref>Benvie (2004) p. 18.</ref><ref> Hull (2007) pp. 184&ndash;89.</ref>

Other than  occasional [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]]s, among the seals only the [[Phocidae]], or earless seals, are represented.  Two species, the [[Grey Seal]] and Harbour or [[Common Seal]] are present around the coast of Scotland in internationally important numbers. In 2002 the Scottish Grey Seal population was estimated at 120,600&nbsp;adult animals, which is around 36% of the world population and more than 90% of the UK's. The Scottish population of the Common Seal is 29,700, about 90% of the UK and 36% of the European total.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.snh.org.uk/trends/trends_notes/pdf/marine%20species/seals.pdf | title = Seals | publisher = Scottish Natural Heritage | accessdaymonth = 1 January | accessyear = 2007 | format = pdf}}</ref>

===Rodents, insectivores and lagomorphs===
Seventy-five per cent of the UK's [[Red Squirrel]]s are found in Scotland. This species faces threats that include competition from the introduced [[Eastern Gray Squirrel|Grey Squirrel]], and the 'Scottish Strategy for Red Squirrel Conservation' provides a framework for supporting its long-term conservation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.snh.org.uk/scottish/species/mammals/squirrels.asp | title = Red Squirrels | publisher = Scottish Natural Heritage | accessdaymonth = 1 January | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> Research in 2007 credited the growing population of Pine Martens with assisting this programme by preying selectively on the Grey Squirrels.<ref> Watson, Jeremy (30 December 2007) "Tufty's saviour to the rescue".

==Avifauna==
The history of mammals suggests three broad overlapping phases: natural colonisation after the ice age, human-caused extinctions, and introduction by humans of non-native species.<ref name=Buck>MacCormick, Finbar and Buckland, Paul C. ''The Vertebrate Fauna'' in Edwards, Kevin J. & Ralston, Ian B.M. (Eds) (2003) ''Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC - AD 1000''. Edinburgh. Edinburgh University Press. pp. 83&ndash;103.</ref> The greater mobility of birds makes such generalisations hard to substantiate in their case. Modern humans have done great damage to bird species, especially the raptors, but natural variations in populations are complex. For example, [[Northern Fulmar]]s were present at [[Skara Brae]] during the [[Neolithic]] period, but in [[medieval]] times their breeding range was restricted to [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]].<ref name=Buck/> Since then they have spread throughout the British Isles.<ref>Gooders (1994) p. 35.</ref><ref>Peterson ''et al'' (1993) Map 9.</ref>

Most of about 250&nbsp;species of bird regularly recorded in Britain venture into Scotland, and perhaps up to 300 more occur with varying degrees of rarity. A total of 247&nbsp;species have been assessed and each placed onto one of three lists, red, amber or green, indicating the level of concern for their future. Forty species are red-listed, 121 are amber-listed and 86 are green-listed.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bto.org/psob/index.htm | title = Populations Status of Birds in the UK | publisher = British Trust for Ornithology | accessdaymonth = 6 January | accessyear = 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/Bocc2_tcm9-132673.pdf | title = Birds of conservation concern: 2002<U+2013>2007 | publisher = RSPB | accessdaymonth = 7 January | accessyear = 2007 | format = pdf}}</ref>

The [[Scottish Crossbill]], ''Loxia scotica'', which inhabits the coniferous forests of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], is Britain's only endemic bird and, with only 300&nbsp;breeding pairs, one of Europe's most threatened species.<ref>Benvie (2004) p. 55.</ref> Its shape, red/green hue and habit of hanging upside down has led to comparisons with [[parrot]]s.<ref> Miles and Jackman (1991) p. 21.</ref> [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]] has a unique subspecies of [[Winter wren|wren]], ''Troglodytes troglodytes hirtensis'', which has adapted to perching on the rocks and cliffs of this treeless [[Atlantic]] island, and consequently has developed larger and stronger feet than the mainland variant. It is also slightly larger, has a longer beak, a drabber though more varied colouring, and a "peculiarly sweet and soft" song. The sub-species was recognised in 1884 and was protected by a special [[act of parliament]] in 1904 to prevent its destruction "at the hands of ornithologists, egg-collectors, taxidermists and tourists".<ref>Maclean (1972) p. 21.</ref> 

===Raptors===
All but a few pairs of Britain's approximately 600&nbsp;[[Golden Eagle]]s are found in Scotland as are most of the breeding [[Peregrine Falcon]]s.<ref>Brown (1989) pp. 175, 176, 187. </ref> The [[Eurasian Hobby|Hobby]], [[Marsh Harrier]] and [[Montagu's Harrier]] although found in [[England]] and [[Wales]] are generally absent.<ref>Gooders (1994) pp. 85, 86, 94.</ref>

In 1916 an English [[vicar]] stole the last native [[White-tailed Eagle|White-tailed Sea Eagle]] eggs on [[Skye]],<ref name=Guinn>{{cite book | editor = McFarlan, D. | year = 1991 | title = The Guinness Book of Records | location = Enfield | publisher = Guinness Publishing}} p. 35.</ref> and the last adult was shot on [[Shetland]] two years later. However, the species was reintroduced to the island of [[R<U+00F9>m]] in 1975. The bird spread successfully to various neighbouring islands, and 30&nbsp;pairs were established by 2006. Despite fears expressed by local farmers, the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] (RSPB) plan to release up to 100&nbsp;young eagles on the east coast in the [[Firth of Forth|Forth]] and [[Firth of Tay|Tay]] estuaries.<ref name=Watson/><ref>Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 65 states that they bred until the 1960s.</ref> The [[Red Kite]] was exterminated in Scotland in 1879, and a reintroduction programme was launched by the RSPB in the 1980s. Although the species has made significant advances, it is estimated that 38% of the 395&nbsp;birds fledged between 1999 and 2003 were poisoned and a further 9% shot or otherwise killed by humans. The RSPB stated: "it may take a custodial sentence before people engaged with this activity begin to take the matter seriously".<ref>{{cite news | last = Ross | first = John | date = 29 December 2006 | title = Mass slaughter of the red kites | publisher = ''The Scotsman'' | location = Edinburgh}}</ref>

After an absence of nearly 40&nbsp;years the [[Ospreys in Britain|Osprey]] successfully re-colonised Scotland in the early 1950s. In 1899 they had bred at the ruined Loch an Eilean castle near [[Aviemore]] and at [[Loch Arkaig]] until 1908. In 1952 they claimed a new site at [[Loch Garten Osprey Centre|Loch Garten]].<ref>Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 274. </ref> There are now 150&nbsp;breeding pairs.<ref>Benvie (2004) p. 102.</ref>

Other raptor species found in the UK such as the [[Common Kestrel|Kestrel]], [[Hen Harrier]], [[Goshawk]], [[Eurasian Sparrowhawk|Sparrowhawk]], [[Tawny Owl]], and [[Barn Owl]] are widely distributed in Scotland, although the [[Little Owl]] is confined to the south.<ref>Brown (1989) pp. 104, 115.</ref><ref>Gooders (1994) pp. 84, 88, 89, 92, 179&ndash;82.</ref> [[Common Buzzard|Buzzards]] have displayed a remarkable resilience, having recovered from human persecution and the [[myxamatosis]] epidemic of the 1950s, which reduced their food supply.

===Game birds, waders and water fowl===
Red-listed [[Western Capercaillie]] and [[Ptarmigan]] breed in Scotland and are absent elsewhere in the British Isles. The former became extinct in Scotland in 1785 but was successfully reintroduced from [[Sweden|Swedish]] stock in 1837.<ref>[http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/tfl.capercaillie.html "Species Profile: Capercaillie"] Trees for Life.

Virtually all of the 40,000&nbsp;[[Barnacle Goose|Barnacle Geese]], which breed in [[Greenland]], arrive on [[Islay]] for the winter, most staying only for a few days before dispersing to the surrounding area. A similar number use the [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] Basin as a temporary roost in October, and 20% of the world population of 225,000&nbsp;birds over-winter on Scottish lochs.<ref> Benvie (2004) p. 74.</ref> The amber-listed [[Black-throated Diver|Black]] and [[Red-throated Diver]]'s freshwater breeding strongholds in the British Isles are in the north and west of Scotland.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rspb.org.uk/birds/guide/b/blackthroateddiver/index.asp  | title = Black-throated Diver | publisher = RSPB | accessdaymonth = 7 January | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

===Passerines===
[[Image:Corvus corone cornix 0379.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hooded Crow]] (''Corvus cornix'')]]
[[Raven]]s are typically forest-dwelling birds in much of Europe, but in Scotland they are generally associated with mountains and sea coasts. In 2002 the [[Hooded Crow]] was recognised as a separate species from the [[Carrion Crow]]. Scotland and Northern Ireland host all of the 190,000&nbsp;UK territories of the former.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rspb.org.uk/birds/guide/h/hoodedcrow/index.asp | title = Hooded Crow | publisher = RSPB | accessdaymonth = 7 January | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> A recent survey suggest that Raven numbers are increasing but that [[Hooded Crow]]s had declined by 59% while [[Carrion Crow]] numbers were essentially static.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.snh.org.uk/trends/trends_notes/pdf/terrestrial%20species/breeding%20land%20birds.pdf | title = National Heritage Trends | publisher = Scottish Natural Heritage | accessdaymonth = 7 January | accessyear = 2007 | format = pdf}}</ref> Concentrated on the islands of [[Islay]] and [[Colonsay]], 340&nbsp;pairs of [[Chough]] nest in Scotland.<ref> Benvie (2004) p. 118.</ref>

In addition to [[Crossbill]]s (see above), [[Crested Tit]]s exist as a fragmented population of 2,400&nbsp;breeding pairs in remnant patches of [[Caledonian Forest]] and in some larger plantations such as the Culbin Forest in [[Moray]]. [[Ring Ouzel]]s have declined to around 7,000&nbsp;pairs, possibly due to disturbance from the growing number of human visitors to their upland habitat. There are fewer than 100&nbsp;breeding pairs of [[Snow Bunting]], although in winter they are joined by migrants from continental Europe. A nest site near [[Dumfries]] is thought to have been in use by [[Dipper]]s since 1881. Scotland has 95% of the British breeding population of red-listed [[Twite]], about 64,000&nbsp;pairs.<ref>Benvie (2004) p. 79. </ref> However, a recent [[RSPB]] survey found a sudden and dramatic fall in winter numbers from 6,000 in 1998 to only 300 in 2006 in the counties of [[Caithness]] and [[Sutherland]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Ross | first = John | date =26 June 2007| title = Habitat changes leave the twite living on a wing and prayer | location = Edinburgh | publisher = ''The Scotsman''}}</ref>

===Vagrants===
Scotland's position on the western seaboard of Europe means that a variety of birds not normally found in the country visit from time to time. These include accidental visits by [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] birds which have wandered far from their normal habitations. 

[[Fair Isle]] is an internationally renowned site for the observation of migrant birds. Rarities have included [[passerines]] such as the [[Thick-billed Warbler]], [[White-throated Sparrow]], [[Yellow-rumped Warbler]] and [[Collared Flycatcher]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fairislebirdobs.co.uk/Migration_Studies/Common_&_Rare_Migrants.htm | title = Common and Rare Migrants | publisher = Fair Isle Bird Observatory | accessdaymonth = 4 January | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> More than 345&nbsp;species of bird have been recorded on this island,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/fairisle/birdobservatory/index.html | title = Fair Isle Bird Observatory| publisher = Undiscovered Scotland | accessdaymonth = 4 January | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> which measures only {{convert|7.68|km2|mi2}}.<ref>Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 410.</ref>

Elsewhere, other rarities reported in 2006 include a [[White-billed Diver]] at [[Gairloch]], a [[Black-browed Albatross]] in the [[Western Isles]], a [[Laughing Gull]] in [[Shetland]] and a [[Buff-breasted Sandpiper]] at [[Lossiemouth]].<ref>''British Birds'' (August 2006) '''199'''. London: BB 2000.</ref> Accidentals recorded in earlier years include an [[American Bittern]] in 1888 and a [[Purple Heron]] in the same year, a [[Baikal Teal]] in 1958, and a [[Black stork]] in 1977.<ref> Cook (1992) pp. 37, 39, 57.</ref> Birds are also presumed to have escaped from captivity, such as a [[Lanner Falcon]] in 1976, [[Chilean Flamingo]]s in 1976 and 1979, a [[Black-necked Swan]] in 1988, and a [[Red-tailed Hawk]] in 1989.<ref> Cook (1992) pp. 85, 41, 45, 80.</ref> These records are but a small selection from two [[county|counties]] in the north-east and give only a flavour of the complexity and diversity of avian life in Scotland.

===Extinctions===
The [[Common Crane]] and [[Great Bittern]] were exterminated by hunters and the draining of marshes in the 18th&nbsp;century.<ref>Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64.</ref> The last [[Great Auk]] seen in Britain was killed on [[Stac an Armin]], a rocky pinnacle in the [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]] archipelago in July 1840.<ref>Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 325.</ref>

==Fish and sea life==
Of the 42&nbsp;species of fish found in Scottish fresh waters, only half have arrived by natural colonisation. Native species include [[shad|Allis Shad]], [[Brown Trout]], [[European Eel]] and [[Lampetra fluviatilis|River Lamprey]]. Scottish rivers support one of the largest [[Atlantic Salmon]] resources in Europe, with nearly 400&nbsp;rivers supporting genetically distinct populations.<ref name=sefish>{{cite web | url = http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library2/doc14/saff-02.asp | title = Protecting and Promoting Scotland's Freshwater Fish and Fisheries | publisher = Scottish Executive | accessdaymonth = 13 January | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> Five fish species are considered <U+2018>late arrivals<U+2019> to Scotland, having colonised by natural means prior to 1790.

Scotland<U+2019>s seas, which constitute an area greater than that of the seas around the rest of the UK, are among the most biologically productive in the world. They are home to a third of the world<U+2019>s whale and dolphin species, most of the UK<U+2019>s [[maerl]], (a collective term for several species of calcified red seaweed, and an important marine habitat), [[mussel|Horsemussel]] (''Modiolus modiolus'') and [[seagrass]] beds, and distinctive species like the Tall Sea Pen, ''Funiculina quadrangularis''. It is estimated that the total number of Scottish marine species exceeds 40,000.<ref name=InFish/><ref name =SNHsea/> This includes 250&nbsp;species of [[fish]], the most numerous inshore variety being [[Saithe]],<ref name=Buck/> and deeper water creatures such as the [[Dogfish]], [[Porbeagle]] and [[Blue Shark]], [[European Eel]], [[Sea Bass]], [[Atlantic halibut|Atlantic Halibut]] and various [[Batoidea|rays]]. There are four species of [[sea turtle]], the [[Leatherback turtle|Leatherback]], [[Loggerhead turtle|Loggerhead]], [[Kemp's Ridley]] and [[Green Sea Turtle|Green Turtle]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:pWSw1gFNpmkJ:www.nesbiodiversity.org.uk/pdf-files/Roadshow%2520leaflet.pdf+Turtles,+Scotland+SNH&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=uk&client=firefox-a| title = Turtles in Scotland | publisher = Marine Conservation Society | accessdaymonth = 24 August | accessyear = 2008}}</ref> Scottish waters contain around 2,500&nbsp;[[crustacean]] species and 700&nbsp;[[mollusc]]s.<ref name =SNHsea/>

The [[Darwin Mounds]], an important area of cold water [[coral reef]]s discovered in 1988, are about {{convert|1000|m|ft}} deep in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], about {{convert|185|km|mi}} north-west of [[Cape Wrath]] in the north-east corner of the [[Rockall]] trough. The area covers approximately {{convert|100|km2|mi2}} and contains hundreds of mounds of about {{convert|100|m|ft}} in diameter and {{convert|5|m|ft}} in height, many having a teardrop shaped <U+2018>tail<U+2019> orientated south-west of the mound. This feature may be unique globally. The tops of the mounds have living stands of ''Lophelia'' corals and support significant populations of the single-celled ''[[Syringammina fragilissima]]''. Fish have been observed in the vicinity but not at higher densities than the background environment. Damage from trawler fishing was visible over about a half of the eastern Darwin Mounds surveyed during summer 2000, and the UK government is taking steps to protect the area.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1449 | title = Biogenic reefs - cold water corals | publisher = Joint Nature Conservation Committee | accessdaymonth = 7 January | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> In 2003 the [[European Commission]] provided emergency protection and banned damaging fishing activity in the locality.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2003/08/3968 | title = Protection for Darwin Mounds | publisher = Scottish Executive | accessdaymonth = 8 January | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

Further action on a much wider scale may be required. According to a recent report "Scotland's marine life could be almost wiped out within 50&nbsp;years unless tough action is taken to manage the way humans use the seas". Fears were expressed by a consortium of environmental organisations that commercial fish stocks, including [[Atlantic Cod]] are suffering from over-fishing, that fish farming, especially for salmon is damaging the aquatic environment, a reduction in coastal marsh habitats is affecting marine bird life, litter in densely populated estuaries such as the [[Firth of Clyde]] is affecting all forms of marine life and that the growth in off-shore tourism was deleterious to populations of, for example, [[Basking Shark]]. A call was made for a 'Scottish Marine [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill']] to co-ordinate and manage human activity at sea and to provide more protected areas such as marine [[national park]]s.<ref>{{cite news | last = Johnston | first = I. | date = 6 January 2007 | title = Escalating threat to the future of Scotland's seas | location = Edinburgh | publisher = The Scotsman}}</ref>

''Calyptraea chinensis'' (L.)  is a [[gastropod]] that has invaded the shores of Scotland and by 1998 had reached nearly as far north as Oban. One living specimen was found at Clachan Sound, and earlier records showed findings of gastropod shells.<ref name="Smith 98">Smith, S. 1998.

===Riverine extinctions===
Pollution and predation led to the extinction of both species of [[Vendace]] from its very restricted range in south-western Scottish freshwaters in 1980. In the 1990s a successful attempt to reintroduce ''[[Coregonus vandesius]]'' to the [[Lochmaben]] area began. ''[[Coregonus albula]]'' remains absent.<ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/05/19366/37243 "Scotland's Biodiversity: It's in Your Hands - A strategy for the conservation and enhancement of biodiversity in Scotland"].

==Terrestrial invertebrates==
Seventy-seven species of land snail<ref>Carter, Stephen P. "Land Snails" in Edwards and Ralston, Ian (2003) p. 104.</ref> and an estimated 14,000&nbsp;species of insect live in Scotland, none of them "truly" endemic.<ref name=Sadler>Buckland, Paul C. and Sadler, Jon P.

These ants, which are the most numerous residents of the Caledonian pine forest, build mounds from the pine cones and needles they find on the forest floor and may inhabit the mounds for decades. A single colony may collect 100,000&nbsp;insects a day to feed its half million citizens and produce up to {{convert|250|kg|lb}} of [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] per season.<ref>Miles & Jackman (1991) p. 47.</ref>

In addition to the Scottish Wood Ant, several Scottish species of invertebrate exist that are otherwise rare in the UK and important enough to have a specific "Action Plan" to provide protection. These are five species of [[ant]] and [[bee]], six [[moth]]s and [[butterfly]], five [[fly|flies]] and a single beetle (the Reed Beetle) and snail (the [[Vertigo genesii|Round-mouthed Whorl Snail]], ''Vertigo genesii'').<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.snh.org.uk/scottish/species/invertebrates.asp | title = Invertebrates | publisher = Scottish Natural Heritage | accessdaymonth = 15 January | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> [[Northern Colletes]] is a rare species of bee, the most significant British habitat for which is in the [[Outer Hebrides]],  where there are more than ten colonies.<ref name=Herald>{{cite news |first=David |last=Ross |title=Rare species of burrowing bee has flourished in Outer Hebrides |url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.1684785.0.0.php |work = The Herald |date=13 September 2007 |accessdate = 2007-09-13}}</ref> Scotland is also the UK stronghold of the [[Bumblebee|Blaeberry Bumblebee]], and the Bumblebee Conservation Trust recently created the world's first sanctuary for this [[genus]] of insects at [[RSPB Vane Farm|Vane Farm]] near [[Loch Leven]].<ref>"The bee's knees".

Although many species of [[butterfly]] are in decline in the UK, recent research suggests that some, such as the [[Pearl-bordered Fritillary]], [[Marsh Fritillary]] and [[Chequered Skipper]], which are becoming rare in the rest of the UK, are moving north into Scotland in response to climate change.<ref>Smith, Claire (21 July 2007) "Butterflies are flitting here from the South."

Aberdeen. ''Press and Journal''.</ref>

The most well-known invertebrate may be a species of midge (''[[Highland midge|Culicoides impunctatus]]''), a tiny flying gnat which is the scourge of summer visitors and residents alike. Its [[predation]]s result in the loss of up to 20% of summer working days in the forestry industry.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/tfl.midge.html | title = Highland biting midge | publisher = Trees for Life | accessdaymonth = 15 January | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> Others of significance include the [[Pine Weevil]], Black Pine Beetle, [[Clytrinae|Clytra Beetle]], and the [[Timberman beetle|Timberman]], a [[long-horned beetle]].<ref>According to Miles & Jackman (1991) p. 48 the 'timberman' is found only in Scotland.</ref> The archaeological site at [[Skara Brae]] provided the earliest known record of the human flea, ''[[flea|Pulex irritans]]'' in Europe.<ref name=Sadler/>

==Nature conservation in Scotland==
===Challenges===
Conservation of the natural environment is well-developed in the [[United Kingdom]]. The resources of the organisations concerned may be insufficient to the challenge, but the contrast with earlier attitudes about the environment is striking. In [[Victorian times]] few animals became extinct in Scotland, but the scale of the slaughter on hunting estates was staggering. Richard Perry records that on a <u>single estate</u> in the [[Cairngorms]] between 1837 and 1840 the following "vermin" were exterminated by keepers purely in the interests of preserving the [[Red Grouse|grouse]] population: 

<blockquote>
246&nbsp;Martens, 198&nbsp;Wild Cats, 106&nbsp;Polecats, 67&nbsp;Badgers, 58&nbsp;Otters, 475&nbsp;Ravens, 462&nbsp;Kestrels, 371&nbsp;Rough-legged Buzzards, 285&nbsp;Common Buzzards, 275&nbsp;Kites, 98&nbsp;Peregrine Falcons, 92&nbsp;Hen Harriers, 78&nbsp;Merlins, 71&nbsp;Short-eared Owls, 63&nbsp;Goshawks, 35&nbsp;Long-eared Owls, 27&nbsp;Sea Eagles, 18&nbsp;Ospreys, 15&nbsp;Golden Eagles, 11&nbsp;Hobbys, 6&nbsp;Gyrfalcons, 5&nbsp;Marsh Harriers, 3&nbsp;Honey Buzzards,
</blockquote>and for reasons apparently unconnected to grouse shooting, a further 
<blockquote>
11&nbsp;Foxes, 301&nbsp;Stoats and Weasels, 78&nbsp;House Cats, 1,431&nbsp;Hooded or Carrion Crow, 3&nbsp;Barn Owls, 8&nbsp;Magpies and 7&nbsp;"Orange-legged Falcons". 
</blockquote>
Writing in 1947, Perry stated that his "first reaction to this dreadful black-list was that of amazed incredulity. I still find the details incredible. However, they were supplied by the lessee himself."<ref>Perry (1948) pp. 54&ndash;55.</ref> In several instances these extermination totals are larger than the current resident numbers for the entire country.

It remains to be seen if the destruction wrought by the Victorians continues to be the nadir for the fauna of Scotland. In addition to other difficulties the marine environment faces, [[climate change]] is a challenge facing all of Scotland's habitats. Among the birds, [[Ptarmigan]], [[Dotterel]] and [[Snow Bunting]] in particular may be affected as they depend on high-altitude habitats, and populations are likely to decline if warmer weather brings competitors into their restricted ranges.<ref>Benvie (2004) pp. 19, 30, 34.</ref> Mammals and other vertebrates may fare better, although localised invertebrate populations are at risk. Marine life is already being affected. [[Plankton]]ic species that prefer cold water are declining and are not able support the crucial food chains on which many seabirds depend.<ref>{{cite news | last = Johnston | first = I. | date = 19 November 2006| title = Sea change as plankton head north | location = Edinburgh | publisher = ''The Scotsman''}}</ref> Further evidence of problems for marine species has been provided by the [[St Andrews University]] Sea Mammal Research Unit. An analysis suggests that [[Common Seal]] populations in [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] fell by 40% from 2001 to 2006, prompting the [[Scottish Executive]] to announce the likelihood of a new protective conservation order.<ref>{{cite news | last = Hardie | first = Alison | date = 20 January 2007| title = Dramatic decline in island common seal populations baffles experts | location = Edinburgh | publisher = ''The Scotsman''}}</ref>

The complexities involved in conserving Scottish wildlife are highlighted in an RSPB report, noting that Pine Martens have been found to be a significant predator of Capercaillie nests. Both species are protected, providing conservation agencies with a challenging conundrum to address.<ref>"The capercaillie conundrum" (October 2007) ''BBC Wildlife'' '''25''' No. 9.</ref>

===Conservation organisations===

Various public sector organisations have an important role in the stewardship of the country's fauna. [[Scottish Natural Heritage]] is the statutory body responsible for natural heritage management in Scotland. One of its duties is to establish National Nature Reserves (NNR)s. Until 2004 there were 73, but a review carried out in that year resulted in a significant number of sites losing their NNR status, and as of 2006 there are 55.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/corporate/annreview06/SNH%20Review%202006.pdf|title=SNH Annual Review 2006|format=PDF|publisher = Scottish Natural Heritage|accessdaymonth = 16 February | accessyear = 2007}}</ref><ref>A new policy for NNRs was developed in 1996, which required them to have four attributes: primacy of nature, national importance, best practice management and continuity of management. The sites not meeting these characteristics were removed from the list. See [http://www.nnr-scotland.com/downloads/publications/The_Story_of_Hermaness_National_Nature_Reserve.pdf "The Story of Hermaness National Nature Reserve: Appendix 1"] (pdf)  SNH. Retrieved on 23 August 2008.</ref> The [[Forestry Commission]] in Scotland serves as the forestry department of the [[Scottish Government]] and is one of the country's largest landowners. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee is the statutory adviser to Government on UK and international nature conservation.

The country has two [[national park]]s. [[Cairngorms National Park]] includes the largest area of arctic mountain landscape in the UK. Sites designated as of importance to natural heritage take up 39% of the land area, two thirds of which are of Europe-wide importance.<ref>[http://www.cairngorms.co.uk/park/index.php "The Park"] Cairngorms National Park Authority. Retrieved on 16 January 2006.</ref> [[Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park]] includes Britain's largest body of fresh water, the mountains of [[Breadalbane]] and the sea lochs of [[Argyll]]. 

Many charitable and voluntary organisations also have important roles to play. The [[National Trust for Scotland]] is the conservation charity that protects and promotes Scotland's natural and cultural heritage. With more than 270,000&nbsp;members it is the largest conservation charity in Scotland. The [[Scottish Wildlife Trust]] is a leading voluntary conservation organisation, working to protect Scotland's natural environment. The [[Royal Zoological Society of Scotland]] is a learned society and registered charity that maintains [[Edinburgh Zoo]] and the [[Highland Wildlife Park]] (a safari park and zoo near [[Kingussie]], which specialises in native fauna). The Society is also involved in various conservation programs around Scotland and the world. The [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] promotes conservation of birds and other wildlife through the protection and re-creation of habitats. The [[John Muir Trust]] is a charity whose main role is as a guardian of wild land and wildlife, through the ownership of land and the promotion of education and [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. The trust owns and manages estates in locations including [[Knoydart]] and [[Assynt]], and on the isle of [[Skye]]. It has links with the [[Sierra Club]] in the United States which also celebrates the legacy of [[Dunbar]]-born [[John Muir]].<ref>[http://www.jmt.org/ "Welcome to the John Muir Trust"] John Muir Trust. Retrieved on 3 January 2007.</ref> [[Trees for Life (Scotland)|Trees for Life]] is a charity that aims to restore a "wild forest" in the [[Northwest Highlands]] and [[Grampian Mountains (Scotland)|Grampian Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/tfl.visi.html | title =  "Our Vision"| publisher = Trees for Life | accessdaymonth = 3 January |accessyear =2007}}</ref>
