"'''Saint Louis Blues'''" is a popular American song composed by [[W. C. Handy]] in the [[blues]] style. It remains a fundamental part of [[jazz]] musicians' repertoire. It was also one of the first blues songs to succeed as a [[pop music|pop song]]. It has been performed by numerous musicians of all styles from [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Bessie Smith]] to [[Count Basie]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Guy Lombardo]], and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]]. It has been called "the jazzman's ''[[Hamlet]]''".<ref>{{cite book |title=Body and Soul: Jazz and Blues in American Film, 1927-63 |last=Stanfield |first=Peter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location= |isbn=0-252-02994-1 |page=83 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yFk-Hqc4rnwC&lpg=PA83&dq=%22the%20jazzman's%20Hamlet%22&pg=PA83#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=12 April 2005}}</ref> Published in September 1914 by Handy's own company, it later gained such popularity that it inspired the dance step the "[[Foxtrot (dance)|Foxtrot]]".

The version with [[Bessie Smith]] and [[Louis Armstrong]] on cornet was inducted in the [[List of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients Q-Z|Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 1993. The 1929 version by [[Louis Armstrong]] & His Orchestra (with [[Henry "Red" Allen]]) was inducted there in 2008.

==History==
Handy said he had been inspired by a chance meeting with a woman on the streets of [[St. Louis]] distraught over her husband's absence, who lamented, "Ma man's got a heart like a rock cast in de sea", a key line of the song.<ref>http://bluesnet.hub.org/readings/st.louis.blues.html{{Dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Handy|1941|p=119}}</ref> Details of the story vary. [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] states that Handy encountered the melody in St. Louis, [[Missouri]], in 1892, when he was out of work. It had numerous one-line verses "and they would sing it all night."<ref>Palmer, Robert (1981: 42). ''Deep Blues''.</ref>

At the time of his death in 1958, Handy was earning royalties upwards of US$25,000 annually for the song. The original published sheet music is available online at the [[United States]] [[Library of Congress]] in a searchable database of African-American music from Brown University.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/S?ammem/aasm:@field(TITLE+@od1(St++Louis+blues+)) American Memory from the Library of Congress - Browse by<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Analysis==
The form is unusual in that the verses are the now familiar [[jazz standard|standard]] [[twelve-bar blues]] in [[common time]] with three lines of lyrics, the first two lines repeated, but it also has a 16-bar [[bridge (music)|bridge]] written in the [[habanera (music)|habanera]] rhythm, popularly called the "[[Spanish Tinge]]", and identified by Handy as [[tango (music)|tango]]<ref name="Handy1941">{{Harvnb|Handy|1941|pp=99<U+2013>100}}</ref> Handy's tango-like rhythm is notated as a dotted quarter note, followed by an eighth, and two quarter notes, with no slurs or ties, and is seen in the introduction as well as the sixteen-measure bridge.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/S?ammem/aasm:@field(TITLE+@od1(St++Louis+blues+)) click on Rudi Valee version cover image, then advance pages]</ref>

[[File:St louis blues.tif|thumb|center|480px|Excerpt from "St. Louis Blues" by W.C. Handy (1914). The left hand plays the habanera rhythm.]]

While blues became often simple and repetitive in form, "Saint Louis Blues" has multiple complementary and contrasting [[Strain (music)|strains]], similar to classic [[ragtime]] compositions. Handy said his objective in writing "Saint Louis Blues" was "to combine ragtime [[syncopation]] with a real melody in the spiritual tradition."<ref>{{Harvnb|Handy|1941|p=120}}</ref>

With traditional New Orleans and New Orleans style bands, the tune is one of a handful that includes a set traditional solo. The [[clarinet]] solo with a distinctive series of rising [[partial (music)|partials]] was first recorded by [[Larry Shields]] on the 1921 [[Original Dixieland Jass Band]] record. It is not found on any earlier recordings nor published orchestrations of the tune. Shields is often credited with creating this solo; however, alternative claims have been made for other early New Orleans clarinetists, including [[Emile Barnes]].

Writing about the first time "St Louis Blues" was played (1914),<ref>{{Harvnb|Handy|1941|p=305}}</ref> Handy notes that "The one-step and other dances had been done to the tempo of Memphis Blues... When St Louis Blues was written the tango was in vogue. I tricked the dancers by arranging a tango introduction, breaking abruptly into a low-down blues. My eyes swept the floor anxiously, then suddenly I saw lightning strike. The dancers seemed electrified. Something within them came suddenly to life. An instinct that wanted so much to live, to fling its arms to spread joy, took them by the heels."<ref name="Handy1941" />

Researcher Guy Marco, in his book ''Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound in the United States'', stated that the first audio recording of "Saint Louis Blues" was by [[Al Bernard]] in July 1918 on the record company label [[Aeolian-Vocalion]] (cat. no. 12148). This is however not true, since [[Columbia records|Columbia's]] house band, directed by [[Charles A. Prince]], had recorded a released instrumental version already in December 1915 (Columbia A5772). Bernard's version may have been the first US issue to include the lyrics though. However, by then [[Ciro's Club Coon Orchestra]], a group of black American artists appearing in Britain, had already recorded a version including the lyrics in September 1917 (UK Columbia 699).

Since the 1910s, the number has enjoyed great popularity not only as a song but also as an instrumental.

Many of jazz's most well-known artists in history have given renowned performances of the tune. The following is an incomplete list of the hundreds of musicians of renown who recorded "Saint Louis Blues," chosen as examples that are early in their careers and in the era of its greatest popularity.

==In popular culture==
===Films===
A number of short and feature films have been entitled ''St. Louis Blues''; the first, in 1929, featured [[Bessie Smith]]. See: [[St. Louis Blues (film)]].

"St. Louis Blues" is played in the 1914 ''[[Charles Chaplin]]'' film, ''[[The Star Boarder (1914 film)|The Star Boarder]]'' as well as later being sung by [[Theresa Harris]] and played several times, including the opening credits, in the 1933 film ''[[Baby Face (film)|Baby Face]]''.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023775/soundtrack</ref>
The song is also sung by [[Marcellite Garner]] as [[Minnie Mouse]] in the 1931 animated short film, ''[[Blue Rhythm]]''.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021676/soundtrack</ref>
It is played a number of times in the 1936 film, ''Banjo on my Knee'', by [[Walter Brennan]] and is sung as a major production number by the [[Hall Johnson]] Choir as [[Barbara Stanwyck]] looks on.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027331/soundtrack</ref>

As an instrumental, the song is featured in [[Lewis Milestone]]'s early talkie, ''[[Rain (1932 film)|Rain]]'', in which it comes to symbolize the wanton ways of the main character Sadie Thompson, played by [[Joan Crawford]].<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023369/soundtrack</ref>

===Other===
The [[St. Louis Blues]] [[NHL]] team is named after the W.C. Handy song, and their theme song is Miller's version of the Handy composition.

The title of [[William Faulkner]]'s short story "[[That Evening Sun]]" (published 1931) references the famous opening lyrics from "Saint Louis Blues".

"About Her" by [[Malcolm McLaren]] (from ''[[Kill Bill Vol. 2 Original Soundtrack]]'') samples this song <U+2013> in particular the line, "My man's got a heart... like a rock cast in the sea".

In [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s existentialist play ''[[No Exit]]'', Estelle talks about how she and Peter, one of her admirers, used to dance to "Saint Louis Blues".

A unique oddity is the relationship of the "Saint Louis Blues" and the song "[[Memphis, Tennessee (song)|Memphis, Tennessee]]" by [[Chuck Berry]]. The composers of these two songs lived in the other city; W.C. Handy was from Memphis, and [[Chuck Berry]] was from St. Louis. Yet they both wrote the song most associated with the other's hometown.
