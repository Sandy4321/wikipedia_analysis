'''Leonard Harrsion "Lennie" Aleshire''' (April 27, 1890 - October 15, 1987) was a versatile [[United States|American]] [[vaudeville]] and [[country music]] performer from the mid-1920s through the 1950s.  A singer, dancer and songwriter, he was also half of a popular musical comedy duo, '''Lennie and Goo Goo''', with Floyd Rutledge.

==Biography==
  
Lennie Aleshire was born April 27, 1890 just south of [[Springfield, Missouri]]. He was playing the fiddle by age six and learned the guitar, banjo and other instruments by ear. At 15, he lived with the [[Creek (American Indians)|Creek Indians]] near Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, though his mother was half Cherokee. After his parents died, he lived with his brother and sister near [[Dadeville, Missouri|Dadeville]]. Aleshire and his brother John played the [[fiddle]]; their sister Linda played guitar. The Aleshire Trio put together their first vaudeville shows at a local silent movie house with Aleshire sometimes performing in blackface.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hillbilly-music.com/artists/story/index.php?id=11034 | title = Lennie Aleshire | publisher = Hillbilly Music.com | author =  | date = | accessdate = 2009-04-19}}</ref>
 
In 1917, Aleshire was drafted for service in [[World War I]], but was excused because he had lost three fingers on his left hand in a [[sawmill]] accident, which led to his nickname, the One Finger Fiddler. He worked for a Kansas City saddlery, a railroad, and played professional baseball for three seasons, but returned to vaudeville, writing the song "Nixa Fling" after working as the chief engineer at a [[Nixa, Missouri]] cheese factory in 1926; the same year he met his wife, Mae.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hillbilly-music.com/artists/story/index.php?id=11034 | title = Lennie Aleshire | publisher = Hillbilly Music.com | author =  | date = | accessdate = 2009-04-19}}</ref> 

Aleshire had a varied vaudeville career: he joined McMae Hill, and the troupe of magician and ventriloquist Professor Sage; and spent two years with the Cauble Brothers Circus traveling through the Midwest. He also worked with Argentinean magician Dawes the Great, performed as a tap dancer, and toured Oklahoma with saxophonist Roy Wrightsman.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hillbilly-music.com/artists/story/index.php?id=11034 | title = Lennie Aleshire | publisher = Hillbilly Music.com | author =  | date = | accessdate = 2009-04-19}}</ref> 

===Lennie and Goo Goo===

In the early 1920s, Aleshire teamed up with his boyhood friend from Springfield, Floyd Rutledge. They developed a [[hillbilly]] musical comedy routine under the names Flash and Whistler, playing traditional as well their homemade instruments which included [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbells]] strapped to their shoes. The pair toured with the [[Orpheum Circuit]] and played at the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] in New York City.<ref>{{citation|first=Loyal|last=Jonas|title=Country Music Humorists and Comedians|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2008|isbn=0252033698}}, p. 141-142</ref> Aleshire also worked the Bert Levy West Coast vaudeville circuit. In 1928, they joined the Weaver Brothers and Elviry act, based in Springfield, and eventually became known as Lennie and Goo Goo. Lennie frequently served as straight man for Rutledge's slow-witted Goo Goo.

Aleshire was also a songwriter; his tune "Iva Waltz" was named for his daughter.  His "My Old Saddle Pal" was sung by [[Gene Autry]] in his 1936 film, ''The Singing Cowboy.'' Aleshire also wrote "Sleepy Time Waltz," "Ozark Waltz," "Blackberry Jam" and "Ukulele Melody." in 1939 he co-wrote "Prarie Reveries" with Buddy Starcher.[[Image:Lennie and Goo Goo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Aleshire (right) with Floyd Rutledge as Lennie and Goo Goo on ''Ozark Jubilee,'' 1955]]

In 1937, Aleshire joined [[WWVA (AM)|WWVA-AM]]'s ''Mountaineer Jamboree'' in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] and worked with banjo player Dale Parker as part of the Rhythm Rangers for about a year. He later worked at [[WLW (AM)|WLW-AM]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; and in 1939 at [[WMMN (AM)|WMMN-AM]] in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]], where he and Rutledge became close friends with [[Grandpa Jones|Louis "Grandpa" Jones]]. Jones formed an act called Grandpa Jones and his Grandsons consisting of Aleshire, Loren Bledsoe and Harold Rensler.<ref>{{citation|first=Ivan M.|last=Tribe|title=Mountaineer Jamboree: Country Music in West Virginia|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=1996|isbn=0813108780}}, p. 95</ref> Aleshire and Rutledge introduced Jones and Ramona Riggins to cowbells, which they adopted.<ref>{{citation|first=Loyal|last=Jonas|title=Country Music Humorists and Comedians|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2008|isbn=0252033698}}, p. 141-142</ref>  

The duo returned to Springfield in the early 1940s and appeared on [[KSGF (AM)|KGBX-AM]], and Aleshire toured with Jones. In August 1944, Aleshire, Rutledge and Parker joined [[KWTO|KWTO-AM]] in Springfield and were featured on the ''Korn's-A-Krackin''' show, carried nationally by the [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual Radio]]. When the station's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' moved to television in 1955, Aleshire and Rutledge went along as Lennie and Goo Goo and were mainstays on the ABC-TV show for five years. "Flash and Whistler" also appeared, but with Slim Wilson teaming up with Rutledge.<ref>''Ozark Jubilee Souvenir Picture Album'' (first edition, 1955)</ref>

In 1955, [[RCA Victor Records|RCA Victor]] released "Ridin' the Fiddle" featuring Aleshire and Parker with King Ganam and his Sons of the West.

When ''Ozark Jubilee'' was canceled in 1960, Aleshire and Rutledge retired in Springfield; Aleshire worked as an expert piano tuner and Rutledge, who years earlier worked briefly as a local policeman, was a taxi driver.<ref>{{citation|first=Loyal|last=Jonas|title=Country Music Humorists and Comedians|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2008|isbn=0252033698}}, p. 141-142</ref> Aleshire and wife Mae had one son, Kenneth Chessnut; and daughter Iva. 

Aleshire died in Springfield, Missouri on October 15, 1987 at age 97 and was interred at Palmetto Cemetery in [[Greene County, Missouri|Greene County]].

Several of Aleshire's and Rutledge's homemade instruments are displayed at the [[Ralph D. Foster|Ralph Foster]] Museum at the [[College of the Ozarks]] in [[Hollister, Missouri]].
