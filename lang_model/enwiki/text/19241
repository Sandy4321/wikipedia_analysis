Despite positive critical response, the song failed to chart due to lack of radioplay and promotion.<ref name=chart>{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Powderfinger |title=Discography Powderfinger|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref>

==Background==
"Nobody Sees" was recorded by Powderfinger for their 2007 album ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' at [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset Sound Studio]], [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in early 2007 with producer [[Rob Schnapf]].<ref name=triplej>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/review/album/s1932552.htm|title=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence|work=Music Reviews|publisher=[[Triple J]]|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> In an interview with [[Jay and the Doctor]] on [[Triple J]] in November 2007, Fanning noted that the song is a "bookend" to Powderfinger's early breakout single "[[Pick You Up]]" from ''[[Double Allergic]]''. He goes on to note that "It's 'who's going to pick you up now?'. Cause I'm not doing it any more."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s2098170.htm|title=Bernard Fanning on Nobody Sees|work=[[Triple J]]|publisher=[[abc.net.au]]|date=[[2007-11-22]]|accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref> Fanning also noted that he considers the song a "spacey ballad".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.take40.com/artists/1312/biography/Powderfinger|title=Powderfinger Biography|publisher=Take40|author=Fanning, Bernard|date=2007|accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref> Though the band had previously released songs featuring piano, they had decided for this album to record with session pianist [[Benmont Tench]], who previously had played for [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], who were one of the inspirations of the album. This was in contrast to previous efforts where piano parts had been performed by Fanning or local Australian pianists. Despite Tench's performance on the song, Fanning appears in the music video as playing piano.<ref name=video />

== Release ==
The single for "Nobody Sees" was officially released on [[1 December]] [[2007]] in Australia. This was announced on [[16 November]] [[2007]], only two weeks prior to its release.<ref name=announce /> The single was released only to the [[iTunes Store]] as a three-song EP including the studio version of the song, a live version of the song and another song from ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence''.

=== Music video ===
[[Image:Nobody Sees MV.PNG|thumb|left|All members of Powderfinger in the video for Nobody Sees, shot from [[Melbourne]] suburb [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]] with Melbourne [[CBD]] in the background.]] The music video for "Nobody Sees" features the entire band of Powderfinger in shot at night-time, in the dark. The group's lead vocalist, [[Bernard Fanning]], who in all previous recordings would play keyboards and piano parts, did not record any of these parts for ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'', as these duties were fulfilled by [[Benmont Tench]]. Though Tench performed the keyboard in the recording of the song, Fanning appears at the keyboard in the music video. The scenes of the band playing are intercut with video shots of a [[DIY#DIY as a subculture|do-it-yourself]] carwash, and five shots of people by themselves. These people are all initially shown being still then as the video progresses, the people are shown performing highly energetic actions in [[slow motion]]. The actions shown include running, falling and jumping. There are instances through [[Ian Haug]]'s guitar solo where [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]]' bass guitar and [[Darren Middleton]]'s electric guitar are also shown in close-up and slow motion.<ref name=video />

===Critical response===
''[[PerthNow]]'' reporter Jay Hanna called "Nobody Sees" "Powderfinger at their devastating best" in his ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' review, commending its overall impact on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,21837668-5005391,00.html |title=CD picks of the week|date=[[2 June]] [[2007]]|last=Hanna|first=Jay |publisher=[[news.com.au]]|work=[[PerthNow]]|accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref> Clayton Bolger of [[All Music Guide]] agreed, calling the song "wondrous" and praising Tench's piano work on it. The song was labeled an "AMG Track Pick".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wc02.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gnfrxz95ldfe |title=(((Dream Days at the Hotel Existence > Overview)))|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]|author=Bolger, Clayton|accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref> ''[[Herald Sun HiT]]'' reviewer Cameron Adams agreed, also commenting that the song was an excellent reminder "of Fanning<U+2019>s prowess as a rock vocalist".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsunhit.com.au/product/dream_days_at_the_hotel_existence_1489161_11722.html |title=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence (Standard edition)|publisher=[[Herald Sun|Herald Sun HiT]]|author=Adams, Cameron|accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref>

''Mess + Noise'' reviewer Andrew Ramadge notes that "Nobody Sees" is validated by ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence's'' controvertial track "[[Black Tears]]", stating that it "would otherwise seem like the usual lovelorn crap [but] can<U+2019>t help but take on a different meaning in the shadow of "Black Tears"."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.messandnoise.com/releases/5679|title=Powderfinger - Dream Days At The Hotel Existence|author=Ramadge, Andrew|publisher=Mess + Noise|accessdate=2008-01-13}}</ref> Shah Xerxes from ''Fasterlouder'' comments that the song is a "heartbreak-inspired and sugary love ballad", noting the songs sadness by referring to it as "an intensely moody number reserved for sadder moments where a little reflection and perspective is required."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/reviews/music/9282/Powderfinger-Dream-Days-At-The-Hotel-Existence.htm|title=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence|author=Xerxes, Shah|date=[[5 June]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2008-01-13|publisher=fasterlouder.com.au}}</ref>

UK reviewer Mike Rea from ''Contact Music'' noted "Nobody Sees" as a "standout song" from the album, which on the whole he rated 8/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=Powderfinger - Dream Days At The Hotel Existence Album Review|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/home.nsf/webpages/powderfingerx03x12x07|date=[[3 December]], [[2007]]|author=Rea, Mike|publisher=Contact Music|accessdate=2008-01-13}}</ref> Sputnikmusic contributor James Bishop was less enthusiastic about the song, noting that it wasn't dissimilar to past Powderfinger works, although noting that it utilized "the variety and flexibility the band is capable of."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=18446 |title=Powderfinger - Dream Days at the Hotel Existence|author=Bishop, James|date=[[13 October]] [[2007]]|publisher=Sputnikmusic|accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref>
