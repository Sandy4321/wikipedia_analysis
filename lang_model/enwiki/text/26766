'''''La gazza ladra''''' ('''''The Thieving Magpie''''') is a '' melodramma'' or [[opera semiseria]] in two acts by [[Gioachino Rossini]]. The libretto was by [[Giovanni Gherardini]] after ''[[La pie voleuse]]'' by JMT Badouin d'Aubigny and Louis-Charles Caigniez.

The opera is best known for its [[overture]], which is notable for its use of [[snare drums]]. 

Rossini was famous for his writing speed, and ''La gazza ladra'' was no exception. It was reported that the producer had to lock Rossini in a room the day before the first performance in order to write the overture. Rossini then threw each sheet out of the window to his [[copyist]]s, who wrote out the full orchestral parts. 

==Performance history==

It was first performed on [[31 May]] [[1817]] at [[La Scala]], [[Milan]]. The opera was revised by Rossini for subsequent productions in [[Pesaro]] in [[1818]], and for the [[Teatro del Fondo]] ([[Naples]]) in [[1819]] and the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] ([[Naples]]) in [[1820]]. He again worked on the music in [[Paris]] in [[1866]].

[[Riccardo Zandonai]] made his own version of the opera for a revival in Pesaro in 1941. Alberto Zedda edited Rossini's original work for publication by the Fondazione Rossini in [[1979]].

== Synopsis ==

Ninetta hopes to marry Giannetto, returning from the war. She tries to shelter her father Fernando Villabella, who has deserted from the army, and is troubled by the attentions of the mayor, Gottardo. A missing spoon and the evidence of Isacco, the pedlar, who has bought a piece of silver from Ninetta to raise money for her father, lead to her accusation and imprisonment. She is tried and found guilty, to be saved from death at the last minute by the discovery of the thief, the thieving magpie of the title. 

==Arias==
The most famous aria in the opera is probably Ninetta's prayer "Deh, tu reggi in tal memento". The soprano aria "Di piacer mi balza cor" and the tenor aria "Vieni fra queste braccia" (interestingly the cabaletta for the duet between Arturo and Elvira from Bellini's I Puritani starts with the exact same words) are two examples of Rossini's brilliant vocal writing.  

==Overture in popular culture==
This overture, beginning and ending in [[Key signature|E major]], though passing through [[Key signature|G major]], makes a few appearances in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', and has also provided the background [[Score (film)|score]] for many [[television]], [[radio]] [[advertising|commercial]]s.

In [[Haruki Murakami]]'s novel [[The Wind Up Bird Chronicles]] the overture is whistled by the waiter carrying the whiskey and ice in the hotel scenes. It is this that allows the main character Toru Okada to recognize his presence.

The music is also used during the "baby-snatching" scene in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'' (1984).

An excerpt of the music was also used for [[Sony]]'s [[Bravia]] TV advertisement campaign.

==Trivia==

In Tintin's [[The Castafiore Emerald]], the opera helps Tintin realize who has stolen Bianca Castafiore's prized emerald.
