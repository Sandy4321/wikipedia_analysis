"'''Speechless'''" is a song performed by [[United States|American]] recording artist [[Lady Gaga]], from her second studio album ''[[The Fame Monster]]''. The song was written by Gaga to convince her father, Joseph Germanotta, to undergo [[Cardiac surgery#Open heart surgery|open-heart surgery]], in order to repair his malfunctioning [[aortic valve]], and as a reminder for her younger fans to appreciate their parents.

The [[1970s in music|1970s]] [[rock music]]-inspired [[Ballad#Pop and rock ballads|power ballad]] received mixed reviews from critics, who praised it for drawing influences from [[Queen (band)|Queen]] "without once feeling like a gimmick,"<ref name="popmatters"/> while criticizing it for "com[ing] off as a fraud."<ref name="slant"/> "Speechless" debuted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at ninety-four for the week of December 12, 2009. Gaga performed the song in a number of live appearances including the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards|2010 Grammys]], [[American Music Awards of 2009|2009 American Music Awards]], [[Royal Variety Performance|The 2009 Royal Variety Performance]] and [[The Monster Ball Tour]], performances being primarily on piano.

==Background==
Gaga explained in a November 2009 interview that her father, Joseph Germanotta, had a heart condition for approximately 15 years. She explained, "He has or he had a bad [[aortic valve]], and his body for a very long time was only pumping a third of the blood that you're supposed to get every time his heart beat." She added, 
<blockquote>
"My mom called me and I was very depressed. I was on tour and I couldn't leave, so I went into the studio and I wrote this song 'Speechless,' and it's about these phone calls. My dad used to call me after he'd had a few drinks and I wouldn't know what to say. I was speechless and I just feared that I would lose him and I wouldn't be there."<ref name="mtv">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1626884/20091123/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Says She Wrote 'Speechless' As 'Plea' To Father|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=2009-11-23|work=''[[MTV]]''|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=2009-11-28}}</ref>
