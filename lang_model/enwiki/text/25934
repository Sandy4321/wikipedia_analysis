'''Para-swimming classification''' is a function-based classification system designed to allow for fair competition in disability swimming. The classes are prefixed with "S" for [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle]], [[Butterfly stroke|butterfly]] and [[backstroke ]]events, "SB" for [[breaststroke]] and "SM" for [[individual medley]] events. Swimmers with physical disabilities are divided into ten classes based on their degree of functional disability. Those with visual impairments are placed in three additional classes. A final class, [[S14 (classification)|S14]], is reserved for swimmers with intellectual disabilities.

Swimming was one of the first organised sports for people with disabilities, and was contested at the [[1960 Summer Paralympics|first Summer Paralympics]] in 1960. Both the rules for the sport and approval of classifications were the responsibility of the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration International de Natation Amateur]] (FINA) until 1992, when the [[International Paralympic Committee]] took over the governance of classification. As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The classification system was originally based on medical criteria, but has since moved to one largely based on functional disability to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is currently moving towards an evidence-based classification system.

==Definition==

Para-swimming classification is based on a system in which functional criteria are assessed. Athletes who have different physical disabilities may compete in the same class so long as their functional impairments are similar.{{sfn|Doll-Tepper|Kr<U+00F6>ner|Sonnenschein|2001|pp=379-392}} In swimming, amputations of the arms below the elbow have a significant impact on functional ability. As a result, swimming classifications differ from athletics classifications.{{sfn|Vanlandewijck|Thompson|2011|p=21}} Swimmers are divided into ten classes based on degree of functional disability: [[S1 (classification)|S1]], [[S2 (classification)|S2]], [[S3 (classification)|S3]],  [[S4 (classification)|S4]], [[S5 (classification)|S5]], [[S6 (classification)|S6]], [[S7 (classification)|S7]], [[S8 (classification)|S8]], [[S9 (classification)|S9]] and [[S10 (classification)|S10]]. The most severely affected are in class S1; these swimmers are normally wheelchair-bound outside the pool. Classes are prefixed with the letter "S" for [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle]], [[Butterfly stroke|butterfly]] and [[backstroke]] events, while those prefixed with "SB" are for [[breaststroke]], and those with "SM" for [[Medley swimming|individual medley]] events.<ref name="Classification Guide"/> This is because different strokes require the use of different muscle groups. In the case of the breaststroke, for example, the hand and the hip play a crucial role.{{sfn|G<U+00F3>mez|Ferrer|Vales|Guti<U+00E9>rrez|1990|p=58}} Because of this, a swimmer may compete in one class for one stroke and a different class for another.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7586684.stm |title=A-Z of Paralympic classification |accessdate=21 August 2012 |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref> It also means that swimmers with cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries and limb deficiencies may compete against each other.<ref name="HigginsBrukner2006">{{cite book|author1=Richard Higgins|author2=Peter Brukner|author3=Bryan English|title=Essential Sports Medicine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-IsuT6tP770C&pg=PA109|accessdate=21 August 2012|date=30 January 2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-1438-7|pages=109}}</ref>  Swimming is the only Paralympic sport where the classification system allows this.{{sfn|Chatard|2003|pp=277}}

There are three additional classes, [[S11 (classification)|S11]], [[S12 (classification)|S12]]  and [[S13 (classification)|S13]], for visually impaired swimmers. The lower number indicates a greater degree of impairment: class S11 swimmers are blind or nearly blind, and compete in blacked-out [[goggles]].<ref name="Classification Guide">{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.org/sites/default/files/document/120716152047682_ClassificationGuide_1.pdf |title=Layman<U+2019>s Guide to Paralympic Classification |accessdate=21 August 2012 |publisher=International Paralympic Committee }}</ref> They each have a "tapper" who uses a pole or "bonker" to warn the swimmer that they are approaching the end of the pool.<ref name="British Paralympic Association">{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympics.org.uk/sports/swimming |title=Paralympic Swimming - overview, rules and classification |accessdate=21 August 2012 |publisher=British Paralympic Association }}</ref>  The visual classifications are based on medical classification, and not on functional mobility.<ref name="Winnick2010-51">{{cite book|author=Joseph P.

==Governance==
Swimming was one of the eight sports contested in the first Paralympics, the [[1960 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Rome]].<ref name="IPC">{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.org/Swimming/About |accessdate=21 August 2012 |publisher=International Paralympic Committee |title=Swimming - About the Sport }}</ref> Both the rules for the sport and for the approval of swimmers' classifications were set by the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration International de Natation Amateur]] (FINA).{{sfn|Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association|1983|pp=9-11}} In 1992, the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) formally became the governing body for disability swimming.{{sfn|DePauw|Gavron|1995|p=43}} Four different sporting bodies, the [[International Blind Sports Federation]] (IBSA), [[International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation|International Sports Federation of the Disabled]] (ISOD), [[ International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation]] (ISMWSF) and the [[Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association]] (CP-ISRA), assisted the IPC in governing swimming at the [[1992 Summer Paralympics]].<ref name=oclc221843378>{{cite book|oclc=221843378|title=The fifteen sports of the Barcelona '92 IX Paralympic Games|location=Barcelona, Spain|publisher=COOB '92, Divisio de Paralympics|date=1992}}</ref> The IPC Classification Code and IPC Swimming govern the classification process.

==History==
The classification system for para-swimming was created during the 1940s, and for much of its early history swimmers were classified based on their medical conditions.{{sfn|Vanlandewijck|Thompson|2011|p=20}} During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the classification system was set up as a series of "handicaps". In an effort to clearly describe disabilities and promote fairness, the number of classifications ballooned. This made organizing competitive events difficult as there were too few people in each classification; international events for people with disabilities were said to have as many winners as competitors.{{sfn|Doll-Tepper|Kr<U+00F6>ner|Sonnenschein|2001|p=320}} At the [[1988 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Seoul]], the number of eligible classes was so great that 60 gold medals were awarded in one swimming event.{{sfn|Steadward|Peterson|1997|pp=159-164}}

In 1974, the [[Disabled of the German State of North Rhine - Westfalia]] (BSNW) developed a swimming classification system that stayed in use until 1982.  This system had seven classifications.  There was a CP class for athletes with [[Spasticity|hemispasticity]] who would also compete in the same class against competitors who were single arm above the elbow amputees, had double-arm [[dysmelia]] type [[ectromelia]], had single arm paralysis or had a fixed shoulder joint.  There was an intellectual disability class called Class J, and a Class H for people with severe disabilities. BSNW classification events included swimming races from 50 to 1500 metres.  The system was later expanded to include nine classes before it was discontinued. The BSNW system did not gain international support, and only was used inside Germany. It was discarded because of a need to have athletes classified for international competitions.{{sfn|Doll-Tepper|Kr<U+00F6>ner|Sonnenschein|2001|p=321}}

In 1983, classification for swimmers with cerebral palsy was governed by CP-ISRA.{{sfn|Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association|1983|p=1}} There were five cerebral palsy classifications.{{sfn|Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association|1983|pp=13-38}} Class 1 competitors could compete in the 25 metre freestyle event with flotation devices with or without flotation devices.{{sfn|Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association|1983|pp=13-15}} Class 2 competitors could compete in the same events, but only against class 2 competitors.{{sfn|Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association|1983|pp=16-18}} That year, 80 to 85 per cent of all competitors with cerebral palsy competed in the same classification in international competitions.{{sfn|Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association|1983|pp=4-6}}

Classification for swimming relied on a points system to assess the severity of physical disability without considering athlete functionality specifically as it applied to the ability to swim a particular stroke. This caused problems because certain types of disability had a greater negative impact on swimming than others, and the point system did not directly address functional ability.  Toto address this, in 1990 point consideration was eliminated for disability types that did not impact performance.{{sfn|G<U+00F3>mez|Ferrer|Vales|Guti<U+00E9>rrez|1990|pp=58-59}} The IPC decided to reduce the number of classifications,{{sfn|Doll-Tepper|Kr<U+00F6>ner|Sonnenschein|2001|p=321}} and to try to fix classification so that competitors could have more certainty in which classification they would compete in before attending an event. This was a major change, as previously, athletes would be classified immediately before, and even during, an event.{{sfn|Doll-Tepper|Kr<U+00F6>ner|Sonnenschein|2001|pp=291-292}} As a result, the number of swimming classifications dropped from 31 at Seoul in 1988 to 10 at the [[1992 Summer Paralympics]] in  Barcelona.{{sfn|Gilbert|Schantz|2009|pp=92}}

Going into the 1992 Summer Paralympics, the International Coordinating Committee and the Technical Committee of the IPC push for a move towards a functional classification system. This came to a head at the November 1989 meeting of the Barcelona Olympics Organising Committee (''Comite Organitzador Olimpic Barcelona'' - COOB), when a discussion started about what events and classifications should be eligible for the Games.  A study by the organising committee and the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]] in the lead-up to the meeting looked at the results of recent international competitions. It proposed a series of classes, based on the competitive results, for use in Barcelona. COOB insisted that such a system be implemented to ensure the sport at the Paralympic Games was serious and competitive, instead of recreational.  The suggestions were implemented for sports such as swimming and athletics. {{sfn|Bailey|2008|pp=103-104}}  The Games were the first ones where swimmers of different types of disabilities competed against each other, swimmers had a guaranteed right to appeal their classification.<ref name=guidetobarcelona>{{cite book|title=Guide to the Barcelona'92 IX Paralympic Games|publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Organizador Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Barcelona'92 Divisi<U+00F3>n de Paral<U+00ED>mpicos|location=Barcelona|publisher=COOB'92, Paralympics Division D.L.|date=1992|isbn=8478682333 |author=Hores Extraordinaries, S.A.|oclc=433443804|page=46}}</ref>

The move to functional classification coincided with the rise of [[sports science]]. The first detailed international swimming sport science project was conducted at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in Seoul. This was followed by a similar project at the [[1992 Summer Paralympics]] in Barcelona. These studies provided an increasingly detailed understanding of the factors involved in high performance swimming.{{sfn|Vanlandewijck|Thompson|2011|pp=264-265}} Henceforth sports science became the driver of both performance and classification.{{sfn|Vanlandewijck|Thompson|2011|p=277}}

Ahead of the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]] in Sydney, changes were made in classification for the breaststroke, bringing the total number of functional classifications down from ten that had competed in Atlantathe to nine. Swimmers who had been classified as SB10 at the [[1996 Summer Paralympics]] in Atlanta opted not to compete in Sydney. Several former SB8 and SB9 swimmers moved down a class to compete, and made the finals in their classifications.{{sfn|Chatard|2003|pp=277-280}} The IPC's Olympian aspiration to became an premier elite international sporting competition still fell short. In Sydney, 561 gold medals were awarded in 18 sports, compared with 300 in 28 sports at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].{{sfn|Bailey|2008|p=220}}

==Classification process==
During the classification process, classifiers evaluate factors including whether a swimmer's physical limitations require him or her to start in the water, and how the swimmer enters the water in competition.{{sfn|Gilbert|Schantz|2009|pp=95}} A two-person panel that includes at least one person with a medical background handles classification at international competitions. Classifiers are required to be familiar with the type of disability they are classifying, whether physical, visual or intellectual. <ref name=ipc-swimmingrules/> 
Classification by national sports bodies mirrors the international classification process, conducted by nationally-recognised IPC classifiers.<ref name=ipc-swimmingrules/> For Australian competitors, for example, classification is managed by the national sport federation, [[Swimming Australia]], with support from the [[Australian Paralympic Committee]].<ref name=managaeclass>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org.au/sports-amp-classification/summer-sports/summer-sports|location=Homebush Bay, New South Wales|publisher=Australian Paralympic Committee|title=Summer Sports|accessdate=19 August 2012|date=2012}}</ref> There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: provisional, national and international.  The first is for club-level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.<ref name=apc-class>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org.au/classification |title=What is Classification? |publisher=Australian Paralympic Committee |date= |accessdate=30 July 2012 |location=Sydney, Australia}}</ref>

Internationally, all classification is handled in English but athletes are allowed to have an interpreter present during the process. Swimmers are required to disclose any medications they regularly use, and provide detailed records of their medical history if a classifier deems them relevant. They are allowed to have someone familiar with their swimming limitations present during the process.  The process includes a physical assessment, observation assessment, and a functional assessment that may include performance in the pool. Swimmers with visual impairment do not require the functional and observational components of assessment.  If a swimmer intentionally misrepresents his or her disability, he or she is barred from the classification process for a minimum of two years, and is unable to compete.<ref name=ipc-swimmingrules/> 

If swimmers do not agree with their classifications, they can appeal through the IPC Board of Appeal on Classification, which is the body recognised by IPC Swimming. Formal processes exist for how to do this in both non-competition and competition periods. <ref name=ipc-swimmingrules/> Classification assessment took roughly 30 to 45 minutes at the 1996 Summer Paralympics.  Classification for blind swimmers  only lasted about 15 minutes.{{sfn|Doll-Tepper|Kr<U+00F6>ner|Sonnenschein|2001|pp=379-392}}

==Classification at the Paralympics==
All disability types were eligible to participate at the 1992 Summer Paralympics. The IPC oversaw classification based on functional disability.{{sfn|DePauw|Gavron|1995|p=128}} General and functional classification took place in the Paralympic Village, with functional swimming classification taking place on the same dates at the Piscines Bernat Picronell.<ref name=guidetobarcelona/> The process became a contentious issue at the Paralympics because of on-the-spot reclassifications that resulted in changes to the competition schedule. On-the-spot classification or re-classification was viewed as a negative aspect of the 1996 Summer Paralympics, and the Paralympic movement overall. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 54 assessments were conducted, resulting in 13 class changes. There was one Paralympic New Status (PNS) protest and two Paralympic Permanent Status (PPS) protests by a national Paralympic committee, with one classification upheld and two denied. Six classification appeals were lodged for swimming at the 2000 Summer Paralympics involving four athletes, resulting in two class changes.{{sfn|Cashman|Darcy|2008|p=152}}

==Future==
Going forward, disability sport's major classification body, the IPC, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system, as opposed to a performance-based system, so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class compared to competitors who train less.<ref name=ipc-history>{{cite web|accessdate=30 July 2012|url=http://www.paralympic.org/Classification/History|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|location=Bonn, Germany|title=Classification History}}</ref>
