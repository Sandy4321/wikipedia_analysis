'''Interstate 280''' (abbreviated '''I-280''') is a {{convert|17.85|mi|km|2|adj=on}} [[Interstate Highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]]. It provides a spur from [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|I-80]] in [[Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey|Parsippany-Troy Hills]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]] to [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], and [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]] (the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] in [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]], [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]]. In Kearny, access is provided toward the [[Holland Tunnel]] and [[Lincoln Tunnel]] to [[New York City]]. The western part of the route runs through suburban areas of Morris and [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]] counties, crossing the [[Watchung Mountains]]. Upon reaching [[The Oranges, New Jersey|The Oranges]], the setting becomes more urbanized and I-280 runs along a depressed alignment before ascending again in Newark. I-280 includes a [[lift bridge]], the [[William A. Stickel Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Passaic River]] between Newark and [[Harrison, New Jersey|Harrison]]. The highway is sometimes called the '''Essex Freeway'''. I-280 interchanges with several roads, including the [[Garden State Parkway]] in [[East Orange, New Jersey|East Orange]] and [[New Jersey Route 21|Route 21]] in Newark.

A part of present-day I-280 in Newark west of the Stickel Bridge was legislated as [[New Jersey Route 25A|Route 25A]] in 1939, a spur of [[New Jersey Route 25|Route 25]] ([[U.S. Route 1/9]]) that was to run from [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] west to Newark. This portion of road would become [[New Jersey Route 58|Route 58]] in 1953 (the Route 58 designation was removed in the 1990s). When the Interstate Highway System was being planned, the [[New Jersey Route 3|Route 3]] freeway was planned to become an Interstate. The [[New Jersey State Highway Department]] favored the Essex Freeway instead between I-80 in Parsippany-Troy Hills to I-95 in Kearny instead. The latter would become the Interstate and be designated I-280. This road was built in the 1960s and be completed west from Newark in 1973. The portion east of Newark to the New Jersey Turnpike opened in 1980. I-280 was once planned to continue east to [[Interstate 78 in New Jersey|I-78]] near the Holland Tunnel but never was extended east of the New Jersey Turnpike. In the 2000s, the Stickel Bridge was reconstructed after the original structure was determined to be structurally deficient.

Past the mountain, the road heads back into suburban areas and comes to the exit for CR 636, where the highway widens to eight lanes here and heads east to an interchange with [[County Route 577 (New Jersey)|CR 577]]. After CR 577, I-280 makes a sharp turn to the south and goes through [[Watchung Mountains|First Watchung Mountain]] in another cut, resuming into suburbs again and heading south-southeast as it comes interchanges at CR 660 and [[County Route 508 Spur (New Jersey)|CR 508 Spur]].<ref name=SLD/><ref name=gmap/>

The terrain becomes urban soon after exit 10, when it enters [[Orange, New Jersey|Orange]]. Here, I-280 narrows back to six lanes and heads onto a depressed alignment with frequent overpasses, running a short distance to the south of [[New Jersey Transit]]<U+2019>s [[Morristown Line]].<ref name=SLD/><ref name=gmap/> Along this portion, the roadway has ramps to Essex Avenue, Day Street, and Center Street.<ref name=SLD/> Continuing into [[East Orange, New Jersey|East Orange]], the freeway passes under more streets as it runs next to the Morristown Line, interchanging with Harrison Street and Clinton Street.  At a full interchange with the [[Garden State Parkway]], I-280 also has access to [[County Route 509 (New Jersey)|CR 509]] and Oraton Parkway.<ref name=SLD/><ref name=gmap/>  Following this junction, the highway widens to eight lanes before becoming ten lanes at the border with [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].<ref name=SLD/>

A green sign with flashing lights on the right side of the road reads Drawbridge ahead 700 feet.]]After crossing under more city streets, the roadway comes to exit 13, a left-side exit and entrance to and from the west accessing 1st Street and a ramp from the east to Orange Street.<ref name=SLD/><ref name=gmap/> At this point, the total amount of lanes on the road decreases from ten to four and I-280 eastbound heads up and over the exit 13 ramps, rejoining the westbound lanes on a bridge over First Street, Orange Street and the [[Newark City Subway]]. As the road returns to surface level and begins to parallel the [[Morris & Essex Lines]] and [[Montclair-Boonton Line]] to the north, an unused bridge carries the western end of the 1954 section of freeway over the railroad to Orange Street east of Duryea Street.<ref name=SLD/><ref name=gmap/><ref name="njdotmap">{{cite map|publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Transportation]]|title=New Jersey Official Highway Map|year=2004}}</ref>  After this, I-280 passes under Clifton Avenue, which it has access to, and Nesbitt Street.

Past CR 508, the freeway narrows to four lanes and comes to the toll plaza for the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]) at exit 15W, at which point I-280 ends. Full access is provided with the Western Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike, which carries through I-95 traffic; ramps to and from the north on the Eastern Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike allow for access to the [[Lincoln Tunnel]] via [[New Jersey Route 495|Route 495]].<ref name=SLD/><ref name=gmap/>

What is now the easternmost part of I-280 was legislated as [[New Jersey Route 25A|Route 25A]] in 1939. This route was a branch of [[New Jersey Route 25|Route 25]] ([[U.S. Route 1/9|US 1/9]]) that ran from [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] west through Kearny and Harrison across the Passaic River and into Newark, connecting with Route 21 and Clifton Avenue.<ref name=25a>ROUTE NO. 25A. Beginning at a point in State Highway Route No. 25 in Jersey City and extending via Jersey City, Kearny, Harrison, across the Passaic river at or near the present Bridge street bridge between the counties of Essex and Hudson to and connecting with State Highway Route No. 21 and Clifton avenue in Newark. </ref> The [[William A.

Around the time the Stickel Bridge opened, the Essex Freeway was planned to connect US 46 in Morris County east to the New Jersey Turnpike in Hudson County, with the intention of alleviating traffic along [[New Jersey Route 10|Route 10]].<ref name="essexfreeway">{{cite journal|date=1948|title=Report on east&ndash;west and Route 10 Freeways and Connections|publisher=New Jersey State Highway Department}}</ref> During planning for the [[Interstate Highway System]] in the 1950s, the [[Bureau of Public Roads]] proposed an Interstate Highway along [[New Jersey Route 3|Route 3]], to the north of Newark.<ref name="yellowbook">{{cite map|  publisher=[[Bureau of Public Roads]] |title=General Location of National System of Interstate Highways in New York, New York|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:New_York,_New_York_1955_Yellow_Book.jpg |year=1955 |accessdate=2009-12-22}}</ref> The [[New Jersey State Highway Department]] countered with the proposed Essex Freeway, which would run from I-80 to the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) via the existing Route 58, saying that the Route 3 corridor "does not meet Interstate standards, and cannot be economically converted to such standards."<ref name=njshd>{{cite book|title= FAI 105 Interstate Highway Corridor: Recommendation Report|publisher=[[New Jersey State Highway Department]] |date=1957}}</ref> The Essex Freeway was selected as the interstate corridor, which was called FAI Corridor 105 before being designated I-280 in 1958.<ref name=njshd/><ref name=nyt3>{{cite news|last=Wright|first=George Cable|title=New Roads with New Numbers Will Parallel Old U.S. Routes |publisher=''The New York Times''|date=September 19, 1958}}</ref>

Construction progressed slowly, starting in 1960 near Orange. There were many obstacles that had to be overcome when constructing I-280. The first was whether to build the highway on an elevated or depressed alignment through urbanized areas of East Orange and Newark. Following opposition to the elevated option, it was decided to build I-280 on a depressed alignment through the area.<ref name=nyt4>{{cite news|last=Honig|first=Milton|title=Depressed Road Backed in Essex|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=April 1, 1959}}</ref><ref name=njsa>{{cite book|title=Public Hearing on the Depression of Essex Freeway|publisher=[[New Jersey State Assembly]] |date=March 2, 1961}}</ref>  In addition, there was an issue of building the road across First Watchung Mountain in West Orange. A [[tunnel]] had initially been considered, although the expense of such a project caused this alternative to be rejected. Instead, a rock cut along a longer route was built through the mountain. Much of the material that was excavated from this section of I-280 and east was removed via a temporary rail line that was built in the center of the right-of-way west to I-80.<ref name=tstc>{{cite book|title=Regional Highways: Status Report|publisher=Tri-State Transportation Commission|date=1962}}</ref><ref name=tstc2>{{cite book|title=Transportation 1985: A Regional Plan|publisher=Tri-State Transportation Commission|date=1966}}</ref> I-280 fully opened west from Newark to I-80 in Parsippany-Troy Hills in 1973.<ref name=nyt5>{{cite news|title=More Tieups for the Motorists; Impossible Task?|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=October 21, 1973|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10A14FB3C5D127A93C3AB178BD95F478785F9&scp=4&sq=%22interstate%20280%22%20open%201973&st=cse|format=Fee required|accessdate=2010-01-07}}</ref> The portion of I-280 east of Newark was planned onto an alignment that would disrupt the fewest homes and would utilize existing railroad and utility right-of-way.<ref name=NJDOT1967>{{cite book|title=Interstate Route 280: Stickel Bridge to I-95|publisher=New Jersey Department of Transportation|date=1967}}</ref> The road east from Newark to the New Jersey Turnpike was completed in the 1980s.<ref name="statefarm">{{cite map|publisher=[[State Farm Insurance]]|title= State Farm Road Atlas |year=1983|cartography=[[Rand McNally]]}}</ref>  In the 1966 plans, I-280 was to continue east to [[Interstate 78 in New Jersey|I-78]] in Jersey City near the Holland Tunnel, following the CR 508 and [[New Jersey Route 7|Route 7]] corridors; this was planned again in the 1970s but never built.<ref name=tstc2/><ref name=tsrpc>{{cite book|title=Maintaining Mobility|publisher=Tri-State Regional Planning Commission|date=1975}}</ref>
