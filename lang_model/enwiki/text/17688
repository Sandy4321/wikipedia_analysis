'''Karuk traditional narratives''' include myths, legends, tales, and oral histories preserved by the [[Karuk]] (Karok) people of the [[Klamath River]] basin of northwestern California.

The published record of Karuk oral literature is an unusually rich one, thanks to the efforts of [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], [[John Peabody Harrington]], William Bright, and others. Karuk narratives, together with those of the neighboring [[Yurok tribe|Yurok]] and [[Hupa]], are distinctive from that of most of California, but show strong influences from the Northwest Coast region. (''See also'' [[Traditional narratives (Native California)]].)
