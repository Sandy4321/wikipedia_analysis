He is most widely known as the creator of ''[[Sam & Max]]'', an independent comic book series about a pair of anthropomorphic animal vigilantes and private investigators, for which Purcell received an [[Eisner Award]] in 2007. Since being a comic, the series has grown to incorporate an animated television series and several [[video game]]s. A graduate of the [[California College of the Arts|California College of Arts and Craft]], Purcell began his career creating comic strips for the college newsletter. He performed freelance work for [[Marvel Comics]] and Fishwrap Productions before publishing his first ''Sam & Max'' comic in 1987. Purcell was hired by [[LucasArts]] as an artist and animator in 1988, working on several titles within [[LucasArts adventure games|the company's adventure games era]].

Purcell collaborated with [[Nelvana]] to create a ''Sam & Max'' television series in 1997, and briefly worked as an animator for [[Industrial Light & Magic]] after leaving LucasArts.  He is currently employed in the story development department at [[Pixar]]. His main work for the animation studio has been with the 2006 film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', the 2012 film ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'' and spin-off materials such as [[Short subject|shorts]] and video games. Despite his employment with Pixar, Purcell has continued to work with comic books and came together with [[Telltale Games]] in 2005 to bring about new series of ''Sam & Max'' video games.

==Career==
===Early career===
Purcell entered into a career with comic books while an undergraduate at the [[California College of Arts and Crafts]] in 1980; he produced comic strips for the weekly newsletter. These strips featured Sam and Max, an anthropomorphic dog and rabbit duo who work as vigilantes and private investigators; Purcell drew the first strip the night before the deadline. Following his graduation in 1982,<ref name="alumnotecca">{{cite web| url= http://www.cca.edu/alumni/profiles/hundred | title=100+ Alumni of Note |publisher= [[California College of the Arts]]| accessdate= 2011-05-31| quote=Steve Purcell ('82): cartoonist and creator of Sam & Max.}}</ref> Purcell became involved in freelance illustration, working briefly for [[Marvel Comics]], [[Chaosium]], and on Steven Moncuse's ''[[Fish Police]]'' series. Moncuse approached Purcell about the possibility of another comic book series to accompany his well-performing ''Fish Police'' series in 1987.<ref name="Telltale 1b">{{cite web|url=http://www.telltalegames.com/summerofsamandmax/history/history1b/|title=The Early Years (part 2)|work=The History of Sam & Max|publisher=[[Telltale Games]]|date=2007-06-12|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref> Purcell agreed, and wrote his first feature length comic using the characters of Sam and Max. The 32-page comic was published by Fishwrap Productions in 1987.<ref name="ACG">{{cite web |url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/304/|title=Steve Purcell <U+2013> Interview| work=Adventure Classic Gaming|first=Erik-Andr<U+00E9>|last=Vik Mamen|coauthors=Jong, Philip|date=2008-01-01|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref> The comic contained two ''Sam & Max'' stories: "Monkeys Violating the Heavenly Temple", a name that Purcell found on a [[firework]] and thought was appropriate; and "Night of the Gilded Heron-Shark". Purcell published a further story in a 1987 issue of ''[[Critters]]'' titled "Night of the Cringing Wildebeest". These three stories established the basics for Purcell's future work with the characters.<ref name="Telltale 1b"/>

===LucasArts===
Purcell was hired by [[LucasArts]], then known as Lucasfilm Games, as an [[animator]] in 1988, but was subsequently [[Layoff|laid off]] when the project he was working on was canceled.<ref name="Telltale 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.telltalegames.com/summerofsamandmax/history/history2/|title=The Golden Era|work=The History of Sam & Max|publisher=[[Telltale Games]]|date=2007-06-26|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref> Despite being laid off, he was rehired to produce artwork for the [[graphic adventure game]] ''[[Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders]]''.<ref name="World of MI">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofmi.com/features/interview/purcell.php|title=Interviews: Steve Purcell|work=The World of Monkey Island|publisher=LF Network, LLC|date=2006-04-11|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref> Purcell was later commissioned to create the cover artwork for ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'' and the first two ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' games and researched into [[whip]]s for the adventure game version of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. He worked with animation in several LucasArts adventure games, published three more ''Sam & Max'' comic books during this time, and began creating brief comic strips for LucasArts' quarterly newsletter, ''The Adventurer''.<ref name="Gamasutra">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=6021|title=Playing Catch-Up: Steve Purcell|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|first=Frank|last=Cifaldi|coauthors=Carless, Simon| date= 2005-07-25 |accessdate= 2009-02-10}}</ref> The characters eventually became involved as training material for LucasArts programmers working with [[SCUMM]], the core [[game engine]] used by LucasArts adventure games; Purcell created versions of Sam and Max in their office for new programmers under [[Ron Gilbert]] to practice on.<ref name="Telltale 2"/> References to the characters were occasionally made in unrelated LucasArts adventure games as a clandestine appearance in backgrounds. Purcell wrote the six-issue comic book series ''[[Defenders of Dynatron City]]'' for Marvel Comics in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixnmojo.com/php/site/gamedb.php?gameid=64|title=Defenders of Dynatron City|work=The International House of Mojo| publisher= LF Network, LLC|date=2004-09-12|accessdate=2009-02-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070819192142/http://mixnmojo.com/php/site/gamedb.php?gameid=64 |archivedate = August 19, 2007}}</ref>

After a positive reaction to the ''Sam & Max'' strips in ''The Adventurer'' and wanting to expand into other franchises following ''Maniac Mansion'' and ''Monkey Island'', LucasArts offered to create a graphic adventure game on the characters in 1992.<ref name="retro review">{{cite journal|title =''Sam & Max Hit the Road''| journal=[[gamesTM|gamesTM Retro]]|volume=1|pages= 128<U+2013>129|location=United Kingdom|publisher=Highbury Entertainment}}</ref> ''[[Sam & Max Hit the Road]]'' was conceived and developed by a small team headed by Purcell, [[Sean Clark]], [[Michael Stemmle]] and Collette Michaud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=6023|title=''Sam & Max Hit the Road'': Credits|publisher=[[Allgame]]|first=Steve|last=Honeywell|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref> Purcell decided to base the game on one of his earlier ''Sam & Max'' stories, the 1988 story "On The Road".<ref name="Telltale 2"/> In 1995, Purcell combined all published ''Sam & Max'' printed media into a 154-page paperback compilation titled ''Sam & Max: Surfin' the Highway''.<ref name="Telltale 3">{{cite web|url=http://www.telltalegames.com/summerofsamandmax/history/history3/|title=Sam & Max Hit it Big|work=The History of Sam & Max|publisher=[[Telltale Games]]|date=2007-07-10|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref> After producing the cover artwork for ''[[Herc's Adventures]]'' and [[concept art]] for ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]'', Purcell left LucasArts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1864|title=''Herc's Adventures'': Credits|publisher=[[Allgame]]|first=Jonathan|last=Sutyak|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/curse-of-monkey-island/credits|title=Game Credits for ''The Curse of Monkey Island''|publisher=[[MobyGames]]|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref>

===Later work===
Purcell joined with story editor Dan Smith from Canadian studio [[Nelvana]] to create an animated television series of ''Sam & Max'' in 1996. The result was the 1997 series ''[[The Adventures of Sam & Max: Freelance Police]]'', broadcast on [[Fox Kids]] in the United States, [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] in Canada and [[Channel 4]] in the United Kingdom. Purcell wrote the jokes for each installment of the 24 episode series, and wrote the scripts for four episodes. Despite the toned down violence and mild profanity common in the ''Sam & Max'' franchise due to the target audience of children, Purcell was content that the characters maintained their moral ambiguity. Some parent groups in the United States attempted to have the series pulled from networks due to content issues; Purcell was pleased that they "had managed to ruffle some feathers along the way".<ref name="Telltale 3"/> Two ''Sam & Max'' comic strips appeared in Fox's ''Totally Fox Kids Magazine'' in 1998 to accompany the series; other ''Sam & Max'' strips appeared in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' and ''[[Oni Press|Oni Double Feature]]''. During the development of the television series in 1997, Purcell co-authored and illustrated the ''[[Hellboy Christmas Special]]'' with [[Mike Mignola]] and [[Gary Gianni]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/97-666/Hellboy-Christmas-Special|title=Hellboy Christmas Special profile|publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]]|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref> After the conclusion of the ''Sam & Max'' animated series, Purcell was briefly employed by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] to work on digital effects for a film version of ''[[Frankenstein]]''. Despite his work, the project was canceled; Purcell believes that some of the development work morphed into ILM's contributions to ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]''.<ref name="World of MI"/> While at ILM, Purcell was involved in a project to create an animated film based on ''Monkey Island'';<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scummbar.com/index.php?newssniffer=readcomment&news=808|title=''Monkey Island'' movie art?|work=SCUMM Bar|publisher=LF Network, LLC|date=2005-01-09|accessdate=2010-01-21}}</ref> while the project did not reach fruition, Purcell began posting concept art he had produced for the film on his personal blog several years after.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Tales from Monkey Island|year=2009|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|issue=70|first=Ashley|last=Day|page=p. 35}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofmi.com/comments.php?type=news&id=1255&action=read|title=Steve Purcell artwork|work=The World of Monkey Island|publisher=LF Network, LLC|date=2007-06-07|accessdate=2010-01-21}}</ref>

===Pixar and Telltale Games===
After the brief stint at ILM, Purcell moved to [[Pixar]].<ref name="Gamasutra"/> Despite being employed by Pixar, Purcell acted as an advisor in the development of ''[[Sam & Max: Freelance Police]]'', a sequel to ''Sam & Max Hit the Road'' that began development in 2002 under LucasArts. Purcell provided Michael Stemmle's development team with concept art and assisted in the creation of the game's plot.<ref name="Telltale 4">{{cite web|url=http://www.telltalegames.com/summerofsamandmax/history/history4b|title=After Darkness Comes Light|publisher=[[Telltale Games]]|work=The History of Sam & Max|date=2007-07-24|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref> Despite its smoothly proceeding development, LucasArts abruptly canceled the project in March 2004. Purcell was unable to understand why development halted; he described himself as "frustrated and disappointed" at the decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/newsitem.php?id=463|title=Steve Purcell comments on ''Sam & Max 2''{{'}}s cancellation|publisher=[[Adventure Gamers]]|first=Jake|last=Rodkin|date=2004-03-05|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref>

At Pixar's story development department, Purcell contributed screenplay material and voice work for the 2006 film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', and designed the character of the Screaming Banshee in the short ''[[Mater and the Ghostlight]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/290414|title=''Cars'' Overview|publisher=[[Allmovie]]|first=Jason|last=Buchanan|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite video |people=Crystal, Billy; Goodman, John|date=2004 |title=Pixar Short Films Collection <U+2013> Volume 1 |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Pixar]] |location=United States}}</ref> Providing scripts and voice work for three games based on ''Cars'', Purcell became involved with [[THQ|THQ's]] video game adaptations of Pixar films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=49405|title=''Cars'': Credits|publisher=[[Allgame]]|first=Gracie|last=Leach|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=49345|title=''Cars: Radiator Springs Adventures'': Credits|publisher=[[Allgame]]|first=Gracie|last=Leach|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/ps3/disneypixar-cars-mater-national-championship/credits|title=Game Credits for Disney/Pixar ''Cars: Mater-National Championship''|publisher=[[Mobygames]]|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref> Purcell was credited for involvement with Pixar's 2007 film ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'';<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1808490293/cast|title=''Ratatouille'' (2007) <U+2013> Cast and Credits|publisher=[[Yahoo!

In 2005, LucasArt's license with Purcell that gave them the right to produce games based on the ''Sam & Max'' franchise expired; this allowed Purcell to take the franchise to [[Telltale Games]], a new company formed by members of Stemmle's development team. A new [[Episodic video game|episodic]] series of ''Sam & Max'' games, ''[[Sam & Max Save the World]]'', was announced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/sammaxep1/news.html?sid=6133326&mode=all|title=''Sam & Max'' resurrected|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|first=Brendan|last=Sinclair|date=2005-11-15|accessdate=2008-12-06}}</ref> Purcell's work on the new game series encompassed design and writing, as well as the design of the game's cover artwork; despite his work, Purcell described it as "minimal" due to the effectiveness of the team.<ref name="Joystiq">{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/03/06/joystiq-interviews-sam-and-max-creator-steve-purcell/|title=Joystiq interviews Sam & Max creator, Steve Purcell|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|first=Ludwig|last=Kietzmann|date=2007-03-06|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref> At the same time, Purcell began a ''Sam & Max'' [[webcomic]] hosted on the Telltale Games website. The webcomic ran for twelve issues, and it earned Purcell an [[Eisner Award]] for "Best Digital Comic" when the comic finished its run in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_eisners_07win.shtml|title=2007 Eisner Awards Shine Spotlight on Comic Industry<U+2019>s Best|publisher=[[Comic-Con International]]|accessdate=2008-12-04|year=2007}}</ref> Purcell assisted with design and writing when ''[[Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space]]'' began development in 2007.

==Personal life==
Purcell grew up in [[California]], where he still resides. In a 2000 interview, Purcell said that he had been drawing all his life, and that he still possesses drawings from when he was three years old.<ref name="SM interview">{{cite web|url=http://samandmax.net/index.php?section=historyfaq&page=interview1&id=1|archivedate=2004-08-22|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040822191151/samandmax.net/index.php?section=historyfaq&page=interview1&id=1|title=Interview!|work=Sam & Max: The Unofficial Website|first=Jake|last=Rodkin|coauthors=Grubaugh, Sebastian|year=2000|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref> Noting that his line of creative work depends entirely on things one learns, Purcell describes himself as an "average" student at school, but wishing that he had tried harder at some classes.<ref name="SM interview"/> After studying film-making courses at junior college, Purcell enrolled in the [[California College of the Arts|California College of Arts and Crafts]] to read fine art; he now holds a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|bachelor's degree]] there. Purcell befriended [[Mike Mignola]], and later [[Art Adams]] while at the college.<ref name="Telltale 1b"/> Citing the [[Marx Brothers]], [[Peter Sellers]] and [[Monty Python]] as among his interests, he says that he is inspired by "creative people who have made their seemingly most self-indulgent artistic whims into a career".<ref name="SM interview"/> During the development of ''Sam & Max Hit the Road'' in 1993, Purcell married fellow lead designer Collette Michaud; the wedding cake was topped with figurines of Sam and Max as a bride and groom.<ref name="Telltale 2"/> Purcell has two sons.<ref name="ACG"/>

The characters of Sam and Max were created in Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around the idea of a dog and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters mix up each other's names, shoot at each other and mock the way in which they had been drawn, Steve, in a case of [[sibling rivalry]], would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop the characters in his own way.<ref name="Telltale 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.telltalegames.com/summerofsamandmax/history/history1|title=The Early Years (part 1)|work=The History of Sam & Max|publisher=[[Telltale Games]]|date=2007-06-12|accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite video |people=Purcell, Steve |date=2008-03-11|title=A COMIC-CONversation With Steve Purcell!!! |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Shout!
