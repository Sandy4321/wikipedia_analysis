The '''infraspinatous fascia''' is a dense fibrous membrane, covering the [[Infraspinatous muscle]] and fixed to the circumference of the [[infraspinatous fossa]]; it affords attachment, by its deep surface, to some fibers of that muscle. 

It is intimately attached to the [[deltoid fascia]] along the over-lapping border of the [[Deltoideus]].
