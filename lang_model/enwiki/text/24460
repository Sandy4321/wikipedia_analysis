==College playing career==
Hill earned an [[athletic scholarship]] to Northeast Louisiana University (now the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]]), then a [[Division I-AA]] school, playing [[wide receiver]] on the [[Louisiana<U+2013>Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana Indians football team]]. In 1983, while a college freshman, Hill's father died of [[stomach cancer]]. Six weeks later, Hill's mother had an [[aneurysm]] and later a [[stroke]] that left her partially paralyzed and unable to speak. Hill left Northeastern Louisiana and returned to Arkadelphia to help take care of his mother, who died in 2009.<ref name=SFC081901/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Demirel|first1=Evin|title=Mary Hill; Valued education, God, serving others|url=http://epaper.ardemgaz.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:ArticleToMail&Type=text/html&Path=ArDemocrat/2009/08/22&ID=Ar01601|website=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette|accessdate=June 5, 2014|date=August 22, 2009}}</ref>

Hill transferred to [[Ouachita Baptist University]] in Arkadelphia. He worked in retail and joined the [[Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Army ROTC]] for financial support.

==Military career==
During the early years of his coaching career, Hill's career was briefly interrupted by military service during the [[Gulf War]], where he was a transportation officer. He coordinated the transportation of rations and supplies to American troops participating in Desert Shield and Desert Storm; during this time he was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] and received the [[Bronze Star]] and Commendation Medal.<ref name=SFC081901/><ref name=AB2006/>

===Early coaching career (1987<U+2013>1988)===
After graduating from Ouachita Baptist University, Hill returned to Arkadelphia High School in 1987 as an assistant football coach.

===Arkansas (1989<U+2013>2000)===
Hill transferred to the [[University of Arkansas]] in 1989 and became a graduate assistant for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football]] team. In the spring of 1990, Hill returned to Northwestern State University and served as quarterbacks and wide receivers coach for that term. While completing his master's degree at Northwestern State, Hill continued to be a volunteer assistant coach for Arkansas in 1990 and 1991. Hill graduated from Northwestern State with a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[student affairs|student personnel services]] in 1991.<ref name="SJSU bio"/> 

In the spring of 1992, Hill served as wide receivers coach for [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State University]]. He later returned to the University of Arkansas as wide receivers coach for the 1992 regular season.<ref name="SJSU bio"/> Immediately after losing the season opener to [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I-AA]] [[The Citadel Bulldogs football|The Citadel]], Arkansas athletic director [[Frank Broyles]] fired head coach [[Jack Crowe]]. Fellow assistant coach [[Houston Nutt]] reflected on that time in the season: "The thing that was so tough that year was the uncertainty you felt every single day. As an assistant, you're thinking, 'Am I going to be here after this season? Am I going to have to get another job?'"<ref name="familiar feeling">{{cite web|last1=Holt|first1=Bob|title=Familiar feeling|url=http://epaper.ardemgaz.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:ArticleToMail&Type=text/html&Path=ArDemocrat/1998/10/30&ID=Ar00261|website=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette|accessdate=June 5, 2014|date=October 30, 1998}}</ref> In 2012, Hill said that Broyles "felt a change was necessary not so much for the team, but for public perception" after the loss to The Citadel.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Holt|first1=Bob|title=<U+2018>One bad day<U+2019>; 20 years after he was fired following a loss to The Citadel, Jack Crowe isn<U+2019>t bitter|url=http://epaper.ardemgaz.com/WebChannel/ShowStory.asp?Path=ArDemocrat/2012/08/31&ID=Ar02103|accessdate=June 5, 2014|work=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette|date=August 31, 2012}}</ref> Hill remained on the staff of interim head coach [[Joe Kines]] and was retained by permanent head coach [[Danny Ford]] in 1993.<ref name="Whoever said change is good">{{cite web|last1=Holt|first1=Bob|title=Northwest Insider: Whoever said change is good wasn't a coach|url=http://epaper.ardemgaz.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:ArticleToMail&Type=text/html&Path=ArDemocrat/1998/08/30&ID=Ar00120|website=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette|accessdate=June 5, 2014|date=August 30, 1998}}</ref> Hill continued to be wide receivers coach until 2000.<ref name="Arkansas bio">{{cite web|title=Fitz Hill|url=http://www.hogwired.com/tablestory.asp?Home_ID=2&Story_ID=251|publisher=Arkansas Razorbacks|accessdate=June 5, 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010116084400/http://www.hogwired.com/tablestory.asp?Home_ID=2&Story_ID=251|archivedate=January 16, 2001}}</ref> In 1998, under new head coach [[Houston Nutt]], Hill added recruiting coordinator to his duties.<ref name="Whoever said change is good"/> In 2000, Hill became assistant head coach as well.<ref name="SJSU bio"/>

In 1997, Hill received his [[Doctor of Education|Ed.D.]] from Arkansas; his [[doctoral thesis]] examined the "barriers restricting employment opportunities" for black coaches.<ref>{{citation|title=Examining the barriers restricting employment opportunities relative to the perceptions of African American football coaches at NCAA Division I-A colleges and universities|url=http://library.uark.edu/record=b1757634~S1|author=Hill, O.

===San Jose State (2001<U+2013>2004)===
In December 2000, Hill was hired as the head coach for the [[San Jose State University]] [[San Jose State Spartans football|Spartans football team]]. Hill became the 17th black coach in Division I-A football and one of the few I-A coaches with a doctorate.<ref name=ESPN2011>Richard Lapchick, [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/commentary/news/story?id=6492198 Fitz Hill still recruiting, coaching, leading], ESPN.com, May 6, 2011, accessed August 1, 2013.</ref> When Hill was hired, the San Jose State athletic department was in financial trouble and ranked 106th out of 114 Division I-A schools in football home game attendance, with an average attendance of about 12,000.<ref name="Merc 2001-08-13">{{cite web|last1=Emmons|first1=Mark|title=A voice for black coaches|url=http://www.bayarea.com/c/category/sports_and_recreation/college/san_jose_state/docs/mercurynews/012204.htm|website=San Jose Mercury News|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010827003404/http://www.bayarea.com/c/category/sports_and_recreation/college/san_jose_state/docs/mercurynews/012204.htm|archivedate=August 27, 2001|date=August 13, 2001}}</ref><ref name=SFC081901/> The financial issues forced San Jose State to schedule numerous road games against schools in [[Automatic Qualifying conference|BCS Automatic Qualifier conferences]] during Hill's tenure, including [[USC Trojans football|USC]], [[Florida Gators football|Florida]], and [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]].<ref name="Fitz Hill is gone, but not his mark">{{cite web|last1=Miedema|first1=Lawrence|title=Fitz Hill is gone, but not his mark|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_4857144|website=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=June 5, 2014|date=December 17, 2006}}</ref>

==Executive career==
Hill returned to Arkansas in December 2004, becoming executive director of the Ouachita Opportunity Fund at Ouachita Baptist University as well as co-founder and co-general manager of Life Champs Sports, a youth sports program headquartered in Little Rock.<ref name=IA071111>Lindsey Irvin, [http://www.inarkansas.com/25579/meet-the-neighbors-dr-fitz-hill-of-little-rock Meet the Neighbors: Dr. Fitz Hill of Little Rock], InArkansas.com, July 11, 2011, accessed August 1, 2013.</ref><ref name=AB2006/> From 2004 to 2006, he was a visiting scholar and research associate at the [[University of Central Florida]]'s DeVos Sport Business Management Program.<ref name=ESPN2011/> During his time at San Jose State, Hill created the [[Delta Classic]], a [[college football]] game between [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black colleges]] held annually in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].<ref name=DC>[http://www.deltaclassic4literacy.org/about.html About Delta Classic 4 Literacy], Delta Classic 4 Literacy, accessed August 2, 2013.</ref> While raising support for the Delta Classic, Hill contacted Arkansas Baptist College (ABC) to speak with their president and found out they, at the time, did not have one. After giving his presentation on the Delta Classic to the school's [[board of trustees]], they offered him the position of school president and he accepted.<ref name="Father Fitz">{{cite web|last1=Webb|first1=Kane|title=Father Fitz|url=http://epaper.ardemgaz.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:ArticleToMail&Type=text/html&Path=ArDemocrat/2007/10/28&ID=Ar10300|website=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette|accessdate=June 5, 2014|date=October 28, 2007}}</ref>

At the time Hill took over at ABC, there was no salary budgeted to pay him and the school's enrollment had dipped to fewer than 200 students; the college was in danger of being stripped of its accreditation by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]]. In five years, the school grew enrollment to 1,100 students, its budget $2 million to nearly $20 million, and kept its accreditation; Hill then drew a salary.<ref name=ESPN2011/>

==Personal life==

Hill is a devout [[Christian]].<ref name=ESPN2011/> He married fellow Ouachita Baptist classmate, Cynthia Hill; she was born in [[Italy]] to an American military serviceman and an Italian mother. She received her doctorate not long after her husband and is currently in charge of Institutional Advancement at ABC. The couple has three children.<ref name="SJSU bio"/>
