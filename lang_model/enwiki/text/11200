[[Colombia]] loses 2,000km<sup>2</sup> of forest annually to [[deforestation]], according to the [[United Nations]] in 2003, although some suggest that this figure is as high as 3,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2> due to [[illegal logging]] in the region.<ref name="Monga"> {{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/20colombia.htm|title=Tropical rainforests: Colombia|publisher=Mongabay.com|accessdate=August 24|accessyear=2008}}</ref>
Deforestation results mainly from logging for timber, small-scale agricultural ranching, mining, development of energy resources such as hydro-electricity, infrastructure, [[cocaine]] production, and farming.<ref name="Monga"/> Around one-third of the country's original forest has been removed as a result of deforestation.

Deforestation in Colombia is mainly targeted at primary rainforest which covers more than 80% of the country. This has a profound ecological impact in that the country is extremely rich in [[biodiversity]] with 10% of the world's species, making it the second most biologically diverse country on Earth.<ref name="Monga"/>

==Causes and effects==
One of the main causes of deforestation in Colombia is the national Plan Pacifico which is intended to raise revenue to develop the economy.<ref name="Edu"> {{cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/TED/coldefor.htm|title=Deforestation in Colombia|publisher =Trade and Environment Database of the American Education|accessdate=August 24|accessyear=2008}}</ref> The plan includes exploitation of the country's rainforests for the extraction of precious natural resources for exportation.<ref name="ThinkQuest"> {{cite web|url=http://www.tqnyc.org/NYC052139/South%20America.htm|title=Deforestation in Colombia|publisher=Think Quest Team|accessdate=August 24|accessyear=2008}}</ref>
[[Image:President Virgilio Barco.png|thumb|left|150px|President [[Virgilio Barco Vargas]] initiated the Plan Pacifico development scheme to develop the economy of Colombia's Pacific Coast in the late 1980s with a major impact on forest]]
Under the regime of President [[Virgilio Barco Vargas]] (1986-1990), a development scheme was initiated involving $4.5 billion in investments to develop the Colombian Pacific Coast in Choco Department. Around 2.2% of the total forest area in Colombia began to be removed each year for wood and to make paper or to provide the clearings needed for palm plantations and agricultural production and commercial shrimp farming.<ref name="ThinkQuest"/> In a concerted effort to enhance trade, Plan Pacifico has attempted to complete the 54 kilometer missing section of the [[Pan-American Highway]] between [[Colombia]] and [[Panama]] spanning the ecologically rich [[Darien Gap]].<ref name="Edu"/>   The construction of the Puente Terrestre Inter-Oceanico (PTI), the land bridge between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans near Panama, consisting of a railway, road, canal, and oil pipeline has had a major impact on the environment and forest removal in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/projects/mandala/TED/pacifico.htm|title=Plan Pacifico in the Choc<U+00F3> Region of Colombia|publisher=TED Case Studies|accessdate=August 24|accessyear=2008}}</ref> Other plans for road construction throughout Choc<U+00F3> which intended to catapult economic production in Colombia have had unintended negative consequences.
The economic potential of the region has resulted in international competition for access to the Colombian market with transnational corporations taking an active role in Colombia's deforestation through petroleum and mineral extraction in coordination with the national plan.<ref name="International"> {{cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/TED/projects/tedcross/xdefor21.htm|title=Deforestation:An International Analysis|publisher=TED Case Studies of the American Education|accessdate=August 24|accessyear=2008}}</ref> 
The Japanese government has directly financed the construction of a road which links the Pacific coast to inland forest regions to facilitate trade.<ref name="International"/>

Deforestation has been responsible for the erosion of riverbanks which have affected the levels of river beds, which has had negative impacts on aquatic life and fish stocks as well as on transportation and navigation because of silting.<ref name="ThinkQuest"/>

The current administration is expanding [[palm oil]] and [[sugar cane]] production by encouraging large scale plantations, and demand for agrofuels has also had a significant impact on Colombia's forests, biodiversity, and local communities. Exploitation of communities through palm oil expansion has often resulted in violence and abuse of [[human rights in Colombia|human rights]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/bulletin/28/Colombia.html|date=November 28 1999|title=Colombia: violence and deforestation in the Choco region|publisher=World Rainforest Movement|accessdate=August 24|accessyear=2008}}</ref> NGOs working in Colombia have recorded 113 deaths as a result of land-based conflicts over palm oil production in Curvarad<U+00F3> and Jiguamiand<U+00F3> River Basin in the Choc<U+00F3> region, where paramilitaries associated with plantation companies have been accused of exploiting lands collectively held by Afro-Colombian communities. The coastal lowland forests of Choc<U+00F3> province that are most affected by palm oil production are amongst the most biodiverse forests on Earth, home to 7,000 to 8,000 species, with over 2,000 endemic plant species and 100 endemic bird species. 

The biologically rich forests of Colombia's Pacific Coast have also been affected by [[gold mining]] and [[Cocoa production in Colombia|cocoa production]]. One figure obtained in the mid-1990s estimated that gold mining activities were responsible for the clearance of 800 square kilometres of forest per year in Colombia, in addition to increased siltation in rivers and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] contamination.<ref name="Monga"/>

The cultivation, production, and distribution of illegal narcotics in Colombia has also had a profound impact on deforestation and loss of biodiversity in the country.<ref name="Edu"/> An estimated {{convert|100000|acre|km2}} are allocated each year to grow coca, [[marijuana]], and [[opium]] poppies resulting in the direct removal of primary forest to provide for the trade.<ref name="ThinkQuest"/> Particularly affected are the forests of the Colombian [[Andes]] where at least 73% of this precious ecosystem has been affected by drug cultivation and migration of people for illegal resource extraction.<ref name="ThinkQuest"/> The area is of prime importance for Colombia's water supply, and a disruption of soils and the water table arising from the removal of forest cover is of major concern to the climatic patterns of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/16220/story.htm|date=June 3 2002|title=Andes deforestation threatens Colombia's water|publisher=Planet Ark|accessdate=August 24|accessyear=2008}}</ref>

Poverty and inequality in land tenure and use also play a role in deforestation in Colombia. Privileged landowners who make up just 3% of Colombia's population own over 70% of arable land, while 57% of the poor farmers barely survive on just 2.8% of the land.<ref name="ThinkQuest"/> Inequality and poverty in Colombia are worsened by the fact that the country is striving to develop its market economy with cash crops for export to generate income, increasing the marginalizion of farmers at a local level.<ref name="Edu"/>

==Response==
Colombia has made great strides in protecting vast areas of land from deforestation through the creation of national parks; however, enforcement is by no means completely effective. The sale of protected land though government corruption is not uncommon.<ref name="IER"> International Environmental Reporter, No.69, (January 25, 1995), Retrieved on August 24, 2008</ref> One notorious example is the attempted government conversion of the Tayrona forest on Colombia's Atlantic Coast into a national park in 1980. When the [[Tayrona National Natural Park]] was established, 90% of the land was under government control, but by 1990, 80% of the park had been expropriated through illegal logging and selling of land illegally by corrupt administrators.<ref name="IER"/>
