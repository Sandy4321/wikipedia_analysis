The '''Daruvar Agreement''' ([[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Daruvarski sporazum'') was a document negotiated by [[Croatia]]n and [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) local authorities in the [[United Nations Protected Area (UNPROFOR)|United Nations Protected Area (UNPA)]] for Western Slavonia, also known as Sector West on 18 February 1993, during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. The agreement provided for the improvement of water and electrical power supply, the return of refugees to their homes and the opening of transport routes spanning Sector West and connecting [[Croatian Army]]-controlled areas near towns of [[Nova Gradi<U+0161>ka]] and [[Novska]]. It also provided a framework for the further improvement of living conditions of the population both in the Croatian- and RSK-controlled portions of Sector West. The agreement was named after [[Daruvar]], the site of its signing.

The Daruvar Agreement, mediated by the head of the [[United Nations]] (UN) Civil Affairs in Sector West Gerard Fischer, was negotiated in secrecy. When the central RSK authorities in [[Knin]] learned of the arrangement, the signatories on behalf of the RSK were sacked from their official posts and arrested. The agreement itself was labeled as treasonous by the central RSK authorities. Fischer and other UN officials, who were involved in mediation of the agreement, were criticised by the UN for being excessively assertive in the matter. Fischer soon left the area.

==Background==
In November, Croatia, Serbia and the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (''Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija'' <U+2013> JNA) agreed upon the [[Vance plan]], designed to halt [[1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia|combat operations]] in the [[Croatian War of Independence]] and allow the negotiation of a political settlement. Besides the ceasefire, the plan entailed protection of civilians in specific areas, designated as [[United Nations Protected Area (UNPROFOR)|United Nations Protected Areas]] (UNPAs), and UN peacekeepers in Croatia<U+2014>[[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR).{{sfn|Armatta|2010|pp=194<U+2013>196}} The ceasefire came into effect on 3 January 1992.{{sfn|Marijan|2012|p=103}} Shortly after the Vance plan was accepted, the [[European Community]] announced its decision to grant [[diplomatic recognition]] to Croatia on 15 January 1992,{{sfn|The New York Times|24 December 1991}} while the [[Serb]]- and JNA-held areas within Croatia were organised as the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK).{{sfn|Ahrens|2007|p=110}}

Despite the Geneva Accord requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind for seven to eight months. When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their equipment to the RSK.{{sfn|Armatta|2010|p=197}} As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UNPROFOR, did not start to deploy until 8 March.{{sfn|Trbovich|2008|p=300}} The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UNPAs.{{sfn|CIA|2002|pp=106<U+2013>107}} The UNPROFOR was tasked with demilitarisation of the UNPAs, ceasefire maintenance, monitoring of local police and creating conditions for return of [[internally displaced person]]s and refugees.{{sfn|Hague|1995|p=5}} Those comprised more than 300,000 [[Croats]] who were exiled from the RSK-controlled territory,{{sfn|Calic|2012|p=122}} and 20,000 Serbs who fled the areas of western [[Slavonia]] captured by the [[Croatian Army]] (''Hrvatska vojska'' <U+2013> HV) in [[Operation Swath-10|Operations Swath-10, Papuk-91]] and [[Operation Hurricane-91|Hurricane-91]] in late 1991.{{sfn|HRW|13 February 1992|loc=note 28}}

A part of western Slavonia, encompassing an area extending approximately {{convert|90|by|45|km|abbr=off}}, was designated as the UNPA of Western Slavonia or Sector West by the peace plan. Unlike other UNPAs, the RSK controlled only a part of the area<U+2014>approximately a third of the UNPA located in the south<U+2014>centred on the town of [[Oku<U+010D>ani]]. The RSK-held area included a section of the [[A3 (Croatia)|Zagreb<U+2013>Belgrade motorway]].{{sfn|Hague|1995|p=6}} The UNPROFOR deployed to Sector West thought the HV would attack the area to control the motorway.{{sfn|Hewitt|1998|p=52}} In response, the UNPROFOR developed [[Operation Backstop]] aimed at defending against the HV attack, assuming that its main axis would be aligned with the motorway.{{sfn|Hague|1995|p=23}}

==Cooperation schemes==
Division of Sector West into Croatian- and RSK-controlled areas fragmented the market for locally grown agricultural produce, and produce processing plants were rendered inaccessible to most farmers. Furthermore, the RSK-controlled area of Sector West suffered from severe shortage of fuel and electricity, while the Croatian-held [[Pakrac]] was cut off from water supply systems fed by springs in the RSK-held area to the south of the town. The situation led the head of the UN Civil Affairs in Sector West, Gerard Fischer, and Argentine [[General]] [[Carlos Maria Zabala]], commanding officer of the UNPROFOR in Sector West, to propose a degree of cooperation between local authorities on both sides in the area.{{sfn|Wilson Young|2010|p=191}}

Their efforts resulted in a scheme where grain crops grown in the RSK-held part of Sector West were milled in the Croatian-controlled areas, and the supply of potable water to Pakrac was exchanged for electricity supplied from Croatia to the southern portion of Sector West. Fischer also obtained approval for the limited return of refugees from local authorities. The scheme involved up to 2,500 refugees who would be allowed to rebuild their homes, funded by the Austrian government. The funds, in the amount of 1.3&nbsp;million dollars, were obtained through Michael Platzer, Special Assistant to the Director-General of the [[United Nations Office at Vienna]].{{sfn|Wilson Young|2010|p=192}}

===Formal agreement===
[[File:Veljko D<U+017E>akula.jpg|thumb|right|Veljko D<U+017E>akula (center), a signatory of the Daruvar Agreement]]
Fischer attempted to gain wider support for the cooperation schemes already in place and extend their scope in Sector West.{{sfn|Wilson Young|2010|p=198}} Fischer also assured the local authorities of the RSK that such a move would prevent renewed fighting in the area.{{sfn|ICTY|16 January 2006|p=361}} The result of Fischer's efforts was the Daruvar Agreement.{{sfn|Wilson Young|2010|p=198}} The agreement, signed in [[Daruvar]] on 18 February, encompassed the reconstruction of water and electrical power supply networks, the reopening of the Zagreb<U+2013>Belgrade motorway section in Sector West for non-commercial traffic, the facilitation of the [[M105 railway (Croatia)|Novska<U+2013>Nova Gradi<U+0161>ka railway]], the repair of telecommunication lines, the establishment of a joint commission tasked with normalisation of living conditions in Sector West, the return of all refugees to their homes, the access to property owned by civilians across the ceasefire line, and further meetings with local authorities to discuss further cooperation.{{sfn|Rupi<U+0107>|Vu<U+010D>ur|2010|pp=248-249}}

On behalf of the RSK local authorities, the agreement was signed by Veljko D<U+017E>akula, Du<U+0161>an E<U+0107>imovi<U+0107>, Milan Vlaisavljevi<U+0107>, Mladen Kuli<U+0107>, <U+0110>or<U+0111>e Lovri<U+0107> and Milan Radakovi<U+0107>.{{sfn|Rupi<U+0107>|Vu<U+010D>ur|2010|pp=248-249}} At the time, D<U+017E>akula held the position of deputy prime minister, while E<U+0107>imovi<U+0107> was a government minister in the RSK.{{sfn|ICTY|16 January 2006|p=362}} Signatories on behalf of the Croatian local authorities were Zlatko Kos, Zdravko Soki<U+0107>, Ivan Volf, Vladimir Dela<U+010D> and <U+017D>elimir Malnar. Fischer signed the agreement as a witness.{{sfn|Rupi<U+0107>|Vu<U+010D>ur|2010|pp=248-249}} According to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] testimony given by D<U+017E>akula at the [[trial of Milan Marti<U+0107>]], [[Ivan Milas]] was present at the signing of the agreement as a representative of the [[Government of Croatia]], accompanied by Jo<U+0161>ko Mori<U+0107>, Croatian [[Ministry of the Interior (Croatia)|Deputy Interior Minister]]. According to D<U+017E>akula, no effort was made to conceal the signing of the agreement, even though the negotiations beforehand were kept secret.{{sfn|ICTY|16 January 2006|p=360}}

==Aftermath==
The central RSK authorities in Knin learned of the agreement through a report filed by the 18th Corps of the [[Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina]] on 26 February, eight days after it was signed.{{sfn|Rupi<U+0107>|Vu<U+010D>ur|2010|pp=247-248}} The main opposition to the agreement came from [[Milan Marti<U+0107>]], the RSK Interior Minister. Leadership of the ruling [[Serb Democratic Party (Croatia)|Serb Democratic Party]] accused D<U+017E>akula of handing the RSK territory to Croatia.{{sfn|Caspersen|2010|p=104}} The RSK leadership considered the Daruvar Agreement tantamount to admission of economic unfeasibility of the RSK and an act of treason.{{sfn|Wilson Young|2010|p=199}} District council of the RSK-controlled western Slavonia condemned the agreement because it was enacted only in the [[Croatian language]], and failed to note the existence of the RSK or its administrative divisions.{{sfn|Rupi<U+0107>|Sekula|2010|pp=146-147}}

D<U+017E>akula and E<U+0107>imovi<U+0107> were sacked from their government positions,{{sfn|ICTY|16 January 2006|p=362}} and from the positions of regional authority in the RSK-held western Slavonia. The other three RSK signatories were dismissed from their official posts as well. At local elections held in May 1993 to fill the vacated posts, D<U+017E>akula was elected to serve as the Mayor of Pakrac municipality. On 21 September, D<U+017E>akula and E<U+0107>imovi<U+0107> were arrested,{{sfn|ICTY|16 January 2006|p=363}} and taken to Knin prison and then to [[Glina, Croatia|Glina]] while the investigation was in progress.{{sfn|ICTY|16 January 2006|p=364}} On 3 December, they were released only to learn that the arrest of the two, and Kuli<U+0107>, was ordered days later. In order to evade the arrest, the three fled the RSK to Serbia.{{sfn|ICTY|16 January 2006|pp=370-371}} On 4 February 1994, D<U+017E>akula was abducted in Belgrade by the RSK agents and taken back to the RSK.{{sfn|ICTY|16 January 2006|p=373}}

The RSK's response to the agreement ended Fischer's efforts. Moreover, Fischer, Zabala and Platzer were criticised by the UN, citing their excessive assertiveness in the matter. Fischer left Croatia,{{sfn|Wilson Young|2010|p=199}} and Jordanian General Shabshough replaced Zabala in March.{{sfn|Filipovi<U+0107>|2008|p=64}} The Zagreb<U+2013>Belgrade motorway was reopened in December 1994 through an agreement between the governments of the RSK and Croatia. However, a series of armed incidents in late April 1995 led to a Croatian military intervention and the capture of the portion of Sector West previously controlled by the RSK in [[Operation Flash]] in early May.{{sfn|CIA|2002|pp=296-269}}
