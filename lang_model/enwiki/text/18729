'''''Infierno en el Ring'' (2010)''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Inferno in the ring") was a [[professional wrestling]] [[Card (sports)#Supercard|supercard]] produced by [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), which took place on June 18, 2010 in [[Arena Mexico]], [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]]. Previous year's ''Infierno en el Ring'' events have been held on Fridays, replacing CMLL's regularly scheduled [[CMLL Super Viernes|Super Viernes]] show, but in 2010 the event was held on Sunday night instead. The 2010 Infierno en el Ring is the third show under that name and the 13th time CMLL have promoted an ''Infierno en el Ring'' cage match.

The main event of the show will be the eponymous ''Infierno en el Ring'' match that CMLL traditionally has traditionally held approximately once a year and which has headlined it's own specific show since 2008. The ''Infierno en el Ring'' match is a multi-man [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage]] match contested under ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Lucha de Apuesta]]'', or bet match, rules which means that the loser of the match would be forced to unmask per. Lucha Libre traditions. At the 2010 event 12 wrestlers will put their mask on the line in the match: [[<U+00C1>ngel de Oro]], [[<U+00C1>ngel de Plata]], [[<U+00C1>ngel Azteca, Jr.]], [[Diamante (wrestler)|Diamante]], [[Fabi<U+00E1>n el Gitano]], [[Sensei (wrestler)|Sensei]],  [[Hooligan (wrestler)|Hooligan]], [[Monster (wrestler)|Monster]], [[Puma King]], [[Tiger Kid]], [[Doctor X (wrestler)|Doctor X]] and [[Histeria (wrestler)|Histeria]]. The match saw <U+00C1>ngel de Oro pin Fabi<U+00E1>n el Gitano to unmask him. The show also featured three [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Six-man "Lucha Libre rules" tag team match]] and a [[tag team]] match to open the show.

==Background==
{{see also|Professional wrestling}}
The event will featured six [[professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[script (recorded media)|scripted]] feuds or [[narrative thread|storylines]] building up to the matches.

The foundation of the 12-man steel cage match storyline began around April, 2010 with a developing rivalry between the ''[[Face (professional wrestling)|tecnico]]'' (good guy) [[Fabi<U+00E1>n el Gitano]] and the ''[[Heel (professional wrestling)|rudo]]'' (bad guy) [[Doctor X (wrestler)|Doctor X]] on CMLL's secondary shows in [[Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]]. After a month of mask challenges between the two the feud was finally featured in CMLL's main venue, [[Arena Mexico]] in late May, indicating that a potential ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Lucha de Apuesta]]'', mask vs. mask match, could be happening soon.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.net/2010/05/12/fabian-el-gitano-vs-dr-x-%C2%BFpor-las-mascaras/  | title= Fabi<U+00E1>n el Gitano vs Dr. X <U+00BF>Por las Mascaras? | author= Ruiz Glez, Alex | date= May 12, 2010 | accessdate= July 10, 2010 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}</ref> Through out May and June several other mid-card wrestlers became involved in storylines that saw ''Apuesta'' challenges made. The team of [[<U+00C1>ngel de Oro]], [[<U+00C1>ngel de Plata]] and [[Sensei (wrestler)|Sensei]] challenged the team of [[Puma King]], [[Tiger Kid]] and [[Arkangel de la Muerte]] to an ''Apuesta'' match after Arkangel cheated to win a trios match.<ref name=LuchasJuly2>{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2010/06/26/resultados-arena-mexico-25-jun-10-%c2%a1regreso-la-peste-negra/ | title= Resultados Arena M<U+00E9>xico (25 jun 2010): <U+00A1>Regres<U+00F3> La Peste Negra! | date= June 26, 2010 | accessdate= July 8, 2010 | author= Rivera, Manuel | publisher=''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}</ref> When the ''Infierno en el Ring'' match was finally announced Arkangel de la Muerte was not among the participants, instead his ''[[Los Guerreros Tuareg]]'' teammate [[Hooligan (wrestler)|Hooligan]] was in addition to [[<U+00C1>ngel Azteca, Jr.]], [[Diamante (wrestler)|Diamante]], [[Monster (wrestler)|Monster]] and [[Histeria (wrestler)|Histeria]]. Histeria's inclusion in the match was a bit of a surprise as he was also scheduled to participate in a 10 man ''Lucha de Apuesta'' match on June 12, only 6 days before ''Infierno en el Ring'', with the booking either revealing that Histeria was keeping his mask, or announced as a misdirection to make Histeria's mask loss on June 12 more of a surprise.

The announced undercard featured three [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Six-man "Lucha Libre rules" tag team match]], the most common match form in CMLL. These matches feature a combination of ongoing storylines, emerging storylines or seemingly random teams. In the semi-main event [[M<U+00ED>stico]] teams up with [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]] and [[Brazo de Plata]] to take on [[Jushin Liger]], [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] and [[H<U+00E9>ctor Garza]]. The two main focal points in the match is M<U+00ED>stico's rivalry with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]'s Jushin Liger who's on tour with CMLL, potentially building to a title match between the two over the [[CMLL World Welterweight Championship]] which Liger holds. The other storyline featured in the semi-main event is the feud between Brazo de Plata and H<U+00E9>ctor Garza. Plata and Garza used to team together, with Garza even helping Brazo de Plata losing some of his considerable weight. In May, 2010 H<U+00E9>ctor Garza turned ''rudo'' on his friends, attacking them during a match and ever since he has been at odds with Brazo de Plata.

In the third match of the night [[Mexican National Welterweight Championship|Mexican National Welterweight Champion]] [[Valiente (wrestler)|Valiente]] teams up with the reigning [[CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship|CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Champions]] [[Stuka, Jr.]] and [[Flash (wrestler)|Fuego]]. They will take on the team of [[Misterioso, Jr.|Misterioso II]], who is looking for a title match with Valiente and [[Virus (wrestler)|Virus]] and [[Euforia (wrestler)|Euforia]] who represent the group ''Los Cancerberos del Infierno'', which has been trying to take the Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship away from the current champions. 

==Event==
The show opened with the man who was unmasked the last time CMLL held an ''Infierno en el Ring'' match, [[Tigre Blanco]] teaming up with the rookie [[Metatron]] to take on the team of [[Inquisidor]] and [[Cholo (wrestler)|Cholo]], who had been paired up for the show. The ''tecnico'' team of Tigre and Metatron won the first fall when Metatron pinned Inquisidor and Tigre Blanco pinned Cholo. In the second fall the ''rudo'' team tied up the score 1-1 when Cholo pinned Metatron and Inquisidor pinned Tigre Blanco. The third fall was the longest of the match and saw Tigre Blanco win the match for his team.<ref name=Infierno2010Quick>{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.net/2010/07/18/infierno-en-el-ring-2010-resultados-domingo-18-de-julio-fabian-el-gitano-pierde-la-mascara-ante-angel-de-oro/ | title= Infierno en el Ring 2010 (resultados domingo 18 de julio) Fabi<U+00E1>n El Gitano pierde la m<U+00E1>scara ante <U+00C1>ngel de Oro | author= Ruiz Glez, Alex | date= July 18, 2010 | accessdate= July 19, 2010 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name=LuchaWorldInfierno>{{cite web | url=http://www.luchaworld.com/?p=4749 | title= Lucha Report For 7/18/10 | author= Kris Zellner | date= July 18, 2010 | accessdate= July 19, 2010 | publisher= Lucha World}}</ref><ref name=Infierno2010>{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.net/2010/07/19/cmll-infierno-en-el-ring-18-julio-2010-%c2%a1fabian-el-gitano-pierde-la-mascara/ | title=CMLL: Infierno en el Ring (18 julio 2010): <U+00A1>Fabi<U+00E1>n el Gitano pierde la m<U+00E1>scara! | author= Rivera, Manuel | date= July 19, 2010 | accessdate= July 19, 2010 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}</ref>

The second match of the night saw two substitutes take place compared to the original card. Luna M<U+00E1>gica was originally scheduled to team with [[Lady Apache]] and [[Marcela (wrestler)|Marcela]], but was replaced with [[Dalys la Caribena]], the wife of [[Negro Casas]] who made her wrestling debut in 2010. On the ''Rudo'' side [[Mima Shimoda]] was supposed to team up with ''Las Zorras'' ("The Foxes"; [[Princesa Blanca]] and [[Princesa Sugey]]), but instead they teamed up with La Seductora without any explanations of why the replacements were made. ''Las Zorras'' took the first fall after Princesa Sugey pinned Lady Apache following a ''Torbellino'' splash and Princesa Blanca pinned Dalys. In the second fall the ''tecnicas'' regained momentum when Marcela executed what was described as a "brutal [[Professional wrestling throws#Michinoku driver II|Michinoku Driver]]" on La Seductora and pinned her. In the final fall Dalys la Caribena uses the Casas trademark ''La Casita'' [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)#La magistral|cradle]] to gain the three count and the victory for her team. Following the match Lady Apache and Marcela hugged, showing no signs of animosity despite being booked for a singles match against each other on the following [[CMLL Super Viernes (July 2010)#July 23, 2010|Super Viernes]].<ref name=Infierno2010Quick/><ref name=LuchaWorldInfierno/><ref name=Infierno2010/>

Misterioso II and ''Los Cancerberos'' both improved their chances of gaining a championship match down the line as they defeated Mexican National Welterweight Champion Valiente and CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Champions Stuka, Jr. and Fuego two falls to one. Misterioso pinned Fuego and Virus pinned Stuka, Jr. In the second fall the champions Valiente took out Virus with a ''[[[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Top<U+00E9>|Top<U+00E9> suicida]]'' while Stuka, Jr. pinned Misteriosos after a ''[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Plancha|Plancha]]'' style splash. Despite a moment of miscommunication where Misterioso kicked Euforia the team still managed to win the match when Misterioso pinned Fuego. Following the match the ''rudos'' shook hands, clearing up any misunderstandings between them.<ref name=Infierno2010Quick/><ref name=LuchaWorldInfierno/><ref name=Infierno2010/>

The fourth match saw two replacements made just like the second match of the night had. On the ''tecnico'' side [[Maximo (wrestler)|M<U+00E1>ximo]] replaced his father Brazo de Plata, teaming with M<U+00ED>stico and Shocker while H<U+00E9>ctor Garza was replaced by [[<U+00DA>ltimo Guerrero]] teaming up with fellow ''[[Los Guerreros del Infierno|Los Guerreros del Atlantidad]]'' member Atlantis and Jushin Liger. Liger almost won the first fall for his team when he applied a submission move on M<U+00E1>ximo, but before M<U+00E1>ximo could submit M<U+00ED>stico and Shocker surprised ''Los Guerreros'' by rolling them up for the pinfall victory. Liger's team gained a measure of revenge when Liger pinned Shocker after a [[Powerbomb#Sitout powerbomb|Ligerbomb]]. The third and deciding fall came when M<U+00ED>stico used his trademark ''La M<U+00ED>stica'' submission hold, giving the ''tecnicos'' the 2-1 victory.<ref name=Infierno2010Quick/><ref name=LuchaWorldInfierno/><ref name=Infierno2010/>

The CMLL crew took less than 15 minutes to set up the steel cage for the main event, which was fast for the type of cage that CMLL uses. After the cage was assembled the participants for the ''Infierno en el Ring'' match came to the ring, ''tecnicos'' first (<U+00C1>ngel de Oro, <U+00C1>ngel de Plata, <U+00C1>ngel Azteca, Jr., Diamante, Fabi<U+00E1>n el Gitano and Sensei) followed by the ''rudos'' (Doctor X, Hooligan, Puma King, Tiger Kid, Monster and Histeria). Before the match it was announced that there would be a three minute time limit where wrestlers were not allowed to escape the cage. Once the bell rings all 12 wrestlers began fighting, some pairing up against the wrestlers they had been feuding with for a while, Dr. X and Fabi<U+00E1>n el Gitano, ''Los <U+00C1>ngeles'' and Puma King and Tiger Kid. The theme of the match was "every man for himself", demonstrated by Hooligan as he was the first man to escape after the time limit expired, distracting his teammate Doctor X in order to escape the cage. <U+00C1>ngel de Oro and <U+00C1>ngel de Plata both climbed the cage at the same time, only to have <U+00C1>ngel de Plata pull his brother off the cage so he could escape himself. While the other wrestlers were preoccupied Monster saw an opening and climbed out of the cage, the third man to escape the match. Moments later Sensei becomes the fourth man to escape the cage, keeping his mask safe. The brother team of Puma King and Tiger Kid are the next to try to escape the cage, but like with the <U+00C1>ngel brothers Tiger Kid prevented his brother from escaping so that he could get out of the cage himself. Out next was <U+00C1>ngel Azteca, Jr. who climbed over the cage to ensure he would not have to fight for his mask that night. Puma King and <U+00C1>ngel de Oro seemed to work together to escape the cage, only for Puma King to double cross <U+00C1>ngel de Oro so that Puma King could escape the cage. With Diamante's escape there are only four wrestlers left in the ring. Histeria quickly abandons fellow ''rudo'' Doctor X to escape the cage, saving his match for the second time in a week. In the cage <U+00C1>ngel de Oro accidentally hit Fabi<U+00E1>n el Gitano when he was trying to hit Doctor X. This gave the Doctor an opening to escape the cage, chosing to leave the cage instead of trying to punish his rival Fabi<U+00E1>n el Gitano further.<ref name=Infierno2010Quick/><ref name=LuchaWorldInfierno/><ref name=Infierno2010/><ref name=FuegoInfierno>{{cite web | url=http://www.fuegoenelring.com/articles_noticias_full.php?articles_id=1034 | title= Fabian 2El Gitano" se quema en el Infierno | date= July 19, 2010 | accessdate= July 19, 2010 | publisher= ''Fuego en el Ring'' | language=Spanish}}</ref>

Since <U+00C1>ngel de Oro and Fabi<U+00E1>n el Gitano were the last two men left in the cage they were forced to wrestle against each other under ''Lucha de Apuesta'' rules inside the cage. After a short match between the two <U+00C1>ngel de Oro pinned Fabi<U+00E1>n, earning his first mask victory of his career. Following the match Fabi<U+00E1>n el Gitano unmasked, then announced that he real name was Emilio Fabian Fernandez de Leon born in Mexico City, 38 years old and had 16 years of wrestling experience. Following <U+00C1>ngel de Oro's victory his brother <U+00C1>ngel de Plata came to the ring to congratulate his brother without any signs of resentment for the actions taken during the match.<ref name=Infierno2010Quick/><ref name=LuchaWorldInfierno/><ref name=Infierno2010/><ref name=FuegoInfierno/>
