'''''Eucalyptus vernicosa''''', commonly known as '''Varnished Gum''',<ref name="APCND">{{cite web | title = Australian Plant Common Name Database | url  = http://www.anbg.gov.au/common.names/ | publisher = [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]] | accessdate = 2012-02-23}}</ref> is an [[endemic]] [[Tasmania]]n [[shrub]], and the smallest species of ''[[Eucalyptus]]''.  The Latin name comes from ''vernicosus'' (varnished, shining), which comes from ''vernix'', meaning 'varnish', which describes the glossy appearance of the leaves.<ref name="Tasmanian Plant Names Unravelled">{{cite book |last1 = Wapstra |first1 = Mark |last2 = Wapstra |first2 = Annie |last3 = Wapstra |first3 = Hans |year=2010 |title=Tasmanian Plant Names Unravelled |publisher = Fullers bookshop}}</ref>

==Description==
''Eucalyptus vernicosa'' is described as a small shrub or [[Mallee (habit)|mallee]] tree, 0.5 to 4m high.  It has smooth bark, usually grey or grey brown, with pith and bark glands present.  Juvenile and adult leaves have a similar form.  Leaves are often sessile, or with only a short petiole, typically opposite, however the uppermost can be occasionally alternate.  They have an elliptical to oblong shape, with a rounded apex and base, 1<U+2013>5&nbsp;cm long and 1-2.5&nbsp;cm broad, leathery and green, but very glossy with a somewhat toothed margin and lateral veins that usually diverge at angles of more than 60 degrees.  Flowers occur at axillary buds and are sessile or subsessile.  They are either solitary or in groups of 3.  Buds are 7-8mm long, greenish brown, and finely wrinkled.  The operculum is shorter than the receptacle and is conical shaped with a pointed apex.<ref name="The Student's Flora of Tasmania: Part 1 (second edition)">{{cite book |last1 = Curtis |first1 = Winifred |last2 = Morris |first2 = Dennis |year=1975 |title=The Student's Flora of Tasmania: Part 1 (second edition)}}</ref><ref name="Eucalypts: Volume 2">{{cite book |last1 = Kelly |first1 = Stan |last2 = Chippendale |first2 = George |last3 = Johnson |first3 = Doug |year=1983 |title=Eucalypts: Volume 2|publisher = Thomas Nelson }}</ref><ref name="The Eucalypts of Tasmania">{{cite book |last1 = Page |first1 = Mary |year=1998 |title=The Eucalypts of Tasmania}}</ref>

==Distribution and Habitat==
''Eucalyptus vernicosa'' is [[endemic]] to [[Tasmania]], and is only found in [[alpine]] regions in the West to South West, including [[Cradle Mountain]].<ref name="The Eucalypts of Tasmania"/>  It grows between 700m and 1350m above sea level, usually on peaty acid soils on top of [[quartzite]] or [[sandstone]] bedrock.<ref name="The Student's Flora of Tasmania: Part 1 (second edition)"/><ref name= "Eucaflip">{{cite book |last1 = Wiltshire |first1 = Rob |last2 = Potts |first2= Brad |year=2007|title=Eucaflip}}</ref>  It is usually found above the [[tree line]], and can be a dominate component of alpine heath communities, along with [[Richea]], [[Athrotaxis]], and [[Orites]].<ref name="Eucalypt Ecology: Individuals to Ecosystems">{{cite book |last1 = Williams |first1 = Jann |last2 = Woinarski |first2 = John |year=1997 |title=Eucalypt Ecology: Individuals to Ecosystems|publisher = Cambridge University Press }}</ref>  This habitat typically has high average rainfall varying from 1000mm to 2500mm per year, and very cold winters with continuous frosts and snow for several months.<ref name="Eucalypts: Volume 2"/>  The harsh climate and nutritiously poor soils probably explain the small size and tough leaves.<ref name="Vegetation of Tasmania">{{cite book |last1 = Reid |first1 = James |last2 = Hill |first2 = Robert |last3 = Brown |first3 = Michael |last4 = Hovenden|first4=Mark |year=2005 |title=Vegetation of Tasmania|publisher = Australian Biological Resources Study }}</ref>  

''Eucalyptus vernicosa'' has been traditionally cited as an example of a morphological continuum along with Eucalyptus jonstonii, and Eucalpytus subcrenulata.  A study from Mount Arrowsmith showed a strong relationship within those three species, linking altitude with changes in glaucousness, leaf morphology, growth rates, habit, capsule shape, bark thickness and degree of frost resistance.  It was suggested that they represented close relatives of one species that was diverging to adapt to an environmental cline.<ref name="Vegetation of Tasmania"/>  However more recent genetic studies show that ''E. vernicosa'' is more distantly related to the ''E. jonstonii/E. subcrenulata'' complex, and the apparent morphological clinal intergradation between ''E. vernicosa'' and ''E. subcrenulata'' is probably a result of [[parallel evolution]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=McGowen|first=M.

==Uses==

===Gardens===
A number of Tasmanian alpine Eucalypts, including ''E. vernicosa'', are grown as ornamental trees and shrubs in Europe, and especially in the United Kingdom, due to their [[evergreen]] habit and similarity of climate.<ref>http://kingsbarntrees.co.uk/acatalog/Eucalyptus_Information.html</ref><ref>http://www.lullingstonecastle.co.uk/component/content/article/221</ref>

===Oils===
In the early 20th century ''E. vernicosa'' was harvested for its oil, which was believed to have medicinal properties.<ref>http://tasbushblog.blogspot.com.au/2007/11/hartz-peak-3-november-2007.html</ref>
