The '''Sierra Nevada''' ({{IPA-es|<U+02C8>sjera ne<U+02C8><U+03B2>a<U+00F0>a|lang}}, ''snowy mountain range''<ref>Carlson, Helen S., ''Nevada Place Names: A Geographical Dictionary,'' University of Nevada Press, 1976, p. 215 ISBN 978-0874170948</ref>) is a mountain range in the [[U.S. states]] of [[California]] and [[Nevada]], between the [[California Central Valley]] and the [[Basin and Range Province]]. The Sierra runs {{convert|400|mi|km}} north-to-south, and is approximately {{convert|70|mi|km}} across east-to-west.  Notable Sierra features include [[Lake Tahoe]], the largest [[alpine lake]] in North America; [[Mount Whitney]] at {{convert|14505|ft|m}},<ref name=ngs/> the highest point in the [[contiguous United States]]; and [[Yosemite Valley]] sculpted by glaciers out of 100-million-year-old [[granite]]. The Sierra is home to three parks, 20 wilderness areas, and two national monuments. These areas include [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]], [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]] and [[Kings Canyon National Park]]s.  

The character of the range is shaped by its geology and ecology. More than 100 million years ago, granite formed deep underground. The range started to uplift 4 million years ago, and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range. The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra, which are reflected by the presence of five life zones.

The Sierra Nevada was home to several Native American tribes. The range was first sighted by Europeans in 1542, and then explored between 1844 and 1912.<ref name="roper81"/>

==Geography==
The Sierra Nevada stretches from the [[Susan River (California)|Susan River]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Subsection M261Eb: Fredonyer Butte - Grizzly Peak |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/projects/ecoregions/m261eb.htm |accessdate=2010-08-02}}</ref> and [[Fredonyer Pass]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=126|work=Peakbagger.com|title=Sierra Nevada|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref> in the north to [[Tehachapi Pass]] in the south.<ref name="sneco">{{cite web|title=Sierra Nevada|work=Ecological Subregions of California|publisher=United States Forest Service|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/projects/ecoregions/m261e.htm}}</ref>  It is bounded on the west by [[California]]'s [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]] and on the east by the [[Basin and Range Province]]. Physiographically, the Sierra are a section of the Cascade-Sierra Mountains province, which in turn is part of the larger [[Geography of the United States Pacific Mountain System|Pacific Mountain System]] physiographic division.

West-to-east, the Sierra Nevada elevation gradually increases from the [[California Central Valley]] to the crest, while the east slope forms the steep Sierra [[Escarpment]].  The range is drained on its northwest slopes by the [[Sacramento River]] and to the west-southwest by the [[San Joaquin River]], two major [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] watercourses that ultimately discharge to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Smaller rivers of the west slope include the [[Feather River|Feather]], [[American River|American]], [[Mokelumne River|Mokelumne]], [[Stanislaus River|Stanislaus]] and [[Tuolumne River|Tuolumne]]. The southern part of the mountains are drained by four rivers called the [[Kings River|Kings]], [[Kaweah River|Kaweah]], [[Tule River|Tule]], and [[Kern River|Kern]]. These rivers flow into an [[endorheic basin]] called [[Tulare Lake]], but historically joined the San Joaquin during wet years. 

To the east, the melting snow of the mountains form many small rivers that flow out into the [[Great Basin]] of [[Nevada]] and eastern California. From north to south, the [[Susan River (California)|Susan River]] flows into intermittent [[Honey Lake]]; the [[Truckee River]] flows from massive [[Lake Tahoe]] into [[Pyramid Lake]]; the [[Carson River]] runs into [[Carson Sink]]; the [[Walker River]] into [[Walker Lake]]; [[Rush Creek|Rush]], [[Lee Vining Creek|Lee Vining]] and Mill Creeks into [[Mono Lake]]; and the [[Owens River]] into the dry [[Owens Lake]]. None of the eastside rivers reach the sea; however, many of the streams from Mono Lake southwards are diverted into the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] and their water shipped to [[Southern California]].

The height of the mountains in the Sierra Nevada gradually increases from north to south. Between Fredonyer Pass and Lake Tahoe, the peaks range from {{convert|5000|ft|m}} to more than {{convert|9000|ft|m}}. The crest near Lake Tahoe is roughly {{convert|9000|ft|m}} high, with several peaks approaching the height of [[Freel Peak]]  [{{convert|10881|ft|m}}]. Further south, the highest peak in Yosemite National Park is [[Mount Lyell (California)|Mount Lyell]] [{{convert|13120|ft|m|0}}]. The Sierra rise to almost {{convert|14000|ft|m}} with [[Mount Humphreys]] near [[Bishop, California]]. Finally, near [[Independence, California|Independence]], Mount Whitney is at {{convert|14505|ft|m}}, the highest point in the [[contiguous United States]]. 

South of Mount Whitney, the range quickly dwindles. The crest elevation is almost {{convert|10000|ft|m}} near [[Lake Isabella]], but south of the lake, the peaks reach only to a modest {{convert|8000|ft|m}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Google terrain map |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.671581,-118.427236&spn=0.1,0.1&t=p&q=35.671581,-118.427236 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref>

===Notable features===
[[File:Emerald Bay.jpg|thumb|right|Emerald Bay in Lake Tahoe]]
There are several notable geographical features in the Sierra Nevada:
*[[Lake Tahoe]] is a large, clear freshwater lake in the northern Sierra Nevada, with an elevation of 6,225 feet (1,897 m) and an area of 191 square miles (489&nbsp;km<U+00B2>).<ref name="tahoefacts">{{cite web|url=http://tahoe.usgs.gov/facts.html|title=Facts about Lake Tahoe|publisher=USGS|accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref> Lake Tahoe lies between the main Sierra and the [[Carson Range]], a spur of the Sierra.<ref name="tahoefacts"/> 
*[[Hetch Hetchy Valley]], [[Yosemite Valley]], [[Kings Canyon National Park|Kings Canyon]], and [[Kern Canyon]] are examples of many glacially-scoured canyons on the west side of the Sierra. 
*[[Yosemite National Park]] is filled with notable features, such as [[List of Yosemite waterfalls|waterfalls]] and [[granite dome]]s.
*Groves of [[Giant Sequoia]]s ''Sequoiadendron giganteum'' occur along a narrow band of altitude on the western side of the Sierra Nevada. Giant sequoias are the most massive trees in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/seki/shrm_pic.htm|title=The General Sherman Tree|publisher=U.S. National Park Service}}</ref>

==Geologic history==
{{For|central Sierra Nevada geology|Geology of the Yosemite area}}

The earliest granite of the Sierra started to form in the [[Triassic]] period. This granite is mostly found east of the crest and north of 37.2<U+00B0>N.<ref name=mesopluto>{{cite web|title=Mesozoic Plutonism in the Sierra Nevada Batholith|url=http://www.colorado.edu/GeolSci/Resources/WUSTectonics/SierraBatholith/mesozoic.htm#pt3|first=Tanya S.|last=Unger}}</ref> In the Triassic and into the [[Jurassic]], an [[island arc]] collided with the west coast of [[North America]] and raised a set of [[mountain]]s, in an event called the [[Nevadan orogeny]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-yosemite-hiking-california-sidwcmdev_056847.html|last=Shaffer|first=Jeffrey|title=Evolution of the Yosemite Landscape <U+2014> The Nevadan Orogeny|work=One Hundred Hikes in Yosemite}}</ref> 

[[File:YosemitePark2 amk.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Yosemite Valley]] in Yosemite National Park.]]

In the [[Cretaceous]], a [[subduction zone]] formed at the edge of the continent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~rcb7/Text_WUS.html|title=Geologic History of Western US|first=Ron|last=Blakely}}</ref> This means that an [[oceanic plate]] started to dive beneath the [[North American plate]]. Magma formed through the subduction of the ancient [[Farallon Plate]] rose in plumes (plutons) deep underground, their combined mass forming what is called the [[Sierra Nevada batholith]]. These plutons formed at various times, from 115-million to 87-million years ago.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schoenherr|first=Allan A.|title=A Natural History of California|year=1995|publisher=UC Press|isbn=0-520-06922-6 }}</ref> The earlier plutons formed in the western half of the Sierra, while the later plutons formed in the eastern half of the Sierra.<ref name=mesopluto/> By 65-million years ago, the proto-Sierra Nevada was worn down to a range of rolling low mountains, a few thousand feet high. 

Twenty million years ago, crustal extension associated with the [[Basin and Range Province]] caused extensive volcanism in the Sierra.<ref>{{cite web|title=Basin and Range (Transierra) Region Physical Geography|url=http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~joel/g148_f09/readings/basin_range/basin_range.html|author=Joel Michaelsen|accessdate=2010-05-07}}</ref> About 4-million years ago, the Sierra Nevada started to form: a [[Sierra Nevada-Great Valley Block|block of crust]] between the Coast Range and the [[Basin and Range Province]] started to tilt to the west. Rivers started cutting deep canyons on both sides of the range. The Earth's climate cooled, and [[ice age]]s started about 2.5-million years ago. [[Glacier]]s carved out characteristic U-shaped canyons throughout the Sierra. The combination of river and glacier erosion exposed the uppermost portions of the plutons emplaced millions of years before, leaving only a remnant of [[metamorphic rock]] on top of some Sierra peaks.

Uplift of the Sierra Nevada continues today, especially along its eastern side. This uplift causes large earthquakes, such as the [[1872 Lone Pine earthquake|Lone Pine earthquake]] of 1872.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sierranevadavirtualmuseum.com/docs/galleries/nathist/geology/lonepine.htm|title=1872 Lone Pine Earthquake|work=Sierra Nevada Virtual Museum|accessdate=2010-05-31|quote=Few people ever see a mountain range grow, but on March 26, 1872, the 300 residents of Lone Pine, California, did.}}</ref>

==Climate and meteorology==
[[File:Red Slate Mountain 1.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Red Slate Mountain]] (elevation {{convert|13156|ft|m|abbr=on}}) is still covered with snow in June.]] <!-- An example of how the snowpack in the Sierra lasts until June -->

The climate of the Sierra Nevada is influenced by the [[Mediterranean climate]] of California. During the fall, winter and spring, precipitation in the Sierra ranges from {{convert|20|to|80|in|mm|abbr=on|lk=off}} where it occurs mostly as snow above {{convert|6000|ft|m|abbr=on|lk=off}}. Summers are dry with low humidity; however, afternoon thunderstorms are not uncommon, particularly during the [[North American Monsoon]]. Summer high temperatures average 42 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The growing season lasts 20 to 230 days, strongly dependent on elevation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/land/pubs/ecoregions/ch33.html|title=Sierran Steppe - Mixed Forest - Coniferous Forest|work=Ecological Subregions of the United States|publisher=US Forest Service|accessdate=2007-01-27}}</ref>

The Sierra Nevada snowpack is the major source of water and a significant source of electric power generation in California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sierranevada.ca.gov/docs/Water09.pdf|title=Water<U+2014>Most of California<U+2019>s Water Comes from the Sierra Nevada|publisher=Sierra Nevada Conservancy|accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref>  Many reservoirs were constructed in the canyons of the Sierra throughout the 20th century,  Several major aqueducts serving both agriculture and urban areas distribute Sierra water throughout the state. However, the Sierra casts a [[rain shadow]], which greatly affects the climate and ecology of the central [[Great Basin]]. This rain shadow is largely responsible for Nevada being the driest state in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/usclimate/pcp.state.19712000.climo|title=Climatology by state based on climate division data: 1971-2000|publisher=NOAA Earth Systems Research Laboratory}}</ref>
 
The height of the range and the steepness of the Sierra Escarpment, particularly at the southern end of the range produces a wind phenomenon known as the "Sierra Rotor".  This is a horizontal rotation of the atmosphere just east of the crest of the Sierras, set in motion as an effect of strong westerly winds.<ref>{{cite conference|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/114663.pdf|publisher=American Meterological Society|booktitle=12th Conference on Mountain Meteorology|title=Sierra Rotors: A Comparative Study of Three Mountain Wave and Rotor Events|first=Vanda|last=Grubi<U+0161>ic|coauthors=Brian J.

{{Main|Ecology of the Sierra Nevada}}

The Sierra Nevada is divided into a number of [[life zone|biotic zones]], each of which is defined by its climate and supports a number of interdependent species.<ref name="Schoenherr">{{cite book|last=Schoenherr|first=Allan A.|title=A Natural History of California|year=1995|publisher=UC Press|isbn=0-520-06922-6 }}</ref> Life in the higher elevation zones adapted to colder weather, and to most of the precipitation falling as snow.

===Native Americans===
{{Main|Native Americans in the United States}}

During the period of 3,000 BC to AD 500, the first [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] in the Sierra Nevada were the [[Great Basin tribes]] of [[Paiute|Northern Paiute]]) tribes on the east side.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  The [[Mono tribe]] and [[Valley and Sierra Miwok|Sierra Miwok]] tribe were on the western side, and the [[Kawaiisu]] tribe were in the south. Today, some mountain passes, such as Duck Pass with [[obsidian]] [[arrowhead]]s, are artifact locations from historic intertribal trade route trails. The California and Sierra Native American tribes were predominantly peaceful, with occasional territorial disputes between the Paiute and Sierra Miwok tribes in the mountains.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=Charles F.|year=1868|title=Notes on Hetch-Hetchy Valley|journal=Proceedings of the California Academy of Science|volume=1 |issue=3:5|pages=368<U+2013>370|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/notes_on_hetch-hetchy_valley.html |accessdate=2006-09-27}}</ref>  [[Washoe people|Washo]] and [[Maidu]] were also in this area prior to the era of European exploration and displacement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sierrarockart.org/makers.html |title=ANCIENT PETROGLYPH MAKERS OF THE NORTHERN SIERRA |accessdate=2008-08-15 |last=Drake |first=Bill |year=2000 |work= |publisher=sierrarockart.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofgrassvalley.com/services/departments/cdd/IdMd/FinalMEAJune2006/405_CulturalRes.pdf|title=Prehistoric Context |page=2 |accessdate=2008-08-15 |last= |first= |coauthors= |month=June | year=2006 |work=Idaho-Maryland Mine Project, Master Environmental Assessment |publisher=cityofgrassvalley.com}}</ref>

===Etymology===
Used in 1542 by [[Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo]] to describe a [[Pacific Coast Ranges|Pacific Coast Range]] ([[Santa Cruz Mountains]]), the term "sierra nevada" was a general identification of less familiar ranges toward the interior,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Farquhar |first=Francis P. |month=March |year=1925 |title=Exploration of the Sierra Nevada |journal=California Historical Society Quarterly |url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/exploration_of_the_sierra_nevada/}}</ref>  In 1777, Pedro Font's map applied the name to the range currently known as the Sierra Nevada.<ref>{{cite book|last=Farquhar|first=Francis P.|year=1926|title=Place Names of the Sierra Nevada |url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/place_names_of_the_high_sierra/s.html|publisher=Sierra Club|location=San Francisco}}</ref>

===European-American exploration===
{{See also|California Trail}}

European-American exploration of the mountain range started in the 1840s. In the winter of 1844, Lt. [[John C. Fr<U+00E9>mont]], accompanied by [[Kit Carson]], was the first European to see [[Lake Tahoe]]. The Fr<U+00E9>mont party camped at {{convert|8050|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |year=2007 |origyear=1999 |title=Fr<U+00E9>mont's "Long Camp" |url=http://www.longcamp.com/longcamp.html |accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref>

By 1860, [[California Gold Rush]] populated the flanks of the Sierra Nevada, leaving most of the Sierra unexplored.<ref name="roper">{{cite book|last=Roper|first=Steve|title=Sierra High Route: Traversing Timberline Country|year=1997|publisher=The Mountaineers Press|isbn=0-89886-506-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=James G.|title=Exploring the Highest Sierra|year=2000|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-3703-7}}</ref> The state legislature authorized the [[California Geological Survey]] to officially explore the Sierra (and survey the rest of the state). [[Josiah Whitney]] was appointed to head the survey.   Men of the survey, including [[William Henry Brewer|William H. Brewer]], [[Charles F. Hoffmann]] and [[Clarence King]], explored the backcountry of what would become [[Yosemite National Park]] in 1863.<ref name="roper"/> In 1864 they explored the area around [[Kings Canyon National Park|Kings Canyon]].  In 1869, [[John Muir]] started his wanderings in the Sierra Nevada range,<ref>{{cite book|title=My First Summer in the Sierra|first=John|last=Muir|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/john_muir_writings/my_first_summer_in_the_sierra/|year=1911|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=1883011248}}</ref> and in 1871 King was the first to climb [[Mount Langley]] and that year fishermen were the first to climb [[Mount Whitney]].<ref name="roper"/>  From 1892-7 [[Theodore Solomons]] made the first attempt to map a route along the crest of the Sierra.<ref name="roper"/> 

Other people finished exploring and mapping the Sierra. [[Bolton Coit Brown]] explored the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]] watershed in 1895-1899. [[Joseph N. LeConte]] mapped the area around [[Yosemite National Park]] and what would become [[Kings Canyon National Park]]. [[James S. Hutchinson]], a noted mountaineer, climbed the [[Palisades (California Sierra)|Palisades]] (1904) and [[Mount Humphreys]] (1905). By 1912, the [[USGS]] published a set of maps of the Sierra Nevada, and the era of exploration was over.<ref name="roper81">Roper, 1997, p. 81</ref>

===Conservation===

The tourism potential of the Sierra Nevada was recognized early in the European history of the range.
[[Yosemite Valley]] was first protected by the federal government in [[1864]]. The Valley and [[Mariposa Grove]] were ceded to [[California]] in 1866 and turned into a state park.<ref name=Schaffer>{{cite book|last=Schaffer|first=Jeffrey P.|title=Yosemite National Park: A Natural History Guide to Yosemite and Its Trails|publisher=Wilderness Press|location=Berkeley|year=1999|isbn=0-89997-244-6.}}</ref> John Muir perceived [[overgrazing]] by [[domestic sheep|sheep]] and logging of [[Giant Sequoia]] to be a problem in the Sierra. Muir successfully lobbied for the protection of the rest of Yosemite National Park: Congress created an Act to protect the park in 1890. The Valley and Mariposa Grove were added to the Park in 1906.<ref name=Schaffer/> In the same year, [[Sequoia National Park]] was formed to protect the Giant Sequoia: all logging of the Sequoia ceased at that time.

In 1903, the city of [[San Francisco]] proposed building a [[hydroelectric dam]] to flood [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]]. The city and the [[Sierra Club]] argued over the dam for 10 years, until the [[U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Raker Act]] in 1913 and allowed dam building to proceed. [[O'Shaughnessy Dam]] was completed in 1923.<ref>{{cite book | title=Dam!: Water, Power, Politics, and Preservation in Hetch Hetchy and Yosemite National Park | last=Simpson | first=John W. | year=2005 | isbn=0-375-42231-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=The Battle over Hetch Hetchy: America's Most Controversial Dam and the Birth of Modern Environmentalism | last=Righter | first=Robert W. | year=2005 | isbn=0-195-31309-7}}</ref>

Between 1912 and 1918, Congress debated three times to protect Lake Tahoe in a national park. None of these efforts succeeded, and after [[World War II]], towns such as [[South Lake Tahoe, California|South Lake Tahoe]] grew around the shores of the lake. By 1980, the permanent population of the Lake Tahoe area grew to 50,000, while the summer population grew to 90,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stream and Ground-Water Monitoring Program, Lake Tahoe Basin, Nevada and California|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/FS-100-97/|publisher=USGS|accessdate=2010-05-31}}</ref> The development around Lake Tahoe affected the clarity of the lake water. In order to preserve the lake's clarity, construction in the Tahoe basin is currently regulated by the [[Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trpa.org/default.aspx?tabindex=1&tabid=40|title=Construction Monitoring|publisher=Tahoe Regional Planning Agency}}</ref> 

As the twentieth century progressed, more of the Sierra became available for recreation: other forms of economic activity decreased. The [[John Muir Trail]], a trail that followed the Sierra crest from Yosemite Valley to [[Mount Whitney]], was funded in 1915 and finished in 1938.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Starr|first=Walter A.|month=November|year=1947|title=Trails|journal=Sierra Club Bulletin|publisher=Sierra Club|location=San Francisco|volume= 32|issue= 10}}</ref> [[Kings Canyon National Park]] was formed in 1940 to protect the deep canyon of the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]]. 

By 1964, the [[Wilderness Act]] protected portions of the Sierra as primitive areas where humans are simply temporary visitors. Gradually, 20 [[U.S. Wilderness Areas|wilderness areas]] were established to protect scenic [[backcountry]] of the Sierra. These wilderness areas include the [[John Muir Wilderness]] (protecting the eastern slope of the Sierra and the area between Yosemite and Kings Canyon Parks), and wilderness within each of the National Parks.

Today, much of the Sierra Nevada is owned by the [[U.S. Federal government]] and is either protected from development or is strictly managed. The three [[United States National Park|National Parks]] ([[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]], [[Kings Canyon National Park|Kings Canyon]], [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]]), two [[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]] ([[Devils Postpile National Monument|Devils Postpile]], [[Giant Sequoia National Monument|Giant Sequoia]]), and 20 [[List of Sierra Nevada topics#Wilderness areas|wilderness areas]] lie within the Sierra. These areas protect 15.4% of the Sierra's {{convert|63118|km2|mi2}} from logging and grazing.<ref name=gap>{{cite web|url=http://www.biogeog.ucsb.edu/projects/gap/report/sn_rep.html|title=The Sierra Nevada Region|work=USCB Biogeography lab}}</ref> 

The [[United States Forest Service]] and the [[Bureau of Land Management]] currently control 52% of the land in the Sierra Nevada.<ref name=gap/> Logging and grazing is generally allowed on land controlled by these agencies, under federal regulations that balance recreation and development on the land.
