The '''''Pasy<U+00F3>n''''' ({{lang-es|Pasi<U+00F3>n}}) is a [[Literature of the Philippines|Philippine]] [[epic poem|epic]] narrative of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], [[Death of Jesus|Death]], and [[Resurrection]] of [[Jesus Christ]]. In stanzas of five lines of eight syllables each, the standard elements of epic poetry are interwoven with a colourful, dramatic theme. The primary method of performing this text is its chanting during the [[Lenten]] season or [[Holy Week in the Philippines|Holy Week]], and is a popular [[Catholicism in the Philippines|Filipino Catholic]] devotion.

== History ==
The text follows the pre-Hispanic tradition of chanting epic poems as a form of [[oral tradition]]. After [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianity]] was [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|introduced by the Spanish]], the Passion cycle was adapted into the native art. 

The indigenous form of the ''Pasy<U+00F3>n'' was first written down by [[Gaspar Aquino de Bel<U+00E9>n]] in "''Ang Mahal na Pasi<U+00F3>n ni Jesu Christong Panginoon Natin na Tola''" ("The Sacred Passion of Jesus Christ Our Lord that is a Poem"), written in 1703 and approved in 1704.

An 1852 erudition by Aniceto de Merced, ''El libro de la vida'' ("The Book of the Life [of Jesus]") did not prove popular with the masses.

===Pasy<U+00F3>ng Genes<U+00ED>s===
The most popular [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] version of the ''Pasy<U+00F3>n'' is the "''Casaysayan nang Pasiong Mahal ni Jesucristong Panginoon Natin na Sucat Ipag-alab nang Puso nang Sinomang Babasa''" ("The History of the Passion of Jesus Christ Our Lord that Surely Shall Ignite the Heart of Whosoever Readeth"). 

This version is also known as the ''Pasy<U+00F3>ng Genes<U+00ED>s'' as it includes the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation narrative]] before the lives of Mary and Christ, and as the ''Pasy<U+00F3>ng Pilapil'', after its 1884 foreword by Dr Mariano Pilapil. The book's [[title page]] describes it as being commissioned by former [[Archbishop of Manila]] Jos<U+00E9> Segu<U+00ED>, O.S.A. and former [[Order of Saint Augustine#Philippines|Augustinian]] [[Provincial superior|provincial]] Manuel Grijalvo, O.S.A., and edited by a certain Fr Amador W. Cruz. 

A widely circulated version of this is the 1949 edition, published by Ignacio Luna and Sons, Co. (branded as ''Awit at Salaysay ng Pasiong Mahal...'' instead of ''Casaysayan'').

== Devotional use ==
The ''Pasy<U+00F3>n'' is normally heard during [[Holy Week in the Philippines]], where its recitation is known as the ''[[Pab<U+00E1>sa]]'' ("Reading"). The rite can span several days, extending no later than [[Holy Saturday|Black Saturday]], but is usually ended on noon or before 3 pm of [[Good Friday]] (the time when Jesus died on the cross). 

Readers chant the ''Pasy<U+00F3>n'' from beginning to end without pause; this non-stop recitation is facilitated by the chanters working in shifts. The chanters usually perform the rite as a ''panat<U+00E2>'' ("vow"), or votive offering in request or thanksgiving. They are frequently aged women, but in recent years some of the younger generation have shown increased interest in it. 

The rite usually takes place in front of a specially constructed shrine or altar within the home or a temporary outdoor booth, covered on the sides by palm leaves. This may also be performed at a local ''visita''/''kapilya'' ([[chapel of ease]]) or some other communal area. 

As is Philippine custom, the host of the ''Pabasa'' (usually the homeowner of the venue) provides a lot of food and refreshments for the chanters.

=== Musical setting ===
Musical accompaniment to the ''Pabasa'' is widely practised though is by no means universal, and the most commonly employed instruments are guitar and keyboard. There are traditional tones that the ''Pasy<U+00F3>n'' is set to, and these have been passed down through the generations. Recent innovations in the epic's setting include contemporary popular ballads, pop music, and hymns.
