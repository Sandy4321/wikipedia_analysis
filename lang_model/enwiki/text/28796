"'''School Reunion'''" is the third episode in the [[List of Doctor Who serials#Series 2 (2006)|second series]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. It first aired on 29 April 2006.<ref name="brief" /> The episode's narrative takes place some time after the events of "[[The Christmas Invasion]]". In the episode's [[TARDISODE]], [[Mickey Smith]] alerts the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] and [[Rose Tyler]] to a comprehensive school where strange things are happening, such as [[UFO]] sightings. At the school, the Doctor encounters his former companion [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and the robotic dog, [[K-9 Mark III]], he sent her, who likewise were interested by the current events. Together, they discover the force behind the events, a race known as the Krillitanes, and work to prevent them gaining control of the universe.

The use of the Doctor's previous companions, in particular Sarah Jane and K-9, was first proposed in 2003 to the BBC. After the episode was produced, Elisabeth Sladen was approached by the BBC to star in a [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]], ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'', which also included K-9 in several stories. The episode was positively reviewed, with an [[Appreciation Index]] of 85% ("Excellent").

==Plot==
[[List of Doctor Who villains#Mr Finch|Mr. Finch]], the headmaster of Deffry Vale School, has been changing the school to improve the students' performance; his changes include free lunches with special [[french fries|chips]]. [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]], under the alias "[[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Alias the Doctor|John Smith]]", is undercover as a science teacher in the school and is intrigued by the uncommon intelligence of one of the students. His companion, Rose Tyler, is working undercover in the school's [[cafeteria]]. Both the Doctor and Rose relate the mysterious events around the school to the chips: Rose observes that the chip oil has an adverse effect on the other kitchen staff, while the Doctor notes that the chips themselves are making children more intelligent.

The oddities of the new system of instruction has aroused media attention <U+2014> in particular, the attention of investigative journalist [[Sarah Jane Smith]]. While at first the Doctor feigns ignorance, when Sarah Jane discovers the [[TARDIS]] during the night, he is forced to admit his identity. Sarah Jane meets Rose and Mickey, with an immediate rivalry sparking between the two women. As the group searches the school, they find thirteen bat-like creatures asleep in Finch's office. Returning to Sarah Jane's car, the journalist reveals a battered, inactive [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9 Mark III]], who<U+2014>once repaired<U+2014>identifies the substance as [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Krillitane|Krillitane]] oil. Rose, unaware that the Doctor had even had past companions, confronts him; he replies sadly that, while she can spend the rest of her life with him, he cannot spend the rest of his life with her.

The following day, the group returns to the school to investigate further. The Doctor confronts Mr. Finch, who confirms that he and the others are Krillitanes - a composite species that takes desirable attributes of the species they conquer. He attempts to subvert the Doctor, without success. Meanwhile, Sarah Jane and Rose, now getting on better than at their first meeting, try to unlock the programming on the school's computers; Mickey and K-9 remain in Sarah Jane's car for surveillance. With the Doctor's help, they discover that the computers - bolstered by the students' enhanced intelligence - are part of a Krillitane effort to solve the "Skasis Paradigm", a [[theory of everything]]. As the paradigm is nearly solved <U+2014> which would allow the Krillitanes full control over time and space <U+2014> the Krillitanes seal the school. Mr. Finch propositions the Doctor a second time, tempting him with the ability to save the [[Time Lords]] and override human mortality. With Sarah Jane's counseling, the Doctor refuses, and they run from Mr. Finch. Mickey crashes Sarah Jane's car through the school's doors and unplugs the computers, allowing the children to flee. The Doctor leads the Krillitanes to the kitchen; upon their arrival, K-9 opens fire on the chip oil container. As the oil floods the room it destroys the Krillitanes, the school, and himself.

At episode's end, Rose, Sarah Jane, Mickey, and the Doctor are standing in the TARDIS. Sarah Jane declines a second chance of travelling in the TARDIS. Mickey says he would like to join the TARDIS crew, a suggestion of which Sarah Jane approves. She then asks Rose to stay with the Doctor and - if she needs help - to find her. Sarah Jane then gets a chance to part properly with the Doctor, who leaves her with a brand new K-9 as a parting gift.

==Production==
The concept of Sarah-Jane and K-9 returning to Doctor Who was an idea of [[Russell T Davies]] from pitching the show in 2003. While K-9's return did not survive through production, the return of a previous companion was one of Davies' favourite ideas, and was placed in the second series. Such a use would show what would happen after a companion left the Doctor, without dwelling too much on the classic series. It was Davies' full intention for Sarah Jane to be used for this, and while Sladen originally denied a request, thinking her role would not be important, she changed her mind when she realised she would be the focal point of the adventure.<ref name="brief">Sullivan, Shannon. {{Brief | id=2006c | title=School Reunion | quotes=y}} Retrieved on 20 January 2008.</ref> After production of the episode was finished, Sladen was approached about a full spin-off series, ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'', which was formally announced on 14 September 2006.<ref name="brief2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/sarahjane/2007a.html|title=Invasion of the Bane|work=A Brief History of Time (Travel)|accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref>

The episode went through several changes in production: working titles included "Old Friends" and "Black Ops", the latter being set in an army base. Davies requested that Whithouse set it in a school instead, mainly for simplicity, but also for a desire for the Doctor to masquerade as a school teacher.<ref name="brief" /> Additionally, the Krillitanes were to be named "Krillians" until the BBC found the name was trademarked, and Finch's forename was originally Hector, until the BBC found a real teacher by the same name, and renamed him Lucas.<ref name="brief" /> K-9's eye grill was initially filmed flashing in sync with his lines, not unlike the Daleks, until Phil Collinson saw the footage and nixed the practice (which was inconsistent with the robot dog's past appearances).<ref name="brief" /> A scene that was cut was of Milo's brain being "shorted out" by the Doctor's rapid-fire questions at the beginning of the episode, which was later alluded to in the episode.<ref name="brief" />

The episode, originally in the second production block, was produced in the first block along with "[[The Christmas Invasion]]" and "[[New Earth]]". Two high schools in Wales were used for filming: [[Fitzalan High School]] in [[Leckwith]] was used on 23 August and 24 August 2005, for filming the first conversation between the Doctor and Finch, and for the playground, kitchen, and cafeteria scenes, and Duffryn High School in [[Newport]], which was used between 25 August and 6 September for the remainder of the episode, with filming delayed due to [[asbestos]] being discovered in Duffryn High School's structure. The scenes in the schools utilised dozens of children as extras. Pick-up shots were later completed on 7 September and 8 September, with filming of the cafe scene delayed due to [[public intoxication|drunk and disorderly conduct]] from members of the public.<ref name="brief" />

==Continuity==
* Sarah Jane left the Fourth Doctor at the end of the 1976 serial ''[[The Hand of Fear]]'' which ended with her standing in a street far from her home of South Croydon but otherwise unspecified; it was revealed in this episode that the Doctor left her in Aberdeen.
* Sarah Jane received K-9 Mark III in the pilot (and sole) episode of ''[[K-9 and Company]]'', K-9 having been sent to her by the Doctor two years earlier.
* Sarah Jane and K-9 were last seen canonically in "[[The Five Doctors]]". Sarah Jane was later seen in the non-canonical "Dimensions in Time" (as was an unidentified K-9) and ''[[Downtime (Doctor Who)|Downtime]]''.
* In Sarah Jane's next appearance, "[[Invasion of the Bane]]", she uses the same method as Mickey and K-9 use to gain access through locked exterior doors.
* Although Sarah Jane turns down the Doctor's offer to travel again with him, she later does so in "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]" and "[[Death of the Doctor]]".
* It is revealed in "Invasion of the Bane" that the Doctor hid additional tools for Sarah Jane within K-9's body at the end of this episode, including a "sonic lipstick" (or multiple sonic lipsticks, according to "[[Enemy of the Bane]]") and a wristwatch that scans for alien lifeforms.

==Broadcast and reception==
The episode was watched by 8.3 million viewers, the twelfth most-watched programme of the week, with an [[Appreciation Index]] score of 85%.<ref name="brief" /> Jacob Clifton of [[Television Without Pity]] gave the episode an A+ rating, and jokingly stated that he "didn't know why the Doctor was fucking around [during the Physics lesson]: he taught Physics at Coal Hill School way back in '63".<ref>{{Cite web|url=
