'''Germinal matrix hemorrhage''' is a bleeding into the sub[[ependyma]]l [[germinal matrix]] with or without subsequent rupture into the [[lateral ventricle]].

== Pathophysiology ==

The germinal matrix is the site of proliferating neuronal and glial precursors in the developing brain, which is located above the [[caudate nucleus]], in the floor of the [[lateral ventricle]], and caudothalamic groove. The germinal matrix contains a rich network of fragile thin-walled blood vessels. Hence the microcirculation in this particular area is extremely sensitive to hypoxia and changes in perfusion pressure. It is most frequent before 35 weeks [[gestation]] and is typically seen in very low birth-weight (<1500g) [[Premature birth|premature infants]],because they lack the ability for auto regulation of cerebral blood flow. Consequently increased arterial blood pressure in these blood vessels leads to rupture and hemorrhage into germinal matrix.

== Clinical Features ==
This may lead to various neurological sequelae including presentation with cerebral palsy, mental retardation and seizures.

== Grades ==

Four grades are distinguished (by imaging or histology):
*grade I - hemorrhage is confined to the germinal matrix
*grade II - intraventricular hemorrhage without ventricular dilatation
*grade III - intraventricular hemorrhage with ventricular dilatation
*grade IV - intraventricular rupture and hemorrhage into the surrounding white matter

== Treatment ==
Antenatal corticosteroids have a role in reducing incidence of germinal matrix hemorrhage in premature infants.
