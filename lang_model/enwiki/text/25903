This is a '''chronology of Irish War of Independence''' (or the '''Anglo Irish War'''<ref>The war is often referred to as the "Irish War of Independence" in Ireland and as the "Anglo-Irish War" in Britain, the "Tan War" by anti-Treaty republicans and was known contemporarily as "the Troubles", not to be confused with the later conflict in Northern Ireland, which is also referred to as the "[[the Troubles]]".</ref>) of 1919&ndash;1921. The [[Irish War of Independence]] was a [[guerrilla]] conflict and most of the fighting was conducted on a small scale by the standards of conventional warfare. Although there were some large scale encounters between the [[Irish Republican Army]] and the British state forces ([[Royal Irish Constabulary]] and [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]] [[paramilitary]] Police units - the [[Black and Tans]] and the [[Auxiliary Division]] - and the regular [[British Army]]), most of the casualties were inflicted in assassinations and reprisals on either side. The war began with an unauthorized ambush by IRA men [[Dan Breen]] and [[Se<U+00E1>n Treacy (Irish Republican)|Se<U+00E1>n Treacy]] at [[Soloheadbeg]] in 1919 and officially ended with a truce agreed in July 1921. However, violence continued, particularly in the disputed territory of [[Northern Ireland]] until mid 1922. In the south of Ireland, the war of Independence was immediately followed by the [[Irish Civil War]] between supporters and opponents of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]].
