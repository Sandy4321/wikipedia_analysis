'''''diana''''' is a [[1980 in music|1980]] album by American [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Diana Ross]], released by [[Motown]]. Her 11th [[studio album]], it was, and still is, the biggest-selling studio collection of Ross' career.

==Conception==
Following the U.S. success of 1979's ''[[The Boss (album)|The Boss]]'', Ross wanted a fresher, more modern sound. Production team [[Bernard Edwards]] and [[Nile Rodgers]] of [[Chic (band)|Chic]] had recently written a whole album's worth of material with [[Aretha Franklin]] in mind. Franklin had however declined the offer and all the songs, including "[[Upside Down]]", were subsequently passed on to Ross.

What proved to be a grueling recording process with the singer was made even longer when Ross abandoned the sessions after producers Edwards and Rodgers in no uncertain terms informed her she was singing flat. Despite repeated conflicts between the producers and the singer during the recording sessions, the album was completed. Reportedly, Ross was not pleased with its results. Following an advance preview of the record to be released in the aftermath of the [[Disco#Backlash and decline|anti-disco backlash]], Frankie Crocker, an influential New York City disc jockey warned Ross it would even be the end of her career.

When the master tapes were submitted to Motown in March 1980, a nervous Ross consequently remixed the entire album, assisted by Motown engineer Russ Terrana, toning down the funkier elements of Chic's playing, removing extended instrumental passages and speeding up the tracks' tempos to give the singer's voice a brighter, more youthful sound. The new mix also put Ross' vocals front and center.  The remixing of the master tapes and the re-recording of all Ross' lead vocals were performed without the knowledge or approval of Rodgers and Edwards. When they were presented with the "official" version of ''diana'', the producers publicly objected and, at one point, even considered removing their names from the album's list of credits. Motown and Ross persisted and the version released was Terrana's smoother, more commercial mix of the album.  Rodgers and Edwards were contracted by Motown to produce a follow-up album, but, as Ross left the label, it was never created. Rodgers and Edwards sued Motown, unsuccessfully claiming that they were owed monies for creating & recording the original version of the album. Rodgers and Ross were however to collaborate on album, upon her return to Motown in 1989; ''[[Workin' Overtime]]''. Edwards did produce one single for her in 1984; ("Telephone").

==Reception==
Released in May 1980, the ''diana'' album introduced Ross to a new generation of fans worldwide. Reaching number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and number one on the ''Billboard'' Soul Albums Chart, as well as yielding two [[Billboard Hot 100|top ten]] singles including the number-one single "[[Upside Down]]", the album would sell over six million copies worldwide and be certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. In the UK it spun off three successful singles; "Upside Down" (number two, twelve weeks on the chart<U+2014>marking the highest peak performance from Ross as a solo artist since "[[I'm Still Waiting]]" in 1971), "My Old Piano" (number five, nine weeks) and "I'm Coming Out" (number thirteen, ten weeks). A fourth single, "Tenderness", was also released in certain territories and was later included on several greatest hits compilations. Some thirty years after its release ''diana'' remains Ross' best-selling studio album to date having sold a total of ten million copies worldwide.

''diana'' was one of four albums written and produced by Edwards and Rodgers in 1980, the other three being  [[Sister Sledge]]'s ''[[Love Somebody Today]]'', [[Sheila and B. Devotion]]'s ''[[King of the World (album)|King of the World]]'' including European hit single "Spacer", and [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s fourth studio album ''[[Real People (album)|Real People]]''.

Following the release of two more singles, the duet "[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]" with [[Lionel Richie]] and "[[It's My Turn]]", both worldwide hits, Ross left Motown and signed a then-record breaking $20 million recording deal with [[RCA Records]]. The first album for the label was 1981's self-produced ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (album)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'', which went platinum and spawned two Top 10 hits in the US. ''diana'' was remastered and released as a double CD in 2003 containing the original unremixed versions, together with a selection of other Motown dance tracks from the same period.
