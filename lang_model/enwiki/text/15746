== Biography ==
Barrowman was born in Mount Vernon, Glasgow, where he spent the first eight years of his life. His mother worked in a record shop and his father worked for the [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] heavy machinery company in nearby [[Uddingston]]. In 1975 the family was relocated to [[United States|America]] with his father's work<ref>[http://www.johnbarrowman.com/ John Barrowman official website], biography section</ref>.

He spent the next few years of his life in [[Joliet, Illinois]], where his father was a manager at the Caterpillar tractor factory.  Barrowman graduated from Joliet West High School in 1985.  While still in high school, he won parts in several musical productions while still a freshman. Between 1983 and 1985 he performed in productions of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', ''[[Oliver!]]'', ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', ''[[Li'l Abner (musical)|Li'l Abner]]'' and ''[[Anything Goes]]''. He attended university in [[San Diego]], and returned to the United Kingdom in [[1990]].

===Acting career===
Barrowman's musical abilities have been featured in film: he had a duet with [[Kevin Kline]] in the [[Cole Porter]] biopic ''[[De-Lovely]]'', and he sang "[[Springtime for Hitler]]" in the film of [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[The Producers (2005 film)|The Producers]]'', based on the  [[The Producers (musical)|Broadway adaptation]] of the [[The Producers (1968 film)|original movie]]. He also recently performed in and co-presented a BBC One series on Saturday nights, entitled ''[[The Sound of Musicals]]'', in which performers from [[West End theatre|West End]] musicals sing songs from the shows.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,1561687,00.html | title=It's showtime on BBC1 | format=needs registration | date=[[September 2]], [[2005]] }}</ref>

His professional debut was in the 1989 [[London]] [[West End theatre|West End]] production of Cole Porter's ''[[Anything Goes]]'', playing Billy Crocker, a role that he reprised in [[Trevor Nunn]]'s 2003 West End revival. He has also appeared in the West End productions of ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Matador (musical)|Matador]]'', ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease!]]'', ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (as Raoul). 

He was nominated for an [[Laurence Olivier Awards|Olivier Award]] for Best Actor in a Musical in 1998 for originating the role of Cal Chandler in ''[[The Fix (play)|The Fix]]''<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.albemarle-london.com/awards/AwardWinners.php?Award_Type=Laurence%20Olivier%20Awards&Year=1998 |title=1998 Olivier Awards winners and nominations |accessdate=2007-05-21 |work=Albermarle of London }}</ref>, a performance he repeated in [[Cameron Mackintosh]]'s 1998 gala concert ''Hey, Mr Producer!''. He has played the role of Joe Gillis in ''Sunset Boulevard'' in the West End and, briefly, on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. His only other Broadway credit is the [[Stephen Sondheim]] revue ''[[Putting It Together]]'' (1999<U+2013>2000). In 2002, he appeared in the central role of Bobby in Sondheim's ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' in the [[Kennedy Center]]'s Stephen Sondheim Celebration.

He has also appeared in the West End in non-musical dramas, such as ''[[Rope (play)|Rope]]'' and the 2005 production of ''[[A Few Good Men]]'', in which Barrowman starred as Jack Ross opposite [[Rob Lowe]]. He has starred in the [[pantomime]]s ''[[Cinderella]]'' at the [[New Wimbledon Theatre]] (Christmas 2005<U+2013>6) and ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' at [[New Theatre (Cardiff)|Cardiff's New Theatre]] (Christmas 2006<U+2013>7).  He will play the title role in  ''[[Aladdin]]'' at the [[Birmingham Hippodrome]] over Christmas 2007<U+2013>8.<ref>{{cite press release | title=John Barrowman to play Aladdin!  | publisher=[[Birmingham Hippodrome]] | date=[[2007-06-05]] | url=http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/?page=106&nsID=213 | accessdate=2007-06-05 }}</ref>

He is probably best known in the United States for starring roles in several short-lived [[prime-time]] [[soap opera]]s such as ''[[Titans (television series)|Titans]]'' with [[Yasmine Bleeth]] in [[2000]] and ''[[Central Park West]]'', as well as the low-budget cult film ''[[Shark Attack 3: Megalodon]]''.

Barrowman, who is gay, was under consideration for the role of Will in the popular US series ''[[Will and Grace]]'' but the producers felt he was "too straight" and the role went to [[Eric McCormack]] instead, who is straight.  "The sad thing is it's run by gay men and women," said Barrowman in a January 2006 article.<ref>{{cite web | title=Gay Doctor Who star was too straight for Will and Grace | publisher=Pink News | date =[[13 January]] [[2006]] | url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-327.html}}</ref> He later expressed contempt at the idea that all gay men act the same way.<ref name="Metro"/>

He has appeared playing an occasional character in [[BBC One]]'s [[science fiction on television|science fiction television series]] ''[[Doctor Who|Doctor Who]]'', since [[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|Queer as Folk]] creator [[Russell T. Davies|Russell T. Davies]] revived the series in 2005. Barrowman first appeared as [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]] in ''The Empty Child''/''The Doctor Dances'' two-part story, and subsequently appeared in ''Boom Town'', ''Bad Wolf'' and ''The Parting of the Ways'' in 2006, and in the 2007 season's ''Utopia'', ''The Sound of Drums'', and season finale ''Last of the Time Lords''.

Barrowman continues in the role of Harkness in 2008's second season of Davies's ''[[Torchwood|Torchwood]]'', an adult-orientated spin-off from ''Doctor Who'', whose title is an [[anagram]] of "Doctor Who". The spin-off's first 13-week season of the  - set in modern [[Cardiff|Cardiff]]- was shown on [[BBC Three|BBC Three]], [[BBC One|BBC One]] and the [[BBC|BBC]]'s [[BBC HD|BBC HD]] satellite and cable high definition channel. Harkness is Davies's main addition to the roster of characters that have been careening through space and time parallel to The Doctor on BBC TV since 1963. In both shows Harkness appears to be omnisexual.

In the first series of ''Torchwood'', Barrowman's character headed an organization apparently investigating  crime and alien activity. (In ''Tooth & Claw'', episode 2 of 2006's ''Doctor Who'' season - without Harkness - Torchwood was created by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] after Her meeting with The Doctor at Torchwood House in the [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish Highlands]], during which she banished The Doctor and determined that Britain must be defended against alien/supernatural forces - hence Torchwood.) Because of [[Doctor Who|The Doctor]]'s ministrations and a mistake his then companion Rose Tyler made, Harkness, a time agent from the far future who assumed the identity of a [[World War II|World War II]] flyer, can not die, according to dialogue in the June 23, 2007 episode of ''Doctor Who''.

Barrowman has also appeared in on a ''Doctor Who'' special of the BBC's ''[[The Weakest Link]]''.<ref>{{cite news

In 2006, he was on the judging panel of [[BBC One]]'s talent search show [[How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?]], which discovered [[Connie Fisher]] to star in [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s revival of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' - a format which 'influenced' [[NBC]]'s search for stars  in a revival of ''[[Grease]]''. And in 2007, he officiated on the panel of [[BBC One]]'s ''[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do!]]'', which discovered [[Lee Mead]] as the star in a revival of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber|Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]]'s ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'', which opens at [[London]]'s [[Adelphi Theatre]] on [[17 July]] [[2007]].

===Presenting and guest starring===
Barrowman appeared in the [[BBC]] children's Saturday morning variety show ''[[Live & Kicking]]'', in which he hosted the ''Electric Circus'' segment, reporting on technology news, before moving on to ''[[The Movie Game (TV Series)|The Movie Game]]'', a children's television game show. In the late [[1990]]'s he was one of the regular presenters on [[Five (channel)|Five's]] afternoon show ''Five's Company''.

During January and February [[2006]] Barrowman took part in the [[ITV1]] series ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'', where [[Jayne Torvill]] and [[Christopher Dean]] trained celebrities to compete in an ice skating show which took onboard many characteristics of a real ice skating competition. Barrowman's skating partner was World Junior Gold Medalist and three-time Russian champion [[Olga Sharutenko]]. Although a favourite to win, on [[4 February]], Barrowman and Sharutenko faced [[Stefan Booth]] and [[Kristina Cousins]] in the skate off and were eliminated by the judge's vote of 3 to 2.

Between [[10 April]] and [[14 April]], [[2006]], Barrowman presented [[ITV]]'s morning talk show ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'' whilst [[Phillip Schofield]] took an [[Easter]] [[Vacation|Break]]. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16807139&method=full&siteid=94762&headline=exclusive--dr-s-jack-takes-on-itv-sofa-name_page.html | title=Exclusive: Dr's Jack takes on ITV sofa | publisher=[[The Daily Mirror]] | author=Cameron Robertson | date=[[March 13]], [[2006]] }}</ref> Between [[1 May]] and [[5 May]], [[2006]], Barrowman read bedtime stories on the [[CBeebies]] channel. In [[Summer]] 2006, he was on the Judges panel of BBC One's ''[[How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?]]'' music talent show alongside [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], [[David Ian]], and [[Zoe Tyler]]. <ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/06_june/06/maria.shtml |title=How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? panel chosen | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=[[June 6]], [[2006]] }}</ref>

His second appearance was as a guest on a team with [[Craig Revel Horwood]] and [[Louis Walsh]], on [[Graham Norton]]'s one-off programme, ''The Big Finish''<ref name="CatchingUp" /> which was also broadcast on [[BBC Television]].  It was a light-hearted look at news stories in [[2006]].

On [[February 11]], [[2007]], he co-presented the [[E!|E!: Entertainment Television]] [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Film Awards]] [[red carpet]] coverage with [[Ruby Wax]].<ref>{{cite web

In 2007 Barrowman was a judge in the [[BBC One]] TV series ''"[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do]]"'' to find a new star to play the lead role in [[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat|Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]], won on June 9 by [[Lee Mead|Lee Mead]], of whom he said: "Lee won because he is polished, professional and close to perfection in what he does. He goes on stage and commands it, and one of the best qualities about him is that he doesn't analyse the song too much. He just gets out there and does it. I'm happy to give over my West End leading man's shoes for a while, to allow him to fill them." [http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/06_june/09/dream.shtml] "The West End had need of Lee Mead," he says on a post-final party on video posted at [[Andrew Lloyd Webber|Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s website. [http://www.andrewlloydwebber.com/sections/news/newsdb.php?article=83]

He has also guested on [[BBC Two]] comedy panel quiz show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks|Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' ([[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes|Series 19, Episode 5]]) , challenging host [[Simon Amstell|Simon Amstell]] to a "gay-off", ''[[Al Murray's Happy Hour]]'', ''[[The Charlotte Church Show]]'', and ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]''.

Despite this long-standing relationship, Barrowman told [[Scotland]]'s ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' newspaper that he had no plans to [[same-sex marriage|marry]], saying: "Why would I want a 'marriage' from a belief system that hates me?". However, he and Gill became [[Civil partnerships in the United Kingdom|civil partners]] on [[December 27]] [[2006]]. As Barrowman explained when the couple were interviewed by ''[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]'' magazine, the couple do not want to call this a marriage: "We're just going to sign the civil register.

Barrowman is bidialectal. He learned an [[American accent]] after school children picked on his [[Scottish accent]] when he moved to the [[USA]].

While visiting the gardens at [[Highgrove]], the home of the UK's [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], he was "caught short", he said on [[23 June]][[2007]]'s edition of [[BBC One]]'s  ''Would I Lie To You'' comedy quiz. While urinating in the garden, he set off an alarm.
