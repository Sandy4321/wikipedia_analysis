{{nihongo|'''Hayabusa'''|<U+306F><U+3084><U+3076><U+3055>|extra=literally "[[peregrine falcon]]"}} was an [[Robotic spacecraft|unmanned spacecraft]] developed by the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] to [[Sample return mission|return a sample of material]] from a small [[near-Earth asteroid]] named [[25143 Itokawa]] to [[Earth]] for further analysis. 

Hayabusa, formerly known as '''MUSES-C''' for [[Mu (rocket family)|Mu]] Space Engineering Spacecraft C, was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005.  After arriving at Itokawa, Hayabusa studied the asteroid's shape, spin, topography, colour, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid and collected samples in the form of tiny grains of asteroidal material, which were returned to Earth aboard the spacecraft on 13 June 2010.

The spacecraft also carried a detachable minilander, [[#MINERVA_mini-lander|MINERVA]], but this failed to reach the surface.

== Mission firsts ==
[[Image:D. Moura and J. Kawaguchi IAC 2010.jpg|thumb|Denis J. P. Moura (left) and Junichiro Kawaguchi (right) at the 2010 [[International Astronautical Congress]] (IAC)]]
Other spacecraft, notably [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] and [[NEAR Shoemaker]] both sent by [[NASA]], have visited asteroids before, but the Hayabusa mission was the first time that an attempt was made to return an asteroid sample to Earth for analysis.

In addition, Hayabusa was the first spacecraft designed to deliberately land on an asteroid and then take off again (''NEAR Shoemaker'' made a controlled descent to the surface of [[433 Eros]] in 2000, but it was not designed as a lander and was eventually deactivated after it arrived). Technically, Hayabusa was not designed to "land"; it simply touches the surface with its sample capturing device and then moves away. However, it was the first craft designed from the outset to make contact with the surface of an asteroid. Junichiro Kawaguchi of the [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]] was appointed to the leader of the mission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/458/two-way-asteroid-trip-takes-off|title=Two-Way Asteroid Trip Takes Off|work=Astrobiology Magazine|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=May 12, 2003|accessdate=November 16, 2010}}</ref>

Despite its designer's intention of a momentary contact, Hayabusa did land and sit on the asteroid surface for about 30 minutes (see [[#In proximity of Itokawa|timeline]] below).

== Mission profile ==
[[Image:Hayabusa IAC 2010.jpg|thumb|The half-scale model of Hayabusa at the IAC in 2010]]
The Hayabusa spacecraft was launched on 9 May 2003 at 04:29:25 UTC on an [[M-V]] rocket from the [[Uchinoura Space Center]] (still called [[Kagoshima Space Center]] at that time). Following launch, the spacecraft's name was changed from the original MUSES-C to Hayabusa, the Japanese word for [[falcon]]. The spacecraft's xenon [[ion engine]]s (four separate units), operating near-continuously for two years, slowly moved Hayabusa toward a September 2005 rendezvous with Itokawa. As it arrived, the spacecraft did not go into orbit around the asteroid, but remained in a station-keeping [[heliocentric]] orbit close by.

Hayabusa surveyed the asteroid surface from a distance of about 20&nbsp;km, the "gate position". After this the spacecraft moved closer to the surface (the "home position"), and then approached the asteroid for a series of soft landings and for the collection of samples at a safe site. [[Autonomous robot|Autonomous]] optical navigation was employed extensively during this period because the long communication delay prohibits Earth-based real-time commanding. At the second Hayabusa touchdown with its deployable collection horn, the spacecraft was programmed to fire tiny projectiles at the surface and then collect the resulting spray. Some tiny specks were collected by the spacecraft for analysis back on Earth.

After a few months in proximity to the asteroid, the spacecraft was scheduled to fire its engines to begin its cruise back to Earth. This maneuver was delayed due to problems with attitude control and the thrusters of the craft. Once it was on its return trajectory, the re-entry capsule was released from the main spacecraft three hours before reentry<!-- at a distance of about 300,000 to 400,000&nbsp;km from the Earth -->, and the capsule coasted on a ballistic trajectory, re-entering the Earth's atmosphere at 13:51, 13 June 2010 UTC.  It is estimated that the capsule experienced peak deceleration of about 25 G and heating rates approximately 30 times those experienced by the [[Apollo spacecraft]].  It landed via parachute near [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]], Australia.

In relation to the mission profile, JAXA defined the following success criteria and corresponding scores for major milestones in the mission prior to the launch of the Hayabusa spacecraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/enterp/missions/hayabusa/today.shtml |title=Hot Information HAYABUSA: Resumption of return cruise by combining two ion engines | publisher = JAXA | date = 24 November 2009 | accessdate = 27 November 2009 }}</ref> As it shows, the Hayabusa spacecraft is a platform for testing new technology and the primary objective of the Hayabusa project is the world's first implementation of microwave discharge ion engines.  Hence 'operation of ion engines for more than 1000 hours' is an achievement that gives a full score of 100 points, and the rest of the milestones are a series of world's first-time experiments built on it.

== MINERVA mini-lander ==

Hayabusa carried a tiny mini-[[Lander (spacecraft)|lander]] (weighing only {{Nowrap|591 g}}, and approximately 10&nbsp;cm tall by 12&nbsp;cm in diameter) named "MINERVA" (short for MIcro/Nano Experimental Robot Vehicle for Asteroid). Unfortunately, an error during deployment resulted in the craft's failure.

This solar-powered vehicle was designed to take advantage of Itokawa's very low gravity by using an internal flywheel assembly to hop across the surface of the asteroid, relaying images from its cameras to Hayabusa whenever the two spacecraft were in sight of one another.<ref>{{cite journal|last=T. Yoshimitsu|coauthors=S. Sasaki, M. Yanagisawa, T. Kubota|year=2004|title=Scientific capability of Minerva rover in Hayabusa asteroid mission|journal=Lunar and Planetary Science|volume=35|pages=1517<U+2013>1518|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2004/pdf/1517.pdf}}</ref>

MINERVA was deployed on 12 November 2005. The lander release command was sent from Earth, but before the command could arrive, Hayabusa's altimeter measured its distance from Itokawa to be {{Nowrap|44 m}} and thus started an automatic altitude keeping sequence. As a result, when the MINERVA release command arrived, MINERVA was released while the probe was ascending and at a higher altitude than intended, so that it escaped Itokawa's gravitational pull and tumbled into space.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10013920/|title=Asteroid-hopping robot misses its mark|last=Oberg|first=James|date=2005-11-14|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2009-03-07}}</ref><ref>
{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/j/snews/2005/1113.shtml |title=<U+5206><U+96E2><U+5F8C><U+306E><U+300C><U+30DF><U+30CD><U+30EB><U+30D0><U+300D><U+304C><U+300C><U+306F><U+3084><U+3076><U+3055><U+300D><U+3092><U+64AE><U+5F71> |date=2005-11-13 |publisher=JAXA |accessdate=2009-04-16}}</ref>

Had it been successful, MINERVA would have been the first space hopper to see action. Instead it joins ranks with the hopper carried on the failed [[Phobos program|Phobos 2 mission]], which also never saw use.

== Scientific and engineering importance of the mission ==
Scientists' current understanding of asteroids depends greatly on meteorite samples, but it is very difficult to match up meteorite samples with the exact asteroids from which they came. Hayabusa would solve this problem by bringing back pristine samples from a specific, well-characterized asteroid. Accordingly, Hayabusa "will bridge the gap between ground observation data of asteroids and laboratory analysis of meteorite and cosmic dust collections," says mission scientist Hajime Yano.<ref>"Japan's asteroid archaeologist", [[Sky and Telescope]], June 2005, pp. 34<U+2013>37</ref> Also in comparing the data from the onboard instruments of the Hayabusa with the data from the [[NEAR Shoemaker|NEAR Shoemaker mission]] will put the knowledge on a wider level.

The Hayabusa mission has a very deep engineering importance for JAXA, too. It allows JAXA to further test its technologies in the fields of ion engines, autonomous and optical navigation, deep space communication, and close movement on objects with low gravity among others. Second, since it was the first-ever preplanned soft contact with the surface of an asteroid (the NEAR Shoemaker landing on 433 Eros was not preplanned) it has enormous influence on further asteroid missions.

== Changes in mission plan ==
The Hayabusa mission profile has been modified several times, both before and after launch. 
* The spacecraft was originally intended to launch in July 2002 to the asteroid [[4660 Nereus]] (the asteroid [[(10302) 1989 ML]] was considered as an alternative target).  However, a July 2000 failure of Japan's [[M-5 rocket]] forced a delay in the launch, putting both Nereus and 1989 ML out of reach.  As a result, the target asteroid was changed to [[25143 Itokawa|{{mp|1998 SF|36}}]], which was soon thereafter named for Japanese rocket pioneer [[Hideo Itokawa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/news/2004/0520_Japans_Hayabusa_MUSESC_Swings_By.html |title=Japan's Hayabusa [MUSES-C&#93; Swings By Earth on Way to Asteroid Itokawa <U+2013> Planetary News &#124; The Planetary Society |publisher=Planetary.org |date=2004-05-20 |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref>
* Hayabusa was to deploy a small rover supplied by [[NASA]] and developed by [[JPL]], called Muses-CN, onto the surface of the asteroid, but the rover was canceled by NASA in November 2000 due to budget constraints.
* In 2002, launch was postponed from December 2002 to May 2003 to recheck the [[O-ring]]s of its [[reaction control system]] since one of them had been found to be using a different material than specified.<ref name="isasnews20020925">{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/ISASnews/No.259/isas.html#muses-c |title=MUSES-C <U+6253><U+3061><U+4E0A><U+3052><U+5EF6><U+671F> |author=Kuninori Uesugi |publisher=ISAS |date=2010-10 |issue=259 |journal=ISAS News |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref>
* In 2003, while Hayabusa was en-route to Itokawa, a large [[solar flare]] damaged the [[solar cell]]s aboard the spacecraft.  This reduction in electrical power reduced the efficiency of the ion engines, thus delaying the arrival at Itokawa from June to September 2005.  Since orbital mechanics dictated that the spacecraft still had to leave the asteroid by November 2005, the amount of the time it was able to spend at Itokawa was greatly reduced and the number of landings on the asteroid was reduced from three to two.
* In 2005, two [[reaction wheel]]s that govern the attitude movement of Hayabusa failed; the X-axis wheel failed on July 31, and the Y-axis on October 2. After the latter failure, the spacecraft was still able to turn on its X and Y axes with its thrusters. JAXA claimed that since global mapping of Itokawa had been completed, this was not a major problem, but the mission plan was altered. The failed reaction wheels were manufactured by Ithaco Space Systems, Inc, New York, which was later acquired by [[Goodrich Company]].
* The 4 November 2005, 'rehearsal' landing on Itokawa failed, and was rescheduled.
* The original decision to sample two different sites on the asteroid was changed when one of the sites, Woomera Desert, was found to be too rocky for a safe landing.
* The 12 November 2005, release of the MINERVA miniprobe ended in failure.

== Mission timeline ==
=== Up to the launch ===
The asteroid exploration mission by [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science|ISAS]] originates in 1986<U+2013>1987 when the scientists investigated the feasibility of a sample return mission to [[1943 Anteros|Anteros]] and concluded that the technology was not yet developed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/special/2003/kawaguchi/index.shtml |title=HAYABUSA: Research in the Asteroid 'Sample & Return' Explorer, "HAYABUSA" / Special Feature |publisher=ISAS |date=2003-05-09 |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref> Between 1987 and 1994, joint ISAS / NASA group studied several missions: an asteroid rendezvous mission later became [[NEAR Shoemaker|NEAR]], and a comet sample return mission later became [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/science/details.html#histinvest |title=Stardust &#124; JPL &#124; NASA |publisher=Stardust.jpl.nasa.gov |date=1994-10-21 |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref>

In 1995, ISAS selected the asteroid sampling as an engineering demonstration mission, MUSES-C, Nereus as the first choice of target, [[(10302) 1989 ML|1989 ML]] as the secondary choice, and MUSES-C project started in fiscal year 1996. In early development phase, Nereus was considered out of reach and 1989 ML became the primary target.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.minorbody.org/yuseijin/interview/interview04.html |title=MUSES-C<U+306E><U+5927><U+3044><U+306A><U+308B><U+6311><U+6226><U+301C><U+4E16><U+754C><U+521D><U+306E><U+5C0F><U+60D1><U+661F><U+30B5><U+30F3><U+30D7><U+30EB><U+30EA><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30F3><U+3078><U+5411><U+3051><U+3066><U+301C> |title_trans=Great Challenges in MUSES-C: The World's first sample-return mission from an asteroid |language=Japanese |journal=Planetary People |publisher=Japanese Society for Planetary Sciences |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=2002 }}</ref> July 2000 failure of [[M-V]] forced a delay in the launch from July 2002 to November/December, putting both Nereus and 1989 ML out of reach.

=== Cruising ===
Ion thruster checkout started on 27 May 2003.  Full power operation started on 25 June.

Asteroids are named by their discoverer.  ISAS asked [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|LINEAR]], the discoverer of {{mp|1998 SF|36}}, to offer the name after [[Hideo Itokawa]], and on 6 August, [[Minor Planet Circular]] reported that the target asteroid {{mp|1998 SF|36}} was named ''Itokawa''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2003/asteroids2.html |title=MIT's LINEAR asteroid named for Japan's 'Dr. Rocket' |publisher=MIT |date=September 29, 2003 |accessdate=June 19, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/ECS/MPCArchive/2003/MPC_20030806.pdf |title=The Minor Planet Circulars/Minor Planets and Comets |publisher=Minor Planet Center |issn=0736-6884 |date=2003-08-06 |accessdate=2009-11-27}}</ref>

On October 2003, ISAS and two other national aerospace agencies were merged to form [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]].

On March 31, 2004, ion thruster operation was stopped to prepare for the Earth swing-by.<ref>{{cite

=== In proximity of Itokawa ===
On 15 September, a 'colour' image of the asteroid was released (which is, however, grey in colouring).<ref>{{cite web|author=Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency |url=http://www.isas.ac.jp/e/snews/2005/0914.shtml |title=The synthesized pseudo-color image of Itokawa which took by Hayabusa / Topics |publisher=ISAS |date=2005-09-14 |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref> On 4 October, JAXA announced that the spacecraft had successfully moved to its 'Home Position' 7&nbsp;km from Itokawa. Closeup pictures were released. It was also announced that the spacecraft's second reaction wheel, governing the Y-axis, had failed, and that the craft was now being pointed by its rotation thrusters.<ref>{{cite web|author=Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/snews/2005/1004.shtml |title=Hayabusa arrives at Home Position, and Current Status of Hayabusa Spacecraft / Topics |publisher=ISAS |date=2005-10-04 |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref> On November 3, Hayabusa took station 3.0&nbsp;km from Itokawa. It then began its descent, planned to include delivery of a target marker, and release of the Minerva minilander. The descent went well initially, and navigation images with wide-angle cameras were obtained. However, at {{Nowrap|1:50 am}} [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] ({{Nowrap|10:50 am}} [[Japan Standard Time|JST]]) on 4 November, it was announced that due to a detection of an anomalous signal at the Go/NoGo decision, the descent, including release of Minerva and the target marker had been canceled.  The project manager, Jun-ichiro Kawaguchi, explained that the optical navigation system was not tracking the asteroid very well, probably caused by the complex shape of Itokawa.  A few days delay was required to evaluate the situation and reschedule.<ref>{{cite web|author=11:56 pm in <U+306F><U+3084><U+3076><U+3055><U+30EA><U+30F3><U+30AF>, <U+5B87><U+5B99><U+958B><U+767A> |url=http://smatsu.air-nifty.com/lbyd/2005/11/114_7a7a.html |title=<U+300C><U+306F><U+3084><U+3076><U+3055><U+30EA><U+30F3><U+30AF><U+300D><U+FF1A>11/4<U+964D><U+4E0B><U+30EA><U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30B5><U+30EB><U+4E2D><U+6B62><U+306E><U+8A18><U+8005><U+4F1A><U+898B>: <U+677E><U+6D66><U+664B><U+4E5F><U+306E>L/D |publisher=Smatsu.air-nifty.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/1108_Hayabusa_JAXA_Regrouping_for.html |title=Hayabusa: JAXA Regrouping for Touch-Down Landings on Asteroid <U+2013> Planetary News &#124; The Planetary Society |publisher=Planetary.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref>

On 7 November, Hayabusa was 7.5&nbsp;km from Itokawa. On November 9, Hayabusa performed a descent to {{Nowrap|70 m}} to test the landing navigation and the laser altimeter. After that, Hayabusa backed off to a higher position, then descended again to {{Nowrap|500 m}} and released one of the target markers into space to test the craft's ability to track it (this was confirmed). From analysis of the closeup images, the Woomera Desert site (Point B) was found to be too rocky to be suitable for landing. The Muses Sea site (Point A) was selected as the landing site, for both first and, if possible, second landings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2005/11/20051110_hayabusa_j.html |title=JAXA<U+FF5C><U+300C><U+306F><U+3084><U+3076><U+3055><U+300D><U+306E><U+30EA><U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30B5><U+30EB><U+964D><U+4E0B><U+518D><U+8A66><U+9A13><U+306B><U+3064><U+3044><U+3066> |publisher=Jaxa.jp |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref>

On 12 November, Hayabusa closed in to {{Nowrap|55 m}} from the asteroid's surface.  MINERVA was released but due to an error failed to reach the surface. On 19 November, Hayabusa landed on the asteroid. There was considerable confusion during and after the maneuver about precisely what had happened, because the high-gain antenna of the probe could not be used during final phase of touch-down, as well as the blackout during handover of ground station antenna from [[Deep Space Network|DSN]] to Usuda station.  It was initially reported that Hayabusa had stopped at approximately 10 meters from the surface, hovering for 30 minutes for unknown reasons. Ground control sent a command to abort and ascend, and by the time the communication was regained, the probe had moved 100&nbsp;km away from the asteroid.  The probe had entered into a [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]], slowly spinning to stabilize attitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planetary.org/news/2005/1121_Hayabusa_Does_Not_Land_on_Asteroid_in.html |title=Hayabusa Does Not Land on Asteroid in First Attempt, But Successfully Delivers Target Marker <U+2013> Planetary News &#124; The Planetary Society |publisher=Planetary.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=2005.11.20 in Hayabusa |url=http://5thstar.air-nifty.com/blog/2005/11/fate_of_hayabus.html |title=Fate of Hayabusa: 5thstar_<U+7BA1><U+7406><U+4EBA>_<U+65E5><U+8A18> |publisher=5thstar.air-nifty.com |date=2005-11-20 |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref> However, after regaining control and communication with the probe, the data from the landing attempt were downloaded and analyzed, and on 23 November, JAXA announced that the probe had indeed landed on the asteroid's surface.<ref>{{cite web|author=Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/snews/2005/1124_hayabusa.shtml |title=Hayabusa Landed on and Took Off from Itokawa successfully <U+2013> Detailed Analysis Revealed / Topics |publisher=ISAS |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref> Unfortunately, the sampling sequence was not triggered since a sensor detected an obstacle during descent; the probe tried to abort the landing, but since its attitude was not appropriate for ascent, it chose instead a safe descent mode. This mode did not permit a sample to be taken, but there is a high probability that some dust may have whirled up into the sampling horn when it touched the asteroid, so the sample canister currently attached to the sampling horn was sealed.  On November 25, a second touchdown attempt was performed. It was initially thought that this time, the sampling device was activated;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/2005/051126064812.zgtr2p1v.html |title=Japan probe 'almost certainly' collected first-ever asteroid samples |publisher=Spacedaily.com |date=2005-11-26 |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref> however, later analysis decided that this was probably another failure and that no pellets were fired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientistspace.com/article.ns?id=dn8868&feedId=online-news_rss20|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927215916/http://www.newscientistspace.com/article.ns?id=dn8868&feedId=online-news_rss20|archivedate=2007-09-27 |title=Space news and outer space articles from New Scientist <U+2013> New Scientist Space <U+2013> New Scientist |publisher=New Scientist Space |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref> Due to a leak in the thruster system, the probe was put in a "safe hold mode".<ref>{{cite web|author=12:24 am in <U+306F><U+3084><U+3076><U+3055><U+30EA><U+30F3><U+30AF> |url=http://smatsu.air-nifty.com/lbyd/2005/11/hayabusa_link_t_1.html |title=[HAYABUSA link&#93; The press conference at 16:00 JST 26th: <U+677E><U+6D66><U+664B><U+4E5F><U+306E>L/D |publisher=Smatsu.air-nifty.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref>

On 30 November, JAXA announced that control and communication with Hayabusa had been restored, but a problem remained with the craft's [[reaction control system]], perhaps involving a frozen pipe. Mission control was working to resolve the problem before the craft's upcoming [[launch window]] for return to Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/1130_Hayabusa_Team_ReEstablishes_Command.html |title=Hayabusa: Team Re-Establishes Command and Works to Bring its Falcon Home <U+2013> Planetary News &#124; The Planetary Society |publisher=Planetary.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref> On December 6, Hayabusa was 550&nbsp;km from Itokawa.

On 2 December, an attitude correction was tried, but the thruster did not generate enough force. On 3 December, the probe's Z-axis was found to be 20 to 30 degrees from the sun direction and increasing.   On 4 December, as an emergency measure, xenon propellant from the ion engines was blown to correct the spin, and it was confirmed successful.  Attitude control was commanded using the xenon gas. On 5 December, attitude was corrected enough to regain communication through the medium gain antenna.  Telemetry was obtained and analyzed. As the result of telemetry analysis, it was found that there was a strong possibility that the sampler projectile had not penetrated when it landed on 25 November.  Due to the power outage, the [[telemetry]] log data was faulty. On 8 December, a sudden attitude change was observed, and communication with Hayabusa was lost.  It was thought likely that the turbulence was caused by evaporation of 8 or 10[[Cubic metre#Multiples and submultiples|cc]] of leaked fuel.  This forced a wait of a month or two for Hayabusa to stabilize by conversion of [[precession]] to pure rotation, after which the rotation axis needed to be directed toward the Sun and Earth within a specific angular range.  The probability of achieving this was estimated at 60% by December 2006, 70% by spring 2007.<ref>{{cite web|author=Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/snews/2005/1214.shtml |title=Status of the Hayabusa / Topics |publisher=ISAS |date=2005-12-14 |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=10:17 pm in <U+306F><U+3084><U+3076><U+3055><U+30EA><U+30F3><U+30AF> |url=http://smatsu.air-nifty.com/lbyd/2005/12/press_conferenc.html |title=[Hayabusa link&#93;: Press Conference on 14th Dec.: <U+677E><U+6D66><U+664B><U+4E5F><U+306E>L/D |publisher=Smatsu.air-nifty.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref>

On 26 January, the probe responded to commands from ground control by changing beacon signal. On 6 February, an ejection of xenon propellant was commanded for attitude control to improve communication. The spin axis change rate was about two degrees per day. On 25 February, telemetry data was obtained through low-gain antenna. On 4 March, telemetry data was obtained through medium-gain antenna.

The reentry capsule and the spacecraft reentered to the Earth atmosphere on 13 June 2010 at 13:51 UTC.<ref>[http://indyposted.com/27014/mission-accomplished-for-japans-asteroid-explorer-hayabusa/ Mission Accomplished For Japan's Asteroid Explorer Hayabusa]</ref> The [[heat shield|heat-shielded]] capsule made a parachute landing in the South [[Outback|Australian outback]] while the spacecraft broke up and incinerated in a large fireball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/hayabusa-asteroid-probe-landing-preview-100613.html|title=Space Probe, Perhaps with a Chunk of Asteroid, Returns to Earth Sunday|publisher=[[Space.com]]|date=2010-06-13|accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref>

An international team of scientists observed the 12.2&nbsp;km/s entry of the capsule from 11.9&nbsp;km (39,000&nbsp;ft) on board NASA's DC-8 airborne laboratory, using a wide array of imaging and spectrographic cameras to measure the physical conditions during [[atmospheric reentry]] in a mission led by NASA's [[Ames Research Center]], with [[Peter Jenniskens]] of the [[SETI Institute]] as the project scientist.<ref>{{cite web | title=Hayabusa Re-Entry airborne observing campaign | url=http://airborne.seti.org/hayabusa/ | publisher=The SETI Institute | accessdate=2010-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfYA4f-AIL0&feature=player_embedded|title=NASA Team Captures Hayabusa Spacecraft Reentry|publisher=NASA|date=2010-06-14|accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref>

Since the reaction control system no longer functioned, the {{kg to lb|510}} space probe re-entered the Earth's atmosphere similar to the approach of an [[asteroid]] along with the sample re-entry capsule, and, as mission scientists expected, the majority of the spacecraft disintegrated upon entry.<ref>{{cite news

The return capsule was predicted to land in a {{Nowrap|20 km}} by {{Nowrap|200 km}} area in the [[Woomera Prohibited Area]], [[South Australia]]. Four ground teams surrounded this area and located the re-entry capsule by optical observation and a radio beacon. Then a team on board a helicopter was dispatched. They located the capsule and recorded its position with GPS. The capsule was successfully retrieved at 7:08 UTC of 14 June 2010.<ref>{{cite web | title=Retrieving the Capsule completed | url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/06/20100614_hayabusa5_e.html | publisher=JAXA | accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref> The two parts of the heat shield, which were jettisoned during the descent, were also found.<ref name="bbcnews10307048">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/science_and_environment/10307048.stm  |title=Hayabusa asteroid-sample capsule recovered in Outback |author= Jonathan Amos |publisher=BBC News  |date=2010-06-14 |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref>

After confirming that the explosive devices used for parachute deployment were safe the capsule was packed inside a double layer of plastic bags filled with pure nitrogen gas to reduce the risk of contamination.  The soil at the landing site was also sampled for reference in case of contamination.  Then the capsule was put inside a cargo container which had air suspension to keep the capsule below 1.5 G shock during transportation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrd-matsuda.co.jp/jaxa.html |title=<U+306F><U+3084><U+3076><U+3055><U+56DE><U+53CE><U+30DC><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30B9> |language=Japanese |publisher=Matsuda R&D Co. |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}</ref>  The capsule and its heat shield parts were transported to Japan by a chartered plane and arrived at the curation facility at the JAXA/ISAS Sagamihara campus on June 18.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/06/20100618_hayabusa_e.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+jaxa%2Fnew_e+%28JAXA+Web+What%27s+New%29 |title=HAYABUSA Capsule Arrived at JAXA Sagamihara Campus |publisher =JAXA |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}</ref>

Before the capsule was extracted from the protecting plastic bag, it was inspected using [[X-ray computed tomography|X-ray CT]] to determine its condition. Then the sample canister was extracted from the reentry capsule. The surface of the canister was cleaned using pure nitrogen gas and carbon dioxide; it was then placed in the canister opening device. The internal pressure of the canister was determined by a slight deformation of the canister as the pressure of the environment nitrogen gas in the clean chamber was varied. The nitrogen gas pressure was then adjusted to match the internal canister pressure to prevent the escape of any gas from the sample upon the opening of the canister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jaxa.jp/pr/jaxas/pdf/jaxas032.pdf |title=JAXA's 032 |language=Japanese |publisher=JAXA |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}</ref>

On October 7, 2010, it was announced that approximately 100 particles were collected by the sample canister, and stated that some may be cosmic materials. The particles are smaller than 0.001 millimeters. Starting in November, JAXA plans the detailed analyses of the samples by splitting each particle and examining their crystal structure at [[SPring-8]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20101007p2a00m0na010000c.html|title=Dust in Hayabusa asteroid probe capsule could be extraterrestrial|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=October 7, 2010|accessdate=November 6, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Confirmation of asteroid particles==
On 16 November 2010, JAXA confirmed that most of the particles found in one of two compartments inside the Hayabusa sample return capsule came from Itokawa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/11/20101116_hayabusa_e.html| title=Identification of origin of particles brought back by Hayabusa | publisher=JAXA |date=November 16, 2010 |accessdate=November 16, 2010}}</ref> Analysis with a scanning electron microscope identified about 1,500 grains as rocky particles, according to the JAXA press release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1011/16hayabusa/|title=Japan says Hayabusa brought back asteroid grains|author=Stephen Clark|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=17 November 2010|accessdate=17 November 2010}}</ref> After further studying the analysis results and comparison of mineral compositions, most of them were judged to be of extraterrestrial origin, and definitely from the asteroid Itokawa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/11/spacecraft-successfully-returns-.html |title=Spacecraft Successfully Returns Asteroid Dust|author=Dennis Normile|publisher=Science|date=16 November 2010|accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref>

According to Japanese scientists, the composition of Hayabusa's samples was more similar to primitive [[meteorite]]s than known rocks from Earth. Their size is mostly less than 10 micrometers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/asteroid-dust-collected-by-japan-space-probe-101116.html|title=Asteroid Dust Successfully Returned by Japanese Space Probe |author=Tariq Malik|date=2010-11-16|accessdate=2010-11-17|publisher=SPACE.com}}</ref> The material matches chemical maps of Itokawa from Hayabusa's remote sensing instruments. The researchers found concentrations of [[olivine]] and [[pyroxene]] in the Hayabusa samples. 

Further study of the samples will wait until 2011 because researchers are still developing special handling procedures to avoid contaminating the particles during the next phase of research.
