'''Bird College of Dance, Music & Theatre Performance''' is an independent [[performing arts]] college, based in [[Sidcup, Kent]], in the [[United Kingdom]].  The college provides specialist vocational training at further and higher education level in  [[dance]] and [[musical theatre]], preparing students for a career in all aspects of the perfoming industry.  

Bird College has a history of feeding artists into [[West End theatre]], dance companies and other high profile areas of the entertainments industry worldwide.<ref name='pressrelease'> {{cite web|url=http://w3.gre.ac.uk/pr/releasearchive/308.htm |title=Press release |accessdate=2007-10-08 |work=University of Greenwich }}</ref>  Key areas of study include [[Ballet]], [[Tap Dance]], [[Jazz Dance]], [[Contemporary Dance]], [[Singing]], [[Voice Craft]] and [[Drama]].  The college is accredited to the Council for Dance Education and Training, its qualifications are recognised by the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]] and results can be submitted for credit on the [[National Qualifications Framework]].  Many student places at the college are funded by the British Government through the Dance and Drama Awards (DaDA) scheme.

Since October 2007, the college has also been the official provider of junior (pre-vocational) music and dance services for the [[London Borough of Bexley]] following the closure of the Bexley Academy of Music & Performing Arts.  As a result, the previous name of Bird College of Dance & Theatre Performance was altered to reflect the change, with the addition of the word "Music".  


== History ==
===Founding and leadership ===
[[Doreen Bird]] first founded The Doreen Bird School of Dance in 1945, which was the predecessor of today's Bird College.  Bird initially taught her students in her parents' living room, where she would roll up the carpet to provide a suitable dance surface.  In [[1951]], Bird transitioned to a full time performing arts course with six students, which later became the Doreen Bird College of Performing Arts.  In 1954, the college moved to its first permanent home, Vicarage House.  Bird was principal of Bird College until 1998 when she appointed Sue Passmore as Executive and Artistic Director.  Passmore held the position until her retirement in 2005.  Since then, the college has been managed by a Board of Directors with Shirley Coen as [[Executive Director]] and Principal.  Luis de Abreu serves as [[Artistic Director]] and Vice-Principal, with Nigel Morgan also serving as Vice-Principal in the capacity of Academic Director.

=== Productions ===
Live performances are an integral part of the college curriculum and the college perform in public under the title of 'Bird Theatre Company'.  

Bird College productions have been staged at the Whitworth Theatre, the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]] and from 1982 at the [[Churchill Theatre]] in [[Bromley]], then for a number of years at the [[Peacock Theatre]].  Bird College have also performed at the [[Shaw Theatre]], [[Sadler's Wells]] and the [[Royal Opera House]] and currently perform regularly at theatres in the Kent region, particularly the Orchard Theatre in Dartford.  The College also have an active programme of providing theatre in education, working with schools and other organisations.

As one of the countries leading performing arts colleges, Bird College were invited to take part in 'Move It Dance London 2007', the largest dance exhibition in the UK.  Bird students performed in the showcase and gave demonstrations, with staff of the college teaching workshops and giving lectures.  Having an international reputation in the dance world, Bird College have also performed overseas, including appearances in Portugal, Austria and Singapore.


== Today ==
Between 130-150 students currently attend the college, which occupies four sites in Sidcup, with two dance facilities, a large multi purpose music and dance complex and one office building.  Other sites are used for a variety of classes including Bromley Valley Gymnastics Centre. The current name, Bird College, has been in use since the 1990s.  

As well as training girls, Bird College specialises particularly in the training of male dancers, with one senior member of staff lecturing and writing articles on the subject for various dance organisations including the [[Royal Academy of Dance]].  The college has numerous Patrons, Trustees and Friends, including [[Matthew Kelly]], [[Gillian Lynne]], [[Phrosso Pfister]] and [[Sian Phillips]].

=== Courses ===
As a specialist [[vocational college]] for dance and musical theatre, the college has the following accredited courses.

* BA (Hons) in Dance & Theatre Performance (validated by [[University of Greenwich]])
* National Diploma in Musical Theatre (validated by [[Trinity College, London]])
* Foundation Degree in Creative Industries: Acting (validated by University of Greenwich)
* MA by Research: Dance and Musical Theatre (validated by University of Greenwich)

=== Entry Procedure ===
Entry to one of the college's full time performing arts courses is by audition only and the college can receive up to 600 applications per year for a very limited number of places.  Due to the demanding nature of undertaking a full time dance and performing arts course, most applicants will have danced from a young age and have achieved examination passes with a recognised dance teaching organisation such as the [[Royal Academy of Dance|RAD]], [[International Dance Teachers Association|IDTA]] or [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]].  Applicants are normally expected to have achieved either an Intermediate or Advanced 1 examination pass from one of these organisations, in one of the core dance disciplines of [[Ballet]], [[Tap dance|Tap]], or [[Jazz dance|Jazz]]/[[Modern dance|Modern]].  It is not always essential for an applicant to have extensive prior experience of singing, dancing or acting however and exceptions are made if an applicant demonstrates an exceptional degree of talent or natural ability during the selection process.  

The audition for entry to the college includes assessments conducted and observed by senior teachers at the College.  The audition is intended to assess potential skills in dance, singing and drama, as well as suitability for a career in the theatre profession.   Auditions take place between January and May and auditionees will normally take part in a ballet, jazz and drama class watched by the audition panel of college staff.  They also perform individually for the panel, a solo dance, song and drama piece of their own choice, which they have prepared for the audition beforehand.  Through individual interview, personal qualities such as motivation, communication and flexibility are assessed and career aspirations are discussed before a place is offered.  As an established and reputable performing arts college, Bird College provides a number of scholarships and Government funded places and applicants who are being considered for these are sometimes asked to attend a second audition to enable the selection panel to decide who is most deserving or in need of such an award.

Like many similar institutions in the UK, Bird College has a limited student intake each year and only the most talented applicants are awarded places.  This does occasionally lead to criticism that private performing arts schools and colleges are elitist and that the training is designed only for students with the potential to work in the most high profile sectors of the performing arts.  Examples include [[Laine Theatre Arts]], [[Guildford School of Acting]], [[Central School of Speech and Drama]], [[Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts]], [[Royal College of Music|The Royal College of Music]] [[Royal Ballet School|The Royal Ballet School]], and many others, each specialising in different areas of performance arts and feeding students directly into some of the most sought after jobs in the entertainments industry.

=== Junior Music & Dance ===
In 2006, a decision was made to close the Sidcup based, Bexley Academy of Music & Performing Arts, which provided pre-vocational music and dance tuition to school children in co-ordination with Bexley Council.  The Council consequently looked for a new organisation to replace the Academy in providing music and dance in the Bexley London Borough.  

Bird College was selected, due to its international reputation in dance and theatre and its specialist experience in performing arts education. Its new services were formally launched on Monday 29 October 2007 and the college was given the use of the former Bexley Academy buildings (Bexley Music Centre) at 27 Station Road in Sidcup, the premises being owned by the local council.   As a result of these changes, the complete title of Bird college was changed to Bird College of Dance, Music & Theatre Performance.

In both music and dance, the college has re-instated services run by the Bexley Academy.  There is also an ongoing development programme to improve the services that are currently in place  Servies that have been re-instated include:
* [[Peripatetic]] music tuition in Bexley primary schools for children at [[Key Stage 2]]
* Group instrumental and vocal tuition
* Individual music tuition through Licensed Teaching
* Hire and purchase of musical instruments and accessories
* Regular public performances
* Music and dance examinations with nationally recognised bodies
* The former dance faculty is now Bird College's junior dance department
