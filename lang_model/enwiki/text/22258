"'''When You Believe'''" is an [[Academy Award]]-winning song by American recording artists [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Whitney Houston]]. The song was written and composed by [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] for the 1998 [[DreamWorks]] animated feature ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]''. A version of "When You Believe" was produced as a single with additional music by writer-producer [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds|Babyface]] for the film's [[The Prince of Egypt (OST)|soundtrack album]]. Additionally, the song was featured on Houston's fourth studio album, ''[[My Love Is Your Love]]'' and Carey's first compilation album, ''[[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|Number 1's]]''. The song was described as a big ballad, with meaningful and inspirational lyrics, describing the ability each person has to achieve miracles when they reach out to God and believe. 

The song received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. "When You Believe" experienced moderate success on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, peaking at only number fifteen on the [[Hot 100]], despite heavy media attention and live promotion. The song however, achieved strong charting throughout Europe and other worldwide regions, peaking within the top five in Belgium, France, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Due to strong single sales in Europe and the US, the song was received various certification awards throughout many major music markets. 

"When You Believe" was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] at the [[71st Academy Awards|71st annual ceremony]] on March 21, 1999. Prior to their performance of the song that night, Schwartz left Babyface's name off the nomination submission sheet. He felt that because the additions Babyface added to the song weren't featured in the actual film version, he didn't deserve writing credits. However, while Babyface did not receive the Oscar, Carey and Houston performed his version of the song, because they were more familiar with it than the one in the film. Prior to their performance at the Academy Awards, they sang it on November 26, 1998 on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]], promoting the song, as well as both their albums. 

The song featured two music videos. The first and most commonly seen video was filmed at [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] performing arts center. The video features both females, and begins with Houston and Carey performing in a large auditorium, giving the allusion of a concert. Towards the end of the video, clips of the film are projected onto a large screen at the concert, whole they belt out the final verse. The alternate video features a similar synopsis, with both singers performing on a large stage an old Egyptian pyramid. The main difference however, is the fact that no film clips are played in the video and there is no audience present.

When Carey compiled her first compilation effort ''#1's'', "When You Believe" was included in the track listing. According to Carey, the song was included because she felt it was "a miracle" that she and Houston collaborated on a record.<ref name="shapiro">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|p=114-115}}</ref> During the development of ''All That Glitters'' (a film Carey was working on at the time, later known as ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]''), she had been introduced to [[DreamWorks]] producer [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], who asked her if she would record the song "When You Believe" for the soundtrack to the animated film ''The Prince of Egypt''.<ref name=mtvbelieve/> Houston, on the other hand, was introduced to the project though [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]], with whom she had been collaborating on her album at the time, ''My Love Is Your Love''.

The song was co-written by [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] and Babyface, who also produced the song.<ref name="shapiro"/> Carey had previously collaborated with Babyface on her albums, ''Music Box'' (1993) and ''Daydream''. Babyface expressed how he went through more than one version of the song and described its production as a beautiful movie ballad, something different than he, Carey or Houston ever recorded.<ref name=vibeinterview/> In an interview with ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'', Carey said that she "liked [the song] the way it was".<ref name=vibeinterview/> She had characterised it as "a very big ballad but in an inspirational way" and denied speculation that there had been past rivalry or animosity between her and Houston prior to its recording: "I never even really talked to her until this.

While the pair continued to express their positive feelings for one another, tabloids began writing the opposite.<ref name="shapiro"/> There were claims that the two bared ill will against each other, and that they had to record the song separately due to constant tension. While media speculation grew as the film's release date drew near, both singers maintained that they had become close friends, and had only the most positive things to say about each other.<ref name="shapiro"/> Originally, Schwartz composed the film version of "When You Believe", which was sung by sang by Tzipporah ([[Sally Dworsky]]).<ref name="pond">{{harvnb|Pond|2005|p=204-205}}</ref> It featured some different instrumentation from the original, and used a children's choir as well as some lines in Hebrew. However, in order to give the song a wider radio and pop appeal, Edmonds changed some of the song's instrumentals and replaced the children's choir with a gospel one.<ref name="pond"/> His version was considered more "commercial" and would make the song "help sell the movie." Schwartz's original version was titled "When You Believe", while Edmonds' enhanced version was titled "The Prince of Egypt (When You Believe)".<ref name="pond"/>

== Lyrical content ==
"When You Believe" was featured in the film, ''The Prince of Egypt'', during the splitting of the [[Red Sea]] scene. Due to the film's connection to the bible and [[God]], the song also features a similar message.<ref name=bnetwhitney/> The protagonists of this ballad recall tough times that have them questioning their faith: they have prayed for many nights to God but those prayers seem to remain unanswered, and they wonder if they are wasting their time. Nevertheless, they realize that although times may be difficult, "there can be miracles when you believe" in God.<ref name="shapiro"/> Houston used to sing in a church choir growing up, while Carey always connected to her faith and music during difficult times.<ref name="shapiro"/> This became one of the many reasons both singers were so interested in the project, as they felt spreading faith in God was an important and honorable aspect of their career.<ref name="shapiro"/> While describing the song's lyrics and message, Houston said the following in an interview with 'Ebony'':
<Blockquote>
A powerful ballad; (songwriter) Stephen Schwartz is a genius. You have to be a child of God to understand the depth of this song. Mariah and I did it as we felt it. We both felt very connected to the song because of our background. What can I say? Just a beautiful song. What a lyric! I can't talk about it--just listen to it.<ref name=bnetwhitney/>

"When You Believe" is a slow tempo [[ballad]], which incorporates [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B]] genres.

== Music videos ==
[[Image:When you believe.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Carey and Houston featured in the song's primary music video. Primary background scenery includes a chanting crowd and Egyptian backdrops.|alt=Two woman wearing black ensembles, performing at a live concert.]] 
The single's [[music video]] was filmed at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] during the fall of 1998.<ref name="shapiro"/> The video begins with Houston entering a small arena as she begins to sing the song's first verse. As she finishes her part, Carey appears on the stage as well, performing the second bridge and chorus. The video is set in a dark studio accented by Egyptian settings, backdrops, and scenes inspired by ''The Prince of Egypt''. An audience is on hand to emulate a concert-like-setting, cheering on both singers. Occasionally, home video clips of Carey and Houston appear throughout the video, as well as clips of the final moments of the film, during the splitting of the Red Sea. The video ends as the room is illuminated, and the two singers are joined by a large choir. As they complete the song, Carey and Houston receive a standing ovation from the crowd, and exit the studio together, walking side by side as they disappear in the distance. For the video, Carey and Houston both donned similar low-cut black gowns, while Carey sported a long straight hairstyle, and Houston a pixie cut.

The song's alternate video features a similar synopsis, where Houston begins the song on a large stone altar in the middle of an auditorium. As she finishes her verse, Carey is seen walking up the ramp in the background, joining Houston for her verse. They continue the song together, standing side by side and holding hands. After completing the song, both singer exit the auditorium together as in the first video, simulating two friends enjoying time with each other.<ref name="shapiro"/> Both videos are very similar, only the alternate version does not feature an audience, choir or images, only the duo singing together atop the stone alter.<ref name="shapiro"/> In this version of the video, Houston wears a long brown strapless gown, and features a shoulder length bob haircut. Carey on the other hand, features long cascading curls and dons a olive green gown.

== Live performances ==
[[Image:WhitneyHoustonApril2010.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Houston performing live in London|alt=A woman wearing a white ensemble, performing in a live concert]]
The duo performed the song live on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] on November 26, 1998. Aside from the joint performance, Carey and Houston sang their own singles at the time, "[[I Still Believe]]" and "[[I Learned from the Best]]", respectively.<ref name=bnetwhitney/> Additionally, they sang the song live at the [[71st Academy Awards|71st Annual Academy Awards]] on March 21, 1999.<ref name="pond2">{{harvnb|Pond|2005|p=206-207}}</ref> Before the performance, they were due to rehearse together a few days before their scheduled appearance. Houston however, called in sick and had to miss the rehearsal.<ref name="pond2"/> Reportedly, her excuse was not taken well, with academy executives calling it a "bullshit story." Conti, the academy's musical arranger, found a young female singer to take Houston's place, Janis Uhley. Before the performance, Carey walked down the stage is a white top and jeans, while choreographer [[Debbie Allen]] led the background singers.<ref name="pond2"/> As they began the performance, Carey forgot the lyrics and stopped, as Uhley began singing in a "theatricality and gusto." Her boastful performance was not taken well by the directors, who called it "inappropriate and unnerving." After she was removed from the stage, a new date was chosen for the rehearsal, one that would accommodate both Carey and Houston.<ref name="pond2"/> The next night, after they began the rehearsal, both singers had trouble performing the film version of the song. After hours of practice and confusion, they reached a compromise; they would sing a mash-up of the film and single versions, which featured an additional bridge and instrumentation by Edmonds. For the awards ceremony on the twenty first, Carey and Houston wore matching white gowns, symbolizing "humbleness and simplicity."<ref name="pond3">{{harvnb|Pond|2005|p=213-214}}</ref> At 5:55 pm, Houston entered the arena, performing her verse, followed by Carey. As the song's finale drew near, a full gospel choir joined the performance from large suspending golden scaffolding, all wearing large white tunics.<ref name="pond3"/> After the original was nominated for the Academy Award, Schwartz refused to give Edmonds writing credits in nomination forms submitted to the academy.<ref name="pond"/> However, after being booked to perform at the awards show ceremony, Carey and Houston were told to perform the film version of the song, because it was the version nominated. To their dismay, both singers were not familiar with the original arrangement or key, because they had been performing the radio version throughout the winter.<ref name="pond"/> Conti composed a new version, which intermingled both version. His idea was to help the duo learn the song's new arrangement, yet still satisfy the academy.<ref name="pond"/>

"When You Believe" was recorded by ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' winner [[Leon Jackson]] in December 2007.<ref name=dspy>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/s103/the-x-factor/news/a81916/leon-set-for-no1-despite-reporting-issues.html|title=Leon set for No.1 despite "reporting issues"|last=Wilkes|first=Neil|work=''[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias]]''|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=2007-12-18|accessdate=2010-12-07}}</ref> The single was available to download from midnight after the result of the show on December 15, 2007, and a CD was rush-released mid-week, on December 19, 2007.<ref name=dspy/> This is unusual as most new singles are released on a Monday to gain maximum sales for the [[UK Singles Chart]] the following Sunday. Exceptions included the previous two ''X Factor'' winners who's were singles released in this fashion, in order for them to compete to be the [[Christmas number-one singles in the UK|Christmas number-one single]], which they all became.<ref name=dspy/> A video for the single was made by each of the final four of the series; Jackson, [[Rhydian Roberts]], [[Same Difference]] and [[Niki Evans]]. However, only the winner's version of the song and video was released. 

The song ended 2007 as the year's fourth biggest-selling single in the UK and remained number one into 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/singles2007.shtml|title=The Official UK Top 40 Singles Chart|work=''[[Royal Charter]]''|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=2010-12-05|accessdate=2010-12-07}}</ref> However, this version of the song only managed to stay in the top 40 for seven weeks, despite being the staying atop the chart for three weeks. It also soon disappeared from the top 100, and was gone by late February.<ref name=chartstats>{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/release.php?release=33342|title=Leon Jackson - When You Believe|work=''Chart Stats''|publisher=[[UK Singles Chart]]|accessdate=2010-12-07}}</ref>

===Music video===
The music video, like previous ''X Factor'' winners singles, is very simple, with Jackson singing the song in front of a large projection, with swooping shots of various landscapes behind him. It also features several clips from his time in ''The X Factor'', from his first audition to the moment he was announced the winner and performed his single to close the series. [[Simon Cowell]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Dannii Minogue]], [[Louis Walsh]], [[Dermot O'Leary]] and runner-up [[Rhydian Roberts]] all feature within the clips.

===Chart performance===
On December 23, 2007, it debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, making it the coveted Christmas number one with sales of over 275,000 copies.<ref name=dspy2>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a82212/leon-clinches-christmas-number-one-spot.html|title=Leon clinches Christmas number one spot|work=''Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias''|publisher=Digital Spy|date=2007-12-23|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> It stayed at number one for three weeks until it fell down to number five on its fourth week and then fell another ten places to number fifteen in its fifth week.<ref name=chartstats/> Additionally, It also spent three weeks at the top of the [[Irish Singles Chart]].<ref name=dspy2/>
