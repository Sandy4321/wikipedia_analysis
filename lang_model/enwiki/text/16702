==History==
===Formation and early years (2008<U+2013>2011)===
Before forming Get Scared, Nicholas Matthews, Johnny B., Bradley Lloyd, and Dan were all in separate bands. All four came together to form Get Scared and self-released their first EP, ''[[Cheap Tricks and Theatrics]]''. The only single from the EP, "If Only She Knew Voodoo Like I Do", became an internet success and received attention from [[Universal Motown Records]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://natalie-nataliesworld.blogspot.com/2011/03/get-scared-by-get-scared-interview.html |title=Get Scared By Get Scared the Interview ~ Natalie's World |publisher=Natalie-nataliesworld.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref> with a popular video as well. During the summer of 2010, the band went on [[Hot Topic]]'s ''Sacred Ceremony'' tour with [[Black Veil Brides]] and Vampires Everywhere!), helping promote the band's music. When they returned from the tour, they released the ''Get Scared EP'', their first release through Universal Motown Records.  The ''Get Scared'' EP featured the mastered remakes of the songs "Setting Yourself Up for Sarcasm" and "If She Only Knew Voodoo Like I Do" with the shortened names "Sarcasm" and "Voodoo". The band then embarked on several tours, notably the first leg of ''The Dead Masquerade Tour'' (with [[Escape the Fate]], [[Alesana]], Drive A and [[Motionless in White]]) in January - March 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/escape_the_fate_announce_the_dead_masquerade_tour/ |title=Alternative Press &#124; News &#124; Escape The Fate announce The Dead Masquerade tour |publisher=Altpress.com |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref> and an [[Aiden]] headliner including [[Eyes Set To Kill]], [[Dr. Acula (band)|Dr. Acula]], [[Vampires Everywhere!]], and [[Escape the Fate]] (only certain dates) in the spring of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nick Karp |url=http://rewritethescene.com/tour-aiden-vampires-everywhere-get-scared-dr-acula-featuring-escape-the-fate/ |title=[Tour&#93; Aiden/ Vampires Everywhere/ Get Scared/ Dr. Acula (Featuring Escape The Fate) |publisher=Rewritethescene.com |date=2011-04-04 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref> 

On July 12, 2011, they released their first full-length studio album, ''[[Best Kind of Mess]]''. The album reached #21 on the Top Heatseakers chart on the [[Billboard 200]]. The band recently departed on their first headlining tour, the ''Fuck You All'' tour, bringing along [[Dr. Acula (band)|Dr. Acula]] and [[Girl on Fire]]. The tour will run from September 6, 2011 at Albuquerque, New Mexico, to October 16, 2011 at St. Louis, Missouri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=184180851650964&set=a.119113628157687.17130.119112961491087&type=1&permPage=1 |title=Profielfoto's |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref> After spending three years with fill-in bassist Brant Thurman, it was recently announced that TJ Bell (formerly of gothic metalcore band [[Motionless in White]]) had been playing bass on the ''Fuck You All'' Tour. The band announced via webcast that Bell would eventually become a permanent member.<ref>http://www.yowie.com/show/4qt</ref>

=== Departure of Nick Matthews and onward (2011-present)===
On November 30, 2011, the band announced that Nick Matthews, the band's lead vocalist, was leaving the band.<ref>http://www.facebook.com/notes/get-scared/vocalist-nicholas-matthews-parts-ways-with-get-scared/252001148187577</ref> They stated that Matthews wanted to pursue more options in his musical career and that it was a surprise to the entire band. The band left a "note" on their [[Facebook]] page explaining the situation:

{{cquote|We regret to inform you that (Nicholas Blake Matthews) has decided, his time with Get Scared has run out. This is so hard for us to announce, However this was not a decision made against Nicholas's wishes nor was he kicked out by any means. Nicholas felt Get Scared was no longer what he wanted to pursue and has moved on musically. Once again, This is so hard for us to announce. We are all still shaken up by it, there is no preparing for a loss as great as this. Although this was a shock to the entire band, Nicholas and Get Scared absolutely have no bad blood towards one another.  Nicholas will forever be apart of the Get Scared family and we all look forward to his un doubtful success as a musician.}}

The band postponed any touring dates until further notice due to the sudden departure and lack of a lead vocalist. In the same message, they also announced that they will be holding auditions for lead vocalist, and any fan can participate.

{{cquote|At this time we do not have any announcements of a new singer. But, We will be holding auditions via video submission. We feel that we should give our fans an equal opportunity to become Get Scared's new singer as we would to a professional singer. Who better to give a chance to than the very people who gave us life, our fans}}

On December 14, the band tentatively announced that they are releasing 6 previously unreleased b-sides on iTunes, set for release on December 19. The songs will include the first songs the band wrote and recorded but were not added to the ''[[Cheap Tricks and Theatrics]]'' EP nor their debut album for unknown reasons. On December 18, a day prior to the release, the band announced the track listing for ''Cheap Tricks and Theatrics B-Sides'', and then released the EP the following day on iTunes and Amazon.
On December 21, the band has announced via Facebook and Twitter that they had chosen the new vocalist for the band, but will not be announcing it until sometime after Christmas.

The band re-entered the studio with the new lead vocalist on December 28. Although it has not been officially announced who the new vocalist is, there has been much speculation that Dear Chandelier singer Joel Faviere has replaced Nicholas Matthews, due to the tweets sent by Faviere and some of the members of Get Scared on Twitter.<ref>http://cityofpunk.tumblr.com/post/15032132628/get-scared-new-singer</ref><ref>http://www.purevolume.com/dearchandelier</ref>
