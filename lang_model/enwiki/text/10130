The '''A7He Type He Air Defense Fighter''' was the Japanese designation for a variant of the German [[Heinkel He 112]].

In the late 1930s, with its military at [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war in China]], [[Japan]] saw a need for aircraft with higher performance than then available. A number of foreign aircraft were imported and tested to discover the technology and manufacturing techniques that were used abroad.  One of the aircraft that was tested was the Heinkel He 112. Japan placed an order for 24 aircraft. Once they arrived in Japan, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] designated these aircraft as A7He Type He Air Defense Fighter.

==Design and development==

In October 1933, [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]] sent out a letter requesting aircraft companies to design a "high speed courier aircraft" - a thinly veiled request for a new fighter. In May 1934, this was made official and the Technisches Amt sent out a request for a single-seat [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] for the R<U+00FC>stungsflugzeug IV role, this time under the guise of a "sports aircraft". The specification was first sent to the three most experienced fighter designers, Heinkel, Arado, and Focke-Wulf. It was also sent to newcomer [[Messerschmitt#Reincarnation|Bayerische Flugzeugwerk]] (Bavarian Aircraft Manufacturers or BFW) on the strength of their [[Messerschmitt Bf 108 |Bf 108]] Taifun advanced sportsplane design. Each company was asked to build three [[prototype]]s for run-off testing.

=== Projeckt 1015 ===

Heinkel's design was created primarily by twin brothers [[Siegfried and Walter G<U+00FC>nter]], whose designs would dominate most of Heinkel's work. They started work on ''Projekt 1015'' in late 1933 under the guise of the original request for a courier aircraft that was based around the [[BMW 117|BMW XV]] radial engine. Work was already under way when the official request went out on 2 May. On 5 May the design was renamed [[Heinkel He 112|He 112]].

=== He 70 Blitz ===

The primary source of inspiration for the He 112 is their earlier [[Heinkel He 70|He 70 Blitz]] ("Lightning") design. The Blitz was a single-engine, four-passenger aircraft  inspired by the famous [[Lockheed Model 9 Orion]] [[mail plane]].  The Blitz was originally designed for use by [[Deutsche Luft Hansa|Deutsche Lufthansa]], but it was pressed into military service and was used as a two-seat [[bomber]] (although mostly for reconnaissance) and served in this role in Spain.

The Blitz introduced a number of new construction techniques to the Heinkel company; it was their first low-wing [[monoplane]], their first with [[retractable landing gear]], their first all-metal [[Monocoque#Aircraft|monocoque]] design, and its [[elliptical]], reverse-[[gull wing]] [[planform]] all of which would be seen on a number of later projects. The Blitz could almost meet the new fighter requirements itself, so it is not surprising that the G<U+00FC>nters would choose to work with the existing design as much as possible.

=== He 112 Prototypes ===

The He 112 prototypes were named He 112V1 through V4. He 112V1 (D-IADO) was powered with a 695 hp Rolls-Royce Kestrel V engine, and was completed in the summer of 1935. Prototype V2 (D-?) had its wingspan reduced from 41 ft 4 in to 37 ft 8 3/4 in, which became the standard wingspan for all future airframes. Prototypes V2 and V3 (D-IDMO) received a 620 hp [[Junkers Jumo 210|Jumo 210C]] inverted V12 engine mounting a two-blade propeller and were armed with two 7.9 mm MG 17 machine guns. V4 (D-IZMY) mounted a 690 hp [[Junkers Jumo 210|Junkers Jumo 210Da]] inverted V12 engine and mounted three MG 17s, becoming the production prototype for the proposed He 112A.


In many ways, the resulting He 112 design was a scaled-down He 70. Like the He 70, the He 112 was constructed entirely of metal, using a two-spar wing and a monocoque fuselage with [[Rivet#Flush_rivet|flush-head rivets]]. The landing gear retracted outward from the low point of the wing's gull-bend, which resulted in a fairly wide 9 m (30 ft) track, giving the aircraft excellent ground handling. Its only features from an older era were its open [[cockpit]] and fuselage spine behind the headrest, which provided excellent vision and made the biplane-trained pilots feel more comfortable.

By spring 1935, both the [[Arado Flugzeugwerke|Arado]] and [[Focke-Wulf]] aircraft were ready for run-off testing, the BFW arriving in March, and the He 112 in April. Testing continued until October, at which point some of the additional A-0 series aircraft had arrived.

At the end of September, there were four He 112s undergoing test, yet none was a match for the Bf 109. From October on, the Bf 109 appears to have been selected as the winner of the contest. Although no clear date is given, in ''Stormy Life'' [[Ernst Udet]] himself delivered the news to Heinkel that the Bf 109 had entered series production in 1936. He is quoted as saying, "Pawn your crate off on the Turks or the Japs or the Rumanians. They'll lap it up." With a number of air forces looking to upgrade from biplanes and various designs from the early 1930s, the possibility for foreign sales was promising.

===He 112A===

====Prototypes====

The remaining prototypes (V5 through V12) received bubble canopies with lowered upper fuselage spines.

Prototypes V5 (D-?), V6 (D-ISJY), and V7 (D-IKIK) were powered by the 690 hp [[Junkers Jumo 210|Junkers Jumo 210Da]] inverted V12 engine and were prototypes for the He 112A. The last of the prototype He 112A-0 series was V8 (D-IXRO), which was completed in October. It mounted the Daimler-Benz DB 600Aa inverted V12 engine, along with a three-blade, fully adjustable, all-metal propeller. The engine was a huge change for the aircraft, producing 716 kW (960 hp) for takeoff and had 33.9 L (2,069 in<U+00B3>) displacement weighing 686 kg (1,510 lb), compared to the [[Junkers Jumo 210|Junkers Jumo 210Da's]] 514 kW (690 hp) from 19.7 L (1,202 in<U+00B3>) at about the same weight.<ref name="GreenP119">Green, p. 119</ref>

Prototype V8 was seen primarily as a testbed for the new engine, and more importantly, its cooling systems. The DB engine used a dry type cylinder liner that resulted in poor heat flow, so more of the heat was removed by oil as opposed to water, this in turn required changes to the cooling systems.

====He 112A Production models====

At this point, the prototype stage was winding down. Heinkel continued building the A-0 as production line models. The model naming scheme changed by adding a production number to the end of the model name, so the next six examples were known as He 112A-01 through A-06. All of these included the Jumo 210C engine and were essentially identical to V6, with the exception of the radiator.

These aircraft were used in a varied a manner as were the earlier V series aircraft. A-01 flew in October 1936 and was used as the prototype for a future 112C-0 [[carrier-based aircraft]].  A-02 flew in November, and then joined the earlier V models at [[Rechlin-L<U+00E4>rz Airfield]] for further testing in the contest. A-03 and A-04 were both completed in December, A-03 was a show aircraft and was flown by Heinkel pilots at various air shows and exhibitions, A-04 was kept at Heinkel for various tests.

The last two models of the He 112A-0 series, A-05 and A-06, were completed in March 1937. They were  shipped to Japan as the initial aircraft of the 30 ordered by the Imperial Japanese Navy. Like all of the other He 112As, they had Jumo 210C engine and open cockpits.<ref name="GreenP119" />

===He 112B===

====Prototypes====

The next prototype airframe, V9 (D-IJSI), first flown in July 1937, was powered by the 507 kW (680 hp) [[Junkers Jumo 210| Jumo 210Ea]] inverted V12 engine. V9 can be considered to be the "real" B series prototype. The entire surface was now flush riveted and the aircraft had several other aerodynamic cleanups, including a [[bubble canopy]]. The radiator was again changed, this time to a semi-retractable design for reduced drag in flight. The aircraft also underwent a weight reduction program which reduced the empty weight to 1,617 kg (3,565 lb).<ref name="GreenP119" />

As a result of all of these changes, the V9 had a maximum speed of 485 km/h (301 mph) at 4,000 m (13,120 ft), and 430 km/h (270 mph) at sea level. This was a full 20 km/h (10 mph) faster than the contemporary [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109B]]. Nevertheless, by this time, the Bf 109 was already ramping up production, and the [[Ministry of Aviation (Germany)|RLM]] saw no need for another largely similar aircraft. It is also worth noting that users of the aircraft generally found it impossible to reach this speed, and rarely managed to exceed 418 km/h (260 mph).

In order to show off the He 112, prototype V9 spent much of the later half of 1937 being flown by pilots from all over the world. It was also sent around Europe for tours and air shows. The effort was a success and orders quickly started coming in. However, a variety of problems meant few of these were ever delivered.

====Production models====

The first production order was from the Imperial Japanese Navy, who had a requirement for a fast climbing interceptor to deal with [[Tupolev SB]] bombers over China. After seeing V9 in flight, they quickly placed an order for 24 112Bs, with an option for 48 more.<ref name="GreenP119" /> The first four were shipped in December 1937, another eight in the spring of 1938, and promises for the rest to arrive in May.  A 13th aircraft, He 112-V12 (D-IYWE) with its DB 600Aa engine, was also purchased by Japan.<ref name="GreenP121">Green, p. 121</ref>

Before the last 12 could be delivered to Japan, the Luftwaffe unexpectedly confiscated them to bolster its forces during the Sudetenland Crisis. The aircraft were returned to Heinkel in November, but the Japanese were unhappy with the high maintenance workload and lower maneuverability of the He 112 when compared to fighters like the Mitsubishi A5M, refusing to accept them this late, leaving Heinkel holding the aircraft.

Although the Japanese rejected the He 112 as a fighter. Those that did arrive in Japan were assigned to mechanic training duties at Tsuchiura Naval Station.<ref name="GreenP120">Green, p. 120</ref>
