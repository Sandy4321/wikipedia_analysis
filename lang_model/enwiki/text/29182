==Life==
Shi was born in [[Liuhe County]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] on March 5, 1971. He was a resident of Tonggou village (<U+901A><U+6C9F><U+6751>) in [[Liunan Township]] and worked as a butcher.<ref name=sina2906>[http://news.sina.com.cn/c/l/2006-09-29/090511134545.shtml <U+516C><U+5B89><U+90E8><U+53D1>A<U+7EA7><U+901A><U+7F09><U+4EE4><U+7F09><U+62FF><U+8FDE><U+6740>7<U+4EBA><U+7591><U+72AF>(<U+56FE>)], ''[[Sina.com]]'' (September 29, 2006)</ref> His wife described him as an introverted person, who was unwilling to interact with other people, and was prone to brooding after conflicts with others.

Two months prior to the murders he visited a psychiatrist in [[Tonghua]], which improved his mood, and he and his wife afterwards made trips to [[Shanghai]], [[Suzhou]], and [[Hangzhou]].<ref name=Sina3009>[http://news.sina.com.cn/c/l/2006-09-30/014911140302.shtml A<U+7EA7><U+901A><U+7F09><U+72AF><U+77F3><U+60A6><U+519B><U+59BB><U+5B50><U+79F0><U+5176><U+66FE><U+770B><U+5FC3><U+7406><U+533B><U+751F>], ''[[Sina.com]]'' (September 30, 2006)</ref>

==Murders==
In the morning of September 24, 2006 Shi drove to Ermi in [[Tonghua County]] where he killed Li Zhenjun in his home, as well as Wang Yuliang, a health inspector who had once punished him. He also killed Wang's wife and parents, and wounded Wang Yuhong, one of his relatives, with a stab in the abdomen, when he tried to intervene and attacked Shi with a shovel. Shi then drove to Liunan Township in Liuhe County where he killed shop owner Liu Guohua, who had refused to sell his meat and also wounded the latter's wife, as well as a man named Wang Gangyin (<U+738B><U+521A><U+56E0>), who had paid him low wages. He then proceeded to Sanyuanpu where he killed shop owner and slaughterhouse supervisor Yu Hongyong, who had also punished him, wounded Yu's wife, and then fled.

Shi was soon identified by police as the culprit, roadblocks were set up in the area and a reward of 100,000 Yuan was offered by Tonghua police for clues about the murderer's whereabout. On September 27 Shi murdered Sun Honglian and his wife, who were living secluded on a mountain near Tonggou and escaped again, while 2000 police officers rushed to the crime scene. On September 28 the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] issued a Class-A warrant and offered a reward of 50,000 yuan for information that would lead to his arrest.<ref name=sina2906/>

Being hunted by 2000 police officers and 12,000 other people, including milita, armed police and local residents, Shi killed three villagers, and wounded another in Lujiabao (<U+5415><U+5BB6><U+5821><U+6751>) near Liunan Township in the morning of September 29 and was eventually captured around noon the same day in a cornfield nearby. He was then brought to [[Changchun]] where he confessed to the murders.<ref name=Sina3009/><ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-09/30/content_700038.htm Police catch 'Jilin butcher'], ''[[China Daily]]'' (September 30, 2006)</ref><ref>[http://news.sina.com.cn/c/l/2006-09-29/194711139511.shtml <U+8FDE><U+6740>12<U+4EBA><U+7684><U+516C><U+5B89><U+90E8>A<U+7EA7><U+901A><U+7F09><U+72AF><U+77F3><U+60A6><U+519B><U+88AB><U+6293><U+83B7>], ''[[Sina.com]]'' (September 29, 2006)</ref>
