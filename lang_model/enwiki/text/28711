[[Image:Gita1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Krishna]] to Arjuna: ''Behold My mystic opulence!'']] 
'''Arjuna''' ([[Sanskrit]]: <U+0905><U+0930><U+094D><U+091C><U+0941><U+0928>, ''arjuna'') is one of the heroes of the [[Hindu]] epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''. His name means 'bright', 'shining', or 'silver'. The third of the five [[Pandava]] brothers, Arjuna was one of the children borne by [[Kunti]], first wife of [[Pandu]]. 
== About Arjuna ==


Arjuna was a master archer and played a central role in the conflict between the Pandavas and their adversaries, the sons of [[Dhritarashtra]] known as the [[Kaurava]]s. To begin with, Arjuna was reluctant to take part in battle because of the slaughter he knew he would cause in the enemy ranks, which included many of his own relatives. He was persuaded by his charioteer and close friend Lord [[Krishna]], to change his mind. Their dialogue about issues involved in war<U+2014>courage, a warrior<U+2019>s duty, the nature of human life and the soul, and the role of Gods<U+2014>forms the subject of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], one of the key episodes in the epic Mahabharata. He also played the key role in killing [[Karna]], his arch-rival, in reality an unknown brother, on the side of the Kauravas.

It is asserted by some sources that the legend of "[[Arash (mythology)|<U+0100>rash]], the [[Parthia]]n Archer" in [[Persian mythology]] bears some resemblance to that of Arjuna; this is cited by some as being reminiscent of a shared [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] heritage. However, Arjun is an integral part of the Mahabharata and one of its lead characters. The other central characters in the story are not mentioned in the story of Arash. Lastly, Indian scientists have discovered what they claim to be Dwaraka, or [[Krishna]]'s city, indicating that the Mahabharata may indeed have a link to actual events in Indian history, as opposed to being a mythological tale.

==Birth==
Pandu was unable to sire a child. His first wife, [[Kunti]], had in her maiden days received a boon from [[Rishi|sage]] [[Durvasa]], which enabled her to invoke any deity of her choice and beget a child by such deity. [[Pandu]] and [[Kunti]] decided to make use of this boon; [[Kunti]] invoked in turn [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama Dharmaraja]], [[Vayu]] and [[Indra]] and gave birth to three sons. Arjuna was the third son, born of [[Indra]], king of the demi gods [[devas]]

==Personality==
Arjuna is depicted as a wholesome and well-rounded personality, a healthy mind in a healthy body, a person whom any mother, wife and friend would cherish and be proud of. The son of [[Indra]], Arjuna is said to have been well-built and extremely handsome; something of a ladies' man, he married four times, as detailed [[Arjuna#Marital engagements|here]]. Arjuna was also true and loyal to his friends(his best friend was the great warrior [[Satyaki]]); he enjoyed a life-long rapport with his cousin and brother-in-law, Sri [[Krishna]]. He was also sensitive and thoughtful, as demonstrated by his misgivings about the [[Kurukshetra war]], which caused Sri [[Krishna]] to impart the [[Gita]] to him. His sense of duty was acute; he once chose to go into exile rather than refuse to help a [[brahmin]] subject, a story detailed elsewhere. 

===The Diligent Student===
It is as a warrior that Arjuna is best known. The foundation for his career as a warrior was laid young; Arjuna was an outstanding and diligent student, learning everything that his guru Dronacharya could teach him, and early attaining the status of "Atirathi" or outstanding warrior. A story regarding his concentration at study is known to every Indian schoolboy. Guru Dronacharya once decided to test his students. He hung a wooden bird from the branch of a tree and then summoned his students. One by one, he asked his students to aim for the eye of the wooden bird and be ready to shoot; then, when they were ready, he would ask the student to describe all that he was able to see. The students generally described the garden, the tree, flowers, the branch from which the bird was suspended and the bird itself. Guru Dronacharya then asked them to step aside. When it was the turn of Arjuna, he told his Guru that he could only see the bird's eye. This is a classic example of Arjuna's concentration.

===Draupadi===
His skill in archery was to have an unlikely utility: it won him the hand of Draupadi, his first wife, the daughter of Drupada, king of Panchala. A contest was held by Drupada to choose a suitable match for his daughter. A wooden fish was suspended high above a pool of water; furthermore, the fish rotated in a circle. Contestants were required to string a heavy bow and then use it to hit the eye of the rotating fish. They were allowed to take aim at the eye of the fish only by looking at its reflection in the pool of water. Many princes and noblemen vied for the hand of the princess of Panchala. Some, (including [[Karna]], another hero of the ''Mahabharata'') were disqualified on grounds of supposedly low birth. However, although the [[Pandava]]s and their mother were in hiding at that time, Arjuna had prudently dressed as a high-caste [[Brahmin]] and was allowed to compete. This was just as well, since it was eventually Arjuna, the peerless archer, who alone was able to accomplish the set task; he won the hand of Draupadi.

All the five [[Pandava]] brothers had attended the tournament without informing [[Kunti]], their mother, about it. They returned home in triumph, bringing the princess Draupadi with them. From outside the house, they shouted out to their mother: "Mother, you will never believe what we have got here! Make a guess!". Busy with her work, [[Kunti]] refused to be baited. "Whatever it is, share it between yourselves equally, and do not quarrel over the matter" she said. So seriously did the brothers take even this casual statement of their mother, that they resolved upon making Draupadi their common wife! It says something about the [[magnanimity]] of Arjuna that, having won his bride single-handedly, he 'shared' her with all his brothers willingly. One possible reason he took this action was to prevent any breach or jealousy arising between the brothers.

===Adherence to his Duty===
The brothers agreed upon a protocol governing their relatons with Draupadi, their common wife. An important point of this agreement was that no brother would disturb the couple when another brother was alone with Draupadi; the penalty for doing so was exile for a year. Once, when the [[Pandavas]] were still ruling over a prosperous Indraprastha, a [[brahmin]] came in great agitation to Arjuna and sought his help: a pack of cattle-thieves had seized his herd, he had recourse to none but Arjuna for a remedy. Arjuna was in a dilemma: his weaponry was in the room where [[Draupadi]] and [[Yudhishthira]] were alone together for the night, and disturbing them would incur the penalty agreed upon. Arjuna hesitated for but a moment; in his mind, coming to the aid of his subject in distress, especially a [[brahmin]], was the ''raison d'etre'' of a prince. The prospect of exile did not deter him from fulfilling the duty of aiding the [[brahmin]]; he disturbed the conjugal couple, took up his weaponry and rode forth to subdue the cattle-thieves. Upon finishing that task, he insisted, in the teeth of opposition from his entire family, including the two people whom he had disturbed, upon going away on exile.

===Marital engagements===
Apart from [[Draupadi]], Arjuna was the husband of three other ladies, namely '''[[Chitrangada]]''', '''[[Ulupi]]''' and '''[[Subhadra]]'''. All of these events occurred during the period when he went into exile alone after having disturbed [[Draupadi]] and [[Yudhishthira]] in their private apartments.

'''Chitrangada''': Arjuna travelled the length and breadth of [[India]] during his term of exile. His wanderings took him to ancient [[Manipur]] in the eastern [[Himalaya]]s, an almost mystic kingdom renowned for its natural beauty. Here he met the gentle Chitrangada, daughter of the king of Manipur, and was moved to seek her hand in marriage. Her father the king demurred on the plea that, according to the matrilineal customs of his people, the children born of Chitrangada were heir to [[Manipur]]; he could not allow his heirs to be taken away from Manipur by their father. Arjuna agreed to the stipulation that he would take away neither his wife Chitrangada nor any children borne by her from Manipur, and wed the princess on this premise. A son, whom they named [[Babruvahana]], was soon born to the happy couple--he would succeed his grandfather as King of [[Manipur]].

'''Ulupi''': While Arjuna was in [[Manipur]], Ulupi, a Naga princess of otherwise noble character, became infatuated of him. She caused him to be abducted after he had been intoxicated with potent concoctions; she had him conveyed to her realm in the netherworld. Here, Ulupi induced an unwilling Arjuna to take her for wife. Later, the large-hearted Ulupi restored Arjuna to the lamenting Chitrangada. Ulupi later did much to further the comfort and happiness not only of Arjuna, but also of Chitrangada and the young [[Babruvahana]]. She played a very major part in the upbringing of Babruvahana; she enjoyed much influence over him, and was eventually also to restore Arjuna to life after he was slain in battle by Babruvahana.

'''Subhadra''': Arjuna decided to spend the last portion of his term of exile at [[Dwaraka]], the residence of his cousins [[Balarama]], [[Krishna]] and [[Subhadra]], who were the children of his maternal uncle [[Vasudeva]]. Here, he and his cousin [[Subhadra]] fell in love with each other. This matter was abetted by   [[Krishna]], who had always been particularly attached to Arjuna, and wished nothing but the best for his sister [[Subhadra]]. Knowing that the entire family would view with disfavour the prospect of [[Subhadra]] becoming the fourth wife of her cousin Arjuna,   [[Krishna]] facilitated the elopement of the couple and their departure for Indraprastha. In a twist to the tale, at   [[Krishna]]'s advice, it was [[Subhadra]] who drove the chariot from [[Dwaraka]] to Indraprastha.   [[Krishna]] used this fact to persuade his family that [[Subhadra]] had not been abducted; on the contrary, it was she who had kidnapped Arjuna!!

A single son, [[Abhimanyu]], was born to Arjuna and [[Subhadra]]. [[Parikshita]], (son of [[Abhimanyu]] and [[Uttar<U+0101>]],born after Abhimanyu was killed in the battlefield], was destined to be the sole surviving dynast of the entire Kuru clan, and succeeded Yudhistra as the emperor of Pandava kingdom.

===Gandiva===
Shortly after his return to Indraprastha, Arjuna visits the Khandava forest with Krishna. There they encounter ''Agni'', the fire-god, who asks their help in consuming the forest in its entirety - Takshaka the serpent-king, a friend of Indra, resides in it and Indra thus causes rain whenever Agni tries to burn this forest. It is further revealed that the fire-god must do this to relieve a sickness he suffers from, hence the importance of destroying the forest. Arjuna tells him that while he has training in the divine weapons, he must have an exceptionally powerful bow to withstand the power of Indra's astras; an unbreakable one. Agni then invokes ''Varuna'', who gives Arjuna the Gandiva, an incredibly powerful bow, which gave its user sure victory in battle. This bow plays a great role in Arjuna's battles to come. Additionally, he also gives Arjuna a divine chariot, with powerful white horses that do not tire, and are unwounded by normal weapons.

Arjuna tells Agni to proceed, and fights a duel with his father in the process, a battle that lasts several days and nights. A voice from the sky proclaims Arjuna and Krishna the victors, and tells Indra to withdraw. 

===Mayasabha===
In the burning of the forest, Arjuna chose to spare one Asura, named Maya, who was a gifted architect. In his gratitude, Maya built ''Yudhishtra'' a magnificent royal hall, unparalleled in the world. It is this hall, which triggers the pinnacle of ''Duryodhana's'' envy, causing the game of dice to be played.

==In Exile==
After Arjuna's return to Indraprastha, several crucial incidents described in the [[Mahabharata]] took place, culminating in the exile of all the five [[Pandava]] brothers and of their common wife [[Draupadi]]. Arjuna's training during this period is particularly significant in the War to come.

'''Pashupata''': During the fifth year of their exile, Arjuna leaves the others and proceeds to the Himalayas to do tapas to Lord [[Shiva]], to obtain the Pasupata, Shiva's personal astra (i.e. "weapon"), one so powerful as to lack any counter-astra. Arjuna performs penance for a long time. Shiva, pleased with his penance, appears before him as a rude hunter who challenges Arjuna. The two fight an intense duel. Arjuna realizes the hunter's identity as the dual progresses, and falls at Shiva's feet. Shiva subsequently grants him knowledge of the Pasupata.

After obtaining this astra, he then proceeds to Indraloka (heaven) spending time with his biological father, and acquiring further training from the devas. Additionally, he destroys the Nivatakavachas and Kalakeyas - two powerful asura clans that resided in the skies, and menaced the gods. The clans had obtained boons from Brahma as to be undefeatable by gods. Arjuna being a mortal man, he could thus destroy them with his training. 

'''Urvashi's curse''': While in Indraloka, Arjuna was propositioned by the ''apsara'' (nymph) [[Urvashi]]. Urvashi had once been married to a king named Pururavas, and had borne a son named Ayus from that liaison; Ayus was a distant forbear of Arjuna, hence he regarded Urvashi as a mother. Arjuna reminded Urvashi of this connection while rejecting her advances. Another belief says that since Indra was Arjuna's father and Urvashi was a nymph in Indra's court, so Urvashi is more like a motherly figure for him. Urvashi got annoyed at this rejection, saying a nymph is not a sister or mother to anyone. Urvashi rebuked Arjuna and told him that a nymph is not concerned with earthly relations of any sort. Yet Arjuna could not overcome his scruples; "I am a child in front of you" he said. Chagrined at this response, [[Urvashi]] cursed Arjuna with impotence. Because Indra told her to reduce the curse, she modified her curse to last only one year, and Arjuna could choose any one year of his life during which to suffer the life of a eunuch. This curse proved fortuitous; Arjuna used it as a very effective disguise for the period of one year when he, his brothers and Draupadi all lived ''incognito'' while in exile.

After spending 12 years in the forest, the [[Pandavas]] spent the thirteenth year of exile ''''incognito'''', as stipulated by their agreement with the [[Kauravas]]. This year is spent by them in disguise at the court of King Vir<U+0101>ta. Arjuna made use of the curse put on him by the apsara Urvashi and chose this year in which to live the life of a eunuch. He assumed the name [[Brihannala]]. At the end of one year, Arjuna single-handedly defeated a [[Kaurava]] host that had invaded Vir<U+0101>ta's kingdom. In appreciation of this valour, and being appraised of the true identity of the [[Pandava]]s, King Vir<U+0101>ta offered the hand of his daughter Uttar<U+0101> to Arjuna. Arjuna demurred on grounds of age as well as that Uttar<U+0101> was like a daughter to him, owing to his having been (as a eunuch) her tutor in song and dance. He proposed that Uttar<U+0101> should marry his young son [[Abhimanyu]]. This wedding duly took place; the posthumous son born of that union was destined to be the sole surviving dynast of the entire Kuru clan.

==Arjuna and Hanuman==
In addition to the guidance of and personal attention from [[Krishna]], Arjuna had the support of [[Hanuman]] during the great battle of [[Kurukshetra]].

Arjuna entered the battlefield with the flag of [[Hanuman]] on his chariot. The incident that led to this was an earlier ecounter between Hanuman and Arjuna; Hanuman appeared as a small talking monkey before Arjuna at [[Rameshwaram]], where [[Sri]] [[Rama]] had built the great bridge to cross over to [[Lanka]] to rescue [[Sita]]. Upon Arjuna's wondering out aloud at Sri Rama's taking the help of "monkeys" rather than building a bridge of arrows, Hanuman (in the form of the little monkey) challenged him to build one capable of bearing him alone. Unaware of the monkey's true identity, Arjuna accepted the challenge. [[Hanuman]] then proceeded to repeatedly destroy the bridges made by Arjuna who became depressed and suicidal, and decided to take his own life. [[Vishnu]] then appeared before them both, chiding Arjuna for his vanity, and Hanuman for making the accomplished warrior Arjuna feel incompetent. As an act of 'penitence', Hanuman agreed to help Arjuna by stabilising and strengthening his chariot during the then-likely great battle.

==Outbreak of war==
Upon finishing the period of their exile, the [[Pandavas]] seek the return of their kingdom from the [[Kauravas]], who refuse to honour the terms of the agreement. War breaks out. 

===The [[Bhagavad Gita]]===
Krishna's elder step brother [[Balarama]], ruler of Dwaraka, decides not to take sides in the war, as both [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]] are kinsmen of the Yadavas. However, [[Krishna]] in his personal capacity decides to be near Arjuna and protect him. [[Krishna]] becomes Arjuna's personal charioteer during the 18-day war and protects Arjuna upon numerous occasions from injury and death. It may be mentioned that the term "Charioteer" in connection to Krishna is interpreted as "One who guides" or "One who shows the way"; apart from protecting Arjuna from all mishap, Krishna also showed Arjuna the righteous way by revealing the [[Bhagavad Gita]] to him in the hours immediately preceding the start of battle.

This happened thus: As the two armies fell into battle-formation and faced each other on the battlefield, Arjuna's heart grew heavy. He saw arrayed before him his own kinsfolk; the elders of his clan on whose knees he had once been dandled as a child; the very guru [[Dronacharya]] who first taught him to wield the bow all those decades ago. Will it be worthwhile, he asked himself, to annihilate his own kindren for the sake of a kingdom? Arjuna sees his spirit faltering at this crucial juncture just as the war is about to begin; he resorts to [[Krishna]] for guidance. 

It is at this juncture that Lord [[Krishna]] reveals the [[Bhagavad Gita]] to Arjuna. It is beyond the scope of this page to detail the wisdom contained in one of the most revered of Hindu scriptures; it will suffice for our purposes to note that the Lord deems it Arjuna's duty to struggle to uphold righteousness, without consideration of personal loss, consequence or reward; the discharge of one's moral duty, he says, supersedes all other pursuits, whether spiritual and material, in life. 

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] is a record of the conversation between Lord [[Krishna]] and Arjuna. The relationship between Arjuna and [[Krishna]] is representative of what is ideal for all mankind: Man guided by God. The [[Bhagavad Gita]] records the Lord comforting and guiding a mortal who is facing a terrible moral crisis, and is an important scripture in [[Hinduism]].

==The [[Kurukshetra war]]==
Thus fortified in his belief of the righteousness of his chosen course of action, Arjuna takes up arms and essays a vastly important role in the winning of the war by the [[Pandava]]s.

===The slaying of Karna===
Arjuna killed his uterine brother [[Karna]], another formidable warrior who was fighting in aid of the [[Kauravas]] against the [[Pandavas]]. This act of fratricide was committed by him while in ignorance of the relationship. Karna and Arjuna form a terrible rivalry when Karna seeks to revenge himself upon Arjuna's guru and the princely order for casting him out and humiliating him. Arjuna is further provoked when Karna insults Arjuna and the other Pandava's wife Draupadi and has an indirect role in the murder of Arjuna's son Abhimanyu in battle. They both bring this terrible and personal rivalry to a climactic battle of terrifying proportions. For a long, long time, powerful weapons are discharged by the two warriors at terrifying pace without relent. The prowess and courage of both is marvelled by the millions of other soldiers. Karna, knowing that his support for evil is his own doom, nevertheless mounts his best-ever attack and puts together all his power, force and knowledge into two volleys - one meant to dazzle Arjuna, and the immediate second meant to capitalize and kill his personal enemy. But the Lord Krishna saves his friend and devotee Arjuna at this crucial juncture, and though it may be said that Karna attained a superiority in skill to Arjuna, his sins too bear fruit. Arjuna is urged by Lord Krishna to kill Karna when he is attempting to raise his chariot, reminding him of Karna's own apparent lack of mercy and regard for the rules of war in the killing of Arjuna's son Abhimanyu in a terrible and brutal fashion. Arjuna thus kills Karna. In the end, it is not Arjuna's skill but Karna's sins which doom him, marking another instance in the Mahabharata of how an individual's actions serve to mark his destiny, and the need to lead a virtuous life.

===The slaying of Jayadratha=== 
In another memorable battle, it was Arjuna who annhilated a whole [[akshouhini]], or hundreds of thousands (109,350) of Kaurava soldiers in one day to avenge the terrible murder of his son [[Abhimanyu]], who was killed by all of the strongest warriors of the Kaurava Army, attacking simultaneously and especially when Abhimanyu was exhausted and deprived of weapons and trapped in a formation impossible for anyone save the Kuru general Drona, Arjuna, Krishna and Krishna's son Pradyumna to escape from. Having pledged to enter the fire if he failed to kill the [[Sindhu]] king [[Jayadratha]], whom he held principally responsible, by the end of the day, Arjuna in the process kills an entire akshauhini, or more than hundreds of thousands of soldiers. In the climactic moment, the sun is close to setting and thousands of warriors still separate Arjuna and Jayadratha. Seeing his friend's plight, the Lord Krishna, his charioteer, raises his [[Sudarshana Chakra]] to cover the Sun, faking a sunset. The Kaurava warriors rejoice over Arjuna's defeat and imminent death, and Jayadratha is exposed in a crucial moment, where upon the Lord's urging, Arjuna sets loose a powerful arrow that decapitates Jayadratha. This note of the act of protection of Krishna of his righteous friend and disciple will be incomplete without adding that Jayadratha's father, the old and sinful king Vridhakshtra had blessed his son that anyone who caused his head to fall to the ground would cause his own head to burst. Jayadratha's head is carried by the arrow to his own father's hands, who was meditating near the battlefield; who in his shock drops the head and himself dies of his own blessing.

==After the War==
After the conclusion of the war, the [[Pandava]]s take charge of Hastinapura, the undivided realm of their ancestors. Their great victory, the wide support they gained for their cause and the defeat of the many kings who had supported the Kauravas, all unite to make them feel that the time is right to hazard a further venture: the performance of the ''Asvamedha Yagna'', or "horse sacrifice", whereafter the title of ''Chakravarti'' ("Emperor") may be assumed. The sacrifice required that after preliminary rituals, a horse is let loose to wander where it will. The kings upon whose lands the horse wanders all have a choice: they may either accept the master of the horse (in this case, Yudishthira, eldest of the Pandavas) as their own leige lord and offer their submission to him, or they may offer resistance and wage war. Arjuna led the armed host which followed the horse around its random wanderings. He had occasion to receive the submission of many kings, either without or following an armed confrontation. He was thus instrumental in the expansion of the Pandava domains. 

In course of time, the [[Pandava]] brothers decide, at an advanced age, to renounce the world. They entrust the kingdom to [[Parikshita]], the son of [[Abhimanyu]] and grandson of Arjuna. The [[Pandavas]], including Arjuna, then retire to the [[Himalayas]] and eventually depart the world.

==Other Names of Arjuna==
* [[Partha]] (''son of Pritha'', another name for [[Kunti]]).
* Jishnu (''the Irrepressible'')
* Kiriti (''Shining Diadem'', which was gifted by [[Indra]])
* Shwethavahana (''one of Shining Steeds'')
* Bheebhatsu (''the Fair Fighter'')

==Kannapa: Reincarnation of Arjuna?==
According to Swami [[Sivananda]]'s book, "Sixty-Three Nayanar Saints" (pg. 44) some Saivite traditions believe that [[Kannappa]] was the reincarnation of Arjuna. According to [[Purana|puranic]] legend, Arjuna meditated upon [[Siva]], seeking as boon the ''Pasupatha Astra,'' but failed to recognize Him when Siva manifested himself in the form of a hunter. Thus, according to this tradition, Arjuna had to be born as a hunter and adore the Lord before attaining final liberation.
