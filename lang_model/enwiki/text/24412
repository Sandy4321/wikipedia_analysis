[[Nellie Bertram]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) tells [[Pam Halpert]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) that [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) may be having an affair; meanwhile, Jim reveals his entrepreneurial plans to [[Darryl Philbin]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) in the warehouse.

"Andy's Ancestry" received moderately positive reviews from television critics. Many felt that the emotional elements in the episode were effective and that the cold opening was particularly humorous. Many noted that the episode bore stylistic similarities to early episodes of the show. Some, however, were slightly disappointed by the episode's various subplots. "Andy's Ancestry" was viewed by 4.14 million viewers and received a 2.2 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49. The episode ranked fourth in its timeslot and was also the highest-rated NBC series of the night.
==Plot==
In the cold open, an Asian man ([[Randall Park]]) arrives to the office and sits at  [[Jim Halpert]]'s ([[John Krasinski]]) desk. [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) asks who he is. The man claims to be the real Jim, and offers proof: he is able to recall his last sales, [[Pam Halpert]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) gives him a kiss, and he has a picture of Pam and himself and their two Asian children. Dwight begins to worry, but Pam explains in a talking head that the man is an actor friend of Jim and Pam's named Steve.

[[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) demands that [[Nellie Bertram]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) research his family tree. To spite him, she falsely tells him that he is related to [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]]  [[Michelle Obama]]. He begins to brag about his discovery, which causes his co-workers to wonder if Andy's family ever owned slaves. In order to get back at his co-workers, Andy asks Nellie to "dig up dirt" on the rest of the office. In turn, she makes up fake facts as a prank. Meanwhile, Pam helps Nellie practice for her driving test. The two bond after Nellie shows appreciation for Pam's art. After telling her that she is worried that Jim is not telling her something, Nellie immediately states that Jim is probably having an affair. Nellie later asks Pam to paint a mural in the warehouse.

[[Darryl Philbin]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) has been promoted to Assistant Regional Manager and as a result is inspired to find ways to be more productive, for himself and the office. However, his ideas for the office are ignored by Andy, leading to a discussion with Jim in the warehouse about their increasing dissatisfaction with Dunder Mifflin. Jim tells Darryl about his sports marketing job opportunity in [[Philadelphia]] and offers him a possible position. However, as Jim has yet to tell Pam, Darryl says he should before going forward. When Pam comes back, Jim reveals the job opportunity to Pam, who, despite giving her approval, is upset that Jim didn't consult her beforehand.

Dwight attempts to teach [[Erin Hannon]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]) the [[Dothraki language]] from the [[HBO]] series ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]'' so that she can impress Andy's educated family. Andy, however, points out that it is a fictional language, leaving Erin dejected. However, as the office leaves for the day, Pete ([[Jake Lacy]]) gives Erin a Dothraki farewell.
