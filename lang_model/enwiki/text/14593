'''[[Super Bowl]] XL''' was an [[American football]] game played on [[February 5]], [[2006]] at [[Ford Field]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Michigan]], to decide the [[National Football League]] (NFL) champion following the [[2005 NFL season|2005 regular season]].

The [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) champion [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (15-5) defeated the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) champion [[Seattle Seahawks]] (15-4), 21<U+2013>10. Although the Seahawks won the turnover battle 2-1, Pittsburgh won on the strength of three big plays converted into touchdowns. Seattle, on the other hand, was plagued by penalties, missed scoring opportunities, and dropped balls.<ref>Miller, Ted. [http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/football/258407_mvp06.html "Ward's performance stands out in less-than-magical game"]; Feb. 6, 2006, ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref> The Pittsburgh Steelers became the fourth [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team, and third in nine years, to win the Super Bowl and also became the first #6 seed in the [[NFL playoffs]] to win a Super Bowl (after becoming the first #6 seed to win a conference title as well as a divisional playoff game) and joined the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and the [[San Francisco 49ers]] as the only franchises to win five Super Bowls.

However, this game did not finish without controversy. As the First half neared an end, [[Ben Roethlisberger]] ran a [[quarterback]] sneak that was called for a touchdown. There was not enough conclusive evidence to support either call so the call remained the same, [[touchdown]]. Also, on a [[Darrell Jackson]] touchdown, there was an [[Pass interference|offensive pass interference]] call that took seven points away from the Seahawks. Next, on a play that gave the Seahawks a first-and-goal on the Pittsburgh one-yard line, there was a holding call against Seahawks [[right tackle]] [[Sean Locklear]]. Finally, a low block call on Seahawks quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] cost the Seahawks fifteen yards on a drive that eventually ended up with an [[interception]] by Steelers [[cornerback]] [[Ike Taylor]].

Steelers [[wide receiver]] [[Hines Ward]], who had five receptions for 123 yards and one touchdown and rushed for 18 yards, was the fifth wide receiver to be named the Super Bowl's [[Super Bowl MVP|Most Valuable Player]] joining [[Lynn Swann]], [[Fred Biletnikoff]], [[Jerry Rice]], and [[Deion Branch]] as the only [[wide receivers]] to win the [[super bowl]] MVP award. [[Antwaan Randle El]] capped off the game with a 43 yard touchdown pass to Hines Ward to give the Steelers a 21-10 edge. Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was 9 of 21 passing for 123 yards, no touchdowns, and two [[interceptions]]. [[Matt Hasselbeck]] finished with 26 of 49 passing for 273 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Running back [[Jerome Bettis]], nicknamed "The Bus" and playing in his hometown of Detroit, announced his retirement after the game, saying "I think the Bus' last stop is here in Detroit." The Steelers finished the season on an eight game winning streak counting down each game to the championship for Bettis. <ref>Sylvester, Curt.

The event drew a 41.6 rating with a 62 share in the audience. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], it was the highest-rated [[Super Bowl]] since [[Super Bowl XXX]], the last time the Steelers appeared in the Super Bowl prior to Super Bowl XL.

==Background==
[[Ford Field]] was selected to host Super Bowl XL on [[November 1]], [[2000]], two years before the stadium opened in 2002;<ref>Unknown. [http://www.detroitlions.com/section_display.cfm?section_id=17&top=21&level=2 "Ford Field"]; Date unknown, ''DetroitLions.com''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref> the only previous Super Bowl held in the Detroit area, [[Super Bowl XVI]], had been played at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] in 1982.  

The NFL promoted the game under the slogan "The Road to Forty."  The slogan not only honored the 40-year history of the game, but was a nod to Detroit's traditional role as the center of the U.S. [[automotive industry]].  In a note related to this, [[Roger Penske]], owner of car dealerships, racing teams, and other related companies, headed the Super Bowl XL host committee.

This was the first Super Bowl to be played on the [[FieldTurf]] surface; each of the previous Super Bowls had been played either on natural grass or on [[AstroTurf]].<ref>Unknown; Date unknown,''easyturf.com''; URL accessed July 14, 2006.</ref>

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
{{main|2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season}}
<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: This is merely a summary, please do not add too much detail. The main Steelers article is probably best for detailed additions. -->
After stumbling to a 7-5 start, the Steelers rebounded and entered Super Bowl XL finishing the regular season with an 11-5 record. (Although the team finished tied with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] for the division lead, the Bengals won the tiebreaker for the [[AFC North]] championship based on better divisional record.) They also became the first team ever to defeat the top three [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeded teams]] on the road in the playoffs (#3 Cincinnati, #1 Indianapolis, #2 Denver and NFC #1 Seattle). In addition, the team became the first sixth-seeded team to reach both a conference championship game and the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team playoff format in [[1990 NFL season|1990]]. 

Under [[Bill Cowher]]'s reign as head coach since 1992, the Steelers had been one of the top teams in the NFL, making the playoffs in 10 out of his 14 seasons, advancing to the [[AFC Championship Game]] six times, and making an appearance in [[Super Bowl XXX]], losing to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] 27-17. After having finished the [[2003 NFL season|2003 season]] with a 6-10 record and after splitting its first two games to open [[2004 NFL season|2004]], Pittsburgh lost starting [[quarterback]] [[Tommy Maddox]] to injury. Maddox was replaced by rookie quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]], who was drafted with the 11th pick in the [[2004 NFL Draft]] but was not expected to play during his rookie season. Nevertheless, Roethlisberger led the Steelers to victory in all of the team's 14 remaining regular season games, giving Pittsburgh a 15-1 record and making the Steelers the first AFC team ever to win 15 games. However, the Steelers lost to eventual Super Bowl champion [[New England Patriots]] in the AFC Championship Game. 

Pittsburgh began the [[2005]] season by winning seven of its first nine games, but suffered a major setback when both Roethlisberger and his backup, [[Charlie Batch]], went down with injuries. With Maddox back as the starter, the team was upset by [[Baltimore Ravens|Baltimore]] and dropped two more games after Roethlisberger's return, falling to then-undefeated Indianapolis, and division rival [[Cincinnati Bengals|Cincinnati]]. The postseason hopes of the Steelers were in peril, but the team recovered to win its final four regular season games and to claim the sixth<U+2014>and final<U+2014>seed in the AFC playoffs.

Roethlisberger was efficient in his 12 regular season games, throwing for 2,385 yards and seventeen touchdowns with nine interceptions, while adding three rushing touchdowns. The Steelers' main receiving threat was [[wide receiver]] Hines Ward, who led the team with 69 receptions for 975 yards and eleven touchdowns. His 69 catches gave him a career total of 574, surpassing a franchise record for receptions previously held by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[John Stallworth]]. On the other side of the field, speedy wide receiver [[Antwaan Randle El]] was a constant breakaway threat, catching 35 passes for 558 yards, while gaining 448 yards and two touchdowns on punt returns. Rookie [[tight end]] [[Heath Miller]] also recorded 39 receptions for 459 yards and six touchdowns. 

Pittsburgh's main strength on offense, however, was its running game. [[Running back]] [[Willie Parker]] was the team's leading rusher with 1,202 yards, while also recording 18 catches for 218 yards and scoring five touchdowns. In short-yardage situations, the team relied on 255-pound running back [[Jerome Bettis]], who rushed for 368 yards and scored nine touchdowns. The 33-year-old Bettis finished his 13th NFL season as the league's fifth all-time leading rusher (13,662 yards and 91 touchdowns), but until this point he had never played in a Super Bowl. The Steelers rushing attack was powered by an offensive line led by [[Pro Bowl]] [[Guard (American football)|guard]] [[Alan Faneca]] and Pro Bowl reserve [[Center (American football)|center]] [[Jeff Hartings]]. 

The Steelers defense ranked fourth in the NFL, giving up 284.0 total yards per game. The Pittsburgh defense was led by its [[linebacker|linebacking]] corps: [[Joey Porter]], [[James Farrior]], [[Clark Haggans]], and [[Larry Foote]].  Porter led all NFL linebackers with 10.5 [[quarterback sack]]s and also recorded two interceptions and a fumble recovery. Haggans tallied nine sacks and 40 tackles, while Farrior added a team-high 119 tackles to go with his two sacks and one fumble recovery. In the secondary, [[Defensive back|free safety]] [[Chris Hope]] led the team with three interceptions, while Pro Bowl safety [[Troy Polamalu]], the team's top threat in the defensive backfield, notched 91 tackles, three sacks, two fumble recoveries, and two interceptions.

The Steelers became just the third team to win the Super Bowl despite not playing a single home game in the playoffs. The [[Green Bay Packers]], who won [[Super Bowl I]] (against the Kansas City Chiefs), and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], who won [[Super Bowl IV]] (against the Minnesota Vikings), also accomplished the feat. The Steelers, however, had to win four games to accomplish the feat, while the Chiefs won three and Packers won only two games.

===Seattle Seahawks===
{{main|2005 Seattle Seahawks season}}
<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: This is just a summary, please do not add too much detail; the main Seahawks article is probably best for detailed additions -->
The Seahawks entered Super Bowl XL after finishing the regular season with an NFC-best 13-3 record. After a rocky 2-2 start, they won 11 consecutive games before losing to the [[Green Bay Packers]] to finish the season. The 13-3 record and 11-game winning streak set new team records.

This was Seattle's first Super Bowl appearance in the team's 30-year history. The Seahawks had been mediocre for much of the 1990s, recording eight consecutive non-winning seasons from 1991 through 1998. The team hit a low point in 1996, when then-owner [[Ken Behring]] announced his intention to move the team to the [[Los Angeles]] area. The team's fortunes began to turn in 1997, when [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]] bought the team and brokered a deal to build a new football stadium, [[Qwest Field]], to replace the aging [[Kingdome]].  [[Mike Holmgren]], who had led the [[Green Bay Packers]] to Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXI|XXXI]] and [[Super Bowl XXXII|XXXII]], became head coach in [[1999 in sports|1999]]. He became the fifth coach to take two different teams to the Super Bowl. [[Joe Jurevicius]] became the sixth player to play in a Super Bowl with three different teams.

Behind [[Matt Hasselbeck]], Seattle finished the 2005 season as the league's top offense, scoring 452 points. Hasselbeck completed 65.5% of his passes for 3,455 yards and 24 touchdowns (against just nine interceptions) and added 124 yards and one touchdown on the ground. [[Shaun Alexander]], who had scored at least sixteen touchdowns in each of the previous four seasons, had the best campaign of his career, leading the league with 1,880 rushing yards and scoring an NFL-record 28 touchdowns, for which he was rewarded with the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award]].  Although the Seahawks suffered injuries to starting wide receivers [[Darrell Jackson]] and [[Bobby Engram]] throughout the season, the passing game nevertheless proved potent, as Engram managed 67 receptions for 778 yards.  [[Joe Jurevicius]], a backup when the season began, started eleven games and made 55 catches for 694 yards and ten touchdowns; tight end [[Jerramy Stevens]] also emerged as a Hasselbeck target, catching 45 passes for 554 yards and scoring five touchdowns. Hasselbeck was protected and Alexander was given time to run by a stout offensive line, led by Pro Bowl offensive tackle [[Walter Jones (football player)|Walter Jones]], guard [[Steve Hutchinson (football)|Steve Hutchinson]], and center [[Robbie Tobeck]], and by bruising Pro Bowl fullback [[Mack Strong]]. 

Though unheralded<U+2014>rookie middle linebacker [[Lofa Tatupu]] was the Seahawks' only defensive Pro Bowler<U+2014>the Seahawks defense recorded 50 quarterback sacks, leading the NFL in that category; [[defensive end]] [[Bryce Fisher]] led the Seahawks with nine sacks, while [[defensive tackle]] [[Rocky Bernard]] added 8.5 and veteran defensive end [[Grant Wistrom]] recorded four. Despite starting two rookies at linebacker for most of the year, the Seattle linebacking corp played well, led by Tatupu, who topped the team with 104 tackles and added four sacks, three interceptions, and one fumble recovery. From his strong safety position, [[Michael Boulware]] led the team  with four interceptions and also tallied two sacks and one fumble recovery. The Seattle secondary suffered injuries throughout the year, notably to free safety [[Ken Hamlin]]; second-year [[cornerback]] [[Jordan Babineaux]] played well as he appeared in all sixteen games for Seattle, intercepting three passes and making 61 tackles. For the year, the defense surrendered just 271 points, 181 fewer than the Seahawks offense scored.

===Playoffs===
<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: This is just a very short summary, please only add detailed additions to the main playoff article -->{{see|NFL playoffs, 2005-06}}

The Steelers became the second team after the [[1985 NFL season|1985]] [[New England Patriots]] to win three road playoff games to reach the Super Bowl. Pittsburgh defeated the third-seeded [[Cincinnati Bengals|Bengals]], 31-17; the top-seeded [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]], 21-18; and the second-seeded [[Denver Broncos]], 34-17, in the [[AFC Championship Game]]. The Steelers also became the ninth [[wild card (sports)|wild-card]] team to go to the Super Bowl and the fourth in nine seasons. The Steelers' catchphrase for the playoffs was "One for the Thumb". 

Meanwhile, the Seahawks became the first team to advance to the Super Bowl without playing a [[Division (sport)|division]] champion in the playoffs. Off a first-round [[bye]], Seattle defeated the sixth-seeded [[Washington Redskins]], 20-10, before eliminating the fifth-seeded [[Carolina Panthers]], 34-14, in the [[NFC Championship Game]]. These were Seattle's first playoff victories since the [[1984 NFL season|1984 season]] when they defeated the Los Angeles Raiders 13-6.

The game was televised in the [[United States]] by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] with [[play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Al Michaels]], [[color commentator]] [[John Madden (football)|John Madden]], who was named the day before to the Class of 2006 by the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]], and sideline reporters [[Michele Tafoya]] and [[Suzy Kolber]]. This was the sixth Super Bowl telecast for Michaels, and the tenth for Madden (whose first was [[Super Bowl XVI]], also played in Michigan). The opening theme was sung by [[Hank Williams Jr]]., who was later spotted in the stands wearing Steelers regalia. 

With the expiration of the current television contracts among ABC, [[CBS]], [[ESPN]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] following the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], this game served as the final telecast for ABC after 36 seasons with the NFL, at least for the foreseeable future.<ref>Unknown.

With the Steelers win, they became the second team to win Super Bowls on three different networks (NBC-[[Super Bowl IX|IX]] and [[Super Bowl XIII|XIII]], [[CBS]]-[[Super Bowl X|X]] and [[Super Bowl XIV|XIV]], and ABC). The first team to earn this distinction was the [[San Francisco 49ers]].

=====Studio Show=====
[[Chris Berman]], from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-owned corporate sibling ESPN, returned to host ABC's pregame show, as he had done for the network's coverage of Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXIV|XXXIV]] and [[Super Bowl XXXVII|XXXVII]]. Berman was joined by his fellow analysts from ESPN's ''Sunday NFL Countdown'' pregame show: [[Michael Irvin]], [[Tom Jackson (American football)|Tom Jackson]], and [[Steve Young (athlete)|Steve Young]], along with co-host [[Mike Tirico]] and [[New England Patriots]] head coach (and three-time Super Bowl winner) [[Bill Belichick]].

====International====
Since the game was being played close to the [[United States-Canada border|U.S.-Canada border]], [[Canada|Canadian]] television rights holders [[Global Television Network|Global]] broadcast portions of an NFL-sponsored "Passport To The Super Bowl" event in nearby [[Windsor, Ontario]], featuring a performance by the newly-revived 1980s rock group [[INXS]] with Canadian native lead singer [[J.D. Fortune]], though the network limited coverage of the Windsor event to short segments immediately prior to commercial breaks.

The game was also televised in [[Australia]] ([[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]), [[Austria]] ([[ORF]] and TW1), [[Brazil]] (ESPN International), [[Denmark]] ([[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]]), [[Finland]] ([[MTV3]]), [[France]] ([[France 2]]), [[Germany]] ([[Alliance of the Public Broadcasters of Germany|ARD]]), [[Hungary]] ([[Sport1]]), [[Iceland]] ([[S<U+00DD>N]]), [[Ireland]] ([[Sky Sports]]), [[Italy]] ([[Sky Sports]] 3), [[Japan]] ([[NHK]] BS-1, [[Nippon Television|NTV]]), [[Mexico]] ([[TV Azteca]]), the [[Netherlands]] ([[SBS6]]), [[New Zealand]] (ESPN International/[[SKY Network Television|SKY TV]]), [[Portugal]] (SportTV), [[Slovenia]] ([[Prva TV]]), [[Spain]] ([[Canal +]]), [[Sweden]] ([[ZTV]]), and [[United Kingdom|UK]] ([[ITV]]/[[Sky Sports]]). According to the NFL, the game was available worldwide in 32 languages.<ref>Unknown. [http://www.nfl.com/international/intl-program "International programming"]; 2006, ''NFL.com''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref>

The main NFL international feed of the game featured [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] broadcasters [[Dick Stockton]] and [[Daryl Johnston]] providing commentary tailored to those largely unfamiliar with the rules of American football.

===Radio===
[[Westwood One]]/[[CBS Radio]] provided radio coverage in the United States, with the broadcasting team of [[Marv Albert]] and [[Boomer Esiason]].

[[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and NFL.com carried international local-language broadcasts from the United Kingdom ([[BBC Radio Five Live]]), Spain ([[Canal+|Canal Plus Spain]]), [[Russia]] ([[NTV Russia|NTV]]), [[Belgium]] ([[BeTV]], in French), [[China]] ([[Shanghai Media Group|SMG]]), and Japan ([[Nippon Television|NTV]]), in addition to the press box intercom and the public address announcer feeds.

==Entertainment==
===Pre-game ceremonies===
During the pre-game ceremonies, [[Stevie Wonder]], along with [[Joss Stone]], [[India.Arie]], and [[John Legend]], performed a medley of Wonder's hits. [[The Four Tops]] also performed during the pregame ceremonies, though the performance was not televised. 
In honor of the fortieth Super Bowl, the pre-game ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 30 of the previous 34 [[Super Bowl MVP|Super Bowl Most Valuable Players]] (with the exception of [[Joe Montana]], [[Terry Bradshaw]], [[Jake Scott (defensive back)|Jake Scott]], and the late [[Harvey Martin]]). The absences of Montana and Bradshaw were originally reported to have been due to disagreements over appearance funds to be paid by the NFL, but each later rebutted such reports, suggesting that they had prior family commitments;<ref>Unknown. [http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs05/news/story?id=2321024 "Montana, Bradshaw deny missing ceremony over $$"]; Feb. 6, 2006, ''ESPN.com''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref> Scott was reported to have been traveling through [[Australia]]. 

A [[moment of silence]] was observed in memory of the two civil rights activists who had died during the months prior to the game: [[Coretta Scott King]] ([[January 30|six days earlier]]) and [[Rosa Parks]] (on [[October 24]], 2005), the latter a long-time Detroit resident.

Singers [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Aaron Neville]], along with pianist [[Dr. John]] and a 150-member choir, performed the national anthem as part of a pre-game tribute to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], a nine-time Super Bowl host city then in the midst of efforts to rebuild in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The national anthem was performed in [[American Sign Language]] by Angela LaGuardia, a teacher at Michigan School for the Deaf.

[[Tom Brady]], MVP of Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXVI|XXXVI]] and [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|XXXVIII]], became the first active player to participate in a Super Bowl coin toss, the result of which toss was tails, as selected by Seattle.

The Steelers became only the third franchise to wear white jerseys despite being the "home" team; the Cowboys ([[Super Bowl XIII|Super Bowls XIII]] and [[Super Bowl XXVII|XXVII]]) and the Redskins ([[Super Bowl XVII]]), both of whom traditionally wear white at home, are the other two. There have been several reasons stated as to why Pittsburgh decided to wear white, ranging from superstition (the Steelers had worn their white uniforms in each of their playoff wins since they were on the road in all three games) to an assertion attributed to Cowher that the Steelers were playing in Detroit, not Pittsburgh, and therefore it wasn't a "home" game (although 10 years earlier Cowher's Steelers did wear their black home jerseys as the "home" team in [[Super Bowl XXX]] at [[Tempe, Arizona]] away from [[Pittsburgh]], where they had won both their playoff games to reach that Super Bowl). The Steelers became the first AFC club to don their white jerseys as "home" team.

===Halftime show===
[[The Rolling Stones]] performed during the [[halftime show]], which was sponsored by the American telecommunications company [[Sprint Nextel Corporation|Sprint]]. The group performed three songs: "[[Start Me Up]]", "[[Rough Justice (The Rolling Stones song)|Rough Justice]]", and "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]". In the wake of the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]] with [[Janet Jackson]], ABC and the NFL imposed a five-second delay and censored lyrics considered too sexually explicit in the first two songs by briefly turning off [[Mick Jagger]]'s microphone, to which censoring the group had previously agreed.<ref>Unknown. [http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/02/06/060206160533.c9b1aybz.html "Rolling Stones agreed to censor Super Bowl show: NFL"]; Feb. 6, 2006, ''Agence France-Presse''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref>

However, the choice of The Rolling Stones sparked controversy in the Detroit community because the band did not represent the [[music of Detroit]] and no other artist from the area was included.<ref>McGraw, Bill. [http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051201/NEWS06/512010493/1008/NEWS "JOURNAL: No R-E-S-P-E-C-T for Motown halftime"]; Dec. 1, 2005, ''Detroit Free Press''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref>

===Post-game ceremonies===
The post-game presentation saw [[Bart Starr]], the MVP of Super Bowls [[Super Bowl I|I]] and [[Super Bowl II|II]], take the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] to the podium, whence it was presented to Steelers owner [[Dan Rooney]].

==Game summary==
After the first four possessions of the game ended with punts, Seahawks punt returner [[Peter Warrick]] gave his team good field position by returning [[Chris Gardocki]]'s 37-yard punt 12 yards to Seattle's 49-yard line. Quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] then started off the drive with a pair of completions to receivers [[Darrell Jackson]] and [[Joe Jurevicius]] for gains of 20 and 11 yards, respectively. On the third play of the drive, Jackson caught a pass in the end-zone, apparently for a touchdown, but the play was nullified on a pass interference penalty on Jackson for pushing off his defender. Running back [[Shaun Alexander]] ran the ball the next two plays, but gained only three yards. Hasselbeck's third-down pass attempt fell incomplete, and the Seahawks were forced to settle for a 47-yard field goal by kicker [[Josh Brown (football player)|Josh Brown]].
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SuperBowlXLactionshot.jpg|400px|thumb|right|A pass in the air shortly after [[Matt Hasselbeck]] released the ball.]] -->
By the end of the first quarter, the Steelers had failed to gain a first down, and quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] had completed one of five pass attempts for one yard. On their first second-quarter possession, Pittsburgh once more was forced to punt after three plays, but benefited from another Seahawks penalty, a holding call that nullified Warrick's 34-yard punt return. The Steelers forced a Seattle punt, but Seattle safety [[Michael Boulware]] intercepted a Roethlisberger pass at the Seattle 17-yard line on the ensuing drive. The Seahawks, though, were once more forced to punt after three plays, and Pittsburgh drove into Seattle territory on the following drive. 

An offensive pass interference call against tight end [[Heath Miller]] and a sack for an eight-yard loss by Seahawks defensive end [[Grant Wistrom]], though, backed the Steelers to the 40-yard line, and left the team facing a third-down-and-28. However, Roethlisberger hit receiver [[Hines Ward]] out of a scramble and extremely unorthodox, against the grain pass for a 37-yard gain to keep the drive going. [[Jerome Bettis]] carried the ball on the next two plays, taking his team to the one-yard line but not into the end-zone. On the third-down play, after the [[two-minute warning]], Roethlisberger faked a handoff and dove into the end-zone himself. 

On the strength of a 19-yard Jurevicius reception, Seattle advanced the ball to the Pittsburgh 36-yard line, but, after the drive stalled, Brown missed a 54-yard field goal attempt to the right and the Steelers ran out the clock to end the first half. 

The Steelers took the ball to begin the second half, and just two plays in, running back [[Willie Parker]] broke through for a 75-yard touchdown run, giving his team a 14-3 lead and setting a record for the longest run in Super Bowl history, beating [[Marcus Allen]]'s [[Super Bowl XVIII]] mark by one yard. 

The Seahawks drove into Pittsburgh territory on the next drive, sparked by a 21-yard run by Alexander, but Brown again missed a field-goal attempt, this one from 50 yards, as Seattle was unable to close the 11-point deficit. 

Pittsburgh drove 54 yards to the Seattle six-yard line to put themselves in position to take a large lead, but Seahawks defensive back [[Kelly Herndon]] intercepted a pass from Roethlisberger and returned it a Super Bowl record 76 yards to the Steelers 20-yard line. From there, the Seahawks required just two plays to score on Hasselbeck's 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Jerramy Stevens]], cutting their deficit to 14-10. 

The teams exchanged punts (two from Pittsburgh, one from Seattle) to fill out most of the third quarter, but the Seahawks ended the quarter having driven from their own two-yard line to near midfield. The drive continued in the fourth quarter, as the Seahawks reached the Pittsburgh 19-yard line. An 18-yard pass to Stevens, though, was negated on a controversial penalty call against Seattle tackle [[Sean Locklear]] for holding, denying the Seahawks an opportunity for a first-down-and-goal from the 1-yard-line. Three plays later, Pittsburgh defensive back [[Ike Taylor]] intercepted a Hasselbeck pass at the 5-yard line and returned it 24 yards. While making the tackle on Taylor, Hasselbeck dove low and was mistakenly flagged for blocking below the waist on an attempt to tackle.  The penalty added 15 yards to the return and gave the Steelers the ball on their own 44-yard line.

Four plays later, Pittsburgh ran a wide receiver reverse, but the play turned out to be a pass play by wide receiver [[Antwaan Randle El]], who played quarterback while in college. Parker took a pitch from Roethlisberger and handed off to Randle El, who was running in the opposite direction. Randle El then pulled up and threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Ward, giving the Steelers a 21-10 lead and also marking the first time a wide receiver threw a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl. 

On the ensuing possession, Hasselbeck ran the ball for eighteen yards and was briefly touched by Steelers linebacker [[Larry Foote]] as the former fell to the ground. Though the play was initially ruled a fumble, with the ball recovered by the Steelers, a Seahawks challenge proved successful, as officials ruled Hasselbeck to have been down prior to his having lost the ball; Seattle, aided by a 13-yard Jurevicius reception, drove to the Pittsburgh 48-yard line but could go no further; a [[Tom Rouen]] punt entered the end zone, giving the Steelers possession on their own 20-yard line. 

Pittsburgh possessed the ball on for nearly four-and-one-half minutes on the ensuing drive, as Bettis carried seven times; Seattle was forced to use all of its three timeouts to stop the clock, but nevertheless had only 1:51 left when it took the ball from its own 20-yard line following a Gardocki punt. A 35-yard reception by Jurevicius took the Seahawks into Pittsburgh territory, and a 13-yard [[Bobby Engram]] reception took the team to within field-goal range, but dubious clock-management and play-calling left the team with just 35 seconds remaining; an incompletion and a three-yard pass to Stevens over the middle over the field consumed 26 seconds, and Hasselbeck threw incomplete near Stevens on fourth down, giving the Steelers the ball on downs with just three seconds left, after which a Roethlisberger kneel-down ended the game.

==Final statistics==
===Overview===
The Steelers became just the third team to win the Super Bowl despite not playing a single home game in the playoffs. The [[Green Bay Packers]], who won [[Super Bowl I]], and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], who won [[Super Bowl IV]], also accomplished the feat. The Steelers, however, had to win four games to accomplish the feat, while the Chiefs won three and Packers won only two games.

Roethlisberger finished the game having completed just 9 of 21 passes for 123 yards and having also thrown two interceptions; his 22.6 [[quarterback rating]] was the lowest ever of any by a Super Bowl winning quarterback.  He also rushed for 25 yards and a touchdown. He became the second youngest [[quarterback]] to start in a Super Bowl and the youngest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at 23 years, 11 months. 

The Pittsburgh rushing game was paced by Willie Parker, who gained 93 yards and one touchdown on just ten carries; Bettis rushed 14 times for 43 yards, converted a key first down, and allowing his team to run time off the clock late in the fourth quarter. Ward caught five passes for 123 yards and a touchdown. In addition to his 43-yard touchdown pass, Randle El caught three passes for 22 yards and returned two punts for 32 yards. In defeat for the Seahawks, Hasselbeck completed 26 of 49 pass attempts for 273 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. Jurevicius caught 5 passes for 93 yards. Engram and Jackson also played roles, combining to gain 120 yards on eleven receptions. Alexander led all rushers in the game, accumulating 95 yards on 20 carries while also catching two passes for two yards. The Steelers were the third team to lose the turnover battle and win the game, after the [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] in [[Super Bowl V]] and the Steelers in [[Super Bowl XIV]].

Defensively, Taylor led the Steelers, making seven tackles, defensing two passes, and intercepting Hasselbeck; for the Seahawks, linebacker Lofa Tatupu recorded nine tackles.

===Reaction to officiating===
{{see|Reaction to officiating in Super Bowl XL}}
Some calls made during Super Bowl XL were met with criticism from both fans and members of the media, as many suggested that referee [[Bill Leavy]]'s crew had wrongly nullified some key plays made by the Seattle offense. Columnist [[Jason Whitlock]] encapsulated many views when he wrote the day after the game, "Leavy and his crew ruined Super Bowl XL. Am I the only one who would like to hear them defend their incompetence?"<ref>Whitlock, Jason. [http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:g0oXMIBdFm0J:www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/sports/columnists/jason_whitlock/13801320.htm+%22hear+them+defend+their+incompetence%22&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=3 "Throw a flag on the officials"]; Feb. 6, 2006, ''Kansas City Star''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref>

In response to the criticisms leveled at the officials, the NFL, just two days after the game, released a statement defending the officials' performance. "The game was properly officiated, including, as in most NFL games, some tight plays that produced disagreement about the calls made by the officials," NFL spokesman [[Greg Aiello]] said in a statement.<ref>Unknown. [http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/football/258739_nfln08.html "NFL Notebook: Game 'properly officiated'"]; Feb. 8, 2006, ''Associated Press''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref> 

The game ended a playoffs season that was plagued by complaints about officiating, most notably during the [[NFL playoffs, 2005-06|divisional playoff]] games between the Steelers and Colts, the Broncos and Patriots, and the Bears and Panthers.<ref>Hench, Kevin. [http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/5251620 "Bad officiating was story of weekend"]; February 2006, ''FOX Sports''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref>

==Commercials==
As usual, the American television broadcast of the Super Bowl showcased top commercials and commanded high prices, estimated at $2.6 million ([[United States dollar|US]]) for a 30-second spot.<ref>Wolk, Martin. [http://msnbc.msn.com/id/10992887 "Super Bowl advertisers take to the Web"]; Jan. 23, 2006, ''MSNBC.com''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref> According to ''[[Advertising Age]]'', [[Anheuser-Busch]] was the top advertiser during the game, having purchased 10 30-second spots. The magazine reported that other companies having purchased multiple commercial segments included [[Ameriquest Mortgage|Ameriquest]] (two), CareerBuilder.com (two), [[Pepsi-Cola]] (four), [[Pizza Hut]] (ten, though most ran prior to kickoff), Sprint (three), [[Procter & Gamble]] (four, three for [[Global Gillette|Gillette]]'s new [[Global Gillette#Current Gillette products|Fusion razor]]), [[Warner Bros.]] (three), [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] (two) and [[Go Daddy|GoDaddy.com]] (two). Three companies aired 60-second advertisements: [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] (for the [[Cadillac]] brand), [[Burger King]], and [[Mobile ESPN]] (the [[Sports Heaven]] ad). Agency [[BBDO]] was the biggest single producer of commercials, creating 19.<ref>Unknown. [http://www.adage.com/news.cms?newsId=47348 "Who's Buying What Ads At The Super Bowl"]; Feb. 4, 2006, ''Advertising Age''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref> [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] also aired several 60-second commercials for some of its shows, including ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', and ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''. <ref>Suzanne Gordon. [http://www.abcmedianet.com/pressrel/dispDNR.html?id=020306_01 "Confirmation of ABC commercials"]</ref> Notably, this was the first Super Bowl during which commercials, in addition to the game itself, were broadcast in [[HDTV]]; on typical [[HDTV]] broadcasts, the commercials themselves are broadcast in standard definition. 

[[Google Video]]<ref>Unknown. [http://video.google.com/superbowl.html "Super Bowl XL Commercials"]; February 2006, ''Google Video''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref> and [[America Online]]<ref>Unknown. [http://sports.aol.com/nfl/superbowlads "Best Super Bowl Commercials 2006"]; February, 2006, ''American Online (AOL.com)''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref> each catalogued ads for later viewing. The ''[[USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter]]'', which measures viewer online reaction to all Super Bowl ads, found the [[Bud Light]] "Magic Refrigerator" spot ranked as the top spot.

==Gambling==
* According to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] oddsmakers, the Steelers opened betting as a four-point [[spread betting|favorite]]. As the Steelers won by eleven points, they covered this spread.
* The [[over-under]], or expected points total, for the game, opened at 47.<ref>Youmans, Matt. [http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Jan-23-Mon-2006/news/5492794.html "Steelers-Seahawks: Let the betting begin"]; Jan. 23, 2006, ''Las Vegas Review-Journal''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref> As the total combined score of this game was only 31 points, the under bet won.
* The [[money line]] was set at roughly +160 for the Seahawks and -180 for the Steelers.

This was just the fifth time in Super Bowl history when a lower-seeded team opened as the favorite to win; the previous occurrences were Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXIX|XXXIX]] (AFC second-seeded [[New England Patriots]] were favored by seven points over NFC top-seed [[Philadelphia Eagles]]), [[Super Bowl XXXV|XXXV]] (AFC fourth-seeded [[Baltimore Ravens]] were favored by three points over NFC top-seed [[New York Giants]]), [[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]] (NFC second-seeded [[San Francisco 49ers]] were favored by seven points over AFC first-seed [[Cincinnati Bengals]]), and [[Super Bowl XVII|XVII]] (AFC second-seeded [[Miami Dolphins]] were favored by three points over [[Washington Redskins]]). In each but the last iteration, the lower-seeded and favored team won.

This was also the second time in Super Bowl history when the favorite was a wild card team; the first was before [[Super Bowl XXXV]], when the Ravens were favored. It also marked the first time since that game the favorite won against the spread.

Members of the winning team each received a payment of $73,000 for playing in the game, while players on the losing team were paid $38,000. The Green Bay Packers received $15,000 each for winning [[Super Bowl I]] in [[1967]]; [[Consumer Price Index|adjusted for inflation]] in 2006 dollars, that sum is roughly $86,000.<ref>Unknown. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6915832 "A Super Bowl share not so super paying"]; Feb. 5, 2006, ''Associated Press''; URL accessed July 3, 2006.</ref>

After having held constant at $600 for three years, the face value of the costliest Super Bowl ticket rose to $700 for the game. On [[eBay]], the least-desirable seats<U+2014>those behind each end zone in the upper level<U+2014>fetched more than $2000 each, while top seats around the 50-yard line sold for more than $6000.

== Ring ==
The ring for the Pittsburgh Steelers was designed by Steelers owner Dan Rooney and Jerome Bettis.  It is crowned by five Vince Lombardi trophies, all topped with football-shaped [[diamond]] settings to represent their five Super Bowl victories.  The base of each trophy has the Roman numeral for their victories, with Super Bowl XL front and center.  In front of the trophies is the Steelers logo set with colored jewels to mimic the colors of the logo.  On the top of the crown is "PITTSBURGH", and on the bottom is "WORLD CHAMPIONS".  One side of the ring has the Super Bowl XL logo and the score of the game.
