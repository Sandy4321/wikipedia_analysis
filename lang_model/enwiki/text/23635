'''Bristol Temple Meads railway station''' is a major rail transport hub in [[Bristol]], [[England]]. It is situated about a mile south-east of the city centre, and is the main station for central Bristol. Bristol's other main-line station, [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]], is on the northern outskirts of the city.

The station is served by express services on the [[Great Western Main Line|Great Western]] route from [[London]] [[Paddington station|Paddington]], [[Virgin Trains|Virgin Cross-Country]] express services between the north of England and the south west, and local and regional trains. Due to the layout of the lines around the station, trains to [[Wales]], the Midlands, the north, London and the south coast all exit at the east end of the station. Only trains heading for [[Cornwall]] exit at the west end. The station has its platforms numbered 1-15, excluding 14; most of the platform faces have two numbers, with platform 4 (for example) being the south end of platform 3.

==History==
The name of the site where the station was built derives from the nearby Temple (or Holy Cross) Church, which was built by the [[Knights Templar]] in the [[12th century]], rebuilt in the [[14th century]], and gutted by bombing during [[World War II]]. The site was within the boundaries of the old city, but some way distant from the commercial centre, and on the far side from fashionable [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]]. It did have the advantage of facing onto the Floating Harbour for transhipment of goods onto boats. The city's cattle market had been built on neighbouring land in [[1830]].

The original terminal station was built for the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) and was designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], the engineer of the GWR. The 72'-wide (22 m) train shed has a wooden box-frame roof and cast-iron columns disguised as hammerbeams above Tudor arches. The station also included a more utilitarian engine shed, and is fronted by an office building in the Tudor style. It is the oldest railway terminus in the world, and is regarded as one of the best [[Victorian era|Victorian]] station buildings. Services to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] started on [[31 August]] [[1840]] and to [[London]] [[Paddington station|Paddington]] in [[1841]]. This part of the station was closed in [[1965]], and fell into disrepair for over twenty years. From [[1989]] until [[1999]] it was the home of The Exploratory, an interactive science centre, and is now the [[British Empire and Commonwealth Museum]]. It is a grade I [[listed building]].

The adjacent through station, which is still used by trains, was built between [[1871]] and [[1878]] under the direction of Brunel's former associate [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]].There have been a number of references to Matthew Digby Wyattt's involvement with the rebuilding of 1871-1876 but there is no documentary evidence in the Minutes of the Joint Committee or on the drawings. The only signature on the drawings is that of Francis Fox (1818-1914) who was the Engineer to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. The curved train shed is 500' (154 m) long on the [[railway platform|platform]] edge and has a wrought-iron roof structure by engineer [[Francis Fox (engineer)|Francis Fox]]. It replaced the [[1844]] station of the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]], which was perpendicular to the GWR station. The Bristol and Exeter's office building, by S. C. Fripp, still stands alongside the station approach. At the same time the Brunel terminus was extended eastward to join up with the new building; since the closure of the terminal station in 1965 this extension has served as a covered car park. The through station was further extended on the east side in the [[1930s]] by architect P. E. Culverhouse, with the addition of two further platform islands, allowing the removal of a narrow island platform in the middle of the 1870s train shed. The through station is also a grade I listed building.

The GWR's goods yard was built on the north-west side of the station, between the passenger station and the [[Bristol Harbour|Floating Harbour]], allowing transhipment of goods onto boats (though not onto ships, as the wharf was upstream of Bristol Bridge). In [[1872]] a further connection to the harbour was made in the form of the [[Bristol Harbour Railway]], which ran between the passenger station and the goods yard, onto a bridge over the street outside, and then descended into a tunnel under the churchyard of [[St. Mary Redcliffe]] on its way to a wharf in a more convenient position downstream of Bristol Bridge. The bridge outside the station remained in use until [[1964]], but has now, along with the goods yard, been entirely swept away.

The station was built for the GWR's [[broad gauge]], and in [[1844]] broad gauge trains of the [[Bristol and Gloucester Railway]] began running from the station. In [[1846]] the B&G was taken over by the [[Midland Railway]], and by [[1853]] it had been converted to [[standard gauge]], with [[dual gauge|mixed gauge]] track running into Temple Meads.  

The original Joint Committee set up in 1865 comprised Great Western, Bristol and Exeter and Midland Railways, hence the three main entrance arches. The capital costs of the work were split 4/14 Great Western/B&E and 10/14 Midland Railway. The ongoing costs were split GWR 3/8, Midland 3/8 and B&E 2/8. Hence when the GWR absorbed the B&E in 1876 the split was GWR 5/8 and Midland (later LMS) 3/8 until Nationalisation in 1948.The station remained a joint GWR-Midland (later GWR-[[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]]) operation until [[nationalization|nationalisation]]. It was converted to standard gauge when the GWR finally abandoned broad gauge in [[1892]].

The former [[Bristol Bath Road TMD|Bath Road Depot]] was situated to the immediate south of the station.

==Station Layout==
In general, platforms are arranged in pairs, with odd-numbered platforms located at the east end of platform faces, and even-numbered at the west end. Platforms 1-4 are located on the main concourse; platforms 1 and 2 being bay platforms. The other platforms are on three islands, containing platforms 4-7, 8-11, and 13 and 15 respectively.
