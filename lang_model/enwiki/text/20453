'''Samiilo Bohdanovych-Zarudny''' ({{lang-uk|<U+0421><U+0430><U+043C><U+0456><U+0439><U+043B><U+043E> <U+0411><U+043E><U+0433><U+0434><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447>-<U+0417><U+0430><U+0440><U+0443><U+0434><U+043D><U+0438><U+0439>}}; {{lang-pl|Samuel Zarudny Bogdanowicz}}) was a [[Cossack]] diplomat, noble and general judge of the [[Zaporozhian Host]], who defected to [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s side at [[Korsun-Shevchenkivskyi]] in 1648.

Bohdanovych-Zarudny played key roles in the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (Pereiaslav Treaty) of 1654 which began when he conducted negotiations in [[Warsaw]] in 1650, and subsequently headed the Kozak delegations to Moscow (1652 and again in 1654) and [[Turkey]] (1653). In 1657 Bohdanovych-Zarudny traveled to [[Transylvania]] to once again initiate negotiations towards another treaty. This eventually led to the 1658 signing, with [[Poland]], of the [[Treaty of Hadiach]] (Hadiache).

Following the decline of [[Ivan Vyhovsky]], Bohdanovych-Zarudny joined [[Yurii Khmelnytsky]] where he participated in drafting the Treaty of Slobodyshche.

In 1664, Bohdanovych-Zarudny fought, alongside the [[Poland|Polish]], against [[Ivan Briukhovetsky]] who eventually signed the [[Moscow Articles of 1665]], effectively placing [[Ukraine]] under the direct rule of the [[Tsar]], and thereby ending Ukraine's independence and autonomy.
