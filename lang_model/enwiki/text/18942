'''''Down on the Upside''''' is the fifth [[studio album]] by the American [[alternative rock]] band [[Soundgarden]], released on May 21, 1996 through [[A&M Records]]. Following a worldwide tour in support of its previous album, ''[[Superunknown]]'' (1994), Soundgarden commenced work on a new album. The music on the album  was notably less heavy than the group's preceding albums and featured the band experimenting with other sounds.

The album debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spawned the singles "[[Pretty Noose]]", "[[Burden in My Hand]]", "[[Blow Up the Outside World]]", and "[[Ty Cobb (song)|Ty Cobb]]". The band took a slot on the 1996 [[Lollapalooza]] tour and afterward supported the album with a worldwide tour. ''Down on the Upside'' would end up becoming Soundgarden's final studio album as tensions within the band led to its break-up in April 1997. The album has been certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States.

==Recording==
The album's recording sessions took place from November 1995 to February 1996 at Studio Litho and [[Bad Animals Studio]] in [[Seattle]], Washington. Studio Litho is owned by [[Pearl Jam]] guitarist [[Stone Gossard]].<ref name="blackholesons">"Black Hole Sons!". ''[[Kerrang!]]''. August 12, 1995.</ref> The band members made the decision to produce the album themselves. On the choice of not working with a producer, frontman [[Chris Cornell]] said that "a fifth guy is too many cooks and convolutes everything. It has to go down too many mental roads, which dilutes it."<ref>Blush, Steven. "Soundgarden". ''Seconds''. 1996.</ref> [[Adam Kasper]], who previously had worked with Soundgarden as an assistant engineer on ''[[Superunknown]]'',<ref name="intensity">Warden, Steve. "A Degree of Intensity".

Work on the album began in July 1995.<ref name="drama">"Soundgarden Man in Near Death Drama". ''[[Kerrang!]]''. March 16, 1996.</ref> The band took a break to perform at festivals in Europe, where new material was road-tested.<ref>Atkinson, Peter. "Soundgarden: From Superunknown to Superstars". ''Jam''. May 24, 1996.</ref> Afterward, the band did more songwriting for about a month and then recorded most of the album at Studio Litho.<ref name="intensity"/> The overall approach to songwriting was less collaborative than with past efforts, with the individual band members having brought in most of the songs more completely written.<ref>Zogbi, Marina.

August 1996</ref> The band tried to create a live atmosphere for the album,<ref name="raygun">Appleford, Steve. "Soundgarden". ''[[Ray Gun (magazine)|Ray Gun]]''.

''Hard Music''. June 1996.</ref> Cornell described the album-making process as "way faster and way easier".<ref name="blackholesons"/>

Most of the material was written by Cornell and bassist [[Ben Shepherd]], the latter having already worked on six of the sixteen album tracks. Reportedly, tensions within the group arose during the recording sessions, with guitarist [[Kim Thayil]] and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell's desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band's trademark.<ref name="soundgardensplit">Colopino, John. "Soundgarden Split". ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.

''Guitar Magazine''. July 1996.</ref> In the [[liner notes]], Thayil credits Gilmore for inspiring the song. He stated that he had a lot of incomplete music ideas that were missing lyrics and were not arranged, so they did not make the album.<ref name="upbeat"/> Thayil said, "It can be a little bit discouraging if there isn't satisfactory creative input, but on the other hand, I write all the solo bits and don't really have limitations on the parts I come up with for guitar."<ref name="upbeat"/> Cornell said, "By the time we were finished, it felt like it had been kind of hard, like it was a long, hard haul. But there was stuff we were discovering."<ref name="raygun"/>

''Rave''.

It's way more honest. It's way more 'responsible.'"<ref name="painting"/>

The band explained at the time that it wanted to experiment with other sounds<ref>Turman, Katherine. "Soundgarden: Seattle's Sonic Boom". ''Hypno''. 1996.</ref> (for example, the song "Ty Cobb" features Shepherd and Cornell playing [[mandolin]] and [[mandola]]<ref name="soundoff"/>). This experimentation can be heard to a lesser degree on ''Superunknown''. Soundgarden used [[Guitar tunings#Alternative tunings|alternative tuning]]s and odd [[time signature]]s on several of the album's songs. For example, "Never the Machine Forever" uses a time signature of 9/8.<ref>"Seattle Supersonic: The Screaming Life & Odd Times of Soundgarden's Kim Thayil". ''[[Guitar Player]]''.

''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' gave the album an eight out of ten. The review said that the album is "as sprawling and generous-spirited as ''Superunknown'', but...is a looser and live-er-sounding affair, not seeking the same level of aural precision."<ref name="spin">(June 1, 1996). "Review: ''Down on the Upside''". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' (p. 109).</ref> ''[[Alternative Press]]'' gave the album a three out of five.

"Review: ''Down on the Upside''". ''[[Alternative Press]]'' (pp. 87-88).</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' staff writer [[David Fricke]] gave ''Down on the Upside'' three out of five stars, observing that the album has "some quality frenzy," but criticizing it for "lack[ing] defining episodes of catharsis." Fricke said, "Soundgarden seem to be digging in their heels rather than kicking up dirt, relying too much on drone-y impressionism and clever (as opposed to cleaving) guitar motifs."<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/soundgarden/albums/album/95658/review/5940544/down_on_the_upside | title=Soundgarden: ''Down on the Upside'' | accessdate=May 20, 2009 | author=Fricke, David | publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' | date=December 2, 1996}}</ref> [[Neil Strauss]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the album the "rawer, looser follow-up to ''Superunknown''." He added, "Generally, identifying with animals in song lyrics is a sign of low self-esteem, and Soundgarden is no exception.

David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the album a B+. Browne said, "Few bands since [[Led Zeppelin]] have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric." He praised several songs as being "as powerful as anything the band has done." Browne criticized the album's production, saying "like many self-produced efforts, it shows." He added, "With arrangements that crest and fall to the point where a road map would have helped, the overlong (16-song) album is often unwieldy and could have benefited from judicious trimming."<ref name="entertainmentweekly">{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292725,00.html | title=''Down on the Upside'' | accessdate=May 20, 2009 | author=Browne, David | publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date=May 24, 1996}}</ref> Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that "it might seem like nothing more than heavy metal, but a closer listen reveals that Soundgarden haven't tempered their ambitions at all."<ref name="allmusic"/> The reviewer for ''[[Melody Maker]]'' said that "their roots don't matter now.

All three singles placed on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] and [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock]] charts. The album's other commercially released single, "[[Ty Cobb (song)|Ty Cobb]]", did not chart, however its acommpanying [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], "Rhinosaur", also from the album, did chart. "Burden in My Hand" was the most successful song from ''Down on the Upside'' on the rock charts, spending a total of five weeks at number one on the Mainstream Rock charts and reaching number two on the Modern Rock charts.<ref name="wm05.allmusic.com"/> At the [[Grammy Awards of 1997|1997 Grammy Awards]], "Pretty Noose" received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1997/grammys.htm |title=39th Grammy Awards - 1997

==Packaging==
The album's cover art, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, features the members of the band in [[silhouette]]. At one point the cover art image for the "[[Blow Up the Outside World]]" single was considered for use as the cover art image for ''Down on the Upside''.<ref>"Blow Up the Outside World". Unofficial SG Homepage.</ref> The album was also released in a limited edition with the ''Into the Upside'' interview disc.

The title ''Down on the Upside'' comes from a line in the song "Dusty". The lyric is "I think it's turning back on me/I'm down on the upside". Cornell said that the title represents the different feels on the album.<ref name="intensity"/> In an interview Cornell explained how the name was chosen:
<blockquote>
"I brought it up at some point because the song that the title came from was "Dusty", but my title for it was ''Down on the Upside'', but Ben wrote the music and he called it "Dusty". So since we don't really like having song titles being the title of the record, 'cause it brings this weird, undue focus to the song, I thought it would be cool to call it ''Down on the Upside''. We started thinking about all these other titles, and worrying about them describing the whole record without excluding anything...So it was the last minute and we were at a photo shoot for ''Spin'' and someone called and said, 'We need your title now so we can start doing the record package,' so [[Matt Cameron|Matt [Cameron]]] brought up the title again, and everyone went, 'yeah, that's it.'"<ref>Ewing, Jerry. "Shooting from the Hip! 20 Questions with Chris Cornell". ''[[Metal Hammer]]''. July 1996.</ref>
</blockquote>
According to an interview with the band, Cameron and Shepherd jokingly said that two other titles considered for the album were ''Mr. Bunchy Pants'' and ''Comin' At Ya!''<ref name="buzzword"/>

==Tour==
The band took a slot on the 1996 [[Lollapalooza]] tour with [[Metallica]]. Metallica had insisted on Soundgarden's appearance on the tour.<ref>Bell, Max. "Soundgarden&nbsp;<U+2014> Like Falling Off a Hog". ''Blah Blah Blah''. June 1996.</ref> Thayil said that the band wasn't interested in doing the tour until it became a "Metallica tour."<ref name="Hard Music 1996"/> During the Lollapalooza tour, the band members reportedly took separate flights and then met at the gigs.<ref name="st.pete">"Soundgarden's End Called the End of Grunge". ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''. April 15, 1997.</ref>

After Lollapalooza, the band embarked on a worldwide tour in support of the album.<ref>Waters, Rodney. "Getting Down with Soundgarden". ''[[Hit Parader]]''. October 1996.</ref> Tensions continued to increase and when asked if the band hated touring, Cornell said, "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring."<ref name="questiontime"/> The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing (specifically Cornell and Shepherd).<ref name="soundgardensplit"/> Cornell said that "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while."<ref>"Soundgarden". ''[[Kerrang!]]''. May 29, 1996.</ref> Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'"<ref name="st.pete"/> The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.<ref name="st.pete"/>

At the tour's final stop in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure, and subsequently stormed off the stage.<ref>"Nirvana and the Story of Grunge", pg. 100.</ref> The band retreated, with Cornell returning to conclude the show with a solo encore.<ref>Berger, John. "'Garden' of supersonic delight". ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]''. February 10, 1997.</ref> On April 9, 1997, the band announced its disbanding. Thayil said, "It was pretty obvious from everybody's general attitude over the course of the previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction."<ref>Gilbert, Jeff. "Sound of Silence". ''[[Guitar World]]''. February 1998.</ref> Cameron later said that Soundgarden was "eaten up by the business."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/aug/13/pearl-jam | title=Pearl Jam: 'People get that this means something' | accessdate=August 13, 2009 | author=Simpson, Dave | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | date=August 13, 2009}}</ref>

==Outtakes==
Various versions of the "Burden in My Hand" single featured two B-sides from the ''Down on the Upside'' recording sessions that were not included on the album, "Karaoke" and "[[Bleed Together]]". "Bleed Together" was included on the band's 1997 greatest hits compilation, ''[[A-Sides]]'', and was released as a promo CD single in 1997. Thayil said that the song was not included on ''Down on the Upside'' because the band was not pleased with the mixing that was done on the song and the band already had enough songs.<ref>"Kim Thayil's A-Sides". ''[[Metal Hammer]]''. January 1998.</ref> Another song that was written and recorded for the album is "Christi".<ref name="gregrule">Rule, Greg.
