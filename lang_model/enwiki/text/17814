"'''Testify, Parts I and II'''" is a single released by the Isley Brothers in 1964. It is one of two singles to feature [[Jimi Hendrix]] on guitar, the other being "Move Over and Let Me Dance". Both singles failed to chart. It was their first of three singles from the T-Neck label.

In 1983, [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] covered the song for the album [[Texas Flood]] where it appears as the fifth track, "Testify". It starts out with a guitar riff and on the 7th bar the drums and bass enter with the beat that carries throughout the whole song. It ends with [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]'s signature string snap. Vaughan played Testify live often.

Some album editions and guitar tablature books wrongly credit "Testify" to [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and D. Taylor, although they wrote the unrelated [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] song of the same name (sometimes called "I Wanna Testify").
