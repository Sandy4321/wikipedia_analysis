'''suede''' (or '''The London Suede''' in the U.S.) were a popular and influential [[England|English]] rock band of the 1990s that helped start the [[Britpop]] musical movement of the decade. Through their several incarnations, they were able to consistently put out albums that charted well, while still holding the respect of critics. Though they never achieved great success in North America, they were considered by some to be as big in the UK in the 90s (at least in terms of popularity) as [[The Smiths]] were in the 80s, or [[Roxy Music]] in the 70s.

==History==
===(1989-1992) Early history===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Brettinblue.jpg|left|135px||thumb|Brett Anderson]] -->
'''suede''' were formed in London in [[1989]] by bassist [[Mat Osman]], singer [[Brett Anderson]] and his then girlfriend, [[Justine Frischmann]], on rhythm guitar. They soon added guitarist [[Bernard Butler]] &ndash; who was recruited through an advertisement in [[Melody Maker]]. Along with a drum machine as percussion, suede were signed to [[RML Records]], a label from [[Brighton]]. Famous comedian [[Ricky Gervais]] (who later found fame with ''[[The Office]]'') managed the band for a brief period before they were signed to a record label. 

With [[Mike Joyce]] (formerly of [[The Smiths]]) famously filling in as drummer, Suede's first record "Be My God"/"Art", was printed but never released due to a dispute with the label. The few surviving records out of a batch of 2000 are considered amongst the rarest of suede collectibles. [[Simon Gilbert (drummer)|Simon Gilbert]] soon replaced the drum machine and suede signed to [[Nude Records]]. Frischmann had left the band by this point, partly because they would not play her songs, and partly because of tension created by the end of her relationship with Anderson and her subsequent dating of [[Damon Albarn]] of [[Blur (band)|Blur]].

The band's first single "[[The Drowners]]" was released amid an alternative media frenzy that began before Suede had released any actual music. The band was on the cover of ''[[Melody Maker]]'', which proclaimed them as "the best new band in Britain" prior to any official release. The debut single created an enormous amount of excitement because of its sharp contrast to the dying [[Madchester]] scene and the grunge sound of the time. Suede were further distinguished from their contemporaries by Anderson's flamboyant looks and noticeably unique vocals, combined with Butler's melodic guitar playing. 

Surprisingly given the amount of press exposure the band had received, "The Drowners" - featuring two strong b-sides in "My Insatiable One" and "To The Birds" - was only a moderate hit. Success would only come with the follow-up singles "[[Metal Mickey (song)|Metal Mickey]]" and "[[Animal Nitrate]]", both of which reached the UK Top 20 on release a few months later.

=== (1993-1997) Britpop and Cool Britannia ===
Their first album ''[[suede (album)|suede]]'' became the fastest selling debut since [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood|Frankie Goes to Hollywood's]] "[[Welcome to the Pleasuredome (album)|Welcome To the Pleasuredome]]" and was catapulted onto the charts after a breakthrough performance on the 1993 [[Brit Awards]]. Featuring heavily-layered production by [[Ed Buller]], the album showed influences from [[The Smiths]], [[David Bowie]], and many other glam rockers, but managed to filter and blend them together, creating its own trademark sound. The band won the [[Mercury Prize]] for best album of the year and had an enormous level of popularity. However, the fan hysteria that surrounded suede in Britain would be shortlived, and never duplicated by the American public. 

Their [[United States|American]] success was limited, despite securing a tour slot with [[the Cranberries]], who had support from [[MTV]]. Moreover, a [[lounge singer]]'s [[lawsuit]] forced the band to stop using the [[trademark]]ed American name "[[suede (singer)|suede]]" (a fate also suffered by fellow UK band [[The Charlatans (British band)|The Charlatans/The Charlatans UK]]). For the North American market, the band would release all of their future albums under the moniker '''The London Suede'''.

Some possible factors cited to explain the band's lack of U.S. success are their quasi-androgynous look and distinct British sound, both of which might have alienated North American audiences. Despite this, the band retained a cult following in cities on both coasts of the U.S. Following the release of their debut album, the band began work on their highly anticipated follow up single and album in late [[1993]] and much of [[1994]]. The hectic schedule the band was facing hinted the problems that were soon to come.

[[Image:Suede95bw.jpg|left|192px|thumb|Suede in 1995.]]
In February of [[1994]], the band released the single ''[[Stay Together]]'', which became their highest charting at the time, reaching number three. Despite their growing profile, tensions within the band mounted as they began working on the second album. Anderson and Butler fought constantly; a major issue was the production of the album (again done by [[Ed Buller]]). Things reached a head when Bernard Butler quit the band altogether in the middle of the recording sessions, leaving behind tapes containing his ideas for the songs that had been written.  The remainder of the guitar work on the album was reputedly completed (depending on the source) either by studio musicians or Brett Anderson himself. 

When ''[[Dog Man Star]]'' ([[1994]]) finally appeared, its sales were generally sluggish, though the album was critically acclaimed. The record was vastly different sounding than the band's debut. It featured a large sound, backed by strings and a horn section in much of it. The year that Blur's ''Parklife'' and Oasis' ''Definitely Maybe'' were fighting for pop supremacy, suede explored darker territory with ''Dog Man Star''. Their image, however, was tainted by the departure of Butler, as they searched for someone to fill his undeniably large shoes.

The vacancy was soon infamously filled by 17 year-old guitarist [[Richard Oakes (guitarist)|Richard Oakes]] (initially nick-named by the UK music press as "Little Dickie") before an international tour to promote the album. Many critics and fans alike had their doubts about the ability of the band to move on without Bernard Butler, who was an integral part of the band's songwriting. However, the band broadened their sound when they were joined by keyboardist and backing vocalist [[Neil Codling]] in the making of their third album, ''[[Coming Up]]'' ([[1996]]). This would be the album which gained the group their most mainstream success. The first single from the album, "[[Trash (song)|Trash]]" was immensely popular and tied with "[[Stay Together]]" as the group's highest charting UK single, reaching number 3.

The album was a hit throughout Europe, Asia and [[Canada]], but still not in the U.S. It did, however, answer those who questioned whether Anderson and company could produce another hit without [[Bernard Butler|Butler]]. Suede had again changed sound drastically; ''Coming Up'' featured more of a [[glam rock|glam]] tinted pop/rock sound, as opposed to the darker elements that the previous albums had showcased. Reviews were again mixed, but the album topped the UK chart and became the band's biggest-selling release. The band was finally getting the mass video and radio play that they lacked during the ''Dog Man Star'' period and in many ways fulfilling the hype that characterized much of the early part of their career. The album brought the band five straight top 10 singles, a remarkable feat by any standards.

The band's next venture was a collection of b-sides and rarities entitled ''[[Sci-Fi Lullabies]]'', which charted well for such a compilation, reaching #9 on the UK chart. The band were well respected for their b-sides, which were often regarded by critics and fans as being close to or equal to the quality of the a-sides they backed.

=== (1998-2003) Late history and "The End" ===
By the time the compilation was released in 1997, though, the Britpop movement was noticeably waning in popularity, and the band had decided to split with long-time producer Ed Buller before commencing work on their follow up to ''Coming Up''.

Despite being backed by the popular lead single "[[Electricity (Suede song)|Electricity]]", Suede's fourth album, ''[[Head Music]]'' ([[1999]]) was something of a critical disappointment, though it once again took the band to number one on the album charts. A synth-infused album that focused less on guitar riffs and more on keyboards, it was produced by [[Steve Osborne]], who had worked with [[Happy Mondays]] and [[New Order]]. Critical opinion was sharply divided; many felt the record was too shallow and lacking in substance, while others thought the album was the group again taking a different direction and charting new territory.

The next three singles released from the album failed to crack the top 10, breaking a run stretching back to 1995's "[[New Generation]]". The b-sides for the singles were also arguably not up to par with their usual standard, which hinted at the drying up of the creative well. Anderson also began being criticized more by fans for his often use of redundant vocabulary and limited lyrical themes. Despite this, even with their drop in mainstream popularity, the band still maintained a large core group of fans.

[[Image:Suedeheadmusicwires.jpg|left|200px||thumb|Suede circa 1999. From the left: Gilbert, Osman, Oakes, Codling, and Anderson.]]
Not long after the release of ''Head Music'', [[Nude Records]] effectively ceased to exist. Like many of their labelmates, suede ended up signing to Nude's parent company/distributor [[Sony Records|Sony]] to record their fifth album, ''[[A New Morning]]'' ([[2002]]). The long and troubled gestation of the album saw keyboardist [[Neil Codling]] leave the band, citing [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], to be replaced by long-time band associate Alex Lee, formerly of [[Strangelove (band)|Strangelove]].

In concerts, Lee played second guitar, as well as keyboards, [[backing vocals]] and, at one point, [[harmonica]]. The album title, according to Anderson, referred to "a fresh start, a new band and a new fresh outlook" - the singer had reportedly been addicted to [[heroin]] and crack [[cocaine]] for a number of years by this time, which was having an increasingly deleterious effect on his health. He was quoted at the time as saying "we've all cleaned up our drug problems ...which is nice." 

Despite the rejuvenation of the group's health, the album was a commercial disappointment and failed to crack the top 20. Produced by "big name" Britpop producers [[John Leckie]] (who famously produced [[The Stone Roses]]' debut LP, as well as records for [[Radiohead]] and [[Muse (band)|Muse]]) and [[Stephen Street]] (most famous for his work with [[The Smiths]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]]), ''A New Morning'' was considered a solid enough outing by fans of the band, but critical reaction was decidedly lukewarm and the mainstream public interest had long disappeared. Only two singles, ''Positivity'' and ''Obsessions'', were released from the album, the fewest singles taken from any of the band's albums, and neither charted particularly well.

In Autumn [[2003]], after the release of their ''[[Singles (suede album)|Singles]]'' "best of" album and accompanying single "[[Attitude (single)|Attitude]]", suede played five nights at London's [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]], dedicating each night to one of their five albums and playing through an entire album a night &ndash; with B-sides and rarities as encores &ndash; in chronological order (a mammoth rehearsal task for any band). After these shows, the band announced there would be no more projects under the Suede name for the foreseeable future &ndash; effectively announcing the end of the band.

Their last concert at London's Astoria on [[December 13]], [[2003]] was a two-and-a-half hour marathon show, split into two parts (plus encore) with the first part being "songs we want to play". Brett made an announcement that "there will be another suede album" to everyone's delight, but added "...but not yet". "See you in the Next Life" was their closing remark.

=== (2004-present) Post-break activity ===
In May [[2004]] Anderson confirmed rumours that he and original Suede guitarist [[Bernard Butler]] were working together again &ndash; they had written 15 songs and were putting together a band, [[The Tears]], who have since released their debut album to critical acclaim and with commercial success, though a follow-up seems a distant possibility with Anderson investing time in his solo career and the band officially on hiatus.

Alex Lee played a short set with former [[Strangelove (band)|Strangelove]] band-mate [[Patrick Duff]] at the Tsunami Appeal Gig at the [[Bristol Carling Academy]] on Saturday 19th February and continued to tour with him. He now plays guitar and keyboard with [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]]. Neil Codling has toured as keyboardist for pop singer [[Natalie Imbruglia]] and has played as a duo called ''Barry O'Niel'' comprising him and Harriet Cawley. Gilbert is currently the drummer for international band [[Futon (band)|Futon]], based in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] while Osman plays for the [[U.K.]] rock band Mista Brown.

Brett Anderson also has confirmed that he has a self-titled [[Brett Anderson (album)|solo album]] planned for early 2007.
