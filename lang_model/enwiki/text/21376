'''''Basic Concepts in Sociology''''' is a [[book]] written by [[Maximilian Weber]], a [[Germany|German]] [[economist]] and [[sociologist]]. The original edition was published in German, but various [[translation]]s to [[English (language)|English]] exist. The first known of these was written in [[1952]].

This is part of a monumental work that was interrupted by Weber's death. He attempted to summarize all important concepts of [[sociology]] in that part.
