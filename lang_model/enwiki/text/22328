The periodical started its circulation after a proposal by [[Adamantios Korais]], a leading figure of the [[modern Greek Enlightenment]], who had stressed the need of a printed medium, written in [[Demotic Greek|vernacular Greek]]. This initiative was supported by the ''Philological Society'' in [[Bucharest]], an organization consisting of Greek intellectuals. ''Hermes o Logios'' 
reflected the style of other European periodicals of early 19th century and reviewed developments in arts and sciences, being an important channel for bringing contemporary intellectual movements to the attention of the Greeks that lived in the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=Culture/> It was closed down by the Austrian authorities the time the Greek War of Independence broke out.<ref>{{cite book | last= Institut fran<U+00E7>ais d'<U+00E9>tudes anatoliennes d'Istanbul |first= | title= M<U+00E9>decins et ing<U+00E9>nieurs ottomans <U+00E0> l'<U+00E2>ge des nationalismes| publisher=Maisonneuve & Larose| year=2003 | editor= | pages= 226, 231 |url= http://books.google.gr/books?id=pf4__SvNz6kC&pg=PA259&dq=%22logios+hermis%22&lr=&as_brr=0&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22logios%20hermis%22&f=false | isbn=9792706817624}}</ref><ref name=Mackridge142/>

==Background==
{{See also|Modern Greek Enlightenment}}
During the 18th century the ideals of the Western European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[French Revolution]] became widely known to the Greek scholars. They soon realized the potential of these new ideals, and especially of popular freedom and sovereignty for their own national struggle against Ottoman rule.<ref name=Margarita/> [[Adamantios Korais]], a humanist scholar and leading figure of the [[modern Greek Enlightenment]], had stressed the desirability of a printed medium, written in the vernacular language, in order to spread these ideas to the Greek people, that lived in the Ottoman Empire and the Diaspora in Western Europe as well. Korais explained about the necessity of a periodical that will gather material from political and philological newspapers of the enlightened peoples of Europe and from reports from Ottoman ruled Greece. He also stressed that this should be edited by a man of learning and proposed that his friend [[Anthimos Gazis]], scholar and Orthodox priest in [[Vienna]], should be the most suitable person.<ref name=Janssen1/> 

Vienna became the right place for such an initiative, since it was already the most important publishing centre for the Greek diaspora.<ref name=Papaskarras8>Pappas, Karas: p. 8</ref> In 1783 the Austrian Emperor had authorized the free printing of Greek books in the city while in 1790 the first Greek newspaper, named [[Ephimeris]], was published there.<ref>D<U+0113>maras: p. 162</ref>

==History==
===Establishment (1811<U+2013>1813)===
[[File:Anthimos Gazis.jpg|thumb|160px|Anthimos Gazis, one of the main editors of ''Hermes o Logios'' during 1811-1813.]]
''Hermes o Logios'' was established with the support of the ''Philological Society'' in [[Bucharest]], an organization consisting of Greek intellectuals headed by the local Greek Orthodox Bishop, Ignatios.<ref name=Janssen1>Janssen: p. 1</ref> The Society<U+2019>s goals, as published in the first issue of the periodical, were "the awakening to the progress of learning" and "the cultivation of the newer Greek language". Apart from ''Hermes o Logios'', the Society supervised also a Greek-language school, financed translations of schoolbooks into [[Modern Greek language|modern Greek]] and provided scholarships for students to study abroad. Ignatios has already stated the need for a philological newspaper, in which each man of learning could publish his ideas, adding that "This is what the wise man Korais advises us to do and he has wisely chosen a worthy man, [[archimandrite]] Anthimos Gazis". The members of the Society then all agreed to cover part of the printing expenses.<ref>Janssen: p. 2</ref> 

The first issue of ''Hermes o Logios'' was published on January 1, 1811, under the full title ''{{Polytonic|<U+1F19><U+03C1><U+03BC><U+1FC6><U+03C2> <U+1F41> <U+039B><U+03CC><U+03B3><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2>, <U+1F25> <U+03A6><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B3><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03AF> <U+1F08><U+03B3><U+03B3><U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03B9>}}'' (''Hermes the Scholar, or Philological Reports''). In the first three years of its existence (1811<U+2013>1813), ''Hermes o Logios'' appeared twice a month and each issue usually consisted of 16 pages. In April 1813, Anthimos Gazis left Vienna and the editorship of the periodical was taken over by Theoklitos Farmakidis, another priest and an even more fanatical supporter of Korais.<ref name= Janssen3/>

===Crisis and revival (1814<U+2013>1820)===
''Hermes o Logios'' faced serious financial problems during this period. When the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806<U+2013>1812)|Russo-Turkish War of 1806<U+2013>1812]] ended, Ignatios was forced to resign and leave Bucharest and its main sponsor, the ''Philological Society'', ceased to exist.<ref name= Janssen3>Janssen: p. 3</ref> In an announcement published as an appendix to the issues of 1813 (dated April 1, 1813), [[Alexandros Vasileiou]], a supporter of Korais and influential personality within the Greek community of Vienna, states this fact, as well as that the periodical had too few subscribers. He therefore called on all readers to canvass for new subscribers; moreover he called upon all scholars to send in their contributions.<ref name= Janssen3/>

During the period 1814<U+2013>1815, ''Hermes o Logios'' reached an absolute low, with seven issues in 1814 and only one in 1815, which consisted of 16 pages written by Korais and directed against his ideological adversary, the conservative scholar, [[Neophytos Doukas]]. On the other hand Gazis returned.<ref name=Janssen4>Janssen: p. 4</ref> In the following years, however, the periodical was subsidized by the [[Prince of Moldavia|princes of Moldavia]], [[Scarlat Callimachi (hospodar)|Scarlat Callimachi]] and [[Michael Soutzos]].<ref name=Mackridge124>Mackridge: p. 124</ref> Apart from the difficulties faced, 1816 was a turning point, as two scholars and adherents of Korais, Theoklitos Farmakidis and Konstantinos Kokkinakis, were placed in charge. Consequently, ''Hermes o Logios'' actually became an outlet for Korais and continued to appear without interruption until the Greek War of Independence.<ref>D<U+0113>maras: p. 199</ref>

===Outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821)===
In 1821, the year that the War of Independence broke out, nine issues appeared between January and May. There is a special appendix to the issue of April 1, 1821, containing a Greek translation of an article dated March 29, taken from the [[Wiener Zeitung]], which reports on the uprising of [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792<U+2013>1828)|Alexandros Ypsilantis]] and [[Tudor Vladimirescu]] in the [[Danubian Principalities]], that marked the beginning of the [[Greek War of Independence]], and also states the official Austrian standpoint. In the issue of May 1, while Ypsilantis<U+2019> campaign was in full swing, the Austrian authorities required the editors to publish the [[excommunication]] issued by the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], [[Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople|Gregory V]], against the architects of this uprising.<ref name=Culture/><ref name=Janssen4/> This was the last issue of ''Hermes o Logios'' which then was closed down by the local authorities and Kokkinakis was arrested as a member of the patriotic organization [[Filiki Eteria]].<ref name=Mackridge142>Mackridge: p. 142</ref>

''Hermes o Logios'' is regarded as the most important Greek periodical of the era of [[modern Greek Enlightenment]], also known  as ''Diafotismos''. It appeared regularly over a period of ten and a half years and was the longest-running periodical prior to the outbreak of the Revolution.<ref name=Culture /> All volumes cover a total of 5131 pages, with texts on various subjects written by 918 contributors.<ref name=Janssen5>Janssen: p. 5</ref>

===Arts and sciences===
Its primary goal was to inform the Greek-speaking public within the Ottoman Empire and in the diaspora. Moreover, in favouring the views of Adamantios Korais it reflected the style of other European periodicals of that era. It reviewed developments in arts and sciences and was an important channel for bringing contemporary intellectual movements to the attention of the Ottoman-ruled Greeks.<ref name=Culture/> Additionally, it reproduced catalogues of European scientific books, and exhorted Greek scholars to translate and publish them, like those of [[Louis Jacques Th<U+00E9>nard]]. The journal also published comments on astronomical observations, experiments and various articles on natural philosophy, which alternated with articles on history and philosophy.<ref>Pappas, Karas: p. 7</ref> Greek scholars used as sources German or French educational books on physics, or translated and published texts on natural philosophy with large circulations in Europe, like the works of [[Antoine Fran<U+00E7>ois, comte de Fourcroy|Antoine Fourcroy]], [[Ren<U+00E9> Just Ha<U+00FC>y]], and [[J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me Lalande]].<ref name=Papaskarras8/>

===Possible revolutionary background===
Although ''Hermes o Logios'' was the most important publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution. On the surface of things, it did not seem so. There was the Austrian censure to be reckoned with the conservative minister [[Klemens von Metternich]] and his secret police that kept a very close eye on the activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization [[Filiki Etaireia]] and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, on the evening of the Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., nothing out of the ordinary was published.<ref>Janssen: p. 11</ref> On the other hand, there is no doubt that the contributors of ''Hermes o Logios'' dreamed of the liberation of the Greek nation and of an independent state.<ref>Janssen: p. 12</ref>

===Positions in the Greek language question===
In respect to the [[Greek language question]], it becomes obvious that from the very beginning ''Hermes o Logios'' adhered to Korais<U+2019> views.<ref name=Janssen1/> Korais claimed that the appropriate language for the Greek nation should be a vernacular ([[Demotic Greek|Demotic]]) language without foreign words and accepted some views by conservative scholars to retain a tincure of archaism.<ref>{{cite book | last=Merry|first= Bruce | title=Encyclopedia of modern Greek literature | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group| year=2004| editor= | page= 236 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=Q-lr20SuvfIC&pg=PA235&dq=korais%2Bmiddle&hl=el&ei=SrkkTd_mDYXysgb13My9Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=korais%2Bmiddle&f=false| isbn=9780313308130}}</ref> On the other hand some of Korais' opponents, both coservatives and vernacularists, published their own magazines in which they attacked his linguistic views.<ref name=Mackridge124/>
