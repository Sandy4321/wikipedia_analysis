'''United Future New Zealand''',<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/UnitedFuture_Constitution.pdf |title=Constitution of United Future New Zealand |accessdate=8 June 2013 |quote=The name of the party shall be United Future New Zealand}}</ref> usually known as '''United Future''', is a registered [[New Zealand]] [[political party]]. With the formation of the [[50th New Zealand Parliament]] after the 2011 election,<ref>http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/mpp/parties/</ref> it has a single member of the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] <U+2013> party leader [[Peter Dunne]], an electorate MP <U+2013> and it has signed a confidence and supply agreement with the National Party, making it, along with ACT and the Maori Party, a support partner to the minority National government.

==Formation and early success==
United Future was formed from the merger of liberal centrist party [[United New Zealand]] and Christian-dominated conservative [[Future New Zealand]] to contest the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 election]]. United, formed as a centrist party by a group of moderate Labour and National MPs, held one seat in parliament<U+2014>that of Dunne. Future New Zealand, which was not represented in parliament, was a "secularised" evolution of the [[New Zealand Christian Democratic Party|Christian Democrats]], following the same basic principles as the Christian Democrats, but abandoning the explicit religious connection.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

United Future's first party president, Inky Tulloch, stated that "United Future isn't a Christian party <U+2013> it's a political party that has a lot of Christians in it, and a lot of non-Christians."{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Tulloch said that the "universal principles of family, of common sense, of looking after one another, of compassion, integrity" are equally valuable to both Christians and non-Christians.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Support for United Future, which was already growing in early 2002, was boosted further by Peter Dunne's strong television debating performance and the public response to it. The uplift in United Future support during the last two weeks of the campaign caught many commentators by surprise and drew votes away from National, [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] and the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green]] parties, who were engaged in a public squabble over genetic engineering.

United Future made a strong showing in the 2002 election, taking 6.7 percent of the vote and eight seats: Dunne's electorate seat of [[Ohariu-Belmont]] and seven list seats.<ref name="2002 election">{{cite web |title=Official Count Results -- Overall Status |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2002/partystatus.html |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> It would have been assured of getting into parliament in any event, however; under New Zealand's [[mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] system, any party that wins at least one electorate seat qualifies for list seats even if it falls short of the five-percent threshold.  The party faced a minor embarrassment after the election, however, when it was discovered that one of its list MPs, [[Kelly Chal]], was not a New Zealand citizen, and thus ineligible to stand for parliament.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/423466/125116 |title=No police probe into Chal error |date=19 August 2002 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref>

==Early activity==
After 2002 United Future in its family law reform proposals took to heart the trauma and adverse impact on children caused by the separation of their parents. United Future MP [[Judy Turner]] made clear that then current government policies were failing in regard to keeping both parents in children's lives, and to this extent made a huge effort in promoting a [[Private Member's Bill|Member<U+2019>s Bill]] on mandatory [[mediation]] by means of a national roll-out of the North Shore Family Court "Children in the Middle" pilot programme.

United Future MPs exercised their individual conscience votes to oppose a Bill to enable [[Civil unions in New Zealand|civil unions]]. This provided an alternative to marriage for same-sex couples and to opposite-sex couples who choose not to marry. A civil union provides a couple with most of the same rights as married couples. However, Peter Dunne and Judy Turner both supported a companion Bill to give legal recognition to civil unions.

In mid-2004 United Future announced that it would contest the 2005 general election in partnership with [[Outdoor Recreation New Zealand]]. Cynics pointed out that here was another minor party that failed to reach the 5% threshold (Outdoor Recreation gained 1.28% of the vote in the 2002 election) seeking parliamentary representation via the security of Peter Dunne's electorate seat.

A month before the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 election]], list MP [[Paul Adams (New Zealand politician)|Paul Adams]] quit the party to stand as an independent in the East Coast Bays electorate. His daughter Sharee Adams, also on the United Future List, also quit to assist her father in his campaign. After the general election, disgruntled right-winger and ex-United Future MP [[Marc Alexander]] also voiced repeated criticisms of his former colleagues, in his "Marc My Words" political opinion column for [[Scoop (news website)|''Scoop'']], a New Zealand news website.

In the 2005 election, United Future had the support of the [[WIN Party]], which was set up to fight the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants. WIN's leader, [[John van Buren]], was United Future's candidate for Christchurch Central. This further spoke of alliances still to come. In this election, support plummeted to 2.8% and the party won only three seats. Peter Dunne retained Ohariu-Belmont, and [[Gordon Copeland]] and Judy Turner were returned on its party list.

United Future had tried to distance itself from its more assertive fundamentalist list MPs, such as Adams, [[Larry Baldock]] and [[Murray Smith (New Zealand)|Murray Smith]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} As Election New Zealand data revealed that the Outdoor Recreation Party still provided about 1% of the vote, 4.8% of the previous vote had gone elsewhere. During 2004-2005, the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] had made renewed efforts to attract social conservative voters, through adoption of [[pro-life]] and anti-[[same-sex marriage]] voting records.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Following the 2005 election, [[New Zealand First]] and United Future entered into a [[confidence and supply]] agreement with Labour, under which Dunne became Minister of Revenue, outside Cabinet.

In March 2006 [[Outdoor Recreation New Zealand]] split with United Future, due to a dissatisfaction with what it saw as the [[Christian evangelism]] within the party. Outdoor Recreation acting chairman Phil Hoare said, "We strongly believe in the traditional bedrock values of our nation's heritage but we also affirm the separation of church and state." <ref name="NZ_Herald_10374646">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10374646 |title=Outdoor Recreation splits from United Future |date=27 March 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}</ref>  In 2006 several younger centrist members also departed from the party.

United Future, like most New Zealand Parliamentary parties, was caught up in the [[2005 New Zealand election funding controversy]]. It voted in favour of the retrospective validating legislation, which was passed through the New Zealand Parliament in October 2006.
[[File:UnitedFutureNewZealandLogo.png|right|thumb|300px|Old United Future logo]]

From February to April 2007, Peter Dunne exercised his own right to a [[conscience vote]] to support [[Sue Bradford]]'s [[private members bill]] against parental corporal punishment of children, while Gordon Copeland vigorously opposed it, as did Judy Turner, but on a more subtle level.<ref>[http://www.greens.org.nz/searchdocs/other8639.html Section 59 Crimes Act Repeal]</ref>

On 16 May 2007, Copeland resigned from the party due to his dissatisfaction with Dunne's support for the aforementioned private members bill, although Turner did not follow suit.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10440050">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10440050 |title=United Future MP quits party over smacking bill |author=Tait, Maggie |date=16 May 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}</ref> Copeland was subsequently part of forming the socially conservative [[The Kiwi Party|Kiwi Party]]. Several other United Future members resigned in sympathy with Copeland, including former United Future List MPs [[Larry Baldock]] and [[Bernie Ogilvy]]. In 2011, the Kiwi Party ceased to exist as an independent entity after it merged with the [[Conservative Party of New Zealand]], another conservative Christian dominated centre-right political party, currently unrepresented in Parliament.

On 13 August 2007 United Future unveiled a new logo which Dunne said was a revitalisation of the party before the 2008 election.<ref>[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0708/S00207.htm UnitedFuture unveils new logo]</ref> The re-branding of the party was taken further on 3 September 2007 when Peter Dunne announced that United Future was rebranding itself as a sensible, moderate centre party after the break with its former conservative Christian faction. Speaking of the departure of the Christian faction Dunne stated "I think it's taken a bit of a monkey off our back, frankly."<ref name="NZ_Herald_10461328">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10461328 |title=Dunne rebrands United Future after Christian faction split |date=3 September 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}</ref>

==Policy==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
United Future adopted the following mission statement in early 2007:

"United Future is a modern centre party, focused on New Zealand's best interests. We promote strong families and vibrant communities. We seek a fair, and open society, free from poverty, ignorance and prejudice, and based on innovation, self-reliance, justice and integrity in business and personal dealings. We promote a sustainable environment, and a competitive economy which encourages growth, prosperity, ownership and opportunity through market policies where possible, and government where necessary. We want all New Zealanders, whatever their background, race or creed, to have the chance to enjoy everything that is good in our country."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0708/S00207.htm|title=UnitedFuture unveils new logo|date=13 August 2007|accessdate=2007-10-31|publisher=[[Scoop (news website)|Scoop.co.nz]]}}</ref>

In 2007 the party had a number of policy successes, including:
*Bringing about the first cut in the business tax rate in 20 years;
*Making all personal and corporate donations to charity tax deductible;
*Extending summer daylight saving hours by three weeks;
*Introducing legislation to increase the minimum driving age to 16 years;
*Leading the campaign for a code of conduct for MPs;
*Playing a leading role in getting the government to back down on planned new rules for financing elections, and proposed restrictions on birth, death and marriage data for historical and genealogical research purposes;
*Establishing a special government task force to look at using deer, [[chamois]] and [[tahr]] as a recreational hunting resource.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

== 2008 election ==
In [[New Zealand general election, 2008|2008]] the United Future Party named candidates for 51 seats.<ref>''Dominion Post''. 15 April 2008 page A2</ref> Policies included tax cuts and various initiatives aimed at supporting parents, such as the extension of paid parental leave to 12 months; the option of income splitting for parents with dependent children and couples in which one partner relies on the other for financial support; and the promotion of shared parenting. There were also a number of healthcare policies including granting everyone one free health check per year.

The election resulted in Peter Dunne's re-election as United Future's only surviving Member of Parliament. He retained his own parliamentary seat of [[Ohariu-Belmont]], but United Future itself did not poll sufficiently highly to bring additional caucus members into Parliament alongside him. It is unknown how many former Future New Zealand members defected from United Future to establish [[The Kiwi Party]], which was unsuccessful in retaining parliamentary representation after the election.

The [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] won the most seats overall and formed a [[minority government]] with support from United Future as well as the [[Maori Party]] and [[ACT New Zealand]]. Dunne retained his portfolios as Minister of Revenue and Associate Minister for Health.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10543509">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10543509 |title=Key's Government |date=17 November 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}</ref>

==2011 election==
In [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011]] United Future campaigned on income sharing, flexible superannuation and restricting asset sales.<ref name="Press_23-11-11">{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/opinion/perspective/6015942/Economically-Right-socially-Left |title=Economically Right, socially Left  |date=23 November 2011 |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref>

Peter Dunne retained the electorate of [[<U+014C>hariu (New Zealand electorate)|<U+014C>hariu electorate]], formerly [[Ohariu-Belmont]].  The Labour candidate [[Charles Chauvel (politician)|Charles Chauvel]] accused Dunne and the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] of an "unprincipled political deal" which encouraged National voters to give their electorate vote to Dunne to ensure his survival as an MP.<ref name="Dom_Post_22-08-11">{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/5482389/Key-gives-Dunne-clear-run-at-Ohariu |title=Key gives Dunne clear run at Ohariu |date=22 August 2011 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)]] |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref>

As in 2008, the National Party won the most seats overall and formed a [[minority government]] with support from United Future as well as the [[Maori Party]] and [[ACT New Zealand]].  Together with his previous Revenue and Associate Health portfolios, Dunne became Associate Minister of Conservation.  The agreement also included provisions barring the sale of [[Kiwibank]] or [[Radio New Zealand]], and public consultation on United Future's flexible superannuation policy.<ref name="Dom_Post_5-12-11">{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/6088106/Dunne-does-deal-to-fight-RNZ-sale |title=Dunne does deal to fight RNZ sale  |date=5 December 2011 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)]] |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref>

==Temporary Party Deregistration and Consequent Reregistration==
On 31 May 2013 the Electoral Commission cancelled United Future's registration at the party's request after it failed to retain 500 members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/cancellation-united-future-31-may-2013 |title=Cancellation of United Future |publisher=New Zealand Electoral Commission |date=2013-05-31 |accessdate=2013-05-31}}</ref> The party was an unregistered party and unable to contest the party list vote. However, on 10 June 2013, its party president made a media release stating that it had succeeded in attracting the needed 500 members for re-registration<ref>"United Future request to be re-registered" Scoop.co.nz: 10.06.2013: http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1306/S00179/unitedfuture-request-to-be-re-registered.htm</ref> It was subsequently reported that United Future was encountering difficulties over its re-registration, related to the need to acquire printed proof of sufficient membership, although Party President Robin Gunston has supplied the Electoral Commission with copies of traceable economic transactions associated with the influx of new members<ref>"United Future applies for re-registration" ''3 News:'' 10.06.2013: http://www.3news.co.nz/news/United-Future-applies-for-re-registration/tabid/1607/articleID/301116/Default.aspx</ref>

On 16 June 2013, the [[New Zealand Electoral Commission]] noted that United Future had provided the aforementioned spreadsheet record, which contained names and details of putative party members. It noted that under Section 63 of the New Zealand Electoral Act 1993, bona fide registered political parties were bound to supply name, address, eligibility for membership, evidence of paid membership fees, member authorisation to record such details and to release them to a third party. The Commission stated that it would therefore accept signed and dated (although electronically submitted) membership forms from United Future and other eligible parties as evidence of membership enrolment. Signature and membership authenticity had yet to be assessed at that point <ref>http://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/1306/United_Future_Decision_19_06_13.pdf</ref>

Events took a further turn when [[New Zealand Parliament]] Speaker [[David Carter (politician)|David Carter]] ruled that as United Future could not guarantee that his party had 500 financially solvent members for another six to eight weeks after Dunne had submitted a membership list to the New Zealand Electoral Commission, Dunne would therefore have to sit as an "independent" Member of Parliament, and forfeit NZ$100,000 parliamentary party leader operational funding unless and until United Future could conclusively establish whether or not it had sufficient membership to warrant re-registration. This occurred after [[New Zealand Labour Party]] MP [[Trevor Mallard]] contacted the New Zealand Attorney-General over the current legal status of United Future<ref>Hamish Rutherford: "Speaker backed in Dunne funding row" ''Dominion Post'': 25.06.2013: http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8838701/Speaker-backed-in-Dunne-funding-row</ref>

On 8 July 2013, Dunne stated that his party had now been able to enrol sufficient members to satisfy the Electoral Commission's random sampling techniques, although he also noted that the process of evaluation and re-enrolment would take six to eight weeks.<ref>Tracey Watkins: "UnitedFuture passes membership goal" ''Stuff.co.nz'': 08.07.2013: http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8891096/UnitedFuture-passes-membership-goal</ref> At the same time, the New Zealand Electoral Commission verified that this was indeed the case and then clarified what would happen next. There would be an interim period when it checked the actual status of the party's membership, then provided public notice of United Future's membership application and invitation of comments, then provide the applicant party's leadership with an opportunity to respond to the comments and then decide whether to refuse or approve the application from United Future<ref>http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/party-registration-process-underway</ref><ref>http://www.elections.org.nz/registering-political-party</ref> On 30 July 2013, the New Zealand Electoral Commission requested input pending United Future's ultimate reregistration <ref>http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/application-register-political-party-1</ref>

On 13 August 2013 the electoral commission accepted United Future's re-registration.<ref>http://www.3news.co.nz/Dunnes-party-re-registered/tabid/1607/articleID/308772/Default.aspx</ref>
