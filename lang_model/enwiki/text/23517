The '''Illinois Freedom Bell''' is located in [[Mount Morris, Illinois]], United States, and is the official freedom bell of the U.S. state of [[Illinois]]. The bell was created for a church in [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin|Lake Geneva]], [[Wisconsin]] as a replica of the [[Liberty Bell]] in 1862. In 1910, while it was being moved across the frozen [[Geneva Lake]] following a fire at the church, the ice cracked and the bell sank to the bottom of the lake. It was resurfaced in 1960 and the village of Mount Morris acquired it in 1966. The Illinois Freedom Bell is rung during the annual Let Freedom Ring festival, and it can be found beneath a [[gazebo]] on the village square. The bell has been credited with starting an [[Fourth of July|Independence Day]] bell-ringing tradition across the United States. The bell was designated the official Illinois Freedom Bell in 1971.

===Origin===

The Illinois Freedom Bell is located in [[Mount Morris, Illinois]], and was cast as a replica of the Liberty Bell in [[1862]].<ref name="Illinois Bell">[http://www.letfreedomringfestival.com/Bell.htm Illinois Official Freedom Bell] Retrieved on [[September 3]], [[2007]]</ref><ref name="Freedom Bell" /> Following its casting, the bell was transported to [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin|Lake Geneva]], [[Wisconsin]], where it was kept in the [[bell tower|belfry]] of a church along the north shore of [[Geneva Lake]].<ref name="Illinois Bell" /><ref name="Freedom Bell" /> In [[1910]], the church was destroyed by a fire; the bell fell during the fire but was undamaged, following the fire the bell was put into storage.<ref name="Illinois Bell" /><ref name="Freedom Bell">Beetler, Dianne L. "The Freedom Bell", ''Illinois Magazine'', Vol. 30, No. 4, July-August, 1991, p. 15</ref>  The church members then decided to reconstruct the church on the south side of the lake.<ref name="Freedom Bell" /> During the winter a group of men attempted to drag the bell across the frozen lake, the weight from the bell cracked the ice and it sank to the bottom.<ref name="Illinois Bell" />

The bell remained submerged for over 40 years before a wealthy resident of Lake Geneva decided to surface the bell in 1960.<ref name="Illinois Bell" /><ref name="Freedom Bell" /> The resident located the bell, and surfaced it with great difficulty, intent on making the future Illinois Freedom Bell the focal point of his new home.<ref name="Illinois Bell" /><ref name="Freedom Bell" /><ref name="104 Years" /> After the bell was salvaged he decided it did not suit his purposes.<ref name="Freedom Bell" /> A young farmer from [[Johnsburg, Illinois|Johnsburg]] purchased the bell, and it was again kept in storage.<ref name="Freedom Bell" /><ref name="104 Years">Anonymous "Village Freedom Bell Has 104-year History", ''Mount Morris Index'', No. 2, Thursday, March 10, 1966, p. 1</ref>

In 1966, an article was published about the bell's submersion and resurfacing at Geneva Lake.<ref name="Illinois Bell" /> The article interested the people of Mount Morris, Illinois, and they sent 12 members of their Fourth of July Committee to investigate the bell in Johnsburg.<ref name="Illinois Bell" /><ref name="104 Years" /> <ref name=note1>Mount Morris' interest in the bell stemmed from the village becoming the first community in Illinois to reinstate bell ringing on [[Independence Day]]. See "Illinois Official Freedom Bell"</ref> The people of Mount Morris decided to purchase the bell; a committee was formed and obtained a loan from the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|Mount Morris VFW]]. The group also collected donations from local residents to purchase the bell for [[United States dollar|US$]]500.<ref name="Illinois Bell" /><ref name="Freedom Bell" /> By [[July 4]], [[1966]], the Illinois Freedom Bell hung from the gazebo in its current location, and the two writers who first suggested bell ringing as an annual [[Fourth of July|Independence Day]] ceremony, [[Eric Hatch]] and [[Eric Sloane]] were on hand for its dedication.<ref name="Freedom Bell" />

Five years later, in 1971, the bell was designated the Official Freedom Bell of the State of Illinois by [[Governor of Illinois|Illinois Governor]] [[Richard B. Ogilvie]].<ref name="Illinois Bell" /><ref name="Mount Morris">[http://www.mynewhouse.net/mount_morris/html/mount_morris.html Mount Morris, Illinois] Retrieved on [[September 3]], [[2007]]</ref> A plaque was added to the tower on [[July 4]], [[1972]] with an inscription from Governor Ogilvie that reads:

{{cquote|On this occasion of the first official ringing of the Freedom Bell at Mount Morris, let this message be heard by all Americans: "Let us be one nation dedicated as never before to the realization of the promise of freedom for all."}}

===Festival===

On [[February 17]], [[1963]], an issue of ''[[This Week]]'' contained an article, "Make Freedom Really Ring", written by two [[Connecticut]] writers, Eric Hatch and Eric Sloane.<ref name="Freedom Bell" /> In the article, they suggested that every [[July 4]], all bells in the country ring for four minutes, and radio stations broadcast the ringing for two minutes.<ref name="Freedom Bell" /> Readers across the country took the advice of the magazine's editor, and contacted local officials in support of a nationwide bell-ringing observance.<ref name="Freedom Bell" /> Concurrently, a resolution was proposed in [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] by [[List of United States Senators from Connecticut|Connecticut Senator]] [[Abraham Ribicoff]] that called for the ringing of bells nationwide at 2 p.m every [[July 4]]. [[Eastern Daylight Time]].<ref name="Freedom Bell" /> The bill passed both the [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] and [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] later that year.<ref name="Freedom Bell" />

Meanwhile, the village of Mount Morris had already decided to hold their own bell-ringing during the village's annual Independence Day festival, the "Let Freedom Ring".<ref name="Freedom Bell" /> Subsequently, on [[April 30]], [[1963]] Illinois native and rising [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political star [[Ronald Reagan]] visited Mount Morris to dedicate the first Mount Morris freedom bell, which now hangs at the Veterans' Memorial Fountain.<ref name="Illinois Bell" /><ref name="Official">[http://www.bwcvb.com/component/option,com_mtree/task,contact/link_id,562/Itemid,26/ Official Illinois Freedom Bell] Retrieved on [[September 3]], [[2007]]</ref> The first freedom bell was a small 16 [[inch]] (40.6 [[centimeter|cm]]) bell.<ref name="Freedom Bell" /> Later, as U.S. President in 1984, Reagan was presented with a replica of the official Illinois Freedom Bell in the Oval Office by U.S. Representative [[Lynn Martin]].<ref name=library>[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/audiovisual/whtv1984.html White House Television Office (WHTV) videotape collection, 1984], ''Ronald Reagan Presidential Library'', official site.

The Illinois Freedom Bell is annually rung in unison, at 1 pm [[Central Daylight Time (North America)|CDT]] (6 pm [[UTC]]) on the Independence Day, [[July 4]], with other bells across the United States.<ref name=yule>Pensoneau, Liz.
