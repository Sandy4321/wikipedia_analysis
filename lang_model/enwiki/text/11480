'''Saffron''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|s|<U+00E6>|f|r|<U+0252>|n}}) is a spice derived from the flower of ''Crocus sativus'', commonly known as the '''saffron crocus'''. ''[[Crocus]]'' is a genus in the family [[Iridaceae]]. Each saffron crocus grows to {{Convert|20|&ndash;|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and bears up to four flowers, each with three vivid crimson [[stigma (botany)|stigma]]s, which are each the distal end of a [[carpel]].{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Together with the [[style (botany)|style]]s, or stalks that connect the stigmas to their host plant, the dried stigmas are used mainly in various cuisines as a seasoning and colouring agent. Saffron, long among the world's most costly spices by weight,{{Sfn|Rau|1969|p=53}}{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=272}} is native to Southwest Asia{{Sfn|Grigg|1974|p=287}}{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=272}} and was first cultivated in Greece.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}} As a genetically monomorphic clone,{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L<U+00F3>pez|G<U+00F3>mez-G<U+00F3>mez|Ahrazem|2009}} it was slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia and was later brought to parts of North Africa, North America, and Oceania. 

The saffron crocus, unknown in the wild, likely descends from ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'', which originated in Crete or Central Asia;{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L<U+00F3>pez|G<U+00F3>mez-G<U+00F3>mez|Ahrazem|2009}} ''C. thomasii'' and ''C. pallasii'' are other possible precursors.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=28}}{{Sfn|Caiola|2003|p=1}} The saffron crocus is a [[polyploid|triploid]] that is "self-incompatible" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant meiosis and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction&mdash;all propagation is by vegetative multiplication via manual "divide-and-set" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=30&ndash;31}}{{Sfn|Caiola|2003|p=1}} If ''C. sativus'' is a mutant form of ''C. cartwrightianus'', then it may have emerged via [[plant breeding]], which would have selected for elongated stigmas, in late Bronze-Age Crete.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=1}}  

Saffron's bitter taste and [[iodoform]]- or hay-like fragrance result from the chemicals [[picrocrocin]] and [[safranal]].{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=423}}{{Sfn|Katzer|2001}} It also contains a [[carotenoid]] dye, [[crocin]], which imparts a rich [[saffron (color)|golden-yellow hue]] to dishes and textiles. [[History of saffron|Its recorded history]] is attested in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical treatise compiled under [[Ashurbanipal]],{{Sfn|Russo|Dreher|Mathre|2003|p=6}} and it has been [[Trade and use of saffron|traded and used]] for over four millennia. Iran now accounts for the lion's share, or around 90%, of world production.{{Sfn|Ghorbani|2008|p=1}} Research into its many possible medicinal benefits, ranging from cancer suppression to mood improvement and appetite reduction, is ongoing.

The domesticated saffron crocus, ''Crocus sativus'', is an autumn-[[flowering plant|flowering]] [[perennial plant]] unknown in the wild. It is often mistaken for the more plentiful common autumn crocus, ''[[Colchicum autumnale]]'', which is also known as "meadow saffron" or "naked lady", causing deaths due to mistaken identity,<!--VERIFY.--> though in high dosages saffron is also poisonous. It is a sterile [[polyploidy|triploid]] form, possibly of the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]''{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Caiola|2003|p=1}}, which is also known as "wild saffron"{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=24}} and originated in Central Asia.{{Sfn|Katzer|2001}} "Triploid" means that three homologous sets of [[chromosome]]s compose each specimen's genetic complement; ''C. sativus'' bears eight chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} The saffron crocus likely resulted when ''C. cartwrightianus'' was subjected to extensive [[artificial selection]] by growers seeking longer stigmas. ''C. thomasii'' and ''C. pallasii'' are other possible sources.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=28}}{{Sfn|Caiola|2003|p=1}} Being sterile, the purple flowers of ''Crocus sativus'' fail to produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on human assistance: [[corm]]s, underground bulb-like starch-storing organs, must be dug up, broken apart, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing via this vegetative division up to ten "cormlets" that can grow into new plants in the next season.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}} The compact corms are small brown globules that can measure as large as {{Convert|5|cm|in}} in diameter, have a flat base, and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibers; this coat is referred to as the "corm tunic". Corms also bear vertical fibers, thin and net-like, that grow up to 5&nbsp;cm above the plant's neck.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}

{{Multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|width=100|image1=Crocus sativus sahuran.jpg|image2=Crocus sativus1.jpg<!--|image3=Crocus sativus2.jpg|alt3=Two lilac-violet flowers appear among a clump of thin, blade-like vertical leaves. Various small weeds and other plants grow from black soil and are shown in overcast daylight.-->|caption2=<center>''C. sativus.''</center>}}

The plant grows to a height of {{Convert|20|&ndash;|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, and sprouts 5&ndash;11 white and non-[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] leafs known as [[cataphyll]]s. They are membrane-like structures that cover and protect the crocus's 5&ndash;11 true leaves as they bud and develop. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are 1&ndash;3&nbsp;mm in diameter, either expand after the flowers have opened ("hysteranthous") or do so simultaneously with their blooming ("synanthous"). ''C. sativus'' cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigation relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear [[bract]]eoles, or specialised leaves that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as [[pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]s.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} After [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivating]] in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} in length. In autumn, purple buds appear. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=3}} Upon flowering, plants average less than {{Convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} in height.{{Sfn|Government of Tasmania|2005}} A three-pronged style emerges from each flower. Each prong terminates with a vivid crimson stigma {{Convert|25|&ndash;|30|mm|abbr=on}} in length.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}

===Cultivation===
''Crocus sativus'' thrives in the Mediterranean [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], an ecotype superficially resembling the North American [[chaparral]], and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi-arid lands. It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating  frosts as low as {{Convert|&minus;10|C|0}} and short periods of snow cover.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=2&ndash;3}} Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as Kashmir, where annual rainfall averages{{Convert|1000|&ndash;|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}}; saffron-growing regions in Greece ({{Convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} annually) and Spain ({{Convert|400|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather ''during'' flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops,{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=2}} and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. [[Nematode]]s, leaf [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], and corm rot pose other threats. Yet ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.{{Sfn|Sharaf-Eldin et al.|2008}}

}}

The plants fare poorly in shady conditions; they grow best in full sunlight. Fields that slope towards the sunlight are optimal (i.e., south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere). Planting is mostly done in June in the Northern Hemisphere, where corms are lodged {{Convert|7|&ndash;|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep; its roots, stems, and leaves can develop between October and February.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Planting depth and corm spacing, in concert with climate, are critical factors in determining yields. Mother corms planted deeper yield higher-quality saffron, though form fewer flower buds and daughter corms. Italian growers optimise thread yield by planting {{Convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep and in rows {{Convert|2|&ndash;|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} apart; depths of {{Convert|8|&ndash;|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} optimises flower and corm production. Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers employ distinct depths and spacings that suit their locales.

''C. sativus'' prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-[[calcareous]] soils with high organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was historically boosted via application of some 20&ndash;30&nbsp;tonnes of manure per hectare. Afterwards, and with no further manure application, corms were planted.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do they flower. Harvests are by necessity a speedy affair: after blossoming at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=3&ndash;4}} All plants bloom within a window of one or two weeks.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=4}} Roughly 150 flowers together yield but {{Convert|1|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dry saffron threads; to produce {{Convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dried saffron (or {{Convert|72|g|oz|abbr=on}} moist and freshly harvested), {{Convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of flowers are needed; {{Convert|1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} yields {{Convert|0.2|oz|g|abbr=on}} of dried saffron. One freshly picked flower yields an average {{Convert|30|mg|oz|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron or {{Convert|7|mg|oz|abbr=on}} dried.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}}

Saffron contains more than 150 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds. It also has many nonvolatile active components,{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} many of which are carotenoids, including [[zeaxanthin]], [[lycopene]], and various <U+03B1>- and <U+03B2>-[[carotene]]s. However, saffron's golden yellow-orange colour is primarily the result of <U+03B1>-crocin. This crocin is trans-[[crocetin]] di-(<U+03B2>-D-[[gentiobiose|gentiobiosyl]]) [[ester]]; it bears the [[IUPAC nomenclature|systematic (IUPAC) name]] 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid. This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocins themselves are a series of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] carotenoids that are either [[glycosyl|monoglycosyl]] or diglycosyl [[polyene]] esters of crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocetin is a [[conjugated system|conjugated]] polyene [[carboxylic acid|dicarboxylic acid]] that is [[hydrophile|hydrophobic]], and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is [[esterification|esterified]] with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are [[carbohydrate|sugars]], a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant <U+03B1>-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may comprise more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make <U+03B1>-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}}

]]

The bitter [[glucoside]] picrocrocin is responsible for saffron's flavour. Picrocrocin ([[chemical formula]]: {{Chem|C|16|H|26|O|7}}; systematic name: 4-(<U+03B2>-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6- trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an [[aldehyde]] sub-element known as safranal (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] that is produced via [[redox|oxidative]] cleavage, and is the [[glycoside]] of the [[terpene]] [[aldehyde]] safranal. The reddish-coloured zeaxanthin is, incidentally, one of the carotenoids naturally present within the [[retina]] of the human eye.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}}

When saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield [[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]&ndash;[[glucose]] and a free safranal molecule.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}} Safranal, a [[essential oil|volatile]] oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=423}}{{Sfn|Dharmananda|2005}} Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}} A second element underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, the scent of which has been described as "saffron, dried hay like".{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Chemists found this to be the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance despite its being present in a lesser quantity than safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating [[pH]] levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and [[redox|oxidizing]] agents. It must therefore be stored away in air-tight containers in order to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.

===Grades===
[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Red threads and yellow styles.]]

Saffron is graded via laboratory measurement of crocin (colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance) content.{{Sfn|Verma|Middha|2010|p=1&ndash;2}} Determination of non-stigma content ("floral waste content") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material ("[[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]") are also key. Grading standards are set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes four empirical colour intensity grades: IV (poorest), III, II, and I (finest quality). Samples are assigned grades by gauging the spice's crocin content, revealed by measurements of crocin-specific spectroscopic [[absorbance]]. Absorbance is defined as <math>A_\lambda=-\log(I/I_0)</math>, with <math>A_\lambda</math> as absorbance ([[Beer-Lambert law]]) and indicates degree of transparency (<math>I/I_0</math>, the ratio of light intensity exiting the sample to that of the incident light) to a given wavelength of light.

Graders measure absorbances of 440-nm light by dry saffron samples. Higher absorbances imply greater crocin concentration, and thus a greater colourative intensity. These data are measured through [[spectrophotometry]] reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. These colour grades proceed from grades with absorbances lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 190 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected most red-maroon tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive absorbance scores in excess of 250. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO scores. However, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. They prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of thread for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practiced by practised wine tasters.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=274}}

[[File:Saffron Crop.JPG|thumb|Valuable stigmas, or threads, are only tediously plucked, piled, and dried.]]

Despite such attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron adulteration&mdash;particularly among the cheapest grades&mdash;continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the ''Safranschou'' code.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=102&ndash;104}} Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like beets, pomegranate fibers, red-dyed silk fibers, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odorless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibers with viscid substances like honey or vegetable oil. However, powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with turmeric, paprika, and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabeled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, in India, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.{{Sfn|Australian Broadcasting Corporation|2003}}{{Sfn|Hussain|2005}}

===Varieties===
[[File:Crocus_sativus_01_by_Line1.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Different cultivars give rise to stigmas that vary greatly in their delectability and lustre.]]

The various saffron crocus cultivars give rise to thread types that are often regionally distributed and characteristically distinct. Varieties from Spain, including the tradenames "Spanish Superior" and "Creme", are generally mellower in colour, flavour, and aroma; they are graded by government-imposed standards. Italian varieties are slightly more potent than Spanish; the most intense varieties tend to be Iranian. Various "boutique" crops are available from New Zealand, France, Switzerland, England, the United States, and other countries, some of them organically grown. In the U.S., Pennsylvania Dutch saffron&mdash;known for its "earthy" notes&mdash;is marketed in small quantities.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=143}}{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=201}}

Consumers may regard certain cultivars as "premium" quality. The "Aquila" saffron, or ''zafferano dell'Aquila'', is defined by high safranal and crocin content, distinctive thread shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour; it is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's [[Abruzzo]] region, near [[L'Aquila]]. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican monk from Inquisition-era Spain. But the biggest saffron cultivation in Italy is in [[San Gavino Monreale]], Sardinia, where it is grown on 40 hectares, representing 60% of Italian production; it too has unusully high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the "Mongra" or "Lacha" saffron of Kashmir (''Crocus sativus'' 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in the Indian-controlled areas of Kashmir combine with an Indian export ban to contribute to its prohibitive overseas prices. Kashmiri saffron is recognisable by its dark maroon-purple hue; it among the world's darkest, which hints at strong flavour, aroma, and colourative effect.<!--VERIFY.-->

The documented history of saffron cultivation spans more than three millennia.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}} The wild precursor of domesticated saffron crocus was ''Crocus cartwrightianus''. Human cultivators bred wild specimens by selecting for unusually long stigmas; thus, a sterile mutant form of ''C. cartwrightianus'', ''C. sativus'', likely emerged in late Bronze Age Crete.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=1}}

Saffron was detailed in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under [[Ashurbanipal]].{{Sfn|Russo|Dreher|Mathre|2003|p=6}} Documentation of saffron's use over the span of 4,000 years in the treatment of some 90 illnesses has been uncovered.{{Sfn|Honan|2004}} Saffron-based pigments have indeed been found in 50,000 year-old depictions of prehistoric places in northwest Iran.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=2}}{{Sfn|Humphries|1998|p=20}} The Sumerians later used wild-growing saffron in their remedies and magical potions.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=12}} Saffron was an article of long-distance trade before the Minoan palace culture's 2nd millennium BC peak. Ancient Persians cultivated Persian saffron (''Crocus sativus'' 'Hausknechtii') in Derbena, Isfahan, and Khorasan by the 10th century BC. At such sites, saffron threads were woven into textiles,{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=2}} ritually offered to divinities, and used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=17&ndash;18}} Saffron threads would thus be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Non-Persians also feared the Persians' usage of saffron as a drugging agent and aphrodisiac.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=41}} During his Asian campaigns, [[Alexander the Great]] used Persian saffron in his infusions, rice, and baths as a curative for battle wounds. Alexander's troops imitated the practice from the Persians and brought saffron-bathing to Greece.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=54&ndash;55}}

Conflicting theories explain saffron's arrival in South Asia. Kashmiri and Chinese accounts date its arrival anywhere between 900&ndash;2500 years ago.{{Sfn|Lak|1998b}}{{Sfn|Fotedar|1999|p=128}}{{Sfn|Dalby|2002|p=95}} Historians studying ancient Persian records date the arrival to sometime prior to 500 BC,{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}} attributing it to either Persian transplantation of saffron corms to stock new gardens and parks{{Sfn|Dalby|2003|p=256}} or to a Persian invasion and colonization of Kashmir. Phoenicians then marketed Kashmiri saffron as a dye and a treatment for melancholy. Its use in foods and dyes subsequently spread throughout South Asia. Buddhist monks in India adopted saffron-coloured robes after the Gautama Buddha's death. This color is now used widely in all Buddhist countries. However, the robes were not dyed with costly saffron but [[turmeric]], a less expensive dye, or [[jackfruit]].{{Sfn|Finlay|2003|p=224}} [[Gamboge]] is now used to dye the robes.{{Sfn|Hanelt|2001|p=1352}}

Some historians believe that saffron came to China with Mongol invaders from Persia.{{Sfn|Fletcher|2005|p=11}} Yet saffron is mentioned in ancient Chinese medical texts, including the forty-volume pharmacopoeia titled ''Shennong Bencaojing'' (<U+795E><U+8FB2><U+672C><U+8349><U+7D93>: "Shennong's Great Herbal", also known as ''Pen Ts'ao'' or ''Pun Tsao''), a tome dating from 200&ndash;300 BC. Traditionally credited to the fabled ''Yan'' ("Fire") Emperor (<U+708E><U+5E1D>) [[Shennong]], it discusses 252 phytochemical-based medical treatments for various disorders.{{Sfn|Hayes|2001|p=6}} Nevertheless, around the 3rd century AD, the Chinese were referring to saffron as having a Kashmiri provenance. According to Chinese herbalist Wan Zhen, "[t]he habitat of saffron is in Kashmir, where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha." Wan also reflected on how it was used in his time: "The flower withers after a few days, and then the saffron is obtained. It is valued for its uniform yellow colour. It can be used to aromatise wine."{{Sfn|Dalby|2002|p=95}}

In late [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] Egypt, [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]] used saffron in her baths so that lovemaking would be more pleasurable.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=55}} Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=34&ndash;35}} Saffron was also used as a fabric dye in such [[Levant]]ine cities as [[Sidon]] and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]].{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=59}} [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] prescribes saffron in medicines for wounds, cough, colic, and scabies, and in the [[mithridatium]].{{Sfn|Marx|1989}} Such was the Romans' love of saffron that Roman colonists took it with them when they settled in southern Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until Rome's fall. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century AD Moors or with the [[Avignon]] papacy in the 14th century AD.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=63}}

European saffron cultivation plummeted after the Roman Empire went into eclipse. As with France, the spread of Islamic civilization may have helped reintroduce the crop to Spain and Italy.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=70}} The 14th-century Black Death caused demand for saffron-based medicaments to peak, and large quantities of threads had to be imported via Venetian and Genoan ships from southern and Mediterranean lands such as Rhodes; the theft of one such shipment by noblemen sparked the fourteen-week long "Saffron War".{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=99}} The conflict and resulting fear of rampant saffron piracy spurred corm cultivation in [[Basel]]; it thereby grew prosperous.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=101}} The crop then spread to [[Nuremberg]], where endemic and insalubrious adulteration brought on the ''Safranschou'' code&mdash;whereby culprits were variously fined, imprisoned, and executed.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=103&ndash;104}} The corms soon spread throughout England, especially Norfolk and Suffolk. The Essex town of [[Saffron Walden]], named for its new specialty crop, emerged as England's prime saffron growing and trading center. However, an influx of more exotic spices&mdash;chocolate, coffee, tea, and vanilla&mdash;from newly contacted Eastern and overseas countries caused European cultivation and usage of saffron to decline.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=117}}{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=132&ndash;133}} Only in southern France, Italy, and Spain did the clone significantly endure.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=133}}

Europeans introduced saffron to the Americas when immigrant members of the [[Schwenkfelder Church]] left Europe with a trunk containing its corms; church members had widely grown it in Europe.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=143}} By 1730, the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] were cultivating saffron throughout eastern Pennsylvania. Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron, and high demand ensured that saffron's list price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=138}} The trade with the Caribbean later collapsed in the aftermath of the War of 1812, when many saffron-bearing merchant vessels were destroyed.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=138&ndash;139}} Yet the Pennsylvania Dutch continued to grow lesser amounts of saffron for local trade and use in their cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=142&ndash;146}} American saffron cultivation survived into modern times mainly in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=143}}

===Trade===
[[File:Saffron_and_other_spices_at_a_Turkish_market.jpg|thumb|left|upright|"Ispanya saffron" at market in Turkey. Note: the "India saffron" is actually turmeric.]]<!--http://www.idosi.org/wasj/wasj4%284%29/7.pdf-->

Almost all saffron grows in a belt bounded by the Mediterranean in the west and the rugged region encompassing Iran and disputed Kashmir in the east. The other continents, except Antarctica, produce smaller amounts. Some {{Convert|300|t|kg|0|abbr=on}} of dried whole threads and powder are gleaned yearly,{{Sfn|Katzer|2001}} of which {{Convert|50|t|kg|0|abbr=on}} is top-grade "coupe" saffron.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=2}} Iran answers for around 90&ndash;93% of global production and exports much of it.{{Sfn|Ghorbani|2008|p=1}} A few of Iran's drier eastern and southeastern provinces, including Fars, Kerman, and those in the Khorasan region, glean the bulk of modern global production. In 2005, the second-ranked Greece produced {{Convert|5.7|t|kg|1|abbr=on}}, while Morocco and Kashmir, tied for third rank, each produced {{Convert|2.3|t|kg|1|abbr=on}}.{{Sfn|Ghorbani|2008|p=1}} Nevertheless, Iranian crop yields and profit margins on a per-acre basis are relatively low; margins in Spain, followed by Greece and Italy, are far higher.

In recent years, Afghan cultivation has risen; in restive Kashmir it has declined.{{Sfn|Malik|2007}} Azerbaijan, Morocco, and Italy are, in decreasing order, lesser producers. Prohibitively high labour costs and abundant Iranian imports mean that only select locales continue the tedious harvest in Austria, England, Germany, and Switzerland&mdash;among them the Swiss village of Mund, whose annual output is a few kilograms.{{Sfn|Katzer|2001}}Tasmania,{{Sfn|Courtney|2002}} China, Egypt, France, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Turkey (mainly around the town of [[Safranbolu]]), California, and Central Africa are microscale cultivators.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=272}}{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}}

To glean an amount of dry saffron weighing {{Convert|1|lb|g|abbr=on}} is to harvest 50,000&ndash;75,000 flowers, the equivalent of an association football field's area of cultivation; 110,000&ndash;170,000 flowers or two football fields are needed to gross one kilogram.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=273}}{{Sfn|Rau|1969|p=35}} Forty hours of labour are needed to pick 150,000 flowers.{{Sfn|Lak|1998a}} Stigmas are dried quickly upon extraction and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=8}} Saffron prices at wholesale and retail rates range from US$500 to US$5,000 per pound, or US$1,100&ndash;11,000/kg, equivalent to <U+00A3>2,500/<U+20AC>3,500 per pound or <U+00A3>5,500/<U+20AC>7,500 per kilogram. The price in Canada recently rose to {{CAD|18,000}} per kilogram. In Western countries, the average retail price is $1,000/<U+00A3>500/<U+20AC>700 per pound, or US$2,200/<U+00A3>1,100/<U+20AC>1,550 per kilogram.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=272}} A pound comprises between 70,000 and 200,000 threads. Vivid crimson colouring, slight moistness, elasticity, and lack of broken-off thread debris are all traits of fresh saffron.

===Use===
[[File:Saffron soak.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Threads are soaked in hot&mdash;but not boiling&mdash;water for several minutes prior to use in cuisine. This helps release the beneficial components.]]

Saffron's aroma is often described by connoisseurs as reminiscent of metallic honey with grassy or hay-like notes, while its taste has also been noted as hay-like and sweet. Saffron also contributes a luminous yellow-orange colouring to foods. Saffron is widely used in European, Arab, South and Central Asian, Persian, and Turkish cuisines. Confectioneries and liquors also often include saffron. Common saffron substitutes include [[safflower]] (''Carthamus tinctorius'', which is often sold as "Portuguese saffron" or "a<U+00E7>afr<U+00E3>o"), annatto, and turmeric (''Curcuma longa''). Saffron has also been used as a fabric [[dye]], particularly in China and India, and in perfumery.{{Sfn|Dalby|2002|p=138}} It is used for religious purposes in India, and is widely used in cooking in many ethnic cuisines: these range, for example, from the Milanese ''risotto'' of Italy or the ''bouillabaise'' of France to ''biryani'' with various meat accompaniments in South Asia.<!-- Saffron is identified as "E164" under the European Union [[E number]] food additive code system.-->

Saffron has a long medicinal history as part of traditional healing; modern medicine has also discovered saffron as having [[anticarcinogen]]ic (cancer-suppressing), anti-mutagenic (mutation-preventing), immunomodulating, and [[antioxidant]]-like properties.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}}{{Sfn|Assimopoulou|Papageorgiou|Sinakos|2005|p=1}}{{Sfn|Chang|Kuo|Liang|Wang|1964|p=1}} Saffron stigmas, and even petals, have been said to be helpful for depression.{{Sfn|Bailes|1995}} Early studies show that saffron may protect the eyes from the direct effects of bright light and retinal stress apart from slowing down [[macular degeneration]] and [[retinitis pigmentosa]].{{Sfn|Maccarone|Di Marco|Bisti|2008}} (Most saffron-related research refers to the stigmas, but this is often not made explicit in research papers.)
