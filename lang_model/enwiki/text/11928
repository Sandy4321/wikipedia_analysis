In the USA, a '''chartered mark''' is a [[trademark]] or [[service mark]] which is given special statutory protection separate from the usual registration of trade marks and service marks.  A chartered mark, in effect, is a type of trademark/servicemark in which the organization is granted the mark "by [[charter]]", i.e. by express grant of the [[legislature]].  When an organization is granted a chartered mark, no one else may use the same mark at all for any purpose.  (There are possible exceptions for organizations using the same or a similar mark before it was chartered.)

Examples of chartered marks in the [[United States]] include '''FDIC''' for the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]; '''Boy Scouts''' and '''Girl Scouts''' for the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]], respectively; and '''Olympic''' for the [[United States Olympic Committee]].
