'''[[Kirkcaldy]]''' ({{lang-gd|'''Cathair Chaladinn'''}}) is a former [[royal burgh]] and town. Known as one of Scotland's ''"most ancient burghs"'', the area
surrounding the modern town has a long history dating as far back between 2500 BC and 500 BC as a possible funerary landscape.

The town began as a [[burgh]] under the control of [[Dunfermline Abbey]]. A harbour built around the east burn gradually led to the growth of the town surrounding the harbour itself, main street and Tiel burn following the demand of trade with the Baltic. Early industries which soon prospered included the production of textiles, [[nailmaking]] and [[salt]] panning. The [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th and 20th centuries proved to be the most famous period for the town which saw the introduction of [[linoleum]]. Originally developed in the town as floorcloth, this was quickly dominated by the Michael Nairn & Co but did not become popular across a worldwide scale until the beginning of the 20th century.

==Origin and Name==

The name Kirkcaldy means "place of the hard fort", or "place of Caled's fort". It is derived from the [[Pictish]] ''caer'' meaning "fort", ''caled'', which is Pictish "hard" or a personal name ''Caled'', and ''<U+2013>in'', a suffix meaning "place of". ''Caled'' may describe the fort itself or be an epithet for a local "hard" ruler.<ref name="Place-Names of Fife">{{cite book |title= The Place-Names of Fife, Volume One|last= Taylor|first= Simon|coauthors= M<U+00E1>rkus, Gilbert|year= 2006|publisher= Shaun Tyas|location= Donington|isbn= 1 900289 77 6|pages= 487}}</ref> An interpretation of the last element as ''din'' (again "fort" but this time from [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]) rather than ''<U+2013>in'' is incorrect.<ref name="Place-Names of Fife "/> The [[Old Statistical Account]] states a derivation from [[culdee]], which has been repeated in later publications<ref name="Torrie & Coleman p12">Torrie and Coleman 1995, p.12.</ref><ref name="History & Celebration p10">Civic Society ''Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration'', p.10.</ref> but is also incorrect.<ref name="Place-Names of Fife"/>

The earliest written form of the name, from the Charters of [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in 1128, is as the shire of ''Kircalethyn''; with subsequent forms including ''Kircaldin'', ''Kirkaladinit'', ''Kerkalethin''; and the earliest close approximation to the current name, as ''Kircaldy'', appearing in 1250.<ref name="Place-Names of Fife "/> Kirkcaldy has long been nicknamed the "''Lang Toun''" ([[Scots language|Scots]] for "long town") in reference to the (0.9&nbsp;meters later 4&nbsp;meters) main street of the early town, depicted so on maps as early as the 16th and 17th centuries.<ref>Torrie and Coleman 1995, p.15.</ref><ref name="Pride p52">Pride 1999, p.52.</ref>

The area surrounding the modern town may have been used as a funerary landscape, with discovery of eleven [[Bronze Age]] [[cist]] burials overlooking the leaning sandy bay as early as 2,500 BC and 500 BC. <ref name="Historic Kirkcaldy">{{cite book

==Early History==

One of the earliest historical events in the vicinity of the town was the [[Battle of Raith]] in 596 AD, where the [[Angles]] fought an alliance of [[Scoti|Scots]], [[Picts]] and [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] led by King [[<U+00C1>ed<U+00E1>n mac Gabr<U+00E1>in]] of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]].<ref>Civic Society ''Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration'', p.11.</ref> Towards the end of the 11th century the Scottish king [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]] purchased the [[shire]] of ''Kirkaladunt'' from the crown lords of Fife to be given to the monks of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] as a means of aiding the funding of their newly built church which saw residents pay annual revenues.<ref name="Remembered p6">Civic Society ''Kirkcaldy Remembered'' 2005, p.6.</ref><ref name="Eunson p3">Eunson ''Old Kirkcaldy: Central, North and West'' 1998, p.3.</ref><ref>Omand 2000, p.105.</ref><ref name="Bean p33">MacBean 1908, p.33.</ref>

Two charters for what became known as the "schyre of Kircalethin" and "schire of Kirkcaladinit" were devised in 1128 and 1130 by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] on behalf of his father, but the location of the town and shire was not indicated.<ref name="Torrie & Coleman p12" /><ref name="Kirkcaldy Burgh Records">MacBean L.

== Growth and development ==

Kirkcaldy, unlike most Scottish towns, had no stone wall. The town, instead relied on the sea acting as a shelter, which still could have left the town vulnerable to attack. The construction of Ravenscraig Castle lowered the risk, with the process of small walls or "heid dykes" built on rigs to the west of the High Street. The majority of the dykes contained small gates for the benefit of the town crofts and burgesses, who were responsible for their protection and maintenance. Three main gates became the focus point of the burgh, which were situated in East Port, West Port and near the Old Kirk on Kirk Wynd.<ref name="Historic Kirkcaldy" />
[[Image:Kirkcaldy Harbour Fife Scotland.JPG|thumb|left|Kirkcaldy Harbour by the 18th century]]

Kirkcaldy harbour was acknowledged for having "a sheltered [[cove]] round the East [[Burn (topography)|Burn]]", thus giving easy accessibility for boats.<ref name="Pride p51">Pride 1999, p.51.</ref> By the early 16th century the vessels of the harbour had begun to engage in trade with the [[Baltic region|Baltic]]; later dealing with the import of [[grain]] in 1618 and continental [[beer]] in 1625.<ref name="Remembered p6"/> A shipbuilding trade also existed on the site until this was phased out temporarily in 1645.<ref name="Eunson p3"/> The success led to the growth of the burgh, surrounding the harbour, Main Street and Tiel (West) burn, commented on by [[Thomas Carlyle]].<ref name="Lamont-Brown p144">Lamont-Brown 2002, p.144.</ref> During his stay he described the town as being "a mile of the smoothest sand, with one long wave coming on gently, steadily, and breaking into a gradual explosion beautifully sounding, and advancing, ran from the South to the North, from the West Burn to Kirkcaldy Harbour, a favourite scene beautiful to me still in the faraway".<ref name="Remembered p7&8">Civic Society ''Kirkcaldy Remembered'', pp.7<U+2013>8.</ref><ref name="History & Celebration p10"/><ref name="Lamont-Brown p144"/><ref name="Wemyss p1">Wemyss Environment Educational Centre 1990, p.1.</ref>

[[Image:Kirkcaldy Volunteers Green Plaque.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The plaque reads: "This is the remains of the 9 acres of common moor given to the people of this town by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1644 when Kirkcaldy was made a royal burgh...."]]

[[Royal burgh]] status was problematic with the loss of the original charter, which had been noted in the conventions of royal burghs in 1582.<ref name="Civic Society p3">Civic Society ''Kirkcaldy Remembered'' 2005, p.3.</ref> However, it is noteworthy that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] granted Kirkcaldy royal burgh status in 1644, leaving nine acres of land to the town suitable "for dying and bleaching of linen, drying of clothes, recreation and perpetuity".<ref name="History & Celebration p17">Civic Society ''Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration'', p.17.</ref>

Although difficult times ahead threatened to beset the development of the town, local support for the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Covenanting War]] (1644&ndash;65) led to the death of over 250 men.<ref name="Pearson p12">Pearson ''Around Kirkcaldy'' 1993, p.12.</ref><ref>Civic Society ''Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration'', p.18.</ref><ref name="Eunson p3"/> The burgh was also affected by the Highland [[Jacobite rebellion]] invading the town on two occasions during the 18th century on 1715 and again in 1745<U+2013>46.<ref>Civic Society ''Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration'', p.7.</ref> Later in the civil wars, during the mid&ndash;17th century, Oliver Cromwell<U+2019>s troops came to the town to seek riches and nearly destroyed the town.<ref name="Around Kirkcaldy">Pearson, John ''Around Kirkcaldy''</ref> The treasure was eventually found by Cromwell in [[Dundee]] when they were moved to from the burgh for "safe-keeping".

Afterwards, the town became a home for leather making; a brick and tile works; a spinning cotton mill and the first power spinning mill and linen factories in Fife.<ref name="The Fife Book">Omand, Donald ''The Fife Book''</ref><ref name="Eunson p3" /> The shipbuilding industry was also resurrected which, by the end of the century, had built 26 square riggers in total, one sloop and two ferries.<ref name="Eunson p3" /> Construction of a turnpike road from the Pettycur ferry to [[Cupar]] and beyond was submitted in 1790 which, while only being a piece to improve Fife<U+2019>s isolated road system, also helped to strength Kirkcaldy<U+2019>s position in Fife.<ref name="Historic Kirkcaldy" /><ref name="Eunson p4" />

== Industrial Revolution ==

As Kirkcaldy entered into the 19th century, the arrival of the [[Kirkcaldy and District Railway]], later to become part of the [[North British Railway]],<ref name=awdry>{{Awdry-RailCo}}, p. 141.</ref> saw the town develop into the industrial heart of Fife&mdash;reviving the use of Kirkcaldy port, which had a severe setback during the mid&ndash;17th century.<ref name="Omand p195">Omand 2000, p.195.</ref>
The harbour was catering for the growing trade of imports of [[flax]], timber and [[hemp]] and exports of coal, salt and [[linen]] cloth, when a decision was made to build a new wet dock and pier from 1843&ndash;46.<ref name="Omand p195"/> The subsequent demands for [[linoleum]] and coal led to a further extension from 1906&ndash;08 in the form of an inner dock.<ref name="Pride p51"/><ref name="Eunson p6">Eunson ''Old Kirkcaldy: Central, North and West'' 1998, p.6.</ref>

[[Image:Former canvas factory.JPG|thumb|left|180px|the remains of the St Mary's [[Canvas]] factory of Michael Nairn & Co Ltd]]

Kirkcaldy became a centre for iron founding and linen manufacturing&mdash;specialising in coarser material (i.e. [[sailcloth]]).<ref>Civic Society ''Kirkcaldy Remembered'', p.89.</ref><ref>Omand 2000, p.189.</ref> Although when the market for sail cloth started to dip, Michael [[Nairn]] for instance began to focus more towards floorcloth, which he started to produce in his new purpose built Scottish floorboard factory at [[Pathhead]] Sands, famously nicknamed "Nairn<U+2019>s folly" for what would become universally known as linoleum.<ref name="Kirkcaldy Remembered" /><ref name="Fife in History and Legend" /><ref name="Pride p51" /><ref name="Kirkcaldy's Famous Folk 3, 1st edition">{{cite book

The burghs of [[Pathhead]], [[Linktown]], Gallatown and Sinclairtown were also officially merged into the royal burgh of Kirkcaldy in 1876.<ref name="History & Celebration p10"/><ref name="Eunson p4">Eunson ''Old Kirkcaldy: Central, North and West'' 1999, p.4. </ref><ref name="Bean p60">MacBean 1908, p.60.</ref> The town had a population of nearly 30,000 by the time of the census in 1891.

By the middle of the 20th century, the production of both pottery and salt drew to a close. Around this time, also saw the development of the esplanade (from an unemployment scheme); the first council houses and the merging of Dysart into Kirkcaldy under an act of parliament in 1930. <ref name="Old Kirkcaldy: Central, North and West" /><ref name="Kirkcaldy Remembered" /><ref name="Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration" /><ref name="High Street: Port Brae to Nicol Street, 7th edition" >{{cite book

Further expansions of the town were to the north-west on B-class farm land (Hayfield, Boreland, Pathhead Muir, Dunnikier, Templehall, Mitchleson and Chapel) between 1930 and 1950. <ref name="Development of Kirkcaldy p7">Kirkcaldy Burgh Council ''Royal Burgh of Kirkcaldy: Development Plan'', 1952, p.7.</ref> According to the 1951 census, this brought the population of the town up to nearly 50,000.

== Post-War development ==
[[Image:Dunnikier Estate, Kirkcaldy.JPG|thumb|left|Dunnikier Estate <U+2013> an example of a post-war housing development]] 

A housing crisis arose in the town at the end of the Second World War.<ref name="Eunson p4" /> New residential and private housing estates to the north-west, multi-storey flats and the redevelopment of areas such as Sinclairtown and Linktown occurred between the 1950s and 1960s. <ref name="Development of Kirkcaldy" /> Several primary schools such as Valley, Fair Isle, Dunearn and Torbain were also built to serve these new estates (with Capshard being a latter addition in the early 1970s). Provision was given to new junior secondaries (Templehall and Balwearie); a new Catholic secondary (St Andrews) and the re-location of Kirkcaldy High School to Pathhead muir. <ref name="Glen p116">{{Glen, Duncan ''A new illustrated history of Kirkcaldy from pre-history to 2007'' p.116.</ref><ref name="Development of Kirkcaldy">Kirkcaldy Burgh Council ''Royal Burgh of Kirkcaldy: Development Plan''</ref> During the middle of the 1950s, construction began of a new hospital - on the site of the Fever hospital and [[sanatorium]] - to replace the cramped facilities of the cottage hospital situated to the east of the town.<ref name="Old Dysart and East Kirkcaldy">Eunson, Eric ''Old Dysart and East Kirkcaldy''</ref><ref name="Kirkcaldy's history">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/CustomPages/CustomPage.aspx?PageID=17700 |title=Kirkcaldy's history, Fife Free Press}} Retrieved on [[22 June]] [[2008]] </ref><ref name="SEPA">{{cite web |url=http://www.sepa.org.uk/pdf/wastemin/initiatives/east/reap/case_studies/fife_acute_hospitals.pdf |format=PDF|title=Fife Acute Hospital Trust}} Retrieved on [[23 June]] [[2008]] </ref> The late 1950s saw a new bus station open on a site north of the town centre to relieve the existing one on The Promenade (which continued to deal only with country routes until this was phased out in 1980).<ref name="Kingdom still expanding">Kingdom's Hub Still Expanding, ''The Fife Free Press'', Oct 9 1959</ref> There was speculation that the town could grow around the 55,000 to 60,000 mark by 1970. <ref name="Development of Kirkcaldy" /> This never materialised when the decline of linoleum in the mid-1960s - with the closure of the linoleum firm, Barry, Ostlere and Shepherd, shocking the town in particular - saw the population of the town fall.<ref name="Kirkcaldy Remembered" /> To try to combat this, deep mining was commissioned at Seafield in 1954 by the National Coal Board to help reduce the impact of job losses, it later closed in 1988, after a tug of war between the National Union of Mineworkers and the Conservative Government.<ref name="Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration" /><ref name="Old Kirkcaldy: Central, North and West">Eunson, Eric ''Old Kirkcaldy: Central, North and West''</ref><ref name="Kirkcaldy's history" /> Kirkcaldy harbour, which had once been vital to the town<U+2019>s well being, suffered its own fate when it was closed permanently in 1992 to main traffic.<ref name="Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration" />

== Today ==

There are still links to distinguish Kirkcaldy's former past. For example, a reference to the aura of the linseed oil&mdash;which produced a "queer&ndash;like smell"&mdash;used to make linoleum, is acknowledged in the poem, "boy on a train" by MC Smith.<ref name="Fife in History and Legend" /><ref name="Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration" /><ref name="Town Centre Walkabout">{{cite book
