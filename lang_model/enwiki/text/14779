'''Eric Ashton''' [[Member of the British Empire|MBE]] (born [[1935]] in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens, Lancashire]], [[England]]) was an [[England|English]] [[rugby league]] footballer.  He played his whole first grade football career for the [[Wigan Warriors]] along with at times both captaining and coaching them; his position of choice was right centre. Over the span of his career he came to be known as one of the best centres in the modern game and formed a devastating partnership with [[Billy Boston]] somewhat because of this combination he went on to represent the [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] national side making his debut in [[1957]]. After his retirement from league in [[1969]], Ashton went on to coach Wigan as well as [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]], [[St Helens RLFC|St Helens]] and [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]]; he also had a brief stint as chairman of St Helens in 1996. He currently sits on the St Helens board as he has done so for the past fifteen years.

==Childhood and early career==
Born and raised in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens, Lancashire]], Ashton began playing rugby league at an early age and it wasn't long before his talent became noticeable; he was signed to the [[St Helens RLFC|St Helens]] schoolboys side before joining the [[Army]] not long after. In [[1954]] Ashton was spotted playing rugby league for the [[National Service]] and was subsequently invited for a trial with rival club [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]. He attended the trial and was seen by the directors of the club as being a player with exceptional talent, after Wigan offered him a spot in their top level side Ashton offered his home club the chance to sign him but they passed and he then signed for Wigan in [[1955]] for <U+00A3>150.

==Wigan==
After signing for Wigan he quickly linked up with [[Wales national rugby league team|Welsh]] right winger [[Billy Boston]] and formed one of the most devastating right-wing-three-quarter partnerships of modern times. Such was the impact of both Ashton and Boston it led to Ashton being promoted as [[captain]]e of the Wigan side after just two years at the club at the tender age of 22. It was a position he would go onto hold for the next twelve years.

Ashton's honours and achievements are nothing short of impressive, with 3 victorious [[Wembley]] [[Rugby League Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]] finals (out of a possible six), a [[Super League (Europe)|Rugby League Championship]] in [[1966]], a Lancashire Challenge Cup and two Lancashire League Championships as well as a BBC Floodlit trophy.

Ashton was a true professional in every sense, being sent off just twice in his whole career and due to his professionalism, talent and intelligence he would go on to achieve a long and distinguished footballing career.

==Great Britain==
Ashton made his international debut at the age of twenty-two for the [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] side against [[France national rugby league team|France]] in [[1957]].

He would go on to collect a total of twenty six caps for the [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] side with his first [[Southern hemisphere]] tour coming in [[1957]] as the British side competed in the [[1957 Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]]. He would become somewhat [[immortal]]ised as one of the players involved in the all-conquering British side of [[1960]], captaining [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] to victory over the [[Australia national rugby league team|Australians]] on several occasions.

It's usually said that Ashton's greatest moment could have come in an [[1962]] tour to [[Australia]] when while captaining Great Britain to an almost complete whitewash over the Australians a last minute refereeing decision ruined the chance of this occurring. In total Ashton captained the [[Great Britain national rugby league team|British]] side fifteen times.
