Kobayashi was born in 1943. Her mother was a musician and her father was a physicist. Kobayashi graduated with a B.Sc from the [[University of Tokyo]], Department of Chemistry in 1967 and earmed her Ph.D. at the University of Tokyo in 1972.<ref name=nihon-u>{{cite web|title=Staff|url=http://www.chs.nihon-u.ac.jp/chem_dpt/koba1.html|publisher=Department of Chemistry, College of Humanities and Sciences, Nihon University|accessdate=8 March 2014|language=Japanese}}</ref>  Staying at the university, she became a research associate (1972), associate professor (1993), and full professor (1999).<ref name=nihon-u /> In 2006, Kobayashi became a [[Professor emeritus]] at the University of Tokyo and accepted a position at [[Nihon University]].

She was a 2009 [[L'Or<U+00E9>al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]] laureate,<ref name=forgirlsinscience>{{cite web|title=Akiko Kobayashi (b. 1943)|url=http://forgirlsinscience.org/women-in-stem/akiko-kobayashi/|work=L'Or<U+00E9>al|publisher=For Girls in Science|accessdate=8 March 2014}}</ref> "for her contribution to the development of molecular conductors and the design and synthesis of a single-component organic metal".<ref name=UNESCO>{{cite web|title=2009 L'Or<U+00E9>al-UNESCO Award
