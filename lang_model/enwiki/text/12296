'''St. Anastasia Island''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: <U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432> <U+0441><U+0432>. <U+0410><U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+0441><U+0438><U+044F>, ''ostrov Sv. Anastasiya'', formerly called ''Bolshevik Island'', <U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432> <U+0411><U+043E><U+043B><U+0448><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+043A>) is a [[Bulgaria]]n [[islet]] in the [[Black Sea]]. It is located 1.5 km off the coast near [[Chernomorets]] and embraces a territory of 0.022 km<U+00B2>. It is the only inhabited island off the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]].

The island is supplied with electricity and drinking water. It is named after the former St. Anastasia convent located on it, which is abandoned since [[1923]], when the island was transformed into a prison.

In [[1925]], a group of 43 political prisoners ([[communist]]s and [[anti-fascist]]s), led by [[Teohar Bakardzhiev]], revolted and escaped from the island, subsequently fleeing to the [[Soviet Union]]. In their honor, the island was renamed Bolshevik Island when the communists came into power in [[1945]]. Bulgarian film director [[Rangel Valchanov]] based his [[1958]] film ''"On The Small Island"'' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: ''"<U+041D><U+0430> <U+043C><U+0430><U+043B><U+043A><U+0438><U+044F> <U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432>"'') on this event.

Today, there is a [[lighthouse]] situated on the island, as well as a [[pub]], a small [[quay]] and several buildings to accommodate [[tourist]]s.

A Bulgarian [[Bourgas]]-based weekly newspaper, Factor, reported in 2006 that the [[MRF]] leader, Mr. [[Ahmed Dogan]], visited the island and expressed desire to privatize it. The [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], however, which claims the island is its property, would hear none of this [http://www.factor-bs.com/index.php?go=news&article=57].
