Her Imperial Highness '''Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia''' ('''''Anastasia Nikolaievna Romanova''''', (in [[Russian language|Russian]]: <U+0412><U+0435><U+043B><U+0438><U+043A><U+0430><U+044F> <U+041A><U+043D><U+044F><U+0436><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0410><U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+0441><U+0438><U+044F> <U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430><U+0435><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0420><U+043E><U+043C><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430>, ''Velikaya Knyazhna Anastasiya Nikolaievna Romanova''), ([[June 5]] (O.S.)/[[June 18]] (N.S.) [[1901]] <U+2014> [[Death in absentia|presumably]] [[July 17]], [[1918]]), was the youngest daughter of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and [[Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse|Empress Alexandra]], the last autocratic rulers of [[Imperial Russia]].

Anastasia was a younger sister of [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga]], [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Tatiana]] and [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Maria]], and was an elder sister of the [[haemophiliac]] [[Tsarevich Alexei of Russia|Alexei Nikolaievitch, Tsarevitch of Russia]]. She is presumed to have been murdered with her family on July 17, 1918, by forces of the [[Bolshevik]] secret police. However, rumors have persisted of her possible escape since 1918.

Several women have claimed to have been Anastasia; the most famous of whom was [[Anna Anderson]]. Anderson's body was cremated upon her death in 1984. Despite support for her claim from several people who knew Anastasia, DNA testing in 1994 on pieces of Anderson's tissue and hair seemed to prove that Anderson was not the Grand Duchess. <ref>Robert K.

== Life and Childhood ==

[[Image:Cap135.JPG|left|thumb|180px|<center>Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaievna Romanova]] When Anastasia was born, her parents and extended family were disappointed to have a fourth daughter instead of the greatly desired male heir to the throne. Tsar Nicholas II went for a long walk to compose himself before going to visit Tsarina Alexandra and the infant Anastasia for the first time.<ref>Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra,'' 1967, p. 153.</ref> One meaning of her name is "the breaker of chains" or "the prison opener." The fourth grand duchess received her name because, in honor of her birth, her father pardoned and reinstated students who had been imprisoned for participating in riots in St. Petersburg and Moscow the previous winter. <ref name="Eagar"> {{cite web | author=Eagar, Margaret | year=1906| title= "Six Years at the Russian Court" | work= alexanderpalace.org|url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/eagar/eagar.html/ |accessdate = December 11| access year=2006}}</ref> Another meaning of the name is "of the resurrection," a fact often alluded to later in stories about her rumored survival. Anastasia's title is most precisely translated as "Grand Princess," meaning that Anastasia, as an "imperial highness" was higher in rank than other princesses in Europe who were "royal highnesses." "Grand Duchess" became the most widely used translation of the title into English from Russian. <ref>Zeepvat, Charlotte, ''The Camera and the Tsars: A Romanov Family Album,'' Sutton Publishing, 2004, p. xiv</ref> The tsar's children were raised as simply as possible. They slept on hard camp cots without pillows, except when they were ill, took cold baths in the morning, and were expected to tidy their rooms and do needlework to be sold at various charity events when they were not otherwise occupied. Most in the household, including the servants, generally called the grand duchess by her first name and [[patronym]], Anastasia Nikolaevna, and did not use her title or "her imperial highness." She was also occasionally called by the French version of her name, "Anastasie," or by the Russian nicknames "Nastya," "Nastas," or "Nastenka." Other family nicknames for Anastasia were "Malenkaya," or "the little one," <ref>Kurth, Peter, ''Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson,'' Back Bay Books, 1983, p. 309</ref> or "schwibzik," meaning "imp."

Living up to her nicknames, young Anastasia grew into a vivacious and energetic child, described as short and inclined to be chubby, with blue eyes <ref>Massie, Robert K., Nicholas and Alexandria, 1967, p. 134</ref> and reddish- <ref>Greg King and Penny Wilson, ''The Fate of Romanovs,'' John Wiley and Sons Inc., 2003, p. 50</ref>blonde hair. <ref name="Vyrubova">{{cite web | author=Vyrubova, Anna | year= | title= "Memories of the Russian Court" | work= alexanderpalace.org| url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/russiancourt2006/ | accessdate= December 13| accessyear=2006}}</ref> Margaret Eagar, a governess to the four Grand Duchesses, said one person commented that the toddler Anastasia had the greatest personal charm of any child he had ever seen. <ref name="Eagar">Eagar, Margaret, "Six Years at the Russian Court"</ref> While often described as gifted and bright, she was never interested in the restrictions of the school room, according to her tutors [[Pierre Gilliard]] and [[Charles Sydney Gibbes|Sydney Gibbes]].

"(She) was very roguish and almost a wag," recalled her French tutor, Gilliard, in his memoirs. "She had a very strong sense of humour, and the darts of her wit often found sensitive spots ... She was also extremely idle, though with the idleness of a gifted child ... She was so lively and her gaiety so infectious ..." <ref name="Gilliard">{{cite web | author=Gilliard, Pierre | year= | title= "Thirteen Years at the Russian Court" | work= alexanderpalace.org| url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/pierre2006/ | accessdate= December 13| accessyear=2006}}</ref> Tatiana Botkina, the daughter of the family physician Yevgeny Botkin, remembered Anastasia as "lively, rough, mischievous, a real [[tomboy]]," <ref>Peter Kurth, ''Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson,'' 1983, p. 240.</ref> while Lilli Dehn, a friend of the Tsarina, recalled Anastasia's sense of humor and her acting ability. "She was a very clever mimic," wrote Dehn. "... She was very fond of acting; indeed, Anastasie would have made an excellent comedy actress."<ref name="Dehn"> {{cite web | author=Dehn, Lilli | year=1922| title= "The Real Tsaritsa" | work= alexanderpalace.org|url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/realtsaritsa/ |accessdate = December 13| access year=2006}}</ref> On the other hand, Anna Vyrubova, another friend of Tsarina Alexandra, wrote that not everyone enjoyed Anastasia's well-developed sense of humor. (She was) "a sharp and clever child ... (and) a very monkey for jokes, some of them at times almost too practical for the enjoyment of others," wrote Vyrubova. <ref name="Vyrubova">Vyrubova, Anna, "Memories of the Russian Court</ref>

Anastasia's daring occasionally exceeded the limits of acceptable behavior..[[Image:Anastasia&Olga.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, left, with Grand Duchess Anastasia]] "She undoubtedly held the record for punishable deeds in her family, for in naughtiness she was a true genius," said Gleb Botkin, brother of Tatiana Botkina. <ref>Greg King and Penny Wilson, ''The Fate of the Romanovs,'' 2003, p. 250.</ref> Anastasia sometimes tripped the servants and played pranks on her tutors. As a child, she sometimes climbed trees and refused to come down. Once, during a snowball fight at the family's Polish estate, Anastasia rolled a rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister Tatiana, knocking her to the ground. <ref name="Vyrubova">Vyrubova, Anna, "Memories of the Russian Court"</ref> A distant cousin, Princess Nina Georgievna, recalled that "Anastasia was nasty to the point of being evil," and cheated, kicked and scratched her playmates during games. She was affronted because the younger Nina was taller than she was. <ref>King and Wilson, p. 50</ref>

Hallie Erminie Rives, a best-selling author and the wife of American diplomat Post Wheeler, encountered the ten-year-old Anastasia during the annual Military Concert at the St. Petersburg Opera House in 1911. Anastasia, seated in the imperial box opposite Rives and her husband, was eating chocolates without having removed her white gloves, which were smudged with the candy. "She was not a beautiful child, but there was something frank and winning about her," Rives wrote. "Her hair was drawn back in a one-sided whorl, perhaps to hide a small scar whose edge I fancied I saw under its dark loop." Anastasia offered Rives a chocolate from her box, which was wrapped in silver wrapping paper. She hummed along to the tune played by the orchestra, a song she told Rives was about a little girl who had lost her doll. <ref>James Blair Lovell, ''Anastasia: The Lost Princess,'' 1991, pgs. 35-36</ref>

[[Image:anaolgaatatia1914.jpg|left|thumb|340px|Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia (left), Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna (center), and Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia (right); at a Russian beach, 1914]] Anastasia and her older sister Maria were known within the family as "The Little Pair." The two girls shared a room, often wore variations of the same dress, and spent much of their time together. Their older sisters Olga and Tatiana also shared a room and were known as "The Big Pair." The four girls sometimes signed letters using the group name, [[OTMA]], which was derived from the first letters of their first names. <ref>Peter Christopher, Peter Kurth, and Edvard Radzinsky, ''Tsar: The Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra,'' pgs. 88-89</ref>

Despite her energy, Anastasia's physical health was sometimes poor. The grand duchess suffered from the painful medical condition ''[[hallux valgus]]'' (bunions), which affected the joints of both her big toes. <ref>Kurth, p. 106.</ref> Anastasia also had a weak muscle in her back and was prescribed twice weekly massage. She hid under the bed or in a cupboard to put off the massage. <ref>Maylunas, Andrei, and Mironenko, Sergei, Galy, Darya, translator, ''A Lifelong Passion, Nicholas and Alexandra: Their Own Story,'' Doubleday, 1997, p. 327</ref> Anastasia's older sister Maria reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia]], who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the [[haemophilia]] gene like their mother. <ref>Vorres, Ian. ''The Last Grand Duchess,'' 1965 p. 115.</ref> Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not haemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of haemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding. <ref>Zeepvat, p. 175</ref>

==Association with Grigori Rasputin==
Anastasia, like all her family, doted on the long-awaited heir Tsarevich Alexei, or "Baby," who suffered frequent attacks of haemophilia and nearly died several times. [[Image:Rasputin2.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Grigori Rasputin with admirers in about 1914.]] Her mother relied on the counsel of [[Grigori Rasputin]], a Russian peasant and wandering ''[[starets]]'' or "holy man," and credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich on numerous occasions. Anastasia and her siblings were also taught to view Rasputin as "Our Friend" and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, Anastasia's aunt [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia]] was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin. Anastasia, her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns.

"All the children seemed to like him," Olga Alexandrovna recalled. "They were completely at ease with him."<ref>Massie, pp. 199-200</ref> Rasputin's friendship with the imperial children was evident in some of the messages he sent to them. In February 1909, Rasputin sent the imperial children a telegram, advising them to "Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework." <ref>Maylunas, Andrei and Mironenko, Sergei, editors; Galy, Darya, translator, A Lifelong Passion: Nicholas and Alexandra: Their Own Story, 1997, p. 321</ref>

However, one of the girls' governesses, Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, was horrified in 1910 that Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns and wanted him barred. Nicholas asked Rasputin to avoid going to the nurseries in the future. The children were aware of the tension in the nursery and feared that their mother would be angered by Tyutcheva's actions. "I am so afr(aid) that S.I. (governess Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva) can speak ... about our friend something bad," Anastasia's twelve-year-old sister Tatiana wrote to their mother on [[March 8]], [[1910]]. "I hope our nurse will be nice to our friend now." <ref>Maylunas, Andrei and Mironenko, Sergei, editors; Galy, Darya, translator, A Lifelong Passion: Nicholas and Alexandra: Their Own Story, 1997, p. 330</ref> Alexandra eventually had Tyutcheva fired.

Tyutcheva took her story to other members of the family. <ref>Massie, p. 208</ref> While Rasputin's visits to the children were, by all accounts, completely innocent in nature, the family was scandalized. Tyutcheva told Nicholas's sister, [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia]], that Rasputin visited the girls, talked with them while they were getting ready for bed, and hugged and patted them. Tyutcheva said the children had been taught not to discuss Rasputin with her and were careful to hide his visits from the nursery staff. Xenia wrote on [[March 15]], [[1910]] that she couldn't understand "...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he's only a [[khlysts|''khlyst'']]!)" <ref>Maylunas, Andrei and Mironenko, Sergei, editors; Galy, Darya, translator, ''A Lifelong Passion: Nicholas and Alexandra: Their Own Story,'' 1997, p. 330</ref>

Rasputin reportedly raped another of the royal governesses, Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, in the spring of 1910. Vishyakova said the empress refused to believe her account of the rape "and said that everything Rasputin does is holy." Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova's claim had been immediately investigated, but "they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard." Vishnyakova was kept from seeing Rasputin after she made her accusation and was later dismissed from her post in 1913. <ref>Radzinsky, Edvard, ''The Rasputin File,'' Doubleday, 2000, pp. 129-130.</ref> It was later whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses.<ref>Mager, Hugo, "Elizabeth: Grand Duchess of Russia," Carroll and Graf Publishers, Inc., 1998</ref> The rumors were fueled by ardent, yet by all accounts innocent, letters written to Rasputin by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses which were released by Rasputin and which circulated throughout society. "My dear, precious, only friend," wrote Anastasia. "How much I should like to see you again. You appeared to me today in a dream. I am always asking Mama when you will come ... I think of you always, my dear, because you are so good to me ..."<ref name="Sams"> {{cite web | author=Sams, Ed | year=| title= "Victoria's Dark Secrets" | work= alexanderpalace.org|url=http://www.curiouschapbooks.com/Catalog_of_Curious_Chapbooks/Victoria_s_Dark_Secrets/body_victoria_s_dark_secrets.html |accessdate = December 31| access year=2006}}</ref> Pornographic cartoons also circulated depicting Rasputin having relations with the empress, with her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova nude in the background. <ref>Christopher, Peter, Kurth, Peter, Radzinsky, Edvard, ''Tsar: The Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra,'' p. 115.</ref> Following the scandal, Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra's displeasure, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Israel.<ref>Christopher, Kurth, and Radzinsky, p. 116</ref> Despite the rumors, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until Rasputin was murdered on [[December 17]], [[1916]]. "Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed," Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on [[December 6]], [[1916]].<ref>Maylunas, Andrei and Mironenko, Sergei, editors; Galy, Darya, translator, A Lifelong Passion: Nicholas and Alexandra: Their Own Story, 1997, p. 489</ref> Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse by Anastasia, her mother and her sisters. She attended his funeral on [[December 21]], [[1916]] and her family planned to build a church over Rasputin's gravesite. <ref>Maylunas and Mironenko, p. 511</ref>

==World War I and Revolution==
During [[World War I]] Anastasia, along with her sister Maria, visited wounded soldiers at a private hospital on the grounds at [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. The two teenagers, too young to become [[Red Cross]] nurses like their mother and elder sisters, played games of [[checkers]] and [[billiards]] with the soldiers and tried to uplift their spirits. Felix Dassel, who was treated at the hospital and knew Anastasia, recalled that the grand duchess had a "laugh like a squirrel," and walked rapidly "as though she ''tripped'' along." <ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson,'' 1983, p. 187.</ref>

[[Image:RomanovGreatDuchesses.jpeg|left|thumb|frame|<center>Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna and her daughters - (left to right) the Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Anastasia, and Maria. Livadia, 1914.]]

In February 1917, Nicholas II abdicated the throne and Anastasia and her family were placed under house arrest at the [[Alexander Palace]] in Tsarskoye Selo during the [[February Revolution|Russian Revolution]]. As the [[Bolsheviks]] approached, [[Alexander Kerensky]] of the [[Provisional Government]] had them moved to [[Tobolsk]], [[Siberia]]. <ref>King and Wilson, pgs. 57-59</ref> After the Bolsheviks seized majority control of Russia, Anastasia and her family were moved to the [[Ipatiev House]], or House of Special Purpose, at [[Yekaterinburg]] <ref>King and Wilson, pgs. 78-102</ref>. 

The stress and uncertainty of captivity took their toll on Anastasia as well as her family. "Goodby," she wrote to a friend in the winter of 1917. "Don't forget us." <ref>Kurth, p. xiv.</ref> At Tobolsk, she wrote a melancholy theme for her English tutor, filled with spelling mistakes, about ''Evelyn Hope,'' a poem by [[Robert Browning]] about a young girl: "When she died she was only sixteen years old," Anastasia wrote. "Ther(e) was a man who loved her without having seen her but (k)new her very well. And she he(a)rd of him also. He never could tell her that he loved her, and now she was dead. But still he thought that when he and she will live [their] next life whenever it will be that ..." <ref>Kurth, p. xiv.</ref> 

At Tobolsk, she and her sisters sewed jewels into their clothing in hopes of hiding them from their captors. She, Olga, and Tatiana were harassed by guards looking for the hidden jewels aboard the Rus, a steamship that ferried them to Yekaterinburg to join their parents and sister Maria in May 1918. Her English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, recalled hearing the grand duchesses screaming in terror and was haunted by his inability to help them. <ref>King and Wilson, pgs. 140-141.</ref> [[Image:TsarNicholasCossacks2.jpg|right|thumb|400px|<center>The Romanovs visiting a regiment during World War I. From left to right, Grand Duchess Anastasia, Grand Duchess Olga, Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarevich Alexei, Grand Duchess Tatiana, and Grand Duchess Maria, and unidentified Cossacks, ca. 1916. Courtesy of http://www.gwpda.org]]Pierre Gilliard recalled his last sight of the children at Yekaterinburg: "The sailor Nagorny, who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch, passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms, behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings. I tried to get out, but was roughly pushed back into the carriage by the sentry. I came back to the window. Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling to drag a heavy brown valise. It was raining and I saw her feet sink into the mud at every step. Nagorny tried to come to her assistance; he was roughly pushed back by one of the commisars ..." <ref>Bokhanov, Knodt, Oustimenko, Peregudova, Tyutynnik, p. 310</ref> Less than two months later, on [[July 14]], [[1918]], local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family and reported that Anastasia and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 276</ref>

However, even in the last months of her life, she found ways to enjoy herself. She and other members of the household performed plays for the enjoyment of their parents and others in the spring of 1918. Anastasia's performance made everyone howl with laughter, according to her tutor Sydney Gibbes. <ref>Christopher, Kurth, and Radzinsky, p. 177.</ref> In a [[May 7]], [[1918]] letter from Tobolsk to her sister Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia described a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: "We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about it so many times yesterday that they got quite fed up, but I could go on telling it masses of times ... What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy." <ref>Maylunas and Mironenko, p. 619</ref> In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as "very friendly and full of fun," while another guard said Anastasia was "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." <ref>King and Wilson, p. 250.</ref> Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess "offensive and a terrorist" and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. <ref>King and Wilson, p. 251.</ref>

She was, according to most accounts, murdered along with her family by a firing squad in the early morning of [[July 17]], [[1918]]. The extra-judicial execution was carried out by forces of the [[Bolshevik]] secret police under the command of [[Yakov Yurovsky]].

== Captivity and Execution ==

After Tsar Nicholas II abdicated the throne in 1917, Russia quickly disintegrated into civil war. Negotiations for the release of the Romanovs between their Bolshevik (commonly referred to as 'Reds') captors and their extended family, many of whom were prominent members of the Royal Houses of Europe, stalled. <ref>King and Wilson, p. 203</ref> As the Whites (loyalists still faithful to the Tsar and the principles of autocracy) advanced toward Yekaterinburg the Reds were in a precarious situation. The Reds knew Yekaterinburg would fall to the better manned and equipped White Army. When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg, the Imperial Family had simply disappeared. The most widely accepted account was that the family had been executed. This was due to an investigation by White Army Investigator Nicholas Sokolov, who came to the conclusion based on items that had belonged to the family being found thrown down a mine shaft.<ref>King and Wilson, pgs. 353-367</ref>

[[Image:romanov.jpg|right|thumb|250px|<center>Photograph of the Russian Imperial Family, 1913. Left to right, seated: Grand Duchess Maria; Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna; Tsarevitch Alexei; Tsar Nicholas II; Grand Duchess Anastasia; Standing: Grand Duchess Tatiana and Grand Duchess Olga]]

The "Yurovsky Note," an account of the event filed by Yurovsky to his Bolshevik superiors following the execution, was found in 1989 and detailed in Edvard Radzinsky's 1992 book ''The Last Tsar.''

According to the note, on the night of the murders the family was awakened and told to dress.  When they asked why, they were informed that they were being moved to a new location to ensure their safety in anticipation of the violence that might ensue when the White Army reached Yekaterinburg.  Once dressed, the family and the small circle of servants and caregivers that had remained with them were herded into a small room in the house's sub-basement and told to wait.  Alexandra and Alexei were allowed to sit in chairs provided by guards at the request of the Tsarina.  After several minutes, the executioners entered the room, led by Yurovsky.  With no hesitation, Yurovsky quickly informed the Tsar and his family that they were all to be executed.  The Tsar had time to say only "What?" and turn to his family before he was assassinated with a bullet to the head.  The Tsarina and her daughter Olga tried to make the sign of the cross, but were also killed in the initial volley of bullets fired by the executioners, both suffering gunshot wounds to the head.  The rest of the Imperial retinue were shot in short order, with the exception of Anna Demidova, Alexandra's maid.  Demidova survived the initial onslaught, but was quickly murdered against the back wall of the basement, stabbed to death while trying to defend herself with a small pillow she had carried into the sub-basement that was filled with precious gems and jewels. <ref>Radzinsky, Edvard, ''The Last Tsar,'' 1992, pgs. 380-393</ref>

The "Yurovsky Note" further reported that once the thick smoke that had filled the room from so many weapons being fired in such close proximity cleared, it was discovered that the executioners' bullets had ricocheted off the corsets of two or three of the Grand Duchesses. The executioners later came to find out that this was because the family's crown [[jewels]] and [[diamonds]] had been sewn inside the linings of the [[corsets]] to hide them from their captors.  The corsets thus served as a form of "armor" against the bullets. Anastasia and Maria were said to have crouched up against a wall, covering their heads in terror, until they were shot down by bullets, recalled Yurovsky. However, another guard, Peter Ermakov, told his wife that Anastasia had been finished off with bayonets. As the bodies were carried out, one or several of the girls cried out, and were clubbed on the back of the head, wrote Yurovsky. <ref>Radzinsky, pgs. 380-393</ref>

==From Mystery to Legend==
[[Image:GrandDuchessAnastasia1914.jpg|left|thumb|300px|<center>Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaievna Romanova, 1914]]The legend of Anastasia's possible survival and escape begins here. Anna Anderson, the most famous Anastasia claimant, would claim that she had feigned death amongst the bodies of her family members and servants, and that she was able to make her escape with the help of a compassionate guard who rescued her from amongst the corpses after noticing that she was still alive. <ref>Kurth, pgs. 33 - 39.</ref>

These rumors were further fueled by various contemporary reports of trains and houses being searched for 'Anastasia Romanov' by Bolshevik soldiers and secret police. <ref>Kurth, p. 44.</ref> When she was briefly imprisoned at [[Perm]] in 1918, [[Helen of Serbia|Princess Helena Petrovna]], the wife of Anastasia's distant cousin, [[Prince Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia]], reported that a guard brought a girl who called herself Anastasia Romanova to her cell and asked if the girl was the daughter of the Tsar. Helena Petrovna said she didn't recognize the girl and the guard took her away. <ref>Kurth, p. 43</ref> Although other witnesses in [[Perm]] later reported that they saw Anastasia, her mother [[Alexandra Fyodorovna]] and sisters in Perm after the murder, that story is now widely discredited as nothing more than a rumor. <ref>Kurth, p. 43</ref>

According to some accounts, there may have been an opportunity for one or more of the guards to rescue a survivor. Yakov Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the murder. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were reportedly left in the basement with the bodies. <ref>King and Wilson, p. 314</ref>

During a 1964-1967 German trial regarding the identity of Anna Anderson, Viennese tailor Heinrich Kleinbetzl testified that he saw a wounded Anastasia immediately following the murders at Yekaterinburg. The girl was being treated by his landlady, Anna Baoudin, in a building directly opposite from the [[Ipatiev House]].

"The lower part of her body was covered with blood, her eyes were shut and she was pale as a sheet," he testified. "We washed her chin, Frau Annouchka and me, then she groaned. The bones must have been broken ... Then she opened her eyes for a minute." Kleinbetzl testified that the wounded girl remained in his landlady's home for three days.  During those days, Red Guards came to the house, but knew his landlady too well to actually search the house. "They went like this: 'Anastasia's disappeared, but she's not here, that's for sure,'" he testified. Finally a Red Guard, the same man who had brought her, came to take her away. Kleinbetzl knew no more about her fate. <ref>Kurth, p. 339</ref>

Kleinbetzl had delivered clothing to the Ipatiev House and seen the grand duchesses walking in the home's enclosed courtyard, but had never spoken to any of them. He testified that the wounded girl was "one of the women" he had seen walking in the courtyard, not that he personally recognized her as Anastasia.<ref>Kurth, p. 339</ref> 

Anastasia's possible survival was one of the celebrated mysteries of the 20th century. In 1922, as rumors spread that one of the grand duchesses or that all of the family had survived, a woman who later came to call herself [[Anna Anderson]] appeared in Germany and claimed to be Anastasia. She created a life-long controversy and made headlines for decades, with some surviving relatives believing she was Anastasia and others not. Indeed, it was she who made Anastasia and her legend famous. Her battle for recognition continues to be the longest running case that was ever heard by the German courts, where the case was officially filed. It began in 1938, and a final verdict was not handed down until 1970. The final decision of the court was that Anderson had not provided sufficient proof to claim the identity of the grand duchess.<ref>Kurth, pgs. 289-358</ref>

Anderson died in 1984 and her body was cremated. DNA tests conducted in 1994 on a tissue sample from Anderson located in a hospital and the blood of a close Romanov relative demonstrated that it was extremely unlikely that she was Anastasia as she had claimed, and more likely that she was a missing Polish factory worker, Franziska Schanzkowska. <ref>Massie, ''The Romanovs: The Final Chapter,'' 1995, pgs. 194-229</ref> 

In 1991, bodies believed to be those of the Imperial Family and their servants were finally exhumed from a mass grave in the woods outside [[Yekaterinburg]].  The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who still ruled Russia when the grave was originally found.  Once opened, the excavators realized that instead of eleven sets of remains (Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, Tsarevitch Alexei, the four Grand Duchesses, Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia; the family's doctor, Yevgeny Botkin; their valet, Alexei Trupp; their cook, Ivan Kharinotov; and Alexandra's maid, Anna Demidova) the grave held only nine.  Alexei and, according to the late forensic expert Dr. William Maples, Anastasia were missing from the family's grave. Russian scientists contested this, however, claiming that it was the body of the [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia]] that was missing. The Russians identified Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest grand duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave. They estimated the height and width of the skulls where pieces of bone were missing. American scientists found this method inexact. <ref>Robert K. Massie, ''The Romanovs: The Final Chapter,'' p. 67.</ref>

American scientists thought the missing body to be Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, that they would have expected to find in a seventeen year old.  In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5'7" was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of her standing beside her three sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Anastasia was several inches shorter than all of them. Her mother commented on sixteen-year-old Anastasia's short stature in a [[December 15]], [[1917]] letter, written seven months before the murders. "Anastasia, to her despair, is now very fat, as Maria was, round and fat to the waist, with short legs. I do hope she will grow." <ref>Maylunas and Mironenko, p. 595</ref> However, scientists considered it unlikely that the teenager could have grown so much in the last months of her life. Her actual height was approximately 5'2" <ref>King and Wilson, p. 434.</ref>

DNA testing confirmed these were the remains of the Imperial Family and their servants, although the fate of the two missing children remains a mystery. Some historians believe the account of the "Yurovsky Note" that two of the bodies were removed from the main grave and cremated at an undisclosed area.  The rationale was that this action would create doubt that these were the remains of the Tsar and his retinue should the grave be discovered by the Whites because the body count would not be correct. However, some forensic experts believe the complete burning of two bodies in that short amount of time would have been impossible given the environment and materials possessed by Yurovsky and his men. <ref>King and Wilson, p. 468</ref> Numerous searches of the area in subsequent years have also failed to turn up a cremation site or the remains of the two missing Romanov children. <ref>King and Wilson, p. 469.</ref>
 
In [[2000]], the family was [[Canonization|canonized]] as [[passion bearer]]s by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The family had previously been canonized in 1981 by the [[Russian Orthodox Church Abroad]] as [[martyr|holy martyrs]]. <ref>{{cite web | author=Shevchenko, Maxim  | year= 2000| title= "The Glorification of the Royal Family" | work= Nezavisemaya Gazeta |  url=http://www.struggler.org/GlorificationOfTheRoyalFamily.html | accessdate= December 10| accessyear=2006}}</ref>

== Influence on Culture ==

[[Image:Anastasia 1956 DVD cover.jpg|right|thumb|180px|<center>"Anastasia" DVD cover.]]

The possible survival of Anastasia has been the subject of both theatrical and made-for-television films. The earliest, made in [[1928]], was called ''Clothes Make the Woman.''  The story followed a woman who turns up to play the part of a rescued Anastasia for a Hollywood film, and ends up being recognized by the Russian soldier who originally rescued her from her would-be assassins. 

The most famous is probably the highly fictionalized [[1956]] [[Anastasia (1956 movie)|''Anastasia'']] starring [[Ingrid Bergman]] as [[Anna Anderson]], [[Yul Brynner]] as General Bounine (a fictional character based on several actual men), and [[Helen Hayes]] as the [[Maria Fyodorovna|Dowager Empress Marie]], Anastasia's paternal grandmother. The film tells the story of a woman from an asylum who appears in [[Paris]] in 1928 and is captured by several Russian emigr<U+00E9>s who feed her information so that they can fool Anastasia's grandmother into thinking Anderson actually is her granddaughter in order to obtain a Tsarist fortune. As time goes by they begin to suspect that this "Madame A. Anderson" really is the missing Grand Duchess.

In 1986, NBC broadcast a mini-series loosely based on a book published in 1983 by Peter Kurth called ''Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson''. The movie, ''Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna'' was a two-part series which began with the young Anastasia Nicholaievna and her family being sent to Yekaterinburg, where they are executed by Bolshevik soldiers. The story then moves to [[1923]], and while taking great liberties, fictitiously follows the claims of the woman known as Anna Anderson.  [[Amy Irving]] portrays the adult Anna Anderson. The movie also featured appearances by  many veteran movie and TV actors, most notably [[Omar Sharif]] as Tsar Nicholas II.

The most recent film is [[1997]]'s [[Anastasia (1997 film)|''Anastasia'']], an animated musical adaptation of the story of Anastasia's escape from Russia and her subsequent quest for recognition that took even greater liberties with historical fact than the 1956 film of the same name. 

In [[Romanov Prophecy|''The Romanov Prophecy,'']] a 2004 novel by [[Steve Berry]], the wounded Anastasia and Alexei are rescued by guards and spirited away to the United States, where they live under assumed names with a family of loyalists paid by [[Felix Yussupov]]. In the novel, both children died of illnesses in the 1920s, but not before Alexei married and fathered a son. 

On the daytime drama [[Passions]] the witch [[Tabitha Lenox]] has revealed that she inspired the idea for Anastasia to be spared from assassination.

Anastasia's survival is also the subject of the song "Yes Anastasia" by contemporary musician [[Tori Amos]]. The band [[Innocence Mission]] also sings of the Anastasia/Anna Anderson legend in their song "I Remember Me".  Anastasia is mentioned in the [[1968]] [[Rolling Stones]] song "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]" in the line "Anastasia screamed in vain."

Anastasia appears as a playable character in the [[2004]] [[PlayStation 2]] [[Console role-playing game]] [[Shadow Hearts: Covenant]].
