The '''Hittites''' (also '''Hethites''') and '''children of Heth''' are a people or peoples mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]].  They are listed in [[Book of Genesis]] as  second of the twelve [[Canaan]]ite nations,  descended from one '''[[Heth (Bible)|Heth]]''' ({{lang|he|<U+05D7><U+05EA>}} ''<U+1E25>t'' in the consonant-only [[Hebrew script]]).  Under the names {{lang|he|<U+05D1><U+05E0><U+05D9>-<U+05D7><U+05EA>}} (''bny-<U+1E25>t'' "children of Heth") or {{lang|he|<U+05D7><U+05EA><U+05D9>}} (''<U+1E25>ty'' "native of Heth") they are mentioned several times as living in or near [[Canaan]] since the time of [[Abraham]] (estimated to be between 2000 BC and 1500 BC) to the time of [[Ezra]] after the return from the [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Babylonian exile]] (around 450 BC).  Heth ({{Hebrew Name|<U+05D7><U+05B5><U+05EA>|H<U+0331>et|<U+1E24><U+0113><U+1E6F>}}) is said in Genesis to be a son of [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]], son of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], son of [[Noah]].

In the late 19th century, the biblical Hittites were identified with a newly discovered [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking empire  of [[Anatolia]], a major regional power through most of the 2nd millennium BC, who therefore came to be known as the [[Hittites]]. This nomenclature is used today as a matter of convention, regardless of debates about possible identities between the Anatolian Hittite Empire and the biblical Hittites.

==Identification hypotheses==

According to Genesis, in Abraham's days, the Hittite Ephron sold him the cave in [[Hebron]]. Later, Esau married wives from the Hittites. In the [[Book of Joshua]] 1:4, when the Lord tells Joshua "From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border", this "land of the Hittites" on Canaan's border is seen to stretch between Lebanon and the Euphrates, and from there toward the setting Sun (i.e., to the west).  

According to the [[Book of Judges]] 1:26, when the Israelites captured [[Bethel]], they allowed one man to escape, and he went to the "land of the Hittites" where he founded the settlement of Luz. In King Solomon's era moreover the Hittites are depicted in the Old Testament along with Syria as among his powerful neighbors. 

From around 1900, archaeologists were aware of a country established in Anatolia and known to Assyrians as "Hatti". Because it was initially assumed that the people of ''Hatti'' were identical to the ''Hetti'' of the Hebrew Bible, the term Hittite Empire is still today used to describe the Anatolian state.  Their language is known to have been a member of the Indo-European family. Because its speakers were originally based in Kanesh, they called their language "Neshili". The former inhabitants of Hatti and Hattusas are now called ''Hattites''; and their [[Hattic language]] was not Indo-European, but is of unknown linguistic relationship. 

After the fall of the Hittite Empire around 1178 BC, a remnant of them, still using the name "people of Hatti", established some city-states in the region of northern Syria. Therefore these are usually assumed to be the Hittites mentioned in Solomon's time. However, certain scholars have objected that in their view, the Hittites of the Bible had no connection with either the Hittite Empire nor with the preceding Hattites. 

===The case for identity===
Some scholars take the view that the two peoples are identical.<ref name=Mendenhall1973>{{cite book|last=Mendenhall|first=George|title=The Tenth Generation: The Origins of the Biblical Tradition|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1973|isbn=0-8018-1654-8}}</ref> Apart from the similarity in names, the Anatolian Hittites were a powerful political entity in the region before the collapse of their empire in the 14th-12th centuries BC, so one would expect them to be mentioned in the Bible, just in the way that the ''<U+1E24>TY'' post-Exodus are.  A stone [[lion]] relief found at [[Beth Shan]], near the [[Sea of Galilee]] (now at the [[Israel Museum]]), dated to about 1700 BC, has been interpreted by professor Bill Humble as confirming this identification, since lions are often pictured in Hittite art.<ref>[http://www.knls.org/English/trascripts/humble03.htm Humble].</ref> Moreover, in the account of the conquest of Canaan, the Hittites are said to dwell "in the mountains" and "towards the north" of Canaan &mdash; a description that matches the general direction and geography of the original Hittite empire, which had been influential in the region prior to the [[Battle of Kadesh]].

Modern academics propose, based on much [[onomastic]] and archaeological evidence, that Anatolian populations moved south into Canaan as part of the waves of [[Sea Peoples]] who were migrating along the Mediterranean coastline at the time of the collapse of the Hittite Empire. Many kings of local city-states are shown to have had Hittite and [[Luwian]] names in the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze]] to [[Iron Age|Early Iron Age]] transition period. Indeed, even the name of Mount [[Zion]] may be Hittite in origin.<ref name="Mendenhall1973"/>

===The case for separation===
Because of the perceived discrepancy between the picture of the Hittites as developed in the Bible and the archaeological discoveries, some biblical scholars reject [[Archibald Sayce]]'s identification of the two peoples, and believe that the similarity in names is only a coincidence. For example [[E. A. Speiser]], referring to "the children of Heth" in the [[Book of Genesis]] writes "For reasons of both history and geography, it is most unlikely that this group name has any direct connection either with the Hattians of Anatolia or with their 'Hittite' successors."<ref>
{{cite book |last=Speiser |first=E. A. |authorlink=Ephraim Avigdor Speiser |title= Genesis: Introduction, Translation and Notes  |series=The [[Anchor Bible]] |volume=1 |year= 1964 |publisher=Doubleday & Co.|isbn= 0-385-00854-6|pages= 172}}</ref>

[[Trevor Bryce]] suggests that biblical references to Hittites may be separated into two distinct groups.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Kingdom of the Hittites|last= Bryce|first= Trevor|authorlink= Trevor Bryce|year= 1998|publisher= Clarendon Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 0-19-814095-9|pages=389<U+2013>391 }}</ref>  The first, the majority, are to a Canaanite tribe as encountered by Abraham and his family. The names of these Hittites are for the most part of a Semitic type; for example <u>Ephron</u> at {{bibleverse||Genesis|23:8-17|HE}} etc., <u>Judith</u> at {{bibleverse||Genesis|26:34|HE}} and <u>Zohar</u> at {{bibleverse||Genesis|23:8|HE}}. These were presumably the Hittites who were subject to [[Solomon]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1-2|HE}}, {{bibleverse|1|Kings|9:20-21|HE}}, {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|8:7|HE}}) and who were elsewhere in conflict with the Israelites ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|20:17|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Judges|3:5|HE}}). They were a small group living in the hills, and clearly to be distinguished from the Hittites of the Anatolian Kingdom.

But there are other biblical references which are not compatible with the notion of a small Canaanite hill tribe. Most notable among these is {{bibleverse|2|Kings|7:6|HE}}: "For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us."

This conveys the impression that the Hittite kings were commensurate in importance and power with the Egyptian pharaohs. A similar impression is conveyed by {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|1:17|HE}}: "And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means." In these cases there can be little doubt that the references are to the [[neo-Hittite]] kingdoms of Syria.

If the references to the Canaanite tribe are distinct from those to the neo-Hittite kingdom, the similarity between the names (only two significant consonants) could easily be due to chance.

The citations were arranged approximately in chronological order, more precisely according to the epoch in which the events in question are supposed to have occurred. Note that this is not always the time in which the words were supposedly or actually written. (In particular, the covenant with Abraham about the future conquest of Canaan is sorted as if it were contemporary with the latter.) The epochs are indicated by the names of the biblical characters (Patriarchs, Judges, Kings, or Prophets) prominent at the time.

===From Noah to Abraham===

The biblical view of the genetic relationships among humanity is set forth in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]:10, where various peoples are described as different lines of descent from [[Noah]]. In particular, [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]] is one of the sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], who is also said to be the ancestor of the [[Egyptians]], and the [[Philistines]].  The sons of Canaan are given as [[Sidon]], Heth, then the [[Jebusite]]s, [[Amorite]]s, [[List of minor biblical tribes#Girgashites|Girgasites]], [[Hivite]]s, [[List of minor biblical tribes#Arkites|Arkites]], [[List of minor biblical tribes#Sinites|Sinites]], [[List of minor biblical tribes#Arvadites|Arvadites]], [[List of minor biblical tribes#Zemarites|Zemarites]], and the [[List of minor biblical tribes#Hamathites|Hamathites]].

====Noah====

*{{bibleverse||Genesis|10:1|HE}} Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and [[Japheth]]: and unto them were sons born after the flood. [...] 6 And the sons of Ham; [[Biblical Cush|Cush]], and [[Mizraim]], and [[Phut]], and Canaan. 7 And the sons of Cush; [[List of minor biblical figures#Seba|Seba]], and [[Havilah]], and [[Sabtah]], and [[Raamah]], and [[Sabtecha]]: and the sons of Raamah; [[Sheba]], and [[Dedan]]. 8 And Cush begat [[Nimrod]] [...] 10 And the beginning of his kingdom was [[Babylon|Babel]], and [[Erech]], and [[Accad]], [...]. 13 And Mizraim begat [[Ludim]], and [[Anamim]], and [[Lehabim]], and [[Naphtuhim]], 14 And [[Pathrusim]], and [[Casluhim]], (out of whom came [[Philistim]],) and [[Caphtorim]]. 15 And Canaan begat [[Sidon]] his firstborn, and <u>Heth</u>, 16 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 18 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. 19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to [[Gerar]], unto [[Gaza City|Gaza]]; as thou goest, unto [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom, and Gomorrah]], and [[Admah]], and [[Zeboim (biblical)|Zeboim]], even unto [[Lasha]]. 20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

*{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|1:13|HE}} And Canaan begat Zidon his firstborn, and <u>Heth</u>, [...]

===From Abraham to Egypt===
In this period, which is conjectured to start sometime after 2000 BC and end sometime before 1200 BC, the "sons of Heth" or "children of Heth" (<U+05D1><U+05E0><U+05D9>-<U+05D7><U+05EA>, ''BNY-HT'') and the label "Hittite" (''HTY'') are mentioned multiple times, but referring to essentially only two events. 

In {{bibleverse||Genesis|23:2|HE}}, towards the end of Abraham's life, he was staying in Hebron, on lands belonging to the "children of Heth", and from them he obtained a plot of land with a cave to bury his wife [[Sarah]]. One of them ([[Ephron]]) is labeled "the Hittite", several times. This deal is mentioned three more times (with almost the same words), upon the deaths of Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph.  

Decades later, in {{bibleverse||Genesis|26:34|HE}}, Abraham's grandson Esau is said to have taken two Hittite wives, and a Hivite one. This claim is repeated, with somewhat different names, in {{bibleverse||Genesis|36:2|HE}}. In {{bibleverse||Genesis|27:46|HE}}, [[Rebekah]] is worried that [[Jacob]] will do the same.

====Abraham====

*{{bibleverse||Genesis|23:2|HE}} And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of <u>Heth</u>, saying, 4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. 5 And the children of <u>Heth</u> answered Abraham, saying unto him, 6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. 7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of <u>Heth</u>. 8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. 10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of <u>Heth</u>: and Ephron the <u>Hittite</u> answered Abraham in the audience of the children of <u>Heth</u>, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. [...] 16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of <u>Heth</u>, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. 17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure 18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of <u>Heth</u>, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. 20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of <u>Heth</u>. 

*{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:8|HE}} Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. 9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the <u>Hittite</u>, which is before Mamre; 10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of <u>Heth</u>: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

====Esau and Jacob====
*{{bibleverse||Genesis|26:34|HE}} And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the <u>Hittite</u>, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the <u>Hittite</u>: 35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

*{{bibleverse||Genesis|27:46|HE}} And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of <u>Heth</u>: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of <u>Heth</u>, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me? 

*{{bibleverse||Genesis|36:2|HE}} Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the <u>Hittite</u>, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 3 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

*{{bibleverse||Genesis|49:29|HE}} And he [Jacob] charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the <u>Hittite</u> 30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the <u>Hittite</u> for a possession of a buryingplace. 31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of <u>Heth</u>.

====Joseph====

*{{bibleverse||Genesis|50:13|HE}} For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying place of Ephron the <u>Hittite</u>, before Mamre.

This passage refers to Jacob being buried in Machpelah. Joseph was buried in Shechem Joshua 24.32 "And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money; and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph."

===Exodus and the conquest of Canaan===

This period is conjectured to start sometime after 1800 BC and end sometime before 1000 BC. In this period (in which can be included the promise made to Abraham, centuries earlier, and its recall by [[Nehemiah]] half a millennium later), the Hittites are mentioned about a dozen times as part of an almost fixed formula that lists the "seven nations greater and mightier than [the Hebrews]" whose lands will be eventually conquered. Five other "major nations" are mentioned in almost all instances of the formula: [[Canaan]]ites, [[Amorites]], [[Hivites]], [[Jebusites]], and [[Perizzites]].  The [[Girgashites]] are mentioned only five times.  Abraham's covenant in {{bibleverse||Genesis|15:18|HE}} omits the [[Hivites]] but includes the [[Kadmonites]], [[Kenites]], [[Kenizzite]]s, and [[Rephaim]].

Among the five references to the Hittites that cannot be classified as a variant of that formula, two ({{bibleverse||Numbers|13:29|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Joshua|11:3|HE}}) declare that the Hittites "dwell in the mountains", together with the [[Jebusites]], [[Amorites]], and [[Perizzites]], whereas the Canaanites live "on the east and on the west", on the coast of Jordan, and the [[Amalekites]] live "in the south". In {{bibleverse||Joshua|1:4|HE}} the land of the Hittites is said to extend "from the wilderness and this Lebanon", from "the Euphrates unto the great sea".  In {{bibleverse||Judges|1:18|HE}}, the Bethel traitor who led the Hebrews into the city is said to have gone to live among the Hittites where he built a city called Luz. Finally in {{bibleverse||Judges|3:5|HE}} it is said that the Hebrew lived and intermarried with the Hittites as well as with the other five "major nations".

====Abraham's covenant====

*{{bibleverse||Genesis|15:18|HE}} In the same day the {{LORD}} made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: 19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 20 And the <u>Hittites</u>, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 21 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

*{{bibleverse||Nehemiah|9:8|HE}} And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the <u>Hittites</u>, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:

====Moses====

*{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|20:17|HE}} But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the <u>Hittites</u>, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the {{LORD}} thy God hath commanded thee:

*{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|7:1|HE}} When the {{LORD}} thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the <u>Hittites</u>, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;

*{{bibleverse||Numbers|13:29|HE}} The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the <u>Hittites</u>, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.

====Joshua====

*{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:8|HE}} And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the <u>Hittites</u>, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. [...] 17 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the <u>Hittites</u>, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

*{{bibleverse||Exodus|13:5|HE}} And it shall be when the {{LORD}} shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the <u>Hittites</u>, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.

*{{bibleverse||Exodus|23:23|HE}} For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the <u>Hittites</u>, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off. [...] 28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the <u>Hittite</u>, from before thee.

*{{bibleverse||Exodus|33:2|HE}} And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the <u>Hittite</u>, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:

*{{bibleverse||Exodus|34:11|HE}} Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the <u>Hittite</u>, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

*{{bibleverse||Joshua|1:4|HE}} From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the <u>Hittites</u>, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.

*{{bibleverse||Joshua|11:3|HE}} And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the <u>Hittite</u>, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.

*{{bibleverse||Joshua|12:8|HE}} In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the <u>Hittites</u>, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:

*{{bibleverse||Joshua|24:11|HE}} And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the <u>Hittites</u>, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.

*{{bibleverse||Joshua|3:10|HE}} And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the <u>Hittites</u>, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.

*{{bibleverse||Joshua|9:1|HE}} And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the <u>Hittite</u>, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof.

====Judges====

*{{bibleverse||Judges|1:18|HE}} Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof. 19 And the {{LORD}} was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron. [...] 21 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day. 22 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the {{LORD}} was with them. 23 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.) 24 And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy. 25 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family. 26 And the man went into the land of the <u>Hittites</u>, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day. 27 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.

*{{bibleverse||Judges|3:1|HE}} Now these are the nations which the {{LORD}} left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan; 2 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; 3 Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath. 4 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the {{LORD}}, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. 5 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, <u>Hittites</u>, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: 6 And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods. 7 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the {{LORD}}, and forgat the {{LORD}} their God, and served Baalim and the groves. 8 Therefore the anger of the {{LORD}} was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.

===Kingdoms period===

In this period the Hittites are mentioned as the ethnic label of two soldiers under king David (around 1000 BC), [[Ahimelech]] and [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]];<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|11:3|HE}}</ref> the latter is murdered by David for the sake of his wife [[Bathsheba]]. 

In Solomon's reign (around 950 BC), the Hittites are listed as people whom the Hebrews had not been able "utterly to destroy" in their conquest of Canaan and who paid tribute to Israel.  The kings of the Hittites are mentioned (in two similar passages), together with Egypt and the kings of [[Syria]], as senders of lavish tribute to Solomon. Then Hittites are said to be among the "strange women" that Solomon loved, along with "the daughter of the pharaoh" and women from the other peoples in the region.

In the time of the prophet [[Elisha]] (around 850 BC) there is a passage in 2Kings 7:6 where the Syrians flee in the night after hearing a terrible noise of horses and chariots, believing that Israel had hired "the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians".

====Saul====

*{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|26:5|HE}} And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him. 6 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the <u>Hittite</u>, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.

====David====

*{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|23:8|HE}}  These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: [...] 39 Uriah the <u>Hittite</u>: thirty and seven in all.

*{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|11:10|HE}} These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the {{LORD}} concerning Israel. [...] 41 Uriah the <u>Hittite</u>, Zabad the son of Ahlai,

*{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|11:3|HE}} And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the <u>Hittite</u>? 4 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house. ["Uriah the Hittite" named 4 more times in this chapter.]

*{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|12:9|HE}} [Nathan:] Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the {{LORD}}, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the <u>Hittite</u> with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. 10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the <u>Hittite</u> to be thy wife.

*{{bibleverse|1|Kings|15:5|HE}} Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the {{LORD}}, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the <u>Hittite</u>.

====Solomon====

*{{bibleverse|1|Kings|9:20|HE}} And all the people that were left of the Amorites, <u>Hittites</u>, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel, 21 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.

*{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|8:7|HE}} As for all the people that were left of the <u>Hittites</u>, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel,

*{{bibleverse|1|Kings|10:28|HE}} And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the <u>Hittites</u>, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.

*{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|1:16|HE}} And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 17 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the <u>Hittites</u>, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.

*{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1|HE}} But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and <u>Hittites</u>; 2 Of the nations concerning which the {{LORD}} said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love. 3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. 4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the {{LORD}} his God, as was the heart of David his father. 5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the {{LORD}}, and went not fully after the {{LORD}}, as did David his father. 7 Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon. 8 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.

====Elisha====
*{{bibleverse|2|Kings|7:6|HE}} For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the <u>Hittites</u>, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us. 7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.

===Babylonian exile and return===

In Ezekiel 16:1, [[Jerusalem]] is said to be the daughter of a Hittite mother and an Amorite father, sister of [[Samaria]] and [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. The intent is clearly offensive, but it is not clear whether the reference to the Hittites is concrete or only symbolic.  However, a century later, Ezra is dismayed to learn, on his arrival from [[Babylon]], that the leaders who had remained on the land had been "polluted" by mixing with other people, including the Hittites.

====Ezekiel====

*{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:1|HE}} Again the word of the {{LORD}} came unto me, saying, 2 Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 3 And say, Thus saith the Lord {{GOD}} unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an <u>Hittite</u>. [...] 44 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter. 45 Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an <u>Hittite</u>, and your father an Amorite. 46 And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.

====Ezra====

*{{bibleverse|1|Esdras|8:3}} (Apocrypha) This Esdras went up from Babylon, as a scribe, being very ready in the law of Moses, that was given by the God of Israel. 4 And the king [Artaxerxes] did him honour: for he found grace in his sight in all his requests. 5 There went up with him also certain of the children of Israel, of the priest of the Levites, of the holy singers, porters, and ministers of the temple, unto Jerusalem, [...]  68 Now when these things were done, the rulers came unto me, and said, 69 The nation of Israel, the princes, the priests and Levites, have not put away from them the strange people of the land, nor the pollutions of the Gentiles to wit, of the Canaanites, <u>Hittites</u>, Pheresites, Jebusites, and the Moabites, Egyptians, and Edomites.

*{{bibleverse||Ezra|9:1|HE}} Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the <u>Hittites</u>, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
