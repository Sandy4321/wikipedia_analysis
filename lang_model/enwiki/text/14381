The '''Buchli drive''' is a transmission system used on in [[electric locomotive]]s. It was named after its inventor, Swiss engineer [[Jakob Buchli]] [[:de:Jakob Buchli|<small>[Deutsch]</small>]]. The drive is a fully-spring loaded [[Vehicle propulsion|drive]], in which each floating axle has an individual motor, that is placed in the spring mounted [[locomotive frame]].  The weight of the driving [[Electric motor|motors]] is completely disconnected from the driving wheels, which are exposed to movement of the rails.

First used in electric locomotives from the 1920s, the Buchli drive made possible the construction of faster and more powerful locomotives that required larger and heavier [[traction motors]]. The system minimising the impact on [[rail track]]s due to the reduction in the overall [[unsprung weight]]. Although the drive was very successful though the 1930s, it is little used in modern locomotives, having been replaced with smaller, simpler drives that exhibit less [[imbalance]] and allow higher speeds.

==Construction==

In a Buchli drive a driven [[gear|gear wheel]] is securely fixed to the locomotive [[locomotive frame]]. Inside this gear wheel are two levels, coupled to gear segments that mesh with one another. The other end of the levers is are coupled via [[universal joint]]s to tension bars, which are then coupled via more universal joints to the driving rail wheel.<ref name=book>{{cite web

Vertical movement of the driving wheel results in the the gear segments moving due to the internal mechanism, and the driving wheel can move in a horizontal or vertical direction with respect to the gear wheel, while still transferring the momentum of the gear wheel.<ref name=book/>

A disadvantage of the drive was the large number of moving parts, which demanded frequent [[lubrication]] and careful maintenance. As a result the Buchli drive system was mainly used on express train locomotives, as there were no other drive systems that gave the same performance at high speeds. However, at higher speeds the drive components became  unbalanced, causing issues at speeds over 140 km per hour.

==Standard design==
The Buchli drive was exported to other rail companies as one sided separate [[traction motor]] drive, usually with an inside frame.

The motor framework with the wheelset bearing is located between the wheel disks of the driving wheels. The gear wheel, which is housed in an auxiliary frame outside the driving wheels and is surrounded by a protective casing, is on one side of the driving wheels.  Each gear wheel is driven by an individual traction motor, which is located above the gear wheel in the locomotive body. 

With this implementation, a strongly one-sided weight distribution occurs in the underframe through the remote gear wheels. In order to maintain stability of the locomotive on the longitudinal axis, heavy equipment inside the locomotive body must be arranged on the opposite side of the drive equipment.  

Locomotives with a Buchli drive also typically have an asymmetrical appearance: on one side, the bearings of the drive wheels are visible, on the other side, they are almost completely covered by the wheel cover box of the gear wheels. 

==Other designs==

In addition to the standard implementation, there were also the following variations:

===Outside frame===
The engine framework with the driving wheel housing is outside the wheel disks of the driving wheels.  The driving wheel is enclosed by a quill camped in the locomotive cabinet, on which the gear wheel sits.  Examples included the [[PRR O1|Pennsylvania Railroad O1b]], and the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft|Deutsche Reichsbahn]] ET11.01.

===Group drive===
The motor is arranged between the floating axles. A common pinion or a pinion on both motor end drives the gear wheels of the neighbouring axes.  {{US patent|1683674}} described this design,  but vehicles implementing it are not known.  

===Bilateral drive===
The driving wheel is coupled with two gear wheels, and the motor has a pinion on both sides.<ref>{{cite web

However with this arrangement, there is the danger of mechanical stress in the drive components. About these of the driving engine waves distant, to hold, was molted the pinions executed. Examples included the French express train locomotives:  SNCF 2D2 5400, SNCF 2D2 5500, SNCF 2D2 9100.

===Two motors per axis===
Two driving motors work on one common gear wheel, which is interconnected with a driving wheel. Examples include the  Pennsylvania Railroad O1b.

Nearly 240 locomotives of the SBB with Buchli drive were in use for over sixty years.  The SBB Ae 3/6I class locomotives were in operation from 1921 to 1994.  French tracks had 100 express train locomotives using the Buchli drive, in service for fifty years.
