==Description==
'''''Calotes andamanensis''''' Boulenger, 1891. 

'''Holotype'''.<U+2014> Zoological Museum, K<U+00F8>benhavns Universitet, Copenhagen, Denmark (ZMUC) 36944, adult male from Nicobar Islands, India; collected by Frederick Adolph de Roepstorff (1842-1896) on 7 January 1882. 

'''Diagnosis'''.<U+2014> ''Calotes andamanensis'' is diagnosed by having enlarged keeled scales on caudal surface of thigh, obtusely keeled scales over head, smooth dorsal body scales (uppers six rows directed posterodorsally, remainder posteroventrally), and lacking body crest, antehumeral pit present; 67 scales around midbody; tympanum (11% HL); toe III shorter than IV. Distinguished from ''Calotes aurantolabium'' in having smooth dorsals, dorsal body scales unequal, upper six scale rows larger, remainder equal in size to ventral scales; three enlarged scales on caudal thigh; dorsal head scales obtusely keeled; parietal ridge raised; enlarged scale between nuchal crest and tympanum; antehumeral pit present; toe-IV longer than III; stretched hindlimb reaches eye. Distinguished from ''Calotes versicolor'' and ''Calotes liocephalus'' groups and ''C. rouxi'' and ''C. ellioti'' in presence of enlarged keeled scales on caudal surface of thigh. Distinguished from ''Calotes versicolor'' group lizards in scale orientation <U+2013> distinguished from ''Calotes versicolor'' in having an antehumeral pit; distinguished from ''C. nemoricola'' and ''C. grandisquamis'' in having equal size dorsal and ventral scales, toe-IV longer than III, scales around midbody 67 (36-43 and 27-35 respectively); distinguished from ''C. calotes'' in lacking flattened spines above tympanum. Distinguished from ''C. ellioti'' and ''C. rouxi'' in having an antehumeral pit and in lacking spines. Distinguished from ''Calotes liocephalus'' group lizards (''C. ceylonensis, C. desilvai, C. liolepis, C. nigrilabris'') in lacking spines on the head; distinguished from ''C. liocephalus'' by midbody scale count and body crest.
