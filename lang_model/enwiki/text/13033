Links are submitted by Fark members (called "farkers"), which [[System administrator|administrator]]s can approve for posting on either the main page or one of the subsidiary tab pages ("greenlit") . All links, approved or not, have associated threads where users can comment on the link. Fark moderators police the discussion threads to delete forbidden content.<ref>[http://www.fark.com/farq/posting.shtml Fark.com] Posting Rules</ref> Greenlit links can generate upwards of 300,000 [[page views]] in one month for the recipient,<ref name=FarkTraffic>[http://www.viperchill.com/definitive-guide-to-fark/ Viperchill.com] Definitive Guide to Fark and Getting Mass Traffic</ref> such an enormous amount of [[web traffic|traffic]] that smaller websites are often "[[Slashdot effect|farked]]," meaning that their [[web server|servers]] have crashed.

==History==
Curtis states that the word "fark" originated either from a chat room [[euphemism]] for the word "fuck" or from a drunken misspelling, although he tells people it's the former because it's a "better story that way."<ref name="Fark FAQ">"[http://www.fark.com/farq/about.shtml#About_Fark Fark.com FAQ]." "Fark.com." Retrieved on [[January 14]], [[2008]].</ref> He registered Fark.com in [[September 1997]], when a friend mentioned that all the four letter domain names were disappearing<ref name ="Kawasaki">"[http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/02/panel_of_web_co.html Guy Kawasaki: Panel of Web Community Founders: Utter Defiance of the "Venture Capital" Model] Video @ 8:35</ref>. Originally, Fark contained no content except for an image of a [[squirrel]] with large [[testicles]].

Since 1993, Curtis had frequently read morning news stories and exchanged them with friends.<ref name=biz20>{{cite news

In Fark's first year, it received 50,000 page views, and 1 million the year after.<ref name="FarkChapter1">[http://www.fark.com/2007/book/chapter1.shtml Fark.com] First chapter of It's Not News It's FARK, How mainstream media tries to pass of news as crap</ref> Features such as link submission and forums were added as popularity and participation grew. By January 2008, according to Curtis, the site received an estimated 52 million page views per month from 4 million unique visitors.<ref name="TakahashiD" /> As of June 2008, the site had more than 450,000 registered users.<ref name=inside>[http://insidethesites.com/2008/06/26/interview-with-farkcoms-founder-drew-curtis/ Interview with Drew Curtis] Inside the Sites</ref>

==Fark, the Business==
Fark operates as the entity "Fark, Inc." The entity was officially [https://sos-res.state.de.us/tin/GINameSearch.jsp formed in Delaware] on January 31, 2008 (File 4490837). 

In spite of its laid back culture, Fark is considerably more profitable than most of its rivals.<ref name=ingram>[http://www.mathewingram.com/work/2006/08/22/forget-digg-what-about-fark/ Matt Ingram: Forget Digg, what about Fark?] "Nevertheless, the Business 2.0 piece is worth reading if only for one reason <U+2014> to realize how staggeringly successful Fark.com is. Plenty of attention gets paid to Kevin Rose and Digg (and rightly so) and to other sites like del.icio.us, and even to political blogs like DailyKos and Instapundit, but not much gets written about the site Drew Curtis put together in 1999 and still more or less runs singlehandedly from Lexington, Kentucky (a location that could explain why he gets so little attention from the Web cognoscenti; ever been to Mike<U+2019>s house for a party, Drew?)"</ref><ref>[http://valleywag.com/tech/deals/how-much-is-digg-worth-320552.php Valleywag:] How Much is Digg Worth</ref><ref name=biz20/> The site earns revenue from [[internet marketing|advertising]] and membership to its TotalFark program.<ref name=npr>{{cite news

  | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10009173
  | accessdate = 2008-06-06}}</ref> It was the first [[Indie (culture)|indie]] blog to earn one million dollars a year in profit<ref name=biz20/> and its [[classifieds]] section alone generates as much as $40,000 per year.<ref name=npr/> Technology writer [[Mathew Ingram]] described Fark.com as "staggeringly successful" and noted the disparity between Fark's revenue and the amount of press given to sites like [[Digg]].<ref name=ingram/> Fark has also spoken about its steady, above average [[Cost per impression|CPMs]].<ref name=inside/>

Although Fark is a million dollar business, Drew takes a yearly salary of $60,000.<ref name=npr/> The rest of the money goes to the site's legal 'war chest' and to pay other expenses.<ref name=npr/> Additionally, Fark has been known to turn down advertising that interrupts the user experience such as [[pop-up ad|pop ups]] or ads with sound.<ref name=calcomment/> According to Drew Curtis, in 2002 he rejected a "six figure" advertising deal that he felt would have "made the site suck".<ref name=calcomment/>

===Future plans===
In fall of 2008, Curtis plans to launch Farkit.com, a pure news aggregator.<ref name=inside/> Curtis states that the site will be based more heavily on user submission and voting rather than administrative selection. Curtis has also mentioned plans to start a travel site based on the data compiled by Total Farkers.<ref name=inside/>

==Features==
===Tags===
Submitters can give stories several different [[Tag (metadata)|tags]] such as ''stupid'', ''interesting'', ''obvious'', or ''dumbass''. Tags that say ''photoshop'', ''audioedit'' or ''videoedit'' are used for threads where digital content is edited for a humorous or artistic effect. In addition, the ''newsflash'' tag is used for news which is a matter of important breaking news, and an email is sent to the administrators notifying them that someone has submitted a ''Newsflash''. Members are told to use this tag very sparingly and only for matters of extremely important breaking news. (In fact, members who submit ''Newsflash'' tags for subjects obviously not worthy of the tag &mdash; e.g. celebrity news or political commentary &mdash; can be suspended for a period of time).

So many headlines were contributed about the state of [[Florida]] that a ''Florida'' tag was created.<ref>[http://www2.tbo.com/content/2007/aug/09/na-florida-seen-as-fiesta-of-weirdness/ Florida Seen As "Fiesta of Weirdness"] on Tampa Bay Online</ref><ref>[http://www.sptimes.com/2005/06/03/Floridian/Gathering_to_embrace_.shtml Floridian: Gathering to embrace the power of the Fark Side] on tampabay.com</ref>  Similarly, articles discussing [[Wil Wheaton]] &mdash; a Fark user himself &mdash; are given the ''Wheaton'' tag and articles discussing [[Christopher Walken]] are occasionally given the ''Walken'' tag, though Walken has never participated on Fark.

In August 2008 Fark introduced the new ''[[FAIL#Fail_Internet_meme|fail]]'' tag, for submitted articles where the subject does something ignorant or when a major gaffe occurs.<ref>http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=3813171</ref>

===Photoshop contests===
Fark.com also features regular "[[Photoshop contest]]s" where users use a graphical editing program (such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], from which the contest draws its name) to manipulate an image provided by the creator of the contest. The image is usually manipulated for humorous effect, but can also be edited to create an aesthetically-pleasing image or to showcase a poster's image manipulation skill.

===Total Fark===
In February 2002 Fark.com founder Drew Curtis introduced TotalFark.com as a [[Subscription business model|subscription service]], charging US$5 per month, a fee which has remained unchanged. It has an estimated 8,000-10,000 subscribers, which generate $120,000 per year.<ref name=npr/> Subscribers, known collectively as TotalFarkers or TFers, have the privilege of seeing and commenting on all links submitted by Fark.com users, as opposed to only those approved for inclusion on Fark.com's main page. In a typical 24-hour period, TotalFark's main page includes 2,600 links with associated comment threads, whereas Fark's main page includes only 60 to 80 links from among this number. TotalFarkers are able to give TotalFark subscriptions for non-subscribing Fark users.

===Foobies===
In [[2006]], Curtis launched Foobies<ref>[http://www.foobies.com/archives/ Foobies.com] Archives</ref> as a [[NSFW]] (not safe for work) offshoot of Fark.<ref>[http://mashable.com/2007/12/07/fark-trademark-nsfw/ Can Fark Trademark NSFW?] Mashable Social Networking News, December 7, 2007</ref> Curtis sells NSFW links through Foobies at a price of $400.<ref>[http://www.calacanis.com/2004/08/02/fark-com-sells-their-editorial-and-the-loyalty-of-their-users/#c3594703 Fark.com sells their editorial and the loyalty of their users] Comment#7 by Drew Curtis</ref><ref>[http://www.fark.com/farq/about.shtml#What_is_Foobies.3F Fark.com Frequently Asked Questions] What is Foobies?</ref>

==Controversies==
===Redesign===
On [[April 25]], [[2007]], a new design for the website was published.  The new design was received with some controversy due to a number of issues, including a change in layout and a seemingly indifferent attitude by site moderators to user impact or feedback. The launch was announced with the simple Fark caption "Fark site redesign is now live. Hope nothing breaks, we're all out drinking."<ref>[http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=2762299#c29867598 FARK PSA] "Fark site..."</ref> Longtime [[system administrator|site administrator]] Jeff responded to user complaints by saying that they would "get over it",<ref Name="Jeff"><U+201C>[http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=2762299#c29867598 Fark site redesign is now live.

[[April 26]], [[2007]]  Retrieved on [[May 4]], [[2007]].</ref> After complaints about his comment, he subsequently issued an apology via Curtis and took an extended break from website administration.<ref name=JeffTwo/>  During the days following the redesign, the site layout was fine tuned based on suggestions.

===Political bias===
To dispute claims of political bias, Curtis has stated that rather than trying to keep it in the middle, admins enjoy running both [[left-wing politics|far-left]] and [[right-wing politics|far-right]] articles.<ref name=badmouth/> The top four hated <U+201C>groups<U+201D> on Fark.com are (in no particular order) [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]], [[Holy Orders|Catholic priests]], the [[French people|French]], and [[Duke University]], according to Curtis. This could be anecdotally extended to 'crotchfruit' and theists. <ref>Why, Joel. <U+201C>[http://www.newmoanyeah.com/2003-features/120103_interview_with_drew_curtis.php?content=2003&section=features&title=120103_interview_with_drew_curtis&vo=83 Interview with Drew Curtis, FARKin' Genius] .<U+201D> ''[http://www.newmoanyeah.com/ Newmoanyeah].'' [[December 1]], [[2003]]. Retrieved [[June 8]], [[2006]].</ref>

===Preferential placement===
Fark has been accused of selling preferential placement of story links on the main page. The accusation stemmed from an exchange between [[Mahalo]] [[CEO]] [[Jason Calacanis]] and third party sales employee Gogi Gupta, where Gupta claimed Calacanis could buy an editorial on Fark for $300 to $400.<ref name=Calacanis>[http://www.calacanis.com/2004/08/02/fark-com-sells-their-editorial-and-the-loyalty-of-their-users/ Fark.com sells their editorial and the loyalty of their users] calcanis.com, August 2, 2004</ref> Curtis dismissed the incident as the result of an overenthusiastic [[sales]]person, and subsequently fired Gupta.<ref name=Wired> Terdiman, Daniel [http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2004/08/64472  Fark Sells Out. France Surrenders] Wired.com, August 6, 2004</ref> Gupta worked for a company called Gupta Media and according to Curtis did not have the authority to speak for the company.<ref name=calcomment>[http://www.calacanis.com/2004/08/02/fark-com-sells-their-editorial-and-the-loyalty-of-their-users/#c3594703 Drew Curtis comment on Calacanis.com] Posted at 4:40PM on Oct 29th 2005</ref> Curtis stated that the issue could have been resolved through direct conversation with Calacanis and himself and that Calacanis' post was purposefully aimed at creating a "dramatic incident."<ref name=calcomment/>

Fark does sell paid placement for pornography as an attempt to enforce its ban on [[hardcore pornography]].<ref name=calcomment/> By selling links, the company claims it can avoid a [[bait and switch]] where the content of a submitted link is changed after being greenlighted.<ref name=calcomment/>

==Other projects==
=== Fark TV ===
In January 2007, Fark launched Fark TV.<ref>[http://www.superdeluxe.com/sd/artist/fark_tv/ FARK TV] on SuperDeluxe.com</ref><ref name=boing>{{cite web

{{main|It's Not News, It's FARK}}
In 2007, Curtis penned '''''It's Not News, It's Fark: How Mass Media Tries to Pass off Crap as News''''', a critical look at the [[Mass Media]] industry and the go-to stories used when there is a lack of hard news to report.<ref>{{cite book |last=Curtis|first=Drew |title=It's Not News, It's Fark: How Mass Media Tries to Pass Off Crap as News |publisher= Gotham Books |year=2007 |isbn=978159240366}}</ref> It peaked at #12 on [[Amazon.com]]'s [[non-fiction]] bestseller list<ref>[http://www.leighbureau.com/speaker.asp?id=405 Bio:] Drew Curtis for Leigh Speakers Bureau</ref> and was reviewed positively by [[Stephen King]], [[Dave Barry]], and Chez Pazienza <U+2014> a [[CNN]] [[television producer|producer]].<ref>[http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512xyOBU1zL._SL500_AA240_.jpg Cover of ''It's Not News, It's Fark''] UK edition</ref><ref>[http://www.fark.com/2007/book/ Fark.com] INNIF page</ref>

==In popular culture==
As the site has gained in popularity, Fark has appeared numerous times in pop culture.
