'''William Hillcourt''' (August 6, 1900 &ndash; November 9, 1992), also popularly known within the Scouting movement as '''"Green Bar Bill"''' and '''"Scoutmaster to the World"''', was an influential leader in the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) organization for much of the twentieth century, acclaimed as "the foremost influence on development of the Boy Scouting program".<ref name=Peterson85>{{cite journal |last=Peterson |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert W. Peterson (writer)|title=Bill Hillcourt&mdash;Still Going Strong on the Scouting Trail |journal=Scouting | month=September | year=1985 |pages=p. 26 }}</ref> Hillcourt is especially noted as a writer and teacher in the areas of woodcraft, troop and patrol structure, and training. He was a prolific writer; his works include three editions of the BSA's widely-circulated official [[Boy Scout Handbook]], with over 12.6&nbsp;million copies printed. Hillcourt developed and promoted the American adaptation of the [[Wood Badge]] program, the premier adult leader training program of [[Scouting]].

Hillcourt was [[Danish people|Danish]], but moved to the [[United States]] as a young adult and worked for the BSA. From his start in Danish Scouting in 1910 though his death in 1992, he was continuously active in Scouting. He traveled all over the world teaching and training both [[Boy Scout|Scouts]] and [[Scouter]]s, earning many of Scouting's highest honors. His legacy and influence can still be seen today in the BSA program and in Scouting training manuals and methods for both youth and adults.

==Personal life==
Hillcourt was born in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]] in 1900 under the name Vilhelm Hans Bjerregaard Jensen. Around 1930, he changed his name by anglicizing "Vilhelm", dropping "Jensen", and translating "Bjerregaard" into "Hill-court". The youngest of three sons of a building contractor, his first published work was a poem about trolls and elves, printed by an Aarhus newspaper when he was nine years old.<ref name=Peterson85 /> For Christmas 1910, Hillcourt's brother gave him a Danish translation of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell's]] ''[[Scouting for Boys]]''. Baden-Powell, who was the founder of the [[Scouting|Scout movement]], and Hillcourt would later work together. He went on to earn the highest rank in Danish Scouting, Knight-Scout, at age 17. After moving to America, he also earned the BSA's highest rank, [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]; until the 1960s, adults could earn merit badges and ranks. He was selected to represent his troop at the [[1st World Scout Jamboree]] in [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] in 1920 where he first met Baden-Powell.<ref name="peterson">{{cite journal | last = Peterson | first = Robert | title = America's Best-Known Scouter | journal = Scouting | date = January-February 2001 | url = http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0101/d-wwas.html | accessdate = 2008-02-03}}</ref><ref name="block">{{cite journal | url = http://www.trussel.com/prehist/crump/hillcour.htm | title = William Hillcourt 'Scoutmaster to the World' | accessdate = 2008-02-03 | last = Block | first = Nelson | year = 1993 | journal = The Journal of Scouting History}}</ref>

While Hillcourt studied [[pharmacy]] in [[Copenhagen]], he became more involved in Scouting. As a [[Scout leader]], he became a Scoutmaster, national instructor, writer and then the editor for the Danish Scouting journal. He also wrote his first book, ''The Island'', recounting his early Scouting experiences.<ref name="block"/> Hillcourt's troop was set to participate in the [[2nd World Scout Jamboree]] in [[Ermelunden, Denmark]] when he obtained a position as a [[journalist]] covering the jamboree.

West (Scouting)|James West]].<ref name="block" />

==Scouting career==
Hillcourt worked at a BSA camp at Bear Mountain in [[Harriman State Park]], [[New York]] in 1926, where he became an instructor in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] dance.<ref name="serendip"/><ref name="nyt1979">{{cite journal |last=van Gelder |first=Lawrence |title=A Work of Love for 'Boy Scout,' 78 |journal=[[The New York Times]] |date=1979-02-04 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=F60D10F7395511728DDDAD0894DA405B898BF1D3 |accessdate=2008-02-04 }}</ref> He then worked for the BSA Supply Division where he broke his leg when a crate fell on him. He met James West while working at the national office.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rowan, Edward L. |title=James E. West and the History of the Boy Scouts of America |publisher=Las Vegas International Scouting Museum | year=2005 |isbn=0-9746479-1-8 }}</ref> West solicited Hillcourt's thoughts on Scouting in the U.S. Hillcourt later sent West an 18-page memo detailing issues with the lack of patrol structure and leadership. He recommended that the BSA write a handbook for patrol leaders, and that it needed to be written by someone who had been both a patrol leader and a [[Scoutmaster]]. West hired Hillcourt as a writer and editor and was later persuaded to commission Hillcourt to write the first ''Handbook for Patrol Leaders''.<ref name="block" />

From 1932 until his retirement in 1965, Hillcourt became a major contributor to ''[[Boys' Life]]'', the magazine for Scouting youth. Each monthly issue included a page on advancement and [[Scoutcraft]], outdoor Scouting skills, and included his signature superimposed over the two green bars that are the emblem of the patrol leader, which led to his moniker "Green Bar Bill" and its adoption as the logo of his regular ''Boys' Life'' column.<ref name=Peterson85 /><ref name="block" />

Hillcourt was tasked to write a new manual for Scoutmasters in 1934 and worked with his good friend and colleague [[E. Urner Goodman]], the national program director of the BSA. He and his wife moved to a house in [[Mendham Borough, New Jersey]] to be near [[Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation|Schiff Scout Reservation]],<ref name="obit">{{cite news|accessdate=2008-02-19

In order to do so, he founded Troop 1 of Mendham in 1935 as a unit directly chartered to the National Council of the BSA. As the Scoutmaster, he used Troop 1 to test and validate his work for 16&nbsp;years.<ref name=Holleran />

The Baden-Powells visited Schiff in 1935 and began a steadfast friendship with the Hillcourts. Baden-Powell died in 1941; after [[World War II]], [[Olave Baden-Powell]], widow of Robert Baden-Powell, allowed Hillcourt to edit ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' and ''Aids to Scoutmastership '' into the World Brotherhood Editions to help the Scouting movement recover from the war. She then allowed Hillcourt access to all of Baden-Powell's letters, diaries and sketchbooks when she and Hillcourt co-authored the narrative biography of Baden-Powell, ''Baden-Powell: The Two Lives of a Hero''.<ref name = "block"/><ref name="two lives">{{cite book |author=Hillcourt, William; Baden-Powell, Olave |title=Baden-Powell: The Two Lives of a Hero |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |location=Irving, Texas |year=1964 |isbn=0-8395-3594-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Johnny|url=http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/books.htm |publisher="Johnny Walker's" Scouting Milestones |title=Bibliography |accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref> The national office moved from [[New York City]] to [[North Brunswick, New Jersey]] in 1954, and the Hillcourts moved with it.

===Wood Badge===
To encourage the creation of [[Rover Scout|Rovering]] in the U.S., [[J. S. Wilson]] travelled from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to oversee a [[Wood Badge]] course in May 1936 at Schiff. Hillcourt was a participant in that first course and four days later, he was the senior patrol leader for the second course. He received his Wood Badge beads in 1939 and was appointed as the deputy camp director for Wood Badge. After [[World War II]], Wood Badge was revived and Hillcourt was the Scoutmaster for a test course at Schiff and the first standard course at [[Philmont Scout Ranch]]. As the national director of training, Hillcourt wore five Wood Badge beads, a tradition that has been discontinued.<ref name="wborg">{{cite web|url=http://www.woodbadge.org/wbgbbWB.htm |work=Wood Badge history|title='Green Bar Bill' and Wood Badge|accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Johnny|url=http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/woodbadge.htm |publisher="Johnny Walker's" Scouting Milestones |title=The origins of the Wood Badge|accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref>

==Later life==
[[Image:GreenBarBill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hillcourt later in life]]<!--Fair Use image, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:GreenBarBill.jpg-->

Hillcourt retired from the BSA on August 1, 1965. In 1971, he and Grace finally completed the world tour he had started in 1926; along the way they attended the [[13th World Scout Jamboree]] in [[Fujinomiya, Shizuoka|Fujinomiya, Japan]]. Grace Hillcourt died in 1973.<ref name="serendip" />

The BSA had introduced the Improved Scouting Program in 1972, along with a new edition of the ''Boy Scout Handbook''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Peterson, Robert W. |title=The Boy Scouts: An American Adventure |publisher=American Heritage | year=1984 |isbn=0-8281-1173-1 }}</ref> Many of the changes were intended to expand Scouting to a broader base of youth and to make Scouting more "in tune with the times".<ref name="peterson" /> Many Scouters, including Hillcourt, were critical of the new program changes, exclaiming that the de-emphasis on traditional outdoor skills had taken the "outing out of Scouting".<ref name=Peterson85 /> To remedy this situation, Hillcourt convinced Chief Scout Executive [[Harvey L. Price]] that a new handbook was needed. Hillcourt then came out of retirement and spent a year writing and editing the 1979 edition of ''The Official Boy Scout Handbook'', returning to the focus of [[Scoutcraft]].<ref name=Peterson85 /> In addition, he helped to develop the All Out for Scouting program that launched the return to the old standards.<ref name="peterson" />

Hillcourt was recognized for his service to youth by the BSA with the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] on May 19, 1978.<ref name="HillcourtDESA">{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-529.aspx |title=Distinguished Eagle Scout Award |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-05-30}}</ref> In 1980, the BSA presented Hillcourt with their highest national honor, the [[Silver Buffalo Award]] and was cited as "The Voice of Scouting".<ref name="HillcourtSBA">{{cite web |url =http://www.scouting.org/Awards/SilverBuffalo.aspx|title =2007 Silver Buffalo Awards for Distinguished Service to Youth on a National Level |publisher =Boy Scouts of America |accessdate =2008-02-06}}</ref> The World Scout Committee of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] recognized him for exceptional services to world Scouting in 1985 with the [[Bronze Wolf]] award. In 1990 he also became a [[Firecrafter]], an American Scouting service organization. Travel and appearances at Scouting events both local and worldwide were part of his routine until he died, earning him the [[sobriquet]] ''Scoutmaster to the World''.<ref name="block"/>

Hillcourt died in Europe while on a Scouting tour in 1992. He is buried with his wife Grace in St. Joseph's Cemetery in Mendham, New Jersey at Row 8, Block I.<ref name="cemetery">{{cite web |last=Murphy |first=Kevin |year=2001 |url=http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/nj/morris/cemeteries/stjoseph.txt |title=Readable Graves in St. Joseph Cemetery |publisher=St Joseph's Catholic Church Cemetery |accessdate=2006-08-03}}</ref> His legacy in Scouting and his influence continue in the programs and training of Scouting.<ref name="randywoo">{{Cite web |title=Green Bar Bill Hillcourt |work= The Ultimate Boy Scouts of America History Site|publisher= Randy Woo |url=http://users.aol.com/randywoo/bsahis/bill.htm |accessdate=2008-02-15}}</ref><ref name="bootsandblisters">{{cite journal | last = Gardner| first = Lew | title = Green Bar Bill Passes at Age 92 | journal = Boots and Blisters | date = Issue 75, Spring 1993 | url = http://www.bootsandblisters.com/1993/75_spring93.html | accessdate = 2008-02-03}}</ref> Consequently, his writings are still used within the Scouting movement and his material continues to be reprinted in Scouting magazine.<ref name="archives">{{Cite journal |title=Archives |journal=Scouting |accessdate=2008-02-05 |url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/archives/greenbar.html}}</ref> The Hiawatha Seaway Council operates the William Hillcourt Scout Museum at Camp Woodland in New York to "keep the traditions of Scouting alive" through the preservation of the history that is a foundation for today's Scouting movement.<ref name="hillmuseum">{{Cite web |title=Hillcourt Museum |publisher=Hiawatha Seaway Council |url= http://www.cnyscouts.org/about/museum.html|accessdate=2008-02-08 }}</ref>
