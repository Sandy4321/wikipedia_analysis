Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. ''Gitanjali'' (''Song Offerings''), ''[[Gora (novel)|Gora]]'' (''Fair-Faced'') and ''Ghare-Baire'' (''[[The Home and the World]]'') are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed<U+2014>or panned<U+2014>for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: [[India]]'s ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' and [[Bangladesh]]'s ''[[Amar Shonar Bangla]]''.

==Early life: 1861<U+2013>1878==
{{Main|Early life of Rabindranath Tagore}}

The youngest of thirteen surviving children, Tagore was born in the [[Jorasanko Thakur Bari|Jorasanko mansion]] in [[Calcutta]], [[India]] to parents [[Debendranath Tagore]] (1817<U+2013>1905) and Sarada Devi (1830<U+2013>1875).{{Cref|<U+03B5>}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=37}}
The [[Tagore family]] came into prominence during the Bengal Renaissance that started during the age of Hussein Shah (1493<U+2013>1519). The original name of the [[Tagore family]] was [[Banerjee]]. Being Brahmins, their ancestors were referred to as 'Thakurmashai' or 'Holy Sir'. During the British rule, this name stuck and they began to be recognised as Thakur and eventually the family name got anglicised to Tagore.[[Tagore family]] patriarchs were the [[Brahmo]] founders of the [[Adi Dharm]] faith. The loyalist "Prince" [[Dwarkanath Tagore]], who employed European estate managers and visited with [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] and other royalty, was his paternal grandfather.{{Sfn|The News Today|2011}} Debendranath had formulated the Brahmoist philosophies espoused by his friend [[Ram Mohan Roy]], and became focal in Brahmo society after Roy's death.{{Sfn|Roy|1977|pp=28<U+2013>30}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|pp=8<U+2013>9}}

"Rabi" was raised mostly by servants; his mother had died in his early childhood and his father travelled widely.{{Sfn|Thompson|1926|p=20}} His home hosted the publication of literary magazines; theatre and recitals of both Bengali and Western classical music featured there regularly, as the Jorasanko Tagores were the center of a large and art-loving social group. Tagore's oldest brother [[Dwijendranath Tagore|Dwijendranath]] was a respected philosopher and poet. Another brother, [[Satyendranath Tagore|Satyendranath]], was the first Indian appointed to the elite and formerly all-European [[Indian Civil Service]]. Yet another brother, [[Jyotirindranath Tagore|Jyotirindranath]], was a musician, composer, and playwright.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=10}} His sister [[Swarnakumari Devi|Swarnakumari]] became a novelist. Jyotirindranath's wife [[Kadambari Devi|Kadambari]], slightly older than Tagore, was a dear friend and powerful influence. Her abrupt suicide in 1884, soon after he married, left him for years profoundly distraught.

Tagore largely avoided classroom schooling and preferred to roam the manor or nearby [[Bolpur]] and [[Panihati]], idylls which the family visited.{{Sfn|Thompson|1926|pp=21<U+2013>24}}{{Sfn|Das|2009}} His brother Hemendranath tutored and physically conditioned him<U+2014>by having him swim the Ganges or trek through hills, by gymnastics, and by practising judo and wrestling. He learned drawing, anatomy, geography and history, literature, mathematics, Sanskrit, and English<U+2014>his least favourite subject.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=48<U+2013>49}} Tagore loathed formal education<U+2014>his scholarly travails at the local [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]] spanned a single day. Years later he held that proper teaching does not explain things; proper teaching stokes curiosity:{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=50}}

For what happens within is much bigger than what comes out in words. Those who pin their faith on university examinations as the test of education take no account of this.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=50}}}}

After he underwent an ''[[upanayanam|upanayan]]'' initiation at age eleven, he and his father left Calcutta in <!--14 -->February 1873 for a months-long tour of the Raj. They visited his father's [[Santiniketan]] estate and rested in [[Amritsar]] en route to the Himalayan Dhauladhars, their destination being the remote hill station at [[Dalhousie, India|Dalhousie]]. Along the way, Tagore read biographies; his father tutored him in history, astronomy, and Sanskrit declensions. He read biographies of [[Benjamin Franklin]] among other figures; they discussed [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''; and they examined the poetry of {{Unicode|[[K<U+0101>lid<U+0101>sa]]}}.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=54<U+2013>55}} In mid-April they reached the station, and at {{Convert|2300|m|ft|0}} they settled into a house that sat atop Bakrota Hill. Tagore was taken aback by the region's deep green gorges, alpine forests, and mossy streams and waterfalls.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=55}} They stayed there for several months and adopted a regime of study and privation that included daily twilight baths taken in icy water.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=55<U+2013>56}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=91}}

He returned to Jorosanko and completed a set of major works by 1877, one of them a long poem in the [[Maithili language|Maithili]] style of [[Vidyapati]]; they were published pseudonymously. Regional experts accepted them as the lost works of [[Bh<U+0101>nusi<U+1E43>ha <U+1E6C>h<U+0101>kurer Pa<U+1E0D><U+0101>val<U+012B>|Bh<U+0101>nusimha]], a newly discovered{{Cref|<U+03B6>}} 17th-century {{Unicode|[[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]]}} poet.{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=3}} He debuted the short-story genre in Bengali with "Bhikharini" ("The Beggar Woman"),{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=45}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=265}} and his ''Sandhya Sangit'' (1882) includes the famous poem "Nirjharer Swapnabhanga" ("The Rousing of the Waterfall"). Servants subjected him to an almost ludicrous regimentation in a phase he dryly reviled as the "servocracy".{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|pp=46<U+2013>47}} His head was water-dunked<U+2014>to quiet him.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=47}} He irked his servants by refusing food; he was confined to chalk circles in parody of [[Sita]]'s forest trial in the ''[[Ramayana]]''; and he was regaled with the heroic criminal exploits of Bengal's outlaw-''[[dacoity|dacoits]]''.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|pp=47<U+2013>48}} Because the Jorasanko manor was in an area of north Calcutta rife with poverty and prostitution,{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=35}} he was forbidden to leave it for any purpose other than travelling to school. He thus became preoccupied with the world outside and with nature. Of his 1873 visit to Santiniketan, he wrote:

{{Cquote|1=What I could not see did not take me long to get over<U+2014>what I did see was quite enough. There was no servant rule, and the only ring which encircled me was the blue of the horizon, drawn around these solitudes by their presiding goddess. Within this I was free to move about as I chose.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=53<U+2013>54}}}}

==Shelaidaha: 1878<U+2013>1901==
Because Debendranath wanted his son to become a barrister, Tagore enrolled at a public school in Brighton, East Sussex, England in 1878.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}} He stayed for several months at a house that the Tagore family owned near [[Brighton]] and [[Hove]], in Medina Villas; in 1877 his nephew and niece<U+2014>Suren and Indira Devi, the children of Tagore's brother [[Satyendranath Tagore|Satyendranath]]<U+2014>were sent together with their mother, Tagore's sister-in-law, to live with him.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=68}} He briefly read law at [[University College London]], but again left school. He opted instead for independent study of [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespeare]], ''[[Religio Medici]]'', ''[[Coriolanus]]'', and ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''. Lively English, Irish, and Scottish folk tunes impressed Tagore, whose own tradition of [[Nidhu Babu|Nidhubabu]]-authored ''kirtans'' and ''[[tappa]]s'' and Brahmo hymnody was subdued.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}}{{Sfn|Thompson|1926|p=31}} In 1880 he returned to Bengal degree-less, resolving to reconcile European novelty with Brahmo traditions, taking the best from each.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|pp=11<U+2013>12}} In 1883 he married Mrinalini Devi, born Bhabatarini, 1873<U+2013>1902; they had five children, two of whom died in childhood.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=373}}

In 1890 Tagore began managing his vast ancestral estates in [[Shelaidaha]] (today a region of [[Bangladesh]]); he was joined by his wife and children in 1898. Tagore released his ''Manasi'' poems (1890), among his best-known work.{{Sfn|Scott|2009|p=10}} As ''[[Zamindar]] Babu'', Tagore criss-crossed the riverine holdings in command of the ''Padma'', the luxurious family barge. He collected mostly token rents and blessed villagers who in turn honoured him with banquets<U+2014>occasionally of dried rice and sour milk.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=109<U+2013>111}} He met [[Gagan Harkara]], through whom he became familiar with [[Baul]] [[Lalon Shah]], whose folk songs greatly influenced Tagore.<ref>{{Citation|last=Chowdury|first=A. A.|year=1992|title=Lalon Shah|publisher=Bangla Academy|place=Dhaka, Bangladesh|isbn=984-07-2597-1}}</ref> Tagore worked to popularise Lalon's songs. The period 1891<U+2013>1895, Tagore's ''Sadhana'' period, named after one of Tagore's magazines, was his most productive;{{Sfn|Thompson|1926|p=20}} in these years he wrote more than half the stories of the three-volume, 84-story ''Galpaguchchha''.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=45}} Its ironic and grave tales examined the voluptuous poverty of an idealised rural Bengal.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=109}}

==Santiniketan: 1901<U+2013>1932==
{{Main|Middle years of Rabindranath Tagore}}

In 1901 Tagore moved to [[Santiniketan]] to found an [[ashram]] with a marble-floored prayer hall<U+2014>''The [[:wikt:Mandir|Mandir]]''<U+2014>an experimental school, groves of trees, gardens, a library.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=133}} There his wife and two of his children died. His father died in <!--19 January -->1905. He received monthly payments as part of his inheritance and income from the Maharaja of Tripura, sales of his family's jewellery, his seaside bungalow in [[Puri]], and a derisory 2,000 rupees in book royalties.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=139<U+2013>140}} He gained Bengali and foreign readers alike; he published ''[[Naivedya]]'' (1901) and ''Kheya'' (1906) and translated poems into free verse.

In November 1913, Tagore learned he had won that year's Nobel Prize in Literature: the [[Swedish Academy]] appreciated the idealistic<U+2014>and for Westerners<U+2014>accessible nature of a small body of his translated material focussed on the 1912 ''[[Gitanjali]]: Song Offerings''.{{Sfn|Hj<U+00E4>rne|1913}} In 1915, the British Crown granted Tagore a knighthood. He renounced it after the 1919 [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]].

In 1921, Tagore and agricultural economist [[Leonard Knight Elmhirst|Leonard Elmhirst]] set up the "Institute for Rural Reconstruction", later renamed Shriniketan or "Abode of Welfare", in [[Surul]], a village near the ''ashram''. With it, Tagore sought to moderate [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi's]] ''[[Swaraj]]'' protests, which he occasionally blamed for British India's perceived mental<U+2014>and thus ultimately colonial<U+2014>decline.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=239<U+2013>240}} He sought aid from donors, officials, and scholars worldwide to "free village[s] from the shackles of helplessness and ignorance" by "vitalis[ing] knowledge".{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=242}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=308<U+2013>309}} In the early 1930s he targeted ambient "abnormal caste consciousness" and [[untouchability]]. He lectured against these, he penned [[Dalit]] heroes for his poems and his dramas, and he campaigned<U+2014>successfully<U+2014>to open [[Guruvayoor Temple]] to Dalits.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=303}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=309}}

==Twilight years: 1932<U+2013>1941==
{{Main|Latter life of Rabindranath Tagore}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11643, Rabindranath Tagore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Germany, 1931.]]

Tagore's life as a "peripatetic litterateur" affirmed his opinion that human divisions were shallow. During a May 1932 visit to a Bedouin encampment in the Iraqi desert, the tribal chief told him that "Our prophet has said that a true Muslim is he by whose words and deeds not the least of his brother-men may ever come to any harm ..." Tagore confided in his diary: "I was startled into recognizing in his words the voice of essential humanity."{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=317}} To the end Tagore scrutinised orthodoxy<U+2014>and in 1934, he struck. That year, an earthquake hit Bihar and killed thousands. Gandhi hailed it as seismic ''[[karma]]'', as divine retribution avenging the oppression of Dalits. Tagore rebuked him for his seemingly ignominious inferences.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=312<U+2013>313}} He mourned the perennial poverty of Calcutta and the socioeconomic decline of Bengal. He detailed these newly plebeian aesthetics in an unrhymed hundred-line poem whose technique of searing double-vision foreshadowed [[Satyajit Ray]]'s film ''[[Apur Sansar (The World of Apu)|Apur Sansar]]''.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=335<U+2013>338}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=342}} Fifteen new volumes appeared, among them prose-poem works ''Punashcha'' (1932), ''Shes Saptak'' (1935), and ''Patraput'' (1936). Experimentation continued in his prose-songs and dance-dramas: ''[[Chitra (play)|Chitra]]<!--ngada-->'' (1914), ''Shyama'' (1939), and ''Chandalika'' (1938); and in his novels: ''Dui Bon'' (1933), ''Malancha'' (1934), and ''Char Adhyay'' (1934).

Tagore's remit expanded to science in his last years, as hinted in ''Visva-Parichay'', 1937 collection of essays. His respect for scientific laws and his exploration of biology, physics, and astronomy informed his poetry, which exhibited extensive naturalism and verisimilitude.{{Sfn|Tagore|Radice|2004|p=28}} He wove the ''process'' of science, the narratives of scientists, into stories in ''Se'' (1937), ''Tin Sangi'' (1940), and ''Galpasalpa'' (1941). His last five years were marked by chronic pain and two long periods of illness. These began when Tagore lost consciousness in late 1937; he remained comatose and near death for a time. This was followed in late 1940 by a similar spell. He never recovered. Poetry from these valetudinary years is among his finest.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=338}}{{Sfn|Indo-Asian News Service|2005}} A period of prolonged agony ended with Tagore's death on 7 August 1941, aged eighty; he was in an upstairs room of the Jorasanko mansion he was raised in.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=367}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=363}} The date is still mourned.{{Sfn|The Daily Star|2009}} A.

On 14 July 1927 Tagore and two companions began a four-month tour of Southeast Asia. They visited Bali, Java, Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Penang, Siam, and Singapore.

Vice-President of India M. [[Hamid Ansari]] has said that Rabindranath Tagore heralded the cultural rapprochement between communities, societies and nations much before it became the liberal norm of conduct.
Tagore was a man ahead of his time. He wrote in 1932, while on a visit to Iran, that "each country of Asia will solve its own historical problems according to its strength, nature and needs, but the lamp they will each carry on their path to progress will converge to illuminate the common ray of knowledge."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newkerala.com/news/newsplus/worldnews-17033.html#.T8iO5bBDxrc |title=Vice President speaks on Rabindranath Tagore &#124; 17033 |publisher=Newkerala.com |date= |accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref>
His ideas on culture, gender, poverty, education, freedom, and a resurgent Asia remain relevant today.

Known mostly for his poetry, Tagore wrote novels, essays, short stories, travelogues, dramas, and thousands of songs. Of Tagore's prose, his short stories are perhaps most highly regarded; he is indeed credited with originating the Bengali-language version of the genre. His works are frequently noted for their rhythmic, optimistic, and lyrical nature. Such stories mostly borrow from deceptively simple subject matter: commoners. Tagore's non-fiction grappled with history, linguistics, and spirituality. He wrote autobiographies. His travelogues, essays, and lectures were compiled into several volumes, including ''Europe Jatrir Patro'' (''Letters from Europe'') and ''Manusher Dhormo'' (''[[The Religion of Man]]''). His brief chat with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], "Note on the Nature of Reality", is included as an appendix to the latter. On the occasion of Tagore's 150th birthday an anthology (titled ''Kalanukromik Rabindra Rachanabali'') of the total body of his works is currently being published in Bengali in chronological order. This includes all versions of each work and fills about eighty volumes.{{Sfn|Pandey|2011}} In 2011, [[Harvard University Press]] collaborated with [[Visva-Bharati University]] to publish ''[[The Essential Tagore]]'', the largest anthology of Tagore's works available in English; it was edited by [[Fakrul Alam]] and [[Radha Chakravarthy]] and marks the 150th anniversary of Tagore's birth.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Essential Tagore|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674057906|accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>

===Music===
Tagore was a prolific composer with 2,230 songs to his credit. His songs are known as ''[[Rabindra Sangeet|rabindrasangit]]'' ("Tagore Song"), which merges fluidly into his literature, most of which<U+2014>poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike<U+2014>were lyricised. Influenced by the ''[[thumri]]'' style of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani music]], they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=94}} They emulated the tonal color of classical ''[[raga]]s'' to varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga's melody and rhythm faithfully; others newly blended elements of different ''ragas''.{{Sfn|Dasgupta|2001}} Yet about nine-tenths of his work was not ''bhanga gaan'', the body of tunes revamped with "fresh value" from select Western, Hindustani, Bengali folk and other regional flavours "external" to Tagore's own ancestral culture.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}} Scholars have attempted to gauge the emotive force and range of Hindustani ''ragas'':

{{Cquote|1=[...] the pathos of the ''purabi raga'' reminded Tagore of the evening tears of a lonely widow, while ''kanara'' was the confused realization of a nocturnal wanderer who had lost his way. In ''bhupali'' he seemed to hear a voice in the wind saying 'stop and come hither'.''Paraj'' conveyed to him the deep slumber that overtook one at night's end.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}}|4=[[Reba Som]]|5=''Rabindranath Tagore: The Singer and His Song''.{{Sfn|Som|2010|p=38}}}}

Tagore influenced ''sitar'' maestro [[Vilayat Khan]] and ''[[sarod]]iyas'' Buddhadev Dasgupta and [[Amjad Ali Khan]].{{Sfn|Dasgupta|2001}} His songs are widely popular and undergird the Bengali ethos to an extent perhaps rivalling Shakespeare's impact on the English-speaking world. It is said that his songs are the outcome of five centuries of Bengali literary churning and communal yearning. [[Dhan Gopal Mukerji]] has said that these songs transcend the mundane to the aesthetic and express all ranges and categories of human emotion. The poet gave voice to all<U+2014>big or small, rich or poor. The poor Ganges boatman and the rich landlord air their emotions in them. They birthed a distinctive school of music whose practitioners can be fiercely traditional: novel interpretations have drawn severe censure in both West Bengal and Bangladesh.

For Bengalis, the songs' appeal, stemming from the combination of emotive strength and beauty described as surpassing even Tagore's poetry, was such that the ''Modern Review'' observed that "[t]here is in Bengal no cultured home where Rabindranath's songs are not sung or at least attempted to be sung ... Even illiterate villagers sing his songs". [[A. H. Fox Strangways]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' introduced non-Bengalis to ''rabindrasangit'' in ''The Music of Hindostan'', calling it a "vehicle of a personality ... [that] go behind this or that system of music to that beauty of sound which all systems put out their hands to seize."{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=359}}

In 1971, ''[[Amar Shonar Bangla]]'' became the national anthem of Bangladesh. It was written<U+2014>ironically<U+2014>to protest the [[1905 Partition of Bengal]] along communal lines: lopping Muslim-majority East Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was to avert a regional bloodbath. Tagore saw the partition as a ploy to upend the [[Indian independence movement|independence movement]], and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar communalism. ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' was written in ''[[shadhu-bhasha]]'', a Sanskritised register of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of a Brahmo hymn that Tagore composed. It was first sung in 1911 at a Calcutta session of the [[Indian National Congress]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Tagore and Jana Gana Mana|url=http://www.countercurrents.org/comm-chatterjee310803.htm|publisher=http://www.countercurrents.org|author=Monish R. Chatterjee|date=13|month=August|year=2003}}</ref> and was adopted in 1950 by the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of India as its national anthem.

===Paintings===

At sixty, Tagore took up drawing and painting; successful exhibitions of his many works<U+2014>which made a debut appearance in Paris upon encouragement by artists he met in the south of France{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=222}}<U+2014>were held throughout Europe. He was likely red-green [[protanopia|color blind]], resulting in works that exhibited strange colour schemes and off-beat aesthetics. Tagore was influenced by scrimshaw from northern [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], [[Haida people|Haida]] carvings from [[British Columbia]], and woodcuts by [[Max Pechstein]].{{Sfn|Dyson|2001}} His artist's eye for his handwriting were revealed in the simple artistic and rhythmic leitmotifs embellishing the scribbles, cross-outs, and word layouts of his manuscripts. Some of Tagore's lyrics corresponded in a synesthetic sense with particular paintings.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}}

  {{Cquote|1=[...]Surrounded by several painters Rabindranath had always wanted to paint. Writing and music, playwriting and acting came to him naturally and almost without training, as it did to several others in his family, and in even greater measure. But painting eluded him. Yet he tried repeatedly to master the art and there are several references to this in his early letters and reminiscence. In 1900 for instance, when he was nearing forty and already a celebrated writer, he wrote to Jagadishchandra Bose, "You will be surprised to hear that I am sitting with a sketchbook drawing. Needless to say, the pictures are not intended for any salon in Paris, they cause me not the least suspicion that the national gallery of any country will suddenly decide to raise taxes to acquire them. But, just as a mother lavishes most affection on her ugliest son, so I feel secretly drawn to the very skill that comes to me least easily.<U+201F> He also realized that he was using the eraser more than the pencil, and dissatisfied with the results he finally withdrew, deciding it was not for him to become a painter.{{Sfn|[[R.

[[Rabindra Chitravali]], edited by noted art historian [[R.

[[The Last Harvest : Paintings of Rabindranath Tagore]] was an exhibition of Rabindranath Tagore's paintings to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore. It was commissioned by the Ministry of Culture, India and organised with NGMA Delhi as the nodal agency. It consisted of 208 paintings drawn from the collections of Visva Bharati and the NGMA and presented Tagore's art in a very comprehensive way. The exhibition was curated by Art Historian [[R.

At sixteen, Tagore led his brother Jyotirindranath's adaptation of [[Moli<U+00E8>re]]'s ''[[Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme]]''.{{Sfn|Lago|1977|p=15}} At twenty he wrote his first drama-opera: ''Valmiki Pratibha'' (''The Genius of Valmiki''). In it the pandit [[Valmiki]] overcomes his sins, is blessed by [[Saraswati]], and compiles the ''[[Ramayana|R<U+0101>m<U+0101>yana]]''.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=123}} Through it Tagore explores a wide range of dramatic styles and emotions, including usage of revamped ''[[kirtan]]s'' and adaptation of traditional English and Irish folk melodies as drinking songs.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=79<U+2013>80}} Another play, ''[[The Post Office (play)|Dak Ghar]]'' (''The Post Office''), describes the child Amal defying his stuffy and puerile confines by ultimately "fall[ing] asleep", hinting his physical death. A story with borderless appeal<U+2014>gleaning rave reviews in Europe<U+2014>''Dak Ghar'' dealt with death as, in Tagore's words, "spiritual freedom" from "the world of hoarded wealth and certified creeds".{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|pp=21<U+2013>23}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|pp=123<U+2013>124}} In the Nazi-besieged [[Warsaw Ghetto]], Polish doctor-educator [[Janusz Korczak]] had orphans in his care stage ''The Post Office'' in <!--18 -->July 1942.{{Sfn|Lifton|Wiesel|1997|p=321}} In ''The King of Children'', biographer Betty Jean Lifton suspected that Korczak, agonising over whether one should determine when and how to die, was easing the children into accepting death.{{Sfn|Lifton|Wiesel|1997|pp=416<U+2013>417}}{{Sfn|Lifton|Wiesel|1997|pp=318<U+2013>321}}{{Sfn|Lifton|Wiesel|1997|pp=385<U+2013>386}} In mid-October, the Nazis sent them to [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]].{{Sfn|Lifton|Wiesel|1997|p=349}}

It may come at any moment of life, though the child discovers it in death, for it always comes at the moment when the "I", seeking no longer for gains that cannot be "assimilated with its spirit", is able to say, "All my work is thine" [...].{{Sfn|Tagore|Mukerjea|1914|pp=v<U+2013>vi}}|4=[[W. B. Yeats]]|5=Preface, ''The Post Office'', 1914.}}

His other works fuse lyrical flow and emotional rhythm into a tight focus on a core idea, a break from prior Bengali drama. Tagore sought "the play of feeling and not of action". In 1890 he released what is regarded as his finest drama: ''Visarjan'' (''Sacrifice'').{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=123}} It is an adaptation of ''Rajarshi'', an earlier novella of his. "A forthright denunciation of a meaningless [and] cruel superstitious rite[s]",{{Sfn|Ayyub|1980|p=48}} the Bengali originals feature intricate subplots and prolonged monologues that give play to historical events in seventeenth-century Udaipur. The devout Maharaja of Tripura is pitted against the wicked head priest Raghupati. His latter dramas were more philosophical and allegorical in nature; these included ''Dak Ghar''. Another is Tagore's ''Chandalika'' (''Untouchable Girl''), which was modelled on an ancient Buddhist legend describing how [[Ananda]], the [[Gautama Buddha]]'s disciple, asks a [[Adivasi|tribal]] girl for water.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=124}}

In ''Raktakarabi'' ("Red" or "Blood Oleanders"), a kleptocrat rules over the residents of ''[[Yaksha]] [[Pur (Vedic)|puri]]''. He and his retainers exploit his subjects<U+2014>who are benumbed by alcohol and numbered like inventory<U+2014>by forcing them to mine gold for him. The naive maiden-heroine Nandini rallies her subject-compatriots to defeat the greed of the realm's ''[[sardar]]'' class<U+2014>with the morally roused king's belated help. Skirting the "good-vs-evil" trope, the work pits a vital and joyous l<U+00E8>se majest<U+00E9> against the monotonous fealty of the king's varletry, giving rise to an allegorical struggle akin to that found in ''[[Animal Farm]]'' or ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.{{Sfn|Ray|2007|pp=147<U+2013>148}} The original, though prized in Bengal, long failed to spawn a "free and comprehensible" translation, and its archaic and sonorous didacticism failed to attract interest from abroad.{{Sfn|O'Connell|2008}} ''Chitrangada'', ''Chandalika'', and ''Shyama'' are other key plays that have dance-drama adaptations, which together are known as ''[[Rabindra Nritya Natya]]''.

===Novels===
Tagore wrote eight novels and four novellas, among them ''Chaturanga'', ''[[Shesher Kobita]]'', ''Char Odhay'', and ''Noukadubi''. ''Ghare Baire'' (''[[The Home and the World]]'')<U+2014>through the lens of the idealistic ''[[zamindar]]'' protagonist Nikhil<U+2014>excoriates rising Indian nationalism, terrorism, and religious zeal in the [[Swadeshi movement|''Swadeshi'' movement]]; a frank expression of Tagore's conflicted sentiments, it emerged from a 1914 bout of depression. The novel ends in Hindu-Muslim violence and Nikhil's<U+2014>likely mortal<U+2014>wounding.{{sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=192<U+2013>194}}

''Gora'' raises controversial questions regarding the Indian identity. As with ''Ghare Baire'', matters of self-identity (''{{Unicode|[[j<U+0101>ti]]}}''), personal freedom, and religion are developed in the context of a family story and love triangle.{{sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=154<U+2013>155}} In it an Irish boy orphaned in the [[Sepoy Mutiny]] is raised by Hindus as the titular ''gora''<U+2014>"whitey". Ignorant of his foreign origins, he chastises Hindu religious backsliders out of love for the indigenous Indians and solidarity with them against his hegemon-compatriots. He falls for a Brahmo girl, compelling his worried foster father to reveal his lost past and cease his nativist zeal. As a "true dialectic" advancing "arguments for and against strict traditionalism", it tackles the colonial conundrum by "portray[ing] the value of all positions within a particular frame [...] not only syncretism, not only liberal orthodoxy, but the extremest reactionary traditionalism he defends by an appeal to what humans share." Among these Tagore highlights "identity [...] conceived of as ''[[dharma]].''"{{Sfn|Hogan|2000|pp=213<U+2013>214}}

In ''[[Jogajog]]'' (''Relationships''), the heroine Kumudini<U+2014>bound by the ideals of ''[[<U+015A>iva]]-[[Dakshayani|Sati]]'', exemplified by {{Unicode|[[Dakshayani|D<U+0101>ksh<U+0101>yani]]}}<U+2014>is torn between her pity for the sinking fortunes of her progressive and compassionate elder brother and his foil: her roue of a husband. Tagore flaunts his feminist leanings; ''pathos'' depicts the plight and ultimate demise of women trapped by pregnancy, duty, and family honour; he simultaneously trucks with Bengal's putrescent landed gentry.{{Sfn|Mukherjee|2004}} The story revolves around the underlying rivalry between two families<U+2014>the Chatterjees, aristocrats now on the decline (Biprodas) and the Ghosals (Madhusudan), representing new money and new arrogance. Kumudini, Biprodas' sister, is caught between the two as she is married off to Madhusudan. She had risen in an observant and sheltered traditional home, as had all her female relations.

Others were uplifting: ''Shesher Kobita''<U+2014>translated twice as ''Last Poem'' and ''Farewell Song''<U+2014>is his most lyrical novel, with poems and rhythmic passages written by a poet protagonist. It contains elements of satire and postmodernism and has stock characters who gleefully attack the reputation of an old, outmoded, oppressively renowned poet who, incidentally, goes by a familiar name: "Rabindranath Tagore". Though his novels remain among the least-appreciated of his works, they have been given renewed attention via film adaptations by Ray and others: ''[[Chokher Bali (film)|Chokher Bali]]'' and ''[[Ghare Baire (film)|Ghare Baire]]'' are exemplary. In the first, Tagore inscribes Bengali society via its heroine: a rebellious widow who would live for herself alone. He pillories the custom of perpetual mourning on the part of widows, who were not allowed to remarry, who were consigned to seclusion and loneliness. Tagore wrote of it: "I have always regretted the ending".<!-- The latter work reveals Tagore's conflicted mind and contrasts the ambiguous benefits of Western culture and revolution against it. These feature in two of the main characters: Nikhil, who is rational and opposes violence; and Sandip, who, as sumpter to his goals, will not be stopped. They provide a lens through which can be understood the history and contemporary problems of Bengal. There is much controversy over whether Tagore was representing Gandhi in Sandip. But many argue that Tagore would not even venture to personify Sandip as Gandhi because Tagore could<U+2014>grudgingly<U+2014>respect Gandhi's pacifist ardor, and Gandhi was sententiously anti-violence while the libertine Sandip would employ violence<U+2014>in any respect<U+2014>to advance his selfish interests.-->

===Stories===


Tagore's three-volume ''Galpaguchchha'' comprises eighty-four stories that reflect upon the author's surroundings, on modern and fashionable ideas, and on mind puzzles.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=45}} Tagore associated his earliest stories, such as those of the "''Sadhana''" period, with an exuberance of vitality and spontaneity; these traits were cultivated by ''zamindar'' Tagore's life in Patisar, Shajadpur, Shelaidaha, and other villages.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=45}} Seeing the common and the poor, he examined their lives with a depth and feeling singular in Indian literature up to that point.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|pp=45<U+2013>46}} In "The Fruitseller from Kabul", Tagore speaks in first person as a town dweller and novelist imputing exotic perquisites to an Afghan seller. He channels the lucubrative lust of those mired in the blas<U+00E9>, nidorous, and sudorific morass of subcontinental city life: for distant vistas. "There were autumn mornings, the time of year when kings of old went forth to conquest; and I, never stirring from my little corner in Calcutta, would let my mind wander over the whole world. At the very name of another country, my heart would go out to it [...] I would fall to weaving a network of dreams: the mountains, the glens, the forest [...]."{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|pp=48<U+2013>49}}

The ''Golpoguchchho'' (''Bunch of Stories'') was written in Tagore's ''Sabuj Patra'' period, which lasted from 1914 to 1917 and was named for another of his magazines.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=45}} These yarns are celebrated fare in Bengali fiction and are commonly used as plot fodder by Bengali film and theatre. The Ray film ''[[Charulata]]'' echoed the controversial Tagore novella ''[[Nastanirh]]'' (''The Broken Nest''). In ''Atithi'', which was made into another film, the little Brahmin boy Tarapada shares a boat ride with a village ''zamindar''. The boy relates his flight from home and his subsequent wanderings. Taking pity, the elder adopts him; he fixes the boy to marry his own daughter. The night before his wedding, Tarapada runs off<U+2014>again. ''Strir Patra'' (''The Wife's Letter'') is an early treatise in female emancipation.{{Sfn|Ray|2007|pp=59<U+2013>60}} Mrinal is wife to a Bengali middle class man: prissy, preening, and patriarchal. Travelling alone she writes a letter, which comprehends the story. She details the pettiness of a life spent entreating his viraginous virility; she ultimately gives up married life, proclaiming, ''Amio bachbo. Ei bachlum'': "And I shall live. Here, I live."

''[[Haimanti]]'' assails Hindu arranged marriage and spotlights their often dismal domesticity, the hypocrisies plaguing the Indian middle classes, and how Haimanti, a young woman, due to her insufferable sensitivity and free spirit, foredid herself. In the last passage Tagore blasts the reification of [[Sita]]'s self-immolation attempt; she had meant to appease her consort [[Rama]]'s doubts of her chastity. ''Musalmani Didi'' eyes recrudescent Hindu-Muslim tensions and, in many ways, embodies the essence of Tagore's humanism. The somewhat auto-referential ''Darpaharan'' describes a fey young man who harbours literary ambitions. Though he loves his wife, he wishes to stifle her literary career, deeming it unfeminine. In youth Tagore likely agreed with him. ''Darpaharan'' depicts the final humbling of the man as he ultimately acknowledges his wife's talents. As do many other Tagore stories, ''Jibito o Mrito'' equips Bengalis with a ubiquitous epigram: ''Kadombini moriya proman korilo she more nai''<U+2014>"Kadombini died, thereby proving that she hadn't."

===Poetry===
Tagore's poetic style, which proceeds from a lineage established by 15th- and 16th-century Vaishnava poets, ranges from classical formalism to the comic, visionary, and ecstatic. He was influenced by the atavistic mysticism of [[Vyasa]] and other ''rishi''-authors of the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Bhakti]]-[[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic [[Kabir]], and [[Ramprasad Sen]].{{Sfn|Roy|1977|p=201}} Tagore's most innovative and mature poetry embodies his exposure to Bengali rural folk music, which included mystic [[Baul]] ballads such as those of the bard [[Lalon]].{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=94}}{{Sfn|Urban|2001|p=18}} These, rediscovered and repopularised by Tagore, resemble 19th-century {{Unicode|Kart<U+0101>bhaj<U+0101>}} hymns that emphasise inward divinity and rebellion against bourgeois ''bhadralok'' religious and social orthodoxy.{{Sfn|Urban|2001|pp=6<U+2013>7}}{{Sfn|Urban|2001|p=16}} During his Shelaidaha years, his poems took on a lyrical voice of the ''moner manush'', the B<U+0101>uls' "man within the heart" and Tagore's "life force of his deep recesses", or meditating upon the ''jeevan devata''<U+2014>the demiurge or the "living God within".{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}} This figure connected with divinity through appeal to nature and the emotional interplay of human drama. Such tools saw use in his {{Unicode|Bh<U+0101>nusi<U+1E43>ha}} poems chronicling the [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]] romance, which were repeatedly revised over the course of seventy years.{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=95}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=7}}

Tagore reacted to the halfhearted uptake of modernist and realist techniques in Bengali literature by writing matching experimental works in the 1930s.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=281}} These include ''Africa'' and ''Camalia'', among the better known of his latter poems. He occasionally wrote poems using ''Shadhu Bhasha'', a Sanskritised dialect of Bengali; he later adopted a more popular dialect known as ''Cholti Bhasha''. Other works include ''Manasi'', ''Sonar Tori'' (''Golden Boat''), ''Balaka'' (''Wild Geese'', a name redolent of migrating souls),{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=192}} and ''Purobi''. ''Sonar Tori'''s most famous poem, dealing with the fleeting endurance of life and achievement, goes by the same name; hauntingly it ends: ''Shunno nodir tire rohinu po<U+0157>i / Jaha chhilo loe g<U+00EA>lo shonar tori''<U+2014>"all I had achieved was carried off on the golden boat<U+2014>only I was left behind." ''Gitanjali'' ({{Lang|bn|<U+0997><U+09C0><U+09A4><U+09BE><U+099E><U+09CD><U+099C><U+09B2><U+09BF>}}) is Tagore's best-known collection internationally, earning him his Nobel.{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|pp=95<U+2013>96}}

{{Cquote|
My song has put off her adornments.<br />
She has no pride of dress and decoration.<br />
Ornaments would mar our union; they would come<br />
between thee and me; their jingling would drown thy whispers.<br />
My poet's vanity dies in shame before thy sight.<br />
O master poet, I have sat down at thy feet.<br />
Only let me make my life simple and straight,<br />
like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music.{{Sfn|Tagore|1952|p=5}}

Tagore's poetry has been set to music by composers: [[Arthur Shepherd]]'s triptych for soprano and string quartet, [[Alexander Zemlinsky]]'s famous [[Lyric Symphony (Zemlinsky)|Lyric Symphony]], [[Josef Bohuslav Foerster]]'s cycle of love songs, [[Leo<U+0161> Jan<U+00E1><U+010D>ek]]'s famous chorus "Potuln<U+00FD> <U+0161><U+00ED>lenec" ("[[The Wandering Madman]]") for soprano, tenor, baritone, and male chorus<U+2014>JW 4/43<U+2014>inspired by Tagore's 1922 lecture in Czechoslovakia which Jan<U+00E1><U+010D>ek attended, and [[Garry Schyman]]'s "[[Stream of Life|Praan]]", an adaptation of Tagore's poem "Stream of Life" from ''Gitanjali''. The latter was composed and recorded with vocals by [[Palbasha Siddique]] to accompany Internet celebrity [[Matt Harding]]'s 2008 viral video.{{Sfn|Harding|2008}} In 1917 his words were translated adeptly and set to music by Anglo-Dutch composer [[Richard Hageman]] to produce a highly regarded art song: "Do Not Go, My Love".<!--(Ed. Schirmer NY 1917)--> The second movement of [[Jonathan Harvey (composer)|Jonathan Harvey]]'s "One Evening" (1994) sets an excerpt beginning "As I was watching the sunrise ..." from a letter of Tagore's, this composer having previously chosen a text by the poet for his piece "Song Offerings" (1985).{{Sfn|Harvey|1999|pp=59, 90}}

He escaped assassination<U+2014>and only narrowly<U+2014>by Indian expatriates during his stay in a San Francisco hotel in late 1916; the plot failed when his would-be assassins fell into argument.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=204}} Yet Tagore wrote songs lionising the Indian independence movement{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=215<U+2013>216}} Two of Tagore's more politically charged compositions, "[[Chitto Jetha Bhayshunyo]]" ("Where the Mind is Without Fear") and "[[Ekla Chalo Re]]" ("If They Answer Not to Thy Call, Walk Alone"), gained mass appeal, with the latter favoured by Gandhi.{{Sfn|Chakraborty|Bhattacharya|2001|p=157}} Though somewhat critical of Gandhian activism,{{Sfn|Mehta|1999}} Tagore was key in resolving a Gandhi<U+2013>[[B. R. Ambedkar|Ambedkar]] dispute involving separate electorates for untouchables, thereby mooting at least one of Gandhi's fasts "unto death".{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=306<U+2013>307}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=339}}

===Repudiation of knighthood===
Tagore renounced his knighthood, in response to the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] in 1919. In the repudiation letter to the Viceroy, [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]], he wrote<ref name="TOI2011-04"/> {{cquote|The time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring in the incongruous context of humiliation, and I for my part, wish to stand, shorn, of all special distinctions, by the side of those of my countrymen who, for their so called insignificance, are liable to suffer degradation not fit for human beings.}}

==Santiniketan and Visva-Bharati==
Tagore despised rote classroom schooling: in "The Parrot's Training", a bird is caged and force-fed textbook pages<U+2014>to death.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=267}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Pal|2004}} Tagore, visiting Santa Barbara in 1917, conceived a new type of university: he sought to "make Santiniketan the connecting thread between India and the world [and] a world center for the study of humanity somewhere beyond the limits of nation and geography."{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=204}} The school, which he named [[Visva-Bharati University|Visva-Bharati]],{{Cref|<U+03B7>}} had its foundation stone laid on 24 December 1918 and was inaugurated precisely three years later.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=220}} Tagore employed a ''[[brahmacharya]]'' system: ''gurus'' gave pupils personal guidance<U+2014>emotional, intellectual, and spiritual. Teaching was often done under trees. He staffed the school, he contributed his Nobel Prize monies,{{Sfn|Roy|1977|p=175}} and his duties as steward-mentor at Santiniketan kept him busy: mornings he taught classes; afternoons and evenings he wrote the students' textbooks.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=27}} He fundraised widely for the school in Europe and the United States between 1919 and 1921.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=221}}

===Theft of Nobel Prize===
On 25 March 2004, Tagore<U+2019>s Nobel Prize was stolen from the safety vault of the Visva-Bharati University, along with several other of his personal belongings.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-03-25/india/28342931_1_tagore-s-nobel-prize-mrinalini-devi-visva-bharati-university |title= Tagore's Nobel Prize stolen |work=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=[[The Times Group]]|date=25 March 2004|accessdate=10 July 2013}}</ref> On 7 December 2004, the Swedish Academy decided to present two replicas of Tagore<U+2019>s Nobel Prize, one made of gold and the other made of bronze, to the Visva Bharati University.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-12-07/india/27146417_1_rabindranath-tagore-s-nobel-prize-visva-bharati-university-replicas|title= Sweden to present India replicas of Tagore's Nobel|work=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=[[The Times Group]]|date=7 December 2004|accessdate=10 July 2013}}</ref>

Every year, many events pay tribute to Tagore: ''Kabipranam'', his birth anniversary, is celebrated by groups scattered across the globe; the annual Tagore Festival held in Urbana, Illinois; ''Rabindra Path Parikrama'' walking pilgrimages from Calcutta to Santiniketan; and recitals of his poetry, which are held on important anniversaries.{{Sfn|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign}}{{Sfn|Chakrabarti|2001}}{{Sfn|Hatcher|2001}} Bengali culture is fraught with this legacy: from language and arts to history and politics. [[Amartya Sen]] scantly deemed Tagore a "towering figure", a "deeply relevant and many-sided contemporary thinker".{{Sfn|Hatcher|2001}} Tagore's Bengali originals<U+2014>the 1939 ''{{Unicode|Rab<U+012B>ndra Rachan<U+0101>val<U+012B>}}''<U+2014>is canonised as one of his nation's greatest cultural treasures, and he was roped into a reasonably humble role: "the greatest poet India has produced".{{Sfn|K<U+00E4>mpchen|2003}}

{{Quote box|quote=Who are you, reader, reading my poems an hundred years hence?<br />I cannot send you one single flower from this wealth of the spring, one single streak of gold from yonder clouds.<br />Open your doors and look abroad.<br />From your blossoming garden gather fragrant memories of the vanished flowers of an hundred years before.<br />In the joy of your heart may you feel the living joy that sang one spring morning, sending its glad voice across an hundred years.|source=<U+2014> ''The Gardener'', 1915.{{Sfn|Tagore|Ray|2007|p=104}}|align=left|width=20%|fontsize=85%|quoted=1}}

Tagore was renowned throughout much of Europe, North America, and East Asia. He co-founded [[Dartington Hall School]], a progressive coeducational institution;{{Sfn|Farrell|2000|p=162}} in Japan, he influenced such figures as Nobel laureate [[Yasunari Kawabata]].{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=202}} Tagore's works were widely translated into English, Dutch, German, Spanish, and other European languages by Czech indologist [[Vincenc Lesn<U+00FD>]],{{Sfn|Cameron|2006}} French Nobel laureate [[Andr<U+00E9> Gide]], Russian poet [[Anna Akhmatova]],{{Sfn|Sen|2006|p=90}} former Turkish Prime Minister [[B<U+00FC>lent Ecevit]],{{Sfn|Kinzer|2006}} and others. In the United States, Tagore's lecturing circuits, particularly those of 1916<U+2013>1917, were widely attended and wildly acclaimed. Some controversies{{Cref|<U+03B8>}} involving Tagore, possibly fictive, trashed his popularity and sales in Japan and North America after the late 1920s, concluding with his "near total eclipse" outside Bengal.{{Sfn|Sen|1997}} Yet a latent reverence of Tagore was discovered by an astonished [[Salman Rushdie]] during a trip to Nicaragua.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=255}}

By way of translations, Tagore influenced Chileans [[Pablo Neruda]] and [[Gabriela Mistral]]; Mexican writer [[Octavio Paz]]; and Spaniards [[Jos<U+00E9> Ortega y Gasset]], [[Zenobia Camprub<U+00ED>]], and [[Juan Ram<U+00F3>n Jim<U+00E9>nez]]. In the period 1914<U+2013>1922, the Jim<U+00E9>nez-Camprub<U+00ED> pair produced twenty-two Spanish translations of Tagore's English corpus; they heavily revised ''The Crescent Moon'' and other key titles. In these years, Jim<U+00E9>nez developed "naked poetry".{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=254<U+2013>255}} Ortega y Gasset wrote that "Tagore's wide appeal [owes to how] he speaks of longings for perfection that we all have [...] Tagore awakens a dormant sense of childish wonder, and he saturates the air with all kinds of enchanting promises for the reader, who [...] pays little attention to the deeper import of Oriental mysticism". Tagore's works circulated in free editions around 1920<U+2014>alongside those of [[Plato]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], and [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]].

Tagore was deemed over-rated by some. [[Graham Greene]] doubted that "anyone but Mr. Yeats can still take his poems very seriously." Several prominent Western admirers<U+2014>including Pound and, to a lesser extent, even Yeats<U+2014>criticised Tagore's work. Yeats, unimpressed with his English translations, railed against that "Damn Tagore [...] We got out three good books, Sturge Moore and I, and then, because he thought it more important to know English than to be a great poet, he brought out sentimental rubbish and wrecked his reputation. Tagore does not know English, no Indian knows English."{{Sfn|Sen|1997}}{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2001}} [[William Radice]], who "English[ed]" his poems, asked: "What is their place in world literature?"{{Sfn|Tagore|Radice|2004|p=26}} He saw him as "kind of counter-cultur[al]," bearing "a new kind of classicism" that would heal the "collapsed romantic confusion and chaos of the 20th [c]entury."{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2001}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Radice|2004|pp=26<U+2013>31}} The translated Tagore was "almost nonsensical",{{Sfn|Tagore|Radice|2004|pp=18<U+2013>19}} and subpar English offerings reduced his trans-national appeal:

{{Cquote|1=[...] anyone who knows Tagore's poems in their original Bengali cannot feel satisfied with any of the translations (made with or without Yeats's help). Even the translations of his prose works suffer, to some extent, from distortion. E.M. Forster noted [of] ''The Home and the World'' [that] "[t]he theme is so beautiful," but the charms have "vanished in translation," or perhaps "in an experiment that has not quite come off."|4=[[Amartya Sen]]|5="Tagore and His India".{{Sfn|Sen|1997}}}}
