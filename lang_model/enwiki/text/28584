'''Hopeville Pond State Park''' is a [[Connecticut]] [[state park]] located in  the [[New England town|town]] of [[Griswold, Connecticut|Griswold]]. Before European colonization, the Mohegan people constructed weirs and fished from the [[Pachaug River]]. In 1711, Stephen Gates was granted 14 acres of land that now resides within the park's limits and constructed a gristmill and sawmill at the natural falls. In 1818, Elizah Abel purchased the mill privilege and built a woolen mill at the site. The mills were later acquired by John Slater who constructed a satinet mill and named it "Hope Mill". The village of Hopeville would derive its name from the mill, and it thrived until a series of fires destroyed the mills, the church and some houses. Sometime before 1917, the Ashland Cotton Company erected a dam on the site and created a 145 acre reservoir. The United States Government purchased the land in the 1930's for recreational use and used the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] to adapt the land to the purpose. In 1938, the State of Connecticut designated Hopeville Pond as a state park.

Hopeville Pond State Park's recreational activities include biking, hiking, camping, fishing, boating and swimming. A variety of fish are found in the park, including [[northern pike]], [[largemouth bass]], and [[yellow perch]]. The park has a total of 80 camp sites with each site featuring a fire ring with grate and a picnic table. The park manager's house is a [[National Register of Historic Places]] listed property.

== History ==
Hopeville Pond was by the Mohegan Indians for fishing prior to the European colonization. The Mohegans built [[weir]]s to directed the water flow and fish to the center of the stream for easy capture in fishing baskets.<ref name=DEEP /> In 1711, Stephen Gates was granted 14 acres of land which lies within the state park limits. Gates constructed a [[gristmill]] and sawmill at the natural falls along the Pachaug River. In 1818, Elizah Abel purchased the mill privilege and built a woolen mill at the site. Later, John Slater purchased the three mills and constructed a [[satinet]] mill and named it "Hope Mill".<ref name=DEEP /> The village of Hopeville derived its name from the mill and would also carry it through to the Hopeville Pond and the Hopeville Pond State Park name. The natural falls of the mill sites are no longer visible as they are now underwater.<ref name=DEEP />

By 1840, Hopeville was a "thriving village" according to Daniel L.

== Avery House ==
{{main|Avery House (Griswold, Connecticut)}}
The Avery House, also known as Hopeville Pond Park House, is a {{convert|20|ft|m}} by {{convert|40|ft|m}}, the two story central-chimney Colonial dating to circa 1770. The central chimney is on a stone base and has a built-in root cellar.  In 1935, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) rehabilitated the property for park use. The alterations in the house changed the traditional five-room first floor plan by eliminating the keeping rooms and the removal of the kitchen fireplace. It retains much of its original door frames and wrought-iron latch hardware. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1986.<ref name="nom">{{cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/86001726.pdf |title=Connecticut Historical Association Historic Resources Inventory: Hopeville Pond Park House |date=June 1985 |author=Mary E.
