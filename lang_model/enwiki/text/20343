'''Euclid Beach Park''' (1895 <U+2013> September 28, 1969) was a popular [[amusement park]] located on the shores of [[Lake Erie]] in the [[Collinwood]] neighborhood of [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].

Originally incorporated by some investors from Cleveland and patterned after [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Coney Island]], the park was originally managed by William R. Ryan, Sr., who ran a park with [[gambling]], a [[beer garden]], and [[freak show]]s. In 1897, Lee Holtzman became Euclid Beach's new director, but he offered it for sale in 1901.

Dudley S. Humphrey, Jr., led six members of his family in managing the park as of 1901 (they had previously operated concessions at the park, but had been particularly unhappy with the way Ryan ran it). They expanded the beach and bathing facilities, including adding a lakeside swing, added many new attractions, and advertised to locals with the slogan, "one fare, free gate and no beer." <ref name="Van Tassel 1996">Van Tassel, David D. and John J. Grabowski, eds. ''The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History'' 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1996.</ref>

Designed to be a family-friendly park, the Humphreys would not even let anyone in who had had a beer at a nearby bar; also, signs throughout the park instructed that only children were permitted to wear shorts, because the Humphreys thought that proper dress would promote a family-friendly atmosphere. At one point the park advertised that it would "present nothing that would demoralize or depress," and that visitors would "never be exposed to undesirable people."<ref>Francis, David & Diane. [http://www.grayco.com/cleveland/books/28892/ Cleveland Amusement Park Memories], Gray and Company (2004).</ref> Not only families were attracted to Euclid Beach Park; it was also a place for company and community group gatherings. In August 1910, the park was the site of an exhibition flight by aviator [[Glenn Curtiss]] from Euclid Beach to Cedar Point and back.

==Rides and attractions==
Euclid Beach Park was built on a [[beach]], which was part of the attraction, and for a time, most of it. Another early facet of the park was its [[dance hall]]. After the Humphreys acquired the park, many more attractions became a part of Euclid Beach.

===The Euclid Beach Carousel===
The first [[carousel]] that Euclid Beach Park used was the [[Philadelphia Toboggan Company|Philadelphia Toboggan Company Carousel Number 9]] design. It debuted in 1905; in 1910, it was replaced by [[Philadelphia Toboggan Company|Philadelphia Toboggan Company Carousel Number 19]]. This carousel had fifty eight horses and two chariots, which were decorated with leaf carvings surrounding a Greek god and two cherubs. The chariots retained these classic designs when the Carrousel's other decorations were replaced with an [[art deco]] look. After Euclid Beach Park, this Carrousel operated at [[Palace Playland]] in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, until 1996. In 1997, the Euclid Beach Park Nuts (today called Euclid Beach Park Now) and the [[Trust for Public Land]] partnered to acquire the Carousel and bring it back to Cleveland. It is not currently operating, and the horses and mechanism remain in storage. On June 30, 2010, Cleveland's Euclid Beach Park Carousel Society and Euclid Beach Park Now proposed a partnership with the Western Reserve Historical Society (WRHS), which owns the nostalgic and valuable Carousel horses and chariots. The plan includes a $6 million fundraising campaign to rebuild the Carousel at WRHS and provide and endowment to ensure its operations.

===Roller coasters===
Seven [[roller coaster]]s operated at Euclid Beach in the history of the park. All were wood coasters. The first roller coaster, the '''Switchback Railway''', debuted in 1896 and closed in 1904. It was built by LaMarcus A. Thompson.

The Switchback Railway was followed by the '''Figure Eight''' (1904<U+2014>1909, designed by Henry B. Auchy and built by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters) and the '''Scenic Railway''', the second coaster to be built by Thompson (1907<U+2014>1937).

In 1909, John A. Miller premiered his first coaster at the park, the '''New Velvet Coaster''', later renamed the Aero Dips, which ran until 1965. He also designed the Derby Racer, later renamed the '''Racing Coaster''', which was built by [[Frederick Ingersoll]] and debuted in 1913 with much fanfare, including a quite favorable advertisement in the May 30, 1913 ''[[The Plain Dealer|Plain Dealer]]''. This was the first roller coaster to last until the close of the park in 1969. This coaster only had a single track, which formed a [[M<U+00F6>bius strip|moebius loop]]. Miller would later co-design the Flying Turns (see below).

'''The Thriller''' was designed by [[Herbert Paul Schmeck]] and Howard Stoneback. It, too, was built by Philadelphia Toboggan Company. Premiering in 1924 and surviving until the close of the park, it was one of the most popular coasters around in its heyday. It was an "out and back" coaster, and it cost $90,000.

====The Flying Turns====
The [[Flying Turns (roller coaster)|Flying Turns]] was the name of the roller coaster at Euclid Beach Park, but it was also the name for a ''type'' of roller coaster. John Norman Bartlett, a British aviator in [[World War I]], came to North America after the war with an idea for a trackless wooden chute, full of twists like a [[bobsled]] course, with [[toboggan]]-like cars. He filed a patent for the idea in 1926.

Bartlett met John Miller in 1928, and they commenced building the new ride. When the ride went into production, much of the idea was the same, but the cars looks more like [[monoplane]]s, which Bartlett designed. Miller worked on the loading station, supporting structure, braking system and incline.

The first Flying Turns was not at Euclid Beach Park; it operated at Lakeside Park in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. But the Flying Turns at Euclid Beach Park was the second to be built (there would later be a half-dozen more, including one at [[Coney Island]]). It was also the tallest, and the Park's version used three-car trains. Couples enjoyed the ride because one rider could sit in the other's lap. "At Euclid Beach on the Flying Turns I'll bet you can't keep her smilin'" is a line from the Beach Boys' song "Amusement Parks U.S.A." (from their 1965 album Summer Days (and Summer Nights!!).

==The Euclid Beach Park Riot==
By around 1915, Euclid Beach Park would only admit [[African American]]s on certain days, as part of its efforts to promote what its management saw as a family-friendly atmosphere. On the other days, the park's special police enforcement team would eject blacks entirely. On the days when blacks were allowed into the park, they were not permitted to interact with white park-goers.<ref name="Van Tassel 1996"/>

A series of protests occurred at Euclid Beach Park in 1946. On July 21, 1946, twenty people from American Youth for Democracy, United Negroes and Allied Veterans of America, and the [[National Negro Congress]] visited the park as an interracial group. They were evicted after a park policeman told them that it was park policy that there be "no sitting, no talking, no mixing of any kind... between the races."<ref name="Van Tassel 1996"/> Subsequently, Euclid Beach Park was [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] on several occasions by these and several other organizations.<ref name="Van Tassel 1996"/>

On August 23, 1946, twelve members of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), another interracial group, attempted to visit the park, but were also evicted by park police. Albert T. Luster, an African-American man who had gone to the park to meet the CORE group but never met it, was later beaten by a park policeman.<ref name="Van Tassel 1996"/>

CORE continued to fight the policy. A six-member interracial group from CORE visited the park on September 21, 1946, and were again removed from the park by the park police. However, on this occasion two off-duty Cleveland policemen, Lynn Coleman and Henry MacKey, both African-American, intervened and a fight broke out between the city police and the park police. In the scuffle, Coleman was shot in his leg with his own gun. After this incident, the park closed a week early, per the Mayor's request.<ref name="Van Tassel 1996"/>

==Decline and closure==
[[Image:Euclid Beach Arch.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Euclid Beach Park Gateway Arch]]
Euclid Beach Park closed in 1969. It was one of many parks that closed in that period: The Forest Park Highlands in [[Missouri]] burned down in 1963, [[New Jersey]]'s Olympic Park closed in 1965, and [[Riverview Park (Chicago)|Riverview Park]] of [[Illinois]] shut down in 1967.

Like these parks, Euclid Beach closed because of the changes in the times; [[white flight]], the advent of [[television]] and the growing popularity of [[shopping mall|mall]]s all contributed to less in ticket sales. Euclid Beach also had to deal with racial tension, as did most amusement parks of the era and other similar public venues, especially after the riot (see above). Perhaps, too, the Humphreys' "family values" seemed a bit quaint after all these years. There were also financial issues<U+2014>property taxes doubling, cheap gas that made travel easy, etc.

Some other rides or pieces of rides and attractions from Euclid Beach Park remained in operation or circulation in the [[Cleveland, Ohio]] area. Many of the Kiddy Rides, such as the Euclid Beach Chief, were sent to [[Shady Lake Park]] in [[Streetsboro, Ohio]].

* The Great American Racing Derby, a ride which simulated a horse race, still runs today at [[Cedar Point]].
* [[Laffing Sal|Laughing Sal]], the robotic nightmare that greeted patrons of the Surprise House, still haunts Cleveland, and is rented for many occasions such as parades and Home Days in some suburbs.[http://www.laffinthedark.com/articles/sal/sal7.htm]

Many structures still standing on the Euclid Beach site after its closing were burned in a series of fires. By 1986, most of the park was gone. though some remnants of the park are still visible.<ref>[http://illicitohio.com/SBNO/euclid01.htm Illicit Ohio Euclid Beach Park page], accessed 15 March 2009.</ref> The original shoreline walkway is still at the beach. The concrete pier is also standing at its original location. This pier was made with a patented Humphrey concrete-pouring process.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?id=7GNSAAAAEBAJ US Patent 1255750] Concrete Conveying and Mixing Machine, accessed 15 October 2010.</ref><ref>Bush, Lee O., Edward C. Chukayne, Russell A. Hehr, and Richard F. Hershey. ''Euclid Beach Park Is Closed for the Season''. Dillon/Liederbach, 1977. p. 36.</ref> This process was also used in constructing the trailer park wall, which is still standing. The wall runs along Lakeshore Boulevard.

A few original guide wire remnants attached to the sycamore trees, the loading platform for the Antique Cars, the anchor post for the Thriller coaster, and part of the path to the Flying Turns platform are also still standing in the state park. The bridge for the Turnpike Cars still stands across the driveway for one of the apartment buildings built on the former west end of the Park.  The remains of the supports for the Turnpike Cars center directional rail which was used on the track to keep the turnpike cars from going off of the track are also still visible.

Just next to the pier, of which the concrete portion is largely intact, is an empty, circular pool made of cement. This pool was once a ride. Beach-goers could sit in suspended swing seats, and be taken for rides around the {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} pool via a motor in the pool's center. Later, the swing seat apparatus was removed, and a center fountain was put in its place. The pool is now filled in with dirt and grass. Plans are to rebuild the Pier.

Perhaps the most famous of the remnants of Euclid Beach Park is the arched main gate. This archway has been declared a Cleveland landmark, and is now protected from demolition. The arch was severely damaged by a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]] driver in January 2007.<ref>Summers, Dave. "[http://www.wkyc.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=61591 Euclid Beach Park arch damaged]",
[[WKYC-TV|WKYC]]. 2007-01-11.</ref> On June 12, 2007, the rebuilt Arch was rededicated.

Today, the former entrance road into the park is E 159th St. The portion of the site not included in the State Park is occupied by a [[trailer park]], and the owners of the trailer park demolished the Humphrey Mansion in 2005.<ref>O'Mara, Michael. "[http://www.wkyc.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=40816 Old Humphrey Mansion demolished]", [[WKYC-TV|WKYC]]. 2005-09-15.</ref> However, the Humphrey Company<ref>[http://www.humphreycompany.com/ The Humphrey Company], accessed 15 October 2010.</ref> continues to sell the park's famous [[popcorn]] and [[taffy (candy)|taffy]] products.

Euclid Beach also featured in an episode of the classic television series, ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'', in which a young boy runs away from home and spends the day in the park.
