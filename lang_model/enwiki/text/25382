'''''Merry Christmas II You''''' is the thirteenth [[studio album]] and second [[Christmas]] album by American singer [[Mariah Carey]]. The album was released on November 2, 2010 and features four original songs, all-time Christmas classics and a re-recorded version of her 1994 Christmas hit "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/08/19/mariah-carey-touches-down-in-brazil/ |title=Mariah Carey Touches Down in Brazil |publisher=Rap-Up.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref>

==Background and production==
After the cancellation of the Carey's thirteenth studio album/second remix album ''[[Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel#Angels Advocate|Angels Advocate]]'', speculation began to shift onto an alleged Christmas album. Fashion photographer David LaChapelle told ''The Times'' on April 24, 2010 that he shot the Christmas album's artwork, thus confirming that Carey was indeed planning to release her second holiday album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article7105598.ece|title=David LaChapelle: the man who shot fame|publisher=Timesonline.co.uk|date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> It was revealed that long-time collaborators for the project include Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, Johnt<U+00E1> Austin and Randy Jackson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mariahcarey.com/news/news.php?uid=2854 |title=Official Site and Honey B.

A lot of it is said to be 'live' and there's an ochestra. So let's chew on that news, and calm down about the other. And believe me, she won't be announcing anything at Radar Online owned by the National Enquirer. That won't be happening!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2010/06/03/exclusive-mariah-is-preggers-with-new-album |title=Exclusive: Mariah IS Preggers<U+2026>With New Album! |publisher=Showbiz411 |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> 

It was later announced that Carey had worked with Broadway collaborator [[Marc Shaiman]], with Carey saying that he was her favorite collaborator since her days with Walter Afanasieff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2010/08/25/mariah-carey-broadway-collaborator-working-on-new-record |title=Mariah Carey: Broadway Collaborator Working on New Record |publisher=Showbiz411 |date=2010-08-25 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> During a press conference in Seoul, South Korea, in August 2010, Island Def Jam executive Matt Voss announced that the Christmas album would be out in November 2. Several days later, the album's title was revealed. The ''II'' represents the follow-up to 1994's multi-platinum ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'' album. An accompanying DVD will also be released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/09/01/exclusive-mariah-carey-christmas-album-title-release-date-revealed/ |title=Exclusive: Mariah Carey Christmas Album Title, Release Date Revealed |publisher=Rap-Up.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> Three track titles have been passed around the web; [[Bryan-Michael Cox]] confirmed through [[ustream]] that a track named "[[Oh Santa!]]" had been recorded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/9580849 |title=Clip 1, Recorded on 9/14/10 theloveguru on USTREAM.

The album attracted generally mixed to positive reviews from contemporary pop critics.

Retrieved on 2010-03-11.</ref> and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album three stars, with Caryn Ganz of ''Rolling Stone'' writing "Sixteen years have passed since Mariah Carey released her first blockbuster holiday album, but she hasn't lost her desire to dress up in a Santa suit or the silky flexibility of her voice...Half of the disc's new originals are ballads [and] thick with gooey orchestration... but Mariah bops to a schoolyard-chant beat on "Oh Santa!" and digs out a retro groove for "When Christmas Comes." Ganz concluded that although some songs on the album are lacking, "the LP's warm heart is in the right place."<ref name="Ganz, Caryn">Ganz, Caryn.[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/45342/229458 Review: ''Merry Christmas II You'']. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. Retrieved on 2010-03-11.</ref> Eric Henderson of [[Slant Magazine]] gave the album a mixed review, calling the album "adventureless", he wrote, "Aside from a few tracks co-produced by Jermaine Dupri, Carey's notions of what a holiday album is are exactly as they were 16 years ago. Ditch the hip-hop beats, heap on the figgy orchestral pudding. Pass those synthesizers to the left, gather around the brass section and the little drummer boy."<ref name="Henderson, Eric">Henderson, Eric.

Retrieved on 2010-03-11.</ref> Sean Fennessey of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also gave a mixed critical reception to the album. Comparing the album to Carey's 1994's ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'', Fennessey suggested that, while ''Merry Christmas II You'' sees the "return [of] her piercing, five-octave vocal range to its glossy, meretricious roots", none of the new songs are as exciting or timeless as "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]".<ref name="WashPost">Fennessey, Sean.[http://blog.washingtonpost.com/clicktrack/2010/11/album_review_mariah_carey_merr.html Album review: Mariah Carey, "Merry Christmas II You"]. Retrieved 2010-03-11</ref>

The ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' gave ''Merry Christmas II You'' three stars out of four, lauding the singer's vocal form on the album. Joey Guerra writes, "Carey sounds better than she has in a long time throughout ''Merry Christmas II You'', which keeps her in a swirl of gospel choruses and lush production. Her belting is strong, and she doesn't overdo the breathy coos." Guerra also had strong praises for a number of songs, calling "Oh Santa!" "irresistible", and writing, "'Christmas Time Is in the Air Again' boasts swooping notes and tasteful strings, and 'When Christmas Comes' plays like a holiday spin on the brassy R&B tunes that highlighted Carey's ''[[Emancipation of Mimi]]'' disc... The solemn 'One Child' sounds a bit like a [[Michael Jackson]] tune (complete with kid chorus). It's a bit overwrought, but it's hard not to be swayed by the sweetness." The reviewer concluded that "''Merry Christmas II You'' should boost the singer's career."<ref name="Guerra">Guerra, Joey.
