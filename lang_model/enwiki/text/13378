Officially known as the [[Canadian Forces]] '''431 Air Demonstration Squadron''', the '''Snowbirds''' are [[Canada]]'s military [[aerobatic]]s or [[airshow]] flight demonstration team.  

The 431 Air Demonstration Squadron is under the jurisdiction of the [[Canadian Forces Air Command]]. Approximately 80 Canadian Forces personnel work with the squadron full-time; 24 personnel are in the show team that travels during the show season. 

The show team flies 11 [[Canadair CL-41 Tutor|CT-114 Tutor]]s &mdash; nine for aerobatic performances, including two solo aircraft, and two as spares, flown by the team coordinators.

The Snowbirds have flown for over 100 million spectators across [[North America]].  

==History==
No. 431 Squadron was a product of the [[Second World War]]. It was formed on [[11 November]] [[1942]], at [[Burn, North Yorkshire|Burn, England]], flying [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington X]] heavy [[bomber]]s with [[No. 4 Group RAF|No. 4 Group]] [[RAF Bomber Command]]. The squadron moved to [[RAF Tholthorpe]] in mid-1943, was transferred to [[No. 6 Group RCAF]], and converted to [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax V]] aircraft. In December 1943 the squadron moved to [[RAF Croft]] where it was re-equipped with Halifax III's and later, [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster X]] aircraft. The squadron moved to [[RCAF Station Dartmouth]], [[Nova Scotia]] after the war, disbanding there on [[5 September]] [[1945]].

In [[1969 in aviation|1969]], [[Colonel]] [[O.B. Philp]], former leader of the [[Golden Centennaires]] aerobatic team obtained permission to use seven of the leftover Golden Centennaire CT-114 Tutor aircraft still fitted for aerobatic flying. The Tutors had some minor corrosion and were painted with white anti-corrosive paint. Philp and three others from ''2 Canadian Forces Flying Training School'' (2CFFTS) began unofficially training for aerobatic flight at [[CFB Moose Jaw]] and performing at shows around the country. Known as the ''2 Canadian Forces Flying Training School Formation Team'', or informally as the ''Tutor Whites'', the team grew in size and gradually gained recognition. The team remained unofficial until it was formed into its own squadron - 431 Air Demonstration Squadron - on [[1 April]] [[1978]]. 

A contest to give the air demonstration squadron a formal name was held at the CFB [[Moose Jaw]] base elementary school (Bushell Park Elementary) and resulted in the name '''Snowbirds'''. The name reflected the aircraft's distinctive all-white paint scheme used at the time, had an association with Canada, and connoted grace and beauty. Coincidentally, "[[Snowbird (song)|Snowbird]]" was the name of an [[Anne Murray]] hit song that was popular at the time.<ref>Dempsey 2002, p. 538.</ref> The name was formally adopted on [[25 June]] [[1971]].

The Snowbirds were awarded the 1994 "Belt of Orion" by [[Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame]]. The squadron continues to fly the CT-114 Tutor, and was presented their Squadron Colours on [[15 October]] [[1999 in aviation|1999]] for 25 years of service. For a time, the [[The Red Knight (aircraft)|Red Knight]], a solo show of a single Canadair (Lockheed) [[CT-33 Silver Star]], also flew with the 431.

On [[28 June]] [[2006]], [[Canada Post]] released two domestic rate (51 cent Canadian) stamps to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the team. The [[Royal Canadian Mint]] jointly released a $5.00 silver commemorative coin.

==Notable performances==
* The first performance of the team with the new name of "Snowbirds" was on [[11 July]] [[1971]] at their home base of CFB Moose Jaw during the Homecoming '71 Air Show.
* The first formal public performance that included opposing solos was flown at [[Yellowknife]] on [[13 May]] [[1972]].
* The opening ceremonies at the Calgary [[1988 Winter Olympics]] was the first time the Snowbirds used coloured smoke. The colours represented the five colours of the [[Olympic rings]].
* In 1990 red smoke was incorporated into the Snowbirds' routine at major performances to commemorate the team's 20th anniversary and the [[Silver Jubilee|silver anniversary]] of the [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]].
* The team performed for the first time outside of Canada and the US in October 1993 at Zapopan Military Air Base near [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]].
* The Snowbirds overfly the [[Canada Day]] celebrations at Parliament Hill, [[Ottawa]] on 1 July.
