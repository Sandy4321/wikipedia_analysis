'''Sebastian Award''' is a prize delivered in September, since 2000, to a film or documentary screened during [[San Sebasti<U+00E1>n International Film Festival]] that best reflects the values and reality of lesbian, gays, transgerders as well as bisexuals.

The selection of the winner film is carried out between all sections that make up the Festival: Official Section, Zabaltegi, Horizontes Latinos, Made Spain, etc.

== History ==

In ''2000'' was raised the idea of creating a gay and lesbian film award in the frame of San Sebasti<U+00E1>n Film Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sansebastianfestival.com/in/pagina.php?ap=3&id=1997 |title=AWARD-WINNERS 2010|date=September  2010|publisher=Sansebastian Festival|}}</ref> 

This idea came up among ''Gehitu'' <ref>[http://www.gehitu.net GEHITU (LGBT Association from Bask Country)]</ref>members, a gay , lesbian, bisexual and transgender association from the Basque Country. The goal intended, as it was already happening from 1987 on with the [[Teddy Award]] in the [[Berlinale]] , was that the prize would help gay-theme movies have more relevance in movies theathers as well as in mass media.

"Kr<U+00E1>mpack" ("[[Nico and Dani]]" in english), from the film director Cesc Gay, was the first film awarded with  Sebastiane Prize<ref>"Geisemu<U+00E1> Magazine n.1", San Sebastian, March 2001</ref>. The film reflected the sexual awakening of two teenagers, as one comes to terms with his homosexuality and the other with his heterosexuality. The jury of this edition was made up by the writter Luis G. Martin,  film critic Bego<U+00F1>a del Teso, Angel Retamar from ZERO magazine, Gehitu members, Patricia Garc<U+00ED>a and David Montero.<ref>"Historia del Palmares del Premio Sebastiane",Gehitu Magazine n.60, San Sebasti<U+00E1>n, Sep. 2009</ref>

The name given to the Award, <U+201C>[[Sebastiane]]<U+201D>, honoured the film with the same name directed in 1976 by British [[Derek Jarman]]. It was his first film, in which he portrayed introspectively the roman soldier Sebastian, martyr of Christianity, later a Middle Age Saint and  eventually turned into a homoerotic icon.

[[Saint Sebastian]], patron saint of San Sebasti<U+00E1>n (Donostia), is a root symbol of the city itself,  venue of the Festival, but likewise it is too a symbol the homosexual culture itself. That serves a perfect picture to represent the Sebastiane Prize.

The Prize figurine was designed by Enrique Rojas. It represents the silhouette in metal of the image that traditionally has pictured San Sebasti<U+00E1>n martyr: a half naked body, which torso is pierced by arrows.
