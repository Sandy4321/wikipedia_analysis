'''Lakselv Airport, Banak''' ({{lang-no|Lakselv lufthavn, Banak}}; {{Airport codes|LKL|ENNA|p=n}}) is an international [[airport]] located at [[Banak, Norway|Banak]], {{convert|1.5|km|sp=us|1}} north of [[Lakselv]], in the [[municipalities of Norway|municipality]] of [[Porsanger]], [[Finnmark]] county, [[Norway]]. Co-located with the military [[Station Group Banak]], the airport is owned and operated by the state-owned [[Avinor]]. The airport is also branded as '''North Cape Airport''', although the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] is {{convert|180|km|sp=us}} away. The [[runway]] is {{convert|2788|m|sp=us}} long and aligned nearly north<U+2013>south. The airport is served by [[Wider<U+00F8>e]] with flights to [[Troms<U+00F8>]] and [[Alta, Norway|Alta]], and seasonally by [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] to [[Oslo]], in addition to international charter services. The airport had 71,763 passengers in 2012. In addition to serving Porsanger, the airport's catchment area includes [[Karasjok]] and [[Lebesby]].

The airfield was constructed with triangular runways in 1938. It was taken over by the [[Luftwaffe]] in 1940, who expanded it and laid down two wooden runways. It was taken over by the NoRAF in 1945, but abandoned in 1952. It opened in 1963 and was largely funded by the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO). [[Scandinavian Airlines]] operated out of the airport to the other primary airports in [[Finnmark]] and to Troms<U+00F8> and Oslo. The runway was extended in 1968. From 1990, flights were taken over by [[SAS Commuter]] and the direct flights to Oslo were halted. From the mid-1990s there have been occasional charter flights out of Banak. Wider<U+00F8>e took over SAS' services in 2002.

== History ==

===First airport===
An airport at Lakselv was first proposed out of military considerations. Despite a Norwegian neutrality policy, there was a fear that Norway could be occupied by foreign powers to take advantage of the country's strategic position. The military therefore wanted to construct airfields throughout the country to increase the air force's mobility.<ref>Klevberg: 10</ref> Especially Finnmark was regarded as a key location, given the increased Soviet militarization on the [[Kola Peninsula]]. Increased military funding was granted from 1937, and the following year, a triangular runway was built at Banak.<ref>Klevberg: 11</ref>

[[File:Lakselv Airport, Banak overview 1.jpg|thumb|left|Overview of the runway]]
During the [[German occupation of Norway]] during [[World War II]], Banak was taken over by the Luftwaffe. They were planning an attack on the Soviet Union from Finnmark and decided to designate Banak as their main air base in Northern Norway. By September 1940, the main runway was extended to {{convert|1000|by|200|m|sp=us}} with a wooden surface. In addition, three hangars were built, allowing the air base to house [[bomber]]s. The main function of the air station was to attack the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]]. By 1943 there were two parallel runways, both {{convert|1800|m|sp=us}} long. The air station was blasted in October 1944 during [[Operation Nordlicht (1944<U+2013>1945)|Operation ''Nordlicht'']], the German retreat from Finnmark.<ref>Klevberg: 12</ref>

The [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] took control over the airfield in 1945 and started reconstruction.<ref name=k13>Klevberg: 13</ref> In 1945, the air force operated scheduled flights from [[Bardufoss Air Station]] via Banak to [[Kirkenes Airport, H<U+00F8>ybuktmoen]]; at Bardufoss a corresponding flight was offered to Oslo. The service lasted only the one season.<ref name=a220>Arheim: 220</ref> Later the runway was used to serve [[air ambulance]]s. During the late 1940s, part of the wooden runway was removed and used for other construction projects.<ref name="k13"/>

Interest in Banak rose with the [[Czechoslovak coup d'<U+00E9>tat of 1948]] and fears of Soviet intervention in Norway. Finnmark, located on the [[Norway<U+2013>Soviet Union border]], became of particular interest for the military. Although specific plans were articulated, no construction was carried out.<ref>Klevberg: 14</ref> Norway's entry into the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and Banak.<ref>Klevberg: 16</ref> Norwegian authorities and NATO regarded Finnmark as a [[tripwire]]<U+2014>it was to be sacrificed and delay attacking forces in case of a Soviet invasion.<ref>Klevberg: 17</ref> The airfield was closed in 1952,<ref>Klevberg: 20</ref> but the runway remained, with a short section of an unmaintained wooden runway and otherwise consisting of a grass strip. It was occasionally used by small aircraft.<ref>Klevberg: 48</ref>

===Re-establishment===
Interest from military leaders for an airport at Banak returned in 1955. For the air force the main concern was that they could not reach the eastern-most parts of Norway from [[Bod<U+00F8> Main Air Station]]. This resulted in several Soviet infringements of Norwegian air space.<ref>Klevberg: 22</ref> Alternative locations were considered, such as [[Kautokeino]], were there had been built a radar.<ref>Klevberg: 23</ref> NATO supported a reconstruction of Banak, partially raised by increased focus on [[flanking maneuver]] strategies,<ref>Klevberg: 26</ref> and also to serve as a part of the nuclear program.<ref>Klevberg: 32</ref> NATO was ready to provide funding in 1957, but by the Norwegian authorities wanted to delay its construction,<ref>Klevberg: 33</ref> citing lack of personnel to man the station and that it would not be usable in times of war.<ref>Klevberg: 34</ref> The government decided in 1957 to not allow nuclear warheads to be stored in Norway during peacetime, thus eliminating NATO's strategic need for Banak. The airport was therefore removed from the investment program.<ref>Klevberg: 39</ref>

By 1959 the United States was concerned that the militarization of the Kola Peninsula would become the prime point of a Soviet attack on North America.<ref>Klevberg: 44</ref> A new discussion about location arose, with Alta and Kautokeino as the main alternatives.<ref>Klevberg: 49</ref> Banak was estimated to cost 4.9 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK), NOK&nbsp;2.8 million less than Alta, had better instrument landing and weather conditions and allowed a longer runway.<ref>Klevberg: 51</ref> The main advantage of Alta was that it would be better suited for civilian traffic.<ref>Klevberg: 52</ref> The government and [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]] approved construction of Banak in 1959 on condition that it receive NATO funding.<ref>Klevberg: 60</ref> Construction was estimated at NOK&nbsp;8.9 million, which would include a {{convert|2000|m|sp=us|adj=on}} runway, but lack of funding meant the airport would not meet all of NATO's air base standards.<ref>Klevberg: 62</ref> The project was approved by NATO on 1 June 1960 and by Parliament on 5 August.<ref name="Klevberg63">Klevberg: 63</ref>

Construction was carried out simultaneously at Banak, [[Alta Airport]] and Kirkenes Airport, H<U+00F8>ybuktmoen, which combined would give Finnmark three primary airports.<ref>Eikeset: 376</ref> All three airports opened on 4 May 1963,<ref>Eikeset: 377</ref> while [[Troms<U+00F8> Airport]] opened the following year.<ref>Malm<U+00F8>: 65</ref> Services were at first operated by [[Scandinavian Airlines System]] (SAS). At first the airline used 56-passenger [[Convair CV-440 Metropolitan]] aircraft, which flew flights south to Oslo in combination with flights to Alta and Kirkenes<U+2014>from 1964 also to Troms<U+00F8>. The general route scheme of flying multi-legged flights from Oslo to Finnmark would remain until 1990.<ref name=heitmann>{{cite web |url=http://www.nfo.no/nyinfo/Main/Tidligere_artikler/2003/19.06.03_luftig_eventyr.htm |title=Luftig eventyr |last=Heitmann |first=Frithjof |date=19 June 2003  |language=Norwegian|publisher=Norsk Flytekniker Organisasjon |accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>

===Operational history===
To allow increased military use of the air station, the airport received an upgrade in 1967 and 1968 costing NOK&nbsp;17.8 million. This included an extension of the runway with {{convert|600|m|sp=us}}, a [[taxiway]] and various military hangars and structures.<ref name="Klevberg63"/> Following the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968, Norway decided to further strengthen the Finnmark defenses, which among many measures included a further extension of the runway at Banak.<ref>Klevberg: 101</ref> From 7 April 1969, SAS introduced the 85-passenger [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|Douglas DC-9-21]] jetliner on the Finnmark service; the last Metropolitan flew on 1 April 1970.<ref name=heitmann />  The 330 Squadron, which operates the [[Westland Sea King]] search and rescue helicopters, was established at Banak Air Station in 1973.<ref name=seaking>Arheim: 88</ref> SAS' traffic increased throughout the 1970s, resulting in SAS gradually increasing the frequency of its services, and later also using larger DC-9s. The [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]] was first flown on the Finnmark route on 11 July 1986.<ref name=heitmann />
