'''Wood Island''' is a grade-level, open-air [[rapid transit]] bus and train station on the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] and is on the part of the Blue Line that uses [[overhead lines]] instead of [[third rail]]. Located on Bennington Street ([[Massachusetts Route 145|Route 145]]) in the neighborhood of [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston]], the station's primary patrons are residents of the Day Square area.  The station also serves as a bus transfer point for several local routes.

The station is adjacent to the former Wood Island Park, a once heavily-used recreational area for [[East Boston]] residents.  Most of the park was destroyed in the middle 1960s to expand [[Logan International Airport]].  Although Logan can be clearly seen from the station, there is no access, however one can take the Blue Line one stop to the [[Airport (MBTA station)|Airport]] station.

==Renovations==
As part of the ongoing renovation and expansion of the Blue Line, the station was reconstructed in the mid-1990s, removing a private, elevated [[busway]].  Since the busway was directly above the station's platforms, the station itself was partially enclosed.   All MBTA buses now load in an open busway directly off Bennington Street with the new open-air station seated back several hundred feet from the street. The station's two platforms on either side of two tracks are connected by an overhead walkway within the paid zone.

During August 2008, the station underwent a renovation of both platforms. For several years, the platforms had deteriorated and several tiles were broken. The station was closed to passengers and shuttle buses ran from [[Airport (MBTA station)|Airport Station]] in lieu of subway service. It was reopened on Monday, August 25, 2008.
