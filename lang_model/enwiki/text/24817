Robert Dale was born in [[England]] in October 1812.  Through the influence of his great uncle General William Dyott, he was appointed as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] to the [[British Army]]'s [[63rd Regiment]], shortly before it was posted to the new [[Swan River Colony]] in [[Western Australia]].  On arrival at the colony, he was seconded as an assistant to [[Surveyor General of Western Australia|Surveyor General]] [[John Septimus Roe]], whose Survey Department was suffering under an extreme workload.  Dale spent four years with the Survey Department, surveying, clearing roads and exploring.  He was the first European to cross the [[Darling Range]], where he discovered the fertile [[Avon Valley]] and helped establish the towns of [[York, Western Australia|York]] and [[Northam, Western Australia|Northam]].  He was also the first European to see and describe the [[numbat]].

Dale was promoted to [[Lieutenant]] in 1832, but the following year he resigned his military career and returned to [[England]].  He took with him the head of [[Yagan]], an [[Indigenous Australian]] of the [[Noongar]] nation who had been killed by a young settler.  Dale settled in [[Liverpool]], joining his family in the [[timber]] trade.  He later became involved in promoting the use of the Western Australian timber [[jarrah]].  He died of [[tuberculosis]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] on [[20 July]] [[1853]].

A significant hill on the ground to the south of [[Mundaring Weir]] was named [[Mount Dale, Western Australia|Mount Dale]] after him. The [[Dale River (Western Australia)|Dale River]] a tributary of the [[Avon River (Western Australia)|Avon River]] was also named after him.
