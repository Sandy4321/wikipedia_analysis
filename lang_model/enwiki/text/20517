'''Peter Whittle''' (born 27 February 1927, in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]{{ref|nzms}}) is a mathematician and statistician, working in the fields of [[stochastic net]]s, [[optimal control]], [[time series]] analysis, [[stochastic optimisation]] and [[stochastic dynamics]]. From 1967 to 1994, he was the [[Churchill professorship of mathematics for operational research|Churchill Professor]] of Mathematics for [[Operational Research]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].{{ref|home}}{{ref|history6}}

==Career==

Whittle graduated from the [[University of New Zealand]] in 1947 with a BSc in mathematics and physics and in 1948 with a MSc in mathematics.<ref>Anonymous. Biographical sketch. In Kelly.</ref> {{ref label|nzms|1|a}} 

He then moved to Uppsala, Sweden in 1950 to study for his PhD{{ref label|nzms|1|b}} with [[Herman Wold]] (at the [[University of Uppsala]]). His thesis, ''Hypothesis Testing in Time Series'', generalised Wold's [[autoregressive model|autoregressive]] [[Wold theorem|representation]] [[Wold decomposition|theorem]] for univariate [[stationary process]]es to [[multivariate statistics|multivariate]] processes. Whittle's thesis was published in 1951{{ref label|home|2|a}}. A synopsis of Whittle's thesis also appeared as an appendix to the second edition of Wold's book on time-series analysis. He remained in Uppsala at the Statistics Institute as a [[docent]] until 1953, when Whittle returned to New Zealand. 

In New Zealand, Whittle worked at the Department of Industrial and Scientific Research (DSIR) in the Applied Mathematics Laboratory (later named the Applied Mathematics Division). 

In 1959 Whittle was appointed to a [[lecturer|lectureship]] in Cambridge University{{ref label|nzms|1|c}}{{ref|history4}}. Whittle was appointed Professor of [[Mathematical statistics]] at the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in 1961.{{ref label|nzms|1|d}}{{ref label|history6|3|a}}{{ref|informs}} After 6 years in [[Manchester]], Whittle returned to Cambridge as the [[Churchill Professorship of Mathematics for Operational Research|Churchill Professor of Mathematics for Operational Research]], a post he held until his retirement in 1994. From 1973, he was also Director of the [[Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge]].{{ref|history7}} 
He is a fellow of [[Churchill College, Cambridge]].

Whittle was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1978,{{ref|frs}} and an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Society of New Zealand]] in 1981.{{ref|frsnz}} The Royal Society awarded him their [[Sylvester Medal]] in 1994 in recognition of his "major distinctive contributions to time series analysis, to optimisation theory, and to a wide range of topics in applied probability theory and the mathematics of operational research".{{ref|sylvester}} In 1986, the [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]] awarded Whittle the Lanchester Prize for his book ''Systems in Stochastic Equilibrium'' (ISBN 0-471-90887-8) and the [[John von Neumann Theory Prize]] in 1997{{ref label|informs|5|a}} for his "outstanding contributions to the theory of operations research and management science".{{ref|lanchester}}

==Personal life==

In 1951 Whittle married a Finnish woman, K<U+00E4>the Blomquist, whom he had met in Sweden. The Whittle family has six children.{{ref label|nzms|1|e}}{{ref|kids}}

==Bibliography==
Peter Whittle has written many books and articles.
