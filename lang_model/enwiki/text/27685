"'''Finding Judas'''" is the ninth episode of the third season of ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' and the fifty-fifth episode overall.

==Plot==
6-year-old girl Alice (Alyssa Shafer), is enjoying herself at an amusement park with her dad. When they go on a ride, Alice starts screaming uncontrollably. [[Gregory House|House]]'s team checks her and finds [[pancreatitis]]. It turns out that her parents ([[Christopher Gartin]] and [[Paula Cale]]) are divorced, and argue all the time. However, Alice's parents can't agree on whether to trust House's judgment, so her guardianship is awarded to [[Lisa Cuddy|Cuddy]]. Each time the doctors perform a test on Alice, her skin reacts as if she has allergies to everything. House thinks it's impossible for her to be allergic to everything, so he suspects infection. House recommends [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]]s, but Cuddy fears this will cause [[Shock (circulatory)|systemic shock]], so she just administers one antibiotic. Alice keeps getting worse, including muscle rigidity and liver failure. Without answers, Cuddy runs a charcoal [[hemoperfusion]] during which Alice gets a [[Thrombus|blood clot]] on her arm. [[Eric Foreman|Foreman]] and Cuddy operate on her and remove the clot, but her temperature rises dangerously. Cuddy cools her off by placing her under a shower. House concludes she has [[necrotizing fasciitis]], even though he has no evidence, for which her only chance for survival is amputation of the infected limbs (left arm and leg). The team doesn't agree on such a radical measure, but House scolds them for being too cautious. The surgery is prepared while the team hang out in the Diagnostics office. [[Robert Chase|Chase]] is playing with a laser pointer and gets an epiphany. He stops House in the hospital hall and says that he thinks Alice has [[erythropoietic protoporphyria]] which makes her allergic to light. House rejects the explanation. When Chase tries to stop him, House punches him in the face. House, shocked at his outburst, realizes that Chase is right, and calls the [[Operating theatre|OR]] to stop the surgery.

[[List of House characters#Michael Tritter|Detective Tritter]] is in an unused office in the hospital, reading files and papers. All the characters except House talk to him. He scolds Cuddy for being permissive, offers Foreman to let his imprisoned brother go in exchange for info, taunts [[Allison Cameron|Cameron]] about her false crush on House and tries to frame Chase into looking like he squealed on House. Tritter also freezes the team's bank accounts only to release them three days later, in order to create animosity and distrust among them. All the while House is distracted by his lack of Vicodin, which Cuddy is administering in meager doses. He gets furious and yells at everyone, including insulting Cuddy for her inability to take care of Alice and tells her that "its a good thing you failed to become a mom, because you suck at it." Cuddy is destroyed by this comment, since she has already tried three times to get pregnant. Wilson talks to her and tries to calm her. After Chase is punched, he talks to Wilson, who is working clinic duty. Chase tells Wilson that he can't stand the situation anymore, and that he's through waiting for House's approval. Wilson then goes to Tritter and says [[Judas Iscariot|"I'm gonna need thirty pieces of silver"]].
