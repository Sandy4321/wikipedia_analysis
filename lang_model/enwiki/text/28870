At the time of his consecration, Sample was the youngest Catholic bishop in the United States and the first to be born in the 1960s.<ref name=palmo>{{cite web |date= December 13, 2005 |work= Whispers in the Loggia |publisher= Self-published |title= Breaking the Barrier |url=http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com/2005/12/breaking-barrier.html |last= Palmo |first= Rocco }}{{verify credibility|failed=y|date=February 2013}}</ref> He selected as his episcopal [[motto]]: ''"Vultum Christi Contemplari"'', meaning, "To Contemplate the Face of Christ."<ref name=diocese/>

On October 7, 2007, at the invitation of [[Archbishop]] [[Raymond Leo Burke]], Bishop Sample attended the [[Red Mass]] at the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis]], delivering the homily. In April 2009, Sample expressed his "disappointment and dismay" over the [[University of Notre Dame]]'s decision to have President [[Barack Obama]] deliver its commencement speech and receive an [[honorary degree]], given Obama's [[pro-choice]] views.<ref name=obama>{{cite news |date= April 7, 2009 |publisher= [[WLUC-TV]] |location= Negaunee, MI |title= Bishop Disapproves of Obama Commencement |url=http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/news/story.aspx?id=283795}}</ref> He added, "It saddens me beyond words that the great university named after [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Our Lady]] would bestow distinction and honor on a politician who would seek to expand threats to such innocent human life."<ref name=obama/>

Bishop Sample has stressed that permanent deacons should not regularly preach at Mass; rather, they should preach at other services and serve the Church in the course of their daily witness to Christ. Bishop Sample<U+2019>s 19-page letter, titled <U+201C>The Deacon: Icon of Jesus Christ the Servant,<U+201D> cited the principle that the one who presides at a liturgical service or who is the principal celebrant at Mass should also give the homily: <U+201C>This should be the ordinary practice." Deacons should preach the homily at Mass <U+201C>for some identifiable advantage for the faithful in the congregation, but not on a regular basis.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news |first= Kevin J. |last= Jones |url= http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/deacons-should-preach-less-at-mass-michigan-bishop-says/ |publisher= Catholic News Agency |title= Deacons should preach less at Mass, Michigan bishop says |date= June 21, 2011}}</ref>

The Diocese of Marquette serves roughly 70,000 Roman Catholics in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]].<ref name=whispers>{{cite web |date= January 26, 2006 |work=Whispers in the Loggia |publisher= Self-published |title= Birth of the Baby Bishop |url= http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com/2006/01/birth-of-baby-bishop.html |last= Palmo |first= Rocco}}{{verify credibility|date= February 2013|failed=y}}</ref>
