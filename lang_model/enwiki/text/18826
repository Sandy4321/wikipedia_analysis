'''Ursula Kroeber Le Guin''' ({{PronEng|<U+02C8><U+025C>rs<U+0259>l<U+0259> <U+02C8>kro<U+028A>b<U+0259>r l<U+0259><U+02C8><U+0261>w<U+026A>n}}; born October 21, 1929) is an American author. She has written novels, poetry, children's books, essays, and [[short story|short stories]], most notably in the genres of [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]]. First published in the 1960s, her works explore [[Taoism|Taoist]], [[anarchism|anarchist]], [[ethnography|ethnographic]], [[Feminism|feminist]], [[psychology|psychological]] and [[sociology|sociological]] themes.

==Life==
Le Guin was born and raised in [[Berkeley, California]], the daughter of [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] and writer [[Theodora Kroeber]]. In 1901 Le Guin's father earned the first Ph.D. in anthropology in the United States from [[Columbia University]] and went on to found the second department, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary: Alfred Louis Kroeber|author=Steward, Julian H. (1960)|publisher=''[[American Ethnography Quasiweekly]]''|url=http://www.americanethnography.com/article.php?id=10}}</ref> Theodora Kroeber's biography of her husband, ''Alfred Kroeber: A Personal Configuration'', is a good source for Le Guin's early years and for the biographical elements in her late works, especially her interest in social anthropology.

Le Guin received her B.A. (''[[Phi Beta Kappa]]'') from [[Radcliffe College]] in 1951, and [[Master's degree|M.A.]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1952. She later studied in [[France]], where she met her husband, the [[historian]] [[Charles Le Guin]]. They were married in 1953.

She became interested in literature when she was very young. At the age of eleven, she submitted her first story to the magazine ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''. It was rejected.<ref name="Vice Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.viceland.com/int/v15n12/htdocs/ursula-k-le-guin-440.php|title=Ursula K. Le Guin|last=Lafrenier|first=Steve|date=December 2008|publisher=Vice |accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref> Her earliest writings, some of which she adapted to include in ''[[Orsinian Tales]]'' and ''[[Malafrena]]'', were non-fantastic stories of [[fictional country|imaginary countries]]. Searching for a way to express her interests, she returned to her early interest in science fiction and in the early 1960s began to be published regularly. She received wide recognition for her novel ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', which won the [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula Award|Nebula]] awards in 1970.

In later years, Le Guin did work in film and audio. She contributed to [[The Lathe of Heaven (film)|''The Lathe of Heaven'']], a 1979 PBS film based on her novel of the same name. In 1985, she collaborated with ''avant-garde'' composer [[David Bedford]] on the [[libretto]] of ''Rigel 9'', a space opera.

In December 2009, Le Guin resigned from the [[Authors Guild]] in protest over its endorsement of [[Google|Google's]] book digitization project.  "You decided to deal with the devil," she wrote in her resignation letter. "There are principles involved, above all the whole concept of copyright; and these you have seen fit to abandon to a corporation, on their terms, without a struggle." <ref>{{cite news|title=Le Guin accuses Authors Guild of 'deal with the devil'|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/dec/24/le-guin-authors-guild-deal|date=Dec. 24, 2009|publisher=www.guardian.co.uk | location=London | first=Alison | last=Flood | accessdate=2010-05-27}}</ref>

Le Guin has lived in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], since 1958. She has three children and four grandchildren.

== Awards ==

Le Guin has received five [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] awards and six [[Nebula Award|Nebula]] awards,<ref>[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit77.html#3061|Locus Index to SF Awards: Ursula Le Guin]</ref> and was awarded the [[Gandalf Award|Gandalf Grand Master]] award in 1979 and the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] [[Grand Master Nebula|Grand Master Award]] in 2003. She has received nineteen [[Locus Award]]s for her fiction, more than any other author.<ref>[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/LocusTallies.html The Locus Index to SF Awards: Locus Awards Records and Tallies]</ref> Her novel ''[[The Farthest Shore]]'' won the [[National Book Award#Children's Books|National Book Award for Children's Books]] in 1973.

Le Guin was the [[Science fiction convention#Anatomy of a typical science fiction convention|Professional Guest of Honor]] at the [[33rd World Science Fiction Convention|1975 World Science Fiction Convention]] in [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. She received the [[Library of Congress]] ''[[Library of Congress Living Legend|Living Legends]]'' award in the "Writers and Artists" category in April 2000 for her significant contributions to America's cultural heritage.<ref>"[http://www.loc.gov/about/awards/legends/bio/leguin.html Living Legends: Ursula LeGuin]", Awards and Honors (Library of Congress).</ref>  The Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association gave her a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001.  In 2004, Le Guin was the recipient of the [[Association for Library Service to Children]]'s [[May Hill Arbuthnot]] Honor Lecture Award and the [[Margaret Edwards Award]]. She was honored by The Washington Center for the Book for her distinguished body of work with the Maxine Cushing Gray Fellowship for Writers on October 18, 2006.<ref>"[http://www.spl.org/default.asp?pageID=about_news_detail&cid=1158624484322|Library News Release]," The Seattle Public Library, 19 October 2006.</ref>

In 2002, Le Guin received the [[PEN/Malamud Award]] for "excellence in a body of short fiction."<ref>"People and Publishing: Awards," [[Locus (magazine)|Locus]], January 2003, p.8.</ref>

At their 2009 convention, the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] awarded the <U+201C>Emperor Has No Clothes<U+201D> award to Le Guin.<ref>Transcript of Ursula K. LeGuin's acceptance speech for the [http://ffrf.org/outreach/awards/emperor-has-no-clothes-award/ursula-k.-le-guin/ 2009 "Emperor Has No Clothes" Award]</ref> The FFRF describes the award as "celebrating 'plain speaking' on the shortcomings of religion by public figures".<ref>[http://ffrf.org/outreach/awards/emperor-has-no-clothes-award/ "Emperor Has No Clothes" Award] at the FFRF</ref>

==Themes==
{{BLP sources|section|date=February 2008}}
Much of Le Guin's science fiction places a strong emphasis on the [[social sciences]], including [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], thus placing it in the subcategory commonly known as [[soft science fiction]].<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0047-7729%28198422%2914%3A3%3C43%3A%22IDLTD%3E2.0.CO%3B2-2 Charlotte Spivack, "'Only in Dying, Life': The Dynamics of Old Age in the Fiction of Ursula Le Guin," ''Modern Language Studies'', Vol. 14, No. 3. (Summer, 1984), pp. 43-53]</ref>  Le Guin has objected to this classification of her writing, expressing her distaste for the divisiveness of the term and its implication of what constitutes valid science fiction.<ref name="Vice Interview" />

A distinguishing characteristic of Le Guin's work is her deliberate treatment of race.  The majority of Le Guin's main characters are people of color, a choice made to reflect the non-white  majority of humans, and one to which she attributes the frequent lack of character illustrations on her book covers.<ref name="Salon Profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/people/bc/2001/01/23/le_guin|title=Ursula K. Le Guin|last=Justice|first=Faith L. |date=23 January 2001|publisher=Salon|accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>  Her writing often makes use of [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] cultures to convey a message about human culture in general. An example is the exploration of [[sexual identity]] through an [[androgynous]] race in ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]''.  Such themes can place her work in the category of [[feminist science fiction]],<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0307-6776%28197810%290%3A28%3C4%3AGAIMBA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-T  Marilyn Strathern, "Gender as It Might Be: A Review Article," ''RAIN'', No. 28. (Oct., 1978), pp. 4-7.]</ref> but not necessarily so. Her works are also often concerned with [[ecology|ecological]] issues.

In her writing, Le Guin makes use of the ordinary actions and transactions of everyday life. For example, in '[[Tehanu]]' it is central to the story that the main characters are concerned with the everyday business of looking after animals, tending gardens and doing domestic chores. While she has often used otherworldly perspectives to explore political and cultural themes, she has also written fiction set much closer to home; many of her short stories are set in our world in the present or near future.

Several of Le Guin's science fiction works, including her novels ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' and ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', belong to her [[Hainish Cycle]], which details a future, galactic civilization loosely connected by an organizational body known as the [[Hainish Cycle|Ekumen]]. Many of these works deal with the consequences of contact between different worlds and cultures. The Ekumen serves as a framework in which to stage these interactions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  For example, the novels ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' and ''[[The Telling]]'' deal with the consequences of the arrival of Ekumen envoys (known as "mobiles") on remote planets and the [[culture shock]] that ensues.

Unlike those in much mainstream [[science fiction]], none of the civilizations Le Guin depicts possess reliable [[faster-than-light travel]], with the exception of unmanned FTL monitors and bombers. Instead, Le Guin created the [[ansible]], a device that allows instantaneous communication up to 120 light years. The term and concept have been subsequently borrowed by several other well-known authors.

==Adaptations of her work==
Few of Le Guin's major works have been adapted for film or television. Her 1971 novel ''[[The Lathe of Heaven]]'' has been adapted twice. First, in 1980 by [[WNET|thirteen/WNET New York]], with her own participation, and again in 2002 by the [[A&E Network]].  In a 2008 interview, Le Guin said that she considers the 1980 adaptation as "the only good adaptation to film" of her work to date.<ref name="Vice Interview" />

In the early 1980s animator and director [[Hayao Miyazaki]] asked permission to create an animated adaptation of Earthsea. However, Le Guin, who was unfamiliar with his work and [[anime]] in general, turned down the offer. Several years later, after seeing ''[[My Neighbour Totoro]]'', she reconsidered her refusal, believing that if anyone should be allowed to direct an Earthsea film, it should be Hayao Miyazaki.<ref name="Ursula K. LeGuin, Gedo Senki">{{cite web|url=http://www.ursulakleguin.com/GedoSenkiResponse.html|title=Gedo Senki, A First Response|first=Ursula K.|last=LeGuin}}</ref> The third and fourth Earthsea books were used as the basis of the 2005 animated film {{Nihongo|''[[Tales from Earthsea (film)|Tales from Earthsea]]''|<U+30B2><U+30C9><U+6226><U+8A18>|Gedo Senki}}. The film, however, was directed by Miyazaki's son, [[Goro Miyazaki|Goro]], rather than Hayao Miyazaki himself, which came as a disappointment to Le Guin. Le Guin has expressed mixed feelings towards {{Nihongo|''Tales from Earthsea''|<U+30B2><U+30C9><U+6226><U+8A18>|Gedo Senki}}: while by and large positive about the aesthetic of the film, she took issue with its moral delivery and plot execution.

In 2004 the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] adapted the first two books of the Earthsea trilogy as the [[miniseries]] ''[[Legend of Earthsea]]''. Le Guin was highly critical of the adaptation, calling it a "far cry from the Earthsea I envisioned", and objecting to the [[whitewashing]] of characters as well as the way she was "cut out of the process".<ref name="Slate ">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2111107/|title=A Whitewashed Earthsea: How the Sci Fi Channel wrecked my books|last=Le Guin|first=Ursula K. |date=16 December 2004|publisher=''Slate''|accessdate=7 February 2008}}</ref>

In the 1980s, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] Radio anthology program 'Vanishing Point' adapted '[[The Dispossessed]]' into a series of six 30 minute episodes and '[[The Word for World Is Forest]]' as a series of three 30 minute episodes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
