'''Antonio Quarracino''' (August 8, 1923 &ndash; February 28, 1998) was a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] of [[Argentina]] and the Archbishop of [[Buenos Aires]] between 1990 and 1998. 

==Biography==
Quarracino was born in [[Pollica]], [[Province of Salerno]], [[Italy]].  His family [[immigration in Argentina|emigrated to Argentina]] when he was 4 years old.

Quarracino was ordained priest on 22 December 1945, and became a professor at the Diocesan Seminar of [[Mercedes, Buenos Aires|Mercedes]]. He also taught [[theology]] at the [[Universidad Cat<U+00F3>lica Argentina]].

He was appointed Bishop of [[Nueve de Julio, Buenos Aires]], by [[Pope John XXIII]], on 3 February 1962, and received the episcopal see on [[8 April]] of the same year. On 3 August 1968 [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] moved him to the diocese of [[Avellaneda]] (whose new cathedral was built during his rule).

[[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] promoted him to the Archdiocese of [[La Plata]] on 18 December 1985, and then to the Archdiocese of [[Buenos Aires]] on 10 July 1990, additionally appointing him [[Primate (religion)|Primate]] of Argentina. He was elected to preside the [[Argentine Episcopal Conference]] in the following November, and then reelected, until 1996. He was elevated to [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''S. Maria della Salute a Primavalle'' in [[consistory]] on 28 June 1991.

Quarracino died in 1998 at the age of 74, due to a [[cardiac arrest]]. He was succeeded automatically by his coadjutor bishop, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Jorge Bergoglio]].

==Views==
===Inter-religious dialogue with Jews===
Quarracino was a major figure of inter-religious discussion with Jews. During a visit to [[Israel]] in 1992 he was decorated by Jewish institutions for this cause, and in 1997 he had a mural painting set up in the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral|Cathedral of Buenos Aires]] commemorating the victims of the [[Holocaust]] and the bombings of the [[Israeli Embassy attack in Buenos Aires|Israeli Embassy]] and the [[AMIA Bombing|AMIA]].

===Social communications===
Quarracino was inclined to journalism and, while in La Plata, he renewed the informative magazine of the archdiocese, transforming it into a full-fledged cultural publication. As Bishop of Buenos Aires, he appeared on TV often and regularly; he was in charge of a segment in a religious program (''Claves para un mundo mejor'') in the state-owned channel [[Canal 7 Argentina|ATC]].

===Dirty War===
Quarracino was outspoken about controversial topics. One of his first notable public statements was his support, in 1982, of a project of law that would end all investigation of the crimes of the [[Dirty War]], in order to "contribute to national reconciliation". This can be seen as a precedent of the ''[[Ley de Punto Final]]'', sanctioned in 1986.

===Argentine politics===
Quarracino was opposed to the policies of President [[Ra<U+00FA>l Alfons<U+00ED>n]] (1983&ndash;1989), and accused politicians of corruption, as the cause of "national poverty". However, he acknowledged being a friend of President [[Carlos Menem]] (1989&ndash;1999), who was himself heavily criticized by other Church leaders (such as [[Ra<U+00FA>l Francisco Primatesta|Cardinal Primatesta]]).

===Homosexuality===
In 1994, during his TV segment in ATC, Quarracino spoke against [[homosexuality]] saying that lesbians and gay men should be "locked up in a [[ghetto]]". This caused an accusation of discrimination, which was not considered by justice because anti-discrimination Law 23592 did not cover sexual orientation. Quarracino had already been accused three years before, when he termed homosexuality "a deviation of human nature, like [[bestiality]]".

===Boca Juniors===
The Cardinal was an avowed fan of the [[Boca Juniors]] football team. When he celebrated his 50 years of priesthood he received a Boca Juniors shirt signed by all the team members.
