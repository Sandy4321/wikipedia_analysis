==Finals==
The minor premiership was won by [[Bulldogs (rugby league team)|Canterbury-Bankstown]] in a play off against [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] after both sides had finished the season on twenty points. 

In the semi finals, Canterbury-Bankstown lost their match to [[St. George Dragons|St. George]] whilst [[Eastern Suburbs]], who only just made the finals after [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] had drawn their match in the final round of the season, defeated Balmain. The result of the first semi final meant that both St. George and Eastern Suburbs played a Preliminary Final which would ordinarily have decided the premiership. St. George won the match, as they had done four weeks earlier over Easts in the final round of the season proper.

St. George had won two matches in the semis while Canterbury had just one victory, but the Berries were guaranteed a Grand Final berth under a call back of the old rules giving the minor premiers a right of challenge. In the Grand Final, Canterbury-Bankstown narrowly defeated St. George to collect their second premiership victory.

The [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] was a muddy quagmire with a treacherous patch in the centre which kept the teams evenly matched and the crowd in a fever of excitement until the final whistle.

Canterbury's defence was tested during a torrid ten minute period when St George hurled themselves at the line from never more than eight yards away. The Berries defence held and the Dragons could not break through.

The Canterbury-Bankstown tactics were to keep the game with the forwards and away from the St George backs. Canterbury hooker Kirkaldy won the vital scrums. Bob Farrar, Frank Sponberg and Henry Porter were tireless with Porter's handling and kicking skills on display. 

Saints were leading 9-6 late in the match after a try to their record-breaking winger Jack Lindwall was converted by his brother [[Ray Lindwall]]. Berries winger Bob Jackson then scored a magnificent try made possible by a resolute and tricky run from skipper [[Ron Bailey]] which locked up the scores at 9-all. 

Canterbury's Lindsay Johnson managed a late conversion to secure the win. Johnson's goal just scraped over the cross bar to give his team the premiership.
