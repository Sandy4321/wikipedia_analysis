'''Nabeel Ahmed Abdulrasool Rajab''' ({{lang-ar|<U+0646><U+0628><U+064A><U+0644> <U+0623><U+062D><U+0645><U+062F> <U+0639><U+0628><U+062F><U+0627><U+0644><U+0631><U+0633><U+0648><U+0644> <U+0631><U+062C><U+0628>}}, born on 1 September 1964) is a [[Bahrain]]i [[human rights activist]] and [[Opposition (Bahrain)|opposition]] leader. He is president of the [[Bahrain Center for Human Rights|Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR)]]. He is also a prominent international human rights activist. He is a member of the Advisory Committee of [[Human Rights Watch]]'s Middle East Division, Deputy Secretary General for the [[International Federation for Human Rights|International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH)]], former chairman of CARAM Asia, member of the Advisory Board of the Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti-Violence Organization (BRAVO), and president of Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR).

Rajab started his human rights activity during the [[1990s uprising in Bahrain|1990s uprising]] before going on to become involved in campaigning on behalf of migrant workers in [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC countries]]. He subsequently became a leading campaigner against civil and [[Human rights in Bahrain|human rights abuses in Bahrain]] including [[Torture in Bahrain|torture]] and deaths in official custody. He is known for his pioneering use of social networking as an important element in human rights campaigning which has brought him into conflict with the authorities. [[Front Line Defenders]], Human Rights Watch (HRW) and [[Reporters Without Borders]] have described him as being targeted by Bahraini authorities for his human rights activities.

During the [[Bahraini uprising (2011<U+2013>present)|Bahraini uprising]], in which he led numerous protests, he has clashed with the political authorities and [[Public Security Forces|security forces]]. His house has been attacked with [[tear gas]], he has been arrested several times, he has allegedly been beaten, and he has been the target of death threats.  As well as criticising the [[Cabinet of Bahrain|Bahraini government]] itself, he has also been sharply critical of the role of Bahrain's allies, including the United States.

Following [[2012 Bahrain Grand Prix protests|protests]] during the [[2012 Bahrain Grand Prix|Formula 1 race]] in April 2012 that attracted media attention, Rajab was arrested and incarcerated several times. On 9 July, he was detained and sentenced to three months prison for having "insulted Bahrainis" in a [[Twitter]] message and most recently on 16 August, while still in detention, Rajab was sentenced to three years' imprisonment on three protest-related charges. The verdict has drawn criticism from Bahrain's western allies and human rights organizations.

Rajab's human rights work has been recognized internationally but within Bahraini society he remains a figure of controversy. Labeled as the informal leader of the uprising and a hero to protesters, Rajab is viewed by many [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] as a troublemaker. The majority sect in Bahrain is Shia Muslims but Sunni Muslims comprise a substantial minority and hold the top positions of power. The largest opposition party is [[Al Wefaq]] which is a Shia Islamist movement and tightly allied with secular opposition parties.  One source of opposition to  Rajab (who has taken anti-sectarian stands) and his movement is the fear (particularly among Sunnis) that they could bring Shia Islamists to power.

==Human rights activism==

===Early years===
In an interview with ''[[Bahrain Mirror]]'',<ref name="BHmirrorinterview">{{cite news | author = [[Staff writer]] | url = http://bahrainmirror.com/article.php?id=1067&cid=82 |language=Arabic| title = Special interview with Nabeel Rajab | publisher = ''[[Bahrain Mirror]]'' | date=7 June 2011 | accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref> Rajab spoke about his earliest human rights activities while still a student at [[Hoora|Al Hoora]] secondary school and described two particularly significant formative experiences: 
<blockquote>Two events affected me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started to rise and become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. So I took the easy way out and since I was the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school. </blockquote>

Rajab traveled to India to study Political Science and History. He received his Bachelor's degree but financial problems after his father became ill prevented him obtaining a Master's degree. He returned to Bahrain to find employment. During his college years, he remained independent of political affiliations. According to Rajab, despite lacking a clear understanding of what constitutes a culture of human rights or knowledge of human rights standards and norms, he was active within the general Bahraini students union, speaking out against all forms of injustice. He also became involved in international campaigning on specific issues.<ref name="BHmirrorinterview" />

According to Rajab, he became involved in organized human rights activities during the [[1990s uprising in Bahrain]]. In 1996 Rajab discussed the idea of setting up a human rights organization with [[Ali Rabea]] and Ibrahim Kamal Al Den. They introduced him to Salman Kamal Al Den, Sabeeka Al Najjar, Mohammed Al Motawa and other colleagues with whom they held secret meetings. Together they founded the [[Bahrain Human Rights Society]] in 2000.<ref name="BHmirrorinterview" />

===Foundation of Human Rights committees===
With the ending of the oppressive [[State Security Law in Bahrain|State Security Law]] period in 2000, Rajab was able to begin working openly in the field of [[Human rights]] as one of the founders of the Bahrain Human Rights Society, one of the first human rights organizations in Bahrain.<ref name="BHmirrorinterview"/> He subsequently fell out with some of the other founders. In 2002, following wide ranging [[National Action Charter of Bahrain|political reforms]] by the Bahraini government which allowed independent [[Human rights]] groups to operate, Rajab worked with [[Abdulhadi al-Khawaja]] and others to found the [[Bahrain Centre for Human Rights]] (BCHR),<ref name="BHmirrorinterview"/> a nonprofit non-governmental organization which works to promote human rights in Bahrain.<ref name="BHCR">[http://www.bahrainrights.org/en/about "About us"].

Nabeel also co-founded a number of human rights committees in Bahrain with a specific focus, including the National Committee of Victims of Torture&mdash;Bahrain (2003), the Committee of the Unemployed and Underpaid (2005), the Committee on Decent Housing (2005), the Committee of the [[Bedoun]] (Stateless) (2005) and the Committee to Defend Detained Human Rights Activists (2007).<ref name="Rense">Stephen Lendman (11 May 2012).

===Criticism of the United States===

Rajab was critical of the US role in Bahrain throughout the uprising. On 26 July 2011, in an interview with Al Jazeera English, he expressed disappointment at US silence and the inconsistent way in which US standards of democracy and human rights were applied to countries which they had problems but not to dictatorships with whom they had good relations.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/faultlines/2011/07/201172683320461554.html "The US and the new Middle East: The Gulf", Al Jazeera English, 26 July 2011]. Retrieved 31 July 2011.</ref> On 21 December 2011, in an interview with ''[[National Post]]'', he criticized US support for royal dictatorships in the region and contrasted the hard attitude shown towards Syria and Libya with the soft attitude towards allies.<ref name="NP 21 December 2011">{{cite news| author=Adrian Humphreys|title = The Arab Awakening: A Bahraini activist struggles to keep protests alive|date=21 December 2011|publisher=[[National Post]]|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/12/21/the-arab-awakening-a-bahraini-activist-struggles-to-keep-protests-alive/|accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref> 

In a ''[[World Tomorrow]]'' episode broadcast on 8 May 2012, Rajab accused the US of opposing democracy in Bahrain when it asked Russia not to sell arms for Syria while selling arms to Bahrain,<ref name="POMED 8.5.2012">[http://pomed.org/blog/2012/05/nabeel-rajab-americans-are-against-democracy-in-bahrain-now.html/#.UDGeZKniY6U "Nabeel Rajab: <U+201C>Americans are Against Democracy in Bahrain Now<U+201D>"].

==Online activity==
Rajab is an active user of online media in his human rights work, in particular social networking sites such as [[Facebook]] and Twitter.  He stopped posting in [[Bahrain Online|Internet forums]] in order to encourage support for social network-based campaigning.<ref name="BHM 7.1.2012"/>  He devotes significant time and effort to his Twitter account, created in March 2009,<ref name="BHM 7.1.2012">{{ar}}.

Even though on this occasion Rajab was personally congratulated by the Minister,<ref name="KK"/> his use of Twitter to publicise human rights abuses has brought him into repeated conflict with the authorities. In April 2011 he was threatened with prosecution for the publication on his Twitter account of an allegedly fabricated image of the body of Ali Issa Saqer showing signs of [[Torture during the Bahraini uprising (2011<U+2013>present)|torture]] in custody; the threats were withdrawn after prison guards were charged with Saqer's death.<ref>[http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-11/world/bahrain.activist_1_bahrain-s-center-security-forces-nabeel-rajab?_s=PM:WORLD "Government accuses activist of fabricating photo in Bahrain"].

In 2012 Rajab's Twitter-based campaigning led firstly to his detention for three weeks (two weeks on the charge of "insulting a statutory body via Twitter" and another week for "organizing illegal protests") after he published tweets critical of the Ministry of Interior (leading to criticism of the authorities by international human rights organizations), then to a three month prison sentence for a Tweet criticizing the prime minister, and eventually in August 2012 he was given three further consecutive one year prison sentences for illegal political activities involving the use of social networking sites.<ref name="MV 6.5.2012"/> On 23 August, spending more than half of his sentence, Rajab was acquitted of Twitter charge in which he criticized the prime minister, but remained in jail while appealing the other prison sentence.<ref name="WP 23 August 2012">{{cite web|title=Bahrain court overturns Twitter conviction for jailed rights activist, lawyer says|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/lawyer-bahrain-court-overturns-twitter-conviction-for-jailed-rights-activist/2012/08/23/1ab999de-ed01-11e1-866f-60a00f604425_story.html|work=Associated Press|date=23 August 2012|publisher=''The Washington Post''|accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref>
