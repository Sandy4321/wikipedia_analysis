'''Jamie Frank Redknapp''' (born 25 June 1973, in [[Barton on Sea]], Hampshire) is an [[English people|English]] retired [[Association football|footballer]] who was active from 1989 until 2005. He is now a [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]] at [[Sky Sports]] and an editorial sports columnist at the ''[[Daily Mail]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Redknapp|first=Jamie|title=Jamie Redknapp: My 10 to watch in the Barclays Premier League|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1301270/Jamie-Redknapp-My-10-watch-Barclays-Premier-League.html|work=Daily Mail |location=London |accessdate=20 August 2010|date=9 August 2010}}</ref> A [[midfielder]], Redknapp played for [[A.F.C.

He also gained 17 [[England national football team|England]] caps between 1995 and 1999. He won seven honours during his time at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hugman |editor1-first=Barry J. |title=The PFA Footballers' Who's Who 2005/2006 |publisher=Queen Anne Press |year=2005 |page=338 |isbn=978-1-85291-662-6}}</ref> 

In a career that was blighted by a succession of injuries, Redknapp was as famous for his media profile off the field as much as on it. He married the pop singer [[Louise Redknapp|Louise]] in 1998. Redknapp comes from a well-known footballing family. His is the father of football manager [[Harry Redknapp]]. He is also a cousin of the [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] midfielder [[Frank Lampard]], and a nephew of former [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] coach [[Frank Lampard, Sr.|Frank Lampard Senior]].

==Club career==
===Summary===
Redknapp started his career at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] as a youth player but turned down their offer of a contract to play for [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] under his father, manager Harry Redknapp, before going on to play for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] where Redknapp will be remembered for his best performances. After that Redknapp returned and played two and a half seasons for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] then finally joined [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], where he played under his father for a second time. Redknapp was also capped 17 times by [[England national football team|England]], scoring one goal.

===Bournemouth===
Redknapp started out on the road to professional football as a schoolboy at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] but began his professional career, at the age of 16, in 1989 at [[Bournemouth A.F.C.|Bournemouth]], then managed by his father, Harry. He made 13 appearances for the club before attracting the attention of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], who signed him on 15 January 1991. [[Kenny Dalglish]] had paid <U+00A3>350,000 for Redknapp, who was still only 17 at the time. He was one of the most expensively signed teenagers in [[Football in England|English football]] around this time.

===Liverpool===
[[File:Jamie Redknapp 2009.jpg|250 px|thumb|Redknapp during Hillsborough Memorial Match (2009)]]
Redknapp was the last player to be signed by manager [[Kenny Dalglish]] before his surprising resignation on 22 February 1991 and later became the youngest Liverpool player{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} to appear in European competition, at 18 years 120 days when making his Liverpool debut against [[Association de la Jeunesse Auxerroise|Auxerre]] in the [[UEFA Cup]] on 23 October 1991, by which time Liverpool were being managed by [[Graeme Souness]].

Redknapp's first goal for Liverpool came in his league debut on 7 December 1991 when he featured as a 63rd minute substitute for [[Jan M<U+00F8>lby]] in a 1<U+2013>1 draw with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at [[The Dell (Southampton F.C.)|the Dell]]. 

Following Dalglish's departure, Redknapp was part of a transitional Liverpool team under [[Graeme Souness]]. He spent most of his first two-and-a-half years as a substitute or in the reserves, missing the [[1992 FA Cup Final]] triumph and only becoming a regular first-team player in the [[1993<U+2013>94 in English football|1993<U+2013>94]] season, at the expense of [[Mark Walters]]. At this time, Redknapp had also become one of the mass-marketed poster boy icons of the newly developing [[FA Premier League]] where, alongside other photogenic young players like [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] players [[Ryan Giggs]] and [[Lee Sharpe]], he was used ceaselessly in commercials, advertising spots and for the league's promotional purposes in [[merchandising]] and sales, with the result being that football stars had become [[Celebrity|idols]] on par with [[rock stars]] and [[pop stars]],<ref>{{cite web|title=How football became the new rock<U+2019>n<U+2019>roll |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/rockngoal/archive/2009/04/22/how-football-became-the-new-rock-n-roll.aspx|publisher=fourfourtwo.com|accessdate=2 July 2010|date=22 April 2009}}</ref> by and around the mid to late 1990s.  

On the pitch, Redknapp established himself as a key midfielder during the time [[Roy Evans]] managed at [[Anfield]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} He was one of a number of young players coming through the team, such as [[Steve McManaman]] and [[Robbie Fowler]], but was criticised together with them and others like [[Stan Collymore]] and [[Jason McAteer]] as "[[Spice Boys (footballers)|Spice Boys]]" <U+2013> a derogatory term that implied that the team were epitomising the [[lad culture]] in the game.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Redknapp, in particular, came to be the face of the team and was singled out because of his off-field lifestyle; often being described along with [[David James (footballer)|David James]] as a player more concerned with the [[Runway (fashion)#Catwalk|catwalk]] and modelling shoots for fashion labels like [[Top Man]] and [[Armani]] than his football prowess.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  Many{{Who|date=March 2009}} felt he was failing to achieve, considering his talents <U+2013> his sole career winners' medal was from the [[1995 Football League Cup Final|1995 League Cup Final]].

Redknapp's game revolved around being a central midfielder with a high level of ability to create space in tight situations and accurately pass his way out of them, a player who distributed the ball around the pitch with a dazzling range of passing skills, as well as having a keen eye for set pieces and long-range shooting abilities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Redknapp scored several spectacular goals in his time at Anfield{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} and his contributions peaked during the [[1998<U+2013>99 in English football|1998<U+2013>99]] season as he created numerous chances and scored 10 goals under new boss [[G<U+00E9>rard Houllier]]. Redknapp became vice- and then full club captain by [[1999-2000 in English football|1999<U+2013>2000]] following the departures of [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], [[Steve McManaman]] and [[Paul Ince]].

His contributions helped the club back into the top three of the [[FA Premiership]] but a knee injury curtailed his involvement in the [[FA Premier League 2000-01|2000<U+2013>01]] season and in a bid to cure long-standing injury troubles he underwent knee surgery under renowned knee specialist Dr [[Richard Steadman]] in the United States. As a result, Redknapp was unable to participate in the whole of the club's cup treble campaign which yielded the [[FA Cup]], [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and [[UEFA Cup]]. Although injured, as the club captain he was called up by his team-mates to receive the FA Cup with vice-captain [[Robbie Fowler]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]]. He made his comeback from injury during the pre-season tour before the [[2001<U+2013>02 in English football|2001<U+2013>02]] season.

Redknapp's return did not last long as he was again struck by injury. On 27 October 2001 he played and scored in a 2<U+2013>0 win over [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] at [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]],<ref>{{cite news

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Redknapp was allowed to join [[Glenn Hoddle]]'s [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on a free transfer on 18 April 2002 with just a couple of fixtures remaining of the [[2001<U+2013>02 in English football|2001<U+2013>02 season]]. He made his debut at the beginning of the following campaign when he played on 17 August 2002 in the 2<U+2013>2 league draw with his former club Liverpool's rival [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Goodison Park]]. Redknapp's pass into the path of [[Matthew Etherington]] allowed Etherington to score his first ever Premiership goal.<ref>{{cite news|last=Corrigan|first=James|title=Everton see the light with Rooney|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/everton-see-the-light-with-rooney-640258.html|work=Everton 2 Tottenham Hotspur 2 |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=28 October 2010|date=18 August 2002}}</ref>

Redknapp scored his first goal for the club a week later on 26 August 2002 in the 1<U+2013>0 league win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at [[White Hart Lane]]. Redknapp played 49 times for Spurs scoring 4 goals in his two-and-a-half years with the club before becoming his father, Harry's, first signing for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 4 January 2005.

===Southampton===
The 31-year-old joined Southampton's fight against relegation on a free transfer and made his debut on 5 January 2005 in the 3<U+2013>3 league draw with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] at [[St Mary's Stadium|St Mary's]]. Redknapp's only goal for the club came three days later in the 3<U+2013>1 [[FA Cup]] 3rd round victory over [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] at [[Sixfields Stadium]].<ref>{{cite news

|title=Northampton 1<U+2013>3 Southampton 
|publisher=BBC 
|date=8 January 2005 |accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>

Redknapp was rarely fully fit during his brief spell at the Saints and was not able to prevent them from being relegated to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] after 27 successive seasons of top flight football.

At the end of the season, on 19 June 2005, the 32-year-old Redknapp decided to retire from the game due to his constant injury problems and on the advice of his medical specialists.

==International career==
[[Terry Venables]] gave Redknapp his international debut on 6 September 1995 in the 0<U+2013>0 international friendly with [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] at Wembley. The game is probably best remembered for his cross that produced [[Ren<U+00E9> Higuita]]'s famous 'scorpion kick' save.

His only international goal came on 10 October 1999 in the 2<U+2013>1 friendly victory against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at the [[Stadium of Light]], [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]].

Redknapp was capped 17 times for [[England national football team|England]] but played just 39 minutes at a major tournament <U+2013> during England's [[Euro 96]] campaign.  Injury later ruled him out of contention for both the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and [[Euro 2000|2000 UEFA European Championship]].{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Coaching==
On 28 & 29 June 2006 Redknapp's hand picked squad of 8 semi professional players represented England in an International World Cup 6v6 in [[Germany 2006]]. [[Vigan Qehaja]] was the only player to go on and play professional football, a [[Kosovo|Kosovar]] who played for [[Durham City A.F.C.|Durham City]].

On 21 September 2007, [[Chelsea FC]] reportedly approached Redknapp to become Avram Grant's assistant, as [[Chelsea FC]]'s owner billionaire [[Roman Abramovich]] looked to shake up [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]'s coaching staff, though no appointment was forthcoming

On 11 December 2008 it was announced Jamie Redknapp would become coach of [[Chelsea F.C|Chelsea]] reserves two days a week whilst studying for his UEFA coaching badges. Redknapp now spends 2 days a week coaching at Spurs<ref>{{cite news|title=Jamie Redknapp joins Chelsea backroom staff|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/chelsea/3707151/Jamie-Redknapp-to-coach-Chelsea-reserves.html|date=11 December 2008|accessdate=11 December 2008 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The vacancy arose after former Chelsea reserves coach [[Brendan Rodgers]] was hired by Championship outfit [[Watford F.C|Watford]].

==Media career==
In the summer of 2004 Jamie was a pundit on Euro 2004 with the [[BBC]], mainly based in the studio. Since his retirement, Redknapp has entered the field of punditry, mainly with [[Sky Sports]].{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} 

In 2005, Redknapp launched a bi-monthly magazine with his wife Louise and former team-mate [[Tim Sherwood]] named ''[[Icon Magazine]]'', aimed at professional footballers and their families.<ref>{{cite news|last=Honigsbaum|first=Mark|title=Former star's glossy look at footballers' lives  |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1652226,00.html|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=28 November 2005|accessdate=8 June 2006 }}</ref>

In 2010 he was made host and mentor on the [[Sky1]] show ''[[Football's Next Star]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}. In January 2011, a video was leaked of an off-camera conversation with [[Richard Keys]] discussing past sexual escapades with  woman named "Louise". Keys was filmed asking Redknapp if he had "smashed it".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/jan/25/video-sky-sports-richard-keys |location=London |work=The Guardian  | title=New video heaps further pressure on Sky Sports' anchor Richard Keys | date=26 January 2011}}</ref>

Redknapp is also a team captain in the Sky1 show ''[[A League of Their Own (Game Show)|A League of Their Own]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

On 29 June 1998, Redknapp married the pop singer [[Louise Redknapp|Louise Nurding]] (who was a member of the girl group [[Eternal (band)|Eternal]] from 1992 to 1995, before embarking on a solo singing career). 

On 27 July 2004 at 9.10&nbsp;am [[British Summer Time|BST]], Louise gave birth to a boy named Charles William "Charley" Redknapp at London's [[Portland Hospital]].
