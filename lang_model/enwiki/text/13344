'''''All That Glitters''''' is a short-lived [[situation comedy]] television series by producer [[Norman Lear]]. It consisted of 65 episodes and aired between April 18 and July 15, 1977 in [[broadcast syndication]]. The show, a spoof of the [[soap opera]] format, depicted the trials and tribulations of a group of executives at the Globatron corporation. The twist of the series was that it was set within a world of complete role-reversal: Women were the "stronger sex," the executives and breadwinners, while the "weaker sex" <U+2013> the men <U+2013> were the secretaries or stay-at-home [[househusband]]s.  Men were often treated as sex objects.

The series featured a number of performers who would later become well known in film and television, including [[Eileen Brennan]], [[Greg Evigan]], [[Wes Parker]],  [[Gary Sandy]], [[Tim Thomerson]], and [[Jessica Walter]]. Comic actor and cartoon voice artist [[Chuck McCann]] was also a regular. [[Linda Gray]] played [[transgender]]<ref name = time>{{cite news

Before and after its premiere, ''All That Glitters'' was negatively received and the series lasted just 13 weeks. In the years since its cancellation it has been re-assessed more positively and is ranked by some critics as being amongst Lear's best television work.

==Production==
''All That Glitters'' was series creator Norman Lear's attempt to duplicate his success with the [[television syndication|syndicated]] soap opera spoof ''[[Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman]]''. Lear described the premise simply: "God created Eve first, took out her rib and gave her a companion so she wouldn't be lonely."<ref name = time /> Lear came up with the idea on a trip to [[Washington, D.C.]]; <blockquote>"I had visited the Institute of Policy Studies, and I just loved the whole thing. And I thought there was a series in it<U+2014>a five-times-a-week series: I went to bed thinking about that, and I woke up the next morning thinking what would happen if the male-female equation were changed? What would happen if the women had all the power and all the advantage, and the men had what the women normally would have?<U+201D><ref name =newtimes /></blockquote>

The world of ''All That Glitters'' had always been female-dominated but Lear also used the series to comment on changing sex roles in the United States in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news

Former [[Major League Baseball]] player [[Wes Parker]] almost literally walked into his role. He was doing [[play-by-play]] reporting for a [[Los Angeles]] television station owned by Lear's partner, [[Jerry Perenchio]]. "Lear casually asked if I'd be interested in the part. I said yes, but knew it was out of the question, because in real life things don't happen that way. Nobody walks in and gets on a Norman Lear show. I read for the part, got it and didn't sleep at all that night."<ref>{{cite news

In test screenings prior to its premiere, reaction to the show was sharply divided. According to executive producer [[Stephanie Sills]], the strongest negative reaction came from male executives. "They didn't mind being portrayed by women. It was simply that they detest the way we depicted them."<ref name = time /> [[Feminism|Feminists]] were uncertain how to react to the series, with some being concerned that audiences would not perceive the show as satire but as an attempt to represent how a female-dominated society would actually operate.<ref name = time /> Lear marketed the program through his company, TAT Syndication.<ref>Television/radio Age, p. 38</ref> The series ran five nights a week.

==Critical reaction==
''All That Glitters'' debuted the week of April 18, 1977 on about 40 stations in late-night syndication.<ref name = time /> It was poorly critically received, with one reviewer going so far as to call the show's theme song "blasphemous" for suggesting that God was female and created Eve first.<ref>{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2008-11-27}}</ref> [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] sharply criticized the series, calling it "embarrassingly amateurish", with "flaccid" and "wearying" jokes, flat writing, "mediocre" acting and "aimless" direction.<ref name = time /> The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' concurred, saying that while the series' role-reversal premise may have been adequate for a play or film, it was too limiting to serve as the basis for a continuing series. These limitations showed up most clearly, the ''Journal'' says, in the lead performances. Although praising the performers themselves as talented, they are cited for being "unable to infuse much life into their roles".<ref name = wsj>{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2008-11-27}}</ref> The ''Journal'' pegs the fundamental problem with ''All That Glitters'' as that "its characters are not people at all, merely composites of the least attractive characteristics of each sex. The satire focuses not on the way real, recognizable people behave, but on stereotypes and cliches about masculine and feminine attitudes. Even when stood on their heads, they still remain stereotypes and cliches."<ref name = wsj />

''[[New Times Magazine]]'' was much more receptive to the series. Although labeling it "unquestionably the weirdest [show] that Lear has ever produced",<ref name = newtimes>{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2008-11-27}}</ref> ''New Times'' found that the series was not "a satire of mannerisms but of attitudes".<ref name = newtimes /> ''All That Glitters'' required that viewers [[Close reading|watch closely]] to pick up on the subtleties and nuances, "not so much for what the show says, but for the ''way'' that it's said".<ref name = newtimes />

''All That Glitters'', after initially capturing 20% of viewers in major markets in its opening weeks, had lost about half of that audience mid-way through its run.<ref name = newtimes /> The series was cancelled after 13 weeks, last airing on July 15, 1977. Although the show was panned, it and Lear, along with ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman'', are credited with expanding the subject matter that television producers were able to explore with lessened fear of antagonizing sponsors or viewers.<ref>Hilliard, p. 43</ref>

In the years since the series, it has garnered something of a positive reputation, with one critic listing it and other Lear efforts as "imaginative shows that contained some of the most striking satires of television and American society ever broadcast".<ref>Kellner, p. 59</ref>

While the show itself was unsuccessful, it did spawn a hit song. "[[You Don't Bring Me Flowers (song)|You Don't Bring Me Flowers]]", which had been written with the intention of its being the theme song, was recorded by [[Neil Diamond]] and [[Barbra Streisand]] and made it to #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. By the time the show made it to air, another song had been chosen as the theme.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alan and Marilyn Bergman on Songwriting: Part 1 |url=http://www.ascap.com/musicbiz/bergman-part1.html |month=November |year= 1996 |publisher=American Society of Composers and Publishers|accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref> The replacement, "Genesis Revisited", was later described by the ''[[New York Times]]'' as "sparkl[ing] with witty rhymes and a punchy good humor".<ref>{{cite news
