'''SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald''''' (nicknamed "Mighty Fitz," "Fitz," or "Big Fitz") was an American [[lake freighter|Great Lakes freighter]] launched on June 8, 1958. At the time of its launching, the ''Fitzgerald'' was the largest ship on the [[Great Lakes]]. It was one of the first boats to be at or near [[seawaymax|maximum "St Lawrence Seaway Size"]] which was {{convert|730|ft|m}} long and {{convert|75|ft|m}} wide. 

On November 10, 1975, while traveling on [[Lake Superior]] during a [[storm]], the ''Fitzgerald'' sank suddenly in [[Canada|Canadian]] waters approximately {{convert|17|mi|nmi km}} from the entrance of [[Whitefish Bay]] at a depth of {{convert|530|ft}}. Although it had reported having some difficulties before the accident, the ''Fitzgerald'' sank without sending any [[distress signal]]s. Its crew of 29 perished in the sinking and no bodies were recovered. 

When the wreck was found, it was discovered that the ''Fitzgerald'' had broken in two. The cause of her sinking is the subject of many theories, books, studies and expeditions.  Each includes factors and events in addition to the storm such as structural failure, shoaling, rogue waves, taking on water through the cargo hatches or deck due to topside damage, and human factors which may in turn have caused or contributed to these.                   

The sinking of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' is one of the most famous disasters in the history of [[Great Lakes]] shipping. The disaster was the subject of [[Gordon Lightfoot|Gordon Lightfoot's]] 1976 hit song, "[[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald]]".

==Construction==
On February 1, 1957, [[Northwestern Mutual Financial Network|Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company]] of [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] contracted [[Great Lakes Engineering Works]] (GLEW), of [[River Rouge, Michigan]], to design and build a [[taconite]] [[bulk carrier]] [[Lake freighter|laker]] for Northwestern. The contract contained the stipulation that the boat be the largest on the [[Great Lakes]]. GLEW laid the [[keel]] on August 7 of that year, and some time between then and its [[Ship naming and launching|christening]] and launch on June 7, 1958, Northwestern announced their decision to name the boat for its [[President]] and [[Chairman|Chairman of the Board]], Edmund Fitzgerald, whose father had been a lake captain.<ref>{{cite news |title=Shipwreck overshadowed Fitzgerald's legacy |author=Zielinski, Graeme |url= |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=2005-11-10 |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[[#ref40thLaunchAnniversary1998|40th Launch Anniversary (1998)]], p. 52.</ref>

The completed vessel had a capacity of {{convert|26600|ST|t}}. Its three cargo holds<ref name="Wolff, p. 226">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 226.</ref>   were in the center of the vessel<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], pp. 3&ndash;4.</ref> and loaded through twenty-one watertight hatches, each {{convert|11.6|by|54.1|ft}} of {{convert|5/16|in|adj=on}} thick steel. The boat's boilers were originally [[coal]]-fired, but would be converted to burn [[Residual fuel|oil]] during the 1971<U+2013>72 winter layup. With a length of {{convert|729|ft}}, it met the demanding stipulation of the contract and it remained the largest boat on the Great Lakes until 1971.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 12.</ref> It was one of the first boats to be at or near [[seawaymax|maximum "St Lawrence Seaway Size"]] which was {{convert|730|ft|m}} long and {{convert|75|ft|m}} wide.<ref>[[#ref40thLaunchAnniversary1998|40th Launch Anniversary (1998)]], p. 47.</ref>

More than 15,000 people attended the ''Fitzgerald's'' launch. The event was troublesome. When Mrs. Edmund Fitzgerald christened the boat by smashing a champagne bottle over the bow, it took her three swings to break the bottle. The launch was delayed 36 minutes while the shipyard crew struggled to release the keel blocks. Upon launching sideways into the water, the boat crashed violently into a pier.<ref>[[#ref40thLaunchAnniversary1998|40th Launch Anniversary (1998)]], p. 51.</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Andra-Warner|title=The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald: The Legendary Great Lakes Disaster |publisher=North Shore Press|location=Grand Marais, MN|year=2006 |isbn=0-9740207-3-7}}</ref>

==History==
Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company ordered the construction of the ''Fitzgerald'' as an investment.  Northwestern was a heavy investor in iron and mineral industries and was the first insurance company in American history to invest in an ore freighter.<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p.  14.</ref>  Northwestern entered a 25 year contract with the Columbia Transportation Division of the Oglebay Norton Corporation to operate the ''Fitzgerald''.<ref name="Wolff, p. 226"/>  [[Sea trial]]s for the ''Fitzgerald'' began on September 13, 1958 and were completed one week later. It was common practice for Northwestern to purchase ships for operation by other companies.<ref name ="Boatsite1">{{cite web | last =Wharton | first =George  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Great Lakes Fleet Page Vessel Feature -- Cuyahoga | work = | publisher = Great Lakes & Seaway Shipping  | year = 2007 | url = http://www.boatnerd.com/pictures/fleet/cuyahoga.htm | doi = | accessdate =  2011-1-2}}</ref> For the next 17 years the ''Fitzgerald'' carried [[taconite]] from [[Iron Range|Minnesota's Iron Range]] [[mining|mine]]s near [[Duluth, Minnesota]] to iron works in [[Detroit]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and other ports. The ''Fitzgerald'' set seasonal haul records six different times<ref>[[#refKantar2006|Kantar (1998)]],  p. 9.</ref> and became nicknamed "Fitz", "Mighty Fitz", "Big Fitz", or the "''Titanic'' of the Great Lakes".<ref>[[#refKantar2006|Kantar (1998)]],  pp.  6, 43.</ref><ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p.  9.</ref><ref name="Big Fitz">{{cite book |author= Edwards, Jack |title= Big Fitz |publisher= Wayne Rigby Literacy |location= |year=2000 |isbn= 0763568074 }}</ref> 

The ''Fitzgerald'' ran aground in 1969 and collided with the S.S. ''Hochelaga'' in 1970. It struck the wall of a [[Lock (water transport)|lock]] later that same year. In 1973, as well, the ''Fitzgerald'' struck a lock's wall. During 1974, the ''Fitzgerald'' again struck a lock's wall along with losing its original bow [[anchor]] in the [[Detroit River]].<ref name="Bishop, p. 85">[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 85.</ref><ref name="Vessels Index">{{cite web |title=Great Lakes Vessels Online Index |url=http://ul.bgsu.edu/cgi-bin/xvsl2.cgi|accessdate=2010-11-07|publisher=[[Bowling Green State University]]}}</ref>

===Final voyage and wreck===
[[Image:Edmund Fitzgerald Trackline.jpg|thumb|left|NTSB report probable tracks of ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' and ''Arthur M. Anderson''. (Click to enlarge)]]

The ''Fitzgerald'' left [[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]], [[Wisconsin]], at 2:15&nbsp;p.m. on the afternoon of Sunday, November 9, 1975,<ref name="Wolff, p. 218">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 218.</ref><ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], p. 4.</ref> under the command of Captain [[Ernest M. McSorley]]. It was en route to the steel mill on [[Zug Island]], near Detroit, Michigan, with a full cargo of [[taconite|taconite ore pellets]].<ref name="Ghostly views">{{cite news |title= Ghostly views of the Edmund Fitzgerald shipwreck |author=Lawrence, Eric |url= |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date= 2008-11-8|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p.  10.</ref> The ''Fitzgerald'' joined a second freighter under the command of Captain Jesse B. "Bernie" Cooper, ''[[SS Arthur M. Anderson|Arthur M. Anderson]]'', destined for [[Gary, Indiana]] out of [[Two Harbors, Minnesota]]. The weather forecast was not unusual for November and the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) predicted that a storm would pass just south of Lake Superior by 7:00&nbsp;a.m on November 10.<ref name="NTSB Report, p. 10">[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], p. 10.</ref>

The SS ''Wilfred Sykes'' loaded opposite the ''Fitzgerald'' at the Burlington Northern Dock #1 and departed at 4:15&nbsp;p.m. about 2 hours behind the ''Fitzgerald''. Captain Dudley J. Paquette of the ''Sykes'' predicted that a major storm would cross directly across Lake Superior instead of the NWS forecast that it would pass with less intensity to the south. From the outset, Paquette chose a route that avoided the worst effects of the storm by using the protection of Lake Superior<U+2019>s north shore. The crew of the ''Sykes'' followed the radio conversations between the ''Fitzgerald'' and ''Anderson'' during the first part of their trip and overheard their captains decide to take the regular Lake Carriers<U+2019> Association downbound route. Paquette reported that on November 10 after 1:00&nbsp;a.m., he overheard McSorley say that his ship was working so much that he had reduced his [[Revolutions per minute|RPMs]]. Paquette said he was stunned to later hear McSorley, who was not known for turning aside or slowing down, state, "We<U+2019>re going to try for some lee from [[Isle Royale]]. You<U+2019>re walking away from us anyway <U+2026> I can<U+2019>t stay with you."<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 14.</ref>

At 2:00&nbsp;a.m. on Monday, November 10, the NWS upgraded from gale to storm warnings (expected winds over {{convert|48|kn|adj=on}}.<ref name="Wolff, p. 226"/><ref name="NTSB Report, p. 10"/> The ''Fitzgerald'' followed the ''Anderson'' for the first 10 to 11 hours and then the faster ''Fitzgerald'' pulled ahead at about 3:00&nbsp;a.m. on November 10.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], p. 5.</ref>Crossing Lake Superior at about {{convert|14|kn}},<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 77.</ref>the boats encountered a massive winter storm, reporting winds in excess of {{convert|50|kn}} with gusts up to {{convert|86.9|kn}} and waves as high as {{convert|35|ft}}.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 27.</ref><ref name="Wolff, p. 226"/><ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 322.</ref> Visibility was poor due to heavy snow.<ref name="Fateful Voyage">{{cite news |title= The fateful voyage of the Edmund Fitzgerald |author=Nolan, Jenny |url= http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=114  |newspaper= [[The Detroit News]] |date=2000-9-21 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> The freighters altered their courses northward, seeking shelter along the [[Canada|Canadian]] coast. Later, they would cross to [[Whitefish Bay]] to approach the locks. 

By late in the afternoon of November 10, sustained {{convert|50|kn|adj=on}} winds were observed across eastern Lake Superior. ''Anderson'' was struck by a {{convert|75|kn|adj=on}} [[hurricane]]-force gust. At 3:30&nbsp;p.m., Captain McSorley radioed the ''Anderson'' to report that she was taking on water and had top-side damage including that the ''Fitzgerald'' was suffering a [[List (watercraft)|list]], and had lost two vent covers and some railings.<ref name="Wolff, p. 219">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 219.</ref> Two of the ''Fitzgerald''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s six bilge pumps were running continuously to discharge shipped water.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 6.</ref> Shortly after 3:30&nbsp;p.m., the "''Anderson'' received a broadcast from the Coast Guard that the [[Soo Locks|Sault Ste. Marie locks]] had been closed and that all ships should seek a safe anchorage."<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], p. 27.</ref>

At about 3:50&nbsp;p.m., McSorley called the ''Anderson'' to report that his radar was not working and he asked the ''Anderson'' to keep them in sight while he checked his ship down so that the ''Anderson'' could close the gap between them. ''Fitzgerald'' was ahead of ''Anderson'' at the time, effectively blind; therefore, she slowed to come within {{convert|10|mi}} range so she could receive radar guidance from the other ship.<ref name="Wolff, p. 219"/> For a time the ''Anderson'' directed the ''Fitzgerald'' toward the relative safety of Whitefish Bay. McSorley contacted the U.S. Coast Guard station in [[Grand Marais, Michigan]] after 4:00&nbsp;pm and then hailed any ships in the Whitefish Point area to inquire if the [[Whitefish Point Light|Whitefish Point light]] and navigational [[Electric beacon|radio beacon]] were operational. Captain Cedric Woodard of the ''Avafors'' answered that both the light and radio direction beacon were out at that moment. Around 5:30&nbsp;p.m., Woodward called the ''Fitzgerald'' again to report that the Whitefish point light was back on but not the radio beacon. When McSorley replied to the Avafors, he informed them that "the ''Fitzgerald'' had a 'bad list', had lost both radars, and was taking heavy seas over the deck."<ref name="NTSB Report, p. 6">[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], p. 6.</ref>  He commented, "We're in a big sea. I've never seen anything like it in my life."<ref name="Wolff, p. 221">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 221.</ref> Woodward testified to the Marine Board that he overheard McSorley say, "Don<U+2019>t allow nobody on deck"<ref name="NTSB Report, p. 6">[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], p. 6.</ref>  and something else about a vent that Woodward couldn<U+2019>t understand.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 106.</ref>

The last communication from the doomed ship came at approximately 7:10&nbsp;p.m., when ''Anderson'' notified ''Fitzgerald'' of an upbound ship and asked how it was doing. McSorley reported, "We are holding our own." It apparently sank a few minutes later.  No distress signal was received. Ten minutes later ''Anderson'' could neither raise ''Fitzgerald'' by radio, nor detect it on radar.<ref name="NTSB Report, p. 6"/><ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], pp. 29&ndash;30.</ref>

''Anderson's'' Captain Cooper first called the [[United States Coast Guard]] in Sault Ste. Marie at 7:39 &nbsp;p.m. on channel 16, the radio distress frequency. They instructed him to call back on channel 12 because they wanted to keep their emergency channel open and they were having difficulty with their communication systems, including antennas blown down by the storm.<ref name="Schumacher, p. 79">[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 79.</ref><ref name="Hemming, p. 193">[[#refHemming1981|Hemming (1981)]], p. 193.</ref> Cooper then called the upbound saltwater vessel ''Nanfri'' and was told that they could not pick up the ''Fitzgerald'' on their radar.<ref name="Hemming, p. 193"/> Cooper repeatedly attempted to raise the Coast Guard again but was not successful until 7:54 &nbsp;p.m. when they asked him to keep watch for a 16-foot outboard lost in the area.<ref name="Schumacher, p. 79"/><ref name="Hemming, p. 193"/> At about 8:25&nbsp;p.m., Cooper called the U. S. Coast Guard to express his concern about the ''Fitzgerald''.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], p. 30.</ref> Cooper called the Coast Guard again at 9:03&nbsp;p.m. and reported that the ''Fitzgerald'' was missing.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], p. 34.</ref> Petty Officer Philip Branch would later testify, "I considered it serious, but at the time it was not urgent."<ref name="Schumacher, p. 83">[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 83.</ref>

The Coast Guard lacked appropriate search-and-rescue vessels to respond to the ''Fitzgerald'' disaster.<ref name="Schumacher, p. 83"/> At approximately 9:00 &nbsp;p.m, the Coast Guard asked the ''Anderson'' to turn around and look for survivors.<ref name="Casualty Report, p. 36">[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], p. 36.</ref> At approximately 10:30 &nbsp;p.m, the Coast Guard asked the commercial vessels anchored in or near Whitefish Bay to assist in the search.<ref name="Casualty Report, p. 36"/>   The initial search for survivors consisted of the ''Arthur M. Anderson'', and a second freighter, [[SS William Clay Ford|SS ''William Clay Ford'']]. The efforts of a third freighter, the Canadian vessel ''[[Hilda Marjanne]]'', were foiled by the weather. The Coast Guard sent a buoy tender from Duluth, Minnesota, [[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|''Woodrush'']], that was able to launch within two and a half hours, but took a day to arrive at the search area.<ref name="Schumacher, p. 97">[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p. 97.</ref><ref name="Hemming, p. 195">[[#refHemming1981|Hemming (1981)]], p. 195.</ref> The [[Traverse City, Michigan]] Coast Guard station launched a [[Grumman HU-16 Albatross|HU-16]] fixed wing search aircraft that arrived on the scene at 10:53 &nbsp;p.m. and a [[Sikorsky S-62|HH-52]] helicopter with a 3.8-million-[[candlepower]] searchlight that arrived at 1:00 &nbsp;a.m. on November 11.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 166.</ref><ref name="Hemming, p. 195"/>  [[Canadian Coast Guard]] aircraft joined the three day search.

===Legal settlement===
Although the ''Fitzgerald'' sank in Canadian water, the sinking was governed by [[United States admiralty law|American admiralty law]]. Under the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920]], ships, such as the ''Fitzgerald'', that transport goods between United States ports, must be U.S.-flag ships. Ships are governed by the admiralty courts of their flag country, and as a U.S.-flag ship, the ''Fitzgerald'' was subject to U.S. admiralty law, even when the location of the dispute is in foreign water.<ref>{{cite web | title= Admiralty and Maritime Law Research Guide|date= 2010|url= http://law.loyno.edu/~beisen/maritime.html|publisher=[[Loyola University New Orleans]] Law Library|first=|last=|accessdate=2010-12-25.}}</ref> United States admiralty law gives jurisdiction on admiralty matters to federal courts.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001333----000-.html 28 U.S.C. <U+00A7>1333].</ref>  Use of the [[Limitation Act]] in cases such as the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] and legal precedent from the [[SS Eastland|''Eastland'']] and ''Bradley'' sinkings established that if the vessel owner and operators were not negligent or at fault, then the value of lost life would be based on the salvage value of the ship and compensation to survivors would be paid by the owner.<ref>Rattigan, William (1960). "Great Lakes Shipwrecks & Survivals", p. 67, Galahad Books, New York. ISBN 3-7200-00010--3708.</ref><ref name="Toledo Express"/>  The ''Fitzgerald'' was valued at $24 million making it the greatest financial loss in Great Lakes sailing. A 26,116 ton taconite cargo was lost with it.<ref name="Wolff, p. 218"/>  The NTSB and Coast Guard findings absolved the ''Fitzgerald'' owner and operator of blame despite evidence of its structural and maintenance problems.<ref name="Toledo Express"/>   ''Fitzgerald'' author Hemming reasoned that the Coast Guard's conclusions "were benign in placing blame on either the company or the captain ... [and] saved the Obleby-Norton from very expensive lawsuits by the families of the lost crew."<ref>[[#refHemming1981|Hemming (1981)]], p. 226.</ref>

In the ''Bradley'' case, the admiralty court appointed a commissioner to take testimony for claims and recommend apportionments for surviving families based on average earnings, length of service, life expectancy, and family status.  This legal procedure never happened with the ''Fitzgerald'' families.  Instead, the owner and operator filed a petition in a U.S. District court to determine liability before official findings on the probable cause of the ''Fitzgerald'' sinking were issued.  The operator rather than the owner paid compensation to surviving families about 12 months in advance of the official findings of probable cause and on the condition of imposed confidentiality agreements.   In contrast to the ''Fitzgerald'' settlement, the ''Bradley'' settlement was paid by the owner after the official findings of cause and the recommended settlement amounts were made public.<ref name="Toledo Express"/>

==Discovery and underwater surveys==

===1975 discovery===

The wreck was first located on 14 November approximately {{convert|17|mi|nmi km}} from the entrance of [[Whitefish Bay]] at {{Coord|46|59.91|N|85|06.6|W}} very near the [[International Boundary]] in Canadian waters<ref name="NTSB Report, p. 6"/> at a depth of {{convert|530|ft}} by a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] aircraft with on-board [[magnetic anomaly detector]] equipment,<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], p. 39.</ref> normally used to detect submarines. The wreck was further surveyed using [[side scan sonar]] on November 14 to November 16 by the Coast Guard. The sonar revealed two large objects lying close together on the lake floor. The Navy also contracted with Seaward, Inc. to conduct a second survey from November 22 through November 25.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 58.</ref>

===Surveys===

In 1976, from May 20 to May 28, an unmanned U.S. Navy [[submersible]] photographed the wreck. This submersible, [[CURV-III]], consisted of an underwater vehicle connected via umbilical control to a surface support ship. On-board imaging equipment included one [[135 film|35 mm]] [[still camera|still]] and two [[black-and-white]] [[Professional video camera|video cameras]]. It found ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' lying in two large pieces in {{convert|530|ft}} of water. The bow section, approximately {{convert|276|ft}} long, lay upright in the mud. The approximately {{convert|253|ft}} [[stern]] section lay {{convert|170|ft}} away, inverted (face down), at a 50-degree angle from the bow. Metal and taconite heaps between the bow and stern comprised the remnants of the mid-section.<ref>[[#refHemming1981|Hemming (1981)]], pp. 211&ndash;213.</ref>

While conducting research diving in Lake Superior in 1980, marine explorer [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]], son of [[Jacques Cousteau]], sent two divers from the [[RV Calypso|RV ''Calypso'']] in the first manned submersible dive to the ''Fitzgerald'' that lasted about 30 minutes.

==Theories on the cause of sinking==

[[Image:Edmond Fitzgerald relative position of wreck.jpg|thumb|right|USCG drawing of the relative positions of the wreck parts.]]The extreme weather and sea conditions play a role in all of the published theories<ref name = "Storm Technology"/> regarding her sinking; they differ on the other contributing causes.

===Waves and weather=== 

In 2005 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in conjunction with the National Weather Service ran a computer simulation covering the time period of November 9, 1975 to the early morning hours of November 11, 1975.  It included weather and wave conditions. The analysis showed that at 4&nbsp;p.m. on November 10 there were two separate areas of high wind over Lake Superior. One of them had speeds in excess of {{convert|43.45|kn|adj=on}} and the second had winds in excess of {{convert|40|kn|adj=on}}. The highest winds occurred over the southeastern part of Lake Superior where the ''Fitzgerald'' was heading. Average wave heights increased to near {{convert|19|ft}} by 7&nbsp;p.m., November 10th and winds were exceeding {{convert|43.45|kn|adj=on}} over most of southeastern Lake Superior.<ref name = "Storm Technology">{{cite web |title= Reexamination of the 9 <U+2013> 10 November 1975 "''Edmund Fitzgerald''" Storm Using Today<U+2019>s Technology|date= May 2006|url= http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-87-5-607|publisher=[http://journals.ametsoc.org AMS Journal Online for Bulletin of American Meteorological Society]|first= |last=Hultquist T. R., Dutter, M. R., & Schwab, D. J.|accessdate=2010-12-26.}}</ref><ref name = "NOAASimulation">{{cite web |title= The Witch of November: What sank the Edmund Fitzgerald|date= 2010-11-10|url= http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/weather/weather_news/the-witch-of-november%3A-what-sank-the-edmund-fitzgerald|publisher=[http://www.newsnet5.com Newsnet5.com]|first=Mark|last=Johnson |accessdate=2010-12-26.}}</ref> 

The ''Fitzgerald'' sank at the eastern edge of the area of high wind where the long fetch (distance that the wind blows over water) produced significant wave heights averaging over {{convert|23|ft}} by 7&nbsp;p.m. and over {{convert|25|ft}} at 8&nbsp;p.m. The simulation also showed one in 100 waves reaching a height {{convert|36|ft}} and one out of every 1000 waves reaching a height of {{convert|46|ft}}. Since the ship was heading east-southeastward, the waves were likely causing the Fitzgerald to roll heavily.<ref name = "Storm Technology"/><ref name = "NOAASimulation"/>

At the time of the sinking, the ship, ''Arthur M Anderson'', reported NW winds of {{convert|49.5|kn|adj=on}} which matched the computer analysis result of {{convert|46.9|kn|adj=on}}. The analysis showed that the maximum sustained winds reached near hurricane force, sustained at near {{convert|60.8|kn|adj=on}} with gusts to {{convert|74.7|kn|adj=on}} at the time and location where the ''Fitzgerald'' sank.<ref name = "Storm Technology"/><ref name = "NOAASimulation"/>

===Breaking apart===

When ''Fitzgerald'' first vanished, it was widely believed the boat had snapped in half on the lake surface owing to storm action. Similar surface breakups in the past resulted in wide variation in how the sections were distributed on the lake bottom. The [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], [[SS Carl D. Bradley|SS ''Carl D. Bradley'']], and [[SS Daniel J. Morrell|SS ''Daniel J. Morrell'']] all broke apart in two sections on the surface. The ''Titanic'' sections sank in {{convert|12,500|ft}} feet of water approximately {{convert|2000|ft}} apart. The ''Bradley'' sections sank in {{convert|320|to|380|ft}} of water approximately {{convert|90|ft}} apart. The ''Morrell'' sections sank in {{convert|220|ft}} of water approximately {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} apart.<ref>{{cite web |title=Morrell Survey: Finale|url= http://www.lakelandboating.com/morrell/page4.cfm|first= Ronald|last=Schultz |accessdate=2010-11-19|publisher= [http://www.lakelandboating.com Lakeland Boating]}}</ref><ref name="Expedition <U+2018>97">{{cite web |title=Expedition <U+2019>97 to the Carl D. Bradley |url= http://www.boatnerd.com/bradley|first= |last= |accessdate=2010-11-20|publisher=[http://www.boatnerd.com BoatNerd]}}</ref> 

Because the 1976 CURV III survey found the ''Fitzgerald'' sections were {{convert|170|ft}} from each other, the Coast Guard's formal casualty report of July 1977 concluded that it had instead separated upon hitting the lake floor.<ref name="Wolff, p. 223">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 223.</ref> However, after maritime historian Frederick Stonehouse served as a moderator on the panel reviewing the video footage from the 1989 ROV dive to the ''Fitzgerald'', he concluded that the extent of taconite coverage on the wreck site and spilled on the forward section resulted from the stern floating on the surface for a short time. It was his opinion that the two sections of the wreck did not sink at the same time.<ref name="Stonehouse, p. 217 "/> The 1994 Shannon team found that the stern and the bow were actually {{convert|255|ft}} apart. Shannon concluded that the ''Fitzgerald'' broke apart on the surface.<ref name="Bishop,  p. 86"/>  He said: <blockquote>This placement does not support the theory that the ship plunged to the bottom in one piece, breaking apart when it struck bottom. If this were true, the two sections would be much closer. In addition, the angle, repose and mounding of clay and mud at the site indicate the stern rolled over on the surface, spilling taconite ore pellets from its severed cargo hold, and then landed on portions of the cargo itself.<ref name="Bishop,  p. 86"/> </blockquote>

===Three sisters/rogue wave theory===

Three large [[rogue wave (oceanography)|rogue waves]] were reported on November 10 when the ''Fitzgerald'' sank.<ref name="Bishop, p. 85"/><ref name="Wolff, pp. 226&ndash;227">[[#refWoff1979| Wolff (1979)]], pp. 226&ndash;227.</ref><ref name="Thompson, p. 324">[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 324.</ref> Such a grouping of waves is often called "three sisters". This phenomenon is said to occur on [[Lake Superior]] when a series of three waves form that are one-third larger than the regular waves. The second wave hits the ship's deck before the first wave clears. The third incoming wave adds to the two accumulated backwashes and suddenly overloads the ship deck with tons of water.<ref name="Bishop, p. 85"/><ref name="Wolff, p. 226"/>

Captain Cooper of the ''Anderson'' reported that the ship was "hit by two {{convert|30|to|35|foot|m}} seas about 6:30 p.m., one burying the after cabins and damaging a lifeboat by pushing it right down onto the saddle. The second wave of this size, perhaps {{convert|35|foot|m}}, came over the bridge deck." Cooper reported that these two waves and possibly a third continued in the direction of the ''Fitzgerald'' and would have struck it about the time it sank.<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p.  112.</ref><ref name="Wolff, pp. 226&ndash;227"/><ref name="Thompson, p. 324"/>It was theorized that the triplet rogue waves compounded the problems of the ''Fitzgerald's'' known list and slowed speed in heavy seas which already allowed water to stay on its deck for a longer period of time.<ref>[[#refKantar2006|Kantar (1998)]],  p. 34</ref><ref name="Wolff, p. 227">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 227.</ref>

===Flooding of cargo hold from ineffective hatch closures or collapsed hatch covers===

The April 15, 1977 Coast Guard Marine Casualty Report postulated that the accident was caused by ineffective hatch closures. These devices were unable to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold. The flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day, and finally resulted in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability. As a result, the boat plummeted to the bottom without warning.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 71.</ref><ref name="Wolff, p. 223"/>   The diving expeditions to the wreck site of the ''Fitzgerald'' documented that most of its hatch clamps were in perfect condition.  The Coast Guard Marine board concluded that the few clamps that were damaged were probably the only ones fastened and therefore ineffective hatch closure caused the Fitzgerald to flood and founder.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 2.</ref>

The Coast Guard report proved controversial. Almost from the beginning, some of the families and various labor organizations believed the Coast Guard findings could be tainted because there were serious questions regarding their preparedness and licensing and rules changes.<ref>[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 222.</ref> (Ret) U.S.C.G. [[Vice Admiral]] and President of the Lake Carriers Association Paul Trimble wrote a letter to the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) on September 16, 1977 that included the following statements of objection to the Coast Guard findings:<blockquote>The present hatch covers are an advanced design and are considered by the entire lake shipping industry to be the most significant improvement over the telescoping leaf covers previously used for many years.... The one-piece hatch covers have proven completely satisfactory in all weather conditions without a single vessel loss in almost 40 years of use... and no water accumulation in cargo holds...<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 12.</ref></blockquote>

To avoid paying overtime even in foul weather, it was common practice for ore freighters to set out  with not all of the clamps locked in place on the hatch covers.  If weather permitted, all of the clamps were eventually set.<ref name="Wolff, p. 228">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 228.</ref> Captain Paquette of the ''Sykes'' was dismissive that unlocked hatch clamps caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to founder.  He said that he commonly sailed in nice weather with a minimum of clamps necessary to secure the hatch covers.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 83.</ref>

The May 4, 1978 NTSB findings differed from the Coast Guard. The NTSB conducted computer studies,<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 181.</ref> testing and analysis to determine the forces necessary to collapse the hatch covers.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], p. 14.</ref> The NTSB concluded that the ''Fitzgerald'' sank suddenly from massive flooding of the cargo hold "due to the collapse of one or more of the hatch covers under the weight of giant boarding seas" instead of flooding gradually due to ineffective hatch closures.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], pp. 178&ndash;179.</ref><ref name="Wolff, p. 224">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 224.</ref> The NTSB dissenting opinion held that that the ''Fitzgerald'' sank suddenly and unexpectedly from [[shoal]]ing.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 190.</ref>

===Shoaling===

The Lake Carriers' Association (LCA) strongly disagreed with the Coast Guard's conclusion that the ''Fitzgerald'' [[wikt:founder|founder]]ed due to hatch cover leakage. They believed the more probable cause was that the ''Fitzgerald'' [[wikt:grounded|grounded]] or shoaled in the Six Fathom Shoal northwest of [[Caribou Island (Lake Superior)|Caribou Island]] by unknowingly raking a [[reef]] when the Whitefish Point light and radio beacon was not available to guide them.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]],  pp. 7&ndash;9.</ref><ref name="Wolff, p. 224"/> This theory was supported by a 1976 Canadian hydrographic survey that disclosed that an unknown shoal ran a mile further east of Six Fathom Shoal than shown on the Canadian charts. Officers from the ''Anderson'' observed that the ''Fitzgerald'' sailed through this very area.<ref name="Wolff, p. 224"/> Conjecture by proponents of the Six Fathom Shoal theory concluded that the ''Fitzgerald's'' downed fence rail reported by McSorley could only occur if the ship "hogged" during shoaling, with the bow and stern bent downward and the mid section raised by the shoal, pulling the railing tight until the cables dislodged or tore under the strain.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 6.</ref>

The Coast Guard investigation for hull damage of the bow found that:<blockquote>The {{convert|28|foot}} load mark is visible just above the mud line and the hull beneath that is buried in mud. The bow above the mud is damaged on both sides immediately adjacent to the [[Stem (ship)|stem]].... Movement of the survey vehicle disturbed the mud, which limited visibility and made it difficult to identify individual components of the wreckage."<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], pp. 51&ndash;53.</ref></blockquote>

The line of reasoning for the shoaling theory was challenged by Shannon's 1994 excellent quality of detailed photography of the ''Fitzgerald's'' overturned stern that showed "no evidence on the bottom of the stern, the propeller or the rudder of the ship that would indicate the ship struck a shoal."<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 222.</ref><ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]],  pp. 8&ndash;9.</ref> Divers searched the Six Fathom Shoal after the wreck and found no evidence of "a recent collision or grounding anywhere on the shoal."<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 74.</ref><ref name="Bishop, p. 9">[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 9.</ref>

Opponents of the shoaling theory argued that when the LCA supported this explanation, they represented the shipping company's interests by advocating a theory that made the LCA companies, the [[American Bureau of Shipping]], and the Coast Guard blameless.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 83.</ref><ref name="Bishop, p. 9"/> 

Paul Hainault, a retired mechanical engineering professor from [[Michigan Technological University]], promoted a theory that began as a student class project.  The theory held that the ''Fitzgerald'' grounded on Superior Shoal.<ref name="Stonehouse, p. 239 ">[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 239.</ref><ref>[[# Hainault1998|Hainault (1998)]], p. 36.</ref> Superior Shoal, discovered in 1930, is an underwater mountain in the middle of Lake Superior with sharp peaks rising nearly to the surface.   Its depths range from {{convert |22|to |400|ft}} and make it a menace to navigation.  Its discovery resulted in a change in recommended shipping routes.  It was speculated that the minesweepers ''Inkerman'' and  ''Cerisolles'' enroute from Fort Williams to Sault Ste. Marie sank at Superior Shoal in 1918.<ref name="Lake Survey">{{cite web | title= Charting the inland seas: a history of the U.S. Lake Survey |date= 1994|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PjcUrS0vZGcC&pg=PA121&dq=Superior+Shoal&hl=en&ei=XzwCTfEqy8qcB-qxqeUN&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=Superior%20Shoal&f=false|publisher=[http://books.google.com/books Google Books]; Wayne State University Press.|first= Arthur M.|last= Woodford|accessdate=2010-12-10, 121.}}</ref>

A [[Seiche|seiche]] that occurred during the low pressure system over Lake Superior on 10 November 1975 caused the lake to raise {{convert|3|ft}} over the Soo Locks gates to flood Portage Avenue in Sault Ste. Marie with a {{convert|1|foot}} of water.<ref name="Stonehouse, p. 239"/><ref>[[# Hainault1998|Hainault (1998)]], p. 34.</ref><ref>Pat Knight, "Eastern U.P. battered," Evening News, 1975-11-11.</ref> Hainault<U+2019>s theory held that this seiche contributed to the Fitzgerald shoaling {{convert|200| ft}} of her hull on Superior Shoal at about 48<U+00B0>3<U+2019>N 87<U+00B0>8<U+2019>W for 10 seconds on 10 November 2010 at 9:30 to 9:45&nbsp; a.m., causing the hull to be punctured mid-body.  The theory contended that the wave action continued to damage the Fitzgerald<U+2019>s hull for the next 9 1/2 hours until the middle third of the hull dropped out like a box, leaving the ship held together by the center deck.  The stern section acted as a "giant sea anchor" and caused the Fitzgerald to come to a full stop, causing everything to go forward.  The ship broke apart on the surface within seconds.  Compressed air pressure blew out a hole in the starboard bow which sank 18 degrees off course.  The rear kept going forward with the engine still running and rolled to port, "so the bottom can be seen for the grounding evidence that is clearly visible today."<ref>[[# Hainault1998|Hainault (1998)]], p. 84.</ref>  In 1996, Hainault differed from other theorist's interpretations of photographic evidence of the ''Fitzgerald'' wreck.  He claimed that underwater photos of the Fitzgerald wreck showed metal plating "torn like so much paper" and pushed in on the stern<U+2019>s hull.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], pp. 240&ndash;541.</ref><ref>[[# Hainault1998|Hainault (1998)]], pp. 75&ndash;79.</ref>

===Structural failure===

Another published theory contends that an already weakened structure, and modification of the winter [[Ship's load line|load line]] (allowing heavier loading, and travel 39" lower in the water) contributed to the large waves causing a stress fracture in the hull. It postulated this based on the "regular" huge waves of the storm, i.e. not necessarily involving rogue waves.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 84.</ref>

The stress fracture theory was supported by the testimony of former crewmen. Former [[Second Mate]] Richard Orgel, who served on the ''Fitzgerald'' 1972 - 1973, testified that "the ship had a tendency to bend and spring during storms <U+2018>like a diving board after somebody has jumped off.<U+2019>"<ref name="Wolff, p. 227">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 227.</ref> Orgel was quoted as saying that the loss of the ''Fitzgerald'' was caused by hull failure, "pure and simple. I detected undue stress in the side tunnels by examining the white enamel paint, which will crack and splinter when submitted to severe stress."<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 90.</ref> George H. (Red) Burgner, ''Fitzgerald'' [[Chief steward|Steward]] for ten seasons and winter ship-keeper for seven years, testified in a deposition that a "loose [[keel]]" contributed to the vessel<U+2019>s loss. Burgner further testified that welds along the keel and sister [[kelson]]s were only tack welded and that he personally observed that many of the welds were broken. Burgner was not asked to testify before the Marine Board of Inquiry.<ref name="Wolff, p. 227"/>

When [[Bethlehem Steel|Bethlehem Steel Corporation]]  permanently laid up the ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' sister ship, SS ''Arthur B. Homer'', just five years after going to considerable expense to lengthen her, this raised questions whether both ships had the same structural problems.  The ''Fitzgerald'' and ''Homer'' were built in the same shipyard using welded joints to replace many of the riveted joints used in older ore freighters. Riveted joints allow the ship to flex and work in heavy seas while welded joints are more likely to break.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 92.</ref> Reports indicate that repair to the ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' hull was delayed in 1975 due to plans to lengthen its hull during the upcoming winter layup. The ''Homer'' was lengthened to {{convert|825|ft}} and placed back in service by December 1975 not long after the ''Fitzgerald'' foundered. In 1978, Bethlehem Steel Corporation gave no explanation when it denied permission for the chairman of the NTSB to travel on the ''Homer''. The ''Homer'' was permanently laid up in 1980 and broken for scrap in 1987.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 93.</ref>

Retired GLEW naval architect Raymond Ramsey was on the design team for the hull of the ''Fitzgerald'' when it was built.  After reviewing the increased load lines, maintenance history, and history of long ship hull failure, Ramsey concluded that the ''Fitzgerald'' was not seaworthy on 10 November 1975.  He stated that designing the ''Fitzgerald'' for compatibility with the St. Lawrence Seaway placed its hull design in a "straight jacket".  The ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' long ship design was developed without the benefit of [[Research and development|research, development, test, and evaluation]] principles and computerized analytic technology was not yet available when it was built.  He noted that the ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' hull was built with an all-welded (instead of riveted) modular fabrication method that was used for the first time in the GLEW shipyard.  Ramsey concluded that increasing the hull length to {{convert|729|ft}} resulted in a L/D slenderness ratio that caused excessive multi-axial bending and springing of the hull and that the hull should have been structurally reinforced for its increased length.<ref name="Toledo Express">Ramsey, Raymond, M.Sc.

===Topside damage===

The Coast Guard agreed that topside damage was a reasonable alternative reason for the ''Fitzgerald'' sinking and they surmised that damage to the fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log.<ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 325.</ref> Historian and mariner Mark Thompson instead thought the more plausible explanation was that something broke loose from the ''Fitzgerald's'' deck. He theorized that the loss of the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list and that there was more extensive damage than McSorley could detect in the pilot house that allowed water to flood the cargo hold. Thompson concluded that the topside damage the ''Fitzgerald'' experienced at 3:30 pm on November 10 compounded by the heavy seas was the most obvious explanation for why she sank. He wrote that to ignore the incontrovertible evidence of the ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' topside damage was "analogous to theorizing that ''Titanic'' was sunk by a German U-boat".<ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 328.</ref>

==Contributing factors to sinking==
[[File:SS Edmund Fitzgerald scale model.jpg|thumb|right|Scale model of the SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']]
The Coast Guard, NTSB, and proponents of alternative theories named multiple possible contributing factors to the foundering of the ''Fitzgerald''.

===Weather forecasting===

The NWS long range forecast on November 9, 1975 predicted that a storm would pass just south of Lake Superior and over [[Keweenaw Peninsula]].  Captain Paquette of the ''Sykes'' had been following and charting the low pressure system over [[Oklahoma]] since November 8 and analyzed that a major storm would track across eastern Lake Superior.  He chose a route that gave the ''Sykes'' the most protection and during the worst of the storm took refuge in [[Thunder Bay]].  Based on NWS forecast, the ''Anderson'' and ''Fitzgerald'' instead started their trip across Lake Superior following the regular LCA route that placed them in the path of the storm.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. xii.</ref> The NTSB investigation concluded that the NWS failed to accurately predict wave heights on November 10.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], p. 21.</ref>

===Inaccurate navigational charts===

After reviewing testimony that the ''Fitzgerald'' had passed near shoals north of Caribou Island, the Coast Guard Marine Board examined navigational charts.  The Marine Board found that the Canadian 1973 navigational chart for the Six Fathom Shoal area was based on Canadian surveys from 1916 and 1919 and that the 1973 U.S. Lake Survey Chart No. 9 included the notation, "Canadian Areas.  For data concerning Canadian areas, Canadian authorities have been consulted."  At the request of the Marine Board and the Commander of the  U.S. Coast Guard Ninth District, the [[Canadian Hydrographic Service]] conducted a survey of the area surrounding [[Michipicoten Island]] and Caribou Island In 1976.   The survey revealed that the shoal ran about {{convert|1|mi}} further east than shown on Canadian charts.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], pp. 86&ndash;87</ref> The NTSB investigation found that at the time of the ''Fitzgerald'' foundering, Lake Survey Chart No. 9 was not detailed enough to indicate the six fathom shoal hazard to navigation.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], pp. 21, 23.</ref>

===Lack of watertight bulkheads between cargo holds===

Great Lakes freighters lack of watertight bulkheads in the cargo holds made them like "motorized super barges" when comparing their construction to ocean-going vessels.  Ocean-vessels could sustain significant damage to the bow or hull without foundering because they were built with watertight bulkheads.  After the ''Fitzgerald'' foundered, Great Lakes shipping companies were accused of valuing cargo [[Cargo|payloads]] more than human life.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], pp. 105, 105&ndash;106.</ref> The ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' {{ft3 to m3|860950|abbr=yes}} cargo hold was divided by two non-watertight traverse "screen" bulkheads.  The NTSB ''Fitzgerald'' investigation concluded that Great Lakes freighters should be constructed with watertight bulkheads in the cargo holds.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], p. 25.</ref>

The Coast Guard proposed rules for watertight bulkheads in Great Lakes vessels as far back as the sinking of the ''Morrell'' and  again after the sinking of the ''Fitzgerald'', arguing that this would allow ships to make it to refuge or at least allow crew members to abandon ship in an orderly fashion. The LCA represented the Great Lakes fleet owners and was able to forestall watertight subdivision regulations<ref>[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=e3a5202b7436db576ecc9d8be46a303a&rgn=div8&view=text&node=46:7.0.1.3.14.2.63.2&idno=46 46 U.S.C. <U+00A7>179.212].</ref> by arguing that this would cause economic hardship for vessel operators.  A few vessel operators have built Great Lakes ships with watertight subdivisions in the cargo holds since 1975 but most vessels operating on the lakes cannot prevent flooding of the entire cargo hold area.<ref>[[#refThomspon1991|Thompson (1991)]], p. 168.</ref>

===Lack of instrumentation ===

The Coast Guard did not require the ''Fitzgerald'' to have a [[fathometer]], and the ''Fitzgerald'' did not have one.  A hand lead was the only method the ''Fitzgerald'' had to take depth soundings.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], p. 9.</ref>  The [[Sounding line|lead line]] was the same sounding method used during [[Mark Twain]]'s time. It consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals and a lead on the end of it.  The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the depth.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 102.</ref> The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided the ''Fitzgerald'' additional navigational data and made it less dependent on the ''Anderson'' for navigational assistance.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], p. 23.</ref>

The ''Fitzgerald'' had no system to monitor the presence or amount of water in its cargo hold even though there was always some water there. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck.  The Coast Guard Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water reached the top of the taconite cargo.<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p.  134.</ref> The NTSB investigation found that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 180.</ref><ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], pp.  17, 23.</ref>  The Marine Board noted that the Fitzgerald had no way to determine if it lost freeboard because it did not have a draft-reading system.<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p.  135.</ref>

===Increased load lines, reduced freeboard===

The Coast Guard increased the ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' load line in 1969, 1971, and 1973 to allow {{convert|3|ft}} {{convert|3.25|in|adj=on}} less minimum [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] than the ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' design allowed in 1958.<ref name="Wolff, p. 223"/><ref name="NTSB Report, p. 8">[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], p.  8.</ref> The ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' freeboard was reduced to {{convert|11.5|ft}} when it faced wave heights up to {{convert|35|ft}} in the November 10 storm.<ref name="NTSB Report, p. 8"/><ref>[[#refUSCGReport|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], p. 71.</ref>
The observations made on the ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' keel problems began during the time the Coast Guard started increasing its load line.  The changes in load line and freeboard caused a reduction in the ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' critical reserve buoyancy.  It was said to be a good riding ship until its load lines were increased but afterward became a sluggish ship, slower to respond and recover.  McSorley said he did not like the action of the ship he described as the "wiggling thing" that scared him.  The ''Fitzgerald'' bow hooked to one side or the other in heavy seas without recovering and made a groaning sound not heard on other ships.<ref name="Wolff, p. 228"/>

===Maintenance===

The NTSB investigation noted that the ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' prior [[Ship grounding|groundings]] could have caused damage that was unknown that led to major structural failure since Great Lakes vessels were normally [[drydock]]ed only every 5 years.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], p. 23.</ref> It was alleged that when compared to the ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' previous captain, McSorley did not keep up with routine maintenance and he did not confront the mates about getting the work done.<ref name="Wolff, p. 228"/> After President of the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing Metals]] August B. Herbel Jr. examined photographs of the welds on the ''Fitzgerald'', he stated, "The hull was just being held together with patching plates."  Other questions were raised about why the Coast Guard did not discover and take corrective action in its pre-November 1975 inspection of the ''Fitzgerald'' if its hatch coamings, gaskets, and clamps were poorly maintained.<ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 349.</ref>

===Complacency===

On November 10, 1975, McSorley reported he had never seen bigger seas in his life.<ref name="Wolff, p. 221"/> Captain Paquette, master of ''Wilfred Sykes'' out in the same storm said, "I<U+2019>ll tell anyone that it was a ''monster'' sea washing solid water over the deck of every vessel out there."<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 108.</ref> The Coast Guard did not broadcast that all ships should seek safe anchorage until after 3:35&nbsp;p.m. on November 10, many hours after the weather was upgraded from a gale to a storm.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], p. 27.</ref>

McSorley was known as a "heavy weather captain"<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], pp. 22, 76.</ref> who "'beat hell' out of the ''Fitzgerald'' and 'very seldom ever hauled up for weather'".<ref name="Wolff, p. 228"/> Paquette held the opinion that negligence caused the ''Fitzgerald'' to founder.  He said, "In my opinion, all the subsequent events arose because [McSorley] kept pushing that ship and didn't have enough training in weather forecasting to use common sense and pick a route out of the worst of the wind and seas."<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 76.</ref>  Paquette's vessel was the first to reach a discharge port after the November 10 storm and was met by company attorneys who came aboard the ''Wilfred Sykes''.  He told the attorneys that the ''Fitzgerald'' foundering was caused by negligence.<ref name="Bishop, p. 30">[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 30.</ref>  He was never asked to testify for the Coast Guard or NTSB investigations.<ref name="Bishop, p. 30">[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 30.</ref>

The NTSB investigation noted that Great Lakes cargo vessels can normally avoid severe storms and the operation of vessels in sea states should be avoided.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], pp.  24, 25.</ref> However, the shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather.<ref>[[#refBishop2000|Bishop (2000)]], p. 74.</ref><ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 333.</ref> At the time of the ''Fitzgerald'' foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulating agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had wrecked in storms.  The United States Coast Guard's position was that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail.<ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 315.</ref>

The United States Coast Guard Marine Board issued the following conclusion:<blockquote>The nature of Great Lakes shipping, with short voyages, much of the time in very protected waters, frequently with the same routine from trip to trip, leads to complacency and an overly optimistic attitude concerning the extreme weather conditions that can and do exist.  The Marine Board feels that this attitude reflects itself at times in deferral of maintenance and repairs, in failure to prepare properly for heavy weather, and in the conviction that since refuges are near, safety is possible by "running for it."  While it is true that sailing conditions are good during the summer season, changes can occur abruptly, with severe storms and extreme weather and sea conditions arising rapidly.  This tragic accident points out the need for all persons involved in Great Lakes shipping to foster increased awareness of the hazards which exist.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], p. 103.</ref></blockquote>

It was countered that "the Coast Guard laid bare their own complacency" by blaming the sinking of the ''Fitzgerald'' on industry-wide complacency since they inspected the ''Fitzgerald'' just two weeks before it sank.<ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 349.</ref>  The loss of the ''Fitzgerald'' exposed the Coast Guard's lack of rescue capability on Lake Superior.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 109.</ref>  Maritime author Mark Thompson said that ongoing budget cuts had limited the Coast Guard's ability to perform its historical functions.  He further noted that the Coast Guard vessels would likely not reach the scene of a vessel casualty on Lake Superior or Lake Huron for 6 to 12 hours.<ref>[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 369.</ref>

==Changes to Great Lakes shipping practice after ''Fitzgerald'' sinking==

The Coast Guard investigation of the ''Fitzgerald'' sinking resulted in 15 recommendations regarding load lines, weathertight integrity, search and rescue capability, lifesaving equipment, crew training, loading manuals, and providing information to Masters of Great Lakes vessels.<ref>[[#refUSCGReport1977|USCG Casualty Report (1977)]], pp. 105&ndash;108.</ref> The NTSB investigation resulted in 19 recommendations for the Coast Guard, four recommendations for the American Bureau of Shipping, and two recommendations for NOAA.<ref>[[#refNTSBReport1978|NTSB Accident Report (1978)]], pp. 24&ndash;27.</ref> Of the official recommendations, the following actions and USCG regulations were put in place:
:1.  In 1977, the USCG began requiring the use of depth finders on all vessels 1600 tons and over.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 182.</ref>
:2.  Since 1980, [[survival suit]]s are required aboard ship in each man<U+2019>s quarters and in his customary work station with [[strobe light]]s affixed to life jackets and survival suits.<ref name="Wolff, p. 228"/><ref name="Thompson, p. 329">[[#refThompson2000|Thompson (2000)]], p. 329.</ref>
:3.  A [[LORAN|LORAN-C]] positioning system for navigation the Great Lakes was implemented in 1980 and was replaced with [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) in the 1990s.<ref>[[#refStonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 187.</ref><ref name="Wolff, p. 228"/>
:4.  [[Distress radiobeacon|Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons]] (EPIRB) are installed on all Great Lakes vessels for immediate and accurate location in event of a disaster.<ref name="Thompson, p. 329"/>
:5.  Navigational charts in northeastern Lake Superior were improved for accuracy and greater detail.<ref name="Wolff, p. 229">[[#refWolff1979|Wolff (1979)]], p. 229.</ref>
:6.  NOAA revised its method for predicting wave heights.<ref name="Wolff, p. 229"/>
:7.  The USCG rescinded the 1973 Load Line Regulation amendment that permitted reduced freeboard loadings<ref name="Toledo Express"/> 
:8.  The USCG began the pre-November inspection program recommended by the NTSB.  "Coast Guard inspectors now board all U.S. ships during the fall to inspect hatch and vent closures and lifesaving equipment of all US ships."<ref>[[#refThomspon1991|Thompson (1991)]], p. 169.</ref>

===Musical tributes===
In 1976, Canadian singer-songwriter [[Gordon Lightfoot]] wrote, composed, and recorded (for his album ''[[Summertime Dream]]'') the song "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald", commemorating the events surrounding the sinking of the ship. The original lyrics take artistic license with the events of the actual sinking, and, in light of new evidence about the sinking, Lightfoot has modified one line for live performances.<ref>{{cite news| title = Lightfoot changes 'Edmund' lyrics | url = http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2010/03/25/13358031.html |date=2010-03-25|first=Jane|last=Stevenson|work=canoe.ca|accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> Canadian rock band [[Rheostatics]] covered the song on their second album, ''[[Melville (album)|Melville]]'', and included it on their live album ''[[Double Live (Rheostatics album)|Double Live]]''. [[The Dandy Warhols]] also covered the song during initial, rejected, recording sessions for their second album in 1996. These sessions were later released by the band as ''[[The Black Album (The Dandy Warhols album)|The Black Album]]'' in 2004.<ref>{{cite web | title = ARE Sound / The Dandy Warhols|year=2009| url = http://drownedinsound.com/releases/14515/reviews/4137385| accessdate = 2010-12-21| publisher =[[Drowned in Sound]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Black Album|publisher=[http://www.dandywarhols.com www.dandywarhols.com]|date=2007|url=http://www.dandywarhols.com/news/media/records/black-album/|accessdate=2010-12-21}}</ref> 

In 2005, Michigan based Northern-Rock band [[Great Lakes Myth Society]] included audio samples of transmissions from the ''Anderson'' relaying the suspected loss of the ''Fitzgerald'' to the Coast Guard in their song "Lake Effect."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Great+Lakes+Myth+Society/_/Lake+Effect|title=Great Lakes Myth Society <U+2013> Lake Effect (4:58)|publisher=last.fm|accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref>

Another 30th anniversary commemoration was a piano concerto entitled "The Edmund Fitzgerald" by American composer Geoffrey Peterson in 2002, which was premiered by the [[Sault Symphony Orchestra]] in Sault Ste.

=== Theatre and television ===

In 1986, writer [[Steven Dietz]] and songwriter/lyricist Eric Peltoniemi wrote the play with music ''Ten November'' in memory of the ''Fitzgerald's'' sinking. In 2005, the play was re-edited into a concert version called ''The Gales of November'',<ref>{{cite web | title = Minnesota Public Radio Presents | url = http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/programs/mpr_presents/archive/2005/ | date = November 26, 2005 | publisher = Minnesota Public Radio | accessdate = 2008-11-14 }}</ref> which opened on the 30th anniversary of the sinking at the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]].

"'''Mountie on the Bounty'''," a two-part episode of the Canadian police comedy-drama television series ''[[Due South]]'', aired on March 15, 1998 (part 1) and March 22, 1998 (part 2). The story featured the ''Robert Mackenzie,'' a fictional Canadian lake freighter slightly larger than the ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' (850 feet long by 80 feet wide), which suffered a nearly identical fate, right down to loss of radar and breaking in two.<ref name ="PaulGross">http://www.paulgross.org/music.htm</ref>
Executive producer and star [[Paul Gross]] obtained permission to use Gordon Lightfoot's song for the episode<U+2014>but on the condition the families of the sailors agree. Reluctant to cause the families additional grief, Gross and series composer [[Jay Semko]] instead wrote and composed "Thirty-Two Down on the ''Robert Mackenzie''".<ref name ="PaulGross"/>

===Commercialization===
The fame of the ''Fitzgerald<U+2019>s'' image and story made it public domain and subject to commercialization.<ref>[[#refSchumacher2005|Schumacher (2005)]], p.  173.</ref> A "cottage industry"<ref name="Stonehouse, p. 205 ">[[#Stonehouse2006|Stonehouse (2006)]], p. 205.</ref> has evolved across the Great Lakes region from Two Harbors, Minnesota to Whitefish Point as "ground zero"<ref name="Memories for sale ">Donnelly, Francis X.
