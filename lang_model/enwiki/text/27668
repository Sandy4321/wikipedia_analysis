'''Mary Berg''' (born October 10, 1924 in [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]], Poland) is a survivor of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and author of ''Warsaw Ghetto'', which contains personal journal entries written between 10 October 1939 and 5 March 1944, during the occupation of Poland in World War II. In June 1944, the publishing house Dial Press declined to publish the manuscript saying that the market was flooded with books about concentration camps and Nazi persecution.<ref>Laurence Weinbaum, "Niedosz<U+0142>y wydawca dziennika Mary Berg" Zag<U+0142>ada <U+017B>yd<U+00F3>w.
