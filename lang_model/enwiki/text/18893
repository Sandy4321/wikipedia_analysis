'''Mario Eduardo Lemus Hollands''' (born August 26, 1988) is an American [[professional baseball]] [[pitcher]] for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). He played [[college baseball]] for the [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos]], where he earned a degree in [[sociology]]. The Phillies drafted him in the [[2010 MLB Draft]], and after a few seasons in the [[farm system]], they invited him to [[spring training]] in 2014. After performing well in those exhibition games, he made the Phillies' 2014 [[Opening Day]] roster, and although he walked too many hitters, showed some potential to emerge as a decent relief pitcher. His teammates described him as a good personality to have in the bullpen, and his coaches approved of his development. Meanwhile, he is pursuing another college degree; he is studying [[merchandise marketing]] at the [[Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising]].

==Early life==
Hollands attended [[El Cerrito High School]] in [[El Cerrito, California]], where he played for the school's baseball team as a [[pitcher]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Maltby|first=Shawn|title=Oilers add freshman arms|url=http://peninsulaclarion.com/stories/020907/sports_0209spo002.shtml|accessdate=April 21, 2014|newspaper=Peninsula Clarion|date=February 9, 2007}}</ref>  He then enrolled at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB), where he played [[college baseball]] for the [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos baseball]] team. After [[redshirt (sports)|redshirting]] his first season, he was named the [[Big West Conference]] freshman of the year and received placement on the national freshman All-American team in 2008. His sophomore season was less successful, and was hampered by a groin injury. The [[Minnesota Twins]] drafted him in the subsequent draft, but he did not sign. He focused on bulking up and improving the velocity of his fastball, which gained about {{convert|3|mph|kph}} thanks to his work. In college, his coaches praised his mental toughness, a key to being a good pitcher.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Patton|first1=Mark|title=Mario Hollands Has Been Gaining National Recognition|url=http://ucsbgauchos.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/040810aad.html|website=UCSBGauchos.com|publisher=UC Santa Barbara Athletics|accessdate=February 10, 2015|date=April 8, 2010}}</ref> During the summers, he participated in the [[Cape Cod League]], and went on to have a strong senior season, during which he "was twice named the Big West Pitcher of the Week, twice named the National Pitcher of the Year, and tied a school record with a 16 strikeout performance."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shore|first1=Gregg|title=Mario Hollands|url=http://phuturephillies.com/profiles/the-graduated/mario-hollands-profile/|website=PhuturePhillies.com|publisher=Phuture Phillies|accessdate=February 10, 2015|date=February 5, 2011}}</ref> He graduated from UCSB with a degree in [[sociology]].<ref name=csn>{{cite web|last=Salisbury|first=Jim|title=Unassuming lefty Hollands could make Phils' staff|url=http://www.csnphilly.com/baseball-philadelphia-phillies/unassuming-lefty-hollands-could-make-phils-staff|work=CSNPhilly.com|publisher=Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia|accessdate=April 21, 2014|date=March 24, 2014}}</ref> The [[Philadelphia Phillies]] selected Hollands in the tenth round of the [[2010 Major League Baseball Draft]].<ref name=philly>{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=David|title=Phils taking long look at Hollands|url=http://articles.philly.com/2014-03-12/sports/48122598_1_grapefruit-league-phils-hamels|accessdate=April 21, 2014|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Daily News]]|date=March 12, 2014}}</ref>

===Major league career===
The Phillies invited Hollands to [[spring training]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Corey|title=Phillies invite Biddle, Franco, 3 others to ST|url=http://www.csnphilly.com/baseball-philadelphia-phillies/phillies-invite-biddle-franco-3-others-st|work=CSNPhilly.com|publisher=Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia|accessdate=April 21, 2014|date=January 8, 2014}}</ref> He made the team's Opening Day roster after compiling a 3.09&nbsp;ERA in nine exhibition appearances.<ref>{{cite web|last=Laymance|first=Austin|title=Hollands 'in shock' after making 25-man roster|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20140329&content_id=70414880&notebook_id=70415054&vkey=notebook_phi&c_id=phi|work=phillies.com: News|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=March 29, 2014|date=March 29, 2014}}</ref> His performance in spring training left Phillies' manager [[Ryne Sandberg]] and pitching coach [[Bob McClure]] "smitten," especially considering the fact that he entered spring training as a "veritable unknown."<ref name="gelb1"/> He made his major league debut on April 1, coming into the ninth [[inning]] of a tied game.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gelb|first=Matt|title=A peek into Ryne Sandberg's bullpen strategy|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/phillies_zone/A-peek-into-Ryne-Sandbergs-bullpen-strategy.html|accessdate=April 21, 2014|newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=April 2, 2014}}</ref> Hollands allowed two [[base on balls|walks]], before being relieved by [[B.

He walked 10.3% of batters he faced. Ryan Sommers of ''Crashburn Alley'' commented, {{quote|"Free passes aside, Hollands demonstrated the ability to generate swings and misses, and had the Goddess of Outcomes been a bit fairer to him, he may have been within spitting distance of league average effectiveness.

As spring training 2015 began, Hollands noted that he was not taking a spot in the bullpen for granted, and that he expected to compete with several other lefties.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zolecki|first1=Todd|title=Hollands committed to improve on rookie campaign|url=http://m.phillies.mlb.com/news/article/109932598/phillies-mario-hollands-committed-to-improve-on-rookie-campaign|website=phillies.com: News|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=February 21, 2015|date=February 21, 2015}}</ref> During spring training, he strained the [[common flexor tendon]] in his throwing arm.

==Personal life==
Cognizant that there is "life after baseball", in 2013, Hollands enrolled at the [[Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising]] to earn a degree [[merchandise marketing]].<ref name=csn/><ref name="dfs">{{cite journal|last1=Cordaro|first1=Colleen|editor1-last=Clark|editor1-first=Bonnie|title=Dressed for Success|journal=Phillies|volume=2014|issue=4|pages=36<U+2013>38|publisher=Philadelphia Phillies|format=Print}}</ref> He notes that fashion has permeated his life; he grew up in the [[Bay Area]] of [[California]], where fashion is "everywhere and a part of everyone's life in some way or another", and worked at an [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] store while in high school. He also frequently counsels his teammates on appropriate fashion choices.<ref name="dfs"/> Fellow reliever [[Jake Diekman]] characterized Hollands as having a "really good personality for the bullpen ...

While on the subway, he applies his degree in sociology by studying Philadelphians and their mannerisms.<ref name="dfs"/>

==Player profile==
A "funky" lefty who "throws hard and looks deceptive," Hollands' fastball hovers around {{convert|93|mph|kph}} but can modestly exceed that at times, a drastic increase from his velocity while pitching in the minor leagues, and a primary reason for his emergence on the Phillies' major league pitching staff.<ref name="gelb1"/><ref name="prospectus">{{cite web|last1=Pavlidis|first1=Harry|title=Pitcher Profile New Arms (and Pitches) of the Week|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=23212|website=[[Baseball Prospectus]]|publisher=Prospectus Entertainment Ventures|accessdate=January 25, 2015|date=April 3, 2014}}</ref> Secondarily, he throws a [[slider]], that "at its peak, can be impressive".<ref name="sommers">{{cite web|last1=Sommers|first1=Ryan|title=2014 Phillies Report Card: Mario Hollands|url=http://crashburnalley.com/2014/10/05/2014-phillies-report-card-mario-hollands/|website=Crashburn Alley|publisher=SweetSpot Network, an ESPN affiliate|accessdate=January 25, 2015|date=October 5, 2014}}</ref> At times, he struggles with his control, and issues walks with relative frequency, but as a young pitcher, shows potential to develop if he can avoid nibbling, and focus on directly attacking hitters with better command of his pitches within the strike zone.<ref name="sommers"/>
