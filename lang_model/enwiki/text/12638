The '''Julius W. Hegeler I House''' is a historic building in [[LaSalle, Illinois]], [[United States]]. Completed in 1904, the house was designed by [[Pond & Pond]] and is an excellent local example of [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts & Crafts]] architecture.

==History==
Julius W. Hegeler I was the eldest son of [[Edward C. Hegeler]], who established a prosperous [[zinc]] mining operation in [[LaSalle, Illinois]]. Born in 1867, Julius Hegeler studied mining engineering and joined the family business in his adulthood. He married Josephine Hulda Caesar in 1897 and had four children. In 1903, Hegeler received a {{convert|1+3/4|acre|adj=on}} plot of land from his father, across the street from the [[Hegeler Carus Mansion]].<ref name=nrhp>http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/223480.pdf</ref>

Hegeler commissioned [[Pond & Pond]], a leading firm in the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts & Crafts style]] to design the house. It was completed in 1904, although the Hegelers only lived there for a year. In late 1905, they moved to [[Danville, Illinois|Danville so that Hegeler could establish his own zinc smelting company with his brother Herman. Pond & Pond also designed a house for Herman, but it was demolished around 1950.<ref name=nrhp/>

The Hegeler house remained in the hands of the family until 1970. Edward T. Barnes owned the house for a decade starting in 1922 and Herman D. Carus lived there from 1945 to 1969. In 1970, the house became a meeting place for the Illinois Valley Community Arts Center. At times, the LaSalle County Youth Bureau and a local [[YMCA]] chapter also used the building. In 1984, Fred and Cynthia Carus took ownership of the house and it remained unused for twenty years. The Hegeler Carus Foundation, a non-profit organization that oversees the mansion across the street, purchased the house.<ref name=nrhp/>
