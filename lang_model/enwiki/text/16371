'''Maki''' (<U+5DFB><U+753A>; -machi) was a [[town]] located in the [[Nishikanbara District, Niigata]], [[Japan]].

''Maki'' literally means "meadow", although the name of this town is written as "scroll" by a homonym to distinguish from another [[Maki, Niigata (Kubiki)|Maki]] in the same prefecture. The town had no special relationship with the other town.

The population of Maki, as of April 2005, was 29,039.

The town was established as a village in 1889 by merging Shimo-maki Village and others, then promoted to a town in 1891.

In January 2006, Maki was absorbed into [[Niigata City]]. Starting April 1, 2007, the area is part of the Nishi-ku and Nishikan-ku wards.
