'''Interstate 84''' ('''I-84''') is a {{convert|119.77|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[Interstate Highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Utah]]. The highway enters [[Box Elder County, Utah|Box Elder County]] near [[Snowville, Utah|Snowville]] before becoming [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]] in [[Tremonton, Utah|Tremonton]] before traveling south through [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]] and [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]]. The highways separate near the [[Ogden-Hinckley Airport]] where the highway turns southeast along the [[Davis County, Utah|Davis County]] border before entering [[Weber Canyon]] and [[Morgan County, Utah|Morgan County]]. While in Morgan County, I-84 passes the [[Devil's Gate-Weber Hydroelectric Power Plant]] and [[Devil's Slide (Utah)|Devil's Slide]] rock formation. Past [[Morgan, Utah|Morgan]], the highway crosses into [[Summit County, Utah|Summit County]], past the [[Thousand Mile Tree]] before reaching its eastern terminus at [[Interstate 80 in Utah|I-80]] near [[Echo, Utah|Echo]].

Construction of the [[controlled-access highway]] was scheduled in late 1957 under the designations '''Interstate 82S''' and '''Interstate 80N'''. The I-82S designation was only applied on paper for about a year, but the I-80N designation was the highway's official designation until 1977 when it was renumbered I-84 by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]]. By 1978, construction of the freeway had been completed across Utah, as well as Oregon and most of Idaho. I-84 is unusual as there are two [[wikt:noncontiguous|noncontiguous]] segments: Oregon, Idaho, and Utah as well as Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. [[Annual average daily traffic|Average traffic]] in 2012, along the non-concurrent parts of I-84, ranged from as few as 6,655&nbsp;vehicles traveling along I-84 at the interchange with [[Utah State Route 86|SR-86]] in [[Henefer, Utah|Henefer]], and as many as 18,945&nbsp;vehicles used the highway at the [[Utah State Route 26|SR-26]] interchange in [[Riverdale, Utah|Riverdale]].

==Route description==
Out of the three states that the western portion of I-84 passes through, the {{convert|119.77|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} segment in Utah is the shortest. By comparison, the longest stretch of western I-84 through a single state is the {{convert|375.17|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} segment in [[Oregon]]. I-84 also has a [[wikt:noncontiguous|noncontiguous]] [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania<U+2013>Massachusetts)|eastern segment]] that passes through Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts: all four of these segments are shorter than the Utah segment.<ref name="fhwa">{{cite web|last=Adderly|first=Kevin|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/table1.cfm|title=Table 1: Main Routes of the Dwight D.

Every year, the [[Utah Department of Transportation]] (UDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, UDOT calculated that as few as 6,655&nbsp;vehicles traveled I-84 at the interchange with [[Utah State Route 86|SR-86]] in [[Henefer, Utah|Henefer]], and as many as 18,945&nbsp;vehicles used the highway at the [[Utah State Route 26|SR-26]] interchange in [[Riverdale, Utah|Riverdale]].<ref name="aadt">{{cite report|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=7502314351643878|title=Traffic on Utah Highways|page=16|date=2012|accessdate=December 27, 2013|publisher=[[Utah Department of Transportation]]|format=PDF|last=Staff}}</ref> Between 27 and 57&nbsp;percent of the traffic recorded consisted of trucks.<ref name="aadt truck">{{cite report|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=11139106792388678|title=Truck Traffic on Utah Highways|pages=15|date=2012|accessdate=December 25, 2013|publisher=Utah Department of Transportation|format=PDF|last=Staff}}</ref> These counts are of the portion of the freeway in Utah and are not reflective of the entire Interstate, or of its [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with I-15.

===Western segment===
Crossing the Idaho-Utah state line, I-84 enters [[Box Elder County, Utah|Box Elder County]] and the [[Curlew Valley]] near farmland that utilizes [[center pivot irrigation]] before intersecting [[Utah State Route 30|SR-30]] at a [[diamond interchange]].<ref name="gmaps">{{google maps|url=https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d825030!2d-112.3919444!3d41.4773975!2m1!1e3!4m29!3m20!1m5!1sInterstate+84%2C+Malad+City%2C+UT+83252!2s0x80ab2642f4ddddfd%3A0xbe52f05313361e6!3m2!3d42.0093271!4d-112.8434984!1m4!3m2!3d40.9711504!4d-111.4422272!6e2!3m8!1m3!1d3248!2d-111.4416157!3d40.9701419!3m2!1i1278!2i828!4f13.1!5m2!13m1!1e1!7m4!11m3!1m1!1e1!2b1&fid=0i7|title=Interstate 84 Overview|accessdate=December 27, 2013}}</ref> The town of [[Snowville, Utah|Snowville]] is crossed before passing to the north of the [[Hansel Mountains]] and the [[North Promontory Mountains]].

===Concurrency with I-15===
[[File:Westbound I-84 approaching 31st St.jpg|thumb|right|Northbound along I-15/84 in Ogden]]
Concurrent highways I-15/84 continue south, parallel to rail belonging to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] (UP) past the [[Wellsville Mountain Wilderness]], to an interchange at 1100&nbsp;West in [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]], also known as [[U.S. Route 91 in Utah|US-91]], which once in Brigham City becomes concurrent with US-89 and the two highways travel northwest from Brigham City into [[Box Elder Canyon]] towards [[Logan, Utah|Logan]] in the heart of the [[Cache Valley]]. US-89 closely parallels I-15/84 east,as the highways pass [[Willard Bay]], the [[Willard Bay State Park]] and [[Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge]] before crossing into [[Weber County, Utah|Weber County]].<ref name="gmaps" /><ref name="boxelder6" />

Upon entering Weber County the rail line that the highway has paralleled since Tremonton splits off eastwards near [[Defense Depot Ogden]], as the concurrent highways continue south past [[Farr West, Utah|Farr West]] and [[Slaterville, Utah|Slaterville]] before a [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] rail line, which traverses the [[Great Salt Lake]] on a [[causeway]], crosses under the freeway. The city of [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] is bypassed by the Interstates, with [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|US-89]] serving downtown. US-89 is accessible via interchanges with [[Utah State Route 39|SR-39]], [[Utah State Route 79|SR-79]] and [[Utah State Route 104|SR-104]] in addition to I-84 further southeast. I-84 splits from I-15 at the south end of the [[Ogden-Hinckley Airport]], with I-15 continuing south towards [[Salt Lake City]] and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]].<ref name="gmaps" /><ref name="weber1">{{cite map|publisher=Utah Department of Transportation|title=Weber County|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=200402051619362|accessdate=December 27, 2013|year=2005|series=General Highway Map|page=1|scale=1:22440}}</ref>

[[File:Thousand Mile Tree 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Thousand Mile Tree]]]]
Splitting from I-15 near [[Roy, Utah|Roy]], I-84 passes between [[Hill Air Force Base]], which is to the south of the highway, and [[Washington Terrace, Utah|Washington Terrace]] before clipping the extreme northern portions of [[Davis County, Utah|Davis County]].<ref name="weber1" /> While in Davis County, I-84 intersects 475&nbsp;East, also known as the [[Adams Avenue Parkway]],<ref name="gmaps" /> before coming to a hybrid [[partial cloverleaf]]/[[half-diamond interchange]] with US-89 along the Davis-Weber county line.<ref name="weber1" /><ref name="davis">{{cite map|publisher=Utah Department of Transportation|title=Davis County|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=200402051613442|accessdate=December 27, 2013|year=2005|series=General Highway Map|scale=1:22440}}</ref>

I-84 follows the [[Weber River]] into [[Weber Canyon]], [[Morgan County, Utah|Morgan County]], and the [[Wasatch-Cache National Forest]]. Once in the canyon, the carriageways of the highway split to accommodate the [[Devil's Gate-Weber Hydroelectric Power Plant]].
