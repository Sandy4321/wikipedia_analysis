'''''Eryngium foetidum''''' (also known as '''Bhandhanya''', '''Chardon benit''', '''Culantro''', '''Donnia''', '''Culantro Coyote''', ('''Fitweed''', '''Long coriander''', '''Mexican coriander''', '''Wild coriander''', '''Recao''', '''Shado beni''' (English-speaking Caribbean), '''Spiritweed''', '''Ng<U+00F2> gai''' (Vietnam), '''Sawtooth''', '''Saw-leaf herb''', or '''Cilantro cimarron''') is a tropical perennial and annual [[herb]] in the family [[Apiaceae]]. It is native to [[Mexico]] and [[South America]], but is cultivated worldwide.  In the [[United States]], where it is not well-known, the name culantro sometimes causes confusion with ''[[Coriander|Coriandrum sativum]]'', the leaves of which are known as cilantro, and which culantro is even said to taste like.<ref>[http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1999/v4-506.html Ramcharan, C. 1999.

''E. foetidum'' is widely used in seasoning and [[marinade|marinating]] in the [[Caribbean]]. It is also used extensively in [[Thailand]], [[India]], [[Vietnam]], and other parts of [[Asia]] as a culinary herb. This variety of coriander dries well, retaining good color and flavor, making it valuable in the dried [[herb]] industry. It is sometimes used as a substitute for [[cilantro]], but has a much stronger taste. Like  cilantro, many people find the leaves distasteful, due to a genetic trait.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} As the species name means "fetid" in Latin, it is possible that Linnaeus also had noted this trait.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Medicinally, the [[Leaf|leaves]] and roots are used in tea to stimulate appetite, improve [[digestion]], combat colic, soothe stomach pains, eliminate gases and as an [[aphrodisiac]].
