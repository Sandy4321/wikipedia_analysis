'''SEARCA''' (acronym for Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture) is one of the 19 centers of excellence of the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO). Established in 1966, SEARCA was hosted in the University of the Philippines Los Ba<U+00F1>os, which was the leading agricultural institution in Southeast Asia during that milieu.

SEARCA was established in 1966 to: (a) provide nationals of SEAMEO member-countries with high quality graduate education and training in agriculture and rural development, (b) promote, undertake and coordinate research programs related to the needs and problems of the Southeast Asian region, and (c) disseminate findings of agricultural research and experimentation to a variety of stakeholders.

SEARCA's core programs include: (1) graduate education, (2) research and development, and (3) knowledge management.

==History==
===November 1965===

The education ministers of [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], and [[Vietnam]], together with a representative from the [[United States]] [[Government]], met to explore possible venues for regional cooperation in [[education]], [[science]], and [[culture]].

The historic meeting paved the way to the formation of an interim Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Secretariat (SEAMES) for the purpose of drawing up a <U+201C>Discussion Paper<U+201D> which detailed suggested priority projects for the region. The favorable responses and comments on the paper enabled SEAMES to prepare skeletal draft proposals for regional cooperation in education, of which the idea of instituting a Center for [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] study and [[research]] in [[agriculture]] was third in the list.

Having established an impressive reputation in the field of agricultural education, the then University of the Philippines College of Agriculture (UPCA) was seriously considered to be the ideal site. Dr. [[Dioscoro L. Umali]], then Dean of [[UPCA]], wasted no time as he immediately called a select few of his colleagues to draft a position paper which advocated utilizing the resources of existing institutions for the project, instead of starting a new institution from scratch.

===July 1966===

The [[Philippine]] delegation submitted the position paper to the SEAMES Technical Workshop held in [[Kuala_Lumpur|Kuala, Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. A Task Force was then formed to thoroughly evaluate the advisability of establishing an [[institute]] for graduate study and [[research]] in [[agriculture]] and the probable [[institution]] that could be home to such. In addition, the [[Task Force]] was tasked to recommend a framework for the operation of the proposed institute.

End result, the Task Force recommended [[UPCA]] to be the womb that gave birth to this institute of higher learning in [[agriculture]].

===November 1966===

The Second Conference of the SEAMES held in [[Manila]] and [[Quezon City]] witnessed how the [[Philippine]] delegation stood steadfast in reworking on the report to propose and develop a plan for the merging of the proposed institute to the UPCA system.

With encouraging words from the then [[Education]] Secretary [[Carlos P. Romulo]], Drs. G. F. Saguiguit, [[Dioscoro L. Umali]], and Mr. Onofre D. Corpuz reworked the proposal. Their efforts paid off as the proposal was finally approved on November 30, 1966 and the institute was officially named the <U+201C>Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture<U+201D> (SEARCA).
