'''Kansas City''' is a [[city]] covering parts of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]], [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay]], [[Cass County, Missouri|Cass]], and [[Platte County, Missouri|Platte]] [[county|counties]] in [[Missouri]], [[United States|USA]]. Situated at the junction of the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Kansas River|Kansas]] [[river]]s, it lies along the boundary between Missouri and Kansas, and is directly opposite of [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]], [[Kansas]]. Kansas City is the largest city in all four of its counties, though it is county seat to none of them. It is the most heavily populated city in Missouri, the 7th [[List of Midwestern cities by size|largest city]] in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the 40th [[List of United States cities by population|most populous city]] in the United States. As of 2005, the city had an estimated population of 444,965.<ref>{{cite web | title=Census Bureau Estimates Program (2005) | url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/files/SUB-EST2005-all.csv | accessdate = 2006-09-11 }}</ref> Combined with Kansas City, Kansas, the population is 591,831 but the entire [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|metropolitan area]] is approximately 1,947,694.<ref>{{cite web | title=Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April&nbsp;1, 2000 to July&nbsp;1, 2005 (CBSA-EST2005-01) | url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metropop/2005/cbsa-01-fmt.csv | accessdate = 2006-09-11 }}</ref> Kansas City is the center of the 27th largest [[List of United States metropolitan areas|metropolitan statistical area]] in the United States.

The Town of Kansas, later to become Kansas City, was established in 1850. The name derived from a trading post in the area that had been dubbed "the village of the Kansa," a reference to the local [[Kaw (tribe)|Kaw (or Kanza)]] tribe. Kansas City is often abbreviated as "KC" (to refer to the entire [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|metropolitan area]]), or "KCMO" (to refer to only Kansas City, Missouri). Kansas City is nicknamed the ''City of Fountains''  because it ranks second in the world in number of [[fountains]] (over 200), exceeded only by [[Rome]]. <ref>{{cite web | title=<U+2018>City of Fountains<U+2019> Indeed | url=http://www.visitkc.com/media_room/news_releases/index.cfm?page=fountain_release.htm | accessdate = 2006-09-10 }}</ref> It is also nicknamed the ''Heart of America'' because it is within 250 miles of both the [[Geographic centers of the United States|geographic]] and [[Mean center of U.S. population|population]] centers of the nation. Kansas City is referred to informally as ''[[Cowtown]]'' and the ''[[BBQ]] Capital of the World''. People from Kansas City are known as ''Kansas Citians''.

The [[GaWC|Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network]] recently designated Kansas City as having potential of attaining world city status.<ref>{{cite web | first=Peter J. | last=Taylor | coauthors=Robert E.

== History ==
[[Image:Kc-pioneers1.jpg|thumb|right|Kansas City Pioneer Square monument in Westport features [[Pony Express]] founder [[Alexander Majors]], Westport/Kansas City founder [[John Calvin McCoy]] and Mountainman [[Jim Bridger]] who owned Chouteau's Store next to Kelly's]]
{{main|History of Kansas City}}

===Exploration and settlement===
The French explorers [[Louis Joliet]] and [[Jacques Marquette]] were the first Europeans to spot the area that came to be known as Kansas City, doing so via a six-day canoe trip up the [[Missouri River]] in 1673.  The French first settled in the lower [[Missouri Valley]] at [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] in 1765 and later at the confluence of the Missouri and Kansas rivers, [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Chouteau]] established Chouteau Landing in 1821.

[[Image:Scout_skyline.JPG|thumbnail|left|Kansas City Scout Statue]]
In 1833 [[John Calvin McCoy|John McCoy]] established [[Westport, Kansas City|West Port]] along the [[Santa Fe Trail]], three miles away from the river. Then in 1834, McCoy established [[Westport, Kansas City|Westport Landing]] on a bend in the Missouri River to serve as a landing point for West Port. Soon after, [[Kansas Town Company]], a group of investors, began to settle the area. In 1850 the landing area incorporated as the Town of Kansas.<ref>{{cite web | title=Why is Kansas City located in Missouri instead of Kansas? | url=http://www.kclibrary.org/guides/localhistory/index.cfm?article=read&articleID=400 | accessdate = 2006-09-11 }}</ref>

By that time, the Town of Kansas and Westport, along with nearby [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]] were critical points in [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|westward expansion]].  Three major [[Historical roads and trails of the United States|trail]]s, [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[California Trail|California]], and [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], all started at [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]].

On [[March 18]], [[1853]] the City of Kansas was created with a newly elected mayor. It had an area 0.98 square miles and a population of 2,500. The boundary lines at that time extended from the middle of the Missouri river south to what is now Ninth street, and from Bluff street on the west to a point between Holmes and Charlotte streets on the east.<ref>{{cite web | title=Early City Limits | url=http://images.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=95980 | accessdate = 2006-09-11 }}</ref>

===Civil War===
The area was ripe with animosity as the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] approached.  As a [[slave state]], Missourians tended to sympathize with the southern states.  With Kansas petitioning to enter the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] under the new doctrine of [[popular sovereignty]], many from the area crossed into Kansas to sway the state towards allowing [[slavery]], at first by ballot box and then by bloodshed.

[[Image:Kansas city mo 1869.gif|thumbnail|left|Bird's eye view of Kansas City, Missouri. Jan. 1869. Drawn by A. Ruger, Merchants Lith. Co.]]
During the Civil War, the City of Kansas was in the midst of battles, almost all of them victories by the Union.  The [[First Battle of Independence|Battle of Independence]] in August of 1862 stunted a [[Confederate]] advance into northern Missouri (settled by pro-slavery [[Virginian]]s), and the October 1864 [[Battle of Westport]] effectively ended Confederate efforts to occupy the city.  However, a successful raid on [[Lawrence, Kansas]] led by [[William Quantrill]] forced General [[Thomas Ewing, Jr.|Thomas Ewing]] to issue [[General Order No. 11 (1863)|General Order No. 11]], forcing the eviction of residents in four counties, including Jackson, except those living in the city and nearby communities, or those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing.
[[Image:Walnut-street-kcmo-1906.jpg|thumbnail|right|Walnut St., Downtown Kansas City, Mo. 1906]]

===Post-Civil War===
After the Civil War, the City of Kansas grew rapidly.  The selection of the city over [[Leavenworth, Kansas]] for the [[Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad]] bridge over the Missouri River brought about significant growth.  The population exploded after 1869, when the Hannibal Bridge, designed by [[Octave Chanute]], opened.  The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889 and the city limits to extend south and east.  Westport became part of Kansas City on [[December 2]], [[1897]].

Kansas City, guided by architect [[George Kessler]], became a forefront example of the [[City Beautiful]] movement, developing a network of boulevards and parks around the city.  The relocation of [[Union Station (Kansas City)|Union Station]] to its current location in 1914 and the opening of the [[Liberty Memorial]] in 1923 capped this movement.  Further capping Kansas City's growth was the opening of the innovative [[Country Club Plaza]] development by [[Jesse Clyde Nichols|J.C. Nichols]] in 1925.

===Pendergast era===
At the [[turn of the century]], political machines attempted to gain clout in the city, with the one led by [[Tom Pendergast]] emerging as the dominant machine by 1925.  A new city charter passed that year made it easier for his Democratic Party machine to gain control of the city council (slimmed from 32 members to nine) and appoint a crooked city manager.  The machine fell in 1939 when Pendergast, riddled with health problems, pleaded guilty to [[tax evasion]].  The machine, however, gave rise to [[Harry S. Truman]], who quickly became Kansas City's favorite son.

===Post-WWII sprawl===
After [[World War II]], the city experienced considerable sprawl, as the affluent populace bolted for [[suburb]]s like [[Johnson County, Kansas]] and eastern Jackson County.  However, many also went north of the Missouri River, where Kansas City had incorporated areas during the 1920s and in 1963.  This annexation would pay off for the city in the 1970s, when a population and developmental boom occurred in both Platte and Clay counties, bringing more buisinesses to the Northland and making many of the landowners in the area millionares.  The population of the city proper dipped, but over the past 15 years has rebounded to nearly 450,000.  Not only has growth in annexed areas (as far north as [[Smithville, Missouri|Smithville]] and south as [[Cass County, Missouri|Cass County]]) contributed to the growth, but also successful efforts to revitalize the downtown area.  Such growth and ability to annex surrounding areas has allowed Kansas City to surpass St. Louis as the largest single [[municipality]] in the state of Missouri.

===Kansas Citians===
Kansas City has served as a launching pad for several storied careers.  [[Ernest Hemingway]] wrote for the [[Kansas City Star]] during [[World War I]].  [[Walt Disney]] moved to Kansas City and established his first animation studio, [[Laugh-O-Gram Studio]], at 31st and Locust in 1923.  Early screen actors [[Jean Harlow]], [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Craig Stevens (actor)|Craig Stevens]], writer [[Robert A. Heinlein|Robert Heinlein]] and director [[Robert Altman]] all grew up in Kansas City.

==Geography==
[[Image:kcskyline_1.jpg|thumb|Downtown Kansas City, [[Union Station]] is featured in front]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 318.0 [[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]] (823.7 [[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]]).  313.5 mi<U+00B2> (812.1 km<U+00B2>) of it is land and 4.5 mi<U+00B2> (11.6 km<U+00B2>) of it (1.41%) is water.

Kansas City is often imagined by outsiders to be flat like Chicago, Dallas or New York, but in fact it has many rolling hills.  Kansas City proper is bowl-shaped and is surrounded to the north and south by [[limestone]] and [[bedrock]] cliffs that were carved by [[glacier]]s. Kansas City is situated at the junction between the [[Dakota ice lobe|Dakota]] and [[Minnesota ice lobes]] during the maximum late [[Independence glaciation]] of the [[Pleistocene]] [[epoch]]. The Kansas and Missouri rivers cut wide valleys into the terrain when the glaciers melted and drained. A partially filled spillway valley crosses the central portion of Kansas City, Missouri. This valley is an eastward continuation of Turkey Creek valley. The [[Union Station (Kansas City)|Union Station]] is located in this valley. <ref>{{cite web | first=James S. | last=Aber | title=Glacial Geology of the Kansas City Vicinity | url=http://www.geospectra.net/lewis_cl/geology/glacial.htm | accessdate = 2006-09-05 }}</ref>

Kansas City, Missouri, is organized into a system of approximately 150 [[List of Registered Neighborhoods in Kansas City, Missouri|registered neighborhoods]].

===Climate===
Kansas City lies almost in the exact center of the United States, at the confluence of the second largest river in the country, the Missouri River, and the Kansas River (also known as the Kaw River).  This makes for a [[continental climate]] with moderate precipitation and extremes of hot and cold.  Summers can be very humid, with moist air riding up from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and July/August daytime highs reaching into the triple digits.  Winters vary from mild days to bitterly cold, with lows reaching into the teens below zero a few times a year.  Spring and Fall are pleasant, and peppered with thunderstorms.

===Weather===
Kansas City is part of [[Tornado alley]], as cold air from the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Canada]] mix with warm air from the Gulf. Kansas City has had many severe outbreaks of [[tornado]]s, including the [[Kansas City Tornado Outbreak of May 1957]], or Ruskin Heights tornado <ref>[http://www.wdaftv4.com/almanac/watorndo.html Kansas City Tornado Almanac], wdaftv4.com. Accessed Sept. 2006.</ref>, and the [[May 2003 Tornado Outbreak Sequence]]. Also due to its location between the air from the Gulf and the air from Canada, Kansas City is prone to [[Winter storm#Freezing rain and ice storms|ice storm]]s, such as the 2002 ice storm during which hundreds of thousands lost power for days and, in some cases, weeks.<ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/special_packages/star_history/calamities_crime/12508862.htm KC powerless as icy barrage pummels the area, leaves behind disaster zone], Accessed [[10 September]] [[2006]].</ref> Kansas City and its outlying areas are also prone to flooding. Kansas City was flooded during both the [[Great Flood of 1993]] and the [[Great Flood of 1951]].

===Parks and parkways===
[[Image:Kc-country-club-plaza.jpg|thumb|J.C. Nichols Memorial Fountain in Country Club Plaza]]
Kansas City is well-known for its spacious parkways and numerous parks.  The parkway system winds its way through the city with broad, landscaped medians that include statuary and fountains.  One of the best examples is [[Ward Parkway]] on the west side of the city, near the [[Kansas]] [[State Line Road|state line]].

[[Swope Park]] is one of the nation's larger in-city parks, comprising 1,763 acres (2.75 [[miles|mi]]<U+00B2>)[http://www.kcmo.org/timeline.nsf/web/18960000?opendocument].  It includes a full-fledged [[zoo]], two golf courses, a lake, an [[amphitheatre]], day-camp area, and numerous picnic grounds.

Kansas City has always had one of the nation's best urban forestry programs.  At one time, almost all residential streets were planted with a solid canopy of [[American elm]]s but [[Dutch elm disease]] devastated them.  Most of the elms died and were replaced with a variety of other shade trees. A program is underway currently to replace many of the fast-growing [[American Sweetgum|sweetgum]] trees with [[hardwood]] varieties.

===Downtown redevelopment===
[[Image:Alphamap.gif||thumb|right|The city's tallest buildings and characteristic skyline is roughly contained inside the [[downtown freeway loop (Kansas City)|downtown freeway loop]] (shaded in red).  Downtown Kansas City itself is generally considered to stretch from the Missouri River south to 31st street, beyond the bottom of the map.]] {{main|Downtown Kansas City}}

Downtown Kansas City is an area of 2.9 square miles bounded by the Missouri River to the north, 31st Street to the south, Bruce R. Watkins Drive ([[U.S. Highway 71]]) to the east and I-35 to the west.

After years of neglect and seas of parking lots, [[downtown Kansas City]] is currently undergoing a period of change.  Many residential properties have recently been or are currently under redevelopment. A planned entertainment district, titled the "Power and Light District" is being developed in the southern part of the [[downtown freeway loop (Kansas City)|downtown freeway loop]] by the Cordish Company of [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; adjacent to the entertainment district will be a new arena, named the [[Sprint Center]], set to open in 2007.  The arena is to be designed by a consortium of local architects, and hopes to lure an [[NBA]] or [[NHL]] franchise to the city.  [[Los Angeles]]-based [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] has invested in the arena project and will run its daily operations.

In 2003 the Downtown population reached 15,100 people, up from around 13,000 in 2000, aided in part by real estate conversion of vacant commercial buildings into loft-style housing.

The United States Census bureau updated their American Community Survey information in 2005 for Kansas City. Their study estimated a population of about 440,885 people, the margin of error was placed at +/- 9,193 people. Growth in Kansas City is increasing, with 3,618 housing permits granted in 2004 and 2005.  As of 2005, about 210,000 households exist.

==Economy==
[[Image:Kc-hr-block.jpg|thumb|left|[[H&R Block]]'s new oblong headquarters in downtown Kansas City]]
{{main|Kansas City Economy}}

Kansas City is headquarters to one [[Fortune 500]] company (H&R Block) and five additional ''[[Fortune 1000]]'' corporations.  [[Hallmark Cards]] probably would qualify but is not included because it is privately owned.  Numerous agriculture companies operate out of the city and the [[Kansas City Board of Trade]] is the principal trading center for hard red winter wheat -- the principal ingredient of bread.

The business community is serviced by two major business magazines, one weekly and one monthly, as well as numerous other smaller publications, including a local society journal.

==Law and government==
The current [[mayor]] of Kansas City, Missouri is [[Kay Waldo Barnes|Kay Barnes]], the city's first female mayor.  Elected in March 1999 and again in March 2003, her second of two terms will expire in April 2007. The city has a [[city manager]] form of government, however the role of city manager has diminished over the years following excesses during the heyday of Tom Pendergast.

From the late 19th Century to the mid 20th Century, Kansas City was controlled by often corrupt Democrat controlled [[political machine]]s.  [[Tom Pendergast]] was the most infamous leader of the machine.  The most prominent Democrat to rise out of Pendergast's machine was [[Harry S. Truman]], who became a Senator, [[Vice President of the United States]] and then [[President of the United States]] from 1945-1953.  

Kansas City has hosted the [[1900 Democratic National Convention]], the [[1928 Republican National Convention]], which nominated [[Herbert Hoover]] from [[Iowa]] for President, and the memorable [[1976 Republican National Convention]], which nominated Kansas U.S. Senator [[Bob Dole]] for Vice President. 

Kansas City consistently votes Democractic in Presidential elections, however on the state and local level Republicans often find some modest success. Missouri was a [[Red state vs. blue state divide|Blue state]] in the 1996 Presidential election and [[Red state vs. blue state divide|Red state]] in the 2000 and 2004 Presidential elections. <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/MO/P/00/ Election Results], cnn.com/election. Accessed Sept. 2006.</ref> Since Kansas City borders on the state of [[Kansas]] which consistently votes Republican, and since the suburbs of Kansas City typically vote Republican, the city is sometimes associated with Republicans.

== Transportation ==
''Main article: [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area#Transportation|Kansas City Metropolitan Area]]''

Kansas City owes its existence as a major city to its crossroads status.

First, it was at the confluence of the Missouri River and Kansas River and the launching pointing for travelers on the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], and [[California Trail|California]] trails.  Then with the construction of the [[Hannibal Bridge]] across the [[Missouri River]] it became the central location for 11 trunk railroads.  More rail traffic in terms of tonnage still passes through the city than any other city in the country.  [[TWA]] located its headquartes in the city and had ambitious plans to turn the city into an air hub for the world.

Missouri and Kansas were the first states to start building interstates with [[Interstate 70]].  An ever increasing number of interstate loops has encouraged suburban sprawl.

=== Airports ===
[[Image:Kci.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Kansas City International Airport]]]]
Kansas City International Airport was built to the specifications of TWA to make a world hub for the [[supersonic transport]] and [[Boeing 747]].  Its passenger friendly design in which its gates were 100 feet from the street has, since [[September 11]], required a costly overhaul to retrofit it to incorporate a more conventional spoke and hub security system.

[[Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport]] was the original headquarters of [[Trans World Airlines]] and houses the [[Airline History Museum]]. It is still used for [[general aviation]] and airshows.

===Mass transit===
In the first half of the 20th century, Kansas City's mass transit system was "light rail" with its [[interurban]] running from Kansas City more than 50 miles in all directions between 1900 and 1939.  In addition, Kansas City had an electric [[trolley]] network that ran through the city until 1959.  

*The MAX: In July 2005, the [[Kansas City Area Transportation Authority]] started a new bus system called, "The MAX" (Metro Area Express).  The bus route starts in the City Market in Downtown Kansas City, and has many stops along Main Street, The [[Country Club Plaza|Plaza]] and southern Kansas City.  At the time of their introduction, MAX buses were to be able to prolong green traffic lights to stay on schedule, but as of September, 2006, this technology has not been put into effect.

*Buses run 7 days a week from 5:00am to 1:00am.  During rush hour periods, the buses make stops every 10 minutes.  All other times, the buses make stops every 15-30 minutes.  Each bus ride costs $1.25. Kansas City also has the METRO bus station which runs through the whole Kansas City Area.  Between [[June 1]] and [[September 20]], the fare is reduced to $0.25 on days for which the amount of ground level ozone is predicted to be high. 

*Kansas City does not have a subway or [[light rail]] system as seen in cities such as New York, Chicago, and St. Louis.  A measure proposing a light rail system has been placed on the ballot for the [[November 7]], 2006 election.[http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/15355035.htm]

==Culture==
===Architecture===
[[Image:RW_KC_IMG_0702.JPG|thumbnail|right|[[Municipal Auditorium]] and [[Bartle Hall Convention Center]]
, Kansas City]]
{{main|Architecture in Kansas City}}

Kansas City has long been praised for its varied architecture, which includes many famous and interesting buildings.  Its skyline is notable for various structures, including the immense [[Bartle Hall Convention Center]], the adjoined [[art deco]] [[Municipal Auditorium]], and numerous skyscrapers such as the Kansas City Power and Light Building and [[One Kansas City Place]] (the tallest habitable structure in Missouri), as well as the [[KCTV-Tower]] (the tallest freestanding structure in Missouri and 39th [[List of towers|tallest tower]] in the world), and the [[Liberty Memorial]] (the national [[World War I]] memorial and museum of the United States).

===City of Fountains===
''Main article: [[List of Fountains in Kansas City]]''

With more than 200 fountains, Kansas City claims that only Rome has more fountains.  While the claim might fall by the wayside if big cities were as conscientious about cataloging their fountains, the claim in Kansas City is part of the culture and identity of the city.  The fountain is a logo for the city. 
===Kansas City cuisine===
[[Image:Bull-kemper.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[American Hereford Association]] bull and [[Kemper Arena]] and the [[Kansas City Live Stock Exchange]] Building in the former [[Kansas City Stockyard]] of the [[West Bottoms]] as seen from [[Quality Hill]]]]
Kansas City is most famous for its [[steak]] and [[barbecue]].

====Kansas City steaks====
During the heyday of the [[Kansas City Stockyards]], the city was known for its Kansas City steaks or [[Strip steak|Kansas City strip steaks]].  The most famous of the steakhouses is the Golden Ox in the [[Kansas City Live Stock Exchange]] in the stockyards in the [[West Bottoms]].  The stockyards, which were second only to those of Chicago in size, never recovered from the [[Great Flood of 1951]] and eventually closed.  The famed Kansas City Strip cut of steak is actually identical to the New York Strip cut, and is sometimes referred to just as a [[strip steak]].

====Kansas City-style barbecue====
''Main article: [[Kansas City-style barbecue]]''

Along with Texas, Memphis & North Carolina, Kansas City calls itself a "world capital of barbecue."  There are more than 90 barbecue restaurants[http://www.experiencekc.com/barbeque.html] in the metropolitan area and the [[American Royal]] each fall claims to host the world's biggest barbecue contest.

The classic Kansas City-style barbecue was an [[inner city]] phenomenon that evolved from the pit of [[Henry Perry]] from the [[Memphis, Tennessee]] area in the early 1900s and blossomed in the [[18th and Vine Historic District|18th and Vine]] neighborhood.  [[Arthur Bryant's]] was to take over the Perry restaurant and added [[molasses]] to sweeten the recipe.  In 1946 [[Gates and Sons Bar-B-Q]] was opened by one of Perry's cooks.  The Gates recipe added even more molasses.  Although Bryant's and Gates are the two definitive Kansas City barbecue restaurants they have had little or no luck exporting the barbecue beyond the Kansas City metropolitan area.

In 1977 [[Rich Davis]], a white child psychologist doctor, test marketed his own concoction called K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce.  He renamed it [[KC Masterpiece]] and in 1986 he sold the sauce to the Kingsford division of [[Clorox]].  Davis retained rights to operate restaurants using the name and sauce, with a restaurant in the suburb of Overland Park, KS.

===Kansas City Jazz===
[[Image:Charlie-parker1.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to [[Charlie Parker]] at the [[American Jazz Museum]] at 18th and Highland in Kansas City]]
''Main article: [[Kansas City Jazz]]''

Kansas City Jazz in the 1930's marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s.  In the 1930s Big City Boss [[Tom Pendergast]] was at his zenith of his power and left Kansas City a wide open town in which night clubs were allowed to remain open from dusk to dawn.  In this venue an era of [[musical improvisation]] developed in which it was not uncommon for a single "song" to be performed all night by competing performers who passed through the city.  The era ended in 1936 when producer [[John H. Hammond]] began signing Kansas City talent and transferring the acts to [[New York City]].  

The era of Kansas City influence is bracketed by the signing of [[Count Basie]] in 1929 to the advent of Kansas City native [[Charlie Parker]] in the 1940s.  Pendergast pleaded guilty to income tax evasion in 1939 and the city soon began a crackdown of the clubs.

In the 1970s Kansas City attempted to resurrect the glory of the jazz era in a sanitized family friendly atmosphere.  In the 1970s an effort to open jazz clubs in the River Quay area of City Market along the Missouri ended in a gangland war in which three of the new clubs were blown up in what ultimately resulted in the removal of Kansas City mob influence in the Las Vegas casinos that was partially depicted in the movie [[Casino (movie)]].  

In 1981, 114 people died in the [[Hyatt Regency walkway collapse]] at a [[tea dance]] that was attempting to recreate the jazz era.  In 1999 the [[American Jazz Museum]] opened in the 18th and Vine neighborhood.

==Media==

''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' is the area's primary newspaper.  [[William Rockhill Nelson]] first published the evening paper on [[September 1]], [[1880]].  The ''Star'' competed heavily with the morning''Times'' before acquiring it in 1926 and discontinuing it in March 1990.

Monthly newspapers such as ''The Kansas City Metro Voice'' and several weekly papers, including the ''[[Kansas City Business Journal,]]'' ''[[The Pitch (newspaper)|The Pitch]]'', the bilingual paper "Dos Mundos" and various suburban papers also serve the Kansas City area.
