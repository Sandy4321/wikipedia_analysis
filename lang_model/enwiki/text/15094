'''Pounamu''' (New Zealand greenstone) is a highly prized hard nephrite [[jade]] found in [[New Zealand]] and parts of [[Australia]]. It is composed of [[Chlorite group|chlorite]] and [[epidote]] which makes the stone a mid-to-dark green colour.

Greenstone rocks are generally found in rivers. They appear as nondescript boulders and stones and are difficult to identify without cutting them open. The [[mining]] of pounamu is closely controlled.

The [[M<U+0101>ori]] call the [[South Island]] of New Zealand ''Te Wai Pounamu'', meaning "The [land of] Greenstone Water". Pounamu is highly valued by the M<U+0101>ori and it plays an important role in [[Culture of the Maori|their culture]]. It is considered a ''[[taonga]]'' or treasure, and so is protected under the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].

Pounamu is a very hard stone and must be worked with care and patience. Today, [[diamond tools]] are often used to carve it, and it can be turned into beautiful [[jewellery]] such as [[Hei-tiki]]. Much of this is in traditional M<U+0101>ori designs. Pounamu jewelery is now very popular among New Zealanders and is seen as somewhat iconic of the country. Such jewelery is often used as gifts to visitors. [[Viggo Mortensen]] of [[The Lord of the Rings]] fame, took to wearing a ''hei matau'' around his neck. [[Michael Hurst]] of the television program [[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|Hercules]] was gifted a large and heavy pounamu pendant necklace which he wore on the program. During a particularly energetic action scene the pendant hit his teeth. The producers felt the ornament suited the nature of the program yet a safety risk and so had it replaced with a latex replica.

Because pounamu is so hard it has been used as an alternative to iron in axes and similar hand tools. The M<U+0101>ori club, the ''[[Mere (weapon)|mere]]'', was often made of pounamu. Pounamu artefacts were often given as gifts to seal important agreements.
