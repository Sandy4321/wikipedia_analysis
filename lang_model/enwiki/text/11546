Following his film debut in 1981's ''[[Taps (film)|Taps]]'' and a diverse range of film roles in the 1980s, Penn emerged as a prominent leading actor with the 1995 drama film ''[[Dead Man Walking (film)|Dead Man Walking]]'', for which he earned his first Academy Award nomination and the [[Silver Bear for Best Actor|Best Actor Award]] at the [[46th Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]]. Penn received another two Oscar nominations for ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' (1999) and ''[[I Am Sam]]'' (2001), before winning his first Academy Award for Best Actor in 2003 for ''Mystic River'' and a second one in 2008 for ''Milk''.

== Career ==

=== Acting ===
Penn appeared in a 1974 episode of the ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' television series as an extra when his father, Leo, directed some of the episodes. He launched his film career with the 1981 action-drama ''[[Taps (film)|Taps]]'', where he played a military high school cadet.<ref name=tca/> A year later, he appeared in the hit comedy ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'', in the role of surfer-stoner Jeff Spicoli, with his character helping popularize the word "dude" in popular culture.<ref name=tca/> In 1983, Penn appeared as Mick O'Brien, a troubled youth, in the drama ''[[Bad Boys (1983 film)|Bad Boys]]''.<ref name=tca/> The role earned Penn favorable reviews and jump-started his career as a serious actor.

[[File:Sean Penn Cannes.jpg|thumb|left|upright|At the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]].]] 
In 1985, Penn played [[Andrew Daulton Lee]] in the film ''[[The Falcon and the Snowman]]'', which closely followed an actual criminal case.<ref name=tca/> Lee was a former drug dealer by trade, convicted of espionage for the [[Soviet Union]] and originally sentenced to life in prison, later being paroled in 1998. Penn later hired Lee as his personal assistant, partly because he wanted to reward Lee for allowing him to play Lee in the film; he was also a firm believer in rehabilitation and thought Lee should be successfully reintegrated into society, since he was a free man again.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/apr/08/seanpenn ''When Sean's having fun, it's hard to imagine having more fun'']. Guardian Unlimited. April 8, 2005.</ref> In 1986, Penn starred in the drama ''[[At Close Range]]''.<ref name=tca/> He stopped acting for a few years in the early 1990s, having been dissatisfied with the industry, and focused on making his directing debut.<ref name=tca/>

Nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] five times, he has won the award twice. The Academy first recognized his work in nominating him for playing a racist murderer on death row in the 1995 drama film ''[[Dead Man Walking (film)|Dead Man Walking]]''. He was nominated again for his comedic performance as an egotistical jazz guitarist in the 1999 film ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]''. He received his third nomination after portraying a mentally handicapped father in 2001's ''[[I am Sam]]''. Penn finally won for his role in the 2003 [[Boston]] crime-drama ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]''. In 2004, he played a disturbed man bent on killing the president in ''[[The Assassination of Richard Nixon]]''. That year, he was invited to join the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2004/04.06.28.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040630082206/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2004/04.06.28.html | archivedate = June 30, 2004 | title = Academy Invites 127 to Membership | publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | date = June 28, 2004}}</ref>

In 2006, Penn portrayed governor Willie Stark (based on [[Huey Long]]) in an adaptation of the classic American novel ''[[All the King's Men]]''. The film was a critical and commercial failure, named by a 2010 ''[[Forbes]]'' article as the biggest flop in the last five years.<ref name="Forbes01222010">Pomerantz, Dorothy.

In 2010, he starred as [[Joseph C. Wilson]] in ''[[Fair Game (2010 film)|Fair Game]]'', a film adaptation of [[Valerie Plame]]'s [[Fair Game: My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House|2007 memoir]]. He co-starred in the drama ''[[The Tree of Life (film)|The Tree of Life]]'', which won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]].

=== Directing ===

On October 18, 2002, Penn placed a US$56,000 advertisement in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' asking then [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] to end a cycle of violence.

Due to his visibility as an on-the-ground advocate for rescue and aid efforts in the aftermath, Penn was designated by president [[Michel Martelly]] as Ambassador-at-Large for Haiti, the first time that a non-Haitian citizen has been designated as such in the country's history. Penn received the designation on January 31, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57369387/haiti-names-sean-penn-ambassador-at-large/|title = Haiti names Sean Penn "ambassador at large"|publisher = CBS News|date = January 31, 2012}}</ref>

===Pakistan===
Penn gained significant attention in the [[Pakistan]] media when he visited [[Karachi]] and [[Badin]] in 2012.
On 23 March 2012, he visited flood-stricken villages of Karim Bux Jamali, Dargah Shah Gurio and Peero Lashari in [[Badin]] District. He was accompanied by US Consul General Willian J. Martin and distributed  blankets, quilts, kitchen items and other goods amongst flood survivors.<ref>{{cite news|author=Razaq Khatti|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/354309/hollywood-visitor-sean-penn-comes-to-badin/|title=Hollywood visitor: Sean Penn comes to Badin|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=March 24, 2012|accessdate=March 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Mahim Maher|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/my_pakistan/item/sean_penn_comes_to_pakistan_20120324/|title=Sean Penn comes to Pakistan|work=[[JewishJournal.com]]|date=March 24, 2012|accessdate=March 25, 2012}}</ref>

He also laid floral wreaths and paid respect at the shrine of [[Abdullah Shah Ghazi]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Saba Imtiaz|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/354623/class-act-a-touch-of-inspiration-runs-both-ways-as-sean-penn-visits-shrine-and-edhi-home/|title=A touch of inspiration runs both ways as Sean Penn visits shrine and Edhi home|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=March 25, 2012|accessdate=March 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=APP|url=http://www.dawn.com/2012/03/24/actor-sean-penn-visits-edhi-centre-karachi.html|title=Actor Sean Penn visits Edhi Centre, Karachi|work=DAWN.COM|date=March 25, 2012|accessdate=March 25, 2012}}</ref>

===Release of Jacob Ostreicher from Bolivian Prison===
Penn is believed to have played a role in getting American entrepreneur [[Jacob Ostreicher]] released from a Bolivian prison in 2013, and was credited by Ostreicher for having personally nursed him back to health upon his release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/05/21/orthodox-jewish-captive-jacob-ostreicher-recounts-how-sean-penn-nursed-him-back-to-health-in-his-own-home/ |title=Orthodox Jewish Captive Jacob Ostreicher Reveals How Sean Penn Nursed Him Back to Health in His Own Home |date=21 May 2014 |work=The Algemeiner |accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Defense of Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez===
In March 2010, Penn called for the arrest of those referring to [[President of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez]] as a dictator.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/11/sean-penn-hugo-chavez-venezuela | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Rory | last=Carroll | title=Sean Penn: Journalists who call Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez a dictator should be jailed | date=March 11, 2010}}</ref> The two were friends, and when Ch<U+00E1>vez died, Penn said: "Venezuela and its revolution will endure under the proven leadership of [[Vice President of Venezuela|Vice President]] [[Nicol<U+00E1>s Maduro|(Nicol<U+00E1>s) Maduro]]. Today the United States lost a friend it never knew it had. And poor people around the world lost a champion. I lost a friend I was blessed to have."<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/05/world/americas/hugo-chavez-reaction/?hpt=hp_t1 Hugo Chavez's death draws sympathy, anger]</ref>

===Falkland Islands controversy===
[[File:Sean Penn with Cristina Fern<U+00E1>ndez.jpg|thumb|Sean Penn and [[President of Argentina]] [[Cristina Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Kirchner]], during his visit in [[Argentina]].]]

In February 2012 Penn met with the [[President of Argentina]], [[Cristina Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Kirchner]] in Buenos Aires where he made a statement on the long-running [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|dispute]] between Argentina and the [[United Kingdom]] over the [[Falkland Islands]], saying: "I know I came in a very sensitive moment in terms of diplomacy between Argentina and the UK over the Malvinas islands. And I hope that diplomats can establish true dialogue in order to solve the conflict as the world today cannot tolerate ridiculous demonstrations of colonialism. The way of dialogue is the only way to achieve a better solution for both nations."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-17022603/Falklands Dispute: Argentine union to boycott UK ships/|title = Falklands dispute: Argentine union to boycott UK ships|publisher = BBC|date = February 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/feb/14/sean-penn-argentina-falkland-islands |title = Sean Penn backs Argentina over Falkland Islands|publisher = The Guardian|date = February 14, 2012|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/92675/the-world-cant-tolerate-anymore-ridiculous-colonialism-sean-penn-says-after-meeting-cfk|work=[[Buenos Aires Herald]]|title='The world can't tolerate anymore ridiculous colonialism,' Sean Penn says after meeting CFK|date=February 15, 2012|accessdate=February 17, 2012}}</ref>

The comments were taken as support of Argentina's claim to the islands and evoked strong reactions in the British media, with one satirical article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' requesting that Penn "return his [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] estate to the [[Mexican-American War|Mexicans]]".<ref>{{cite news|url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100137521/sean-penn-should-return-his-malibu-estate-to-the-mexicans/ |title = Sean Penn should return his Malibu estate to the Mexicans |publisher = The Daily Telegraph|date = February 15, 2012|location=London}}</ref> Lauren Collins of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote: "As of today, Sean Penn is the new [[Karl Lagerfeld]]<U+2014>the man upon whom, having disrespected something dear to the United Kingdom, the British papers most gleefully pile contempt".<ref>{{cite news|author=Collins, Lauren|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/lauren-collins/2012/02/sean-penns-falkland-war.html#ixzz1mb699mfE|title=SEAN PENN<U+2019>S FALKLANDS WAR|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=February 15, 2012|accessdate=February 17, 2012}}</ref>

Penn later claimed that he had been misrepresented by the British press and that his criticism of "colonialism" was a reference to the deployment of [[Prince William]] as an air-sea rescue pilot, describing it as a "message of pre-emptive intimidation". He claimed that the Prince's posting meant "the automatic deployment of warships", and stated: "My oh my, aren't people sensitive to the word 'colonialism', particularly those who implement colonialism."<ref>{{cite news|author=Topping, Alexandra|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/feb/15/sean-penn-prince-william-falklands?newsfeed=true|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Sean Penn hits out at Prince William's Falklands posting|date=February 15, 2012|accessdate=February 17, 2012|location=London}}</ref><ref name="Penn">{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/feb/23/sean-penn-falklands-malvinas-diplomacy-interrupted?intcmp=239 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sean | last=Penn | title=Sean Penn: The Malvinas/Falklands <U+2013> diplomacy interrupted | date=February 23, 2012}}</ref> In a piece written in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Penn wrote that "the legalisation of Argentinian immigration to the Malvinas/Falkland Islands is one that it seems might have been addressed, but for the speculative discovery of booming offshore oil in the surrounding seas this past year". He further wrote that "irresponsible journalism" had suggested "that I had taken a specific position against those currently residing in the Malvinas/Falkland Islands, that they should either be deported or absorbed into Argentine rule. I neither said, nor insinuated that".<ref name="Penn"/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/feb/23/sean-penn-britain-argentina-falklands?newsfeed=true | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Nicholas | last=Watt | title=Sean Penn calls for Britain to negotiate with Argentina over Falklands | date=February 23, 2012}}</ref>
