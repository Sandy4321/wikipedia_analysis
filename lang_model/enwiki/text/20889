== Plot ==

A group of kids break down while driving down a remote forest road. After a disturbing night alone in the woods, they stumble upon Camp Hiawatha in full swing and packed with seemingly happy teenagers. However, the teens and the camp itself are strangely trapped back in 1981. The clothes, the music, the hair, and the attitudes are 24 years back in time. The campers are forced to relive the same day and night over and over again. The night when a silent killer stalked the camp silencing campers and counselors one by one. The kids from the present struggle to understand and help the teens from 1981 break free of the [[curse]]. Working together both time-periods begin to learn about the different worlds from which they come and what it will take for all of them to survive.

== Reception ==

Sticky Red gave ''Camp Slaughter'' a one and half out of five, and said that while the film had a lot to offer; it was brought down by budgetary constraints, poor quality sound, gratuitous scenes, obnoxious characters, unoriginal and sloppy kills, bad acting, confusing editing and cinematography, nonsensical plot twists, and a weak ending. <ref> {{cite web |url = http://redandsticky.blogspot.ca/2011/07/time-after-time-after-time-after-time.html|title = Time after time after time after time...|author = Kaijinu|publisher = Sticky Red|date = July 26, 2011|work = Camp Slaughter|accessdate = January 2, 2013}} </ref> Similar criticisms were made by Vegan Voorhees and eFilmCritic, both of whom gave the film two stars out of five, with the former stating "With a better collection of actors and shot with more care, this could've been a minor classic but it's destined to become just one more post-millennial [[Direct-to-video|DTV]] slasher film that claimed it was recapturing the old school methods but failed miserably." <ref> {{cite web |url = http://www.hudsonlee.com/?p=5316|title = All you can do is step back in time|author = Chrys Hudson Lee|publisher = Vegan Voorhees|date = August 4, 2010|work = Camp Slaughter|accessdate = January 2, 2013}} </ref> <ref> {{cite web |url = http://www.efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=14205|title = ''Camp Daze''|author = Jay Seaver|publisher = eFilmCritic|date = April 4, 2006|work = Camp Slaughter|accessdate = January 2, 2013}} </ref>
