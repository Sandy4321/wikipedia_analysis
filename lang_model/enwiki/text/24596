Operation ''Tiger Hound'' was a covert [[United States Air Force]] interdiction campaign conducted in [[Laos]] from 5 December 1965 till 11 November 1968, during the [[Vietnam Conflict]]. The purpose of the operation was to interdict the flow of supplies on the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] (the Truong Son Strategic Supply Corridor to the North Vietnamese) from [[North Vietnam]], through southeastern Laos, and into the northeastern corner of [[South Vietnam]]. 

The geographic boundry of the operation was carved from the area of Laos already under bombardment under [[Operation Steel Tiger]]. This was done at the behest of the American commander in South Vietnam, General [[William C. Westmoreland]], who saw that area of Laos that bordered the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam as merely an extension of his area of operations. The Joint Chiefs agreed. Unlike [[Operation Barrell Roll]] and ''Steel Tiger,'' however, the bombing in the new area would be conducted by the South Vietnamese Air Force and by US Air Force aircraft based in South Vietnam (aircraft participating in ''Barrell Roll'' and ''Steel Tiger'' were generally based in Thailand).
