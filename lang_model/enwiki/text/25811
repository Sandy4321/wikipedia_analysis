'''Vojihna''' or '''Vojin of Drama''' ({{lang-sr|<U+0412><U+043E><U+0458><U+0438><U+0445><U+043D><U+0430>}}{{Cref2|A}} ; ca 1298<U+2013>1360), was a [[Serbian nobility|Serbian nobleman]] that rose through the ranks and became one of the most acclaimed military commanders (''[[voivode]]''<ref name=LB364/>) and dukes of [[Stephen Uro<U+0161> IV Du<U+0161>an of Serbia]] during the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Kingdom]] and [[Serbian Empire|Empire]] (1331<U+2013>71), he was titled ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''<ref name=LB364/> ({{lang-gr|<U+03BA><U+03B1><U+1FD6><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03C1>}}, sr. <U+045B><U+0435><U+0441><U+0430><U+0440>/<U+043A><U+0435><U+0441><U+0430><U+0440>), hence, he is mostly known as '''Caesar Vojihna''' (<U+043A><U+0435><U+0441><U+0430><U+0440> <U+0412><U+043E><U+0458><U+0438><U+0445><U+043D><U+0430>).<ref name=Fajfric5>Fajfric, p. 5</ref> He held the region of [[Drama, Greece|Drama]].

==Origin==
He was probably born around 1298.<ref name=ZAPIS9/>

In a [[Chilandar]] charter of Uro<U+0161> IV Du<U+0161>an, Vojihna is mentioned as "nobleman and associate of my Empire, cousin Vojihna".<ref name=KJ1>''Knji<U+017E>evno delo monahinje Jefimije'', p. 1</ref> This has been interpreted in several ways; Cirkovic understand this as the two are relatives, but the degree of kinship can't be determined.<ref name=ZAPIS9>Zapis Raj<U+010D>ina Sudi<U+0107>a kao istorijski izvor, pp. 9<U+2013>10</ref> According to Vojicic, he is the son of [[Uro<U+0161>ica]],<ref name=ZAPIS9/> however this would mean that they are second cousins, thus Purkovic connects the kinship through [[Stephen Constantine]], making the two cousins.<ref name=ZAPIS9/>

It is thought that he is the same as the ''<U+017D>upan Vojihna'', who is mentioned in 1323, as an ally of [[Stephen Vladislav II]], during the war of the throne against [[Stephen Uro<U+0161> III De<U+010D>anski of Serbia|Stephen Uro<U+0161> III]] following the death of [[Stephen Milutin]].<ref name=ZAPIS9/> With emphasis on Vladislav II being the son of Dragutin, and Du<U+0161>an calling Vojihna his cousin, this might be an evidence on Vojihna being the son of Uro<U+0161>ica, the brother of Vladislav II.<ref name=ZAPIS9/>

==Life==
In 1341, [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]] died, which sparked a [[Byzantine civil war of 1341-1347|civil war]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In 1342 Du<U+0161>an became an ally of [[John VI Kantakouzenos]], but only a year after, switched to the side of [[John V Palaiologos]]. Kantakouzenos found new allies in the [[Emirate of Aydin]]. In 1344, Du<U+0161>an sent a small army led by ''Voivode'' [[Preljub]] to intecept the Aydin Turks. The Serbs were [[Battle of Stephaniana|defeated in battle at Stephaniana]], however it did not halt the Serbian conquest.<ref name=Soulis24>Soulis (1984), p. 24</ref><ref>Fine (1994), p. 304</ref>

[[Stephen Uro<U+0161> IV Du<U+0161>an]], called "Du<U+0161>an the Mighty" was proclaimed Emperor at [[Serres]] in 1345. In this southeasternmost part of his Empire, Du<U+0161>an appointed Voihna as governor of Drama, not far from Serres, before November 1345.<ref name=Fajfric5/><ref name=KJ1/> When Du<U+0161>an was crowned "[[Emperor of the Serbs and Greeks]]" at [[Skopje]] on 16 April 1346, he also crowned his son [[Uro<U+0161> V]] as King. Among his royal members and nobility he appointed [[Simeon Uro<U+0161>]], [[Jovan Asen]], [[Jovan Oliver]] as [[Despot (court title)|Despot]]s, and [[Dejan Draga<U+0161>]], [[Branko Mladenovi<U+0107>]] as [[Sebastokrator]]s, and [[Grgur Golubi<U+0107>]], [[Preljub]] and Voihna (before 1348<ref name=ZAPIS9/>) as [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]s.  He was second in rank to ''Caesar'' Grgur.<ref name=ZAPIS9/> 

In the end of 1347 or early 1348, he followed Du<U+0161>an to [[Mount Athos]].<ref name=KJ1/> He donated the village of Potolino in the lower Struma province to the Chilandar in 1348.<ref name=ZAPIS9/>

[[Image:Dusanporodica.jpg|left|thumb|Fresco of Emperor [[Stefan Du<U+0161>an]], his wife [[Helena of Bulgaria|Helena]], and their son [[Stephen Uro<U+0161> V of Serbia|Stefan Uro<U+0161> V]].]]

Immediately after Du<U+0161>an's death (20 December 1355), his wife [[Helena of Bulgaria|Empress Helena]] was found in Serres.<ref name=Fajfric5/> She started to exert her imperial control on the region.<ref name=Fajfric5/> This surely was against the goals of Vojihna, which would later on trigger armed conflicts.<ref name=Fajfric5/> How the Empress ended up in Serres and started to rule it is unknown, it exists sources saying she was in the region staying away from the harsh winter in the north, just when her husband died.<ref name=Fajfric5/> As she was energetic and smart (although not so talented), she might have foreseen the crumbling of the Empire, and sought to rule this region.<ref name=Fajfric5/> If this version is correct, Vojihna and his son-in-law [[Uglje<U+0161>a Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>]] (the son of [[Vuka<U+0161>in Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>]]) were obliged to work for her as they had done to Du<U+0161>an, although as the future will tell; with less enthusiasm and fidelity.<ref name=Fajfric5/> It is not known how much power Vojihna had in the Serres province, although he most likely had the ambitions of putting it under his control.<ref name=Fajfric5/>

[[Matthew Kantakouzenos]] led [[Byzantine civil war of 1352-1357|another civil war]] against [[John V Palaiologos]], and when Vojihna heard that Matthew was coming with his Turkish troops (the [[Emirate of Aydin]]) he immediately consulted the court. As allies of John V (a relative Uro<U+0161>), Uro<U+0161> assembled an army for his mother that was led by Vojihna.<ref>''The Serbs and Byzantium during the reign of Tsar Stephen Du<U+0161>an (1331<U+2013>55) and his successors'', p. 88-90</ref> Among the forces were also Serbs from the vicinity of Serres.<ref>''Studies on the internal diaspora of the Byzantine Empire'', [http://books.google.com/?id=ohFJD_QT3E8C&pg=PA156 p. 156]</ref>
In fall of 1356 he captured [[Matthew Kantakouzenos]], the rival Byzantine Emperor and son of the former Emperor [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] (1347<U+2013>54).<ref>''The Serbs'', p. 76</ref> Vojihna planned to release Matthew for a ransom, but soon realized that Emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] was willing to offer a far greater sum.<ref name=LB327/> Matthew renounced his territory and imperial title in December 1357 and John V continued to rule as sole Emperor.<ref name=LB327/>

In 1358, his wife donated to the [[Koutloumousiou monastery]].<ref name=TMA102>''The medieval aristocracy on Mount Athos'',  [http://books.google.com/?id=twYuAAAAYAAJ&q=vojihna p. 102]</ref>

In 1359, Helena abdicated and took monastic vows, under the name Elisabeth.

He died in ca 1360, and his lands were inherited by his son-in-law [[Uglje<U+0161>a Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>|Uglje<U+0161>a]].<ref name=LB364>''The Late Medieval Balkans'', p. 364</ref> He was buried in [[Hilandar]], alongside his son who died prematurely.<ref>''Hilandarski zbornik
, Volym 7'', p. 18</ref>
