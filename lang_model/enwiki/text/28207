Although now officially restricted to use by Royal representatives and at Royal residences, the Banner of the King of Scots continues to be one of Scotland's most recognisable symbols.<ref>[http://www.royalregimentofscotland.org.uk/badgeunderfire.php The Royal Regiment of Scotland website] "The new cap badge incorporates two of Scotland's most recognisable symbols, the Saltire and the Lion Rampant".

==Design==
Displaying a red lion rampant, with blue tongue and claws, within a red double border on a yellow background, the design of the Royal Standard of Scotland is [[Blazon|formally specified in heraldry]] as: ''[[Or (heraldry)|Or]], a [[lion]] [[rampant]] [[Gules]] armed and langued [[Azure]] within a double tressure flory counter-flory of the second'',<ref>Daniel Cogn<U+00E9>, Claire Boudreau, Auguste Vachon ''Genealogica & heraldica: proceedings of the 22nd International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences in Ottawa, August 18-23, 1996''. University of Ottawa Press, 1998. p.402, p.403</ref> meaning: A [[Or (heraldry)|gold]] (Or) [[Field (heraldry)|background]], whose [[Charge (heraldry)|principal symbol]] is a [[Gules|red]] (Gules) [[Lion (heraldry)|upright lion]] (lion rampant) with [[Azure|blue]] (Azure) [[Charge (heraldry)#Attitude of animals|claws and tongue]] (armed and langued), surrounded by a two lined [[wiktionary:tressure|border]] (tressure) decorated with [[wiktionary:counterflory|opposing pairs]] of [[Fleur-de-lis|floral symbols]] (flory counter-flory) of the second colour specified in the blazon (Gules). Used as a house flag, its proportions are 5:4.<ref>[http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/375.html Further Guidance on Flags] The Court of the Lord Lyon. Retrieved on 10 August 2009</ref>

==History==
[[File:Alexander II (Alba) ii.JPG|thumb|right|[[Obverse and reverse|Reverse]] of [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II's]] [[Great Seal]], displaying the [[Lion rampant]].]] 
The [[Lion rampant]] is commonly thought to have been adopted in the early 12th century by [[William I of Scotland|William I]] "the Lion", but there is no evidence of its use as "the Arms of the Dominion of Scotland" before 1222, when it appeared upon the [[Great Seal of Scotland|Great Seal]] of his son, [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]].<ref name="mcandrew"/> However, it has been suggested that the Royal arms of Scotland were first devised by [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]] circa 1061, given that the central lion rampant motif is also used as a badge by [[Irish clans]] who claim a place in the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesian]] genealogies,<ref>George Pepper ''The Irish shield and monthly milesian, Volume 1'' (''Volume 937 of American periodical series, 1800-1850''). s.n., 1829. p.316</ref> in common with Malcolm III.<ref>John O'Hart ''Irish Pedigrees: Or, The Origin and Stem of the Irish Nation'' 5th Edition. J. Duffy and Co., 1892. p.772</ref> An earlier recorded Scottish Royal standard featured a [[European dragon|dragon]], which is known to have been used at the [[Battle of the Standard]] in 1138 by [[David I of Scotland|David I]].<ref>John Strong Perry Tatlock ''The legendary history of Britain: Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae and its early vernacular versions'' University of California Press, 1950. p.329</ref>

Following the [[Union of the Crowns]] of the monarch of England and Scotland, in 1603, the Royal Standard of Scotland was incorporated into the Royal standards of successive [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish]] and (following the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1707) [[List of British monarchs|British]] monarchs, with all such Royal standards being [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] in order to include the banner of the arms of each individual realm. Since 1603, the Royal Standard of Scotland has appeared in both the first and fourth quadrants of the quartered Royal standard used in Scotland, whilst appearing only in the second quadrant of that used elsewhere.<ref name="britmon"/>

==Protocol==
===Use at Royal residences===
[[Image:Wfm holyrood palace.jpg|thumb|The Royal Standard of Scotland flying above [[Holyrood Palace]].]]
[[File:Balmoral Castle.jpg|thumb|The Royal Standard of Scotland flying above [[Balmoral Castle]].]]
Today, the Royal Standard of Scotland is used officially at the Scottish Royal residences <U+2013> the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]] ([[Edinburgh]]) and [[Balmoral Castle]] ([[Aberdeenshire]]) <U+2013> when [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty The Queen]] is not in residence. (The [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom]] used in Scotland being flown when The Sovereign is present.)<ref name="britmon"/>

===Use by Royal representatives===
The Royal Standard of Scotland is also used by a few [[Great Officers of State]] who officially represent The Sovereign in Scotland, including the [[First Minister of Scotland]] (as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland), [[Lord Lieutenant]]s within their respective [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|Lieutenancies]], the [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Lord High Commissioner]] to the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] of the [[Church of Scotland]], the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] and other lieutenants who may be specially appointed by The Sovereign.<ref name="lyon"/

===Use by the Heir Apparent=== 
A variation of the Royal Standard of Scotland is used by the [[heir apparent]] to the King of Scots, the [[Duke of Rothesay]], whose personal Standard is the Royal Standard of Scotland [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with an [[Azure]] coloured plain [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points.<ref>Bruce A. McAndrew ''Scotland's historic heraldry'' Boydell Press, 2006. p.276 ISBN 1843832615</ref> The personal banner of the [[Duke of Rothesay]] also features the same, displayed upon an inner [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]].<ref>[http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/abouttheprince/standards/ Standards] Website of The Prince of Wales. Retrieved on 28 August 2009.</ref>

===Legal status===
As the personal banner of The Sovereign, use of the Royal Standard of Scotland is restricted under the [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] 1672 cap. 47 and 30 & 31 Vict. cap. 17, and any unauthorised use of such is an offence under the Act.<ref name="lyon"/> In 1978 a [[St Albans]] linen merchant, Denis Pamphilon, was fined <U+00A3>100 daily for usurpation of the standard on decorative bedspreads until he desisted, and both [[Rangers F.C.]] and the [[Scottish National Party]] have been [[Admonition|admonished]] by the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] for their improper and non-authorised use of the standard.<ref>Groom, Nick (2006). ''The Union Jack: the Story of the British Flag'', Atlantic Books, p.294. ISBN 1843543362.</ref> Despite such action, the flag continues to feature on a variety of merchandise and souvenirs produced commercially for Scotland's economically important [[Tourism in Scotland|tourism]] industry.<ref>[http://www.thescottishsouvenirshop.com/cgi-bin/ss000001.pl?SS=Lion+rampant&ACTION=Go!&PR=-1&TB=A&SHOP= The Scottish Souvenir Shop - Products featuring the Lion Rampant] [http://www.scotweb.co.uk/multisearch?set_ps_offset=0:multi_search=Lion%20Rampant ScotWeb - Products featuring the Lion Rampant]</ref>

On November 18, 2007, shortly after announcing his decision to retire as the 34th Lord Lyon, [[Robin Blair]], in an interview given to the [[Sunday Post]], was reported to have stated that "''in 1935 King George V permitted people to wave small lion rampant flags as part of his silver jubilee celebrations. Subsequently this was regarded as allowing the use of hand-held flags on other occasions to express loyalty to the sovereign. Gradually people started to use this flag at sporting events, although this was not envisaged in 1935"''.<ref>[http://www.djmcgeachie.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=60&sid=8a73745574828ff4e1edcebf28785078 The McGeachie Surname Forum] Retrieved 28 August 2009.</ref> Today the flag continues to be used unofficially as a second national [[flag of Scotland]], particularly at sporting events.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/scotland/article1124389.ece How Scottish fans fell out of love with Hampden and their team] ''[[The Times]]''. 29 March 2003.

==Appearance in other Royal Standards==
As well as forming the basis of the Standard of the [[heir apparent]] to the King of Scots, the Duke of Rothesay,<ref>{{cite book|title=Scotland's Historic Heraldry|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=1843832615|last=McAndrew|first=Bruce|date=2006|quote=From ca 1398, the King's eldest son was formally the Duke of Rothesay, though he is seldom found thus stated. Moreover, in 1469 the earldom of Carrick, lordship of Bute and the castle of Rothesay were permanently united and considered as the fief of the eldest son of the King of Scots; the dukedom of Rothesay is deemed to descend with them. His arms were the royal arms of Scotland with the addition of a label of three points azure|page=276}} [http://books.google.com/books?id=QFkI3G31HTMC&pg=RA1-PA276&lpg=RA1-PA27 At Google Books]</ref>  (the [[title]] currently held by [[Prince Charles|His Royal Highness, The Prince Charles]]), the Royal Standard of Scotland has since 1603 been a component of what is now styled the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom (both that version used exclusively in Scotland and that used elsewhere). It similarly appears in the [[Royal Standard of Canada]],<ref>[http://www.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=518&ProjectElementID=1811 The Flag of Her Majesty the Queen for personal use in Canada]  The Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada.

==National Flag of Scotland==
{{main|The Saltire}}
[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|right|[[The Saltire]].]]
In contrast to the Royal Standard, [[The Saltire]], also known as the Cross of Saint Andrew or Saint Andrew's Cross, is the [[national flag]] of Scotland. The flag of Scotland's [[patron saint]], [[Saint Andrew]], it consists of a blue field with a white or silver diagonal cross reaching to its edges, blazoned ''Azure, a [[saltire]] [[Argent]]''. Unlike the Lion Rampant, as a national flag, this is the correct flag for all [[Scottish people|Scots]] or Scottish [[Corporation|corporate bodies]] to fly to demonstrate their loyalty and their [[Scottish national identity|Scottish nationality]].<ref>[http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/236.html The Saltire] The Court of the Lord Lyon. Retrieved on 10 October 2008.</ref>

It is also flown from  all [[Scottish Government]] buildings every day from 8&nbsp;am until sunset, except on [[United Kingdom]] "national days" when the Saltire shall be lowered and replaced with the [[Union Flag]].<ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/royal-ceremonial/flag-guidance Flag guidance] Scottish Government Website.
