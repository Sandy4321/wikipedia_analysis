The '''1865 Atlantic hurricane season''' included two [[landfall (meteorology)|landfalling]] [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]], with one that caused over 325&nbsp;deaths. The first storm was reported on May&nbsp;30 by ships in the western [[Caribbean]]. A month later, a storm hit southern [[Texas]], and in late August, a storm paralleled the coastline of the [[Carolinas]]. The fourth storm of the season was also the longest-lasting, forming east of the [[Lesser Antilles]] before hitting Guadeloupe and eventually moving ashore in [[Louisiana]]. In both of its major landfalls, the storm left many houses destroyed. There was confusion whether or not the fifth storm of the season was separate from the fourth storm, as both systems struck Louisiana in September. Another hurricane occurred in late September, before the final storm of the season developed north of [[Panama]]. The final hurricane struck Cuba and Key West, Florida before dissipating north of [[Bermuda]] on October&nbsp;25.

At one time, one hurricane researcher identified a tropical storm over Cuba in late August,<ref name="year"/> although there was no evidence the storm actually existed.<ref name="meta"/> There was also a report of a hurricane over Louisiana on October&nbsp;22,<ref name="la"/> although it is unknown if it was related to other storms in the season.<ref name="year"/> There may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist [[Christopher Landsea]] estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.<ref>{{cite journal|author=[[Chris Landsea]]|journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos]]|volume=88|date=2007-05-01|pages=197<U+2013>208|title=Counting Atlantic Tropical Cyclones Back to 1900|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2011-01-18|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/landsea-eos-may012007.pdf|format=PDF|issue=18|doi=10.1029/2007EO180001}}</ref>

==Storms==
===Tropical Storm One===
On May&nbsp;30, a tropical storm in the western Caribbean Sea wrecked a ship named the "Golden Rule", which was sailing from New York to the east coast of Nicaragua. The ship first encountered the storm on May&nbsp;29, reporting high winds and heavy rainfall. After the wreck, the crew sailed to a nearby island, where they were rescued by two United States ships after 10&nbsp;days.<ref name="year">{{cite web|author=Jos<U+00E9> Fern<U+00E1>ndez Partag<U+00E1>s|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|year=2003|title=Year 1865|accessdate=2011-06-21|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/Partagas/1865-1870/1865.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The winds were estimated at 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h), although the entire track of the storm is unknown.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

===Tropical Storm Two===
The second known storm of the season was reported near [[Brownsville, Texas]] on June&nbsp;30. Its existence is known based on a newspaper report in the [[The Times-Picayune|New Orleans Times]].<ref name="year"/> The winds were estimated at 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h); however, it is a potentially unreliable estimate due to a lack of significant population providing observations.<ref name="usts">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2011|title=Continental United States Tropical Storms: 1851-1930, 1983-2010|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2011-06-09|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/uststorms1851-1930&1983-2010-may11.html}}</ref> The entire track of the storm is unknown.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

===Tropical Storm Three===

A ship off the coast of [[Hatteras, North Carolina]] sustained damage from a storm on August&nbsp;20. Further ship reports indicated the tropical storm maintained a general northeast track off the North Carolina coastline.<ref name="year"/> On August&nbsp;22 the storm made its closest approach to the state, and while remaining offshore it produced winds of around {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} along the coast.<ref name="usts"/> Around that time, the storm attained peak winds of 70&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h) over the ocean. On August&nbsp;23, high waves from the storm left one ship's cargo a complete wreck. It was last observed on August&nbsp;24 to the southeast of [[Nantucket]].<ref name="year"/><div style="clear:both;"></div>

===Hurricane Four===

The fourth tropical cyclone of the season, also the longest-lasting, was first observed on September&nbsp;6 to the east of the [[Lesser Antilles]].<ref name="meta"/> A small cyclone, it tracked westward and struck [[Guadeloupe]] as a fully-developed hurricane. Many residents in the small nearby island of [[Marie-Galante]] evacuated to Guadeloupe, but some died in the attempt. In [[<U+00CE>les des Saintes]], the hurricane destroyed all but two buildings. Damage was similarly heavy in [[Basse-Terre]]. The overall death toll was estimated at 300, including 36 on Marie-Galante.<ref name="year"/> After moving through the Lesser Antilles, the hurricane moved through the Caribbean Sea, passing between Jamaica and Haiti and bypassing Cuba to the south. It curved northward in the Gulf of Mexico,<ref name="year"/> moving ashore on September&nbsp;13 near the border between Texas and Louisiana with an estimated [[atmospheric pressure]] of {{convert|969|mbar|inHg}}.<ref name="us">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2011|title=Continental U.S. Hurricanes:  1851 to 1930, 1983 to 2010|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2011-06-04|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/usland1851-1930&1983-2010-Mar2011.html}}</ref>

Upon moving ashore, the hurricane produced high tides as far east as the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]], in addition to as far inland as [[Calcasieu Lake]], Louisiana. Three towns were destroyed, causing two of them to be abandoned. Across the state, there were 25&nbsp;deaths, many of them in [[Cameron, Louisiana|Leesburg]].<ref name="la">{{cite web|author=David Roth|publisher=National Weather Service|date=2010-04-08|title=Louisiana Hurricane History|accessdate=2011-06-22|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/lahur.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> In neighboring Texas, damage was greatest in [[Orange, Texas|Orange]], where 196&nbsp;homes were destroyed out of the 200 in the town.

===Tropical Storm Five=== 
A tropical storm struck the south-central Louisiana coast on September&nbsp;7, while the previous system was located over the Caribbean. The storm wrecked a ship, and its winds were estimated around 70&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h). The track was incomplete, and there was a possibility that the storm was misreported as the previous hurricane.<ref name="year"/>

===Hurricane Six===
On September&nbsp;28, a ship encountered a hurricane to the northeast of the [[Turks and Caicos]] islands. The winds in the hurricane extended far to the northwest, and high waves affected the southeast United States coast from Charleston, South Carolina to Cape Hatteras. The hurricane's track is unknown.<ref name="year"/>

===Hurricane Seven===
{{Infobox Hurricane Small

The final tropical cyclone of the season formed on October&nbsp;18, just north of the coast of Panama. The storm brushed the country's coast with high waves for several days, causing $300,000 in damage (1865&nbsp;USD).<ref name="year"/> Moving north-northwestward, the storm intensified into a hurricane by October&nbsp;21 over the western Caribbean. After turning more to the north, it struck Cuba, producing strong winds that destroyed the roof of the [[Belen Jesuit Preparatory School|Belen College Observatory]] in [[Havana]]. In the city, the hurricane destroyed several boats and houses. A station on the island recorded a pressure of 975&nbsp;mbar (28.78&nbsp;inHg),<ref name="year"/> suggesting winds of about 80&nbsp;mph (135&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="meta"/>

After crossing the island, the hurricane intensified further over the Florida straits until striking [[Key West, Florida]], where peak winds were estimated around 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="meta"/> Its pressure was estimated at {{convert|969|mbar|inHg}},<ref name="us"/> and the hurricane either sunk or washed every boat ashore at the harbor in Key West.<ref name="year"/> Rainfall totaled {{convert|4.10|in|mm|abbr=on}} over a three day period.<ref name="meta"/> In nearby [[Dry Tortugas National Park|Fort Jefferson]] in the [[Dry Tortugas]], the hurricane destroyed one building and damaged several others, killing one person.<ref name="year"/> It later moved across the Florida mainland, weakening slightly.<ref name="meta"/> About a dozen ships encountered the hurricane across the western Atlantic, before the storm was last observed on October&nbsp;25 north of Bermuda.<ref name="year"/>
