The '''Australian baseball team''' is the national [[baseball]] team of [[Australia]]. They are ranked as the top team in [[Oceania]], and are the Oceanian Champions, having been awarded the title in 2007 when [[New Zealand national baseball team|New Zealand]] withdrew from the [[Oceania Baseball Championship]]. They are the 11th ranked mens baseball team,<ref name="ibaf rankings aug09"/> the lowest position they have been in since the [[IBAF World Rankings|ranking system]] was introduced. The highest rank they have achieved was ninth.<ref name="ibaf rankings mar09"/>

The Australian team participated in the [[Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Baseball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], [[Baseball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] and [[Baseball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], but failed to qualify for [[Baseball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]]. The team has also participated in both of the other major international baseball tournaments recognised by the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF): the [[Baseball World Cup]] and most recently the [[World Baseball Classic]] (WBC).<ref name="ibaf world ranking notes">{{cite web|url=http://ibaf.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Files_-_world_rankings/4221-IBAF_World_Rankings_Notes.pdf|title=IBAF World Ranking Notes|date=13 January 2009|accessdate=23 June 2009|publisher=International Baseball Federation|format=PDF}}</ref>

The team is controlled by the [[Australian Baseball Federation]], which is represented in the [[Baseball Confederation of Oceania]] (BCO). Prior to the BCO's formation, Australia competed in the [[Asian Baseball Championship]]. Australia contested the [[2009 World Youth Baseball Championship]] in August,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://competition.baseballeurope.com/2009/taiwan/standing.php | title=16U AA World Youth Championships | publisher=International Baseball Federation | accessdate=19 August 2009}}</ref> and is due to compete in the [[2009 Baseball World Cup]] in September this year.<ref name="2009wc info"/>

==World ranking==
{{see also|IBAF World Rankings}}
In January 2009 the [[International Baseball Federation]] created a ranking system so that the nations involved in international competition could be compared independently. Teams receive points based on the position they finish at the end of tournaments. The system takes into account results not only of the senior men's teams but also of junior teams. Weightings that emphasise the importance of certain tournaments are based on the number of teams competing, the number of continents represented (or eligible to be represented), and in the case of continental tournaments such as the [[Oceania Baseball Championship]] the relative strength of teams eligible. Only results within the previous four years are used, so points are added and removed over time.<ref name="ibaf world ranking notes"/> Since the system began, the rankings have been adjusted after the completion of tournaments qualifying for the ranking process; the most recent was the [[2009 Asian Baseball Championship]].

When the rankings were first introduced, Australia was listed at 10th position.<ref name="ibaf rankings jan09"/> The high-water mark was after the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]] when they were in 9th.<ref name="ibaf rankings mar09"/> The lowest position they have been in the ranking since its inception is their current position of 11th.<ref name="ibaf rankings aug09"/>

== International competition ==
In January 2009 the [[International Baseball Federation|IBAF]], in releasing the first edition of the [[IBAF World Rankings|world rankings]], announced the classifications of various tournaments that contributed to the rankings themselves. In doing so, they identified that of the "world" tournaments, there were different levels with differing levels of weighting towards the ranks: major world championships, minor world championships, world qualifying tournaments and continental championships/qualifying tournaments.<ref name="ibaf world ranking notes"/> 

=== Major world championships ===
There are currently three recognised tournaments that are considered "major" by the IBAF: the [[World Baseball Classic]], the [[Baseball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] and the [[Baseball World Cup]].<ref name="ibaf world ranking notes"/> Of those, the Summer Olympics will be phased out of the rankings structure, as baseball will no longer be contested as an Olympic event.<ref>{{cite web | title=IBAF Statement Regarding IOC<U+2019>s Announcement on Re-instatement To The Olympic Programme For 2016 | url=http://www.ibaf.org/index.php?id=10&tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=3&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=315&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=9&cHash=6e90e66445 | date=14 August 2009 | accessdate=17 September 2009 | publisher=International Baseball Federation}}</ref>

Australia has participated in eight of the [[International Baseball Federation|IBAF]] World Cup tournaments. To date its best result was in the most recent tournament held in [[2007 Baseball World Cup|2007]], in which Australia placed 6th. At the same tournament, [[Trent Oeltjen]] became the first Australian player to be named in a World Cup All Star team,<ref name="oeltjen wc all star">{{cite web |url=http://www.mister-baseball.com/baseball-world-cup-allstar-team |title=Baseball World Cup: Allstar Team |accessdate=29 July 2009 |date=19 November 2007 |publisher=Mister-Baseball.com}}</ref> in recognition of his tournament-leading hitting and base-running statistics. Australia is due to send a team to the [[2009 Baseball World Cup|2009]] tournament in September.<ref name="2009wc info">{{cite web |url=http://www.2009baseballworldcup.com/index.php?id=29 |title=2009 Baseball World Cup: Australia |accessdate=29 July 2009 |publisher=International Baseball Federation}}</ref>

Until [[1986 Amateur World Series|1986]], the World Cup was actually referred to as the "Amateur World Series". The Amateur World Series only made use of [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] fixtures, with teams ranked at the end of the tournament. Australia's first appearance was in [[Italy]] in [[1978 Amateur World Series|1978]]. Out of the ten teams to compete, Australia finished 9th ahead of the other [[wikt:debut|debut]]ing team, [[Belgium national baseball team|Belgium]].<ref name="bjarkman worldcup 1978">[[#refBjarkman|Bjarkman 2005]], pp.431-2</ref>

Since the [[1988 Baseball World Cup|1988]] tournament, it has held the "World Cup" name, with the IBAF recognising the past Amateur World Series winners as World Cup winners. With the change of name came a change in format for the tournament: a round-robin phase, followed by a knockout phase for the top four teams. (Later tournaments would see two pools used in the first phase, and an expanded [[single-elimination tournament|knockout]] phase including the top four teams from each pool.) In the "World Cup Era", Australia has reached the knockout phase twice, finishing 7th in [[1998 Baseball World Cup|1998]]<ref name="bjarkman worldcup 1998">[[#refBjarkman|Bjarkman 2005]], p.437</ref> and most recently 6th in 2007.<ref name="world cup 2007 standings">{{cite web | url=http://www.mister-baseball.com/baseball-world-cup-final-standings/ | title=Baseball World Cup: Final Standings | publisher=Mister-Baseball.com | date=19 November 2009 | accessdate=19 August 2009 }}</ref>

{{Australia Baseball World Cup Record}}

=== Minor world championships ===
There are six separate tournaments that the [[International Baseball Federation|IBAF]] currently recognises as "minor world championships". Of those, Australia has only participated in one senior tournament: the [[Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|Intercontinental Cup]]. (Australia has also participated in the [[World Junior Baseball Championship]] and the [[World Youth Baseball Championship]], both of which are also included in the same category for the IBAF rankings.)<ref name="ibaf world ranking notes"/>

==== Intercontinental Cup ====
Australia is one of five nations to have won the [[Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|Intercontinental Cup]], winning the [[1999 Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|1999]] tournament by beating [[Cuba national baseball team|Cuba]] 4<U+2013>3 in [[extra innings]] in front of a home crowd in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]].<ref name="bjarkman ic1999">[[#refBjarkman|Bjarkman 2005]] pp.455<U+2013>6</ref> It was the first time Australia had won an international baseball tournament, and through 2009 the only win outside of the [[Oceania Baseball Championship]]. The team enjoyed several individual successes as well:<ref name="1999 ic cup">{{cite web | url=http://home.wanadoo.nl/hwede/stats99/ic99/index.html | title=XIV Intercontinental Cup | publisher=Harry Wedemeijer | accessdate=31 August 2009}}</ref>
* [[Dave Nilsson]] named tournament [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]], to go along with leading the tournament for [[run batted in|runs batted in]] (12) and being named in the tournament [[all-star#sport|all-star]] team (as [[catcher]])
* [[Shane Bennett]] led the tournament pitching with the best [[win (baseball)|win]]-[[loss (baseball)|loss]] record (3-0)
* [[Adam Burton]] led the tournament batting with the most [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] (9)
* [[Michael Moyle]] shared the lead in the tournament with [[Oscar Macias]] (Cuba), with the most [[home run]]s (3)
* two other Australians were selected along with Dave Nilsson in the all-star team: [[Adrian Meagher]] (right-handed [[pitcher]]) and [[Michael Moyle]] ([[designated hitter]])

It was only the third time Cuba had been beaten in the gold medal match in the tournament's history, having reached the tournament decider every time they have participated. Australia also shares another honour with Cuba: of the nine nations to have hosted the tournament, only Australia and Cuba have won as hosts, combining for five tournament wins from five times hosted. (Cuba in [[1979 Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|1979]], [[1987 Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|1987]], [[1995 Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|1995]] and [[2002 Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|2002]], Australia in 1999.)<ref name="bjarkman ic">[[#refBjarkman|Bjarkman 2005]] pp.446<U+2013>57</ref>

Australia first participated in the tournament at the [[1981 Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|1981 Intercontinental Cup]], managing only one win out of their seven games, finishing 8th.<ref name="bjarkman ic1981">[[#refBjarkman|Bjarkman 2005]] pp.449<U+2013>50</ref> Missing the [[1983 Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|1983 Intercontinental Cup]], they returned in [[1985 Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|1985]] to repeat their previous performance: 1 win, 8th place finish.<ref name="bjarkman ic1985">[[#refBjarkman|Bjarkman 2005]] pp.450<U+2013>51</ref> They would not reappear at the tournament until [[1993 Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|1993]] where they improved to a 5<U+2013>4 record to finish in 6th position.<ref name="bjarkman ic1993">[[#refBjarkman|Bjarkman 2005]] pp.453<U+2013>4</ref>
Australia's first medal performance at the Intercontinental Cup (and their first medal at a world tournament) was at the [[1997 Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|1997]] tournament. In their best performance through the preliminary round, they put together a 6<U+2013>1 record losing only to eventual silver-medalists Cuba, and beating eventual gold-medalists [[Japan national baseball team|Japan]]. They lost to Japan in the semi-final, but beat the [[United States national baseball team|United States]] for the second time in the tournament to secure the bronze.<ref name="bjarkman ic1997">[[#refBjarkman|Bjarkman 2005]] pp.455</ref>

Australia also competed in the most recent tournament in [[2006 Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|2006]]. There they finished in 5th position, compiling a 3<U+2013>4 record. This is likely to be the last edition of the tournament for the forseeable future.<ref name="ibaf world ranking notes"/>

=== Continental tournaments ===
Australia is the second of only two nations to have participated in [[International Baseball Federation|IBAF]]-sanctioned continental tournaments: the [[Asian Baseball Championship]] between 1971<U+2013>1993, and the [[Oceania Baseball Championship]] since 2003. The first nation to achieve this was [[Guam national baseball team|Guam]], who competed in the Asian tournament within the same timeframe as Australia, though they were involved in the first Oceania tournament in 1999.<ref name="bjarkman continental champs">[[#refBjarkman|Bjarkman 2005]], pp.457<U+2013>83</ref>

==== Asian Baseball Championship ====
Australia is one of thirteen nations to have participated in the [[Asian Baseball Championship]] since the tournament was first held in [[1954 Asian Baseball Championship|1954]]. The last time they contested the championship was in [[1993 Asian Baseball Championship|1993]], as a result of joining the newly formed [[Baseball Confederation of Oceania]]. Though their best result was a bronze medal in the [[1975 Asian Baseball Championship|1975]], the only teams to consistently finish ahead of Australia were [[Japan national baseball team|Japan]], [[South Korea national baseball team|South Korea]] and [[Chinese Taipei national baseball team|Chinese Taipei]]<U+2014>the top three teams in Asia, and all in the top five in the world.<ref name="bjarkman asia champs">[[#refBjarkman|Bjarkman 2005]], pp.477<U+2013>8</ref>

==== Oceania Baseball Championship ====
Though scheduled to participate on three separate occasions, Australia has only contested the [[Oceania Baseball Championship]] once in [[2003 Oceania Baseball Championship|2003]].

Held during late April of 2003, Australia won its first continental championship, beating hosts Guam {{nowrap|12<U+2013>1}}, {{nowrap|12<U+2013>1}} and {{nowrap|5<U+2013>1}} to win the best of five series three games to one.
