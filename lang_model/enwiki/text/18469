The '''Puerto Hondo Stream Salamander''', ''Ambystoma ordinarium,'' is a [[Mole salamander]] from the [[Cordillera Volc<U+00E1>nica]] within the [[Mexican state]] of [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]]. 

== Distribution and habitat ==
''A. ordinarium''  are only found at [[Puerto Hondo]], in a small stream four miles west of [[El Mirador]], and at [[Puerto Garnica]], in another small stream nearby with dark, cold waters and a temperature of 12.4 C. These streams are high in the mountains, and lay at elevations of 9000 and 9400 feet respectively. [[Larvae]] and [[Neoteny|Neotenes]] have been found swimming against the current of the streams, at depths of 5-12 inches.  Terrestrial adults remain near stream banks, and are often found side-by-side with gilled adults, but can also be found under debris in [[pine]] and [[fir]] forests up to 30 meters away from streams. <ref name=AD>Alavarado-Diaz, J., Garcia-Garrido, P., and Suazo-Ortu<U+00F1>o, I.

The Southwestern Naturalist, 28(1), 100-102. cited at [http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ambystoma&where-species=ordinarium]</ref>

== Description ==
''A. ordinarium'' [[larvae]] and [[neonates]] have sparse, evenly distributed [[melanophores]] and rows of light silver-yellow specks.  Larvae have well-developed [[fin]]s, small but bushy [[gill]]s, and 16-24 gill rakers (average, 18.8) on their third gill arch. Larvae reach a maximum size of 100 mm SVL and 191 mm total length.  <ref name=Anderson>Anderson, J. D. (1975). ''Ambystoma ordinarium.'' Catalogue of American Amphibians and Reptiles.

At sexual maturity, these salamanders measure between 70 and 75 mm SVL.  Terrestrial adults reach a maximum size of 86 mm SVL.  They have narrow heads, and 16-24 [[tooth-rakers]] on the 3rd arch. Adults generally have uniform dark or black coloring on their backs, but some may be mottled and others may retain larval coloration.  <ref name=A&W/> <ref name=Shaffer>Shaffer, H. B. (1984).

== Life cycle, activity, and diet ==
''A. ordinarium''  live about two years <ref>[http://www.demogr.mpg.de/longevityrecords/0403.htm J.K., 1975. Longevity of reptiles and amphibians in N. American collections as of 1 November, 1975. Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles, Miscellaneous Publications, Herpetological Circular 6:1-32.]</ref>

The salamander has a prolonged breeding season and may breed throughout the year  <ref name=A&W/>. Average of 109 egg are laid alone or in 2-5 egg clusters on the underside of root, branches and rock, hanging free in the current.  Eggs are pigmented, measure 9.9 mm, and encased in three capsules including a thick outer capsule.  <ref name=A&W/>

New hatchling have fully developed fins, and both larvae and adult walk on the bottom more than they swim  <ref name=A&W/>. 

They are [[diurnal]], hiding under cover of stream bank or under log early in the day and come out by late morning <ref name=A&W/>

Terrestrial prey include [[grasshoppers]], [[ants]], [[leafhoppers]], [[scuds]], [[earthworms]], and [[nematodes]].  Acquatic prey include aquatic insect larvae such as [[caddisfly]] larvae, small aquatic [[beetles]], and [[clams]]

== Threat and status ==
A. ordinarium are able to live in cleared [[pastures]] and watering holes, so the decline of forests does not pose an immediate threat. 
Fragmentation of their habit due to human development and the [[desiccation]] of streams is the biggest threat to the species, which is protected in Mexico. <ref name=AD/><ref>IUCN, Conservation International, and NatureServe. 2006.

== Classification controversy ==

It has been suggested that this is the same species as the [[Lake Patzcuaro Salamander]], ''Ambystoma dumerilii,'' based on genetic analysis, but their habitats have been isolated for 7-10 million years <ref> Brandon, R.A., "Natural History of the Axolotl." In '''Developmental Biology of the Axolotl.,''' Ed. J.B. Armstrong and G.M Malacinski. Oxford University Press, 1989.</ref> ''Ambystoma dumerilii'' is also wholly neotenic, while ''Ambystoma ordinarium'' is variable but mostly terrestrial.
