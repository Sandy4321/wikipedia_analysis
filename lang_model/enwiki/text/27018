'''Korean Air Lines Flight 007''' ('''KAL 007''', '''KE 007'''<ref group="Notes">KAL 007 was used by air traffic control, while the public flight booking system used KE 007</ref>) was a [[Korean Air|Korean Air Lines]] civilian [[airliner]] that was shot down by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[interceptor aircraft|jet interceptors]] on September 1, 1983 over the [[Sea of Japan]], just west of [[Sakhalin]] island over prohibited Soviet airspace.  All 269 passengers and crew aboard were killed, including [[Larry McDonald|Lawrence McDonald]], a sitting member of the [[United States Congress]].  The aircraft was en route from [[New York City]] via [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] to [[Seoul]], when it strayed into prohibited Soviet [[prohibited airspace|airspace]] because of a navigational error.

The Soviet Union initially denied knowledge of the incident,<ref>Young & Launer, pp. xiii,47</ref> but later admitted shooting the aircraft down, claiming that it was on a spy mission.<ref name="Sputnik" />  The [[Politburo]] believed it was a deliberate provocation by the [[United States]],<ref>Pearson, p. 145</ref> to test the U.S.S.R.'s military preparedness, or even [[Casus belli|to provoke a war]].  The United States accused the Soviet Union of obstructing search and rescue operations.<ref>Congressional Record, Sept. 20, 1983,pp. S12462-S12464</ref> Furthermore, the Soviet military suppressed evidence sought by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) investigation, notably the [[flight data recorder]]s,<ref>Soviet news magazine, Izvestia #228, October 16, 1992</ref> which were eventually released nine years later after a change of government.<ref name="tapes"/>

The incident was one of the tensest moments of the [[Cold War]], and resulted in an escalation of [[anti-communism|anti-Soviet]] sentiment, particularly in the United States.  The opposing points of view on the incident were never fully resolved; consequently, several groups continue to dispute official reports and offer alternate theories of the event.  The subsequent release of transcripts and flight recorders by the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] has addressed some details.

As a result of the incident, the United States altered tracking procedures for aircraft departing Alaska, while the interface of the autopilot used on airliners was redesigned to make it more failsafe.<ref name="NASA"/>  President [[Ronald Reagan]] ordered the U.S. military to make the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) available for civilian use so that navigational errors like that of KAL 007 could be averted in the future.

==Details of the flight==
Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was a commercial [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-230B]]
(Serial Number CN20559/186, registration: HL7442, formerly D-ABYH<ref>Kilroy</ref> operated by [[Condor Airlines]]) flying from [[New York City]], [[United States]] to [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. The aircraft departed Gate 15, 35 minutes behind its scheduled departure time of 23:50 [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] on August 30, 1983 (03:50 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]], August 31). Carrying 246 passengers and 23 crew members,<ref name="crew" group="Notes">3 crew, 20 cabin crew and 6 [[Deadheading (aviation)|deadheading]] crew (ICAO 93, Sect. 1.3, p. 6)</ref><ref name="Johnson-6">Johnson, p. 6</ref> the aircraft took off from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]. After refueling at [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport|Anchorage International Airport]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], the aircraft, piloted on this leg of the journey by Captain Chun Byung-in,<ref name="Doerner-5">Doerner, p. 5</ref> departed for Seoul at 13:00 [[UTC]] (4:00 AM Alaska Time) on August 31, 1983.

The aircrew, 6 of whom were [[Deadheading (aviation)|deadheading]] crew, consisted of 14 women and 12 men.  Twelve passengers occupied the upper deck first class, while in business almost all of 24 seats were taken; in economy class, approximately 80 seats did not contain passengers. There were 22 children under the age of 12 aboard.  [[United States Congress|U.S. congressman]] [[Larry McDonald|Lawrence McDonald]] from Georgia, who at the time was also the second president of the conservative [[John Birch Society]], was on the flight.  One hundred thirty passengers planned to connect to other destinations such as [[Tokyo]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Taiwan]].<ref name="Doerner-4">Doerner, pg4</ref>  Senator [[Jesse Helms]] of North Carolina, Senator [[Steve Symms|Steven Symms]] of Idaho, and Representative [[Carroll Hubbard|Carroll J. Hubbard]], Jr. of Kentucky were aboard sister flight KAL 015, which flew 15 minutes behind KAL 007; they were headed to Seoul, Korea in order to attend the ceremonies for the 30 year anniversary of the U.S.-Korea Mutual Defense Treaty.

===Flight deviation from assigned route===
[[Image:KA Flight 007.gif|thumb|360px|CIA map showing divergence of planned (dotted line) and actual flight paths]]
After taking off from Anchorage, the aircraft turned left, seeking its assigned ''Jet Route 501'' (J501), which would take it over the navigational beacon at [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]].  Here, the aircraft would enter the northernmost of five {{convert|50|mi|km|sing=on}} wide [[Airway (aviation)|airways]], known as the NOPAC (North Pacific) routes, that bridge the Alaskan and Japanese coasts.  KAL 007's particular airway, R-20 ("[[NATO phonetic alphabet|Romeo]] 20"), passes just {{convert|17.5|mi|km}} from Soviet airspace off the [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] coast.

The navigation systems installed in commercial aircraft at the time could operate in two different modes,<ref group="Notes">Note that [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] was not available at the time.</ref> each of which was required during different phases of the flight: [[inertial navigation]] (<small>INS</small>) mode, where the aircraft follows a set of pre-programmed [[waypoint]]s, and <small>HEADING</small> mode, where the [[autopilot]] flies an aircraft along a constant magnetic [[Course (navigation)|heading]].<ref group="Notes"><small>INS</small> mode, while accurate to within a mile, is not accurate enough for take-off and landing.  <small>HEADING</small> mode is typically used during take-off and landing, as runways are by convention aligned on a magnetic heading. (Degani, 2001)</ref>

The Anchorage [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] beacon was not operational because of maintenance.<ref>Rosenthal, pg70</ref>  The crew received a [[NOTAM]] (Notice to Airmen) of this fact, which was not seen as a problem as the captain could still check his position at the next VOR beacon at Bethel, {{convert|346|mi|km}} away.  However the aircraft had to navigate on a magnetic heading to the Bethel beacon, before it could start using <small>INS</small> mode to follow the waypoints comprising route ''Romeo-20'' around the coast of the U.S.S.R. to Seoul.  Since this leg was undertaken in the dark, [[pilotage]] could not assist the crew in navigating the route.

At about 10 minutes after take-off, KAL 007, flying on a heading of 245 degrees, began to deviate to the right (north) of its assigned route to Bethel; it would continue to fly on this constant heading for the next five and a half hours.<ref>Daniloff, p. 304</ref>

[[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) [[Flight simulator|simulation]] and analysis of the [[flight data recorder]] determined that this deviation was probably caused by the aircraft's navigation system operating in <small>HEADING</small> mode, after the point that it should have switched to <small>INS</small> mode.<ref name="NASA" /><ref>Milde, p53</ref>  According to the ICAO, the autopilot was not operating in <small>INS</small> mode for one of two reasons.  Either the crew did not switch the autopilot to <small>INS</small> mode (shortly after Cairn Mountain) or they selected the <small>INS</small> mode, but it did not activate as the aircraft had already deviated off track by more than the {{convert|7.5|nmi|km}} tolerance permitted by the [[inertial navigation]] computer.  In both scenarios, the autopilot remained in <small>HEADING</small> mode, and the problem was not detected by the crew.<ref name="NASA" />

At 28 minutes after take-off, civilian radar at [[Kenai Peninsula|Kenai]], on the eastern shore of [[Cook Inlet]] and with radar coverage {{Convert|175|mi|km}} west of Anchorage, tracked KAL 007 {{Convert|5.6|mi|km}} north of where it should have been.<ref name="Pearson" />

When KAL 007 did not reach Bethel at 50 minutes after takeoff, military radar at [[King Salmon, Alaska]], tracked KAL 007 at {{Convert|12.6|nmi|km}} north of where it should have been. However, there is no evidence to indicate that civil air traffic controllers or military radar personnel at [[Elmendorf Air Force Base]] (who were in a position to receive the King Salmon radar output), were aware of KAL 007's deviation in real-time, and therefore able to warn the aircraft.  It had exceeded its permissible leeway of deviation sixfold, {{convert|2|nmi|km}} of error being the maximum expected drift from course if the inertial navigation system was activated.<ref name="Pearson">Pearson (1987), pg40</ref>

KAL 007's divergence prevented the aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range [[very high frequency]] radio (VHF).  It therefore requested KAL 015, also ''en route'' to Seoul, to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf.<ref name="Wyler">{{cite court |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/928/928.F2d.1167.86-5515.86-5400.86-5524.86-5562.86-5596.html |litigants=Fred WYLER, Individually and as a Personal Representative of the Estate of William Paul Wyler, Deceased, for the Benefit of Himself and Helen C. Wyler, et al., Appellants v Korean Air Lines Compnay, Ltd., ''et al'' |accessdate=2009-02-11 |date=1991-04-03 |court=United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit}}</ref> KAL 007 requested KAL 015 to relay its position three times in total. At 14:43 GMT, KAL 007 directly transmitted a change of [[estimated time of arrival]] for its next waypoint, NEEVA, to the international [[flight service station]] at Anchorage,<ref>Kleiner, ''Korea, a Century of Change''</ref> but it did so over the longer range [[high frequency]] radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions are able to carry a longer distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]] and [[Noise (radio)|static]]; VHF are clearer with less interference, and preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications to be able to transmit their position directly did not alert the pilots of KAL 007 of their ever increasing divergence<ref name="Pearson" /> and was not considered unusual by air traffic controllers.<ref name="Wyler" />  Halfway between Bethel and waypoint NABIE, KAL 007 passed through the southern portion of the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|North American Air Defense]] buffer zone. This zone, monitored intensively by [[National Security Agency]] assets, is north of ''Romeo 20'' and off-limits to civilian aircraft.

KAL 007 continued its journey, ever increasing its deviation<U+2014>{{convert|60|nmi|km}} off course at waypoint NABIE, {{Convert|100|nmi|km}} off course at waypoint NUKKS, and {{Convert|160|nmi|km}} off course at waypoint NEEVA<U+2014>until it reached the Kamchatka Peninsula.<ref name="ICAO93">ICAO, 1993, p15, Section 2.8.1</ref>

In 1983, [[Cold War]] tensions had escalated because of several factors: These included the United States's [[Strategic Defence Initiative]], its deployment of [[MGM-31 Pershing#Pershing II|Pershing II]] missiles in Europe and in April, FleetEx '83, the largest fleet exercise held to date in the North Pacific.<ref name="Johnson-55">Johnson, p. 55</ref><ref name="Richelson-385"/>  On the Soviet side, [[Operation RYAN]] was expanded.<ref name="Fischer">Fischer, ''A Cold War Conundrum: The 1983 Soviet War Scare''</ref>  [[United States Navy]] [[surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance aircraft]] had repeatedly penetrated Soviet airspace during FleetEx '83, resulting in the dismissal or reprimanding of Soviet military officials who had been unable to shoot them down.<ref name="Fischer" />  Lastly, there was a heightened [[Alert state|alert]] around the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] when KAL 007 was in the vicinity, because of a Soviet missile test that was scheduled for the same day.  The missile test was the reason that a United States Air Force [[Boeing RC-135|RC-135]] reconnaissance aircraft was patrolling off the peninsula.<ref>Schultz, p. 367</ref>

When the Korean jetliner was about {{Convert|80|mi|km}} from the Kamchatka coast, four [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23 fighters]] were scrambled to intercept the fast and high-flying Boeing 747.<ref name="NASA">Degani, 2001</ref>  At 15:51 GMT, according to Soviet sources,<ref name="Pearson" /> KAL 007 entered the [[restricted airspace]] of Kamchatka Peninsula. The buffer zone extended {{convert|200|km|mi}} from Kamchatka's coast and is known as a [[Flight Information Region]] (FIR). The {{convert|100|km|mi}} radius of the buffer zone nearest to Soviet territory had the additional designation of [[prohibited airspace]].  Significant command and control problems were experienced trying to vector the military jets onto the Boeing before they ran out of fuel. In addition, pursuit was made more difficult, according to Soviet Air Force Captain [[Alexander Zuyev]], who [[defection|defected]] to the West in 1989, because Arctic gales had knocked out Soviet radar ten days before.<ref>CBS' "60 Minutes" interview, Jan. 3, 1983</ref>  The unidentified jetliner therefore crossed over the Kamchatka Peninsula back into international airspace over the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] without being intercepted.

[[Image:Su-15.png|thumb|left|Soviet [[Sukhoi Su-15]] "Flagon" [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]].]]
[[Soviet Air Defence Forces|Soviet Air Defence Force]] units that had been tracking the Korean aircraft for more than an hour while it entered and left Soviet airspace now classified the aircraft as a military target when it re-entered their airspace over [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]].<ref name="NASA" />  After a protracted [[ground-controlled interception]], three [[Sukhoi Su-15|Su-15 ''Flagon'']] fighters from nearby [[Dolinsk-Sokol]] airbase and a MiG-23<ref>{{cite news |pages=15 |title=Jean Kirkpatrick's Address to the United Nations |publisher=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=2009-02-07 |date=2983-09-07}}</ref>from [[Smirnykh (air base)|Smirnykh Air Base]] managed to make visual contact with the Boeing.  The pilot of the lead Su-15 fighter fired [[warning shot]]s, but recalled later in 1991:<ref name="Illesh-Eng">Illesh, ''The Mystery of the KAL-007''</ref>
{{cquote|I fired four bursts, more than 200 rounds. For all the good it did. After all, I was loaded with [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armour piercing shells]], not [[tracer ammunition|incendiary shells]]. It's doubtful whether anyone could see them...}}

At this point, KAL 007 contacted [[Tokyo Area Control Center|Tokyo air traffic control]] requesting clearance to ascend to a higher [[flight level]] for reasons of fuel economy; the requested was granted, so the Boeing started to climb, gradually slowing as it exchanged speed for altitude.  The decrease in speed caused the pursuing fighter to overshoot the Boeing, an action that was interpreted by the Soviet pilot as an evasive maneuver.  The order to shoot KAL 007 down was given as it was about to leave Soviet airspace for the second time.  At around 18:26 GMT, under pressure from ground controllers not to let the aircraft escape into international airspace, the lead fighter was able to move back into a position where it could fire two [[Kaliningrad K-8]] [[air-to-air missile]]s at the intruder.<ref name="Maier">Maier, ''KAL 007 Mystery''</ref>

====Soviet pilot's recollection of shootdown====
In a 1991 interview with [[Izvestia]], Major Gennadie Osipovich, pilot of the Su-15 interceptor that shot the Boeing down, spoke about his recollections of the events leading up to the shootdown. He recalled telling ground controllers that, contrary to official Soviet statements at the time, there were blinking lights, which he believed should have alerted them to the fact that the plane was a civilian transport. He also stated that he knew it was a civilian Boeing from the double rows of windows:<ref>Witkin, ''Soviet Pilot Insists Downed Korean Jet Was Spy Plane''</ref> "I saw two rows of windows and knew that this was a Boeing. I knew this was a civilian plane. But for me this meant nothing. It is easy to turn a civilian type of plane into one for military use..."   Osipovich also stated that, in the pressure of the moment, he did not provide a full description of the intruder to Soviet ground controllers: "I did not tell the ground that it was a Boeing-type plane," he recalled, "They did not ask me."<ref name="Illesh-Eng" /><ref name="nytimes-Osipovich">Gordon, ''Ex-Soviet Pilot Still Insists KAL 007 Was Spying''</ref>

This omission of the identity of KAL 007 as a Boeing by Osipovich is evident in the communications subsequently released by the [[Russian Federation]] with the combat controller, Lt. Col. Titovnin (see [[#Flight timeline and transcripts|Flight timeline and transcripts]]).

Commenting on the moment that KAL 007 slowed as it ascended from [[flight level]] 330 to flight level 350, and then on his maneuvering for missile launch, Osipovich said: 
<blockquote>
"They [KAL 007] quickly lowered their speed.  They were flying at 400 kilometers per hour.  My speed was more than 400.  I was simply unable to fly slower.  In my opinion, the intruder's intentions were plain.  If I did not want to go into a [[Stall (flight)|stall]], I would be forced to overshoot them.  That's exactly what happened.  We had already flown over the island [Sakhalin].  It is narrow at that point, the target was about to get away...Then the ground [controller] gave the command: 'Destroy the target...!'  That was easy to say.  But how?  With shells?!  I had already expended 243 rounds.  Ram it?  I had always thought of that as poor taste.  Ramming is the last resort.  Just in case, I had already completed my turn and was coming down on top of him.  Then, I had an idea.  I dropped below him about 2,000 meters... afterburners.  Switched on the missiles and brought the nose up sharply.  Success!  I have a [[missile lock-on|lock on]]."<ref>Izvestia, 1991</ref>
</blockquote>

====Post-attack flight====
[[Image:Chart8.jpg|ICAO chart of KAL 007's flight for the 144&nbsp;seconds after missile attack.|right|thumb]] 
At the time of the attack, the plane had been cruising at an altitude of about {{convert|35000|ft|m}}.  Tapes recovered from the airliner's [[cockpit voice recorder]] indicate that the crew were unaware that they were off course and violating Soviet airspace. Immediately after missile detonation, the airliner began a 113-second arc upward, because of a damaged cross over cable between the left inboard and right outboard elevators.<ref name="ICAO93-55">ICAO '93, p. 55</ref> At the apex of the arc, at altitude {{convert|38250|ft|m}},<ref name="ICAO93-55" /> either the pilot was able to turn off the autopilot or the autopilot tripped, at 18:26:46 GMT,<ref name="ICAO93-54">ICAO '93, p. 54</ref> and the plane began to descend to {{convert|35000|ft|m}}. At this point forward acceleration, velocity and altitude had all returned to their pre-attack states.  The Boeing did not break up, explode or plummet immediately after the attack; it continued its gradual descent for four minutes, then leveled off at 16,424&nbsp;feet (18:30<U+2013>31 GMT), continuing at this altitude for almost five more minutes (18:35 GMT).  The last [[cockpit voice recorder]] entry occurred at 18:27:46 while in this phase of the descent. At 18:28 GMT, the aircraft was reported turning to the north.<ref name="ICAO93-132">ICAO'93, Information Paper No. 1. p. 132,</ref> ICAO analysis concluded that the flight crew "retained limited control" of the aircraft.<ref>ICAO '93, sect. 3.38, p. 61</ref>  Finally, the aircraft began to descend in spirals {{convert|2.6|mi|km}} from Moneron Island before crashing, killing all 269 on board.<ref group="Notes">"The last plotted radar position of the target was 18:35 hours at 5,000&nbsp;meters." (ICAO '93, p. 53, para. 2.15.8)</ref> The aircraft was last seen visually by Osipovich, "somehow descending slowly" over Moneron Island.

According to an independent air accident investigator, "Emergency procedures call for saying [[Mayday (distress signal)|'Mayday']] three times, followed by other information about the nature of the emergency, Brenner noted. The cockpit crew should have continued broadcasting until the last possible moment to help lead rescuers to the plane's location. But they did not."<ref>Pearson, p. 78</ref>  The aircraft disappeared off long range military radar at [[Wakkanai, Hokkaid<U+014D>|Wakkanai]], Japan at a height of {{convert|1000|ft|m}}.<ref>Johnson, p. 30</ref>

KAL 007 was probably attacked in international airspace, with a 1993 Russian report listing the location of the missile firing outside its territory at {{coord|46|46|27|N|141|32|48|E |type:landmark }},<ref name="Fischer" /><ref>Oberg, ''KAL 007: The Real Story''</ref> although the intercepting pilot stated otherwise in a subsequent interview.  Initial reports that the airliner had been forced to land on Sakhalin were soon proved false.  A Japanese fisherman later reported seeing two flashes of light and hearing an explosion, as well as smelling aviation fuel.<ref>Daniloff, p. 300</ref>

====Missile damage to plane====
[[Image:Time magazine.jpg|1983 Time Magazine cover with an inaccurate contemporary portrayal of missile impact and damage.|upright|thumb]]
The following damage to the aircraft was determined by the ICAO from its analysis of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder:

* '''The Hydraulics:''' KAL 007 had four [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] hydraulic systems of which systems one, two, and three were damaged or destroyed. There was no evidence of damage to system four.<ref name="ICAO93-54" /> The hydraulics provided actuation for all the primary flight controls; all secondary flight controls (except [[Krueger flaps|leading edge Krueger flaps]]); and landing gear retraction, extension, gear steering, and wheel braking. System four also had a third electrical power source. Each primary flight control axis received power from all four hydraulic systems.<ref>Norris and Wagner, ''Boeing''</ref> Upon missile detonation, the jumbo jet began to experience oscillations (yawing) as the dual channel yaw damper was damaged. Yawing would not have occurred if hydraulic systems one or two were fully operational. The result is that the control column does not thrust forward upon impact (it should have done so as the plane was on autopilot) to bring down the plane to its former altitude of 35,000&nbsp;feet. This failure of the autopilot to correct the rise in altitude indicates that hydraulic system number three, which operates the autopilot actuator, a system controlling the plane's elevators, was damaged or out. KAL 007's airspeed and acceleration rate both began to decrease as the plane began to climb. At twenty seconds after missile detonation a click was heard in the cabin, which is identified as the "automatic pilot disconnect warning" sound. Either the pilot or co-pilot had disconnected the autopilot and was manually thrusting the control column forward in order to bring the plane lower. Though the autopilot had been turned off, manual mode did not begin functioning for another twenty seconds. This failure of the manual system to engage upon command indicates failure in hydraulic systems one and two. With wing flaps up, "control was reduced to the right inboard aileron and the innermost of spoiler section of each side."<ref name="ICAO93-54" />
* '''Left Wing:''' Contrary to Major Osipovich's statement in 1991 that he had taken off half of KAL 007's left wing,<ref name="Illesh-Eng" /> ICAO analysis found that the wing was intact: "The interceptor pilot stated that the first missile hit near the tail, while the second missile took off half the left wing of the aircraft... The interceptor's pilot's statement that the second missile took off half of the left wing was probably incorrect. The missiles were fired with a two-second interval and would have detonated at an equal interval. The first detonated at 18:26:02 hours. The last radio transmissions from KE007 to Tokyo Radio were between 18:26:57 and 18:27:15 hours using HF [high frequency]. The HF 1 radio aerial of the aircraft was positioned in the left wing tip suggesting that the left wing tip was intact at this time. Also, the aircraft's maneuvers after the attack did not indicate extensive damage to the left wing."<ref name="ICAO93-39">ICAO '93, p39</ref>
* '''Engines:''' The co-pilot reported to Captain Chun twice during the flight after the missile's detonation, "Engines normal, sir."<ref name="safety">{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/investigation/cvr/transcripts/cvr_ke007.php |title=CVR transcript Korean Air Flight 007 - 31 AUG 1983 |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=2009-01-22 |date=2004-10-16}}</ref>
* '''Tail Section:''' The first missile was radar-controlled and [[Proximity fuze|proximity-fused]], and detonated {{convert|50|m|ft}} behind the aircraft. Sending fragments forward, it either severed or unraveled the crossover cable from the left inboard elevator to the right elevator.<ref name="ICAO93-55" />  This, with damage to one of the four hydraulic systems, caused KAL 007 to ascend from {{convert|35000|ft|m}} to {{convert|38250|ft|m}}, at which point the autopilot was disengaged.
* '''Fuselage:''' Tiny shrapnel from the proximity-fused [[air-to-air missile]] that detonated {{convert|50|m|ft}} behind the aircraft, punctured the fuselage and caused [[uncontrolled decompression|rapid decompression]] of the pressurised cabin. The interval of 11 seconds between the sound of missile detonation picked up by the cockpit voice recorder and the sound of the alarm sounding in the cockpit enabled ICAO analysts to determine that the total size of the tiny ruptures to the pressurized fuselage was {{convert|1.75|ft2|m2}}.  (The ICAO determined this from the 11 seconds that it took for the air to rush out of the cabin before the alarm was set off.<ref name="ICAO93-93">ICAO '93, Information Paper 1, p. 93</ref>)

==Search and rescue==
As a result of Cold War tensions, the search and rescue operations of the Soviet Union were not co-ordinated with those of the United States, South Korea and Japan.  Consequently no information was shared, and each side endeavoured to harass or obtain evidence to implicate the other.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XvorAAAAMAAJ|title=Coping with Crises: The Management of Disasters, Riots, and Terrorism|author=Uriel Rosenthal, Michael T.

The Soviets did not acknowlege shooting down the aircraft until 6 September.<ref name="Oberdorfer" />  [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] and [[Chief of the General Staff (Russia)|Chief of General Staff]], [[Nikolai Ogarkov]], 9 days after the shootdown, denied knowledge of where KAL 007 had gone down, "We could not give the precise answer about the spot where it [KAL 007] fell because we ourselves did not know the spot in the first place."<ref>{{cite speech |author=Marshal [[Nikolai Ogarkov]] |date=1983-09-09 |location=Moscow |title=Press conference |accessdate= |url=}}</ref> But nine years after, the Russian Federation handed over transcripts of Soviet military communications that showed that at least two documented search and rescue (SAR) missions were ordered to the last Soviet verified location of the descending jumbo jet, over [[Moneron Island]]: The first search was ordered from [[Smirnykh (air base)|Smirnykh Air Base]] in central Sakhalin at 18:47 GMT, 9 minutes after KAL 007 had disappeared from Sovet radar screens, and brought rescue helicopters and [[Soviet Border Troops|KGB]] boats to the area.<ref>ICAO '93, Information Paper 1, p. 93</ref> The second search was ordered 8 minutes later by the Deputy Commander of the [[Far Eastern Military District]], Gen. Strogov, and involved  civilian trawlers that were in the area around Moneron. "The border guards. What ships do we now have near Moneron Island, if they are civilians, send [them] there immediately."<ref name="ICAO9596">ICAO, '93, Information Paper No. 1., pp. 95-96</ref> Moneron is just {{convert|4.5|mi|km}} long and {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} wide, located {{convert|24|mi|km}} due west of Sakhalin Island at {{coord|46|15|N|141|14|E |region:RU_type:isle }}; it is the only land mass in the whole Tatar Straits.

==Human remains==
===Surface finds===
[[Image:Shoes.jpg|Passengers' footwear, retrieved by Soviets from the crash site|upright|thumb]]
No body parts were recovered by the Russians from the surface of the sea in their own territorial waters, though they would later turn over clothes and shoes to a joint US-Japanese delegation to [[Nevelsk]] on Sakhalin. Nothing was found by the joint US-Japanese-South Korean search and rescue/salvage operations in international waters at the designated crash site or within the {{Convert|225|nmi2|km2}} search area.<ref>Brun, pp. 143-144</ref>

===Hokkaido finds===
Eight days after the shootdown, human remains appeared on the north shore of [[Hokkaido]], Japan. Hokkaido is located about {{convert|30|mi|km}} below the southern tip of Sakhalin across the [[La P<U+00E9>rouse Strait|Soya Strait]] (the southern tip of Sakhalin is {{convert|35|mi|km}} from [[Moneron Island]] which lies to the west of Sakhalin).  The ICAO concluded that these objects were carried from Russian waters to the Japanese shores of Hokkaido by the southerly current west of Sakhalin Island. All currents of the [[Tsushima Strait]] relevant to Moneron Island flow to the north, except this southerly current between Moneron Island and Sakhalin Island.<ref>Kantakov and Shevchenko, ''In situ observations of Tsushima and West Sakhalin currents near La Perouse (Soya) Strait''</ref> These human remains, including body parts, tissues, and two partial torsos, totaled 13 in number. All were unidentifiable, but one partial torso was that of a Caucasian woman as indicated by auburn hair on a partial skull, and one partial body was of an Asian child (with glass imbedded).  There was no luggage recovered. Of the non human remains that the Japanese recovered were various items including dentures, newspapers, seats, books, 8 "KAL" paper cups, shoes, sandals, and sneakers, a camera case, a "please fasten seat belt" sign, an oxygen mask, a handbag, a bottle of dish washing fluid, several blouses, an identity card belonging to 25 year old passenger Mary Jane Hendrie<ref>Photo [http://www.rescue007.org/mary_jane_hendrie.htm Mary Jane Hendrie]</ref> of [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], and the business card of passenger Kathy Brown-Spier.<ref name="Pearson-235">Pearson, p. 235</ref>  All of these items generally come from the [[Aircraft cabin|passenger cabin]] of an aircraft. There were none of the items found that generally come from the cargo hold of a plane, such as suitcases, packing boxes, industrial machinery, instruments and sports equipment.

===Soviet diver reports===
[[Image:Moneron Island.jpg|thumb|right|[[Moneron Island]]]]
In 1991, Russian newspaper ''[[Izvestia]]'' published a series of interviews with Soviet military personnel who had been involved in [[Marine salvage|salvage]] operations to find and recover parts of the aircraft.<ref name="Illesh-Eng"/>  After three days of searching using [[naval trawler|trawlers]], [[side-scan sonar]] and [[diving bell]]s, the aircraft wreckage was located by Russian searchers at a depth of {{convert|174|m|ft}} near [[Moneron Island]].<ref name="Illesh-Eng"/><ref name="Izvestia-19910521">{{cite news |publisher=[[Izvestia]] |date=1991-05-21 |pages=6 |author=Andrey Illesh |accessdate= |title=?}}</ref>  Since no human remains or luggage were found on the surface in the impact area, the divers expected to find passengers incarcerated in the submerged wreckage of the aircraft on the seabed.  However when they visited the site two weeks after the shootdown, they found that the wreckage was in small pieces: <blockquote>"I had the idea that it would be intact. Well, perhaps a little banged up... The divers would go inside the aircraft and see everything there was to see. In fact it was completely demolished, scattered about like kindling. The largest things we saw were the braces which are especially strong<U+2014>they were about one and a half or two meters long and 50-60 centimeters wide. As for the rest<U+2014>broken into tiny pieces..."<ref name="Illesh-Eng" /></blockquote>  
According to Izvestia, the divers had only 10 encounters with passenger remains (tissues and body parts) in the debris area, including one partial torso.<ref name="WWI">{{cite journal |journal=World Wide Issues |date=1991-02-06 |pages=p. 21 |accessdate= |url=}}</ref>  

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

ICAO also interviewed a number of these divers for its 1993 report: "In addition to the scraps of metal, they observed personal effects, such as clothing, documents and wallets. Although some evidence of human remains was noticed by the divers, they found no bodies."<ref>ICAO '93, Sect. 1.12.4</ref>

==Search for KAL 007 in international waters==
[[Image:Soviet boats stalking.jpg|The fleet tug {{USNS|Narragansett|T-ATF-167|6}} and the Soviet cruiser ''Petropavlovsk'' during salvage operations|right|thumb]]
From early in September until the beginning of November, the U.S. with the Japanese and South Koreans carried out joint [[search and rescue]] and then [[Marine salvage|salvage]] operations. These missions met with interference by the Soviets,<ref>http://sterett.net/public/kal_007_search_ops.htm</ref> in violation of the [[1972 Incident at Sea agreement]], and included [[false flag]] and fake light signals, sending an armed [[Boarding (attack)|boarding]] party to threaten to board a U.S.-chartered Japanese auxiliary vessel (blocked by U.S. warship interposition), interfering with a helicopter coming off the {{USS|Elliot|DD-967|6}}, attempted ramming of rigs used by the South Koreans in their "quadrant" search, hazardous maneuvering of the ''[[Gavril Sarychev]]'' and near collision with the {{USS|Callaghan|DDG-994|6}}, removing U.S. [[sonar]]s, setting false "[[Distress radiobeacon|pingers]]" in deep international waters, sending [[Tupolev Tu-22M|Backfire]] bombers armed with [[Air-to-surface missile|air-to-surface]] nuclear-armed missiles to threaten U.S. naval units, "criss-crossing"  in front of U.S. combatant vessels, cutting and attempted cuttings of moorings of the Japanese auxiliary vessels, particularly the ''Kaiko Maru III'', and [[Fire-control radar|radar]] [[missile lock-on|lock-ons]] by a Soviet {{sclass|Kara|cruiser}}, the ''Petropavlosk'', and a {{sclass|Kashin|destroyer}}, the ''Odarennyy'', targeting U.S. naval vessels. {{USS|Towers|DDG-9|6}}, escorting {{USS|Conserver|ARS-39|6}}, experienced all of the above interference and was involved in a near-collision with the ''Odarennyy''. <ref name="winkler">Winkler, p. 47</ref><ref>Commander of Task Force 71 of U.S. 7th Fleet, stated in his After Action Report (Department of the Navy, Commander, Surface Combat Force Seventh Fleet.

[[Image:After Action Report Map.jpg|U.S. Task Force 71 After action report map of search area in international waters|right|thumb]]
According to the ICAO: "The location of the main wreckage was not determined...the approximate position was {{coord|46|34|N|141|17|E|type:landmark|name=Korean Airlines Flight 007}}, which was in international waters."  This point is about {{convert|41|mi|km}} from [[Moneron Island]], about {{convert|45|mi|km}} from the shore of [[Sakhalin]] and {{convert|33|mi|km}} from the point of attack.<ref>ICAO Report, p. 28</ref>

Rear Admiral Walter T. Piotti Jr, commander of Task Force 71 of [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]], believed the search for KAL 007 in international waters to have been a search in the wrong place and assessed:<ref>After Action Report (Department of the Navy, Commander, Surface Combat Force Seventh Fleet. CTF75/N32:kpm,4730,Ser 011, 15 November,1983)</ref>
{{Quote|"Had TF [task force] 71 been permitted to search without restriction imposed by claimed territorial waters, the aircraft stood a good chance of having been found.  No wreckage of KAL 007 was found. However, the operation established, with a 95% or above [[confidence interval|confidence level]], that the wreckage, or any significant portion of the aircraft, does not lie within the probability area outside the {{convert|12|nmi|km}} area claimed by the Soviets as their territorial limit."}}

At a hearing of the ICAO on Sept.15, 1983, J. Lynn Helms, the head of the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], stated:<ref>Congressional Record, Sept. 20, 1983,pp. S12462-S12464</ref> "The U.S.S.R. has refused to permit search and rescue units from other countries to enter Soviet territorial waters to search for the remains of KAL 007. Moreover, the Soviet Union has blocked access to the likely crash site and has refused to cooperate with other interested parties, to ensure prompt recovery of all technical equipment, wreckage and other material."

==Political events==
The shootdown happened at a very tense time in U.S.-Soviet relations during the [[Cold War]].  The U.S. adopted a strategy of releasing a substantial amount of hitherto highly classified [[military intelligence|intelligence]] information in order to exploit a major propaganda advantage over the U.S.S.R.<ref>Johnson, pp. 117-121</ref>  [[George P. Schultz|George Schultz]] held a press conference about the incident at 10:45 on September 1, during which he divulged some details of intercepted Soviet communications and denounced the actions of the Soviet Union.<ref name="Daniloff-294">Daniloff, p. 294</ref>  

[[Image:Over the horizon antenna.JPG|thumb|right|Listening post at Wakkanai]]
[[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Yuri Andropov]], on the advice of Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Ustinov]], but against advice of the Foreign Ministry, initially decided not to make any admission of downing the airline, on the premise that no-one would find out or be able to prove otherwise.<ref name="Oberdorfer">Oberdorfer, p. 51</ref>  Consequently the [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] news agency reported twelve hours after the shootdown only that an unidentified aircraft, flying without lights, had been intercepted by Soviet fighters after it violated Soviet airspace over Sakhalin.  The aircraft had allegedly failed to respond to warnings and "continued its flight toward the [[Sea of Japan]]".<ref name="Oberdorfer" /><ref name="Daniloff-294"/>  Some commentators believe that the manner in which the political events were handled by the Soviet government was affected by the failing health of Andropov, who was permanently hospitalised in late September or early October 1983.<ref name="Pry"/>

On September 5, 1983, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] condemned the shooting down of the airplane as the "Korean airline massacre", a "[[crime against humanity]] [that] must never be forgotten" and an "act of barbarism ... [and] inhuman brutality".<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1983/90583a.htm |author=[[Ronald Reagan]] |title=Address to the Nation on the Soviet Attack on a Korean Civilian Airliner |date=1983-09-05 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |publisher=[[United States Government]]}}</ref>  The following day, the U.S. ambassador to the [[United Nations]], [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]], commissioned an audio-visual presentation in the [[United Nations Security Council]], using audio tapes of the Soviet pilots' radio conversations and a map of Flight 007's path in depicting its shooting down.  Following this presentation, TASS acknowledged for the first time that the aircraft had indeed been shot down after warnings were ignored.  The Soviets challenged many of the facts presented by the U.S., and for the first time, mentioned the presence of a USAF [[Boeing RC-135|RC-135]] [[surveillance aircraft]] whose path had crossed that of KAL 007.

On 7 September, Japan and the United States jointly released a transcript of Soviet communications, intercepted by the [[signals intelligence|listening post]] at [[Wakkanai]], to an emergency session of the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>Ball, pp. 42-46</ref> US president Reagan issued a [[Presidential directive|National Security Directive]] stating that the Soviets were not to be let off the hook, and initiating "a major diplomatic effort to keep international and domestic attention focused on the Soviet action."<ref name="Richelson-385">Richelson, p. 385</ref>  The move was seen by the Soviet leadership of confirmation of the West's bad intentions.

A high level U.S.-Soviet [[summit (meeting)|summit]], the first for nearly a year, was scheduled for 8 September 1983 in Madrid.<ref name="Oberdorfer" />  The [[George P. Schultz|Schultz]]-[[Andrei Gromyko|Gromyko]] meeting went ahead, but was overshadowed by the KAL 007 event.<ref name="Oberdorfer" />  It ended acrimoniously, with Schultz stating: "Foreign Minister Gromyko's response to me today was even more unsatisfactory than the response he gave in public yesterday.  I find it totally unacceptable."<ref name="Oberdorfer" />  President Reagan ordered the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) on September 15, 1983 to revoke the licence of [[Aeroflot|Aeroflot Soviet Airlines]] to operate flights to and from the U.S. Aeroflot flights to North America were consequently available only through Canadian and Mexican cities, forcing the Soviet foreign minister to cancel his scheduled trip to the [[United Nations]].  Aeroflot service to the U.S. was not restored until April 29, 1986.<ref>''The Current Digest of the Soviet Press''</ref>

An emergency session of the ICAO was held in Montreal.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1983/91783a.htm |author=[[Ronald Reagan]] |title=Radio Address to the Nation on the Soviet Attack on a Korean Civilian Airliner |date=1983-09-17 |accessdate=2009-01-11 |publisher=[[United States Government]]}}</ref>  On September 12, 1983, the Soviet Union was forced to use its [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto]] to block a [[United Nations Security Council resolution|United Nations resolution]] condemning it for shooting down the aircraft.<ref name="Time1983-09-26"/>

[[Image:UN building.jpg|thumb|left|[[United Nations Headquarters]] in New York]]
Shortly after the Soviet Union shot down KAL 007, legislatures in [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]] denied Soviet aircraft landing rights, in violation of the [[United Nations Charter]] that required the host nation to allow all member countries access to the UN. In reaction, TASS and some at the UN raised the question of whether the U.N. should move its [[United Nations Headquarters|headquarters]] from the United States. Charles Lichenstein, acting US permanent representative to the U.N. under Ambassador Kirkpatrick, responded, "We will put no impediment in your way. The members of the US mission to the United Nations will be down at the dockside waving you a fond farewell as you sail off into the sunset." Administration officials were quick to announce that Lichenstein was speaking only for himself.<ref>Luck, ''Mixed Messages: American Politics and International Organization, 1919-1999'', p. 64</ref>

In the [[Cold War]] context of Operation [[RYAN]], the [[Strategic Defence Initiative]], [[MGM-31 Pershing#Pershing II|Pershing II]] missile deployment in Europe and the upcoming [[Able Archer 83|Exercise Able Archer]], the Soviet Government perceived the incident with the Korean airliner to be a portent of war.<ref name="Pry" />  The Soviet hierarchy took the official line that KAL Flight 007 was on a spy mission, as it "flew deep into Soviet territory for several hundred kilometres, without responding to signals and disobeying the orders of interceptor fighter planes"."<ref name="Sputnik" />  They claimed its purpose was to probe the air defences of highly sensitive Soviet military sites in the Kamchatka Peninsula and [[Sakhalin Island]]".<ref name="Sputnik" />  The Soviet government expressed regret over the loss of life, but offered no apology and did not respond to demands for compensation.<ref name="Johnson-110">Johnson, p. 110</ref>  Instead, the U.S.S.R. blamed the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] for this "criminal, provocative act",<ref name="Sputnik">Sputnik, ''The Truth and Lies about the South Korean Airliner''</ref> and argued that the U.S. case was incredible:<ref name="Sputnik" />
{{Quote|"Today, when all versions have been viewed from all possible angles, when leading specialists, including pilots who have flown Boeings for thousands of hours, have declared that [[Inertial navigation system|three computers]] could not break down all at once, and neither could five [[VHF omnidirectional range|radio transmitters]], there can be no doubt as to the intentions of the intruder plane.  The Soviet pilots who intercepted the aircraft could not have known that it was a civilian plane. It was flying without the navigation lights,<ref group="Notes">Subsequently shown to be incorrect when Soviet communications were released in 1993.</ref> in conditions of poor visibility and did not respond to radio signals."}}

==Investigations==
===NTSB===
Since the aircraft had departed from US soil and US nationals had died in the incident, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) was legally required to investigate.  On the morning of September 1, the NTSB chief in Alaska, James Michelangelo, received an order from the NTSB in Washington at the behest of the State Department requiring all documents relating to the NTSB investigation to be sent to Washington, and notifying him that the State Department would now conduct the investigation.<ref>Pearson, p. 127</ref>  The US State Department, after closing the NTSB investigation on the grounds that it was not an accident, pursued an ICAO investigation instead.  Commentators such as Johnson point out that this action was illegal, and that in deferring the investigation to the ICAO, the Reagan administration effectively precluded any politically or militarily sensitive information from being [[subpoena]]ed that might have embaressed the administration or contradicted its version of events.<ref>Johnson, p. 227</ref>  Unlike the NTSB, ICAO can neither subpoenae persons or documents and is dependent on the governments involved, particularly in this incident, the U.S., the Soviet Union, Japan, and South Korea, to supply evidence voluntarily.

===Initial ICAO investigation (1983)===
ICAO had only one experience of investigation of an air disaster prior to the KAL 007 shootdown. This was the incident of February 21, 1973, when [[Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114]] was shot down by Israeli F-4 jets over the Sinai Peninsula. ICAO convention required the state in whose territory the accident had taken place (the U.S.S.R.) to conduct an investigation together with the country of registration (South Korea), the country whose air traffic control the aircraft was flying under (Japan), as well as the aircraft's manufacturer (Boeing).

The ICAO investigation did not have the authority to compel the states involved to hand over evidence, instead having to rely on what they voluntarily submitted.<ref>Johnson, p. 231</ref>  Consequently, the investigation did not have access to sensitive evidence such as radar data, intercepts, ATC tapes, or the [[Flight Data Recorder]] (FDR) and [[Cockpit Voice Recorder]] (CVR) (whose discovery the U.S.S.R. had kept secret).  A number of simulations were conducted with the assistance of Boeing and [[Litton Industries|Litton]] (the manufacturer of the navigation system).<ref>Johnson, p. 232</ref>

The ICAO released their report December 2, 1983, which concluded that the violation of Soviet airspace was accidental: One of two explanations for the aircraft's deviation was that the [[autopilot]] had remained in <small>HEADING</small> hold instead of [[inertial navigation|<small>INS</small> mode]] after departing [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].  They postulated that this [[Air navigation|inflight navigational error]] was caused by either the crew's failure to select <small>INS</small> mode, or the inertial navigation's not activating when selected, because the aircraft was already too far off track.<ref name="NASA" />  It was determined that the crew did not notice this error or subsequently perform navigational checks, for example using [[OMEGA Navigation System|OMEGA]],<ref name="Luffsey">{{cite web |url=http://testimony.ost.dot.gov/test/pasttest/83test/luffsey1.PDF |date=1983-09-19 |accessdate=2009-02-11 |title=Statement by Walter F. Luffsey, Associate Administrator for Aviation Standards, Before the House Committee on Science and Technology, Subcomittee on Transporation, Aviation and Weather Concerning Navigation Systems}}</ref> that would have revealed that the aircraft was diverging further and further from its assigned route.  This was later deemed to be caused by a "lack of [[situational awareness]] and flight deck coordination".<ref name="ICAO 2" />

The report included a statement by the Soviet Government claiming "no remains of the victims, the instruments or their components or the flight recorders have so far been discovered".<ref>Appendix F, ICAO 83</ref> However, this statement was subsequently shown to be untrue by [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s release in 1993 of a November 1983 [[memorandum|memo]] from [[KGB]] head [[Viktor Chebrikov]] and Defence Minister [[Dmitry Ustinov]] to [[Yuri Andropov]]. This memo stated "In the third decade of October this year the equipment in question (the [[flight data recorder|recorder of in-flight parameters]] and the [[cockpit voice recorder|recorder of voice communications]] by the flight crew with ground air traffic surveillance stations and between themselves) was brought aboard a search vessel and forwarded to [[Moscow]] by air for decoding and translation at the Air Force Scientific Research Institute."<ref>[[Izvestia]] #228, October 16, 1992</ref> The Soviet Government statement would further be contradicted by Soviet civilian divers who later recalled that they viewed wreckage of the aircraft on the bottom of sea for the first time on September 15, two weeks after the plane had been shot down.<ref>May 7, 1991, p. 6</ref>

Following publication of the report, the ICAO adopted a resolution condeming the Soviet Union for the attack.<ref name="Merrills">Merrills, p. 61</ref>  Furthermore, the report led to an unanimous amendment in May 1994 to the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation]] that defined the use of force against civilian airliners in more detail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icao.int/ICDB/HTML/English/Representative%20Bodies/Council/Working%20Papers%20by%20Session/158/C.158.WP.11186.en/C.158.WP.11186.EN.HTM |publisher=[[International Civil Aviation Organization]] |date=1999-03-05 |title=Infractions of the Convention On International Civil Aviation |accessdate=2009-01-06 |location=Montreal}}</ref>  The amendment to section 3(d) reads in part: "The contracting States recognize that every State must refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight and that, in case of interception, the lives of persons on board and the safety of aircraft must not be endangered."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://intelligence.senate.gov/perureport.pdf |title=A Review of United States Assistance to Peruvian Counter-Drug Air Interdiction Efforts and the Shootdown of a Civilian Aircraft on April 20, 2001 |publisher=Select Committee on Intelligence |month=October |year=2001 |accessdate=2009-02-14}}</ref>

===U.S. Air Force radar data===
It is customary for the Air Force to impound radar trackings involving possible litigation in cases of aviation accidents.<ref>Pearson, p. 309</ref> In the civil litigation for damages, the [[United States Department of Justice]] explained that the tapes from the Air Force radar installation at King Salmon, Alaska pertinent to KAL 007's flight in the Bethel area had been destroyed and could therefore not be supplied to the plaintiffs. At first Justice Department lawyer Jan Van Flatern stated that they were destroyed 15 days after the shootdown. Later, he said he had "mispoken" and changed the time of destruction to 30 hours after the event. A [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] spokesman concurred, saying that the tapes are re-cycled for reuse from 24<U+2013>30 hours afterwards,<ref>U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, ''In re: Korean Airlines disaster of Sept. 1, 1983'', 28 February 1985</ref> however the fate of KAL 007 was known inside this timeframe.<ref>Pearson, p. 309</ref>

===Interim developments===
[[Image:Boris Yeltsin 21 February 1989-1.jpg|thumb|[[Boris Yeltsin]]|right|thumb|200px]]
Hans Ephraimson-Abt, whose daughter Alice Ephraimson-Abt had died on the flight, chaired the ''American Association for Families of KAL 007 Victims''.  He single-handedly pursued three US administrations for answers about the flight, flying to Washington 250 times and meeting with 149 [[United States Department of State|State Department]] officials.  Following the dissolution of the USSR, Ephraimson-Abt persuaded US Senators [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Sam Nunn]], [[Carl Levin]], and [[Bill Bradley]] to write to the Soviet President, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] requesting information about the flight.<ref>The New York Times, Jan. 7, 1991</ref>  [[Glasnost|''Glasnost'']] reforms in the same year brought about a relaxation of [[Freedom of the press in Russia|press censorship]]; consequently reports started to appear in the Soviet press suggesting that the Soviet military knew the location of the wreckage and had possession of the flight data recorders.<ref name="Illesh-Eng" /><ref>Charles, p. 16</ref>  In December 1991, Senator Jesse Helms of the Committee on Foreign Relations, wrote to Boris Yeltsin requesting information concerning the survival of passengers and crew of KAL 007 including the fate of Congressman Larry McDonald.

On June, 17, 1992, President Yeltsin revealed that after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt]], concerted attempts were made to locate Soviet-era documents relating to KAL 007.  He mentioned the discovery of "a memorandum from K.G.B. to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]]", stating that a tragedy had taken place and adding that there are documents "which would clarify the entire picture". Yeltsin said the memo continued to say that "these documents are so well concealed that it is doubtful that our children will be able to find them."<ref name="NYT1992">{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D61138F93BA25755C0A964958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |publisher=[[New York Times]] |title=Summit In Washington: Reporter's Notebook; The 'Burly' Yeltsin Acquires a New Kind of Stature: Major World Figure |author=Wines, Michael |date=1992-06-18 |accessdate=2009-01-30}}</ref>  On September 11, 1992, Yeltsin officially acknowledged the existence of the black boxes, and promised to give South Korean Government a transcript of the flight recorder contents as found in KGB files. 

In October 1992, Hans Ephraimson-Abt led a delegation of families and US State Department officials to Moscow at the invitation of President Yeltsin.<ref name="Hoffman" />  During a state ceremony at St. Catherine's Hall in the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], the KAL family delegation was handed a portfolio containing partial transcripts of the KAL 007 cockpit voice recorder, translated into Russian, and documents of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] pertaining the tragedy.

In November 1992, President Yeltsin handed the two black box containers to Korean President Roh Tae-Woo, but not the tapes themselves; The following month, the ICAO voted to reopen the KAL 007 investigation in order to take the newly released information in account.  The tapes were handed to ICAO in Paris on 8 January 1993.<ref name="tapes">{{cite press release |url=http://www.icao.int/icao/en/nr/1993/pio199301_e.pdf |title=KAL Tapes To Be Handed Over To ICAO |year=1993 |month=January |publisher=[[International Civil Aviation Organization]] |accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>  Also handed over at the same time were tapes of the ground to air communications of the Soviet military.<ref name="Sayle" />  The tapes were transcribed by the [[Bureau d'Enqu<U+00EA>tes et d'Analyses pour la s<U+00E9>curit<U+00E9> de l'Aviation Civile]] (BEA) in Paris in the presence of representatives from Japan, The Russian Federation, South Korea, and the United States.<ref name="Sayle">{{cite news |title=Closing The File On Flight 007 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/12/13/1993_12_13_090_TNY_CARDS_000368996 |date=1993-12-13 |accessdate=2009-01-31 |author=Sayle, Murray |publisher=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref>

{{quote box|
Simulated search efforts in the Sea of Japan are being performed by our vessels at present in order to dis-inform the U.S. and Japan. These activities will be discontinued in accordance with a specific plan...

Therefore, if the flight recorders shall be transferred to the western countries their objective data can equally be used by the U.S.S.R. and the western countries in proving the opposite view points on the nature of the flight of the South Korean airplane. In such circumstances a new phase in anti-Soviet hysteria cannot be excluded.

In connection with all mentioned above it seems highly preferable not to transfer the flight recorders to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) or any third party willing to decipher their contents. The fact that the recorders are in possession of the U.S.S.R. shall be kept secret...

As far as we are aware neither the U.S. nor Japan has any information on the flight recorders. We have made necessary efforts in order to prevent any disclosure of the information in future.

Looking to your approval.

The third memo acknowledges that analysis of the black box tapes showed no evidence of the Soviet interceptor attempting to contact KAL 007 via radio nor any indication that the KAL 007 crew was aware of warning shots being fired. <blockquote>
"However in case the flight recorders shall become available to the western countries their data may be used for: Confirmation of no attempt by the intercepting aircraft to establish a radio contact with the intruder plane on [[aircraft emergency frequency|121.5&nbsp;MHz]] and no tracers warning shots in the last section of the flight"<ref>Conclusions by the Group of Experts of the Defense Ministry, KGB of the U.S.S.R. and Ministry of Aerospace Industry, Head of the Group Lieutenant-General of Aviation Makarov

That the Soviet search was simulated (while knowing the wreckage lay elsewhere) also is suggested by the article of Mikhail Prozumentshchikov, Deputy Director of the [[Russian State Archives of Recent History]], commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the airplane's shooting down. Commenting on the Soviet and American searches: "Since the U.S.S.R., for natural reasons, knew better where the Boeing had been downed...it was very problematical to retrieve anything, especially as the U.S.S.R. was not particularly interested".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamesoberg.com/09012003commentarymikhailkal.html |author=Mikhail Prozumentshchikov |title=Commentary: 20th Anniversary of Flight 007 |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] via [http://www.jamesoberg.com jamesoberg.com] |date=2003-09-01 |accessdate=2009-01-13}}</ref>

===Revised ICAO report (1993)===
On November 18, 1992, Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]], in a goodwill gesture to South Korea during a visit to Seoul to ratify a new [[treaty]], released both the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of KAL 007.<ref>Ross, ''East Asia in Transition: Toward a New Regional Order''</ref>  Initial South Korean research showed the FDR to be empty and the CVR to have an unintelligible copy.  The Russians then released the recordings to the ICAO Secretary General.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.icao.int/icao/en/nr/1993/pio199301_e.pdf |format=PDF |title=KAL Tapes to be Handed Over to ICAO |accessdate=2009-01-14 |date=January 1993 |location=Montreal}}</ref>  The ICAO report continued to support the initial assertion that KAL 007 accidentally flew in Soviet airspace,<ref name="ICAO 2">{{cite press release |title=ICAO Completes Fact-Finding Investigation |url=http://www.icao.int/cgi/goto_m.pl?icao/en/trivia/kal_flight_007.htm |date=1993-06-16 |accessdate=2009-01-16 |location=Montreal}}</ref> after listening to the flight crew's conversations recorded by the CVR.

[[Image:Grossi-7.png|thumb|Digital [[Flight data recorder]] and [[Cockpit Voice Recorder]]|left|thumb]]
In addition, the Russian Federation released "Transcript of Communications. U.S.S.R. Air Defence Command Centres on Sakhalin Island" transcripts to ICAO<U+2014>this new evidence triggered the revised ICAO report in 1993<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.icao.int/icao/en/nr/1993/pio199308_e.pdf |format=PDF |title=ICAO Completes Fact-Finding Investigation |year=1993 |publisher=[[International Civil Aviation Organization]] |accessdate=2009-01-06 |location=Montreal}}</ref> and is appended to it. These transcripts (of a number of tracks recordings on two reels) are time specified, some to the second, of the communications between the various command posts and other military facilities on Sakhalin from the time of the initial orders for the shootdown and then through the stalking of KAL 007 by Maj. Osipovoich in his Sukhoi 15 interceptor, the attack as seen and commented on by General Kornukov, Commander of [[Sokol Air Base]], down the ranks to the Combat Controller Lt. Col. Titovnin, the post-attack flight of KAL 007 until it had reached Moneron Island, the descent of KAL 007 over Moneron, the initial Soviet SAR missions to Moneron, the futile search of the support interceptors for KAL 007 on the water, and ending with the debriefing of Osipovich on return to base. Some of the communications are the telephone conversations between superior officers and subordinates and involve commands to them, while other communications involve the recorded responses to what was then being viewed on radar tracking KAL 007. These multi-track communications from various command posts telecommunicating at the same minute and seconds as other command posts were communicating provide a "composite" picture of what was taking place.<ref>ICAO '93, Information Paper No. 1, pp. 48<U+2013>208</ref>

The data from the CVR and the FDR revealed that the recordings broke off after the first minute and 44&nbsp;seconds of KAL 007's post missile detonation 12&nbsp;minute flight. ICAO notes that break off of tape is consonant with a high speed crash but indicates that there was no high speed crash at that time. "Spliced joints were found at approximately 108, 440, 442, and {{convert|463|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the beginning of the tape. The middle two were spaced at a distance corresponding to the length of the tape between the two reels and the last data was recorded between these two joints. It was not unusual for the tape to break as a result of high speed impacts, near where it left the reels.".<ref>ICAO Report, 1993, p. 30, paragraph 1.14.3.5.4</ref> The remaining minutes of flight would be supplied by the Russia 1992 submission to ICAO of the real-time Soviet military communication of the shootdown and aftermath.

<!-- The Russian Federation did not return all of the Black Box tapes, but only the first minute and 44&nbsp;seconds portion after missile detonation of the 12&nbsp;minute flight.{{Fact|date=January 2009}}  -->The fact that both recorder tapes stopped exactly at the same time 1&nbsp;minute and 44&nbsp;seconds after missile detonation (18:38:02 GMT) without the tape portions for the more than 10 minutes of KAL 007's post detonation flight before it descended below radar tracking (18:38 GMT) finds no explanation in the ICAO analysis, "It could not be established why both flight recorders simultaneously ceased to operate 104 seconds after the attack. The power supply cables were fed to the rear of the aircraft in [[Electrical conduit|raceways]] on opposite sides of the fuselage until they came together behind the two recorders."<ref name="ICAO93-55" />

===Passenger pain and suffering===
Passenger [[pain and suffering]] was an important factor in determining the level of compensation that was paid by Korean Air Lines.

Fragments from the [[proximity fuze|proximity fused]] R-98 medium range air-to-air missile exploding {{convert|50|m|ft}} behind the tail caused punctures to the [[cabin pressurization|pressurized passenger cabin]].<ref name="ICAO93-93" />  When one of the flight crew radioed [[Tokyo Area Control Center|Tokyo Area Control]] one minute and two seconds after missile detonation his breathing was already "accentuated", indicating to ICAO analysts that he was speaking through the microphone located in his oxygen mask, "Korean Air 007 ah... We are... Rapid compressions. Descend to 10,000."<ref>ICAO '93, p. 35</ref>

Two expert witnesses testified at a Court of Appeals trial on the issue of pre-death pain and suffering. Captain James McIntyre, an experienced Boeing 747 pilot and aircraft accident investigator, testified that shrapnel from the missile caused [[uncontrolled decompression|rapid decompression]] of the cabin, but left the passengers sufficient time to don oxygen masks: "McIntyre testified that, based upon his estimate of the extent of damage the aircraft sustained, all passengers survived the initial impact of the shrapnel from the missile explosion. In McIntyre's expert opinion, at least 12&nbsp;minutes elapsed between the impact of the shrapnel and the crash of the plane, and the passengers remained conscious throughout."<ref>UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT Nos. 907, 1057 August Term, 1994  (Argued: April 5, 1995 Decided: July 12, 1995, Docket Nos. 94-7208, 94-7218</ref>

==Alternative theories==
Flight 007 has been the subject of ongoing controversy and has spawned a number of [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]],<ref name="Knight">Knight, p. 381</ref> primarily as a result of Cold War [[disinformation]] campaigns conducted at the time, as well as the suppression of evidence such as the flight data recorders and the role of USAF surveillance aircraft.  Furthermore, some commentators felt that the ICAO report failed to address key points adequately in its investigation, such as the reason for the aircraft's deviation.<ref>Daniloff, p. 304</ref><ref>Johnson, pp. 230-237</ref>  Some of the conspiracy theories were subsequently proved to be groundless when the flight data recorder evidence became available in 1993; however, others remain unrefuted.

One of the first theories was that [[Space Shuttle Challenger]] and a [[spy satellite|satellite]] were monitoring the airliner's progress over Soviet territory. ''Defence Attach<U+00E9>'', which printed this claim, was sued by Korean Air Lines and forced to pay damages as well as print an apology.<ref name="007backdown">''Time'', 1984-12-03</ref>

In 1994, Robert W Allardyce and James Gollin wrote ''Desired Track: The Tragic Flight of KAL Flight 007'', supporting the spy mission theory.<ref name="desired">{{cite web |url=http://www.planesafe.org/books/desiredtrack.shtml |title=Desired Track: The Tragic Flight of KAL Flight 007 |year=1994 |author=Robert W Allardyce & James Gollin |publisher=[http://www.planesafe.org planesafe.org]}}</ref> In 2007, they reiterated their position in a series of articles in [[Airways Magazine|''Airways Magazine'']], arguing that the investigation by the International Civil Aviation Organization was a cover-up.<ref name="airways">Allardyce & Gollin, 2007</ref>

[[Image:USAF Combat Sent.jpg|thumb|left|USAF RC-135]]
Around the time that KAL 007 was entering into Soviet airspace, a U.S. RC-135 reconnaisance plane was in the area to capture the telemetry of an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] that was to hit the [[Klyuchi target range]] on Kamchatka.<ref>Pearson, p. 47</ref>  The capabilities and role of a [[United States Air Force]] [[Boeing RC-135|RC-135]], that was in the vicinity at the time of the incident, have not been disclosed by the United States military.  During the civil litigation for damages to the families of the victims of the shoot-down, Chief Justice of the District Court of Washington, D.C., Aubrey Robinson, ruled out legal recourse to finding out on grounds that it would endanger U.S. national security.  On April 18, 1984, he allowed questions to the military, "but only in respect to uncovering the legal duty of the military to warn or advise civilian aircraft."<ref>Pearson, p. 305</ref> 

In January 1996, Hans Ephraimson, chairman of the "American Association for Families of KAL 007 Victims", claimed that South Korean President [[Chun Doo-hwan]] accepted $4 million from Korean Air in order to gain "government protection" during the investigation of the shootdown.<ref>Ephraimson, ''Korean Bribe Rekindles Flight 007 Issues''</ref>

[[Image:Larry McDonald.jpg|Congressman Larry McDonald|upright|thumb]]
More recently in 2000, ''Rescue 007: Untold Story of KAL 007 and its Survivors'',<ref> http://www.rescue007.org/book.htm</ref> which is promoted by the "International Committee for the Rescue of KAL 007 Survivors"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rescue007.org/ |title=Rescue 007 Home |accessdate=2009-01-19 |publisher=International Committee for the Rescue of KAL 007 Survivors}}</ref> advanced a theory that KAL 007, though crippled, was able to [[water landing|land on water]] safely enough for at least some of its occupants to have been rescued by the Soviets in Soviet territorial waters, then retained, finally to be incarcerated in various locations in the Soviet Union. This best explains, according to the organization, the Soviet 9 year concealment of the black box tapes, the lack of bodies, body parts, and luggage, reports of survivor sightings,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rescue007.org/faq.htm#10 |title=Frequently Asked Questions Concerning the Downing of KAL Flight 007 and Attendant Matters |publisher=[http://rescue007.org rescue007.org] |accessdate=2009-01-13}}</ref> and the reported Soviet harassment of U.S. search efforts and preventing conducting of the search in Soviet waters. The organization believes that there is credible evidence concerning the subsequent whereabouts of passengers Congressman [[Larry McDonald]] and 5 year old Noelle Anne Grenfell<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rescue007.org/grenfells.htm |title=The Grenfells |publisher=[http://rescue007.org rescue007.org] |accessdate=2009-01-13}}</ref> to reopen the investigation into the shootdown and aftermath.

Though independent of the initiative by Senator [[Jesse Helms]] to launch a CIA investigation of the shootdown while he was ranking member of the Minority Staff ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], the International Committee for the Rescue of KAL 007 Survivors is undertaking a dissemination to the media of the 1991 Republican staff study<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rescue007.org/republican_staff_study.htm|title=Republican Staff Study/"CIA Report" Draft Now Available in Electronic Format for the First Time|publisher=[http://rescue007.org rescue007.org] |date=2008-10-25|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> on the shootdown.  The organization fully supports both the Helms letter to Yeltsin<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rescue007.org/helms_letter.htm|title=Sen Jesse Helms Letter to Boris Yeltsin|publisher=[http://rescue007.org rescue007.org] |date=2008-10-25|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> requesting information about survivors, including Larry McDonald, and supports the conclusion of the study, <U+201C>KAL 007 probably ditched successfuly, there may have been survivors, the Soviets have been lying massively, and diplomatic efforts need to be made to return the possible survivors.<U+201D> 

Another theory was suggested by Michael Brun in his book ''Incident at Sakhalin: The True Mission of KAL Flight 007''.<ref>Burnett, p. 156</ref> According to this book, KAL007 was involved in a spy mission intended to trigger Soviet air defences and to cover the missions of several USAF [[surveillance aircraft|spy airplanes]].  The Korean aircraft was communicating with Tokyo-Narita controllers around half an hour after the official time of the shootdown.  A large air battle occurred between Soviet Air Force and USAF, during which the Soviets shot down several American aircraft, including a [[Boeing RC-135|RC-135]], an [[EF-111A Raven|EF-111]] and probably even an [[SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71]].  The SU-15 pilot, Major Osipovich, flew two sorties and shot down two targets (contradicted by the 1991 interview with Osipovich<ref name="Illesh-Eng"/>).  The whereabouts of the KAL-007 wreckage is not known to anyone, but is probably {{convert|500|km|mi}} away from the Moneron island.  The theory postulates further that the real cause of the destruction is not known, but could have been a [[surface-to-air missile]] fired from USS ''Badger'' (similar case with USS ''Vincennes'' shooting down of [[Iran Air Flight 655]]) or from Japanese forces, who could not identify the airliner which was keeping radio silence.

==Aftermath==
[[Image:KAL Monument.jpg|thumb|right|"The Tower of Prayer", a momument to KAL 007 at [[Cape S<U+014D>ya]], Japan]]
The FAA temporarily closed [[airway (aviation)|Airway]] R-20, the air corridor that Korean Air Flight 007 was meant to follow, on September 2.  However airlines fiercely resisted the closure of this popular route, the shortest of five corridors spanning Alaska and the Far East.  It was therefore reopened on October 2 after safety and navigational aids were checked.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=1983-10-09 |accessdate=2009-02-07 |}}</ref><ref>Pearson, p. 256</ref>

NATO had decided, under the impetus of the Reagan administration, to deploy [[Pershing II#Pershing II|Pershing II]] and [[cruise missile]]s in West Germany.<ref>Blacker, p. 308</ref> This deployment would have placed missiles just 6<U+2013>10 minutes striking distance from Moscow. Support for the deployment was wavering and it looked doubful that it would be carried out.  However when the Soviet Union shot down Flight 007, the U.S. was able to galvanize enough support at home and abroad to enable the deployment to go ahead.<ref>Johnson, p. 75</ref>

The unprecedented disclosure of the communications intercepted by the United States and Japan revealed a considerable amount of information about their [[military intelligence|intelligence]] systems and capabilities.  [[National Security Agency]] director [[Lincoln D. Faurer]] commented: "...as a result of the Korean Air Lines affair, you have already heard more about my business in the past two weeks than I would desire...For the most part this has not been a matter of unwelcome leaks.  It is the result of a conscious, responsible decision to address an otherwise unbelievable horror."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Speech to the National Military Intelligence Association |journal=Aerospace Daily |date=1983-09-25 |accessdate=2009-02-07 |pages=p. 99}}</ref>  Changes that the Soviets subsequently made to their [[code]]s and frequencies reduced the effectiveness of this monitoring by 60%.<ref>Baltimore Sun (1983-09-15) via Johnson, p. 60</ref>

The U.S. KAL 007 Victims' Association, under the leadership of Hans Ephraimson-Abt, successfully [[Lobbying|lobbied]] [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and the airline industry to accept an agreement that would ensure that future victims of airline accidents would be compensated quickly and fairly by increasing compensation and lowering the [[burden of proof]] of airliner misconduct.<ref name="Hoffman">{{cite news |author=Jan Hoffman |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E6D6113AF932A05750C0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Grieving Father's 14-Year Crusade Helps Air Crash Victims |date=1997-03-31 |accessdate=2009-01-22 |publisher=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>  This legislation has had far-reaching effects for the victims of subsequent aircraft disasters.

The U.S. decided to utilize military radars to extend air traffic control [[radar]] coverage from {{convert|200|mi|km}} to {{convert|1200|mi|km}} out from Anchorage.<ref group="Notes">These radars had been used in 1968 to alert [[Seaboard World Airlines Flight 253]] in a similar situation.</ref>  In 1986, the United States, Japan and the Soviet Union set up a joint air traffic control system to monitor aircraft over the North Pacific, thereby giving the Soviet Union formal responsibility to monitor civilian air traffic, and setting up direct communication links between the controllers of the three countries.<ref>Taubman, ''Keeping the Air Lanes Free: Lessons of a Horror''</ref>

[[Ronald Reagan]] announced on September 16, 1983 that the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) would be made available for civilian use, free of charge, once completed in order to avert similar navigational errors in future.<ref name="GPS">Pellerin, ''United States Updates Global Positioning System Technology: New GPS satellite ushers in a range of future improvements''</ref>  Furthermore, the interface of the [[autopilot]] used on large airlines was modified to make it more obvious whether it is operating in <small>HEADING</small> mode or <small>INS</small> mode.<ref name="NASA" />

==Flight timeline and transcripts==
The following transcript is compiled from Japanese [[ELINT|electronic intercepts]] of Soviet Su-15 transmissions,<ref group="Notes">These intercepts did not include Soviet ground transmissions, only those of the high-flying aircraft.</ref> a transcript of communications of U.S.S.R. Air Defence Command Centres on Sakhalin Island (released in 1993), civil air traffic controller recordings from Tokyo and Anchorage, and the KAL 007 [[cockpit voice recorder]] (released in 1993).  The ICAO co-ordinated the times of Soviet transmissions with partial, but time-stamped communications intercepted by Japan.  Some Air Combat Controller fighter vectoring, fuel read-outs and inter-command post "chatter" is not included.
