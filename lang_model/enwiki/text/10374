'''Martita Hunt''' (30 January 1900{{ndash}}13 June 1969) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[theatre]] and [[film]] [[actor|actress]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hunt was born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] on 30 January 1900 to British parents Alfred and Marta Hunt (n<U+00E9>e Burnett). She spent the first ten years of her life in Argentina before she returned with her parents to [[England]] to attend [[Queenwood Ladies' College]], in [[Eastbourne]], and then to train as an actress under [[Genevieve Ward|Dame Genevieve Ward]] and Lady Benson.

===Early theatrical career===
Hunt began her acting career in [[repertory theatre]] at [[Liverpool]] before moving to [[London]]. She first appeared there in the [[Stage Society]]'s production of [[Ernst Toller]]'s ''The Machine Wreckers'' at the [[Kingsway Theatre]] in May 1923.  From 1923-9 she appeared as the Principessa della Cercola in [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[Our Betters]]'' ([[Gielgud Theatre|Globe]], 1924) and as Mrs. Linden in [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen's]] ''[[A Doll's House]]'' ([[Playhouse Theatre|Playhouse]], 1925) in the [[West End theatre|West End]], along with engagements at club theatres such as the [[Q Theatre]] and the [[Arts Theatre]] and a short 1926 [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] season at the small Barnes Theatre under Victor Komisarjevsky (playing Charlotta Ivanovna, in ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' and Olga in ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'').

In September 1929 she joined the [[Old Vic]] company, then led by [[Harcourt Williams]], and in the following eight months played B<U+00E9>line in [[Moli<U+00E8>re|Moli<U+00E8>re's]] ''[[The Imaginary Invalid]]'', Queen Elizabeth in [[George Bernard Shaw|George Bernard Shaw's]] ''[[The Dark Lady of the Sonnets]]'', and Lavinia in Shaw's ''[[Androcles and the Lion]]''.  However, her time there was more noted for a succession of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearian]] roles (the Nurse in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]] in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', the Queen in ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', Helena in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', [[Portia (Julius Caesar)|Portia]] in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''), including some alongside [[John Gielgud]] (Rosalind in ''[[As You Like It]]'', Lady Macbeth in ''[[Macbeth]]'', and Queen Gertrude in ''[[Hamlet]]'').  Donald Roy, in her [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] entry, states:

<blockquote>"With an arresting appearance and a dominant stage presence, she proved most effective as strong, tragic characters, her Gertrude in Hamlet being accounted by some critics the finest they had seen."</blockquote>

She then returned to the West End (briefly returning to the Old Vic to play Emilia in their 1938 ''[[Othello]]''), notably playing Edith Gunter in [[Dodie Smith]]'s ''Autumn Crocus'' ([[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric]], 1931), the Countess of Rousillon in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' (Arts, 1932), Lady Strawholme in [[Ivor Novello]]'s ''Fresh Fields'' ([[Criterion Theatre|Criterion]], 1933), Liz Frobisher in [[John Van Druten]]'s ''The Distaff Side'' ([[Apollo Theatre|Apollo]], 1933), Barbara Dawe in [[Clemence Dane]]'s ''Moonlight is Silver'' ([[Queen's Theatre|Queen's]], 1934), Theodora in [[Elmer Rice]]'s ''[[Not for Children]]'' ([[Fortune Theatre|Fortune]], 1935), Masha in Chekhov's ''[[The Seagull]]'' ([[No<U+00EB>l Coward Theatre|New Theatre]], 1936), ), the Mother in an English-language version of [[Garcia Lorca]]'s ''[[Blood Wedding (play)|Bodas de sangre]]'' entitled ''Marriage of Blood'' ([[Savoy Theatre|Savoy]], 1939),  L<U+00E9>onie in [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''[[Les parents terribles]]'' ([[Gate Theatre|Gate]], 1940), Mrs Cheveley in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[An Ideal Husband]]'' ([[Westminster Theatre|Westminster]], 1943), and Cornelia in [[John Webster]]'s ''[[The White Devil]]'' ([[Duchess Theatre|Duchess]], 1947).

===Early film career===

Hunt also appeared in many supporting and cameo roles in several popular [[England|British]] films such as, ''Good Morning Boys'' (1937), ''[[Trouble Brewing (1939 film)|Trouble Brewing]]'' (1939), and ''[[The Man in Grey]]'' (1943).  However, it took more than twenty years before she achieved her greatest success. ''[[The Wicked Lady]]'' (1945) was an international success, but her next film role as [[Miss Havisham]] in ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' (1946), reprising her performance in the same role in a 1939 stage version of the novel, that brought her renown as a film actress.  [[Alec Guinness]], who played [[Herbert Pocket]] in that same stage version, also appeared in the 1946 film.

===Later career===
From this time on she divided her time between British films, [[Hollywood]] films and the theatre. She won a [[Tony Award]] in 1949 for her Broadway d<U+00E9>but as Countess Aurelia in the English-speaking premi<U+00E8>re of Giraudoux's ''[[The Madwoman of Chaillot]]'' (though she had relatively less impact on the production's 1952 tour). This success seems to have typecast her as the grande dame or patrician grotesque, and a scaling-back on her stage appearances from 1950 onwards (with her last stage role being Ang<U+00E9>lique Boniface in ''[[Hotel Paradiso]]'', an adaptation from [[Georges Feydeau|Feydeau]], alongside [[Alec Guinness]] at the [[Winter Garden Theatre|Winter Garden]] in May 1956). 

Some of her other films include ''[[Anna Karenina (1948 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1948), ''My Sister and I'' (1948), ''[[The Fan (1949 film)|The Fan]]'' (1949), ''Folly to be Wise'' (1952), ''The March Hare'' (1956), ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), ''[[Three Men in a Boat (1956 film)|Three Men in a Boat]]'' (1956), ''[[The Admirable Crichton (film)|The Admirable Crichton]]'' (1957), ''[[The Prince and the Showgirl]]'' (1957)<ref>reprising her stage performance as the Grand Duchess in its source, [[Terence Rattigan]]'s ''[[The Sleeping Prince]] ([[Phoenix Theatre|Phoenix]], 1953)</ref>, ''[[The Brides of Dracula (film)|The Brides of Dracula]]'' (1960), ''[[The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm]]'' (1962), ''[[Becket (film)|Becket]]'' (1964), ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (film)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]'' (1964) and ''[[Bunny Lake Is Missing]]'' (1965).
