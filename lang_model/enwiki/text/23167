A '''gynoid''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''<U+03B3><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03B7>, gyn<U+0113>'' - woman) is a [[humanoid robot]] designed to look like a human female, as compared to an [[android]] modeled after a male.<ref name=melzer202/><ref name=technophob77/><ref name=Tatsumi/><ref name=desirbody21/><ref name=Foster103/> The term is not common, however, with android being used to refer to both "[[gender]]s" of robot. The word '''fembot''' (female robot) has also been used.<ref name=popscibots/>

Gynoids have also been used as a [[metaphor]] in [[feminist]] discourse, as part of [[cyborg feminism]], representing female physical strength and freedom from the expectation to reproduce. "Fembot" is sometimes used as an insult towards feminist women.<ref name=popscibots/>

==In fiction==
{{See also|List of fictional gynoids}}<!-- Examples should go to list article. Only examples from reliable sources that illuminate a point of discussion are needed in main article. -->
Artificial women have been a common trope in fiction and mythology since the writings of the ancient Greeks. This has continued with modern fiction, particularly in the genre of science fiction. In science fiction, female-appearing robots are often produced for use as domestic servants and sexual slaves, as seen in the film ''Westworld'', the Paul McAuley novel ''Fairyland'' (1995), and the Lester del Ray short story "Helen O'Loy" (1938).<ref name=technophob77>{{cite book |title= Technophobia!: Science Fiction Visions of Posthuman Technology|last= Dinello|first= Daniel |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2005|publisher= University of Texas Press|page= 77|isbn=9780292709867}}</ref> The term gynoid was created by Gwyneth Jones in her 1985 novel ''Divine Endurance'' to describe a robot slave character in a futuristic China, that is judged by her beauty.<ref name=Tatsumi>{{cite book |title= Full Metal Apache: Transactions between Cyberpunk Japan and Avant-Pop America|last= Tatsumi |first= Takayuki |authorlink= |page=213, Notes |year= 2006|publisher= Duke University Press|location= Durham NC|isbn=0822337746}}</ref>

===Race===
The treatment of gynoids in fiction has been seen as a metaphor for both misogony and racism, as in the film [[Blade Runner|''Blade Runner'']], in which all three of the important female characters are gynoids, two of which use their sexuality to attempt to manipulate or kill the protagonist Rick Deckard, often using sexualised imagery, such as when Pris attempts to strangle him between her thighs. Daniel Dinello writes that the violence with which the gynoids is treated represents Deckard's hatred of women. The third gynoid, Rachel, acts as a submissive female, even after Deckard "virtually rapes her".<ref name=technophob77/> Thomas Foster writes, about the novel ''[[Dead Girls]]'' by [[Richard Calder (writer)|Richard Calder]], that the technological bodies of gynoids depict sexism and racism in an unnatural context, highlighting their negative impact. They also show that stereotypes and societal attitudes will not necessarily be altered through technological progress.<ref>{{cite book |title= The souls of cyberfolk: posthumanism as vernacular theory|last= Foster|first= Thomas |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2005|publisher= U of Minnesota Press|location= |isbn=9780816634064}}</ref>

Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] both have a long tradition of female robot characters. The artist [[Hajime Sorayama]] is particularly influential, with his "sexy robot" images, found in his collection ''The Gynoids'' (1993).<ref>{{cite book |title= The Gynoids|last= Sorayama|first= Hajime |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1993|publisher= Treville|location= |isbn=9784845707829}}</ref> These pieces depict primarily females with metalic skin, and have been regarded as comments on gender and sexual conventions, and race, by highliting the "whiteness" of the traditional pin-up girl.<ref>Foster, p. 107, "'that metallic feeling' seems to heighten and make visible a form of whiteness that in a pin-up girl would seem unremarkable or banal (that is, to the extent that Soyorama's gynoids can be said to embody racial meanings at all, it is through this displacment of "white" skin)."</ref> The sexualised images of gynoids have also been intepreted as fetishisation of the female body, racial differences, and technology.<ref>Foster, p. 107</ref>

===The perfect woman===
[[Image:Falconet - Pygmalion & Galatee (1763).jpg|thumb|upright|[[<U+00C9>tienne Maurice Falconet]]: ''Pygmalion et Galat<U+00E9>e'' (1763). Although not robotic, Pymalian's inorganic origin has led to comparisons with gynoids]] 
A long tradition exists in fiction, of men attempting to create the stereotypical "ideal woman", and fictional gynoids have been seen as an extension of this theme.<ref name=melzer202>Melzer, p. 202</ref> Examples include [[Pygmalion]], one of the earliest conceptualizations of constructions similar to gynoids in literary history, from [[Ovid]]'s account of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]].<ref name=melzer202/> In this myth a female statue is sculpted that is so beautiful that the creator falls in love with it, and after praying to [[Venus]], the goddess takes pity on him and converts the statue into a real woman with whom Pygmalion has children. The first gynoid in film, the Maria impersonator in [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]] is also an example.<ref name=melzer202/>  In [[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]] a femininely shaped robot is given skin so that she is not known to be a robot and successfully impersonates the imprisoned Maria and works convincingly as an exotic dancer. Such gynoids are designed according to patriachal stereotypes of a perfect women, being "sexy, dumb, and obedient", and show the sexist beliefs of their creators.<ref name=technophob77/> Fictional gynoids are often unique products made to fit a particular man's desire, as seen in the novel ''[[Tomorrow's Eve]]'' and films ''[[The Benumbed Woman]]'', ''[[Stepford Wives]]'' and ''[[Mannequin (film)|Mannequin]]'',<ref name=desirbody230>Stratton, p.230</ref> and the creator's are often male "[[mad scientists]]" such as the characters [[Rotwang]] in ''Metropolis'', Tyrell in ''Blade Runner'', and the husbands in ''Stepford Wives''.<ref name=technophob78>{{cite book |title= Technophobia!: Science Fiction Visions of Posthuman Technology|last= Dinello|first= Daniel |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2005|publisher= University of Texas Press|page= 78|isbn=9780292709867}}</ref> Gynoids have been described as the "ultimate geek fantasy: a metal-and-plastic woman of your own".<ref name=popscibots>http://www.popsci.com/cars/article/2008-12/return-bodacious-bots</ref>

''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' television series coined the word fembot. These fembots were a line of powerful life-like gynoids with the faces of protagonist [[Jaime Sommers]]'s best friends.<ref>Browne, Ray B., ''Forbidden Fruits: Taboos and Tabooism in Culture'', Popular Press, 1984, 9780879722555</ref> They fought in two multi-part episodes of the series: "Kill Oscar" and "Fembots in Las Vegas", and despite the feminine [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]], there were also male versions, including some designed to impersonate particular individuals for the purpose of infiltration. While not truly [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]], the fembots still had extremely sophisticated programming that allowed them to pass for human in most situations. The term "fembot" was also used in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' (referring to a robot duplicate of the title character, a.k.a. the [[Buffybot]]) and [[Futurama]]. <!-- These both have sources discussing their use to be added-->

===Sex objects===
Patricia Melzer writes that gynoids are "irresistibly linked" to men's lust, and are mainly designed as sex-objects, having no use beyond "pleasing men's violent sexual desires".<ref>Melzer, p. 204</ref> Female cyborgs have been similarly used in fiction, in which natural bodies are modified to become objects of fantasy.<ref name=melzer202/> The gynoid character Eve from ''[[Eve of Destruction]]'' has been described as "a literal sex bomb", with her subservience to patriachal authority and a bomb in place of reproductive organs.<ref name=desirbody230>Stratton, p.230</ref>

Sex with gynoids has been compared to necrophilia.<ref>{{cite book |title= The body's perilous pleasures: dangerous desires and contemporary culture|last= Michele |first= Aaron|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1999|publisher= Edinburgh University Press|pages=108-124 |isbn=9780748609611}}</ref> Sexual interest in gynoids and fembots has been attributed to fetishisation of technology, and compared to Sadomasochism in that it reorganises the social risk of sex. The depiction of female robots minimises the threat felt by men from female sexuality and allow the "erasure of any social interference in the spectator's erotic enjoyment of the image".<ref name=Foster103>Foster, p. 103, "Gynoids are frames that enable us to desire differently, by accommodating libidinal investments in male lack".</ref> Gynoid fantasies are produced and collected by online communites centred around chat rooms and web-site galleries, such as [http://www.Dollforum.com Doll&nbsp;Forum] and  Gynoid Gallery.<ref>Foster, p. 103</ref>

===Gender stereotypes===
Fiction about gynoids or female cyborgs reinforce "essentialist ideas of feminity", according to Magret Grebowicz.<ref>{{cite book |title= SciFi in the mind's eye: reading science through science fiction|last= Grebowicz|first= Margret |authorlink= |coauthors= L. Timmel Duchamp, Nicola Griffith, Terry Bisson|year=2007 |publisher= Open Court|page=xviii |isbn=9780812696301}}</ref> Such essentialist ideas may present as sexual or gender stereotypes. Among the few non-eroticized fictional gynoids include [[Rosie the Robot Maid]] from [[The Jetsons]]. However, she still has some sterotypically feminine qualities, such as a matronly shape and a predisposition to cry.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Social Psychology of Gender: How Power and Intimacy Shape Gender Relations|last= Rudman|first= Laurie A.|authorlink= |coauthors= Peter Glick, Susan T. Fiske|year=2008 |publisher= Guilford Press|page=178 |isbn=9781593858254}}</ref>
[[Image:Fembots 2 APIMOM.jpg|thumb|220px|Exageratedly feminine Fembots with guns in their breasts, from ''Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery'']]
The stereotypical role of wifedom has also been explored through use of gynoids. In ''The Stepford Wives'', husbands are shown as desiring to restrict the independence of their wives, and obedient and stereotypical spouses are preferred. The husbands' technological method of obtaining this "perfect wife" is through the murder of their human wives and replacement with gynoid substitutes that are compliant and housework obsessed, resulting in a "picture-postcard" perfect suburban society. This has been seen as an allegory of male chauvinism of the period, by representing marriage as a master-slave relationship, and an attempt at raising feminist consciousness during the era of second wave feminism.<ref name=technophob78/> 

In a parody of the fembots from ''The Bionic Woman'', attractive fembots in fuzzy see-through night-gowns were used as a lure for the fictional agent [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]] in the movie ''[[Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery]]''. The film's sequels had [[cameo appearance]]s of characters revealed as fembots. Judith Halberstam writes that these gynoids inform the viewer that femaleness does not indicate naturalness, and their exaggerated femininity and sexuality is used in a similar way to the title character's exagerated masculinity, lampooning stereotypes.<ref>{{cite book |title= In a Queer Time and Place: Transgender Bodies, Subcultural Lives|last= Halberstam|first= Judith |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2005|publisher=NYU Press |page= 144|isbn=9780814735855}}</ref>

[[Image:ProjectAiko2007B.jpg|thumb|"Aiko", an early attempt at creating a realistic-looking female robot]]
Female-appearing robots have also appeared in real-life, with early constructions being crude. The first gynoid was produced by Sex Objects Ltd, a British company, for use as a "sex-aid". It was called simply "36C", from her chest measurement, and had a 16-bit microprocessor and voice synthesiser that allowed primitive responses to speech and push button inputs.<ref>{{cite book |title= Artificial intelligence: human effects|last= Yazdani|first=Masoud  |authorlink= |coauthors= Ajit Narayanan|year= 1984|publisher= E.

===Functions===
Posited functions of gynoids include performing jobs traditionally seen as [[women's work]], such as [[housework]], secretarial work and teaching small children.

Gynoids may be "eroticized", and some examples such as Aiko include sensitivity sensors in their breasts and genitals to facilitate sexual response.<ref>http://www.projectaiko.com/faq.html</ref> The fetishization of gynoids in real life has been attributed to male desires for a custom-made passive women, and has been compared to life-size [[sex doll]]s.<ref name=desirbody21>"The automaton becomes both a philosophical toy and sexual fetish", "I extend the meaning of gynoid to include non-mechanical models of women such life-size dolls" Stratton, p.21</ref>

The reaction of people to robots that appeared female to different degrees has been studied. The reaction of people to such robots has been attributed in part to gender stereotypes. This research has been used to elucidate gender cues, clarifying which behaviours and asthetics elicit a stronger gender-induced response.<ref name=carpenter1>Carpenter, p. 1</ref>
