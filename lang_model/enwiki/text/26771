'''Star Trail''' is as resulting of sort of photography created by consanguinity of earth and stars moves. Since the Earth spins, the stars are not at set sites in the atmosphere but come into view to shift, more or less into  the west. The stars appear to go around both the north and south poles in the sky, of which you usually only see one. Stars extremely close to the pole are roughly stationary in the sky, whilst stars closer to the equatorial plane move quite speedy.
