'''Norton Priory''' is a historic site in [[Norton, Runcorn|Norton]], [[Runcorn]], [[Cheshire]], England, comprising the remains of an [[abbey]] complex dating from the 12th to 16th&nbsp;centuries, and an 18th-century country house; it is now a museum. The remains are a [[scheduled ancient monument]] and have been designated by [[English Heritage]] as a Grade&nbsp;I [[listed building]]. They are considered to be the most important monastic remains in Cheshire.

The [[priory]] was established as an [[Augustinian]] foundation in the 12th&nbsp;century, and was raised to the status of an abbey in 1391. The abbey was closed in 1536, as part of the [[dissolution of the monasteries]]. Nine years later the surviving structures, together with the [[Manorialism|manor]] of Norton, were purchased by Sir&nbsp;[[Richard Brooke (Norton)|Richard Brooke]], who built a [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] house on the site, incorporating part of the abbey. This was replaced in the 18th&nbsp;century by a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] house. The Brooke family left the house in 1921, and it was partially demolished in 1928. In 1966 the site was given in trust for the use of the general public.

Excavation of the site began in 1971, and became the largest to be carried out by modern methods on any European monastic site. It revealed the foundations and lower parts of the walls of the monastery buildings and the abbey church. Important finds included: a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] doorway; a finely carved [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]; a floor of [[mosaic]] tiles, the largest floor area of this type to be found in any modern excavation; the remains of the [[kiln]] where the tiles were fired; a bell pit used for casting the bell; and a large medieval [[Statue of St Christopher (Norton Priory)|statue of Saint&nbsp;Christopher]].

The site was opened to the public in the 1970s. It includes a museum, the excavated ruins, and the surrounding garden and woodland. In 1984 the separate [[walled garden]] was redesigned and opened to the public. Norton Priory is now a visitor attraction, and the museum trust organises a programme of events, exhibitions, educational courses, and outreach projects.

==History==
===Priory===
In 1115 a community of [[Augustinian]] [[Canon (priest)|canons]] was founded in the [[burh]] of [[Runcorn]] by [[William fitz Nigel (d. 1134)|William fitz Nigel]], the second [[List of Barons of Halton|Baron of Halton]] and [[Constable]] of [[Chester]], on the south bank of the [[River Mersey]] where it narrows to form the [[River Mersey#Runcorn Gap|Runcorn Gap]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=9.}}</ref> This was the only practical site where the Mersey could be crossed between [[Warrington]] and [[Birkenhead]], and the archaeologists Fraser Brown and Christine Howard-Davis consider it likely that the canons cared for travellers and pilgrims crossing the river. They also speculate that William may have sought to profit from the tolls paid by these travellers.<ref name="HowardDavis2008b">{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=425.}}</ref> The [[priory]] was the second religious house to be founded in the [[Earl of Chester|Earldom of Chester]]; the first was the [[Benedictine]] [[Chester Cathedral#History|St&nbsp;Werburgh's Abbey]] at [[Chester]], founded in 1093 by [[Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh Lupus]], the first [[Earl of Chester]].<ref name=g1>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=1.}}</ref> The priory at Runcorn had a double dedication, to [[St Bertelin|Saint Bertelin]] and to [[Mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]].<ref name=vch/> The authors of the ''[[Victoria County History]]'' suggest that the dedication to St&nbsp;Bertelin was taken from a [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Saxon]] church already existing on the site.<ref name=g1/><ref name=vch/> In 1134 [[List of Barons of Halton#3 William FitzWilliam|William fitz&nbsp;William]], the third Baron of Halton, moved the priory to a site in [[Norton, Runcorn|Norton]], a village {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} to the east of Runcorn. The reasons for the move are uncertain. It may have been that fitz&nbsp;William<!--this is not a surname--> wanted greater control of the strategic crossing of the Mersey at Runcorn Gap, or it may have been because the canons wanted a more secluded site.<ref name=vch>{{citation |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=39979 |title=House of Augustinian canons: The abbey of Norton|accessdate=8&nbsp;July 2008 |editor1-last=Elrington |editor1-first=C.

The site for the new priory was in damp, scrubby woodland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=16.}}</ref> There is no evidence that it was agricultural land, or that it contained any earlier buildings. The first priority was to clear and drain the land. There were freshwater springs near the site, and these would have provided fresh running water for latrines and domestic purposes. They would also have been used to create watercourses and [[moat]]ed enclosures, some of which might have been used for orchards and herb gardens. [[Sandstone]] for building the priory was available at an outcrop nearby, sand for mortar could be obtained from the shores of the River Mersey, and [[boulder clay]] on the site provided material for floor and roof tiles. Excavation has revealed remnants of oak, some of it from trees hundreds of years old. It is likely that this came from various sources; some from nearby, and some donated from the forests at [[Forests of Mara and Mondrem|Delamere]] and [[Macclesfield Forest|Macclesfield]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=15<U+2013>16.}}</ref> The church and monastic buildings were constructed in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style.<ref name=bh23/>

The priory was endowed by William fitz&nbsp;Nigel with properties in [[Cheshire]], [[Lancashire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Oxfordshire]], including the churches of [[St Mary and All Saints Church, Great Budworth|St&nbsp;Mary, Great Budworth]] and [[St Michael's Church, Chester|St&nbsp;Michael, Chester]]. By 1195 the priory owned eight churches, five houses, the [[Tithe#Tithing in the Middle Ages|tithe]] of at least eight mills, the rights of [[Common land|common]] in four townships, and one-tenth of the profits from the Runcorn ferry.<ref name=vch/><ref name=s35>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=3<U+2013>6.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=3<U+2013>6.}}</ref> The prior supplied the chaplain to the hereditary Constables of Chester and to the Barons of Halton.<ref name=s35/>

During the 12th&nbsp;century, the main benefactors of the priory were the Barons of Halton, but after 1200 their gifts reduced, mainly because they transferred their interests to the [[Cistercian]]  [[Stanlow Abbey|abbey at Stanlow]], which had been founded in 1178 by [[List of Barons of Halton#6 John FitzRichard|John fitz&nbsp;Richard]], the sixth baron. Archaeologist [[J. Patrick Greene]] states that it is unlikely that any of the Barons of Halton were buried in Norton Priory. The only members of the family known to be buried there are Richard, brother of [[List of Barons of Halton#7 Roger de Lacy|Roger de&nbsp;Lacy]], the seventh baron, and a female named Alice. The identity of Alice has not been confirmed, but Greene considers that she was the niece of [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey|William, Earl Warenne, the 5th&nbsp;Earl of Surrey]] and therefore a relative of the Delacy family, who were at that time the Barons of Halton. The earl made a grant to the priory of 30&nbsp;[[Shilling (English coin)|shillings]] a year in order to "maintain a [[pittance]] for her soul".<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=7<U+2013>8.}}</ref> As the role played by the Barons of Halton declined, so the importance of members of the Dutton family increased. The Duttons had been benefactors since the priory's foundation, and from the 13th century they became the principal benefactors. There were two main branches of the family, one in [[Dutton, Cheshire|Dutton]] and the other in [[Sutton Weaver]]. The Dutton family had their own burial chapel in the priory, and burial in the chapel is specified in three wills made by members of the family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=9<U+2013>15.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=35<U+2013>36.}}</ref> The Aston family of [[Aston-by-Sutton|Aston]] were also important benefactors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=15<U+2013>16.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=36.}}</ref>

The priory buildings, including the church, were extended during the late 12th and early 13th&nbsp;centuries. It has been estimated that the original community would have consisted of 12&nbsp;canons and the prior; this increased to around 26&nbsp;members in the later part of the 12th&nbsp;century, making it one of the largest houses in the Augustinian order.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=430.}}</ref> By the end of the century the church had been lengthened, a new and larger [[chapter house]] had been built (I* on the plan), and a large chapel had been added to the east end of the church (N). In about 1200 the west front of the church was enlarged (M), a bell tower was built and guest quarters were constructed.<ref name=s37>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=37.}}</ref> It is possible that the chapel at the east end was built to accommodate the holy cross of Norton, a [[relic]] which was reputed to have miraculous healing powers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=21.}}</ref> A fire in 1236 destroyed the timber-built kitchen (Q) and damaged the west range of the monastic buildings and the roof of the church. The kitchen was rebuilt and the other damage was rapidly repaired.<ref name=vch/><ref name=s37/><ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=431<U+2013>432.}}</ref>

===Abbey===
During the first half of the 14th&nbsp;century, the priory suffered from financial mismanagement and disputes with the Dutton family, exacerbated by a severe flood in 1331 that reduced the income from the priory's lands.<ref name=vch/><ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=64<U+2013>65.}}</ref> The direct effects of the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]] are not known, but during the 1350s financial problems continued. These were improved to an extent with the selling of the [[advowson]] of the church at [[Ratcliffe-on-Soar]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=21.}}</ref> Matters further improved from 1366 with the appointment of Richard Wyche as prior. He was active in the governance of the wider Augustinian order and in political affairs, and in 1391 was involved in raising the priory's status to that of a mitred abbey. A mitred abbey was one in which the abbot was given permission to use [[Pontifical vestments|pontifical insignia]], including the [[mitre]], [[Ecclesiastical ring#Episcopal rings|ring]] and [[Crosier|pontifical staff]], and to give the solemn [[benediction]] provided a [[bishop]] was not present.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=65.}}</ref> It was rare for an Augustinian house to be elevated to this status. Out of about 200&nbsp;Augustinian houses in England and Wales, 28&nbsp;were abbeys and only seven of these became mitred. The only other mitred abbey in Cheshire was that of St&nbsp;Werburgh in Chester.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=65<U+2013>66.}}</ref> In 1379 and in 1381 there were 15&nbsp;canons at Norton and in 1401 there were 16, making it the largest Augustinian community in the northwest of England. By this time the barony of Halton had passed by a series of marriages to the [[duchy of Lancaster]]. [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], the 1st&nbsp;Duke of Lancaster and 14th&nbsp;Baron of Halton, agreed to be the patron of the newly formed abbey. At this date the church was {{convert|287|ft|0}} long; it was the second longest Augustinian church in northwest England, exceeded only by the {{convert|328|ft|0}} long church at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=66.}}</ref> Towards the end of the 14th&nbsp;century, the abbey acquired a "giant" [[St Christopher, Norton Priory|statue of Saint&nbsp;Christopher]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=66<U+2013>67.}}</ref> Three wills from members of the Dutton family from this period survive; they are dated 1392, 1442 and 1527, and in each will money was bequeathed to the foundation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=22.}}</ref>
[[File:Norton Priory model.jpg|thumb|left|Model of the abbey as it is thought it would have appeared in the 16th&nbsp;century|alt=An abbey model seen from an elevated position from the southeast]]
The abbey's fortunes went into decline after the death of Richard Wyche in 1400. Wyche was succeeded by his [[prior]], John Shrewsbury, who "does not seem to have done more than keep the house in order".<ref name=bh23>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=23.}}</ref> Frequent floods had reduced its income, and in 1429 the church and other abbey buildings were described as being "ruinous".<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=67.}}</ref> Problems continued through the rest of the 15th&nbsp;century, resulting in the sale of more advowsons. By 1496 the number of canons had been reduced to nine, and to seven in 1524. In 1522 there were reports of disputes between the abbot and the prior. The abbot was accused of "wasting the house's resources, nepotism, relations with women" and other matters, while the prior admitted to "fornication and lapses in the observation of the [[Augustinians#The Augustinian Rule|Rule]]". The prior threatened the abbot with a knife, but then left the abbey.<ref name=bh23/> The physical state of the buildings continued to deteriorate.<ref name=vch/><ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=67<U+2013>69.}}</ref>

The records of the priory and abbey have not survived, but the excavations and the study of other documents have produced evidence of how the monastic lands were managed. The principal source of income came from farming. This income was required not only for the building and upkeep of the property, but also for feeding the canons, their guests, and visiting pilgrims. The priory also had an obligation from its foundation to house travellers fording the Mersey. It has been estimated that nearly half of the [[demesne]] lands were used for [[Agronomy|arable farming]]. The grain grown on priory lands was ground by a local windmill and by a watermill outside the priory lands. Excavations revealed part of a stone handmill in the area used in the monastic kitchen. In addition to orchards and herb gardens in the moated enclosures, it is likely that beehives were maintained for the production of honey. There is evidence from bone fragments that cattle, sheep, pigs, geese and chickens were reared and consumed, but few bone fragments from deer, rabbits or hares have been discovered. Horseflesh was not eaten. Although few fish bones have been discovered, it is known from documentary evidence that the canons owned a number of local fisheries. The fuel used consisted of wood and [[charcoal]], and [[Peat|turf]] from marshes over which the priory had rights of [[turbary]] (to cut turf).<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=23<U+2013>28.}}</ref>

The events in 1536 surrounding the fate of the abbey at the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] are complicated, and included a dispute between Sir&nbsp;[[Piers Dutton]], who was in a powerful position as the [[Sheriff]] of Cheshire, and Sir&nbsp;William Brereton, the deputy-chamberlain of Chester. Dutton's estate was next to that of the abbey, and Dutton plotted to gain some of its land from the Crown after the dissolution, while Brereton supported the abbot against him. Initially the abbey was undervalued so that it could be classified as a minor monastery and dissolved in the first phase of the dissolution. In addition a campaign of vilification was directed at the canons, asserting that they were guilty of "debauched conduct".<ref name=s38>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=38.}}</ref> Then Dutton falsely accused the abbot and Brereton of issuing counterfeit coins. This charge was dismissed mainly because one of Dutton's witnesses was considered to be "unconvincing".<ref name=s38/> Nevertheless, it was decided that the abbey should be dissolved, and commissioners arrived at the abbey in early October 1536. There was considerable opposition and the commissioners were menaced by around 300&nbsp;local people. After barricading themselves in a tower, the commissioners managed to send a letter to Dutton, who arrived with a force of men in the middle of the night. Most of the rebels fled, but Dutton arrested the abbot and four of the canons, who were sent to [[Halton Castle]] and then to prison in Chester. Dutton sent a report of the events to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&nbsp;VIII]], who replied in letters to Dutton and Brereton that if the abbot and canons had behaved as Dutton reported, they should be executed as traitors. However events elsewhere in the country delayed the execution and, following an intercession to [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]], the abbot and canons were discharged and awarded pensions.<ref name=vch/><ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=69<U+2013>72.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=38<U+2013>39.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Nickson|1887|pp=32<U+2013>38.}}</ref> The abbey was made uninhabitable, the lead from the roof, the bell metal, and other valuable materials were confiscated for the king, and the building lay empty for nine years.<ref name=s39>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=39.}}</ref> The estate came into the ownership of the Crown, and it was managed by Brereton.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=441.}}</ref> From the evidence of damage to the tiled floor of the church, Brown and Howard-Davis conclude it is likely that the church was demolished at an early stage, but otherwise the archaeological evidence for this period is sparse and largely negative.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=197<U+2013>199.}}</ref>

===Country house===
[[File:Norton Priory Tudor House.jpg|thumb|300px|Engraving of the [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] house from the west by the [[Samuel and Nathaniel Buck|Buck brothers]], dated 1727|alt=A courtyard showing a range at the back that includes a tower, a stairway leading to an arched entrance, and a range of half-timbered buildings. On the left side is a towered gateway and a narrow turret; to the right is a two-storey building with battlements, and a stair turret.]]
In 1545 the abbey and the manor of Norton were sold to Sir [[Richard Brooke (Norton)|Richard Brooke]] for a little over <U+00A3>1,512 (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1512|1545|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=-4}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}} Brooke built a house in [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] style, which became known as Norton Hall, using as its core the former abbot's lodgings and the west range of the monastic buildings.<ref name=bhd200>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=200.}}</ref> It is not certain which other monastic buildings remained when the abbey was bought by the Brookes; excavations suggest that the [[cloister]]s were still present. A 17th-century sketch plan by one of the [[Randle Holme]] family shows that the gatehouse remained at that time, although almost all the church had been demolished. An engraving by the [[Samuel and Nathaniel Buck|Buck brothers]] dated 1727 shows that little changed by the next century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=202.}}</ref>

During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] the house was attacked by a force of [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. The Brookes were the first family in north Cheshire to declare allegiance to the [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] side. [[Halton Castle]] was a short distance away, and was held by [[John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers|Earl Rivers]] for the Royalists. In February 1643 a large force from the castle armed with cannon attacked the house, which was defended by only 80&nbsp;men. Henry Brooke successfully defended the house, with only one man wounded, while the Royalists lost 16&nbsp;men including their cannonier (gunner). They burnt two barns and plundered Brooke's tenants, but "returned home with shame and the hatred of the country".<ref>{{Harvnb|Ormerod|1882|p=1:lxii.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=57.}}</ref>

At some time between 1727 and 1757 the Tudor house was demolished and replaced by a new house in [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style.<ref name=bhd32/> The house had an L-plan, the main wing facing west standing on the footprint of the Tudor house, with a south wing at right-angles to it. The ground floor of the west wing retained the former [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] [[undercroft]] of the west range of the medieval abbey, and contained the kitchens and areas for the storage of wines and beers. The first floor was the [[piano nobile]], containing the main reception rooms. The west front was symmetrical, in three storeys, with a double flight of stairs leading up to the main entrance.<ref>Morriss, R. in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=220.}}</ref> Clearance of the other surviving remnants of the monastic buildings had started but the moated enclosures were still in existence at that time. A drawing dated 1770 shows that by then all these buildings and the moats had been cleared away, and the former fishponds were being used for pleasure boating.<ref name=bhd32>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=32.}}</ref> Between 1757 and the early 1770s modifications were made to the house, the main one being the addition of a north wing.<ref>Morriss, R. in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=221<U+2013>222.}}</ref> According to the authors of the ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of England]]'' series, the architect responsible for this was [[James Wyatt]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hartwell|Hyde|Hubbard|Pevsner|2011|pp=568<U+2013>569.}}</ref> Also between 1757 and 1770, the Brooke family built a [[walled garden]] at a distance from the house to provide fruit, vegetables and flowers.<ref name=wallg>{{citation |url=http://www.nortonpriory.org/explore/walledgarden |title=Walled Garden |accessdate=11&nbsp;July 2008 |publisher= Norton Priory Museum & Gardens }}</ref> The family also developed the woodland around the house, creating pathways, a stream-glade and a rock garden.<ref name=garden>{{citation |url=http://www.greatbritishgardens.co.uk/norton_priory.htm |title=Norton Priory |accessdate=11&nbsp;July 2008 |publisher=Web Publications }}</ref> Brick-built wine bins were added to the undercroft, developing it into a wine cellar, and [[barrel vault]]ing was added to the former entrance hall to the abbey (which was known as the outer parlour), obscuring its [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]].<ref name="HowardDavis2008a">Morriss, R. in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=225.}}</ref>

During the mid-18th century, Sir&nbsp;Richard Brooke was involved in a campaign to prevent the [[Bridgewater Canal]] from being built through his estate. The Bridgewater Canal Extension Act had been passed in 1762, and it made allowances for limited disturbance to the Norton estate. However Sir&nbsp;Richard did not see the necessity for the canal and opposed its passing though his estate. In 1773 the canal was opened from [[Manchester]] to Runcorn, except for {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} across the estate, which meant that goods had to be unloaded and carted around it. Eventually Sir&nbsp;Richard capitulated, and the canal was completed throughout its length by March 1776.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=126.}}</ref>
[[File:Norton Priory wine bins.jpg|thumb|Wine bins in the undercroft|alt=Two brick-built arched wine bins, each divided into four sections, the lower ones being larger than the upper]]
By 1853 a service range had been added to the south wing of the house. In 1868 the external flight of stairs was removed from the west front and a new porch entrance was added to its ground floor.<ref name=bhd225>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=225.}}</ref> The entrance featured a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] doorway that had been moved from elsewhere in the monastery; Greene believes that it probably formed the entrance from the west cloister walk into the [[nave]] of the church.<ref name=g102>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=102<U+2013>105.}}</ref> An exact replica of this doorway was built and placed to the north of the Norman doorway, making a double entrance. The whole of the undercroft was radically restored, giving it a [[English Gothic architecture|Gothic]] theme, adding stained glass windows and a medieval-style fireplace. The ground to the south of the house was levelled and formal gardens were established.<ref name=bhd225/><ref>Morriss, R. in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=226<U+2013>228.}}</ref>

During the 19th&nbsp;century the estate was again affected by transport projects. In 1804 the [[Runcorn to Latchford Canal]] was opened, replacing the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]]; this cut off the northern part of the estate, making it only accessible by a bridge. The [[Grand Junction Railway]] was built across the estate in 1837, followed by the [[Chester-Manchester Line|Warrington and Chester Railway]], which opened in 1850; both of these lines affected the southeast part of the estate. In 1894, the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was replaced by the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], and the northern part of the estate could only be accessed by a [[swing bridge]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=34.}}</ref> The Brooke family left the house in 1921, and it was almost completely demolished in 1928. Rubble from the house was used in the foundations of a new chemical works. During the demolition, the undercroft was retained and roofed with a cap of concrete. In 1966 the current Sir&nbsp;Richard Brooke gave Norton Priory in trust for the benefit of the public.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=39<U+2013>40.}}</ref>

===Excavations and museum===
In 1971 J. Patrick Greene was given a contract to carry out a six-month [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] for Runcorn Development Corporation as part of a plan to develop a park in the centre of Runcorn New Town. The site consisted of a {{convert|500|acre|0|adj=on|lnk=on}} area of fields and woods to the north of the [[Bridgewater Canal]]. Greene's initial findings led to his being employed for a further 12&nbsp;years to supervise a major excavation of the site. The buildings found included the Norman doorway with its [[Victorian era|Victorian]] addition and three medieval rooms. Specialists were employed and local volunteers were recruited to assist with the excavation, while teams of supervised prisoners were used to perform some of the heavier work. The area excavated exceeded that at any European monastic site that used modern methods.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=ix.}}</ref> The Development Corporation decided to create a museum on the site, and in 1975 Norton Priory Museum Trust was established.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=x.}}</ref>

In 1989 Greene published his book about the excavations entitled ''Norton Priory: The Archaeology of a Medieval Religious House''. Further work has been carried out, recording and analysing the archaeological findings. In 2008 Fraser Brown and Christine Howard-Davis published ''Norton Priory: Monastery to Museum'', in which the findings are described in more detail. Howard-Davis was largely responsible for the post-excavation assessment and for compiling a database for the artifacts and, with Brown, for their analysis.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=xxi.}}</ref>

==Findings from excavations==
===Priory 1134<U+2013>1236===
The excavations have revealed information about the original priory buildings and grounds, and how they were subsequently modified.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=73.}}</ref> A series of ditches was found that would have provided a supply of fresh water and also a means for drainage of a relatively wet site.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=35<U+2013>38.}}</ref> Evidence of the earliest temporary timber buildings in which the canons were originally housed was found in the form of 12th-century [[Posthole|post pits]]. Norton Priory is one of few monastic sites to have produced evidence of temporary quarters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=73<U+2013>79.}}</ref> The remains of at least seven temporary buildings have been discovered. It is considered that the largest of these, because it had more substantial foundations than the others, was probably the [[timber framing|timber framed]] church; another was most likely the [[gatehouse]], and the other buildings provided accommodation for the canons and the senior [[Secularity|secular]] craftsmen.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=38<U+2013>41.}}</ref>
[[File:Norton Priory Undercroft.jpg|thumb|left|[[Norman architecture|Norman]] doorway in the [[undercroft]]|alt=A highly decorated arched Norman doorway with a further, lower, arch beyond leading to a room with a window containing stained glass.]]
The earliest masonry building was the church, which was constructed on shallow foundations of [[sandstone]] rubble and pebbles on [[boulder clay]]. The walls were built in local red sandstone with [[ashlar]] faces and a rubble and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] core.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=80.}}</ref> The ground plan of the original church was [[cruciform]], and consisted of a [[nave]] without [[aisle]]s, a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] at the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]] with a tower above it, a square-ended [[chancel]], and north and south [[transept]]s, each with an eastern chapel. The total length of the church was {{convert|148|ft|m|1}} and the total length across the transepts was {{convert|74|ft|m|1}}, giving a ratio of 2:1. The walls of the church were {{convert|5|ft|m|1}} wide at the base, and the crossing tower was supported on four [[Pier (architecture)|piers]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=81<U+2013>87.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=46<U+2013>50.}}</ref>

The other early buildings were built surrounding a [[cloister]] to the south of the church. The east range incorporated the [[chapter house]] and also contained the [[sacristy]], the canons' dormitory and the [[reredorter]]. The upper storey of the west range provided living accommodation for the prior and an area where secular visitors could be received. In the lower storey was the undercroft where food and fuel were stored. The south range contained the [[refectory]], and at a distance from the south range stood the kitchen.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=87<U+2013>89.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=54<U+2013>63.}}</ref> Evidence of a [[Church bell|bell]] [[foundry]] dating from this period was found {{convert|55|yd|m|0}} to the north of the church.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=93.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=50<U+2013>51.}}</ref> It is likely that this was used for [[casting]] a tenor bell.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=428.}}</ref> A few moulded stones from this early period were found. These included nine blocks that probably formed part of a [[Corbel#Corbel tables|corbel table]]. There were also two beak-head [[voussoir]]s; this type of voussoir is rare in Cheshire, and has been found in only one other church in the county.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=90<U+2013>93.}}</ref>

Considerable expansion occurred during the last two decades of the 12th&nbsp;century and the first two or three decades of the 13th&nbsp;century. The south and west ranges were demolished and rebuilt, enlarging the cloister from about {{convert|36|ft|m|0}} by {{convert|32|ft|m|0}} to about {{convert|56|ft|m|0}} by {{convert|52|ft|m|0}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=63.}}</ref> This meant that a door in the south wall of the church had to be blocked off and a new highly decorated doorway was built at the northeast corner of the cloister; this doorway has survived.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=64.}}</ref> The lower storey of the west range, the other standing remains of the priory, also dates from this period; it comprises the [[Obedientiaries|cellarer's]] undercroft and a passage to its north, known as the outer parlour. The outer parlour had been the entrance to the priory from the outside world, and was "sumptuously decorated" so that "the power and wealth of the priory could be displayed in tangible fashion to those coming from the secular world".<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=66.}}</ref> The undercroft, used for storage, was divided into two chambers, and its decoration was much plainer. The upper floor has been lost; it is considered that this contained the prior's living quarters and, possibly, a chapel over the outer parlour.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=66<U+2013>70.}}</ref> A new and larger reredorter was built at the end of the east range, and it is believed that work might have started on a new chapter house.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=71.}}</ref> A system of stone drains was constructed to replace the previous open ditches.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=72.}}</ref> The west wall of the church was demolished and replaced by a more massive structure, {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} thick at the base. The east wall was also demolished and the chancel was extended, forming an additional area measuring approximately {{convert|27|ft|m|0}} by {{convert|23|ft|m|0}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=75<U+2013>76.}}</ref>

===Priory and abbey 1236<U+2013>1536===
The excavation revealed evidence of the fire of 1236, including ash, charcoal, burnt planks and a burnt wooden bowl. It is thought that the fire probably started in the timber-built kitchens at the junction of the west and south ranges, and then spread to the monastic buildings and church. Most of the wood in the buildings, including the furnishings and roofs, would have been destroyed, although the masonry walls remained largely intact. The major repairs required gave an opportunity for the extension of the church by the addition of new chapels to both of the transepts, and its refurbishment in a manner even grander than previously.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=110.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=79<U+2013>82.}}</ref> The cloister had been badly damaged in the fire and its arcade was rebuilt on the previous foundations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=82.}}</ref> The new arcade was of "very high quality and finely wrought construction".<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=79.}}</ref> Brown and Howard-Davis state that the kitchens were rebuilt on the same site and it appears that they were rebuilt in timber yet again.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=87<U+2013>88.}}</ref> Excavations have found evidence of a second bell foundry in the northwest of the priory grounds. The date of this is uncertain but Greene suggests that it was built to cast a new bell to replace the original one that was damaged in the fire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=118.}}</ref> Later in the 13th&nbsp;century another chapel was added to the north transept.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=91.}}</ref> Accommodation for guests was constructed to the southwest of the monastic buildings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=92<U+2013>93.}}</ref>

In the later part of the 13th&nbsp;century and during the following century the chapel in the south transept was replaced by a grander two-chambered chapel. This balanced the enlarged chapels in the north transept, restoring the church's cruciform plan. Around this time the east end of the church was further extended when a [[reliquary]] chapel was added measuring about {{convert|42|ft|m|0}} by {{convert|24|ft|m|0}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=97<U+2013>99.}}</ref> A guest hall was built to the west of the earlier guest quarters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=103<U+2013>104.}}</ref> After the status of the foundation was elevated from a priory to an abbey, a [[tower house]] was added to the west range. This is shown on the engraving by the Buck brothers, but it has left little in the way of archaeological remains.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=106, 108<U+2013>110.}}</ref> The church was extended by the addition of a north [[aisle]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=106<U+2013>108.}}</ref> There is little evidence of later major alterations before the dissolution. There is evidence to suggest that the cloister was rebuilt, and that alterations were made to the east range.<ref name="HowardDavis2008">{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=112<U+2013>115.}}</ref>

===Burials===
[[File:Norton Priory coffins.jpg|thumb|300px|Coffins found at Norton Priory|alt=Two open stone coffins lying at an angle to each other, the one in the foreground being badly cracked. In front of them is the lower part of the trunk of a tree.]]
The excavations revealed information about the burials carried out within the church and the monastic buildings, and in the surrounding grounds. They are considered to be "either those of Augustinian canons, privileged members of their lay household, or of important members of the Dutton family".<ref name=bhd117>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=117.}}</ref> Most burials were in stone coffins or in wooden coffins with stone lids, and had been carried out from the late 12th&nbsp;century up to the time of the dissolution.<ref name=bhd117/> The site of the burial depended on the status of the individual, whether they were clerical or lay, and their degree of importance. Priors, abbots, and high-ranking canons were buried within the church, with those towards the east end of the church being the most important. Other canons were buried in a graveyard outside the church, in an area to the south and east of the chancel. Members of the laity were buried either in the church, towards the west end of the nave or in the north aisle, or outside the church around its west end. It is possible that there was a lay cemetery to the north and west of the church.<ref name="HowardDavis2008" /> The addition of the chapels to the north transept, and their expansion, was carried out for the Dutton family,<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=79, 100.}}</ref> making it their burial chapel,<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=12.}}</ref> or family [[mausoleum]],<ref>Butler, Lawrence, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=148.}}</ref> and the highest concentration of burials was found in this part of the church.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=116.}}</ref> It is considered that the north aisle, built after the priory became an abbey, was added to provide a burial place for members of the laity.<ref name=bhd117/>

The excavations revealed 49&nbsp;stone coffins, 30&nbsp;coffin lids, and five headstones. Twelve of the lids were carved in [[Relief|high relief]], with designs including flowers or foliage. One lid depicts an oak tree issuing from a human head in the style of a [[green man]], another has a cross, a dragon and a female [[effigy]], while others have shield and sword motifs. Two contain inscriptions in Norman-French, identifying the deceased. The remaining lids have simpler incised patterns, mainly decorated crosses. The headstones contain crosses.<ref>Butler, Lawrence, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=138<U+2013>147.}}</ref> Most of the coffins were sunk into the ground, with the lid at the level of the floor, although a few were found within the walls. Only three stone coffins for children were discovered. These lay in a group, together with a coffin containing a male skeleton, in the vestibule leading to the enlarged chapter house. The most prestigious type of coffin was tapered towards the feet, with the head end carved externally to a hemi-hexagonal shape. Another sign of higher status was the provision of an internal "pillow" for the head.<ref>Butler, Lawrence, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=147<U+2013>148.}}</ref>
[[File:Norton Priory coffin lids.jpg|thumb|left|Carved coffin lids|alt=Five tapering coffin lids and a circular object. All are carved with a variety of types of decorated crosses.]]
A total of 144&nbsp;graves was excavated; they contained 130&nbsp;articulated skeletons in a suitable condition for examination.<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=149.}}</ref> Of these, 36&nbsp;were well-preserved, 48&nbsp;were in a fair condition and 46&nbsp;were poorly preserved.<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=151.}}</ref> Males out-numbered females by a ratio of three to one, an expected ratio in a monastic site. Most of the males had survived into middle age (36<U+2013>45&nbsp;years) to old age (46&nbsp;years or older), while equal numbers of females died before and after the age of about 45&nbsp;years. One female death was presumably due to a complication of pregnancy as she had been carrying a 34-week [[Fetus|foetus]].<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=152<U+2013>153.}}</ref> The average height of the adult males was {{convert|5|ft|8|in|m|2}} and that of the adult females was {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m|2}}.<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=154.}}</ref>

The bones show a variety of diseases and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of [[Paget's disease of bone]] (''osteitis deformans'').<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=160<U+2013>161.}}</ref> The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a [[knight]].<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=118, 160<U+2013>161.}}</ref> One skeleton showed signs of [[leprosy]] affecting bones in the face, hands and feet.<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=164<U+2013>166.}}</ref> No definite cases of [[tuberculosis]] directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs.<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=166<U+2013>167.}}</ref> The only major [[congenital abnormality]] found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of [[Down syndrome|Down's syndrome]]. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19&nbsp;skeletons, ten of which were cases of ''[[Spina bifida#Spina bifida occulta|spina bifida occulta]]''. Other spinal abnormalities included fused [[vertebra]]e, [[spondylolysis]] and [[Congenital vertebral anomaly#Transitional vertebrae|transitional vertebrae]].<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=168<U+2013>170.}}</ref> Definite evidence of [[Bone fracture|fractured bones]] was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases.<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=170<U+2013>171.}}</ref> One cranium contained a large circular lesion which may have been the consequence of [[trepanning]].<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=172.}}</ref> Other diseases specific to bones and joints were [[osteoarthritis]], diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of [[spondyloarthropathy]].<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=172<U+2013>177.}}</ref> Three skeletons showed possible evidence of [[rickets]], two had changes of [[osteoporosis]], and three crania had features of ''hyperostosis frontalis interna'', a [[Metabolism|metabolic]] condition affecting post-[[Menopause|menopausal]] women.<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=178<U+2013>179.}}</ref> [[Osteoma]]ta (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.<ref>Boylston, Anthea, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=179<U+2013>180.}}</ref>

Examination of the jaws and teeth gave information about the dental health of those buried in the priory. The degree of wear of teeth was greater than it is at present, while the incidence of [[dental caries]] was much lower than it is now, as was the incidence of [[periodontal disease]]. A consequence of the wear of the teeth was "compensatory eruption" of the teeth in order to keep contact with the opposing teeth. It was concluded that the people buried in the priory had few problems with their teeth or jaws. Loss of teeth was due to wear of the teeth, rather than from caries or periodontal disease.<ref>Ogden, Alan, in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=183<U+2013>195.}}</ref>

===Country house===
Little archaeological evidence relates to the period immediately after the dissolution, or to the Tudor house built on part of the site.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=197, 204.}}</ref> A [[Saw pit|sawpit]] was found in the outer courtyard. It is considered that this might date from the early period of the Brookes' house, or it may have been constructed during the later years of the abbey.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=200, 213.}}</ref> The kitchens to the south of the Tudor house and their drainage systems appear to have been used by the Brookes, and according to Brown and Howard-Davis, were possibly rebuilt by the family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=207.}}</ref> The areas previously occupied by the cloisters and the guest quarters were probably used as [[midden]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=207<U+2013>212.}}</ref> Few archaeological findings remain from the Georgian house, apart from a fragment of a wall from the south front,<ref>Morriss, R. in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=219.}}</ref> and the foundations of the north wing.<ref name="HowardDavis2008a" /> The much-altered medieval undercroft still stands, with its Norman doorway and Victorian replica, barrel vaulting, wine bins, and blind arcading in the former outer parlour.<ref>Johnson, Nick. in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=228<U+2013>230.}}</ref>

===Artifacts from the buildings===
[[File:Norton Priory tiles.jpg|thumb|Montage of [[mosaic]] tiles in the museum|alt=An array of tiles of differing shapes and colours]]
A large number of tiles and tile fragments that had lined the floor of the church and some of the monastic buildings were found in the excavations.<ref>Keen, Laurence in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=231<U+2013>282.}}</ref> The oldest tiles date from the early 14th&nbsp;century. The total area of tiles discovered was about {{convert|80|m2|ft2}}, and is "the largest area of a floor of this type to be found in any modern excavation".<ref name=greene133/> The site has "the largest, and most varied, excavated collection of medieval tiles in the North West" and "the greatest variety of individual mosaic shapes found anywhere in Britain".<ref>Keen, Laurence in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=282.}}</ref> The tiles found made a [[Pavement (architecture)|pavement]] forming the floor of the choir of the church and the transepts. The chancel floor was probably also tiled; these tiles have not survived because the chancel was at a higher level than the rest of the church, and the tiles would have been have been removed during subsequent gardening. A dump of tiles to the south of the site of the chapter house suggests that this was also tiled.<ref name=greene133>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=133.}}</ref> In the 15th&nbsp;century a second tile floor was laid on top of the original floor in the choir where it had become worn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=148.}}</ref> The tiles on the original floor were of various shapes, forming a [[mosaic]].<ref name=greene133/> The tiles were all [[Ceramic glaze|glazed]] and coloured, the main colours being black, green and yellow. Many of them had been decorated by impressing a wooden stamp into the moist clay before it was fired; these are known as line-impressed tiles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=133<U+2013>136.}}</ref> The line-impressed designs included masks of lions or other animals, rosettes, and [[trefoil]]s.<ref>Keen, Laurence in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=245<U+2013>246.}}</ref> Other tiles or tile fragments showed portions of trees, foliage, birds and inscriptions.<ref>Keen, Laurence in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=250<U+2013>257.}}</ref> In the chapels of the north transept, the burial place of the Dutton family, were tiles depicting [[Mail (armour)|mail]], thought to be part of a military [[effigy]], and tiles bearing fragments of [[Heraldry|heraldic]] designs.<ref>Keen, Laurence in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=257<U+2013>261.}}</ref> The tiles from the upper (later) pavement were all square, and again were line-inscribed with patterns forming parts of larger designs.<ref>Keen, Laurence in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=267<U+2013>271.}}</ref> A related discovery at the excavation was the [[kiln]] in which most of the tiles on the site were fired.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=136.}}</ref>
[[File:Norton Priory capital.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Capital (architecture)|Capital]] and [[spandrel]] from reconstructed [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] in the museum|alt=The top of a column and base of two arches. In the spandrel is a carving of an otter-like creature; the capital is decorated with a carved head and foliage]]
The excavations also revealed stones or fragments of carved stone dating from the 12th to the 16th&nbsp;centuries.<ref>Harrison, Stuart in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=282.}}</ref> The earliest are in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style and include two [[voussoir]]s decorated with beakheads (grotesque animal heads with long pointed bird-like beaks). Other stones dating from the 12th&nbsp;century are in [[English Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style; they include a [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] decorated with leaves and a portion of the [[tracery]] from a [[rose window]].<ref>Harrison, Stuart in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=283<U+2013>292.}}</ref> Many of the stones from the 13th&nbsp;century were originally part of the cloister arcade, and had been re-used to form the core of a later cloister arcade. They include stones sculpted with depictions of humans and animals. The best preserved of these are the heads of two canons, each wearing a [[cowl]] with the [[tonsure]] visible, the head of a woman with shoulder-length hair, parts of a seated figure holding an open book, and a creature that might represent a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] or an [[otter]].<ref>Harrison, Stuart in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=293<U+2013>297.}}</ref> There are numerous fragments dating from the 14th and 15th&nbsp;centuries. These include portions of [[Course (architecture)#String course|string courses]], tracery, [[corbel]]s, window jambs, and arch heads. At least three of the corbels were carved in the form of human heads.<ref>Harrison, Stuart in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=302<U+2013>314.}}</ref> Over 1,500&nbsp;fragments of painted medieval glass were found, most of it in a poor condition. These show that the glazing scheme used in the priory was mainly in [[grisaille]] ([[monochrome]]) style.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=324<U+2013>328.}}</ref> Almost 1,300&nbsp;fragments of glass from later periods,<ref>Vose, Ruth Hurst in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=328<U+2013>329.}}</ref> and nearly 1,150&nbsp;[[sherd]]s of [[ceramic]] roof tiles were also found.<ref>Dawson, Jo, with McPhillips, Sean in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=329<U+2013>332.}}</ref>

===Artifacts from daily life===
Some 500&nbsp;fragments of pottery were found dating from the medieval period. Most of these were parts of jars, jugs or [[pipkin]]s and were found in the area of the kitchen range. Most of it was produced locally, although 13&nbsp;sherds of [[Stamford Ware]], fragments of two jugs from North France, and two small pieces of [[Saintonge#Pottery|Saintonge pottery]] have been identified. Only a few wooden bowls were recovered.<ref>Vaughan, Jenny in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=333<U+2013>344.}}</ref> Much more pottery was found dating from the post-medieval period and later. Again most of this had been manufactured in England, especially in [[Staffordshire]]. Fragments of pottery from abroad included pieces from a [[Westerwald]] mug, a jug from [[Cologne]] and items of Chinese [[porcelain]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=344<U+2013>117.}}</ref> The excavations produced over 4,000&nbsp;sherds of glass, dating from the 12th to the 20th&nbsp;centuries, but only 16 of these came from the period before the dissolution.<ref>Vose, Ruth Hurst in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=358<U+2013>370.}}</ref> A total of 1,170&nbsp;fragments from [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)#Clay|clay tobacco pipes]] were found, dating from about 1580 to the early 20th&nbsp;century.<ref>Davey, Peter J. in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=371<U+2013>373.}}</ref>

Six medieval coins were recovered, the earliest of which was a silver [[penny]] of [[John of England|John]] from the early 13th&nbsp;century. Coins from later periods were a silver [[Threepence (British coin)|threepence]] from the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and a silver penny from [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Only low-denomination coins were found from the 18th&nbsp;century and later, including a 10-[[pfennig]] piece from Germany dated 1901.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=375<U+2013>376.}}</ref> Two silver spoons were recovered, one of which was dated 1846 from the [[hallmark]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=376.}}</ref> Objects made from [[copper alloy]] were found, many of which were associated with personal adornment and dress including brooches, buckles, and buttons. Also found from this period was a small simple chape ([[scabbard]] tip), and part of a [[Skimmer (machine)|skimmer]] that had been used in the kitchen.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=376<U+2013>390.}}</ref> Artifacts made from iron, other than nails, were again mainly items of personal adornment and dress. Other identifiable iron items from this period included keys, two possible rowel [[spur]]s (spurs with revolving pointed wheels), and about 12&nbsp;[[horseshoe]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=390<U+2013>395.}}</ref>

Nearly 2,000&nbsp;fragments of lead were found, 940&nbsp;of which were droplets of melted metal, some of these being a consequence of the fire in 1236. One of the earliest artifacts was a [[papal bull]]a dating from the rule of [[Pope Clement III]] (1187<U+2013>91). Two other possible [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] were discovered. A total of 15&nbsp;lead discs were recovered, some of which were inscribed with crosses. Two of these were found in graves, but the purpose of the discs has not been reliably explained. The other lead artifacts from this period were associated with the structure of the buildings and include fragments of kame (the lead used in [[Leadlight|leaded windows]]), ventilator grills, and water pipes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=395<U+2013>403.}}</ref> Leather fragments almost all came from shoes, and included an almost complete child's shoe dating from the late 16th or the 17th&nbsp;century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=403<U+2013>408.}}</ref> Another find was a small [[gemstone]], a [[cabochon]] (polished) [[onyx|sardonyx]].<ref>Howard-Davis, Christine and Bowden, Alan in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=418<U+2013>420.}}</ref>

==Present day==
Norton Priory is considered to be "a monastic site of international importance" and is "the most extensively excavated monastic site in Britain, if not Western Europe".<ref name="HowardDavis2008b" /> It is open to the public and run by a [[charitable trust]], the Norton Priory Museum Trust. The Trust was founded in 1975 and the museum was opened in 1982. The Trust owns and maintains many of the artifacts found during the excavations, and has created an electronic database to record all the acquisitions. In addition, it holds records relating to the excavations, including site notebooks and photographs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=6<U+2013>8.}}</ref> The area open to the public consists of a museum, the standing archaeological remains, an area of garden and woodland, and the walled garden of the former house.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.nortonpriory.org/| title = Norton Priory Museum & Gardens| accessdate = 6&nbsp;June 2010| publisher = Norton Priory Museum & Gardens}}</ref>

===Museum===
The museum contains information relating to the history of the site and some of the artifacts discovered during the excavations. These include a model of the church and the monastic buildings as they are thought to have appeared in their final form, carved coffin lids, mosaic tiles, and domestic items such as buttons. In a coffin lies one of the skeletons showing signs of [[Paget's disease of bone]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.nortonpriory.org/explore/museumandruins| title = Museum & Priory Ruins| accessdate = 13&nbsp;March 2010 | publisher = Norton Priory Museum & Gardens}}</ref> Standing in the museum is a reconstruction of the cloister arcade as it had been built following the fire of 1236. It consists of [[Molding (decorative)|moulded]] pointed arches with [[Springer (architecture)|springer]] blocks, [[voussoir]]s and apex stones, supported on triple shafts with foliate [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] and moulded bases. Above the capitals, at the bases of the arches, are sculptures that include depictions of human and animal heads. The human heads consist of two canons with hoods and protruding tonsures, other males, and females with shoulder-length hair. In one [[spandrel]] is a seated figure with an outstretched arm holding a book. Other carvings depict such subjects as fabulous beasts, and an otter or a snake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|pp=82<U+2013>84, 295<U+2013>298.}}</ref>

{{main|Statue of St Christopher (Norton Priory)}}

A separate purpose-built gallery contains the medieval sandstone statue of [[Saint Christopher]], which is considered to be "a work of national and even international importance".<ref>Marow, D. J. in {{Harvnb|Brown|Howard-Davis|2008|p=318.}}</ref> [[Saint Christopher]] was associated with the abbey because of its proximity to the River Mersey and the dangers associated with crossing the river.<ref name=vch/><ref>{{Harvnb|Nickson|1887|pp=5<U+2013>26.}}</ref> The statue shows the saint wading through fish-filled water carrying the Christ-child on his shoulder.<ref>Marrow D.

===Archaeological remains===
[[File:Norton Priory arcade.jpg|thumb|North arcade in the former outer parlour|alt=A blind arcade seen from an angle showing four round-headed arches supported on columns with carved capitals; a bench runs along the base]]
The archaeological remains are recognised as a Grade&nbsp;I [[listed building]] and a [[scheduled ancient monument]], and are considered to be the most important monastic remains in Cheshire.<ref>{{Citation |url= http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1130433|title= Remains of Norton Priory|year=2011 |work=The National Heritage List for England |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate= 22&nbsp;April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url= http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1015603|title= Augustinian Abbey known as Norton Priory|year=2011 |work=The National Heritage List for England |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate= 22&nbsp;April 2011}}</ref>  They consist of the former undercroft and the foundations of the church and monastic buildings that were exposed during the excavations. The undercroft stands outside the museum building. It is a single-storey structure consisting of seven pairs of [[bay (architecture)|bays]] divided into two compartments, one of four and the other of three bays. It is entered through the [[portico]] added to the west front of the country house in 1886 by way of a pair of arched doorways in [[Norman architecture|Norman]] style. The doorway to the right (south) is original, dating from the late 12th&nbsp;century, while the other doorway is a replica dated 1886.<ref name=crsbi>{{citation |url=http://www.crsbi.ac.uk/search/county/site/ed-ch-norpr.html |title= Norton Priory, Cheshire |accessdate=14&nbsp;March 2010 |publisher= The Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain and Ireland }}</ref> The older doorway has been described as "the finest decorated Norman doorway in Cheshire".<ref>{{Citation | quotes = | last =Thompson | first =F.

At the northern end of the undercroft is the passage known as the outer parlour. This has stone benches on each side and elaborately carved blind [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] above them. The arcades each consist of two groups of four round-headed arches with [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], free-standing [[column]]s and bases that are set on the benches. The capitals and [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]] of the arches are decorated with a variety of carvings, the capitals being predominantly late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] in style and the arches early [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=94<U+2013>100.}}</ref> The carvings include depictions of human heads, stiff-leaf foliage and animals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=111<U+2013>114.}}</ref>

===Grounds===
[[File:Norton Priory Loggia.jpg|thumb|left|Garden [[loggia]] in the grounds|alt=A open stone structure with four columns supporting a lintel. Inside the loggia is a wooden seat.]]
The {{convert|38|acre|0}} of grounds surrounding the house have been largely restored to include the 18th-century pathways, the stream-glade and the 19th-century rock garden.<ref name=garden/><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/showPlace.cfm?Place_ID=2163 |title=Norton Priory Museum & Gardens |accessdate=15&nbsp;March 2010 |publisher= Crawbar}}</ref> The foundations exposed in the excavations show the plan of the former church and monastic buildings.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.nortonpriory.org/files/Museum%20&%20Priory%20Ruins.pdf| title = The Priory Ruins | accessdate = 15&nbsp;March 2010| publisher = Norton Priory Museum & Gardens | pages = 3<U+2013>4}}</ref> In the grounds is a Grade&nbsp;II listed garden [[loggia]] in yellow sandstone, possibly designed by [[James Wyatt]]. At its front are two [[Doric order|Doric]] columns and two [[Anta (architecture)|antae]], and above these is a [[cornice]] with a fluted [[frieze]].
