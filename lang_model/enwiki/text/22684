"Stay" was voted the fourth greatest video of the decade on CMT.com

==Concept==
"Stay" is a ballad of [[infidelity]], taking the perspective of the mistress of a man who is cheating on his wife. It begins with the mistress's insistence that the man stay with her <U+2014> even if his wife should call and ask where he is <U+2014> because she (the mistress) is "so tired of being lonely". Although the man tells her that he will leave his wife for her, she refuses to believe him, telling him that "it's too much pain to have to bear / To love a man you have to share".

In the third verse, the mistress then changes her mind; according to Nettles, she (the woman in the song) "has her own sense of redemption and realizes she deserves more than being with someone who will never be fully hers".<ref name="weekly">{{cite journal |last=Gallagher |first=Pat |date=2008-02-11 |title=Story Behind the Song |journal=[[Country Weekly]] |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=64}}</ref> This change is revealed in the final chorus.

In the song, Nettles' vocals are accompanied by [[Kristian Bush]] (Sugarland's other member) on [[acoustic guitar]]; unlike most other Sugarland songs, Bush does not sing harmony vocals. The only other instrumentation in the song is an [[organ (instrument)|organ]], played by Bush's brother Brandon.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Enjoy the Ride |titlelink=Enjoy the Ride (Sugarland album) |others=Sugarland |year=2006 |publisher=Mercury Records |id=B0007411-02}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
"Stay", according to Nettles, was inspired by [[Reba McEntire]]'s 1986 single "[[Whoever's in New England (song)|Whoever's in New England]]", a ballad in which a wife addresses her unfaithful husband.<ref name="cmt"/> After hearing the song, Nettles thought that it would be an original approach to take the perspective of the "other woman" (i.e., the mistress), as very few country songs had ever done so.<ref name="cmt"/><ref name="weekly"/> Once she decided to take that perspective, the song "practically wrote itself".<ref name="cmt"/>

==Awards==
"Stay" has racked up numerous awards for Sugarland and Jennifer Nettles, as a writer. Most notable has been at the [[51st Grammy Awards]] where it won "[[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]" and "[[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]]". At the 2008 [[ACM Awards]] it won two awards for "Song of the Year" and "Single of the Year". At the 2008 [[CMA Awards]] it won "Song of the Year" and at the 2008 [[CMT Music Awards]] it won "Duo Video of the Year".

==Music video==
Directed by [[Shaun Silva]], the video for "Stay," features Nettles & Bush performing the song in front of an all-black background. According to Nettles, "We wanted to keep the video simple, but still show emotion, so we decided to base the video on performance, and that's all."
