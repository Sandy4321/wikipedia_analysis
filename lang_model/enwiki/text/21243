'''Farsley Celtic Association Football Club''' are an [[English football]] club based in [[Farsley]],  [[Leeds]] which was founded in [[1908]].  The club are known by the nicknames of the '''Villagers''' and the '''Celts'''; their colours are blue and white.  Currently the club is playing in the [[Conference North]] but have been promoted into the [[Conference National|Football Conference]] following their 4-3 victory against [[Hinckley United F.C.|Hinckley United]] on the [[14 May]] [[2007]].

The club have spent their entire existence to date in non-league football, where they have won several titles in [[Northern England]].  In the [[FA Cup]], the club has reached the First Round twice to play league opposition.

== History ==
Farsley Celtic was founded in [[1908 in football (soccer)|1908]] by a group of local men from the village of [[Farsley]].  During their earliest years, Farsley competed in local leagues around the [[Leeds]] area and Hospital Cups.  As the club moved into the [[1920s]] they moved to a more permanent ground at Red Lane, opposite Farsley Celtic Cricket Club. 

After the [[Second World War]] ended the club purchased their current ground of Throstle Nest from the local council, where they played their first match in [[1948]] against [[West Yorkshire]] side [[Frickley Athletic F.C.|Frickley Athletic]].

=== Yorkshire League ===
The Villagers moved up a level for the 1949-50 season, into the [[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire League Division Two]] where they finished 8th during their first season and scored 100 goals in 34 games, however they also conceded heavily<ref>[http://www.fchd.info/FARSLEYC.HTM FCHD.info]</ref>.  By the 1951-52 season Farsley Celtic were Yorkshire League Division Two champions and as thus, were promoted to the [[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire League Division One]], which was its top level.

By the mid-[[1950s]], Farsley had started to steady themeselves in the upper half of the Yorkshire League, in the [[FA Cup]] also they had a notable run during the 1954-55 season where they reached the Fourth Qualifying Round, going out to [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] 3-1.  After two consecutive seasons of finishing runners-up, Farsley were champions of the Yorkshire League in 1959-60, the club were not promoted however, due to failing to stand up to ground regulations. 

Through-out the [[1960s]] the club were stable within the Yorkshire League, always finishing within the top 7 places.  For the second times in their history, the Celts were crowned champions of the league in 1968-69 but again were not promoted to a higher level.  They came runners-up twice in the early 70s proving themselves to be among the best in the league. 

In the [[FA Cup]], Farsley Celtic reached the First Round in [[1974]], the game was against [[Football League Division Three]] side [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] at [[Elland Road]] before a crowd of 11,000, it ended 2-0 to Tranmere. The rest of the decade for the West Yorkshire club was largely unremarkable, they bounced between the Yorkshire League first and second divisions.

=== Northern Leagues: 1980s and 1990s ===
In 1982 the Yorkshire and Midland Leagues merged to form the [[Northern Counties East League]]. Celtic started in [[Northern Counties East Football League Division One|Division One North]] and for the first two seasons they finished 3rd, in 1984-85 they were won the Division One North championship and were promoted to the Northern Counties East [[Northern Counties East Football League Premier Division|Premier Division]]. 

It didn't take the club long to rise up that league either, after only two seasons in the NCEL Premier Division, they finished as runners-up to [[Alfreton Town F.C.|Alfreton Town]] and were invited into the [[Northern Premier League]] as founding members of the [[Northern Premier League First Division]].  Farsley's first slew of seasons in the Northern Premier League First Division often saw the club near the bottom end of the table, this pattern continued on until the mid to late [[1990s]] where they finished in the top six for three seasons in a row.

=== Upper regions of non-league ===
Farsley finished 3rd in the 2003-04 season and earned themselves promotion to the [[Northern Premier League Premier Division]].  Their stay in the Northern League Premier Division was short but productive, in their first season they finished 3rd and then the following season, after a fourth place finish they won promotion to the [[Conference North]] after defeating [[North Ferriby United A.F.C.|North Ferriby United]] 2-1 after extra time in the [[Northern Premier League]] play off final in [[May 2006]].

Farsley reached the First Round proper of the [[FA Cup]] for only the second time in their history, during the 2006-07 season, after beating [[Cambridge City F.C.|Cambridge City]] 2-1 in the 4th Qualifying Round. They were drawn against [[Milton Keynes Dons]] and held them to a 0-0 draw<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6125718.stm BBC.co.uk]</ref>, before being defeated 2-0 in a heated replay at the [[National Hockey Stadium]]<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6160930.stm BBC.co.uk]</ref>. In the Conference North, the club also performed well and reached the play-off finals after finishing in 5th, they played [[Hinckley United F.C.|Hinckley United]] for the chance to be promoted into the [[Conference National]] which they succeeded after winning 4-3 and are set to play in the Conference National for the 2007-08 season.<ref>

The promotion means that for the first time ever, only two leagues will separate them from locals [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] (just six miles away) and one league separates them from [[Bradford City F.C.|Bradford City]] who are four miles away from Farsley.
