The '''Salem witch trials''', begun in [[1692]] (also known as the Salem [[witch-hunt|witch hunt]] and the Salem Witchcraft Episode), resulted in a number of convictions and executions for [[witchcraft]] in both [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Salem Village]] and [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem Town]], [[Massachusetts]]. Some have argued it was the result of a period of factional infighting and [[Puritan]] witch hysteria. The trials resulted in the executions of 20 people (14 women, 6 men) and the imprisonment of between 175 and 200 people. In addition to those executed, at least five people died in prison. One man who refused to plead to the charges was pressed to death with rocks (the medieval torture of ''[[peine forte et dure]]'', which, if fatal, did not result in forfeiture of property). 

==Background==
In 1692, Salem Village was torn by internal disputes between neighbors who disagreed about the choice of [[Samuel Parris]] as their first ordained minister.  In January 1692, [[York, Maine|York]], at the "Eastward" frontier of Maine, was attacked by the [[Abenaki]] Indians, and many of its citizens were massacred or taken captive, echoing the brutality of [[King Philip's War]] of 1675-76.

Increasing family size fueled disputes over land between neighbors and within families, especially on the frontier where the economy was based on farming. Changes in the weather or blights could easily wipe out a year's crop. A farm that could support an average-sized family could not support the many families of the next generation, prompting farmers to push further into the wilderness to find farmland and encroach upon the indigenous peoples there.  As the Puritans had vowed to create a [[theocracy]] in this new land, religious fervor added another tension to the mix. Losses of crops, of livestock, and of children, as well as earthquakes and bad weather were typically attributed to the wrath of God. Within the Puritan faith, one's soul was considered predestined from birth as to whether it had been chosen for [[Heaven]] or condemned to [[Hell]]. Puritans constantly searched for hints to this [[predestination]], assuming God's pleasure and displeasure could be read in signs given in the visible world.  The invisible world was inhabited by God and the angels, including the [[Devil]], a fallen angel. To Puritans, this invisible world was as real to them as the visible one around them. 

The patriarchal beliefs that Puritans held in the community added further stresses. Women, they believed, should be totally subservient to men. By nature a woman was more likely to enlist in the Devil's service than a man was, and women were considered naturally lustful.

In addition, the small-town atmosphere made secrets very difficult to keep and people's opinions about their neighbors were generally accepted as fact. In an age where the philosophy "children should be seen and not heard" was taken at face value, children were at the bottom of the social ladder. Toys and games were seen as idle and playing was discouraged. Girls had additional restrictions heaped upon them. Boys were able to go hunting, fishing, exploring in the forest, and often became apprentices to carpenters and smiths, while girls were trained from a tender age to spin yarn, cook, sew, weave, and to generally be servants to their husbands and mothers to their children.

== Origin of trials ==

[[Image:Salem Village - map of - Project Gutenberg eText 17845.jpg|thumb|Map of Salem Village, 1692]]
In the village of Salem in 1692, [[Betty Parris]], age 9, and her cousin [[Abigail Williams]], age 11, the daughter and niece (respectively) of Reverend [[Samuel Parris]], fell victim to what was recorded as fits "beyond the power of Epileptic Fits or natural disease to effect," according to [[John Hale (witch hunter)|John Hale]], minister in Beverly, in his book ''A Modest Enquiry into the Nature of Witchcraft'' ([[Boston]], [[1702]]). The girls screamed, threw things about the room, uttered strange sounds, crawled under furniture, and contorted themselves into peculiar positions. They complained of being pricked with pins or cut with knives, and when Reverend [[Samuel Parris]] would preach, the girls would cover their ears, as if dreading to hear the sermons.  A doctor, historically assumed to be [[William Griggs]], could find no physical evidence of any ailment. Others in the village began to exhibit the same symptoms.

In his book ''Memorable Providences Relating to Witchcrafts and Possessions'' (1689) , [[Cotton Mather]] describes the strange behavior exhibited by the four children of a Boston mason, [[John Goodwin]], and attributed it to witchcraft practiced upon them by an Irish washerwoman, Mary Glover. Mather, a minister of [[Boston]]'s North Church (not to be confused with the Episcopalian Old North Church of Paul Revere fame), was a prolific publisher of pamphlets and a firm believer in [[witchcraft]]. Three of the five judges appointed to the Court of [[Oyer and Terminer]] were friends of his and members of his congregation. He wrote to one of the judges, [[John Richards]], supporting the prosecutions, but cautioning him of the dangers of relying on [[spectral evidence]] and advising the court on how to proceed. Mather was present at the execution of the Reverend [[George Burroughs]] for [[witchcraft]] on [[August 19]], [[1692]], and intervened after the condemned man had successfully recited [[the Lord's Prayer]] (supposedly a sign of innocence) to remind the crowd that the man had been convicted before a jury. Mather was asked by Governor Phipps in September to write about the trials, and obtained access to the official records of the Salem trials from his friend Stephen Sewall, clerk of the court, upon which his account of the affair, ''Wonders of the Invisible World'', was based.

Traditionally, the affected girls are said to have been "entertained" by Parris' slave woman [[Tituba]], during the winter of 1692, although there is no contemporary evidence to support the story (Reis 56). Tituba's race is also often cited as Carib-Indian or that she was of African descent, but contemporary sources describe her only as an "Indian."  Research by [[Elaine Breslaw]] has suggested that she may well have been captured in what is now [[Venezuela]] and brought to [[Barbados]], and so may have been an [[Arawak]] Indian, but other slightly later descriptions of her, by Gov. Hutchinson writing his history of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in the [[18th century]], describe her as a "[[Spain|Spanish]] Indian." In that day, that typically meant an Indian from the Carolinas/[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]/[[Florida]]. Contrary to the [[folklore]], there is no evidence whatsoever to support the assertion that Tituba told any of the girls any stories about using [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. The one supportable association with any kind of magical practices is that John Indian, another slave in the Parris household and assumed to have been Tituba's husband, was told a recipe for discovering the identity of a [[witch]], a British recipe given to him by a neighbor of the parsonage.  

The first three people accused and arrested for allegedly afflicting Betty Parris, Abigail Williams, 12-year-old [[Ann Putnam, Jr.]] and [[Elizabeth Hubbard]] were [[Sarah Good]], [[Sarah Osburne]] and Tituba (Boyer 3) <ref>See the warrants for their arrests [http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/essex/ecca/vol1/small/004_0001.jpg here] and [http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/essex/ecca/vol1/small/033_0001.jpg here].</ref>. Tituba, as a slave of a different ethnicity than the [[Puritans]], was an obvious target for accusations. Sarah Good, a poverty-worn, easily-angered woman, often muttered under her breath as she walked away from failed attempts of obtaining food and/or shelter from neighbors and people interpreted her muttering as curses. Sarah Osburne, an irritable old woman, was already marked for marrying her [[indentured servant]]. All of these women fit the description of the "usual suspects," since nobody would likely stand up for them; neither Osburne nor Good attended church, which made them especially vulnerable to accusations of witchcraft. 

These women were brought before the local magistrates on the complaint of witchcraft and interrogated for several days, starting on [[March 1]], [[1692]], then sent to jail (Boyer 3). Other accusations followed in March: [[Martha Corey]], [[Rebecca Nurse]], [[Dorcas Good|Dorothy Good]]<ref>incorrectly called [[Dorcas Good]] in her arrest warrant</ref>, and [[Rachel Clinton]]. Martha Corey, ever an outspoken woman, was skeptical about the credence of the girls from the start and scoffed at the hearings by the magistrates, unfortunately drawing attention to herself. Dorothy Good, the daughter of [[Sarah Good]], was only 4 years old, and easily manipulated by the magistrates to say things that were taken as a confession, implicating her own mother. In order to be with her mother after the accusations, she claimed to herself be a witch, thereby she was arrested. The charges against Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey greatly disturbed the community. Martha Corey was a full covenanted member of the Church in [[Salem Village]], as was [[Rebecca Nurse]] in the Church in [[Salem Town]]. If such upstanding people could be accused of witchcraft and seen as possible witches, then anybody could be a witch and Church membership was no protection from accusation.

Throughout April, many more were arrested: [[Sarah Cloyce]] (Nurse's sister), [[Elizabeth Proctor|Elizabeth (Bassett) Proctor]] and her husband [[John Proctor]], [[Giles Corey]] (Martha's husband, and a covenanted church member in Salem Town), [[Abigail Hobbs]], [[Bridget Bishop]], [[Mary Warren]] (a servant in the Proctor household and sometime accuser herself), [[Deliverance Hobbs]] (step-mother  of Abigail Hobbs), [[Sarah Wilds]], [[William Hobbs]] (husband of Deliverance and father of Abigail), [[Nehemiah Abbott Jr.]], [[Mary Esty]] (sister of Cloyce and Nurse), [[Edward Bishop Jr.]] and his wife [[Sarah Bishop]], and [[Mary English]], and finally on [[April 30]], the Reverend [[George Burroughs]], [[Lydia Dustin]], [[Susannah Martin]], [[Dorcas Hoar]], [[Sarah Morey]] and [[Philip English]] (Mary's husband). [[Nehemiah Abbott Jr.]] was released because the accusers agreed he was not the person whose spectre had afflicted them. [[Mary Esty]] was released for a few days after her initial arrest because the accusers failed to confirm that it was she who had afflicted them, and then she was rearrested when the accusers reconsidered.
  
Much, but not all, of the evidence used against the accused was "[[spectral evidence]]," or the testimony of the afflicted who claimed to see the apparition or the shape of the person who was allegedly afflicting them. The theological dispute that ensued about the use of this evidence centered on whether a person had to give their permission to the Devil for their "shape" to be used to afflict. Opponents claimed that the Devil was able to use anyone's "shape" to afflict people, but the Court contended that the Devil could not use a person's shape without their permission, therefore when the afflicted claimed to "see" the apparition of a specific person, that was accepted as evidence that the accused had been complicit with the Devil. [[Increase Mather]] and other ministers sent a letter to the Court, "The Return of Several Ministers Consulted," urging the magistrates not to convict on spectral evidence alone. A copy of this letter was printed in Increase Mather's [[http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/speccol/mather/ "Cases of Conscience"]] published in 1693. See facsimiles of [[http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/speccol/mather/small/MATH73.jpg page 73]] and [[http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/speccol/mather/small/MATH74.jpg page 74]] of this rare book. Other evidence included the confession of the accused, the testimony of another confessing "witch" identifying others as witches, the discovery of "poppits," books of palmistry and horoscopes, or pots of ointments in the possession or home of the accused, and the existence of so-called "witch's teats" on the body of the accused.

As the number of accusations grew, the jail populations of [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] swelled. The new governor and charter for the colony did not arrive until May. Some have postulated that without this, there was no legitimate form of government to try capital cases (Boyer 6), but this was not true. In the years between charters, according to the Records of the Court of Assistants, a group of thirteen pirates led by [[Thomas Johnson]], a mariner of [[Boston]], were tried and hanged on [[January 27]], [[1690]] for acts of piracy and murder in August and October of 1689.<ref>records of the Court of Assistants, pp. 309-313</ref> [[Elizabeth Emerson]] of [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]] was tried and hanged for double-infanticide in May 1691.<ref>records of the Court of Assistants, p. 357</ref> The fact that none of the [[witchcraft]] cases were tried until late May, after Governor Sir [[William Phips]] arrived and instituted a Court of [[Oyer and Terminer]] (to "hear and determine"), was likely in deference to his imminent arrival. Phips appointed [[William Stoughton (Massachusetts)|William Stoughton]], who had theological training but no legal training, as the Chief Justice of this court (Boyer 7). By then, [[Sarah Osborne]] had died of natural causes in jail on [[May 10]] without a trial (Boyer 3), as had Sarah Good's infant. 

In May, warrants were issued for 36 more people: [[Sarah Dustin]] (daughter of Lydia Dustin), [[Ann Sears]], [[Bethiah Carter Sr.]] and her daughter [[Bethiah Carter Jr.]], [[George Jacobs Sr.]] and his granddaughter [[Margaret Jacobs]], [[John Willard]], [[Alice Parker (witch)|Alice Parker]], [[Ann Pudeator]], [[Abigail Soames]], [[George Jacobs Jr.]] (son of George Jacobs Sr. and father of Margaret Jacobs), [[Daniel Andrew]], [[Rebecca Jacobs]] (wife of George Jacobs Jr. and sister of Daniel Andrew), [[Sarah Buckley]] and her daughter [[Mary Witheridge]], [[Elizabeth Colson]], [[Elizabeth Hart]], [[Thomas Farrar Sr.]], [[Roger Toothaker]], [[Sarah Proctor]] (daughter of John and Elilzabeth Proctor), [[Sarah Bassett]] (sister-in-law of Elizabeth Proctor), [[Susannah Roots]], [[Mary DeRich]] (another sister-in-law of Elizabeth Proctor), [[Sarah Pease]], [[Elizabeth Cary]], [[Martha Carrier]], [[Elizabeth Fosdick]], [[Wilmot Redd]], [[Sarah Rice]], [[Elizabeth How]], [[Capt. John Alden]] (son of [[John Alden]] and Priscilla Mullins of [[Plymouth Colony]]), [[William Proctor (Salem)|William Proctor]] (son of John and Elizabeth Proctor), [[John Flood]], [[Mary Toothaker]] (wife of Roger Toothaker and sister of Martha Carrier) and her daughter [[Margaret Toothaker]], and [[Arthur Abbott]]. John Willard and Elizabeth Colson managed to evade capture for a while but were finally taken into custody, whereas Daniel Andrew and George Jacobs Jr. were never apprehended. When the Court of Oyer and Terminer convened at the end of May, this brought the total number of people in custody for the court to handle to 62.<ref> For information about the family relationships between these people, see Roach, Marilynne K.

==Legal procedures==
[[Image:Gilecory.jpg|thumb|Giles Cory was pressed to death during the Salem witch trials in the 1690s.]]
After someone concluded that a loss, illness or death had been caused by witchcraft, the accuser would enter a complaint against the alleged witch with the local magistrates.<ref>See [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/essex/ecca/vol1/096.html The Complaint v. Elizabeth Procter & Sarah Cloyce] for an example of one of the primary sources of this type.</ref> 

If the complaint was deemed credible, the magistrates would have the person arrested<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/essex/ecca/vol1/070.html The Arrest Warrant of Rebecca Nurse]</ref> and brought in for a public examination, essentially an interrogation, where the magistrates pressed the accused to confess.<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/essex/eia/eia01.html The Examination of Martha Corey]</ref> 

If the magistrates at this local level were satisfied that the complaint was well-founded, the prisoner was handed over to be dealt with by a superior court. In 1692, the magistrates opted to wait for the arrival of the new charter and governor, who would establish a Court of [[Oyer and Terminer]] to handle these cases.

The next step, at the superior court level, was to summon witnesses before a grand jury.<ref>For an example: [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/essex/ecca/vol1/065.html Summons for Witnesses v. Rebecca Nurse]</ref>
A person could be indicted on charges of afflicting with witchcraft<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/essex/ecca/vol1/003.html Indictment of Sarah Good for Afflicting Sarah Vibber]</ref>,
or for making an unlawful covenant with the Devil.<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/essex/eia/eia23.html Indictment of Abigail Hobbs for Covenanting]</ref> Once indicted, the defendant went to trial, sometimes on the same day, as in the case of the first person indicted and tried on [[June 2]], [[Bridget Bishop]], who was executed on [[June 10]], [[1692]].  

There were four execution dates, with one person executed on [[June 10]], [[1692]]<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/essex/ecca/vol1/071.html The Death Warrant of Bridget Bishop]</ref>, five executed on [[July 19]], [[1692]]<ref> [http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/BPL/B05A.html Death Warrant for Sarah Good, Rebecca Nurse, Susannah Martin, Elizabeth How & Sarah Wilds]</ref>, another five executed on [[August 19]], [[1692]] ([[Susannah Martin]], [[John Willard]], [[George Burroughs]], [[George Jacobs Sr.]], and [[John Proctor]]), and eight on [[September 22]], [[1692]] ([[Mary Esty]], [[Martha Cory]], [[Ann Pudeator]], [[Samuel Wardwell]], [[Mary Parker]], [[Alice Parker]], [[Wilmot Redd]], and Margaret Scott). Several others, including [[Elizabeth Proctor|Elizabeth (Bassett) Proctor]] and [[Abigail Faulkner]] were convicted but given temporary reprieves because they were pregnant (Chronology). Though convicted, they would not be hanged until they had given birth (Chronology). Five other women were convicted in 1692, but sentence was never carried out: [[Ann Foster]] (who later died in prison), her daughter [[Mary Lacy Sr.]], [[Abigail Hobbs]], [[Dorcas Hoar]], and [[Mary Bradbury]].

[[Giles Corey]], an 80-year-old farmer from the southeast end of Salem called Salem Farms, refused to enter a plea when he came to trial in September. The judges mistakenly believed that the law provided for the application of a form of torture called ''peine forte et dure'', in which the victim was slowly crushed by piling stones on a board that was laid upon the victim's body.  (British law had, in reality, abolished this practice twenty years earlier.)[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Peine_Forte_Et_Dure] After two days of ''peine fort et dure'', Corey died without entering a plea (Boyer 8). Though his refusal to plead is often explained as a way of preventing his possessions from being confiscated by the state, this is not true; the possessions of convicted witches were often confiscated, and the possessions of persons accused but not convicted were confiscated before a trial, as in the case of Corey's neighbor [[John Proctor]] and the wealthy Englishmen of Salem Town. Some historians hypothesize that Giles Corey's personal character, a stubborn and lawsuit-prone old man who knew he was going to be convicted regardless, led to his recalcitrance (Boyer 8).
<blockquote>
<U>'''The Petition of John Proctor'''</u>

<p>SALEM-PRISON, [[July 23]], [[1692]].

<p>Mr. Mather, Mr. Allen, Mr. Moody, Mr. Willard, and Mr. Bailey 

<p>Reverend Gentlemen,

:The innocency of our Case with the Enmity of our Accusers and our Judges, and Jury, whom nothing but our Innocent blood will serve their turn, having Condmened us already before our Tryals, being so much incensed and engaged against us by the Devil, makes us bold to Beg and Implore your Favourable Assistance of this our Humble Petition to his Excellency, That if it be possible our Innocent Blood may be spared, which undoubtedly otherwise will be shed, if the Lord doth not mercifully step in. The Magistrates, Ministers, Jewries, and all the People in general, being so much inraged and incensed against us by the Delusion of the Devil, which we can term no other, by reason we know in our own Consciences, we are all Innocent Persons. here are five Persons who have lately confessed themselves to be Witches, and do accuse some of us, of being along with them at a Sacrament, since we were committed into close Prison, which we know to be Lies. Two of the 5 are (Carriers Sons) Youngmen, who would not confess any thing till they tyed them Neck and Heels till the Blood was ready to come out of their Noses, and <U+2018>tis credibly believed and reported this was the occasion of making them confess that they never did, by reason they said one had been a Witch a Month, another five Weeks, and that their Mother had made them so, who has been confined here this nine Weeks. My son William Proctor, when he was examin'd, because he would not confess that he was Guilty, when he was Innocent, they tyed him Neck and Heels till the Blood gushed out of his Nose, and would have kept him so 24 Hours, if one more Merciful than the rest, had not taken pity on him, and caused him to be unbound. These actions are very like the Popish Cruelties. They have already undone us in our Estates, and that will not serve their turns, without our Innocent Bloods. If it cannot be granted that we can have our Trials at Boston, we humbly beg that you would endeavour to have these Magistrates changed, and others in their rooms, begging also and beseeching you would be pleased to be here, if not all, some of you at our Trials, hoping thereby you may be the means of saving the shedding our Innocent Bloods, desiring your Prayers to the Lord in our behalf, we rest your Poor Afflicted Servants,

<p>JOHN PROCTOR, etc.<ref>''Famour Trials'',source:http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/SAL_E&P.HTM</ref>
</blockquote>

Sadly, not even in death were the accused witches granted peace or respect. As convicted witches, [[Rebecca Nurse]] and [[Martha Corey]] had been excommunicated from their churches and none were given proper burial. As soon as the bodies of the accused people were cut down from the trees, they were thrown into a shallow grave and the crowd would then leave. Oral history claims that the families of the dead reclaimed their bodies after dark and buried them in unmarked graves on family property. The record books of the time do not mention the deaths of any of those executed.

Philip and Mary English escaped to New York.  They returned after the trials to find their property pillaged.  Philip English eventually recovered 260 pounds out of a claim of 1183 pounds. <ref>[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/salem/people/english.html Salem Witch Trials Documentary Archive and Transcription Project]</ref>

==Closure==
The Reverend [[Francis Dane]] led the opposition and supported the accused. He petitioned the Governor and [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]], condemning the trials due to unfounded accusations. The last [[witch trials]] took place in [[May]] of [[1693]], although people already found not guilty of [[witchcraft]] were not released until they paid their jailers' fees. On [[October 3]], [[1692]], [[Increase Mather]] published "Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits." In it, [[Increase Mather]] stated "[[Blackstone's formulation|It were better that Ten Suspected Witches should escape, than that one Innocent Person should be Condemned]]." After another trial was conducted, all those in jail were set free in May of 1693 (this amnesty is what saved [[Elizabeth Proctor]]). 

Many descendants of the people who were wrongfully convicted still sought closure. Numerous petitions were filed between [[1692]] and [[1711]], demanding monetary restitution to those wrongly imprisoned.

The Massachusetts House of Representatives finally passed a bill disallowing spectral evidence. However, they only gave reversal of attainder for those who had filed petitions.<ref>http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/MA135/93.html</ref> This applied to only three people, who had been convicted but not executed: Abigail Faulkner Sr., Elizabeth Proctor, and Sarah Wardwell.<ref>Enders Robinson, The Devil Discovered, 2001 edition, preface, pp. xvi-xvii</ref>

In 1704, another petition was filed, requesting a more equitable settlement for those wrongly accused. In 1709, the General Court received a request to take action on this proposal. In May 1709, 22 people who had been convicted of witchcraft, or whose parents had been convicted of witchcraft, presented the government with a petition in which they demanded both a reversal of attainder and compensation for financial losses.

In [[1706]], [[Ann Putnam]], one of the most active accusers, was the only girl to offer a written apology. She claimed that she had not acted out of malice, but was being deluded by [[Satan]] into denouncing innocent people, and mentioned [[Rebecca Nurse]] in particular. In [[1712]] the  [[pastor]] who had cast Rebecca out of the church formally cancelled the [[excommunication]].

On [[October 17]], [[1711]], the General Court passed a bill reversing the judgment against the 22 people listed in the [[1709]] petition. There were still an additional 7 people who had been convicted, but had not signed the petition. There was no reversal of attainder for them.

On [[December 17]], [[1711]], monetary compensation was finally awarded to the 22 people in the [[1709]] petition. 578 pounds 12 shillings were authorized to be divided among the survivors and relatives of those accused. Most of the accounts were settled within a year. 150 pounds were awarded to the Proctor family for John and Elizabeth. The Proctor family received much more money from the Massachusetts General Court than most families of accused witches.

By [[1957]], not all the condemned had been exonerated. Descendants of the six people who had been wrongly convicted and executed but who had not been included in the bill for a reversal of attainder in 1711, or added to it in 1712, demanded the General Court formally clear the names of their family members. An act was passed pronouncing the innocence of those accused <U+2014> however, it only listed [[Ann Pudeator]] by name, and the others as "certain other persons", still failing to include [[Bridget Bishop]], [[Susannah Martin]], [[Alice Parker]], [[Wilmot Redd]] and [[Margaret Scott]] by name.

In [[1992]], The Danvers Tercentenial Committee persuaded the Massachusetts House of Representatives to issue a resolution honoring those who had died. After much convincing and hard work by Salem school teacher [[Paula Keene]], Representatives J. Michael Ruane and [[Paul Tirone]] and a few others, the names of all those not previously listed were added to this resolution. When it was finally signed on [[October 31]], [[2001]] by [[Governor]] [[Jane Swift]], more than 300 years later, all were finally proclaimed innocent.

==Possible explanations of the "possessed"==
It is not widely believed any longer that the girls were actually possessed by the devil. Some academics believe that the accusers were motivated by jealousy or spite and their behavior was an act.  Contemporaneous to the witch trials was [[the Glorious Revolution]] in England; the colony of Massachusetts was without a charter or governor, leading to political strife and uncertainty. Other theories posit that they were afflicted by [[hysteria]], a form of [[mental illness]]. 

In 1976, graduate student Linnda Caporael published [http://web.utk.edu/~kstclair/221/ergotism.html an article in Science magazine], making the claim that the hallucinations of the afflicted girls could possibly have been the result of ingesting rye bread that had been made with moldy grain. "[[Ergot]] of [[Rye]]" is a plant disease that is caused by the fungus ''[[Claviceps purpurea]]''. This fungus contains chemical precursors used to synthesize the powerful [[psychedelic]] drug [[LSD]]. Convulsive [[ergotism]] causes nervous dysfunction, which Caporael claims are similar to many of the physical symptoms of those alleged to be afflicted by witchcraft.  Within seven months, a refutation of this theory was published in the same journal by Spanos and Gottlieb, arguing, among other things, that if the poison was in the food supply, the symptoms would have occurred on a house-by-house basis, and that biological symptoms do not stop and start on cue and simultaneously in a group of those so afflicted, as described by the witnesses to the afflictions.  

In her book ''A Fever in Salem'', Laurie Winn Carlson offers an alternative theory. She believes those afflicted in Salem, who claimed to have been bewitched, suffered from [[encephalitis lethargica]], a disease whose symptoms match some of what was reported in Salem and could have been spread by birds and other animals (Aronson).  

It has also been suggested in an undocumented article that the girls could have had [[Huntington's Chorea]], carriers of which have been traced to be among the colonists that settled in that area <ref>[http://www.stanford.edu/group/hopes/sttools/print/p_r_timeline.pdf]</ref>, but no serious historian of this episode today (Mary Beth Norton, Bernard Rosenthal, Marilynne K. Roach and others) gives any of these medical explanations any serious consideration because of the apparent cherry-picking of biological symptoms of the illnesses they reference to make the afflictions seem more identical with the illness, and because the historical evidence cited in these articles as evidence of certain symptoms is in many places historically inaccurate.

== The Salem witch trials in literature == 

The Salem Witch Trials have provided the basis for two of America's great works of drama, ''[[Giles Corey]]'' in [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s ''New England Tragedies'' and [[Arthur Miller]]'s classic play ''[[The Crucible]]''.  Longfellow's play, which follows the form of a [[Shakespearean tragedy]], is a commentary on the attitudes prevalent in 19th-century New England.  Miller's play is a commentary on the actions of the [[House Committee on Unamerican Activities]] and [[Senator]] [[Joe McCarthy]]. 

''[[Lois the Witch]]'' by [[Elizabeth Gaskell]] is a novella based on the Salem witch hunts and shows how jealousy and sexual desire can lead to hysteria. She was inspired by the story of [[Rebecca Nurse]] whose accusation, trial and execution are described in ''[[Lectures on Witchcraft]]'', by [[Charles W. Upham]], the [[Unitarian]] minister in Salem in the 1830s.

''Gallows Hill'' by [[Lois Duncan]] is a young adult fiction book in which main character Sarah, and many others, turn out to be reincarnations of those accused and killed during the Trials.

In ''The Last Witchfinder'', by [[James Morrow]], the Salem Witch Trials feature prominently.

The Salem Witch Trials are the background for Joe Masdon's short story "Oyer and Terminer."

==The Salem witch trials in popular culture==
* In the television series ''[[Charmed]]'', part of the fictional background is that an ancestor of the three protagonists, [[Melinda Warren]], was burned at the stake in the Salem witch trials. This has no historical basis.
* In the animated television series ''[[Histeria!]]'',  one episode, "When America Was Young", included a sketch based upon the trials.
* In the fourth book of the ''Harry Potter'' series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', a group of "middle-aged American witches" are observed by Harry as sitting under a banner reading "The Salem Witch's Institute" at the [[Quidditch World Cup]]. This is a probable reference to the Salem trials.
