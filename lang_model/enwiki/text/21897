'''Tailevu''' is one of [[Fiji]]'s fourteen [[Local government of Fiji|Provinces]].  One of eight Provinces based in [[Viti Levu]], Fiji's largest island, its 755 square kilometers occupy the south-eastern fringe of the island, along with some central areas.  At the 2007 [[census]], the most recent to date, it had a population of 55,692, the fifth largest among the Provinces.  The main urban area of Tailevu is [[Nausori]] with a population of 21,645 in 1996.

Tailevu includes the Districts of [[Bau]], [[Nakelo]], [[Verata]], Wainibuka, and Sawakasa.  Bau District includes [[Bau Island]], the seat of the [[Kubuna Confederacy]], one of three traditional [[Ratu|chief]]ly hierarchies in Fiji.  Kubuna's Paramount Chief, called the ''[[Vunivalu of Bau]],'' is generally considered the most senior such chief in Fiji.  Holders of the title included [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]], who forged the first nation-state out of the [[Fiji Islands]] and established the Kingdom of Viti, having himself crowned as King in 1871 before ceding the islands to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1874.  The last to hold the title was [[George Cakobau|Ratu Sir George Cakobau]], who was also [[List of Governors-General of Fiji|Governor-General]] of Fiji from 1973 to 1983.  Since Cakobau's death in 1989, the office of ''Vunivalu'' has been vacant; this is thought to be partly because of disagreements over the succession.  Discussions among the clans of Bau are [[December 2005|currently]] underway to find a successor, with Cakobau's son,  [[George Cakobau, Jr.|Ratu George Cakobau]], considered a likely candidate.

Another Tailevu native, famous in a different way, is [[George Speight]], who fronted the [[Fiji coup of 2000|coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] that overthrew Fiji's elected government in 2000.  [[Jope Seniloli|Ratu Jope Seniloli]], who was forced to resign the [[List of Vice-Presidents of Fiji|Vice-Presidency]] of Fiji in late 2004 following his conviction for coup-related offences, is also from Tailevu.
