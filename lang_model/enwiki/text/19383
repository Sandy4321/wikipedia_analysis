'''Mermaid Man''' is a semi-retired [[superhero]]. He is voiced by [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[actor]], [[Ernest Borgnine]] (in the series), [[Joe Whyte]] (in [[SpongeBob SquarePants: Employee of the Month|Employee of the Month]] and [[SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom|Battle for Bikini Bottom]]), and [[Joe Alaskey]] (in [[SpongeBob SquarePants: Lights, Camera, Pants!|Lights, Camera, Pants!]] and [[SpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty Krab|Creature from the Krusty Krab]]). His name is a [[portmanteau]] of [[mermaid]] and the lesser-known [[merman]], the latter being the actual name for the male version of a mermaid.

Mermaid Man is a semi-retired [[superhero]] who has aged well past his prime. His costume mostly resembles the costume of the [[comic book]] hero [[Aquaman]], with the addition of a star-shaped mask, a scallop-shell bra, and a pair of fuzzy slippers. Mermaid Man's underwater lair and method of crime fighting is a [[parody]] of [[Batman]], and his "invisible Boat-Mobile" is a parody of both the [[Batmobile]] and [[Wonder Woman]]'s invisible jet. It is unknown how he can live in [[Bikini Bottom]], as he is very clearly a humanoid (although he could be [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] otherwise super-powered).

Mermaid Man's sidekick is Barnacle Boy, who he treats like a child even though Barnacle Boy is sixty-eight years old. Mermaid Man appears to be in the advanced stages of [[senility]], often forgetting what he was talking about, or what he was doing. This is not a problem for [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] and [[Patrick Star|Patrick]], who unconditionally adore the two heroes and managed to coax them out of retirement and back into [[television]]. SpongeBob has appeared with them in six different shorts <U+2014> often involving a [[supervillain]], a [[gadget|supergadget]], or some combination of the two and making a film about the heroes.

Mermaid Man enjoys watching television, and he eats almost anything. His favorite foods are meatloaf and ice cream.

Mermaid Man's Utility Belt Tools include the Small Ray, the Wumbo Ray (Which, having shrunken something, must be set to "Wumbo" to unshrink target. However, it was mentioned by Patrick, it may not actually exist), Building Obliteration Button, Chin Cam, and various radioactive beams that cause bizarre mutations to the subject, such as causing them to suddenly catch on fire or to be cut in half by scissors. They are only briefly shown, all afflicting Squidward.
Similar to bat man & aquaman.

'''Barnacle Boy''' is Mermaid Man's side-kick. He is voiced by [[Emmy Award]] winning [[comedian]] and [[actor]] [[Tim Conway]].

Barnacle Boy (actual name '''Kyle''') is a 68-year old semi-retired [[superhero]] sidekick. His costume is a cross between the [[Silver Age]] [[Aqualad]] and [[Gilligan]] of ''[[Gilligan's Island]].'' Mermaid Man, his mentor, treats him as if he were a young boy, in spite him being an adult. He often calls Mermaid Man an "old coot". In true sidekick fashion he takes the brunt of the physical comedy upon himself. He even became a villain briefly in [[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy V]], teaming up with Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble following a dispute about a pipsqueak patty (A '''very''' small version of a Krabby Patty intended for children) at the Krusty Krab. After a protracted fight--and a painful parody of the [[Justice League]] with the regular cast--he and [[Mermaid Man]] patched things up. Barnacle Man, as he likes to be called, gets a little more respect now (even though he '''cannot''' finish an adult-sized Krabby Patty). In the same episode Barnacle Boy mentioned he was so old he had hairs growing out of his liver spots. He also has a nose similar to Squidward's, although larger. This is referenced in Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy IV when Barnacle Boy and Squidward are locked in a battle of wits involving them calling each other "Big-nose." Barnacle Boy also runs security at the Rock Bottom Museum. In the video game Battle for Bikini Bottom, it was revealed that Barnacle Boy has a son, a daughter-in-law, and four screaming grand kids. 

Barnacle Boy posses powers similar to [[Mermaid Man]], such as the ability to summon creatures from the deep. Barnacle Boy also has [[sulfur]] vision (a sort of laser vision). Another one of his powers may be the ability to survive underwater, as he and [[Mermaid Man]] are both humans.

==Mermalair==
The '''Mermalair''' is the secret hideout of [[Mermaid Man]] and [[Barnacle Boy]]. The only episodes that the Mermalair appeared in were [[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy II]], [[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III]] and [[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy V]]. However, in the video game, ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom]]'', the Mermalair can be seen in much more detail.

===Secret Entrance===
To enter the Mermalair, a secret switch must be pressed inside Shady Shoals rest home, and it will activate a secret door under the couch (much like the entrance to the secret lair of [[Darkwing Duck]] which you get to by activating a secret door under two recliners). A hole leads down to the lobby of the Mermalair.<ref name="Battle">''as seen in the [[SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom]] video game.''</ref> In SpongeBob SquarePants comics, it's accessible by charging full speed at a wall in the home. There is another entrance, which is a cave like the batcave from the [[Batman]] tv series (most likely for the boatmobile to get outside). Shady Shoals is located nearby a large cliff which marks the possible location of the cave.

The Mermalair is broken up into the following sections:
*Mermalair Lobby - Entrance Area<ref name="Battle"> </ref>
*Mermalair Main Chamber - Security Computer, Funnel Machines, Tower of Power, and a leisure area for Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.<ref name="Battle"> </ref>
*Mermalair Security Tunnel - Tunnel leading to the Rolling Ball Room<ref name="Battle"> </ref>
*Rolling Ball Room<ref name="Battle"> </ref>
*Villain Containment Area - Where villains are locked up.<ref name="Battle"> </ref>

===Cave Entrance===
The cave entrance of the Mermalair contains the ''Wall of Superhero Super Gadgetry''.<ref name="III">''as seen in the episode, "[[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III]]"''</ref> This wall contains such gadgets as the Cosmic Ray, the AquaGlove, and the Death grenade.

An additional tool is the ''Orb of Confusion.'' Warning: Prolonged exposure to the Orb of Confusion will give its victim confusion. Another tool is the Tickle Belt (as seen in Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy episode 17).<ref name="III"> </ref>

Another room in this area of the Mermalair is where Man Ray was frozen in a tube of frozen tartar sauce.<ref name="III"> </ref>

Additional features include:
*Tubes where the [[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy#Allies|I.J.L.S.A]] costumes are stored.<ref name="V">''as seen in the episode, "[[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy V]]"''</ref>
*A conference room with the I.J.L.S.A. Table<ref name="V"> </ref>
*Prawn's cell<ref name="Battle"> </ref>

===Mermalair Lobby===
At the end of the hole at the entrance, the lobby of the Mermalair is the first room. It contains various obstacles to get to the main chamber.<ref name="Battle"> </ref>

===Mermalair Main Chamber===
The Mermalair Main Chamber is found after the lobby, in which doorway leads to it. Inside, the Security Computer is present, in which it controls the security system. In addition, funnel machines and the tower of power control the power within the Mermalair. Finally, a leisure area, including a Television set, is where Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy rest.<ref name="Battle"> </ref>

====Security system====
The Mermalair has a large security system in which Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy use to keep the villains in the villain chamber locked up. In order to shut the whole system down, four buttons must be pressed, along with the main shut-down button, at the main computer.<ref name="Battle"> </ref>

==Invisible Boatmobile==
The Invisible Boatmobile is Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's vehicle, located in the Mermalair. The boat is a regular-sized boatmobile with many superhero features to it, such as the [[origami]] button, which can fold the boat into a visible origami shape. SpongeBob claims to know lots about the boat, like knowing where the windshield wipers are, but pressing the aforementioned button.<ref name="II">''as seen in the episode, "[[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy II]]"''</ref>It is said for the boatmobile to have a more powerful engine than others to enable the heroes to get to the situation where their help is needed faster. In addition to the engine, the boatmobile has manual transmission.

*The boatmobile was once almost completely painted black by SpongeBob and Patrick, thus defeating the purpose of it being invisible.
*Barnacle Boy commonly gets burned by the [[tailpipe]] of the boatmobile when Mermaid Man starts it up.
*To drive it you need an invisible licence.
*[[Barnacle Boy]] thinks that making it invisible was a stupid idea.
*In SpongeBob's [[Mermaid Man]] [[movie]], the invisible boatmobile was played by the visible [[Pearl Krabs]] and a mountain climber.<ref name="VI">''as seen in the episode, "[[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy VI - The Motion Picture]]"''</ref>
*When using the Invisible Boat alarm, the Boatmobile is temporarily visible, and it appears to be a somewhat old-fashioned [[convertible]]. However, when SpongeBob and Patrick paint half of the Boatmobile, or when they run it into a street light, it appears to be shaped like a boat. Also, the game, "Lights, Camera, Pants!" it was seen for a brief moment to be pink.

==Allies==

[[Image:Ijlsa.jpg|120px|right|thumb|The I.J.L.S.A. as portrayed by SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Sandy]]
[[Image:IJLSA.PNG|right|100px|thumb|The original I.J.L.S.A. members.]]
Allies of [[Mermaid Man]] and [[Barnacle Boy]] include the '''I.J.L.S.A. (International Justice League of Super Acquaintances)''' is a team of superheroes, which are allies of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. It is only mentioned in the episode [[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy V]]. Members of the I.J.L.S.A. (a subsidiary of [[Viacom]]) includes:

'''The Quickster''' - who has the ability to run really quick. He is parody of [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]] or QuickSilver. [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] once portrayed him.

'''Captain Magma''' - who has a volcano on the top of his head from which he can shoot lava. A parody of the [[Human Torch]] or [[Firestorm]] from the [[JLA]]. He was once portrayed by [[Squidward Tentacles]].

'''The Elastic Waistband''' - who has the ability to bend his body into fantastic shapes and forms. This hero is a parody of [[Plastic Man]] from the [[JLA]] or [[Mr. Fantastic]] from the [[Fantastic Four]]. He was once portrayed by [[Patrick Star]].

'''Miss Appear''' - who has the ability to become invisible. A parody of [[Invisible Woman]], part of the [[Fantastic Four]]. She was once portrayed by [[Sandy Cheeks]].

There is another ally for Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy who's not exactly a member of the IJLSA.

'''Starfish Man''' - a super hero who teamed up with Mermaid Man in [[SpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty Krab|Creature from the Krusty Krab]] to defeat the Giant Plankton and save Bikini Bottom. He is none other than [[Patrick Star]].

==Enemies==
[[Mermaid Man]] and [[Barnacle Boy]] have many enemies.
* '''Atomic Flounder''' - A retired villain who can blast hot [[Radioactivity|radioactive]] beams from his mouth. Capable of third degree burns from his beams, he wears a radioactive suit and speaks with a Kennedy-esque New England accent.<ref name="II">''as seen in the episode, "[[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy II]]"''</ref>
[[Image:Biodirty.jpg|thumb|The Dirty Bubble]]
* '''Dirty Bubble''' - A giant dirt bubble who is Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's number one arch nemesis and SpongeBob's favorite villain. He enjoys making his enemies eat dirt. When he first appeared, he tried to capture the heroes, who attempt to ditch SpongeBob. He successfully captured the two, before SpongeBob accidentally pops him with a pencil while attempting to get his autograph.<ref name="II"> </ref> Later, in [[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy V]], Dirty Bubble somehow returns. In the episode, Man Ray has teamed up with him to form an organization called EVIL (''Every Villain Is Lemons''). When Barnacle Boy tires of Mermaid Man treating him like a little kid, he joins the two, and commits crimes. In the end, Barnacle Boy returns to the good side, and the two villains are arrested. He is a champion at paddleball, as seen in [[Have You Seen This Snail?]]. Dirty Bubble is voiced by [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] and [[Tom Kenny]].
* '''Jumbo Shrimp''' - Seen in "[[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy II]]". He once referred to (perhaps mistakenly, or in reference to a different villain) as "The Killer Shrimp" by the Dirty Bubble.
* '''Kelp Thing''' - Seen in "[[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy VI - The Motion Picture]]". "I've got to do what I do." He parks his villain car in no parking zones, but Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy tow it away. His name and appearance may be based on [[Man-Thing]].
* '''Sneaky Hermit''' - A super hermit crab who plans to rule the world by means of sneakiness. He steals buildings in a sneaky fashion. His weakness is pepper. Seen in Lights, Camera, PANTS!. In the New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy episode in that game, he called Man Ray, Moron Ray and the Dirty Bubble, the Dopey Bubble.
* '''Snorelonn''' - Only mentioned in Nickelodeon Magazine, in the special SpongeBob issue. His evil plan is to wake everyone up with loud snoring noises. SpongeBob and Patrick were playing Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and said that Squidward was Snorelonn. Snorelonn also plans to eat them and suck out their brains with a turkey baster.
* '''Man Ray''' - Man Ray was first mentioned in ''Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy'' by SpongeBob when he's trying to get Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy to come out of retirement. He later appears in person in ''[[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III]]'', where SpongeBob and Patrick released him from frozen tartar sauce. When he discovers that he has a tickle belt, Man Ray tricks the duo to teach him kindness. After the class, Man Ray grabs two devices from Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy to take over Bikini Bottom. When he discovers that he has become good, he quits villainy. His head is made up of his mask/shoulder pads combo and is headless underneath that. Later, in ''[[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy V]]'', he becomes evil again (and somehow recovers his head), and brings back the Dirty Bubble and they team up with Barnacle Boy (who became evil) to form E.V.I.L. At the end, Barnacle Boy becomes good again, and, Man Ray is taken to jail with Dirty Bubble. He may be a parody of the [[Aquaman]] villain [[Black Manta]]. His name seems to be derived from the [[DC comics]] super-villain [[Man-bat]] and the [[United States|American]] [[artist]] [[Man Ray]], or the manta ray. [[John Rhys-Davies]] and [[Bob Joles]] voice Man Ray.
* '''Prawn''' - He threw Mermaid Man's red clothes in the laundry with his white clothes. Like Manray, he was frozen by Spongebob in the frozen tarter sauce in ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom]]''. He is voiced by [[Mr. Lawrence]].
* '''Reflecto''' - Squidward was mistaken for Reflecto when SpongeBob and Patrick were playing Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Reflecto uses mirrors in his evil schemes, and if he is ever cut off from sunlight, he loses his power.
* '''Sinster Slug''' - Seen in "[[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy II]]."
* '''Dr. Octofish''' - Barnacle Boy used his paddleball of fury to break this villain's concentration. Mentioned in Lights, Camera, Pants! Possibly the villain at the beginning of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. "Doctor Octofish" is a possible parody of [[Doctor Octopus]] from [[Spider-Man]].

===Organizations===
* '''E.V.I.L.''' - An organization of supervillains. It stands for "Every Villain Is Lemons". It was only temporary, in which Man Ray, the Dirty Bubble, and Barnacle Man (Barnacle Boy betrayed Mermaid Man because he did not like to be treated as a little kid) were the members. The committed such crimes as ringing doorbells and running, as well as spying on teenagers at Make-Out Reef. The I.J.L.S.A. stopped E.V.I.L., in which Barnacle "Man" rejoined the side of justice, and Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble were arrested.<ref name="V"> </ref>

===Movies===

*'''Producers:''' [[SpongeBob SquarePants]] and [[Patrick Star]]
*'''Writers:''' [[SpongeBob SquarePants]] and [[Patrick Star]]
*'''[[Cameraman]]:''' [[Patrick Star]]

*'''Microphone Holder (Actual Name for Boom Operator):''' [[Sheldon J. Plankton]]
*'''Make-up ''Artist'':''' [[Squidward Tentacles]]
*'''Cast:'''

**==Donald==He pulls pearl krabs (the visable boat mobile)up a mountain
;Production
*The movie was first produced differently. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy were driving the Invisible Boatmobile (Pearl Krabs) and were pulled by a guy up a rocky hill. Later, Mermaid Man recited the plot of episode #912 before the movie ended. However, it was ruined because Patrick Star had the lense cap on.
*Takes of one scene of the film
:*'''Take One:''' Mermaid Man tells Barnacle Boy "We have to get back those swollen Krabby Patties". SpongeBob says "Cut! No! It's '...'''stolen''' Krabby Patties'!".
:*'''Take Two:''' Mermaid Man tells Barnacle Boy "We have to get back to those stolen Maggy Daddies". SpongeBob says "Cut! No, Mermaid Man! It's '...stolen Krabby Patties'!".
:*'''Take 5003:''' Mermaid Man tells Barnacle Boy "We have to get back those stolen Krabby Patties". (The scene was ruined because Plankton could not hold up the mic and it kept appearing in the frame, eventually falling into Mermaid Man's mouth.)

;Plot
A warehouse filled with thousands of Krabby Patties is present. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy just discover that the Krabby Patties have been stolen by one of their enemies: Kelp Thing! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy proceed to the underground city. They drink cheese coffee. They encounter Kelp Thing. They defeat the enemy and get back the swollen Krabby Patties.
