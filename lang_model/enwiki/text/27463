'''Marian Bernaciak''' (''nom de guerre "Dymek"'' (Little Smoke) or ''"Orlik"'' (Little Eagle)) (born March 17, 1917 in [[Zalesie, Ryki County|Zalesie]] in [[Ryki County]], died, June 24, 1946 in [[Wi<U+0119>ck<U+00F3>w]]) was a lieutenant in the Polish Army, a member of [[ZWZ]] and the [[Home Army]], a major and a legendary leader of an underground partisan unit of [[Freedom and Independence|WiN]] in the [[Lublin]] region.

==Early life==
Marian was born to a peasant family, as the son of Micha<U+0142> and Maria (nee Bli<U+017A>niak). In 1937, he finished the [[Czartoryski]] [[gimnazjum]] in [[Pu<U+0142>awy]].<ref name=prez/> For his compulsory military service he attended the [[Mazowiecka Szko<U+0142>a Podchor<U+0105><U+017C>ych Rezerwy Artylerii]] (The Mazovian School for Cadets of the Artillary Reserve) in [[Zambrow]] which he finished with the rank of [[corporal]].<ref name=prez/> He was assigned to the Second Regiment of Heavy Artillery. He worked in the post office in [[Sobolew]]. In September 1939 he was mobilized and during the [[Nazi invasion of Poland]] he fought as a second lieutenant of the reserves. During the defense of [[W<U+0142>odzimierz Wo<U+0142>y<U+0144>ski]] he was captured and imprisoned by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]].<ref name=prez/> A few weeks later he managed to escape from a transport which was taking Polish [[POW]]s to camps within the Soviet Union,<ref name=prez/> and hence, possibly managed to avoid the fate of other Polish officers who were killed at [[Katyn]]. He returned to his home region and ran a bookstore in [[Ryki]] and a small printing shop in [[D<U+0119>blin]].

==In the anti-Nazi resistance==

In 1940 he became involved in underground activity as part of [[ZWZ]] and later the [[Home Army]] (AK).<ref name=prez/> He was the head of [[Kedyw]]'s Sub-region "A" (around D<U+0119>blin and Ryki) in the AK region of Pu<U+0142>awy.<ref name=prez/> From the fall of 1943 on he was sought after by the [[Gestapo]] and as a result remained in hiding. It was at this point that he changed his conspiratorial name from "Dymek" to "Orlik". On 20, November, 1943 he created a [[flying column]] of partisans of which he became the leader. In May of 1944 his group received the conspiratorial code name "OP I/15 Regiment of AK Infantry ''Wilki''" ("Wolves").<ref name=tvp/> He carried out more than twenty military actions and attacks against the occupying Germans.<ref name=prez/> Thanks to his group in D<U+0119>blin, during [[Operation Tempest]] in July of 1944, several military and economic objects were saved from destruction by retreating German forces and the local population was saved from [[Expulsion_of_Poles_by_Germany#Nazi_Germany|expulsion]] or [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|extermination]]. On July 26, 1944, his unit independently captured and took control of Ryki.<ref>IPN, "Podziemie zbrojne na Lubelszczy<U+017A>nie w latach 1939<U+2013>1956 wobec dw<U+00F3>ch totalitaryzm<U+00F3>w" (Partisan underground in Lublin region in 1939-1956, against two totalitarian systems", [http://www.ipn.gov.pl/wai.php?serwis=pl&dzial=368&id=952]</ref> In August of 1944 Bernaciak, together with about 350 partisan soldiers began a march in an attempt to aid the insurgents fighting the Nazis in the [[Warsaw Uprising]], on the orders of AK central command.<ref name=prez/> However, this endeavor was unsuccessful as the Soviets began disarming and attacking AK units at this time.<ref name=tvp>Adam Sikorski, "Z ARCHIWUM IPN - ORLIK" (From the Archives of IPN - Orlik) Magazyn, 23 min; documentary film first aired in 2006, script by Tadeusz Doroszuk, [http://www.tvp.pl/prasa/omowienia%20dzienne/Rok2007/Tydzien%2031-2007/TVP%20Historia/X070805.txt]</ref>

==In the anti-communist resistance==

In 1944/45 he was in danger of being arrested by the Soviets and as a result decided to disband his unit and go into hiding.<ref name=prez/> He was wanted by the [[NKVD]]. In March of 1945 he recreated his group, mostly out of AK soldiers who were threatened with arrest by the new communist authorities.<ref name=prez/> Initially he accepted the command of [[Armed Forces Delegation for Poland]] and later, beginning in September, he joined the anti-communist [[Freedom and Independence]] (WiN) movement.<ref name=prez/> 

One of his most famous actions took place on April 24, 1945, when Orlik's men attacked and captured the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland|UB]] office in Pu<U+0142>awy, freeing 107 political prisoners (mostly former AK members).<ref name=prez/> Another famous engagement took place on the 24th of May, 1945 near [[Las Stocki]], when together with a unit of fifty men under lieutenant [[Czes<U+0142>aw Szlendak]] ("Maks") Bernaciak won a battle<ref name=prez/> against a force of 680 soldiers ([[Internal Security Corps|KBW]], UB and NKVD)<ref name=Piet/> which was equipped with three armored cars.<ref name=Pajak/> After a fight that lasted a whole day, between 30 and 70 communist soldiers and militia had been killed. This was the largest battle fought in the post-World War II period between the forces of the Polish and Soviet governments and [[Cursed soldiers|anti-communist partisans]] in Poland.<ref name=tvp/><ref name=Pajak>Henryk Paj<U+0105>k, "Oni si<U+0119> nigdy nie poddali" (They never surrendered),  "Retro", 1997, pg. 168, [http://books.google.com/books?id=K-i1AAAAIAAJ&q=Lesie+Stockim+Orlik&dq=Lesie+Stockim+Orlik]</ref>

In the fall of 1945 he was made the commander of all WiN units operating in the Regional Inspectorate "Pu<U+0142>awy".<ref name=prez/> During this time he was promoted to the rank of [[major]] (according to some sources, [[Captain (land)|captain]]).<ref name=Piet>Leszek Pietrzak, "Konspiracja i op<U+00F3>r spo<U+0142>eczny w Polsce 1944-1956", Volume I IPN, 2002, accessed from [http://www.nnwfilmfestiwal.pl/bohaterowie-orlik.php]</ref> The anti-communist partisan group led by him, one of the largest in the [[Lublin]] region (between 160 and 200 soldiers) carried out many military actions against the communist authorities, the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland|communist secret police]] (UB), units of [[Ludowe Wojsko Polskie|Polish People's Army]] and the [[Militsiya|Milicja]]. According to released NKVD documents, as well as an investigation by the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]] in 2006, Bernaciak was considered sufficiently dangerous by the Soviets that they refused to let Polish communists "handle the problem on their own" and insisted on becoming involved themselves.<ref name=tvp/>

His partisans operated as a single group until July of 1945. However, afterward, due to the increased presence of regular Polish army and UB security units in the region, Bernaciak was forced to change his tactics. He divided his grouping into small [[platoons]] and [[squads]] which could stay hidden in various villages while being supported by the WiN network. At the same time, communications were maintained between them so that the overall group could quickly mobilize and carry out bigger operations. The approach changed once again in 1946 when the larger group was reformed and then divided into two sub-regiments. The first one operated under the leadership of [[Wac<U+0142>aw Kuchnio]], "Spokojny" (''Peaceful''),<ref>"Odznaczenia kombatant<U+00F3>w z okazji Dnia Weterana", (Orders for combatants on the occasion of Veteran's Day), Website of the President of Poland, 2009-08-14, [http://www.prezydent.pl/x.print?id=1011848&eventId=13027953&nodeModuleId=1028078]</ref> in the north of the Pu<U+0142>awy region, while the second, operating in the south was under the command of [[Zygmunt Wilczy<U+0144>sk]], "<U+017B>uk" (''Beetle'').<ref>Jerzy Cezary Malinowski, "Zarys dziej<U+00F3>w Okr<U+0119>gu Lubelskiego Zrzeszenia Wolno<U+015B><U+0107> i Niezawis<U+0142>o<U+015B><U+0107>, 1945-1956", Agencja Wschodnia Dom Wydawniczy, 1995, pg. 22, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Sce1AAAAIAAJ&q=Marian+Bernaciak&dq=Marian+Bernaciak&lr=]</ref>

The source of Bernaciak's successes at this time lay in his leadership ability and the willingness to change his tactics in response to a changing situation. Thanks to his efforts, his patrols and diversion squads, in addition to military actions, also carried out intelligence work, gathered information on the political and social situation in the world and in the region, and published informational pamphlets, communiques, and political manifestos. The best known of these were Orlik's appeal to the public on the occasion of the [[Polish people's referendum, 1946|1946 referendum]] and the pamphlet "The Pulawski Katyn" (a reference to the [[Katyn massacre]]).<ref name=Piet/>

==Death==

In order to fight Bernaciak, the communist authorities mobilized substantial military resources, involving more than ten thousand soldiers of the Polish People's Army, [[Internal Security Corps]], Milicja and UB. Marian's parents and his brother, Lucjan (former AK soldier) were arrested. On the 24th of June, 1946, when Marian Bernaciak was returning from a meeting in [[<U+017B>yczyn]] with a few of his men, he was ambushed by a squad of soldiers from the [[sapper]]'s division of the Polish Army and a unit of Internal Security Corps. He was surrounded and during an attempt to break out he was wounded twice. When it became clear that there was no escape Marian Bernaciak, "Orlik", committed suicide.<ref>Marek J. Chodakiewicz, "Dialectics of Pain, The Interrogation Methods of the Communist Secret Police in Poland, 1944-1955", May 30, 2005, [http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&q=Bernaciak+Orlik&btnG=Search]</ref>

==Legacy==

Bernaciak never married or started a family because, according to him, "there was no time for that".

In his home village of Zalesie, a monument was erected after the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in 1989, commemorating him with an inscription, a cross and a symbol of [[Kotwica|"Poland Fighting"]].

On 25 June, 2006, in [[Piotr<U+00F3>wk]], the [[President of Poland]], [[Lech Kaczy<U+0144>ski]] led a ceremony honoring the memory and the tragic death of Marian Bernaciak, "Orlik" and awarded his the Grand Cross of [[Polonia Restituta]] posthumously.<ref name=prez>Oficjalna strona Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej (Official webpage of the President of the Polish Republic), "Krzy<U+017C> Wielki Orderu Odrodzenia Polski dla legendarnego <U+201E>Orlika<U+201D>" (Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for the legendary "Orlik"), June 24, 2009, [http://beta.prezydent.pl/aktywnosc/ordery-i-odznaczenia/art,362,krzyz-wielki-orderu-odrodzenia-polski-dla-legendarnego-8222orlika8221.html]</ref>
