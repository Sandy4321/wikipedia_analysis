'''''Resident Evil''''' is a [[2002 in film|2002]] [[science fiction]] [[horror film]] loosely based on the ''[[Resident Evil (series)|Resident Evil]]'' series of [[survival horror game]]s developed by [[Capcom]], and the first in the series of the ''Resident Evil'' trilogy. Borrowing elements from the ''[[Resident Evil (video game)|Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' video games, the film follows the amnesiac heroine [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]], along with a group of [[Umbrella Corporation]] commandos, as they attempt to escape a secret underground facility full of [[zombie]]s. The film was directed by [[Paul W. S. Anderson]], and was released in the [[United States]] on [[March 15]], [[2002]], and in [[Japan]] on [[August 31]], [[2002]]. The film stars [[Milla Jovovich]] as [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]], [[Michelle Rodr<U+00ED>guez]] as [[Rain Ocampo]], [[Eric Mabius]] as [[Matt Addison]] and [[James Purefoy]] as [[Spence Parks]].

''Resident Evil'' was followed by two sequels: ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]'' (2004) and ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'' (2007). Anderson continued his involvement in the series, writing and producing the sequels, however, leaving directing to [[Alexander Witt]] and [[Russell Mulcahy]] in ''Apocalypse'' and ''Extinction''.

==Plot==
The film begins in [[The Hive (Resident Evil)|The Hive]], an underground research facility located beneath nearby [[Raccoon City]]. A man loads the [[T-virus]] and its cure into a case, then tosses a vial of the virus inside a lab. Minutes later, the automated security system in the facility kills everyone inside through various means. Elsewhere, Alice later awakens in the shower of an empty mansion with no recollection of her identity. As she explores the mansion she is confronted by a man, however the two are immediately seized by a group of commandos. The man, Matt Addison, reveals himself to be a police officer, but the commandos handcuff him regardless. The team then open a mirror-door to an underground train station, discovering Spence, another unconscious victim suffering amnesia, while on transport. Alice recognises Spence from a wedding photograph in the mansion, and looking at her wedding ring, she sees the inside of it reads: ''Property of the [[Umbrella Corporation]]''.
[[Image:Aliceresidentevil.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Milla Jovovich]] as the [[protagonist]], Alice.]]

Alice and Spence, as well as the commandos, are explained to be employees of the Umbrella Corporation, and it was the Umbrella Corporation that sent the commando team to investigate  why the Hive's defensive computer, the ''Red Queen'', killed all Umbrella staff. ''She'' is also responsible for releasing a nerve gas in the mansion which has caused Alice and Spence's amnesias, but throughout the film Alice begins to have glimpses of her past.

The crew find their way to the Queen's chamber, however, as the bulk of the team attempt to disable the Red Queen they are trapped in the corridor leading to the Queen's Chamber and torn apart by a laser grid. This leaves Alice, Spence, Kaplan, J.D., Rain and Matt as the only survivors. Alice and Kaplan shut the Queen down, but in doing so open the doors of the facility, releasing the undead staff and experiments from the laboratories in which they were imprisoned. Rain becomes infected after receiving multiple bite wounds, and a battle ensues in which Matt and Alice are separated and J.D. is killed.

Alice discovers that Matt was not a police officer, and used the title as a cover in his goal to help take down the Umbrella Corporation. Matt, with the help of his sister, Lisa, attempted to smuggle a sample of the T-Virus, the cause of the zombies, but the two were unsuccessful. Matt believes this to be the fault of Lisa's contact, who supposedly betrayed her. Throughout the film Alice has flashbacks, showing herself as Lisa's contact, but Alice is not fully aware of her role in the events. 

Soon, the survivors are once more united at the Queen's chamber and are forced to switch her back on for aid in an exit. Kaplan overrides the Queen's circuit-breaker, causing the next time she is disabled to be permanent, and the Red Queen somewhat agrees to aid the team. As Alice and the others try to escape through the maintenance tunnels, they are ambushed by zombies. Rain becomes severely injured and begins to weaken, while Kaplan is separated from the rest of the team and is assumed dead. On their way to the train, Alice remembers that an ''anti-virus'' exists that could cure the ailing Rain. However, arriving at the lab, they realize that the vials containing the T-Virus and anti-virus are gone. Spence, gaining his memory, is then shown as the person who released the virus. He points a gun at the survivors, and threatens them, trapping the others in the laboratory and making for the train where the case containing the anti-virus is. Before he can inject himself, however, he is killed by a [[Licker]], a mutant-creature created by injecting the T-virus directly into living tissue. The Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt's life if they kill Rain, who has been infected for the longest period of time. As the Licker attempts to bash through the lab window to get to them, the enraged Alice smashes the Queen's monitor, and there is suddenly a power-outage. The laboratory door opens to reveal Kaplan, who has permanently disabled the Red Queen.

[[Image:Deadwalk.jpg|thumb|300px|''A Newspaper headline displaying: '''The Dead Walk''' as a homage to [[George A. Romero|George A. Romero's]] ''Day of the Dead'']]
The protagonists hurry to get to the other end of the underground railway before it shuts down in a quarantine attempt, however, the Licker is on the train. It scratches Matt and kills Kaplan. 

Alice battles the Licker and Rain, who, despite being given the cure, has turned into a zombie. Matt and Alice emerge as the only survivors, and escape at the last moment when the doors close. Matt begins to suffer a mutation from an injury inflicted by the Licker, and the two are seized by Umbrella scientists. The scientists mention sending Matt to the "Nemesis Program", an allusion to the next film. Alice beats many of the scientists but is ultimately subdued. As the struggle fades to black, the words of one of the head scientists are heard, "We're reopening the Hive, I want to know what really went on down there."

Sometime later Alice wakes up at the Raccoon City Hospital, having gone through extensive testing, and breaks out only to find the city in chaos and abandoned. She picks a shotgun from a nearby police car and prepares to face the coming [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|apocalypse]] and the terrors that lie ahead.

===Pre-Production ===
In 1999, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]] and [[Capcom]] originally [[Greenlight|greenlit]] a ''Resident Evil'' film with [[George A. Romero]] signed on as the [[Film director|film's director]] and [[screenplay]] writer. Romero's association with Capcom, the ''Resident Evil'' video game series creator's, had extended from 1998 when Romero directed an [[Advertising|ad campaign]] for ''Biohazard 2'' (''[[Resident Evil 2]]'') in Japan. Romero stated in an official appearance in Universal Studio's Talk City chatroom that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource. The screenplay originally revolved around the plot of the [[Arklay Mountains|Arklay incident]] and included characters from the ''Resident Evil'' video games. [[Jill Valentine]] and [[Chris Redfield]] were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. [[Barry Burton]], [[Rebecca Chambers]], [[Ada Wong]] and [[Albert Wesker]] were to also appear. The ending to the film would have been similar to that of the ''Resident Evil'' video game.<ref>{{cite web| title= Resident Evil| publisher= Dailyscript.com| url= http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/resident_evil_romero.html| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref>  However, Romero's scrip was disapproved of and production was placed into [[development hell]].<ref>{{cite news| title= Resident Evil Film News| publisher= Computerandvideogames.com| date= [[2001-01-27]]| url= http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=16136&skip=yes| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> Capcom producer [[Yoshiki Okamoto]] explained to the editors of ''"Electronic Gaming Monthly"'' that "Romero's script wasn't good, so Romero was fired".<ref>{{cite web| title= Deep Dark Thoughts| publisher= Houseofhorrors.com| url= http://www.houseofhorrors.com/romero.htm| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> In February 2000, Romero revealed in an interview with ''DGA'' magazine that, "I don't think they were into the spirit of the video game and wanted to make it more of a war movie, something heavier than I thought it should be. So I think they just never liked my script."<ref name="TNMC"/> As Romero's script was a close, but not full, adaptation of the game, Capcom believed fans would feel that the movie had been altered too much from the game, and that newcomers would dislike the premise.<ref name="TNMC">{{cite news| title= TNMC Movie News: Resident Evil| publisher= tnmc.org| date= [[1999-11-29]]| url= http://www.tnmc.org/gnews/residentevil.shtml | accessdate= 2006-01-27}}</ref> 

Hired by Sony, [[Paul W.S. Anderson]] then wrote a screenplay, which was ultimately favored over Romero's.<ref name="TNMC"/> In late 2000, Anderson was announced as director and writer, and ''Resident Evil'' re-entered pre-production stages.<ref>{{cite web| title= Info & Tidbits On Resident Evil| publisher= [[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url= http://au.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil/about.php| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref>

=== Casting ===
In early 2001, [[Michelle Rodriguez]],<ref name="cast">{{cite news| title= Michelle Rodriguez to take on "Resident Evil"| publisher= countingdown.com| date= [[2001-03-14]]| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=13841| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> [[James Purefoy]]<ref>{{cite news| title= James Purefoy Joins Film| publisher= countingdown.com| date= [[2001-03-14]]| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=13847| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> and [[Milla Jovovich]]<ref>{{cite news| title= Milla Jovovich ready for Action!| publisher= countingdown.com| date= [[2001-03-14]]| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=13853| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> were the first of the cast to be signed on the project. [[David Boreanaz]] was originally intended to portray the male cop lead of [[Matt Addison]], however turned down the role to continue work on the [[The WB Television Network|WB]] series [[Angel (TV series)|Angel]].<ref name="Boreanaz">{{cite news| title= David Boreanaz cast in| publisher= countingdown.com| date= [[2001-03-14]]| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=13844| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> Boreanaz suggested that he was in negotiations to have a smaller role in the film claiming "Resident Evil is still there, a possibility, So, yeah, I'll see what happens",<ref name="Boreanaz"/>, however, he later declined the role. The role of Matt Addison was then given to [[Eric Mabius]] who was later cast in March 2001.<ref name="Boreanaz"/>

[[Heike Makatsch]] was also cast as Matt Addison's sister [[Lisa Addison]], who was an employee working for [[Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella's]] [[The Hive (Resident Evil)|Hive facility]].<ref name="Official">{{cite news| title= Official Information Released| publisher= countingdown.com| date= [[2001-03-16]]| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=13974| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref>

===Production and story development===
In early March 2001, it was revealed that half of the film would be shot in [[Germany]], Studios Adlershof in [[Berlin]], and numerous other locations around Berlin.<ref name="Locations">{{cite news| title= Shooting Locations for "Resident Evil"| publisher= countingdown.com| date= [[2001-03-14]]| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=13842| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> On [[March 5]], [[2001]] the film began an eleven week [[Film production#Production|principle photography]] shoot at numerous locations including the then unfinished station ''Reichstag'' of the [[Berlin U-Bahn]], Landsberger Allee, Kaserne Krampnitz and the Schloss Linstedt.<ref name="Tomatoes">{{cite web| title= Resident Evil| publisher= [[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url= http://au.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil/about.php| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> These locations served as part of the films setting including [[Spencer Mansion|The Spencer Mansion]] and [[The Hive (Resident Evil)|The Hive]].

The film's score and [[Resident Evil (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] were composed by [[Clint Mansell]],<ref>{{cite news| title= Clint Mansell Will Handle Music| publisher= countingdown.com| date= [[2001-03-14]]| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=13848| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> [[Marco Beltrami]] and [[Marilyn Manson]]<ref>{{cite news| title= Marilyn Manson Talks About Scoring Film| publisher= countingdown.com| date= [[2001-11-15]]| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=350040| accessdate= 2007-12-02}}</ref> during mid 2001. Manson described the score and soundtrack as being more "[[Electronica|electronic]]" than any of his other previous work.<ref>{{cite news| title= Marilyn Manson Talks About Scoring Film| publisher= countingdown.com| date= [[2001-03-15]]| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=350040| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref>

The film was originally subtitled as ''"Resident Evil: Ground Zero"''<ref name="Locations"/><ref>{{cite web| title= Small Title Change| publisher= countingdown.com| date= [[2001-08-11]]| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=285623| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> when the movie was considered a [[prequel]] to the games, however the subtitle was removed in due to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite web| title= Trivia| publisher= [[Internet Movie Database]]| url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120804/trivia| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> The film's first plot was revealed on [[March 16]], [[2001]] which revealed that Milla's character [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] and Rodriguez's character Rain were leaders of a [[Commando|commando team]] sent in to prevent a [[Viruses in the Resident Evil series#T-Virus|viral outbreak]] from spreading to the rest of the world,<ref name="Official"/> however those details were later changed. 

Paul Anderson initially toyed with the idea of the film being an allegory to ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', but the idea was not followed through.<ref name="Tomatoes"/> Despite that, the movie contains various references to the work.<ref>{{cite web| title= Movie Connections to Resident Evil| publisher= [[Internet Movie Database]]| url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120804/movieconnections| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> The obvious being the main character's name, another is the use of a white rabbit for testing the T-Virus. The wall that opens to the train station appears as a mirror (''[[Through the Looking Glass]]''), the [[Red Queen and White Queen|Red Queen]] and her behavior, wanting to behead/kill people, are also references to the book; the Red Queen's first kill is actually a beheading. In addition to relating to ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', the Red Queen's character was added into the film's story as a [[homage]] to [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]] and allusion to [[HAL 9000]].<ref name="Tomatoes"/>

===The zombies===
To make sure that the zombies (though the word ''zombie'' is never used during the film) would move appropriately throughout the film, professional dancers were hired because they had better control over their body movement than most. The most notable is the axe-wielding, bald scientist. The entrance scene where a shot of the zombie's dislocated ankle is shown did not require any special effects, because the actor could actually dislocate his ankle. While computer effects were used on some zombies, much of the undead look was largely accomplished through make-up.

Paul Anderson noted that when a director gives examples of how a zombie "should" move, almost every actor is going to do just that, with little variation. The resulting shot is laughable instead of terrifying. So, Anderson took a more laissez-faire approach: he told his actors to move however they thought a zombie would, given their condition, and left it at that. The actors, forced to be independently creative for their movements, came up with a wide variety of physical affectations, and the result was a large number of non-repetitive zombies.

Regardless, there was a shortage of manpower throughout the production, which is why people otherwise not affiliated with the film were used as zombies. Most notably producer [[Jeremy Bolt]] appears as a zombie twice during the film. He is seen in a brief shot where J.D. guns him down, and he also bites Rain's arm when she tries to save J.D. The stunt coordinator of the movie also appears as the dog trainer. Bolt's girlfriend and sister also appear as zombies: his girlfriend is the zombie who bites Kaplan's leg while his sister portrays the drowned scientist.

===Reaction and aftermath===
The film was commercially successful, grossing [[USD|$]]17,707,106 on its opening weekend ([[March 15]]-[[March 17|17]] [[2002]]). The film gained [[USD|$]]40,119,709 domestically and $102,441,078 worldwide.<ref>{{cite web| title= Resident Evil| publisher= boxofficemojo.com| url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=residentevil.htm| accessdate= 2007-12-02}}</ref> ''Resident Evil'' received many negative reactions from the [[film critic|critics]] and received only a 34% fresh, on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which counted 36 "Fresh" of a total 110
reviews.<ref>{{cite web| title= Resident Evil (2002)| url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil/| accessdate= 2007-12-02}}</ref> Tom Sander from the ''South Florida Sun Sentinel'' stated "It's spooky, [[suspense]]ful and jump-out-of-your-seat scary", however, ''Dave Grove'' from [[Film Threat]] noted that "I'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film."

Both ''Resident Evil'' and the sequel appear on [[Roger Ebert]]'s most hated films list, published in 2005.<ref>{{cite web| title= Ebert's Most Hated | publisher= rogerebert.suntimes.com| date= [[2005-08-11]]| url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050811/COMMENTARY/50808002| accessdate= 2007-12-02}}</ref> In the review of ''Resident Evil'', Ebert describes the film as a [[zombie]] movie set in the 21st century where "large metallic objects make crashing noises just by being looked at". He also explains that the film's "characters have no small talk. Their dialogue consists of commands, explanations, [and] exclamations".<ref>{{cite web| title= Resident Evil| publisher= rogerebert.suntimes.com| date= [[2002-03-15]]| url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020315/REVIEWS/203150304/1023| accessdate= 2007-12-02}}</ref>

After commercial success at the [[box office]], a  sequel, ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]'', was released in [[2004]]. In 2007, the third film ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'' was released. Anderson did not direct the films but instead functioned as the scriptwriter and producer on both. The sequels were directed by [[Alexander Witt]] and [[Russell Mulcahy]] respectively.

==Relationship to the games==
The film borrows many plot elements from the video game series. Although the film is a [[prequel]] to the video game series,<ref name="References"/> elements are borrowed from numerous video games including [[Resident Evil 2]] and [[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]],<ref name="References">{{cite web| title=References| publisher= imdb.com| url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120804/trivia| accessdate= 2007-12-03}}</ref> where Alice's character awakes in [[Raccoon City]] Hospital with a viral outbreak occurring in the city. There are several references to characters and organizations such as the [[Umbrella Corporation]], the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]] program, the underground [[train]] reading out ''Alexi-5000'' (which is the exact train from Resident Evil 2 and reference to ''[[Resident Evil Code: Veronica]]'''s villain [[Alexia Ashford]]) and where Alice takes out a [[shotgun]] from a police cruiser reading out a ''[[Special Tactics And Rescue Service|S.T.A.R.S.]]'' logo on the hood of the police car.<ref name="References"/> [[Jason Isaacs]] appears in the film as an uncredited masked surgeon (which is a reference to [[William Birkin]]). The character of [[Dr. Sam Isaacs|Dr. Isaacs]] (played by [[Iain Glen]]) in the film's sequel's is dedicated to or based on him.<ref name="DVD">{{cite video| people= Paul W.S. Anderson| title= ''Resident Evil Commentary''| medium= DVD| publisher= Sony Entertainment| date= 2002}}</ref>

Another reference to the first game includes where Alice examines the [[Arklay Research Facility#Spencer Mansion in other media|mansion]] by going outside to find crows visible for a very short moment; these crows were all digitized. In the video game series, murders of crows are minor enemies that the player encounters throughout each game.<ref name="References"/> Other references include where Alice finds a picture of her wedding day with [[Spence Parks|Spence]], which is the same style as the photos in the first version of the ''Resident Evil'' game: in black and white with the foreground image (in this case, Alice and Spencer) noticeably spliced onto the background (the room behind them).<ref name="References"/> On the newspaper at the end of the movie, the words ''"Horror in Raccoon! More Victims Dead!"'' are shown in the upper right corner. This is a reference to the same newspaper in the censored opening of the original ''[[Resident Evil (video game)|Resident Evil]]'' game and the prologue chapter for the ''[[Resident Evil: The Umbrella Conspiracy]]'' novel.<ref name="References"/> Also, bear the beginning of the film, Alice examines a statue after the wind blows its cover off. This statue is similar in design to one in the mansion of the first game, and which contains the map of the ground floor.<ref name="References"/>

When going back to the Red Queen's chamber Kaplan points out that the four bodies of the group's dead crew from the ''Glass Hallway Trap'' sequence are gone. This is a reference to a noticeable trait in the games, where when a character leaves the room where they've killed zombies and then comes back, the bodies that were once there have disappeared.<ref name="References"/> The film also borrows a plot element from ''Resident Evil 2'' in which Leon and [[Claire Redfield|Claire]] have to escape the underground labs by taking the train and have a showdown with a large creature in the back of the car. When the survivors make their escape from the Hive with a countdown as they fight the ''final boss'', this is a reference to every ''Resident Evil'' game also ends with a five minute countdown during which the final boss must be defeated.<ref name="References"/>

=== Filming elements ===
Director Paul Anderson has stated that the film's [[camera angle]]s and several shot's allude to the video game's.<ref name="DVD"/> These include a scene near the beginning where there is a close up of Alice's eye. This is a direct reference to the title screen of the [[Resident Evil (video game)|first game]].<ref name="DVD"/> Another scene includes where Alice's awakes and hears a creepy outdoor sound which is also a reference to the plot of the first game.<ref name="DVD"/> Various camera angles throughout the movie also reference the game series, such as the fight between Alice and the security guard.<ref name="DVD"/>

=== References in video games ===
Numerous elements from the film have been referenced in several of the video games released after the film's original release. This includes the laser corridor sequence which appeared in both ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (where [[Leon S. Kennedy]] has to evade a security trap)<ref name="Gamefaqs>{{cite news| title= Resident Evil 4 Laser Corridor| publisher= gamefaqs.com| date= [[2005-03-15]]| url= http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/gamecube/file/535840/34817| accessdate= 2007-11-28}}</ref> and ''[[Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles]]'' (where [[Chris Redfield]] and [[Jill Valentine]] have to evade a trap in Umbrella's European facility).<ref>{{cite video| title= Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles Laser Room

==Game and movie differences==
* Alice does not exist in any of the games. The only main (and playable) female characters in the ''Resident Evil'' series are; [[Jill Valentine]], [[Claire Redfield]], and [[Rebecca Chambers]]. [[Ada Wong]], though playable, would not be considered as a main character despite being mentioned. Sherry Birkin, daughter of William Birkin was also briefly playable in ''Resident Evil 2''. However, she is a supporting character.

* [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]] is the result of implanting an experimental parasite into a regular mass-produced [[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]] (a creature not featured in the film).

* The mansion on the outskirts is only one part of an expansive estate used to house Umbrella employees and conduct viral research in secret. The house was built by architect [[George Trevor]] for Umbrella President [[Ozwell E. Spencer]] and is nicknamed the "Spencer Mansion" because of this. An Umbrella laboratory ([[Arklay Research Facility]]) is located in the mansion's basement level. On the opposite of the film, nobody lives in it.
