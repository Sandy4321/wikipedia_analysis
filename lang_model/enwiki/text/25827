'''David "Giller" McGill''' (born 24 October 1981, in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) is an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Association football|football]] [[midfielder|central midfielder]] who is currently without a club after being released by [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] at the end of the 2011 season.

==Career==

===Early career===
McGill played his entire youth career from Under 8's and up with [[Manortown United]].  With Manortown, he won both league and cup titles as well as being named the Club Man of the Year while with the Under 16's.

===UNC Charlotte===
He eventually decided to attend college in the [[United States]], enrolling at the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] in 2000.  McGill made an instant impact with the [[Charlotte 49ers]], appearing in 18 games, starting 17 of those.  He scored 1 goal, assisted on 7 others, en route to score 9 points on the season.<ref>[http://charlotte49ers.cstv.com/sports/m-soccer/archive/071601aac.html 2000 Statistics] From http://charlotte49ers.cstv.com, Posted 9 November 2000.</ref>  His 7 assists lead the team.

His second season with the team in 2001 wasn't as productive, with him playing in 20 games while only starting 14 of them.  He scored 1 goal and had 3 assists for a total of 5 points.<ref>[http://charlotte49ers.cstv.com/sports/m-soccer/stats/072502aaa.html 2001 Final Statistics] From http://charlotte49ers.cstv.com, Posted 16 November 2001.</ref>  His 3 assists were good enough to tie him for the team lead.

With the 49ers, McGill scored 2 goals and 10 assists for 14 points.  He was named to [[Conference USA]]'s All Freshman Team in 2000 as well as being named to the Second Team All-[[Conference USA]].<ref>[http://conferenceusa.cstv.com/sports/m-soccer/spec-rel/111400aaa.html SLU's Jewsbury and Davis, Memphis' Grant and UAB's Clemente Honored] From http://conferenceusa.cstv.com, Posted 14 November 2000.</ref>  In addition, he was the MVP of the 2000 Puma Classic.  Following the completion of the 2001 season, McGill sought to transfer schools and left UNC Charlotte for UC Santa Barbara.

===UC Santa Barbara===
McGill enrolled at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] for his junior year in 2002.<ref>[http://ucsbgauchos.cstv.com/sports/m-soccer/spec-rel/051602aaa.html Preview Of The Recruiting Class For The 2002 Men's Soccer Season] From http://ucsbgauchos.cstv.com, Posted 16 May 2002.</ref>  With the [[UCSB Soccer|UC Santa Barbara men's soccer team]], McGill played in 21 games, starting 20 of them.  He netted 3 times, assisted on 15 others for 21 points.<ref>[http://ucsbgauchos.cstv.com/sports/m-soccer/archive/042703aaa.html 2002 Final Statistics] From http://ucsbgauchos.cstv.com, Posted 29 November 2002.</ref>  He was named to the Second Team All-[[Big West Conference]] and his assist total was good for 5th in the nation and 2nd in the conference, trailing teammate [[Memo Arzate]]'s 18.  He also assisted on UC Santa Barbara's first ever [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] post season goal when he passed to [[Rob Friend]] against the [[University of San Diego]].

His second season was just as productive as the first, appearing in 18 games and starting 17 of them. He registered another 9 assists.<ref>[http://ucsbgauchos.cstv.com/sports/m-soccer/archive/061404aaa.html Final Overall Statistics] From http://ucsbgauchos.cstv.com, Posted 27 November 2002.</ref> The team, again, made the post season but lost to [[Cal]] in the 2nd Round.  However, McGill's performances had professionals taking note. The [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] drafted him in the [[2004 MLS SuperDraft]].  He went in the 4th round, 33rd overall. Despite the honour, McGill passed on [[Major League Soccer]], instead opting to sign with [[Dublin City F.C.|Dublin City]] in his native [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

===Dublin City & Mount Merrion===
McGill returned to Ireland in 2004 and joined [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] side [[Dublin City F.C.|Dublin City]].  McGill broke into the Vikings first team upon his return, but was one of 14 players released by new Vikings boss [[Roddy Collins]] in a mid-season cull for the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] strugglers.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2004/0815/collinsr.html Roddy swings axe at City] www.rte.ie</ref>  McGill joined [[Leinster Senior League (association football)|Leinster Senior League]] side Mount Merrion YMCA for the remainder of the [[League of Ireland 2004|2004 season]] before rejoining [[Dublin City F.C.|Dublin City]] for the [[League of Ireland 2005|2005 season]]. That season, McGill helped the Vikings to promotion to the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] after scoring Dublin City's winning goal in the first leg of a two-legged play-off victory over [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]].<ref>[http://www.irishfootballonline.com/news/3945.html Vikings lead after first leg of play-off] www.irishfootballonline.com</ref><ref>[http://www.irishfootballonline.com/news/3960.html Vikings promoted at Hoops' expense] www.irishfootballonline.com</ref>  McGill remained at Dublin City for the [[League of Ireland 2006|2006 season]] as part of their [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] campaign until the Vikings went out of existence due severe financial issues in July 2006.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/sport/2006/0719/dublincity.html Dublin City FC bow out of eircom League] www.rte.ie</ref>

===Shamrock Rovers===
McGill did not wait long to find a new club when he joined [[League of Ireland First Division]] leaders [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]]. A lifelong Rovers fan, he made his debut for the club on 28 July 2006 against [[Athlone Town A.F.C.|Athlone Town]] at St. Mels Park in a 3-0 victory for the Hoops<ref>[http://www.shamrockrovers.ie/reports/2006_07_28_vathlone.php Athlone Town 0 Shamrock Rovers 3] www.shamrockrovers.ie</ref> and went to win the First Division with two goals in fourteen appearances.  He made a total of 29 appearances scoring twice in his time at the Hoops.

===Mount Merrion & Shelbourne===
McGill departed Rovers in August 2007 and he rejoined his former club Mount Merrion YMCA later that month. McGill's second stint at Mount Merrion was again short-lived when he made a return to [[League of Ireland First Division]] action by signing for [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] on 29 November 2007.<ref>[http://www.shelbournefc.com/news.php?id=790 NEWSFLASH - Dermot signs twelve for 2008] www.shelbournefc.com</ref>  McGill made his [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] debut in a scoreless draw against [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]] at [[Tolka Park]] on 7 March 2008.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/0307/shelbourne_dundalk_1.html Shelbourne 0-0 Dundalk] www.rte.ie</ref> He scored his first Shelbourne goal during a 1-0 victory over [[Wexford Youths F.C.|Wexford Youths]] at [[Tolka Park]] on 17 October 2008.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/1017/shelbourne_wexford.html Shelbourne 1-0 Wexford Youths] www.rte.ie</ref> During the 2011 season he was injured against [[Salthill Devon]] ruling him out for the rest of the season.<ref>[http://extratime.ie/fixtures/detail/12818/2/] Extratime.ie</ref>
