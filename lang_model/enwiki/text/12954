'''Bosnians''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Bosanci'' / ''<U+0411><U+043E><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0446><U+0438>''; sing. ''Bosanac'' / ''<U+0411><U+043E><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0446>'') are people who reside in, or come from, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], it is also used as a [[nationality]]. By the modern state definition a Bosnian can be anyone who holds a [[citizenship]] in the state, this includes but is not limited to members of the constituent ethnic groups of Bosnia and Herzegovina: [[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]]. 
Although it should be noted that people which reside in the [[Herzegovina]] part of Bosnia and Herzegovina prefer to call themselves Herzegovians in the regional sense. 
Ethnic minorities such as: [[Bosnian Jews|Jews]], [[Roma people|Roma]], [[Albanians]], [[Montenegrins]], and others may consider ''Bosnian'' to be attached to their ethnicity (eg. ''Bosnian Albanians''). These are not confined to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as over 8,000 Slavic Muslims or migrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina in [[Slovenia]] declare Bosnian ethnicity.

In addition, there is a sizable population in Bosnia and Herzegovina who believe that Bosnians are a nation holding a distinct collective [[cultural identity]]. By this usage, a Bosnian would be an individual who belonged to this culture. They assert that this collective identity is capable of diminishing or overcoming existing political and ethnic divisions.<ref>[http://www.zabih.ba/izbori2006/nacrt_ustava_bih.pdf], from [[Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] website</ref>

In a 2007 survey conducted by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), 57% of the surveyors identified an ethnic designation as the primary one, while 43% opted for "being a citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina". However, 75% of the surveyors answered positively to the question "As well as thinking of yourself as a [Bosniak, Croat, Serb],
do you also think of yourself as being a citizen of the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina?". In the same survey, 43% said that they identify as a citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina as the primary identity, 14% identified themselves solely with their specific ethnic or religious group, while 41% expressed the dual identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.ba/?PID=7&RID=413|title=UNDP Published a Major Research on Return, Identity, Politics and Social Trust|publisher=United Nations Development Programme for Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=2007-07-07|accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.ba/download.aspx?id=882|title=Pulse of the citizenry|publisher=United Nations Development Programme for Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=2007-07-07|accessdate=2007-07-27|pages=19-20}} (Internet Explorer-only link)</ref>

==History==
{{see|History of Bosnia|Bosniak history}}

The earliest cultural and linguistic roots of Bosnian history can be traced back to the [[Migration Period]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]]. It was then that the [[Serbs]], [[Croats]], and other [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] from northeastern Europe, invaded the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] with their [[Eurasian Avars|Avar]] overlords and settled the [[Balkan peninsula]]. There, they mixed with the indigenous paleo-Balkan peoples known collectively as the [[Illyrians]]. From the chaos of the [[Dark Ages]], from 800 AD, the [[Croat]]ian and [[Serb]]ian tribes coalesced into early principalities. As these expanded, they came to include other Slavic tribes and territories, and later evolved into centralized Kingdoms. The Croats to the west swore allegiance to [[Rome]], influenced by neighboring Catholic kingdoms, while the Serbs to the east fell under [[Byzantine]] influence and embraced Orthodoxy; cementing their separate identities. In contrast, there was no prominent tribe in Bosnia, and an independent Bosnian state did not arise until much later. Prior to this, the core Bosnian lands (between the Drina and Bosna rivers) was in a near-constant state of flux between Serb and Croat rule. In the twelfth century, a semi-independent Bosnian ''banovina'' arose which was characterised by a weak religious structure and unclear ethnic affiliation. It rose to become a [[Bosnian kingdom|powerful kingdom]] in the fourteenth century, when the designation [[Bo<U+0161>njani]] was first used to sometimes describe the kingdom's inhabitants. It was probably a regional name derived from the river [[Bosna]] which flows through the heart of the country. Before the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]], the river was called the ''Bosona'' by the native [[Illyrians]], and some scholars speculate that the name Bosnia itself derives from this term.

The Bosnian kingdom grew and expanded under the [[Kotromanic|Kotromanic dynasty]] to include Croatian and Serbian territories. As a consequence, even more Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians dwelt within its borders, along with adherents of a native [[Bosnian Church]] whose origins and nature are a subject of continued debate among scholars. Those belonging to this sect simply called themselves ''Krstjani'' ("Christians"). Many scholars have argued that these Bosnian Krstjani were [[Manichaean]] dualists related to the [[Bogomils]] of Bulgaria, while others question this theory, citing lack of historical evidence. Both Catholic and Orthodox Church authorities considered the Bosnian Church heretical, and launched vigorous proselytizing campaigns to stem its influence. As a result of these divisions, no coherent religious identity developed in medieval Bosnia as it had in Croatia and Serbia.

As the centuries passed, the Bosnian kingdom slowly began to decline. It had become fractured by increased political and religious disunity. By then, the [[Ottoman Turks]] had already gained a foothold in the [[Balkans]]; first defeating the Serbs at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] and expanding westward, the Turks eventually conquered all of Bosnia and portions of neighboring [[Turkish Croatia|Croatia]]. These developments would alter Bosnian history forever, introducing an Islamic component into the already confounded Bosnian ethno-religious identity. The Bosnian Church would forever disappear, although the circumstances under which it did are as hotly debated as its nature and origins. Some historians contend that the Bosnian ''Krstjani'' converted en masse to Islam, seeking refuge from Catholic and Orthodox persecution, while others argue that the Bosnian Church had already ceased to operate many decades before the Turkish conquest. Whatever the case, a distinct [[Slavic Muslim]] community developed under Ottoman rule in Bosnia, giving rise to the modern [[Bosniaks]].

During the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1878 to 1918, the administration of [[Benjamin Kallay]], the Austro-Hungarian governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, enforced the idea of a strengthened unitary Bosnian nation (Bosanci) that would incorporate Muslim Bosnians as well as the Bosnian Catholics and Bosnian Orthodox Christians, who at that time were slowly beginning to separate into distinct peoples which threatened to destabilize Bosnia. Kallay symbolized the new nation with a structured, modern introduction of an official Bosnian flag, Bosnian language and coat of arms. In this way the Bosnian distinctiveness was strengthened and more importantly underlined and distanced from Serbian and Croatian nationalist interests in Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=plut> Plut, Dijana; (2002)
 <U+201C>What is Democracy in Textbooks?<U+201D> pg. 117-118 </ref>. However, another view is that rather than being a reflection of reality or a concern for Bosnian people, the Austrian actions were merely self-serving. As Serbia grew into a regional power and possible focus of a united South Slavic state, Austria's interests were threatened- these being: to preserve its multi-ethnic empire and further expand its influence in the Balkans. She aimed to this by keeping the South Slavic people separate via embedding ideas within them that they are distinct peoples, as is the old axiom "divide and conquer". Some Bosnian Muslim notables jumped at the idea, no doubt partly because they saw an opportunity to promote their personal power by avoiding Serbian or Croatian influence<ref> An Illustrated History of Modern Europe. Denis Richards</ref>.

The idea was fiercely opposed by [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]], as it came at a time when neighboring [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]] were reinforcing their national and ethnic identity in the process of building their own [[nation state]]s.  Famous contemporary Bosniak writer [[Safvet-beg Basagic]] tells in his own words: ''Don't you know Bosniak, there was a time not long ago - at most 15 summers, when in our proud Bosnia and heroic land Herzegovina, from [[Trebinje]] (south) to [[Bosanski brod]] (north), a single Serb or Croat didn't walk. But today, through their whims, strangers spread from both directions (Serbia and Croatia). [...] Both guests have arrived, in a gentle false way, to take the most holy away from us - our proud and dear name (Bosniaks).{{Fact|date=February 2008}}  

During the time when Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of [[Yugoslavia]] and heavily influenced by Croat and Serb politics neither of the two terms 
''Bosnian'' or ''Bosniak'' were recognized as a nation. Thus, Bosnian Muslims and anyone who confessed themselves to Bosnian ethnicity were listed under the category "regional affiliation" by the Yugoslavian statistics. This also applied to the last census in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1991. However, because of this, census format in former Yugoslavia was often subject of political manipulation. As a matter of fact, Muslim Bosnians requested the option ''Bosnian'' in the constitutional amendments of 1947 and 1973, but instead they had to declare themselves either as Serbs or Croats until 1963, "undecideds" or "Muslim in a national sense" (with lower case m) until 1973, and [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] (with capital M) until 1993. 

In 1990 the name [[Bosniaks]] was re-introduced to replace the term Muslim but it was too late for that term to be realistically accepted by non-Muslim ethnic groups in Bosnia. 

This resulted in Bosniak, or even Muslim, as terms being (re)coined recently as a political compromise. Peculiarly enough, in the present day Bosnia it is practically impossible for a citizen to declare her/himself as Bosnian. Due to widespread practices in the Ottoman empire, the distinction (for taxation purposes, military service etc.) was made based mainly on religion and this heritage only contributed to the ethnic chaos in the Balkans that followed in the wake of its retreat from Europe.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

In 1999, a Bosnian child born in [[Sarajevo]] was announced as the symbolic 6 billionth person in the world to mark the world population reaching this milestone.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/471908.stm|title=Population reaches six billion|publisher=BBC News|date=1999-10-12|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>

==Bosnians in respect to religion==

The graphics illustrate the breakdown by religion of Primary (BiH), Dual (BiH and ethno-religious) and Exclusive (only ethno-religious) identities]] 

Bosnians are as multi-religious a society as they are multi-ethnic, but this is not to say that its component religions and ethnicities are homogeneous and independent from each other.

According to Tone Bringa, an author and anthropologist, in respect to Bosnia and Bosnians she states that "''Neither [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], nor [[Croat]], nor [[Serb]] identities can be fully understood with reference only to [[Islam]] or [[Christianity]] respectively but have to be considered in a specific Bosnian context that has resulted in a shared history and locality among Bosnians of Islamic as well as Christian backgrounds.''"  According to Bringa, in Bosnia there is a singular, <U+201C>trans-ethnic culture<U+201D> that encompassed each ethnicity and makes different faiths, including Christianity and Islam, <U+201C>[[synergy|synergistically]] [[interdependent]]<U+201D>. <ref name=Bringa> Bringa, Tone; Being Muslim the Bosnian Way ISBN 0-691-00175-8 </ref>

Still, large numbers of Bosnians are [[Secularism|secular]] which is a trend that has more profoundly found root in last 60 years in Bosnia and Herzegovina as they were [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1945<U+2013>1992)|part of]] the [[Communism|Communist system]] that rejected traditional organized religion.

==Genetics==
{{see|Genetic history of Europe}}
In 2005 various South European medical schools and institutions specializing in [[human genetics]] did an analysis of the variation at 28 [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome markers]] among a sample of males from throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, relatively equally split among all three major ethnic groups.<ref name=Geneticstudy>Marjanovi<U+0107>, Damir; et al. "[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16266413&dopt=Abstract The peopling of modern Bosnia-Herzegovina: Y-chromosome haplogroups in the three main ethnic groups]." ''Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, [[University of Sarajevo]].'' November, 2005</ref> 
The most notable find was the high frequency of  [[Haplogroup I (Y-DNA)|haplogroup I]]; specifically its subclade [[Haplogroup I2 (Y-DNA)|I-P37 (I2a)]], which had a frequency of 71% among [[Bosnian Croats]], 44% among [[Bosniaks]], and 31% among [[Bosnian Serbs]]. A similar study in Croatia found that [[Croatian Croats]] had a frequency of about 45%, but that among them Croats in Dalmatia had a particularly high frequency (around two thirds).<ref name=Geneticstudy>Marjanovi<U+0107>, Damir; et al. "[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16266413&dopt=Abstract The peopling of modern Bosnia-Herzegovina: Y-chromosome haplogroups in the three main ethnic groups]." ''Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, [[University of Sarajevo]].'' November, 2005.</ref>

Subclade I2a* is typical of [[South Slavs]], especially [[Croats]] and [[Bosnians]]. Another subclade, I2a1 (formerly I1b1b, I1b2), is strongly associated with indigenous [[Sardinia]]ns, but it is also found at low to moderate frequency among populations of the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] in general, [[France]], mainland [[Italy]], the [[British Isles]], and [[Sweden]]. Contrasting with the tendentially southeastern distribution of I2a* and southwestern distribution of I2a1, the subclade I2b is most commonly found among populations of [[Northwest Europe]], especially [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[British Isles]].

==Bosnians today==
Recently, the denial of Bosnian nationhood, as a unifying trait of those who stem from Bosnia and Herzegovina, has generally been used by some political factions to drive the constituent ethnicities of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] further apart.

Because of this pressure and because of its complex history Bosnian national identity today remains a complex issue among its adherents.  Variably members of the Bosnian nation, of various ethnic and religious backgrounds who live or stem from Bosnia and Herzegovina, define themselves Bosnians primarily as they feel they belong to the same geographical region which characterizes them with particular cultural and historical traits.  However, many choose to declare themselves as Bosnian as a method for overcoming ethnic animosities aroused by the recent war.  Due to more recent war and massive relocations of Bosnians they have experienced a significant internationalization of their identity with many considering themselves as having dual identity (one as Bosnians and another of the country where they currently live).  As a result in diaspora Bosnians have shown tendencies towards more or less successful organizing into viable Bosnian communities.

Given heavy involvement of the European community in political integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnian nationalization issue is viewed by some as a contemporary European experiment strikingly similar to modern [[Europeanism]] movement.
