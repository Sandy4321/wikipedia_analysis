'''Grus''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|<U+0261>|r|<U+028C>|s}}, or colloquially {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|<U+0261>|r|u<U+02D0>|s}}) is a [[constellation]] in the [[southern sky]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for the [[crane (bird)|crane]], a type of bird. It is one of twelve constellations conceived by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]]. Grus first appeared on a 35-cm (14&nbsp;in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and [[Jodocus Hondius]] and was depicted in [[Johann Bayer]]'s star atlas ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.  French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] gave [[Bayer designation]]s to its stars in 1756, some of which had been previously considered part of the neighbouring constellation [[Piscis Austrinus]]. The constellations Grus, [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]], [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]] and [[Tucana]] are collectively known as the "Southern Birds".

The constellation's brightest star, [[Alpha Gruis]], is also known as Alnair and appears as a 1.7-[[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] blue-white star. [[Beta Gruis]] is a [[red giant]] [[variable star]] with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. Six star systems have been found to have [[exoplanet|planets]]: the red dwarf [[Gliese 832]] is one of the closest stars to Earth that has a planetary system. Another<U+2014>[[WASP-95]]<U+2014>has a planet that orbits every two days. [[Deep-sky object]]s found in Grus include the [[planetary nebula]] [[IC 5148]], also known as the Spare Tyre Nebula, and a group of four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet.

==History==
[[File:Grus and Piscis Austrinus from Atlas Coelestis.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|The constellations Grus and [[Piscis Austrinus]], which once formed a single constellation, as depicted in ''Atlas Coelestis'' by [[Johann Doppelmayr]], ca. 1742]]

The stars that form Grus were originally considered part of the neighbouring constellation [[Piscis Austrinus]] (the southern fish), with [[Gamma Gruis]] seen as part of the fish's tail.<ref name=tiriongrus>{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/grus.htm | title=Grus | work= Star Tales |author=[[Ian Ridpath|Ridpath, Ian]]|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 8 February 2014}}</ref> The stars were first defined as a separate constellation by  the Dutch astronomer [[Petrus Plancius]], who created twelve new constellations based on the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]], who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the ''[[First Dutch Expedition to Indonesia|Eerste Schipvaart]]'', to the [[East Indies]]. Grus first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in [[Amsterdam]] by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]].

An alternative name for the constellation, ''Phoenicopterus'' (Latin "[[flamingo]]"), was used briefly during the early 17th century, seen in the 1605 work ''Cosmographiae Generalis'' by Paul Merula of [[Leiden University]] and a c. 1625 globe by Dutch globe maker Pieter van den Keere. Astronomer Ian Ridpath has reported the symbolism likely came from Plancius originally, who had worked with both of these people.<ref name=tiriongrus/> Grus and the nearby constellations [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]], [[Tucana]] and [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] are collectively called the "Southern Birds".<ref name="binocs">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Patrick|author-link=Patrick Moore|title=Exploring the Night Sky with Binoculars|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |year=2000|page=48|isbn=978-0-521-79390-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Jvbtl2Vyxm4C&pg=PA48}}</ref>

The stars that correspond to Grus were generally too far south to be seen from China.

[[Alpha Gruis|Alpha]] and [[Beta Gruis]], along with [[Fomalhaut]], [[Alpha Pavonis]] and the stars of [[Musca]], were all claimed by the Arrernte.<ref name="noctuary">{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Diane|title=Night Skies of Aboriginal Australia: a Noctuary|publisher=University of Sydney|location=Darlington, New South Wales|year=1998|pages=70<U+2013>72|isbn=1-86451-356-X}}</ref>
