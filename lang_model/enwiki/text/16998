'''''Sonderbehandlung''''' (abbr. '''''S.B.''''') is a [[German language|German]] [[noun]] meaning ''special treatment'' in [[English language|English]], also existing as a verb: ''sonderbehandeln'' (to treat specially). While it can refer to any sort of preferential treatment, it is known primarily as a [[euphemism]] used by [[Nazi Party|Nazi functionaries]] and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] for murder. It first came to prominence during [[Action T4]], where SS doctors killed mentally ill and disabled patients between 1939 and 1941, and was one of a number of nonspecific words the Nazis used to document [[mass murder]] and [[genocide]]. These words were also used to imprecisely refer to the equipment used to perpetrate their crimes, such as [[gas chamber]]s and [[Zyklon B]]. The true meaning of ''Sonderbehandlung'' was widely known in the SS, and in April 1943, ''[[Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] was so concerned about the security of it that he had it redacted in a [[Korherr Report|secret report]].

Berel Lang states that disguised language was used "...not only in communications issued to the Jewish public when the intention of those issuing the communications was to deceive the Jews in order to minimize the likelihood of resistance, but also in addresses to the outside world and, perhaps more significantly, in internal communications as well, among officials who unquestionably knew (who were themselves sometimes responsible for) the linguistic substitutions stipulated by the language rules."<ref name=lang93>Lang (2003), p. 93</ref>

== Background ==
[[File:Karl Brandt SS-Arzt.jpg|thumb|upright|Dr. [[Karl Brandt]], [[Hitler]]'s personal physician and organiser of Action T4]]
By the summer of 1941, Action T4 became widespread public knowledge in Germany (and also in neutral countries and to Germany's enemies), and on August 24, 1941, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] ordered the joint chief of the operation Dr. [[Karl Brandt]] to halt it due to public protest (however it still continued, not only out of the public eye but in greater intensity).<ref name=friedlander111>Friedlander (1997), p. 111</ref> Hitler did not want to run the risk of an order publicly embarrassing him again and, as a result, the explicit order to carry out the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] was given by him orally. Even if there had been any written instances of this order, they would have almost certainly been destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable.<ref>{{cite web|title=Myth/Fact Sheet: Hitler never ordered the Holocaust|url=http://www.hdot.org/en/learning/myth-fact/hitlerorder.html|publisher=[[Emory University]]|accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> 

Where the Nazis had to document murder, ''Sonderbehandlung'' was one of a number of euphemisms used. The Action T4 doctors used "''desinfiziert''" (decontaminated) to document the gassing of mentally ill and handicapped individuals.<ref name=friedlander231>Friedlander (1997), p. 231</ref> The actual plan to exterminate the Jews of Europe was called "''Die Endl<U+00F6>sung der Judenfrage''" ([[Final Solution|Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]). Other words to describe extermination operations included:

*"''Evakuierung''" (evacuation)
*"''Aussiedlung''" (expulsion)
*"''Umsiedlung''" (resettlement)
*"''Auflockerung''" (thinning out <U+2013> as in the removal of inhabitants from a ghetto)<ref name=lang92>Lang (2003), p. 92</ref>
*"''Befriedungsaktion''" (pacification)<ref name=lang92/>
*"''Ausserordentliche Befriedungsaktion''" or "''A.B. Aktion''" (special pacification)<ref name=lang92/>
*"''Abwanderung''" (having-been-migrated)<ref name=lang92/>
*"''S<U+00E4>uberung''" (cleansing)<ref name=lang92/>
*"''Sicherheitspolizeilich durchgearbeitet''" (directed or worked through in a manner in accordance with the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'')<ref name=lang92/>

The [[Posen speeches]] made by Heinrich Himmler in October 1943 are the first known documents in which a high-ranking [[Cabinet Hitler|member of the Nazi government]] spoke explicitly about the perpetration of the Holocaust during the war. Himmler mentions the "''Judenevakuierung''" or "evacuation of the Jews", which he uses synonymously with their extermination.<ref name=thhphimmler>{{cite web|title=Heinrich Himmler's Speech at Poznan|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/himmler-poznan/|publisher=[[The Holocaust History Project]]|accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> At one point in the speech, Himmler says: "elimination of the Jews, extermination, we're doing it", briefly pausing in the middle of "elimination" (''Ausschaltung'') before going on to say "extermination" (''Ausrottung'').<ref name=thhphimmler/> His hesitation in the middle of saying "elimination" can be considered as a quick mental check to see whether or not it is acceptable to use such words in front of his given audience.<ref name=thhphimmler/> The answer is yes: it is the seniority of the SS in private. This has been compared to another incident of self-verification in the opposite way, where Josef Goebbels, in his [[Sportpalast speech|Total War speech]] on February 18, 1943, begins to say "Ausrottung des Judentums" ("extermination of Jewry") but switches to saying "Ausschaltung", bearing in mind that he is speaking very publicly.<ref name=thhphimmler/> His resulting phrasing is "Ausrott...schaltung des Judentums", which can be likened to "exterm...elimination" in English.<ref name=thhphimmler/>

== Usage ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-039-26, Reinhard Heydrich im Prager Schlo<U+00DF> crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Heydrich (left) with [[Karl Hermann Frank]] at [[Prague Castle]] in 1941]]
The term first appeared on September 20, 1939 in a decree by the [[Gestapo]] and ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' chief SS-''[[Obergruppenf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]] to all state police departments: 

:"''To avoid any misunderstandings, please take note of the following: ...a distinction must be made between those who may be dealt with in the usual way and those who must be given special treatment. The latter case covers subjects who, due to their most objectionable nature, their dangerousness, or their ability to serve as tools of propaganda for the enemy, are suitable for elimination, without respect for persons, by merciless treatment (namely, by execution).''<ref name=kogon6>Kogon ''et al'' (1994), p. 6</ref>

However, the usage is directed against Germans rather than Jews (it relates to "the principles of internal state security in the war"). Nevertheless, the law allowed for the killing of any person the regime wished. A memo dated six days later from a meeting at the ''[[SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' defines ''Sonderbehandlung'' with "execution" following it in brackets.<ref name=kogon6/>

A report from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] dated October 25, 1941, reads that "due to the grave danger of epidemic, the complete liquidation of Jews from the [[Vitebsk Ghetto|ghetto in Vitebsk]] was begun on October 8, 1941. The number of Jews to whom special treatment is to be applied is around 3,000."<ref name=kogon6/> An excerpt of a decree dated February 20, 1942, from the ''RSHA'' and written by Himmler regarding the treatment of "[[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|foreign civilian workers]]" advises that in particularly difficult cases, application should be made to the ''RSHA'' for special treatment, adding that "special treatment takes place by hanging."<ref name=thhpsb>{{cite web|title=Special treatment" (Sonderbehandlung)|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/quick-facts/special-treatment.shtml|publisher=The Holocaust History Project|accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> In a letter to the ''RSHA'', SS-''[[Hauptsturmf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' Heinz Tr<U+00FC>he requests additional [[gas van]]s for "...a transport of Jews, which has to be treated in a special way..."<ref name=zimmerman22>Zimmerman, John C. (2000), p. 22</ref> The gas vans were vehicles containing an airtight compartment in which the victims were locked and the [[exhaust gas]] was pumped into, killing the victims with the combined effects of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] and [[Asphyxia|suffocation]].

== Equipment ==
In German, "''Sonder-''", meaning "special", can be used to form [[Compound (linguistics)|compound nouns]]. As well as in reference to actions, the Nazis used euphemisms to refer to the actual equipment used to carry out killing. In his letter, Tr<U+00FC>he refers to the vans as "''S-wagen"'' (S-vans); "''Sonderwagen''" (special vans) in full. Other documented references include "''Sonderfahrzeug''" (special vehicle), "''Spezialwagen''" (special van), and "''Hilfsmittel''" (auxiliary equipment).<ref name=jvl>{{cite web|title=The Development of the Gas-Van in the Murdering of the Jews|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/vans.html|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> 

Several instances of this unspecific language in reference to equipment can be found in documents concerning [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. A letter dated August 21, 1942 referred to Bunker 1 and Bunker 2 (farmhouses west of [[Birkenau]] converted into gas chambers) as "''Badeanstalten f<U+00FC>r Sonderaktionen''" (bathing installations for special actions).<ref name=thhpbisa>{{cite web|title=Bathing Installations for Special Actions|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/19420821-badeanstalten/|publisher=The Holocaust History Project|accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> In the letter, this is given in quotes, further suggesting the euphemistic nature of what is meant. On blueprints, the basement gas chambers of Crematoria II and III were simply marked as "''Leichenkeller 1''" (basement morgue 1), and the basement undressing rooms were marked as "''Leichenkeller 2''". However, a letter dated November 27, 1942 to chief Auschwitz architect SS-''[[Sturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Karl Bischoff]] referred to morgue 1 of Crematorium II as the "''Sonderkeller''" (special cellar).<ref name=anatomy223>[[Jean-Claude Pressac|Pressac, Jean-Claude]]; [[Robert Jan van Pelt|van Pelt, Robert-Jan]]. "The Machinery of Mass Murder at Auschwitz" in ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', p. 223</ref> A letter from SS-''Sturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer'' Rudolf J<U+00E4>hrling concerning Crematoria II and III to oven builders [[Topf and Sons|J.A. Topf and Sons]] dated March 6, 1943, refers to morgue 2 as an "''Auskleideraum''" (undressing room).<ref name=pressac221>Pressac (1989), p. 221</ref> The units of prisoners forced to empty gas chambers and load bodies into ovens were known as the ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' (special squads). A document dated August 26, 1942 granted the camp authorities to send a truck "...to Dessau to pick up material for special treatment..." - Dessau was one of two places where [[Zyklon B]] was manufactured.<ref name=thhpsonder>{{cite web|title=Material for Special Treatment|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/19420826-dessau/|publisher=The Holocaust History Project|accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> Standard usage of the term for killing at Auschwitz applied. A letter dated October 13, 1942, signed by Bischoff, states that construction of new crematoria facilities "...was necessary to start immediately in July 1942 because of the situation caused by the special actions."<ref name=pressac198>Pressac (1989), p. 198</ref> On September 8, 1943, 5,006 Jews were transferred from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz under the designation "SB six months."<ref name=langbein47>Langbein (2004), p. 47</ref> Six months later on March 9, 1944, those still alive were gassed.<ref name=langbein47/>

In his diary, SS-''[[Obersturmf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' and doctor [[Johann Kremer]] describes seeing a mass gassing for the first time:
:September 2, 1942: ''For the first time, at 3:00 A.M. outside, attended a special action. [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's Inferno]] seems to me almost a comedy compared to this. They don't call Auschwitz the camp of annihilation for nothing!''<ref name=thhpkremer>{{cite web|title=Diary of Johann Paul Kremer|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/19420901-kremer/|publisher=The Holocaust History Project|accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref>

Three days later, Kremer described the mass gassing of emaciated prisoners, nicknamed ''Muslims'':
:September 5, 1942: ''In the morning attended a special action from the women's concentration camp (Muslims); the most dreadful of horrors. Master-Sergeant Thilo (troop doctor) was right when he said to me that this is the anus mundi. In the evening towards 8:00 attended another special action from Holland [sic]. Because of the special rations they get a fifth of a liter of schnapps, 5 cigarettes, 100 g salami and bread, the men all clamor to take part in such actions. Today and tomorrow (Sunday) work.''<ref name=thhpkremer/>

In a letter dated January 29, 1943 by SS-''Sturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer'' Bischoff to SS-''[[Oberf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Hans Kammler]], Bischoff refers to basement morgue 1 of Crematorium II at Auschwitz as a "''Vergasungskeller''", literally "gassing cellar".<ref name=thhpgc>{{cite web|title=Vergasungskeller|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/19430129-vergasungskeller/|publisher=The Holocaust History Project|accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref>  In the letter, the word is underlined, and at the top of the document is written: "''SS-[[Untersturmf<U+00FC>hrer]] Kirschnek!''"<ref name=transcript>{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Errol|title=Mr. Death: Transcript|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html|accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> There was a very clear policy in the architecture office that words such as "gas chamber" should not be used; Second Lieutenant Kirschnek should be informed of this slip.<ref name=transcript/> Citing this unique letter, [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] states that in using "special action" or "special treatment" in place of extermination and killing, the first [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] were the Nazis themselves, in that they attempted to deny to themselves what they were doing.<ref name=transcript/>

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-029, KZ Mauthausen, Himmler, Kaltenbrunner, Ziereis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kaltenbrunner with Himmler and Ziereis]]
Heinrich Himmler became increasingly concerned about the security of documenting the destruction of the Jews.<ref name=shermer223>Shermer ''et al'' (2009), p. 223</ref> On April 9, 1943, he wrote a secret letter to Heydrich's successor as chief of the Gestapo and SD, SS-''[[Obergruppenf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], concerning the [[Korherr Report]].<ref name=shermer223/> Himmler considered the report "well executed for purposes of camouflage and potentially useful for later times."<ref name=shermer223/>

The next day, SS-''[[Obersturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Rudolf Brandt]] passed a message to the author of the report, Richard Korherr, stating:

:''The Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer-SS has received your report on "The Final Solution of the European Jewish Question". He wishes that "special treatment of the Jews" not be mentioned anywhere. On page 9, it must be formulated as follows:''

:''"They were guided:''
:''through the camps in the [[General Government]]''
:''through the camps in the [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Warthegau]]"''

:''No other formulation is to be employed.''<ref name=thhpsb/>

Himmler was so sure that almost everyone knew what "special treatment" meant, and ordered for it to be replaced with the even more vague "''durchgeschleust''" (guided through), even though the document in question was top secret.<ref name=thhpsb/> The camps in question in the General Government were [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]] and [[Be<U+0142><U+017C>ec extermination camp|Belzec]] extermination camps, and [[Majdanek concentration camp]]. The only camp in the Warthegau was [[Che<U+0142>mno extermination camp]].

In the course of investigations and criminal proceedings for [[Nazi crime|Nazi war crimes]], it was shown that among those involved, there was no doubt what was meant by this term. At his trial, SS-''Obersturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer'' [[Adolf Eichmann]] stated that "everybody knew" special treatment meant killing.<ref name=nca>Office of Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality, OCCPAC: ''Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression'', Volume I, p. 1001</ref>

According to SS-''[[Gruppenf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' and senior [[SS and Police Leader|SS and Polizeif<U+00FC>hrer]] [[Emil Mazuw]]:

:"During the war, the SS gave no meaning to Sonderbehandlung other than killing. I am certain that high-ranking officers knew it. I don't know whether the ordinary SS man did or not. According to the terminology used at the time, I understand 'special treatment' to mean only killing and nothing else."<ref name=kogon6/>
