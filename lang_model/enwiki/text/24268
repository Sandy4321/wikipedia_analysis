The '''Milky Way''', when observed from [[Earth]]'s surface, is the hazy band of [[white]] [[light]] that is seen in the [[night sky]], arching across the entire [[celestial sphere]]. It is comprised of [[star]]s and other material lying within the [[Galactic coordinate system|galactic plane]] of our galaxy, '''The Milky Way Galaxy'''. 

==The Milky Way==
[[Image:Deathvalleysky nps big.jpg|thumb|center|500px|The Milky Way as seen in a very wide angle image showing the whole horizon taken from a very [[light pollution|dark sky]] location ([[Death Valley]]).]]
The Milky Way appears brightest in the direction of the [[constellation]] of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], towards the [[galactic center]]. Relative to the [[celestial equator]], the Milky Way passes as far north as the constellation of [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] and as far south as the constellation of [[Crux]], indicating the high inclination of Earth's [[equator|equatorial plane]] and the plane of the [[ecliptic]] relative to the galactic plane. The fact that the Milky Way divides the night sky into two roughly equal [[Sphere|hemispheres]] indicates that the Solar System lies close to the galactic plane.  Although the Milky Way has an [[absolute magnitude]] of &minus;20.9,<ref name="forbes00"/> it has a relatively low [[apparent magnitude]], making it difficult to see from any urban or suburban location suffering from [[light pollution]].

===Name and myths===

{{main|List of names for the Milky Way|Milky Way (mythology)}}
There are many [[creation myth]]s around the world which explain the origin of the Milky Way and give it its name. The English phrase is a translation from Greek <U+0393><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03BE><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03C2> ''Galaxias'' which is derived from the word for milk (<U+03B3><U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03B1>, ''gala''). This is also the origin of the word [[galaxy]]. In Greek myth the Milky Way was caused by milk spilt by [[Hera]] when suckled by [[Heracles]]. 

The term ''Milky Way'' first appeared in the English literature in a poem by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]].
{{Quote|"See yonder, lo, the Galaxy<U+00EB><br />&nbsp;Which men clepeth the Milky Wey,<br />&nbsp;For hit is whyt."|Geoffrey Chaucer|Geoffrey Chaucer ''[[The House of Fame]]'', ''c.'' 1380.<ref>{{cite web

In a large area from [[Central Asia]] to [[Africa]], the name for the Milky Way is related to the word for straw. It has been claimed that this was spread by [[Arab]]s who in turned borrowed the word from Armenian.<ref>{{cite journal

The Chinese name "Silver River" (<U+9280><U+6CB3>) is used throughout [[East Asia]], including Korea. In Japan, "Silver River" (<U+9280><U+6CB3>) means galaxies in general and the Milky Way is called the "River of Heaven" (<U+5929><U+306E><U+5DDD>).

===Discovery of "our Galaxy"===

The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Democritus]] (450 BC<U+2013>370 BC) was the first known person to propose that the Milky Way might consist of distant stars. Actual proof of this came in 1610 when [[Galileo Galilei]] used a [[Optical telescope|telescope]] to study the Milky Way and discovered that it was composed of a huge number of faint stars.<ref>{{cite web | author=J. J. O'Connor, E. F. Robertson |date = November 2002 | url = http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Galileo.html | title = Galileo Galilei | publisher = University of St Andrews | accessdate = 2007-01-08 }}</ref> In a treatise in 1755, [[Immanuel Kant]], drawing on earlier work by [[Thomas Wright (astronomer)|Thomas Wright]], speculated (correctly) that the Milky Way might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars, held together by [[gravitation|gravitational forces]] akin to the solar system but on much larger scales. The resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk. Kant also conjectured that some of the [[nebula]]e visible in the night sky might be separate "galaxies" themselves, similar to the Milky Way.<ref name="our_galaxy">{{cite web | last = Evans | first = J.

[[Image:Herschel-Galaxy.png|thumb|200px|right|The shape of the Milky Way Galaxy as deduced from star counts by William Herschel in 1785; the solar system was assumed near center.]]
The first attempt to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the [[Sun]] within it was carried out by [[William Herschel]] in 1785 by carefully counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the galaxy with the solar system close to the center. 

In 1845, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral-shaped nebulae. He also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture.<ref>{{cite web | last = Abbey | first = Lenny | url = http://labbey.com/Telescopes/Parsontown.html | title = The Earl of Rosse and the Leviathan of Parsontown | publisher = The Compleat Amateur Astronomer | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}</ref>

In 1917, [[Heber Curtis]] had observed the nova [[S Andromedae]] within the "Great [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] Nebula" ([[Messier object]] [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]]}. Searching the photographic record, he found 11 more [[nova]]e. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] fainter than those that occurred within our galaxy. As a result he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000 parsecs. He became a proponent of the so-called "island universes" hypothesis, which held that the spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Heber D.

[[Image:Pic iroberts1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Photograph of the "Great Andromeda Nebula" from 1899, later identified as the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]]]
In 1920 the so-called [[The Great Debate|Great Debate]] took place between [[Harlow Shapley]] and Heber Curtis, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula was an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the Milky Way, as well as the significant [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]].<ref>{{cite web | first=Harold F. | last=Weaver | url = http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/rtrumpler.html | title = Robert Julius Trumpler | publisher = National Academy of Sciences | accessdate = 2007-01-05 }}</ref>

The matter was conclusively settled by [[Edwin Hubble]] in the early 1920s using a new telescope. He was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some [[Cepheid variable]]s, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too distant to be part of the Milky Way.<ref>{{cite journal | author=E.
