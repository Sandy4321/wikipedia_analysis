[[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] '''Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive''', [[Order of the Bath|KB]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (25 September 1725 <U+2013> 22 November 1774), also known as '''Clive of India''', was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] officer who established the military and political supremacy of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] in [[Bengal]]. He is credited with securing India, and the wealth that followed, for the British crown. Together with [[Warren Hastings]] he was one of the key early figures in the creation of [[British Raj|British India]].  He also sat as a [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] [[Member of Parliament]] in Great Britain.

==Early life==
Robert Clive was born at Styche, the Clive family estate, near [[Market Drayton]] in [[Shropshire]], on 25 September 1725 to Richard Clive and Rebecca Gaskell Clive.<ref>Arbuthnot, p. 1</ref> The family had held the small estate since the time of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. The family had a lengthy history of public service: members of the family included an Irish chancellor of the exchequer under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and a member of the [[Long Parliament]]. Robert's father, who supplemented the estate's modest income as a lawyer, also served in Parliament for many years, representing [[Montgomeryshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Montgomeryshire]].<ref name=EB>{{cite EB1911|title=Clive, Robert Clive, Baron|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cSkOAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA532#v=onepage&f=false}}</ref>  Robert was their eldest son of thirteen children; he had seven sisters and five brothers, six of whom died in infancy.<ref name=Harvey1998_11>Harvey (1998), p. 11</ref>

Clive's father was known to have a temper, which the boy apparently inherited. For reasons that have not been documented, Clive was sent to live with his mother's sister in [[Manchester]] while still a toddler.  Biographer Robert Harvey suggests that this move was made because Clive's father was busy in London trying to provide for the family.<ref>Harvey (1998), p. 10</ref>  Daniel Bayley, the sister's husband, reported that the boy was "out of measure addicted to fighting".<ref>Malleson, p. 9</ref><ref>Arbuthnot, p. 2</ref>  He was a regular troublemaker in the schools he was sent to (and may have been expelled from).<ref>Malleson, p. 10</ref>  When he was older he and a gang of teenagers established a [[protection racket]] that vandalised the shops of uncooperative merchants in Market Drayton. Clive also exhibited fearlessness at an early age. He is reputed to have climbed the tower of St. Mary's Parish Church in Market Drayton and perched on a [[gargoyle]], frightening those down below.<ref name=Treasure196>Treasure, p. 196</ref>

[[Image:DraytonStMarys.JPG|thumb|left|St. Mary's in [[Market Drayton]], whose tower Clive is reputed to have climbed]]

When Clive was nine his aunt died, and, after a brief stint in his father's cramped London quarters, he returned to Shropshire.  There he attended the Market Drayton Grammar School, where his unruly behavior (and improvement in the family's fortunes) prompted his father to send him to [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] in London.  His bad behavior continued, and he was then sent to a trade school in [[Hertfordshire]] to complete a basic education.<ref name=Harvey1998_11/>  Despite his early lack of scholarship, in his later years he devoted himself to improving his education. He eventually developed a distinctive writing style, and a speech in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] was described by [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] as the most eloquent he had ever heard.<ref name=EB/>

In 1744 Clive's father acquired for him a position as a "factor" or "writer" in the service of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], and Clive set sail for India.  After running aground on the coast of [[Brazil]], his ship was detained for nine months while repairs were completed. This enabled him to learn some [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]],<ref>Harvey (1998), pp. 18<U+2013>21</ref> a language then in common use in India.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} At this time the East India Company had a small settlement at [[Fort St. George]] near the village of Madraspatnam, now the major Indian metropolis of [[Chennai]],<ref>Harvey (1998), pp. 23<U+2013>24</ref> in addition to others at [[Calcutta]], [[Bombay]], and [[Cuddalore]].<ref name="Harvey 1998, p. 30">Harvey (1998), p. 30</ref>  Clive arrived at Fort St. George in June 1744, and spent the next two years working as little more than a glorified assistant shopkeeper, tallying books and arguing with suppliers of the East India Company over the quality and quantity of their wares.  He was given access to the governor's library, where he became a prolific reader.<ref>Harvey (1998), pp. 24<U+2013>29</ref>

===Political situation in south India===
The India Clive arrived in was divided into a number of successor states to the [[Mughal Empire]]. Over the forty years since the death of the [[Aurangzeb|Emperor Aurangzeb]] in 1707, the power of the emperor had gradually fallen into the hands of his provincial viceroys or ''[[Subahdar|soobedars]]''.  The dominant rulers on the [[Coromandel Coast]] were the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asaf Jah I|Asaf Jah I]], and the [[Nawab of the Carnatic]], [[Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan]].  The nawab nominally owed fealty to the nizam, but in many respects acted independently.  Fort St. George and the French trading post at [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] were both located in the nawab's territory.<ref>Malleson, pp. 16<U+2013>32</ref>

The relationship between the Europeans in India was influenced by a series of wars and treaties on mainland Europe, and by competing commercial rivalry for trade on the subcontinent.  Through the 17th and early 18th centuries, the French, Dutch, Portuguese, and English had vied for control of various trading posts, and for trading rights and favour with local Indian rulers.  The European merchant companies raised bodies of troops to protect their commercial interests and latterly to influence local politics to their advantage. Military power was rapidly becoming as important as commercial acumen in securing India's valuable trade, and increasingly it was used to appropriate territory and to collect land revenue.<ref>Harvey (1998), pp. 29<U+2013>30</ref>

===First Carnatic War===
[[File:LordClive.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Portrait by [[Charles Clive]], c. 1764]]
{{further|Carnatic Wars|War of the Austrian Succession}}
In 1720 France effectively nationalized the [[French East India Company]], and began using it to expand its imperial interests.  This became a source of conflict with the British in India with the entry of Britain into the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] in 1744.<ref name="Harvey 1998, p. 30"/>  The Indian theatre of the conflict is also known as the [[First Carnatic War]].  Hostilities in India began with a British naval attack on a French fleet in 1745, which led the French Governor-General [[Joseph Fran<U+00E7>ois Dupleix|Dupleix]] to request additional forces.<ref>Harvey (1998), p. 31</ref>  On 4 September 1746, Madras [[Battle of Madras|was attacked by French forces]] led by [[Bertrand-Fran<U+00E7>ois Mah<U+00E9> de La Bourdonnais|La Bourdonnais]]. After several days of bombardment the British surrendered and the French entered the city.<ref>Malleson, p. 35</ref>  The British leadership was taken prisoner and sent to Pondicherry.  It was originally agreed that the town would be restored to the British after negotiation but this was opposed by Dupleix, who sought to annex Madras to French holdings.<ref>Harvey (1998), pp. 31<U+2013>34</ref> The remaining British residents were asked to take an oath promising not to take up arms against the French; Clive and a handful of others refused, and were kept under weak guard as the French prepared to destroy the fort.  Disguising themselves as natives, Clive and three others eluded their inattentive sentry, slipped out of the fort, and made their way to Fort St. David (the British post at Cuddalore), some {{convert|50|mi|km}} to the south.<ref>Malleson, p. 38</ref><ref>Harvey (1998), pp. 35<U+2013>36</ref>  Upon his arrival, Clive decided to enlist in the Company army rather than remain idle; in the hierarchy of the Company, this was seen as a step down.<ref>Harvey (1998), p. 39</ref>  Clive was, however recognized for his contribution in the defence of Fort St. David, where the French assault on 11 March 1747 was repulsed with the assistance of the Nawab of the Carnatic, and was given a commission as [[ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref name=H41>Harvey (1998), p. 41</ref>

In the conflict, Clive's bravery came to the attention of Major [[Stringer Lawrence]], who arrived in 1748 to take command of the British troops at Fort St. David.<ref name=H41>Harvey (1998), p. 41</ref>  During the 1748 [[Siege of Pondicherry (1748)|Siege of Pondicherry]] Clive distinguished himself in successfully defending a trench against a French sortie: one witness of the action wrote "[Clive's] platoon, animated by his exhortation, fired again with new courage and great vivacity upon the enemy."<ref>Harvey (1998), p. 42</ref>  The siege was lifted in October 1748 with the arrival of the [[monsoon]]s, but the war came to a conclusion with the arrival in December of news of the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle]].  Madras was returned to the British as part of the peace agreement in early 1749.<ref>Malleson, pp. 40<U+2013>41</ref>

===Tanjore expedition===
The end of war between France and Britain did not, however, end hostilities in India.  Even before news of the peace arrived in India, the British had sent an expedition to [[Tanjore]] on behalf of a claimant to its throne.  This expedition, on which Clive, now promoted to lieutenant, served as a volunteer, was a disastrous failure.  Monsoons ravaged the land forces, and the local support claimed by their client was not in evidence.  The ignominious retreat of the British force (which lost its baggage train to the pursuing Tanjorean army while crossing a swollen river) was a blow to the British reputation.<ref>Harvey (1998), p. 46</ref>  Major Lawrence, seeking to recover the British reputation, led the entire Madras garrison to Tanjore in response.  At the fort of [[Devikottai]] on the [[Coleroon River]] the British force was confronted by the much larger Tanjorean army.  Lawrence gave Clive command of 30 British soldiers and 700 [[sepoy]]s, with orders to lead the assault on the fort.  Clive led this force rapidly across the river and toward the fort, where the small British unit became separated from the sepoys and were enveloped by the Tanjorean cavalry.  Clive was nearly cut down and the beachhead almost lost before reinforcements sent by Lawrence arrived to save the day.  The daring move by Clive had an important consequence: the Tanjoreans abandoned the fort, which the British triumphantly occupied.  The success prompted the Tanjorean rajah to open peace talks, which resulted in the British being awarded Devikottai and the costs of their expedition, and the British client was awarded a pension in exchange for renouncing his claim.  Lawrence wrote of Clive's action that "he behaved in courage and in judgment much beyond what could be expected from his years."<ref>Harvey (1998), pp. 46<U+2013>47</ref>

On the expedition's return the process of restoring Madras was completed.  Company officials, concerned about the cost of the military, slashed its size, denying Clive a promotion to captain in the process.  Lawrence procured for Clive a position as the commissary at Fort St. George, a potentially lucrative posting (its pay included commissions on all supply contracts).<ref>Harvey (1998), pp. 47<U+2013>48</ref>

===Second Carnatic War===
{{further|Second Carnatic War}}
The death of the [[Asaf Jah I]], the Nizam of Hyderabad, in 1748 sparked a struggle to succeed him that is known as the [[Second Carnatic War]], which was also furthered by the expansionist interests of French Governor-General Dupleix.  Dupleix had grasped from the first war that small numbers of disciplined European forces (and well-trained [[sepoy]]s) could be used to tip balances of power between competing interests, and used this idea to greatly expand French influence in southern India.  For many years he had been working to negotiate the release of [[Chanda Sahib]], a longtime French ally who had at one time occupied the throne of Tanjore, and sought for himself the throne of the Carnatic.  Chanda Sahib had been imprisoned by the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] in 1740; by 1748 he had been released from custody and was building an army at [[Satara (city)|Satara]].

Upon the death of Asaf Jah I, his son, [[Nasir Jung]], seized the throne of Hyderabad, although Asaf Jah had designated as his successor his grandson, [[Muzaffar Jung]].  The grandson, who was ruler of [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur]], fled west to join Chanda Sahib, whose army was also reinforced by French troops sent by Dupleix.  These forces met those of Anwaruddin Mohammed Khan in the [[Battle of Ambur]] in August 1749; Anwaruddin was slain, and Chanda Sahib victorious entered the Carnatic capital, [[Arcot]].  Anwaruddin's son, [[Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah]], fled to Trichinopoly where he sought the protection and assistance of the British.  In thanks for French assistance, the victors awarded them a number of villages, including territory nominally under British sway near Cuddalore and Madras.  The British began sending additional arms to Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah and sought to bring Nasir Jung into the fray to oppose Chanda Sahib.  Nasir Jung came south to [[Gingee]] in 1750, where he requested and received a detachment of British troops.  Chanda Sahib's forces advanced to meet them, but retreated after a brief long-range cannonade.  Nasir Jung pursued, and was able to capture Arcot and his nephew, Muzaffar Jung.  Following a series of fruitless negotiations and intrigues, Nasir Jung was assassinated by a rebellious soldier.  This made Muzaffar Jung nizam and confirmed Chanda Sahib as Nawab of the Carnatic, both with French support.  Dupleix was rewarded for French assistance with titled nobility and rule of the nizam's territories south of the [[Kistna River]].  His territories were "said to yield an annual revenue of over 350,000 rupees".<ref>Keay, John, ''The Honourable Company<U+2014>A History of the English East India Company'', [[HarperCollins]], London, 1991, ISBN 0-00-217515-0 p. 289.</ref>

Robert Clive was not in southern India for many of these events.  In 1750 Clive was afflicted with some sort of nervous disorder, and was sent north to Bengal to recuperate.<ref name=DNB110/>  It was there that he met and befriended [[Robert Orme]], who became his principal chronicler and biographer.  He returned to Madras in 1751.

===Siege of Arcot===
{{Main|Siege of Arcot}}
In the summer of 1751, Chanda Sahib left Arcot to [[Siege of Trichinopoly (1751-1752)|besiege]] Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah at [[Tiruchirapalli|Trichinopoly]].  This placed the British at Madras in a precarious position, since the latter was the last of their major allies in the area.  The British company's military was also in some disarray, as Stringer Lawrence had returned to England in 1750 over a pay dispute, and much of the company was apathetic about the dangers the expanding French influence and declining British influence posed.  The weakness of the British military command was exposed when a force was sent from Madras to support Muhammed Ali at Trichinopoly, but its commander, a Swiss mercenary, refused to attack an outpost at Valikondapuram.  Clive, who accompanied the force as commissary, was outraged at the decision to abandon the siege.  He rode to Cuddalore, and offered his services to lead an attack on Arcot if he was given a captain's commission, arguing this would force Chanda Sahib to either abandon the siege of Trichinopoly or significantly reduce the force there.

Madras and Fort St David could supply him with only 200 Europeans, 300 [[sepoy]]s, and three small cannons; furthermore, of the eight officers who led them, four were civilians like Clive, and six had never been in action.  Clive, hoping to surprise the small garrison at Arcot, made a series of forced marches, including some under extremely rainy conditions.  Although he did fail to achieve surprise, the garrison, hearing of the march being made under such arduous conditions, opted to abandon the fort and town; Clive occupied Arcot without firing a shot.

The fort was a rambling structure with a dilapidated wall a mile long (too long for his small force to effectively man), and it was surrounded by the densely packed housing of the town.  Its moat was shallow or dry, and some of its towers were insufficiently strong to use as artillery mounts.  Clive did the best he could to prepare for the onslaught he expected.  He made a foray against the fort's former garrison, encamped a few miles away, which had no significant effect.  When the garrison was reinforced by 2,000 men Chanda Sahib sent from Trichinopoly it reoccupied the town on 15 September.  That night Clive led most of his force out of the fort and launched a surprise attack on the besiegers.  Because of the darkness, the besiegers had no idea how large Clive's force was, and it fled in panic.

The next day Clive learned that heavy guns he had requested from Madras were approaching, so he sent most of his garrison out to escort them into the fort.  That night the besiegers, who had spotted the movement, launched an attack on the fort.  With only 70 men in the fort, Clive once again was able to disguise his small numbers, and sowed sufficient confusion against his enemies that multiple assaults against the fort were successfully repulsed.  That morning the guns arrived, and Chanda Sahib's men again retreated.

Over the next week Clive and his men worked feverishly to improve the defences, aware that another 4,000 men, led by Chanda Sahib's son Raza Sahib and accompanied by a small contingent of French troops, was on its way.  (Most of these troops came from Pondicherry, not Trichinopoly, and thus did not have the effect Clive desired of raising that siege.)  Clive was forced to reduce his garrison to about 300 men, sending the rest of his force to Madras in case the enemy army decided to go there instead.  Raza Sahib arrived at Arcot, and on 23 September occupied the town.  That night Clive launched a daring attack against the French artillery, seeking to capture their guns.  The attack very nearly succeeded in its object, but was reversed when enemy sniper fire tore into the small British force.  Clive himself was targeted on more than one occasion; one man pulled him down and was shot dead.  The affair was a serious blow: 15 of Clive's men were killed, and another 15 wounded. 

Over the next month the besiegers slowly tightened their grips on the fort.  Clive's men were subjected to frequent sniper attacks and disease, lowering the garrison size to 200.  He was heartened to learn that some 6,000 [[Maratha]] forces had been convinced to come to his relief, but that they were awaiting payment before proceeding.  The approach of this force prompted Raza Sahib to demand Clive's surrender; Clive's response was an immediate rejection, and he further insulted Raza Sahib by suggesting that he should reconsider sending his rabble of troops against a British-held position.  The siege finally reached critical when Raza Sahib launched an all-out assault against the fort on 14 November.  Clive's small force maintained its composure, and established killing fields outside the walls of the fort where the attackers sought to gain entry.  Several hundred attackers were killed and many more wounded, while Clive's small force suffered only four British and two sepoy casualties.

The historian [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] wrote a century later of the siege:
<blockquote>"...&nbsp;the commander who had to conduct the defence...was a young man of five and twenty, who had been bred as a book-keeper... Clive...had made his arrangements, and, exhausted by fatigue, had thrown himself on his bed. He was awakened by the alarm, and was instantly at his post.... After three desperate onsets, the besiegers retired behind the ditch. The struggle lasted about an hour...the garrison lost only five or six men." <ref>Thomas Babington Macaulay, "Lord Clive," ''Essays'' (London), 1891, pp.511<U+2013>13 (First published in the ''Edinburgh Review'', January 1840).</ref></blockquote>

His conduct during the siege made Clive famous in Europe. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] described Clive, who had received no formal military training whatsoever, as the "heaven-born general", endorsing the generous appreciation of his early commander, Major Lawrence. The Court of Directors of the East India Company voted him a sword worth <U+00A3>700, which he refused to receive unless Lawrence was similarly honoured.

Clive and Major Lawrence were able to bring the campaign to a successful conclusion. In 1754, the first of the provisional Carnatic treaties was signed between Thomas Saunders, the Company president at Madras, and [[Charles Godeheu]], the French commander who displaced Dupleix. Mohammed Ali Khan Walajah was recognized as Nawab, and both nations agreed to equalize their possessions. When war again broke out in 1756, during Clive's absence in Bengal, the French obtained successes in the [[Northern Circars|northern districts]], and it was Mohammed Ali Khan Walajah's efforts which drove them from their settlements. The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] formally confirmed Mohammed Ali Khan Walajah as Nawab of the Carnatic. It was a result of this action and the increased British influence that in 1765 a ''[[firman (decree)|firman]]'' (decree) came from the Emperor of Delhi, recognizing the British possessions in southern India.

He left Madras for home, after ten years' absence, early in 1753, but not before marrying Margaret Maskelyne, the sister of his friend [[Nevil Maskelyne]] who was afterwards well known as [[Astronomer Royal]].

Clive also briefly sat as [[Member of Parliament]] for the [[Cornwall]] [[rotten borough]] of [[Mitchell (UK Parliament constituency)|St Michael's]], which then returned two Members, from 1754 to 1755.<ref name=compeerage>{{cite book|last=Gibbs|first=Vicary (Editor)|title=The Complete Peerage, Volume III|year=1912|publisher=St Catherine's Press|page=325}}</ref>  He and his colleague, [[John Stephenson (MP)|John Stephenson]] were later unseated by petition of their defeated opponents, [[Richard Hussey]] and [[Simon Luttrell, 1st Earl of Carhampton|Simon Luttrell]].

==Second journey to India (1755<U+2013>1760)==
{{Further2|[[Great Britain in the Seven Years War]]}}
In July 1755, Clive returned to India<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dodingtonfamily.org/shipdodingtonnotes.htm |title=Sailing Ship "Dodington" (history) |publisher=Dodington Family |accessdate=10 July 2008}}</ref> to act as deputy governor of Fort St. David at Cuddalore. He arrived after having lost a considerable fortune en route, as the ''[[Doddington (ship)|Doddington]]'', the lead ship of his convoy, was wrecked near [[Port Elizabeth]], losing a chest of gold coins belonging to Clive worth <U+00A3>33,000. Nearly 250 years later in 1998, illegally salvaged coins from Clive's treasure chest were offered for sale,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1997/10/09/wsaf09.html |title= South Africa seeks its share of Clive's treasure trove |accessdate=23 November 2008 |last= Russell |first= Alec |coauthors= |date= 9 October 1997 |work= [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |publisher=}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and in 2002 a portion of the coins were given to the [[South Africa]]n government after protracted legal wrangling.

Clive, now promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the British Army, took part in the capture of the fortress of [[Vijayadurg fort|Gheriah]], a stronghold of the Maratha [[Admiral]] [[Tuloji Angre]]. The action was led by [[Admiral James Watson]] and the English had several ships available, some Royal troops and some [[Maratha]] allies. The overwhelming strength of the joint British and Maratha forces ensured that the battle was won with few losses. A fleet surgeon, Edward Ives, noted that Clive refused to take any part of the treasure divided among the victorious forces as was custom at the time.<ref>Keay, John, ''The Honourable Company<U+2014>A History of the English East India Company'', [[HarperCollins]], London, 1991, ISBN 0-00-217515-0 p. 269.</ref>

===The fall and recapture of Calcutta (1756<U+2013>57)===
Following this action Clive headed to his post at Fort St. David and it was there he received news of twin disasters for the English. Early in 1756, [[Siraj Ud Daulah]] had succeeded his grandfather [[Alivardi Khan]] as Nawab of Bengal. In June Clive received news that the new Nawab had attacked the English at [[Cossimbazar|Kasimbazar]] and shortly afterwards on 20 June he had taken the fort at [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. The losses to the Company because of the fall of Calcutta were estimated by investors at <U+00A3>2,000,000. Those British who were captured were placed in a punishment cell which became infamous as the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]]. In stifling summer heat, it was alleged that 123 of the 146 prisoners died as a result of suffocation or heat stroke. While the Black Hole became infamous in Britain, it is debatable whether the Nawab was aware of the incident.<ref>H.E. Busteed, ''Echoes from Old Calcutta'' (Calcutta), 1908, pp.30<U+2013>56.</ref>

By Christmas 1756, as no response had been received to diplomatic letters to the Nawab, [[Admiral Charles Watson]] and Clive were dispatched to attack the Nawab's army and remove him from Calcutta by force. Their first target was the fortress of Baj-Baj which Clive approached by land while Admiral Watson bombarded it from the sea. The fortress was quickly taken with minimal British casualties. Shortly afterwards, on 2 January 1757, Calcutta itself was taken with similar ease.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir William Wilson Hunter |title=The Indian Empire: Its Peoples, History, and Products |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gHeBAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA381 |accessdate=11 July 2012 |year=1886 |publisher=Tr<U+00FC>bner & Company |pages=381<U+2013>}}</ref>

Approximately a month later, on 3 February 1757, Clive encountered the army of the Nawab itself. For two days, the army marched past Clive's camp to take up a position east of Calcutta. Sir Eyre Coote, serving in the British forces, estimated the enemy's strength as 40,000 cavalry, 60,000 infantry and thirty cannons. Even allowing for overestimation this was considerably more than Clive's force of approximately 540 British infantry, 600 Royal Navy sailors, 800 sepoys, fourteen field guns and no cavalry. The British forces attacked the Nawab's camp during the early morning hours of 5 February 1757. In this battle, unofficially called the 'Calcutta Gauntlet', Clive marched his small force through the entire Nawab's camp, despite being under heavy fire from all sides. By noon, Clive's force broke through the besieging camp and arrived safely at Fort William. During the assault, around one tenth of the British attackers became casualties. Clive reported 57 killed and 137 wounded. While technically not a victory in military terms, the sudden British assault intimidated the Nawab. He sought to make terms with Clive, and surrendered control of Calcutta on 9 February, promising to compensate the East India Company for damages suffered and to restore its privileges.

===War with Siraj Ud Daulah===
As Britain and France were [[Seven Years' War|once more at war]], Clive sent the fleet up the river against the French colony of [[Chandannagar]], while he besieged it by land. There was a strong incentive to capture the colony, as capture of a previous French settlement near [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] had yielded the combined forces prizes valued at <U+00A3>140,000. After consenting to the siege, the Nawab unsuccessfully sought to assist the French. Some officials of the Nawab's court formed a confederacy to depose him. [[Jafar Ali Khan]], also known as [[Mir Jafar]], the Nawab's commander-in-chief, led the conspirators. With Admiral Watson, Governor Drake and Mr. Watts, Clive made a [[gentlemen's agreement]] in which it was agreed to give the office of viceroy of Bengal, [[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]] to Mir Jafar, who was to pay a million sterling to the Company for its losses in Calcutta and the cost of its troops, half a million to the British inhabitants of Calcutta, <U+00A3>200,000 to the native inhabitants, and <U+00A3>70,000 to its Armenian merchants.

Clive employed Umichand, a rich Bengali trader, as an agent between Mir Jafar and the British officials. Umichand threatened to betray Clive unless he was guaranteed, in the agreement itself, <U+00A3>300,000. To dupe him a second fictitious agreement was shown to him with a clause to this effect. Admiral Watson refused to sign it. Clive deposed later to the House of Commons that, "to the best of his remembrance, he gave the gentleman who carried it leave to sign his name upon it; his lordship never made any secret of it; he thinks it warrantable in such a case, and would do it again a hundred times; he had no interested motive in doing it, and did it with a design of disappointing the expectations of a rapacious man." It is nevertheless cited as an example of Clive's unscrupulousness.

===Plassey===
{{main|Battle of Plassey}}
[[File:Clive.jpg|thumb|200px|Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive of Plassey, meeting with [[Mir Jafar]] after battle of Plassey, by Francis Hayman.]]
The whole hot season of 1757 was spent in negotiations with the Nawab of Bengal. In the middle of June Clive began his march from Chandannagar, with the British in boats and the sepoys along the right bank of the [[Hooghly River]]. During the rainy season, the Hooghly is fed by the overflow of the Ganges to the north through three streams, which in the hot months are nearly dry. On the left bank of the Bhagirathi, the most westerly of these, {{convert|100|mi|km}} above Chandernagore, stands Murshidabad, the capital of the Mughal viceroys of Bengal. Some miles farther down is the field of Plassey, then an extensive grove of mango trees. On 21 June 1757, Clive arrived on the bank opposite Plassey, in the midst of the first outburst of monsoonal rain. His whole army amounted to 1,100 Europeans and 2,100 sepoy troops, with nine field-pieces. The Nawab had drawn up 18,000 horse, 50,000-foot and 53 pieces of heavy ordnance, served by French artillerymen. For once in his career Clive hesitated, and called a council of sixteen officers to decide, as he put it, "whether in our present situation, without assistance, and on our own bottom, it would be prudent to attack the Nawab, or whether we should wait till joined by some country (Indian) power." Clive himself headed the nine who voted for delay; Major [[Sir Eyre Coote, KB|Eyre Coote]] led the seven who counselled immediate attack. But, either because his daring asserted itself, or because of a letter received from Mir Jafar, Clive was the first to change his mind and to communicate with Major Eyre Coote. One tradition, followed by Macaulay, represents him as spending an hour in thought under the shade of some trees, while he resolved the issues of what was to prove one of the decisive battles of the world. Another, turned into verse by Sir [[Alfred Comyn Lyall|Alfred Lyall]], pictures his resolution as the result of a dream. However, that may be, he did well as a soldier to trust to the dash and even rashness that had gained Arcot and triumphed at Calcutta since retreat, or even delay, might have resulted in defeat. After heavy rain, Clive's 3,200 men and the nine guns crossed the river and took possession of the grove and its tanks of water, while Clive established his headquarters in a hunting lodge. On 23 June, the engagement took place and lasted the whole day, during which remarkably little actual fighting took place. Gunpowder for the cannons of the Nawab were not well protected from rain. That impaired those cannons. Except the 40 Frenchmen and the guns which they worked, the Indian side could do little to reply to the British cannonade (after a spell of rain) which, with the 39th Regiment, scattered the host, inflicting on it a loss of 500 men. Clive had already made a secret agreement with aristocrats in Bengal, including  [[Jagat Seth]] and [[Mir Jafar]]. Clive restrained Major Kilpatrick, for he trusted to Mir Jafar's abstinence, if not desertion to his ranks, and knew the importance of sparing his own small force. He was fully justified in his confidence in Mir Jafar's treachery to his master, for he led a large portion of the Nawab's army away from the battlefield, ensuring his defeat. Clive lost hardly any European troops; in all 22 sepoys were killed and 50 wounded. It is curious in many ways that Clive is now best-remembered for this battle, which was essentially won by suborning the opposition rather than through fighting or brilliant military tactics. Whilst it established British military supremacy in Bengal, it did not secure the East India Company's control over Upper India, as is sometimes claimed. That would come only seven years later in 1764 at the [[Battle of Buxar]], where Sir [[Hector Munro, 8th of Novar|Hector Munro]] defeated the combined forces of the Mughal Emperor and the [[Nawab of Awadh]] in a much more closely fought encounter.

[[Siraj Ud Daulah]] fled from the field on a camel, securing what wealth he could. He was soon captured by Mir Jafar's forces, and later executed by the assassin Mohammadi Beg. Clive entered Murshidabad, and established Mir Jafar as Nawab, the price which had been agreed beforehand for his treachery. Clive was taken through the treasury, amid a million and a half sterling's worth of rupees, gold and silver plate, jewels and rich goods, and besought to ask what he would. Clive took <U+00A3>160,000, a vast fortune for the day, while half a million was distributed among the army and navy of the East India Company, and provided gifts of <U+00A3>24,000 to each member of the Company's committee, as well as the public compensation stipulated for in the treaty.

In this extraction of wealth Clive followed a usage fully recognized by the Company, although this was the source of future corruption which Clive was later sent to India again to correct. The Company itself acquired revenue of <U+00A3>100,000 a year, and a contribution towards its losses and military expenditure of a million and a half sterling. Mir Jafar further discharged his debt to Clive by afterwards presenting him with the quit-rent of the Company's lands in and around Calcutta, amounting to an annuity of <U+00A3>27,000 for life, and leaving him by will the sum of <U+00A3>70,000, which Clive devoted to the army.

===Further campaigns===

====Battle of Condore====
While busy with the civil administration, Clive continued to follow up his military success. He sent Major Coote in pursuit of the French almost as far as [[Benares]]. He dispatched Colonel Forde to [[Vizagapatam]] and the northern districts of Madras, where that officer won the [[Battle of Condore]], pronounced by Broome "one of the most brilliant actions on military record".

====Great Mughal====
{{main|Treaty of Allahabad}}

He came into direct contact, for the first time, with the Great Mughal himself, a meeting which would prove beneficial in his later career. [[Shah Alam II|Prince Ali Gauhar]], escaped from [[Delhi]] after his father, the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Alamgir II]] had been murdered by the usurping [[Vizier]] [[Ghazi ud-Din Khan Feroze Jung III|Imad-ul-Mulk]] and his [[Maratha]] associate [[Sadashivrao Bhau]].<ref>{{cite book|author=S.R.

In the year 1760 after gaining control over [[Bihar]], [[Odisha]] and some parts of the Bengal, the Mughal Crown Prince Ali Gauhar and his Mughal Army of 30,000 intended to overthrow Mir Jafar and the Company in order to reconquer the riches of the Eastern Subah's for the [[Mughal Empire]]. The Mughals were led by Prince Ali Gauhar and accompanied by Muhammad Quli Khan, Hidayat Ali, Mir Afzal, Kadim Husein and [[Ghulam Husain Tabatabai]]. Their forces were reinforced by the forces of Shuja-ud-Daula and [[Najib-ud-Daula]]. The Mughals were also joined by [[Jean Law de Lauriston|Jean Law]] and 200 Frenchmen and waged a campaign against the British during the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=L.S.S. O`malley |title=Bihar And Orissa District Gazetteers Patna |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=a-QaOP5nK-MC&pg=PA29 |accessdate=11 July 2012 |year=1924 |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |isbn=978-81-7268-121-0 |pages=29<U+2013>}}</ref> Prince Ali Gauhar successfully advanced as far as [[Patna, India|Patna]], which he later besieged with a combined army of over 40,000 in order to capture or kill Ramnarian a sworn enemy of the Mughals. Mir Jafar was fraught in terror at the near demise of his cohort and sent his own son Miran to relieve Ramnarian and retake Patna. Mir Jafar also implored the aid of Robert Clive, but it was Major [[John Caillaud]], who defeated Prince Ali Gauhar's army and dispersed it.

====Dutch aggression====
Clive also repelled the aggression of the Dutch, and avenged the massacre of [[Amboyna massacre|Amboyna]] <U+2013> the occasion when he wrote his famous letter; "Dear Forde, fight them immediately; I will send you the order of council to-morrow". Meanwhile Clive improved the organization and drill of the [[sepoy]] army, after a European model, and enlisted into it many Muslims from upper regions of the Mughal Empire. He re-fortified Calcutta. In 1760, after four years of hard labour, his health gave way and he returned to England. "It appeared", wrote a contemporary on the spot, "as if the soul was departing from the Government of Bengal". He had been formally made Governor of Bengal by the Court of Directors at a time when his nominal superiors in Madras sought to recall him to their help there. But he had discerned the importance of the province even during his first visit to its rich delta, mighty rivers and teeming population. Clive selected some able subordinates, notably a young [[Warren Hastings]], who, a year after Plassey, was made [[resident (title)|resident]] at the Nawab's court.

The long-term outcome of Plassey was to place a very heavy revenue burden upon Bengal. The Company sought to extract the maximum revenue possible from the peasantry to fund military campaigns, and corruption was widespread amongst its officials. Mir Jafar was compelled to engage in extortion on a vast scale in order to replenish his treasury, which had been emptied by the Company's demand for an indemnity of 2.8 ''[[crore]]s'' of rupees (<U+00A3>3 million).<ref name=marshall>P.J. Marshall, ''Bengal: The British Bridgehead'' (Cambridge), 1988, pp.78<U+2013>83,144.</ref>

===Return to Great Britain===
[[File:CliveofIndiaMemorialLondon.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial, King Charles St near [[St. James's Park|St James's Park]]]]
In 1760, the 35-year-old Clive returned to Great Britain with a fortune of at least <U+00A3>300,000 and the [[quit-rent]] of <U+00A3>27,000 a year. He financially supported his parents and sisters, while also providing Major Lawrence, the commanding officer who had early encouraged his military genius, with a [[stipend]] of <U+00A3>500 a year. In the five years of his conquests and administration in Bengal, the young man had crowded together a succession of exploits which led [[Lord Macaulay]], in what that historian termed his "flashy" essay on the subject, to compare him to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], declaring that "[Clive] gave peace, security, prosperity and such liberty as the case allowed of to millions of Indians, who had for centuries been the prey of oppression, while Napoleon's career of conquest was inspired only by personal ambition, and the absolutism he established vanished with his fall." Macaulay's ringing endorsement of Clive seems more controversial today, as some would argue that his{{clarify|reason=Macaulay's or Clive's?|date=October 2011}} own ambition and desire for personal gain set the tone for the administration of Bengal until the [[Permanent Settlement]] 30 years later. The immediate consequence of Clive's victory at Plassey was an increase in the revenue demand on Bengal by at least 20%, much of which was appropriated by ''[[Zamindar]]s'' and corrupt Company Officials, which led to considerable hardship for the rural population, particularly during the famine of 1770.<ref name=marshall/>

During the three years that Clive remained in Great Britain, he sought a political position, chiefly that he might influence the course of events in India, which he had left full of promise. He had been well received at court, had been made Baron Clive of [[Plassey, County Clare|Plassey]], [[County Clare]], had bought estates, and had a few friends as well as himself returned to the House of Commons.  (In the case of Clive, who continued to be allowed to sit in the Commons because his peerage was Irish, he was [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Shrewsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Shrewsbury]] from 1761 until his death.<ref name=Compeerage>{{cite book|last=Gibbs|first=Vicary (Editor)|title=The Complete Peerage, Volume III|year=1912|publisher=St Catherine's Press|page=326}}</ref>)  The non-graduate Clive received an honorary degree as [[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]] from [[Oxford University]] in 1760, and in 1764 he was named a [[Order of the Bath|Knight of the Bath]].<ref name=Compeerage />

Clive set himself to reform the home system of the East India Company, and began a bitter dispute with the chairman of the Court of Directors, Mr Sullivan, whom in the end, he defeated. In this he was aided by the news of reverses in Bengal. Mir Jafar had finally rebelled over payments to British officials, and Clive's successor had put Kasim Ali Khan, Mir Jafar's son-in-law upon the ''musnud'' (throne). After a brief tenure, Kasim Ali had fled, ordering [[Walter Reinhardt Sombre]] (known to the Muslims as Sumru), a Swiss mercenary of his, to butcher the garrison of 150 British at Patna, and had disappeared under the protection of his brother, the Viceroy of Awadh. The whole Company's service, civil and military, had become mired in corruption, demoralized by gifts and by the monopoly of the inland as well as export trade, to such an extent that the Indians were pauperised, and the Company was plundered of the revenues which Clive had acquired for them. For this Clive himself must bear much responsibility, as he had set a very poor example during his tenure as Governor.{{citation needed|date=October 2011|reason=this is opinion; should not be in editorial voice; cite to a specific historian who says this}} Nevertheless, the Court of Proprietors, forced the Directors to hurry Lord Clive to Bengal with the double powers of Governor and Commander-in-Chief.

==Third journey to India==
[[File:Khizr.JPG|thumb|Miniature of [[Al-Khidr]], from the "Small Clive Album" thought to have been given to Clive on his 1765<U+2013>67 visit to India by [[Shuja ud-Daula]], the Nawab of Awadh. The Album contains 62 folia of Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and floral pattern studies. The binding is from Indian brocade silk brought home by the [[Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis|2nd Lord Clive]], who served as [[Governor of Madras]], 1799 to 1803. Acquired by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1956.]]

On 3 May 1765 Clive landed at Calcutta to learn that Mir Jafar had died, leaving him personally <U+00A3>70,000. Mir Jafar was succeeded by his son Kasim Ali, though not before the government had been further demoralized by taking <U+00A3>100,000 as a gift from the new Nawab; while Kasim Ali had induced not only the viceroy of Awadh, but the emperor of Delhi himself, to invade [[Bihar]]. At this point a mutiny in the Bengal army occurred, which was a grim precursor of the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], but on this occasion it was quickly suppressed by [[blowing from a gun|blowing the sepoy ringleader from a gun]]. Major Munro, "the Napier of those times", scattered the united armies on the hard-fought field of [[Battle of Buxar|Buxar]]. The emperor, [[Shah Alam II]], detached himself from the league, while the Awadh viceroy threw himself on the mercy of the British.

Clive had now an opportunity of repeating in [[Hindustan]], or Upper India, what he had accomplished in Bengal. He might have secured what is now called [[Uttar Pradesh]], and have rendered unnecessary the campaigns of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellesley]] and [[Gerard Lake, 1st Viscount Lake|Lake]]. But he believed he had other work in the exploitation of the revenues and resources of rich Bengal itself, making it a base from which British India would afterwards steadily grow. Hence he returned to the Awadh viceroy all his territory save the provinces of [[Allahabad]] and [[Kora (tribe)|Kora]], which he presented to the weak emperor.

===The Imperial ''Firman''===
In return for the Awadhian provinces Clive secured from the emperor one of the most important documents in British history in India, effectively granting title of Bengal to Clive. It appears in the records as "[[Firman (decree)|firman]] from the King Shah Aalum, granting the dewany of Bengal, Behar and [[Odisha]] to the Company 1765." The date was 12 August 1765, the place [[Benares]], the throne an English dining-table covered with embroidered cloth and surmounted by a chair in Clive's tent. It is all pictured by a Muslim contemporary, who indignantly exclaims that so great a "transaction was done and finished in less time than would have been taken up in the sale of a jackass". By this deed the Company became the real sovereign rulers of thirty million people, yielding a revenue of four millions sterling.

On the same date Clive obtained not only an imperial charter for the Company's possessions in the Carnatic, completing the work he began at Arcot, but a third firman for the highest of all the lieutenancies of the empire, that of the Deccan itself. This fact is mentioned in a letter from the secret committee of the court of directors to the Madras government, dated 27 April 1768. The British presence in India was still tiny compared to the number and strength of the princes and people of India, but also compared to the forces of their ambitious French, Dutch and Danish rivals. Clive had this in mind when he penned his last advice to the directors, as he finally left India in 1767:

<blockquote>"We are sensible that, since the acquisition of the dewany, the power formerly belonging to the soubah of those provinces is totally, in fact, vested in the East India Company. Nothing remains to him but the name and shadow of authority. This name, however, this shadow, it is indispensably necessary we should seem to venerate."</blockquote>

===Attempts at administrative reform===
Having thus founded the Empire of British India, Clive sought to put in place a strong administration. The salaries of civil servants were increased, the acceptance of gifts from Indians was forbidden, and Clive exacted covenants under which participation in the inland trade was stopped. Unfortunately this had very little impact in reducing corruption, which remained widespread until the days of [[Warren Hastings]]. Clive's military reforms were more effective. He put down a mutiny of the British officers, who chose to resent the veto against receiving presents and the reduction of ''batta'' (extra pay) at a time when two Maratha armies were marching on Bengal. His reorganization of the army, on the lines of that which he had begun after Plassey, neglected during his absence in Great Britain, subsequently attracted the admiration of Indian officers. He divided the whole army into three brigades, making each a complete force, in itself equal to any single Indian army that could be brought against it. He had not enough British artillerymen, however, and would not make the mistake of his successors, who trained Indians to work the guns, which were later turned against the British.

==Retirement and death==
Clive left India for the last time in February 1767. In 1768, Clive lived for a time in the Chateau de Larzac near [[P<U+00E9>zenas]] in the [[H<U+00E9>rault]] [[d<U+00E9>partement]] of the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] region in southern [[France]]. Local tradition says that he was responsible for introducing the local [[pastry]] makers of P<U+00E9>zenas to a sweet pastry, [[P<U+00E9>zenas#Le petit p<U+00E2>t<U+00E9> de P<U+00E9>zenas|Le petit p<U+00E2>t<U+00E9> de P<U+00E9>zenas]], the size and shape of a large cotton reel with a sweet centre, and that he (or, more likely, his chef) had brought the recipe from India as a refined version of the savoury [[Keema]] [[naan]].<ref>[http://www.coolvines.com/wines/348754778894/Domaine-de-Larzac-Rousanne-Chardonnay-2007 Domaine de Larzac], coolvines.com, accessed 30 January 2012</ref> P<U+00E9>zenas is now known for these delicacies.

Later in 1768, Clive was made a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS).<ref name=Compeerage />

In 1769, he acquired the house and gardens at [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]] near Esher and commissioned [[Capability Brown|Lancelot "Capability" Brown]] to remodel the garden and rebuild the house.

In 1772 Parliament opened an inquiry into the Company's practices in India. Clive's political opponents turned these hearings into attacks on Clive. Questioned about some of the large sums of money he had received while in India, Clive pointed out that they were not contrary to accepted company practice, and defended his behavior by stating "I stand astonished at my own moderation" given opportunities for greater gain. The hearings highlighted the need for reform of the Company, and a vote to censure Clive for his actions failed. Later in 1772, Clive was invested in the [[Order of the Bath]] (eight years after the knighthood had been awarded),<ref name=Compeerage /> and was appointed [[Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire]].

There was a large famine in Bengal between 1769 and 1773, where the population of Bengal declined by a third. It was argued that the activities and aggrandizement of company officials- particularly using the monopoly rights on trade and land tax used for personal benefit of company officials is to blame for the famine.<ref>Smith, Adam (1776). The Wealth of Nations, Book 4, Chap. 5, Par. 45.</ref><ref>Dirks,Nicholas (2006) The scandal of Empire- India and the creation of Imperial Britain ISBN 978-8178241753</ref> The debates in the parliament and the revelations reduced his political fortunes considerably. 

Clive continued to be involved in ongoing Parliamentary discussions on company reforms, during which General [[John Burgoyne]], one of Clive's most vocal enemies, pressed the case in 1773 that some of Clive's gains were made at the expense of the Company and the government. Clive again made a spirited defense of his actions, and closed his testimony by stating "Take my fortune, but save my honour."  The vote that followed completely exonerated Clive, who was commended for the "great and meritorious service" he rendered to the country. Immediately thereafter Parliament began debating the [[Regulating Act of 1773]], which significantly reformed the East India Company's practices.

On 22 November 1774 Clive committed suicide, aged forty-nine, at his [[Berkeley Square]] home in London. There was no inquest on his death and it was variously alleged he had stabbed himself or cut his throat with a [[penknife]] or taken an overdose of [[opium]], while a few newspapers reported his death as due to an apoplectic fit or [[stroke]].<ref name=Bence-Jones>{{cite book|last=Bence-Jones|first=Mark|title=Clive of India|year=1974|publisher=Constable|page=299|ISBN=0-09-459830-4}}</ref> One twentieth century biographer, John Watney, concluded: "He did not die from a self-inflicted wound...He died of a [[heart attack]] brought on by an overdose of drugs".<ref name=Watney>{{cite book|last=Watney|first=John|title=Clive of India|year=1974|publisher=Saxon House|pages=216<U+2013>217|ISBN=0-347-00008-8}}</ref> Though Clive's suicide has been linked to his history of [[clinical depression|depression]] and to opium addiction, the likely immediate impetus was excruciating pain resulting from illness (he was known to suffer from [[gallstone]]s) which he had been attempting to abate with opium.   He had recently been offered command of British forces in [[North America]] which he had turned down.<ref>Harvey p.160</ref> He was buried in St Margaret's Parish Church at [[Moreton Say]], near his birthplace in Shropshire. 

Clive was awarded an Irish peerage and was created ''Baron Clive of Plassey co Clare''; he bought lands in [[County Limerick]] and [[County Clare]], [[Ireland]], naming part of his lands near [[Limerick|Limerick City]], [[Plassey, County Limerick|Plassey]]. Following [[Irish Free State|Irish independence]], these lands became state property. In the 1970s a [[National Institute for Higher Education|technical college]], which later became the [[University of Limerick]], was built at Plassey.
