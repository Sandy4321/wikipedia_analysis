'''Pennsylvania Route&nbsp;287''' is a {{convert|63.9|mi|km|adj=on}} long state highway in the Tioga Valley of [[Pennsylvania]]. Route 287 begins at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 220]] in the community of [[Larrys Creek, Pennsylvania|Larrys Creek]] in [[Piatt Township, Pennsylvania|Piatt Township]], [[Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Lycoming County]] to an intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 49]] just south of the [[New York]] state line in [[Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania|Lawrenceville]], [[Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Tioga County]]. The route follows [[Larrys Creek]] through several isolated communities including [[Salladasburg, Pennsylvania|Salladasburg]] and [[English Center, Pennsylvania|English Center]] before working its way towards [[Hoytville, Pennsylvania|Hoytville]], where it meets [[Pennsylvania Route 414]]. The route ends up in [[Wellsboro, Pennsylvania|Wellsboro]], where it meets [[U.S. Route 6]], and reaches [[Tioga, Pennsylvania|Tioga]]. 

The alignment of Route 287 has been successor to a set of plank roads from Larrys Creek to Lawrenceville. The southern plank road, known as the '''Larrys Creek Plank Road''', dates back to 1850 as short highway from Larrys Creek to Salladasburg, and was completely gone by 1900. The second part followed the '''Tioga and Lawrenceville Plank Road''', which although is named from Tioga to Lawrenceville, went from Wellsboro to Tioga. The portion to Lawrenceville was never constructed. The route also followed several postal routes in the area. In 1911, the [[Sproul Road Bill]] was passed, and Route 287 became segments of '''Legislative Route 22''', Legislative Route 106, and '''Legislative Route 353'''. In 1924, the northernmost portion was designated Route 4 and the [[Susquehanna Trail]]. This was changed to part of U.S. Route 220 in 1926.

In 1928, [[U.S. Route 111]] was designated, and along with '''Route 84''', consisted of the alignment of Route 287. Route 111 was redesignated as part of U.S. Route 15. The highway was redesignated as Route 287 in 1961 when Route 84 was decommissioned in favor of [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]]. The route was extended from Tioga to Lawrenceville in 2008, when the construction of U.S. Route 15 was finished to the [[New York]] state line, and Route 287 was extended to Route 49.

=== Old roads ===
[[Image:Second Fork Larrys Creek.JPG|thumb|right|Route 287 follows the Larrys Creek. The highway is visible in the back of the picture]]
Much of the current-day alignment for Route 287 has been constructed through many different post, plank and turnpike roads in Lycoming and Tioga Counties. The earliest known plank road in the area of the current day highway dates back to 1810, when a mail postal route was created along current day Route 287 from Wellsboro to Willardsburg (later known as Tioga). The mail was delievered once a week on horseback for several years, with the service discontinued in 1818. That year, the service was changed to a semi-weekly service for delivery two times a week on horseback. In 1824, this service was also discontinued when the mail route began to be used by coaches three times a week. This service was used and then decommissioned by 1835, when a new system, which stretched from Wellsboro and past Willardsburg to the community of Lawrenceville, was established. This route followed the alignment of Route 287, making stops in Middlebury Center, Holliday, Willardsburg and Mitchell's Creek before ending in Lawrenceville. This mail route was truncated back to Willardsburg in 1840, when the nearby [[Corning and Blossburg Railroad]] was completed. The stagecoach lines started working along the three-day process for about ten years, when the nearby Tioga and Wellsboro Plank Road was completed, which made stagecoaches run daily. Along with numerous competition, the service was discontinued in 1872, when the [[Lawrenceville and Wellsboro Railroad]] was completed. At that time, the stagecoach lines has ceased operation. By 1883, the only piece of mail routes in the area of Tioga County was a piece near Middlebury Center, but was not as large as the process once was.<ref name="mail">{{cite book|title=History of Tioga County, Pennsylvania|publisher=W. W. Munsell & Company|location=New York|date=1883}}</ref>

Although the Corning and Blossburg Railroad had served as a good travel connection between Wellsboro and Lawrenceville (the Tioga Valley), several communities in the [[Crooked Creek]] Valley felt they were not well accommodated. At that time, in locations where railroads were not a feasible option, the construction of [[Plank road|plank roads]] became a highly popular option. In 1848, the [[Pennsylvania State Legislature]] approved and chartered construction of a brand new plank road in the valley, to be called the Tioga and Elmira Plank Road, following the alignments of current-day Route 287, [[Pennsylvania Route 328]] and [[New York State Route 328]] to [[Elmira, New York]]. Construction was unable to start in 1848,<ref name="digest">{{cite book|last=Beitel|first=Calvin Gustavus|title=A digest of titles of corporations chartered by the legislature of Pennsylvania, between the years 1700 and 1873 inclusive: giving the dates of acts of incorporation, with the several supplements thereto, with a reference to the pages of the pamphlet laws, where they may be found|publisher=J.

Yet another supplement was added in 1850, when the Tioga and Lawrenceville Plank Road was chartered on May 14. This new plank road also had the ability to extend their plank road down to Wellsboro, which repealed the acts of 1848 and 1849. The plank road was contracted and completed in a timely fashion down to Wellsboro from Tioga. In 1851, the plank road was complete from Wellsboro to Tioga, and the thoroughfare became highly used by people transporting lumber, agriculture and merchandise. This helped farmers and producers in the communities of Middlebury Center, Holliday and Delmar (now the area of Wellsboro Junction). The plank road would eventually get worn out from use, and the route was eventually changed from a plank road to a high use turnpike. The {{convert|17|mi|km}} long piece of plank road, created in the original charter from Tioga to Lawrenceville, was never constructed.<ref name="mail" />
[[File:Plank Road Sign.JPG|left|thumb|Plank Road (Township Road 361) blade sign. This is the remaining piece of the plank road along Larrys Creek, but the alignment is now pavement]]
The southernmost portion of Route 287 was the location of a third plank road, this time beginning at the mouth of [[Larrys Creek]] in the eponymous community to the current day location of [[English Center, Pennsylvania|English Center]]. The road was first considered during the early 1800s; James Williamson, a strong local entrepenuer lived in these areas and it is assumed that the road builders in this area of Lycoming County were in favor of his suggestions. On May 8, 1850, the Pennsylvania State Legislature chartered a brand new plank road along the riverbank of Larrys Creek. The stock of the plank road was 20 shares of $40.00 (1850 [[USD]]). Williamson himself was awarded the job as contractor, and in 1850, using full advantage of woodsmen who were unemployed, low wages, and wasted hemlock log trees, began construction. By 1851, the plank road had been constructed all the way to the commmunity of Salladasburg. With the {{convert|8|ft|m}}-wide plank road came several tollhouses along the entire route to pay charge for using the roadway. A moveable barrier was also installed, so people could not gain access without payment. The plank road was finished and prospered for many years. The common transport on the road was [[bark]] and [[hides]], along with hauling leather over to the [[Larrys Creek Railroad]]. On June 1, 1889, a major flood hit the area around the plank road, and when things were all said and done, it had experienced extensive damage. In places where damage had occurred, the road was replaced by graded dirt roads. In 1900, the remains of the plank road remained only from Salladasburg to the Larrys Creek Railroad Station. Later that year, a petition was raised to make this remaining piece of road free to access. The case was closed in support of the motion and the plank road company shut down  forever.<ref name="plank">{{cite journal

=== Designation of Route 84 ===
[[File:PA-84.svg|right|thumb|120px|PA 84 (1928 &ndash; 1961)]]
On May 31, 1911, the state of Pennsylvania signed the [[Sproul Road Bill]], which started a drastic state takeover of highways around the commonwealth. Originally, only several routes were assigned around the state. The bill had approved a road from Wellsboro to the [[New York]] state line, which was designated as Legislative Route 22. At the time, this was the only state-maintained portion of Route 287 that was in use.<ref name="1911state">{{cite map|title=Map of State Roads|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|year=1911|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1911.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=July 24, 2009}}</ref> By 1915, more of Route 287 was taken over by the state, with the portion from the current-day intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 414]] in [[Morris Township, Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Morris Township]] to the intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 660]] in Wellsboro becoming designated as Legislative Route 106, where it reached Legislative Route 22 and 21.<ref name="1915tioga">{{cite map|title=Tioga County|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|year=1915|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Tioga_1915.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=July 24, 2009}}</ref> In 1916, the portion from Legislative Route 23 (now the intersection with U.S. Route 220) in Larrys Creek to the community of [[Brookside, Pennsylvania|Brookside]] was taken over as Legislative Route 353.<ref name="1916lycoming">{{cite map|title=Lycoming County|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|year=1916|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Lycoming_1916.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=July 24, 2009}}</ref> The designations remained in place until 1924, when actual route designations were assigned in the commonwealth.

This remained in place for only two years, and when the [[Pennsylvania Department of Highways]] redesignated highways across the entire commonwealth, the alignment of the U.S. Route 220 portion was redesignated as [[U.S. Route 111]], while the entire alignment of Route 287 from the Larrys Creek to Tioga was redesignated as Route 84.<ref name="1928map">{{cite map|title=Map Showing Pennsylvania State Highways|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|year=1928}}</ref> The entire alignment of Route 84 consisted of an intersection with U.S. Route 220 in Larrys Creek to U.S. Route 111 in Tioga, where the highway terminated.<ref name="1929map">{{cite map|title=Map Showing Pennsylvania State Highways|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|year=1929}}</ref> In 1930, the concurrent piece of Legislative Route 4 was decommissioned, and the alignment of the highway remained as U.S. Route 111.<ref name="1930map">{{cite map|title=Tourist Map of Pennsylvania State Highways|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|date=1930|cartography=Pennsylvania Department of Highways}}</ref> The portion from Tioga north remained as Route 111 until 1936, when the highway was renumbered to U.S. Route 15.<ref name="1937map">{{cite map|title=Official Pennsylvania Road Map|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|date=1937|cartography=Pennsylvania Department of Highways}}</ref> In that time, several intersections along Route 287 tied in with several former state highways.

During the 1960s, plans developed to widen U.S. Route 15 for safety precautions. Construction progressed fast, reaching the Lycoming County line in 1968. At the time, Route 287 terminated at an intersection with U.S. Route 15 at the Hammond Reservoir. Ten years later, Route 15 was completed up to Tioga, and that year, the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] extended Route 287 to the new interchange.<ref name="con">{{cite web|url=http://www.pahighways.com/interstates/I99-US15upgrading_files/I99-US15upgrading_frames.htm|title=U.S. Route 15 Upgrade Map|last=Kitsko|first=Jeff|publisher=Pennsylvania Highways|accessdate=July 24, 2009}}</ref> At that point, U.S. Route 15 followed the northernmost alignment of PA 287 to Lawrenceville.

=== Lycoming County ===
Route 287 begins at an interchange with westbound [[U.S. Route 220]] in the [[Piatt Township, Pennsylvania|Piatt Township]] community of [[Larrys Creek, Pennsylvania|Larrys Creek]]. The route heads north, following a former plank road through the rural areas to the west of [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]]. After a while, the roadway becomes moderately developed, following residential houses for a short distance. The route enters the community of [[Larrysville, Pennsylvania|Larrysville]], where the route turns to the northwest through a line of forests. Route 287 intersects with Zinck Road, where the roadway becomes highly developed, following the route past residential homes and a large factory. The route crosses through a small patch of forests and enters [[Mifflin Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Mifflin Township]], where it intersects with [[Pennsylvania Route 973]]. Route 973 becomes concurrent with Route 287 here, entering the community of [[Salladasburg, Pennsylvania|Salladasburg]], where the two highways fork. Route 287 continues northward on the right-of-way, while Route 973 heads to the northeast along Main Street. At an intersection with Dochter Street, a connector to Route 973, Route 287 turns to the northwest and leaves Salladasburg.<ref name="yahoo">{{yahoo maps|title=Overview map of Pennsylvania Route 287|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=41.714223&lon=-77.282789&zoom=11&q1=41.219538%2C-77.220734&q2=41.544373%2C-77.28545&q3=41.857868%2C-77.23584&q4=41.930463%2C-77.113703&q5=41.999612%2C-77.12705|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}</ref>

Route 287 continues northward after leaving Salladasburg, paralleling Route 973 for a short distance until the two highways turn away. Route 287 heads northward, passing through deep patches of forests. This alignment and surroundings remain the same for several miles, passing a few local roads. The deep forests begin to clear as the highway enters the community of [[Brookside, Pennsylvania|Brookside]]. In Brookside, Route 287 winds along a deep field, intersecting with the southern terminus of [[Pennsylvania Route 184]], which heads to the northeast. The route turns to the northwest, paralleling with Hughes Road, which merges in soon after. The highway continues northward in the fields north of Brookside until after Hughes Road, where it enters deep forests once again. Route 287 winds around curves, until the intersection with Lick Run Road, where it turns to the northwest, entering the isolated community of [[English Center, Pennsylvania|English Center]]. In English Center, the route intersects with Little Pine Creek Road, where Route 287 turns to the north. The route returns to the deep forests, intersecting with [[Pennsylvania Route 284]]. Route 287 turns to the northwest at that intersection, continuing through the deep forests. After several miles, the route turns to the northeast, passing to the west of a large pond. The forests began to clear as Route 287 enters the community of [[Pine Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Pine Township]], where the route continues northward, through fields and tree patches. At an intersection with Granger Lane, Route 287 crosses the county line into [[Tioga County, Pennsylvania|Tioga County]].<ref name="yahoo" />

[[File:Signage along PA 287 and PA 414.jpg|right|thumb|Signage along PA 287 and PA 414 between Hoytville and Morris]]
After entering Tioga County, Route 287 continues to the north, entering the community of [[Texas, Pennsylvania|Texas]], which mainly consists of large fields. The highway continues along this right-of-way, passing a large factory before entering the community of [[Mount Pleasant, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Mount Pleasant]]. At an intersection with Mount Pleasant Road, Route 287 turns to the northeast, bending around deep forests. The route crosses Hurney Hill Road, which is where the highway turns to the northwest. When the highway makes a curve to the northeast, Route 287 enters the community of [[Hoytville, Pennsylvania|Hoytville]]. In Hoytville, Route 287 intersects with [[Pennsylvania Route 414]], which becomes concurrent with Route 287 for a distance. Routes 287 and 414 continue to the northeast, working its way along the residential homes in Hoytville. A short distance later, the highways enter the highly developed area in Hoytville in Morris Township. At an intersection in the center of the community, Route 287 turns to the north while Route 414 turns to the south, with the two highways splitting. Route 287 turns to the northeast, leaving the downtown area of Morris Township. After Morris Township, most of the route becomes surrounded by forests, except for a distance with residential homes following the northbound lanes. The surroundings return to the deep forests in both directions, with Route 287 continuing northward for several miles.<ref name="yahoo" />
[[File:Signage in Wellsboro for PA 287 and PA 660.jpg|left|thumb|Wellsboro signage for the PA 287 and PA 660 concurrency]]
Route 287 begins to parallel a waterway, entering the community of [[Antrim, Pennsylvania|Antrim]], which is surrounded mainly by forests. After Antrim, the highway continues northward through the deep forests for several miles, until entering the community of [[Knapp, Pennsylvania|Knapp]]. In Knapp, Route 287 continues to the northeast, passing several fields and intersecting with a local road towards [[Broughton Hollow, Pennsylvania|Broughton Hollow]]. At an intersection with Dean Hill Road, the highway turns to the northeast through the fields, entering [[Coolidge Hollows, Pennsylvnaia|Coolidge Hollows]], a small farming community. At an intersection with Sweetbriar Road, Route 287 turns to the north, passing some homes before turning to the northeast into the farmlands once again. Approaching the intersection with Shumway Hill Road, the highway makes a gradual bend to the northwest, passing a large pond to the west, where it gains the name of Central Avenue as the route enters the community of [[Wellsboro, Pennsylvania|Wellsboro]]. Route 287 heads along Central Avenue through a highly developed business and residential community until the intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 660]] (Main Street), where the highway turns eastward on a concurrency with Route 660. Routes 287 and 660 continue to the northeast along Main Street in the center of the community, where the two highways intersect with [[U.S. Route 6 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 6]]. At the U.S. Route 6 intersection, Route 660 turns along U.S. Route 6 East while Route 287 continues along U.S. Route 6 Westbound. Routes 6 and 287 head to the northeast through the community center, passing to the east of [[Wellsboro Cemetery]] before the two highways turn to the northwest along Tioga Street. At an intersection with Hillboldt Road, Route 287 and Route 6 leave Wellsboro. The two highways enter [[Stokesdale, Pennsylvania|Stokesdale]], a residential community before a fork in the highway, with Route 6 turning towards the west and Route 287 towards the north.<ref name="yahoo" />

Route 287, after the split with Route 6, heads to the northeast, entering the community of [[Wellsboro Junction, Pennsylvania|Wellsboro Junction]]. Wellsboro Junction is mainly fields, with the route heading as the main highway. After passing a few factories, Route 287 turns to the northeast and out of Wellsboro Junction. The highway passes a large pond, as well as a few residential homes. Route 287 continues along the rural alignment, entering a small community of residential homes and fields. The route continues to the northeast, entering the community of [[Middlebury Center, Pennsylvania|Middlebury Center]], where it intersects with the terminus of [[Pennsylvania Route 249]] and Mill Plank Road. The route turns to the northeast in the barren residential community. The route crosses over a river and heads on a striaght northeast alignment, passing through a residential community. A short distance later, Route 287 turns to the northeast, paralleling a railroad. The route widens to three lanes where it passes a large field. Route 287 turns to the north, reaching the northern terminus of the nearby railroad. The route heads to the north, crossing the [[Tioga Dam]] along the [[Hammond Reservoir]] and entering the community of [[Crooked Creek, Pennsylvania|Crooked Creek]].<ref name="yahoo" /> 
[[File:PA 287 at PA 49 and US 15 in Lawrenceville.jpg|right|thumb|PA 287 at PA 49 in Lawrenceville]]
The route continues northward along the eastern shore of the reservoir, until the northern end of the reservoir, where it turns to the east, entering the municipality of [[Tioga, Pennsylvania|Tioga]]. In Tioga, Route 287 heads along Wellsboro Street in a moderately developed part of the community until turning to the north on North Main Street. Route 287 continues along North Main Street until leaving Tioga. A short distance later, Route 287 interchanges with [[U.S. Route 15 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 15]] (the Appalachian Thruway). Route 287 continues along the former alignment of Route 15 into [[Mitchell Creek, Pennsylvania|Mitchell Creek]], a small community. The route heads northward, entering [[Beeman, Pennsylvania|Beeman]] which consists of a local business center. In the center, Route 287 intersects with the western terminus of [[Pennsylvania Route 328]]. The route intersects with Somers Lane before entering the community of [[Somers Lane, Pennsylvania|Somers Lane]], which is a barren area. The route heads to the northwest along the [[Tioga River]], crossing another railroad, and soon over the river. After the river, Route 287 enters the municipality of [[Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania|Lawrenceville]], where the highway intersects with [[Pennsylvania Route 49]]'s eastern terminus.
