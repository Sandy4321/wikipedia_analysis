== Political profile ==
[[File:JMU y Scioli.png|thumb|Juan Manuel Urtubey and Daniel Scioli]]
Juan Manuel Urtubey is critic of his predecessor, Juan Carlos Romero, to whom he blames faults in his administration that constituted many of the problems for the incumbent government. He qualified Juan Carlos Romero, former vice-president candidate to [[Carlos Menem]], as the leader of a "pseudo-feudal regime" and head of the "old politics".<ref>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1363813-urtubey-vs-romero-la-batalla-de-salta] IN SPANISH, La Nacion Newspaper, 4/08/2011, last checked 7/20/2014</ref>

In a national level, Urtubey is a member of the  [[Justicialist Party]] (PJ), having been PJ Caucus Chairman when being national deputy. In spite of his alliance to the current Argentine President  [[Cristina Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Kirchner]] he was always noticed for publicly criticizing National Government's actions, decisions and policies he opposed to.<ref>[http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2008/08/19/noticia_0016.html] IN SPANISH, Perfil Newspaper,  08/19/2008, last checked 07/20/2014</ref> In this line he criticized the "personalist" characteristic of [[Kirchnerism]] and opposed the re-election of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner <ref>[http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/noticias/val/69060/urtubey-se-suma-a-anibal-y-le-baja-el-tono-a-la-reeleccion-de-cristina-es-inaceptable-postularla-hoy.html] In SPANISH, La Pol<U+00ED>tica Online Newspaper, 11/04/2010, last checked 07/20/2014</ref><ref>[http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/nota/69926/] IN SPANISH, La Pol<U+00ED>tica Online Newspaper, 5/24/2013, last checked 07/20/2014</ref>
Urtubey keeps a tense relationship with the newspaper [[El Tribuno]], owned by former governor Romero, political opponent of Urtubey. This newspaper does not only criticizes permanently Urtubey's office, but has also provenly invented news. One of those examples is an article that narrated the story of "an {{sic|extremly}} poor mother that boiled a rock to look as she was cooking while her famished sons went to sleep",  with an illustrative picture. Not later, it was proved that this picture was taken from a Mexican Newspaper that recounted that story that happened in Honduras.<ref>[http://www.elintransigente.com/notas/2014/1/21/otra-mentira-mas-tribuno-que-revela-mujer-que-hervia-las-piedras-era-mexicana-saltena-227324.asp] IN SPANISH, El Intransigente Newspaper, 01/21/2014, last checked 07/20/2014</ref>

Urtubey had been frequently criticized for his extravagant way of life that includes sport motorcycle riding,  or [[bungee jumping]] from the highest building in [[Auckland]].<ref>[http://www.elintransigente.com/notas/2011/10/18/manuel-urtubey-transgresor-irresponsable-extravagante-bipolar-107290.asp] IN SPANISH, El Intransigente, 10/18/2014, last checked 07/20/2014</ref>

He has been always close to  [[Jorge Bergoglio]], far before to his election as Catholic Church Pope.<ref>[http://www.quepasasalta.com.ar/34865] IN SPANISH, Que Pasa Salta Newspaper, 10/18/2014, Last Checked 07/20/2014</ref><ref>[http://www.lavoz.com.ar/noticias/politica/bergoglio-pidio-un-nuevo-liderazgo-y-advirtio-que-el-pais-esta-danado] IN SPANISH, La Voz Newspaper, 10/16/2014, last checked 07/20/2014</ref> However, obeyed the Pope's will when he asked argentinians "to avoid traveling to Rome, but give away that money to poor people" <ref>[http://www.elaconquija.com/notas/2013/3/15/urtubey-tampoco-viajara-roma-para-asuncion-francisco-16623.asp] IN SPANISH, El Aconquija, 03/15/2014, last checked 07/20/2014</ref>

== Government of Salta 2007-2011 ==

In 2007 he was elected Governor of Salta with 45,47% of votes.

=== Economy ===

In many ways, Urtubey followed his predecessor's economic policy: he encouraged international investment, encouraged exports, improved land and air communications  between Salta Province and the rest of the county, improved tax policies and invested in infrastructure.

However, in many aspects, his economic policy was innovative for the Province: he renewed the public employee payroll as to include in the provincial Government trained youth force from every social strata.

In 2009, he nationalized the Provincial Water Supply Company, as to improve access to drinking water.<ref>[http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/noticias/val/57652/urtubey-estatizo-aguas-de-salta-y-enojo-a-kirchner-y-de-vido.html] IN SPANISH, La Pol<U+00ED>tica Online, 5/28/2009, last checked 7/20/2014</ref>

In 2010, the province took control of the Materno Infantil Hospital, which was controversially privatized by former governor Juan Carlos Romero.<ref>[http://www.elintransigente.com/notas/2010/9/24/urtubey-rescinde-contrato-santa-tecla-estatiza-hospital-materno-infantil-56745.asp] IN SPANISH, 9/24/2010, last checked 7/20/2014</ref>

Regarding to Tourism Policies, the Province encouraged international quality sport events, as to make Salta one of the principal tourist destinations in South America. For example, National Rugby team hosted a test match against England in the province.<ref>[http://ar.reuters.com/article/topNews/idARN139476220090614?sp=true] IN SPANISH 06/13/2009, last checked 07/20/2014</ref> In 2010, [[Rally Dakar]] raced across Salta Province.

===Democracy ===

With Urtubey in office, Salta Province became the first Province in Argentina to use [[Electronic voting]] which benefits electoral transparency and accelerates vote counting.
This system in particular, was praised by international observers.<ref>[http://www.elintransigente.com/notas/2013/12/20/observadores-uruguayos-califican-positivamente-sistema-voto-electronico-salta-223351.asp] IN SPANISH, El Intransigente, 20/12/2013, last checked in 07/20/2014</ref>
Doctor [[Nestor Pedro Sag<U+00FC><U+00E9>s]], Constitutional Law Expert and Professor, concluded that Electronic Voting in Salta satisfies the conditions recommended by the Constitutional Court of Germany.<ref>[http://www.informatesalta.com.ar/noticia.asp?q=52777] IN SPANISH, Informate Salta Newspaper, 09/22/2013, last checked 07/20/2014</ref>

===Controversies===

==== New education law and religious education====

In 1886, catholic education was imposed in the province. Since then, only three Argentine provinces (Salta, Jujuy and Santiago del Estero) have been the only ones in which catholic education is compulsory <ref name="Cronista">[http://www.cronista.com/economia/-Laica-o-libre-Salta-podria-reavivar-la-vieja-antinomia-20081214-0009.html] IN SPANISH, La Cronista Newspaper, 12/14/2008, last checked 07/20/2014''.</ref><ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2008/12/20/sociedad/s-01825769.htm]  IN SPANISH, 20/12/2008, last checked 07/20/2014</ref><ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-119311-2009-02-01.html]  IN SPANISH, P<U+00E1>gina 12 Newspaper, 02/01/2009, last checked 07/20/2014</ref>

In 2008, during Juan Manuel Urtubey government, the Provincial Congress modified these laws. The new laws established religious education in every provincial school without distinction of belief
<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2008/12/20/sociedad/s-01825769.htm] IN SPANISH, Clarin Newspaper, 20/12/2008, last checked 07/20/2014</ref> This, was criticized by many sectors, that demanded complete banning of religious education in public Schools. In spite of the criticism, it was declared constitutional by the Provincial Supreme Court <ref>[http://www.eltribuno.info/salta/302134-La-Justicia-respaldo-la-educacion-religiosa-en-la-escuela-publica.note.aspx] IN SPANISH, El Tribuno Newspaper, 07/13/2013, last checked 07/20/2014</ref>

==== Human Rights ====
In 2011, many political factions criticized former Governor Juan Carlos Romero, current governor Urtubey and other political movements in Salta due to opinions and policies regarding [[LGBT]] minorities. They demanded Urtubey abolition of laws that banned prostitution <ref>[http://www.sentidog.com/lat/2011/04/el-triunfo-de-urtubey-y-la-homofobia-en-salta/] IN SPANISH, Sentidog Newspaper, 04/13/2011 last checked 07/20/2014</ref>

However, in 2013, Urtubey's office was praised by diverse LGTB organizations by transforming Salta into one of the first provinces to accept genre identity.

In march, 2012, after the ruling of the Argentine Supreme Court, Salta became the first province to regulate non punishable abortion. Urtubey authorized this law in spite of his personal beliefs<ref>[http://www.26noticias.com.ar/el-gobernador-de-salta-reglamento-procedimientos-para-abortos-no-punibles-149093.html] IN SPANISH, Noticias 26, 03/23/2014, last checked 07/20/2014</ref>

== Government of Salta 2011-2015 ==

=== Historic Reparation Fund ===

On November 17, 2011, encouraged by Governor Urtubey, the provincial congress passed the law number 7651 that created the Historic Reparation Fund for the North of the Province of  Salta. This law authorized to destine u$s 220.000.000 to finance an Infrastructure Plan for the Departaments of Oran, San Mart<U+00ED>n and Rivadavia.

The Historic Reparation Fund, "breaks the negative intromission of sectors that don't represent institutions"  as well as benefiting "the long forgotten people of Salta" <ref>[http://www.elintransigente.com/notas/2013/4/25/martin-grande-sobre-frh-aunque-arda-tribuno-plata-esta-siendo-invertida-obras-reales-181494.asp] IN SPANISH, El Tribuno Website, 04/25/2013, last checked 07/20/2014</ref> by creating infrastructure and jobs.

=== Tourism ===

During Urtubey's administration, Salta was consolidated as one of the main tourist destinations in South America.<ref>[http://turismo.salta.gov.ar/contenido/1017/urtubey-recibio-el-premio-sol-andino-por-la-gestion-turistica-2013-de-la-provincia] IN SPANISH, Salta Institutional Website, 10/11/2013, last checked 07/20/2013</ref>

Since his second provincial government, Urtubey works together with [[Daniel Scioli]], governor of [[Buenos Aires]] Province in the area of tourism <ref>[http://tiempo.infonews.com/2014/01/23/argentina-117272-scioli-y-urtubey-juntos-y-cautos-en-mar-del-plata.php] IN SPANISH, Infonews, 23/01/2014, last checked 07/20/2014</ref>
