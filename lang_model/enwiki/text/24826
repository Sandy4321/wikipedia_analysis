THIS PLACE is a global art project that explores the complexity of [[Israel]] and the [[West Bank]] through the eyes of twelve internationally acclaimed photographers.  The participating artists are [[Frederic Brenner]], [[Wendy Ewald]], Martin Kollar, [[Josef Koudelka]], Jungjin Lee, [[Gilles Peress]], [[Fazal Sheikh]], [[Stephen Shore]], [[Rosalind Solomon]], [[Thomas Struth]], [[Jeff Wall]], and [[Nick Waplington]]. Each photographer created highly individualized works in response to his or her own experience in the area; the result is over 500 images which will be exhibited internationally and published in a series of monographs.<ref name="NYT, The Lens">{{cite web|last1=Estrin|first1=James|title=Embracing Ambiguity in Israel|url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/embracing-ambiguity-in-israel/|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref>
== History ==

Initiated by [[Frederic Brenner]], the project follows in the tradition of historic endeavors such as the [[Mission H<U+00E9>liographiques]] in nineteenth-century France and the [[Farm Security Administration]] in the United States, which gathered artists who use photography to ask essential questions about culture, society and the inner lives of individuals.<ref name=Time>{{cite web|last1=Tharoor|first1=Ishaan|title=Picturing the Holy Land: 12 Photographers Chart a Region<U+2019>s Complexities  Read more: Picturing the Holy Land: Photographers Chart Region<U+2019>s Complexities - LightBox http://lightbox.time.com/2014/04/16/west-bank-israel-photos/#ixzz33b995k8d|url=http://lightbox.time.com/2014/04/16/west-bank-israel-photos/#1|website=Time LightBox|publisher=Time|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>
Each artist spent approximately six months in residence, traveling throughout [[Israel]] and the [[West Bank]], following his or her own line of investigation. Brenner offered the photographers initial exploratory visits, so they could decide if, and how, that wanted to be involved with the project.<ref name="The New York Times">{{cite web|last1=Kershner|first1=Isabel|title=Top Photographers Try Looking at Israel From New Angles|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/world/middleeast/photography-project-seeks-new-angles-on-israel.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 December 2014}}</ref> According to TIME: "This Place is not an act of photojournalism, nor does it contain <U+2014> or send <U+2013> a clear, unified message."<ref name=Time>{{cite web|last1=Tharoor|first1=Ishaan|title=Picturing the Holy Land: 12 Photographers Chart a Region<U+2019>s Complexities  Read more: Picturing the Holy Land: Photographers Chart Region<U+2019>s Complexities - LightBox http://lightbox.time.com/2014/04/16/west-bank-israel-photos/#ixzz33b995k8d|url=http://lightbox.time.com/2014/04/16/west-bank-israel-photos/#1|website=Time LightBox|publisher=Time|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>
== Exhibitions ==

The completed work has been organized into a major exhibition, curated by Charlotte Cotton, who stated that <U+201C>Each artist has created a profound and personal narration of Israel and the West Bank, that, collectively, act a series of guides, leading the viewer into a deeper identification with the complexities and conflicts of the Holy Land."<ref name=Time>{{cite web|last1=Tharoor|first1=Ishaan|title=Picturing the Holy Land: 12 Photographers Chart a Region<U+2019>s Complexities  Read more: Picturing the Holy Land: Photographers Chart Region<U+2019>s Complexities - LightBox http://lightbox.time.com/2014/04/16/west-bank-israel-photos/#ixzz33b995k8d|url=http://lightbox.time.com/2014/04/16/west-bank-israel-photos/#1|website=Time LightBox|publisher=Time|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref> The exhibition will open at DOX Centre for Contemporary Art in Prague on October 24, 2014.
