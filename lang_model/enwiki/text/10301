==History==
===Early years (2001<U+2013>02)===
Fall Out Boy was formed in early 2001 by friends Joe Trohman and Pete Wentz, who had played in various [[hardcore punk]] bands in the Chicago area. Inspired by bands they listened to growing up, such as [[Green Day]], [[Descendents (band)|Descendents]], and [[The Smiths]], the pair decided to start their own band.<ref name=Sugarush>{{cite web |last=Gitlin |first=Lauren |title=Fall Out Boy's Sugar Rush |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=August 12, 2005 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7546662/fall_out_boys_sugar_rush |accessdate=2009-11-22}}</ref> Trohman met high schooler Patrick Stump in a Borders Bookstore.<ref>{{cite web |title=Joe Trohman: Biography |work=[[TV.com]] |url=http://www.tv.com/joe-trohman/person/412087/biography.html |accessdate=2009-11-22}}</ref> Trohman introduced himself to Stump when he overheard him talking about the band [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]], in which they shared a mutual interest.<ref name=Fender>{{cite web |title=Joe Trohman / Fall Out Boy |publisher=fendercom |url=http://www.fender.com/artists/artist.php?id=297 |accessdate=2009-11-29}}</ref> Stump auditioned as a drummer, but his impressive vocal range led to his placement as the lead vocalist.<ref>{{cite video | people = Fall Out Boy (2004) | title = My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue | medium = DVD | publisher = Fueled By Ramen | date = 2004 }}</ref> Two other Chicago musicians were recruited to play drums and guitar.

===Citizens for Our Betterment (2008)===
A viral campaign was launched by Pete Wentz on August 18, 2008, to promote what is now known to be the band's fifth studio album ''[[Folie <U+00E0> Deux]]''. The campaign started  when the website for [[Decaydance Records]] was supposedly "hacked" by an organization called "Citizens For Our Betterment".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1593226/20080821/fall_out_boy.jhtml |title=Fall Out Boy's 'Citizens For Our Betterment' Viral Campaign Hijacked By Florida Rockers Copeland |author= Montgomery, James |date=April 21, 2008 |publisher= MTV News |accessdate= 2009-11-22}}</ref> A posted link led to the organization's website which was decorated in the colors of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Exposes! Scandals! |url= http://citizensforourbetterment.com/ | publisher= Citizens For Our Betterment | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080822030724/http://citizensforourbetterment.com/ |archivedate= 2008-08-22}}</ref> Links on the page were met with dead ends, requiring specific [[IP address]]es to access their destinations. A post counter was displayed on the page with the number 59,994, and a blog post on the website was numbered 59,996. Wentz left clues on his personal blog that the 60,000 would reveal something big. The Decaydance site returned back to normal the following day. On August 19, [[Ashlee Simpson]] was seen carrying a pamphlet for the organization, raising suspicion and sparking many rumors online. New posts appeared on the Citizens For Our Betterment web page everyday, many referring to November 4, the same day as the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]]. Also, Wentz posted more clues on his blog and further links were opened to the public. On August 24, one such link led to a page saying "FOB - The Return - November Four" in large stencil font, causing many to believe that Fall Out Boy would release their new album on November 4. Others theorized that this was another one of Wentz's attempts to raise political awareness, as he did by previously holding a rally for the United States [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Presidential Candidate]], [[Barack Obama]]. In addition, many Fueled By Ramen bands posted [[MySpace]] bulletins the same day with the title "Welcome To The New Administration". Every bulletin contained one word: ten. Finally, on August 25, 2008, the Citizens For Our Betterment website was redirected to the band's "Friends or Enemies" page, which now displayed an image of a voting booth featuring ballots with the names of several Decaydance artists. By clicking on each individual ballot, there is an audio clip from the respective artist reciting passages from past posts on the Citizens For Our Betterment website. A [[mixtape]] was also made available for download called "[[Welcome To The New Administration]]" that included songs from several Decaydance bands and an interlude by [[Ludacris]] announcing that the album would be released on November 4.

===''Folie <U+00E0> Deux'' (2008<U+2013>09)===
On December 16, 2008, the band released its fifth studio album, ''[[Folie <U+00E0> Deux]]'', as a follow-up to their 2007 album ''[[Infinity on High]]''. The band collaborated with other artists such as [[Elvis Costello]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]], [[Gabe Saporta]] of [[Cobra Starship]], [[Travis McCoy]] of [[Gym Class Heroes]], Doug, [[Alex DeLeon]] of [[The Cab]], [[William Beckett]] of [[The Academy Is...]], [[Debbie Harry]] of [[Blondie]] and [[Pharrell Williams]].

When interviewed for a retrospective article in ''[[Alternative Press]]'' at the time The Get Up Kids disbanded in 2005, Pete Wentz stated that "Fall Out Boy would not be a band if it were not for The Get Up Kids."<ref>"Say Goodnight, Mean Goodbye: The Oral History of [[The Get Up Kids]]". ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]],'' issue #204.<!-- Where's the date of publication, the page number(s), and author? --></ref> 

A central part of Fall Out Boy's sound is rooted in the band's lyrics, mainly penned by bassist Pete Wentz, who commonly uses irony and other literary devices to narrate personal experience and stories.<ref name=Cork /> Their albums ''[[Take This To Your Grave]]'' and ''[[From Under The Cork Tree]]'' are both said to have [[pop punk]] as well as [[punk rock]] sounds and influences,<ref>{{citeweb |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |title=Take This To Your Grave |work=[[Allmusic]] |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dzfyxq8ald6e |accessdate = November 28, 2009}}</ref><ref name=Cork>{{cite web |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |title=From Under The Cork Tree |work=[[Allmusic]] |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0xfexq9sldje |accessdate = November 28, 2009}}</ref> and ''Infinity on High'' features a wide range of styles and instrumentation, including orchestral and choral arrangements ("[[Thnks fr th Mmrs]]" and "[[You're Crashing, But You're No Wave]]") and a slower piano ballad ("[[Golden (song)|Golden]]"). On ''Folie <U+00E0> Deux'', Fall Out Boy continues to evolve their sound, increasing the use of piano ("What a Catch, Donnie", "Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet" and "20 Dollar Nose Bleed"), synthesizers, and guest artists. The band also shows a number of influences, with the opening track borrowing a chord sequence from [[The Who]] song "[[Baba O'Riley]]"<ref>Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:wzftxz8kldde Folie a Deux > Overview] ''AMG.''</ref>  and "What a Catch, Donnie" referencing [[Roberta Flack]] and [[Donny Hathaway]] in both sound and lyrics.

The band has worked with many producers and artists, including [[The Neptunes]], [[Timbaland]], Lil' Wayne and [[Kanye West]], who Patrick Stump described as "the [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] of his generation."<ref>Scaggs, Austin (December 11, 2008).
