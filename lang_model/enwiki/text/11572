The '''Estadio [[Jos<U+00E9> Amalfitani]]''' (in English: Jos<U+00E9> Amalfitani Stadium) is a [[stadium]] located in the [[Liniers]] neighbourhood of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], in close proximity to [[Liniers railway station]].<ref name=cavs/> The venue is mainly used for [[Association football|football]] matches and is the home of the [[Argentine Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n]] club [[Club Atl<U+00E9>tico V<U+00E9>lez S<U+00E1>rsfield|V<U+00E9>lez S<U+00E1>rsfield]]. The stadium is nicknamed ''El Fort<U+00ED>n'' (in English: "The Small Fort") or ''El Fort<U+00ED>n de Liniers'' ("The Small Fort of Liniers"). Alternatively, it is also called '''V<U+00E9>lez Sarsfield Stadium'''.

The stadium was built between 1941 and 1943 in wood, and rebuilt in cement between 1947 and 1951.<ref name=cavs/> 27 years later, it was expanded in preparation for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. The Jos<U+00E9> Amalfitani has capacity for 49,540 spectators, although it does not provide seating for all of them like most Argentine stadia.

The Estadio Jos<U+00E9> Amalfitani is also the [[national stadium]] for the [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentine rugby union national team]] (a.k.a. ''Los Pumas''). Although the team plays test matches throughout the country, their highest-profile tests are usually held here.

==History==
===Foundation and early remodelling===

Before buying the terrain to build the stadium, [[Club Atl<U+00E9>tico V<U+00E9>lez S<U+00E1>rsfield|V<U+00E9>lez S<U+00E1>rsfield]] played their home matches in a rented ground on the [[Villa Luro]] neighbourhood. The original ground was the one that earned the nickname ''El Fort<U+00ED>n'' in 1932, for the team's strength playing at home.

After suffering [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] from the [[Argentine Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n]] in 1940, V<U+00E9>lez was sacked from the Villa Luro ground they were renting. Three years later, in 1941, the club obtained the terrain of the current stadium, property of the [[Buenos Aires Western Railway]]. The ground was a swamp of the [[Maldonado Stream]], where construction was difficult. However, the club's president [[Jos<U+00E9> Amalfitani]] led the construction, which was terminated in 1943. The new stadium used the same wood stands from the old Villa Luro stadium, and was inaugurated in a 2<U+2013>2 draw with [[Club Atl<U+00E9>tico River Plate|River Plate]]. V<U+00E9>lez striker [[Juan Jos<U+00E9> Ferraro]] scored the first goal in the stadium's history (the others were scored by [[<U+00C1>ngel Fern<U+00E1>ndez (Uruguayan footballer)|<U+00C1>ngel Fern<U+00E1>ndez]] for V<U+00E9>lez and [[Adolfo Pedernera]] twice for River).

In 1947, the club started to rebuild the stadium in cement, finishing the construction in 1951. On April 22 of that year, V<U+00E9>lez re inaugurated the stadium in a 2<U+2013>0 win over [[Club Atl<U+00E9>tico Hurac<U+00E1>n|Hurac<U+00E1>n]] (goals by [[Ra<U+00FA>l N<U+00E1>poli]]).

On December 6, 1968, the club inaugurated the new lighting system in a 2<U+2013>2 draw against [[Pel<U+00E9>]]'s [[Santos Futebol Clube|Santos]].

===1978 World Cup===

In 1976, the military junta led by Lieutenant General [[Jorge Rafael Videla]], who had taken power in a coup, established the Autarkic Entity World Cup '78, which was responsible for the refurbishment of the stadia designated to host the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. The Estadio Jos<U+00E9> Amalfitani was remodeled, according to the requirements of [[FIFA]], to be the secondary venue of Buenos Aires (behind River's [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti]]).

The Jos<U+00E9> Amalfitani hosted three matches of the 1978 World Cup and seven matches, including the final, of the [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship]].
