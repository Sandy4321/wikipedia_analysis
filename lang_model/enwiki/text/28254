'''Darjeeling ''' ({{IPAc-en|d|<U+0251><U+02D0>r|<U+02C8>|d<U+0292>|i<U+02D0>|l|<U+0268>|<U+014B>}}) is a town in the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]]. It is located in the [[Mahabharat Range]] or [[Lesser Himalaya]] at an average elevation of {{convert|6710|ft|1|abbr=on}}. It is noted for its [[Darjeeling tea|tea industry]] and the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Darjeeling is the headquarters of [[Darjeeling district]] which has a partially autonomous status within the state of [[West Bengal]]. 

The development of the town dates back to the mid-19th century, when the colonial British administration set up a [[sanatorium]] and a military depot. Subsequently, extensive tea plantations were established in the region, and tea growers developed hybrids of black tea and created new [[fermentation]] techniques. The resultant distinctive Darjeeling tea is internationally recognised and ranks among the most popular of the black teas.{{sfn|Srivastava|2003|p=4024}} The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway connects the town with the plains and has one of the few [[steam locomotive]]s still in service in India.

Darjeeling has several British-style [[Private school (India and Sri Lanka)|public school]]s, which attract students from India and neighbouring countries. The varied culture of the town reflects its diverse demographic milieu consisting of Nepalese, Tibetan, Bengali and other ethno-linguistic groups. Darjeeling, with its neighbouring town of [[Kalimpong]], was a centre of the [[Gorkhaland]] [[Social movement|movement]] in the 1980s. The town's fragile ecology has been threatened by a rising demand for environmental resources, stemming from growing tourist traffic and poorly planned urbanisation.

[[File:13th Dalai Lama with the King of Sikkim, Darjeeling, India, c. 1900.jpg|thumbnail|left|The 13th Dalai Lama and the King of Sikkim in Darjeeling]]

The history of Darjeeling is intertwined with that of [[Sikkim]], [[Nepal]], [[British India]] and [[Bengal]]. Until the early 19th century, the hilly area around Darjeeling was controlled by the kingdom of Sikkim, while the plains around [[Siliguri]] were intermittently occupied by the republic of Nepal,{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|pp=47<U+2013>48}} with settlement consisting of a few villages of [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] and [[Kirati people]].{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=51}} The [[Chogyal]] of Sikkim had been engaged in unsuccessful warfare against the [[Gorkhas]] of [[Nepal]]. From 1780, the Gorkhas made several attempts to capture the entire region of Darjeeling. By the beginning of 19th century, they had overrun Sikkim as far eastward as the [[Teesta River]] and had conquered and annexed the [[Terai]]. In the meantime, the [[United Kingdom|British]] were engaged in preventing the Gorkhas from overrunning the whole of the northern frontier. The [[Gurkha War|Anglo-Gorkha]] war broke out in 1814, which resulted in the defeat of the Gorkhas and subsequently led to the signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty]] in 1815. According to the treaty, Nepal had to cede all those territories which the Gorkhas had annexed from the Chogyal of Sikkim to the [[British East India Company]] (i.e. the area between [[Mechi River]] and [[Teesta River]]). Later in 1817, through the [[Treaty of Titalia]], the British East India Company reinstated the Chogyal of Sikkim, restored all the tracts of land between the Mechi River and the Teesta river to the Chogyal of Sikkim and guaranteed his sovereignty.<ref name="HistoryOfDarjeeling"/>

In 1828, a delegation of the British [[East India Company]] (BEIC) officials on its way to the Nepal-Sikkim border stayed in Darjeeling and decided that the region was a suitable site for a sanatorium for British soldiers.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=50}}{{sfn|Lamb|1986|p=69}} The company negotiated a lease of the area west of the [[Mahananda River]] from the [[Chogyal]] of Sikkim in 1835.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=47}} In 1849, the BEIC director [[Arthur Campbell (British East India Company)|Arthur Campbell]] and the explorer and botanist [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] were imprisoned in the region by the Sikkim Chogyal. The BEIC sent a force to free them. Continued friction between the BEIC and the Sikkim authorities resulted in the annexation of {{convert|640|mi2|km2}} of territory by the British in 1850. In 1864, the Bhutanese rulers and the British signed the [[Treaty of Sinchula]] that ceded the passes leading through the hills and [[Kalimpong]] to the British.<ref name="HistoryOfDarjeeling"/> Further discord between Sikkim and the British resulted in a war, culminating in the signing of a treaty and the annexation by the British of the area east of the [[Teesta River]] in 1865.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=48}} By 1866, Darjeeling district had assumed its current shape and size, covering an area of {{convert|1234|mi2|km2}}.<ref name="HistoryOfDarjeeling"/>
[[File:Darjeeling_War_Memorial,_at_Batasia_Loop,_Darjeeling,.jpg|left|thumb|Darjeeling War Memorial |alt=An obelisk on an elevated circular platform, with a few people standing around. Kangchenjunga is visible in the background.]]

During the [[British Raj]], Darjeeling's temperate climate led to its development as a [[hill station]] for British residents seeking to escape the summer heat of the plains. The development of Darjeeling as a sanatorium and health resort proceeded briskly.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=51}} Arthur Campbell, a surgeon with the Company, and [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Lieutenant Robert Napier]] were responsible for establishing a hill station there. Campbell's efforts to develop the station, attract immigrants to cultivate the slopes and stimulate trade resulted in a hundredfold increase in the population of Darjeeling between 1835 and 1849.<ref name="HistoryOfDarjeeling"/>{{sfn|Lamb|1986|p=71}} The first road connecting the town with the plains was constructed between 1839 and 1842.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=51}}{{sfn|Lamb|1986|p=71}} In 1848, a military depot was set up for British soldiers, and the town became a municipality in 1850.{{sfn|Lamb|1986|p=71}} Commercial cultivation of tea in the district began in 1856, and induced a number of British planters to settle there.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=50}} Darjeeling became the formal summer capital of the [[Bengal Presidency]] after 1864.{{sfn|Kenny|1995|p=700}} Scottish [[missionary|missionaries]] undertook the construction of schools and welfare centres for the British residents, laying the foundation for Darjeeling's notability as a centre of education. The opening of the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]] in 1881 further hastened the development of the region.<ref name="UNESCO-MountainRailways" /> In 1899, Darjeeling was rocked by major [[landslide]]s that caused severe damage to the town and the native population.{{sfn|Gerard|1990|p=258}}

Under British rule, the Darjeeling area was initially a "Non-Regulation District", a scheme of administration applicable to economically less advanced districts in the British Raj; acts and regulations of the British Raj did not automatically apply to the district in line with rest of the country. In 1919, the area was declared a "backward tract".<ref name="autonomydistrict">{{cite web | url = http://www.mcrg.ac.in/civilsocietydialogue3.htm | title = Autonomy for Darjeeling: History and Practice | accessdate = 2011-06-15 | first = Sanjoy | last = Borbara | year = 2003 | work = Experiences on Autonomy in East and North East: A Report on the Third Civil Society Dialogue on Human Rights and Peace | publisher = Mahanirban Calcutta Research Group }}</ref> During the [[Indian independence movement]], the [[Non-cooperation Movement]] spread through the tea estates of Darjeeling.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=60}} There was also a failed assassination attempt by [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionaries]] on [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|Sir John Anderson]], the [[Governor of Bengal]] in 1934.<ref name="DarjeelingHills-Independence" /> Subsequently, during the 1940s, [[Communist]] activists continued the nationalist movement against the British by mobilising the plantation workers and the peasants of the district.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=61}}
[[File:A Darjeeling street scene, 1880.jpg|thumb|Darjeeling view, 1880|alt=A hillside with houses having tiled roofs.]]

Socio-economic problems of the region that had not been addressed during British rule continued to linger and were reflected in a representation made to the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] in 1947, which highlighted the issues of regional autonomy and Nepali nationality in Darjeeling and adjacent areas.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=61}} After the [[independence of India]] in 1947, Darjeeling was merged with the state of [[West Bengal]]. A separate district of Darjeeling was established consisting of the hill towns of Darjeeling, [[Kurseong]], Kalimpong and some parts of the [[Terai]] region. While the hill population comprised mainly ethnic Nepalis who had migrated there during British rule, the plains harboured a large ethnic Bengali population who were refugees from the [[Partition of India]].{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=55}} A cautious and non-receptive response by the West Bengal government to most demands of the ethnic Nepali population led to increased calls, in the 1950s and 1960s, for Darjeeling's autonomy and for the recognition of the [[Nepali language]]; the state government acceded to the latter demand in 1961.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|pp=61<U+2013>62}}

The creation of a new state of Sikkim in 1975, along with the reluctance of the Government of India to recognise [[Nepali language|Nepali]] as an official language under the [[Constitution of India]], brought the issue of a separate state of [[Gorkhaland]] to the forefront.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=62}} Agitation for a separate state continued through the 1980s,{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|pp=63<U+2013>64}} included violent protests during the 1986<U+2013>88 period. The agitation ceased only after an agreement between the government and the [[Gorkha National Liberation Front]] (GNLF), resulting in the establishment of an elected body in 1988 called the [[Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council]] (DGHC), which received autonomy to govern the district. Though Darjeeling became peaceful, the issue of a separate state lingered, fuelled in part by the lack of comprehensive economic development in the region even after the formation of the DGHC.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=65}} New protests erupted in 2008<U+2013>09, but both the Union and State governments rejected [[Gorkha Janmukti Morcha]]'s (GJM) demand for a separate state.<ref name="NewProtest">{{cite web | url = http://www.livemint.com/2009/07/14124608/Darjeeling-protests-hit-tea-an.html | title = Darjeeling protests hit tea and tourism | work = [[Livemint]] | date = 2009-07-14 | author = Sujoy Dhar | accessdate = 2009-11-25 }}</ref> In July 2011, a pact was signed between GJM, the Government of West Bengal and the Government of India which includes the formation  of a new autonomous, elected [[Gorkhaland Territorial Administration]] (GTA), a hill council endowed with more powers than its predecessor Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council.<ref>{{cite news |title=Darjeeling tripartite pact signed for Gorkhaland Territorial Administration |author= |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Darjeeling-tripartite-pact-signed-for-Gorkhaland-Territorial-Administration/articleshow/9263963.cms |newspaper=Times of India |date=18 July 2011 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>

Darjeeling is the main town of the [[Darjeeling Sadar|Sadar]] subdivision and also the headquarters of the district. It is located at an average elevation of {{convert|6710|ft|m|abbr=on}}<ref name="DistProf" /> in the [[Darjeeling Himalayan hill region]] on the Darjeeling-Jalapahar range that originates in the south from [[Ghum, West Bengal|Ghum]]. The range is Y-shaped with the base resting at [[Katapahar]] and [[Jalapahar]] and two arms diverging north of the [[Observatory Hill, Darjeeling|Observatory Hill]]. The north-eastern arm dips suddenly and ends in the [[Lebong]] spur, while the north-western arm passes through North Point and ends in the valley near [[Tukver Tea Estate]].<ref name="urbanmanagement">{{cite web

The hills of Darjeeling are part of the [[Mahabharat Range]] or [[Lesser Himalaya]]. The soil is chiefly composed of [[sandstone]] and conglomerate formations, which are the solidified and upheaved detritus of the great range of [[Himalaya]]. However, the soil is often poorly consolidated (the permeable sediments of the region do not retain water between rains) and is not considered suitable for agriculture. The area has steep slopes and loose [[topsoil]], leading to frequent landslides during the [[monsoon]]s. According to the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], the town falls under [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone-IV]], (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing proneness to earthquakes) near the [[convergent boundary]] of the [[India Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[tectonic plate]]s and is subject to frequent earthquakes.<ref name="britannica" />

== Utilities ==
[[File:Mall Road, Darjeeling.JPG|right|thumb|Mall Road]]
Natural springs in the [[Senchal Lake|Senchal Range]] provide most of Darjeeling's water supply. Water collected is routed through stone conduits to two lakes that were constructed in 1910 and 1932, from where it is piped to the town after purification at the Jorebungalow filtration plant.<ref name="Watersupply" /> During the dry season, when water supplied by springs is insufficient, water is pumped from [[Khong Khola]], a nearby small perennial stream. There is a steadily widening gap between water supply and demand; just over 50% of the town's households are connected to the municipal water supply system.<ref name="urbanmanagement" /> Various efforts made to augment the water supply, including the construction of a third storage reservoir in 1984, have failed to yield desired results.<ref name="Watersupply" />

The town has an underground [[sewage system]], covering about 40% of the town area, that collects domestic waste and conveys it to [[septic tank]]s for disposal.<ref name="Generalinfo" /> Solid waste is disposed of in a nearby [[landfill|dumping ground]], which also houses the town's [[crematorium]].<ref name="Generalinfo" /> [[Kerbside collection|Doorstep collection]] of garbage and segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste have been implemented since 2003.{{sfn|Aftab|2005|p=186}} [[Vermicomposting]] of vegetable waste is carried out with the help of non-governmental organisations.{{sfn|Aftab|2005|p=187}} In June 2009, in order to reduce waste, the municipality proposed the ban of plastic carry bags and sachets in the town.<ref name="Dam2009-06-11" />

Darjeeling got from 1897 up to the early 1990s [[hydroelectricity]] from the nearby [[Sidrapong Hydel Power Station]], such being the first town in India supplied with hydropower. Today, electricity is supplied by the [[West Bengal State Electricity Board]] from other places. The town often suffers from power outages and the electrical supply voltage is unstable, making [[voltage stabiliser]]s popular with many households. Almost all of the primary schools are now maintained by Darjeeling Gorkha Autonomous Hill Council. The total length of all types of roads within the municipal area is around {{convert|134|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Roads" /> The [[West Bengal Fire Service]] provides emergency services for the town.

== Economy ==
[[File:Darjeelingteagardens.jpg|thumb|right|Plucking the tea leaves in the traditional fashion]]
The two most significant contributors to Darjeeling's economy are tourism and the tea industry. [[Darjeeling tea]], due to the unique agro-climatic conditions of Darjeeling, has a distinctive natural flavour, is internationally reputed and recognised as a geographical indicator.{{sfn|Srivastava|2003|p=4024}} Darjeeling produces 7% of India's tea output, approximately {{convert|9000000|kg|lb}} every year.<ref name="NewProtest" /> The tea industry has faced competition in recent years from tea produced in other parts of India as well as other countries like Nepal.<ref name="BBC2001-07-27" /> Widespread concerns about labour disputes, worker layoffs and closing of estates have affected investment and production.<ref name="Haber2004-01-14" /> Several tea estates are being run on a workers' [[cooperative]] model, while others are being planned for conversion into tourist resorts.<ref name="Haber2004-01-14" /> More than 60% of workers in the tea gardens are women.<ref name="census1" /> Besides tea, the most widely cultivated crops include [[maize]], [[millets]], [[rice|paddy]], [[cardamom]], [[potato]] and [[ginger]].<ref name="Agriculture" />

Darjeeling had become an important tourist destination as early as 1860.{{sfn|Lamb|1986|p=71}} It is reported to be the only location in eastern India that witnesses large numbers of foreign tourists.<ref name="NewProtest" /> It is also a popular filming destination for [[Bollywood]] and [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali cinema]]. [[Satyajit Ray]] shot his film ''[[Kanchenjungha]]'' (1962) here, and his [[Feluda]] series story, ''Darjeeling Jomjomaat'' was also set in the town. Bollywood movies ''[[Aradhana (1969 film)|Aradhana]]'' (1969), ''[[Main Hoon Na]]'' (2004), and more recently ''[[Barfi!]]'' (2012) have been filmed here.<ref name="aradhana1">{{cite web

Darjeeling has seen a significant growth in its population, its decadal growth rate being 47% between 1991 and 2001.<ref name=census1/> The colonial town had been designed for a population of only 10,000, and subsequent growth has created extensive infrastructural and environmental problems.  The district's forests and other natural wealth have been adversely affected by an ever-growing population. Environmental degradation, including denudation of the surrounding hills has adversely affected Darjeeling's appeal as a tourist destination.<ref name=teri/>
