[[Lieutenant Colonel]] '''Alexandre Banza''' (1932&nbsp;<U+2013> 12 April 1969) was a [[Central African Republic|Central African]] military officer and politician. Born in [[Carnot, Central African Republic|Carnot]], [[Central African Republic]], Banza served with the [[French Army]] during the [[First Indochina War]] before joining the [[Military of the Central African Republic|Central African Republic armed forces]]. As commander of the Camp Kassa<U+00EF> military base in 1965, Banza helped [[Jean-B<U+00E9>del Bokassa]] [[Saint-Sylvestre coup d'<U+00E9>tat|overthrow]] the government of President [[David Dacko]]. Bokassa rewarded Banza by appointing him as minister of state and minister of finance in the new government. Banza quickly established the new regime's reputation abroad and forged diplomatic relations with other countries. In 1967, Bokassa and his [[mentorship|prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>]] had a major argument over the president's excessive extravagances. In April 1968, Bokassa removed Banza as minister of finance. Recognizing Bokassa's attempts to undermine him, Banza made a number of remarks highly critical of the president's handling of the government. Bokassa responded by abolishing the minister of state position.

Banza soon decided to stage a [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]. He confided in a few military officers, who he hoped would support his attempt to gain power. One of his confidants, Jean-Claude Mandaba, contacted the president and informed him of the date of the coup, 9 April 1969. Hours before he was going to execute his bid for power, Banza was ambushed by Mandaba and taken directly to Bokassa. Bokassa nearly beat Banza to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake. On 12 April, Banza presented his case to a [[military tribunal]], which quickly sentenced him to [[execution by firing squad|death by firing squad]]. He was reportedly taken to an open field, where he was executed and buried in an unmarked grave. Alternate circumstances of Banza's death have been reported in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Le Monde]]''. In the aftermath of the failed coup, Banza's family, mistress and close associates were all arrested and either sent to jail or deported. With Banza eliminated, Bokassa spent extravagantly and surrounded himself with adulators.<ref name="Titley44">{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=44}}.</ref>

==Early life and military career==
Banza was born the first of three sons in [[Carnot, Central African Republic|Carnot]], [[Central African Republic]], in the heart of [[Gbaya people|Gbaya]] territory.<ref name="Kalck19">{{Harvnb|Kalck|2005|p=19}}.</ref> In his twenties, he had served with the [[French army]] in the [[First Indochina War]] and had been stationed in [[Gabon]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]] and other locations in colonial Africa.<ref name="Titley26">{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=26}}.</ref> He had a similar military record to his future colleague [[Jean-B<U+00E9>del Bokassa]], who had also served in the First Indochina War and had been stationed in Africa and Europe as a [[transmission (telecommunications)|radio transmissions]] expert.<ref>{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|pp=9<U+2013>10}}.</ref> Afterward, Banza returned to the Central African Republic, where he enlisted in the [[Military of the Central African Republic|armed forces]]. Brian Titley, author of ''Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa'' described Banza as an "intelligent, ambitious, and unscrupulous" military officer.<ref name="Titleyp26">{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=26}}</ref>

===Background===
[[Central African Republic]] [[List of heads of state of the Central African Republic and Central African Empire|President]] [[David Dacko]], Bokassa's cousin, took over the country in 1960,<ref>{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=20}}.</ref> after winning a power struggle against [[Abel Goumba]]. Bokassa left the French army to join the Central African Republic army in 1962.<ref>{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=23}}.</ref> By 1965, the country was in turmoil<U+2014>plagued by corruption and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels from neighboring countries.<ref name="Titley25">{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=25}}.</ref> Dacko obtained financial aid from the [[People's Republic of China]], but in spite of this support, the country's problems persisted.<ref name="Titley25"/> Bokassa, now [[commander-in-chief]] of the army, made plans to take over the government; Dacko became aware of this, and countered by forming a [[gendarmerie]] headed by police chief [[Jean Izamo]], who quickly became Dacko's closest adviser.<ref>{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=24}}.</ref>

Tensions between Dacko and Bokassa increased. In December 1965, Dacko approved a budget increase for Izamo's gendarmerie, but rejected the budget proposal for Bokassa's army.<ref name="Titleyp26"/> At this point, Bokassa told friends he was annoyed by Dacko's treatment and was "going for a coup d'<U+00E9>tat".<ref name="Pean15">{{Harvnb|P<U+00E9>an|1977|p=15}}.</ref> Dacko planned to replace Bokassa with Izamo as his personal military adviser, and wanted to promote army officers loyal to the government, while demoting Bokassa and his close associates.<ref name="Titleyp26"/> Bokassa realized he had to act against Dacko quickly, and worried that his 500-man army would be no match for the gendarmerie and the presidential guard.<ref name="Titleyp26"/> He was also concerned the French would intervene to aid Dacko, as had occurred after the 23 February 1964 [[1964 Gabon coup d<U+2019><U+00E9>tat|coup d<U+2019><U+00E9>tat]] in [[Gabon]] against President [[L<U+00E9>on M'ba]].<ref name="Titleyp26"/> After receiving word of the coup from the country's military chief of staff, [[Omar Bongo|Albert-Bernard Bongo]], officials in Paris sent [[paratrooper]]s to Gabon and restored M'ba to power in a matter of hours.<ref name="uiuc">{{citation|url=http://www.acdis.uiuc.edu/Research/OPs/Pederson/html/contents/sect6.html|title=French Intervention in the 1964 Coup In Gabon|last=Pederson|first=Nicholas|date=May 2000|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] |accessdate=2008-08-07}}.</ref> Banza, who was then commander of the [[Camp Kassa<U+00EF> military base]] in northeast Bangui, offered Bokassa his support and persuaded the still-worried commander-in-chief to carry out the coup.<ref name="Titleyp26"/> He helped Bokassa lay out the plans for the coup, proposed to take place on 31 December 1965.

===Execution of the coup===
[[Image:Central african republic sm04.png|thumb|left|The capital [[Bangui]], represented with a star in the map, was the site of the coup.]]
Early in the evening of 31 December 1965, Dacko left the Palais de la Renaissance to visit one of his minister's plantations southwest of the capital.<ref name="Titleyp26"/> At 22:30&nbsp;[[West Africa Time|WAT]] ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] 21:30), Captain Banza gave orders to his officers to begin the coup; one of his subordinates was to subdue the security guard in the presidential palace, while the other was to take control of Radio-Bangui to prevent communication between Dacko and his followers.<ref name="Titleyp27">{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=27}}.</ref> Bokassa called Izamo at his headquarters, asking him to come to Camp de Roux to sign some papers that needed his immediate attention. Izamo, who was at a [[New Year's Eve]] celebration with friends, reluctantly agreed and traveled in his wife's car to the camp. Upon arrival, he was confronted by Banza and Bokassa, who informed him of the coup in progress. After announcing his refusal to support the coup, Izamo was overpowered and locked in a [[cellar]].<ref name="Titleyp27"/>

Shortly after midnight, in the first minutes of 1 January 1966, Bokassa and Banza organized their troops and told them of their plan to take over the government. Bokassa claimed that Dacko had [[resignation|resigned from the presidency]] and given the position to his close adviser Izamo. He then told the soldiers that they had to act now to prevent the gendarmerie from taking over the Central African Republic army. He then asked the soldiers if they would support his course of action; the men who refused were thrown in jail. At 00:30&nbsp;WAT, Banza, Bokassa and their supporters left Camp de Roux to take over the capital.<ref name="Titleyp27"/> They encountered little resistance and were able to take Bangui in a matter of hours. Bokassa and Banza then rushed to the Palais de la Renaissance, where they tried to arrest Dacko, who was not there. Bokassa began to panic, as he believed the president had been warned of the coup in advance, and immediately ordered his soldiers to search for Dacko in the countryside until he was found.<ref name="Titleyp27"/>

Dacko was not aware of the events taking place in the capital. After leaving his minister's plantation near midnight, he headed to Simon Samba's house to ask the [[Aka (Pygmy tribe)|Aka Pgymy]] leader to conduct a year-end ritual. After an hour at Samba's house, he was informed of the coup in Bangui. He was arrested by a few of Bokassa's men as he entered P<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>vo Junction, on the western border of the capital. Dacko was escorted to the presidential palace, where Bokassa hugged the president and told him, "I tried to warn you<U+2014>but now it's too late". President Dacko was then taken to Ngaragba Prison in east Bangui at around 02:00&nbsp;WAT. In a move that he thought would boost his popularity in the country, Bokassa ordered prison director Otto Sacher to release all prisoners in the jail. Bokassa then took Dacko to Camp Kassa<U+00EF> at 03:20&nbsp;WAT, where the president was forced by Banza to resign from office. Banza wanted to kill Dacko, but Bokassa would not allow it, believing that Dacko had not yet outlived his usefulness. Later, Bokassa's officers announced on Radio-Bangui that the Dacko government had been toppled and Bokassa had taken over control.<ref>{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=28}}.</ref> Meanwhile, Banza took over administrative centers, where politicians, diplomats and other high-level officials were celebrating the coming of the [[New Year]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kalck|2005|p=172}}.</ref>

==Minister in the Bokassa government==
Banza was appointed [[minister of finance]] and [[minister of state]] in the new government. The regime first secured diplomatic recognition from President [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Tombalbaye]] of neighboring [[Chad]], who Bokassa met in [[Bouca]], [[Ouham]]. After Bokassa reciprocated by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966 along the southern border of Chad at [[Sarh|Fort Archambault]], the two decided to help one another if either was in danger of losing power.<ref name="Titleyp30">{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=30}}.</ref> Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize the new government. At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials to convince them that the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]] on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support.<ref name="Titleyp30"/> After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the franc monetary zone, French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] decided to make an official visit to the Central African Republic on 17 November 1966. To the new government, this visit meant that the French had accepted the new changes in the country.<ref name="Titleyp30"/>

As a minister of finance, Banza directed much of his energy and time into lifting the country out of [[bankruptcy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=34}}.</ref> Banza was also successful in his efforts to build the government's reputation abroad, all the while establishing himself as a respected and well-liked leader. Many believed that the natural-born leader would not remain as Bokassa's right-hand man for much longer.<ref name="Titley41">{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=41}}.</ref> After Banza was promoted from [[Captain (Land)|Captain]] to [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in 1965,<ref>{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=36}}.</ref> Bokassa realized that his greatest political threat wasn't from the remaining group of Dacko supporters, but from Banza himself.<ref name="Titley41"/>

Two years later, the two had a major argument over the country's budget, as Banza adamantly opposed Bokassa's extravagant spending. Bokassa moved to Camp de Roux, where he felt he could safely run the government without having to worry about Banza's thirst for power.<ref name="Titley41"/> In the meantime, Banza tried to obtain a support base within the army, spending much of his time in the company of soldiers. Bokassa recognized what his minister was doing, so he sent military units most sympathetic to Banza to the country's border and brought his own army supporters as close to the capital as possible. In September 1967, he took a special trip to Paris, where he asked for protection from French troops. Two months later, the government deployed 80 paratroopers to Bangui.<ref name="Titley41"/>

On 13 April 1968, in another one of his frequent cabinet reshuffles, Bokassa demoted Banza to minister of health, but let him remain in his position as minister of state. Cognizant of the president's intentions, Banza increased his vocalization of dissenting political views.<ref name="Titley42"/> A year later, after Banza made a number of remarks highly critical of Bokassa and his management of the economy, the president, perceiving an immediate threat to his power, removed him as his minister of state.<ref name="Titley42">{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=42}}.</ref>

===1969 coup plot===
Banza revealed his intention to stage a coup to Lieutenant Jean-Claude Mandaba, the commanding officer of Camp Kassa<U+00EF>, who he looked to for support. Mandaba went along with the plan, but his allegiance remained with Bokassa.<ref name="Titley42"/> When Banza contacted his co-conspirators on 8 April 1969, informing them that they would execute the coup the following day, Mandaba immediately phoned Bokassa and informed him of the plan. When Banza entered Camp Kassa<U+00EF> on 9 April 1969, he was ambushed by Mandaba and his soldiers. The men had to break Banza's arms before they could overpower and throw him into the trunk of a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] and take him directly to Bokassa.<ref name="Titley42"/> At his house in Berengo, Bokassa nearly beat Banza to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake.<ref name="Titley43"/>

On 12 April, Banza presented his case before a [[military tribunal]] at Camp de Roux, where he admitted to his plan, but stated that he had not planned to kill Bokassa.<ref>{{citation|last=|first=|title=Central Africans Execute Official|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 April 1969|accessdate=2008-08-05|page=p. 20}}.</ref> He was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by [[execution by firing squad|firing squad]], taken to an open field behind Camp Kassa<U+00EF>, executed and buried in an [[unmarked grave]].<ref name="Titley43">{{Harvnb|Titley|1997|p=43}}.</ref> The circumstances of Banza's death have been disputed. The American newsmagazine, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', reported that Banza "was dragged before a Cabinet meeting where Bokassa slashed him with a razor. Guards then beat Banza until his back was broken, dragged him through the streets of Bangui and finally shot him."<ref name="Time">{{citation|last=|first=|title=Lord High Everything|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944776,00.html?promoid=googlep|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=4 May 1974|accessdate=2008-08-04}}.</ref> The French daily evening newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' reported that Banza was killed in circumstances "so revolting that it still makes one's flesh creep":
{{quote|Two versions concerning the end circumstances of his death differ on one minor detail. Did Bokassa tie him to a pillar before personally carving him with a knife that he had previously used for stirring his coffee in the gold-and-midnight blue S<U+00E8>vres coffee set, or was the murder committed on the cabinet table with the help of other persons? Late that afternoon, soldiers dragged a still identifiable corpse, with the spinal column smashed, from barrack to barrack to serve as an example.<ref>{{citation|last=Powers|first=Jonathan|title=Like Water on Stone: The Story of Amnesty International|year=2001|publisher=Northeastern University Press|location=[[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]|isbn=1-55553-487-2|oclc=45845483|page=88}}.</ref>}}

==Aftermath of coup==

A few days later, Bokassa had Banza's wife and their nine children arrested and [[deportation|deported]] to [[Berb<U+00E9>rati]] and then [[Birao]].<ref name="Kalck19"/> They were released on 6 May 1971. Banza's mistress, Julienne Kombo, who entered the Palais de la Renaissance crying hysterically after her lover's death, was arrested and jailed until 24 June 1972.<ref name="Titley43"/> Banza's father was sent to jail, where he died of hunger and exhaustion on 24 April 1970. Banza's two younger brothers, Beuoane and Gouboulo, were dismissed from the gendarmerie in July and sent to Ngaragba Prison. In August 1971, they were taken from the prison, never to be seen again.<ref name="Titley43"/>

Bokassa also hunted down Banza's close associates, such as Joseph Kallot, Faustin Marigot and Polycarpe Gbaguili. Kallot and Marigot died in prison in June 1969 and April 1971, respectively. With the exception of Gbaguili, who remained in prison until the downfall of the Bokassa regime on 20 September 1979, the other associates were released months after their arrest. Gbaguili served as a witness in Bokassa's criminal trials for [[treason]], [[murder]], [[cannibalism]] and [[embezzlement]] during the 1980s, explaining in detail the numerous crimes and human rights violations the former dictator had completed.<ref name="Kalck19"/>

By eliminating his dangerous rival, Bokassa demonstrated his ability to deal ruthlessly with dissidents and political opponents. He started to rule more arbitrarily after the Banza affair, giving himself control of various ministerial positions and the army.<ref name="Titley44"/> In one instance, he promoted [[Second Lieutenant]] [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Boziz<U+00E9>]], the future president of the Central African Republic, to [[General officer|General]] after he beat a Frenchman who had disrespected the president. According to Brian Titley, author of ''Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa'', he surrounded himself with "sycophants, who were all too willing to nurture his growing [[megalomania|delusions of grandeur]]"; with no one to stop him, he also spent money with reckless abandon.<ref name="Titley44"/>
