:''This article is about those who fit the definition of "antipope" in the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]'', 1998 CD-ROM edition: "in the Roman Catholic church, one who opposes the legitimately elected bishop of Rome, endeavours to secure the papal throne, and to some degree succeeds materially in the attempt." For information on other claimants to be Pope, see the article [[Sedevacantist antipope]], which also treats of [[Discordianism]].''

An '''antipope''' is one who, in opposition to the generally recognized [[Pope]], makes a widely accepted claim to be the lawful Pope. In several cases, it is hard to tell which was in fact the lawful Pope and which the antipope. In its list of the Popes, the [[Holy See]]'s annual directory, ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', attaches to the name of [[Pope Leo VIII]] (963-965) the following note: "At this point, as again in the mid-eleventh century, we come across elections in which problems of harmonizing historical criteria and those of theology and canon law make it impossible to decide clearly which side possessed the legitimacy whose factual existence guarantees the unbroken lawful succession of the Successors of Saint Peter. The uncertainty that in some cases results has made it advisable to abandon the assignation of successive numbers in the list of the Popes." In all those cases, it is, however, clear that, whichever was the Pope, the other was an antipope, since the claim of each was in fact widely accepted.

==History==
The earliest antipope, [[Antipope Hippolytus|Hippolytus]], was elected in protest against [[Pope Callixtus I]] by a schismatic group in the city of [[Rome]] in the [[3rd century]]. Hippolytus was [[exile]]d to the mines on the island of [[Sardinia]] in the company of Callixtus' successor [[Pope Pontian]], was reconciled to the Catholic Church before his death, and has been [[canonization|canonized]] by the Church. The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] also mentions a Natalius[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10448a.htm], before Hippolytus, as first antipope, who, according to Eusebius's EH5.28.8-12, quoting the ''Little Labyrinth'' of Hippolytus, after being "[[Scourge|scourged]] all night by the holy angels", covered in ash, dressed in [[sackcloth]], and "after some difficulty", tearfully submitted to [[Pope Zephyrinus]].

The period when antipopes were most numerous was during the struggles between the Popes and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s of the [[11th century|11th]] and [[12th century|12th centuries]]. The emperors frequently imposed their own nominees, in order to further their cause. (The popes, likewise, sometimes sponsored rival imperial claimants in [[Germany]] in order to overcome a particular emperor.)

The Great [[Western Schism]], which, on the grounds of the allegedly invalid election of [[Pope Urban VI]], began in 1378 with the election of [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]], who took up residence in [[Avignon]], [[France]], led to two, and eventually three, rival lines of claimants to papacy: the Roman line, the Avignon line, and the Pisan line. The last-mentioned line was named after the town of [[Pisa]], [[Italy]], where the council that elected [[Pope Alexander V|Alexander V]] as a third claimant was held. To end the schism,  the [[Council of Constance]] deposed, in May 1415, [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] of the Pisan line, whose claim to legitimacy was based on a council's choice, [[Pope Gregory XII]] of the Roman line resigned in July 1415, and the Council formally deposed [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] of the [[Avignon ]]line, who refused to resign, in July [[1417]], after which [[Pope Martin V]] was elected and was accepted everywhere except in the small and rapidly diminishing area that remained faithful to [[Avignon Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]].

The scandal of multiple claimants added to the demands for reform that produced the [[Protestant Reformation]] at the turn of the [[16th century]].
