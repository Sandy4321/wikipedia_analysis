}}'''Moses Isserles''', also spelled Moshe Isserlis, (1520 - May 11, 1572<ref>Goldin, Hyman E. ''[[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]] - Code of Jewish Law'', Forward to the New Edition. (New York: Hebrew Publishing Company, 1961)</ref>),  was an eminent [[Ashkenazi]]c [[rabbi]], [[talmud]]ist, and ''[[posek]]'', renowned  for his fundamental work of ''[[Halakha]]'' (Jewish law), entitled ''ha-Mapah'' (lit., "the tablecloth"), an inline commentary on the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' (lit. "the set table"), upon which his "great reputation as a halakist and codifier rests chiefly."<ref>Myer S. Lew, The Jews of Poland: Their Economic, Social and Communal Life in the Sixteenth Century as reflected in the Works of Rabbi Moses Isserls (London: Edward Goldston, 1944), 68.</ref> He is also well known for his ''Darkhei Moshe'' commentary on the ''[[Arba'ah Turim|Tur]]''. Isserles is also referred to as the '''Rema''', (or Remo, Rama) ('''{{lang|he|<U+05E8><U+05DE><U+05F4><U+05D0>}}'''), the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[acronym]] for Rabbi Moses Isserles.

==Biography==
Isserles was born in [[Krak<U+00F3>w|Krak<U+00F3>w, Poland]]. His father, Israel (known as Isserl), was a prominent [[talmud]]ist, said to have been independently wealthy, and probably headed the community; his grandfather, Jehiel Luria, was the first rabbi of [[Brest, Belarus|Brisk]]. (In an era which preceded the common use of [[surname]]s, Moses became known by his [[patronymic]], Isserles.) He studied in [[Lublin]] under Rabbi [[Shalom Shachna]], who became his father-in-law; among his fellow pupils were his relative [[Solomon Luria]] (Maharshal), and Chayyim b. Bezalel, an older brother of the [[Maharal]]. Rema<U+2019>s wife died young, at the age of 20 and he later established the "[[Rema Synagogue]]" in Krak<U+00F3>w in her memory (originally his house, built by his father in his honor&mdash;which he gave to the community). He later married the sister of [[Joseph ben Mordechai Gershon]] Ha-Kohen.

He returned to Krak<U+00F3>w about 1550, when he established a large ''[[yeshiva]]'' and, being a wealthy man, supported his pupils at his own cost. In his teaching, he was opposed to [[pilpul]] and he emphasized simple interpretation of the [[Talmud]]. In 1553 he was appointed as [[dayan]]; he also served on the [[Council of the Four Lands]].  He became a world-renowned scholar and was approached by many other well-known rabbis, including [[Yosef Karo]], for Halachic decisions. He was one of the greatest Jewish scholars of [[Poland]], and was the primary [[posek|halakhic authority]] for [[Ashkenazi|European Jewry]] of his day.  He died in Krak<U+00F3>w and was buried next to his synagogue.  On his tombstone is inscribed: "From Moses ([[Maimonides]]) to Moses (Isserles) there was none like [[Moses]]". Until the [[Second World War]], thousands of pilgrims visited his grave annually on [[Lag Ba'omer]], his ''[[Yahrzeit]]'' (date of death).
{{Eras of the Halakha}}
Not only was Isserles a renowned Talmudic and [[halakha|legal scholar]], he was also learned in [[Kabbalah]], and studied  [[history]], [[astronomy]] and [[philosophy]]. He taught that <U+201C>the aim of man is to search for the cause and the meaning of things<U+201D> ("Torath ha-Olah" III., vii.). He also held that "it is permissible to now and then study secular wisdom, provided that this excludes works of heresy... and that one [first] knows what is permissible and forbidden, and the [[halakha|rules]] and the [[mitzva|mitzvot]]" ([[Shulkhan Aruch]], [[Yoreh De'ah]], 246, 4). [[Maharshal]] reproached him for having based some of his decisions on [[Aristotle]]. His reply was that he studied [[Greek philosophy]] only from [[Maimonides]]<U+2019> ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', and then only on [[Shabbat]] and [[Yom Tov]] (holy days) -  and furthermore, it is better to occupy oneself with philosophy than to err through [[Kabbalah]] ([[Responsa]] No. 7).

Rabbi Isserles had several children: "Drezil (named after his maternal grandmother), wife of R. Bunem Meizlish.  A daughter whose name is unknown to us....  A son, R. Yehuda....  A third daughter...who is totally unknown to us."<ref>Rabbi Asher Siev, "The Period, Life and Work of Rabbi Moses Isserles<U+201D> (PhD. Diss., Yeshiva University, 1943), 16-17.</ref>  Amongst his many notable descendants are the composers [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], and the statistician [[Leon Isserlis]]. He is buried in the eponymous [[Remuh Cemetery]] in Krak<U+00F3>w.

==Approach==

Isserles is perhaps best known for his halakhic works, chief among them his notes to the [[Shulchan Aruch]] by [[Yosef Karo]].  One of the things for which Rabbi Isserles is best known for is his approach to customs (minhagim): "it should be remembered that R. Isserles did not regard lightly a Jewish Minhag.  On the contrary, he too expressed reverence and respect for it, and whenever possible endeavored to uphold it and also to explain its origin.  Only, unlike many great Talmudic scholars, he refused to follow it blindly.  When convinced of the unsound basis of a Minhag, he was ready to repudiate it regardless of its acceptance by the people."<ref>Rabbi Asher Siev, "The Period, Life and Work of Rabbi Moses Isserles<U+201D> (PhD. Diss., Yeshiva University, 1943), 77.</ref>

Furthermore: "The Talmud is, of course, the great reservoir to which R. Isserles turns as the first step in attempting to solve a problem. The question at hand is immediately referred to an identical or similar case in the Talmud. The second step is the weighing of the opinions of the <U+05E8><U+05D0><U+05E9><U+05D5><U+05E0><U+05D9><U+05DD>, i.e. [[Isaac Alfasi|Alfasi]] (<U+05E8><U+05D9><U+201D><U+05E3>), [[Tosafist]]s, [[Nachmanides]], etc. expanding and explaining the text. The opinion of the majority is followed by R. Isserles and even Maimonides, whom he respected very highly, is disregarded if he was in the minority. After the Risonim, R. Isserles proceeds to examine writings of <U+05D0><U+05D7><U+05E8><U+05D5><U+05E0><U+05D9><U+05DD>, i.e. [[The Mordechai|Mordechai]], [[Chaim Yechiel Ashri|Ashri]] and [[Arba'ah Turim|Tur]], and the latter is followed especially when the Tosafists agree with him. At this point, the Responsa of still later authorities are cited extensively in accordance with the well-established priniciple of <U+05D4><U+05DC><U+05DB><U+05D4> <U+05DB><U+05D1><U+05EA><U+05E8><U+05D0>, paying due attention even to the opinions of contemporaries and to customs of Polish Jewry which the <U+05D1><U+201D><U+05D9> omitted. Thus, Isserles, in his responsa as well as in the <U+05D3><U+201D><U+05DE> and his commentary on the Shulchan Aruch, served as a supplement and offered his community the code of Law adjusted to its authorities, customs, and needs. He spread the <U+201C>cloth<U+201D> over the table prepared by his contemporary, the <U+05D1><U+201D><U+05D9>."<ref>Rabbi Asher Siev, "The Period, Life and Work of Rabbi Moses Isserles<U+201D> (PhD. Diss., Yeshiva University, 1943), 57-58.</ref>

==Works==

'''''Darkhei Moshe''''' (<U+05D3><U+05E8><U+05DB><U+05D9> <U+05DE><U+05E9><U+05D4>) is a commentary on the ''[[Arba'ah Turim|Tur]]'' as well as on the ''[[Shulkhan Aruch#Beth Yosef|Beth Yosef]]'', which is Yosef Karo's commentary on the ''Tur'' and the work underlying the ''Shulkhan Aruch''. Isserles had originally intended the ''Darkhei Moshe'' to serve as a basis for subsequent ''halakhic'' decisions. As such, in this work he evaluates the rulings of the ''Tur'' - which was widely accepted among the [[Ashkenazi]]m and [[Sephardi]]m - comparing these with rulings of other [[posek|''halakhic'' authorities]]. The ''Beth Yosef'' was published while Isserles was at work on the ''Darkhei Moshe''. Recognizing that Karo's commentary largely met his objectives, Isserles published the ''Darkhei Moshe'' in a modified form. "In publishing the <U+05D3><U+05E8><U+05DB><U+05D9> <U+05DE><U+05E9><U+05D4>, R. Isserles rendered a great service to Ashkenazic Jewry, for he reestablished its Talmudic authorities as the deciding factor in determining a law."<ref>Rabbi Asher Siev, "The Period, Life and Work of Rabbi Moses Isserles<U+201D> (PhD. Diss., Yeshiva University, 1943), 63.</ref>  An abridgement of the original work is published with the ''Tur''; the complete version of the ''Darkhei Moshe'' is published separately. 

'''''HaMapah''''' (<U+05D4><U+05DE><U+05E4><U+05D4>) is written as a [[gloss]] to the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' of [[Yosef Karo]], discussing cases where [[Sephardi]] and [[Ashkenazi]] customs differ.  (Hamapah is the "tablecloth" for the ''Shulkhan Aruch'', the "set table".) Karo had based his [[posek|normative positions]] on three authorities: [[Maimonides]], [[Asher ben Jehiel]] (the Rosh), and [[Isaac Alfasi]] (the Rif). Of these, only Asher ben Jehiel had non-[[Sephardic]] roots, having lived most of his life in [[Germany]] before moving to [[Spain]], but even so, his work is largely Sephardic in orientation. Isserles thus created a series of [[gloss]]es, in which he supplemented Karo with material drawn from the laws and customs ([[minhag|''Minhagim'']]) of [[Ashkenazi]] Jewry - chiefly based on the works of  [[Yaakov Moelin]], [[Israel Isserlein]] and [[Israel Bruna]]. All editions of the ''Shulchan Aruch'' since 1578 include ''HaMapah'' embedded in the text (introduced by <U+05D4><U+05D2><U+05D4> ''Hagahah'', "gloss"), and distinguished by a semi-cursive "[[Rashi#.22Rashi_script.22|Rashi script]]". Rabbi Isserles' HaMapah was "considered to be an interpretation and supplement to Karo<U+2019>s work, while also challenging its claim to universal authority by introducing Ashkenazic traditions and customs that differed from the Sephardic ones. Rather than challenge the status of the Shulhan <U+2018>Arukh, however, Isserles established the status of the Shulhan <U+2018>Arukh as the authoritative text. In most of the editions since 1574, the Shulhan <U+2018>Arukh was printed with Ha-Mappah, thus creating an interesting tension that was realized on the printed page. It was an act of integrating the Sephardic tradition and its accommodation into the Ashkenazi world, the confirmation of the authority and its undermining appearing on the same page."<ref>Amnon Raz-Krozkin, <U+201C>From Safed to Venice: The Shulhan <U+2018>Arukh and the Censor<U+201D> in Tradition, Heterodoxy and Religious Culture: Judaism and Christianity in the Early Modern Period, eds. Chanita Goodblatt and Howard Kreisel (Be<U+2019>er Sheva, Israel: Ben Gurion University of the Negev Press, 2006), 98.</ref>  
The citations "indicating the sources in earlier authorities of the decisions in the annotations to the Shulchan Aruch, were not placed by R. Isserles.  This may be seen from the fact that many times wrong references are given.  An anonymous scholar placed them at the end of each comment and gradually they have been mistaken as being indications of the author himself."<ref>Rabbi Asher Siev, "The Period, Life and Work of Rabbi Moses Isserles<U+201D> (PhD. Diss., Yeshiva University, 1943), 45.</ref>
Rabbi Isserles' weaving "his comments into the main text as glosses, indicates <U+2013> besides upholding the traditional Ashkenazi attitude to a text <U+2013> that the work itself, meant to serve as a textbook for laymen, had been accepted in Rema<U+2019>s yeshivah at Krakow as a students<U+2019> reference book. Instead of the Arba<U+2018>ah Turim, the main text for the study of posekim in the Ashkenazi yeshivah up to Rema<U+2019>s day, he chose to use the new book, which was free of accumulated layers of glosses and emendations, up-to-date and lucid, and arranged along the same lines as the old Turim so that it could easily be introduced into the yeshivah curriculum. This was the crucial step in altering the canonical status of the Shulhan Arukh."<ref>Elchanan Reiner, <U+201C>The Ashkenazi <U+00C9>lite at the Beginning of the Modern Era: Manuscript versus Printed Book,<U+201D> Polin 10 (1997), 97.</ref>
Today, "''Shulchan Aruch''" refers to the combined work of Karo and Isserles. This consolidation of the two works strengthened the underlying unity of the [[Sephardi]] and [[Ashkenazi]] communities. It is through this unification that the ''Shulkhan Aruch'' became the universally accepted [[Halakha#Codes of Jewish law|Code of Law]] for the entire [[Jewish people]].

Rabbi Isserles also wrote:
*''Torath ha-Chatath'', mainly on ''[[kashrut]]'' (the dietary laws);
*''Torath ha-Olah'' and ''Mechir Yayin'' (on the Book of Esther), both philosophical;
*''Teshuvot Rema'', a work of [[responsa]] - see [[History_of_Responsa#Sixteenth_century|History of Responsa: Sixteenth century]].
