'''''Red Tail Reborn''''' is a 2007 historical documentary film by Adam White about the [[Commemorative Air Force]]'s [[Red Tail Project]].  The project involves the restoration, exhibition and maintenance of a [[World War II]] [[P-51 Mustang]] flown by the [[United States Air Force]] [[332d Fighter Group]].  The exhibition of this plane is considered to be a traveling and flying tribute to the [[Tuskegee Airmen]].  The film was initially broadcast and released on [[DVD]] in the director's home state of Ohio, winning local [[Emmy Award]] recognition.  Eventually, it was broadcast nationally on [[Public Broadcasting Services]] (PBS) stations. In addition to increasing awareness of the travails of the Tuskegee Airmen, this film served to highlight the Red Tail Project fundraising effort to rebuild the plane after a 2004 crash.  The film had a sequel called ''[[Flight of the Red Tail]]''.

''Red Tail Reborn'' is described by [[Allmovie]] as "... the story of the brave African-American pilots who risked their lives in order to ensure that peace prevailed, and the people who have dedicated their lives to ensure that they are not forgotten."<ref name=RTRAM/> It tells three stories in one: the story of the Tuskegee Airmen, the history of the Red Tail Mustangs they flew (one of which is the subject of the restoration efforts) and the story of the late Don Hinz who crashed the first restored Mustang in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:DNWB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=12C60A2E440AF920&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=<U+2018>Red Tail Reborn<U+2019> to air on PBS Feb. 14|accessdate=2010-01-25|date=2008-02-12|work=[[The Daily News (North Dakota)|The Daily News]]|author=Hevern, Erin C.}}</ref>

The film even presents government documents deriding black men as substandard and "cowards". It describes segregation endured by the black military officers, and it describes how these pilots distinguished themselves with their record.<ref name=SoTAtaoP/>

==History and production==
Several of the Tuskegee Airmen were from the northeast Ohio region.  Among those that Cleveland filmmaker White interviewed to make the film were 13 of the Tuskegee airmen.<ref name=SoTAtaoP>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:RCOC&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=1249C9E31EB73860&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Story of Tuskegee Airmen to air on PBS|accessdate=2010-01-01|date=2008-02-05|work=[[The Repository]]|author=Goshay, Charita M.}}</ref>  One of these veterans interviewed was WWII, [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]] veteran Col.

The film was inspired while White was filming ''[[The Restorers]]'', after a [[P-51 Mustang|P-51C Mustang]] landed for refueling and White met Doug Rozendaal, the pilot of the Red Tail Project's ''Tuskegee Airmen'' plane.  When White heard Don Hinz had been killed in a crash of that very same plane, he felt compelled to do a story focusing on it. Once he got involved in the project, a local PBS station committed to airing the final product, which was an early step in the successful development of the project.  When researching the film he noticed a lack of resources about the Tuskegee Airmen and felt driven to fill the void.<ref name=RTRPBS/>

The DVD release includes a second disc with four hours of additional interviews, deleted scenes, and productions stills. A reviewer from ''[[Flight Journal]]'', feels the DVD package will connect with an audience of actual and aspiring restorers of military combat aircraft, which sometimes referred to as warbirds.  It notes that the narrator, Michael Dorn, is a warbird owner and pilot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redtailreborn.com/html/reviews.html|title=Flight Journal|author=Farmer, James|accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref>
