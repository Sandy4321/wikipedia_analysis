'''William Warelwast''' (or '''William de Warelwast''')  (d.1137) was a medieval Norman cleric and [[Bishop of Exeter]] in England. A native of Normandy, little is known of his background before 1087, when he appears as a royal clerk for King [[William II of England]]. Most of his royal service to William was as a diplomatic envoy, as he was heavily involved with the king's dispute with [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], which was the beginning of the [[Investiture Controversy]] in England. He went several times to Rome as an emissary to the papacy on business related to Anselm. The medieval chronicler [[Eadmer]], who was a partisan of Anselm's, alleged that Warelwast bribed the pope and the papal officials to secure favourable outcomes for King William.

Possibly present at King William's accidental death, Warelwast continued to serve King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], William's successor, as a diplomat. After the end of the Investiture Controversy, Warelwast was rewarded with the bishopric of Exeter. Even after his elevation, he continued to serve Henry as a diplomat and also as a royal judge. He started the building of a new cathedral at Exeter, and it was probably Warelwast who divided the diocese into archdeaconries. He went blind after 1120, and after his death was succeeded by his nephew, [[Robert Warelwast]].

==Early life==

Little is known of William Warelwast's background or family before 1087. His name came from [[Ver-<U+00E0>-Val]], which is about {{convert|3.1|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the northwest of [[Yvetot]] in the current department of [[Seine-Maritime]]. Although hostile chroniclers claimed that Warelwast was uneducated, his career shows that he must have been literate and an accomplished speaker. He possibly was educated at [[Laon]], as later in life he sent his nephew [[Robert Warelwast]] to school there. Another nephew, William, later became the bishop's steward.<ref name=DNB>Barlow "Warelwast, William de (d. 1137)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

==Royal clerk under King William II==

Early in the reign of King [[William II of England]] Warelwast appears as authorizing [[writ]]s for the king.<ref name=Rufus96>Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 96</ref> He served the king as an envoy to [[Pope Urban II]] in 1095, when the king was seeking to remove the newly appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Anselm of Canterbury]] from office.<ref name=Poole174>Poole ''Domesday Book to Magna Carta'' p. 174</ref> Warelwast was sent with [[Gerard (Archbishop of York)|Gerard]], another royal clerk, to the pope with orders to recognize Urban in return for deposition of Anselm, at least according to [[Eadmer]], a medieval chronicler and partisan of Anselm.<ref name=Mason143/> The two clerks made a very fast journey, as they did not leave before 28 February 1095 and were back in England with the legate, [[Walter of Albano]], by 13 May 1095.<ref name=Vaughn187>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec'' p. 187</ref> Eadmer also claimed that the ambassadors were supposed to acquire a [[pallium]], the symbol of an archbishop's authority, for the king to give to his new choice as archbishop. It is likely, however, that while the king may have instructed his envoys to attempt to secure these objects, Rufus probably was willing to negotiate and settle for less.<ref name=Rufus342>Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 342<U+2013>343</ref> The two clerks brought back a papal legate, Walter of Albano, who accepted the king's recognition of Urban. However, the legate refused to allow the deposition of Anselm.<ref name=Mason143>Mason ''William II Rufus'' p. 143</ref> The king did manage to secure recognition of his royal rights in the church, and a concession that no papal legates or communications would be sent without the king's approval. Most likely, the king always regarded the deposition of Anselm as an unlikely event.<ref name=Rufus342/>
 
Warelwast was probably sent as an envoy to Urban in 1096 to bribe the pope to recall the papal legate Jarento, who had been sent to England to protest the king's conduct towards the church.<ref name=Rufus364>Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 364</ref> Besides ambassadorial duties, Warelwast also acted as a royal justice under King William, with the records of one case surviving.<ref name=Rufus395>Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 395</ref>

It was Warelwast who searched the baggage of Archbishop Anselm in 1097 shortly before the archbishop went into exile.<ref name=Bartlett405>Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 405</ref> Warelwast was probably searching, not so much for valuables, but for communications to the pope, either from Anselm himself, or from other English bishops. Warelwast especially would have looked for any letters of complaint.<ref name=Mason175>Mason ''William II Rufus'' p. 175<U+2013>178</ref> It was also Warelwast who prevented the excommunication of King William, as he was the king's envoy at Rome who refuted Anselm's attempts to get the king excommunicated while Anselm was in exile.<ref name=Poole177>Poole ''Domesday Book to Magna Carta'' p. 177</ref> The king had sent Warelwast to Pope Urban II at Christmas-time in 1098, with a reply from the king to a letter that the pope had written ordering the restoration of Anselm's estates. Eadmer, who was present at the papal court, stated that Warelwast prevented the excommunication by the means of bribes to the pope and to papal officials.<ref name=Mason175/>

==Royal service for King Henry I==

Warelwast may have been present with the hunting party on 2 August 1100 when King William was accidentally killed, for he was one of the witnesses to the letter sent on 5 August 1100 from the new King [[Henry I of England]] to Anselm recalling the archbishop.<ref name=Rufus420>Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 420</ref><ref name=DNB/> King Henry continued to use Warelwast as an ambassador, sending him to Rome in 1101 to bring back [[Pope Paschal II]]'s reply, which refused to allow lay [[investiture]], or granting of the symbols of episcopal authority by laymen.<ref name=Church298>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 298</ref><ref name=Henryi118>Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 118</ref>

It was Warelwast who told Anselm in 1103 that the king would not permit Anselm's return to England.<ref name=Bartlett405/> This came after a failed joint mission by Warelwast and Anselm to Paschal attempting to resolve the dispute between the king and the archbishop over the investiture of bishops by the king. This dispute is generally known as the [[Investiture Controversy]]. It is quite likely that the king had given instructions to Warelwast that if the mission failed, Warelwast was to inform Anselm that the archbishop was only welcome to return to England if Anselm agreed with the king's position in the dispute.<ref name=Vaughn244>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec'' p. 244<U+2013>245</ref> Warelwast in 1106 was the king's negotiator in the discussions that led to the settlement of the Investiture Controversy in England.<ref name=Church80/> In the spring of 1106, Warelwast was sent to [[Bec Abbey]], where Anselm was residing in exile, to inform Anselm of the settlement and give the archbishop the king's invitation to return to England.<ref name=HenryI198>Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 198</ref> In May 1107, Warelwast acted as the king's envoy at Paschal's council at Troyes where Paschal was attempting to secure support for [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Antioch]]'s projected [[Crusades|crusade]]. Warelwast probably relayed to the pope the fact that King Henry would make no contribution to Bohemond's efforts.<ref name=Cantor264>Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' p. 264</ref> 

Henry had reserved the see of Exeter for Warelwast since the death of [[Osbern FitzOsbern]] in 1103, but the controversy over investiture meant that his election and consecration were not possible before a settlement was reached. Instead, the king gave the office of [[Archdeacon of Exeter]] to Warelwast.<ref name=DNB/> He was elected [[Bishop of Exeter]], and was consecrated on 11 August 1107,<ref name=Handbook246>Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 246</ref> by Anselm at the royal palace of Westminster.<ref name=HenryI209>Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 209<U+2013>210</ref> Other bishops consecrated on this day included [[William Giffard]] to the [[Diocese of Winchester|see of Winchester]], [[Roger of Salisbury]] to the [[Diocese of Salisbury|see of Salisbury]], [[Reynelm]] to the [[Diocese of Hereford|see of Hereford]], and [[Urban (bishop)|Urban]] to the [[Diocese of Llandaff|see of Llandaff]].<ref name=Church78/> Warelwast's elevation was a reward for his diplomatic efforts in the Investiture crisis.<ref name=Church302>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 302</ref> The mass consecration signaled the end of the Investiture crisis in England.<ref name=Church78>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 78<U+2013>79</ref>

In 1115, Henry sent Warelwast back to Rome to negotiate with Paschal, who was angry that the king was prohibiting papal legates in England, not allowing clerics to appeal to the papal court, and was failing to secure papal sanction for church councils or the translation of bishops. Unfortunately, Warelwast was unable to change the pope's mind, but he did manage to keep the king from being sanctioned.<ref name=HenryI240>Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 240<U+2013>241</ref> Henry also employed Warelwast as a papal envoy during the disputes between Canterbury and York over the primacy in the English Church, with visits in 1119 and 1120, and possibly in 1116 also.<ref name=DNB/> On top of his diocesan and diplomatic duties, the bishop continued to act as a royal judge.<ref name=Church80>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 80</ref> Warelwast spent much time in attendance on the king, spending time with the Henry in Normandy from 1111 to 1115, in 1118, and from 1123 to 1126.<ref name=DNB/>

==Work as bishop==

As a bishop, Warelwast attended the [[Council of Reims]] in 1119, along with three other bishops,<ref name=Church111>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 111</ref> as well as the Council of Rouen in 1118, a provincial synod for Normandy.<ref name=Spear3>Spear "Norman Empire" ''Journal of British Studies'' p. 3</ref> In his diocese he started a new cathedral, which began construction around 1114 and was consecrated in 1133. The two towers in the [[transept]]s date from this construction.<ref name=DNB/> Other actions as bishop included replacing the [[secular clergy]] staffing collegiate churches with regular [[Canon (priest)|canons]]. He did this at [[Plympton]] in 1121 with canons from [[Aldgate]], and again in 1127 at the church in [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]] in Cornwall.<ref name=Burton47>Burton ''Monastic and Religious Orders'' p. 47</ref>  He also founded a house of regular canons at [[Bodmin]].<ref name=Church80/> It wasn't until late in his bishopric that the diocese was split into multiple [[archdeacon]]ries, which appears to have happened in 1133.<ref name=Church49>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 49</ref> Warelwast also instituted the two offices of treasurer and precentor for the cathedral chapter.<ref name=DNB/>

Warelwast went blind in his last years, starting about 1120,<ref name=DNB/> and this was regarded by the medieval chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]] as a fitting punishment for Warelwast's alleged attempts to remove his predecessor from office early.<ref name=Church80/> He died about 26 September 1137,<ref name=Handbook246/> and was buried in the priory at Plympton.<ref name=DNB/> His nephew Robert Warelwast succeeded him in 1138. Robert had been appointed archdeacon of Exeter by his uncle.<ref name=Church249>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 249</ref> Several medieval chroniclers state that Wiliam Warelwast was illiterate, although this probably was due to Eadmer's bias against the bishop than to truth.<ref name=Church80/> The medieval historian [[C. Warren Hollister]] described Warelwast as a "canny and devoted royal servant".<ref name=HenryI240/>
