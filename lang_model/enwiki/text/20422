'''HMS ''Furious''''' was a modified {{sclass|Courageous|battlecruiser}}  built for the [[Royal Navy]] (RN) during the [[First World War]]. Designed to support the [[Baltic Project]] championed by the [[First Sea Lord]] of the [[Admiralty]], Lord [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]], the ship was very lightly armoured and armed with only a few heavy guns. ''Furious'' was modified and became an [[aircraft carrier]] while under construction. Her forward turret was removed and a [[flight deck]] was added in its place, so that aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure to land. Later in the war, the ship had her rear turret removed and a second flight deck installed aft of the superstructure, but this was less than satisfactory due to air [[turbulence]]. ''Furious'' was briefly laid up after the war before she was reconstructed with a full-length flight deck in the early 1920s.

After her conversion, ''Furious'' was used extensively for trials of naval aircraft and later as a training carrier once the new armoured carriers like {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} entered service in the late 1930s. During the early months of the [[World War II|Second World War]] the carrier spent her time hunting for German raiders in the North Atlantic and escorting convoys. This changed dramatically during the [[Norwegian Campaign]] in early 1940 when her aircraft provided air support to British troops ashore in addition to attacking German shipping. The first of what would be a large number of aircraft ferry missions was made by the carrier during the campaign. After the withdrawal of British troops in May, ''Furious'' made several anti-shipping strikes in Norway with little result before beginning a steady routine of ferrying aircraft for the [[Royal Air Force]].

At first ''Furious'' made several trips to [[West Africa]], but she began to ferry aircraft to [[Gibraltar]] in 1941. An unsuccessful attack on German-occupied ports on the [[Arctic Ocean]] interrupted the ferry missions in mid-1941. ''Furious'' was given a lengthy refit in the United States and spent a few months training after her return in April 1942. She made several more ferry trips in mid-1942 before her aircraft attacked airfields in [[Vichy French]] [[French Algeria| Algeria]] as part of the opening stages of [[Operation Torch]] in November 1942. The ship remained in the Mediterranean until February 1943 when she was transferred to the Home Fleet.

''Furious'' spent most of 1943 training, but made a number of attacks on the {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz}} and other targets in Norway during the first half of 1944. By September 1944, the ship was showing her age and she was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]]. ''Furious'' was decommissioned in April 1945, but was not sold for [[scrap]] until 1948.

==Design and description==
During the First World War, [[Admiral]] Fisher was prevented from ordering an improved version of the preceding {{Sclass|Renown|battlecruiser}}s by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers. To obtain ships suitable for traditional battlecruiser roles, such as scouting for fleets and hunting enemy raiders, he settled on ships with the minimal armour of a [[light cruiser]] and the armament of a battlecruiser. He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast, shallow-draught ships for his Baltic Project, a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast.<ref name=b03>Burt 1986, p. 303</ref><ref>Roberts, pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref>

''Furious'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|786|ft|9|in|m|1}}, a beam of {{convert|88|ft|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|24|ft|11|in|m|1}} at deep load. She displaced {{convert|19513|LT|t|0}} normally and {{convert|22890|LT|t|0}} at deep load. She had a metacentric height of {{convert|5.33|ft|1}} at deep load.<ref name=r65>Roberts, pp. 64<U+2013>65</ref> ''Furious'' and her [[sister ship|half-sisters]] were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared [[steam turbine]]s. To save design time the installation used in the light cruiser {{HMS|Champion|1915|2}}, the first cruiser in the RN with geared turbines, was copied and simply duplicated to provide two sets of turbines. The four Brown-Curtis turbines were powered by eighteen [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] small-tube [[water-tube boiler|boilers]] that were designed to produce a total of {{convert|90000|shp|lk=in}}. The ship's speed was an estimated {{convert|31.5|kn|lk=in}}, but she never ran her [[sea trial]]s.<ref>Roberts, pp. 71, 76, 79</ref>

[[File:FuriousSP 89.jpg|250px|thumb|left|''Furious'' as originally completed. She had a flying-off deck for aircraft forward.]]
''Furious'' was designed to normally carry {{convert|750|LT|t|0}} of [[fuel oil]], but could carry a maximum of {{convert|3160|LT|t|0}}. At full capacity, she could steam for an estimated {{convert|6000|nmi|-1}} at a speed of {{convert|20|knots}}.<ref name=b06>Burt 1986, p. 306</ref> The ship was designed to carry two [[BL 18 inch Mk I naval gun|BL 18-inch Mark I]] guns in two single turrets, one each fore ('A') and aft ('Y'). Her secondary armament consisted of 11 [[BL 5.5 inch Mark I naval gun|BL 5.5-inch Mk I]] guns. A pair of [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt]]<ref group=Note>"Cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 20 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns were mounted before the [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]. ''Furious'' also mounted two submerged [[torpedo tube|tubes]] for [[British 21 inch torpedo|21-inch torpedoes]] and 10 torpedoes were carried.<ref name=b06/>

Even as she was being built, ''Furious'' was modified with a large [[hangar]] capable of housing ten aircraft on her [[forecastle]] that replaced the forward turret. A 160-foot (49&nbsp;m) [[flight deck]] was built along its roof. Aircraft were flown off and, rather less successfully, landed on this deck. [[Floatplane]]s like the [[Short Type 184]] used a four-wheel trolley that ran down a track along the centre of the flight deck for take-off. Aircraft were lifted by [[crane (machine)|crane]] from the hangar to the flight deck. Although the aft turret was fitted and the gun tested, it was not long before ''Furious'' returned to her builders for further modifications. In November 1917, the rear turret was replaced by a 300-foot (91&nbsp;m) deck for landing aircraft over another hangar.<ref>Parkes, p. 622</ref> Her funnel and superstructure remained intact, with a narrow strip of decking around them to connect the fore and aft flight decks.<ref name=b14>Burt 1986, p. 314</ref> [[Turbulence]] from the funnel and superstructure was severe enough that only three landing attempts were successful before further attempts were forbidden.<ref>Parkes, p. 624</ref> Her 18-inch guns were reused on {{sclass|Lord Clive|monitor|3|warship}}s {{HMS|General Wolfe|1915|2}} and {{HMS|Lord Clive|1915|2}} during the war.<ref>Buxton, p. 73</ref>

''Furious'' was [[Keel|laid down]] on 8 June 1915 at [[Armstrong Whitworth]]'s Low Walker shipyard in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. The ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 18 August 1916<ref>Burt 1986, p. 306</ref> and commissioned on 26 June 1917.<ref>Jenkins, p. 251</ref> As completed, her complement numbered 737 officers and enlisted men.<ref>Burt 1986, p. 307</ref>

==Aircraft landing and the First World War==
[[Image:HMSFurious-SopwithCamels-WWI-IWM SP1159.jpg|thumb|[[Sopwith Camel]]s on ''Furious''{{'}} forward flying-off deck during the First World War]]
On 2 August 1917, while performing trials, [[Royal Naval Air Service#Officer ranks|Squadron Commander]] [[Edwin Harris Dunning|Edwin Dunning]] landed a [[Sopwith Pup]], believed to have been ''[[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|N6453]]'', successfully on board ''Furious'', becoming the first person to land an aircraft on a moving ship. On 7 August, he made one more successful landing in the same manner, but on his third attempt, in Pup ''N6452'', the engine choked and the aircraft crashed off the starboard bow, killing him. The deck arrangement was unsatisfactory because aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure in order to land.<ref>Bruce, p. 204</ref>

In the meantime, all three ''Courageous''-class ships were assigned to the [[1st Cruiser Squadron]] (CS) in October 1917 when the Admiralty received word of German ship movements on 16 October, possibly indicating a raid. Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty]], commander of the [[Grand Fleet]], ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea in an effort to locate the enemy ships. ''Furious'' was detached from the 1st CS and ordered to sweep along the 56th parallel as far as 4<U+00B0> East and to return before dark. Her half-sisters {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} and {{HMS|Glorious||2}} were not initially ordered to sea, but were sent to reinforce the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron patrolling the central part of the [[North Sea]] later that day.<ref>Newbolt, pp. 150<U+2013>51</ref> Two German {{sclass|Brummer|cruiser|0}} light cruisers managed to slip through the gaps in the British patrols and destroyed the Scandinavia convoy during the morning of 17 October, but no word was received of the engagement until that afternoon. The 1st CS was ordered to attempt to intercept the German ships, but they proved to be faster than hoped and the British ships were unsuccessful.<ref>Newbolt, pp. 156<U+2013>57</ref>

''Furious'' returned to the dockyard in November to have the aft turret removed and replaced by another deck for landing, giving her both a launching and a recovery deck. Two lifts (elevators) serving the hangars were also installed. ''Furious'' was recommissioned on 15 March 1918, and her embarked aircraft were used on anti-[[Zeppelin]] patrols in the North Sea after May. In July 1918, she flew off seven [[Sopwith Camel]]s which participated in the [[Tondern raid]], attacking the Zeppelin sheds there with moderate success.<ref>Newbolt, p. 347</ref>

==Conversion==
===Overview===
''Furious'' was laid up after the war, but was converted to an aircraft carrier with a continuous flight deck between June 1921 and September 1925. Her design was based on experience gained with the first two British carriers, {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}} and {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}},<ref>Burt 1993, pp. 258<U+2013>63</ref> although this was very limited as ''Argus'' was less than three years old<ref>Burt 1993, p. 248</ref> and ''Eagle'' had only carried out 143 deck landings during her preliminary sea trials in 1920.<ref>Brown, p. 252</ref>

The ship's superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a {{convert|576|by|92|ft|m|1|adj=on}} flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at that time. The fore-and-aft {{convert|320|ft|1|adj=on}} [[arresting gear]] was not intended to stop landing aircraft<U+2014>the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind<U+2014>but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck.<ref name=f5/> Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges used minimised turbulence.<ref>Burt 1993, pp. 259, 262</ref>

[[File:SSZ airship aboard HMS Furious 1918 IWM Q 20640.jpg|thumb|Closeup of the ship shortly following its initial conversion. An [[SSZ class blimp]] is on the after deck]]
''Furious'' was not lengthened, but her beam was increased {{convert|1|ft|m|1}} to {{convert|89|ft|.75|in|m|1}}<ref name=endpaper>Jenkins, front [[endpaper]]</ref> and her average draught was now {{convert|27|ft|3|in|m|1}} at deep load, {{convert|2|ft|m|1}} deeper than before the conversion. She displaced {{convert|22500|LT|t}} at normal load and {{convert|26500|LT|t|abbr=on}} at deep load, over 3000 long tons more than her previous displacement. Her metacentric height was {{convert|3.6|ft|1}} at deep load, a reduction of {{convert|1.48|ft|1}} after her conversion.<ref name=r65/><ref name=b69>Burt 1993, p. 269</ref>  During the ship's post-conversion sea trials she reached {{convert|30.03|kn}}.<ref>Jenkins, p. 269</ref> Her fuel capacity was increased by {{convert|700|LT|t}} during her reconstruction, which increased her range to {{convert|5300|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|16|knots}}<ref name=f5>Friedman, p. 95</ref> or {{convert|7480|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=f3>Friedman, p. 363</ref>

A two-level hangar was built under the flight deck, {{convert|15|ft|1}} in height per level. The lower hangar was {{convert|550|ft|1}} long by {{convert|35|-|50|ft|1}} wide and the upper was {{convert|520|by|50|ft|1}}. Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] which allowed the ship to simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck or to speedily fly off her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck. Like ''Argus'', ''Furious'' was [[flush deck|flush-decked]] and lacked an island [[superstructure]] to minimise any turbulence over the flight deck; instead she had a navigating position at the leading edge of the flight deck, starboard, and was provided with a retractable [[Glossary_of_nautical_terms#C|charthouse]] forward, on the flight deck centreline.<ref>Burt 1993, pp. 258<U+2013>59, 262<U+2013>63</ref><ref name"chesneau">Chesneau, pp. 85<U+2013>88</ref> The ship could normally only carry about 36 aircraft.<ref name=b69/>

Two {{convert|47|by|46|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. No arresting gear was fitted and two {{convert|600|impgal|l USgal|adj=on}} ready-use [[petrol]] tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional {{convert|20000|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol were in bulk storage. In 1939, her complement consisted of 41 officers and 754 crewmen.<ref>Friedman, pp. 94<U+2013>95, 366</ref>

===Armament===
''Furious'' retained ten of her original eleven [[breech-loading]] {{convert|5.5|in|adj=on}} guns, five on each side, for self-defence from enemy warships.<ref>Burt 1993, p. 276</ref> Six [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF 4-inch Mark V]] guns replaced her original anti-aircraft guns. Four were mounted on the sides of the flying-off deck and two on the [[quarterdeck]]. The four guns on the flying-off deck were removed in 1926<U+2013>27 for trials of the lower flight deck, but only two were replaced when the trials were concluded. Four single [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder]] "pom-poms" were installed in 1927.<ref name=f9>Friedman, p. 109</ref> During ''Furious''{{'}}s September 1930 <U+2013> February 1932 refit, her anti-aircraft outfit was reinforced by the addition of two eight-barrel QF 2-pounder Mark V pom-pom mounts where the forward 4-inch guns on the flying-off deck had been removed earlier.<ref name=b69/>

The 5.5-inch and 4-inch guns were replaced during her refit in early 1939 by a dozen [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|QF 4-inch Mk XVI guns]] in twin [[dual purpose gun|dual-purpose]] Mark XIX mounts. One mount each was on the former flying-off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side. Two more Mark V 2-pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island superstructure at the same time.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 276<U+2013>77</ref> While later refitting in the United States, the ship was fitted with a maximum of 22 manually operated automatic [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{convert|20|mm|adj=on}} Oerlikon]] light anti-aircraft guns, which replaced the single quadruple [[Vickers .50 machine gun|Vickers .50&nbsp;machine gun mount]].<ref name=f9/>

A single [[High Angle Control System]] director was fitted on the island and another on an elevated mount on the former flying-off deck. Two pom-pom directors were also mounted on the island for the weapons mounted fore and aft of the island.<ref name=j77/>

==Pre-war service==
[[File:HMS Furious-13.jpg|thumb|300px|Stern view of ''Furious'' taken in 1925, shortly after her reconstruction]]
''Furious'' was assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] after commissioning in 1925 although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher floatplanes, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily.<ref name=f9/><ref>Burt 1993, pp. 266<U+2013>69</ref> The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge palisades were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather.<ref name=f5/><ref>Jenkins, p. 271</ref> The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard ''Furious''.<ref>Jenkins, p. 274</ref> In the 1920s, the ship commonly carried one flight of fighters ([[Fairey Flycatcher]]), two of spotters ([[Blackburn Blackburn]] or [[Avro Bison]]), one spotter reconnaissance ([[Fairey III]]D) and two flights of torpedo bombers ([[Blackburn Dart]]), each usually of six aircraft.<ref name=b69/> 

''Furious'' was reduced to reserve on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]]. It lasted from September 1930 to February 1932 and was focused on refitting her machinery and re-tubing her boilers.<ref>Burt 1993, pp. 265, 269</ref> In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck, the AA armament was revised and spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 275<U+2013>76</ref> Upon completion, she ran a full-power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was {{convert|28.8|kn}} from a total of {{convert|89745|shp}}.<ref>Burt 1993, p. 265</ref>

[[File:HMS Furious-10.jpg|thumb|left|Oblique view of ''Furious'' at anchor before her armament was installed. Her retractable charthouse is prominent at the forward end of the flight deck.]] 
''Furious'' recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the [[Home Fleet]] with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November.<ref name=j6>Jenkins, p. 276</ref> Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] from May to October 1934. ''Furious'' was present at the Coronation [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] on 20 May 1937 for [[George VI]]. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted in Devonport between December 1937 and May 1938 where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the [[Munich Crisis]] in September 1938, the ship embarked [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801]], [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821]] and [[822 Naval Air Squadron|822]] Squadrons and joined the fleet at [[Scapa Flow]], before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair. She was struck a glancing blow by the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Encounter||2}} during this time, but suffered only minor damage.<ref name=j6/><ref>Burt 1993, pp. 269<U+2013>71</ref>

From 1933 to the end of 1938 ''Furious'' carried 801 Squadron which initially flew a mixture of six [[Hawker Nimrod]] and three Flycatcher fighters. [[Hawker Osprey]] fighters replaced the Flycatchers in early 1934 and the Nimrods were withdrawn in October 1936.<ref>Sturtivant 1984, pp. 161, 164<U+2013>65</ref> [[811 Naval Air Squadron|811]] and 822 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti-shipping missions. They flew the [[Blackburn Ripon]], the [[Blackburn Baffin]] and the [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s and as well as the Fairey IIIF, the [[Fairey Seal]] and the [[Blackburn Shark]] reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Sturtivant 1984, pp. 203<U+2013>04, 253<U+2013>55</ref>

The ship was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted anti-aircraft guns on her lower flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, and gave her a small island on the starboard side. ''Furious'' resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 277<U+2013>78</ref> As a deck-landing training carrier in 1939 ''Furious'' embarked [[767 Naval Air Squadron|767 Squadron]], flying Shark, Swordfish and [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft,<ref>Sturtivant 1984, pp. 106, 108</ref> and [[769 Naval Air Squadron|769 Squadron]], flying [[Blackburn Skua]], [[Blackburn Roc]], and [[Gloster Sea Gladiator]] fighters.<ref>Sturtivant 1984, p. 111</ref>

==Second World War==
''Furious'' remained on training duties, combined with anti-submarine sweeps off the east coast of [[Scotland]] until 2 October 1939.<ref name=j77>Jenkins, p. 277</ref> She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken ''Courageous'' and embarked nine Swordfish aircraft from [[816 Naval Air Squadron|816 Squadron]]<ref>Sturtivant 1984, p. 228</ref> and a detachment of three more Swordfish from [[818 Naval Air Squadron|818 Squadron]].<ref>Sturtivant 1984, p. 237</ref> The ship sortied on 8 October with the fleet to unsuccessfully hunt for the {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau}} and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern [[Norway]].<ref name=j77/> After returning from this search, ''Furious'' departed her berth adjacent to the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October, the day before ''Royal Oak'' was sunk by {{ship|German submarine|U-47|1938|2}}. Afterwards she was transferred to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], where she and the battlecruiser {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} formed a hunting group for German raiders. ''Furious'' served as the [[flagship]] for the convoy bringing most of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] to Britain in mid-December 1939. In the darkness on 17 December, the west-bound [[ocean liner]] SS ''Samaria'' passed through the convoy unseen. She ripped off the horizontal wireless masts on ''Furious''{{'}}s starboard side, carried away five overhanging [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s from the port side of {{ship|RMS|Aquitania|}}, and just missed the third and fourth ships in line.<ref>Jenkins, p. 279</ref>

===Norwegian Campaign===
{{Main|Norwegian Campaign}}
''Furious'' joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 with only eighteen Swordfish from 816 and 818 Squadrons embarked;<ref name=h39>Haarr, p. 139</ref> no fighters were able to join the ship in time.<ref>Sturtivant 1990, p. 40</ref> Sixteen Swordfish made unsuccessful torpedo attacks on German ships in [[Trondheim]] harbour the following morning.<ref>Rohwer, p. 19</ref> On 12 April, both squadrons attempted to attack German ships in [[Narvik]] in bad weather. Disappointed with the failure of the torpedo attacks the previous day, bombs were carried instead. 818 Squadron, making the first attack, damaged several captured Norwegian ships, but lost two aircraft to [[flak]], although the crews were rescued by the British cruiser {{HMS|Penelope|97|2}} and the destroyer {{HMS|Punjabi|F21|2}}. Following 40 minutes behind, 816 Squadron was forced to turn back by heavy weather. One aircraft was lost while landing, but the crew was recovered.<ref name=h39/> Another attack was launched the next day in support of the [[Battles of Narvik#Second Naval Battle of Narvik|British ships entering Narvik]], but they contributed little and another pair of Swordfish were shot down.<ref name=h40>Haarr, p. 140</ref>

''Furious'', ordered to remain behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, departed the Narvik area on 14 April, escorted by three destroyers, to refuel at [[Troms<U+00F8>]].<ref name=h40/> En route, her Swordfish attacked [[Junkers Ju 52]] transports that had landed on frozen Lake [[Hartvikvatnet]] approximately {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} north-east of Narvik. Two of the Ju 52s were destroyed and several others damaged.<ref>Haar, p. 195</ref> She reached the port on 16 April with only 27% of her fuel remaining. She stayed there until 18 April when she headed south to scout the Narvik area. She was attacked en route by a single [[Heinkel He 111]] bomber of the II./[[Kampfgeschwader 26|KG 26]] wing from very high altitude. Two large bombs narrowly missed the ship, the closest only {{convert|11|yd|m|1}} off the port side aft. The shock shook her [[propeller shaft]]s out of alignment and jarred the port inner high-pressure turbine so that she was limited to {{convert|20|kn}}.<ref name=h40/> ''Furious'' remained off the coast of Norway despite the damage and attempted to fly off aircraft on 22 April, despite severe weather, to discourage German aircraft from delivering supplies to the German forces in Narvik. One aircraft was shot down by the Germans and the others returned reporting heavy snowstorms between the ship and Narvik. The weather worsened the next day and [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Thomas Hope Troubridge|Troubridge]] decided to head to [[Harstad]] to check the damage from the near miss. It proved worse than anticipated and he was ordered back to the United Kingdom. Only six of the nine remaining Swordfish were serviceable.<ref>Haar, pp. 140<U+2013>41</ref>

After quick repairs, which included the removal of several rows of turbine blades,<ref>Jenkins, p. 282</ref> ''Furious'' returned to Norway on 18 May carrying the [[Gloster Gladiator|Gladiators]] of a reformed [[Royal Air Force]] [[No. 263 Squadron RAF|263 Squadron]]; they were flown off on 21 April once their base at [[Bardufoss]] was ready. One Gladiator and the guiding Swordfish crashed en route, killing all crewmen. The ship returned to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off,<ref>Haarr, p. 261</ref> carrying only six Sea Gladiators of [[804 Naval Air Squadron|804 Squadron]] and nine Swordfish of 816 Squadron for self-protection while ferrying 263 Squadron.<ref name=b16>Brown, p. 16</ref>

On 14 June, carrying only half of 816 Squadron for her own protection, ''Furious'' sailed unescorted for Halifax carrying <U+00A3>18,000,000 in gold [[bullion]]. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for [[Iceland]] from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft with spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain Troubridge ordered all available space should be used to transport sugar to Britain.<ref>Jenkins, p. 283</ref> Upon her arrival, she embarked the rest of 816 Squadron, as well as nine Skuas of 801 Squadron and nine Swordfish of [[825 Naval Air Squadron|825]], and made a number of largely unsuccessful air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Troms<U+00F8> in September and October 1940, at a cost of several aircraft.<ref>Brown, pp. 16<U+2013>17</ref> Both Swordfish squadrons disembarked afterwards to make room as she prepared to resume her role as an aircraft transport.<ref>Brown, p. 17</ref>

===Ferry duties===
[[File:Furious1941.jpg|thumb|right|''Furious'' in August 1941 with four Hurricanes on her flight deck|300px]]
''Furious'' loaded 55 aircraft, mostly crated [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters of [[No. 73 Squadron RAF]], in [[Liverpool]] on 7 November and sailed for [[Takoradi]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] on 15 November where they were flown off or off-loaded on 27 November with the ultimate destination of [[Egypt]]. During this time she retained only six Skuas of 801 Squadron for her own protection. ''Furious'' was back in Liverpool by 15 December where she embarked 40 more Hurricanes for Takoradi. She sailed on 21 December and joined up with [[Convoy WS5A]] and the small carrier ''Argus''. The {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper}} encountered the convoy on 25 December, but little damage was inflicted by ''Hipper'' before she was driven off by the escorts. No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser because the Swordfish were embarked in ''Argus'' with bombs that they could not carry and their torpedoes were aboard ''Furious''. After ''Furious''{{'}}s Skuas had flown off to search for ''Hipper'', space was made to land the Swordfish to load the torpedoes, but the Skuas could not locate ''Hipper'' because of the poor visibility. ''Furious'' reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941 and arrived back in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit. She made another ferry trip to Takoradi on 4 March, carrying 12 [[Fairey Fulmar]]s of [[807 Naval Air Squadron|807 Squadron]] and six Swordfish of 825 Squadron for self-defence.<ref>Nailer, pp. 154<U+2013>55</ref>

''Furious'' now had a new destination for her ferry trips and she transported 24 Hurricanes to [[Gibraltar]] on 25 April where they were transferred to {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} to be flown off for [[Malta]].<ref>Nailer, p. 156</ref> She sailed for a brief refit at [[Belfast]] immediately afterwards. While in Belfast she was hit by one small bomb and near-missed by two others during a German air raid in early May, but was only lightly damaged.<ref name=j84>Jenkins, p. 284</ref> The ship loaded another batch of 40 Hurricane IIs, plus nine Fulmars from 'X' Flight of [[800 Naval Air Squadron|800 Squadron]] in Liverpool, and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to ''Ark Royal'' via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied ''Ark Royal'' and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of [[Sardinia]]. ''Furious'' loaded 48 more Hurricane IIs and arrived back in Gibraltar on 1 June where some of the fighters were transferred to ''Ark Royal''. The two carriers departed Gibraltar on 4 June and flew off 44 of the 48 fighters. ''Furious'' returned to the [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]] for her biggest load of aircraft yet, 64 Hurricanes, leaving room for only nine Swordfish from 816 Squadron on this voyage. Upon her arrival on 25 June she transferred 22 Hurricanes to ''Ark Royal'' and that carrier flew them off to Malta the next day. Of the 42 Hurricanes left on ''Furious'', 26 were moved to ''Ark Royal'' when she returned on 28 June. This time, however, both carriers sailed to deliver the fighters to their usual take-off point west of Sicily. The tenth of ''Furious''{{'}}s aircraft to take off crashed into her island, killing 14 men and starting a serious fire on the flight deck. The blocked flight deck forced the remaining six Hurricanes to remain on board and they were returned to Gibraltar. ''Furious'' exchanged 816 Squadron for 818 from ''Ark Royal'', then departed for home.<ref>Nailer, pp. 156<U+2013>57</ref>

In July, ''Furious'' embarked nine Fulmars of 800 Squadron, 'A' Flight of [[880 Naval Air Squadron|880 Squadron]] with four [[Sea Hurricane]] IBs, nine Swordfish from [[812 Naval Air Squadron|812 Squadron]] and nine Albacores of [[817 Naval Air Squadron|817 Squadron]] to [[Raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo|attack the German-occupied ports of Kirkenes, Norway, and Petsamo, Finland]], departing Scapa Flow on the 23rd in company with with the carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}}, two cruisers and six destroyers.<ref>Brown, pp. 19<U+2013>20</ref> The two carriers and their escorts gathered in [[Sey<U+00F0>isfj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>ur|Seidisfjord]], Iceland, under the command of [[Rear Admiral]] [[Frederic Wake-Walker|Wake-Walker]] where they refuelled in late July.<ref>Rohwer, p. 88</ref> ''Furious'' attacked ships in Petsamo on 30 July with all of her Swordfish and Albacores, escorted by six Fulmars and all four Sea Hurricanes, but there was very little shipping present. One small ship, MV ''Trotter'', was sunk, several oil storage tanks were set afire, and several wooden [[jetties]] were torpedoed. The British ships had been spotted before the attack and two Fulmars and an Albacore were shot down by the alerted defences.<ref name=j84/> ''Furious'' was short of fuel and had to leave shortly afterwards, but she transferred her Albacores to ''Victorious'' to fill up that carrier's decimated squadrons before she left.<ref>Brown, p. 20</ref> Sea Hurricanes of 880 Squadron shot down a shadowing [[Dornier Do 18]] [[flying boat]] on 31 July as the ship was leaving.<ref>Sturtivant 1984, p. 356</ref>

On 30 August, ''Furious'' left Belfast with a load of 49 Hurricanes, carrying three Fulmars of 800 Squadron and four Sea Hurricane IBs of 880A Squadron for self-defence, and nine Swordfish of 812 Squadron for ''Ark Royal''. She arrived in Gibraltar on 6 September and transferred 40 Hurricanes to the other carrier the next day. ''Ark Royal'' sailed for the departure point the following day, but could only fly off 14 Hurricanes because some of the [[Bristol Blenheim]] bombers used to guide the fighters to Malta failed to make their rendezvous. When ''Ark Royal'' returned, she transferred the six Swordfish of 810 Squadron to ''Furious'' and both carriers departed that same day to deliver the Hurricanes.<ref>Nailer, p. 158</ref> This was ''Furious''{{'}}s last ferry mission as she was sent to [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], for a lengthy refit. She arrived on 7 October and did not return to the United Kingdom until April 1942.<ref name=j84/>

''Furious'' spent the next three months after her return [[Glossary_of_nautical_terms#W|working up]]. In August, she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in [[Operation Pedestal]], but she was only to sail far enough with them to allow her 38 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s to reach Malta. This she did, just as ''Eagle'' was torpedoed, but ''Furious'' turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the [[Balearic Islands]]. After this mission, ''Furious'' was sent back to the Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before [[Operation Torch]] and the ship arrived at Gibraltar on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on 29 August before returning to Gibraltar and being assigned to [[Force H]].<ref>Nailer, pp. 163<U+2013>65</ref>

As part of Operation Torch, ''Furious'' embarked 12 [[Supermarine Seafire]] IBs of 801 Squadron, another 12 Seafire IICs of 807 Squadron and nine Albacores of 822 Squadron to provide air cover for the amphibious landings by the Central Task Force. On the morning of 8 November, ''Furious''{{'}}s Seafires [[Strafing|strafed]] the [[Vichy French]] airfield at [[Tafraoui]], destroying three aircraft on the ground and shooting down one [[Dewoitine D.520]] fighter, the first air-to-air kill by a Seafire.<ref>Brown, pp. 62<U+2013>63</ref> Eight Albacores, escorted by Sea Hurricanes from two [[escort carrier]]s, attacked the field at [[Es S<U+00E9>nia|La Senia]]. They were attacked by D.520s as they began their attack dive, but they destroyed 47 aircraft on the ground despite the loss of an Albacore from anti-aircraft fire and the loss of three and damage to two more against the French fighters.<ref>Brown, p. 623</ref>  Seafires of 807 Squadron from ''Furious'' covered the landings at [[Oran]], engaging a flight of D.520s, shooting down three and destroying about twenty aircraft on the ground.<ref>Sturtivant 1990, p. 93</ref>

===Home Waters===
''Furious'' remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to the Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war. In July, the fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; ''Furious''{{'}}s role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report, then shoot it down.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 284<U+2013>85</ref> She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training.<ref name=b2>Burt 1986, p. 272</ref> During the passage of Convoy JW-57 from the U.K. to Russia in February 1944, ''Furious'', escorted by the British battleship {{HMS|Anson|79|2}} and the {{ship|French battleship|Richelieu}}, attacked German shipping off the Norwegian coast on 24 February.<ref>Rohwer, p. 307</ref> The carrier had the Seafire IBs of 801 Squadron aboard, plus the [[Fairey Barracuda]] torpedo bombers of [[827 Naval Air Squadron|827 Squadron]] and [[830 Naval Air Squadron|830 Squadrons]]. No aircraft were lost and a beached freighter was destroyed.<ref>Brown, p. 24</ref>

In preparation for [[Operation Tungsten]], an attack on the {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz}}, ''Furious'' and ''Victorious'' exchanged Barracuda squadrons, 827 for [[831 Naval Air Squadron|831 Squadron]], so that the squadrons that trained together could fly together. ''Furious'' also embarked 880 Squadron with eight Seafire L.IIC fighters to reinforce the six Seafire IBs of 801 Squadron. On the morning of 3 April, 21 Barracudas of 827 and 830 Squadrons made the first attack just as the ''Tirpitz'' was getting under way for sea trials. The Germans were caught entirely by surprise and the ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s smokescreen was only just beginning to form. The British aircraft enjoyed a clear view of their target and hit the German battleship six times. An hour later the second wave of 19 Barracudas from 829 and 831 Squadrons arrived and scored eight more hits. Only one Barracuda was shot down from each wave and another crashed on take-off. 801 and 880 Squadrons were retained for fleet air defence during the operation. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s superstructure and upper hull was moderately damaged by the bombs, but her machinery was intact because the Barracuda pilots pressed home their attack below the {{convert|3000|ft|m|adj=on}} altitude necessary to give their {{convert|1600|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing]] bombs enough velocity to penetrate ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main armoured deck. Nonetheless ''Tirpitz'' was under repair for three months.<ref>Brown, pp. 25, 27</ref>

The Home Fleet tried another attack on ''Tirpitz'' later on 23 April, but bad weather prevented any attack from being made that day and for the next several days. Instead, the aircraft attempted to attack installations at [[Bod<U+00F8>]] on 26 April, but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships. ''Furious'' and the escort carrier {{HMS|Searcher|D40|2}} attacked shipping in the vicinity of [[Kristiansund]] and sank the [[Bulk carrier|ore carrier]] ''Almora'' and the [[tanker (ship)|tanker]] ''Saarburg'' for the loss of two aircraft on 6 May. Another attack on ''Tirpitz'' by the Home Fleet had to be abandoned on 15 May because of poor weather. Yet another attempt on 28 May was foiled by bad weather, but a German convoy was successfully attacked on 1 June. One ammunition ship was sunk and two others were set on fire.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 320, 322</ref>

''Furious'' and the fleet carriers {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} and {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} made another attempt to sink the ''Tirpitz'' on 17 July, in Operation Mascot. For this attack the carrier embarked 880 Squadron with three Seafire L.IICs, 20 [[Grumman Hellcat]]s of [[1840 Naval Air Squadron|1840 Squadron]], Barracudas of 830 Squadron and three Swordfish of 842 Flight.  The Barracudas, heavily loaded with bombs of up to {{convert|1600|lb|adj=on}}, launched using a wooden ramp: an early example of what was to be later named the ski-jump.<ref>Sturtivant 1990, p. 109</ref> The attack was unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences as a smokescreen covered the German battleship so that the Barracudas had to drop their bombs blindly through the smoke. Four more attacks on ''Tirpitz'' were made in August under the name of Operation Goodwood in a concerted effort to sink her. ''Furious'' carried twelve Seafire F.IIIs of 801 Squadron, another twelve Seafire L.IICs of 880 Squadron and nine Barracudas of 827 Squadron for this operation.<ref>Brown, pp. 24, 28</ref> The first attack on 20 August was recalled because of bad weather, but the attack on 22 August was spotted by the Germans and 11 aircraft were lost.<ref>Rohwer, p. 350</ref> Another attack was made two days later; one armour-piercing bomb penetrated ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s armoured deck but failed to detonate, and another {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb did only superficial damage. A fourth attack was made on 29 August, but inflicted no damage.<ref>Brown, p. 28</ref>

By this time the ship's age and limitations became increasingly apparent and she was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. The ship was [[paid off]] in April 1945 and, berthed at Loch Striven,<ref>Jenkins, p. 288</ref> was used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship's structure. ''Furious'' was sold in 1948 for [[scrap]], and had been completely broken up in [[Troon]] by 1954.<ref name=b2/>
