'''''Mind Meld: Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime''''' is a 2001 American [[documentary film]] in which actors [[William Shatner]] and [[Leonard Nimoy]] discuss the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[Science fiction|science-fiction]] franchise and its effects on their lives. Shatner and Nimoy portrayed the characters [[James T. Kirk]] and [[Spock]] respectively in the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|1960s ''Star Trek'' television series]], the [[Star Trek: The Animated Series|1970s animated television series]], and [[Star Trek (film franchise)|their film sequels]]. Among the topics discussed are the difficult relationships they had with [[Gene Roddenberry]]<U+2014>the creator of ''Star Trek''<U+2014>and with the several fellow cast members who disliked Shatner. It was in ''Mind Meld'' that Nimoy first publicly revealed that he had struggled with [[alcoholism]] while he was acting in the original television series. Shatner talks about the death of his third wife, [[Nerine Kidd]], who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999 after suffering from alcoholism.

''Mind Meld'' was produced to advertise Shatner's personal website. Filming took place at Nimoy's home on September 5, 2001, and [[Billy West]] narrated the [[title sequence]]. The film's title refers to a fictional practice in ''Star Trek''<U+2014>a [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Mind melds|mind meld]] is a [[Telepathy|telepathic]] link that [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]] are able to create with other organisms. ''Mind Meld'' was released for sale on Shatner's website on November 6, 2001, coinciding with the release of the [[director's cut]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. ''Mind Meld'' attracted some notoriety because of an unintended sound in one scene that became a popular subject of [[flatulence humor]] among [[Star Trek fandom|''Star Trek'' fans]] and on [[morning zoo]] radio programs. Shatner denied being the source of this sound in multiple interviews; he and ''Mind Meld'''s director, Peter Jaysen, attributed it to equipment on set.

The film received mixed reviews from critics. Scott Brown of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an "F", and stated that the only people likely to watch the film other than extreme ''Star Trek'' fans are people interested in hearing Shatner's supposed [[flatulence]]. Laurence Lerman of ''Video Business'' praised the film for not "rehash[ing] anecdotes that have long been staples of Star Trek conventions and behind-the-scenes memoirs",<ref name=Video/> and instead for dealing with such topics as alcoholism, career difficulties, and conflicts on the set of ''Star Trek''.

The film focuses on the effects ''Star Trek'' had on the lives of Shatner and Nimoy,<ref>Greenberger (2012), p. 220.</ref> with each actor interviewing the other about his fame. The pair also discuss interactions between themselves and others on the set of ''Star Trek'', including conflicts.<ref name=Times/> Both Shatner and Nimoy describe having had strained relationships with [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of ''Star Trek'',<ref name=Video/> and attest to other members of the ''Original Series'' cast disliking Shatner.<ref name=Talk/> Only one of these cast members is referred to by name: [[Nichelle Nichols]], who portrayed [[Nyota Uhura]].<ref name=Province/> "I never fully comprehended what it was that was bothering them", says Shatner.<ref name=Talk/>

Both men describe ''Star Trek'' as having put personal pressures on them that negatively affected their family lives.<ref name=Guardian/> The conversation is mostly guided by Shatner, who prompts Nimoy to discuss issues he had regarding the legitimacy of consistently portraying an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], and other struggles with his acting career at the time.<ref name=Talk/> "It took me a while," Nimoy says, "but I got rid of all that anger when I realized that I never had to worry about work ever since ''Star Trek'' went on the air."<ref name=Buckman/> Nimoy reveals that he was an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] at the time of the original ''Star Trek'' series<U+2014>something that was not publicly known before ''Mind Meld''.<ref name=Mirror/> He developed "a major drinking habit, probably during the second or third year" of the series, he says, and had his secretary bring him alcohol in paper cups at the end of each day of filming. Nimoy suggests that he became dependent on alcohol because of the deterioration of his marriage to [[Sandra Zober]], his first wife. He says that, since divorcing Zober in 1987 and marrying actress [[Susan Bay]] in 1988, he has been a [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]].<ref name=Mirror/>

Shatner says that acting in ''Star Trek'' was "life-consuming" and left him "barely any time for family", and that this was the reason for his divorce from Gloria Rand, his first wife.<ref name=Mirror>{{Cite news|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|title=Bar Trek: Search for Spock|author=Mackenzie, Drew|page=4|date=October 11, 2001|location=[[London]]}}</ref> He describes a subsequent succession of sexual partners,<ref name=Talk/> including, he says, ''Star Trek'' actresses.<ref name=Mirror/> He also talks about the death of his father, Joseph Shatner,<ref name=Edmonton/> and of his third wife, [[Nerine Kidd]], who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999, losing a battle with alcoholism.<ref name=Record>{{Cite news|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|title=Jim Beam Me Up Scotty: Spock Tells of Booze Battle|date=October 31, 2001|page=20|location=[[Glasgow]]}}</ref> Shatner recalls that Nimoy had expressed concern about Kidd's alcoholism and warned him about marrying her.<ref name=Record/> Another topic is Nimoy's [[fine-art photography]], which deals with spirituality and sensuality.

Around 52 minutes and 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner is talking about the other ''Original Series'' actors disliking him,<ref name=Talk/> he shifts in his chair and a sound evocative of [[flatulence]] is audible. This sound, apparently unnoticed by the filmmakers,<ref name=Dawson79/> was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the ''[[New York Post]]'' on October 10, 2001.<ref name=York/> Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed that it came from Shatner.<ref name=Buckman>{{Cite news|work=[[New York Post]]|title=Well Excuse Me, Scotty|date=October 10, 2001|author=Buckman, Adam|page=119|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref> This scene became a popular subject of [[flatulence humor]] among [[Star Trek fandom|''Star Trek'' fans]]<ref name=Dawson79/> and on [[morning zoo]] radio programs.<ref name=Talk>{{Cite web|title=Mind Meld|author=Gross, G.

[[Howard Stern]] played the sound on [[The Howard Stern Show|his radio show]] several times,<ref name=Dawson79/> including when Shatner appeared on the show to promote his upcoming television series ''[[Iron Chef USA]]''<ref name=York/> on November 13, 2001.<ref name=Dawson80>Dawson (2006), p. 80.</ref> When Stern asked about the sound, Shatner said it had been produced by the [[Boom operator (media)|boom operator]].<ref name=Dawson80/> A similar claim was made on Shatner's website, where the noise was attributed to a squeaky [[Jib (camera)|jib]].<ref name=Talk/> On [[Conan O'Brien]]'s ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night]]'' program on November 14,<ref name=Dawson80/> Shatner called it "outrageous" that Buckman should assume him to be the source of the sound rather than Nimoy. O'Brien responded, "You're the captain! You outrank him! It's your responsibility!"<ref name=York/> Pressed further by O'Brien on the sound's provenance, Shatner suggested that it may have been a dog bark or a bird call.<ref name=York/> According to Jaysen, the sound did not emanate from Shatner, and was most likely caused by cables rubbing against each other while a camera moved.<ref name=New/> "It was probably some machine that nobody heard", Shatner said in a September 2002 interview. "The controversy is over."<ref name=Post>{{Cite news|work=[[New York Post]]|date=September 21, 2002|title=Capt. Kirk Sees Trek Reality|page=10|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref>

Jim Dawson devoted an entire chapter of his 2006 ''Modern History of the Fart'' to Shatner's alleged flatulence in ''Mind Meld'', which he compares to the sound of someone stepping on a [[tribble]].<ref name=Dawson79/>{{efn|This is a ''Star Trek'' in-joke; in the ''Star Trek'' universe, tribbles are small, hairy extraterrestrials that reproduce rapidly.<ref>Robinson & Bauer (2011), p. 447.</ref>}} G. Noel Gross of [[DVD Talk]] compared the excitement over this sound to that evinced by adolescent boys watching pornography, and compared the level of scrutiny devoted to the scene to that received by the [[Zapruder film]] of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy assassination]].<ref name=Talk/>

Sarah Sloboda of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that ''Mind Meld'' "provides a genuine glimpse of the lives of the stars shadowed by the roles that defined their public [[persona]]s, and the mutual experience that binds them as friends".<ref name=Times/> Gross praised the [[video quality]], but criticized the DVD functionality and features. He also wrote that "even in the heavier parts of this conversation, there's a warmth and comradery there that's rife with good humor".<ref name=Talk/> Scott Brown of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an F, saying that the only people likely to watch the film other than extreme ''Star Trek'' fans are people interested in hearing the sound alleged to be Shatner's flatulence, which Brown said can be clearly heard. He called the film "seemingly interminable" and said the discussion between Shatner and Nimoy shows that they "rival black holes in sheer self-absorption".<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Brown, Scott|title=Space Oddity|date=November 9, 2001|issue=624|page=88|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref> According to John Henzell, writing for ''[[The Press]]'' of New Zealand, ''Mind Meld''{{'}}s trailer took its subject matter so seriously that it became comical.<ref name=Press/>

Vern Perry of the ''[[Orange County Register]]'' called the film fascinating, writing that it skilfully combined humor and earnestness. He wrote that it was moving to see the two actors talk about their personal lives with such vulnerability<U+2014>particularly when Nimoy discusses his experiences with alcoholism.<ref name=Orange>{{Cite news|work=[[Orange County Register]]|author=Perry, Vern|page=E8|date=April 27, 2002|title=Japan's 'Rashomon' a Classic|location=[[Santa Ana, California]]}}</ref> Greg Stacy of ''[[OC Weekly]]'' reported being "thoroughly charmed" by the film, and called "the affection between [Shatner and Nimoy] obvious and touching."<ref name=Weekly/>
