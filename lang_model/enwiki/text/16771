The '''1985 Rajneeshee assassination plot''' was a [[conspiracy]] by high-ranking followers of [[Osho|Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] (now known as Osho) to [[assassination|assassinate]] [[Charles H. Turner (attorney)|Charles Turner]], the then-[[United States Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the District of Oregon|District of Oregon]].  Osho's chief lieutenant, [[Ma Anand Sheela]], assembled the [[hit squad]] after Turner was appointed to investigate illegal activity at [[Rajneeshpuram]].  Turner headed an investigation into the [[1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack]] in [[The Dalles, Oregon]], and also investigated charges of [[wiretapping]], [[Illegal immigration|immigration fraud]] and [[sham marriage]]s.

The hit squad included: Sally-Anne Croft, [[Chief Financial Officer]] of Rajneeshpuram; Susan Hagan, head of security at Rajneeshpuram, Catherine Jane Stork, who bought weapons and silencers and volunteered to be the actual killer; Phyllis McCarthy, fourth-in-command of Rajneeshpuram; and co-conspirators Alma Potter and Richard Langford.  The conspirators obtained false identification to purchase handguns out-of-state, stalked Turner, and planned to kill him near his workplace in [[Portland, Oregon]].  The assassination plot was uncovered as a result of an investigation by federal law enforcement into the [[bioterrorism|bioterror]] attack in The Dalles, and Turner was never harmed.

Prosecution of the conspirators began in 1990, when a federal grand jury brought indictments against several of the key players.  Some had fled the country, and [[extradition]] proceedings against the perpetrators and subsequent prosecution and conviction was not completed for sixteen years.  The final conspirator was convicted in 2006, when Catherine Jane Stork agreed to return to the [[United States]] from [[Germany]] in order to be allowed to visit her ill son in [[Australia]].  The perpetrators received sentences ranging from five years probation to five years in [[federal prison]].
