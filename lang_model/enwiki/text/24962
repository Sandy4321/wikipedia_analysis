'''Harold Richard Naragon''' (born [[October 1]], [[1928]] in [[Zanesville, Ohio]]) is a former [[catcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played for the [[Cleveland Indians]] (1951, 1954-1959) and [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators & Minnesota Twins]] (1959-1962). He batted left-handed and threw right-handed.

In a 10-season career, Naragon was a .266 hitter with six [[home run]]s and 87 [[run batted in|RBI]] in 424 [[games played]].

Naragon was winding up his major league career as a non-power hitting backup catcher, and usually platooned with [[Jim Hegan]] at Cleveland and with [[Earl Battey]] for the Senators and Twins. His most productive season came in 1959, when he posted career-highs in games (85) and [[batting average|average]] (.247) while dividing his playing time with Cleveland and Washington. He also caught for the Indians in the [[1954 World Series]] against the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]].

Following his playing career, Naragon was the [[bullpen]] [[coach (baseball)|coach]] for the Minnesota Twins and [[Detroit Tigers]] from 1963-69. He became closely allied with pitching coach [[Johnny Sain]] and twice was released in the offseason when Sain clashed with his managers in Minnesota ([[Sam Mele]]) and Detroit ([[Mayo Smith]]).
