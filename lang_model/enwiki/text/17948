==Geography==
'''Sombrero''', also known as '''Hat Island''', is the northernmost island of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in position 18<U+00B0> 60'N, 63<U+00B0> 40'W. It lies 55 km or 34 miles north west of [[Anguilla]] across the Dog and Prickly Pear Passage. The distance to [[Dog Island, Anguilla|Dog Island]], the closest island of Anguilla, is 39 km or 24 miles. Sombrero is 1.5 km or 0.9 miles long north-south, and 0.4 km or 0.25 miles wide. The land area is 0.38 km<sup>2</sup> or 95 acres. Originally, when viewed from the sea, the island had the shape of a [[Sombrero|sombrero hat]] but mining operations have left the island with precipitous sides and a relatively flat top which is 12 m or 40 feet above sea level. The surface of the island is rough, and vegetation is sparse.

This mining operation yielded some 3000 [[ton]]s of phosphate a year by 1870. By 1890, the phosphate reserves had been exhausted.

==History==
As a result of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in [[1714]], Sombrero passed into the hands of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]. In [[1814]], and again in [[1825]], a British [[Geology|geologist]] surveyed the island and found that it abounded in [[Guano|phosphate of lime (guano)]] and this was reported to the British Government. In 1856 the [[Usa|Americans]] claimed the island, and in a very short period of time quarried 100,000 tons of phosphate to resuscitate the exhausted lands of the [[Southern United States|Southern States]], the British then intervened and demanded compensation. The United States claim to the island was settled in Britain's favour in [[1867]].

Sombrero, lying in the route of shipping from England to [[South-America|South]] and [[Central america|Central America]], lay in an area with many hazards and in [[1848]] the [[ADMIRALTY|Admiralty]] was asked to install a light on it. On [[June 30]] [[1859]] the [[Royal Mail Steamer|Royal Mail Steam]] [[Packet ship|Packet]] Company's ship ''Paramatta'' was wrecked on her maiden voyage on [[Anegada Island#Horseshoe Reef|Horseshoe Reef]] <ref>The Illustrated London News, vol. 47, no. 1323, p. 17-18.</ref> which resulted in another request to the Admiralty. The [[lighthouse]] was then built and first exhibited its light on the evening of [[1 January]], [[1868]].

From the early 1870s until [[1885]] a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] mining engineer, Thomas Corfield, was [[Management|Superintendent]] of Sombrero. His duties at Sombrero were to organise means of conveying the guano to a spot which was convenient for loading the [[lighter (barge)|lighters]] to take the guano to the ships lying off the Island, see to the making of [[derrick]]s and engine houses, arrange for the laying of the [[tram]] lines for the wagons, which were loaded at the quarries. The guano was just piled in dumps near the engine houses and derricks. There was no semblance of a [[port]] and no beach. There was also the provision of labour. The black workers were picked up from various islands and lived in wooden huts during their term of service. Stores and various supplies were obtained from a merchant at [[Philipsburg, Netherlands Antilles|Philipsburg]], [[Sint Maarten|St. Martins]], a Mr Nesbit. Supplies were taken to the island in the Company's [[schooner]], the ''Logos''. This little ship was also used to take the black labourers to and from their homes up and down the other islands. The superintendent's house was a wooden [[bungalow]] near the middle of the island and round it were grouped the quarters of the technicians, store keepers, light house keepers and other wooden buildings. On the side opposite to the main buildings was a small building used as his drawing office etc. There was a wide [[veranda]] round the house and he used to live there with his family, except near the [[hurricane season]].<ref>Notes by Thomas Joseph Corfield - Made July 1957.</ref>

In [[1890]] the phosphate works on the island were abandoned and by [[1893]], the lighthouse had come under the authority of the [[Board of trade|British Board of Trade]], later the [[Department for Transport|Department of Transport]]. Administration of the light was carried out by [[Trinity House]]. In 1931 the old light system was changed and improved to 200,000 candle power and the tower received its first major repair as the basement was encased in concrete. On [[20 July]], [[1962]], after the destruction caused by [[Hurricane Donna]] in 1960, the present lighthouse was put into operation and the old tower demolished on [[28 July]], [[1962]].<ref>A Visit to Sombrero by P. Bannis, Government Information Service Bulletin Vol I, No 2, July 1978, which quoted from the writings of Mr. William Hodge in the Sombrero Visitors' Book</ref>  The lighthouse is located near the centre of the island, and reaches a height of almost 51 meters or 166 feet above sea level. It protects ships passing from the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea through the [[Anegada Passage]]. Full responsibility for the light passed from Trinity House to the Anguillan Government on [[1 December]] [[2001]].<ref>Written Answers - House of Lords:Anguilla:Sombero Island Lighthouse ([[21 February]] [[2005]])</ref> <ref>Written Answers - House of Lords:Anguilla:Sombero Island Lighthouse (21 February 2005)</ref>

==Population==
Until recently the only inhabitants where the staff of the [[lighthouse]] but the light was automated in 2002 and now the island is uninhabited. The only visitors are the occasional fishermen and biologists engaged in fieldwork.

==Jurisdiction==
Sombrero comes under the jurisdiction of the Government of Anguilla.

==Wildlife==
The island is noted for the endemic Sombrero black lizard ''[[Ameiva corvina]]'' , a widespread and easily seen species on the island. A recently discovered dwarf gecko ''Spaerodactylus'' sp. may be endemic and has been tentatively named Sombrero dwarf gecko. The lizard ''[[Anolis gingivinus]]'' is also found on the island. The surrounding waters are feeding areas for [[hawksbill turtle]]s.
Sombrero is also supports internationally important numbers of the following seabirds.
* [[Masked Booby]]s ''Sula dactylatra'': 27 pairs (54 + birds, 4% of Caribbean population) 2002
* [[Brown Booby|Brown Boobies]] ''Sula leucogaster'': 386 pairs (772 + birds, 5% of Caribbean population) 1999
* [[Bridled Tern]]s ''Sterna anaethetus'': 270 pairs (540 birds, 4% of Caribbean population) 1998
* [[Brown Noddy]]s ''Anous stolidus'': 700 pairs (1400 birds, 5% of Caribbean population) 1998
* [[Sooty Tern]]s ''Onychoprion fuscata'' <ref>UK Overseas Territories Conservation Forum. Ramsar Information Sheet: UK45006</ref>
