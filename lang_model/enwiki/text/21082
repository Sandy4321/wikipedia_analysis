'''Bobcat''' is a rank attainable by a Scout in the [[Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scout]] division of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA), and ranks above [[Tiger (Boy Scouts of America)|Tiger]] and below [[Wolf (Boy Scouts of America)|Wolf]].

The ''Bob Cat'' rank was introduced in 1938 as the entry-level badge for a new Cub.  The original pin was for wear only on civilian clothing.  The rank changed to ''Bobcat'' around 1950, and the pin was approved for uniform wear in 1959.  The cloth badge was introduced in 1972.  Boys graduating from Tiger Cubs or joining at the second grade or above earn the Bobcat badge<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/cubscout/bobcat.html | title = Cub Scout Bobcat Rank | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 27 | accessyear =2006 }}</ref>.
