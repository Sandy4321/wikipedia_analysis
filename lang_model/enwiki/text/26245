'''''Ulysses''''' was a 332 GRT  [[coastal trading vessel|coaster]] that was built in 1941 as '''''Empire Creek''''' by J Pollock & Sons, [[Faversham]], [[United Kingdom]]. She was built for the [[Ministry of War Transport]] (MoWT). ''Empire Creek'' survived being bombed shortly after entering service. In 1946, she was sold into merchant service and renamed '''''Springcreek'''''. Further sales in 1948 and 1951 saw her named '''''Goldcreek''''' and '''''Milborne''''' respectively. In 1964, she was sold to [[Greece]] and renamed '''''Georgios'''''. In 1978, she was sold to [[Panama]] and renamed ''Ulysses'', serving until she ran aground near [[Naples]], [[Italy]] in 1979 and was wrecked.
