'''Lilian Mary Faithfull''' [[CBE]] (12 March 1865&nbsp;<U+2013> 2 May 1952) was an English teacher, headmistress, women's rights advocate, magistrate, social worker and humanitarian. She was one of the "[[Steamboat ladies]]" who were part of the struggle for women to gain university education.<ref name="Adams1996">{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Pauline|title=Somerville for women: an Oxford college, 1879<U+2013>1993|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EiGfAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920179-2|page=61}}</ref>

From 1889 until 1894 she was a lecturer at [[Royal Holloway College]] and then joined [[King's College London]], where she succeeded [[Cornelia Schmitz]] as vice-principal of the Ladies Department for the next 13 years, a position she regarded as the happiest of her career. She was principal of [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]] from 1907 until 1922. In 1920, she became Justice of the Peace for [[Cheltenham]], becoming one of the first women magistrates in England. Faithfull started the organisation that is now Lilian Faithfull Homes in Cheltenham, and she spent the last few months of her life in the care of one of the homes, Faithfull House, until her death in 1952.

==Early life and education==
Lilian Faithfull was born in [[Hoddesdon]], Hertfordshire, in 1865. Her father, Francis Faithfull, was a clerk at the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors]]. Her mother, Edith Lloyd, stayed home with eight children while also writing a ''History of England'' and magazine articles. Lilian was the second youngest of the six girls and two boys. She lived in an upper-middle class country house in Hertfordshire and was educated at The Grange in Hoddesdon (the only girl at the time), and later at home by her mother and [[governess]]es.<ref name="ODNB">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48486?&docPos=7&backToResults=|title=Lilian Faithfull|publisher=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] {{subscription}}|accessdate=25 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=Gorham>{{cite book|last=Gorham|first=Deborah|title=The Victorian Girl and the Feminine Ideal|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-62326-1|url=http://books.google.be/books?id=cMTiNlFYLncC&pg=PA162&dq=%22lilian+faithfull%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=02SfUZKhEqfV0QXK6YGoDg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22faithfull%22&f=false}}</ref> [[Emily Faithfull]], an early [[women's rights]] activist, was her cousin.<ref name="ODNB"/> Both of Faithfull's parents were opinionated about issues such as femininity and social class, but were not radicals.<ref name=Gorham/>

Faithfull entered [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] of [[Oxford University]] in 1883, just four years after it was established. She was the first captain of the women's hockey team and the college tennis champion, and graduated with a first in English in 1887.<ref name=Hollingsworth/> She later claimed an [[ad eundem degree]] from [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in 1905.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Between 1887 and 1888, Faithfull taught at [[Oxford High School (Oxford)|Oxford High School]], and was secretary to the principal of Somerville, Madeleine Shaw Lefevre.<ref name="ODNB"/> From 1889 until 1894 she was a lecturer at [[Royal Holloway College]] and then joined [[King's College London]], where she succeeded [[Cornelia Schmitz]] as vice-principal of the Ladies Department for the next 13 years.<ref name=Gorham/><ref name=Hollingsworth/><ref name=Batson>{{cite book|last=Batson|first=Judy G.|title=Her Oxford|year=2008|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|isbn=978-0-8265-1610-7|pages=64<U+2013>65|url=http://books.google.be/books?id=_stU5CyTGKEC&pg=PA341&lpg=PA341&dq=%22lilian+mary+faithfull%22&source=bl&ots=nx-pg85Rb1&sig=uE4RhJHicUd7ZDow4prl5OQGBWs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LVWfUfz_HMS50QX4kYAw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22faithfull%22&f=false}}</ref> It was here that [[Virginia Woolf]] met her, and Faithfull described her position as "one of the happiest educational posts for women in England".<ref name="ODNB"/>

In 1890, Faithfull suggested that women who had competed for Oxford or Cambridge in intercollegiate sports should be awarded special badges like their male counterparts. This was implemented in 1891 and marked the start of the [[Blue (university sport)|Lady Blue]].<ref name=Hollingsworth>{{cite book|last=Hollingsworth|first=Kent|title=The Kentucky Thoroughbred|year=2010|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-3898-5|page=44|url=http://books.google.be/books?id=IWrn0oYksP8C&pg=PA44&dq=%22lilian+faithfull%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=02SfUZKhEqfV0QXK6YGoDg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22lilian%20faithfull%22&f=false}}</ref> Along with [[Margaret Gilliland]] and [[Sara Burstall]], Faithfull believed that the important household topics of cookery, laundry and hygiene should feature as scientific subjects on the school curriculum.<ref name="Clendinning2004">{{cite book|last=Clendinning|first=Anne|title=Demons and Domesticity: Women and the English Gas Industry, 1889<U+2013>1939|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4sMtYagZ3_EC&pg=PA110|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0692-5|page=110}}</ref> She wanted to get rid of the distinction between the professional woman and the women studying "home science".<ref name="Clendinning2004"/>

{{quotation|"In recent years there has been a widespread movement to bring the education of our girls into relation with their work as home-makers. The old 'blue-stocking type', who prided herself on not knowing how to sew or mend, and who thought cooking menial and beneath her, no longer appeals to anyone&nbsp;...
