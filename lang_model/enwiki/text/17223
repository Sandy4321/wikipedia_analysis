The '''Southern Cross Expedition''', officially known as the '''British Antarctic Expedition 1898&ndash;1900''', was the first British venture of the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]], and was the forerunner of the much more celebrated expeditions of [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and [[Ernest Shackleton]] during the following decade. It was the brainchild of the Norwegian-born, half-British explorer and schoolmaster [[Carsten Borchgrevink]]. He envisaged a pioneering mission that would [[overwinter]] at [[Cape Adare]] on the [[Antarctic]] mainland before making the first investigations of the continent's interior, which was then wholly uncharted.  The entire scheme was financed by the British magazine publisher [[George Newnes|Sir George Newnes]]. 

In February 1899 the expedition's ship ''[[Southern Cross]]'' landed Borchgrevink and a shore party of ten at Cape Adare, the north-west extremity of the [[Ross Sea]], where a camp was erected. During the following months the group experienced the full hostility of an Antarctic winter. While a programme of scientific work was carried out, opportunities for inland exploration were severely restricted by the mountainous and glaciated terrain surrounding the base. During this period the expedition's zoologist, Nicolai Hansen, fell ill with an intestinal disorder and died. In January 1900 ''Southern Cross'' took the party southward to explore the Ross Sea and, following the route taken by [[James Clark Ross]] in 1840, reached the [[Ross Ice Shelf|Great Ice Barrier]].  On 16 February Borchgrevink and two companions ascended the Barrier, then sledged approximately {{convert|10|mi|km}} southward, to set a new [[Farthest South]] record latitude at 78<U+00B0>50'S.

On its return to England the expedition was coolly received by London's geographical establishment which was resentful of the pre-emption of a role they envisaged for their own [[Discovery Expedition|National Antarctic (Discovery) Expedition]]. There were also mutterings about the quality of Borchgrevink's leadership, and the limited amounts of scientific information obtained. However, the expedition had recorded several pioneering achievements, being the first to overwinter on the continent and establish man-made structures on the mainland. It also made the first use in the Antarctic of dogs and sledges, made the first ascent of the Great Ice Barrier, and set a new Farthest South record. Despite these successes Borchgrevink never achieved heroic status equal to that of Scott and Shackleton, and his expedition was soon forgotten in the excitement of later events. However, among those who recognised its contribution to Antarctic exploration was [[Roald Amundsen]], conqueror of the [[South Pole]] in 1911. Amundsen used the location of Borchgrevink's Barrier landing as the base camp for his own attack on the Pole, and later wrote: "We must acknowledge that, by ascending the Barrier, Borchgrevink opened the way to the south, and threw aside the greatest obstacle to the expeditions that followed".<ref name= Amundsen>Amundsen Vol I pp. 25&ndash;26</ref>

==Background==
[[Image:Newnes-Spy-1894.jpg|thumb|upright|A cartoon depiction of Sir George Newnes]]

Born in Oslo in 1864, Carsten Borchgrevink emigrated to Australia in 1888, where he worked on survey teams in the interior before accepting a provincial schoolteaching appointment in [[New South Wales]].<ref name = adb>{{cite web|title= Borchgrevink, Carsten Egeberg (1864&ndash;1934)|url= http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070353b.htm|publisher = Australian Dictionary of Biography Online Edition|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 10 August}}</ref> In 1894&ndash;95 he joined a commercial expedition, led by [[Henryk Bull]] in the whaler ''Antarctic'', which penetrated Antarctic waters and reached Cape Adare, the western portal to the [[Ross Sea]]. A party including Bull and Borchgrevink briefly landed there, becoming the first men to set foot on the Antarctic continent, if the 1821 claim of American sealer [[John Davis (sealer)|John Davis]] is discounted.<ref name = ForgottenEx>{{cite web|title= Norway's Forgotten Explorer|url= http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/english/forgotten-explorer/|publisher= Antarctic Heritage Trust|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 10 August}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= An Antarctic Timeline|url= http://www.south-pole.com/p0000052.htm|publisher= www.south-pole.com|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 29 August}}</ref> They also visited [[Possession Islands|Possession Island]] in the Ross Sea, leaving a message in a tin box as proof of their journey.<ref name= SouthPole3>{{cite web|title= Antarctic Explorers &ndash; Carsten Borchgrevink|url= http://www.south-pole.com/p0000087.htm|publisher= www.south-pole.com|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 10 August}} p. 3</ref>  Borchgrevink was convinced that the Cape Adare location, with its huge [[seabird colony|penguin rookery]] providing a ready supply of fresh food and [[blubber]], could serve as a base at which a future expedition could [[overwinter]] and subsequently explore the Antarctic interior.<ref name = anta-canterbury-intro>{{cite web|title = The Southern Cross Expedition|url= http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html|publisher= www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 10 August}} (Introduction)</ref><ref name= Preston14>Preston, pp. 14&ndash;16</ref>

Determined that he would lead such an expedition himself, Borchgrevink spent much of the next three years attempting to gain financial backing in Australia and England. Despite some encouragement from the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), whose International Congress he addressed in 1895, he was initially unsuccessful.<ref name =SouthPole1>{{cite web|title= Antarctic Explorers &ndash; Carsten Borchgrevink|url= http://www.south-pole.com/p0000087.htm|publisher= www.south-pole.com|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 10 August}} p. 1</ref> The RGS was in fact harbouring plans of its own for a large-scale National Antarctic Expedition<ref>This would in due course become the [[Discovery Expedition]], led by Captain Scott.</ref> and was in search of funds; Borchgrevink was regarded by RGS president [[Sir Clements Markham]] as a foreign interloper and a rival for funding.<ref name = Preston14/>  However, Borchgrevink eventually managed to persuade publisher Sir [[George Newnes]] (whose business rival [[Alfred Harmsworth]] was backing Markham's venture) to meet the full cost of his expedition, some <U+00A3>40,000,<ref>Jones, p. 59</ref> equivalent to approximately <U+00A3>3&nbsp;million (around US$4&nbsp;million) in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title= Measuringworth|url=  http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/|publisher= The Institute for the Measurement of Worth|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 19 August}}</ref>  This gift infuriated Markham and the RGS, since Newnes's donation, had it come their way, would have been enough "to get the National Expedition on its legs".<ref name = SouthPole2>{{cite web|title= Antarctic Explorers &ndash; Carsten Borchgrevink|url= http://www.south-pole.com/p0000087.htm|publisher= www.south-pole.com|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 10 August}} p. 2</ref>

Newnes made one stipulation: Borchgrevink's expedition must sail under the British flag, and be styled the British Antarctic Expedition. Borchgrevink readily agreed to this, even though only two of the entire expedition party were British.<ref name = Jones59>Jones, pp. 59&ndash;60. Another member of the shore party, [[Louis Bernacchi]], was Australian; the remainder were all Scandinavian.</ref> This increased the hostility and contempt of Markham,<ref name = Crane74>Crane, p. 74</ref> who chastised RGS librarian [[Hugh Robert Mill]] for attending the Southern Cross Expedition launch.<ref name= Jones59/>
There, Mill had toasted the success of the expedition in stirring terms, calling it "a reproach to human enterprise" that there were parts of the earth that man had never attempted to reach. He hoped that this reproach would be lifted through "the munificence of Sir George Newnes and the courage of Mr Borchgrevink".<ref>{{cite web|author= Borchgrevink, Carsten|title= ''First on the Antarctic Continent''|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=Southern+Cross+Expedition&source=web&ots=VRxj1EM4Dl&sig=OxChuy-HeNPhHXJA0kMm3n26jio&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result#PPP1,M1|publisher= George Newnes Ltd|year= 1901|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 11 August}} p. 25</ref>

===Expedition objectives===
When planning his expedition, Borchgrevink appears to have entertained a mixture of commercial, scientific and geographical objectives. He considered forming a company to exploit the extensive [[guano]] deposits that he had observed during his 1894&ndash;95 voyage, but this came to nothing.<ref name = anta-canterbury-intro/> In numerous addresses to scientific societies, he stressed the extent of work that could be carried out by a resident expedition, including the possibility of establishing the location of the [[South Magnetic Pole]].<ref name = SouthPole1/> The team of scientists that Borchgrevink eventually appointed, although generally inexperienced, covered a range of disciplines including [[magnetism]], [[meteorology]], [[biology]], [[zoology]], [[taxidermy]] and [[cartography]].<ref name= anta-canterbury-people>{{cite web|title = The Southern Cross Expedition|url= http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html|publisher= www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 10 August}}Equipment and Personnel</ref> The hope also existed, at the planning stage, that the expedition's scientific achievements could be capped by spectacular geographical discoveries, even an attempt to reach the geographical [[South Pole]] itself.<ref name= anta-canterbury-intro/> With no knowledge of the continent's geography, they could not be aware that the site of the base at Cape Adare would rule out any serious exploration of the Antarctic interior.<ref name = ForgottenExpedition>{{cite web|title = The Forgotten Expedition|url= http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/english/forgotten-expedition/|publisher = Antarctic Heritage Trust|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 10 August}}</ref><ref>Crane, pp. 74&ndash;75</ref>

===Ship===

For his expedition's ship, Borchgrevink looked to his native Norway. Here he was able to find and purchase a steam whaler, ''Pollux'', that had been built in the yard of the Norwegian shipbuilder [[Colin Archer]].<ref name = Borch10>{{cite web|author= Borchgrevink, Carsten|title= ''First on the Antarctic Continent''|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=Southern+Cross+Expedition&source=web&ots=VRxj1EM4Dl&sig=OxChuy-HeNPhHXJA0kMm3n26jio&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result#PPP1,M1|publisher= George Newnes Ltd|year= 1901|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 11 August}}pp. 10&ndash;11</ref> Archer had designed and built [[Fridtjof Nansen|Nansen's]] ship [[Fram|''Fram'']], which had recently returned unscathed from its long drift in the northern polar ocean during Nansen's "Farthest North" expedition, 1893&ndash;96.<ref>Jones, p. 63</ref> ''Pollux'', which Borchgrevink immediately renamed ''Southern Cross'',<ref name = ForgottenExpedition/> was [[barque|barque-rigged]], 520&nbsp;tons [[gross tonnage|gross]], and {{convert|146|ft|m}} overall length.<ref name = Borch10/> Engines were designed to Borchgrevink's specification, and fitted before the ship left Norway.<ref name= Borch10/> Although Markham cast doubts on her seaworthiness, perhaps to thwart Borchgrevink's departure,<ref>Preston, p. 16</ref> the ship fulfilled all that was required of her in Antarctic waters. Like several of the historic polar ships, her post-expedition life was short.<ref>{{cite web|title= Ships of the Polar Explorers|url= http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/antarctic_ships/fram.htm|publisher= Cool Antarctica|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 11 August}} Fate of ''Nimrod'' and ''Aurora''</ref> She was sold to the Newfoundland Sealing Company, and in April 1914 was lost with all hands in a storm off the Newfoundland coast.<ref>Paine, p. 131</ref>

===Personnel===
The ship's company, under Captain Bernard Jensen, consisted of 19&nbsp;Norwegian seamen and one Swedish steward. Jensen was an experienced ice navigator in Arctic and Antarctic waters, and had been with Borchgrevink on the ''Antarctic'' voyage with Bull in 1894&ndash;95.<ref name = Borch13>{{cite web|author= Borchgrevink, Carsten|title= ''First on the Antarctic Continent''|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=Southern+Cross+Expedition&source=web&ots=VRxj1EM4Dl&sig=OxChuy-HeNPhHXJA0kMm3n26jio&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result#PPP1,M1|publisher= George Newnes Ltd|year= 1901|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 11 August}}pp. 13&ndash;19</ref>   The shore party of ten, who were to winter at Cape Adare, consisted of Borchgrevink, five scientists, a medical officer, a cook who also served as a general assistant, and two dog drivers. Of this party, five were Norwegians, two were English, one was Australian and two, the dog experts, were [[Sami people|Samis]] from Northern Norway, sometimes described in expedition accounts as [[Lapp]]s or "Finns".<ref name= anta-canterbury-people>{{cite web|title = The Southern Cross Expedition|url= http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html|publisher= www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 10 August}}Equipment and Personnel</ref><ref name= ForgottenEx/>
[[Image:Borchgrevink.jpg|thumb|left|Carsten Borchgrevink, expedition leader]] 
Among the scientists was the Tasmanian [[Louis Bernacchi]], who had studied magnetism and meteorology at the [[Melbourne Observatory]]. He had been appointed to the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]], 1897&ndash;99, but had been unable to take up his post.<ref>According to Borchgrevink, p. 15, the expedition's ship, ''[[Belgica]]'', had failed to call at Melbourne on its way south, leaving Bernacchi stranded.</ref> Bernacchi then travelled to London, on the chance of a place on Borchgrevink's scientific staff.<ref name= Borch13/> His chronicle of the Southern Cross Expedition, which was published in 1901,<ref>''To the South Polar Regions'', Hurst & Blackett, London 1901</ref> was critical of aspects of Borchgrevink's leadership, but defensive of the expedition's scientific achievements.<ref name= Crane74/>  Just over a year after his return, Bernacchi went back to Antarctica as physicist on Captain Scott's Discovery Expedition.<ref>Crane, p. 108</ref> Another of Borchgrevink's men who was to see further service during the Discovery Expedition was Englishman [[William Colbeck (seaman)|William Colbeck]], an experienced seaman who held a lieutenant's commission in the Royal Naval Reserve.<ref name= Borch13/> As preparation for the Southern Cross Expedition he had taken a course in magnetism at [[Kew Observatory]].<ref name= Borch13/> From 1902&ndash;04 he had been in command of ''Discovery'''s relief ship ''Morning''.<ref>Crane, pp. 232&ndash;33</ref>

Borchgrevink's assistant zoologist was Hugh Blackwell Evans, a vicar's son from [[Bristol]], who had spent three years on a cattle ranch in Canada and had also been on a [[seal hunting|sealing]] voyage to the [[Kerguelen Islands]].<ref name= ForgottenEx/>  The chief zoologist was Nikolai Hansen, a graduate from the [[University of Oslo|University of Christiana]], who died during the expedition leaving a wife and also a baby daughter born after he left for the Antarctic.<ref name= ForgottenEx/> Also in the shore party was Herlof Klovstad, the expedition's medical officer, whose previous appointment had been to a lunatic asylum in [[Bergen]].<ref name= Borch13/>  Klovstad died shortly after his return from the Antarctic.<ref name= ForgottenEx/> The others were Anton Fougner, scientific assistant and general handyman; Kolbein Ellifsen, cook and general assistant; and the two Sami dog-handlers, Per Savio and Ole Must.<ref name= ForgottenEx/> Savio and Must, at 21 and 20 years of age respectively, were the youngest of the party.<ref name = ForgottenEx/> Borchgrevink later described Savio as "well-known for his faithful character, hardihood and intelligence".<ref name= Borch13/>

==Voyage==
===Cape Adare===
[[Image:Borchgrevink Hut.jpg|thumb|right|Borchgrevink Hut, Cape Adare: "Fifteen feet square, lashed down by cables to the rocky shore", according to Louis Bernacchi]]
''Southern Cross'' left London for [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], on 23 August 1898, after inspection by [[King George V of the United Kingdom|HRH the Duke of York]] (the future King George V), who presented a [[Union Jack|Union Flag]].<ref>{{cite web|author= Borchgrevink, Carsten|title= ''First on the Antarctic Continent''|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=Southern+Cross+Expedition&source=web&ots=VRxj1EM4Dl&sig=OxChuy-HeNPhHXJA0kMm3n26jio&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result#PPP1,M1|publisher= George Newnes Ltd|year= 1901|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 11 August}}p. 22</ref>  Along with the expedition's personnel, equipment and provisions she was carrying Siberian sledge dogs, the first to be used in an Antarctic expedition.<ref name = anta-canterbury-equip>{{cite web|title = The Southern Cross Expedition|url= http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html|publisher= www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz|accessyear= 2008|accessyear= 10 August}} (Equipment and Personnel)</ref>  After final provisioning in Hobart, she sailed for the Antarctic on 19 December. The [[Antarctic Circle]] was crossed on 23 January 1899, after which the ship was caught in the ice, emerging three weeks later. Cape Adare was sighted on 16 February, and the following day ''Southern Cross'' was anchored off-shore.<ref name= SouthPole2/>

Cape Adare had been discovered by Antarctic explorer [[James Clark Ross]] during his [[James Clark Ross#Antarctic explorer|1839&ndash;43 expedition]]. It lies at the end of a long [[promontory]]; below the Cape is a large triangular shingle [[Intertidal zone|foreshore]], where Bull and Borchgrevink had made their brief landing in 1895. This foreshore is the site of one of the largest [[Adelie penguin]] rookeries on the entire continent and, as Borchgrevink had remarked in 1895, "On this particular spot, there is ample room for houses, tents and provisions".<ref name= anta-canterbury-intro/> The abundance of penguins would provide both a winter larder and a fuel source.<ref>Preston, p. 14</ref>
[[Image:Huskies 2000-08-24.jpg|thumb|left|The expedition was the first to use dogs in the Antarctic.]]
Unloading began on 17 February.

A third structure was contrived from spare materials, to serve as a magnetic observation hut.<ref>Preston, p. 14</ref> The "living hut" was small to serve as accommodation for ten men, and seemingly precarious&mdash;Bernacchi later described it as "fifteen feet square, lashed down by cables to the rocky shore".<ref name= Crane153>Crane, p. 153</ref> The dogs were housed in kennels fashioned from packing cases.<ref name = anta-canterbury-build/> By 2 March the base, christened "Camp Ridley" after Borchgrevink's English mother's maiden name,<ref name= SouthPole2/> was fully established, and the Duke of York's flag raised. That day, ''Southern Cross'' departed for Australia, to spend the winter there.<ref name= anta-canterbury-arrival/>

Inside the living hut were two small ante-rooms, one used as a photographic [[dark room]], the other for [[taxidermy]]. Within the main accommodation area daylight was admitted via a double-glazed and shuttered window and through a small square pane high on the northern wall. Bunks were fitted around the outer walls, and a table and stove dominated the centre of the hut.<ref name= anta-canterbury-build/> During the few brief weeks before winter set in, members of the party made trial sledging journeys on the sea ice in nearby Robertson Bay, surveying the coast and collecting specimens of birds and fish. They also slaughtered seals and penguins for food and fuel. Outside activities were largely curtailed by the onset of severe winter weather, in mid-May.<ref name= SouthPole2/>

===Antarctic winter===
[[Image:Drawing in Carstens Borchgrevink hut c.jpg|thumb|Drawing by Kolbein Ellefsen, on the wall of the Cape Adare hut above his bed, as he passed the time during the Antarctic winter]]
As the winter season took hold, the party was increasingly confined to their cramped living quarters. This proved to be a difficult time; Bernacchi wrote of increasing boredom and irritation: "Officers and men, ten of us in all, found tempers wearing thin".<ref>Crane, p. 153</ref> During this period of tension and confinement, Borchgrevink's qualities as a commander were found wanting; he was, wrote Bernacchi, "in many respects...not a good leader".<ref name= Crane74/> Polar historian [[Ranulph Fiennes]] writes that in conditions of "democratic anarchy", dirt, disorder and inactivity were the order of the day.<ref>Fiennes, p. 43</ref> 

Borchgrevink was not a trained scientist, and his incompetence with equipment and inability to make simple observations were reportedly of great concern to some of the party.<ref name= anta-canterbury-depart>{{cite web|title = The Southern Cross Expedition|url= http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html|publisher= www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 10 August}} (Departure of the Expedition)</ref> However, a programme of scientific observations was maintained, exercise was taken outside the hut when the weather permitted, and as a further diversion Savio improvised a sauna in the snowdrifts alongside the hut.

The party was well-supplied with a variety of basic foodstuffs&mdash;butter, tea and coffee, herrings, sardines, cheeses, soup, tinned tripe, plum pudding, dry potatoes and vegetables.<ref name= anta-canterbury-life/> However, there were soon complaints about the lack of luxuries, Colbeck noting that "all the tinned fruits supplied for the land party were either eaten on the passage or left on board for the crew".<ref name= anta-canterbury-life/> There was also a shortage of tobacco, in spite of an intended provision of half a ton (500&nbsp;kg).  Only a quantity of chewing tobacco was landed.<ref name= anta-canterbury-life/>

The zoologist, Nikolai Hansen, had fallen ill during the winter. On 14 October he died, apparently of an intestinal disorder, and became the first person to be buried on the Antarctic continent.

As winter gave way to spring, the party prepared for more ambitious inland journeys using the dogs and sledges.

===Ross Sea exploration===
''Southern Cross'' returned to Cape Adare from Australia on 28 January 1900.<ref name= anta-canterbury-depart/> Borchgrevink began the process of dismantling the camp and transferring its supplies to the ship, but apparently abandoned this idea after a few days, boarded the ship, and on 2 February sailed south into the Ross Sea.<ref name= anta-canterbury-depart/> Evidence of a hasty and disorderly departure from Cape Adare was noted two years later, when the site was visited by members of the Discovery Expedition, after which [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]] wrote; "...heaps of refuse all around, and a mountain of provision boxes, dead birds, seals, dogs, sledging gear [...] and heaven knows what else".<ref>Wilson diary, 9 January 1902, pp. 93&ndash;95</ref>
[[Image:Ross Ice Shelf 1997.jpg|thumb|The edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, or "Great Ice Barrier", where Borchgrevink landed in 1900 to set a new Farthest South record]]
The first port of call in the Ross Sea was Possession Island, where the tin box left by Borchgrevink and Bull in 1895 was recovered.<ref name = SouthPole3/> They then proceeded southwards, following the [[Victoria Land]] coast and discovering further islands, one of which Borchgrevink named after Sir Clements Markham, whose hostility towards the expedition was evidently unchanged by this honour.<ref name = Borch6/><ref name = Huxley>Huxley, p. 25</ref> ''Southern Cross'' then sailed on to [[Ross Island]], observed the volcano [[Mount Erebus]], and attempted a landing at [[Cape Crozier]], at the foot of [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]]. Here, Borchgrevink and Captain Jensen were almost drowned by a tidal wave caused by a "calving" or breakaway of ice from the adjacent [[Ross Ice Shelf|Great Ice Barrier]].<ref name= SouthPole3/> Following the path of [[James Clark Ross]] sixty years previously, they proceeded eastwards along the Barrier edge, to find the inlet where, in 1843, Ross had reached his [[Farthest South|farthest south]].<ref>Preston, p. 13</ref> Observations indicated that the Barrier had moved some 30&nbsp;miles south since Ross's time, which meant that they were already south of Ross's record.<ref name= SouthPole3/> However, Borchgrevink wished to make a landing on the Barrier itself. In the vicinity of Ross's inlet he found a spot where the ice sloped sufficiently to suggest that a landing was possible.<ref name= Amundsen/> On 16 February he, Colbeck and Savio landed with dogs and a sledge, ascended to the Barrier surface, and then journeyed a few miles south to a point which they calculated as 78<U+00B0>50'S, a new Farthest South record.<ref>Preston, p. 14</ref> They were the first persons to travel on the Barrier surface, earning Amundsen's acknowledgement that they had opened the route to the south.<ref name= Amundsen/> Indeed, close to that very spot ten years later, Amundsen would establish his base camp "Framheim", prior to his successful South Pole journey.<ref>Amundsen, pp. 167&ndash;68</ref>

On its return northward, ''Southern Cross'' halted at [[Franklin Island]], off the Victoria Land coast, and made a series of magnetic calculations. These indicated that the location of the South Magnetic Pole was, as expected,  within Victoria Land, but further north and further west than had previously been assumed.<ref name= SouthPole3/> They then sailed for home, crossing the Antarctic Circle on 28 February. On 1 April, news of their safe return was sent by telegram from [[Bluff, New Zealand]].<ref name= ForEx/>

''Southern Cross'' returned to England in June 1900,<ref>Stonehouse, p. 40</ref> to a cool welcome. In geographical circles there was still resentment at Borchgrevink's coup in obtaining the backing of Newnes, but public attention was, in any event, distracted by the preparations for Captain Scott's upcoming Discovery Expedition, due to sail the following year.<ref name= SouthPole3/> Borchgrevink meanwhile pronounced his voyage a great success, stating: "The Antarctic regions might be another [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondyke]]"<U+2014>in terms of the prospects for fishing, sealing, and mineral extraction.<ref name = anta-canterbury-results>{{cite web|title = The Southern Cross Expedition|url= http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html|publisher= www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 10 August}} (Results)</ref> He had proved that it was possible for a resident expedition to survive an Antarctic winter, and had made a series of geographical discoveries. These included the new islands in Robertson's Bay and the Ross Sea, and the first landings on Franklin Island, Coulman Island, Ross Island and the Great Ice Barrier.<ref name = Borch6/> The survey of the Victoria Land coast had revealed the "important geographical discovery [...] of the Southern Cross Fjord, as well as the excellent camping place at the foot of [[Mount Melbourne]]".<ref name= Borch6/> The most significant exploration achievement, he claimed, was the scaling of the Great Ice Barrier and the journey to "the furthest south ever reached by man".<ref name= Borch6/>

Borchgrevink's account of the expedition, ''First on the Antarctic Continent'', was published the following year; the English edition, much of which may have been embroidered by Newnes's journalists, was criticised for its "journalistic" style and for its bragging tone.<ref name= Huxley/><ref name= adb/>  The author, "not known for either his modesty or his tact",<ref>Preston, p. 16</ref> embarked on a lecture tour of England and Scotland, but the reception was generally poor.<ref name= SouthPole3/> 

Hugh Robert Mill stated that while the scientific results of the expedition were not so great as expected, many of Hanson's notes having mysteriously disappeared, the expedition was "interesting as a dashing piece of scientific work".<ref name= anta-canterbury-results/> The meteorological and magnetic conditions of Victoria Land had been recorded for a full year; the location of the South Magnetic Pole had been calculated (though not visited); samples of the continent's natural fauna and flora, and of its geology, had been collected.  Borchgrevink also claimed the discovery of new insect and shallow-water fauna species, proving "bi-polarity" (existence of species in proximity to the North and South poles).<ref name= Borch6/>

The geographical establishments in Britain and abroad were slow to give formal recognition to the expedition. The Royal Geographical Society gave Borchgrevink a fellowship, and other medals and honours eventually followed from Norway, Denmark and the United States,<ref name=adb/> but the expedition's achievements were not widely recognised.  Markham persisted in his  attacks on Borchgrevink, describing him as cunning and unprincipled;<ref>Riffenburgh, p. 56</ref>  Amundsen's warm tribute was a lone approving voice.  Scott's biographer David Crane surmises that if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer, his expedition would have been treated differently in Britain, but "a Norwegian seaman/schoolmaster was never going to be taken seriously".<ref>Crane, p. 74</ref> A belated recognition came in 1930, long after Markham's death, when the Royal Geographical Society presented Borchgrevink with its Patron's Medal. It admitted that "justice had not been done at the time to the pioneer work of the ''Southern Cross'' expedition", and that the magnitude of the difficulties it had overcome had previously been underestimated.<ref name= SouthPole3/>
