==History==

The original chapel was built in 1673.  In about 1720 Francis Gastrell, [[Bishop of Chester]] noted that it was not consecrated.  The chapel was almost entirely rebuilt in 1834.<ref name="richards">{{cite book | last =Richards | first =Raymond | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Old Cheshire Churches | publisher =B.

==Structure==

It is built in [[sandstone]] with a [[Kerridge]] stone-slate roof.  The nave and chancel are in one range of five bays.  On the south wall is a porch.  At the west end is a tower with a saddleback roof and there are [[louvre]]s in the bell-openings.<ref name="images"/>  The tower contains one bell.<ref name="richards"/>  

==Fittings and furniture==

The interior is very plain.  On the chancel wall is a white [[marble]] memorial to the memory of Rev Samuel Hall, a former minister of the church.  Over the porch doorway is a benefaction board.  Built into the east end wall is a stone altar.<ref name="richards"/>  The east window contains some [[Victorian era|Victorian]] glass.<ref name="images"/>  The chapel registers begin in 1759 with some loose sheets dating back to 1746.<ref name="richards"/>  

==Today==

The old tradition of rush-bearing still takes place at the chapel each August.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cressbrook.co.uk/towns/maccforest.php |title=Peak District Towns and Villages: Macclesfield Forest |accessdate=2007-09-13 |publisher=Cressbrook Multimedia }}</ref>
