A series of protests of varying levels of violence took place early in 2012 in response to the [[Quran desecration|burning of Islamic religious material]] by soldiers from the United States of America [[Bagram Airfield|Bagram Air Base]] in [[Afghanistan]]. International condemnation<ref>http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=9116</ref> followed the burning of copies of the Quran, on 22 February 2012, from the library that is used by inmates at the base's detention facility. The protests included domestic riots which caused at least 41 deaths and at least 270 injuries.<ref name=Quinn/><ref name=stripes/>

== Background ==
[[Bagram Airfield]] is one of the largest American military bases in Afghanistan, about {{convert|40|km|mi}} northeast of the Afghan capital [[Kabul]].<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,528003,00.html Rocket Attack on U.S. Base in Afghanistan Kills 2 Troops, Wounds 6 Americans]</ref> The [[Parwan Detention Facility]], located at the base, houses hundreds of [[Taliban]], [[al Qaeda]] and other captured militants.

In February 2012, two  Afghan-American interpreters at the base removed 1,652 damaged books and Islamic texts from the library at the Parwan Detention Facility (including 48 copies of the [[Quran]]), and boxed them for storage.  On 22 February, several members of the [[United States armed forces]] apparently mistakenly sent them to an [[incineration|incinerator]] to be burned.  Several Afghan garbage collectors working at the base reported finding a number of charred books and quickly notified an [[Afghan National Army]] commander.<ref name=Quinn>[http://news.yahoo.com/official-mistakes-led-afghan-quran-burnings-053758916.html Official: Mistakes led to Afghan Quran burnings]</ref><ref>http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/21/u-s-general-apologizes-as-afghans-storm-bagram-airbase-over-desecrated-korans/</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://nation.foxnews.com/koran/2012/03/01/obama-prosecuting-us-soldiers-koran-burning | work=Fox News | title=Obama Prosecuting U.S. Soldiers for Koran Burning? - Koran - Fox Nation | date=1 March 2012}}</ref>

[[John R. Allen]], commander of ISAF and US forces in Afghanistan,<ref name=stripes/> said the books were taken from the library that is used by inmates at the detention facility. He said the religious material was removed from the library due to the presence of "extremist inscriptions" on them, further noting "an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications."<ref name="cnn">{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-25/asia/world_asia_afghanistan-burned-qurans_1_qurans-protests-afghan-police?_s=PM:ASIA | work=CNN | title=Apology for Quran burning not enough, Muslim scholars say | date=2 March 2012}}</ref>
