The '''tyranny of small decisions''' refers to a phenomenon explored in an essay by that name, published in 1966 by the American economist [[Alfred E. Kahn]].<ref>Kahn, Alfred E. (1966) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119726548/abstract "The tyranny of small decisions: market failures, imperfections, and the limits of economics"] ''Kvklos'', '''19''':23-47.</ref><ref>[http://opus1journal.org/articles/article.asp?docID=140 The tyranny of small decisions - A. E. Kahn"] ''Opus 1'', Scholarly papers. Retrieved 16 February 2010.</ref> The article describes a situation where a number of decisions, individually small in size and time perspective, cumulatively result in the suboptimal allocation of resources, leading to [[market failure]]. The concept has since been extended to other areas, such as environmental degradation.

A classic example of the tyranny of small decisions is the [[tragedy of the commons]], described by [[Garrett Hardin]] in 1968<ref name=hardin68>Garrett Hardin, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 "The Tragedy of the Commons"], ''Science'', Vol. 162, No. 3859 (December 13, 1968), pp. 1243-1248.

The herders each act independently in what they perceive to be their own rational self-interest, ultimately depleting their shared limited resource, even though it is clear that it is not in anyone's long-term interest for this to happen.<ref>Baylis J, Wirtz JJ, Cohen EA and Gray CS (2007) [http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=1akfkqhO_m0C&pg=PT368&lpg=PT368&dq=%22Tyranny+of+small+decisions%22+%22tragedy+of+the+commons%22&source=bl&ots=hu5UiZN-IM&sig=OaPxuPF9rduZXyaqFJWfVRNXdBQ&hl=en&ei=nbt7S5D-EMGTkAXo3aW8BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22Tyranny%20of%20small%20decisions%22%20%22tragedy%20of%20the%20commons%22&f=false ''Strategy in the contemporary world: an introduction to strategic studies''] Page 368.

==The Ithaca railroad==

The event that first suggested the tyranny of small decisions to Kahn was the withdrawal of passenger railway services in [[Ithaca]], [[New York]]. The railway was the only reliable way to get in and out of Ithaca. It provided services regardless of conditions, in fair weather and foul, during peak seasons and off-peak seasons. The local airline and bus company skimmed the traffic when conditions were favourable, leaving the trains to fill in when conditions were difficult. The railway service was eventually withdrawn, because the collective individual decisions made by travellers did not provide the railway with the revenue it needed to cover its incremental costs. According to Kahn, this suggests a hypothetical economic test of whether the service should have been withdrawn. 

<blockquote>
Suppose each person in the cities served were to ask himself how much he would have been willing to pledge regularly over some time period, say annually, by purchase of prepaid tickets, to keep rail passenger service available to his community. As long as the amount that he would have declared (to himself) would have exceeded what he actually paid on the period<U+2013>and my own introspective experiment shows that it would<U+2013>then to that extent the disappearance of the passenger service was an incident of market failure.<ref name=Kahn2>Kahn AE (1988) [http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=x01ew7Emw0MC&pg=RA1-PA237&lpg=RA1-PA237&dq=%22Kahn%22+%22The+tyranny+of+small+decisions%22&source=bl&ots=Mzhp2bdJFJ&sig=YPQqdVYSM8q2zTvF5K-I9Zv4EKw&hl=en&ei=_uB5S5vsFJiekQWSmaj5Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=16&ved=0CEwQ6AEwDw#v=onepage&q=%22Kahn%22%20%22The%20tyranny%20of%20small%20decisions%22&f=false ''The economics of regulation: principles and institutions''] Volume 1, pp 237<U+2013>238.

The failure to reflect the full value to passengers of keeping the railroad service available had its origins in the discrepancy between the time perception within which the travellers were operating, and the time perception within which the railroad was operating. The travellers were making many short term decisions, deciding each particular trip whether to go by the railroad, or whether to go instead by car, bus or the local airline. Based on the cumulative effects of these small decisions, the railroad was making one major long run decision, "virtually all-or-nothing and once-and-for-all"; whether to retain or abandon its passenger service. Taken one at a time, each small travel decision made individually by the travellers had a negligible impact on the survivability of the railroad. It would not have have been rational for a traveller to consider the survival of the railroad imperilled by any one of his particular decisions.<ref name=Kahn2 />
  
<blockquote>
The fact remains that each selection of x over y constitutes also a vote for eliminating the ''possibility thereafter of choosing y''. If enough people vote for x, each time necessarily on the assumption that y will continue to be available, y may in fact disappear. And its disappearance may constitute a genuine deprivation, which customers might willingly have paid something to avoid. The only choice the market offered travellers to influence the longer-run decision of the railroad was thus shorter in its time perspective, and the sum total of our individual purchases of railroad tickets necessary added up to a smaller amount, than out actual combined interest in the continued availability of rail service. We were victims of the "tyranny of small decisions".<ref name=Kahn2 />
