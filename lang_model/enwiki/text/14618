'''''ChartJackers''''' (sometimes spelled '''''Chartjackers''''') was a [[BBC]] television series, produced by [[Hat Trick Productions]] and commissioned by [[BBC Switch]]. It premiered in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2009 on [[BBC Two]] and garnered a viewing figures peak of almost half a million with its final episode. The series documented the lives of four teenage [[Video blogging|vloggers]] over the course of ten weeks, as they attempted to write, record and release a [[pop song]], with the goal to "sell an estimated 25,000 singles to achieve their dream of a number one single".<ref>{{cite web|title=Chartjackers, Episode 1|publisher=[[BBC Switch]]|date=12 September 2009|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mwbfy|accessdate=30 January 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5n8AADloE|archivedate=29 January 2010}}</ref>

The ''ChartJackers'' [[Single (music)|single]] was written entirely through [[crowdsourcing]], with the song's title, [[lyrics]], [[melody]], [[singers]], [[Band (music)|band]], [[Record producer|production]], [[cover art]] and [[music video]] all being solicited from the global [[online community]]. A cross-platform project, the show made use of online media such as [[YouTube]] and [[Twitter]]. The crowdsourcing of the track took the format of the four vloggers posting videos to a dedicated YouTube channel named "ChartJackersProject", where they asked viewers to suggest various ideas for the final song.

By the end of the ten weeks, the completed ''ChartJackers'' single, entitled "I've Got Nothing", was released through the [[iTunes Store]] on 9 November 2009. It sold approximately 20,000 copies worldwide, achieved a peak position of Number 36 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and raised roughly <U+00A3>10,000 for the UK charity [[Children in Need]].

==Synopsis==
The ''ChartJackers'' leading team consisted of four YouTube users named Johnny Haggart, Jimmy Hill, [[Charlie McDonnell]] and [[Alex Day]]. On 5 September 2009, the boys announced on "ChartJackersProject" their intention to release a single that would reach Number One on the UK Singles Chart within their ten-week time frame. A different task would be undertaken each week, so that, by the end of the project, the song would be completed.

The first week began with the task of writing the song's [[lyrics]]. In order to generate potential lyrics, McDonnell and Day asked each viewer to post one line as a video comment.<ref>{{cite web|last=McDonnell|first=Charlie|authorlink=Charlie_McDonnell|last2=Day|first2=Alex|authorlink2=Alex_Day|title=Lyrics Week|publisher=[[Youtube]]|date=8 September 2009|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi0BfpBgrJw|accessdate=11 November 2009}}</ref> Viewers posted more than 4,000 comments,<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Episode 1|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSNSN6MYkU|series=ChartJackers|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|airdate=12 September 2009|seriesno=1|number=1}}</ref> from which were selected the winning lines. These lyrics were posted to the [[Internet]] the following week, with the repeated phrase "I've Got Nothing" chosen for the song's title from among them. Day then asked viewers to create a [[melody]] for the lyrics and to submit it in a video response, so that one could be chosen for the single.<ref>{{cite web|last=Day|first=Alex|authorlink=Alex_Day|title=Melodies Week|publisher=[[Youtube]]|date=17 September 2009|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEpQmaVRx8M|accessdate=11 November 2009}}</ref>

After receiving advice from video director [[Corin Hardy]],<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Episode 6|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFoBwlOv-70|series=ChartJackers|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|airdate=17 October 2009|seriesno=1|number=6}}</ref> the music video for "I've Got Nothing" was filmed during week seven. To begin promoting the release of "I've Got Nothing", the boys petitioned [[95.8 Capital FM]] and [[BBC Radio 1]] to try to get the radio coverage for the single,<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Episode 7|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baXD5a4-yHg|series=ChartJackers|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|airdate=24 October 2009|seriesno=1|number=7}}</ref> but it was not [[Playlist#In radio|playlisted]] and received no airplay.

On 15 November 2009, it was revealed on [[BBC Radio 1#The Radio 1 Chart Show|The Radio 1 Chart Show]] that "I've Got Nothing" had reached Number 36 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The boys were disappointed by this.<ref name="Compilation">{{Cite episode|title=Compilation|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5csWCO5STI|series=ChartJackers|credits=Producers: Jonathan Davenport and Adam King|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|airdate=21 November 2009|seriesno=1|number=11}}</ref> The song had been distributed through the independent label [[Swinging Mantis]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Official Chart with Reggie Yates, 15/11/2009|publisher=[[BBC Radio 1]]|date=15 November 2009|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nvd1y|accessdate=2 June 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5qAooDPa7|archivedate=2 June 2010}}</ref> therefore it qualified for inclusion in the [[UK Indie Chart]], where it reached Number One.<ref name="2009-11-21">{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/12/2009-11-21|title=Archive Chart|date=15 November 2009|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> Sales of the single raised approximately <U+00A3>10,000 for [[Children in Need]].<ref name="Compilation"/>

==Critical reception==
Although radio stations, newspapers and magazines were all canvassed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alexdaymusic.com/37/|title=More composed now|first=Alex|last=Day|authorlink=Alex_Day|date=20 December 2009|accessdate=4 June 2010|quote=...&nbsp;We asked traditional radio to play the song.

It was misrepresented in an article on ''[[The Times]]'' website, which mistook the four boys for a new [[boy band]].<ref name="YouTube if you want to be a star">{{cite web|last=Bowers|first=Mary|title=YouTube if you want to be a star|date=13 November 2009|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6914409.ece|accessdate=10 December 2009}}</ref> Eammon Forde of ''[[Music Week]]'' described the series' decision to release the single without management as "ridiculous" and the campaign as "doomed".<ref name="YouTube if you want to be a star"/> [[James Masterton]] of [[Yahoo!

As with the series itself, "I've Got Nothing" was poorly received by critics. [[Popjustice]] called the effort "very bad",<ref>{{cite news|title=Subtle hints that Simon Cowell might not always be musically motivated|url=http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4212|publisher=[[Popjustice]]|date=16 November 2009|accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref> while Ellie Halfacre of [[Tower Review]] explained that "some commented that the melody was bad, and others said it was the lyrics".<ref>{{cite web|last=Halfacre|first=Ellie|title=I've Got Nothing|publisher=[[Tower Review]]|date=19 January 2010|url=http://towerreview.wordpress.com/2010/01/19/ive-got-nothing/|accessdate=28 February 2010}}</ref> Record producer [[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]] said that, despite "a nice little verse", the song had "no killer melody".<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Episode 3|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=071L0s_o5Mk|series=ChartJackers|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|airdate=26 September 2009|seriesno=1|number=3|minutes=3:29}}</ref> Singer [[VV Brown]] suggested that, while the song's melody was "good", "the lyrics could be better".<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Episode 3|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=071L0s_o5Mk|series=ChartJackers|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|airdate=26 September 2009|seriesno=1|number=3|minutes=1:57}}</ref>

A more positive review came from Stan Schroeder of [[Mashable]], who wrote of the song: "While it's hard to predict if it'll become a huge hit, it definitely has the ingredients, and the community to support it."<ref>{{cite web|last=Schroeder|first=Stan|title=I've Got Nothing: Crowdsourced Song Created by YouTubers|publisher=[[Mashable]]|date=9 November 2009|url=http://mashable.com/2009/11/09/ive-got-nothing/|accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref> The project was followed by [[Digital Spy]], who gave the single three stars out of five, calling it a "coherent and chirpy effort" but "unlikely to make much of a top 40 impact".<ref>{{cite web|title=Music - Single Reviews|last=Balls|first=David|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=9 November 2009|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a186401/chartjackers-ive-got-nothing.html|accessdate=10 December 2009}}</ref> It was also followed by ''[[The Huffington Post]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-campbell/crowdsourced-band-release_b_350167.html|title=Crowdsourced Band Release "I've Got Nothing" Single|first=Scott|last=Campbell|date=8 November 2009|publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|accessdate=June 2010}}</ref> and received promotion from Yates, Fry and singer [[Pixie Lott]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lott|first=Pixie|authorlink=Pixie_Lott|title=please buy chartjackers si ...|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=10 November 2009|url=http://twitter.com/pixiesongs/status/5597516260|accessdate=June 2010}}</ref>
