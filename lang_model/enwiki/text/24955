The '''Professional Bowlers Association''' (PBA), based in [[Seattle, Washington]], is the major sanctioning body for the sport of professional [[ten-pin bowling]] in the [[U.S.A.]]. Its season runs from September to April each year, and is televised exclusively by [[ESPN]].

Upcoming events to wrap up the 2007-08 season are the [[Motel 6]] Roll To Riches competition, which will be telecast on ESPN April 13.  The PBA Seniors Tour resumes competition April 26 in [[Dayton, OH]], for the first of nine stops, through August 12.  The annual PBA Tour Trials also will be conducted May 27 through June 1.

==PBA History==
[[Image:Pba-logo-small.gif|left|thumbnail|86px|2003-04 PBA Tour logo.]]

Prior to the PBA's inception, bowling was telecast on television sporadically beginning in the early 1950s.  NBC began with an early 1950s special telecast entitled ''Championship Bowling'' [http://www.tenpinbowling.org/view.php?page=the_game.history].  Regular bowling shows, including ''Make That Spare'' and ''Jackpot Bowling with [[Milton Berle]]'' began airing nationally.  

At the same time, there was a desire to start a professional bowling division in the [[United States]]; an effort led by [[Eddie Elias]], a sports agent based in [[Akron, OH|Akron]], [[Ohio]].  During the [[1958]] ABC ([[American Bowling Congress]]) tournament in [[Syracuse, NY|Syracuse]] [[New York]], sixty men, including [[Don Carter]], [[Frank Esposito]], [[Buzz Fazio]], [[Dick Weber]], [[Carmen Salvino]], [[Billy Welu]], [[Steve Nagy]], [[Harry Smith]], [[Ray Bluth]], [[Dick Hoover]] and [[Junie McMahon]] attended a presentation by Elias.  After listening to his proposal, thirty-three of the men donated $1,650 each to start the organization, which was incorporated in 1958 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Fazio], and headquartered in Akron.

Competition began in [[1959]] with three tournaments.  [[Lou Campi]] won the first event (the ''Empire State Open''), and Dick Weber won the other two (''Paramus Eastern Open'' and the ''Dayton Open'').[http://www.pba.com/schedule/schedule.asp?season=1]  Weber would become the first "face" of the PBA in the early years, as he won eleven of the first twenty events held.

Elias would also lead the effort to give the [[PBA]] a permanent home on television, which it would find on [[ABC Sports]] by [[1965]].  Coupled with the continued support of its charter members, as well as sponsorships by the [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Coca-Cola]] (which sponsored eleven tournaments in [[1963]] alone)[http://www.pba.com/schedule/schedule.asp?season=5], [[True Value]] Hardware and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone Tire]], the PBA experienced growth in its tournament schedules and prize funds.  

Schedules reached a plateau of 35 tournaments per year in the 1980s.  The 1965 ''Tournament of Champions'' was the first to offer $100,000 in prize money; the [[1982]] event featured a $200,000 purse, and the [[1987]] ''U.S. Open'', sponsored by [[Seagram]] distillery, offered a $500,000 prize fund as well as the first $100,000 first-place prize in PBA history.[http://www.pba.com/results/archives_detailed.asp?ID=1171]  

By the 1980s, True Value pledged $100,000 to any roller of a perfect game on national television (increased to a $200,000 sum during its own ''True Value Open'').  Prior to this, the PBA would award a televised 300 game with $10,000 and a new [[Ford]] automobile.  In addition, in the early 1990s the [[Miller Brewing Company]] offered $1 million to any bowler who could win all three of its tournaments in a given season.  

Today, total PBA tournament prize money exceeds $9 million (2007), versus approximately $1 million annually in the 1970s.<ref>"Today in History, July 29" at The Library of Congress website, last updated July 27, 2007.</ref>

As television exposure increased for the PBA, it spun off a Seniors Tour in [[1981]], with Bill Beach winning the first seniors' championship that year.

Elias continued to be involved in the PBA until his death in [[1998]].  Eventually, the PBA was purchased in March 2000 by former [[Microsoft]] executives [[Chris Peters]] (Chairman), [[Rob Glaser]], and [[Mike Slade]]. The organization's corporate headquarters were moved to [[Seattle, Washington]]. Together with CEO [[Steve Miller (athletics)|Steve Miller]], a former [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] executive, this group is widely recognized for rescuing the PBA from the brink of extinction. [[Fred Schreyer]] currently serves as the PBA's [[CEO]]/President, and Commissioner; after assuming the post from Miller in [[2005]].

The PBA oversees the [[PBA Tour]], the [[PBA Senior Tour]], and the [[PBA Regional Tour]] (a sort of minor-league circuit). The PBA Regional Tour consists of 7 regions: Central, East, Midwest, Northwest, South, Southwest, and West.  The PBA currently has almost 4,300 members worldwide. [http://www.pba.com/corporate/aboutus.asp] 

On [[October 3]], [[2005]], the PBA signed a historic three-year sponsorship deal with [[Denny's]], which made the American restaurant chain the PBA Tour's first title sponsor.

Additionally, [[Danny Wiseman]] and [[Michael Fagan]] won the PBA's ''Exempt Doubles Classic'' on a February 3 telecast, defeating [[Joe Ciccone]] and [[Ronnie Russell]], 210-208. It was Fagan's first career PBA title, and Wiseman's 12th.

ESPN will also telecast the fourth annual ''Roll To Riches'' on April 13, 2008 from [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].  Six bowlers will vie for the $150,000 winner-take-all prize:

* [[Doug Kent]] (defending champion)
* [[Sean Rash]] (USBC Masters champion)
* [[Michael Haugen Jr.]] (Tournament of Champions winner)
* [[Norm Duke]] (Denny's World Championship and U.S. Open champion)
* [[Parker Bohn III]] (winner of online fan vote)
* [[Chris Barnes]] (runner-up in online fan vote; earned spot when Duke won his second major of the season)

== Qualifying for the Denny's PBA Tour ==
[[Image:WRWilliams.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Walter Ray Williams, Jr.]] bowls on ESPN television for a PBA Tour title.]] 

From the PBA Tour's inception through the 2003-2004 season, most national PBA events were open to the entire PBA membership.  Starting in October 2004, the PBA adopted an all-exempt national tour format.  In this format, only 64 bowlers compete each week.  Bowlers can earn exemptions by winning a tournament during the previous season, winning one of the four major tournaments (thus gaining a multi-year exemption), placing among the top finishers in points, leading a region** on the PBA Regional Tour, or finishing in a high position at the PBA Tour Trials.
* **Effective with the Regional 2008-2009 season, an exemption will no longer automatically go to the point leader in each of the seven PBA Regions; eight bowlers will now receive exemptions for the 2009-10 season via the 2008 Regional Players Invitational (RPI).

The top 25 bowlers on the RPI points list in each of the seven PBA regions (through September 2008) will earn an invitation to the 2008 RPI. The top five from each region <U+2013> plus the winner of the 2008 Regional Players Championship which takes place in late May <U+2013> will receive airfare and accommodations for the event in December. The normal $150 entry fee will still be required for those players, but they will not have to pay an additional fee to be eligible for an exemption. 

The next 20 players in each region will pay their own way to the RPI and will also be required to pay an additional $750 to be eligible for the exemptions on top of their $500 entry fee. All bowlers competing in the event are guaranteed a minimum $400 cash spot. 

The 2008 RPI will feature a similar format to the Denny<U+2019>s PBA Tour Trials in that competitors will bowl for five days on each of the PBA<U+2019>s five oil patterns. The top eight bowlers who have paid the additional entry fee will earn exemptions for the 2008-09 season, provided they finish in the top 16 overall.

The number of exemptions awarded at the Denny's PBA Tour Trials can vary - 10 spots were available in 2006-07, but only seven spots at the start of the 2007-08 campaign.  That number increased due to injury deferments for currently exempt bowlers. [[Jason Couch]] and [[Tony Reyes]] were awarded injury deferments in 2007-08, allowing them to retain their exempt status for the 2008-09 season.

In total, 59 bowlers receive exempt status for the entire season.  The five remaining spots are awarded each week through the Denny's PBA Tour Qualifying Round (TQR). (Prior to 2007-08, PBA Commissioner [[Fred Schreyer]] would ''regularly'' award one spot to any former touring pro under the ''Commissioner's Exemption''; this option was rarely used during the 2007-08 season).  

During the TQR, amateur and PBA bowlers bowl 7 games of qualifying.  The top amateur bowler advances (no matter where he or she finishes), along with the top four PBA members. 

In the 2006 Denny's PBA Tour Trials, [[Kelly Kulick]] made history becoming the first woman in PBA history to gain a PBA exemption (she was exempt for the 2006-2007 season).  Before it dissolved, Kulick was the 2001 Rookie of the Year on the PWBA, won the 2003 Women's U.S. Open, and was a three time member of Team USA.

===Exemption Breakdown===
The following is a breakdown of who received a PBA exemption (for most tournaments in the 2007-08 season):
*'''64''' - Total Bowlers for 2007-08
**'''40''' - Denny's PBA Tour (champions and point leaders) 
**'''7''' - Point leaders from the seven PBA regions 
**'''7''' - 2007 Lake County Indiana Denny's PBA Tour Trials 
**'''5''' - Weekly Denny's PBA Tour Qualifying Round (TQR)
**'''1''' - Non-exempt Points Leader from the 2006-07 Denny's PBA Tour
**'''4''' - Deferred Exemptions from the 2006-07 Denny's PBA Tour 
''If a bowler from any of the aforementioned categories does not take his or her spot, the next-place bowler beyond 5th place in the TQR will take the spot.''

Under this new format, active membership in the PBA is not a guarantee; it must be earned.  The [[2003]] ''Tournament Of Champions'' was pivotal, as [[Randy Pedersen]] was facing elimination of his tour card in the semi-final match against [[Norm Duke]].  On his final shot, Pedersen left a ringing 10-pin and immediately singled out the sidelines, accusing a spectator of distracting him as he made his shot.  From that point, Pedersen would have to bowl in the TQR in order to try making the match-play cut.  (Duke would eventually finish runner-up to [[Steve Jaros]] in the final match.)

Ironically, Duke faced a similar fate in the 2007-08 season, but prevailed. Standing 51st on the PBA points list entering the 2008 ''Denny's World Championship'', he defeated all-time titles leader [[Walter Ray Williams]] in the semifinals, then topped [[Ryan Shafer]] in the finals to maintain his Tour exemption for another two years.

Criticism of the format was brought forth by long-time PBA fans when 24-time winner [[Brian Voss]] lost his tour exemption following the 2006-07 season.  Nineteen-time titlist [[Amleto Monacelli]] also lost his exemption at the same time.

====Exceptions====

There are some exceptions to this breakdown.  The ''[[Dick Weber]] Open'', for example is open to the entire PBA membership.  Known in the PBA as a ''throwback event'', it re-instituted the original qualifying process and stepladder format finals on TV, which will be in place during four tournaments in the 2007-08 season.

==2007-2008 PBA Tour Trials==

In late May 2007, the PBA held the 2007 Denny's PBA Tour Trials to determine the remaining six bowlers who would attain exempt status for the 2007-08 season.  At the Tour Trials, non-exempt PBA and international bowlers bowled nine games each day for five straight days on the five different PBA oil patterns.  The six bowlers with the largest pin totals after 45 games received exempt status for the 2007-2008 season:

*Todd Book
*[[Steve Harman]]
*[[Chad Kloss]]
*[[Ronnie Russell]]
*[[Stevie Weber]] (no relation to Pete Weber)
*[[Troy Wollenbecker]]

===2007-2008 PBA Regional Tour exempt players===

These bowlers qualified for a season exemption through winning their local regional areas:

*[[Mitch Beasley]] (southwest region)
*[[Dave D'Entremont]] (central)
*[[David Leverage]] (northwest)
*[[Ken Simard]] (southern)
*[[Jason Wojnar]] (midwestern)
*[[Curtis Woods Jr.]] (western)
*[[Jim Tomek Jr.]] {eastern}

==The PBA Women's Series==
The PBA, in conjunction with the [[USBC]], inaugrated the ''PBA Women's Series'' in 2007.  Following ESPN telecasts of the Women's U.S. Open, it brought back women's bowling to the airwaves for the first time since the defunct [[PWBA]] (Professional Women's Bowling Association) folded in 2003.  The top two seeds out of a field of sixteen faced each other in one match, aired prior to the men's championship match.

Women's Series winners for 2007:

* [[Carolyn Dorin-Ballard]] - ''Motor City Classic''
* [[Shannon Pluhowsky]] - ''Etonic Championship''
* [[Joy Esterson]] - ''Lake County Indiana Classic''
* [[Diandra Asbaty]] - ''Great Lakes Classic''

The Women's Series will be brought back in [[2008]], with hopes for an expanded schedule.

==Finals Formats==

Prior to the debut of the PBA on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television in 1962, most tourneys bowled a set number of match-play games, with the champion crowned by final overall total pinfall.

Beginning in the 1960s thru 1997 (with the exception of one year), televised events were done in a "stepladder" format.  Four matches would be held, with the #5 and #4 seeds meeting first.  The winner of the first match would bowl the #3 seed, and likewise up to the top spot.  

ABC experimented in 1993 with a ''King Of The Hill'' format.  Under this arrangement, three matches determined the tournament winner, who would then face the current "King".  The winner of that match would then bowl the winner of the following week's tournament.  The "King" could defend his title even when not competing in the event hosting it.  The tour resumed its normal "stepladder" format the following year.  

The bowler who won himself the most notoriety for winning "King" matches was Ron Williams, who won only four tourneys in his career, yet held the "King" spot for five consecutive weeks that year.

Special formats were also used on occasion in conjunction with [[Old Spice]] deodorant, which sponsored a ''Winning Never Gets Old'' challenge annually in the mid 1990s.  The winner of the championship would bowl a Seniors Tour bowler for the rights to an extra $10,000.

In the pre-Mike Slade PBA of the late 1990s, the televised format would change.  Three bowlers would square off in one match, with the winner to face the tournament leader for the championship.  Upon purchase of the PBA by Slade's group, the current three-match "bracketed" setup involving the top four bowlers was instituted exclusively.  

Today, certain tournaments revert back to the original five-man stepladder final; the aforementioned ''Dick Weber Open'' becoming the first.  Additionally, the 2007 ''Lumber Liquidators Championship'' featured eight bowlers; four of whom ([[Chris Barnes (bowler)|Chris Barnes]], [[Mike Devaney]], [[Chris Warren]] and Williams Jr.) bowled each other in one opening match.

==From TQR to ESPN==
Only six bowlers have advanced from the TQR round to make the telecast on ESPN.  

* [[Liz Johnson]] - Also the first female bowler to appear on a PBA telecast (2004-05 ''Banquet Open''); lost to [[Tommy Jones]] in the championship match, 219-192.

* [[Del Ballard Jr.]] - The 12-time PBA champion lost to [[Ritchie Allen]] in the championship match of the 2006 [[Motel 6]] ''Phoenix Classic'', 232-207.  (This is Ritchie Allen's second title to date.)

* [[Sean Rash]] - The first bowler ever to win a PBA title while advancing from the TQR, defeating [[Mike DeVaney]], 194-169 to win the 2006 ''West Virginia Championship''.

* Steve Rogers - The #22 seed in the 2006 ''Lake County Indiana Classic'' lost his semi-final match to eventual tournament runner-up [[Mika Koivuniemi]], 276-194.

* [[Mike Mineman]] - Became the second bowler to win a title from the TQR, defeating [[Mike Machuga]] in the finals of the 2007 [[Bayer]] ''Classic'', 223-202.

* [[Rhino Page]] - Became the third bowler to win a title from the TQR, defeating [[Jack Jurek]] in the finals of the 2008 Go RVing Classic, 244-220. It was Page's fifth trip to the televised finals in the 2007-08 season, a remarkable accomplishment considering he had to bowl in the TQR every week just to qualify for the top 64.

==Denny's PBA Tour Major Championships==
[[Image:Pbalogo2001.jpg|right|thumbnail|86px|The 2001 PBA Tour logo.]]
The PBA Tour currently has four major championship events: 

* The '''USBC Masters''';

* The '''Denny's U.S. Open''';

* The '''Denny's World Championship''';

* The '''H&R Block Tournament of Champions'''.

===The Masters Championship===
{{main|USBC Masters}}

'''Current Defending Champion:''' '''''[[Sean Rash]]'''''

* The USBC Masters became an officially sanctioned PBA event in 1998. 
* [[Mike Aulby]] and [[Norm Duke]] are the only two of the five PBA "Triple Crown" winners who have also won the Masters, thus giving them the unofficial "grand slam" of pro bowling.
* Winners of the USBC Masters now earn a two-year PBA Tour exemption, meaning that for the following two seasons they do not have to qualify for the Top 64 each week through the TQR.

===The United States Open===
{{main|U.S. Open (bowling)}}

'''Current Defending Champion:''' '''''[[Norm Duke]]'''''

* The origins of the U.S. Open pre-date the PBA's founding by nearly a decade.  Originally associated with the Bowling Proprietors Association of America (BPAA) it was known as the ''BPAA All Star'' from [[1951]] to [[1970]]. It was renamed the ''BPAA United States Open'' in [[1971]], and shortened to the ''U.S. Open'' thereafter.  It has been held every year since, except for [[1997]].
* The U.S. Open is considered the most difficult of the tournaments to win today due to its demanding oil pattern, which differs from the five oil patterns the PBA generally employs. According to PBA.com, the U.S. Open uses a "flat" oil pattern, with equal amounts of oil being applied to every board.[http://www.pba.com/pbatour/tournament.asp?ID=1535] (Normal lane conditions feature a "crown" or larger amount of oil over the middle lane boards, to handle the heavier ball traffic.)
* [[Don Carter (bowler)|Don Carter]] dominated the early BPAA All-Star events, winning four times between 1952 and 1960.
* [[Mike Limongello]] won the first modern-day U.S. Open in 1971, defeating [[Teata Semiz]].
* [[Marshall Holman]] became the first multiple modern-day winner with victories in [[1981]] and [[1985]].
* The purse for the [[1987]] event, sponsored by [[Seagram]] Wine Coolers, was a then-record $500,000, with $100,000 going to the eventual winner, [[Del Ballard Jr.]]
* The [[1995]] event, at [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit]], set a bowling attendance record with 7,212 watching [[Dave Husted]] notch the second of his three U.S. Open Crowns.
* Pete Weber holds the record with four U.S. Open titles (1988, 1991, 2003-04, 2006-07).
* Earl Anthony never captured the U.S. Open, despite runner-up finishes in [[1973]], [[1979]] and [[1980]].
* [[Norm Duke]] became just the seventh bowler in PBA history to win two majors in one season when he captured the 2008 U.S. Open.  The victory was his 28th, putting him alone in sixth place on the PBA's all-time titles list, and made him the fifth Triple Crown winner (and second "grand slam" winner) in PBA history.

===The PBA National / Denny's World Championship===
{{main|Denny's World Championship}}

'''Current Defending Champion:''' '''''[[Norm Duke]]''''' 

* [[Don Carter (bowler)|Don Carter]] won the inaugural National Championship in 1960 in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], TN, defeating Ronnie Gaudern.  
* Hall of Famer [[Wayne Zahn]] became the first bowler to win this event twice, defeating [[Nelson Burton Jr.]] both times.  
* [[Earl Anthony]] staked his mastery in this event; twice capturing it three straight years (1973-75; 1981-83).  His [[1983]] victory was his 41st title, a record that would stand until [[Walter Ray Williams Jr.]] broke it in 2006-07.
* Fellow Hall of Famer [[Mike Aulby]] won this event in [[1979]], the first of his 27 PBA titles.  Ironically, he had to defeat Anthony to win.
* The following year, [[Johnny Petraglia]] won the final of his 14 titles at the [[Sterling Heights]], MI, event.  Petraglia became the second bowler to win bowling's original "Triple Crown" with this victory (after [[Billy Hardwick]]).
* A memorable 1994 PBA National featured brothers [[Dave Traber]] and [[Dale Traber]] squaring off in the final match, with Dave emerging victorious.
* With his runner-up finish in the [[2008]] event, [[Ryan Shafer]] set a record with his fourth runner-up finish in a PBA major event without a victory.  Overall, Shafer has made the TV finals in a PBA major event 10 times and has yet to win.

The PBA National Championship was renamed the World Championship in 2002-03.

===The Tournament Of Champions===
{{main|H&R Block Tournament of Champions}}

'''Current Defending Champion:''' '''''[[Michael Haugen Jr.]]'''''

* The Tournament of Champions has had many sponsors over the years; namely the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]].
* Hall of Famer [[Joe Joseph]] captured the first Tournament of Champions crown in 1962.
* [[Billy Hardwick]] won the Tournament of Champions in 1965, besting finalists Dick Weber and Joe Joseph in a two-game set, 484-468-404.  This was the first tourney in PBA history to offer a six-figure prize fund.
* [[George Pappas]] became one of the first bowlers to lead a tournament wire-to-wire (from opening game of qualifying to championship match) when he won the [[1979]] event.
* The [[1981]] edition saw the only double two-frame roll-off in championship round history, with [[Pete Couture]] finally emerging victorious over Earl Anthony in the second roll-off.  [[Steve Cook]] won the championship with a memorable 287 game over Couture, gaining the first ten strikes before leaving the 6-7 split.
* Only two men have ever won the TOC three times: [[Mike Durbin]] and [[Jason Couch]].  However, Couch's wins were in ''consecutive'' tournaments.

The three "original" major championships (Denny's World Championship, Tournament of Champions and U.S. Open) make up the PBA's "Triple Crown."  

Only five bowlers in the history of the PBA have won all three jewels of the Triple Crown in their careers: 

* [[Billy Hardwick]]
* [[Johnny Petraglia]]
* [[Mike Aulby]] 
* [[Pete Weber]]
* [[Norm Duke]]

Despite 44 and 41 titles respectively, Walter Ray Williams and Earl Anthony are not Triple Crown winners. As mentioned, Anthony never won the U.S. Open, though he finished runner-up in the event three times. Williams has yet to win the Tournament of Champions.

==Top 10 in PBA titles==
Through the close of the 2007-08 season, the following are the top titles winners in PBA Tour history (with regular tour titles in parenthesis): 
1. *[[Walter Ray Williams|Walter Ray Williams Jr.]] (44)
2. [[Earl Anthony]] (41)
T3. *[[Pete Weber]] (34)

T8. [[Don Johnson (bowler)|Don Johnson]] (26)
T8. [[Dick Weber]] (26)
10. [[Brian Voss]] (24)

* *Denotes active bowler currently on the PBA's exempt player list.

==PBA Hall of Fame==
The PBA Hall of Fame was founded in 1975 with eight initial inductees: Ray Bluth, Don Carter, Carmen Salvino, Harry Smith, Dick Weber, Billy Welu, Frank Esposito and Chuck Pezzano.  It is headquartered at the [[International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame]] in St. Louis, MO.

Through 2007, there are 81 PBA Hall of Fame Members in three categories:
* Performance (41)
* Meritorious Service (26)
* Veterans/Special Categories (14)

Membership in the Hall of Fame is determined by annual elections. Qualifications for induction in the Performance category have changed over the years, but the most recent ones (instituted in 2000) include:
* Must have been retired from full-time competition on the regular PBA Tour for at least five years, or reached age 50.
* Must have won at least 10 titles on the regular PBA Tour, or at least two major championships.

==PBA Player of the Year==
The PBA Player of the Year began being officially recognized in 1963. It was awarded by ''[[The Sporting News]]'' from 1963-70, and by the PBA membership from 1971-2007. Some factors used in the voting process for a given season included major titles, total titles, Tour average ranking, points ranking and TV finals appearances. In the 2007-08 season, a new Player of the Year system was instituted, where a points system only determines the winner.  [[Chris Barnes (bowler)|Chris Barnes]] became the first Player of the Year winner under this new system in 2008, edging out [[Walter Ray Williams Jr.]] by two points.

==PBA oil patterns==
Unlike the typical "league condition" or "house shot", which facilitates a fairly consistent pattern and wider target area, the PBA rotates five challenging lane oil patterns throughout the season.  The patterns -- known as Cheetah, Viper, Scorpion, Shark and Chameleon -- feature varying oil volumes and lengths that require pros to adjust ball angle, rotation and speed accordingly.  On some patterns, certain "strike lines" (areas of the lane) are unplayable, and spare shooting becomes much more important.  This means a 220 average on the PBA Tour would easily translate to 20-30 pins higher on a typical league shot.

Though most PBA pros tend to bowl their best on one or two of the PBA oil patterns, two players have managed to win at least one title on all five patterns: [[Mika Koivuniemi]] and [[Tommy Jones]].

==PBA in the media==
The PBA Tour was long known for its Saturday afternoon broadcasts prior to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television's ''[[Wide World of Sports (US TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]''. These broadcasts introduced viewers to bowling legends such as Anthony, [[Dick Weber]], [[Johnny Petraglia]], [[Mark Roth]], and Holman.  Roth and Holman, in particular, had an intense rivalry beginning in 1975 and lasting into the 1980s which drew many viewers; in its heyday, the [[Pro Bowlers Tour]] outranked all sporting events on Saturdays with the exception of [[college football]] telecasts.

The Pro Bowlers Tour lasted on ABC from 1961-1997.  [[Chris Schenkel]] was the main sportscaster, along with color commentator Billy Welu.  Upon Welu's passing in 1974, [[Nelson Burton Jr.]] joined Schenkel as color commentator.  Either Dick Weber or Johnny Petraglia would fill in as guest commentator on TV finals Burton competed in.  

[[HBO]] chipped in with sporadic PBA telecasts in the 1970s as the channel was being established.  During the 1980s, ABC would also televise the PBA's Spring Tour, with summer/fall telecasts originally covered by the [[USA Network]], announced by [[Larry Trautwig]].  Concurrently, from 1984 to 1991, [[NBC]] televised the PBA Fall Tour, with [[Jay Randolph]] and [[Earl Anthony]] providing commentary.

The 1991 Tournament of Champions was delayed for over thirty minutes at the start due to a bomb threat being phoned in at Rivera Lanes in [[Fairlawn, Ohio]].  The ABC telecast joined in during the evacuation's final stages and featured interviews with local officials, as well as classic clips from previous T of C telecasts.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaatvA_Sqw] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b18c95geVm4]

The 1997 ''St. Clair Classic'' was Schenkel and Burton's final telecast together, which included an emotional retrospective of Schenkel's 50-plus years in sportscasting.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIyu_BSFS5M]  In an interesting note, a Weber competed in the first (Dick Weber) and last (Pete Weber) ABC telecasts, spanning 36 years.

[[CBS]] televised the PBA in 1998-1999 with [[Gary Seidel]] and Holman commentating.  Since 2000, the PBA has exclusively been televised on ESPN.  [[Rob Stone]] handles play-by-play duties, with [[Randy Pedersen]] as color commentator.  At times, either [[Chris Barnes]] or [[Norm Duke]] serve as an additional color man on certain telecasts.

The PBA reached new audiences in 2005, when it was featured in the 2005 [[sports documentary]], ''[[A League of Ordinary Gentlemen]]''.  The documentary, filmed during the 2002-2003 season, enjoyed a limited release in theaters before being released in a DVD format in March 2006.

There have been 18 perfect games bowled on the nationally-televised final day of regular PBA tournaments.  Jack Biondolillo rolled the first one at the 1967 Tournament of Champions, and [[Ryan Shafer]] bowled the most recent one on [[March 18]], [[2007]], at the semifinals of the 2007 [[Pepsi]] Championship in [[Indianapolis]]. There have also been two on Senior PBA Tour telecasts, by Gene Stus (1992) and Ron Winger (1993). [[Bob Benoit]] owns the only televised 300 game that was shot in a title match (1988 Quaker State Open). [[Steve Jaros]] has the distinction of not only bowling one of the 18 televised 300 games, but also bowling the lowest televised score in history (129) in 1992.

A most memorable televised 299 game occurred on [[April 4]], [[1970]] when [[Don Johnson (bowler)|Don Johnson]] defeated [[Dick Ritger]] to win the 1970 Firestone Tournament of Champions.  With 11 strikes already down, he threw his 12th ball, stepped back and dropped to the floor.  The ball hit the pocket, but the 10-pin remained standing.  Johnson, still on the floor, briefly lowered his face into his hands, then stood up to a thunderous ovation.  Along with the trophy and $25,000 check from Firestone, Johnson also received the 10-pin that denied him both an extra $10,000 and a new Mercury Cougar automobile for a perfect game.

[[Mark Roth]], whose first career title was captured at the 1975 King Louie Open in [[Kansas]] by likewise rolling a 299 TV game, gained immortality by becoming the first bowler to convert the almost-impossible "7-10 split" on national television in the first match of the ARC Alameda Open on [[January 5]], [[1980]].  In 1991, [[John Mazza]] and [[Jess Stayrook]] also accomplished this feat on television.  During the 2005-06 season, [[Walter Ray Williams Jr.]] became the only bowler to convert the 4-6-7-10 combination on television.

In 2005, [[ESPN Classic]] began televising old bowling broadcasts daily, including some of the more memorable ones in which bowlers shot perfect games or records were set. All of the telecasts originally aired on either ABC or ESPN since those are the tapes to which the network owns the rights.

===PBA on ESPN commercials===

In 2005, ESPN and the PBA unveiled a series of comedic commercials with the [[catch phrase]] "Sundays are for Bowling" to promote the weekly televised bowling matches almost every Sunday during the season on ESPN. The commercials featured an unsuspecting black bowling ball unnoticeably sabotaging a person's routine Sunday activities. For instance, in one commercial, a man walks outside to his [[SUV]] only find a gaping hole in his [[canoe]] strapped to the vehicle's roof; the man then silently turns his head toward the lawn to find a black bowling ball staring back at him. The phrase "Sundays are for Bowling" then fades in on the screen followed by the promotional details.

In 2006, a new series of comedic television commercials appeared on ESPN. These commercials documented a group of average bowlers attending the fictional "Randy's Bowling Clinic", which is operated by an [[egotistical]] instructor named Randy. In each commercial, Randy insults his students and teaches them silly theatrics instead of actual bowling skills.

Those promotions have not aired in 2007-08.  Today, sponsors such as [[Denny's]] (featuring Walter Ray Williams Jr.) and [[Motel 6]] are regularly featured on ESPN broadcasts.
