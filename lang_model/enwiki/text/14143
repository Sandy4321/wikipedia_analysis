==History==
The North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University was established as a "mechanical college" for the "Colored Race" by an act of the [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly of North Carolina]], ratified March 9, 1891.<ref>[http://fac.ncat.edu/pr-test/hotnews/history.html NC A&T History]</ref> The act read in part: "That the leading objective of the college shall be to teach practical agriculture and the mechanic arts and such learning as related thereto, not excluding academic and classical instruction."  This college was established along with North Carolina Agricultural and Mechanical College, now known as North Carolina State University; due to segregation laws, whites and blacks could not attend college together. The college operated in Raleigh at the private [[Shaw University]] until 1893, when donations from Dr. Dewitt, C. Benbow and Charles H. Moore totaling $11,000 and 14 acres (57,000 m<U+00B2>) of land allowed the establishment of a campus in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]].  The original course of study of A&T included languages and literature, mathematics, business, agriculture and military science. Female students enrolled from 1893 until 1901, but not again until 1928. In 1915, the name of the College became The Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina by act of the NC General Assembly.

On February 1, 1960, four A&T freshmen helped spark the civil rights movement in the [[Southern United States|South]]. Ezell Blair (Jibreel Khazan), Joseph McNeil, Franklin McCain, and David Richmond "sat-in" at an all white eating establishment (Woolworth's) and demanded equal service at the lunch counter. Because of their great desire for change and equality they inspired many other students of the university to join them in their non-violent protest to desegregate Woolworth's lunch counter. By the end of July 1960, their mission was accomplished and they became the A&T Four and their campaign became known as the [[Greensboro sit-ins]].<ref>[http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/ Civil Rights Greensboro]</ref> Seven years later, the college gained university status and became North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.

On February 25, 2009, Chancellor Stanley Battle announced his resignation, effective June 30, 2009, citing family and personal issues.<ref>[http://www.newsobserver.com/news/higher_education/story/1417914.html News & Observer: N.C. A&T losing its chancellor]</ref>  The following month, on May 22, 2009, Dr. Harold L. Martin Sr. was elected as the 12th chancellor of the university by UNC System Board of Governors.

===Marching band===
The athletic teams at the university are supported by The North Carolina A&T State University Blue & Gold Marching Machine, the university's [[marching band]]. The entire 210-member volunteer band typically performs at football games, parades, and battle of the bands from September through the month of November. Additionally, the smaller pep bands play at all home basketball games.

====History====
Started in 1918, By Mr. W. E. Lew, the band program,  has grown from a 50-piece ensemble grew to the 210 member band of Today. It was not until the 1930s that marching band was offered as an extracurricular activity. During this time, A&T had the distinction of being the only Historically Black college in North Carolina with a band. In the mid 1960s, the band introduced the concept of majorettes and flag twirlers. In the late 1970s to early 1980s, the band underwent a change in leadership. Mr. Jimmy Williams and Dr. Johnny B. Hodge, Jr. became the directors of the band. During this era, the marching band also was renamed to the current <U+201C>Blue & Gold Marching Machine<U+201D> moniker. Dr. Hodge's tenure as the director of band's spanned over four decades. It was not until Hodge's retirement in 2003, that then assistant of bands, Dr. Kenneth Ruff, became the director. In Addition to Dr. Ruff, the Blue and Gold Marching Machine's leadership also includes assistant director of bands, Mr. Brian Millsap. The Blue and Gold Marching Machine has performed in many major performances including the Macy<U+2019>s Day Parade in [[New York City]], the 2009 [[Honda Battle of the Bands]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and also performing in the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] in [[Pontiac, Michigan.]]

The band currently is divided by into 11 sections; 9 of which consist of instrumentalist. Each section is run by its own section leader(s). Those sections: Ebony Queens and Kings (Clarinets), Essence of Silver ([[piccolo]]s), Saxually Active ([[Saxophone]]s), Scream Machine ([[Trumpet]]s), Sonic Boom ([[French Horn]]s), Freight Train ([[Trombone]]s), Crucial EU ([[Euphonium]]s), Thundar Brothers ([[Sousaphone]]s), Cold Steel ([[Percussion]]), Golden Delight ([[Baton Twirling|Baton twirlers]]/Dancers/Flags) and Smooth Ignition (Drum Majors)

====Marching Style====
The Blue & Gold Marching Machine utilizes a variation of the high step marching style. This involves the lifting of the knee with legs directly in front, thighs parallel to the ground, and toes pointed downward. When the leg is elevated, there should be a 90-degree angle with the body and the thigh, and a 90-degree angle with the thigh and the shin. The leg is then lowered, and this is repeated with the other leg. This is informally referred to as the "chair step". This is also the style commonly found in many HBCU bands.

===Media===
The students of NC A&T SU contribute to the university's official media outlets.
WNNA 90.1 FM is The School's Official [[Radio]] Station '''WNAA 90.1 FM A&T Radio Station''' and The A&T Register is The School's Student [[Newspaper]].
