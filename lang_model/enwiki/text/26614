'''Boles<U+0142>aw IV the Curly''' ({{Lang-pl|'''Boles<U+0142>aw K<U+0119>dzierzawy'''}}) (ca. 1125 <U+2013> 3 April 1173) from the [[Piast dynasty]] was [[Duke of Masovia]] since 1138 and [[List of Polish monarchs|High Duke of Poland]] from 1146 until his death.

He was the third son of Duke [[Boles<U+0142>aw III Wrymouth]] of [[Poland during the Piast dynasty|Poland]] by his second wife [[Salomea of Berg|Salomea]], daughter of the [[Duke of Swabia|Swabian]] count Henry of Berg. The death of his older brothers, Leszek and Casimir, in August and October 1131, respectively, left him as the eldest son of their parents.

==Life==
=== Boles<U+0142>aw III's Testament and inheritance of the Masovian Province ===
Boles<U+0142>aw was 13 years old at the time of his father's death (1138) and of the legal age to take on the government of the lands he inherited according to [[Testament of Boles<U+0142>aw III Krzywousty|his father's testament]], the newly created [[Duchy of Masovia]] (composed by [[Masovia]] and eastern [[Kuyavia]]). Because his main domain was Masovia, the prince was called ''Boles<U+0142>aw of Masovia''. 

In the first years of his government, young Boles<U+0142>aw remained under the strong influence of his mother Salomea and the [[Voivode]] Wszebor, who feared the ambition of his elder half-brother High Duke [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II the Exile|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II]] (the first-born son of the late duke by his first wife [[Zbyslava of Kiev]]). W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II tried to restore the unity of the country and deposed the Junior Dukes.

===First Part of the conflict with High Duke W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II===
The disputes with the High-Duke began openly in 1141, when the Dowager Duchess Salomea -without the consent of High Duke W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II-, organized a meeting with her sons at her residence in [[<U+0141><U+0119>czyca]]. Here was decided the betrothal of her youngest daughter [[Agnes of Poland|Agnes]] with [[Mstislav II of Kiev]], a scion of the [[Rurik Dynasty]] <U+2014> in order to gain allies in a possible conflict <U+2014> and the division of the <U+0141><U+0119>czyca lands between Salomea's sons upon her death. However, the Junior Dukes in this first struggle were definitely defeated, because the Kievan Grand Prince [[Vsevolod II of Kiev|Vsevolod II]] decided to made an alliance with W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II, reinforced by the marriage of Vsevolod's daughter Zvenislava with the High Duke's eldest son [[Boles<U+0142>aw I the Tall]]. An additional humiliation for Boles<U+0142>aw IV and his brothers was that they were sent by the High Duke on an expedition to the [[Kievan Rus']] as ambassadors during 1142-1143.

The "peace" lasted only two years until 1144 when, after Salomea's death and according to the Boles<U+0142>aw III's Testament, the <U+0141><U+0119>czyca province reverted to the [[Seniorate Province]] of High Duke W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II. The idea to reserve the lands for his minor brothers [[Henry of Sandomierz|Henry]] and [[Casimir II the Just|Casimir II]] was not popular with Wladyslaw, who thought that the land was only temporarily separated from his ''Dzielnica senioralna'' and now in its entirety should be returned. Outbreak of civil war was therefore only a matter of time. 

The war erupted with full force in 1145, and it seemed that the Junior Dukes were defeated and the High Duke finally achieved the unification of the country. At first the combined forces of Boles<U+0142>aw IV and his brothers prevented the disaster and demanded a hasty reorganization of the forces of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw at the Battle on the Pilic<U+0105> River. The major significance of this battle was to the former voivode Wszebor, whose military experience far exceeded the ability of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's commanders. Soon, however, the situation was totally reversed as a result of the Kievan troops who entered in the country as W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's allies. Boles<U+0142>aw then had to agree to step down and renounce any pretension over the lands belonging to his mother. 

The concessions of the Junior Dukes ultimately didn't resolve the problem. Moreover, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's confidence in his forces had him embark on a final solution, the removal of his stepbrothers from their lands. Suddenly, the Junior Dukes could rely on the support of the High Duke's all-powerful voivoide [[Piotr W<U+0142>ostowic]], for whom W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's plans were too radical and threatened to weaken his position. While W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw opted for a quick response against him (the voivode was blinded and muted), forcing W<U+0142>ostowic to go to [[Kiev]], the High Duke's final decision on his confrontation with the voivode considerably weakened his position. What's more, W<U+0142>ostowic convinced the Kievans to break his alliance with W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw.

===W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II is expelled from the country. Boles<U+0142>aw IV, High Duke of Poland===
At the beginning of 1146 the rebellions against W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's government rose mighty, sparked by the fate of Piotr W<U+0142>ostowic. Nevertheless, the final victory of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw seemed likely, especially after the conquest of Masovia (forcing Boles<U+0142>aw to escape) and the siege of [[Poznan]] in [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Poland]] in the spring of 1146. However, thanks to the rebellion in W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's own lands, and the excommunication imposed to him by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Archbishop of Gniezno]], the High Duke suffered an unexpected defeat. W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw and his family had to flee across the border with the [[Holy Roman Empire]], at first to [[Bohemia]] and later to [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]], accommodated by King [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]]. 

The Junior Dukes reasigned the Polish provinces between them. The [[Duchy of Silesia]] and the Seniorate Province at [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] were taken by Boles<U+0142>aw, who also received the title of High Duke, the western Duchy of Greater Poland was retained by his brother [[Mieszko III the Old|Mieszko III]], and Henry finally received his long-promised Land of [[Sandomierz]]. Casimir II, the youngest brother, again remained without lands.

===Expedition of King Conrad III of Germany and recognition of the authority of the Junior Dukes===
Thanks to the intrigues of his wife [[Agnes of Babenberg]], a half-sister of King Conrad III, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II succeeded in convincing his brother-in-law to make a military expedition to Poland. The hastily organized expedition however clashed with the reluctance of the former subjects of the deposed High Duke, and was finally defeated already on the Polish border near the [[Oder]] river in August 1146. 

In subsequent years, Boles<U+0142>aw IV along with his younger brothers bellows sought to maintain good relations with the royal [[House of Hohenstaufen]], W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's allies. To this end, in 1148 the Junior Dukes organized a meeting in [[Kruszwica]], to which they invited the warlike Margrave [[Albert the Bear]] of the German [[Northern March]] (the later [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]]), who had reached the Polish border in the course of the [[Wendish Crusade]]. There, Boles<U+0142>aw arranged the marriage of his sister [[Judith of Poland|Judith]] with the margrave's son [[Otto I, Margrave of Brandenburg|Otto]]. Boleslaw and Mieszko also militarily supported the Germans in the fight against the reluctant West Slavic [[Lutici]] tribes, considerably contributing to the stability of German domination over the middle [[Spree]] region. The second important ally of the Piast prince was the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margrave [[Conrad, Margrave of Meissen|Konrad of Meissen]]. 

Initially, Boles<U+0142>aw also had a difficult relationship with another opposing force policy like the Hohenstaufens: the [[Roman Curia]] under of [[Pope Eugene III]]. At first in 1147 the Papal legate Humbold recognized Boles<U+0142>aw as the new High Duke and overlord of Poland. However, one year later, and again instigated by the intrigues of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's wife Agnes, the newly Papal legate Guy arrived to the country in connection with the refusal to restore the former High Duke, and declared the ban over Poland. The penalty, thanks for the cohesive support of the Polish church hierarchy by the Junior Dukes, was virtually without repercussions.

===Expedition of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa to Poland. The final recognition of the authority of Boles<U+0142>aw IV===
Things worsened for Boles<U+0142>aw in 1157, when King Conrad's nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] by [[Pope Adrian IV]] in 1155, decided to made a new expedition to Poland, thanks to the ongoing pressures by his aunt Agnes, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's wife. This time the campaign was well organized, and the Emperor was well determined to force Boles<U+0142>aw IV to accept his own conditions. It's unknown why Boles<U+0142>aw opted for a highly security tactics of war, not defending the swampy areas in front of the middle Oder river, which was for centuries the natural defense of Poland, nor the strongholds of [[G<U+0142>og<U+00F3>w]] and [[Bytom Odrza<U+0144>ski|Bytom]] in Silesia. The Imperial army quickly advanced and soon laid siege to Poznan. 

Given the difficult situation, Boles<U+0142>aw was forced to accept the humiliating negotiations and in a shameful{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} ceremony on 30 August 1157, was declared a vassal of the Empire at his camp in [[Krzyszkowo]]. Boles<U+0142>aw was in his knees and beg for forgiveness to the Emperor, in return for which he kindly received from Barbarossa the further control over the Polish lands; also, he had to pay an enormous tribute to Emperor. For unknown reasons however, despite Barbarossa's victory, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II to his great disappointment was not restored in the Polish throne. Boles<U+0142>aw formally swore loyalty to the Emperor on [[Christmas Day]] in [[Magdeburg]], and gave his younger brother, Casimir II, as a hostage. Two years later W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw died in exile, having never returned to his country again.

===Return of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II's sons to Silesia===
Not before 1163 the sons of the late W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw, [[Boles<U+0142>aw I the Tall]] and [[Mieszko IV Tanglefoot]], backed by the Emperor insisting on the agreement made with Boles<U+0142>aw IV, were restored in their Silesia heritage; but this return didn't affect the power of Boles<U+0142>aw as a High Duke and overlord of Poland. Thanks to its German affinities, the senior branch of the [[Silesian Piasts]] at least managed to retain its Silesian lands ([[Wroc<U+0142>aw]], [[Legnica]], [[G<U+0142>og<U+00F3>w]], [[Opole]] and [[Racib<U+00F3>rz]]) without problems.

===Crusade against the Prussians===
Following the defeat by the German forces, Boles<U+0142>aw initiated a bold plan for the conquest of the pagan [[Old Prussians|Prussians]], settling beyond the northeastern Polish border along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast. This concept of an early [[Prussian Crusade]] was conceived in view of the repeated seizures by more and more [[Balts|Baltic]] tribes in the several districts of Boles<U+0142>aw's Masovian province. The High Duke proclaimed a "crusade" against the pagans and pressured the collaboration of both the Pope and the Emperor. The whole efforts and attempts to acquire these province were finally defeated in 1166. Furthermore during one of the battles the younger brother of the High Duke, Henry of Sandomierz, was killed.

===Rebellion of Casimir II the Just. Relations with the Silesian Dukes===
After Henry's death, against the dispositions of the Boles<U+0142>aw III's Testament, the High Duke incorporated Sandomierz into the Seniorate Province. This caused the anger and frustration of his youngest brother, Casimir II the Just, who was the next in line to inherit the lands and was the only of Boles<U+0142>aw III' sons still without any land.

Casimir was supported in his rebellion by his elder brother Duke Mieszko III the Old of Greater Poland, the magnate [[Jaksa of Miech<U+00F3>w]] and Sviatoslav, son of Voivode [[Piotr W<U+0142>ostowic]], as well as the Archbishops of Gniezno and [[Archbishop of Krak<U+00F3>w|Krak<U+00F3>w]]; also, almost all [[Lesser Poland|Leeser Polish]] nobility was on his side. In February 1168 the rebels gathered in [[J<U+0119>drzej<U+00F3>w]], and there they proclaimed Mieszko III as the new High Duke and Casimir was formally invested with Sandomierz. But at the end Boles<U+0142>aw maintained his rule by largely accepting the demands of rebels; he divided late Henry's duchy in three parts: the lands of [[Wi<U+015B>lica]] were granted to Casimir, Boles<U+0142>aw himself obtained Sandomierz proper and the rest passed to Mieszko III. 

After the disaster of the Prussian Crusade, the Silesian dukes Boles<U+0142>aw I the Tall and Mieszko IV Tanglefoot attempted to dethrone the High Duke and to recover the Seniorate Province and thereby the Polish overlordship. Boles<U+0142>aw's reprisal expedition in the following year ended with a total disaster, so the High Duke eventually had to reconcile with his Silesian nephews. 

In 1172 Duke Mieszko III rebelled again; this time supporting his grandnephew [[Jaros<U+0142>aw, Duke of Opole|Jaros<U+0142>aw of Opole]] (the eldest son of Boles<U+0142>aw I the Tall), who, forced to become a priest in his early years, was barred from the Silesian succession. Unsatisfied with this, Jaros<U+0142>aw tried to gain power and obtain his own lands. The support of this rebellion was so strong, that his father was forced to escape to [[Erfurt]]. This originated another expedition in his aid by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who again invaded Poland and defeated the rebels. The High Duke ordered Mieszko III to Magdeburg where peace was made with the Empire after the payment of 8,000 pieces of silver and the Silesian duchy was again granted to Boles<U+0142>aw I the Tall at the Emperor's mercy; despite his victory, the High Duke finally accepted the autonomy of his Silesian nephews.

Shortly afterwards another rebellion took place, this time of the Lesser Polish nobles, who were extremely dissatisfied with the harsh and dictatorial High Duke's government. The rebels invited Casimir II, then Duke of Wi<U+015B>lica, to take the Krak<U+00F3>w throne, but Boles<U+0142>aw's resistance against his younger brother was so strong that both parties made concessions, who led finished with any riots until the end of the High Duke's reign. Casimir succeeded Boles<U+0142>aw in Sandomierz upon his death in 1173 and became High Duke four years later.

===Relations with the Church===
Boles<U+0142>aw was also known for his many gifts and grants to the Church. Particularly enriched thanks to him, among others were: the Church of St. Mary and St. Catherine and of St. Vincent near Wroc<U+0142>aw, the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery in [[Trzemeszno]] and the [[Collegiate church in Tum]] near <U+0141><U+0119>czyca. Around 1151 he founded the Canonical Regular Kolegiata in [[Czerwi<U+0144>sk]].

==Marriages and Issue==
In 1137 Boles<U+0142>aw married firstly with [[Viacheslava of Novgorod|Viacheslava]] (b. ca. 1125 - d. 15 March ca. 1162?), daughter of [[Vsevolod Mstislavich of Novgorod and Pskov|St. Vsevolod]], Prince of [[Novgorod]] and [[Pskov]]. They had three children:
#Boles<U+0142>aw (b. 1156 <U+2013> d. 1172)
#A daughter (b. ca. 1160 <U+2013> d. aft. 1178), married ca. 1172/73 to [[Vasilko Iaropolkovich]], Prince of [[Shumsk]] and [[Dorohychyn]].
#[[Leszek, Duke of Masovia|Leszek]] (b. ca. 1162 <U+2013> d. 1186).

After the death of his first wife, Boles<U+0142>aw married with a woman called [[Maria (wife of Boles<U+0142>aw IV the Curly)|Maria]] (d. aft. 1173), whose origins are disputed. This union was childless.<ref>Earlier historians believed that Leszek was born of Boles<U+0142>aw IV's second marriage, but after the discovery of coins where Leszek called himself ''son of Anastasia'' (Greek of Latin equivalent of Boles<U+0142>aw IV's first wife name) this theory proved to be inaccurate. Borys Paszkiewicz, ''O matce Lestka Boles<U+0142>awica i pocz<U+0105>tkach mennictwa mazowieckiego'', Przegl<U+0105>d Historyczny, vol. 92 (2001), pp. 1-14.</ref>

Boles<U+0142>aw's eldest son died in 1172 aged sixteen and reportedly the High Duke was devastated by his death. He was succeeded in the Masovian-Kujavian principality by his second and only surviving son Leszek, at the age of eleven or less. As overlord and holder of [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] and [[Gniezno]], he however was succeeded by his next brother [[Mieszko III the Old]], Duke of Greater Poland.
