The onset of a common Russian [[protectorate]] which lasted until 1854, and itself in force until 1858, the document signified a partial confirmation of traditional government (including rule by the ''[[hospodar]]s''). [[Conservatism|Conservative]] in its scope, it also engendered a period of unprecedented reforms which provided a setting for the [[Westernization]] of local society. The ''Regulament'' offered the two Principalities their first common system of government.

{{main|History of the Russo-Turkish Wars|Phanariotes}}
The two principalities, owing [[tribute]] and progressively ceding political control to the [[Ottoman Empire]] since the [[Romania in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]],<ref>Djuvara,  p. 24, 57.</ref> had been subject to frequent Russian interventions as early as the [[Russo-Turkish War (1710<U+2013>1711)]],<ref>Djuvara, p. 31, 76<U+2013>7.</ref> when a Russian army penetrated Moldavia and [[List of Russian rulers|Emperor]] [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] probably established links with the Wallachians.<ref>Djuvara, p. 31.</ref> Eventually, the Ottomans enforced a tighter control on the region, effected under [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] ''hospodars'' (who were appointed directly by the [[Porte]]).<ref>Djuvara, pp. 41<U+2013>58.</ref> Ottoman rule over the region remained contested by competition from Russia, which, as an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] empire with claim to a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] heritage, exercised notable influence over locals.<ref>Djuvara, p. 284<U+2013>5, 308.</ref> At the same time, the Porte made several concessions to the rulers and boyars of Moldavia and Wallachia, as a means to ensure the preservation of its rule.<ref>Djuvara, p. 57, 92<U+2013>3, 123.</ref>

The [[Treaty of K<U+00FC><U+00E7><U+00FC>k Kaynarca]], signed in 1774 between the Ottomans and Russians, gave Russia the right to intervene on behalf of Eastern Orthodox Ottoman subjects in general, a right which it used to sanction Ottoman interventions in the Principalities in particular.<ref>Djuvara, p. 81, 284.</ref> Thus, Russia intervened to preserve reigns of ''hospodars'' who had lost Ottoman approval in the context of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (the ''[[casus belli]]'' for the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806<U+2013>1812)|1806<U+2013>12 conflict]]),<ref name = "Djuvara 282-4">Djuvara, pp. 282<U+2013>4.</ref> and remained present in the Danubian states, vying for influence with the [[Austrian Empire]], well into the 19th century and annexing Moldavia's [[Bessarabia]] in 1812.<ref>Djuvara, pp.133, 184<U+2013>7, 281<U+2013>304.</ref>

Despite the influx of [[Greeks in Romania|Greeks]], arriving in the Principalities as a new [[bureaucracy]] favored by the ''hospodars'', the traditional [[Estates of the realm]] (the ''[[Sfatul boieresc|Divan]]'') remained under the tight control of a number of high [[boyar]] families, who, while intermarrying with members of newly-arrived communities, opposed reformist attempts &mdash; and successfully preserved their [[privilege]]s by appealing against their competitors to both [[Istanbul]] and [[Saint Petersburg]].<ref>Djuvara, pp. 69, 123<U+2013>7.</ref> 

[[Image:Rom1793-1812.png|thumb|left|200px|Moldavia (in orange) and Wallachia (in green), between 1793 and 1812]]
In the last decades of the 18th century, the growing strategic importance of the region brought about the establishment of [[consul (representative)|consulates]] representing European powers directly interested in observing local developments (Russia, the Austrian Empire, and [[France]]; later, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] ones were opened as well).<ref>Djuvara, pp. 81<U+2013>82.</ref><ref name = "Iorga">Iorga, ''Histoire des relations. La Monarchie de juillet<U+2026>''</ref>  An additional way for consuls to exercise particular policies was the awarding of a privileged status and protection to various individuals, who were known as ''[[sudi<U+0163>i]]'' ("subjects", in the language of the time) of one or the other of the foreign powers.<ref>Djuvara, pp. 184<U+2013>7.</ref><ref name = "Giurescu 288">Giurescu, p. 288.</ref><ref name = "Iorga" />

A seminal event occurred in 1821, when the rise of Greek [[nationalism]] in various parts of the [[Balkans]] in connection with the [[Greek War of Independence]] led to occupation of the two states by the [[Filiki Eteria]], a Greek [[secret society]] who sought, and initially obtained, Russian approval. A mere takeover of the government in Moldavia, the Eterist expedition met a more complex situation in Wallachia, where a [[Regent|regency]] of high boyars attempted to have the anti-Ottoman Greek nationalists confirm both their rule and the rejection of Phanariote institutions. A compromise was achieved through their common support for [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], an [[Oltenia]]n ''[[pandur]]'' leader who had already instigated an [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|anti-Phanariote rebellion]] (as one of the Russian ''sudi<U+0163>i'', it was hoped that Vladimirescu could assure Russia that the revolt was not aimed against its influence). However, the eventual withdrawal of Russian support made Vladimirescu seek a new agreement with the Ottomans, leaving him to be executed by an alliance of Eterists and weary locals (alarmed by his new anti-boyar program); after the Ottomans invaded the region and crushed the Eteria, the boyars, still perceived as a third party, obtained from the Porte an end to the Phanariote system<ref>Djuvara, pp. 296<U+2013>301.</ref><ref name = "Giurescu 114-5">Giurescu, pp. 114<U+2013>5.</ref><ref name = "Hitchins 178-91">Hitchins, pp. 178<U+2013>91.</ref><ref name = "Iorga Roumains">Iorga, ''Histoire des Roumains.

==Akkerman Convention and Treaty of Adrianople==

[[Image:Galatzi 1826.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Moldavia]]n [[Danube]] port of [[Gala<U+0163>i]] (1826)]]
The first reigns through locals &mdash; [[Ioan Sturdza|Ioni<U+0163><U+0103> Sandu Sturdza]] as [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince of Moldavia]] and [[Grigore IV Ghica]] as [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince of Wallachia]] &mdash; were, in essence, short-lived: although the [[clientelism|patron-client relation]] between Phanariote ''hospodars'' and a foreign ruler was never revived, Sturdza and Ghica were deposed by the Russian military intervention during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828<U+2013>1829]]. Sturdza's time on the throne was marked by an important internal development: the last in a series of constitutional proposals,<ref>Djuvara, 318.</ref><ref name = "Ru<U+00DF>o VI-VII">Russo, VI<U+2013>VII.</ref> advanced by boyars as a means to curb princely authority, ended in a clear conflict between the rapidly-decaying class of low-ranking boyars (already forming the upper level of the [[middle class]] rather than a segment of the traditional nobility) and the high-ranking families who had obtained the decisive say in politics. The proponent, [[Ionic<U+0103> T<U+0103>utu]],<ref>Russo, VI.</ref> was defeated in the ''Divan'' after the Russian consul sided with the conservatives (expressing the official view that the [[mixed government|aristocratic-republican]] and [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] aims of the document could have threatened international conventions in place).<ref>Djuvara, pp. 318<U+2013>9.</ref><ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /> 

On October 7, 1826, the Ottoman Empire <U+2014> anxious to prevent Russia's intervention in the Greek Independence War <U+2014> negotiatied with it a new status for the region in [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Akkerman]], one which conceded to several requests of the inhabitants: the resulting ''[[Convention of Akkerman|Akkerman Convention]]'' was the first official document to nullify the principle of Phanariote reigns, instituting seven-year terms for new princes elected by the respective ''Divans'', and awarding the two countries the right to engage in unresticted [[international trade]] (as opposed to the tradition of limitations and Ottoman [[protectionism]], it only allowed Istanbul to impose its priorities in the [[grain trade]]).<ref name = "Djuvara 320">Djuvara, p. 320.</ref><ref name = "Hitchins 198-9">Hitchins, pp. 198<U+2013>9.</ref><ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /> The convention also made the first mention of new ''Statutes'', enforced by both powers as governing documents, which were not drafted until after the war &mdash; although both Sturdza and Ghica had appointed commissions charged with adopting such projects.<ref name = "Djuvara 323">Djuvara, p. 323.</ref>

The Russian military presence on the Principalities' soil was inaugurated in the first days of the war: by late April 1828, the Russian army of [[Peter Wittgenstein]] had reached the [[Danube]] (in May, it entered present-day [[Bulgaria]]).<ref name = "Djuvara 320" />  The campaign, prolonged for the following year and coinciding with devastating [[bubonic plague]] and [[cholera]] epidemics (which together killed around 1.6% of the population in both countries),<ref name = "Giurescu 122">Giurescu, p. 122.</ref> soon became a drain on local economy:<ref>Hitchins, p. 192.</ref> according to British observers, the Wallachian state was required to indebt itself to European creditors for a total sum of ten million ''[[piastre]]s'', in order to provide for the Russian army's needs.<ref>Djuvara, pp. 321<U+2013>2.</ref> Accusations of widespread plunder were made by the French author [[Marc Girardin]], who travelled in the region during the 1830s; Girardin alleged that Russian troops had confiscated virtually all cattle for their needs, and that Russian officers had insulted the political class by publicly stating that, in case the supply in oxen was to prove insufficient, boyars were to be tied to carts in their place &mdash; an accusation backed by [[Ion Ghica]] in his recollections.<ref>Ghica, ''B<U+00E2>rzof''.</ref><ref name = "Girardin 321">Girardin, in Djuvara, p. 321.</ref> He also recorded a mounting dissatifaction with the new rule, mentioning that peasants were especially upset by the continuous maneuvers of troops inside the Principalities' borders.<ref name = "Girardin 323">Girardin, in Djuvara, p. 323, writing down (1836) the words of a peasant who expressed his skepticism upon receiving news of Russian withdrawal in 1834: "<U+2026>I see them leaving, returning, and turning their backs on each other, as if dancing. In order for them to leave, they would have to turn their backs on us, all of them, at once!"</ref> Overall, [[Russophilia]] in the two Principalities appears to have suffered a major blow.<ref name="Pavlowitch ch3 51"/> Despite the confiscations, statistics of the time indicated that the pace of growth in heads of cattle remained steady (a 50% growth appears to have occurred between 1831 and 1837).<ref>Djuvara, p. 232.</ref>

The [[Treaty of Adrianople]], signed on September 14, 1829, confirmed both the Russian victory and the provisions of the Akkerman Convention, partly amended to reflect the Russian political ascendancy over the area. Furthermore, Wallachia's southern border was settled on the Danube ''[[thalweg]]'', and the state was given control over the previously Ottoman-ruled ports of [[Br<U+0103>ila]], [[Giurgiu]], and [[Turnu M<U+0103>gurele]].<ref name = "Djuvara 323" /><ref name = "Giurescu 122 127">Giurescu, pp. 122, 127.</ref> The freedom of commerce (which consisted mainly of grain exports from the region) and freedom of navigation on the river and on the [[Black Sea]] were passed into law, allowing for the creation of [[naval fleet]]s in both Principalities in the following years, as well as for a more direct contact with European traders, with the confirmation of the Moldavia and Wallachia's commercial privileges first stipulated at Akkerman (alongside the tight links soon established with Austrian and [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia|Sardinian]] traders, the first French ships visited Wallachia in 1830).<ref name = "Iorga" />

Russian occupation over Moldavia and Wallachia (as well as the Bulgarian town of [[Silistra]]) was prolonged pending the payment of [[war reparation]]s by the Ottomans. [[List of rulers of Russia|Emperor]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] assigned [[Fyodor Petrovich Pahlen|Fyodor Pahlen]] as governor over the two countries before the actual peace, as the first in a succession of three ''Plenipotentiary Presidents of the Divans in Moldavia and Wallachia'',<ref name = "Giurescu 122" /><ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /> and official supervisor of the two commissions charged with drafting the ''Statutes''. The bodies, having for secretaries [[Gheorghe Asachi]] in Moldavia and [[Barbu Dimitrie <U+015E>tirbei]] in Wallachia, had resumed their work while the cholera epidemic was still raging, and continued it after Pahlen had been replaced with [[Pyotr Zheltukhin]] in February 1829.<ref name="Giurescu 123"/>

==Adoption and character==
[[Image:Kiseleff.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pavel Kiselyov]]]]
The post-Adrianople state of affairs was perceived by many of the inhabitants of Wallachia and Moldavia as exceptionally abusive, given that Russia confiscated both of the Principalities' [[treasury|treasuries]],<ref>Hitchins, p. 200.</ref> and that Zheltukhin used his position to interfere in the proceedings of the commission, nominated his own choice of members, and silenced all opposition by having anti-Russian boyars expelled from the countries (including, notably, [[Iancu V<U+0103>c<U+0103>rescu]], a member of the Wallachian ''[[Sfatul boieresc|Divan]]'' who had questioned his methods of government).<ref name = "Djuvara 323" />  According to the [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] Ghica, "General Zheltukhin [and his subordinates] defended all Russian abuse and injustice. Their system consisted in never listening to complaints, but rather rushing in with accusations, so as to inspire fear, so as the plaintiff would run away for fear of not having to endure a harsher thing than the cause of his [original] complaint".  However, the same source also indicated that this behaviour was hiding a more complex situation: "Those who nevertheless knew Zheltukhin better<U+2026> said that he was the fairest, most honest, and most kind of men, and that he gave his cruel orders with an aching heart. Many gave assurance that he had addressed to the emperor heart-breaking reports on the deplorable state in which the Principalities were to be found, in which he stated that Russia's actions in the Principalities deserved the scorn of the entire world".<ref>Ghica, ''B<U+00E2>rzof''</ref>

The third and last Russian governor, [[Pavel Kiselyov]] (or ''Kiseleff''), took office on October 19, 1829, and faced his first major task in dealing with the last outbreaks of plague and cholera, as well as the threat of [[famine]],<ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 51">Pavlowitch, Chapter 3, p. 51.</ref> with which he dealt by imposing [[quarantine]]s and importing grain from [[Odessa]].<ref name = "Hitchins 202">Hitchins, p. 202.</ref> His administration, lasting until April 1, 1834, was responsible for the most widespread and influential reforms of the period, and coincided with the actual enforcement of the new legislation. The of earliest Kiselyov's celebrated actions was the convening of the Wallachian ''Divan'' in November 1829, with the assurance that abuses were not to be condoned anymore.<ref>Hitchins, p. 201.</ref>

''Regulamentul Organic'' was adopted in its two very similar versions<ref>Differences were only obvious in regard to [[government budget]]s and restrictions on the respective total military forces (Giurescu, p. 123).</ref> on July 13, 1831 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|July 1, OS]]) in Wallachia and January 13, 1832 (January 1, OS) in Moldavia, after having minor changes applied to it in Saint Petersburg (where a second commission from the Principalities, presided by [[Mihail Sturdza]] and [[Alexandru Vilara]], assessed it further).  Its [[ratification]] by [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] was not a requirement from Kiselyov's perspective, who began enforcing it as a ''[[fait accompli]]'' before this was granted.<ref>Hitchins, p. 203.</ref> The final version of the document sanctioned the first local government abiding by the principles of [[separation of powers|separation]] and [[balance of powers]]. The ''[[hospodars]]'', elected for life (and not for the seven year-term agreed in the ''[[Convention of Akkerman]]'') by an Extraordinary Assembly which comprised [[representation (politics)|representatives]] of merchands and [[guild]]s, stood for the [[executive (government)|executive]], with the right to nominate ministers (whose offices were still referred to using the [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|traditional titles of courtiers]]) and [[public official]]s;<ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 51" /> ''hospodars'' were to be voted in office by an [[electoral college]] with a confirmed majority of high-ranking boyars (in Wallachia, only 70 persons were members of the college).<ref>Djuvara, p. 323, 325.</ref> 

[[Image:Ob<U+015F>teasca Adunare, 1837.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Sfatul boieresc|National Assembly]] of [[Wallachia]] in 1837]]
Each National Assembly (approximate translation of ''Adunarea Ob<U+015F>teasc<U+0103>''), inaugurated in 1831<U+2013>2, was a [[legislature]] itself under the control of high-ranking boyars, comprising 35 (in Moldavia) or 42 members (in Wallachia), voted into office by no more than 3,000 electors in each state; the [[judiciary]] was, for the very first time, removed from the control of ''hospodars''.<ref>Djuvara, pp. 323<U+2013>4.</ref><ref name = "Hitchins 204-5">Hitchins, 204<U+2013>5.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 51-2">Pavlowitch, Chapter 3, pp. 51<U+2013>2.</ref><ref name = "Hitchins 204">Detailed membership of the Assembly in Wallachia: the [[Metropolitan of Hungro-Wallachia|Metropolitan bishop]] was president, and all other [[bishop]]s were members, together with 20 high-ranking boyars and 18 other boyars (Hitchins, p. 204).</ref> In effect, the ''Regulament'' confirmed earlier steps leading to the eventual [[separation of church and state]], and, although [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] church authorities were confirmed a privileged position and a political say, the religious institution was closely supervised by the government (with the establishment of a quasi-[[salary expense]]).<ref name = "Hitchins 207">Hitchins, p. 207.</ref>

A [[tax reform|fiscal reform]] ensued, with the creation of a [[poll tax]] (calculated per family), the elimination of most [[indirect tax]]es, annual [[state budget]]s (approved by the Assemblies) and the introduction of a [[civil list]] in place of the ''hospodars''' personal treasuries.<ref>Hitchins, pp. 206<U+2013>7</ref> New methods of [[bookkeeping]] were regulated, and the creation of [[national bank]]s was projected, but, like the adoption of national [[fixed currency|fixed currencies]], was never implemented.<ref name = "Hitchins 207" />

According to the historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], "The [boyar] [[oligarchy]] was appeased [by the ''Regulament'''s adoption]: a beautifully harmonious modern form had veiled the old [[Romania in the Middle Ages|medieval]] structure<U+2026>. The ''[[bourgeoisie]]''<U+2026> held no influence. As for the peasant, he lacked even the right to administer his own [[commune in Romania|commune]], he was not even allowed to vote for an Assembly deemed, as if in jest, <U+00AB>national<U+00BB>."<ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /> Nevertheless, conservative boyars remained suspicious of Russian tutelage, and several expressed their fear that the regime was a step leading to the creation of a regional ''[[guberniya]]'' for the Russian Empire.<ref>Djuvara, pp. 324<U+2013>6</ref> Their mistrust was, in time, reciprocated by Russia, who relied on ''hospodars'' and the direct intervention of its consuls to push further reforms.<ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52">Pavlowitch, Chapter 3, p. 52.</ref> Kiselyov himself voiced a plan for the region's [[annexation]] to Russia, but the request was dismissed by his superiors.<ref>Hitchins, pp. 208<U+2013>9.</ref>

==Economic trends==
===Cities and towns===
[[Image:AKauffmannJReyIasiFair.PNG|thumb|200px|A cosmopolitan fair in [[Ia<U+015F>i]] (ca.1845)]]
Beginning with the reformist administration of Kiselyov, the two countries experienced a series of profound changes, political, social, as well as cultural.

Despite under-representation in politics, the [[middle class]] swelled in numbers, profiting from a growth in trade which had increased the status of merchants. Under continuous competition from the ''[[sudi<U+0163>i]]'', traditional guilds (''bresle'' or ''isnafuri'') faded away, leading to a more competitive, purely [[capitalism|capitalist]] environment.<ref>Djuvara, pp. 187, 189.</ref><ref name = "Giurescu 127 288">Giurescu, pp. 127, 288.</ref> This nevertheless signified that, although the traditional [[Greeks in Romania|Greek]] competition for [[Romanians|Romanian]] merchants and artisans had become less relevant, locals continued to face one from Austrian subjects of various nationalities, as well as from a sizeable [[History of the Jews in Romania|immigration of Jews]] from the [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] and Russia &mdash; prevented from settling in the countryside, Jews usually became keepers of [[inn]]s and [[tavern]]s, and later both bankers and [[leasehold estate|leaseholders of estates]].<ref>Djuvara, pp. 180<U+2013>2.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 53">Pavlowitch, Chapter 3, p. 53.</ref> In this context, an anti-[[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Catholic]] sentiment was growing, based, according to [[Keith Hitchins]], on the assumption that Catholicism and Austrian influence were closely related, as well as on a widespread preference for [[secularism]].<ref>Hitchins, p. 174.</ref>

[[Image:Bucuresti punte 1837.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A bridge in [[Bucharest]] (1837)]]
The Romanian middle class formed the basis for what was to become the [[Liberalism in Romania|liberal electorate]], and accounted for the [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] discourse of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] during the latter's first decade of existence (between 1875 and [[World War I]]).<ref>Djuvara, p. 138.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch9 185-7">Pavlowitch, Chapter 9, pp. 185<U+2013>7</ref>

Urban development occurred at a very fast pace: overall, the urban population had doubled by 1850.<ref>Hitchins, p. 215.</ref> [[Bucharest]], the capital of Wallachia, expanded from about 70,000 in 1831 to about 120,000 in 1859; [[Ia<U+015F>i]], the capital of Moldavia, followed at around half that number.<ref>Djuvara, p. 176.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch 3 53">Pavlowitch chapter 3, p. 53.</ref> [[Br<U+0103>ila]] and [[Giurgiu]], Danube ports returned to Wallachia by the Ottomans, as well as Moldavia's [[Gala<U+0163>i]], grew from the grain trade to become prosperous cities.<ref name = "Djuvara 323" /><ref name = "Giurescu 122 127">Giurescu, pp. 122, 127.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 53" /> Kiselyov, who had centered his administration on Bucharest, paid full attention to its development, improving its infrastructure and services and awarding it, together with all other cities and towns, a local administration (''see [[History of Bucharest]]'').<ref>Giurescu, pp. 123<U+2013>7.</ref> [[Public works]] were carried out in the urban sphere, as well as in the massive expansion of the transport and communications system.<ref name = "Djuvara 328">Djuvara, p. 328.</ref>

===Countryside===
[[Image:Giurgiu1837.jpg|thumb|200px|A peasant fair in the [[Wallachia]]n city of [[Giurgiu]] (1837)]]
The success of the grain trade was secured by a conservative take on property, which restricted the right of peasants to exploit for their own gain those plots of land they leased on boyar [[estate (land)|estates]] (the ''Regulament'' allowed them to consume around 70% of the total harvest per plot leased, while boyars were allowed to use a third of their estate as they pleased, without any legal duty toward the neighbouring peasant workforce);<ref>Djuvara, p. 326.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 53" /> at the same time, small properties, created after [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]] had abolished [[serfdom]] in the 1740s, proved less lucrative in the face of competition by large estates &mdash; boyars profited from the consequences, as more landowning peasants had to resort to leasing plots while still owing ''[[corv<U+00E9>e]]s'' to their lords.<ref>Djuvara, pp. 259<U+2013>61.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 53" /> Confirmed by the ''Regulament'' at up to 12 days a year,<ref>Djuvara, pp. 259, 260.</ref> the ''corv<U+00E9>e'' was still less significant than in other parts of Europe; however, since peasants relied on cattle for alternative food supplies and financial resources, and [[pasture]]s remained the exclusive property of boyars, they had to exchange right of use for more days of work in the respective boyar's benefit (as much as to equate the corresponding ''corv<U+00E9>e'' requirements in [[Central Europe]]an countries, without ever being enforced by laws).<ref name = "Djuvara 327">Djuvara, p. 327.</ref> Several laws of the period display a particular concern in limiting the right of peasants to evade ''corv<U+00E9>es'' by paying their equivalent in currency, thus granting the boyars a workforce to match a steady growth in grain demands on foreign markets.<ref>Hitchins, p. 226.</ref> 

In respect to pasture access, the ''Regulament'' divided peasants into three wealth-based categories: ''frunta<U+015F>i'' ("foremost people"), who, by definition, owned 4 [[working animal]]s and one or more cows (allowed to use ca.4 [[hectare]]s of pasture); ''mijloca<U+015F>i'' ("middle people") &mdash; two working animals and one cow (ca.2 hectares); ''coda<U+015F>i'' ("backward people") &mdash; people who owned no property, and not allowed the use of pastures.<ref>Djuvara, pp. 326<U+2013>7.</ref>

At the same time, the major [[demography|demographic]] changes took their toll on the countryside. For the very first time, food supplies were no longer abundant in front of a [[population growth]] ensured by, among other causes, the effective measures taken against epidemics; rural-urban migration became a noticeable phenomenon, as did the relative increase in [[urbanization]] of traditional rural areas, with an explosion of settlements around established [[fair]]s.<ref>Hitchins, pp. 215<U+2013>6.</ref>

[[Image:Nicolae Grigorescu 019.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Nicolae Grigorescu]]'s ''Countryside courtyard'', depicting a typical peasant lodging in the 19th century]]
These processes also ensured that [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]] was minimal (although [[factory|factories]] had first been opened during the [[Phanariotes]]): most revenues came from a highly productive agriculture based on peasant labour, and were invested back into agricultural production.<ref name = "Djuvara 327" /><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 53" />  In parallel, hostility between agricultural workers and landowners mounted: after an increase in [[lawsuit]]s involving leaseholders and the decrease in quality of ''corv<U+00E9>e'' outputs, resistance, hardened by the examples of [[Tudor Vladimirescu]] and various ''[[hajduk]]s'', turned to [[sabotage]] and occasional violence.<ref>Djuvara, pp. 262<U+2013>3, 329.</ref> A more serious incident occurred in 1831, when around 60,000 peasants protested against projected [[conscription]] criteria; Russian troops dispatched to quell the revolt killed around 300 people.<ref name = "Djuvara 328" />

==Political and cultural setting==
The most noted cultural development under the ''Regulament'' was Romanian [[Romantic nationalism]], in close connection with [[Francophile|Francophilia]]. [[Modernization|Institutional modernization]] engered a renaissance of the [[intelligentsia]]. In turn, the concept of "[[nation]]" was first expanded beyond its coverage of the boyar category,<ref>Berindei, p. 9.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 54">Pavlowitch, Chapter 3, p. 54.</ref> and more members of the privileged displayed a concern in solving problems facing the peasantry: although rarer among the high-ranking boyars, the interest was shared by most [[progressivism|progressive]] political figures by the 1840s.<ref>Berindei, pp. 9, 10.</ref><ref name = "Djuvara 331">Djuvara, p. 331.</ref>
[[Image:Wallachian infantery marching, 1837.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Wallachian military forces|Wallachian militia]] maneuvering in 1837]]

Nationalist themes now included a preoccupation for the [[Origin of the Romanians|Latin origin of Romanians]]<ref>Hitchins, pp. 175, 176<U+2013>7.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 53" /> and the common (but since discarded) reference to the entire region as ''[[Dacia]]'' (first notable in the title of [[Mihail Kog<U+0103>lniceanu]]'s ''[[Dacia Literar<U+0103>]]'', a short-lived Romantic [[literary magazine]] published in 1840).  As a trans-border notion, ''Dacia'' also indicated a growth in Pan-Romanian sentiment &mdash; the latter had first been present in several boyar requests of the late 18th century, which had called for the union of the two [[Danubian Principalities]] under the protection of European powers (and, in some cases, under the rule of a foreign prince).<ref name = "Berindei 8">Berindei, p. 8.</ref> To these was added the circulation of fake documents which were supposed to reflect the text of ''[[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|Capitulations]]'' awarded by the [[Ottoman Empire]] to its Wallachian and Moldavian [[vassal]]s in the [[Romania in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], claiming to stand out as proof of rights and privileges which had been long neglected (''see also [[Islam in Romania]]'').<ref name = "Berindei 8" /><ref name = "Hitchins 192-3">Hitchins, pp. 192<U+2013>3.</ref>

[[Education in Romania|Education]], still accessible only to the wealthy, was first removed from the domination of the [[Greek language]] and [[Ancient Greece|Hellenism]] upon the disestablishment of Phanariotes sometime after 1821; the attempts of [[Gheorghe Laz<U+0103>r]] (at the [[Saint Sava College]]) and [[Gheorghe Asachi]] to engender a transition towards [[Romanian language|Romanian-language]] teaching had been only moderately successful, but Wallachia became the scene of such a movement after the start of [[Ion Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu]]'s teaching career and the first issue of his newspaper, ''[[Curierul Rom<U+00E2>nesc]]''.<ref>Djuvara, pp. 215, 352.</ref><ref name = "Giurescu 125">Giurescu, p. 125.</ref><ref name = "Hitchins 235-6">Hitchins, pp. 235<U+2013>6.</ref><ref name = "Iorga Roumains" />  Moldavia soon followed, after Asachi began printing his highly influential magazine ''[[Albina Rom<U+00E2>neasc<U+0103>]]''.<ref name = "Hitchins 244">Hitchins, p. 244.</ref><ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /> The ''Regulament'' brought about the creation of new schools, which were dominated by the figures of [[Transylvania]]n Romanians who had taken exile after expressing their dissatifaction with [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule in their homeland &mdash; these teachers, who usually rejected the adoption of French cultural models in the otherwise [[conservatism|conservative]] society (viewing the process as an unnatural one), counted among them [[Ioan Maiorescu]] and [[August Treboniu Laurian]].<ref name = "Iorga Roumains" />
Another impetus for nationalism was the Russian-supervised creation of small [[standing army|standing armies]] (occasionally referred to as "[[militia]]s"; ''see [[Moldavian military forces]] and [[Wallachian military forces]]''). The Wallachian one first maneuvered in the autumn of 1831, and was supervised by Kiselyov himself.<ref>Giurescu, p. 124.</ref>  According to [[Ion Ghica]], the prestige of military careers had a relevant tradition: "Only the arrival of the Muscovites [sic] in 1828 ended [the] young boyars' sons flighty way of life, as it made use of them as commissioners (''mehmendari'') in the service of Russian generals, in order to assist in providing the troops with [supplies]. In 1831 most of them took to the sword, signing up for the national militia."<ref>Ghica, ''Din vremea lui Caragea''.</ref>

The [[Westernization]] of Romanian society took place at a rapid pace, and created a noticeable, albeit not omnipresent, [[generation gap]].<ref>Berindei, pp. 9<U+2013>10.</ref><ref name = "Giurescu 125-6">Giurescu, pp. 125<U+2013>6.</ref><ref name = "Iorga" /><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 54">Pavlowitch, chapter 3, p. 54.</ref> The paramount cultural model was the French one, following a pattern already established by contacts between the region and the [[French Consulate]] and [[First French Empire|First Empire]] (attested, among others, by the existence of a Wallachian plan to [[petition]] [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], whom locals believed to be a descendant of the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperors]], with a complaint against the Phanariotes,<ref>Berindei, pp. 8<U+2013>9.</ref><ref name = "Ghica B<U+0103>lt<U+0103>re<U+0163>u">Ghica, ''B<U+0103>lt<U+0103>re<U+0163>u''.</ref> as well as by an actual anonymous petition sent in 1807 from Moldavia).<ref>Hitchins, p. 175.</ref> This trend was consolidated by the French cultural model partly adopted by the Russians,<ref>Giurescu, p. 126.</ref> a growing mutual sympathy between the Principalities and France, increasingly obvious under the French [[July Monarchy]],<ref name = "Iorga" /> and, as early as the 1820s, the enrolment of young boyars in [[Paris]]ian educational institutions (coupled with the 1830 opening of a French-language school in Bucharest, headed by [[Jean Alexandre Vaillant]]).<ref>Djuvara, p. 211.</ref><ref name = "Iorga" /><ref name = "Russo IV">Russo, IV.</ref><ref name = "Hitchins 213">The refoundation of the [[Saint Sava College]] as a French-language school under [[Gheorghe Bibescu]] was, nevertheless, viewed with hostility by [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] political figures, who were by then stronger supporters of [[Romantic nationalism]] and, as such, of teaching in Romanian (Hitchins, p.213)</ref> The young generation eventually attempted to curb French borrowings, which it had come to see as endangering its nationalist aspirations.<ref>Hitchins, pp. 240<U+2013>1.</ref>

==Statutory rules and nationalist opposition==
{{seealso|1848 Moldavian revolution|1848 Wallachian revolution}}

[[Image:Proclama<U+0163>ia de la Islaz (1848).jpg|thumb|200px|left|The ''[[Islaz Proclamation]]'']]
In 1834, despite the founding documents' requirements, Russia and the Ottoman Empire agreed to appoint the first two ''[[hospodar]]s'' (instead of providing for their election), as a means to ensure both the monarchs' support for a moderate pace in reforms and their allegiance in front of conservative boyar opposition.<ref name="Djuvara, p. 325.">Djuvara, p. 325.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52"/>  The choices were [[Alexandru II Ghica]] (the stepbrother of the previous monarch, [[Grigore IV Ghica|Grigore IV]]) as [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince of Wallachia]] and [[Mihail Sturdza]] (a distant cousin of [[Ioan Sturdza|Ioni<U+0163><U+0103> Sandu]]) as [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince of Moldavia]]. The two rules (generally referred to as ''Domnii regulamentare'' &mdash; "statutory" or "regulated reigns"), closely observed by the Russian [[consul (representative)|consuls]] and various Russian technical advisors, soon met a vocal and unified opposition in the Assemblies and elsewhere.<ref>Djuvara, pp. 324, 329.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52" />

Immediately after the confirmation of the ''Regulament'', Russia had begun demanding that the two local Assemblies each vote an ''Additional Article'' (''Articol adi<U+0163>ional'') &mdash; one preventing any modification of the texts without the common approval of the courts in Istanbul and Saint Petersburg.<ref name = "Djuvara 329">Djuvara, p. 329.</ref><ref name = "Hitchins 210">Hitchins, p. 210.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52" /> In Wallachia, the issue turned into scandal after the pressure for adoption mounted in 1834, and led to a four-year long standstill, during which a nationalist group in the legislative body began working on its own project for a constitution, proclaiming the Russian [[protectorate]] and Ottoman [[suzerainty]] to be over, and [[self-determination]] with guarantees from all European Powers of the time.<ref name = "Djuvara  329" /><ref name = "Hitchins 210-1">Hitchins, pp. 210<U+2013>1.</ref>  The [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] leader of the movement, [[Ion C<U+00E2>mpineanu]], maintained close contacts with [[Poles|Polish]] nobleman [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]]'s [[Union of National Unity]] (as well as with other European nationalists Romantics);<ref name = "Djuvara 329" /><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52" /> after the ''Additional Article'' passed due to Ghica's interference and despite boyar protests, C<U+00E2>mpineanu was forced to abandon his seat and take refuge in Central Europe (until being arrested and sent back by the Austrians to be imprisoned in Bucharest).<ref name = "Djuvara 329" /> From that point on, opposition to Ghica's rule took the form of [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and ''[[carbonari]]''-inspired [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracies]], formed around young politicians such as [[Mitic<U+0103> Filipescu]], [[Nicolae B<U+0103>lcescu]], [[Eftimie Murgu]], [[Ion Ghica]], [[Christian Tell]], [[Dimitrie Macedonski]], and [[Cezar Bolliac]] (all of whom held C<U+00E2>mpineanu's ideology in esteem)<ref>Berindei, p. 10.</ref> <U+2014> in 1840, Filipescu and most of his group (who had tried in vain to profit from the Ottoman crisis engendered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]'s rebellion)<ref>Hitchins, p. 211.</ref> were placed under arrest and imprisoned in various locations.<ref>Djuvara, p. 330.</ref><ref name = "Giurescu 132-3">Giurescu, pp. 132<U+2013>3.</ref>

[[Image:Arderea Regulamentului Organic <U+015F>i a Arhondologiei.jpg|thumb|200px|The burning of the Wallachian ''Regulament'' and of the register of [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|boyar ranks]] during the [[1848 Wallachian revolution|1848 revolution]]]]
Noted abuses against the [[rule of law]] and the consequent threat of rebellion made the Ottoman Empire and Russia withdraw their support for Ghica in 1842,<ref name="Djuvara, p. 325."/><ref name = "Hitchins 212">Hitchins, p. 212.</ref><ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52" /> and his successor, [[Gheorghe Bibescu]], reigned as the first and only prince to have been elected by any one of the two Assemblies. In Moldavia, the situation was less tense, as Sturdza was able to calm down and manipulate opposition to Russian rule while introducing further reforms.<ref name="Djuvara, p. 325."/><ref name = "Hitchins 213-5">Hitchins, 213<U+2013>5.</ref><ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52" />
 
In 1848, upon the outbreak of the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions]], [[Liberalism in Romania|liberalism]] consolidated itself into more overt opposition, helped along by contacts between Romanian students with the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|French movement]].<ref name = "Iorga Roumains" />  Nevertheless, the [[1848 Moldavian revolution|Moldavian revolution]] of late March 1848 was an abortive one, and led to the return of Russian troops on its soil.<ref name = "Djuvara 331">Djuvara, p. 331.</ref><ref name = "Hitchins, pp. 292-4">Hitchins, pp. 292<U+2013>4.</ref> [[1848 Wallachian revolution|Wallachia's revolt]] was successful: after the ''[[Proclamation of Islaz]]'' on June 21 sketched a new legal framework and [[land reform]] with an end to all ''[[corv<U+00E9>e]]s'' (a program acclaimed by the crowds), the conspirators managed to topple Bibescu, who had by then dissolved the Assembly,<ref name = "Hitchins 212" /> without notable violence, and established a Provisoral Government in Bucharest.<ref>Djuvara, pp. 330<U+2013>1.</ref><ref name = "Giurescu 133-5">Giurescu, pp. 133<U+2013>5.</ref><ref name = "Hitchins 294-307">Hitchins, pp. 294<U+2013>307.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 55">Pavlowitch, Chapter 3, p. 55.</ref> 

The new executive, orchestrating the public burning of the ''Regulament'' in September, attempted to play Ottoman interests against Russian ones, trying to obtain backing from the [[Porte]]; the relative initial success was rendered void after Russian diplomats pressured [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Abd-ul-Mejid]] to intervene in their place (and thus not risk losing yet more control over the region to a more determined Russian expedition).<ref name = "Djuvara 331" /><ref name = "Giurescu 135-6">Giurescu, pp. 135<U+2013>6.</ref><ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 55" /> A Russian occupation over Wallachia soon joined the Ottoman one (begun on September 18), and both lasted until April 1851; in 1849, the two powers signed the [[Treaty of Balta Liman]], which asserted the right of the Porte to nominate ''hospodars'' for seven-year terms.<ref>Giurescu, pp. 139<U+2013>40.</ref><ref name = "Hitchins 335-6">Hitchins, pp. 335<U+2013>6.</ref><ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 55" />

==Crimean War==
{{main|Crimean War}}
[[Image:Cahul Ismail si Bolgrad.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Russian-Moldavian border in 1856-1857]]
The [[Crimean War]] again brought the two countries under Russian military administration, inaugurated in 1853. The ''hospodars'' of the period, [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]] in Moldavia and [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Barbu Dimitrie <U+015E>tirbei]] in Wallachia, were removed from their thrones, and the region was governed by the Russian general [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Budberg]].

As the [[Balkans]] remained a secondary theatre of war, the two Principalities were taken over by a neutral Austrian administration in September 1854 &mdash; part of a settlement between the Porte and Russia (the Austrians remained until 1857).<ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 56">Pavlowitch, Chapter 3, p.56</ref> Grigore Ghica and <U+015E>tirbei were returned to the thrones in the same year, and completed the last series of reforms carried under the terms of the ''Regulament''. The most far-reaching among these were the ones concerning [[Slavery in Romania|Roma slavery]]. In Moldavia, Romas were liberated, without a period of transition, on December 22, 1855; the change was more gradual in Wallachia, where measures to curb trade had been taken earlier, and where the decision to ban the ownership of slaves was taken by <U+015E>tirbei on February 20, 1856.<ref>Djuvara, pp. 276<U+2013>8.</ref> Concerned by worsening boyar-peasant relations, <U+015E>tirbei, who governed without an Assembly (and had instead appointed his own ''Divan''), enacted measures to improve the situation in the countryside, and ultimately enforced [[employment|contract-based]] work as the rule on estates (wherby peasants who were not indebted after five years in service could leave the land they were working on).<ref>Hitchins, pp. 337<U+2013>8.</ref>

[[Image:Austrian troops, 25 August-6 September 1854, Lanzedelli.jpg|thumb|200px|Austrian troops in [[Bucharest]], 1854]]
This was the moment when the call for union of the two Principalities began to be voiced with confidence, and the two monarchs showed more or less approval for the designs of the unionist ''[[Partida Na<U+0163>ional<U+0103>]]'' (created by 1848 revolutionaries who had returned from exile). 

The war was ended by the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] (March 30, 1856), which placed the countries, still as Ottoman vassals, under the protectorate of all European Powers (the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], Austria, and, never again completely, Russia).  The protector states had to decide on a compromise formula for the projected union; the Ottomans demanded and obtained, in contradiction with the ''Regulament'', the removal of both ''hospodars'' from their thrones, pending elections for the [[ad hoc Divans]].<ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 56" />  The outcome remained disputed until the election of [[Alexander John Cuza]], who reigned as first ''[[Domnitor]]'' of the ''United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia'', the basis of modern [[Romania]].
