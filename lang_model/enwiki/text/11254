The first of which was a 50-yard return in week 10 to help the Packers to a 20<U+2013>10 victory over the [[Detroit Lions]].

During his second season he started all 16 games for the Packers, finishing with 73 tackles. In 1999 he started all 16 games for the second consecutive season finishing with a career high 113 tackles and three interceptions.

Sharper's breakout season was in 2000. He finished the season with 92 tackles and a league leading nine interceptions, and made his first career [[Pro Bowl]]. Sharper had another great season in 2001 finishing with 94 tackles and six interceptions. 

In 2002 Sharper made his second Pro Bowl after intercepting seven passes for a league high 233 interception yards in only 13 games. In 2003 he finished with 82 tackles and five interceptions. During his last season with the Packers in 2004 he totaled 70 tackles and four interceptions and led the league in defensive touchdowns with two.

On March 10, 2005 the Packers released Sharper. He finished his eight-year career in Green Bay, fifth in Packer history with 36 career interceptions, 616 tackles, six [[Quarterback sack|sacks]], 677 interception yards, and five [[touchdowns]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060117183626/http://www.packers.com/news/releases/2005/03/10/3/ Packers Release Darren Sharper, Sparky Hamilton]. Packers.com. 03/10/2005</ref>

===Minnesota Vikings===
Sharper signed with the [[Minnesota Vikings]] on March 12, 2005.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=2011382 Sharper stays in NFC North]. Sports.espn.go.com (2005-03-12). Retrieved on 2011-11-17.</ref> Sharper made an immediate impact for the Vikings intercepting nine passes for a league high 276 interception yards and two defensive touchdowns, in only 14 games. His great play earned him a trip to his third Pro Bowl. During his second season with the Vikings in 2006 he made 67 tackles and four interceptions. On November 11, 2006 in a game against the [[Miami Dolphins]], Sharper bumped a member of the [[American football official|officiating]] crew, but he was not immediately penalized, later the following week the NFL fined him $15,000 for the infraction.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2674540 Vikings safety Sharper fined $15K for bumping referee]. Sports.espn.go.com (2006-11-24). Retrieved on 2011-11-17.</ref>

Sharper made the Pro Bowl for the fourth time in 2007, after totaling 63 tackles and four interceptions. On September 16, 2007, Sharper became the 22nd player in NFL history to intercept 50 passes.<ref>[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/def_int_career.htm Career Interception List]. Pro-football-reference.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-17.</ref> In 2008 Sharper recorded 69 tackles and one interception.

He finished his four-year career in Minnesota with 18 interceptions, 250 tackles, 359 interception yards, three touchdowns, and a sack.

===New Orleans Saints===
====2009 season====
An [[unrestricted free agent]] after the 2008 season, Sharper signed a one year deal with the [[New Orleans Saints]] on March 18, 2009.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nfl&id=3994486 Saints Agree to Terms with Sharper]. Associated Press. March 18, 2009</ref>

On October 4, 2009, Sharper returned an interception 99 yards for a touchdown, the longest in Saints history. It was also his second 95+ yard interception return for a touchdown for the season.  On October 25, Sharper returned his third interception for a touchdown on the season, a team record. At the end of Week 8, on Monday Night Football, Sharper intercepted a pass from Atlanta's [[Matt Ryan]] to help keep the Saints' perfect record.  It was his seventh interception of the season.  On November 30, once again on Monday Night Football, Sharper intercepted a desperation pass from New England's [[Tom Brady]] and returned it 35 yards, which would have left him 4 yards short of the NFL record for interception return yards in a season, set by [[Ed Reed]] of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in 2004, but the interception was called back due to a penalty. 

Sharper then broke that record in a December 27 game against [[Tampa Bay]], intercepting [[Josh Freeman]]'s pass and returning it 21 yards.  This gave him 9 interceptions on the year and 376 return yards (including 3 interceptions returned for touchdowns).  It was the 63rd interception of Sharper's NFL career, tying him for sixth on the all-time list.<ref>Mike Triplett, [http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2009/12/post_113.html "Sharper makes history"], ''[[Times-Picayune]]'', December 27, 2009.</ref>  His 376 interception return yards broke the NFL single season record of 358 previously held by [[Ed Reed]].  Sharper also shares an [[NFL]] record with [[Deion Sanders]] for most games with 50+ interception return yards (9) and owns the NFL record for most games with 75+ interception return yards (6).

For his performance in 2009, Sharper was selected for his fifth Pro Bowl and as a first team All-Pro. On February 7, 2010, Sharper earned his first [[Super Bowl ring]] as the Saints defeated the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in [[Super Bowl XLIV]] by a score of 31<U+2013>17. Characteristically of the play of [[New Orleans]] defense all season, the game was decided when [[cornerback]] [[Tracy Porter]] intercepted a [[Peyton Manning]] pass late in the 4th quarter and returned it 74 yards for the winning touchdown.

====2010 season====
Sharper had micro-facture arthroscopic surgery on his left knee during the off-season.  On March 5, 2010, Sharper became an unrestricted free agent, allowing him to sign with another team.  However, on May 3, Sharper re-signed with the Saints for the 2010 season.<ref>Mike Triplett, [http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2010/05/darren_sharper_and_new_orleans.html "Darren Sharper and New Orleans Saints agree to a 1-year deal"], ''[[Times-Picayune]]'', May 3, 2010.</ref>  On September 3, Sharper was placed on the PUP ([[Physically Unable to Perform]]) list, causing him to miss the first six weeks of the 2010 NFL season.  He was activated on October 24,<ref>Brian Allee-Walsh, [http://www.neworleans.com/sports/sports-blogs/brian-allee-walshs-blog/521981-saints-safety-darren-sharper-to-rejoin-roster-be-active-for-browns-game.html "Saints safety Darren Sharper to rejoin roster, be active for Browns game"], neworleans.com, October 23, 2010.</ref> but he later missed another two games after a further injury. He was selected as a second team All Pro, despite having missed much of the season.

====Retirement====
After workouts with the [[Denver Broncos]], [[New England Patriots]], and [[Green Bay Packers]] without a contract offer, Sharper reportedly announced his retirement after a 14 year career.  He finished with 63 career regular season interceptions, placing him sixth all time.  He took 11 of them back for touchdowns, which ranks him second only to Hall of Famer Rod Woodson & Charles Woodson, with 12.<ref>http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7292298/source-darren-sharper-formerly-new-orleans-saints-set-retire</ref>

====Life after football====
After retiring, Sharper did some work for both ESPN and NFL Network as an analyst. He'll join [[WWL-TV]] in New Orleans as an analyst for the [[New Orleans Saints]] beginning in August.
