'''''Banksia sessilis''''', commonly known as '''Parrot Bush''', is a [[species]] of [[shrub]] or [[tree]] in the [[plant]] [[genus]] ''[[Banksia]]'' in the [[Proteaceae]] family. It had been known as '''''Dryandra sessilis''''' until 2007, when the genus ''[[Dryandra]]'' was sunk into ''Banksia''. Widespread throughout [[southwest Australia|southwest]] [[Western Australia]], it is found on sandy soils over [[laterite]] or [[limestone]], often as an [[understory|understorey]] plant in open forest, woodland or shrubland. Encountered as a shrub or small tree up to 6&nbsp;m (20&nbsp;ft) in height, it has prickly dark green leaves and dome-shaped cream-yellow [[Head (botany)|flowerheads]]. Flowering from winter through to late spring, it provides a key source of food<U+2014>both the nectar and the insects it attracts<U+2014>for [[honeyeater]]s in the cooler months, and [[Biodiversity|species diversity]] is reduced in areas where there is little or no parrot bush occurring. Several species of honeyeater, some species of native bee, and the [[European Honey Bee]] seek out and consume the nectar, while the [[Long-billed Black Cockatoo]] and [[Australian Ringneck]] eat the seed. The life cycle of ''Banksia sessilis'' is adapted to regular bushfires. Killed by fire and regenerating by seed afterwards, each shrub generally produces many flowerheads and a massive amount of seed. It can recolonise disturbed areas, and may grow in thickets. 

''Banksia sessilis'' has a somewhat complicated [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] history. It was collected from [[King George Sound]] in 1801 and described by [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] in 1810 as ''Dryandra floribunda'', a name by which it was known for many years. However, [[Joseph Knight (gardener)|Joseph Knight]] had published the name ''Josephia sessilis'' in 1809, which had precedence due to its earlier date, and the specific name was formalised in 1924. Four [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] are recognised. It is a prickly plant with little apparent [[Horticulture|horticultural]] potential, and none of the varieties are commonly seen in cultivation. A profuse producer of nectar, ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' is valuable to the [[beekeeping]] industry.

''Banksia sessilis'' grows as an upright shrub or small tree up to 6&nbsp;m (20&nbsp;ft) high, without a [[lignotuber]]. In most varieties, new stems are covered in soft, fine hairs that are lost with maturity; but new stems of [[Banksia sessilis var. flabellifolia|''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' var. ''flabellifolia'']] are usually hairless. Leaves are blue-green or dark green. Their shape differs by variety: in [[Banksia sessilis var. cygnorum|var. ''cygnorum'']] and var. ''flabellifolia'' they are wedge-shaped, with teeth only near the apex; in [[Banksia sessilis var. cordata|var. ''cordata'']] they are wedge-shaped, but with teeth along the entire margin; and in [[Banksia sessilis var. sessilis|var. ''sessilis'']] they are somewhat broader at the base, sometimes almost oblong in shape. Leaf size ranges from 2 to 6&nbsp;cm (1<U+2013>2.5&nbsp;in) in length, and 0.8<U+2013>4&nbsp;cm (0.3<U+2013>1.6&nbsp;in) in width. They may be sessile (that is, growing directly from the stem without a [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]) or on a petiole up to 0.5&nbsp;cm (0.2&nbsp;in) long.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p203">{{Cite book | first = Tony | last = Cavanagh | first2 = Margaret |last2 = Pieroni | year = 2006 | chapter = ''Dryandra sessilis'' (Knight) Domin (1923) | pages = 203<U+2013>07 | title = The Dryandras | publisher = Melbourne: Australian Plants Society (SGAP Victoria); Perth: Wildflower Society of Western Australia | isbn = 1-876473-54-1}}</ref><ref name="FoA 3529">{{Flora of Australia Online | name = ''Dryandra sessilis'' (Knight) Domin | id = 3529}}</ref>

The [[inflorescence]]s are cream or yellow, and occur in domed [[Head (botany)|heads]] 4 to 5&nbsp;cm (1<U+00BD><U+2013>2 in) wide, situated at the end of a stem. Each head contains from 55 to 125 individual flowers, surrounded at the base by a whorl of short [[involucral bract]]s. As with most other [[Proteaceae]], individual flowers consist of a tubular [[perianth]] made up of four united [[tepal]]s, and one long wiry [[carpel|style]]. The style end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at [[anthesis]]. In ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' the perianth is straight, 20 to 32&nbsp;mm (0.8<U+2013>1.3&nbsp;in) long, and pale yellow. The style is slightly shorter, also straight, and cream-coloured. Thus in ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'', unlike many other ''Banksia'' species, the release of the style at anthesis does not result in a showy flower colour change.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p203"/><ref name="FoA 3529"/>

Flowering mostly takes place from July to November, although var. ''sessilis'' can start as early as May. After flowering, the flower parts wither and fall away, and up to four follicles develop in the receptable (the base of the flower head). Young follicles are covered in a fine fur, but this is lost as they mature. Mature follicles are [[ovoid]] in shape, and measure 1<U+2013>1.5&nbsp;cm (0.4<U+2013>0.6&nbsp;in) in length. Most follicles open as soon as they are ripe, revealing their contents: a woody [[seed separator]] and up to two winged seeds.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p203"/><ref name="FoA 3529"/>

==Discovery and naming==
[[File:Banksia sessilis (Bauer) cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Ferdinand Bauer's painting of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'', based on drawings made by him at King George Sound in December 1801|alt=Old painting of segment of plant with leaves and blooms on white background with several anatomical cross sections of flower parts beneath]]
Specimens of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' were first collected by Scottish surgeon [[Archibald Menzies]] during the visit of the [[Vancouver Expedition]] to [[King George Sound]] in September and October 1791. No firm location or collection date can be ascribed to Menzies' specimens, as their labels simply read "New Holland, King Georges Sound, Mr. Arch. Menzies",<ref name="George 1996">{{cite journal | first = Alex | last = George | year = 1996 | title = New taxa and a new infrageneric classification in ''Dryandra'' R.Br.

Menzies' seed specimens were sent to [[England]] from [[Sydney]] in 1793, but his plant material remained with him for the duration of the voyage, during which some material was lost. On his return to England in 1795, the surviving specimens were deposited into the [[herbarium]] of [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]], where they lay undescribed for many years.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p5"/>

The next collection was made in December 1801, when King George Sound was visited by [[HMS Investigator (1798)|HMS ''Investigator'']] under the command of [[Matthew Flinders]]. On board were [[botanist]] [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]], [[botanical artist]] [[Ferdinand Bauer]], and gardener [[Peter Good]]. All three men gathered material for Brown's specimen collection,<ref name="Hopper 2003"/> including specimens of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'',<ref name="FloraBase 1 3418 4">{{cite web | title = ''Dryandra sessilis'' (Knight) Domin. | work = Robert Brown<U+2019>s Australian Botanical Specimens, 1801<U+2013>1805 at the BM | publisher = [[FloraBase]], [[Western Australian Herbarium]] | url = http://florabase.calm.wa.gov.au/brown/search?brname=Dryandra+sessilis | accessdate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> although neither Brown's nor Good's diary can be used to assign a precise location or date for their discovery of the species.<ref name="Vallance 2001">{{cite book | first = T.

On returning to England in 1805, Brown began preparing an account of his specimens. In September 1808, with Brown's account still far from finished, Swedish botanist [[Jonas Dryander]] asked him to prepare a separate paper on the [[Proteaceae]], so that he could use the genera erected by Brown in a new edition of ''[[Hortus Kewensis]]''. Brown immediately began a study of the Proteaceae, and in January 1809 he read to the [[Linnean Society of London]] a [[monograph]] on the family entitled ''[[On the Proteaceae of Jussieu]]''. Among the eighteen new genera presented was one that Brown named ''Josephia'' in honour of Banks.<ref name="Mabberley 1985">{{cite book | first = D.

Cramer | location = Braunschweig | isbn = 3-7682-1408-7}}</ref>

Brown's paper was approved for printing in May 1809, but did not appear in print until March the following year. In the meantime, [[Joseph Knight (gardener)|Joseph Knight]] published ''[[On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae]]'', which appeared to draw heavily on Brown's unpublished material, without permission, and in most cases without attribution.<ref name="Mabberley 1985"/> It contained the first publication of Brown's ''Josephia'', for which two species were listed. The first, ''Josephia sessilis'', was based on one of Menzies' specimens: "This species, discovered by Mr. A. Menzies on the West coast of New Holland, is not unlike some varieties of ''[[Ilex aquifolium|Ilex Aquifolium]]'', and now in his Majesty's collection at Kew."<ref name="Knight 1809">{{cite book | first = Joseph | last = Knight | year = 1809 | chapter = ''Josephia'' R.Br. | pages = 110<U+2013>11 | title = On the cultivation of plants belonging to the natural order of Proteae | location = London | publisher = Savage | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=dkUAAAAAQAAJ | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}</ref> The [[etymology]] of the specific epithet was not explicitly stated, but it is universally accepted that it comes from the [[Latin]] ''sessilis'' ([[Sessility (botany)|sessile]], stalkless), in reference to the sessile leaves of this species.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p203"/> Blame for the alleged [[plagiarism]] largely fell on [[Richard Salisbury]], who had been present at Brown's readings and is thought to have provided much of the material for Knight's book. Salisbury was ostracized by the botanical community, which undertook to ignore his work as much as possible.<ref name="Mabberley 1985"/> By the time Brown's monograph appeared in print, Brown had exchanged the generic name ''Josephia'' for ''Dryandra'', giving the name ''Dryandra floribunda'' to Knight's ''Josephia sessilis''.<ref name="Brown 1810a">{{cite journal | last = Brown | first = Robert | year = 1810 | title = [[Wikisource:On the Proteaceae of Jussieu|On the Proteaceae of Jussieu]] | journal = Transactions of the Linnean Society of London | volume = 10 | pages = 15<U+2013>226 | doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.1810.tb00013.x}}</ref> As there were then no firm rules pertaining to [[priority (botany)|priority]] of publication,<ref name="Nicolson 1991">{{cite journal | first = Dan | last = Nicolson | year = 1991 | title = A history of botanical nomenclature | journal = Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden | volume = 78 | pages = 33<U+2013>56 | doi = 10.2307/2399589 | issue = 1}}</ref> Brown's name was accepted, and remained the current name for over a century.<ref name="APNI 46827">{{APNI | name = ''Dryandra floribunda'' R.Br. | id = 46827}}</ref>

Another significant early collection was the apparent discovery of the species at the [[Swan River, Western Australia|Swan River]] in 1827. In that year, the colonial botanist of [[New South Wales]] [[Charles Fraser (botanist)|Charles Fraser]] visited the area as part of an exploring expedition under [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|James Stirling]]. Among the plants that Fraser found growing on the south side of the river entrance was "a beautiful species of Dryandra",<ref name="Fraser 1830">{{cite journal | first = Charles | last = Fraser | year = 1830 | journal = [[Botanical Miscellany]] | volume = 1 | title = [[Wikisource:Remarks on the botany, &c. of the banks of Swan River, Isle of Bauche, Baie Geographe, and Cape Naturaliste|Remarks on the botany, &c. of the banks of Swan River, Isle of Bauche, Baie Geographe, and Cape Naturaliste]] | pages = 221<U+2013>36}}</ref> which was probably this species.<ref name="Seddon 2004">{{cite book | first = George | last = Seddon | year = 2004 | title = [[Sense of Place]] | edition = Facsimile | location = Melbourne | publisher = Bloomings Book | isbn = 1-876473-53-3 | chapter = The Swan in 1827 | pages = 177<U+2013>83}}</ref>

Over the course of the 19th century, the principle of priority in naming gradually came to be accepted by botanists, as did the need for a mechanism by which names in current usage could be [[conserved name|conserved]] against archaic or obscure prior names. By the 1920s, ''Dryandra'' R.Br. was effectively conserved against ''Josephia'' Knight, although a mechanism for formal conservation was not put in place until 1933. Brown's specific name, however, was not conserved, and [[Karel Domin]] overturned ''Dryandra floribunda'' R.Br. by transferring Knight's name into ''Dryandra'' as ''Dryandra sessilis'' (Knight) Domin in 1924.<ref name="APNI 47930">{{APNI | name = ''Dryandra sessilis'' (Knight) Domin | id = 47930}}</ref> This name was current until 2007, when all ''Dryandra'' species were transferred into ''[[Banksia]]'' by [[Austin Mast]] and [[Kevin Thiele]].<ref name="Mast 2007">{{cite journal | author = Mast, Austin R. and Kevin Thiele | year = 2007 | title = The transfer of ''Dryandra'' R.Br. to ''Banksia'' L.f.

===Common names===
The first common names for this species were literal translations of the scientific names. When published as ''Josephia sessilis'' in 1809, it was given the common name ''Sessile Josephia''.<ref name="Knight 1809"/> Brown did not offer a common name when he published ''Dryandra floribunda'' in 1810, but later that year the ''[[Hortus Kewensis]]'' translated it as ''Many Flowered Dryandra''.<ref name="Aiton 1810">{{cite book | first = William | last = Aiton | authorlink = William Aiton | year = 1810 | title = [[Hortus Kewensis]], Volume 1 | edition = 2nd | location = London | publisher = Longman, Hurst, Ree, Orme & Brown | page = 219}}</ref> This name was also used when the plant was featured in ''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]'' in 1813.<ref name="Sims 1813">{{cite journal | first = John | last = Sims | title = [[Wikisource:Curtis's Botanical Magazine/Volume XXXVIII/1581 Dryandra floribunda|1581.

The only indigenous names reported for the plant are ''Budjan'' and ''But-yak''. These were published by Ian Abbott in his 1983 ''Aboriginal Names for Plant Species in South-western Australia'', with Abbott suggesting that the latter name should be preferred, but with the [[orthography]] "Pudjak".<ref name="Abbott 1983">{{cite paper | first = Ian | last = Abbott | year = 1983 | title = Aboriginal names for plant species in south-western Australia | version = Technical Paper No. 5 | publisher = Forests Department of Western Australia | location = Perth}}</ref> However, Abbott sources these names to [[George Fletcher Moore]]'s 1842 ''[[A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language of the Aborigines]]'', which in fact attributes these names to the species ''Dryandra fraseri'' (now ''[[Banksia fraseri]]'').<ref name="Moore 1842">{{cite book | first = George Fletcher | last = Moore | year = 1842 | title = [[A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language of the Aborigines]] | location = London | publisher = W.

===Infrageneric placement===
Brown's 1810 monograph did not include an infrageneric classification of ''Dryandra'',<ref name="Brown 1810a"/> and neither did his ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen|Prodromus]]'', published later that year.<ref name="Brown 1810b">{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Brown (botanist) | year = 1810 | chapter = ''Dryandra'' | pages = 396<U+2013>99 | title = [[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen]] | language = Latin | location = London | publisher = Taylor}}</ref> In 1830, however, he introduced [[Brown's taxonomic arrangement of Dryandra|the first taxonomic arrangement of ''Dryandra'']], placing ''D.&nbsp;floribunda'' in section ''[[Dryandra verae]]'' along with most other species, because its [[follicle (fruit)|follicles]] contain a single seed separator.<ref name="Brown 1830">{{cite book | first = Robert | last = Brown | year = 1830 | chapter = ''Dryandra'' | pages = 37<U+2013>40 | title = [[Supplementum Primum Prodromi Florae Novae Hollandiae]] | language = Latin | publisher = Taylor | location = London}}</ref> ''Dryandra verae'' was renamed ''Eudryandra'' by [[Carl Meissner]] in 1845.<ref name="Meissner 1845">{{cite encyclopedia | first = Carl | last = Meissner | title = ''Dryandra'' R.Br. | editor = [[Johann Georg Christian Lehmann|Lehmann, J.

Bentham's arrangement stood for over a hundred years, eventually replaced in 1996 by [[George's taxonomic arrangement of Dryandra|the arrangement of]] [[Alex George]].

George's arrangement remained current until 2007, when [[Austin Mast]] and [[Kevin Thiele]] transferred ''Dryandra'' into ''Banksia''. They also published [[Banksia subg. Spathulatae|''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Spathulatae'']] for the ''Banksia'' taxa having spoon-shaped [[cotyledon]]s, thus redefining [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Banksia'']] as comprising those that do not. They were not ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing ''Dryandra'', so as an interim measure they transferred ''Dryandra'' into ''Banksia'' at [[series (botany)|series]] rank. This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' is placed in [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Banksia'']], [[Banksia ser. Dryandra|ser. ''Dryandra'']].<ref name="Mast 2007"/>

===Varieties===
[[File:Banksia sessilis var. cygnorum habit.jpg|thumb|right|Typical [[habit (biology)|habit]]: a small upright shrub|alt=A green, upright shrub in a field with yellow grass, with other green plants in the background.]]
Four [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] are recognised:
* [[Banksia sessilis var. sessilis|''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' var. ''sessilis'']] is an [[autonym (botany)|autonym]] that encompasses the type material of the species. This is the most widespread variety, occurring from [[Regans Ford, Western Australia|Regans Ford]] and [[Moora, Western Australia|Moora]] in the north, south-east to [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], and inland as far as [[Wongan Hills, Western Australia|Wongan Hills]], [[Pingelly, Western Australia|Pingelly]] and [[Kulin, Western Australia|Kulin]]. Its blue-green leaves are cuneate (wedge-shaped) or oblong, and are usually two to three centimetres long but may reach five.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p203"/>
* [[Banksia sessilis var. cordata|''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' var. ''cordata'']] was published as ''Dryandra floribunda'' var. ''cordata'' by [[Carl Meissner]] in 1848. In 1870, [[George Bentham]] published ''D.&nbsp;floribunda'' var. ''major'', but this is now considered a [[taxonomic synonym]] of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' var. ''cordata''. It has larger inflorescences than var. ''sessilis'', as well as larger dark green rather than blue green leaves. It is found in the state's far southwest, between Capes [[Cape Leeuwin|Leeuwin]] and [[Cape Naturaliste|Naturaliste]], and east to [[Walpole, Western Australia|Walpole]], and grows on sandy soils over limestone.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p203"/>
* [[Banksia sessilis var. cygnorum|''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' var. ''cygnorum'']] has its roots in [[Michel Gandoger]]'s publication of two new species names in 1919. He published ''Dryandra cygnorum'' and ''Dryandra quinquedentata'', but in 1996 both of these were found to refer to the same [[taxon]], which [[Alex George]] gave variety rank as ''Dryandra sessilis'' var. ''cygnorum''. The term ''cygnorum'' is Latin for "swan" and relates to the Swan River, which runs past the suburb of [[Melville, Western Australia|Melville]] where the type material was collected. It has smaller dark green leaves only 2<U+2013>3&nbsp;cm (0.8<U+2013>1.2&nbsp;in) long and 0.8<U+2013>1.7&nbsp;cm (0.3<U+2013>0.6&nbsp;in) wide,  whose teeth are limited to the distal part of the leaf. The range is along the Western Australian coastline from [[Dongara, Western Australia|Dongara]] southwards past [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]], and east to Lake Indoon and [[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park]].<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p203"/>
* [[Banksia sessilis var. flabellifolia|''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' var. ''flabellifolia'']] was published by George in 1996, the type specimen having been collected northwest of [[Northampton, Western Australia|Northampton]] in 1993. The northernmost of the four varieties, it is found from [[Kalbarri, Western Australia|Kalbarri]] south to [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]] and Northampton. There are some scattered records further south towards Moora. Its specific name is derived from the [[Latin]] ''flabellum'' "fan" and ''folium'' "leaf". Its leaves are fan shaped, with a long, toothless lower margin, and a toothed end. Its stems are hairless, unlike the other varieties.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p203"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Banksia sessilis map.png|thumb|right|Distribution of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'', shown on a map of Western Australia's biogeographic regions.<ref name="FloraBase">{{FloraBase | name = ''Dryandra sessilis'' (Knight) Domin | id = 1932}}</ref>|alt=A map of the biogeographic regions of Western Australia, showing the range of Banksia sessilis. It occupies the southwestern corner of Australia.]]
''Banksia sessilis'' is [[endemism|endemic]] to the [[Southwest Botanical Province]], a [[floristic province]] renowned as a [[biodiversity hotspot]], located in the southwest corner of Western Australia. This area has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with wet winters and hot, dry summers.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p21">{{Cite book | last = Cavanagh | last2 = Pieroni | year = 2006 | chapter = Chapter Two: The biology and ecology of ''Dryandra'' | pages = 21<U+2013>42}}</ref> ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' occurs throughout much of the province, ranging from Kalbarri in the north, south to [[Cape Leeuwin]], east along the south coast as far as [[Bremer Bay]], and inland to [[Wongan Hills, Western Australia|Wongan Hills]] and [[Kulin, Western Australia|Kulin]].<ref name="George 1999"/> It thus spans a wide range of climates, occurring in all but the semi-arid areas well inland. It is also absent from the [[Karri forest]] in the cool, wet, southwest corner of the province, but even there, ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' var. ''cordata'' occurs along the coast.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p203"/>

The species tolerates a range of soils, requiring only that its soil be well-drained. Like most dryandras, it grows well in [[laterite|lateritic]] soils and gravels, although this species is also found in deep sand, sand over laterite, and sand over [[limestone]]. It also occurs in a range of [[vegetation]] complexes, including coastal and [[kwongan]] [[heath (habitat)|heath]], tall [[shrubland]], [[woodland]] and open [[forest]]. It is a common [[understory|understorey]] plant in drier areas of [[Jarrah forest]],<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p203"/> and forms [[thicket]]s on limestone soils of the [[Swan Coastal Plain]].<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p21"/> ''Banksia sessilis'' sets a large amount of seed and is an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open areas;<ref name="Rockel 1982"/> for example, it has been recorded colonising [[gravel pit]]s in the [[Darling Scarp]].<ref name="Powell 1990">{{cite book | last1 = Powell | first1 = Robert | year = 1990 | title = Leaf & Branch: Trees and Tall Shrubs of Perth | publisher = Department of Conservation and Land Management | location = Perth, Western Australia|page=92 | isbn = 0-7309-3916-2}}</ref>

Nothing is known of the conditions that affect its distribution, as its [[biogeography]] is as yet unstudied. An assessment of the potential impact of [[climate change]] on this species found that its range is likely to contract by half in the face of severe change, but unlikely to change much under less severe scenarios.<ref name="Fitzpatrick 2008">{{cite journal | author = Fitzpatrick, Matthew C.; Gove, Aaron D.; Sanders, Nathan J.; Dunn, Robert R. | year = 2008 | title = Climate change, plant migration, and range collapse in a global biodiversity hotspot: the ''Banksia'' (Proteaceae) of Western Australia | journal = Global Change Biology | volume = 14 | pages = 1337<U+2013>52 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01559.x | url = http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rrdunn/Fitzpatrick-GCB-2008.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-03-03}}</ref>

==Ecology==
===As food===
The [[nectar]] of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' is an important component of the diet of a number of species of [[honeyeater]]. In one study, ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' was found to be the main source of nectar for all six species studied, namely the [[Tawny-crowned Honeyeater]] (''Gliciphila melanops''), [[White-cheeked Honeyeater]] (''Phylidonyris niger''), [[Western Spinebill]] (''Acanthorhynchus superciliosus''), [[Brown Honeyeater]] (''Lichmera indistincta''), [[Brown-headed Honeyeater]] (''Melithreptus brevirostris''), and [[Black Honeyeater]] (''Certhionyx niger''). Moreover, ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' played an important role in their distributions, with species that feed only on nectar occurring only where ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' occurs.<ref name="Halse 1978">{{cite journal | first = S. A. | last = Halse | year = 1978 | title = Feeding habits of six species of honeyeater in south-western Australia | journal = Emu | volume = 78 | issue = 3 | pages = 145<U+2013>48 | doi = 10.1071/MU9780145 | doi_brokendate = 2010-01-06 }}</ref> Other honeyeaters that have been recorded feeding on ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' include the [[Red Wattlebird]] (''Anthochaera carunculata''), [[Western Wattlebird]] (''A.&nbsp;lunulata''), and [[New Holland Honeyeater]] (''Phylidonyris novaehollandiae'').<ref name="Lepschi 1997">{{cite journal | author = Lepschi, B.

''Banksia sessilis'' is also a source of food for the [[Australian Ringneck]] (''Barnardius zonarius''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cottesloecoastcare.org/plants2.html|title=Plants to plant - 2|year=2009|work=Cottesloe Coastcare Association (Inc)|publisher=Cottesloe Coastcare Association (Inc)|accessdate=2 March 2010|location=Cottesloe, Western Australia}}</ref> and the [[Long-billed Black Cockatoo]] (''Calyptorhynchus baudinii''), which tear open the [[follicle (fruit)|follicles]] and consume the seeds.<ref name="Barker 1990">{{cite book | author = Barker, R.

The introduced [[European Honey Bee]] (''Apis mellifera'') has also been observed feeding on ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'',<ref name="Lamont 1998">{{cite journal | author = Lamont, Byron B., Olesen, Jens M. and Briffa, Peter J. | year = 1998 | title = Seed production, pollinator attractants and breeding system in relation to fire response<U+2014>Are there reproductive syndromes among co-occurring Proteaceous shrubs? | journal = Australian Journal of Botany | volume = 46 |issue = 4 | pages = 377<U+2013>85 | doi = 10.1071/BT97008}}</ref> as have seven species of [[Australian native bees|native bee]], comprising four species of ''[[Hylaeus (bee)|Hylaeus]]'' (including the [[banksia bee|Banksia Bee]] ''H. alcyoneus''), two of ''[[Leioproctus]]'', and a ''[[Lasioglossum]]''.<ref name="ANBD">{{cite web | title = Plant Pollination Index Query | url = http://pioneer.mov.vic.gov.au/cgi-bin/texhtml?form=bio_beej | work = Australian Native Bee Database | accessdate = 2008-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Houston | first = Terry, F. | title = Native Bees on Wildflowers in Western Australia | publisher = Western Australian Museum | location = Perth |date = June 2000 | page = 224 | isbn = 0-646-39816-4}}</ref>

===Life cycle===
Honeyeaters are clearly the most important [[pollination]] vector, as inflorescences from which honeyeaters are excluded generally do not set any fruit. Moreover, honeyeaters have been observed moving from tree to tree with significant loads of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' pollen on their foreheads, beaks and throats, having acquired it by brushing against [[pollen presenter]]s while foraging for nectar; experiments have shown that some of this pollen may be subsequently deposited on stigmas during later foraging.<ref name="Collins 2008">{{cite journal | author = Collins, Brian G., Walsh, Michelle and Grey, James | year = 2008 | title = Floral development and breeding systems of ''Dryandra sessilis'' and ''Grevillea wilsonii'' (Proteaceae) | journal = Australian Journal of Botany | volume = 56 |issue = 2 | pages = 119<U+2013>30 | doi = 10.1071/BT07147}}</ref>

The flowers of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' have a number of adaptations that serve to encourage [[outcrossing]]. Firstly, they are [[protandry|protandrous]]: a flower's pollen is released around 72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen, by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability. Secondly, the period of maximum nectar production closely matches the period during which the flower is sexually active, so honeyeaters are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination. This has proven an effective strategy: almost all pollen is removed within two to three hours of presentation. In addition, honeyeaters tend to move between inflorescences on different plants, rather than between inflorescences on the same plant, at least in high density sites. These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen.<ref name="Collins 2008"/> When self-fertilisation does occur, whether [[autogamous]] or [[geitonogamous]], the resulting seed is almost always aborted,<ref name="Lamont 1998"/> and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100%, at least in high density sites. Limited data for low-density sites, where honeyeaters move from plant to plant less frequently, suggest more of a [[mixed-mating system]].<ref name="Collins 2008"/>

[[File:Bug in Banksia sessilis follicle.JPG|thumb|left|A bug hides inside an open follicle.|alt=Side view of a bug, with green underside and brown back, inside an open follicle.]]
The species is a prolific flowerer, and this, combined with the very high outcrossing rates, results in massive seed output. In one study, the average number of seeds produced per ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' plant was 622, compared with an average of 2 for ''[[Banksia dallanneyi|B.&nbsp;dallanneyi]]''. This exceptionally high [[fecundity]] can be understood as an adaption to regular bushfire. Most ''Banksia'' species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: ''resprouters'' survive fire, resprouting from a [[lignotuber]] or, more rarely, [[Epicormic shoot|epicormic buds]] protected by thick bark; ''reseeders'' are killed by fire, but populations are rapidly re-established through the recruitment of seedlings. ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' is a reseeder, but it differs from many other reseeders in not being strongly [[serotinous]]: the vast majority of seeds are released spontaneously in autumn, even in the absence of fire.<ref name="Lamont 1998"/> The degree of serotiny is a matter of some contradiction in the scientific literature: it has been treated as "serotinous",<ref name="Bell 1998">{{cite journal | author = Bell, David T.; Williams, Deanne S. | year = 1998 | title = Tolerance of thermal shock in seeds | journal = Australian Journal of Botany | volume = 46 |issue = 2 | pages = 221<U+2013>33 | doi= 10.1071/BT97010}}</ref> "weakly serotinous"<ref name="Hanley 2001">{{cite journal | author = Hanley, Mick E.; Lamont, Byron B. | year = 2001 | title = Herbivory, serotiny and seedling defence in Western Australia Proteaceae | journal = Oecologia | volume = 126 | issue = 3 | pages = 409<U+2013>17 | doi = 10.1007/s004420000538}}</ref> and "non-serotinous".<ref name="Lamont 1998"/><ref name="Lamont and Groom 1998">{{cite journal | author = Lamont, Byron B.; Groom, Philip K. | year = 1998 | title = Seed and seedling biology of the woody-fruited Proteaceae | journal = Australian Journal of Botany | volume = 46 |issue = 4 | pages = 387<U+2013>406 | doi = 10.1071/BT96135}}</ref> Regardless of the terminology used, the massive spontaneous seed output of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' is its primary survival strategy, and is so effective that the species has a reputation as an excellent coloniser.<ref name="Lamont 1998"/> However, this strategy, together with its relatively long juvenile period, makes it vulnerable to overly frequent fire.<ref name="Burrows 2003">{{cite book | author = Burrows, Neil; Wardell-Johnson, Grant | year = 2003 | chapter = Fire and plant interactions in forested ecosystems of south-west Western Australia | pages = 225<U+2013>68 | editor = Abbott, Ian; Burrows, Neil (''eds'') | title = Fire in ecosystems of south-west Western Australia | volume = 1 | isbn = 9057821311 | publisher = Backhuys Publishers | location = Leiden}}</ref>

Seeds of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' are short-lived, and must germinate in the winter following their release, or they die.<ref name="Lamont 1998"/> They are also very sensitive to heating, and thus killed by bushfire; in one study, just 30 seconds in boiling water reduced the germination rate from 85% to 22%, and not a single seed survived one minute of boiling.<ref name="Bell 1998"/>

Like most other [[Proteaceae]], ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' has compound [[cluster root]]s, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the [[leaf litter]]. These exude a range of [[carboxylate]]s, including [[citrate]], [[malonate]] and [[trans-aconitate|''trans''-aconitate]], that act as [[acid phosphatase]], allowing the absorption of nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the [[phosphorus]]-deficient native soils of [[Australia]].<ref name="Roelofs 2001">{{cite journal | author = Roelofs, R.

===Disease===
''Banksia sessilis'' is highly susceptible to dieback caused by the introduced plant [[pathogen]] ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'', a soil-borne [[water mould]] that causes [[root rot]]; in fact it is so reliably susceptible that it is considered a good [[indicator species]] for the presence of the disease.<ref name="Shearer 1995">{{cite journal | author= Shearer, B.

However, ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'', being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground, often colonises old disease sites.

The application of [[phosphite]] inhibits growth of ''P.&nbsp;cinnamomi'' in ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'', but does not kill the pathogen. In one study, a foliar spray containing phosphite inhibited the growth of ''P.&nbsp;cinnamomi'' by over 90% in plants infected with ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' two weeks after spraying, and by 66% in plants infected one year after spraying; yet most plants infected shortly before or after spraying were dead 100 days later, while nearly all plants infected seven months later spraying survived a further 100 days. Phosphite is not known to affect plant growth,<ref name="Wilkinson 2001">{{cite journal | author = Wilkinson, C. J.; Holmes, J. M.; Tynan, K. M.; Colquhoun, I. J.; McComb, J. A.; Hardy, G. E.

Infection of coastal stands of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' by the fungus ''[[Armillaria luteobubalina]]'' has also been recorded.

==Cultivation==
===History===
It is not known whether the seed collection sent to the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], by Menzies in 1793 included seeds of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'', but if it did then it did not germinate.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p5"/> The species was successfully germinated, however, from Good's seed, which was sent from Sydney on 6 June 1802 and arrived at Kew the following year.<ref name="Aiton 1810"/> According to Brown's notes it was flowering at Kew by May 1806,<ref name="Mabberley 1985 p443">{{Cite journal | last = Mabberley | year = 1985 | page = 443}}</ref> and in 1810 it was reported in the second edition of ''Hortus Kewensis'' as flowering "most part of the Year".<ref name="Aiton 1810"/> In 1813 a flowering specimen from the nursery of Malcolm and Sweet was featured as Plate 1581 in ''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]''.<ref name="Sims 1813"/>

[[File:Dryandra sessilis (Edgar Dell).jpg|thumb|left|[[Edgar Dell]]'s painting of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'', first published in ''[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|The Western Mail]]'' in 1933 or 1934|alt=Painting of segment of plant showing inflorescences in bud and full flower]]
By the 1830s the species was in cultivation in continental Europe. It was recorded as being cultivated in the garden of [[Karl von H<U+00FC>gel]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] in 1831, and in 1833 it was listed amongst the rare plants that had been introduced into [[Belgium]]. Along with several hundred other native Australian plants it was exhibited at plant shows held at [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and [[Haarlem]] in the [[Netherlands]] in the 1840s and 1850s. By this time, however, English gardeners had already begun to lose interest in the Proteaceae, and by the end of the 19th century European interest in the cultivation of Proteaceae was virtually non-existent.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p5"/>

In Australia, there was little interest in the cultivation of Australian plants until the mid 20th century, despite a long-standing appreciation of their beauty as [[wildflower]]s. For example, in 1933 and 1934 ''[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|The Western Mail]]'' published a series of [[Edgar Dell]] paintings of Western Australian wildflowers,<ref name="Hewson 1999">{{cite book | first = Helen | last = Hewson | year = 1999 | title = Australia: 300 years of botanical illustration | publisher = CSIRO Publishing | location = Collingwood, Victoria | isbn = 0-643-06366-8 | pages = 167<U+2013>68}}</ref> including a painting of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis''. These were subsequently republished in [[Charles Gardner]]'s 1935 ''West Australian Wild Flowers''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/dell.edgar.html|title=Edgar Dell (1901<U+2013>2008)|last=Keighery |first=Greg|year=2008|work=Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria, Australian National Herbarium|publisher=Australian National Herbarium|accessdate=12 February 2010}}</ref> One of the first published colour photographs of the species appeared in [[William Blackall]]'s 1954 ''[[How to know Western Australian wildflowers]]'', but this publication was restricted to plant identification.<ref name="Blackall 1954">{{cite book | first = William | last = Blackall | year = 1954 | title = How to know Western Australian wildflowers, Part 1 | publisher = The University of Western Australia Press}}</ref> The species was discussed and illustrated in the 1959 ''Wildflowers of Western Australia'', and in the 1973 ''Flowers and plants of Western Australia'', but these books did not provide cultivation advice either.<ref name="Gardner 1959">{{cite book | first = Charles | last = Gardner | authorlink = Charles Gardner | year = 1959 | title = Wildflowers of Western Australia | location = Perth | publisher = West Australian Newspapers | pages = 33<U+2013>34}}</ref><ref name="Erickson 1973">{{cite book | first = Rica | last = Erickson | authorlink = Rica Erickson | coauthors = George, A.

Possibly the first published information on the cultivation of ''Dryandra'' appeared in the magazine ''[[Australian Native Plants Society (Australia)#Australian Plants|Australian Plants]]'' in June and September 1961.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p5"/> ''D.&nbsp;sessilis'' was among the species treated, but as there was not yet any experimental data on cultivation, information was restricted to its aesthetic qualities and the soil in which it naturally occurs.<ref name="Royce 1961a">{{cite journal | first = R. D. | last = Royce | year = 1961 | title = The genus ''Dryandra'' | journal = Australian Plants | volume = 1 | issue = 7 | page = 5}}</ref><ref name="Royce 1961b">{{cite journal | first = R. D. | last = Royce | year = 1961 | title = The genus ''Dryandra'' | journal = Australian Plants | volume = 1 | issue = 8 | page = 19}}</ref>

From its inception in 1962, the [[Kings Park and Botanic Garden]] undertook extensive research into the cultivation of native plants, resulting in two early publications that mentioned the cultivation potential of ''B.&nbsp;sessilis''.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p5"/> In 1965, [[John Stanley Beard]] published ''Descriptive catalogue of Western Australian plants'', "a work of reference in which the horticultural characteristics of the plants concerned could be looked up by the staff", which described ''D.&nbsp;sessilis'' as an erect shrub with pale yellow flowers appearing from May to October, growing in sand and gravel.<ref name="Beard 1965">{{cite book | first = John Stanley | last = Beard | authorlink = John Stanley Beard | year = 1965 | title = Descriptive catalogue of Western Australian plants | page = 20 | location = Perth | publisher = Kings Park Board}}</ref> Five years later, Arthur Fairall published ''West Australian native plants in cultivation''. This presented largely the same information as Beard's ''catalogue'', adding only that the species flowers well in its third season.<ref name="Fairall 1970">{{cite book | first = Arthur | last = Fairall | year = 1970 | title = West Australian native plants in cultivation | location = Rushcutters Bay, New South Wales | publisher = Pergamon Press | isbn = 0080174779 | page = 112}}</ref>

===Current knowledge===
According to current knowledge, ''B.&nbsp;sessilis'' as an extremely hardy plant that grows in a range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage,<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/> and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p203"/> It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with [[Beekeeping|beekeepers]].<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/> However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p203"/> It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from [[cutting]]s has proven virtually impossible.<ref name="Cavanagh 1994">{{cite journal | author = Cavanagh, T. | year = 1994 | title = ''Dryandra'', a growing guide for beginners | journal = Australian Plants | volume = 18 | pages = 11<U+2013>17}}</ref> Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.<ref name="Cavanagh 2006 p203"/>
