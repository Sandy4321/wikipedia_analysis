The '''38 class''' was the most popular type of [[steam locomotive]] built and operated by the [[New South Wales Government Railways]] in [[Australia]]. Built from 1943, the 30 locomotives in the class were designed to haul [[express train]]s and replace the [[New South Wales Government Railways 36 class|36 class]] on these premium workings. They were the first NSW locomotives to use the popular Pacific [[4-6-2]] wheel arrangement.

The 38 class were first conceived in 1938. They suffered many delays during construction - mostly due to the [[World War II|Second World War]]. [[3801 (NSW steam locomotive)|3801]] was the first engine completed and entered service in January 1943. The last in the class, 3830 entered service in November 1949. The first five locomotives were built in the [[Clyde Engineering|Clyde Railway Workshops]] and wore distinctive [[streamliner|streamlined]] [[boiler]] casing. The remaining 25 locomotives were built at the New South Wales Government Railway Workshops at [[Eveleigh, New South Wales]] (13 locomotives) and NSWGR Workshops at [[Cardiff, New South Wales|Cardiff]] in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] (12 locomotives). 

By 1951 [[diesel locomotive]]s started appearing on the rails of NSW. These gradually took the "glamour workings" away from the 38 class, who would be confined to all-stations passenger and even goods trains. They could still be found working The [[Newcastle Flyer]] up until December 1970.

Four 38 class locomotives were saved from [[scrap]]. Currently only 3801 and 3830 (the first and last locomotives in the class) are operational (3801 by [[New South Wales Rail Transport Museum]] (previously by [[3801 Limited]] until Nov 2006) and 3830 by the [[Powerhouse Museum]]), while 3820 is maintained as a static exhibit at the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum. 3813 suffered at the hands of a new railway commissioner after a complete restoration was begun in the mid 1970s.  It is now in a stripped condition at the [[Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum]]
