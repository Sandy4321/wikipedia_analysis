The '''Albany Convention Center''' (ACC) is a proposed [[convention center]] to be located in downtown [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York]]. The complex was initially proposed by Albany [[Mayor of Albany, New York|Mayor]] [[Gerald Jennings]] in 1994, though no real action was taken until 2002; the project has been controversial from the beginning. In 2004 the Albany Convention Center Authority (ACCA) was established by the [[New York Legislature]] to develop plans for the site. Supported by [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[George Pataki]], the project was awarded a $75 million grant in 2005. Initial cost estimates for the project started at around $150 million, but these soon rose to almost $400 million before dropping again to $220 million after turning hotel and parking garage development over to private firms. The finished complex is expected to have around {{convert|300000|sqft|m2}} of convention space.

The main incentive for the ACC is the lack of significant convention space in Albany<U+2014>New York's capital<U+2014>and the potential for significant use by state-wide organizations. The project is also controversial, being seen as a poor use of tax-payer money, especially during an [[Late 2000s <U+2013> early 2010s recession in the Americas|economic recession]].

==History==
===Initial plans===
The plan originated with Albany Mayor [[Gerald Jennings]] and various supporters in 1994,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Another Step In a Complex Dance |last=Lebrun |first=Fred |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2010-03-28 |accessdate=2010-09-02 |page=D1 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=10070999}}</ref> though progress was not actually made until 2002 when the mayor put out a "request for expressions of interest", with which the mayor requested possible locations for the convention center as well as preliminary designs and cost estimates.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Wanted: Convention Center, Hotel Sites |author=No author listed |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2002-02-13 |page=B4 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6158120}}</ref> The complex was initially expected to cost between $140 and $160 million.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Albany Convention Center Proposals Are In |last=Duggan |first=Erin |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2002-04-19 |page=B4 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6169062}}</ref> The incentive for such a plan was based mainly on the lack of significant convention space in Albany and potential profits that could be generated from such a center in the state capital. Early plans suggested a 400-room hotel and up to {{convert|130000|sqft|m2}} of convention space, large enough to accommodate 5,000 to 7,000 people.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Lure of Profits Propels Plan |last=Harlan |first=Kevin |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2002-12-15 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |page=E1 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6148323}}</ref>

Plans expanded quickly and by early 2003, estimates had reached $185 million with {{convert|250000|sqft|m2}} and parking for up to 1,500 cars. By this time a Jennings-appointed convention center task force had yet to decide on a site. The top two locations were west of the [[Times Union Center|Pepsi Arena]] between State and Beaver Streets and east of the Pepsi bounded by Broadway, Beaver Street, and Greene Street.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Breslin Backs County Hotel Tax |first=Brian |last=Nearing |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2003-04-29 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |page=B1 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6208613}}</ref>

===Government support===
In June 2004, with the support of Governor [[George Pataki]], Assembly Speaker [[Sheldon Silver]], and Senate Majority Leader [[Joseph L. Bruno|Joseph Bruno]], the [[New York Legislature]] established the Albany Convention Center Authority (ACCA),<ref>{{Cite news|title=State Leaders Exit Angry |last=Duggan |first=Erin |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2004-06-24 |page=A1 |accessdate=2010-08-30 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6296579}}</ref> the public body entrusted with developing the convention center. The outcome was not that preferred by Jennings: his initial plan sought a development authority with greater power and the ability to finance up to $500 million with state backing. As created by the Legislature, the Authority was a group made of members to be appointed by a number of different state officials, with a finance limit of $185 million.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Lawmakers Alter Plan for Convention Center |last=Woodruff |first=Cathy |coauthor=James M. Odato |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2003-06-17 |page=B3 |accessdate=2010-08-30 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6216007}}</ref>

In 2005, [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]'s three-percent hotel tax was increased to five percent and a year later it was upped to six percent. The additional tax was expected to raise $3 million annually in an effort to pay off the ACCA's $8.5 million estimated annual cost.{{#tag:ref|Until construction on the project actually starts, the revenues are split up with $1 million going toward administrative costs for the Albany Convention Center Authority and $2 million going directly toward the debt that Albany County owes for the Times Union Center (which the county owns).<ref name=march2008/>|group=Note}}<ref name=march2008>{{Cite news|title=Extension of Hotel Tax at Issue |last=O'Brien |first=Tim |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2008-03-09 |accessdate=2010-09-01 |page=E1 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6540668}}</ref> Many local hotel owners and managers opposed the increased tax since the proceeds were funding a future competitor.<ref name=jan2008/>

In early 2008, after a study by an architectural firm, the estimated cost was increased to almost $400 million. Jennings, the original proposer of the ACC, responded to this estimate by indicating the plan might no longer be viable. Members of the Authority, however, disagreed. At this time the plans were revised to include a {{convert|244000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} convention center, a 400-room [[Sheraton Hotel]] and a raised parking garage with capacity for 1,100 cars. The project's major setback was lack of funding from the state, which was dealing with a $4.4 billion budget deficit.<ref name=jan2008>{{Cite news|title=Pet Project Now in Doghouse |last=O'Brien |first=Tim |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2008-01-31 |accessdate=2010-09-01 |page=A1 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6534421}}</ref> Many locals opposed the plan as wasteful spending; in contrast, a February 2008 ''[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]'' editorial indicated its support saying, "This is a state project, not a city project and one entirely deserving of a commitment even larger than the $205 million that's been approved already."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Yes, a Convention Center |author=No author listed |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2008-02-03 |accessdate=2010-09-01 |page=B4 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6534742}}</ref>

With the state only approving about $200 million (including a $75 million grant from Governor Pataki), the ACCA made it clear in April 2008 that state tax money should pay for the difference ($190 million) in funding the project.<ref name=april20081/> In response, the new [[David Paterson|Paterson]] administration contracted with [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] to review the viability of the project. By this point the project had spent only $2 million of the $75 million allotted by former Governor Pataki. The funding could only be spent on master planning.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Outside Scrutiny for Center |last=Odato |first=James M. |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2010-09-01 |page=A1 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6547031}}</ref> While waiting for approval from the State, the project was given permission to begin archaeological digs around the preferred site between Broadway, Hudson Avenue and the South Mall Arterial. Various relics from Albany's Dutch past were uncovered and catalogued for inclusion in future museum displays.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Convention Center Authority Digging In |last=O'Brien |first=Tim |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate=2010-09-02 |page=D1 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6563278}}</ref>

While ACCA board member (and Albany Assemblyman) [[John McEneny|Jack McEneny]] stated his belief that the ACC would eventually pay for itself through its revenue, the [[Empire Center for New York State Policy]] described it as "a white elephant from the start. Here at a time where our borrowing is already excessive and our state budget is already overcommitted, you're talking about bailing out a project that was unnecessary to begin with." By this time, a preliminary location had been selected by the ACCA, several{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} downtown blocks near Broadway and Hudson Avenue, an area McEneny described as "the last ugly section of downtown".<ref name=april20081>{{Cite news|title=A Cost Shift for Convention Center? |last=Odato |first=James M. |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |page=A3 |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2010-09-01 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6546611}}</ref> A study sponsored by the ACCA projected that the ACC would bring in 50 to 85 events annually, each lasting one to four days; 100,000 to 185,000 more annual visitors are expected to the city as a result.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Expenses Won't Wait for Convention Site |last=O'Brien |first=Tim |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2008-08-30 |accessdate=2010-09-02 |page=B1 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6898230}}</ref>

Amid large cuts proposed by [[Andrew Cuomo]] in his 2011 budget, the original funding for the ACC remained.<ref>{{cite newspaper |title=Governor's Budget Keeps Convention Center Alive |last=Carleo-Evangelist |first=Jordan |work=Times Union (Albany) |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2011-02-02 |url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Governor-s-budget-keeps-convention-center-alive-992663.php}}</ref>

In late 2008, $10 million (part of the original $75 million promised by Governor Pataki) was released by Governor Paterson to begin the acquisition of the land necessary for the project. The first piece of land, a {{convert|0.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} parking lot, was bought in July 2009 from [[Greyhound Lines, Inc.]] at a cost of $469,673.<ref name=land1>{{Cite news|title=Deal Signals Start of Acquisition |last=Carleo-Evangelist |first=Jordan |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2009-08-01 |accessdate=2010-09-02 |page=B4 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=8431148}}</ref> In August 2009, the Albany County Legislature approved the sale of nine vacant county-owned lots<U+2014>totaling {{convert|0.39|acre|ha}}<U+2014>to the ACCA at a cost of $453,000.<ref name=land2>{{Cite news|title=Center Land Buys Grow |first=Jordan |last=Carleo-Evangelist |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |accessdate=2010-09-02 |date=2009-08-29 |page=B8 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=8585004}}</ref> In February 2010, the ACCA bought about {{convert|0.5|acre|ha}} of land, which brought its total to about {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}}.<ref name=land3/> In August 2010 it purchased about {{convert|3|acre|ha}} of land at a cost of $5.9 million.

In November 2009, the ACCA revealed its design, developed by [[HNTB]]. A formal price was also released: $220 million. The ACCA was able to drop from its earlier $400 million estimate by turning hotel and parking garage development over to private developers. This brought the cost estimate down to between $225 million and $240 million. After considering the cost of goods and commodities during the economic recession, the estimate dropped again to $220 million.<ref name=design/>

Because the project was not [[Shovel ready|shovel-ready]] at the time, the ACC was not eligible for [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus funds]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=No Money in Stimulus Package for Convention Center |first=Michael |last=DeMasi |publisher=The Business Review (Albany) |work=American City Business Journals, Inc |date=2009-01-30 |accessdate=2010-08-30 |url=http://albany.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2009/01/26/daily55.html}}</ref>

==Description==
[[File:Albany Convention Center 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Bird's eye view of the proposed Albany Convention Center {{as of|lc=y|2009|11}}; Broadway is shown at bottom-left, Hudson Avenue is along right side.]]
The ACC will be located along Broadway between the [[South Mall Arterial]] and Hudson Avenue. The current site consists mostly of surface-level parking lots.<ref name=land3>{{Cite news|title=Convention Center Land Buys Continue |last=Churchill |first=Chris |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2010-02-25 |page=C1 |accessdate=2010-08-30 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=9692907}}</ref> The design will consist mainly of a brick and glass structure. The meeting area would comprise an exhibition hall, two ballrooms and other various meeting spaces totaling about {{convert|300000|sqft|m2}}.<ref name=design/>

In early 2008, it was announced that the site would include a 400-room Sheraton Hotel, to be run by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc., of [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]]; a {{convert|300000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} convention center, to be operated by SMG Management<U+2014>the company that operates the Times Union Center<U+2014>and an 1,100-car parking garage. A bridge will also connect the convention center to the Times Union Center.<ref name=jan2008/> The back of the center will be pushed up against the South Mall Arterial, with loading docks on that side. A plaza will be built near the center of the complex, facing Broadway. The design will allow for future expansion of the convention space, if needed.<ref name=design>{{Cite news|title=Designs on Downtown Albany's Future |last=Churchill |first=Chris |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2009-11-20 |accessdate=2010-09-02 |page=A1 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=9044605}}</ref>

Within the site boundary is the [[Van Ostrande-Radliff House]], one of the oldest houses in the [[Capital District]], which is also believed to be the oldest building in the city of Albany.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Albany Preservation Report | page = 7 | publisher = Historic Albany Foundation | date = Spring 2007 |format=PDF | accessdate = 2010-09-04 | url = http://www.historic-albany.org/HAF%20SP07%20newsletter%20for%20web.pdf}}</ref> The house was built by Johannes van Ostrande around 1728 and is a rare example of Dutch architecture from its time. Owner Brian Parker came into agreement with the ACCA that the building would be saved, possibly making use of it as a visitor's center.<ref>{{Cite news|title=This Old House Under Our Noses |last=Grondahl |first=Paul |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2010-09-02 |page=D1 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=7306654}}</ref>

==Controversy==
The Albany Convention Center has seen significant opposition from its inception. Opposing viewpoints offer a range of alternative plans. Some state that Albany doesn't need a convention center at all, some suggest the ACCA consider expanding current convention facilities and others have proposed moving the project to other areas of the city, such as the [[University Heights, Albany, New York|University Heights]] neighborhood, the [[College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering]] campus, or the [[W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus|Harriman State Office Campus]].<ref name=feb>{{Cite news|title=Forget About an Albany Convention Center |first=Paul |last=Bray |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |page=B2 |date=2010-02-14 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=9502749}}</ref> It has also been suggested that since the ACCA has already accumulated some funds (though not enough to complete the current plans), it should instead invest the capital in buying up vacant buildings and renovating them as a stimulus for the downtown economy. Opponents question the cost of the project, especially during such difficult fiscal times.<ref name=land3/>

Even considering the economic crisis, the Albany area has seen a general shortage of construction workers. The $4.2 billion [[GlobalFoundries]] chip plant that was begun in nearby Malta in 2008 already strained the labor market and some worry that building the ACC will just exacerbate the problem.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Build It and There May Be a Labor Shortage |last=Churchill |first=Chris |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=2009-08-17 |accessdate=2010-09-02 |page=A1 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=8505135}}</ref>
