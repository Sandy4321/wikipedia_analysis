In [[astronomy]], '''color<U+2013>color diagrams''' are a means of comparing the [[apparent magnitude]]s of [[star]]s at different [[wavelength]]s. [[Astronomer]]s typically observe at narrow bands around certain wavelengths, and objects observed will have different [[luminosity|brightnesses]] in each band. The difference the brightness in two bands is referred to as [[color index|color]]. On color<U+2013>color diagrams, the color defined by two wavelength bands is plotted on the horizontal [[coordinate axis|axis]], and then the color defined by another brightness difference (though usually there is one band involved in determining both colors) will be plotted on the vertical axis.  

==Background==

While stars are not perfect [[blackbody|blackbodies]], to first order the [[spectrum|spectra]] of light emitted by stars conforms closely to a blackbody radiation curve, also referred to sometimes as a [[thermal radiation]] curve. The overall shape of a black body curve is uniquely determined by its [[temperature]], and the wavelength of peak intensity is proportional to temperature, a relation known as [[Wien's Displacement Law]]. Thus, observation of a stellar spectrum allows determination of its [[effective temperature]]. Obtaining complete spectra for stars through [[spectrometry]] is much more involved than simple [[photometry]] in a few bands. Thus by comparing the magnitude of the star in multiple different [[color index|color indices]], the [[effective temperature]] of the star can still be determined, as magnitude differences between each color will be unique for that temperature. As such, color-color diagrams can be used as a means of representing the stellar population, much like a [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram]], and stars of different [[stellar classification|spectral classes]] will inhabit different parts of the diagram. This feature leads to applications within various wavelength bands.

===Color outliers===
Analyzing data from large observational surveys, such as the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS) or [[2 Micron All Sky Survey]] (2MASS), can be challenging due to the huge number of data produced. For surveys such as these, color-color diagrams have been used to find outliers from the [[main sequence]] stellar population. Once these outliers are identified, they can then be studied in more detail. This method has been used to identify ultracool [[subdwarf]]s.<ref name="subdwarf1">{{cite journal | author = Burgasser, A.

===Star formation===

Color-color diagrams are often used in [[infrared]] astronomy to study [[star formation|star forming]] regions. Stars form in [[interstellar cloud|clouds]] of [[cosmic dust|dust]]. As the star continues to contract, a circumstellar disk of dust is formed, and this dust is heated by the star inside. The dust itself then begins to radiate as a blackbody, though one much cooler than the star. As a result, an [[infrared excess|excess of infrared radiation]] is observed for the star. Even without circumstellar dust, regions undergoing star formation exhibit high infrared [[luminosity|luminosities]] compared to stars on the main sequence.<ref>{{cite journal | author=C. Struck-Marcell and B.M. Tinsley | year = 1978 | title = Star formation rates and infrared radiation | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=221 | pages=562<U+2013>566 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1978ApJ...221..562S | doi=10.1086/156057}}</ref> Each of these effects is distinct from the reddening of starlight which occurs as a result of [[scattering]] off of dust in the [[interstellar medium]]. 

[[Image:Trapez ccdiag.jpg|thumb|right|Color<U+2013>color diagram of the Trapezium cluster shows that many cluster members exhibit infrared excess, which is characteristic of stars with circumstellar disks.]]

Color<U+2013>color diagrams allow for these effects to be isolated. As the color<U+2013>color relationships of [[main sequence]] stars are well known, a theoretical main sequence can be plotted for reference, as is done with the solid black line in the example to the right. [[Interstellar]] dust scattering is also well understood, allowing bands to be drawn on a color<U+2013>color diagram defining the region in which stars [[interstellar reddening|reddened]] by interstellar dust are expected to be observed, indicated on the color<U+2013>color diagram by dashed lines. The typical axes for infrared color<U+2013>color diagrams have (H - K) on the horizontal axis and (J - H) on the vertical axis (see [[infrared astronomy]] for information on band color designations). On a diagram with these axes, stars which fall to the right of the main sequence and the reddening bands drawn are significantly brighter in the K band than main sequence stars, including main sequence stars which have experienced reddening due to interstellar dust. Of the J, H, and K bands, K is the longest wavelength, so objects which are anomalously bright in the K band are said to exhibit [[infrared excess]]. These objects are likely [[protostellar]] in nature, with the excess radiation at long wavelengths caused by suppression by the [[reflection nebula]] in which the protostars are embedded.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lada, C.J. et al. | title = Infrared L-Band Observations of the Trapezium Cluster: A Census of Circumstellar Disks and Candidate Protostars | journal = The Astronomical Journal | volume = 120 | issue = 6 | pages = 3162<U+2013>3176 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000AJ....120.3162L | doi = 10.1086/316848}}</ref> Color<U+2013>color diagrams can be used then as a means of studying stellar formation, as the state of a star in its formation can be roughly determined by looking at its position on the diagram.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Charles Lada and Fred Adams | year=1992 | title=Interpreting infrared color-color diagrams - Circumstellar disks around low- and intermediate-mass young stellar objects | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=393 | pages=278<U+2013>288 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1992ApJ...393..278L | doi=10.1086/171505}}</ref>
