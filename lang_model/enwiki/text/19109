'''John Henry Mohardt''' (January 21, 1898 <U+2013> November 24, 1961) was an [[American football]] and [[baseball]] player.  He played both sports at the [[University of Notre Dame]] from 1918 through 1921 and was selected as an All-American at the [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] position.  He played professional baseball for the [[Detroit Tigers]] for five games in April 1922. He also played professional football for four seasons for the [[Chicago Cardinals]] (1922-1923), [[Racine Legion]] (1924), and [[Chicago Bears]] (1925).

==Early years==
Mohardt was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] in January 1898.<ref name=BR/> His family moved to [[Gary, Indiana]], while he was a child. After the tenth grade, Mohardt dropped out to work in a local steel mill.  He worked in the mill for two years before enrolling at the [[University of Notre Dame]].  According to Mohardt's son, Mohardt was given two tests by Notre Dame officials -- running and throwing -- which he passed and enrolled at Notre Dame in 1918 at age 20.<ref name=IBC>{{cite web|author=Dan Cichalski |title=Johnny Mohardt: He Batted 1.000 - You Can Look It Up!|publisher=The Infinite Baseball Card Set|accessdate=January 5, 2014|url=http://infinitecardset.blogspot.com/2011/02/67-johnny-mohardt-he-batted-1000-you.html}}</ref> 

==Notre Dame==
Mohardt attended the [[University of Notre Dame]] from 1918 to 1921.  While there, he participated and received [[varsity letter]]s in football, baseball, and track.  He was both a pitcher and an outfielder at Notre Dame, compiled a .339 [[batting average]] in three years of baseball, and was the captain of Notre Dame's 1921 baseball team.  He also exhibited "an exceptional arm," had speed, and was a good fielder.<ref name=DFP1/> 

In football, he played [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] under coach [[Knute Rockne]] and was a teammate of [[George Gipp]]. Mohardt had "a powerful physique," though weighing only 160 pounds, and with the exception of a broken nose sustained in a football game in 1920, he was never seriously injured in three years of football at Notre Dame.<ref name=DFP1/>  Mohardt played in Gipp's shadow in 1919 and 1920, but became the team's lead halfback in 1921.  Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10-1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns.<ref name=NDE/>  [[Grantland Rice]] wrote that "Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space" and noted that the 1921 Notre Dame team "was the first team we know of to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game."<ref>{{cite news|title=Where The West Got The Jump: In Addition To Developing Strong Defense and Good Running Game, Has Built Up Forward Pass|author=Grantland Rice|publisher=American Golfer|date=December 3, 1921|url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/AmericanGolfer/1921/ag2424o.pdf}}</ref> Mohardt was selected as a first-team member of [[1921 College Football All-America Team]] by Lawrence Perry and a second-team All-American by [[Walter Camp]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F20614F63E5D14738DDDA80A94DA415B818EF1D3|title=Walter Camp's All-America Selections for 1921|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 21, 1921|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref>

The authors of ''The Notre Dame Football Encyclopedia'' wrote of Mohardt:<blockquote>"Had he come along at another time or at another school, Mohardt might have gone down as one of the best college football players ever.  His misfortune was that he played on some of the best Notre Dame teams in history and in the same backfield as the great George Gipp."<ref name=NDE>{{cite book|author=Keith Marder, Mark Spellen, Jim Donovan|title=The Notre Dame Football Encyclopedia: The Ultimate Guide to America's Favorite College Team|publisher=Citadel Press|year=2001|isbn=0806521082|page=148}}</ref></blockquote>

In early 1922, Mohardt lost his eligibility to continue playing for Notre Dame after it was discovered that he had played in a professional football game.<ref name=DFP2>{{Cite news|title=Mohardt Signs Contract With Detroit Club: Notre Dame Star Slated to Go South With Tigers This Spring|newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=February 5, 1922|page=23|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/doc/566768220.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Feb+5%2C+1922&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+%281858-1922%29&edition=&startpage=&desc=MOHARDT+SIGNS+CONTRACT+WITH+DETROIT+CLUB}}</ref>  He was initially charged with playing for the [[Carlinville, Illinois]] football team in a professional game, but he denied doing so and claimed he was in class.<ref>{{cite news|title=Accused Football Men Have Alibis: Desch and Mohardt of Notre Dame Say They Are Victims of Mistaken Identity|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 29, 1922|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20A15FA3E551A738DDDA90B94D9405B828EF1D3}}</ref> He subsequently admitted to having played for the [[Racine, Wisconsin]] team on December 4, 1921, in a game against the [[Green Bay Packers]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Mohardt Played in Professional Football Game: Notre Dame Star Is 22d Middle Western Athlete To Admit Violations of Rules; To Join Major Leagues; Has Had Offers From Several Clubs, but Is Undecided Which to Accept|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 4, 1922|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60916F63A541B7A93C6A91789D85F468285F9}}</ref>

Mohardt was also reported to be "one of the most brilliant students who has ever left Notre Dame."<ref name=DFP1>{{cite news|title=Mohardt Stars In Classroom As Well As On Athletic Field: New Tiger Completes Studies at Notre Dame With High Marks; Plans to Take Up Course in Surgery in Fall|newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=March 1, 1922|page=14|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/doc/566718514.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Mar+1%2C+1922&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+%281858-1922%29&edition=&startpage=&desc=Mohardt+Stars+In+Classroom+As+Well+As+On+Athletic+Field}}</ref>

==Professional baseball==
Mohardt signed to play professional baseball for the [[Detroit Tigers]] in February 1922.<ref name=DFP2/>  He was also offered contracts from the five other major league teams and chose Detroit because they agreed that they would allow him to leave the team in the fall of 1922 to attend medical school.<ref name=DFP1/>  

Mohardt traveled to [[Augusta, Georgia]], where he participated in Detroit's spring training.<ref>{{cite news|title=Grid Star Makes Tigers Take Notice|newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=March 11, 1922|page=14|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/doc/566806034.html?FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Mar+11%2C+1922&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+%281858-1922%29&edition=&startpage=&desc=Grid+Star+Makes+Tigers+Take+Notice}}</ref>Kref>{{cite news|author=L. A. Young|title=Mohardt Student As Well As Athlete|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=March 16, 1922|page=7}}</ref>  He made the regular season roster, but he appeared in only five games for the Tigers, making his debut on April 15, 1922, and playing in his final game seven days later.  In two plate appearances, he had a single and a base on balls and scored two runs.  In three appearances in the outfield, he had one putout and no errors. He left major league baseball with perfect 1.000 [[batting average]] and fielding percentage and two runs scored in his only two plate appearances.<ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=John Mohardt|publisher=baseball-reference.com|accessdate=January 5, 2014|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/moharjo01.shtml}}</ref>  

With the Tigers having [[Ty Cobb]], [[Harry Heilmann]] and [[Bobby Veach]] in the outfield, Mohardt was unlikely to get significant playing time.  Accordingly, after a short stay in Detroit, manager Ty Cobb decided to send Mohardt to the minor leagues for seasoning.  The ''Detroit Free Press'' noted: "Although Mohardt gives promise of developing into a great player, he isn't ready for regular assignment in the major leagues."<ref>{{cite news|title=Detroit Claims Witt By Waiver Route and Mohardt Will Go To Minor League|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=April 16, 1922|page=23|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/doc/566833455.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+16%2C+1922&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+%281858-1922%29&edition=&startpage=&desc=DETROIT+CLAIMS+WITT+BY+WAIVER+ROUTE+AND+MOHARDT+WILL+GO+TO+MINOR+LEAGUE}}</ref>  

On April 26, 1922, Mohardt was assigned to the Denver baseball team in the Western League.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mohardt Goes To Denver Club|newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=April 27, 1922|page=16|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/doc/566784018.html?FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+27%2C+1922&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+%281858-1922%29&edition=&startpage=&desc=Mohardt+Goes+To+Denver+Club}}</ref> He subsequently appeared in 22 games for the [[Syracuse Stars]] in 1922, compiling a .185 batting average.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Mohardt Minor League Statistics|publisher=baseball-reference.com|accessdate=January 5, 2014|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=mohard001joh}}</ref>  He also played as a first baseman for Greenville in the South Atlantic Conference in 1923.<ref>{{cite news|title=South Atlantic Fielding|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=November 8, 1923|page=6}}</ref>

==Professional football==
Mohardt also played four years of professional football from 1922 to 1925.  He was the starting right halfback for the [[Chicago Cardinals]] during the 1922 and 1923 seasons.  In 1924, he played at the wingback position for the [[Racine Legion]], and he concluded his football career playing for the [[Chicago Bears]] in 1925.  He shared the left halfback position with [[Red Grange]] in 1925.<ref>{{cite web|title=Johnny Mohardt|publisher=pro-football-reference.com|accessdate=January 5, 2014|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MohaJo20.htm}}</ref>

==Later years==
After his playing career was over, Mohardt attended [[Northwestern University Medical School]].  He did his residency at the [[Mayo Clinic]] and, in 1933, began a private medical practice in [[Chicago]]. During [[World War II]], he enlisted in the [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Medical Corps]], attaining the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], and served with the 12th General Hospital Unit during the [[North African Campaign|North African]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]]s.  He later became a surgeon at a veterans hospital and became assistant director of the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]]'s Surgical Service.<ref name=NDE/><ref name=IBC/>

In November 1961, at age 63, Mohardt committed suicide at his home in [[La Jolla, California]], by severing the [[femoral artery]] in his [[groin]].<ref name=IBC/><ref>{{cite book|author=Joel Zoss, John Bowman, John Stewart Bowman|title=Diamonds in the Rough: The Untold History of Baseball|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2004|page=346|isbn=0803299206}}</ref>
