The '''Cumberland Valley Railroad''' {{reporting mark|CVRR}}  was an early [[rail transport|railroad]] in [[Pennsylvania]], originally chartered in 1831 to connect with Pennsylvania<U+2019>s [[Main Line of Public Works]].  Freight and passenger service in the [[Cumberland Valley]] in south central Pennsylvania from near [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] began in 1837, with service later extended to [[Hagerstown, Maryland]] and then extending into the [[Shenandoah Valley]] to [[Winchester, Virginia]].<ref name="HoFCPI">History of Franklin County Pennsylvania, Illustrated</ref>  It employed up to 1,800 workers.<ref name="CVRRmarker1">Cumberland Valley Railroad Historical Marker - Behind the Marker</ref>

During the [[American Civil War]] the line had strategic importance in supplying Union troops in the Shenandoah Valley.  It also ran the first passenger [[sleeping car]] in the U.S. on the Chambersburg-Harrisburg route in 1839.<ref name="BerlinMarker">Philip Berlin Historical Marker - Behind the Marker</ref>

The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR) gained control of  the CVRR as early as 1859, and officially purchased it on [[June 2]] [[1919]].  The PRR<U+2019>s successor, the [[Penn Central]], closed all railway facilities in Chambersburg in 1972 and its successor, [[Conrail]], abandoned major pieces of the line in 1976.<ref name="CVRRmarker1">Cumberland Valley Railroad Historical Marker - Behind the Marker</ref>

== Early history==
The Cumberland Valley Railroad Company was chartered by the Pennsylvania Legislature on [[April 2]] [[1831]], to construct a railroad from [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]] to a point on the [[Susquehanna River]] at or near Harrisburg. This charter expired, but it was renewed on [[April 15]] [[1835]], allowing the road to be built from the Susquehanna River to Chambersburg. On [[June 27]] [[1835]], [[Thomas McColloh]] was elected as the first President of the road, and in August, William Milner Roberts was selected as Chief Engineer.

The initial cost of building the road, including a bridge across the Susquehanna, was estimated before construction at $564,064, and the average annual receipts of the road at $284,617.50, calculated at 100&nbsp;passengers each way per day at 3&nbsp;cents per mile, and 35,000&nbsp;tons of through freight and 51,950&nbsp;tons of local freight, at 4<U+00BD>&nbsp;cents per ton per mile.  $642,000 was raised by local stock subscription and construction began in the Spring of 1836.<ref name="HoFCPI"/>

The railroad opened for travel from White Hill, near Harrisburg  to Carlisle in August, 1837, and through to Chambersburg in November, 1837.  The first locomotive, built by [[William Norris (locomotive builder)|William Norris]] in [[Philadelphia]], had two driving wheels, wooden spokes, and was named "Cumberland Valley," 

The passenger cars carried 14 passengers each and were bought used from the [[Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad]], according to the 1887 <U+201C>History of Franklin County Pennsylvania.<U+201D>  The railroad track was constructed of cross ties laid {{ft to m|4.5}} apart without ballast, with 5x9&nbsp;in (127x229 mm) oak stringers serving as rails.  Iron bar, {{in to mm|0.625}} thick by {{in to mm|2.25}} wide, was spiked to the top of the stringers.  When service began to Chambersburg, the iron was not laid for the last {{mi to km|3}} and the cars were run in on the wooden stringers.<ref name="HoFCPI"/>

The railroad bridge across the Susquehanna was opened for travel on January 16, 1839. The first regular passenger service to Philadelphia, via the [[Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mount Joy and Lancaster Railroad]], began on [[February 1]] [[1839]] with the following schedule:

{{cquote|
Leave Chambersburg at 4 o'clock in the morning;

Arrive at Harrisburg at 8,

at Lancaster at 12,

at Philadelphia before 6 P.M.

Returning it will leave Harrisburg as soon as the cars from
Philadelphia arrived, 

about 5 o'clock in the evening and
arrive at Chambersburg at 10 P.M.<ref name="HoFCPI"/>}}

The Cumberland Valley Railroad pioneered the use of sleeping cars in the spring of 1839, a first on any American railroad, with a car named "Chambersburg."  The berths were upholstered boards, in three rows, one above the other, held by leather straps, and in the daytime were folded back against the walls.  A couple of years later a second car, the "Carlisle," was introduced into service.<ref name="BerlinMarker">Philip Berlin Historical Marker - Behind the Marker</ref>

Passengers traveling from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia traveled by horse drawn stage for 36 hours to get to Chambersburg, arriving about midnight, then left by rail about 1 am, arriving at Harrisburg about 5 am, in time to catch a HPMt.J&L train to Philadelphia.

<U+201C>The History of Franklin County Pennsylvania<U+201D> also claims that the first locomotive cab was constructed in the CVRR shops in Chambersburg in 1841 for a Franklin Railroad locomotive, named "Washington."

==Growth==

In 1839 the CVRR bought three locomotives for $21,250, and two passenger cars for $4,175; and ran two passenger trains and one freight train each day between Chambersburg and Harrisburg.  They boasted that no passenger had been injured in the 2<U+00BD>&nbsp;years that the road had been operated.

[[Frederick Watts]] was elected the third President of the CVRR in 1841 and served in the post for 32 years.  He reported that total annual earnings were $70,116.82 for 1842. By 1849, annual earnings were $101,084.77, and tonnage hauled was reported for the first time, totaling 37,439&nbsp;tons, including 7,818&nbsp;tons of flour, 5,126 of iron ore, 4,247 of coal, 2,123 of grain, and 2,237 of lumber. In that year plans were made to reconstruct the track with heavy iron rails.<ref name="HoFCPI"/>

In March, 1832, the Franklin Railroad was chartered by the Pennsylvania Legislature, and on [[January 16]] [[1837]] by the Legislature of Maryland. The road was built from Chambersburg to [[Greencastle, Pennsylvania]] in 1837, and to Hagerstown, Maryland in 1841. It owned its own steam locomotives, but these were sold about 1841, when the CVRR began operating the road.  Horse power, rather than steam power, was used during the 1840s and 1850s.  Ownership and operating rights changed hands several times, until 1860 when the track was rebuilt with heavy rails and the CVRR contracted to operate the track.  In 1865 the two railroads were merged.

In October, 1862, the Confederate forces destroyed railway buildings in Chambersburg, and on [[June 15]] [[1863]], during the [[Gettysburg campaign]], they destroyed all company property in the town, and tore up five miles of Franklin Railroad.  In July, 1864 Confederate raiders led by [[Jubal Early]] returned and burned the greater part of Chambersburg including most railroad property.<ref name="CVRRmarker1">Cumberland Valley Railroad Historical Marker - Behind the Marker</ref>

During the 1870s feeder lines such as the [[Mont Alto Railroad]] were added in the Cumberland valley to gain access to iron ore deposits. In 1873 the railroad extended south from Hagerstown to the Potomac River.<ref name="HoFCPI"/> In 1889, it reached [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]] and [[Winchester, Virginia]], at the head of the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. 

In June, 1882, the [[Shenandoah Valley Railroad (N&W)|Shenandoah Valley Railroad]] was opened from Hagerstown to [[Roanoke, Virginia]]. In conjunction with the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] the CVRR operated the middle link of the New York-Harrisburg-Hagerstown-Roanoke, Va. passenger trains.  Trains reportedly traveled at over 90&nbsp;mph on parts of this route.

== Demise ==

Regular passenger train service on the CVRR ended in 1952, the last New York-Roanoke train ran in 1961. The PRR's successor, the [[Penn Central]], closed all railway facilities in Chambersburg in 1972 and its successor, [[Conrail]], abandoned major pieces of the line in 1976.
