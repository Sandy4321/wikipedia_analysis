Prince {{nihongo|'''Arimoto Yamagata'''|<U+5C71><U+770C> <U+6709><U+670B>| Yamagata Aritomo }} ([[14 June]] [[1838]]<U+2013>[[1 February]] [[1922]]) was a [[Field Marshal (Japan)|field marshal]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and twice [[Prime Minister of Japan]]. He is considered on of the architects of the military and political foundations of [[Meiji era]] Japan.

==Early Career==

Yamagata was born in a lower-ranked ''[[samurai]]''  family from [[Hagi]], the capital of the feudal domain of [[Choshu]] (present-day [[Yamaguchi prefecture]]. He went to [[Shokasonjuku]], a private school run by [[Yoshida Shoin]], where he devoted his energies to the growing underground movement to overthrow the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. He was a commander of [[Kihei-tai]], a paramilitary organization created on semi-western lines by the Choshu domain and during the [[Boshin War]] he was appointed a staff officer.

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], he was selected together with [[Saigo Tsugumichi]] to visit Europe in [[1869]] under government orders to research European military systems. Yamagata was strongly influenced by [[Prussia]]n military and political ideas, which favored military expansion abroad and authoritarian government at home. He became [[Ministry of War of Japan|War Minister]] in 1873. Yamagata energetically modernized the fledgling [[Imperial Japanese Army]], which he modeled after the Prussian army, and began a system of [[conscription]] in 1873.

==Military Career==

As War Minister, Yamagata pushed through the foundation of the [[Supreme War Council (Japan)|General Staff Office]], which was the main source of Yamagata's political power and that of other military officers through the end of [[World War II]]. He was Commander of the General Staff Office in 1874-76, 1878-82, and 1884-85.

Yamagata led the newly modernized Imperial Army against the [[Satsuma Rebellion]] led by [[Saigo Takamori]] in [[1877]]. 

He also had [[Emperor Meiji of Japan|Emperor Meiji]] write the ''[[Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors]]'', in 1882. This document was considered the moral core of the [[Japanese military]] until its end in [[1945]].

Yamagata was awarded the rank of [[field marshal]] in 1898. He showed his leadership on military issues as acting [[[Ministry of War of Japan|War Minister]] and Commanding General during the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] as the Supreme Commander of the First Army [[Russo-Japanese War]] as the Chief Officer of the General Staff Office in Tokyo.

He is considered political and military ideological ancestor of the [[Strike North Group]] as he traced the first lines of a national defensive strategy against [[Russia]] after [[Russo-Japanese War]].

== Political Career==

During his long and versatile career, Yamagata held numerous important governmental posts. In 1882, he became president of the Board of Legislation (Sanjiin) and as Home Minister (1883<U+2013>87) he worked vigorously to suppress political parties and repress agitation in the labor and agrarian movements. He also organized a system of local administration, based on a prefecture-county-city structure which is still in use in Japan today. In [[1883]] he was appointed to the post of [[Lord Chancellor]], the highest bureaucratic position in the government system before the [[Meiji Constitution]] of 1889. 

He was the first [[Prime Minister of Japan]] after the opening of the [[Imperial Diet]] under the [[Meiji Constitution]] from [[24 December]] [[1889]] to [[6 May]] [[1891]].  During his first term, the ''[[Imperial Rescript on Education]]'' was issued.

He became Prime Minister for a second term from [[8 November]] [[1898]] to [[19 October]] [[1900]]. In 1900, while in his second term as Prime Minister, he ruled that only an active military officer could serve as War Minister or Navy Minister, a rule that gave the military control over any future cabinet. He also enacted laws preventing political party members from holding key posts in the bureaucracy. 

In 1891 he received the honorific title of ''[[Genro]]'', or official elder statesman. He was President of the [[Privy Council]] from 1893-94 and 1905-22.

In 1896, he led a diplomatic mission to [[Moscow]], which produced the [[Yamagata-Lobanov Agreement]] confirming Japanese and Russian rights in [[Korea]]. 

He was elevated to the nobility, and received the title of ''koshaku'' ([[prince]]) in 1907.

From 1900 to 1909, he opposed [[Ito Hirobumi]], leader of the civilian party, and exercised influence through his prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>, [[Katsura Taro]]. After the death of [[Ito Hirobumi]] in 1909 Yamagata became the most influential politician in Japan and remained so until his death in 1922, although he retired from active participation in politics after the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. However, as president of the [[Privy Council]] from 1909 to 1922, Yamagata remained the power behind the government and dictated the selection of future Prime Ministers until his death.

==Trivia==
* Yamagata was a talented garden designer, and today the gardens he designed are considered masterpieces of Japanese-style gardens. An example is the garden of the villa Murin-an in [[Kyoto]].

* In the [[anime]] ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'', Aritomo Yamagata briefly enters the story to invite [[Himura Kenshin]] to join the army, as Kenshin's combat skills are legendary. Kenshin declines the offer. 

* In [[1906]], Yamagata received the [[Order of Merit]] by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]. His Japanese decorations included the [[Order of the Golden Kite]] (1st class), [[Order of the Rising Sun]] (1st class with Paulownia Blossoms, Grand Cordon) and the [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]].
