Summers is the Charles W. Eliot University Professor at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Kennedy School of Government]].  He is the 1993 recipient of the [[John Bates Clark Medal]] for his work in several fields of economics and was [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] from 1999 to 2001, during the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]].

Summers also served as the 27th [[President of Harvard University]] from 2001 to 2006. Summers resigned as Harvard's president in the wake of a [[no-confidence]] vote by Harvard faculty that resulted in large part from Summers' conflict with [[Cornel West]], financial [[conflict of interest]] questions regarding his relationship with [[Andrei Shleifer]], and a 2005 speech in which he suggested that the under-representation of women in science and engineering could be due to a "different availability of aptitude at the high end," and less to patterns of discrimination and socialization.

Summers has also been criticized for the economic policies he advocated as Treasury Secretary and in later writings.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/23/news/economy/obama_summers/index.htm Obama picks Summers as top economic adviser].

==Family and education==
Summers was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], on November 30, 1954, into a [[Jewish family]], the son of two economists, [[Robert Summers]] and [[Anita Summers]] of ([[Romanian Jews|Romanian-Jewish]] ancestry), who are both professors at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], as well as the nephew of two [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel laureates in economics]]: [[Paul Samuelson]] (sibling of Robert Summers, who, following an older brother's example, changed the family name from Samuelson to Summers) and [[Kenneth Arrow]] (Anita Summers's brother).  He spent most of his childhood in [[Penn Valley, Pennsylvania|Penn Valley]], [[Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia]], where he attended [[Harriton High School]].

At age 16,<ref>Plotz, David.[http://www.slate.com/id/111151/ "Larry Summers: How the Great Brain learned to grin and bear it."], ''Slate'', June 29, 2001.</ref> he entered the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), where he originally intended to study [[physics]] but soon switched to [[economics]] ([[Bachelor of Science|S.B.]], 1975).  He was also an active member of the [[American Parliamentary Debate Association|MIT debating team]].  He attended [[Harvard University]] as a graduate student ([[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], 1982).  In 1983, at age 28, Summers became one of the youngest tenured professors in Harvard's history.  It was also during this time that Summers was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease. He underwent treatment and has remained cancer free. Summers has three children (older twin daughters Ruth and Pamela and son Harry) with his first wife, Victoria Perry.  In December 2005, Summers married English professor [[Elisa New]], who has three daughters (Yael, Orli and Maya) from a previous marriage.  He currently owns two houses, one in [[Washington, D.C.]] and one in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]].

==Career==
===Academic economist===
As a researcher, Summers has made important contributions in many areas of economics, primarily [[public finance]], [[labor economics]], [[financial economics]], and [[macroeconomics]].  Some of Summers' early papers concluded that corporate and [[capital gains tax]]es are an inefficient form of taxation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Cutting the capital gains tax rate, Summers found, could help the economy grow.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Later, while working in the Reagan and Clinton White Houses, Summers was able to [[Lobbying|lobby]] successfully for cuts in both corporate and capital gains taxes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} One of Summers' prominent findings in [[labor economics]] is that [[unemployment insurance]] and welfare payments are a major contributor to unemployment, and therefore should be scaled back.<ref name="Summers">{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Summers

</ref>

Summers has also worked in international economics, economic demography, [[economic history]] and [[development economics]].  His work generally emphasizes the analysis of empirical economic data in order to answer well-defined questions (for example: Does saving respond to after-tax interest rates? Are the returns from stocks and stock portfolios predictable? Are most of those who receive unemployment benefits only transitorily unemployed? etc.) For his work he received the [[John Bates Clark Medal]] in 1993 from the American Economic Association.  In 1987 he was the first social scientist to win the [[Alan T. Waterman Award]] from the [[National Science Foundation]]. Summers is also a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].

===Public official===
Summers was on the staff of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] under President Reagan from 1982-1983. He also served as an economic adviser to the [[Michael Dukakis|Dukakis]] Presidential campaign in 1988.

===Chief Economist at the World Bank===
Summers left Harvard in 1991 and served as [[World Bank Chief Economist|Chief Economist]] for the [[World Bank]] until 1993.

As Chief Economist, Summers stated in a 1991 interview: ''<U+201C>There are no... limits to the carrying capacity of the earth that are likely to bind any time in the foreseeable future.  There isn<U+2019>t a risk of an apocalypse due to global warming or anything else. The idea that we should put limits on growth because of some natural limit, is a profound error and one that, were it ever to prove influential, would have staggering social costs.<U+201D>''  This statement is regarded as highly controversial by [[ecologists]] and other [[sustainability]] scientists.<ref>William Rees.  2006.  "Footprints to Sustainability".  University of British Columbia.  UBC Reports, Vol. 52 No. 4 Apr. 6, 2006.</ref>

===="Dirty Industries" controversy ====
{{See|Summers memo}}
In December 1991, while at the World Bank, Summers signed a [[Summers memo|memo]] that was leaked to the press. [[Lant Pritchett]] has claimed authorship of the private memo, which both he and Summers say was intended as sarcasm. The memo stated that "the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that . . . I've always thought that under-populated countries in Africa are vastly underpolluted."<ref>Office Memorandum from Lawrence M. Summers, Subject: GEP, the World Bank/IMFMIGA, 12 Dec 1991.  This was an internal memo at the World Bank not intended for the public that highlighted the economic logic of dumping waste in less-developed countries.</ref>

===Service in the Clinton Administration===
In 1993 Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs and later in the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] under the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor [[Robert Rubin]]. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]].

Much of Summers's tenure at the Treasury Department was focused on international economic issues. He was deeply involved in the Clinton administration's effort to bail out Mexico and Russia when those nations had currency crises.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/13/business/a-new-economic-team-the-nominee-the-administration-s-fiscal-closer.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all A New Economic Team: The Nominee; The Administration's Fiscal Closer].

Summers hailed the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] in 1999, which lifted more than six decades of restrictions against banks offering  [[commercial banking]], [[insurance]], and [[investment]] services (by repealing key provisions in the 1933 [[Glass-Steagall Act]]): "Today Congress voted to update the rules that have governed financial services since the [[Great Depression]] and replace them with a system for the 21st century," Summers said.<ref name="NYTrepeal">{{cite news|work=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/05/business/congress-passes-wide-ranging-bill-easing-bank-laws.html|title=Congress Passes Wide Ranging Law Repealing Bank laws|date=November 5, 1999|accessdate=March 25, 2009|first=Stephen|last=Labaton}}</ref> "This historic legislation will better enable American companies to compete in the new economy."<ref name="NYTrepeal"/> Many critics, including [[POTUS|President]] [[Barack Obama]], have suggested the [[2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis]] was caused by the partial repeal of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act.<ref name="WSJquestions">{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123665023774979341.html|title=Ten Questions for Those Fixing the Financial Mess|work=Wall Street Journal|date=March 10, 2009|accessdate=March 26, 2009 | first=Damian | last=Paletta}}</ref>  Indeed, as a member of President Clinton's [[Working Group on Financial Markets]], Summers, along with U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) Chairman [[Arthur Levitt]], Fed Chairman Greenspan, and Secretary Rubin, torpedoed an effort to regulate the derivatives that many blame for bringing the financial market down in Fall 2008.<ref name="Frontline">{{cite news|work=Frontline/PBS|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/warning/view/#morelink|title=the warning|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate=October 26, 2009}}</ref>

====Summers' role in the deregulation of derivatives contracts====

On May 7, 1998, the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) issued a Concept Release soliciting input from regulators, academics,
and practitioners to determine "how best to maintain adequate regulatory safeguards without
impairing the ability of the OTC ([[Over-the-counter (finance)|Over-the-counter]]) derivatives market to grow and the ability of U.S. entities
to remain competitive in the global financial marketplace."

On July 30, 1998, then-Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Summers testified before congress
that "the parties to these kinds of contract are largely sophisticated financial institutions
that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves from fraud and counterparty
insolvencies."  Summers, like Greenspan and Rubin who also opposed the concept release, offered
no proof that the contracts would not be misused by financial institutions.  Instead,
Summers stated that "to date there has been no clear evidence of a need for additional
regulation of the institutional OTC derivatives market, and we would submit that proponents
of such regulation must bear the burden of demonstrating that need."

This argument suggests that the default position in the disagreement was that Summers,
Greenspan, and Rubin were right, and that anyone (i.e., Brooksley Born) who disagreed
with them bore the burden of proving their position.  In fact, subsequent events have
proven that Summers, Rubin, and Greenspan misjudged the dangers posed by derivatives
contracts.

The lack of regulation that allowed A.I.G. to sell hundreds of billions of dollars in
credit default swaps on mortgage-backed securities was a direct result of efforts by
the Treasury (first under Rubin and then under Summers), the Federal Reserve (under
Greenspan), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (under Arthur Levitt) to
deregulate the derivatives markets.  The first response to the CFTC Concept Release
was issued as a joint statement from Rubin, Greenspan, and Levitt who stated that
they "have grave concerns about this action and its possible consequences."

Levitt and Greenspan have admitted that their views on this issue were mistaken.
Levitt told WGBH in Boston that "I could have done much better. I could have made
a difference."  Greenspan told a congressional hearing that "I found a flaw ... in
the model that I perceived is the critical functioning structure that defines how
the world works."

When George Stephanopoulos asked Summers about the financial crisis in an ABC
interview on March 15, 2009, Summers replied that "there are a lot of terrible things
that have happened in the last eighteen months, but what<U+2019>s happened at A.I.G. ...
the way it was not regulated, the way no one was watching ... is outrageous."

At the 2005 Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole, Raghuram Rajan presented a
paper called "Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier?"  Rajan pointed to
a number of potential problems with the financial developments of the past thirty
years.

  | accessdate = }}</ref>
The problems that Rajan considers include skewed incentives of managers, herding
behavior among traders, investment bankers, and hedge fund operators who suffer
withdrawals if they under-perform the market.  Rajan also discusses (on pp.&nbsp;337<U+2013>40)
the problems associated with firms that "goose up returns" by taking risky positions
that yield a "positive carry."  This is how the infamous Joseph J. Cassano impressed
his superiors at A.I.G. for a decade while sowing the destruction of the firm.

During the boom years of the housing market, the credit default swap contracts
that A.I.G. Financial Products sold provided a stream of premium payments to
the company with no expense stream.  That's an example of what Rajan calls
"goosing up returns" with latent risk.  Rajan asks (on page 388) "If firms
today implicitly are selling various kinds of default insurance to goose up
returns, what happens if catastrophe strikes?"  This is a fair question.

The flip side of the trade is equally problematic.  Gregory Zuckerman in his
book The Greatest Trade Ever about John Paulson's hedge fund recounts the
difficulties that Paulson and others had holding on to their bets against the
housing market.  Even Paulson, whose timing couldn't have been better, spent
a great deal of his time persuading investors to persist with the bet against
the market.  But month after month, millions of dollars were paid out on the
credit default swap premia.  The investors saw money spent and gone that could
have been used to buy assets with rising prices, or at least held safely with
a positive yield.  As Rajan puts it (p.&nbsp;338), "it takes a very brave investment
manager with infinitely patient investors to fight the trend, even if the trend
is a deviation from fundamental value."

Justin Lahart, writing in the Wall Street Journal in January 2009 about the
response to Rajan's paper at the conference recounts that "former Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, famous among economists for his blistering attacks,
told the audience he found 'the basic, slightly lead-eyed premise of [Mr. Rajan's] paper to be largely misguided.'"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123086154114948151.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Mr. Rajan Was Unpopular (But Prescient) at Greenspan Party | first=Justin | last=Lahart | date=January 2, 2009}}</ref>

In a recent paper (on pages 285-87), Steven Gjerstad and Nobel laureate [[Vernon L. Smith]] describe more fully (1) the contribution of derivatives to the flow of mortgage
funds that supported the housing bubble, (2) the concerns that Brooksley Born had
raised about the dangers inherent in these contracts, (3) Summers' contribution to
their deregulation, and (4) how these contracts precipitated the collapse of the
financial system in 2007 and 2008.

===President of Harvard===
In 2001, when [[George W. Bush]] became [[President of the United States|President]], Summers left the Treasury Department and returned to Harvard as its 27th President, serving from July 2001 until June 2006. He is considered Harvard's first Jewish president, though his predecessor Neil Rudenstine had Jewish ancestry, and received praise from Harvard's Jewish community for his support.<ref>[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=511933 Harvard<U+2019>s First Jewish President]. The Harvard Crimson. March 8, 2006</ref> However, a number of his decisions at Harvard attracted public controversy.

====Cornel West affair====
In an October 2001 meeting, Summers criticized African American Studies department head [[Cornel West]] for allegedly missing three weeks of classes to work on the [[Bill Bradley]] presidential campaign, and complained that West was contributing to [[grade inflation]].  Summers also claimed that West's "rap" album (in fact a spoken word album) was an "embarrassment" to the university. West pushed back strongly against the accusations.<ref>{{ cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/06/06/some_seek_a_scholars_return/ |title=Some seek a scholar's return |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=June 6, 2006 | first1=Marcella | last1=Bombardieri}}</ref> "The hip-hop scared him. It's a [[stereotypes of African Americans|stereotypical]] reaction," he said later.  West, who later called Summers both "uninformed" and "an unprincipled power player" in describing this encounter in his book ''Democracy Matters'' (2004), subsequently returned to [[Princeton University]], where he taught prior to [[Harvard University]].

==== Differences between the sexes ====
{{See also|Women in science}}
In January 2005, at a Conference on Diversifying the Science & Engineering Workforce sponsored by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], Summers sparked controversy with his discussion of why women may have been underrepresented "in tenured positions in science and engineering at top universities and research institutions".

Summers had prefaced his talk, saying he was adopting an "entirely [[Positive science|positive]], rather than [[normative]] approach" and that his remarks were intended to be an "attempt at provocation."<ref name="harvard2005">[http://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html Archive of: Remarks at NBER Conference on Diversifying the Science & Engineering Workforce]. January 14, 2005.</ref>

Summers then began by identifying three hypotheses for the higher proportion of men in high-end science and engineering positions:

# The high-powered job hypothesis
# Different availability of aptitude at the high end
# Different socialization and patterns of discrimination in a search<ref name="harvard2005" />

The second hypothesis - different availability of aptitude at the high end - caused the most controversy.  In his discussion of this hypothesis, Summers said that "even small differences in the standard deviation [between genders] will translate into very large differences in the available pool substantially out [from the mean]".<ref name="harvard2005" />  Summers referenced research that implied differences between the standard deviations of males and females in the top 5% of twelfth graders under various tests.  He then went on to argue that, if this research were to be accepted, then "whatever the set of attributes... that are precisely defined to correlate with being an aeronautical engineer at MIT or being a chemist at Berkeley... are probably different in their standard deviations as well".<ref name="harvard2005" />

Summers then concluded his discussion of the three hypotheses by saying:  <blockquote>So my best guess, to provoke you, of what's behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon, by far, is the general clash between people's legitimate family desires and employers' current desire for high power and high intensity, that in the special case of science and engineering, there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude, and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination. I would like nothing better than to be proved wrong, because I would like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are, and working very hard to address them.<ref name="harvard2005" /></blockquote> Summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in high-end science and engineering positions.

This lunch-time talk drew accusations of sexism and careless scholarship, and an intense negative response followed, both nationally and at Harvard.<ref name="Globe20050117">[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/01/17/summers_remarks_on_women_draw_fire/ Summers' Remarks on Women Draw Fire].

[http://www.slate.com/id/2112570/ "Don't Worry Your Pretty Little Head"], ''Slate'', January 21, 2005.</ref>  Nevertheless, the controversy is speculated to have contributed to his resigning his position as president of Harvard University the following year, as well as costing Summers the job of [[Treasury Secretary]] in [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama's administration]].<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/summersrsquo-lsquosexismrsquo-costs-him-top-treasury-job-1033373.html Summers' 'sexism' costs him top Treasury job]. [[The Independent]]. November 24, 2008</ref>

====Summers' opposition and support at Harvard====
On March 15, 2005, members of the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]], which instructs graduate students in [[Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences|GSAS]] and undergraduates in [[Harvard College]], passed 218&ndash;185 a motion of "lack of confidence" in the leadership of Summers, with 18 abstentions. A second motion that offered a milder censure of the president passed 253 to 137, also with 18 abstentions.

The members of the [[Harvard Corporation]], the University's highest governing body, are in charge of the selection of the president and issued statements strongly supporting Summers.

FAS faculty were not unanimous in their comments on Summers. Influential psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] defended the legitimacy of Summers' January lecture. When asked if Summers' talk was "within the pale of legitimate academic discourse," Pinker responded "Good grief, shouldn<U+2019>t everything be within the pale of legitimate academic discourse, as long as it is presented with some degree of rigor? That<U+2019>s the difference between a university and a [[madrassa]]. There is certainly enough evidence for the hypothesis to be taken seriously."<ref>[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=505366 Psychoanalysis Q-and-A: Steven Pinker]. [[The Harvard Crimson]]. January 19, 2005</ref>

Summers had stronger support among Harvard College students than among the college faculty. One poll by the Harvard Crimson indicated that students opposed his resignation by a three-to-one margin, with 57% of responding students opposing his resignation and 19% supporting it.<ref>[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=511421 Poll: Students Say Summers Should Stay]. The Harvard Crimson. February 20, 2006</ref>

In July 2005, the only [[African-American]] board member of Harvard Corporation, Conrad K. Harper, resigned saying he was angered both by the university president's comments about women and by Summers being given a salary increase. The resignation letter to the president said, "I could not and cannot support a raise in your salary, ... I believe that Harvard's best interests require your resignation."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/29/education/29harvard.html A Harvard Governor, Dissatisfied, Resigns] July 29, 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/02/education/02htext.html Board Member's Letter of Resignation]. The New York Times. August 2, 2005</ref>

====Support of economist Andrei Shleifer====

Harvard and [[Andrei Shleifer]], a close friend and protege of Summers, controversially paid $28.5 million to settle a [[lawsuit]] by the U.S. government over the [[conflict of interest]] Shleifer had while advising [[Russia's privatisation program]].  The US government had sued Shleifer under the [[False Claims Act]], as he bought [[Russia]]n stocks and while designing the country's [[privatisation]].  In 2004, a federal judge ruled that while Harvard had violated the contract, Shleifer and his associate alone were liable for [[treble damages]].

In June 2005, Harvard and Shleifer announced that they had reached a tentative settlement with the US government. In August, Harvard, Shleifer and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] reached an agreement under which the university paid $26.5 million to settle the five-year-old lawsuit. Shleifer was also responsible for paying $2 million dollars worth of damages.

Because Harvard paid almost all of the damages and allowed Shleifer to retain his faculty position, the settlement provoked allegations of favoritism on Summers.  His continued support for Shleifer strengthened Summers' unpopularity with other professors:

"I<U+2019>ve been a member of this Faculty for over 45 years, and I am no longer easily shocked," is how Frederick H. Abernathy, the McKay professor of mechanical engineering, began his biting comments about the Shleifer case at Tuesday<U+2019>s fiery Faculty meeting. But, Abernathy continued, "I was deeply shocked and disappointed by the actions of this University" in the Shleifer affair.

In an 18,000-word article in ''[[Institutional Investor (magazine)|Institutional Investor]]'' (January 2006), the magazine detailed Shleifer<U+2019>s alleged efforts to use his [[Insider|inside knowledge]] of and sway over the Russian economy in order to make lucrative personal investments, all while leading a Harvard group, advising the Russian government, that was under contract with the U.S. The article suggests that Summers shielded his fellow economist from disciplinary action by the University.<ref>[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=511201 <U+2018>Tawdry Shleifer Affair<U+2019> Stokes Faculty Anger Toward Summers]. The Harvard Crimson. February 10, 2006</ref>  Summers' friendship with Shleifer was well known by the Corporation when it selected him to succeed Rudenstine and Summers recused himself from all proceedings with Shleifer, whose case was actually handled by an independent committee led by [[Derek Bok]].

====Losses on financial derivatives====
During Summers' presidency at Harvard, the University entered into a series totalling US$3.52 billion of [[interest rate swaps]], [[financial derivatives]] that can be used for either [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] or [[speculation]].<ref>{{cite news  | last = Quint | first = Michael | coauthors = Gillian Wee | title = Harvard Losing AAA Benefit in Market Shows Swap Risk | work = Bloomberg.com | date = 2009-03-03 | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601009&sid=aq3zn49Q9Zww | accessdate = 2009-07-24}}</ref>  Summers approved the decision to enter into the swap contracts as president of the university and as a member of Harvard Corp., "the university<U+2019>s seven-member ruling body" which bears "the school<U+2019>s ultimate fiduciary responsibility."<ref name="mcdonald">{{Cite news | last=McDonald | first=Michael | last2=Lauerman | first2=John | last3=Wee | first3=Gillian | date=2009-12-18 | title=Harvard Swaps Are So Toxic Even Summers Won<U+2019>t Explain  | periodical=Bloomberg.com | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aaZGpGgHsVGw | accessdate=2010-01-18 | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>  By late 2008, those positions had lost approximately $1 billion in value, a setback which forced Harvard to borrow significant sums in distressed market conditions to meet [[margin call]]s on the swaps.<ref>{{cite news | last = Munk | first = Nina | title = Rich Harvard, Poor Harvard | work = Vanity Fair | publisher = Conde Nast | date = 2009-08 | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/08/harvard200908 | accessdate = 2009-07-24}}</ref>  In the end Harvard paid $497.6 million in termination fees to investment banks and has agreed to pay another $425 million over 30<U+2013>40 years.<ref name="mcdonald"/>  The decision to enter into the swap positions has been attributed to Summers and has been termed a "massive interest-rate gamble" that ended badly.<ref>{{cite news | last = Salmon | first = Felix | title = Larry Summers<U+2019>s billion-dollar Harvard gamble | work = Reuters.com | date = 2009-07-24 | url = http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2009/07/24/larry-summerss-billion-dollar-harvard-gamble/ | accessdate = 2009-07-24}}</ref>

====Resignation as Harvard President====
On February 21, 2006, Summers announced his intention to step down at the end of the school year effective June 30, 2006. Harvard agreed to provide Summers on his resignation with a one-year paid [[sabbatical]] leave, subsidized a $1 million outstanding loan to the university for his personal residence, and provided other payments.<ref>President and Fellows of Harvard College, [[IRS]] Form 990, 2006 & 2007.</ref> Former University President [[Derek Bok]] acted as Interim President while the University conducted a search for a replacement which ended with the naming of [[Drew Gilpin Faust]] on February 11, 2007. After a one year sabbatical, Summers subsequently accepted the University's invitation to serve as the Charles W. Eliot University Professor, one of twenty select University-wide professorships, with offices in the Kennedy School of Government and the Harvard Business School.<ref>{{cite news | last=Schuker | first=Daniel J.

===Post-Harvard career===

[[File:Barack Obama in oval office with staff.jpg|right|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]], on left, discusses with a group in the White House, including Larry Summers on far right (back to camera)]]
On October 19, 2006, he became a part-time managing director of the investment and technology development firm [[D. E. Shaw & Co.]] He drew a large salary from this job.

Upon the death of libertarian economist [[Milton Friedman]], Summers wrote an Op-Ed in ''The New York Times'' entitled "The Great Liberator" arguing that "any honest [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] will admit that we are now all Friedmanites." In it Summers wrote that even though Friedman's contributions to [[monetary policy]] have been highly lauded, his most important contribution may have been "in convincing people of the importance of allowing free markets to operate."<ref>{{cite news

In 2006 he was a member of the Panel of Eminent Persons which reviewed the work of the
[[UNCTAD|United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]].

In February 2009, he quoted [[John Maynard Keynes]], saying "When circumstances change, I change my opinion", reflecting both on the failures of [[Wall Street]] deregulation and his new leadership role in the government bailout.<ref>http://www.newsweek.com/2009/02/20/the-reeducation-of-larry-summers.html</ref>

===National Economic Council===
As director of the White House National Economic Council, he emerged as a key economic decision-maker in the Obama administration, where he attracted both praise and criticism. There had been friction between Summers and former Federal Reserve Chairman [[Paul Volcker]], as Volcker accused Summers of delaying the effort to organize a panel of outside economic advisers, and Summers had cut Volcker out of White House meetings and had not shown interest in collaborating on policy solutions to the economic crisis.<ref>{{cite news

In January 2009, as the [[Obama Administration]] tried to pass an economic stimulus spending bill, Oregon Democratic Representative [[Peter DeFazio]] criticized Summers, saying that he thought that President [[Barack Obama]] is "ill-advised by Larry Summers.

On April 3, 2009 Summers came under renewed criticism after it was disclosed that he was paid millions of dollars the previous year by companies which he now has influence over as a [[public servant]]. He earned $5 million from the [[hedge fund]] D. E. Shaw, and collected $2.7 million in speaking fees from [[Wall Street]] companies that received government [[bailout]] money.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Zeleny |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Financial Industry Paid Millions to Obama Aide |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/04/us/politics/04disclose.html |work= |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 3, 2009 |accessdate=April 4, 2009 }}</ref>

In early April 2010, Joshua Green reported that Summers was frustrated with his position at the NEC and upset that he was not chosen to replace [[Ben Bernanke]] as head of the [[Federal Reserve]]. It was considered likely that Summers would soon leave the post.<ref>[http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/04/yes-larry-summers-is-leaving/38555/ Yes, Larry Summers is Leaving]</ref>

On Sept 21, 2010, the White House announced that Summers would step down from his position on the NEC at the end of the year, to return to Harvard University.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704129204575506281087034608.html? Summers to Step Down after Midterm Elections]</ref> In a speech to the [[Economic Policy Institute]] upon leaving his post, Summers "warn[ed] against the creeping cost of government" and "approvingly quot[ed] [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]]'s argument that increased government involvement in the [[health care]] sector is a risky idea."<ref>Scherer. Michael (2010-12-14)

==In popular culture==
The 2010 film ''[[The Social Network]]'', which deals with the founding of the social networking site [[Facebook]], shows Summers (played by [[Douglas Urbanski]]), in his then-capacity as President of Harvard, meeting with [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]] to discuss their accusations against [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. Summers is depicted as dismissive of the twins' concerns and as unable to appreciate the potential value of Facebook.

Larry Summers had a number of references when Barack Obama appeared on ''[[The Daily Show]]''.<ref>Full transcript of Barack Obama on Daily Show (27 October 2010) http://lincmad.blogspot.com/2010/10/full-transcript-of-obama-on-daily-show.html</ref>
