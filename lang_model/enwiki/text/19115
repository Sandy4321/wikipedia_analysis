==History==
The Pike Place Fish Market was purchased in 1965 by John Yokoyama, a former employee of the fish market, who bought the store to make enough money on an owner's salary to afford the car payments on his new [[Buick Riviera]].<ref name="Pike Place Fish Market, ">{{cite web|url=http://www.pikeplacefish.com/beginnings2.html|title=Our Humble Beginnings|publisher=Pike Place Fish Market|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> Initially, Pike Place Fish Market was unknown outside of the Seattle area, but Yokoyama and his staff decided to change that in a meeting with a business coach in 1986.<ref name="National Recreation and Park Association September 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-20050789_ITM|title=Caution: flying fish ahead: the 2006 general session promises insights, smiles and scales.|publisher=National Recreation and Park Association|year=2006|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> Prior to the meeting, the Pike Place Fish Market was near to [[bankruptcy]], and the consultant, Jim Bergquist, was helping them to conceive of ways to save the business.<ref name="National Recreation and Park Association September 2006" /> A fish market employee at the meeting suggested that they not only save the business, but make it "world famous", with the ideas for the business' flying and thrown fish, games with customers, and staff attitudes of always enjoying their work, so that customers would as well.<ref name="National Recreation and Park Association September 2006" /> In an interview, Yokoyama stated, "We took a stand that we were going to become world famous. We just said it and it became so."<ref name="New Brunswick Business Journal May 2008" /> 

Four years later, in 1990, the [[Goodwill Games]] were held in Seattle. News crews at the Pike Place Market discovered the fish market and its performances with customers, and they filmed them. Soon afterwards, the fish market appeared on ''[[Good Morning America]]'', leading to the business and its employees being filmed by various film crews, and being featured in numerous magazines. Now, during the summer tourist season, the fishmongers will perform now in front of as many as 10,000 visitors daily.<ref name="National Recreation and Park Association September 2006" /> The success of the business has been cited to its human resources and employee attitudes.<ref name="New Brunswick Business Journal May 2008" /> The employees of the fish market will often speak to businesses, civic groups, and schools on ways to be successful, and has led to their being featured in motivational books.<ref name="National Recreation and Park Association September 2006" /><ref name="Sunset Publishing Corp.

The Pike Place Fish Market is known for their habit of hurling customers' orders across the shopping area. A typical routine will involve a customer ordering a fish, with their fishmongers in orange rubber overalls and boots calling out the order, which is loudly shouted back by all the other staff, at which point the original fishmonger will throw the customer's fish behind the counter for wrapping.<ref name="Alaska Journal of Commerce November 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28363316_ITM|title=Good times means good business at Pike Place|publisher=Alaska Journal of Commerce|year=2006|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref><ref name="Philadelphia Inquirer August 2000" /> Initially, the shouted repeating of the ordered fish began as a prank on one employee, but was enjoyed by customers, so it became a tradition.<ref name="Philadelphia Inquirer August 2000" /> While working, the staff continually yell to each other and chant in unison while they throw ordered fish.<ref name="The Age March 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/travel/seattle-highlights/2006/03/18/1142582574465.html|title=Seattle highlights|publisher=The Age|year=2006|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> At times, the fish market staff will select a customer from the crowds, hurling fish at them, which the customer rarely can catch.<ref name="Financial Times Ltd.
