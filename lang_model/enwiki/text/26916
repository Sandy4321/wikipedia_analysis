This '''list of notable Eagle Scouts''' includes men who have earned the highest rank attainable in the [[Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA).  Since it was first awarded in 1912, [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] has been earned by more than one and a half million young men.<ref name="eagle-bsa">{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/factsheets/02-516.html |title=Eagle Scouts |accessdate=2006-11-07 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work=Fact Sheets |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Current requirements include earning a number of [[merit badges]] and demonstration of [[Scout Spirit]], service and leadership. Eagle Scouts are presented with a medal and badge that visibly recognizes the accomplishments of the Scout. Additional recognition can be earned through Eagle Palms, awarded for completing additional tenure, leadership and merit badge requirements.

The [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] (DESA), is a special award, awarded only to [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scouts]], for distinguished service in his profession and to the community for a period of at least twenty-five years after earning the Eagle Scout rank.  Since its introduction in 1969 by the [[National Eagle Scout Association]], the DESA has been awarded to just under 2000 Eagle Scouts.<ref name="desalista">{{cite web | author =  | year =  | url = http://members.cox.net/scouting179/Eagle%20Distinguished.htm | title = Distinguished Eagle Scouts | format = | work = | publisher = Troop & Pack 179 | accessdate = 2006-03-02}}</ref>
