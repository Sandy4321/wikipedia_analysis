'''Wolfgang Wenzel von Haffner''' ([[23 November]] [[1806]] <U+2013> [[11 November]] [[1892]]) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] naval officer and politician.<ref>Unless otherwise noted, the entire article is based on the [http://www.regjeringen.no/en/The-Government/Previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/ministries-and-offices/Offices/norwegian-prime-minister-in-stockholm-18/Wolfgang-Wenzel-Haffner.html?id=463332 Wolfgang Wenzel Haffner biography] at regjeringen.no</ref>

He was born in [[Oslo|Christiania]] in 1806, as the son of Lieutenant Colonel Johan Friedrich Wilhelm Haffner and Sara Vilhelmine, n<U+00E9>e Hagerup. In 1834 he married Louise Claudia le Normand Malthe, born 1806 in Solum, Norway - died 1872 in Kristiania (Oslo).

His career began in [[Royal Norwegian Navy|the navy]]. He became Sub-Lieutenant ([[second lieutenant]] or ''fenrik'') in 1824, and [[Lieutenant]] in 1830. From 1839 to 1848 he had an interlude as a private tutor in [[Norwegian language]] and [[mathematics]] to the three eldest sons of Crown Prince Oscar (named [[Oscar I of Sweden]] since 1844), namely the later [[Charles XV of Sweden]], [[Prince Gustaf, Duke of Uppland]] and the later [[Oscar II of Sweden]] (Charles XV's successor). After this period, Haffner returned to the navy. He was promoted to [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] in 1860.

In 1861 he entered politics. He was appointed head of the [[Norwegian Ministry of the Navy and Postal Affairs|Ministry of the Navy and Postal Affairs]] in December 1861, being the fourth person to hold that position that year. In October 1863 he left to serve as a member of the Council of State Division in [[Stockholm]]. The next year he returned as Minister of the Navy and Postal Affairs, only to return to Stockholm in 1867. He returned one final time to the Ministry of the Navy and Postal Affairs to head it from June 1868 to March 1869.<ref name="nsd">[http://samfunnsveven.no/TT/U21.cfm?Utside=&Uttaksnummer=21&person=18038 Wolfgang Wensel von Haffner born 1806] - Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)</ref> He resigned following pressure from the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]].

In May 1875, July 1875 and 1881 King Oscar II appointed Haffner an acting member of the interim governments in Stockholm. Such interim governments were established when the King travelled abroad.<ref>[http://www.regjeringen.no/en/The-Government/Previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/governments/dissolution-of-the-danish-norwegian-real/governments-1814---1905/norwegian-members-of-the-interim-governm-6.html?id=506812 Norwegian members of the Interim Government 26 May - 5 June 1875 during King Oscar II<U+2019>s travel in Germany.] - Regjeringen.no</ref><ref>[http://www.regjeringen.no/en/The-Government/Previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/governments/dissolution-of-the-danish-norwegian-real/governments-1814---1905/norwegian-members-of-the-interim-governm-5.html?id=506813 Norwegian members of the Interim Government 6 - 21 July 1875 during King Oscar II<U+2019>s travel in Russia] - Regjeringen.no</ref><ref>[http://www.regjeringen.no/en/The-Government/Previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/governments/dissolution-of-the-danish-norwegian-real/governments-1814---1905/norwegian-members-of-the-interim-governm-7.html?id=506824 Norwegian members of the Interim Government 16 - 26 September 1881 During King Oscar II<U+2019>s and Crown Prince Gustaf<U+2019>s travel in Russia] - Regjeringen.no</ref>

On 21 March 1884, when the [[cabinet Selmer]] fell due to the impeachment trial, Haffner was again named a member of the Council of State Division in Stockholm.<ref name="nsd"/> He was also appointed acting [[List of heads of government of Norway#Prime Ministers in Stockholm (1873-1905)|Prime Minister in Stockholm]], as the previous Prime Minister in Stockholm, [[Otto Richard Kierulf]], went down in the Selmer impeachment case. Over Haffner, two people served as acting [[List of heads of government of Norway#Prime Ministers (1873-1905) in Christiania)|Prime Ministers in Kristiania]]: [[Ole Bachke]] from 11 to 29 March<ref>[http://www.regjeringen.no/en/The-Government/Previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/ministries-and-offices/Offices/prime-minister-since-1814/Ole-Andreas-Bachke.html?id=465158 Ole Andreas Bachke biography] at regjeringen.no</ref> and [[Niels Mathias Rye]] from 29 March to 3 April 1884.<ref>[http://www.regjeringen.no/en/The-Government/Previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/ministries-and-offices/Offices/prime-minister-since-1814/Niels-Mathias-Rye.html?id=465159 Niels Mathias Rye biography] at regjeringen.no</ref> On 3 April a new [[cabinet Schweigaard]] was finally constituted, and Haffner was relieved of both his positions. The cabinet Schweigaard lasted only two months, being replaced by the Liberal [[cabinet Sverdrup]] on 26 June.

Haffner died in his birth city in 1892. He was buried at [[V<U+00E5>r Frelsers gravlund]].
