== Transport ==
[[Image:Pensfordviaduct.JPG|thumb|right|Pensford Viaduct]] For centuries Pensford has been an important crossing point on the [[River Chew]]. The modern road bridge was rebuilt in 1968 after flood damage, but the much older (1839-1885) bridge, by the church, survived the flood.<ref>{{cite book | author = Janes, Rowland | year = 2003 | title = Pensford, Publow and Woollard: A Topographical History | publisher = Biografix | id =ISBN 0-9545125-0-2}}</ref>

On the western side of the village is a [[viaduct]] on the disused [[Bristol and North Somerset Railway]], built in [[1873]] which was closed to trains in 1968 after the great flood of Pensford (the River Chew flooded), after which it was deemed unsafe. The last passenger train had been earlier: the 9.25 a.m. from [[Frome]] to Bristol on [[31 October]] [[1959]], and after that there were only goods trains (mainly bringing [[coal]] from [[Radstock]]) and those ceased in 1964 and very occasional excursion trains. The Pensford viaduct is 995 feet long, reaches a maximum height of 95 feet to rail level and consists of sixteen arches. The viaduct is now a Grade II listed building ({{IoEentry|32629|Pensford Viaduct at Images of England}})
