==Career==
Pharoah has been performing stand-up comedy in community theaters and at comedy clubs in Virginia since he was 15.<ref>Sources conflict on when he started standup. The [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/reliable-source/2010/09/this_just_in_saturday_night_li.html ''Washington Post''] source indicates he started at 15.</ref> He at one point toured with [[Corey Holcomb]] and [[Charlie Murphy]].<ref name=WashingtonPost/> He became known for his many celebrity impressions,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcuniversal.presscentre.com/content/detail.aspx?ReleaseID=1683&NewsAreaId=2 |title=NBC'S 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' PREMIERES SEPTEMBER 25 WITH SNL ALUM AMY POEHLER & CHART-TOPPING MUSICAL GUEST KATY PERRY |publisher=Nbcuniversal.presscentre.com |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref> including [[Barack Obama]], [[Will Smith]], [[Jay-Z]], [[50 Cent]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Charlie Murphy]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Kanye West]], [[Stephen A.

Pharoah became an internet phenomenon when his impersonation of [[Barack Obama]] became widely seen on [[YouTube]]. In early 2010, Pharoah appeared in a series of segments that aired on ''[[106 & Park]]'' in promotion for the [[BET Awards|2010 BET Awards]], where his character had to deliver an important package for television personalities [[Rocsi]] and [[Terrence Jenkins|Terrence J]].<ref name=WashingtonPost/><ref name=FabFour/>

===2010&ndash;present: ''Saturday Night Live''===
In 2010, Pharoah was hired by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as a featured player for the show's 36th season. As of September 2014, he is the second-youngest male member of the cast at age 26 (Aidy Bryant is the youngest female cast member and, coincidentally, was born the same year as Pharoah, and [[Pete Davidson]] is the youngest male member, being born in 1993) and the second youngest black male cast member after [[Eddie Murphy]] (who was only 19 when he was hired in 1980). 

Pharoah debuted on ''Saturday Night Live'' on September 25, 2010 and is regarded by Rob Moynihan of ''[[TV Guide]]'' as the "breakout player" for that season, for his seemingly effortless impersonations of [[Jay-Z]], [[Will Smith]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Lil Wayne]], and [[Denzel Washington]].<ref name=WashingtonPost/><ref name=FabFour/> He debuted his ''SNL'' impersonation of Barack Obama in the 38th season premiere on September 15, 2012, replacing [[Fred Armisen]].<ref name=TVGuide>"Inbox".
