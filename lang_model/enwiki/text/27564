The '''history of Earth''' covers approximately [[Age of the Earth|4.6 billion years]] (4,567,000,000 years), from [[Earth]]<U+2019>s formation out of the [[solar nebula]] to the present.  This article presents a broad overview, summarizing the leading, most current scientific theories.

==Origin==
[[Image:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|left|thumb|250px|An artist's impression of [[protoplanetary disk]].]]
{{main|Formation and evolution of the Solar System}}
The Earth formed as part of the birth of the [[Solar System]]: what eventually became the solar system initially existed as a large, rotating cloud of [[dust]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], and [[gas]]. It was composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] produced in the [[Big Bang]], as well as heavier [[chemical element|elements]] ejected by [[supernova]]s. Then, as one theory suggests, about 4.6 billion years ago a nearby [[star]] was destroyed in a [[supernova]] and the explosion sent a [[shock wave]] through the [[solar nebula]], causing it to gain [[angular momentum]]. As the cloud began to accelerate its [[rotation]], [[Gravitation|gravity]] and [[inertia]] flattened it into a [[protoplanetary disk]] oriented perpendicularly to its axis of rotation. Most of the mass concentrated in the middle and began to heat up, but small [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] due to collisions and the angular momentum of other large debris created the means by which [[protoplanet]]s began to form. The infall of material, increase in rotational speed and the crush of gravity created an enormous amount of [[kinetic energy|kinetic heat]] at the center. Its inability to transfer that energy away through any other process at a rate capable of relieving the build-up resulted in the disk's center heating up. Ultimately, [[nuclear fusion]] of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]] began, and eventually, after contraction, a [[T Tauri star]], ignited to create the [[Sun]]. Meanwhile, as gravity caused [[matter]] to condense around the previously perturbed objects outside of the new sun's gravity grasp, dust particles and the rest of the [[protoplanetary disk]] began separating into rings. Successively larger fragments collided with one another and became larger objects, ultimately destined to become protoplanets.<ref>{{cite web

These included one collection approximately 150 million [[kilometer]]s from the center: Earth. The [[solar wind]] of the newly formed  T Tauri star cleared out most of the material in the disk that had not already condensed into larger bodies.

{{main|Moon#Origin and geologic evolution|l1=Origin and geologic evolution|Giant impact hypothesis}}
The origin of the [[Moon]] is still uncertain, although much evidence exists for the giant impact hypothesis. Earth may not have been the only planet forming 150 million kilometers from the Sun. It is hypothesized that another collection occurred 150 million kilometers from both the Sun and the Earth, at their fourth or fifth [[Lagrangian point]]. This planet, named [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], is thought to have been smaller than the current Earth, probably about the size and mass of [[Mars]]. Its orbit may at first have been stable, but destabilized as Earth increased its mass by the accretion of more and more material. Theia swung back and forth relative to Earth until, finally, an estimated 4.533 billion years ago,<ref>{{cite journal

Under the influence of its own gravity, this became a more spherical body: the Moon.<ref>{{cite web

==The Hadean eon==<!-- This section is linked from [[Photosynthesis]] -->
{{main|Hadean}}

[[Image:Volcano q.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Volcanic eruptions would have been common in Earth's early days.]]
The early Earth, during the very early [[Hadean]] eon, was very different from the world known today. There were no oceans and no oxygen in the atmosphere. It was bombarded by planetoids and other material left over from the formation of the solar system. This bombardment, combined with heat from radioactive breakdown, residual heat, and heat from the pressure of contraction, caused the planet at this stage to be fully molten. During the [[iron catastrophe]] heavier elements sank to the center while lighter ones rose to the surface producing the layered [[structure of the Earth]] and also setting up the formation of [[Earth's magnetic field]]. Earth's early atmosphere would have comprised surrounding material from the solar nebula, especially light gases such as [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], but the [[solar wind]] and Earth's own heat would have driven off this atmosphere.

This changed when Earth was about 40% its present radius, and gravitational attraction allowed the retention of an atmosphere which included water.  Temperatures plummeted and the crust of the planet was accumulated on a solid surface, with areas melted by large impacts on the scale of decades to hundreds of years between impacts.  Large impacts would have caused localized melting and partial differentiation, with some lighter elements on the surface or released to the moist atmosphere. <ref name="Alfven1976">{{cite book

{{main|Origin of life}}
The details of the origin of life are unknown, though the broad principles have been established. Two schools of thought regarding the origin of life have been proposed. The first suggests that organic components may have arrived on [[Earth]] from space (see <U+201C>[[Panspermia]]<U+201D>), while the other argues for terrestrial origins. The mechanisms by which life would initially arise are nevertheless held to be similar.<ref name="Scientific-American-panspermia">{{cite journal

There is currently no method of determining which of these models, if any, closely fits the origin of [[life on Earth]]. One of the older theories, and one which has been worked out in some detail, will serve as an example of how this might occur. The high energy from volcanoes, [[lightning]], and [[ultraviolet radiation]] could help drive chemical reactions producing more complex molecules from simple compounds such as [[methane]] and [[ammonia]].<ref name="Fortey-38">{{cite book

Modern life has its replicating material packaged neatly inside a [[cellular membrane]]. It is easier to understand the origin of the cell membrane than the origin of the replicator, since the [[phospholipid]] molecules that make up a cell membrane will often form a [[bilayer]] spontaneously when placed in water.

}}</ref> It is not known whether this process preceded or succeeded the origin of the replicator (or perhaps it ''was'' the replicator). The prevailing theory is that the replicator, perhaps [[RNA]] by this point (the [[RNA world]] hypothesis), along with its replicating apparatus and maybe other biomolecules, had already evolved. Initial [[protocell]]s may have simply burst when they grew too large; the scattered contents may then have recolonized other <U+201C>bubbles.<U+201D> [[Protein]]s that stabilized the membrane, or that later assisted in an orderly division, would have promoted the proliferation of those cell lines. RNA is a likely candidate for an early replicator since it can both store genetic information and [[catalyze]] reactions. At some point [[DNA]] took over the genetic storage role from RNA, and [[protein]]s known as [[enzyme]]s took over the catalysis role, leaving RNA to transfer information and modulate the process.

Photosynthesis used the plentiful [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] as raw materials and, with the energy of sunlight, produced energy-rich organic molecules ([[carbohydrate]]s). 

Moreover, [[oxygen]] was produced as a waste product of photosynthesis. At first it became bound up with [[limestone]], [[iron]], and other minerals.  There is substantial proof of this in iron-oxide rich layers in geological strata that correspond with this time period.  The oceans would have turned to a green color while oxygen was reacting with minerals.  When the reactions stopped, oxygen could finally enter the atmosphere.

This, then, is Earth<U+2019>s third atmosphere. Some of the oxygen was stimulated by incoming ultraviolet radiation to form [[ozone]], which collected in a layer near the upper part of the atmosphere.

Humans no longer had to spend all their time working for survival<U+2014>curiosity and education drove the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. Various disciplines, including [[science]] (in a primitive form), arose. New civilizations sprang up, traded with one another, and engaged in [[war]] for territory and resources: [[empire]]s began to form.

Change has continued at a rapid pace from the mid-[[1940s]] to today.  Technological developments include [[nuclear weapons]], [[computers]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[nanotechnology]].  Economic [[globalization]] spurred by advances in communication and transportation technology has influenced everyday life in many parts of the world. Cultural and institutional forms such as [[democracy]], [[capitalism]], and [[environmentalism]] have increased influence.  Major concerns and problems such as [[disease]], [[war]], [[poverty]], violent [[radicalism]], and more recently, [[global warming]] have risen as the world population increases.

In [[1957]], the [[Soviet Union]] launched [[Sputnik 1|the first artificial satellite]] into orbit and, soon afterward, [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human in space.  [[Neil Armstrong]], an [[United States|American]], was the first to set foot on another astronomical object, the Earth's Moon.  Unmanned probes have been sent to all the major planets in the solar system, with some (such as [[Voyager]]) having already left the solar system.
