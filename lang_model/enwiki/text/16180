==History==
When it was first established in 1924, State Route 218 consisted of the entirety of the current routing of [[Ohio State Route 553|State Route 553]] from [[Ohio State Route 7|State Route 7]] in [[Crown City, Ohio|Crown City]] northwesterly to its junction with State Route 218, and the current alignment of State Route 218 from the State Route 553 intersection northeasterly to its current northern terminus at State Route 7 south of [[Gallipolis, Ohio|Gallipolis]].<ref name="ODOT1923_map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1923|publisher=[[Ohio Department of Transportation]]}}</ref><ref name="ODOT1924_map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1924|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref>  Two years later, the southern end of the highway was re-aligned.  From the its current junction with State Route 553, State Route 218 was routed southwesterly along a previously un-numbered roadway to what is now State Route 218's southern terminus at [[Ohio State Route 217|State Route 217]].<ref name="ODOT1925_map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1925|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref><ref name="ODOT1926_map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1926|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref>
