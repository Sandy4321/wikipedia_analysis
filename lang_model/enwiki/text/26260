[[Image:Translational motion.gif|thumb|right|300px|The [[temperature]] of an ideal [[monatomic]] [[gas]] is a measure related to the average [[kinetic energy]] of its atoms as they move. In this animation, the [[Bohr radius|size]] of [[helium]] atoms relative to their spacing is shown to scale under 1950 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] of pressure. These room-temperature atoms have a certain, average speed (slowed down here two '''[[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]]''' fold).]]
'''Kinetic theory''' (or the '''kinetic''' or '''kinetic-molecular theory of gases''') is the theory that [[gas]]es are made up of a large number of small particles ([[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s), all of which are in constant, [[randomness|random]] [[motion (physics)|motion]].  The rapidly moving particles constantly collide with each other and with the walls of the container.  Kinetic theory explains [[macroscopic]] properties of gases, such as pressure, temperature, or volume, by considering their molecular composition and motion.  Essentially, the theory posits that pressure is due not to static repulsion between molecules, as was [[Isaac Newton]]'s conjecture, but due to [[collision]]s between molecules moving at different velocities.

While the particles making up a gas are too small to be visible, the jittering motion of pollen grains or dust particles which can be seen under a microscope, known as [[Brownian motion]], results directly from collisions between the particle and air molecules.  This experimental evidence for kinetic theory, pointed out by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905, is generally seen as having confirmed the existence of atoms and molecules.

== Postulates ==
The theory for ideal gases makes the following assumptions:
* The gas consists of very small particles, all with non-zero [[mass]].
* The number of molecules is large such that statistical treatment can be applied.
* These molecules are in constant, [[randomness|random]] motion. The rapidly moving particles constantly collide with the walls of the container.
* The collisions of gas particles with the walls of the container holding them are perfectly elastic.
* The [[interaction]]s among molecules are [[negligible]]. They exert no [[force]]s on one another except during collisions.
* The total [[volume]] of the individual gas molecules added up is negligible compared to the volume of the container. This is equivalent to stating that the average distance separating the gas particles is large compared to their [[dimension|size]].
* The molecules are perfectly spherical in shape, and elastic in nature.
* The average [[kinetic energy]] of the gas particles depends only on the [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] of the [[system]].
* [[Special relativity|Relativistic]] effects are negligible.
* [[Quantum mechanics|Quantum-mechanical]] effects are negligible. This means that the inter-particle distance is much larger than the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]] and the molecules are treated as [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[physical body|objects]].
* The time during collision of molecule with the container's wall is negligible as comparable to the time between successive collisions.
* The equations of motion of the molecules are time-reversible.

More modern developments relax these assumptions and are based on the [[Boltzmann equation]]. These can accurately describe the properties of dense gases, because they include the volume of the molecules. The necessary assumptions are the absence of quantum effects, [[molecular chaos]] and small gradients in bulk properties. Expansions to higher orders in the density are known as [[virial expansions]]. The definitive work is the book by Chapman and Enskog but there have been many modern developments and there is an alternative approach developed by Grad based on moment expansions.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} <!-- Please give the full titles and other relevant information about these books in the form of a reference citation. -->
In the other limit, for extremely rarefied gases, the gradients in bulk properties are not small compared to the mean free paths. This is known as the Knudsen regime and expansions can be performed in the [[Knudsen number]].

The kinetic theory has also been extended to include inelastic collisions in [[granular matter]] by Jenkins and others.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

==Factors==
===Pressure===<!-- This section is linked from [[Pressure]] -->

[[Pressure]] is explained by kinetic theory as arising from the force exerted by gas molecules impacting on the walls of the container. Consider a gas of ''N'' molecules, each of mass ''m'', enclosed in a cuboidal container of volume ''V''=''L''<sup>3</sup>. When a gas molecule collides with the wall of the container perpendicular to the ''x'' coordinate axis and bounces off in the opposite direction with the same speed (an [[elastic collision]]), then the [[momentum]] lost by the particle and gained by the wall is:

:<math>\Delta p = p_{i,x} - p_{f,x} = 2 m v_x\,</math>

where ''v<sub>x</sub>'' is the ''x''-component of the initial velocity of the particle.

The particle impacts one specific side wall once every

:<math>\Delta t = \frac{2L}{v_x}</math>

(where ''L'' is the distance between opposite walls).

The [[force]] due to this particle is:

:<math>F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{m v_x^2}{L}</math>

The total force on the wall is

:<math>F = \frac{Nm \overline{v_x^2}}{L}</math>

where the bar denotes an average over the ''N'' particles.
Because of the Pythagorean <math> v^2 = v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2 </math>,
we can rewrite the force as

:<math>F = \frac{Nm\overline{v^2}}{3L}</math>.

This force is exerted on an area ''L''<sup>2</sup>. Therefore the pressure of the gas is

:<math>P = \frac{F}{L^2} = \frac{Nm\overline{v^2}}{3V}</math>

where ''V''=''L''<sup>3</sup> is the volume of the box.
The fraction ''n''=''N''/''V'' is the [[number density]] of the gas (the mass density ''&rho;''=''nm'' is less convenient for theoretical derivations on atomic level). Using ''n'', we can rewrite the pressure as

:<math> P = {2 \over 3} n \frac{m \overline{v^2}}{2}</math>

This is a first non-trivial result of the kinetic theory because it relates pressure, a [[macroscopic]] property, to the average (translational) [[kinetic energy]] per molecule  <math>{1 \over 2} m\overline{v^2}</math>  which is a [[microscopic]] property.

===Temperature and kinetic energy===

From the [[ideal gas law]] 
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%"  |
<math>\displaystyle PV = N k_B T</math>
| style= | (1)
|}
where <math>\displaystyle k_B</math> is the [[Boltzmann constant]],  and <math>\displaystyle T</math> the 
[[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute]] [[temperature]],

and from the above result <math>PV = {Nmv_{rms}^2 \over 3} </math>

we have <math> \displaystyle   N k_B T  =   \frac   {N m v_{rms}^2} {3}</math>

then the temperature <math>\displaystyle T</math> takes the form

:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%"  |
<math>   \displaystyle    T   =   \frac   {m v_{rms}^2}   {3 k_B}</math>
| style= | (2)
|}
which leads to the expression of the kinetic energy of a molecule
:<math>   \displaystyle     \frac {1} {2} mv_{rms}^2 =  \frac {3} {2}  k_B T </math>

The kinetic energy of the system is N time that of a molecule <math> K= \frac {1} {2} N m v_{rms}^2 </math>

The temperature becomes

:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%"  |
<math>   \displaystyle    T   =   \frac   {2}   {3}   \frac   {K}   {N k_B}</math>
| style= | (3)
|}
Eq.(3)<sub>1</sub>
is one important result of the kinetic
theory: 
''The average molecular kinetic energy is proportional to
the absolute temperature''. 

From Eq.(1) and 
Eq.(3)<sub>1</sub>,
we have
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%"  |
<math>
   \displaystyle 
   PV 
   =
   \frac
   {2}
   {3}
   K
</math>
| style= | (4)
|}
Thus, the product of pressure and
volume per [[Mole (unit)|mole]] is proportional to the average
(translational) molecular kinetic energy. 

Eq.(1) and Eq.(4)
are called the "classical results", 
which could also be derived from [[statistical mechanics]]; 
for more details, see
<ref>
[http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29 Configuration integral (statistical mechanics)]
</ref>.

Since there are 
<math>\displaystyle 3N</math>
[[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]
(dofs)
in a monoatomic-gas system with 
<math>\displaystyle N</math>
particles,
the kinetic energy per dof is
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%"  |
<math>
   \displaystyle 
   \frac
   {K}
   {3 N}
   =
   \frac
   {k_B T}
   {2}
</math>
| style= | (5)
|}
In the kinetic energy per dof,
the constant of proportionality of temperature 
is 1/2 times 
[[Boltzmann constant]].  
This result is related
to the [[equipartition theorem]].  

As noted in the article on [[heat capacity]], diatomic
gases should have 7 degrees of freedom, but the lighter gases act
as if they have only 5.

Thus the kinetic energy per kelvin (monatomic [[ideal gas]]) is:
* per mole: 12.47 J
* per molecule: 20.7 yJ = 129 <U+03BC>eV

At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature]] (273.15 K), we get:
* per mole: 3406 J
* per molecule: 5.65 zJ = 35.2 meV

===Number of collisions with wall===
One can calculate the number of atomic or molecular collisions with a wall of a container per unit area per unit time.

Assuming an ideal gas, a derivation<ref>[http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/collsurf/collsurf.html Collisions With a Surface<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> results in an equation for total number of collisions per unit time sike per area:

::<math>A = \frac{1}{4}\frac{N}{V} v_{avg} = \frac{\rho}{4} \sqrt{\frac{8 k T}{\pi m}} \frac{1}{m}. \,</math>

=== RMS speeds of molecules ===

From the kinetic energy formula it can be shown that

:<math>v_{rms}^2 = \frac{3RT}{\mbox{molar mass}}</math>

with ''v'' in m/s, ''T'' in kelvins, and ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]. The molar mass is given as kg/mol. The most probable speed is 81.6% of the rms speed, and the mean speeds 92.1% ([[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution#Distribution of speeds|distribution of speeds]]).

==History==
In 1738 [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published ''Hydrodynamica'', which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases.  In this work, Bernoulli positioned the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as [[heat]] is simply the [[kinetic energy]] of their motion. The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because [[conservation of energy]] had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic. 

Other pioneers of the kinetic theory (which were neglected by their contemporaries) were [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1747),<ref>Lomonosov 1758</ref> [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] (ca. 1780, published 1818),<ref>Le Sage 1780/1818</ref> [[John Herapath]] (1816)<ref>Herapath 1816, 1821</ref> and [[John James Waterston]] (1843),<ref>Waterston 1843</ref> which connected their research with the development of [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]]. In 1856 [[August Kr<U+00F6>nig]] (probably after reading a paper of Waterston) created a simple gas-kinetic model, which only considered the translational motion of the particles. <ref>Kr<U+00F6>nig 1856</ref>

In 1857 [[Rudolf Clausius]], according to his own words independently of Kr<U+00F6>nig, developed a similar, but much more sophisticated version of the theory which included translational and contrary to Kr<U+00F6>nig also rotational and vibrational molecular motions. In this same work he introduced the concept of [[mean free path]] of a particle.
<ref>Clausius 1857</ref>
In 1859, after reading a paper by Clausius, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] formulated the [[Maxwell distribution]] of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range.  This was the first-ever statistical law in physics.<ref>Mahon 2003</ref> In his 1873 thirteen page article 'Molecules', Maxwell states: <U+201C>we are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called [[pressure]] of air and other gases.<U+201D><ref>Maxwell 1875</ref>
In 1871, [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] generalized Maxwell's achievement and formulated the [[Maxwell<U+2013>Boltzmann distribution]]. Also the [[logarithm]]ic connection between [[entropy]] and [[probability]] was first stated by him. 

In the beginning of twentieth century, however, atoms were considered by many physicists to be purely hypothetical constructs, rather than real objects. An important turning point was [[Albert Einstein]]'s (1905)<ref>Einstein 1905</ref> and [[Marian Smoluchowski]]'s (1906)<ref>Smoluchowski 1906</ref>
papers on [[Brownian motion]], which succeeded in making certain accurate quantitative predictions based on the kinetic theory.
