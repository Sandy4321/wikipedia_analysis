'''''Xerocomus subtomentosus''''', commonly known as '''suede bolete''', '''boring brown bolete''' or '''yellow-cracked bolete''', is a species of [[edible mushroom]] in the family [[Boletaceae]], occurring in forests throughout Eurasia, North America and Australia and forming a [[mycorrhizal]] relationship with a wide range of [[hardwood]] and [[conifer]] trees.

==Taxonomy==
''Xerocomus subtomentosus'' was first described in 1753 by the father of taxonomy [[Carl Linnaeus]] as ''Boletus subtomentosus''. The starting date of fungal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] had been set as January&nbsp;1, 1821, to coincide with the date of the works of the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist [[Elias Magnus Fries]], which meant that the name required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid, as Linnaeus' work preceded this date. It was thus written ''Boletus subtomentosus'' L.:Fr. However, a 1987 revision of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] set the starting date at May&nbsp;1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' seminal work, the ''[[Species Plantarum]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last= Esser K, Lemke PA. |title= The Mycota: A Comprehensive Treatise on Fungi as Experimental Systems for Basic and Applied Research |publisher = Springer|location=Heidelberg, Germany |year=1994|page=81|isbn = 3-540-66493-9}}</ref> Hence the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority. 

French mycologist [[Lucien Qu<U+00E9>let]] had classified a number of ''Boletus'' species in the genus ''Xerocomus'', with ''Xerocomus subtomentosus'' made the [[type species]]. This was disputed with many authorities not recognising the genus, however genetic analysis published in 2013 confirms the distinctness of this species and its close relatives from the core members of ''[[Boletus]]'', namely ''[[Boletus edulis]]'' and relatives. ''Xerocomus subtomentosus'' and relatives form a [[clade]] known informally as the ''xerocomus'' clade within a larger group (informally called anaxoboletus) in the suborder [[Boletineae]]. Other clades within the group include the ''[[Tylopilus]]'', [[Boletus edulis|porcini]] (= ''Boletus'' [[Sensu#Common qualifiers|sensu stricto]]) and ''[[Strobilomyces]]'' clades, as well as two other groups composed of members of various genera including ''Xerocomus'' (the taxa designated as ''Xerocomus'' species in this clade are not ''Xerocomus'' species and require new taxonomic designations) and ''[[Xerocomellus]]''.

Its [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] ''subtomentosus'' is [[Latin]] "finely haired", referring to its cap.<ref name=Nilper>{{cite book | author = Nilson S, Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill-Fungi) | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063005-8|page=106}}</ref> Mushroom author David Arora nicknamed the mushroom the ''boring brown bolete'' from its lack of taste and appeal.<ref name="arora86">{{cite book |last=[[David Arora|Arora]] |first=David |year=1986|title=Mushrooms demystified: a comprehensive guide to the fleshy fungi |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, California |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4| pages=517<U+2013>18}}</ref> Other vernacular names include Yellow-cracked, and suede bolete.<ref name="michell"/>

==Description==
The pale olive or tan [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially convex before flattening, and measures {{convert|4|to|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} or sometimes up to {{convert|18|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter with a velvety tan surface. Occasionally the cap slits revealing yellow flesh beneath. The [[pileipellis|skin]] of the cap is very hard to remove. The pores underneath the cap are yellow, and bruise blue or green before fading somewhat. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] lacks a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] and is up to {{convert|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall by {{convert|1|<U+2013>|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide. The [[spore print]] is olive-brown. A drop of [[ammonium hydroxide]] on the cap instantly produces a [[mahogany red]] reaction, which distinguishes it from some other similar species of the genus. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white and has little taste or smell.<ref name=Nilper/><ref name="arora86"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Xerocomus subtomentosus'' occurs in autumn in forests throughout [[Eurasia]], [[North America]] and [[Australia]] and forming a [[mycorrhizal]] relationship with a wide range of [[hardwood]] and [[conifer]] trees.<ref name="arora86"/><ref name=Nilper/> It is associated with the [[bilberry]].<ref name="michell">{{cite book|last=Michell|first=Kate|title=Field Guide to Mushrooms and Other Fungi of Britain and Europe|publisher=New Holland Publishers|year=2006|pages=34|isbn=1-84537-474-6}}</ref>

==Edibility==
''Xerocomus subtomentosus'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]], although not highly regarded. Its mild taste makes it suitable for mixed mushroom dishes.<ref name=Nilper/>
