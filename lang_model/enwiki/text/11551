'''Swiss Bank Corporation''' (SBC) (German: ''Schweizerischer Bankverein'' (SBV), French: ''Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> de Banque Suisse'' (SBS), Italian:''Societ<U+00E0> di Banca Svizzera'') was a large integrated financial services company located in Switzerland. Prior to its merger, the bank was the third largest in Switzerland with over 300 billlion CHF of assets and 11.7 billion CHF of equity.<ref>[http://www.ubs.com/1/ShowMedia/investors/annualreporting/archive?contentId=32746&name=financial98_e.pdf UBS AG 1998 Annual Report]</ref>

Throughout the 1990s, SBC engaged in a large growth initiative, shifting its focus from traditional [[commercial banking]] into [[investment banking]], in an effort to match its larger Swiss rival [[Credit Suisse]].  As part of this strategy, SBC acquired US-based investment bank [[Dillon Read & Co.]] as well as London-based merchant bank [[S.G. Warburg]] in the mid-1990s.  SBC also acquired Chicago-based [[Brinson Partners]] and [[O'Connor & Associates]].  These acquisitions formed the basis for a global investment banking business.

In 1998, SBC merged with [[Union Bank of Switzerland]] in 1998, to form [[UBS]], the the largest bank in Europe and the second largest bank in the world.  The company's logo, which featured three keys, symbolizing "confidence, security, and discretion", was adopted by [[UBS]] after the 1998 merger.  Although the combination of the two banks was billed as a merger of equals, it quickly became evident that from a management perspective, it was SBC that was buying UBS as nearly 80% of the top management positions were filled by legacy Swiss Bank professionals.  Today, what was SBC forms the core of many of UBS's businesses, particularly [[UBS Investment Bank]]. 

==History==
===Origins of Swiss Bank Corporation===
{{double image|left|Basel office of Swiss Bank Corporation (UBS) c.1920.png|200|Basler Bankverein Prospectus (1872).png|129|The [[Basel, Switzerland]], offices of Swiss Bank Corporation c.1920<ref name=bankersmag1920>[http://books.google.com/books?id=zGc9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA470#v=onepage&q&f=false Bankers Magazine] Bradford-Rhodes & Co., 1920</ref>|1872 Basler Bankverein investor prospectus}}

Swiss Bank Corporation traces its history to 1854.  In that year, six private banking firms in [[Basel, Switzerland]], pooled their resources to form the ''Bankverein'', a consortium that acted as an underwriting syndicate for its member banks.<ref name=UBS-FUHistory> [http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/UBS-AG-Company-History.html UBS AG].  Funding Universe, Retrieved August 10, 2010</ref><ref name=UBShist>[http://www.ubs.com/1/e/about/history.html UBS History].  Company website</ref>  Among the original member banks were Bischoff zu St Alban, Ehinger & Cie., J. Merian-Forcart, Passavant & Cie., J. Riggenbach and von Speyr & Cie.<ref name=UBShist />  The establishment of [[Joint stock company|joint-stock]] banks in Switzerland such as Swiss Bank's earliest predecessors (often structured as a [[Swiss Verein]]) was driven by the industrialization of the country and the construction of railroads in the mid-19th century.<ref name=analyticalhist>[http://books.google.com/books?id=794H9xxe-SIC&pg=PA132 Swiss banking: an analytical history]. Palgrave Macmillan, 1998 (p. 132-136)</ref>  

The Basler Bankverein was formally organized in 1872 in Basel, replacing the original Bankverein consortium.  Basler Bankverein was founded with an initial commitment of 30 million CHF, of which 6 million of initial share capital was paid in.  Among the Bankverein's early backers was the [[Bank in Winterthur]], one of the early predecessors of the [[Union Bank of Switzerland]].  The bank experienced initial growing pains after heavy losses in Germany caused the bank to suspend its dividend in favor of a loss reserve.<ref name=UBS-FUHistory />   By 1879, Basler Bankverein has accumulated enough capital to resume dividends, initially at an 8% annual rate and then increasing to 10% in 1880.<ref name=UBShist />  

Basler Bankverein later combined with Z<U+00FC>rcher Bankverein in 1895 to become the Basler & Z<U+00FC>rcher Bankverein.  The next year, Basler Depositenbank and Schweizerische Unionbank were acquired.  After the take-over of the Basler Depositenbank, the bank changes its name to Schweizerischer Bankverein (Swiss Bank).<ref name=UBShist />  The English name of the bank was changed to Swiss Bank Corporation in 1917.<ref name=UBS-FUHistory />

===1900-1939===
[[File:St. Gall office of Swiss Bank Corporation (UBS)c.1920.png|thumb|right|220px|The [[St. Gallen, Switzerland]], offices of Swiss Bank Corporation c.1920<ref name=bankersmag1920 />]]
SBC continued to grow in the early decades of the 20th century, acquiring weaker rivals.  In 1906, SBC purchased Banque d'Espine, Fatio & Cie, establishing a branch in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], for the first time.<ref name=UBShist />  Two years later, in 1908, the bank acquired Fratelli Pasquali, a bank in [[Chiasso, Switzerland]], its first representation in the Italian-speaking portion of the country.  This was followed by the 1909 acquisition of Bank f<U+00FC>r Appenzell (est. 1866) and the 1912 acquisition of Banque d'Escompte et de D<U+00E9>pots.<ref name=UBShist />  

The onset of [[World War I]] put a hold on much of the bank's development.  Although SBC survived the war intact, it suffered the loss of its investments in a number of large industrial companies.<ref name=UBS-FUHistory />  Nevertheless, the bank surpassed 1 billion CHF for the first time at the end of 1918 and grew to 2,000 employees by 1920.<ref name=UBShist />  In 1918, SBC purchased [[M<U+00E9>taux Pr<U+00E9>cieux SA M<U+00E9>talor]] to refine precious metals and produce bank ingots.  the company would be established as a separate subsidiary in 1936 and spun-off in 1998.  The impact of the [[stock market crash of 1929]] and the [[Great Depression]] would be severe, particularly as the Swiss franc suffered major devaluation in 1936.  The bank would see its assets fall from a 1929 peak of 1.6 billion CHF to its 1918 levels of 1 billion CHF by 1936.<ref name=UBShist />  

In 1937, SBC adopted its three keys logo symbolizing confidence, security and discretion.  The logo was designed by a Swiss artist and illustrator, [[Warja Honegger-Lavater]].

===Activities in World War II===
On the eve of [[World War II]], SBC was the recipient of large influxes of foreign funds for safekeeping.  Just prior to the outbreak of World War II, in 1939, Swiss Bank Corporation made the timely decision to open an office in New York City.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F6091EFC3E5A137A93CAAB178CD85F4D8385F9 Swiss Bank of Basle to Open Branch Here; Huge Vaults a Haven for European Capital].  New York Times, July 28, 1939</ref> The office was able to begin operations, located in the [[Equitable Building (Manhattan)|Equitable Building]], just weeks after the outbreak of the war and was intended as a safe place to store assets in case of an invasion.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30716FB3B5E10728DDDAC0994D8415B898FF1D3 Swiss Agency will Open, Bank to Occupy Quarters in the Equitable Building].  New York Times, October 15, 1939</ref>   During the war, the bank's traditional business fell off and the Swiss government became its largest client.<ref name=UBS-FUHistory />  Overall, SBC saw its business grow as a result of its wartime government underwriting business.

Decades after the war, it was demonstrated that Swiss Bank Corporation likely took an active role in trading stolen gold, securities and other assets during World War II.<ref name=swissnazi>[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/world/swiss-were-part-of-nazi-economic-lifeline-historians-find.html Swiss Were Part of Nazi Economic Lifeline, Historians Find].  New York Times, December 2, 2001</ref>  

In 1997, the [[World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks]] (WJC) was launched to retrieve deposits made by victims of Nazi persecution during and prior to World War II.  Negotiations involving SBC's successor [[UBS]], [[Credit Suisse]], the [[World Jewish Congress]] and [[Stuart Eizenstat]], on behalf of the U.S., ultimately resulted in a settlement of $1.25 billion in August 1998 paid by the two large Swiss banks [[UBS]] and [[Credit Suisse]].<ref name=swissnazi /><ref name=nearingwwiipact>[http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/23/world/swiss-banks-and-victims-of-the-nazis-nearing-pact.html Swiss Banks And Victims Of the Nazis Nearing Pact].

New York Times, January 31, 1999</ref>  The settlement, which coincided with UBS's merger with Swiss Bank, together with the bank's embarrassment in the [[Long Term Capital Management]] collapse in 1998 brought a degree of closure to the issue.<ref name=swissrelieved>[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/16/world/swiss-are-relieved-but-sour-over-banks-holocaust-accord.html Swiss Are Relieved, but Sour, Over Banks' Holocaust Accord].

===1945-1990===
Swiss Bank Corporation found itself in relatively strong financial condition at the end of World War II, with 1.8 billion CHF of assets.<ref name=UBShist />    By contrast, the Basler Handelsbank (Commercial Bank of Basel), founded in 1862 and one of the largest banks in Switzerland, was insolvent at the end of the war and was consequently acquired by SBC in 1945.  SBC remained among the Swiss government's leading underwriters of debt in the post-war years.  However, by 1947 SBC was shifting its focus back to its traditional business of lending money principally to private companies as part of the postwar rebuilding of Europe.<ref name=UBS-FUHistory />  Meanwhile, the firm continued its expansion to international markets, particularly the United States where SBC focused primarily on commercial banking for corporate clients.  Within Switzerland, SBC remained a full service bank with a domestic retail banking network and an asset management business.<ref name=eurhandbook>[http://books.google.com/books?id=eXvfNDHpfWwC Handbook on the History of European Banks].  Edward Elgar Publishing, 1994</ref>

[[File:Swiss Bank Board Room (UBS)c.1920.png|thumb|left|220px|The Swiss Bank Corporation board room in [[Basel, Switzerland]]]]

SBC prospered throughout the 1950s and embarked on a period of sustained growth.  The bank, which had entered the 1950s with 31 Branch Offices in Switzerland and three abroad,  more than doubled its assets from the end of the war to 4 billion CHF by the end of the 1950s and doubled assets again by the mid-1960s, exceeding 10 billion CHF in 1965.<ref name=UBShist />  SBC acquired Banque Populaire Valaisanne, [[Sion, Switzerland]], and the Banque Populaire de Sierre.  The firm continued to open new offices in the U.S. in the mid-1960s and it was also at this time that SBC began to expand into Asia and opened representative offices throughout Latin America.  The bank opened a full branch office in Tokyo in 1970.  The bank also made a number of acquisitions to enhance its position in various products.  SBC acquired a controlling interest in Frei, Treig & Cie. in 1968, Warag Bank in 1970 and Bank Prokredit in 1979 (later sold to [[GE Capital]] in 1997).<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/GE+Capital+Services+to+Acquire+Bank+Prokredit+from+Swiss+Bank...-a020099899 GE Capital Services to Acquire Bank Prokredit from Swiss Bank Corporation]. December 23, 1997</ref> All three banks focused on consumer lending.  Similarly, SBC acquired a number of banks in the private banking sector, including Ehinger & Cie. in 1974;  Armand von Ernst & Cie. and Adler & Co. in 1976; and a majority interest in Geneva-based Ferrier Lullin & Cie. in 1978.  The bank continued its consolidation of Swiss banks acquiring Banque Commerciale de Sion in 1978 and in 1979 acquired Handwerkerbank Basle, the Banca Prealpina SA and Bank f<U+00FC>r Hypothekarkredite. <ref name=UBShist />

As its own home market was highly competitive, SBC focused on commercial banking for American and other multinational companies.  Through 1979, SBC was consistently the largest of the three major Swiss Bank by assets, except for short periods in 1962 and 1968 when UBS temporarily moved ahead of SBC.  After 1979, although its balance sheet had grown to 74 billion CHF of assets, the bank would typically rank second to UBS which firmly established itself as the largest Swiss bank in the 1980s.<ref name=eurhandbook />  SBC would retain this position for the next 15 years until [[Credit Suisse]] leapfrogged into the top spot following its 1995 acquisitions of [[Schweizerische Volksbank]] and [[Winterthur Group]].<ref name=UBShist />    

===Aggressive acquisitions (1990-1998)===
[[File:Swiss Bank Tower (623 Fifth Avenue).png|thumb|right|200px|The former Swiss Bank Tower off of [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] in New York City opened in 1990.<ref name="tower" />]]

Swiss Bank began the 1990s as the weakest of the "Big Three" Swiss banks but by the end of 1997 would be the driving force behind the merger with [[Union Bank of Switzerland]].  SBC had been impacted by losses on its real estate investments and a series of minor controversies, despite the bank's historically conservative posture.  Beginning in the 1980s, SBC along with its Swiss peers began to embrace a more aggressive strategy to keep up with competitors in the U.S., Japan, Germany and the U.K.  The bank signaled its new posture in 1990 when it opened its new U.S. headquarters, Swiss Bank Tower, a 29 floor building on 49th Street, adjoining [[Saks Fifth Avenue]].<ref name=tower>[http://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/15/realestate/commercial-property-swiss-bank-tower-building-designed-suit-needs-neighbors.html The Swiss Bank Tower; A Building Designed to Suit Needs and Neighbors].  New York Times, April 15, 1990</ref>

SBC shifted its focus from traditional [[commercial banking]] toward [[investment banking]] with an emphasis on building its trading operations.  To bolster its trading initiative, in 1992, SBC acquired [[O'Connor & Associates]], a Chicago-based options trading firm, with an expertise in  financial derivatives.<ref name=buyocconor>[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/10/business/swiss-bank-buys-o-connor.html Swiss Bank Buys O'Connor].  New York Times, January 10, 1992</ref>  [[O'Connor & Associates|O'Connor]] was founded in 1977 by mathematician Michael Greenbaum and was named for Edmund (Ed) and Williams (Bill) O'Connor.  The O'Connor brothers had made a fortune trading grain on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] and founded a First Options, a [[clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] business.  The O'Connors provided Greenbaum, who had run risk management for First Options, with the capital to start his own firm.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=hj7aCEe_zkgC&pg=PA125 The Predictors: How a Band of Maverick Physicists Used Chaos Theory to Trade Their Way to a Fortune on Wall Street].  Macmillan, 2000</ref>  SBC had established a strategic relationship with [[O'Connor & Associates|O'Connor]], which was the largest [[market maker]] in the financial options exchanges in the U.S., beginning in 1988.  O'Connor had been looking to partner with a larger financial institution<ref>[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.12/struve.html Got Risk?].  Wired, Dec 1999</ref> and in 1989 entered into a currency joint venture with SBC that proved to be the first step towards a sale of O'Connor to SBC.<ref name=oconnor>[http://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/07/business/swiss-bank-in-us-link.html Swiss Bank In U.S. Link].  New York Times, December 7, 1989</ref>    Following the merger, O'Connor was combined with SBC's [[money market]], [[capital market]] and [[currency market]] activities to form a globally integrated capital markets and treasury operation.<ref name=buyocconor />  A number of O'Connor executives were brought into key positions within the bank in an attempt to cultivate a more entrepreneurial culture at SBC.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=AeBKZBf2e44C&pg=PA59 Mergers: leadership, performance and corporate health].

[[File:Brinson Partners.png|left|thumb|225px|SBC acquired [[Gary P. Brinson]]'s [[Brinson Partners]] in 1994 to bolster the bank's U.S. asset management business.]]

In 1994, SBC followed up its acquisition of O'Connor by acquiring Brinson Partners an asset management firm focused on providing access for U.S. institutions to global markets.<ref name=SBC-FUHistory />  Founded by Gary P. Brinson, an innovator in financial management, Brinson Partners had emerged as one of largest managers of pension plans and also managed a series of mutual funds.<ref name=chicagostar>[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/14/business/investing-it-merger-in-switzerland-creates-a-star-in-chicago.html Merger in Switzerland Creates a Star in Chicago].

SBC's next made a major push into investment banking with the acquisition of [[S.G. Warburg  & Co.]] a leading British investment banking firm in 1995 for $1.4 billion.  S.G.

===Merger with Union Bank of Switzerland===

On December 8, 1997, [[Union Bank of Switzerland]] and SBC announced an all stock merger.  At the time of the merger, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation were the second and third largest banks in Switzerland, respectively, both trailing [[Credit Suisse]].<ref name=financiers>[http://books.google.com/books?id=nZv6IMfToX0C&pg=PA295 Finance and Financiers in European History 1880-1960].

The merger, which was billed as a merger of equals, resulted in SBC's shareholders receiving 40% of the bank's common shares and Union Bank's shareholders receiving 60% of the combined company.  SBC's [[Marcel Ospel]] was named chief executive officer while Union Bank's [[Mathis Cabiallavetta]] became chairman of the new bank.<ref name=heftybank />  However, it quickly became evident that from a management perspective, it was SBC that was buying UBS as nearly 80% of the top management positions were filled by legacy Swiss Bank professionals.<ref name=UBS-FUHistory />  Additionally, UBS professionals suffered more headcount reductions, particularly in the investment banking unit where there were heavy cuts in the corporate finance and equities businesses.<ref>Corporate finance staff learn fate.

Euromoney, March 1998</ref>  Prior to the merger, Swiss Bank Corporation had built a global investment banking business, [[Warburg Dillon Read]] through its acquisitions of [[Dillon Read]] in New York and [[S. G. Warburg & Co|S.G. Warburg]] in London.  SBC was generally considered to be further along than UBS in developing its international investment banking business, particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where [[Warburg Dillon Read]] was considered to be the more established platform.<ref name=relies>[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/09/business/international-business-performance-of-new-bank-relies-on-us.html Performance Of New Bank Relies on U.S.]  December 9. 1997</ref><ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1999/b3622243.arc.htm Has UBS Found Its Way out of the Woods?]  BusinessWeek, March 29, 1999</ref>  

After the merger was completed, it was widely speculated that a series of losses suffered by UBS on its [[equity derivative]] positions in late 1997 provided SBC with the leverage it required to consummate the merger.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/four-leave-after-ubs-suffers-big-trading-loss-1295126.html Four leave after UBS suffers big trading loss].

{{main|UBS}}
[[UBS]], the successor of the Union Bank of Switzerland, is among the largest diversified financial institutions in the world.  As of 2010, UBS operated in all of the major financial centers worldwide with offices in over 50 countries and 64,000 employees globally.  

In November 2000, UBS merged with Paine Webber an [[United States|American]] [[stock broker]]age and asset management firm led by chairman and CEO, [[Donald Marron]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407EFD71731F937A15753C1A9669C8B63 PaineWebber Merger Vote].

The bank would grow considerably in the 2000s, building a large investment banking franchise to compete with the major U.S. and European bulge bracket firms.  However, UBS suffered major setbacks in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  UBS suffered among the largest losses of any European bank during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and the bank was required to raise large amounts of outside capital from the [[Government of Singapore Investment Corporation]],<ref name="Robinson">{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Gwen|url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2007/12/11/9539/ubs-turns-to-singapore-state-fund-for-capital/|title=UBS turns to Singapore state fund for capital|publisher=[[FT Alphaville]]|date=2007-12-11|accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref> the Swiss government<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/wirtschaft/aktuell/ubs_generalversammlung_1.1318850.html|title=UBS-Aktion<U+00E4>re stimmen der Finanzspritze zu (Wirtschaft, Aktuell, NZZ Online)|publisher=Nzz.ch|accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref> and through a series of equity offerings in 2008 and 2009.

===Acquisition history===
