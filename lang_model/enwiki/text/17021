'''Kappa Kappa Psi''', National Honorary Band Fraternity ('''<U+039A><U+039A><U+03A8>''', colloquially referred to as '''KKPsi''' or '''KKY''') is a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] for college and university band members. It was founded on November 27, 1919 at [[Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College]] in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]].

Kappa Kappa Psi primarily operates as a recognition society<ref name="CollegeFraternity"/> providing service, leadership opportunities, and social programming for band members. [[Tau Beta Sigma]], National Honorary Band Sorority, has been recognized as a sister organization since 1947, and the two organizations share National Headquarters in Stillwater Station, a converted historical [[Santa Fe Railroad|Santa Fe]] rail depot that was purchased by the fraternity and sorority in 1991.

Since 1919, more than 66,000 men and women have been initiated into Kappa Kappa Psi, with nearly 6,000 collegiate members active today. Members of Kappa Kappa Psi include President [[Bill Clinton]]; [[Neil Armstrong]], the first man to set foot on the moon; chancellor and eleventh president of [[Indiana University]], [[Herman B Wells]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~kkpsi/history/honorary.html |title=Honorary Members of Alpha Zeta |author=Alpha Zeta Chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi |publisher=Alpha Zeta Chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi |accessdate=December 4, 2011 |date=September 26, 2009}}</ref> composer and the "American March King," [[John Philip Sousa]];<ref name="Sousa">{{Cite journal|last1=Golemo |first1=Michael |date=Spring 2005 |title=Kappa Kappa Psi and John Philip Sousa |periodical=PODIUM |publisher=Kappa Kappa Psi/Tau Beta Sigma |location=Stillwater, OK |pages=28<U+2013>9 |url=http://kkytbs.org/podium/PodiumSp2005.pdf |oclc=8172619 }}</ref> conductor [[William Revelli]]; and jazz pianist and bandleader [[Count Basie]].<ref name="LXA">{{Cite journal|last1=Raymond |first1=Michael |year=2007 |month=February |title=Founders of Kappa Kappa Psi |periodical=Cross and Crescent |volume=94 |issue=2 |publisher=Lambda Chi Alpha |location=Indianapolis |pages=10<U+2013>11 |url=http://pdf.crossandcrescent.com/2007/02/cc07feb_print.pdf |issn=1930-1286 |oclc=19902105 }}</ref>

[[File:William Alexander Scroggs.jpg|150px|left|thumb|William Scroggs, 1922]]

The fraternity grew rapidly in its first years. Within ten years, there were twenty-seven chapters<ref name="Bairds">{{cite book |last=Baird |first=William Raimond |authorlink=William Raimond Baird |editor1-first=Harold J |editor1-last=Baily |title=[[Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities]] |edition=15th |year=1949 |publisher=George Banta Publishing |location=Menasha, WI |pages=884<U+2013>5 |chapter=Kappa Kappa Psi (Band<U+2014>Men) |oclc=7435210 }}</ref> spanning from the [[University of Washington]] in the west to [[Duke University]] in the east. Only fourteen were installed during the [[Great Depression]], while [[World War II]] put a further damper on  fraternal activities.<ref name="Bairds"/>

At the 1939 National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, plans were set into action to make Kappa Kappa Psi an international fraternity. Invitations were sent to colleges and universities in Canada and South America, but no chapters were ever installed at those institutions.<ref name="Bairds"/>

=== World War II ===

Before [[World War II]], most college bands were [[Military band|military-style]] and exclusively male. When the war began, most band members left to serve in the armed forces, which greatly strained the fraternity<U+2014>to the point that 90 percent of chapters were forced to suspend activities.<ref name="Justin1">{{Cite journal|last1=Justin |first1=David |date=Spring 2001 |title=Women in the Fraternity |periodical=PODIUM |pages=6<U+2013>8 |publisher=Kappa Kappa Psi/Tau Beta Sigma |location=Stillwater, OK |url=http://podium.kkytbs.org/women-in-the-fraternity-part-1/ |oclc=8172619 }}</ref> The Grand Council granted those chapters that were forced to suspend their activities "war furlough" so that instead of treating the chapter as inactive, their service would be honored. War furlough enabled a chapter to seal its records and keep its materials in safekeeping for the duration of the war. Petitions for war furlough required the signatures of all active members, the director of bands or other faculty member who was an honorary member of the fraternity, as well as the signature of the college or university president.<ref name="WarFurlough">{{Cite journal|year=1943 |month=April |title=Chapters in Line of Duty for Duration |periodical=BATON |publisher=Kappa Kappa Psi |location=Stillwater, OK |url=http://orgs.okstate.edu/kkp/snippet14.html |oclc=56732825 }}</ref> Only five chapters remained active during the war: the Alpha chapter at Oklahoma A&M College, Alpha Beta at [[Butler University]], Alpha Iota at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], Alpha Omicron at [[Texas Tech University|Texas Technological College]], and Alpha Pi at the [[University of Tulsa]].<ref name="Justin1"/> With so many members serving overseas, including members of the Grand Council, the 1943 and 1945 national conventions were canceled.<ref name="Justin1"/><ref name="NatConvs">{{cite book |author=Kappa Kappa Psi |editor1-first=Nick |editor1-last=Smith |title=Guide to Membership for the 2011<U+2013>2013 Biennium |url=http://www.kkytbs.org/forms/KKPsiGuidetoMembership.pdf |format=PDF |year=2011 |publisher=Kappa Kappa Psi/Tau Beta Sigma |location=Stillwater, OK |page=77 |chapter=National Convention Sites}}</ref>

{{quote box|width=35%|align=right|bgcolor=lightblue|quote=''It is my firm conviction that eventually Kappa Kappa Psi, National Honorary Band Fraternity, should be open to both college band men and women.''|source=Max A. Mitchell, Grand Second Vice President, <br />(Letter to A. Frank Martin, Jan. 12, 1944)<ref name="Justin1"/>}}

Because of the number of men serving in the military, many band programs opened up to women during this time. At Texas Tech, a local sorority for women in the band was established as Tau Beta Sigma. The women of Tau Beta Sigma petitioned Kappa Kappa Psi to be chartered as an auxiliary chapter of the fraternity, which was supported by founder A. Frank Martin, who was serving as National Executive Secretary, and Max Mitchell, Grand Second Vice President. On January 25, 1944, Martin wrote to fellow founder, William Scroggs, "If we do not meet this new situation and give recognition to the girls who are coming into the bands or make it possible to give aid or assistance to the many universities and colleges that have bands composed of both boys and girls, we will be playing second fiddle within the next five years to some band fraternity that will grant membership to boys and girls and their chapters will open up in the smaller schools where ours have died."<ref name="Justin1"/> The fraternity was unable to decide whether or not to accept Tau Beta Sigma's petition due to the severely reduced number of members and the cancelation of the 1943 and 1945 national conventions.<ref name="Justin1"/>

Ultimately, Tau Beta Sigma decided not to become an auxiliary chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi and chartered as a national organization on March 26, 1946.<ref name="TBSGtM">{{cite book |author=Tau Beta Sigma |authorlink=Tau Beta Sigma |editor1-first=Nick |editor1-last=Smith |title=Guide to Membership Education |url=http://www.kkytbs.org/forms/TBSGuidetoMembership.pdf |format=PDF |year=2011 |publisher=Kappa Kappa Psi/Tau Beta Sigma |location=Stillwater, OK |pages=44<U+2013>5 |chapter=History of the Sorority}}</ref> They were officially recognized and accepted as a sister organization of the fraternity at the first national convention following the war in 1947.<ref name="Jameson">{{Cite thesis |degree=M.Mus. |title=Kappa Kappa Psi, National Honorary Fraternity for College Bandsmen: Its History, Growth, and Development from 1919 to 1971 |last=Jameson Jr. |first=Joe C. |year=1971 |publisher=Kansas State College of Pittsburg |oclc=29924625 }}</ref>{{rp|27}}

=== Post-war expansion ===

After the war, Kappa Kappa Psi began an ambitious expansion program to reactivate old chapters and install new ones. The fraternity had been divided into eleven districts since 1941, which were led by a Grand Counselor (now called Governors).<ref name="Jameson"/>{{rp|29}} With the revitalization of the fraternity, these districts were reorganized and pamphlets were printed detailing the fraternity's purposes and history.<ref name="Jameson"/>{{rp|47}} District governors were charged with giving information to potential chapters. The expansion program was quite successful<U+2014>in the ten years following the fraternity's reorganization in 1947, Kappa Kappa Psi more than doubled the number of installed chapters, growing from forty-five chapters installed before the war to ninety-eight by the end of 1957.<ref name="ChaptersGtM">{{cite book |author=Kappa Kappa Psi |editor1-first=Nick |editor1-last=Smith |title=Guide to Membership for the 2011<U+2013>2013 Biennium |url=http://www.kkytbs.org/forms/KKPsiGuidetoMembership.pdf |format=PDF |year=2011 |publisher=Kappa Kappa Psi/Tau Beta Sigma |location=Stillwater, OK |pages=93<U+2013>9 |chapter=Directory of Chapters (As of August 2011)}}</ref>

In the early years of the fraternity, part V, 7.02, of the National Constitution read, "All members of the Fraternity shall be of the male sex and of the Caucasian race." At the 1947 national convention in Stillwater, a constitutional amendment was presented and unanimously accepted to modify the wording to say, "All members of the Fraternity shall be of the male sex," removing any racial barrier to membership.<ref name="Jameson"/>{{rp|36}} May 1957 saw the first chapters at [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black universities]]: On May 19, the Delta Alpha chapter at [[Langston University]] was installed; three days later, the Gamma Omega chapter was established at [[Texas Southern University]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Shelton |first=Cynthia Lynne |editor1-first=Gregory S |editor1-last=Parks |title=Black Greek-letter Organizations in the Twenty-First Century: Our Fight Has Just Begun |year=2008 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington |pages=213<U+2013>31 |chapter=Strategic Essentialism and Black Greek Identity in the Postmodern Era |isbn=978-0-8131-2491-9 |oclc=185123480 }}</ref>

On September 1, 1967, the eleven districts were consolidated into nine.<ref name="Jameson"/>{{rp|93}} These districts would again be consolidated in 1987, to six districts with regional names: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, North Central, Midwest, and Western.<ref name="NEDHistory">{{Cite document|last1=Mordente |first1=Rai |last2=Bates |first2=Adam |year=2006 |title=The History of the Northeast District |publisher=Northeast District of Kappa Kappa Psi |url=http://www.kkpsi.org/CFRMaterials/Example%20District%20History.pdf |format=PDF }}</ref>

===Effect of Title IX===

On June 23, 1972, [[Title IX]] was enacted and had tremendous repercussions for the women's rights movement. Title IX prevented organizations from excluding members based on sex. Although social fraternities were exempt from the law, Kappa Kappa Psi, as a recognition society, fell under its purview. [[Rutgers University]]'s board of trustees decided that Rutgers should serve as a model for the rest of the United States in Title IX implementation and mandated that all organizations on campus become coeducational or face disciplinary actions.<ref name="Justin1"/> The men of the Alpha Phi chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi regarded this issue as minor given the ongoing Vietnam War.<ref name="Justin1"/> With dwindling numbers, Alpha Phi looked to the new women members of the Rutgers band as potential members. The national constitution of Kappa Kappa Psi prohibited women from holding membership, so the Alpha Phi chapter explored the possibility of establishing a chapter of Tau Beta Sigma. This was unrealistic, as the undergraduate college for women prohibited the formation of or membership in any sorority.<ref name="Justin1"/>

On October 8, 1972, the men of Alpha Phi voted to admit women into their chapter.<ref name="Justin1"/> They alerted National Headquarters, and National Secretary Robert H. Rubin replied telling Alpha Phi not to administer any degree of ritual until the issue could be discussed in person. When Rubin arrived at Rutgers on November 11, 1972, he learned that the first degree of ritual had been administered, which began formal probationary membership.<ref name="Justin1"/> Alpha Phi's charter was immediately revoked and their chapter was placed on suspension. On November 13, the former Alpha Phi chapter formally reorganized as Mu Upsilon Alpha. On October 7, 2007, Mu Upsilon Alpha became a chapter of [[Mu Beta Psi]].<ref name="MYA">{{cite web |url=http://pi.mubetapsi.org/about.htm |title=About the Pi Chapter |author=Mu Beta Psi |authorlink=Mu Beta Psi |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>

{{quote box|width=40%|align=left|bgcolor=lightblue|quote=''If women are to become a part of Kappa Kappa Psi, let it be done in an orderly manner with open discussion at a Grand Chapter meeting and not in open defiance to the National Constitution.''|source=Richard "Doc" Worthington, Grand President, <br />(Address to Delegation, 1973 National Convention)<ref name="Justin2">{{Cite journal|last1=Justin |first1=David |date=Fall 2001 |title=Women in the Fraternity (Part 2) |periodical=PODIUM |pages=17<U+2013>9 |publisher=Kappa Kappa Psi/Tau Beta Sigma |location=Stillwater, OK |oclc=8172619 |url=http://podium.kkytbs.org/women-in-the-fraternity-part-2/ }}</ref>}}

At the national convention of 1973, the issues presented by Title IX were discussed by the Grand Chapter. The jurisdiction committee considered several options that would bring the fraternity into compliance, but were not receptive of the general idea. At the insistence of committee chair Richard Adler, from the Nu chapter at the [[University of Michigan]], the jurisdiction committee presented the Grand Chapter with an amendment "without prejudice"<U+2014>that is, without recommendation for or against the amendment<U+2014>that would strike the section of the constitution that read, "All members of the Fraternity shall be of the male sex."<ref name="Justin2"/> The committee simultaneously recommended that the delegation take no action to change the constitution or consider a merger with Tau Beta Sigma. The amendment was defeated, and a separate amendment was proposed and approved that changed the wording to say, "All active, alumni, inactive, and life members of the Fraternity be of the male sex." This amendment was approved, allowing the fraternity to initiate women as honorary members.<ref name="Justin2"/>

During the 1973<U+2013>1975 biennium, pressure was put on Kappa Kappa Psi chapters by their host institutions to admit women to comply with Title IX. The issue was again brought up at the 1975 national convention, and a joint committee consisting of an equal number of members from Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma was formed to explore the legal possibilities of a corporate merger of the two organizations, with the results of their investigation to be read at the 1977 convention. At the 1977 national convention, votes were cast by the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma delegations for a merger<U+2014>Kappa Kappa Psi voted 211 against, 9 for; Tau Beta Sigma voted 104 against, 4 for.<ref name="Justin2"/> With the idea of a merger soundly defeated, the delegation voted to remove all references to gender from the constitution, allowing women to become active members in full and regular standing.<ref name="Justin2"/>

The first women to join the fraternity were sisters of the Sigma chapter of Tau Beta Sigma at [[Arizona State University]], who merged with the Beta Omicron chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi after a unanimous vote of both organizations.<ref name="Justin3">{{Cite journal|last1=Justin |first1=David |date=Spring 2002 |title=Women in the Fraternity (Part 3) |periodical=PODIUM |pages=17<U+2013>9 |publisher=Kappa Kappa Psi/Tau Beta Sigma |location=Stillwater, OK |oclc=8172619 |url=http://podium.kkytbs.org/women-in-the-fraternity-part-3/ }}</ref> These women were Patricia A. Childress, Lydia L. Lennon, Leslie A. Anderson, Mary L. Duffala, Mary M. Ketterer, Kristina M. Zipsnis, Clara M. Bertilson, and Toni Ryon, who were initiated into Beta Omicron on August 26, 1977.<ref name="Justin3"/> On August 27, Lea F. Fuller was initiated.<ref name="Justin3"/> The first woman to participate in the formal probationary membership process and become a member of Kappa Kappa Psi was Darragh Hill Young, who was initiated into the Beta Tau chapter at [[Wichita State University]] on September 1, 1977.<ref name="Justin3"/>

===Early 21st century===

Beginning with the installation of the Kappa Pi chapter at [[Claflin University]] on February 24, 2001, fifty-seven new chapters have been installed in the twenty-first century.<ref name="ChapterList"/><ref name="ChaptersGtM"/>

In 2006, Kappa Kappa Psi celebrated its inaugural National Month of Musicianship during the month of November, the month in which the fraternity was founded. The annual month-long event is intended to promote music and university bands. Local chapters celebrate the National Month of Musicianship in various ways, such as creating lab bands for student conductors, organizing reading bands, and hosting master classes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kkpsi.org/news-item.asp?id=40 |title=Celebrate November - National Month of Musicianship |author=Jack Lee |publisher=Kappa Kappa Psi |date=November 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}</ref>

Also in 2008, Kappa Kappa Psi joined other Greek organizations in sponsoring HazingPrevention.Org, a national anti-hazing organization. Dr. Malinda Matney, past National President and current member of the Kappa Kappa Psi Board of Trustees, has served on the HazingPrevention.Org Board of Directors since 2009.<ref>{{Cite document|last=Matney |first=Malinda |title=Curriculum vitae |year=2011 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mmatney/vita.html |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=November 26, 2011 }}</ref>

F. Lee Bowling was elected Grand President of the fraternity in 1941 and presented a plan to hold a national intercollegiate band concert, modeled after the Rocky Mountain intercollegiate bands. The plan was endorsed by the delegation to be executed at the next national convention in 1943. However, due to World War II, the 1943 and 1945 national conventions were not held, and so the first National Intercollegiate Band was formed and gave a concert on the evening of Friday, March 7, 1947.<ref name="NIBGtM"/><ref name="NIBocollegian">{{cite news |last=Poulter |first=Virgil |title=Nation's Musicians Gathering Today In National Meet |url=http://dc.library.okstate.edu/cdm/ref/collection/ocolly1940/id/27721 |newspaper=O'Collegian |publisher=Oklahoma A&M College |location=Stillwater |date=March 6, 1947 |page=1 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref> Today, participation in the National Intercollegiate Band is open to any college band member who auditions<U+2014>membership in Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma is not required.<ref name="NIBweb"/>

==== Stillwater Station ====

The Stillwater Santa Fe Depot is a [[National Register of Historic Places|historic]] building that was originally built in March 1900. In 1915, a brick depot was added. The depot was used as a passenger rail station until 1953.<ref>[[National Register of Historic Places]], Stillwater Santa Fe Depot, Stillwater, [[Payne County, Oklahoma|Payne County]], [[Oklahoma]], National Register #80004293.</ref> The depot was purchased at auction by five Stillwater residents, including three Alpha chapter alumni, in November 1991. Stillwater Station replaced Oklahoma State University's Seretean Center for the Performing Arts as the National Headquarters of the two organizations. The fraternity and sorority share office space, a conference room, and storage space in the converted station, which also hosts the organizations' archives. The brick path leading to the building's entrance has become a "Walk of Fame" with engraved bricks purchased by individuals or chapters.<ref name="StationWeb">{{cite web |url=http://www.kkytbs.org/stillwater.html |title=National Headquarters - Stillwater Station |publisher=Kappa Kappa Psi/Tau Beta Sigma National Headquarters |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref>

=== Local programs and activities ===

The mission statement and five purposes of Kappa Kappa Psi shape the activities of local chapters. Chapters of Kappa Kappa Psi provide service and support to the bands at its hosting institutions, from major projects like undertaking major renovations of rehearsal spaces used by the institution's bands to relatively minor support such as providing apples and water to athletic bands or cleaning practice rooms.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Band Fraternity Takes On Renovation Project |publisher=Marshall University |date=May 30, 2008 |url=http://www.marshall.edu/UComm/RELEASE/2008/pr051608.htm |id=ProQuest 471644406 }}</ref> Some chapters also include general community service in their activities, such as sponsoring blood drives and other activities.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Kappa Kappa Psi Collects Toys, Clothing for New Beginnings |publisher=Northwestern Oklahoma State University |date=December 20, 2007 |url=http://ranger3.nwosu.edu/pubrel/2007-2008/kkptoys.htm |id=ProQuest 469522262 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=Blood Drive Nov. 11 at First Baptist Church |publisher=Jacksonville State University |date=November 10, 2008 |id=ProQuest 470971460 }}</ref>

The fifth purpose of the fraternity charges chapters and members to "provide a pleasant and helpful social experience for all engaged in college band work," and chapters fulfill this charge through social programming such as hosting receptions after band concerts,<ref>{{cite press release |title=Wind Orchestra and Symphonic Band to Perform Nov. 18 |publisher=Indiana State University |date=November 10, 2008 |url=http://www.indstate.edu/news/news-pre2008.php?newsid=1533 |id=ProQuest 470970527 }}</ref> sponsoring dances and socials for band members or their campus community in general,<ref>{{cite press release |title=Valentine's Dinner Dance Planned |publisher=Fairmont State University |date=January 14, 2008 |url=http://www.fairmontstate.edu/fsunow/valentines-dinner-dance-planned |id=ProQuest 468584692 }}</ref> or by hosting concerts and providing food.<ref>{{cite press release |title=SFA Bands to Present Free Outdoor Concert |publisher=Stephen F.

=== Flag ===

[[File:Kappa Kappa Psi flag.svg|160px|thumb|left|alt=Fraternity Flag of Kappa Kappa Psi.]]
The Fraternity Flag was created by G. R. Schaag, a member of the Eta Sigma chapter at the [[University of Central Florida]]. The idea of a national flag was raised with the History and Traditions committee by Schaag at the 1987 national convention, but the committee ultimately decided not to take the idea to the national delegation. Schaag quickly drafted a motion to consider a national flag, which was presented by the chapter's delegate and passed. In 1989, Schaag presented a design for a flag, which won the committee's recommendation over other submissions and was accepted by the national chapter.<ref name="Flag">{{Cite journal|last1=Schaag |first1=G.

On the lower half, three alternating stars of white, blue, and white appear on a blue field, with the top point of the lower white star extending into the white field above it.<ref name="Symbols">{{cite web |url=http://www.kkpsi.org/fraternitysymbols.asp |title=Fraternity Symbols |author=Kappa Kappa Psi |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>
