{{Politics of Singapore}}

The '''Cabinet of Singapore''' forms the [[executive (government)|executive branch]] of [[Singapore]] together with the [[President of Singapore]]. It is led by the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] who is the [[head of government]]. The Prime Minister is a [[Members of the Singapore Parliament|Member of Parliament]] appointed by the President  who selects a person that in his or her view is likely to command the confidence of a majority of the [[Parliament of Singapore]]. The other members of the Cabinet are Ministers who are Members of Parliament appointed by the President on the Prime Minister's advice. Cabinet members are prohibited from holding any [[office of profit]] and from actively engaging in any commercial enterprise.

The Cabinet generally directs and controls the [[Government of Singapore]] and is [[Cabinet collective responsibility|collectively responsible]] to Parliament. It also has significant influence over lawmaking. Ministers may be designated by the Prime Minister to be in charge of particular [[organisation of the Government of Singapore|ministries]], or as Ministers in the [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Prime Minister's Office]].

The earliest predecessor of the Cabinet was the Executive Council of the [[Straits Settlements]], introduced in 1877 to advise the [[list of British Governors of the Straits Settlements|Governor of the Straits Settlements]]. It wielded no executive power. In 1955, a Council of Ministers was created, made up of three ''ex officio'' Official Members and six Elected Members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore]], appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the Leader of the House. Following the general elections that year, [[David Saul Marshall]] became the first [[Chief Minister of Singapore]]. Constitutional talks between Legislative Assembly representatives and the [[Colonial Office]] were held from 1956 to 1958, and Singapore gained full internal self-government in 1959. The Governor was replaced by the [[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]], who had power to appoint to the post of Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice. In the [[Singaporean general election, 1959|1959 general elections]], the [[People's Action Party]] swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and [[Lee Kuan Yew]] became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. The executive branch of the Singapore Government remained unchanged following Singapore's [[Singapore in Malaysia|merger with Malaysia]] in 1963, and subsequent [[history of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|independence]] in 1965.

A Cabinet reshuffle took place effective April 2009. Professor [[S. Jayakumar]] relinquished his post as Deputy Prime Minister, and was replaced by [[Teo Chee Hean]]. [[Gan Kim Yong]] was appointed [[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Minister for Manpower]] after a year as Acting Minister, and [[Lim Hwee Hua]] took up the post of Minister in the [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Prime Minister's Office]], becoming the first woman in Singapore to become a full minister.

==History==
[[File:Williamrobinson.jpg|thumb|Sir [[William Cleaver Francis Robinson]] (1834<U+2013>1897), the [[list of British Governors of the Straits Settlements|Governor of the Straits Settlements]] when the Executive Council of the Straits Settlements was introduced in 1877]]

Up to the outbreak of [[World War II]], [[Singapore]] was part of the [[Crown colony]] known as the [[Straits Settlements]] together with [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]]. The earliest predecessor of the Cabinet was arguably the Executive Council of the Straits Settlements that was introduced in 1877 by [[letters patent]] issued by [[the Crown]],<ref>[[Letters patent]] dated 17 November 1877.</ref> though its function was very different from that of today's Cabinet. The Council, which was composed of "such persons and constituted in such manner as may be directed" by royal instructions,<ref>1877 letters patent, Art. II.</ref> existed to advise the [[list of British Governors of the Straits Settlements|Governor of the Straits Settlements]] and wielded no executive power. The Governor was required to consult the Executive Council on all affairs of importance unless they were too urgent to be laid before it, or if reference to it would prejudice the public service. In such urgent cases, the Governor had to inform the Council of the measures he had taken.<ref>{{citation|author=[[Richard Olaf Winstedt]]|title=The Constitution of the Colony of the Straits Settlements and the Federated and Unfederated Malay States|location=London|publisher=[[Chatham House|Royal Institute of International Affairs]]|year=1931|page=4}}.</ref><ref>{{citation|author=Kevin Tan Yew Lee|chapter=A Short Legal and Constitutional History of Singapore|editor=Kevin Y[ew] L[ee] Tan, ed.|title=The Singapore Legal System|edition=2nd|location=Singapore|publisher=[[National University of Singapore|Singapore University Press]]|year=1999|page=26 at 37|isbn=9971-69-213-9 (pbk.)}}.</ref>

Following the Second World War, the Straits Settlements were disbanded and Singapore became a Crown colony in its own right.<ref>By the Singapore Order-in-Council 1946, [[Statutory Rules and Orders|S. R. & O.]], 1946, No. 462 (UK), dated 27 March 1946.</ref> The reconstituted Executive Council consisted of six officials and four nominated "unofficials".<ref>Tan, "A Short Legal and Constitutional History of Singapore", p. 41.</ref> In February 1954, the Rendel Constitutional Commission under the chairmanship of Sir [[George William Rendel]], which had been appointed to comprehensively review the constitution of the Colony of Singapore, rendered its report. Among other things, it recommended that a Council of Ministers be created, composed of three ''ex officio'' Official Members and six Elected Members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore]] appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the Leader of the House, who would be the leader of the largest political party or [[coalition government|coalition of parties]] having majority support in the legislature. The recommendation was implemented in 1955.<ref>By the Singapore Colony Order-in-Council 1955, [[Statutory Instrument (UK)|S.I.]] 1955, No. 187 (UK).</ref> In the general election held that year, the [[Labour Front]] took a majority of the seats in the Assembly, and [[David Saul Marshall]] became the first [[Chief Minister of Singapore]]. Major problems with the Rendel Constitution were that the Chief Minister and Ministers' powers were ill defined, and that the Official Members retained control of the finance, administration, and internal security and law portfolios. This led to confrontation between Marshall, who saw himself as a Prime Minister governing the country, and the [[Governor of Singapore|Governor]], Sir [[John Fearns Nicoll]], who felt that important decisions and policies should remain with himself and the Official Members.<ref>{{citation|author=Yeo Kim Wah|title=Political Development in Singapore, 1945<U+2013>55|location=[Singapore]|publisher=Singapore University Press|year=[1973]|page=62}}.</ref><ref>Tan, "A Short Legal and Constitutional History of Singapore", pp. 42<U+2013>43.</ref>

[[File:LeeKuanYew-20051106.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Lee Kuan Yew]], who was elected the first [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] in 1959, in a 2005 photograph]]

In 1956, members of the Legislative Assembly held constitutional talks with the [[Colonial Office]] in London. The talks broke down as Marshall did not agree to the British Government's proposal for the [[casting vote]] on a proposed Defence Council to be held by the British High Commissioner to Singapore, who would only exercise it in an emergency. Marshall resigned as Chief Minister in June 1956, and was replaced by [[Lim Yew Hock]].<ref>{{citation|author=[[Mary Turnbull|C[onstance] M[ary] Turnbull]]|title=A History of Singapore, 1819<U+2013>1975|location=Kuala Lumpur; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1977|page=263|isbn=019580354X}}.</ref> The following year, Lim led another delegation to the UK for further talks on self-government. This time, agreement was reached on the composition of an Internal Security Council.<ref>Turnbull, p. 264.</ref> Other constitutional arrangements were swiftly settled in 1958, and on 1 August the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed the State of Singapore Act 1958,<ref>[[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1940-1959#6 & 7 Eliz. II|6 & 7 Eliz. II]], c. 59.</ref> granting the colony full internal self-government. Under Singapore's new constitution which came into force on 3 June 1959,<ref>Singapore (Constitution) Order-in-Council 1958, S.I. 1958, No. 156 (UK).</ref> the Governor was replaced by the [[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]] (Head of State), who had power to appoint as Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Legislative Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice.<ref>Singapore (Constitution) Order-in-Council 1958 (UK), Art. 21.</ref> The Constitution also created the post of the British High Commissioner,<ref>Singapore (Constitution) Order-in-Council 1958 (UK), Arts. 15<U+2013>19.</ref> who was entitled to receive the agenda of each Cabinet meeting and to see all Cabinet papers. In the [[Singaporean general election, 1959|1959 general elections]], the [[People's Action Party]] swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and [[Lee Kuan Yew]] became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. Nine other Ministers were appointed to the Cabinet.<ref>Tan, "A Short Legal and Constitutional History of Singapore", pp. 44<U+2013>45.</ref>

The British High Commissioner's role became that of an [[ambassador]] following Singapore's independence from Britain and [[Singapore in Malaysia|merger with Malaysia]] in 1963. Apart from that the executive branch of the Singapore Government remained largely unchanged,<ref>Tan, "A Short Legal and Constitutional History of Singapore", p. 46.</ref> although now it governed a state within a larger [[federation]]. However, with effect from 9 August 1965, Singapore left the [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]] and became a fully [[history of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|independent republic]]. On separation from Malaysia, the Singapore Government retained its executive authority, and the executive authority of the [[Parliament of Malaysia]] ceased to extend to Singapore and vested in the Singapore Government.<ref>Constitution and Malaysia (Singapore Amendment) Act 1965 (No. 53 of 1965) (Malaysia), ss. 4 and 5.</ref> The [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], the Supreme Head of State of Malaysia, also ceased to be the Supreme Head of Singapore and relinquished his sovereignty, jurisdiction, power and authority, executive or otherwise in respect of Singapore, which revested in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore.<ref>Constitution and Malaysia (Singapore Amendment) Act 1965 (Malaysia), s. 6.</ref> The Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965<ref>[http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?actno=REVED-RSI Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965] (No. 9 of 1965) (1985 Rev. Ed.), s. 4.</ref> then vested the executive authority of Singapore in the newly created post of President, and made it exercisable by him or by the Cabinet or by any Minister authorized by the Cabinet.

==Structure of government==
Singapore inherited a [[Westminster system]] of government from the [[British Empire|British]]. In such systems, there is an overlap between the [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislature|legislative branches]] of government. The [[head of state]], who is the [[President of Singapore]], is a member of both the executive government and the [[Parliament of Singapore]] but plays a minimal role in them. Executive power lies in the hands of the [[cabinet (government)|Cabinet]], which is made up of the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] (the [[head of government]]) and other Ministers.<ref>{{Singapore Constitution|rep=1999}}, Art. 24(1).</ref> At the same time, the Prime Minister and Ministers are also [[Members of the Singapore Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs).

Following constitutional reforms in 1991, the office of President was transformed from an appointed to an elected post. Thus, both the President and MPs are elected to their posts by the [[Singaporean nationality law|citizens of Singapore]] in separate [[elections in Singapore|elections]].<ref>Singapore Constitution, Arts. 17(2) ("The President shall be elected by the citizens of Singapore in accordance with any law made by the Legislature.") and 39(1) ("Parliament shall consist of <U+2014> (a) such number of elected Members as is required to be returned at a general election by the [[electoral district|constituencies]] prescribed by or under any law made by the Legislature; (b) such other members ... who shall be known as [[Non-Constituency Member of Parliament|non-constituency Members]] ...; and (c) such other Members ... who shall be known as [[Nominated Member of Parliament|nominated Members]] ..." The procedure for elections is governed by the {{Singapore Statute|title=Presidential Elections Act|cap=240A|ed=2007}} and the {{Singapore Statute|title=Parliamentary Elections Act|cap=218|ed=2007}}.</ref>

===Appointment of Cabinet===
[[File:President of Singapore SR Nathan.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Sellapan Ramanathan|S.R. Nathan]], the [[President of Singapore]], in 2006]]

The President appoints as Prime Minister an MP who, in his judgment, is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the MPs.<ref name="Constitution Art. 25(1)">Singapore Constitution, Art. 25(1).</ref> In practice, the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the political party holding the majority of the seats in Parliament.<ref name="Thio 84">{{citation|author=[[Thio Li-ann]]|chapter=The Constitutional Framework of Powers|editor=Kevin Y[ew] L[ee] Tan, ed.|title=The Singapore Legal System|edition=2nd|location=Singapore|publisher=[[National University of Singapore|Singapore University Press]]|year=1999|page=67 at 84|isbn=9971-69-213-9 (pbk.)}}.</ref> The President also appoints other Ministers from among the MPs, acting in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice.<ref name="Constitution Art. 25(1)"/>

Before entering on the duties of their office, the Prime Minister and other Ministers must take and [[wikt:subscribe#Verb|subscribe]] (sign) the Oath of Allegiance and an oath for the due execution of their offices before the President.<ref>Singapore Constitution. Art. 27.</ref> The Oath of Allegiance reads as follows:

{{quote|I, [''name''], having been appointed to the office of [''name of office''], do solemnly swear [''or'' affirm] that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Republic of Singapore and that I will preserve, protect and defend the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution of the Republic of Singapore]].<ref>Singapore Constitution, 1st Sch., para. 2.</ref>}}

The oath for the due execution of the office of Prime Minister or a Minister is as follows:

{{quote|I, [''name''], being chosen and appointed as Prime Minister [''or'' Minister] of Singapore, do solemnly swear [''or'' affirm] that I will at all times faithfully discharge my duties as Prime Minister [''or'' Minister] according to law, and to the best of my knowledge and ability, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.<ref>Singapore Constitution, 1st Sch. paras. 4 and 4A.</ref>}}

Cabinet members are prohibited from holding any [[office of profit]] or actively engaging in any commercial enterprise.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 33.</ref> In addition, they are required to comply with a ''Code of Conduct for Ministers''.<ref>{{citation|author=Lau Wah Ming, Secretary to the Cabinet|title=Code of Conduct for Ministers|url=http://www.getformesingapore.com/previous2005/020805_codeofconductforministers.htm|publisher=Cabinet of Singapore (reproduced on the Getforme Singapore website)|date=4 July 2005|accessdate=26 April 2009}}.</ref> For example, to counter potential allegations of corruption and unexplained wealth and to avoid potential conflicts between private interests and public responsibilities, the Code requires every Minister, upon appointment to office, to disclose in confidence to the President through the Prime Minister all sources of income other than his salary as a Minister and as an MP. This must include all assets, such as financial assets, real property, interests in any company or professional practice, and any other substantial personal assets as well as financial liabilities, including mortgages and borrowings.<ref>''Code of Conduct for Ministers'', para. 1.1.</ref> A Minister must also "scrupulously avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest between his office and his private financial interests".<ref>''Code of Conduct for Ministers'', para. 3.1.</ref> Thus, a Minister is not permitted to accept any favour of any kind from persons in negotiation with, or seeking to obtain any licence or enter into any contractual relations with, the Government,<ref>''Code of Conduct for Ministers'', para. 3.4.</ref> or to use official information that comes to him as a Minister for his own private profit or the profit of any family member or associate.<ref>''Code of Conduct for Ministers'', para. 3.5.</ref>

===Vacation of office===
The President must declare the office of Prime Minister vacant if the Prime Minister resigns his office, or if the President, acting in his discretion, is satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the MPs. In the latter situation, the President is required first to inform the Prime Minister of his evaluation in this regard, and if the Prime Minister requests him to, the President may [[dissolution of parliament|dissolve Parliament]] instead of making a declaration of vacancy.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 26(1).</ref> A [[general election]] must be held within three months after the dissolution of Parliament.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 66.</ref> This gives the former Prime Minister the opportunity to consolidate support by receiving a fresh mandate at the polls.<ref name="Thio 84"/>

At present, it is not clear what evidence the President may rely on to be satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of MPs, as the [[judicial system of Singapore|Singapore courts]] have not yet had to decide the issue. In the [[Sarawak]] case of ''Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg'',<ref>[1966] 2 M.L.J. [''Malayan Law Journal''] 187, declining to apply the approach taken by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] on appeal from Western Nigeria in ''Adegbenro v. Akintola'' [1963] A.C. 614. See also {{citation|author=Thio Su Mien|title=Dismissal of Chief Ministers|journal=Malaya Law Review|year=1966|volume=8|page=203}}.</ref> decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, the court found that the phrase ''ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the Members of Parliament'' was a [[technical terminology|term of art]] which had to be signified by a formal [[motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]] taken by the legislature. In contrast, a [[Sabah]] court held in ''Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sabah''<ref>[1995] 1 M.L.J. 169.</ref> that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote.<ref name="Thio 85">Thio, "The Constitutional Framework of Powers", p. 85.</ref> This might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President.

Other Cabinet ministers must vacate their office if they resign, or if their appointments are revoked by the President acting in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 26(2).</ref> A person who has vacated his or her office as Minister may, if qualified, be subsequently appointed again as a Minister.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 26(3).</ref>

==Responsibilities==
[[File:Lee Hsien Loong 2004-11-21.jpg|thumb|The Cabinet is headed by the Prime Minister, [[Lee Hsien Loong]], photographed here on 21 November 2004]]

The executive authority of Singapore is vested in the President and is exercisable by him or by the Cabinet of Singapore or any Minister authorized by the Cabinet.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 23(1).</ref> However, the President normally plays a nominal and largely ceremonial role in the executive branch of government. Although the President acts in his personal discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore,<ref>See, generally, Art. 21(2) of the Singapore Constitution.</ref> he is otherwise required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 21(1).</ref> It is the Cabinet that has the general direction and control of the [[Government of Singapore]].<ref name="Constitution Art. 24(2)">Singapore Constitution, Art. 24(2).</ref> As Singapore follows the Westminster system of government, the [[legislation|legislative]] agenda of Parliament is determined by the Cabinet. At the start of each new [[legislative session|Parliamentary session]], the President gives an address prepared by the Cabinet that outlines what the Cabinet intends to achieve in the session.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 62: "The President may address Parliament and may send messages thereto."</ref>

Under the Constitution, the Cabinet is [[Cabinet collective responsibility|collectively responsible]] to Parliament.<ref name="Constitution Art. 24(2)"/> In theory, Parliament acts as a check on the power of the Cabinet as Ministers are required to justify their actions and policies upon being questioned by MPs. However, in Singapore this is a weak check because the ruling [[People's Action Party]] holds a large Parliamentary majority, and party members who are MPs are required by [[party discipline]] to vote according to the [[whip (politics)|party Whip]]'s instructions.<ref name="Thio 85"/>

The Cabinet may not be summoned except by the authority of the Prime Minister.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 28(1).</ref> As far as is practicable, the Prime Minister is required to attend and preside at Cabinet meetings, but in his absence he may appoint another Minister to preside.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 28(2).</ref> 

Whenever the Prime Minister is ill, absent from Singapore, or has been granted leave of absence from his duties, the functions conferred on him by the Constitution are exercisable by any other Minister authorized by the President.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 26(4)(a). The President may revoke any such authority: Art. 26(4)(b).</ref> In general, the President must act in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice in appointing a Minister for this purpose. However, the President may act in his own discretion if in his opinion it is impracticable to obtain the advice of the Prime Minister due to his illness or absence.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 26(4)(c).</ref>

===Responsibilities of Ministers===
The Prime Minister may, by giving written directions, charge any Minister with responsibility for any department or subject.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 30(1).</ref> In practice, this is done by issuing notifications that are published in the ''Government Gazette''. For instance, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Responsibility of Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security, Prime Minister's Office) Notification 2009<ref>S 142/2009.</ref> states:

{{quote|It is hereby notified for general information that, pursuant to Article 30(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, the Prime Minister has directed that Mr S. Jayakumar shall, with effect from 1st April 2009, be charged with the responsibility for the following matters:
:(a) national security issues involving or affecting more than one Ministry;
:(b) Chairmanship of the Security Policy Review Committee;
:(c) foreign policy issues involving or affecting more than one Ministry; and
:(d) foreign policy issues which involve legal negotiation or international adjudication,
and that he shall be designated as Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security.}}

Ministers may be designated by the Prime Minister to be in charge of particular [[organisation of the Government of Singapore|ministries]], or as Ministers in the [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Prime Minister's Office]]. Such Ministers were formerly known as [[Minister without portfolio|Ministers without portfolio]].

The Prime Minister may retain any department or subject in his charge.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 30(2).</ref>

==Current Cabinet==
A Cabinet reshuffle took place effective as of April 2009. Of note is the fact that Professor [[S. Jayakumar]] relinquished his post of Deputy Prime Minister, and was replaced by [[Teo Chee Hean]].<ref name="ST 20090327">{{citation|author=Sue-Ann Chia|title=Teo Chee Hean named Deputy Prime Minister|url=http://www.pmo.gov.sg/News/PressReleases/News+articles+on+cabinet+changes+and+other+appointments.htm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gHMLiKv1|archivedate=25 April 2009|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] (reproduced on the website of the Prime Minister's Office)|date=27 March 2009|page=A1}}; {{citation|author=Loh Chee Kong|title=A team for new challenges|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/309963.asp|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gHMyyjqu|archivedate=25 April 2009|newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|date=27 March 2009|pages=1, 3}}.</ref><ref>{{citation|author=Goh Chin Lian|title=PM's team strengthened with Teo as deputy|url=http://www.pmo.gov.sg/News/PressReleases/News+articles+on+cabinet+changes+and+other+appointments.htm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gHMLiKv1|archivedate=25 April 2009|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=27 March 2009|page=A8}}.</ref> [[Gan Kim Yong]] was appointed [[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Minister for Manpower]] after a year as Acting Minister,<ref name="ST 20090327"/><ref>{{citation|author=Jeremy Au Yong|title=Minister Gan keeps his focus on jobs|url=http://www.pmo.gov.sg/News/PressReleases/News+articles+on+cabinet+changes+and+other+appointments.htm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gHMLiKv1|archivedate=25 April 2009|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=27 March 2009|page=A8}}.</ref> and [[Lim Hwee Hua]] took up the post of Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, becoming the first woman in Singapore to become a full minister.<ref name="ST 20090327"/><ref>{{citation|author=Aaron Low|title=Lim Hwee Hwa is first woman minister|url=http://www.pmo.gov.sg/News/PressReleases/News+articles+on+cabinet+changes+and+other+appointments.htm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gHMLiKv1|archivedate=25 April 2009|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=27 March 2009|page=A1}}; {{citation|author=Derrick A.
