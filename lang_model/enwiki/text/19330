'''Tannat''' is a red [[wine]] [[grape]], historically grown in [[South West France (wine region)|South West France]] in the [[Madiran AOC]] and is now one of the most prominent grapes in [[Uruguay]], where it is considered the "national grape".<ref> L. Luxner ''"[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10718469_ITM Small Uruguayan wineries making their mark]"'' Wines & Vines Jan 1st, 2001</ref> It is also grown in  [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]] and in [[Italy]]'s [[Puglia]] region where it is used as a blending grape.<ref>[http://www.winecountry.it/regions/apulia/grapes.php Apulia wine region of Italy]</ref>  In the [[United States|US]] state of [[Virginia]], there are small experimental plantings of the vine, and plantings in [[California]] have increased dramatically in the first years of the 21st Century.  Tannat wines produced in Uruguay are usually quite different in character from Madiran wines, being lighter in body and lower in [[tannin]]s. It is also used to make [[Armagnac (drink)|Armagnac]] and [[Wine tasting descriptors|full bodied]] [[ros<U+00E9>]]. In France, efforts to solve the harsh tannic nature of the grape lead to the development of the [[winemaking]] technique known as [[micro-oxygenation]].

==France==
Tannat is normally found in the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque]]-influenced regions of France near the [[Pyr<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>es]]. The wine is notable for its very high tannin levels and is often blended with [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Cabernet franc]] and [[Fer]] to soften the [[astringency]] and make it more approachable. In addition to Madiran, Tannat is also produced in [[Iroul<U+00E9>guy]], [[Tursan]] and [[B<U+00E9>arn]]. Modern winemaking in the region has begun to emphasize the fruit more and utilize [[oak (wine)|oak]] aging to help soften the tannins.<ref name="Clarke pg 241"> Oz Clarke ''Encyclopedia of Grapes'' pg 241 Harcourt Books 2001 ISBN 0151007144 </ref> Now the wines typically spend about 20 months in oak prior to release.<ref name="Oxford pg 679"> J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 679 Oxford University Press 2006 ISBN 0198609906 </ref>

A French Tannat is characterized by its firm, tannic structure with [[raspberry]] aromas and the ability to age well. They often have a deep dark color with high level of [[alcohol]]. The ros<U+00E9>s produced in Iroul<U+00E9>guy go through very limited [[maceration (wine)|maceration]] time with the skins in order to keep the wines from getting too tannic. The resulting wines are typically full bodied and very fruity. In B<U+00E9>arn both red and ros<U+00E9>s are produced from blends that include 60% Tannat and a 40% mix of [[Manseng noir]], Fer and [[Courbu noir]].<ref name="Robinson pg 203-204"> J. Robinson ''Vines, Grapes & Wines'' pg 203-204 Mitchell Beazley 1986 ISBN 1857329996 </ref>

In 1990, Madiran winemaker [[Patrick Ducournau]] experimented with adding controlled amounts of [[oxygen]] [[aeration]] into Tannat while [[fermentation (wine)|fermenting]] and ended up developing the modern winemaking process of micro-oxygenation.<ref name="Oxford pg 442"> J.

==Uruguay==

The Tannat vine was introduced to Uruguay by [[Basque people|Basque]] [[settler]]s, especially Pascual Harriague, in the 19th century. Along with the Manseng vine it quickly started to flourish in its new home. Today it is often blended with [[Pinot noir]] and [[Merlot]] and is made in a variety of styles including those reminiscent of [[Port wine|Port]] and [[Beaujolais]]. From Uruguay the vine spread to Argentina and from there [[flying winemaker]]s promoted the grape's resurgence in [[California]] at the end of the 20th century.<ref name="Oxford pg 679"/> 

Plantings of Tannat (also known in Uruguay as ''Harriague'') have been increasing in Uruguay each year as that country's wine industry develops. The Tannat wines produced here are characterized by more elegant and softer tannins and [[blackberry]] fruit notes. Vineyards in Uruguay have begun to distinguish between the "old vines" that are descendants from the original [[cutting (plant)|cutting]]s brought over from Europe and the new [[Cloning#Horticultural|clones]] being produced today. The newer vines tend to produce more powerful wines with higher [[alcohol level]]s but less acidity and complex fruit characteristics. Some wineries utilize both vines to make blends.<ref name="Clarke pg 241"/>

==United States==
In the late 19th century, [[University of California-Berkeley]] [[agriculture]] professor [[Eugene W. Hilgard]] imported the Tannat vine from Southwest France and began to grow it in the University's vineyards. The grape did not receive much attention until the late 20th century, when South American [[varietal]]s of the wine began to receive international acclaim. In the 1990s several plantings began to pop up in California in the [[Paso Robles AVA|Paso Robles]] and [[Santa Cruz Mountains AVA]]s with such producers as [[Bonny Doon Vineyard]] using it in blends with Cabernet franc and [[Tablas Creek Vineyard]] using it in conjunction with Rhone varietals. Other Californian wine producers began using it in [[Meritage]] blends and also with their [[Sangiovese]] and [[Syrah]] wines. Vineyards in [[Arizona]] and [[Virginia]] began importing cuttings from California. In 2002, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] approved Tablas Creek Vineyard's petition to add Tannat to the list of grape varieties that could be made into a varietal wine.<ref>L.
