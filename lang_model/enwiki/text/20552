== Character history ==

[[Image:Belzebub's father.gif|thumb|left|Beelzebub retrieves the clearance of his father Satan to search for the Mystic Water.]]
Beelzebub plays an essential large role in the world of ''Sand Land'' as the main character. Being the Prince of the Underworld, and son of the Demon King Satan,<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #1, Pages 21-22</ref> Beelzebub embarks on a journey to find the Mystic Spring with a human who claims to be a sheriff named Rao, alongside Beelzebub's elderly demon friend, Sheef. As soon as the trio lefted to obtain the water, they came across a rampaging [[dragon]] in the [[desert]]<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #1, Pages 30-31</ref> and were eventually able to escape its clutches due to Rao untying the rope that brought the weighted carriage of food and other supplies to their vehicle.<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #1, Pages 32-33</ref>

Stranded without food and no money, with little fuel to spare in their vehicle, the team drives to the nearest town. Beelzebub is asked how old he is by Rao and responds that he is maybe around 2,500 years old, and Sheef also replies that he himself is a bit older than that.<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #2, Page 36</ref> Beelzebub also explains to Rao that although demons do evil deeds, they don't kill, but humans do.<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #2, Page 37</ref> To their surprise, the vehicle's tires are punctured by [[spike strip]]s set as a trap by a gang of desert thieves. They are attacked by the thieves, but the latter are easily defeated by Beelzebub.

A plan thought up by Beelzebub involving Sheef is successful and the three soon discover a military tank pertaining to the king's soldiers. They rob the tank and head off southwards.<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #3, Pages 58 and 59</ref> Having avoided certain defeat from a military plane and escaping, Beelzebub and the others discover that the Mystic Water Spring to the south is overtaken by the king as his own natural water source,<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #5, Page 78</ref> and that the king's men want them dead. When the three were asleep at night for the next big day, while Sheef was still sleeping, Rao awakens to find Beelzebub standing on a small rocky cliff stretching his body towards the night sky. When asked by Rao what he was doing, Beelzebub states that he was absorbing the dark power for tomorrow.

As Beelzebub and the others leave in the morning for the Mystic Spring, a group of four tanks attempt to strike at them. Thanks to Beelzebub's good eyesight, the team is able to maneuver the tanks attack on them. During the battle, after Beelzebub leaps incredibly high to spy on the enemy,<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #7, Pages 116-117</ref> he contacts Rao with [[telepathy]]<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #8, Page 121</ref> and gives an update on the current situation. In the end, the trio befriend the Royal Army and their leader, General Are. As a surprise hit is launched on the two teams by another gang, they are quickly pounded to the ground by Beelzebub quite easily. The gang is pursued by Beelzebub, who is caught afterwards in a [[Dust storm|sandstorm]] and manages to escape, only to find refuge in a cave that lead him to an [[oasis]] where he eventually found the Mystic Water Spring.<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #10, Page 150</ref>

After Beelzebub contacts Rao with telepathy and notifies him and Sheef about his discovery of the Legendary Spring, the team follows the path down the southern end of the riverbed. From there, they finally arrive at a dam leading to the fortress.<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #11, Pages 164-165</ref> It turns out that the entire river that once ran throughout Sand Land was all damed up, explaining the cause of the drought.<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #11, Pages 168-169</ref> As the three proceeded to demolish the dam with their tank, they are attacked by the king's personal bodyguard, General Zeu. He unleashes the robotic Insect Man on them; which was originally a secret weapon to rid of all demons.<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #12, Page 175</ref> The Insect Man gives Beelzebub a run for his money and is impaled in the [[torso]] by the Insect Man's claw.<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #12, Pages 185-186</ref> Rao suggests certain action must be made against the Insect Man before Beelzebub is killed, but is told by Sheef that if a demon who possesses the dark power gets into danger, something terrible will happen.<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #12, Page 186</ref> Sure enough, Beelzebub's wounds [[Regeneration (biology)|heal rapidly]]<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #12, Page 187</ref> and his brute strength and power was strong enough to create a [[shock wave]] that sends the robot to dismay. General Zeu then self-destructs the Insect Man causing a blast strong enough to injure Beelzebub. With Beelzebub's wounds still unrecovered and being unable to stand, Zeu proceeds to finish off Rao and Sheef with a barrage of bombs, but his attempts are twarted by General Are and the Royal Army who save the duo by killing the malignant general.<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #13, Pages 199-200</ref>

Beelzebub fully recovers from his injuries and Rao thanks General Are for rescuing them; the dam is successfully destroyed and General Are announces on the radio broadcast that the water shortage is taken care of thanks to the help of Beelzebub and his friends.<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #14, Page 211</ref> After about nine days have passed, Rao comes to visit Beelzebub and friends and asks him if he wants to him bring up some supplies to someone. He jokingly replies to Rao that he'd be helpless out there without him, and Sheef offers his assistance as well. The three argue about who is the better driver along the way.<ref>''Sand Land'' manga, Volume 1, Chapter #14, Pages 214-215</ref>
