The '''European Central Bank''' is the [[Institutions of the European Union|institution]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) that administers the [[monetary policy]] of the 17 EU  [[Eurozone]] [[Member State of the European Union|member states]]. It is thus one of the world's most important [[central bank]]s. The bank was established by the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] in 1998, and is headquartered in [[Frankfurt]], Germany. The current [[President of the European Central Bank|President]] of the ECB is [[Mario Draghi]],{{Update after|2011|01|11}} former governor of the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]].<ref>
{{cite web | url = http://money.cnn.com/2011/06/24/news/international/ecb_trichet_draghi/ | title =ECB names Italian to succeed Trichet as chief | author = Aaron Smith | date = 2011-06-24 | work = CNN Money | accessdate = 2011-06-26 }}</ref>

The primary objective of the European Central Bank is to maintain [[price stability]] within the [[Eurozone]], which is the same as keeping inflation low. The Governing Council defined price stability as inflation of around 2%. ([[Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices]]) Unlike, for example, the United States Federal Reserve Bank, the ECB has only one primary objective with other objectives subordinate to it.

The key tasks of the ECB are to define and implement the [[monetary policy]] for the Eurozone, to conduct foreign exchange operations, to take care of the [[foreign reserve]]s of the European System of Central Banks and promote smooth operation of the financial market infrastructure under the [[TARGET|Target payments system]] and being currently developed technical platform for settlement of securities in Europe ([[TARGET2 Securities]]).
Furthermore, it has the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of [[euro banknotes]]. Member states can issue [[euro coins]] but the amount must be authorised by the ECB beforehand (upon the introduction of the euro, the ECB also had exclusive right to issue coins).

On 9 May 2010, the 27 [[Member States of the European Union|member states]] of the [[European Union]] agreed to incorporate the European Financial Stability Facility. The EFSF<U+2019>s mandate is to safeguard financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to Eurozone Member States.

The bank must also co-operate within the EU and internationally with third bodies and entities. Finally it contributes to maintaining a stable financial system and monitoring the banking sector. The latter can be seen, for example, in the bank's intervention during the [[2007 Subprime mortgage financial crisis|2007 credit crisis]] when it loaned billions of euros to banks to stabilise the financial system.

Although the ECB is governed by European law directly and thus not by corporate law applying to private law companies, its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital. Its capital is five billion euro which is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders. The initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the states' population and GDP, but the key is adjustable. Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral.

Throughout 2011 various member states of the European Union showed themselves to be increasingly unable to meet financial commitments. At its heart, the crisis of the European currency unit or ECU is similar to almost any other financial crisis, including the crisis of 2008.  Key concepts to understanding the crisis include [[collateral (finance)|collateral]], [[assets]], and [[liabilities]].

The bank is based in [[Frankfurt]], the largest financial centre in the [[Eurozone]]. Its location in the city is fixed by the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] along with other major institutions. In the city, the bank currently occupies Frankfurt's [[Eurotower (Frankfurt)|Eurotower]] until its purpose-built headquarters are built.

==History==
{{See|History of the euro}}
The European Central Bank is the ''de facto'' successor of the [[European Monetary Institute]] (EMI).<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/history/emu/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Economic and Monetary Union|publisher=[[ECB]] |accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> The EMI was established at the start of the second stage of the EU's [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] (EMU) to handle the transitional issues of states adopting the euro and prepare for the creation of the ECB and [[European System of Central Banks]] (ESCB).<ref name="autogenerated1"/>  The EMI itself took over from the earlier [[European Monetary Co-operation Fund]] (EMCF).<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web |title=European Central Bank |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=8034 |accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Wim Duisenberg.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Wim Duisenberg]], first President of the ECB.]]
The ECB formally replaced the EMI on 1 June 1998 by virtue of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU, Treaty of Maastricht), however it did not exercise its full powers until the [[introduction of the euro]] on 1 January 1999, signalling the third stage of EMU.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The bank was the final institution needed for EMU, as outlined by the EMU reports of [[Pierre Werner]] and [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Jacques Delors]]. It was established on 1 June 1998.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/history/emu/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Economic and Monetary Union |publisher=Ecb.int |date= |accessdate=2011-06-26}}</ref>

The first [[List of Presidents of the European Central Bank|President of the Bank]] was [[Wim Duisenberg]], the former president of the [[De Nederlandsche Bank|Dutch central bank]] and the [[European Monetary Institute]].<ref name="autogenerated3"/> While Duisenberg had been the head of the EMI (taking over from [[Alexandre Lamfalussy]] of Belgium) just before the ECB came into existence,<ref name="autogenerated3"/> the French government wanted [[Jean-Claude Trichet]], former head of the [[Banque de France|French central bank]], to be the ECB's first president.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> The French argued that since the ECB was to be located in Germany, its President should be French. This was opposed by the German, Dutch and Belgian governments who saw Duisenberg as a guarantor of a strong euro.<ref name="ENA EMU3">{{cite web |title=The third stage of Economic and Monetary Union |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=14950 |accessdate=16 October 2007}}</ref> Tensions were abated by a gentleman's agreement in which Duisenberg would stand down before the end of his mandate, to be replaced by Trichet, which occurred in November 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/uggboy/4417740330/ |title=The powerful European Central Bank [ E C B ] in the heart of Frankfurt/Main - Germany - The Europower in Mainhattan - Enjoy the glances of euro and europe....03/2010....travel round the world....:)|work=UggBoy<U+2665>UggGirl [ PHOTO // WORLD // TRAVEL ] |publisher=Flickr|date=6 March 2010|accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref>
 
There had also been tension over the ECB's [[Executive Board of the European Central Bank|Executive Board]], with the United Kingdom demanding a seat even though it had not joined the Single Currency.<ref name="ENA EMU3"/> Under pressure from France, three seats were assigned to the largest members, France, Germany, and Italy; Spain also demanded and obtained a seat. Despite such a system of appointment the board asserted its independence early on in resisting calls for interest rates and future candidates to it.<ref name="ENA EMU3"/>

When the ECB was created, it covered a [[Eurozone]] of eleven members. Since then, Greece joined in January 2001, Slovenia in January 2007, Cyprus and Malta in January 2008, Slovakia in January 2009, and Estonia in January 2011, enlarging the bank's scope and the membership of its Governing Council.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

On 1 December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, ECB according to the article 13 of TEU, gained official status of an [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institution]].

In April 2011, the ECB raised interest rates for the first time since 2008 from 1% to 1.25%,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ecb-raises-interest-rates-2011-04-07 |title=ECB Raises Interest Rates - MarketWatch|work=marketwatch.com |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> with a further increase to 1.50% in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ecb.int/stats/monetary/rates/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Key interest rates|year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref>

=== Future ===
When German appointee to the Governing Council and Executive board, J<U+00FC>rgen Stark, resigned in protest of the ECB's bond buying programme, Financial Times Deutschland called it "the end of the ECB as we know it" referring to its perceived "hawkish" stance on inflation and its historical Bundesbank influence.<ref>[http://www.ftd.de/politik/europa/:stark-ruecktritt-das-ende-der-ezb-wie-wir-sie-kannten/60102214.html Financial Times Deutschland]</ref>

==Powers and objectives==
[[File:Zahlungsmittel.JPG|thumb|[[Euro banknotes]]]]

The primary objective of the European Central Bank is to maintain [[price stability]] within the [[Eurozone]], which is the same as keeping inflation low. The Governing Council defined price stability as inflation of around 2%. ([[Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices]]) <ref name="ENA Pow">{{cite web |title=Powers and responsibilities of the European Central Bank |publisher=European Central Bank |url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/tasks/html/index.en.html |accessdate=10 March 2009}}</ref> Unlike for example the United States Federal Reserve Bank, the ECB has only one primary objective with other objectives subordinate to it.

=== Authorities ===
The key tasks of the ECB are to define and implement the [[monetary policy]] for the Eurozone, to conduct foreign exchange operations, to take care of the [[foreign reserve]]s of the European System of Central Banks and promote smooth operation of the financial market infrastructure under the [[TARGET|Target payments system]]<ref name="BBC ECB">{{cite news |last=Fairlamb |first=David |coauthors=Rossant, John |title=The powers of the European Central Bank |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=12 February 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/business_basics/86006.stm |accessdate=16 October 2007 | date=12 February 2003}}</ref>  and being currently developed technical platform for settlement of securities in Europe ([[TARGET2 Securities]]).
Furthermore, it has the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of [[euro banknotes]]. Member states can issue [[euro coins]] but the amount must be authorised by the ECB beforehand (upon the introduction of the euro, the ECB also had exclusive right to issue coins).<ref name="BBC ECB"/>

In U.S. style central banking, liquidity is furnished to the economy primarily through the purchase of Treasury bonds by the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]. The Eurosystem uses a different method. There are about 1500 eligible banks which may bid for short term [[repurchase agreement|repo contracts]] of two weeks to three months duration.<ref>In practice, 400-500 banks participate regularly. <br/>{{citation | url = http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp107.pdf | title = The collateral frameworks of the Eurosystem, the Federal Reserve System and the Bank of England and the financial market turmoil | author = Samuel Cheun | coauthors = Isabel von K<U+00F6>ppen-Mertes and Benedict Weller | month = December | year = 2009 | work = | publisher = [[ECB]] | page = | accessdate = 2011-08-24 }}</ref> The banks in effect borrow cash and must pay it back; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually. When the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again.  An increase in the quantity of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy.  A decrease has the contrary effect.  The contracts are carried on the asset side of the European Central Bank's balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability.  In lay terms, the liability of the central bank is money, and an increase in deposits in member banks, carried as a liability by the central bank, means that more money has been put into the economy.<ref>The process is similar, though on a grand scale, to an individual who every month charges $10,000 on his or her credit card, pays it off every month, but also withdraws (and pays off) an additional $10,000 each succeeding month for transaction purposes.  Such a person is operating "net borrowed" on a continual basis, and even though the borrowing from the credit card is short term, the effect is a stable increase in the money supply.  If the person borrows less, less money circulates in the economy.  If he or she borrows more, the money supply increases.  An individual's ability to borrow from his or her credit card company is determined by the credit card company: it reflects the company's overall judgment of its ability to lend to all borrowers, and also its appraisal of the financial condition of that one particular borrower.  The ability of member banks to borrow from the central bank is fundamentally similar.</ref>

=== Mandates ===
To qualify for participation in the auctions, banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities.  These can be the public debt of member states, but a fairly wide range of private banking securities are also accepted.<ref name="The ECB and the Eurosystem">{{cite journal | url=http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/neer/neer2002/neer202e.pdf | title=The European Central Bank and the Eurosystem | last=Bertaut | first=Carol C. | journal=New England Economic Review | year=2002 | issue=2nd Quarter | pages=25<U+2013>28}}</ref>  The fairly stringent membership requirements for the European Union, especially with regard to [[sovereign debt]] as a percentage of each member state's gross domestic product, are designed to insure that assets offered to the bank as collateral are, at least in theory, all equally good, and all equally protected from the risk of inflation.<ref name="The ECB and the Eurosystem" />  The economic and financial crisis that began in 2008 has revealed some relative weaknesses in the sovereign debt of such member countries as Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain.<ref>{{cite news |first=Raphel |last=Minder |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/25/business/global/25spainecon.html |title=Fears Mount Over Spain and Risks to the Euro |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=24 November 2010 |accessdate=24 November 2010 }}</ref> These securities are not limited to the countries of issue, but held in many cases by banks in other member states.<ref name="The ECB and the Eurosystem" />  To the extent that the banks authorized to borrow from the ECB have compromised collateral, their ability to borrow from the ECB<U+2014>and thus the liquidity of the economic system<U+2014>is impaired.<ref name="The ECB and the Eurosystem" />  This threat has drawn the ECB into rescue operations.<ref name="The ECB and the Eurosystem" />  But weak sovereign debt is not the only source of weakness in the ECB's operations, as the collapse of the market in U.S. dollar denominated [[collateralized debt obligations]] has also led to large scale interventions in cooperation with the Federal Reserve.<ref name="The ECB and the Eurosystem" />

Rescue operations involving sovereign debt have included temporarily moving bad or weak assets off the balance sheets of the weak member banks into the balance sheets of the European Central Bank.<ref name="Greece and the fiscal crisis in the EMU">{{cite web | url=http://www.nber.org/~wbuiter/Greece.pdf | title=Greece and the fiscal crisis in the EMU | publisher=NBER | date=07-09-2010 | accessdate=October 30, 2011 | author=Buite, Willem}}</ref> Such action is viewed as [[monetization]] and can be seen as an inflationary threat, whereby the strong member countries of the ECB shoulder the burden of monetary expansion (and potential inflation) in order to save the weak member countries.<ref name="Greece and the fiscal crisis in the EMU" />  Most central banks prefer to move weak assets off their balance sheets with some kind of agreement as to how the debt will continue to be serviced.<ref name="Greece and the fiscal crisis in the EMU" />  This preference has typically led the ECB to argue that the weaker member countries must:
* Allocate considerable national income to servicing debts.<ref name="Greece and the fiscal crisis in the EMU" />
* scale back a wide range of national expenditures (such as education, infrastructure, and [[welfare]] transfer payments) in order to make their payments.<ref name="Greece and the fiscal crisis in the EMU" />

==== European Financial Stability Facility ====
On 9 May 2010, the 27 [[Member States of the European Union|member states]] of the [[European Union]] agreed to incorporate the European Financial Stability Facility.<ref name="Europa EFSF">{{cite web|url=http://www.efsf.europa.eu/about/index.htm |title=About EFSF|work=EFSF|publisher=efsf.europa.eu|date=9 May 2010|accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref> The EFSF<U+2019>s mandate is to safeguard financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to Eurozone Member States.<ref name="Europa EFSF"></ref> 

The European Financial Stability Facility is authorised to use the following instruments linked to appropriate conditionality:
* To provide loans to countries in financial difficulties, like in the event of Greece.<ref name="Europa EFSF"></ref>
* To intervene in the primary and secondary debt markets. Intervention in the secondary debt market will be only on the basis of an ECB analysis recognising the existence of exceptional financial market circumstances and risks to financial stability.<ref name="Europa EFSF"></ref>
* Act on the basis of a precautionary programme.<ref name="Europa EFSF"></ref>
* Finance recapitalisations of financial institutions through loans to governments<ref name="Europa EFSF"></ref>

The EFSF is backed by guarantee commitments from the Eurozone Member States for a total of <U+20AC>780 billion and has a lending capacity of <U+20AC>440 billion.<ref name="Europa EFSF"></ref> It has been assigned the best possible credit rating (AAA by Standard & Poor<U+2019>s and Fitch Ratings, Aaa by Moody<U+2019>s)<ref name="Europa EFSF"></ref>

=== Powers and objectives during the European banking crisis ===
The European Central Bank had stepped up the buying of member nations debt.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/1202/1224284573209.html |title=Euro zone bonds rally after ECB debt buying |newspaper=Irish Times |date=December 2, 2010 }}</ref> In response to the crisis of 2010, some proposals have surfaced for a collective European bond issue that would allow the central bank to purchase a European version of U.S. [[Treasury Bills]].<ref name="Walker-20101217">{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Walker |title=Closer Fiscal Union: A Collective Guarantee |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=17 December 2010 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703395204576023784088914652.html }}</ref><ref name="Simon-20101207">{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Nixon |title=A Way Around European Bonds |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=7 December 2010 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704156304576003760628199904.html }}</ref> To make European sovereign debt assets more similar to a U.S. Treasury, a collective guarantee of the member states' solvency would be necessary.<ref>The European dilemma may be imagined as follows.  In the United States, if tax collections from California are weak, the total federal debt is financed through tax collections in other states, through federal taxes.  California may default on its state debt, but the federal government bypasses California in directly taxing California citizens to finance the federal debt.    There is only one legal authority taxing, paying for, and backing the federal debt.  Federal expenditures are determined by the federal government.  Therefore California cannot leverage more money out of the federal system other than by means of the normal constitutional procedures in the House and Senate. If the federal government transfers additional money to California it is because of federal policy, not because California's state debt is threatening the backing of the U.S. dollar.  Consider this hypothetical: If the U.S. federal reserve carried state debts on its balance sheets the system would be more similar to the ECB.  If California stated to default on its debt a hole would appear on the Fed's balance sheets where it carried California bonds.  To make good this loss, the Fed would have to raise capital from the more solvent states, giving rise to the political issue that California's "lack of responsibility" was forcing other states to jump in and save California's public debt.  This, one might worry, could turn into a license to California to ignore fiscal restraints and in effect transfer money from the "more responsible states" to the "least responsible states."  Even though California's state finances are faltering in 2010, this is not an issue for the Federal Reserve, because of the federal system of taxation and unified backing of the federal debt.  In Europe, the ECB could push for greater political and fiscal integration, which would make the member states more explicitly responsible for backing each others debts and potentially lead to greater political integration.  Speculative attacks on the sovereign debt that backs the euro have in effect revealed the weaknesses in the European Union's political and fiscal structure.</ref>  But the German government has resisted this proposal, and other analyses indicate that "the sickness of the Euro" is due to the linkage between sovereign debt and failing national banking systems.  If the European central bank were to deal directly with failing banking systems sovereign debt would not look as leveraged relative to national income in the financially weaker member states.<ref name="Simon-20101207" />

On 17 December 2010, the ECB announced that it was going to double its capitalization.<ref name="Walker-Forelle-20101217">{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Walker |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Charles |last2=Forelle |title=Bailout Deal Fails to Quell EU rifts |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=17 December 2010 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703395204576023732485094802.html }}</ref> (The ECB's most recent balance sheet before the announcement listed capital and reserves at <U+20AC>2.03&nbsp;trillion.)<ref name="Balance sheet">{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.int/stats/money/aggregates/bsheets/html/outstanding_amounts_L60.X.Z5.0000.en.html |title=Aggregated balance sheet of euro area monetary financial institutions, excluding the Eurosystem |work=ECB.int }}</ref> The sixteen central banks of the member states would transfer assets to the ledger of the ECB.

=== Independence ===
Furthermore, not only must the bank not seek influence, but EU institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ECB's independence. For example, the minimum term of office for a national central bank governor is five years and members of the executive board have a non-renewable eight-year term.<ref name="ECB Ind">{{cite web |title=Independence |publisher=European Central Bank |url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/independence/html/index.en.html |accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> To offer some accountability, the ECB is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Commission]], the [[Council of the European Union]] and the [[European Council]].<ref name="ECB Acc">{{cite web |title=Accountability |publisher=European Central Bank |url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html |accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> The European Parliament also gets to question and then issue its opinion on candidates to the executive board.<ref name="BF EB">{{cite web |title=Executive Board |publisher=[[Banque de France]] |year=2005 |url=http://www.banque-france.fr/gb/eurosys/telechar/europe/Directoire_GB.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref>

The bank's independence has notably come under intense criticism since the election of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] as [[President of France|French President]]. Sarkozy has sought to make the ECB more susceptible to political influence, to extend its mandate to focus on growth and job creation (at cost of [[inflation]]), and has frequently criticized the bank's policies on interest rates.<ref name="Tragedy of the Euro"></ref> As result of pressure from France and Greece, independence of ECB has been limited.<ref name="Tragedy of the Euro"></ref> The same has happened with [[Stability and Growth Pact]] that sets fiscal limits in the euro zone &mdash; these limits have been notoriously violated but no member country has been fined.<ref name="Tragedy of the Euro">{{cite book |title=Tragedy of the Euro |author=Philipp Bagus |date=2010 |format=PDF |isbn=9781610161183 |url=http://mises.org/books/bagus_tragedy_of_euro.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-28}}</ref>

==Organization==
Although the ECB is governed by European law directly and thus not by corporate law applying to private law companies, its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital. Its capital is five billion euros<ref>Article 28.1 of the ESCB Statute</ref> which is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders. The initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the states' population and GDP,<ref>Article 29 of the ESCB Statute</ref> but the key is adjustable.<ref>Article 28.5 of the ESCB Statute</ref> Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral.<ref>Article 28.4 of the ESCB Statute</ref>

All National Central Banks (NCBs) that own a share of the ECB capital stock as of 1 January 2011 are listed below. Non-Euro area NCBs are required to pay up only a very small percentage of their subscribed capital, which accounts for the different magnitudes of Euro area and Non-Euro area total paid-up capital.<ref>{{cite web|title=Capital Subscription|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/capital/html/index.en.html|publisher=European Central Bank|accessdate=11 June 2011}}</ref>

== European sovereign debt crisis ==
{{main|European sovereign debt crisis}}

From late 2009, fears of a [[sovereign debt crisis]] developed among fiscally conservative investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in [[2000s European sovereign debt crisis timeline|early 2010]].<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE61F0W720100216 |title= Peripheral euro zone government bond spreads widen |agency=Reuters   |author=George Matlock |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16009099 | title=Acropolis now | work=The Economist | date= 29 April 2010 |accessdate= 22 June 2011}}</ref> This included [[euro zone]] members [[Economy of Greece|Greece]],<ref name=wsj>{{Cite news| author=Brian Blackstone, Tom Lauricella, and Neil Shah | title = Global Markets Shudder: Doubts About U.S. Economy and a Debt Crunch in Europe Jolt Hopes for a Recovery |  work=The Wall Street Journal | date = 5 February 2010 | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704041504575045743430262982.html |accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref> [[Economy of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Economy of Portugal|Portugal]] and also some [[European Union|EU]] countries outside the area.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.thenewamerican.com/index.php/world-mainmenu-26/europe-mainmenu-35/3274-greek-debt-crisis-worsens | title= Greek Debt Crisis Worsens | author=Bruce Walker |date=9 April 2010 |publisher=[[The New American]] |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> [[Iceland]], the country which experienced the largest [[2008<U+2013>2011 Icelandic financial crisis|crisis in 2008]] when its entire international banking system collapsed has emerged less affected by the sovereign debt crisis as the government was unable to bail the banks out.

=== Causes ===
The principal monetary policy tool of the European central bank is collateralized borrowing or repo agreements.<ref name="Euro debt crisis">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/business/slide-show/slide-show-1-all-about-european-debt-crisis-in-simple-terms/20110819.htm |title=All about the European debt crisis: In SIMPLE terms|date=19 August 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011|work=rediff business|publisher=rediff.com}}</ref> These tools are also used by the United States Federal Reserve Bank, but the Fed does more direct purchasing of financial assets than its European counterpart.<ref name="US Open Market operations">{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html | title=Open Market Operation - Fedpoints - Federal Reserve Bank of New York | publisher=www.newyorkfed.org | work=Federal Reserve Bank of New York | date=August 2011 | accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref> The collateral used by the ECB is typically high quality public and private sector debt.<ref name="Euro debt crisis"></ref> The criteria for determining "high quality" for public debt have been preconditions for membership in the European Union: total debt must not be too large in relation to Gross Domestic Product, for example, and deficits in any given year must not become too large.<ref name="Euro debt working paper">{{cite web|url=http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/304/1/wp_2011_1_darvas.pdf |title=WORKING PAPER 2011 / 1 A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO THE EURO-AREA DEBT CRISIS|date=February 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011|work=Zsolt Darvas|publisher=Corvinus University of Budapest |format=PDF}}</ref> Though these criteria are fairly simple, but a number of accounting techniques may hide the underlying reality of fiscal solvency<U+2014>or the lack of same.<ref name="Euro debt working paper"></ref>

There are a variety of possible responses to the problem of bad debts in a banking system. One is to induce debtors to make a greater effort to make good on their debt.<ref name="Euro debt crisis"></ref> With public debt this usually means getting governments to maintain debt payments while cutting back on other forms of expenditure.<ref name="Euro debt crisis"></ref> Such policies often involve cutting back on popular social programs.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sabrina |last=Cohen |title=Italian Unions Criticize Austerity Plan |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=14 August 2011 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903392904576508253558418390.html }}</ref> Stringent policies with regard to social expenditures and employment in the state sector have led to riots and political protests in Greece.<ref>{{cite web |author=CNN Wire Staff |title=Greek austerity protests turn ugly as strike begins |date=28 June 2011 |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-06-28/world/greece.strike_1_police-and-protesters-stone-throwing-demonstrators-force-protesters?_s=PM:WORLD }}</ref> Another response is to shift losses from the central bank to private investors who are asked to "share the pain" of partial defaults that take the form of rescheduling debt payments.<ref name="Euro debt crisis"></ref> However, if the debt rescheduling causes losses on loans held by European banks, it weakens the private banking system, which then puts pressure on the central bank to come to the aid of those banks. Private sector bond holders are an integral part of the public and private banking system. Another possible response is for wealthy member countries to guarantee or purchase the debt of countries that have defaulted or are likely to default.<ref name="Euro debt crisis"></ref> This alternative requires that the tax revenues and credit of the wealthy member countries be used to refinance the previous borrowing of the weaker member countries, and is politically controversial.<ref>{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Castle |title=Euro Zone Seeks Deal on Greece |date=15 July 2011 |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/16/business/global/eu-leaders-to-meet-thursday-to-try-to-break-deadlock-on-greece.html }}</ref> Reluctance in Germany to take on the burden of financing or guaranteeing the debts of weaker countries has led to public reports that some elites in Germany would prefer to see Greece, Portugal, and even Italy leave the Euro zone "temporarily."<ref name="EwingAlderman2011">{{cite news |first=Jack |last=Ewing |first2=Liz |last2=Alderman |title=Some in Germany Want Greece to Temporarily Exit the Euro Zone |newspaper=New York Times |date=10 August 2011 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/business/global/greece-feels-push-toward-euro-exit.html }}</ref> However, Greek Euro zone exit was rejected by German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].<ref name = "Walker-Bisserbe-2011">{{cite news |first=Marcus|last=Walker|first2=Noemie| last2=Bisserbe|title=Merkel Lessens Fears Over Greece: German Leader Rejects Suggestions Athens Be Allowed to Default or Leave Currency Bloc, Reassuring Nervous Markets|newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=14 September 2011|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904265504576568693911614726.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection}}</ref>  

==== Bond purchase ====
The ECB could, and through the late summer of 2011 did, purchase bonds issued by the weaker states even though it assumes, in doing so, the risk of a deteriorating balance sheet.  ECB buying focused primarily on Spanish and Italian debt.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=McManus |first2=Dan |last2=O'Brien |title=Market rout as Berlin rejects call for more EU action |journal=Irish Times |date=5 August 2011 }}</ref> Certain techniques can minimize the impact. Purchases of Italian bonds by the central bank, for example, were intended to dampen international speculation and strengthen portfolios in the private sector and also the central bank.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Walker |first2=Damian |last2=Paletta |first3=Brian |last3=Blacksone |title=Global Crisis of Confidence World Policy Makers' Inability to Agree on Fixes Led Markets on Wild Ride |journal=Wall Street Journal |date=13 August 2011 |url= }}</ref> The assumption is that speculative activity will decrease over time and the value of the assets increase. Such a move is similar to what the U.S. federal reserve did in buying subprime mortgages in the crisis of 2008, except in the European crisis, the purchases are of member state debt. The risk of such a move is that it could diminish the value of the currency.<ref name="Euro debt working paper"></ref> On the other hand, certain financial techniques can reduce the impact of such purchases on the currency.<ref name="Euro debt working paper"></ref> One is [[Sterilization (economics)|sterilization]], wherein highly valued assets are sold at the same time that the weaker assets are purchased, which keeps the money supply neutral.<ref name="Euro debt working paper"></ref> Another technique is simply to accept the bad assets as long-term collateral (as opposed to short-term repo swaps) to be held until their market value stabilizes. This would imply, as a quid pro quo, adjustments in taxation and expenditure in the economies of the weaker states to improve the perceived value of the assets.<ref name="Euro debt working paper"></ref>
