Towards his last years of his term and during the first half of his son's reign as the Sultan of Johor, limited recognition was given by a few nobles<ref>Aruna Gopinath, ''Pahang, 1880-1933: A Political History'', pg 23 Bendahara Ali was one of the first few rulers to adjust himself to the new situation and gave Sultan Hussein of Singapore his due recognition...</ref> and the British were accorded mainly with the purpose of their own economic and political gains.<ref>Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941), pg 110-1</ref>

==Succession dispute==
The [[Johor Sultanate|Sultan of Johor-Riau]], Sultan Mahmud Shah III died in 1812 after reigning for more than fifty years, naming no formal heir to the throne. He left behind two sons with two different women, both of whom were of [[Bugis people|Buginese]] extraction. As the older son, Tengku Hussein lined in favour for succeeding his father in favour of his younger half-brother, Tengku Abdul Rahman by primogeniture.<ref>Turnbull, ''A Short History of Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei'', pg 97</ref> Tengku Hussein, however, was away in [[Pahang]] at the time of his father's demise.

The Bugis faction, led by the underking Yamtuan Muda Raja Ja'afar supported Tengku Abdul Rahman to succeed the throne and hastily organised a coronation ceremony before Tengku Hussein was able to return. Raja Ja'afar, in exchange for his support for Tengku Abdul Rahman (now Sultan), was appointed as the empire's regent and wielded administrative authority.<ref>Trocki, ''Prince of Pirates: The Temenggongs and the Development of Johor and Singapore, 1784-1885'', pg 36</ref> Tengku Hussein stayed on in Pahang and waited for the monsoon winds to arrive, and was unaware of his brother's installation as the Sultan, although Raja Ja'afar had written a letter to Tengku Hussein notifying him of Sultan Mahmud's death, but details in the letter were modified to shield Tengku Hussein of his brother's ascension as the Sultan. Correspondence was returned to Lingga that he was installed as the Sultan by Bendahara Tun Ali during his stay in Pahang. Tengku Hussein sailed back to [[Lingga Islands|Lingga]] when the monsoon winds arrived, and was received by Sultan Abdul Rahman who had offered to abdicate in favour of Tengku Hussein, but he quickly backtracked after Raja Ja'afar made his threats against Sultan Abdul Rahman.<ref>Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941), pg 77</ref>

Questions pertaining to the legitimacy of Sultan Abdul Rahman's reign were raised; the royal regalia were still in the hands of Engku Putri Hamidah, the primary consort of the late Sultan Mahmud Shah III who had stated her choice of seeing Tengku Hussein to succeed to the throne. In addition, Tengku Hussein also had the support of the [[Temenggong]] and the Malay nobles, which made the prospect of putting a legitimate successor in place difficult.<ref>Trocki, ''Singapore: Wealth, Power and the Culture of Control'', pg 82</ref>

Sultan Abdul Rahman devoted himself increasingly to religion; he had delegated all administrative duties to Raja Ja'afar by the time [[William Farquhar]] approached the Sultan to secure an alliance with the British in an attempt to reduce [[Netherlands|Dutch]] influence in the region.<ref>Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941), pg 90</ref>

==Founding of modern Singapore==
===1819 treaty===
In 1818, Sir [[Stamford Raffles]] was appointed as the governor of [[Bencoolen]] on western [[Sumatra]]. He was convinced that the British needed to establish a new base in [[Southeast Asia]] in order to compete with the Dutch. Many in the [[British East India Company]] opposed such idea but Raffles managed to convince [[Lord Hastings]] of the Company, then Governor General of [[British India]], to side with him. With the governor general's consent, he and his expedition set out to search for a new base.<ref name="uslcFounding">{{cite web | title = Singapore - Founding and Early Years | url = http://countrystudies.us/singapore/4.htm | publisher = U.S. Library of Congress  | accessdate = 2006-07-18 }}</ref>

Raffles' expedition arrived in Singapore on 29 January 1819. He discovered a small Malay settlement at the mouth of [[Singapore River]] headed by a [[Temenggung]] (governor) of Johor. Though the island was nominally ruled by the sultanate, the political situation there was extremely murky. The incumbent  Sultan, Tengku Abdul Rahman, was under the influence of the Dutch and the Bugis and would therefore never agree to a British base in [[Singapore]].

Upon learning of these Johor political tensions, Raffles made a deal with Hussein Shah. Their agreement stated that the British would acknowledge Hussein Shah as the legitimate ruler of Johor, and thus Tengku Hussein and the Temenggung would receive a yearly stipend from the British.  In return, Tengku Hussein would allow Raffles to establish a trading post in Singapore. This treaty was ratified on 6 February 1819.<ref>{{cite web| title = 1819 - The February Documents | publisher = [[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)]] | date = 1997-02-07 | accessdate = 2006-07-18 | author = Jenny Ng | url = http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/the_early_years/v01n02b_history.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Milestones in Singapore's Legal History | publisher = [[Supreme Court, Singapore]] | accessdate = 2006-07-18 |  url = http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=39l}}</ref>

===1824 Anglo-Dutch treaty===
With the Temenggung's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Hussein Shah, then living in exile on one of the Riau Islands, back into Singapore. The Dutch were extremely displeased with Raffles' action. Tensions between the Dutch and British over Singapore persisted until 1824, until they signed the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]]. Under the terms of that treaty, the Dutch officially withdrew their opposition to the British presence in Singapore.<ref>{{cite web | title = Establishment of Singapore | url =  http://www.spm.org.sg/exhibition/kings_queens/index.html | publisher = Singapore Philatelic Museum }}</ref> The treaty has the effect of carving the Johor Empire into two spheres of influence; modern Johor under the British and the new Sultanate of [[Riau]] under the Dutch. The treaty was concluded in London, between the British and the Dutch, effectively break up of the Johor-Riau Empire into two.<ref name="Wins95">Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941), pg 95</ref>

==Later years and death==
The British successfully sidelined Dutch political influence by proclaiming Sultan Hussein as the Sultan of Johor and Singapore to acquire legal recognition in their sphere of influence in Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia. The legitimacy of Sultan Hussein's proclamation as the Sultan of Johor and Singapore, was by all accounts not recognised by the Malay rulers and his title only served as a nominal title. Temenggong Abdul Rahman's position, on the other hand, was strengthened as the signing of the treaties detached him the influence of Raja Ja'afar.<ref>Ministry of Culture (Publicity Division), Singapore; Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore., ''Singapore: A Ministry of Culture Publication'', pg 24</ref> The Dutch took the bold initiative of taking the royal regalia from Engku Putri Hamidah by force after hearing of rumours of Sultan Hussein requesting British aid to get hold of the regalia.<ref>Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941), pg 84</ref> In November 1822, Sultan Abdul Rahman was installed as the Sultan of Lingga, complete with the royal regalia.<ref>Trocki, ''Prince of Pirates: The Temenggongs and the Development of Johor and Singapore, 1784-1885'', pg 108</ref>

In the later part of his reign, growing British influence pressurised some Malay nobles, particularly Bendahara Ali to grant recognition to Sultan Hussein's legitimacy.<ref>Tate, ''The Making of Modern South-East Asia'', pg 134 .....Timmerman Thyssen, expressing his amazement at a fate which separated father from son, brother from brother, and friend from friend. He also declared that he continued to recognize Sultan Abdul Rahamn of Riau as his overlord, and his seal diplomatically styled him as the representative of the late Sultan Mahmud! In the same year he refused to allow the British flag to be flown in Pahang. Later, as the situation became clearer, Bendahara Ali modified his attitude and apparently accorded his recognition to Sultan Husain as well, and in 1841 Husain's son and heir asked to come to Pahang to be installed as the new sultan by the Bendahara. In 1853 the Bendahara felt sufficiently sure of his position to have himself proclaimed as an independent ruler, although the fiction of Johore's sovereignty was allowed to continue up till 1864.</ref> Sultan Abdul Rahman, who had devoted himself to religion, became contented with his political sphere of influence in Lingga, where his family continued to maintain his household under the administrative direction<ref>Bastin, Winks, ''Malaysia: Selected Historical Readings'', pg 132 Though in 1818 Major Farquhar had signed a treaty with the Underking of Riau by virtue of powers granted him by 'Abdu'r- Rahman Sultan of Johor, Pahang and dependencies, and though in his letter suggesting the Carimons (Karimun) for a port he had again referred to 'Abdu'r-Rahman as emperor, he now conveniently remembered that the potentate had deprecated being called ruler of the Johor empire and had declared that he was Sultan of Lingga only. So aware that under Dutch surveillance neither Sultan 'Abdu'r-Rahman of Lingga nor the Underking at Riau would be able to convey any rights at Singapore to the British,...</ref> of Raja Ja'afar who ruled under the auspices of the Dutch.<ref>Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, ''Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society'', pg 57</ref> However, unresolved legal ambiguity in the legitimacy various local affairs, such as the status of Johor and Pahang, which was the [[de jure]] property of the Dutch-aligned Sultan Abdul Rahman and his successors, yet the 1824 treaty would not allow Sultan Abdul Rahman to exert political authority over Johor and Pahang.<ref>Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941), pg 112</ref> In the light of these circumstances, the Temenggong and Bendahara to increasingly exert their independent authority. Also, largely as a result of the strong British influence in the Malay Peninsula, the continuously changing political dynamics gradually relegated these legitimacy disputes. (In 1857, the Sultan of Lingga, Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah, who was also [[de jure]] head of the royal house of Johor, Pahang and Lingga, made a vociferous claim to his legitimacy of as the rightful ruler of these states and briefly sparked off a civil war in Pahang.<ref>Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941), pg 116</ref>)

Sultan Hussein on his part, did not pursue any active claim to his sovereignty rights over Johor, even after Temenggong Abdul Rahman died in 1825, and his successor, Temenggong Ibrahim was still a youth at the time of Temenggong Abdul Rahman's passing.<ref>Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941), pg 106</ref> Sultan Hussein spent much of his time at his Singapore residence in [[Istana Kampong Glam]] until 1834, when he moved to [[Malacca]]. Reports cited that he was a dispirited man, apparently with the lack of power and authority that he should be accorded as the Sultan.<ref>David Brazil, ''Street Smart Singapore'', pg 231</ref>  Sultan Hussein later died in September 1835, and was buried in Tranquera Mosque at the wishes of his Sultanah and Abdul Kadir, a Tamil-Muslim Imam.<ref>Reports Service, by American Universities Field Staff, published by American Universities Field Studies, 1965, pg 20</ref>
