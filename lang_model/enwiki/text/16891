'''Scott Steven Neilson''' (born 15 May 1987) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[Conference Premier]] side [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]].

Neilson started his career alongside his brother, Tony, at first [[Hertford Town F.C.|Hertford Town]] and then [[Ware F.C.|Ware]], before he earned a move to [[Cambridge City F.C.|Cambridge City]]. He made his name in [[Non-League football|non-league]] as a goal-scoring winger and he came to the attention of a number of league clubs. He had trials with three of them and eventually won a move to [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]. He scored a goal on his full debut but Bradford soon changed manager and Neilson dropped back into non-league, first out on loan to [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] and then signed by [[Crawley Town F.C.|Crawley Town]], having spent less than 12&nbsp;months with Bradford. Neilson spent a short but successful loan spell with [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in 2012, and then joined Luton on a short-term contract in January 2013 before his release a few months later.
