'''June 2013 New Zealand winter storm''' was an intense extratropical cyclone which affected New Zealand on 20-22 June. The storm brought strong winds and high waves especially around the [[Wellington Region]], and further afield cold temperatures and heavy snow to the [[South Island]]. The storm was described by the New Zealand [[National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research]] (NIWA) as an extreme event.<ref name="NIWA21June"/> The maximum 10 minute average, sustained wind reading, recorded at Wellington airport was 101km/hour, with individual gusts up to 130-140 km/hour at this location.<ref name="NIWA21June"/> Winds were equivalent to the strength of a category 1 or 2 hurricane on the [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson hurricane wind scale]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Duncan|first=Philip|title=WeatherWatch: (June 21) Winter storm to ease this weekend|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/weather-watch/news/video.cfm?c_id=1501977&gal_cid=1501977&gallery_id=133664|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=21 June 2013}}</ref> Record wave heights of 15 m peak to trough were recorded by a buoy offshore from [[Baring Head]] in the [[Cook Strait]].<ref name="NIWA21June" />

==Meteorological history==
On 19 June a surface low pressure just to the northwest of the South Island and at the same time there was a southerly coming in with some cold air at the top of the atmosphere. "The whole thing developed as a massive low that started to move across the west of the South Island, then [20 June] it moved across [[Cook Strait]] to create a new low just east of [[Kaikoura]]... that was the real kick in pants that caused a clockwise circle of wind." -Associate Professor James Renwick at the School of Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences at Victoria University has researched how polar conditions affect our weather. "To get an event like this, which is pretty extreme, we need the westerly wind that normally blows across New Zealand and the southern oceans to slow down and to buckle into a series of big meanders, north-south waves around the hemisphere." The air was so cold over the country, temperatures dropped to -6<U+02DA>C in [[Tekapo]], because the [[Contour line#Barometric pressure|isobars]] stretched all the way to down to to the edge of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[sea ice]]".<ref>{{cite news|last=Wade|first=Amelia|title=Icy storm biggest in a decade|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10892208|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=22 June 2013}}</ref> This followed bad weather earlier in the month on the 4 June which saw winds up to 120km/h and torrential rain and flooding across the country.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hunt|first=Tom|title=Torrential rain, gales forecast|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/8752060/Torrential-rain-gales-forecast|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=The Dominion Post|date=04 June 2013}}</ref>

==Impacts==

High winds struck Central New Zealand on the night of 20 June and morning of 21 June. Wind gusts uprooted trees, ripped roofs off houses, smashed windows and flung trampolines into powerlines in Wellington, [[Kapiti Coast]] and [[Wairarapa]], closing roads and schools across the lower [[North Island]].<ref name="Duff">{{cite news|last=Duff|first=Michelle|title=Thousands remain powerless after storm|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/8827857/Thousands-remain-powerless-after-storm|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=The Dominion Post|date=22 June 2013|author2=Sam Boyer|author3=Shane Cowlishaw}}</ref> The [[New Zealand Fire Service|Fire Service]] received 932 emergency calls for help in the lower North Island in the 12 hours to 6am 21 June.<ref name="National">{{cite news|title=Major storm mop-up gets under way|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8823953/Major-storm-mop-up-gets-under-way|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=stuff.co.nz|date=21 June 2013}}</ref> During the Storm residents were advised to stay indoors and not go out by the City Council. Wellington City Council said they had received many reports of flying debris with multiple reports of trees and powerlines down, along with broken windows and structural damage. In the suburb of Kingston a house lost its roof. Radio New Zealand listeners reported that roofing iron was blowing about on roads in Newtown. Emergency services said they were very busy during the storm. The Northern Police Communications Centre said 90% of the calls it received couldn't be answered by its overloaded central branch based in Wellington.<ref name="RNZNwinds">{{cite news|title=Severe winds lash Wellington|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/138169/severe-winds-lash-wellington|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Radio New Zealand News|date=20 June 2013}}</ref>

Ocean waves measuring {{convert|15|m|ft}} from trough to peak were recorded from a buoy about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) out to sea, near Wellington by NIWA.<ref name="NIWA21June" /> The waves washed away parts of some coastal roads and seawalls, and were the largest recorded near the capital since measurements began in 1995.<ref name="ABC">{{cite news|title=Winter Storm Disrupts Air Traffic in New Zealand|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/winter-storm-disrupts-air-traffic-zealand-19452346|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=Associated Press via ABC News|date=21 June 2013}}</ref> Localised coastal flooding also occurred in the Wellington suburbs of [[Island_Bay,_Wellington|Island Bay]], [[Seaview,_Wellington|Seaview]] and the city of [[Porirua]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Storm batters Wellington|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/image.cfm?c_id=1&gal_objectid=10891966&gallery_id=133660#11507833|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=21 June 2013}}</ref> In [[Lower Hutt]] the local council estimated a cost of $100,000 NZD to remove debris washed up on the [[Petone]] foreshore when parts of the wall were smashed by the storm surge.

The [[Hawkes Bay]] region saw destructive winds, with a peak gust of 80km/h recorded at [[Hawkes Bay Airport]] on 21 June. Police and council workers spent much of the following weekend cleaning up after the storm, most of which involved uprooted trees and blocked roads. Hawke's Bay Civil Defence manager Trevor Mitchell said the region had got off "pretty lightly" compared to other parts of the country, though some areas suffered localised surface flooding.<ref name="Hurley">{{cite news|last=Hurley|first=Sam|title=Trees fell as storm hammered Hawke's Bay|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10892616|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|date=24 June 2013}}</ref> 

The Insurance Council of New Zealand says the storm could be the biggest weather event, insurance-wise, in the lower North Island since the 2004 [[Manawatu River]] floods.<ref name="NZH">{{cite news|title=Winter storm finally starts to ease|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10892125|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=21 June 2013}}</ref> Measurements placed the storm in the same category as five other major storms recorded in 1961, 1965, 1967, 1974, 1977 and 1985.<ref name="NIWA21June" />
