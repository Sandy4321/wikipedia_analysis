[[Image:Caged bird2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cover from the first edition of ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' (1969)]]

'''''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings''''' is the 1969 [[autobiography]] about the early years of writer and activist [[Maya Angelou]]. The first in a six-volume series, it is a [[Bildungsroman|coming-of-age story]] that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome [[racism]] and trauma.  The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to [[Stamps, Arkansas]] to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 17.  In the course of ''Caged Bird'', Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to racism.

Angelou was challenged by her friend, author [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], and her editor, [[Robert Loomis]], to write an autobiography that was also a piece of literature.  Because Angelou uses thematic development and other techniques common to fiction, reviewers often categorize ''Caged Bird'' as [[autobiographical fiction]], but the prevailing critical view characterizes it as an autobiography, a genre she attempts to critique, change, and expand.  The book covers topics common to autobiographies written by black American women in the years following the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights movement]]: a celebration of black motherhood; a critique of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.

Angelou uses her autobiography to explore subjects such as identity, rape, racism, and literacy.  She also writes in new ways about women's lives in a male-dominated society.  Maya, the younger version of Angelou and the book's central character, has been called "a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America".<ref name="Tate, p. 150">Tate, [http://books.google.com/books?id=yyL8oVg5qKUC&dq=Braxton+Angelou&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=4A4T2SHgj7&sig=Y43m-18r9tbEabOQQmzerGeJWpU&hl=en&ei=xe27SaaZJ5KasAPDn9A9&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result#PPA150,M1 p. 150]</ref>  Angelou's description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the book, although it is presented briefly in the text.  Rape is used as a metaphor for the suffering of her race.  Another metaphor, that of a bird struggling to escape its cage, is a central image throughout the work, which consists of "a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression".<ref name="protest"/>  Angelou's treatment of racism delivers a thematic unity to the book.  Literacy, and seizing the power of words, help young Maya cope with her bewildering world; books become her refuge as she works through her trauma.  

''Caged Bird'' was nominated for a [[National Book Award]] in 1970 and remained on [[New York Times bestseller list|''The New York Times'' paperback bestseller list]] for two years. It has been used in educational settings from high schools to universities, and the book has been celebrated for creating new literary avenues for the American memoir. However, the book's graphic depiction of childhood rape, racism, and sexuality have caused it to be challenged or banned in some schools and libraries.

==Background==

[[Image:Paul Laurence Dunbar.jpg|thumb|right|The book's title comes from a poem by African American poet [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]].  The caged bird, a symbol for the chained slave, is an image Angelou uses throughout all her writings.<ref>Lupton, p. 66</ref>]]

Before writing ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' Angelou had a long and varied career, holding jobs such as fry cook, dancer, actress, poet, educator, and even brothel madame.<ref name="songbird"/>  In the late 1950s, she joined the [[Harlem Writers Guild]], where she met a number of important African American authors, including her friend and mentor [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]].  After hearing civil rights leader [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] speak for the first time in 1960, she was inspired to join the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|Civil Rights movement]]. She organized several benefits for him, and he named her Northern Coordinator of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]].  She next worked for several years in [[Ghana]], West Africa, as a journalist, actress, and educator.   She was invited back to the US by [[Malcolm X]] to work for him shortly before his assassination in 1965.<ref name="poetry"/>  In 1968, King asked her to organize a march, but [[Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination|he too was assassinated]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Younge | first = Gary | title = No surrender | work = The Guardian | date = 2002-05-25 | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/biography/story/0,,720909,00.html | accessdate = 2007-10-10 }}</ref>  

The assassinations were "particularly painful" for Angelou because she had agreed to work for both men shortly before their deaths.<ref name="poetry"/> King died on her birthday, leaving her so devastated that she refused to celebrate it for many years.<ref>{{cite news | last = John-Hall | first = Annette | title = A global giant, Maya Angelou continues to live her message of inclusion | work = The Philadelphia Inquirer | date = 2008-11-16 | url = http://www.philly.com/inquirer/entertainment/20081116_A_global_giant__she_continues_to_live_her_message_of_inclusion_.html?viewAll=y | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}</ref>  She was deeply depressed in the months following King's assassination, so to help lift her spirits, Baldwin brought her to a dinner party at the home of cartoonist [[Jules Feiffer]] and his wife Judy in late 1968.<ref name="letters">{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Dinitia | title = A career in letters, 50&nbsp;years and counting | work = The New York Times | date = 2007-01-23 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/books/23loom.html | accessdate = 2007-10-23}}</ref>  The guests began telling stories of their childhoods and Angelou's stories impressed Judy Feiffer.

Although she did not intend to compose a series of autobiographies,<ref name="poetry"/> Angelou later wrote five additional volumes, covering a variety of her young adult experiences.  They are distinct in style and narration, but unified in their themes and stretch from Arkansas to Africa, from the beginnings of [[World War II]] to King's assassination.<ref name="Lupton, p. 1">Lupton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nBsaFf4qzRQC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPA1,M1 p. 1]</ref>  Like those of ''Caged Bird'', the events in these books are episodic and crafted as a series of short stories, yet do not follow a strict chronology. Later books in the series include ''[[Gather Together in My Name]]'' (1974), ''[[Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas]]'' (1976), ''[[The Heart of a Woman]]'' (1981), ''[[All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes]]'' (1986), and ''[[A Song Flung Up To Heaven]]'' (2002).  Critics have often judged Angelou's subsequent autobiographies "in light of the first", and ''Caged Bird'' generally receives the highest praise.<ref name="poetry"/>

Angelou describes her writing process as regimented.<ref name="poetry"/>  Beginning with ''Caged Bird'', she has used the same "writing ritual" for many years.<ref>Lupton, p. 15</ref> She gets up at five in the morning and checks into a hotel room, where the staff has been instructed to remove any pictures from the walls.  She writes on legal pads while lying on the bed, with only a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play [[solitaire]], ''[[Roget's Thesaurus]]'', and the [[Bible]], and leaves by the early afternoon.  She averages 10<U+2013>12 pages of material a day, which she edits down to three or four pages in the evening.<ref>{{cite book | last = Sarler | first = Carol | editor = Jeffrey M.

She has stated, "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I<U+2019>m in it<U+2014>ha!  It<U+2019>s so delicious!"

===Title===
When selecting a title, Angelou turned to [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], an African American poet whose works she had admired for years. With [[Shakespeare]], she has credited Dunbar with forming her "writing ambition".<ref>Tate, p. 158</ref> The title of the book comes from the third stanza of his poem "Sympathy": 

<blockquote>I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,<br/>When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,<br/>When he beats his bars and would be free;<br/>It is not a carol of joy or glee,<br/>But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,<br/>But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings <U+2013><br/> I know why the caged bird sings.<ref>{{cite book | last = Dunbar | first = Paul Laurence | editor = Joanne M.

==Plot summary==

{{see also|List of characters in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings}}

''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' follows Marguerite's (called "My" or "Maya" by her brother) life from the age of three to seventeen and the struggles she faces <U+2013> particularly with [[racism]] <U+2013> in the [[Southern United States]].  Abandoned by their parents, Maya and her older brother Bailey are sent to live with their paternal grandmother (Momma) and crippled uncle (Uncle Willie) in [[Stamps, Arkansas]].  Maya and Bailey are haunted by their parents' abandonment throughout the book <U+2013> they travel alone and are labeled like baggage.<ref>Bloom, p. 19</ref>

[[Image:Lafayette County Arkansas Incorporated and Unincorporated areas Stamps Highlighted.svg|thumb|right|The community of [[Stamps, Arkansas]] is the setting for most of the book.]]

Many of the problems Maya encounters in her childhood stem from the overt racism of her white neighbors.  Although Momma is relatively wealthy because she owns the general store at the heart of Stamps' black community, the white children of their town hassle Maya's family relentlessly.  One of these "powhitetrash" girls, for example, reveals her pubic hair to Momma in a humiliating incident.  Early in the book, Momma hides Uncle Willie in a vegetable bin to protect him from [[Ku Klux Klan]] raiders.  Maya has to endure the insult of her name being changed to Mary by a racist employer.  A white speaker at her eighth grade graduation ceremony disparages the black audience by suggesting that they have limited job opportunities.  A white dentist refuses to treat Maya's rotting tooth, even when Momma reminds him that she had loaned him money during the [[Great Depression|Depression]].  The black community of Stamps enjoys a moment of racial victory when they listen to the radio broadcast of [[Joe Louis]]'s championship fight, but generally they feel the heavy weight of racist oppression.

A turning point in the book occurs when Maya and Bailey's father unexpectedly appears in Stamps. He takes the two children with him when he departs, but leaves them with their mother in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  Eight-year-old Maya is sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, Mr. Freeman.  He is found guilty during the trial, but escapes jail time and is murdered, probably by Maya's uncles.  Maya feels guilty and withdraws from everyone but her brother.  Even after returning to Stamps, Maya remains reclusive and nearly mute until she meets Mrs. Bertha Flowers, "the aristocrat of Black Stamps",<ref>Angelou, p. 93</ref> who supplies her with books to encourage her love of reading. This coaxes Maya out of her shell.

Later, Momma decides to send her grandchildren to their mother in [[San Francisco, California]], to protect them from the dangers of racism in Stamps.  Maya attends [[George Washington High School (San Francisco)|George Washington High School]] and studies dance and drama on a scholarship at the California Labor School.  Before graduating, she becomes the first black female [[streetcar]] conductor in San Francisco.  While still in high school, Maya visits her father in southern California one summer, and has some experiences pivotal to her development.  She drives a car for the first time when she must transport her intoxicated father home from an excursion to Mexico.  She experiences homelessness for a short time after a fight with her father's girlfriend.

During Maya's final year of high school, she worries that she might be a [[lesbian]] (which she equates with being a [[hermaphrodite]]), and initiates sexual intercourse with a teenage boy.  She becomes pregnant, and on the advice of her brother, she hides from her family until her eighth month of pregnancy in order to graduate from high school.  Maya gives birth at the end of the book and begins her journey to adulthood by accepting her role as mother to her newborn son.

==Style and genre==

[[File:Richard Wright.jpg|thumb|left|Like [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s novel ''[[Native Son]]'', ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' has been classified as a ''[[Bildungsroman]]''.]]

''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' has been called a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' or coming-of-age story.  Although ''Caged Bird'' is an [[autobiography]], critic Mary Jane Lupton compares it to [[George Eliot|George Eliot's]] novel ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]''.  According to Lupton, the two books share the following similarities: a focus on young strong-willed heroines who have solid relationships with their brothers, an examination of the role of literature in life, and an emphasis on the importance of family and community life.<ref name="p. 30">Lupton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nBsaFf4qzRQC&pg=PA30&sig=ACfU3U0bU-xPvz1pTLgPGdf30Cj2T7k12A p. 30]</ref>  Angelou's book also continues the tradition of African American autobiography.  Like [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright's]] ''[[Native Son]]'', the protagonist in ''Caged Bird'' serves as an example of how a young African American can survive.  As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's.<ref>{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Susan | editor = Joanne M. Braxton | title = Maya Angelou's I know why the caged bird sings: A casebook | year = 1999 | publisher = Oxford Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-1951-1606-2 | pages = 104<U+2013>105 | chapter = Paths to Escape}}</ref> 

Angelou made a deliberate attempt while writing ''Caged Bird'' to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre.<ref>Lupton, p.98</ref><ref name="poetry"/> Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development often lead reviewers to categorize her books as [[autobiographical fiction]].<ref>Lupton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nBsaFf4qzRQC&pg=PA30&sig=ACfU3U0bU-xPvz1pTLgPGdf30Cj2T7k12A pp. 29<U+2013>30]</ref>  Lupton insists that all of Angelou's autobiographies conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme.<ref>Lupton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nBsaFf4qzRQC&pg=PA30&sig=ACfU3U0bU-xPvz1pTLgPGdf30Cj2T7k12A#PPA32,M1 p. 32]</ref>  In a 1983 interview with African American literature critic Claudia Tate, Angelou calls her books autobiographies.<ref>Tate, p.153</ref>

When speaking of her use of autobiography, Angelou acknowledges that she has followed the [[slave narrative]] tradition of "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'".<ref name="poetry"/>  Throughout the story she uses the [[First-person narrative|first-person narrative voice]] customary with autobiographies, but also includes fiction-like elements, told from the perspective of a child that is "artfully recreated by an adult narrator".<ref>Lupton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nBsaFf4qzRQC&pg=PA52&sig=ACfU3U1qtk4nFWPr_vUjBv9xGbv4dlQvQg p. 52]</ref>  She uses two distinct voices, the adult writer and the child who is the focus of the book, whom Angelou calls "the Maya character".  Angelou reports that maintaining the distinction between herself and "the Maya character" is "damned difficult", but "very necessary".<ref name="Tate, p. 150"/>  Scholar Liliane Arensberg suggests that Angelou "retaliates for the tongue-tied child's helpless pain" by using her adult's [[irony]] and wit.<ref>Arensberg, p. 114</ref> 

Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to her books <U+2013> she tends to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth".<ref>Lupton, p. 34</ref>  Her approach parallels the conventions of many African American autobiographies written during the [[abolitionist]] period in the US, when truth was often censored for purposes of self-protection.<ref>Sartwell, p. 26</ref>  In a 1998 interview with journalist [[George Plimpton]], Angelou discussed her writing process, and "the sometimes slippery notion of truth in nonfiction" and memoirs.<ref name="journalism">{{cite journal | last = Rogers | first = Ronald R. | title = Journalism: The democratic craft | journal = Newspaper Research Journal | date = Spring 2006 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3677/is_200604/ai_n19197231 | accessdate = 2008-08-30}}</ref>  When asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she stated, "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about."<ref name="journalism"/>

Scholar Joanne M. Braxton sees ''Caged Bird'' as a representative example of the autobiographies written by African American women in the years following the civil rights movement.  The book presents themes that are common in autobiography by black American women: a celebration of black motherhood; a criticism of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.<ref>Braxton (2004), p. 64</ref>  Angelou introduces a unique point of view in American autobiography by revealing her life story through a narrator who is a black female, at some points a child, and other points a mother.<ref>Lupton, pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref>  Writer [[Hilton Als]] calls Angelou one of the "pioneers of self-exposure", willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices.<ref name="songbird"/>  For example, while Angelou was composing her second autobiography, ''[[Gather Together in My Name]]'', she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure that she had been a prostitute.  Her husband Paul Du Feu talked her into publishing the book by encouraging her to "tell the truth as a writer" and to "be honest about it".<ref>Lupton, p. 14</ref>

==Themes==
As critic Pierre A. Walker notes, when Angelou wrote ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' at the end of the 1960s, one of the necessary and accepted features of literature was thematic unity, and one of Angelou's goals was to create a book that satisfied this criterion.  The structure of the text, which resembles a series of short stories, is not chronological but rather thematic. Walker believes that Angelou succeeded in emphasizing identity, racism, rape, and literacy, despite the narrative's episodic quality.<ref name="protest"/>  

===Identity===
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:25%; float:right; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">The Black female is assaulted in her tender years by all those common forces of nature at the same time that she is caught in the tripartite crossfire of male prejudice, white illogical hate and Black lack of power.
<p align=right>Maya Angelou, ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings''<ref>Angelou, p. 265</ref></blockquote>

In the course of ''Caged Bird'', Maya, who has been described as "a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America",<ref name="Tate, p. 150"/> goes from being a victim of racism with an inferiority complex to a self-aware individual who responds to racism with dignity and a strong sense of her own identity.  [[Feminist literary criticism|Feminist scholar]] Maria Lauret states that the "formation of female cultural identity" is woven into the book's narrative, setting Maya up as "a role model for Black women".<ref>Lauret, [http://books.google.com/books?id=xK_Pv0fc2L8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Maria+Lauret%22&sig=ACfU3U25UlxbmmPoh_0dAkxyMSztTDYCtg#PPA97,M1 p. 97]</ref>  African American literature scholar Dolly McPherson states that Angelou, in her demonstration of the passage from childhood to young adulthood, creatively uses "the Christian myth" and presents the themes of death, regeneration, and rebirth.<ref name="McPherson 1999, p. 26"/>  Scholar Liliane Arensberg calls this presentation Angelou's "identity theme" and a major motif in Angelou's narrative.  Maya's unsettled life in ''Caged Bird'' suggests her sense of self "as perpetually in the process of becoming, of dying and being reborn, in all its ramifications".<ref>Arensberg, p. 115</ref>

As Lauret indicates, Angelou and other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s used the autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society.  Lauret sees a connection between  Angelou's autobiographies, which Lauret calls "fictions of subjectivity" and "feminist first-person narratives", and fictional first-person narratives (such as ''[[The Women's Room]]'' by [[Marilyn French]] and ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'' by [[Doris Lessing]]) written during the same period.  Both genres employ the narrator as [[protagonist]] and "rely upon the illusion of presence in their mode of signification".<ref>Lauret, [http://books.google.com/books?id=xK_Pv0fc2L8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Maria+Lauret%22&sig=ACfU3U25UlxbmmPoh_0dAkxyMSztTDYCtg#PPA98,M1 p. 98]</ref>  

As a displaced girl, Maya's pain is worsened by an awareness of her displacement.  She is "the forgotten child", and must come to terms with "the unimaginable reality" of being unloved and unwanted;<ref name="McPherson 1999, p. 26">McPherson (1999), p. 26</ref> she lives in a hostile world that defines beauty in terms of whiteness and that rejects her simply because she is a black girl.  Maya internalizes the rejection she has experienced <U+2013> her belief in her own ugliness was "absolute".<ref name="McPherson 1999, p. 24">McPherson (1999), p. 24</ref>  McPherson believes that the concept of family, or what Lupton called "kinship concerns",<ref>Lupton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nBsaFf4qzRQC&pg=PA11&sig=ACfU3U2qrcqhRJZDovWZKkbGA1Kg4G2AoQ p. 11]</ref> in Angelou's books must be understood in the light of the children's displacement at the beginning of ''Caged Bird''.<ref>McPherson (1990), p. 14</ref>  Being sent away from their parents was a psychological rejection, and resulted in a quest for love, acceptance, and self-worth for both Maya and Bailey.<ref>Smith, p. 52</ref>

[[Image:Angeloupoem.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maya Angelou|Angelou]] (shown here in 1993, reciting her poem, "On the Pulse of Morning", at President [[Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's]] inauguration) demonstrates an evolution of female identity throughout her autobiographical works.]]

Lauret agrees with other scholars that Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities throughout her books to illustrate how oppression and personal history are interrelated. For example, in ''Caged Bird'', Angelou demonstrates the "racist habit"<ref>Lauret, [http://books.google.com/books?id=xK_Pv0fc2L8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Maria+Lauret%22&sig=ACfU3U25UlxbmmPoh_0dAkxyMSztTDYCtg#PPA97,M1 p. 97]</ref> of renaming African Americans, as shown when her white employer insists on calling her "Mary".  Angelou describes the employer's renaming as the "hellish horror of being 'called out of [one's] name'".<ref>Angelou, p. 91</ref>  Scholar Debra Walker King calls it a racist insult and an assault against Maya's race and self-image.<ref>King, p. 189</ref>  According to scholar Sidonie Ann Smith, the renaming emphasizes Maya's feelings of inadequacy and denigrates her identity, individuality, and uniqueness.  Maya understands that she is being insulted and rebels by breaking Mrs. Cullinan's favorite dish.<ref>Smith, p. 53</ref>

An incident in the book that solidifies Maya's identity is her trip to Mexico with her father, when she has to drive a car for the first time.  Contrasted with her experience in Stamps, Maya is finally "in control of her fate".<ref name="smith">Smith, p. 54</ref>  This experience is central to Maya's growth, as is the incident that immediately follows it, her short period of homelessness after arguing with her father's girlfriend.  These two incidents give Maya a knowledge of self-determination and confirm her self-worth.<ref name="smith"/>  

Beginning in ''Caged Bird'', motherhood is a "prevailing theme"<ref name="poetry">{{cite web | url = http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=180 | title = Maya Angelou | publisher = Poetry Foundation | accessdate = 2007-10-25}}</ref> in Angelou's autobiographies.  Scholar Mary Burgher believes that female black autobiographers like Angelou have debunked the stereotypes of African American mothers as "breeder and matriarch", and have presented them as having "a creative and personally fulfilling role".<ref>Burgher, p. 115</ref>  Lupton believes that Angelou's plot construction and character development were influenced by the same mother/child motif found in the work of [[Harlem Renaissance]] poet [[Jessie Fauset]].<ref>Lupton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nBsaFf4qzRQC&pg=PA49&sig=ACfU3U0SR3WP61UVW9BIUY7YdkcF-kxqOA p. 49]</ref>  For the first five years of her life, Maya thinks of herself as an orphan and finds comfort in the thought that her mother was dead.  Maya's feelings for and relationship with her own mother, whom she blames for her abandonment, express themselves in ambivalence and "repressed violent aggression".<ref>Arensberg, p. 118</ref>  For example, Maya and her brother destroy the first Christmas gifts sent by their mother.  These strong feelings are not resolved until the end of the book, when Maya becomes a mother herself, and her mother finally becomes the nurturing presence for which Maya has longed.<ref>Arensberg, p. 126</ref>

===Racism===

[[Image:Martin-Luther-King-1964-leaning-on-a-lectern.jpg|thumb|left|For several years before writing ''Caged Bird'', Angelou worked with [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] during the 1960s to combat racism.]]

Stamps, Arkansas, as depicted in ''Caged Bird'', has very little "social ambiguity": it is a racist world divided between black and white, male and female.<ref name="songbird">{{cite news | last = Als | first = Hilton | title = Songbird: Maya Angelou takes another look at herself | work = The New Yorker | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/08/05/020805crbo_books?currentPage=all | accessdate = 2002-08-05}}</ref>  Als characterizes the division as "good and evil", and notes how Angelou's witness of the evil in her society, "generally directed at black women", shaped Angelou's young life and informed her views into adulthood.<ref name="songbird"/>  Angelou uses the metaphor of a bird struggling to escape its cage, described in [[Paul Laurence Dunbar|Paul Laurence Dunbar's]] poem, as a central image throughout her series of autobiographies.<ref>Lupton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nBsaFf4qzRQC&pg=PA38&sig=ACfU3U2Ih0rkVvnJa2JG8rNcgsJ9pgBi6Q p. 38]</ref><ref name="difference"/>  Like elements within a prison narrative, the caged bird represents Angelou's confinement resulting from racism and oppression.<ref>Lupton, pp. 38<U+2013>39</ref>  The caged bird metaphor also invokes the "supposed contradiction of the bird singing in the midst of its struggle".<ref name="difference">{{cite web | last = Long | first = Richard | title = 35 who made a difference: Maya Angelou | publisher = Smithsonian.com | date = 2005-11-01 | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/10013086.html | accessdate = 2007-10-25}}</ref>

Critic Pierre A. Walker places Angelou's autobiography in the African American literature tradition of political protest.<ref name="protest"/>  ''Caged Bird'' has been called "perhaps the most aesthetically satisfying autobiography written in the years immediately following the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights]] era".<ref name="Braxton 1999, p. 4">Braxton (1999), p. 4</ref>  Angelou demonstrates, through her involvement with the black community of Stamps, as well as her presentation of vivid and realistic racist characters and "the vulgarity of white Southern attitudes toward African Americans",<ref>Lupton, p. 63</ref> her developing understanding of the rules for surviving in a racist society.  Angelou's autobiographies, beginning with ''Caged Bird'', contain a sequence of lessons about resisting oppression.  The sequence she describes leads Angelou, as the protagonist, from "helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest".<ref name="protest"/>

Walker insists that Angelou's treatment of racism is what gives her autobiographies their thematic unity and underscores one of their central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it.  The structure of the book helps to illustrate this theme. ''Caged Bird'', like most autobiographies, begins with Angelou's earliest memories, but she relates events non-chronologically.  For example, the description of the "powhitetrash" girls taunting Maya's grandmother appears in chapter five when Maya was about ten years old, two years after her rape, which occurs in chapter twelve.  Maya reacts to the "powhitetrash" incident with rage, indignation, humiliation, and helplessness, but Momma teaches her how they can maintain their personal dignity and pride while dealing with racism.  Walker calls Momma's way a "strategy of subtle resistance"<ref name="protest"/> and McPherson calls it "the dignified course of silent endurance".<ref>McPherson (1999), p. 33</ref>  

In the course of her book, Angelou demonstrates that Momma's approach to coping with racism serves as a basis for actively protesting and combating racism. For example, Maya breaks the race barrier to become the first black street-car operator in San Francisco, and responds assertively to the demeaning treatment by her white employer Mrs. Cullinan.<ref name="protest"/>  In addition, Angelou's description of the strong and cohesive black community of Stamps demonstrates how African Americans subvert repressive institutions to withstand racism.<ref>McPherson, p. 38</ref>  Arensberg insists that Angelou demonstrates how she, as a black child, evolves out of her "racial hatred",<ref name="Arensberg, p. 116">Arensberg, p. 116</ref> common in the works of many contemporary black novelists and autobiographers.  At first Maya wishes that she could become white, since growing up black in white America is dangerous; later she sheds her self-loathing and embraces a strong racial identity.<ref name="Arensberg, p. 116"/>

===Rape===
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:25%; float:left; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">It should be clear, however, that this portrayal of rape is hardly titillating or "pornographic."  It raises issues of trust, truth and lie, love, the naturalness of a child's craving for human contact, language and understanding, and the confusion engendered by the power disparities that necessarily exist between children and adults.
<p align=right>Opal Moore<ref>Moore, p. 53</ref></blockquote>

Angelou's description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the autobiography, although it is presented briefly in the text.<ref>Lupton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nBsaFf4qzRQC&pg=PA67&sig=ACfU3U0EOGo_8NK-Q1P9TOeLV-Ukgi4dnQ p. 67]</ref>  Scholar Mary Vermillion compares Angelou's treatment of rape to that of [[Harriet Jacobs]] in her autobiography ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]''.  Jacobs and Angelou both use rape as a metaphor for the suffering of African Americans; while Jacobs uses the metaphor to critique slaveholding culture, Angelou uses it to first internalize, then challenge, twentieth-century racist conceptions of the black female body (namely, that the black female is physically unattractive).<ref>Vermillion, p. 66</ref>  Rape, according to Vermillion, "represents the black girl's difficulties in controlling, understanding, and respecting both her body and her words".<ref>Vermillion, p. 67</ref> 

Arensberg notes that Maya's rape is connected to the theme of death in ''Caged Bird'', as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape.  After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape was the first time he touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death.  As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence.<ref>Vermillion (2004), p. 73</ref>  As Angelou later stated, "I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Healy | first = Sarah | title = Maya Angelou speaks to 2,000 at Arlington Theater | journal = Daily Nexus | volume = 81 | issue = 82 | location = UC Santa Barbara | date = 2001-02-21 | url = http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=456 | accessdate = 2008-06-13}}</ref>

Maya's rape demonstrates how as a Black female, she is violated as she moves from childhood to adolescence.<ref name="poetry"/>  African American literature scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls its depiction "a burden": a demonstration of "the manner in which the Black female is violated in her tender years and&nbsp;... the 'unnecessary insult' of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence".<ref name="poetry"/>   Vermillion goes further, maintaining that a black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender.<ref>Vermillion, pp. 60<U+2013>61</ref>  When asked decades later how she was able to survive such trauma, Angelou explained it by stating, "I can't remember a time when I wasn't loved by somebody."<ref>Braxton, p. 11</ref>  When asked by the same interviewer why she wrote about the experience, she indicated that she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape.  She also wanted to prevent it from happening to someone else, so that anyone who had been raped might gain understanding and not blame herself for it.<ref>Braxton, p. 12</ref>

===Literacy===

[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Angelou has described [[William Shakespeare]] as a strong influence on her life and works, especially his identification with marginalized people, writing "Shakespeare was a black woman".<ref>{{cite book | last = Sawyer | first = Robert | title = Victorian appropriations of Shakespeare | publisher = Associated University Presses | year = 2003 | location = Cranberry, NJ | page = 82 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=F82jtLKL0QwC&printsec=copyright#PPA82,M1 | isbn = 0-8386-3970-4}}</ref>]]

As Lupton points out, all of Angelou's autobiographies, especially ''Caged Bird'' and its immediate sequel ''[[Gather Together in My Name]]'', are "very much concerned with what [Angelou] knew and how she learned it".  Lupton compares Angelou's informal education with the education of other black writers of the twentieth century, who did not earn official degrees and depended upon the "direct instruction of African American cultural forms".<ref>Lupton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nBsaFf4qzRQC&pg=PA16&sig=ACfU3U3QQ2qg75h-GKLlCYWcSA5kdhpy6w p. 16]</ref>  Angelou is influenced by writers introduced to her by Mrs. Flowers during her self-imposed muteness, including [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[William Shakespeare]]. Angelou states, early in ''Caged Bird'', that she, as the Maya character, "met and fell in love with William Shakespeare".<ref>Angelou, p. 13</ref>  Angelou was also powerfully affected by [[slave narratives]], [[spirituals]], poetry, and other autobiographies.<ref>Lupton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nBsaFf4qzRQC&pg=PA32&sig=ACfU3U0XPBycQl_hVfY3SOgK_Is66pAtPw p. 32]</ref>  Critic Mary Vermillion sees a connection between Maya's rape and Shakespeare's "[[The Rape of Lucrece]]", which Maya memorizes and recites when she regains her speech.  Vermillion maintains that Maya finds comfort in the poem's identification with suffering.<ref>Vermillion, p. 69</ref>  Maya finds novels and their characters complete and meaningful, so she uses them to make sense of her bewildering world.  She is so involved in her fantasy world of books that she even uses them as a way to cope with her rape.<ref name="Arensberg, p. 113">Arensberg, p. 113</ref>  As Angelou writes in ''Caged Bird'', "...I was sure that any minute my mother or Bailey or the [[The Green Hornet|Green Hornet]] would bust in the door and save me".<ref>Angelou, p. 78</ref>

According to Walker, the power of words is another theme that appears repeatedly in ''Caged Bird''.  For example, Maya chooses to not speak after her rape because she is afraid of the destructive power of words.  Mrs. Flowers, by introducing her to classic literature and poetry, teaches her about the positive power of language and empowers Maya to speak again.<ref name="protest"/>  The importance of both the spoken and written word also appears repeatedly in ''Caged Bird'' and in all of Angelou's autobiographies.  Referring to the importance of literacy and methods of effective writing, Angelou once advised [[Oprah Winfrey]] in an 1993 interview to "do as West Africans do&nbsp;... listen to the deep talk", or the "utterances existing beneath the obvious".<ref>King, [http://books.google.com/books?id=6SZJgTA8DaMC&printsec=frontcover#PPA215,M1 p. 215]</ref>  As McPherson says, "If there is one stable element in Angelou's youth it is [a] dependence upon books".  The public library is a "quiet refuge" to which Maya retreats when she experiences crisis.<ref name="Arensberg, p. 113"/><ref>McPherson (1999), p. 113</ref>

==Reception and legacy==

===Critical reception and sales===

''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' is the most highly acclaimed of Angelou's autobiographies. The other volumes are regularly judged and compared to her first.<ref name="poetry"/>   With its publication, Angelou became known, according to the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', as an author who "writes like a song, and like the truth. The wisdom, rue and humor of her storytelling are borne on a lilting rhythm completely her own."<ref name="poetry"/>  Angelou's friend and mentor, [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], maintained that her book "liberates the reader into life" and called it "a Biblical study of life in the midst of death".<ref name="moore"/>  

[[Image:Jamesbaldwin.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] (1955), Angelou's friend and mentor, called ''Caged Bird'' "a Biblical study of life in the midst of death".<ref name="moore">Moore, p. 56</ref>|upright]]
By the end of 1969, critics had placed Angelou in the tradition of other black autobiographers. Poet [[James Bertolino]] asserts that ''Caged Bird'' "is one of the essential books produced by our culture".  He insists that "[w]e should all read it, especially our children".<ref>Bertolino, p. 199</ref> It was nominated for a [[National Book Award]] in 1970;<ref>Cullinan & Person, [http://books.google.com/books?id=0LyutQg6mroC&pg=PA36&sig=ACfU3U320AdBj_QhQiPfLrNM8j3F3I5UhQ p. 36]</ref> in 1995, Angelou's publishing company, [[Bantam Books]], recognized her for having the longest-running record (two years) on [[New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' paperback nonfiction bestseller list]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Biography Information | publisher = Maya Angelou Official Website | url = http://www.mayaangelou.com/LongBio.html | accessdate = 2007-10-24}}</ref>  Critic Robert A. Gross called ''Caged Bird'' "more than a tour de force of language".<ref name="McPherson 1999, p. 22">McPherson (1999), p. 22</ref>  Edmund Fuller insisted that Angelou's "artistry and intellectual range" were apparent in how she told her story.<ref name="McPherson 1999, p. 22"/>  ''Caged Bird'' catapulted Angelou to international fame and critical acclaim, and "heralded the success of other now prominent [black women] writers".<ref>Baisn<U+00E9>e, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LeG6k36sYSkC&pg=PA56&sig=ACfU3U3PllKuOT79YcM47LexDUSJsFafMA p. 56]</ref>

Angelou recited her poem "[[On the Pulse of Morning]]" at President [[Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's]] 1993 inauguration; in the following week, sales of the paperback version of ''Caged Bird'' and her other works rose by 300<U+2013>600 percent.  Bantam Books reprinted 400,000 copies of her books to meet demand.  [[Random House]], which published Angelou's hardcover books and the poem later that year, reported that they sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, marking a 1,200 percent increase.<ref>{{cite news | last = Brozan | first = Nadine | title = Chronicle | work = New York Times | date = 1993-01-30 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDA113CF933A05752C0A965958260 | accessdate = 2008-09-24}}</ref>

In one of the few negative reviews of ''Caged Bird'', author [[Francine Prose]] considers its inclusion in the high school curriculum as partly responsible for the "dumbing down" of American society.  Prose calls the book "manipulative melodrama", and considers Angelou's writing style an inferior example of "poetic" prose in memoir.  She accuses Angelou of combining a dozen metaphors in one paragraph and for "obscuring ideas that could be expressed so much more simply and felicitously".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Prose | first = Francine | title = I know why the caged bird cannot read | journal = Harper's Magazine | month = September | year = 1999 | url = http://www.scribd.com/doc/2315657/HarpersMagazine1999090060648 | accessdate = 2008-10-06}}</ref>

===Influence===
When ''Caged Bird'' was published in 1969, Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life.  Up to that point, black women writers were so marginalized that they were unable to present themselves as central characters.  Writer Julian Mayfield insists that Angelou's autobiography set a precedent not only for other black women writers, but also for the genre of autobiography as a whole.<ref name="songbird"/>  Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized as a respected spokesperson for blacks and women.<ref name="poetry"/>  ''Caged Bird'' made her "without a doubt,&nbsp;... America's most visible black woman autobiographer".<ref name="Braxton 1999, p. 4"/>  Although Als considers ''Caged Bird'' an important contribution to the increase of black [[feminist]] writings in the 1970s, he attributes its success less to its originality than to "its resonance in the prevailing [[Zeitgeist]]",<ref name="songbird"/> of its time, at the end of the American Civil Rights movement.  Angelou's writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, freed many other women writers to "open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world".<ref name="songbird"/>  

Angelou's autobiographies, especially the first volume, have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches to [[teacher education]].  Dr. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at [[George Washington University]], has used ''Caged Bird'' and ''[[Gather Together in My Name]]'' to train teachers how to "talk about racism" in their classrooms.  Due to Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony, readers of Angelou's autobiographies wonder what she "left out" and are unsure about how to respond to the events Angelou describes.  These techniques force white readers to explore their feelings about race and their own "privileged status".  Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African American autobiography and her literary techniques, readers react to her storytelling with "surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Glazier | first = Jocelyn A. | title = Moving closer to speaking the unspeakable: White teachers talking about race | journal = Teacher Education Quarterly | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 73<U+2013>94 | publisher = California Council on Teacher Education | date = Winter 2003 | url = http://www.calfac.org/allpdf/teqwinter2003/glazier.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-02-18}}</ref>

Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book, ''Stories of Resilience in Childhood'', analyzed the events in ''Caged Bird'' to illustrate resiliency in children.  Challener insists that Angelou's book provides a "useful framework" for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did.<ref>{{cite book | last = Challener | first = Daniel D. | title = Stories of Resilience in Childhood | publisher = Taylor & Francis | year = 1997 | location = London, England | pages = 22<U+2013>23 | isbn = 0-815328-00-1}}</ref>  Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used ''Caged Bird'' to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of [[child development]] topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence.  He has called the book a "highly effective" tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Boyatzis | first = Chris J. | title = Let the caged bird sing: Using literature to teach developmental psychology  | journal = Teaching of Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 221<U+2013>222 | month = February | year = 1992 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a785858917~db=all~order=page | accessdate = 2008-10-06}}</ref>

''Caged Bird'' has been criticized by many parents, causing it to be removed from school curricula and library shelves.  According to the [[National Coalition Against Censorship]], parents and schools have objected to the book's depictions of lesbianism, premarital cohabitation, pornography, and violence.<ref>{{cite web | title = Maya Angelou, I know why the caged bird sings | publisher = National Coalition Against Censorship | url = http://www.thefileroom.org/documents/dyn/DisplayCase.cfm/id/796 | accessdate = 2007-10-23}}</ref>  Some have been critical of its sexually explicit scenes, use of language, and irreverent religious depictions.<ref>Foerstel, pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=KjbxM4CshdIC&pg=PA195&sig=ACfU3U3XQtjYXtX1f16TtH5yxcePF_HJvg 195<U+2013>196]</ref>  The book is challenging for young readers and some adults, so educators have stressed the importance of preparing teachers to introduce the book effectively.<ref name="Moore, p. 55"/>  ''Caged Bird'' appears third on the [[American Library Association]] list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990<U+2013>2000.<ref> {{cite web | title = The 100 most frequently challenged books of 1990<U+2013>2000 | publisher = American Library Association | url = http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/100mostfrequently.cfm | accessdate = 2008-11-22}}</ref>  It is fifth on the ALA's list of the ten most challenged books of the 21st century (2000<U+2013>2005),<ref>{{cite web | title = Harry Potter tops list of most challenged books of 21st century | publisher = American Library Association | url = http://www.ala.org/ala/newspresscenter/news/pressreleases2006/september2006/harrypottermostchallenge.cfm | accessdate = 2008-06-14}}</ref> and is one of the ten books most frequently banned from high school and junior high school libraries and classrooms.<ref>Braxton, p. 5</ref>

===Film version===
A [[Television movie|made-for-TV movie]] version of ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' was filmed in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]] and aired on April 28, 1979 on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Company credits for I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings | publisher = Internet Movie DataBase | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079321/companycredits | accessdate = 2009-02-26}}</ref>  Angelou and Leonora Thuna wrote the screenplay; the movie was directed by [[Fielder Cook]].  Constance Good played young Maya. Also appearing were actors [[Esther Rolle]], [[Roger E.

Angelou added a scene between Maya and Uncle Willie after the [[Joe Louis]] fight; in it, he expresses his feelings of redemption after Louis defeats a white opponent.<ref>Lupton, p. 59</ref>  Angelou also presents her eighth grade graduation differently in the film.
