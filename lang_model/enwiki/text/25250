'''The [[Abbey]] Church of Waltham Abbey''' has been a place of worship since at least 1030, and is in the town of [[Waltham Abbey, Essex]], [[England]]. The [[Prime Meridian]] passes through its grounds. [[Harold Godwinson]] is said to be buried just outside the present abbey. [[Cheshunt Great House]] was located nearby.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenvisit.com/book/london_and_its_environs_1927/55_epping_forest_waltham_abbey/waltham_abbey|title=Waltham Abbey|publisher=Garden Visit|accessdate=August 8, 2010}}</ref>

==History==
Waltham Abbey was founded in 1030 to house a [[Holyrood (cross)|Holy Rood]] or Cross that was the subject of [[pilgrimage]].<ref>http://www.britannia.com/church/waltham.html</ref> Legend says that at [[Montacute]] near [[Glastonbury]], an Anglo-Danish [[Thegn]] called [[Tovi the Proud]] found a large black flint [[crucifix]] buried at the top of a hill, following a dream. He loaded the cross onto an [[Bullock cart|ox-cart]], but the oxen would only go in one direction and didn't stop until they reached Waltham, a journey of some 150 miles.<ref>{{cite book |title=Waltham Chronicle |last= Watkiss |first=Leslie   |coauthors=Marjorie Chibnall |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= }}</ref> [[Harold Godwinson]] (later King Harold II) rebuilt, refounded and richly endowed the church in 1060; a legend says that this was because in his childhood, he had been miraculously cured of paralysis by the Holy Cross.<ref>http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/e-h/harold04.html</ref> He stopped to pray at Waltham on his way to fight [[William the Conqueror|William of Normandy]], and the battle-cry of the English troops at [[Battle of Hastings|Hastings]] was "Holy Cross". After the battle, Harold's corpse is said to have been brought back to the abbey and buried there.

In about 1120 Harold's work was demolished and a new church  with crossing tower and transepts was built in the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] style.<ref>http://www.walthamabbeychurch.co.uk/history.htm</ref> In 1177 the abbey was re-founded once more, this time as an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] foundation, by [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] as part of his penance for the murder of [[Thomas Becket]]. At this point considerable additional building works were carried out, although the nature and extent of these still await detailed research. The rebuilding, in the [[Early English Period|Early English]] style, made the abbey far more extensive than the original Norman establishment, as can be seen today from traces in the abbey grounds. Those parts of the Norman church east of the crossing were demolished, and a new church, with its own nave, was constructed. The Norman nave was retained as a parish church,  divided from the new work by a screen. A cloister was built to the north of the new nave. A short passage that led into the cloister still exists; this, and a fourteenth century gatehouse, are the only surviving monastic buildings.<ref name=bettley>{{cite book |title=The Buildings of England: Essex |last=Bettley |first=James  |coauthors=Nikolaus Pevsner |year=2007 |publisher= Yale University Press||isbn= 9790300116144 |pages=807<U+2013>9 }}</ref>

The Augustinian abbey was a popular place for overnight stays with kings and other notables who were hunting in [[Epping Forest|Waltham Forest]]. It was the last abbey in [[England]] to be [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]], in 1540. [[Thomas Tallis]] was the last organist at the Abbey prior to its dissolution.  The Holy Cross disappeared without trace at this time. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] suggested Waltham as one of the new cathedrals for the [[Church of England]], but the proposal was not implemented. The Abbey site was leased to Sir Edward Denny and the remnant of the nave became the town's [[parish church]].<ref>http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/e-h/harold04.html</ref>

==Description==
[[Image:Tombe d'Harold II.jpg|thumb|Reputed tomb of King [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II]] under the site of the High Altar]]
The monastic buildings and those parts of the church east of the crossing were demolished at the dissolution, and the Norman crossing tower and transepts collapsed in 1553.<ref name=bettley>{{cite book |title=The Buildings of England: Essex |last=Bettley |first=James  |coauthors=Nikolaus Pevsner |year=2007 |publisher= Yale University Press||isbn= 9790300116144 |pages=807<U+2013>9 }}</ref>
The present-day church consists of the [[nave]] of the Norman abbey church, the 14th-century [[Lady Chapel]] and west wall, and a 16th-century   west tower, added after the dissolution. Markers on the remains of the walls in the grounds indicate the location, before demolition, of the high altar, (beneath which some believe Harold Godwinson is buried),<ref>Butler, Denis: ''1066: The Story of a Year'', 1966, p. 292</ref> and other parts. 

The interior is notable for the massive Norman [[pier (architecture)|piers]] and also for the many carvings of human faces nestling in the stonework left by the original masons. Waltham Abbey is also renowned for its 15th-century [[Doom (painting)]].

==Later architectural history==
[[Image:Waltham Abbey nave.jpg|thumb|The nave of Waltham Abbey]]
In 1859 the architect [[William Burges (architect)|William Burges]] was appointed to undertake a restoration of the site and a refurbishment of the interior.  The restoration was extensive; the removal of pews and galleries from the South and West, the  a new ceiling (painted with signs of the [[zodiac]] as at [[Peterborough Cathedral]]),  a new chancel and significant re-building.  The designs were exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]].  Work was completed by 1876. In the view of Burges's biographer, [[J. Mordaunt Crook]], "(Burges's interior) meets the [[Middle Ages]] as an equal." However the architectural historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] states that Burges's remodelling was carried out "with all the robust ugliness which that architect liked".<ref>The Buildings of England: Essex (1965)</ref>  The revised Pevsner of 2007 takes a somewhat more sympathetic view, describing Burges' work as "pioneering (and) powerful".<ref name=bettley>{{cite book |title=The Buildings of England: Essex |last=Bettley |first=James  |coauthors=Nikolaus Pevsner |year=2007 |publisher= Yale University Press||isbn= 9790300116144 |pages=807<U+2013>9 }}</ref>


The Abbey's stained glass is particularly noteworthy, including early work by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] in the rose window and lancets of the east wall, and [[Archibald Keightley Nicholson|A K Nicholson]] in the Lady Chapel. Much was destroyed during [[The Blitz]].

==Links with Harold Godwinson==
Harold's links with the area, (although only his connection with the original foundation can be proven) persist. The local secondary school, [[King Harold School]], is named after the last Saxon King of England.

==Organ==

The church contains a large 3 manual organ, mostly by [[J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd]]. A specification of the organ can be found on the [http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=D03510 National Pipe Organ Register].
