'''Alfonso Soriano''' (born January 7, 1976 in [[San Pedro de Macoris]], [[Dominican Republic]]) is a [[Major League Baseball]] [[outfielder]] for the [[Chicago Cubs]]. He previously played for the [[New York Yankees]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and [[Washington Nationals]]. He played primarily as a [[second baseman]] for the Yankees and Rangers. He bats [[right-handed]], and has batted as a [[Glossary of baseball (L)#leadoff hitter|lead-off hitter]] for most of his career.

==Professional career==
===1997: Japan===
Soriano began his professional baseball career in [[Japan]] with the [[Hiroshima Toyo Carp]], training at their [[Carp Academy]] for [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] players. In 1997, he was promoted to the [[varsity team]], and, wearing [[uniform number]] 74, he appeared in nine games, batting .118 (2 for 17) with two [[base on balls|walks]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Nightengale |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/bbw/2002-05-15/special.htm |title=Soriano makes difficult game seem easy |accessdate=September 6, 2008 |date=May 14, 2002 |publisher=[[USA Today]] [[Sports Weekly|Baseball Weekly]]}}</ref>  

Soriano disliked the intense Japanese practice schedule, and the Carp denied him a salary increase from $45,000 to $180,000 per year.<ref name="sori">{{cite web |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1026510/index.htm |title=He's Arrived |author=[[Jeff Pearlman|Pearlman, Jeff]] |accessdate=November 21, 2008 |date=August 26, 2002 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}</ref> Like [[Hideo Nomo]] and [[Hideki Irabu]], who had previously left Japan to play in the United States, Soriano hired [[Don Nomura]] to help his situation. After first attempting to void Soriano's NPB contract by unsuccessfully arguing that the player was legally a minor when he signed it, Nomura advised him, like Nomo, to retire from NPB and pursue a career in MLB. This prompted Carp executives to file an [[injunction]] against Soriano, and to send letters to MLB teams demanding that they cease all negotiations with him. After the Nomo case, NPB officials had amended the Working Agreement without consulting any MLB officials in an attempt to prevent the situation from recurring. Since MLB had not agreed to any changes to the agreement, [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|MLB Commissioner]] [[Bud Selig]] declared that MLB would recognize Soriano as a free agent on July 13, 1998, and the Carp backed down.<ref>{{cite book |last= Whiting |first= Robert |authorlink=Robert Whiting |title= The Meaning of Ichiro: The New Wave from Japan and the Transformation of Our National Pastime |publisher= [[Hachette Book Group USA|Warner Books]] |year= 2004 |month= April |isbn= 0-446-53192-8 |pages=142&ndash;144}}</ref>

===1998&ndash;2003: New York Yankees===
Soriano [[signed]] as a [[free agent]] with the [[New York Yankees]] in 1998,<ref name="sori"/> starting his [[career]] as an infield player, and played in [[New York]] for five [[seasons]]. His first hit in the MLB came in 1999 when he hit a game-winning home run against [[Norm Charlton]] of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He finished in third place for Rookie of the Year honors in 2001. In the World Series that year, he hit the would-be game and series winning home run off of [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] pitcher [[Curt Schilling]], but was denied the series winning run when [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] hit his famous series-winning bloop single on a cut fastball by closer [[Mariano Rivera]].

In 2002, Soriano led the [[American League]] with 696 [[at bats]], 209 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]], 92 extra base hits, 41 [[stolen bases]], 128 [[Run (baseball)|runs]] and set a [[New York Yankees]] [[team]] record for most at bats (696) and most [[strikeouts]] (157) in a [[Season (sports)|season]].   While he was hitting home runs, he was not taking many walks.  He is one of only six players active in 2009 who have concluded a 30-homer season with more homers than walks (39 HR, 23 BB), the others being [[Ryan Braun]] (34<U+2013>29 in 2007), [[Garret Anderson]] (35<U+2013>24 in 2000), [[Ivan Rodriguez]] (35<U+2013>24 in 1999), [[Joe Crede]] (30<U+2013>28 in 2006), and [[Jose Guillen]] (31<U+2013>24 in 2003).[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=4200075&name=stark_jayson]

In 2003, Soriano set the record for most [[home run]]s to lead off a game in a season with 13, and for the second straight year, led the league in at bats, and finished in the top five for hits, doubles, home runs, stolen bases, and strikeouts.

===2004&ndash;05: Texas Rangers===
In 2004, the Yankees traded Soriano to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] along with [[minor league]]r [[Joaqu<U+00ED>n <U+00C1>rias (baseball)|Joaquin <U+00C1>rias]] for [[Alex Rodriguez]] and cash amounting to $67 million of the $179 million remaining on Rodr<U+00ED>guez's contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1735937 |title=Selig gives blessing to mega-merger |accessdate=September 6, 2008 |date=February 17, 2004 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jesse |last=Sanchez |url=http://yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20040216&content_id=637375&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex |title=A-Rod-for-Soriano trade completed |accessdate=September 6, 2008 |date=February 16, 2004 |publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}</ref>

On May 8, 2004, Soriano had six hits in nine innings<U+2014>the first Texas Ranger to do so<U+2014>in a 16<U+2013>15, 10-inning victory over the [[Detroit Tigers]]. The game featured a bizarre, hour-long fifth inning, where Detroit scored eight runs in the top half of the inning to take a 10-run lead over the Rangers, only to see Texas score 10 runs in the bottom half of the inning to tie the game, the largest deficit ever overcome by the Rangers and tying an MLB record for most runs in an inning by two teams.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Associated Press]] |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/4933772/ |title=Rangers, Tigers combine for 18-run inning |accessdate=September 6, 2008 |date=May 8, 2004 |publisher=[[NBC Sports]]}}</ref>  That same year, Soriano was elected to the [[2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] as the starting second baseman. He hit a three-run home run off [[Roger Clemens]] in the first inning and was named the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game MVP Award|MVP of the game]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Newman |url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20040714&content_id=799783&vkey=allstar2004&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Soriano all smiles as All-Star MVP |accessdate=September 6, 2008 |date=July 14, 2004 |publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}</ref>

In 2005 he finished sixth in the AL for stolen bases, and third for extra base hits (as well as eighth for strike-outs).

===2006: Washington Nationals===
[[Image:Alfonso Soriano.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Alfonso Soriano converted from 2nd base to left field for the Washington Nationals in 2006.]]
On December 7, 2005, Soriano was traded to the [[Washington Nationals]] in exchange for [[Brad Wilkerson]], [[Terrmel Sledge]], and minor league pitcher [[Armando Galarraga]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2251887 |title=Rangers trade Soriano to Nationals for three players |accessdate=September 6, 2008 |date=December 8, 2005 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>  On February 10, 2006, Soriano set a record for the highest salary ever awarded in [[arbitration]], receiving $10 million, even though he lost his request of $12 million.<ref>{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Ladson |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060210&content_id=1309573&vkey=hotstove2005&fext=.jsp |title=Soriano loses arbitration case |accessdate=September 6, 2008 |date=February 10, 2006 |publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}</ref>  The previous high had been set in 2001 by [[Andruw Jones]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]] when he earned $8.2 million. The Nationals offered Soriano a five-year, $50-million extension, but Soriano rejected the offer.<ref>{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Ladson |url=http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060723&content_id=1571998&vkey=news_was&fext=.jsp&c_id=was |title=Kasten wants Soriano to stay |accessdate=September 6, 2008 |date=July 23, 2006 |publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}</ref>

Soriano and his agent [[Diego Bentz]] instead opted to open contract negotiations during the off-season, so that he would become a [[free agent]] and would be capable of earning a greater salary.

On March 20, 2006, Nationals manager [[Frank Robinson]] wrote Soriano in the [[batting order (baseball)|lineup]] to play left field. Soriano, who since 2001 had played exclusively at second base, refused to take the field, and the Nationals organization threatened him with disqualification, which would have meant forfeiture of his salary, and he would not have received credit for service time in fulfillment of the obligations of his contract. With his contract's service terms officially still unfulfilled, he would then ''not'' have been eligible for free agency at season's end.

Two days later, Soriano relented and played in left field for the Nationals in their exhibition game against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Robinson indicated that he considered Soriano's move to left field to be permanent and would not consider moving Soriano back to second base at any point during the season. In his comments following that game, Soriano indicated that he would accept his new position without further argument. As the season got underway, however, Soriano began to enjoy his new position, and by the All-Star break, he led the league in outfield assists and became one of the few players ever to start the All-Star game at two different positions.

Soriano enjoyed the greatest season in his career in 2006. He shattered his previous career high in [[bases on balls|walks]] with 67 (previously 38). He also reached a career high in home runs with 46 (previously 39). He also had 41 [[stolen bases]]. On August 25, a week after reaching 30<U+2013>30, he became the fastest man in baseball history to reach 200 home runs and 200 stolen bases, reaching the mark in 929 games (breaking the previous record of 1,053 games held by [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]]).<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2561864 ESPN - Elias Says ... - ESPN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On September 16, 2006, Soriano stole second base in the 1st inning to become only the fourth player to join the [[40-40 Club]], joining [[Jos<U+00E9> Canseco]], [[Barry Bonds]], and [[Alex Rodriguez]]. Six days later he became the first person ever to reach 40 home runs, 40 stolen bases and 40 doubles in one season.<ref>{{cite web |title=Soriano first ever to reach 40-40-40 mark |publisher=[[Associated press]] |author= |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14961469/ |accessdate=July 31, 2007}}</ref>

Soriano, making his fifth consecutive All-Star team, became only the third man to start All-Star games for both leagues at two different positions.

====Possible trade====
As the trading deadline of July 31 approached, the Nationals were in a dilemma. On one hand, Soriano had initially expressed his distaste for playing left field, and he was in the last year of his contract, which would grant him free agency at the end of the season. If the Nationals lost Soriano at the end of the season, they would receive a first or second round draft pick and a "sandwich" pick in between the first and second round as compensation.  Further, Soriano did not want to engage in contract negotiations during the season. On the other hand, as the deadline approached, Soriano expressed his enjoyment with left field, and his strong desire to stay with the team.<ref>[http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060706&content_id=1542509&vkey=news_was&fext=.jsp&c_id=was The Official Site of The Washington Nationals: News: Washington Nationals News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Both fans and players began to be more vocal in their support to keep Soriano. Manager [[Frank Robinson]] praised Soriano's leadership in the clubhouse, and further suggested that Soriano should be considered for [[MVP]] of the [[National League]]. There were plenty of suitors, including sending Soriano back to the Yankees, and the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers were also interested. In the end, Nationals general manager [[Jim Bowden]] felt that what he was offered was not worth trading him. The "non-trade" was a risk for the Nationals and made headlines across the country.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060731&content_id=1585922&vkey=trade2006&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Major League Baseball News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The Nationals hoped to sign him to a long term deal before the season ended but on October 12, 2006 he rejected a $70 million deal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/31/AR2006073101378.html | work=The Washington Post | title=The Left Fielder Stays in the Picture | first=Thomas | last=Boswell}}</ref>

====2008====
During the first few weeks of the 2008 season with the Cubs, Soriano struggled. He was only hitting .190 at the time he was put on the [[disabled list|DL]] with a bad leg. After being activated, Soriano got off to a quick start, raising his average to .280 and increasing his home run total. In a one week stretch in May, he hit 7 home runs in just 6 games, hitting nearly .500 during that stretch. At the end of May he had 12 home runs and 33 RBIs. However, his defense was extremely poor, and after being placed on the DL early in the season, Soriano was encouraged to stop hopping as he caught fly balls. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}This seemed to affect his play in the field as he misjudged two balls in St. Louis on May 2, shortly after being activated.

However, due to the injury, he was replaced in the starting lineup by [[Matt Holliday]] of the [[Colorado Rockies]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Associated Press |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/allstar08/news/story?id=3481665 |title=Holliday to replace Soriano in NL All-Star lineup |accessdate=September 6, 2008 |date=July 10, 2008 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>

As poor as Alfonso's defense is perceived to be, his arm has been just as much as asset to the Cubs, and he was one of the league's leaders in outfield assists. Soriano also led the team in home runs, despite having played in only 109 games. On August 22, Soriano accomplished one of baseball's rarest feats, as he stole home plate in a loss to his old team, the Washington Nationals.<ref>{{cite web |first=Carrie |last=Muskat |url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20080822&content_id=3349132&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc |title=Cubs stunned by Nats' late rallies |accessdate=September 6, 2008 |date=August 22, 2008 |publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}</ref>

In early September, Soriano helped end the Cubs six-game losing streak by slugging out three home runs with five RBI against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. It marked the third three-home run game of his career. However, as the Cubs went into the playoffs against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], Soriano, like nearly everyone else on the team, hit poorly in the NLDS.

Soriano had an embarrassing moment in a day-night double header on Wednesday, August 13, 2008, where he hit a long ball which he thought was a home run.  He watched it, and slowly trotted down to 1st, yet the ball never left the park.  He wound up with only a single.  Between games, he apologized to his team and promised that it would never happen again.

====2009====
[[File:Alfonso Soriano - 2009-07-29.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Soriano at bat with the Cubs in {{mlby|2009}}.]]
Soriano had gotten off to a quick start, hitting a solo home run in his first at bat of the 2009 season.<ref>http://mlb.mlb.com/index.jsp</ref>
Soriano also hit a game tying solo home run off [[LaTroy Hawkins]] in the 8th inning in the second game of the young season. On April 11, Soriano hit a 2-run home run off of [[Carlos Villanueva (baseball)|Carlos Villanueva]] in the top of the ninth giving the Cubs a 6 to 5 victory over rival Milwaukee. Comcast Sportsnet awarded Soriano with "Play of the Day.".<ref>http://espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=290411108</ref>  Soriano homered again, the very next day, on the first pitch he saw from [[Jeff Suppan]], his 51st lead-off home run. On April 17 with one out in the bottom of the eighth Soriano hit a two run home run to give the Cubs a 8<U+2013>7 lead over the St. Louis Cardinals.<ref>http://espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=290412108</ref>  However, Soriano only hit .216 in the month of May.<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/splits?playerId=3993</ref>

In voting for the 2009 All Star Game, Soriano was fourth among NL outfielders (2,692,994 votes), trailing [[Ryan Braun]] (4,138,559), [[Ra<U+00FA>l Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez]] (4,053,355), and [[Carlos Beltran]] (2,812,295).[http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/520601.html]

Shortly before the All Star break, manager Lou Piniella dropped Soriano in the batting order and made it clear that it was not a temporary change.  For the first time in his career, Soriano seemed to accept not being a leadoff hitter and actually praised his manager for making the necessary decision citing the fact that, "I'm not doing my job."

The batting order change helped Soriano. In the first series after the all-star break, he hit two go-ahead home runs against the [[Washington Nationals|Nationals]]. On July 27 he hit a [[walk-off home run|walk-off grand slam]] against the [[Houston Astros]] during the 13th inning.

On September 5, 2009, it was reported that Soriano is to undergo a knee surgery. The surgery would sideline him for the rest of the season.

In 2009, Soriano led all major league left fielders in errors, with 11, and the lowest fielding percentage among them (.950).<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding/_/position/lf/sort/errors/order/false "MLB Player Fielding Stats - As lf - 2009," ''ESPN'', accessed October 6, 2009]</ref>

===2010===

On June 11, 2010, Soriano hit his 300th home run off of [[Jake Peavy]].

{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}

===Fielding===
Soriano led all major league second basemen in errors every year from 2001 to 2005 (19 (tied), 23, 19, 23, and 21). In 2006 he was second in the major leagues of all left fielders in errors, with 11, but led all left fielders with 22 assists, 9 double plays, and a 2.29 [[range factor]].

==Personal life==

On May 17, 2009 Soriano appeared in a skit on [[WWE Judgment Day]] with [[Mike Mizanin|The Miz]] and [[Santino Marella]]. Also after [[John Cena]] defeated [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]], Cena went over to Soriano in the crowd to give him a hug.<ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Caldwell |coauthors= |authorlink= |title=WWE News: Yahoo Sports covers Alfonso Soriano's appearance at last night's Judgment Day PPV (w/VIDEO) |date=May 18, 2009 |publisher=pwtorch.com |url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_32132.shtml |work= |pages= |accessdate=May 19, 2009 |language= }}</ref>
