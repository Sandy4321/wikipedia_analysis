Goodmon and Anderson (2011) showed not only that prior retrieval enhances later retrieval of those same words (Rp+ items), but that remembering words ''related'' to practiced words (Rp- items) can suffer as a result of prior retrieval compared to unrelated words (NRp items).  By comparing the recall for Rp- and NRp items, the experiment showed a 13% RIF effect.
}}
'''Retrieval-induced forgetting''' (or '''RIF''') is a [[memory]] phenomenon where [[recall (memory)|remembering]] causes [[forgetting]] of other information in memory.  The phenomenon was first demonstrated in 1994, although the concept of RIF has been previously discussed in the context of [[memory inhibition|retrieval inhibition]].  RIF is demonstrated through a three-phase experiment consisting of study, practice of some studied material, and a final test of all studied material.  Such experiments have also used multiple kinds of final tests including recall using only category cues, recall using category and word stems, and recognition tests.  The effect has been produced using many different kinds of materials, can be produced in group settings, and is reduced in special populations such as individuals with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]]  or [[schizophrenia]].

Although RIF occurs as a consequence of conscious remembering through [[explicit memory|explicit retrieval]], the actual forgetting is thought to occur [[implicit memory|implicitly]], below the level of awareness.  Cognitive psychologists continue to debate why RIF occurs, and how it relates to the larger picture of memory and general [[cognition]].  In particular, researchers are divided on the idea of whether the forgetting is caused by a process that actively [[memory inhibition|inhibits]] information, or due to [[interference theory|interference]] from other information in memory. Inhibition associated with RIF has been looked at as similar to forms of physical inhibition. RIF has also been tied to memory retrieval strategies, with disrupting such strategies affecting the phenomenon.

RIF is similar to some other memory phenomena.  It is comparable to [[Memory inhibition#PartSet|part-set cuing]] in that both show lowered memory performance given some previously studied information.  In one example of part-set cuing, people asked to recall as many as [[U.S. states]] as they could remembered more states than those asked to after being shown the names of some states beforehand.  Having been cued with a portion of the to-be-recalled information, recall performance worsened.<ref name=Nickerson1984>{{cite journal|last=Nickerson|first=R.S.|title=Retrieval inhibition from part-set cuing: A persisting enigma in memory research.|journal=Memory & Cognition|year=1984|volume=12|issue=6|pages=531-552|doi=10.3758/BF03213342}}</ref>  RIF is also related to forgetting attributable to changes in one's [[context effects|context]] where the forgetting is automatic and without awareness.<ref name=Anderson2005></ref><ref name=Sahakyan2002></ref>  [[Interference theory#Output interference|Output interference]] is a related phenomenon, where generation of words from a category such as ''fruits'' can make other words from the category harder to remember, or cause [[perseveration]]s where participants repeat already-remembered words.<ref name=Spellman1995>{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Michael C.|coauthors=Spellman, Barbara A.|title=On the status of inhibitory mechanisms in cognition: Memory retrieval as a model case.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1995|volume=102|issue=1|pages=68<U+2013>100|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.102.1.68}}</ref>

==Retrieval-practice paradigm==
RIF has been shown in ''retrieval-practice paradigm'' experiments, with exact instructions and procedures varying slightly from experiment to experiment.  In the original version of the experiment,<ref name=Anderson1994></ref> booklets were used to present stimuli and to complete testing.  Since then this procedure has often been done using computer software such as [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] or [[E-Prime]].<ref name=Bajo2006></ref>  The experiments typically consist of study, retrieval-practice, and test phases.<ref name = Perfect2004>{{cite journal|last=Perfect|first=Timothy J.|coauthors=Stark, Louisa-Jayne; Tree, Jeremy J.; Moulin, Christopher J.A.; Ahmed, Lubna; Hutter, Russell|title=Transfer appropriate forgetting: The cue-dependent nature of retrieval-induced forgetting|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=1 October 2004|volume=51|issue=3|pages=399<U+2013>417|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2004.06.003}}</ref> 

===Study phase===
In the study phase, participants are asked to study word pairs that consist of a [[Categorization|category name]] and a word that belongs to that category, an example being ''FRUIT<U+2013>orange''. Typically multiple word pairs across a number of categories, say 48 items divided equally into 8 categories, are used.  Among several others, participants might study word pairs such as the following:<ref name=Perfect2004></ref>
:''METAL<U+2013>iron''
:''TREE<U+2013>birch''
:''METAL<U+2013>silver''
:''TREE<U+2013>elm''

===Retrieval-practice phase===
A subset of the items are tested using a fill-in-the-blank test. For a given item, the participant is shown the category name and the first two letters of a studied word from that category (e.g. METAL<U+2013>ir______).  Participants are instructed to fill in the blank with an appropriate studied word from that category.  Participants will typically practice remembering the items multiple times.<ref name = Perfect2004/><ref name=Bauml2002></ref>  The retrieval-practice phase splits items into three different types that are of interest during the final test, and are often denoted using the following notation:<ref name = Perfect2004 />
[[File:RIFItemTypes.PNG|350px|thumb|right|Diagram describing dependent variables and hypothetical average recall at final test in the retrieval practice paradigm for different item types.  These items are different based on 1) whether they were practiced or unpracticed and 2) what their relationship is to practiced items.]]
*''Practiced items (Rp+ items)'' are studied words that participants attempt to remember during retrieval practice.
*''Unpracticed<U+2013>related items (Rp- items)'' are studied words that are not practiced, but related (by category) to words that were practiced.
*''Unpracticed<U+2013>unrelated items (NRp items)'' are studied words in categories that are never practiced.  These categories are typically unrelated to practiced categories.  These items also serve as a baseline to compare to unpracticed<U+2013>related items.

===Test phase===
After retrieval practice, participants are given a final test, where they are asked to remember all studied items.  The goal of the test phase is to assess whether prior retrieval practice affects how well the unpracticed<U+2013>related words are remembered compared to the unpracticed<U+2013>unrelated words.  RIF is ultimately measured as the difference between the proportion of items recalled between these two types.<ref name=Perfect2004/>

In a ''category-cued test'', one studied category is shown at a time and participants are asked to remember all studied items from that category.  Although a set amount of time is given for each category, the exact amount of time varies across studies.  For instance, Anderson and co-researchers, in 1994, gave participants 30 seconds for each category cue (and given that there were 6 words in each category, this meant that participants had 5 seconds, on average, to remember each item).  Other studies have used longer durations.<ref name=Aslan2007>{{cite journal|last=Aslan|first=Alp|coauthors=B<U+00E4>uml, Karl Heinz; Pastotter, Bernhardt|title=No Inhibitory Deficit in Older Adults<U+2019> Episodic Memory|journal=Psychological Science|year=2007|volume=18|issue=1|pages=72-78}}</ref><ref name=Jakab2009>{{cite journal|last=Jakab|first=Em<U+0151>ke|coauthors=Raaijmakers, Jeroen G.

''Category-plus-stem-cued tests'' add a word stem to the category cue. Typically, for each category, participants are given a specific number of letters corresponding to a unique studied word from the category.  Because these cues are specific to a particular word, participants are given relatively less time to respond to each cue compared to category-cued tests.  Response times for each cue vary from study to study, although many experiments have used an interval of 10 seconds.<ref name=Camp2007>{{cite journal|last=Camp|first=Gino|coauthors=Pecher, Diane; Schmidt, Henk G.|title=No retrieval-induced forgetting using item-specific independent cues: Evidence against a general inhibitory account.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=1 January 2007|volume=33|issue=5|pages=950<U+2013>958|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.33.5.950}}</ref>, though some studies have reported using response times as few as 3 seconds.<ref name=Kuhl2007>{{cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=Bruce A.|coauthors=Dudukovic, Nicole M., & Wagner, Anthony D.|title=Decreased demands on cognitive control reveal the neural processing benefits of forgetting|journal=Nature Neuroscience|year=2007|month=July|volume=10|issue=7|pages=908-914}}</ref>  Typically, category-plus-stem-cued tests include only the first initial letter from the word,<ref name=Bauml2002>{{cite journal|last=B<U+00E4>uml|first=Karl Heinz|coauthors=Hartinger, Armin|title=On the role of item similarity in retrieval-induced forgetting|journal=Memory|year=2002|volume=10|issue=3|pages=215-224|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2002-12993-005}}</ref><ref name=Storm2007>{{cite journal|last=Storm|first=Benjamin C.|coauthors=Bjork, Elizabeth L., Bjork, Robert A., & Nestojko, John F.|title=Is retrieval success a necessary condition for retrieval-induced forgetting?|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2007-06253-013|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review|year=2006|volume=13|issue=6|pages=1023-1027}}</ref> but some have included multiple letters.<ref name=Anderson1994></ref><ref name=Bajo2006>{{cite journal|last=Bajo|first=M.

''Recognition tests'' do not require participants to produce a word from memory.  Instead participants are literally shown a word, and are asked to report whether it was a word that appeared during the [[Retrieval-induced forgetting#Study phase|study phase]].  Recognition tests typically show all of the studied words and a number of non-studied words, the ''lures''. Researchers measure how often participants correctly recognize studied items, and how often they incorrectly recognize lures.  The difference between these two proportions is a statistic measuring one's ability to discriminate between studied and non-studied items, and has been used to represent RIF.<ref name=Roman2009>{{cite journal|last=Rom<U+00E1>n|first=Patricia|coauthors=Soriano, M.F., G<U+00F3>mez-Ariza, C.J., & Bajo, M.T.|title=Retrieval-induced forgetting and executive control|journal=Psychological Science|year=2009|volume=20|issue=9|pages=1053-1058}}</ref><ref name=Spitzer2007>{{cite journal|last=Spitzer|first=Bernhard|coauthors=B<U+00E4>uml, K.|title=Retrieval-induced forgetting in item recognition: Evidence for a reduction in general memory strength|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=2007|volume=83|issue=5|pages=863-875}}</ref>  [[Reaction time]] is also used to represent RIF, where slower reaction times are thought to represent more RIF due to difficulty in recognizing the studied item.<ref name=Roman2009></ref><ref name=Veling2004>{{cite journal|last=Veling|first=Harm|coauthors=Van Knippenberg, A.|title=Remembering can cause inhibition: Retrieval-induced inhibition as cue independent process|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=204|volume=30|issue=2|pages=315-318}}</ref>

==General findings==
RIF studies have generally yielded results where, on average, unpracticed<U+2013>related words are remembered less well than the baseline of unpracticed<U+2013>unrelated words.<ref name="Esgate 2005">{{cite book|last=Esgate|first=Anthony|title=An Introduction to Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|location=Hove, UK|isbn=1841693189|page=28|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B4agXAUYv6QC|author=Esgate, Anthony|coauthors=Groome, David & Baker, Kevin}}</ref><ref name=MNT></ref>

===Generality of RIF===
RIF studies have generally used words from basic and easily recognized categories, but the effects have been shown with a wide variety of stimuli:

===Modifications to retrieval-practice phase===
Although the typical paradigm includes retrieval practice of previously studied words, some studies have shown RIF even when participants were asked to retrieve something else.  For instance, RIF has occurred even when participants generated new, unstudied items from previously studied categories in what is called "extra-list retrieval practice" or "semantic generation."<ref name=Storm2007></ref><ref name=Storm2006>{{cite journal|last=Storm|first=B.C.|coauthors=Bjork, E.L., Bjork, R.A., Nestojko, J.F.|title=When intended remembering leads to unintended forgetting|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review|year=2007|volume=60|issue=7|pages=909-915|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2007-11257-002}}</ref>  In a method called "impossible retrieval practice," RIF has also been observed when participants were asked to generate a word for a category, even though one did not actually exist.<ref name=Storm2006></ref><ref name=Storm2010>{{cite journal|last=Storm|first=B.C.|coauthors=Nestojko, J.F.|title=Successful inhibition, unsuccessful retrieval: Manipulating time and success during retrieval practice|journal=Memory|year=2010|volume=18|issue=2|pages=99-114|doi=10.1080/09658210903107853}}</ref>  RIF is still observed at final test in cases where successful retrieval is not possible, such as one where having studied a number of fruits a participant is asked to generate a word given a cue resembling ''FRUIT<U+2013>wu''.<ref name=Storm2006></ref>  Some studies have also examined the effect on RIF when participants, instead of being asked to perform retrieval practice, are given additional study trials making them restudy the material instead of remembering prior information.  In these cases, participants have failed to show any RIF effects.<ref name=Bauml2002></ref><ref name=Ciranni1999></ref>

===RIF studies in special populations===
Because RIF is an effect related to the accessibility of information, researchers have studied whether it persists in populations that have certain disorders related to memory.  In one study of students diagnosed with [[ADHD]], the degree of RIF observed compared to a [[control group]] depended on the kind of final test used.  When using a category-cued test, there were no differences in RIF compared to a control group.  However, when a category-plus-stem-cued test was used, participants with ADHD, on average, showed less RIF than controls.<ref name=StormWhite2010>{{cite journal|last=Storm|first=B.C.|coauthors=White, H.A.|title=ADHD and retrieval-induced forgetting: Evidence for a deficit in the inhibitory control of memory.|journal=Memory|year=2010|volume=18|issue=3|pages=265-271|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2010-08151-004}}</ref>  Patients with [[clinical depression|depression]] show no RIF compared to controls when using a category-plus-stem-cued test.<ref name=Potts>{{cite journal|last=Potts|first=Rosalind|coauthors=Law, Robin; Golding, John F.; Groome, David|title=The Reliability of Retrieval-Induced Forgetting|journal=European Psychologist|year=2012|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1<U+2013>10|doi=10.1027/1016-9040/a000040}}</ref>   Patients with [[schizophrenia]] show comparable RIF effects to control groups under a category-cued test, but reduced RIF using a recognition test.<ref name=Potts></ref>

===Socially-shared RIF===
The effects of studying or remembering information in groups has also been examined.  When comparing retrieval of a list of studied items between individuals and groups (of three), groups performed worse on average. This effect is called ''socially-shared RIF'',<ref name=Brown2012>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Adam D.|coauthors=Kouri, Nicole; Hirst, William|title=Memory's malleability: Its role in shaping collective memory and social identity|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=1 January 2012|volume=3|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00257}}</ref><ref name=Rajaram2011>{{cite journal|last=Rajaram|first=S.|title=Collaboration both hurts and helps memory|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2011|volume=20|pages=76-81|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/20/2/76.abstract}}</ref> and can even occur with details related to [[flashbulb memories]], which are characterized by having a high level of vividness and confidence in the accuracy of remembered detail.  One example of this phenomenon is when [[Americans]] remember details related to the [[September 11th attacks]]:  Remembering a subset of details about the event causes RIF for other related, critical information about the event.<ref name=Coman2009>{{cite journal|last=Coman|first=A.|coauthors=Manier, D., & Hirst, W.|title=Forgetting the unforgettable through conversation: Socially shared retrieval-induced forgetting of September 11 memories|journal=Psychological Science |year=2009|volume=20|pages=627-633|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2009-06873-017}}</ref>

==Theoretical accounts==
[[File:Inhibitory Response Diagram.png|thumb|300px|Diagram describing when an inhibitory response would be required.  According to the inhibitory account of RIF, when prepotent memories are active but inappropriate in response to a cue, they are inhibited in order to access a less accessible but contextually appropriate memory.]]
===Interference===
{{See also|Interference theory}}
Many instances of forgetting are often accounted to the interference from heightened accessibility of other, associated information in memory. Researchers have described how interference may explain RIF in a number of ways.  For instance the theory of [[Interference theory#Proactive interference|blocking]] suggests that because practiced words are more easily remembered at test, they may occupy a "response channel" in memory and effectively prevent unpracticed<U+2013>related words in memory from being remembered.  Unpracticed<U+2013>unrelated words would be less affected by this blocking effect because retrieval of practiced words would not block items from different categories.<ref name=Anderson1994></ref><ref name=Mensink1988>{{cite journal|last=Mensink, G.|first=G.|coauthors=Raaijmakers, J.G.W.|title=A Model for interference and forgetting|journal=Psychological Review|year=1988|volume=95|issue=4|pages=434-455|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/95/4/434/}}</ref>  Other theories such as ''resource diffusion'' and ''response decrement'' are similar to blocking. These theories describe retrieval processes as a finite set of resources that cannot be distributed adequately enough to unpracticed<U+2013>related items at test.<ref name=Anderson1994></ref>

Other models of interference have been proposed that more precisely define the idea of an item's strength in memory through separating the strength of item itself in memory and the [[context effects|contextual information]] it is linked to.<ref name=Verde2012>{{cite book|last=Verde|first=M.F.|title=The Psychology of Learning and Motivation.|publisher=Academic Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-12-394393-4|chapter=Retrieval-induced forgetting and Inhibition: A critical view|editor=Brian H.

===Inhibition===
{{See also|Memory inhibition}}
[[File:PottedCactus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|If one were to notice a potted plant falling, one might automatically react so as to catch it.  However, upon noticing it was a cactus, inhibitory processes would work to withhold that action.  A similar process could work with memories that are prepotent but inappropriate for a given situation.]]
Generally speaking, inhibition theory assumes the existence of a set of processes that allows the suppression of memories.  Central to the inhibition account of RIF is that access to unpracticed<U+2013>related items is actively suppressed by this inhibitory process during retrieval-practice. For instance, when participants perform retrieval practice, the category cue may activate many associated items.  The degree to which related, but inappropriate associates, that is unpracticed<U+2013>related words, become accessible serves as a source of competition that disrupts retrieval of an appropriate response. To resolve this competition, an inhibitory process intervenes to suppress accessibility to such items. Subsequently, this suppression facilitates retrieval of an appropriate item and prevents retrieval of contextually inappropriate items.  Items from unrelated categories, that is unpracticed<U+2013>unrelated items, are less competitive during retrieval practice and thus, require less inhibition. At final test, the consequences of the suppression persist, and previously competitive items that were inhibited become more difficult to remember.<ref name=MNT>{{cite web|title=The Cognitive Process Behind "Retrieval-Induced Forgetting"|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/242122.php|publisher=Medical News Today|accessdate=8 November 2012|date=26 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=Storm2012>{{cite journal|last=Storm|first=B.C.|coauthors=Levy, B.J.|title=A progress report on the inhibitory account of retrieval-induced forgetting|journal=Memory & Cognition|year=2012|volume=40|pages=827-843|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/nw72341v53382142/}}</ref><ref name=Anderson2007></ref>

This reduction in accessibility is consistent with the definition of inhibition proposed by [[Robert A. Bjork]]:  that inhibition is an active, direct form of suppression that serves to reduce access to one or several responses for some adaptive purpose.<ref name=Bjork1989></ref><ref name=Storm2012/>

Memory inhibition in reference to RIF has sometimes been likened to processes of inhibition associated with [[motor control]], such as those responsible for baseball players stopping their swing when they anticipate a [[Ball (baseball)|ball]].<ref name=Anderson2007>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Michael C.|title=Inhibition in Cognition|year=2007|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC|pages=81-102|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2007-07643-005|chapter=Theoretical issues in inhibition: Insights from research on human memory.|coauthors=Levy, Benjamin J.|editor=Gorfein, David S. & MacLeod, Colin M.}}</ref>  Similarly, when a dominant response in memory is inappropriate, inhibitory processes must be recruited to temporarily suppress that response so that a more appropriate one can be retrieved.<ref name=Anderson2007></ref>

===Other accounts===
Individual strategies in retrieval have been considered as one way RIF might occur, in that retrieval practice may be inconsistent with the way participants remember items studied from those categories.  If retrieval practice disrupts participants' memory strategy, it may affect their ability to remember particular items at final test.<ref>{{cite book|last=M. MacLeod|first=Colin|title=The Psychology of Learning and Motivation|year=2003|coauthors=Michael D. Dodd, Erin D. Sheard, Daryl E. Wilson, and Uri Bibi|editor=B. H. Ross|chapter=In opposition to inhibition|pages=163-214}}</ref>  If participants are preparing to remember items during retrieval-practice based on some strategy, certain presentation orders may disrupt that strategy whereas others may not.  For instance, when participants practice items in the same order as presented during study, RIF is lower compared to when presentation is random during retrieval practice.  These results are the same even when participants are explicitly instructed to remember the order in which items are presented during study.<ref name=Dodd2006>{{cite journal|last=Dodd|first=M.D.|coauthors=Castel, A.D, & Roberts, K.E.|title=A strategy disruption component to retrieval-induced forgetting|journal=Memory & Cognition|year=2006|volume=34|issue=1|pages=102-11|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2006-05338-010}}</ref><ref name = Jakab>{{cite journal|title=The role of item strength in retrieval-induced forgetting|last1=Jakab|first1=E.|last2=Raaijmakers|first2=J.G.W|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=2009|volume=35|issue=3|pages=607<U+2013>617|doi=10.1037/a0015264}}</ref>
