'''''Space Mutiny''''' (also known as '''''Mutiny in Space''''') is a 1988 [[List of South African films|South African]] [[Science fiction film|science-fiction]] [[action film]] about a [[mutiny]] aboard the [[starship|spaceship]] known as the ''Southern Sun''.

== Plot ==
The ''Southern Sun'' is a seedship, or a spacefaring vessel that contains large amounts of people, whose mission is to colonize a new world. Its voyage has lasted generations, so many of its inhabitants have been born and will die without ever setting foot on solid ground. This does not please the antagonist, Elijah Kalgan, who conspires with the pirates infesting the nearby [[Corona Borealis]] system and the ship<U+2019>s Chief Engineer MacPhearson. Kalgan hatches a plot to disrupt the Southern Sun<U+2019>s navigation systems and use the Enforcers, the ship<U+2019>s [[police]] force, to [[Aircraft hijacking|hijack]] the ship and direct it towards this system. At this point, the inhabitants of the ''Southern Sun'' will have no choice but to accept his "generosity".

Kalgan sabotages a key part of the ship just as an important professor's shuttle is on a landing trajectory. The loss of guidance control causes the ship to explode. The ship's pilot, Dave Ryder, is able to escape, but the professor dies in the explosion. This sabotage seals off the flight deck for a number of weeks, which gives Kalgan the opportunity to attempt to wrest control. With the Enforcers in his hand, and with the flight deck out of commission, he holds the entire population of the ''Southern Sun'' hostage. Commander Jansen and Captain Devers enlist Ryder<U+2019>s assistance, aided begrudgingly by Jansen<U+2019>s daughter Dr. Lea Jansen, to regain control of the ship.

The director of ''Space Mutiny'' has stated on his website that he was called away from set due to a death in the family before filming began, and delegated directing duties to the assistant director. Contractually he was apparently unable to get an [[Allen Smithee]] credit.<ref>{{cite web

|date= 2008-10-08 }}</ref>  Some commentators began to compile rather large lists of continuity errors.
The engineering areas of the ship were filmed in an industrial building with un-futuristic brick walls, windows and concrete floors, while the bridge looks remarkably like a vintage-1980s corporate office (non-shag, neutral carpeting; white particleboard desks; computers with 16-color [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] displays, including one with a 5<U+00BC> inch [[floppy disk]] drive as an [[identity document|ID card]] reader). Kalgan<U+2019>s <U+201C>torture chamber<U+201D> set features contemporary computer keyboards inexplicably mounted on the walls. The characters tend to wear the silver or white [[lam<U+00E9> (fabric)|lam<U+00E9>]] outfits that were common to science fiction/futurist productions of the time, while many of the female characters wear [[spandex]] [[leotard]]s.

The film's notable flaws provided substantial material for later spoofing on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', and [[Eccentric Cinema]] described it as "quite possibly the worst science fiction/space adventure film made in English".<ref>

One chase scene involves slow-moving Enforcer vehicles, strongly resembling bowling-alley floor polishers, and the collision of two of these vehicles produces an extraordinary explosion for such small craft. The scene is further undermined by the intense sunlight streaming into the corridor.

John Phillip Law, who appeared in this movie as the villain Elijah Kalgan, also starred in the 1968 Italian film [[Diabolik]]. [[Cameron Mitchell]] played Commander Jansen, along with his daughter Camille Mitchell, who provided the voice for Jennara, the lead Bellarian; and his son Chip Mitchell played Blake, a mustachioed member of Kalgan<U+2019>s crew.

The song that plays over the end credits, "Edge of a Dream", is performed by [[Steven McClintock]].

== ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' ==
Nine years after its initial release, ''Space Mutiny'' was lampooned in a November 1997 episode of movie-mocking television comedy series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' (MST3K). The movie<U+2019>s editing flaws, stilted dialog, and poor production lent itself well to the ''MST3K'' treatment, and it has repeatedly proved to be one of the most popular episodes, released as part of the ''MST3K DVD Collection, Vol. 4'' from [[Rhino Entertainment]].<ref name="sn-dvds">{{cite web

Many of the scenes involving characters being thrown to their deaths over guardrails in the interior were coined as "railing kills" by Mike and the Bots. Mike and the Bots also mock the fact that a character killed on screen shows up prominently as an extra in later scenes. Throughout the film, the appearances of the characters were sources of ridicule: Dave Ryder, the muscular protagonist, is referred to by several ridiculous names, such as "Big McLargehuge," "Crunch Buttsteak," and, strangely, "Bob Johnson"; Ryder's love interest, Lea Jansen, is obviously much older than him, and is referred to as Commander Jansen's "grandmadaughter"; Commander Jansen is consistently compared to Santa Claus; Kalgan's continuously strained expressions are attributed to him trying to force his skull out of his skin.

Some ten minutes of footage were cut from ''Space Mutiny'' for its use on ''MST3K''. Much of the edited footage featured space battle scenes taken from the original television series of ''Battlestar Galactica''.<ref>{{cite book|title= An Analytical Guide to Television's Battlestar Galactica: An Episode Guide and Analysis of the 1978 Science Fiction Television Series and Its Short Lived Sequel, "Galactica: 1980"|first= John Kenneth |last= Muir|publisher= McFarland|isbn= 0786404418|pages= 146|chapter= In 1997, Mike, Crow and Servo watched Space Mutiny|unused_data= |year= 1999 }}</ref> The version of the film featured in the episode was, in essence, consistent with the full version; the discontinuities apparent in the episode were all present in the 1988 film.  [[Mike Nelson (MST3K)|Mike Nelson]] and the 'bots did not comment on the reused ''Battlestar Galactica'' footage. Series writer Paul Chaplin acknowledged this omission, but did not provide an explanation.<ref name="aceg">{{cite web
