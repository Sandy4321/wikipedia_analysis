He was named  [[European Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] at the 1996 [[Cartier Racing Awards]]. In his championship season, Bahamian Bounty won three of his five races including two [[Conditions races|Group One]] races, the [[Prix Morny]] in France and the [[Middle Park Stakes]] in [[England]]. He was retired after two unsuccessful starts in 1997. He currently stands as a stallion at the [[National Stud]] at [[Newmarket, Suffolk]].


==Background==
Bahamian Bounty was bred in the [[United Kingdom]] by Clarents Racing Ltd. His sire, Cadeaux Genereux  won several major sprint races including the [[Nunthorpe Stakes]] and the [[July Cup]]. At stud he sired over 1,000 winners including Touch of the Blues ([[Atto Mile]]), Bijou d'Inde ([[St. James's Palace Stakes]]) and Toylsome ([[Prix de la For<U+00EA>t]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloodstock.racingpost.com/stallionbook/stallion.sd?horse_id=9363&popup=1 |title=Cadeaux Genereux Stud Record |publisher=Bloodstock.racingpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26}}</ref>  Bahamian Bounty<U+2019>s dam, Clarentia was a sprinter who won three races, all over the minimum distance of five [[furlong]]s. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/horse_home_popup.sd?horse_id=6551#topHorseTabs=horse_race_record&bottomHorseTabs=horse_wins |title=Clarentia |publisher=Racing Post |date=2011-06-02 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>

Bahamian Bounty was sold as a yearling for 45,000 [[Guinea (British coin)|gns]] to the Lucayan Stud,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/off-to-the-sales-in-search-of-a-sham-rather-than-a-dud-1365262.html |title=Off to the sales in search of a Sham rather than a dud - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1996-09-27 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> the name used for the horse racing interests of Edward St. George. St. George was a British businessman who lived in the [[Bahamas]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breederscup.com/bio.aspx?id=2049 |title=Lucayan Stud and Irish National Stud |publisher=Breederscup.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> and gave the "Bahamian" prefix to the names many of many of his racehorses including Bahamian Pirate ([[Nunthorpe Stakes]]) and Bahamian Knight ([[Derby Italiano]]).

Bahamian Bounty was originally sent into training with [[David Loder]] at Newmarket. In October 1996 he was bought privately by [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Sheikh Mohammed]] for his [[Godolphin Racing|Godolphin]] organisation for a reported fee of <U+00A3>1 million.<ref name="independent1">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/dettori-unstoppable-as-he-brings-home-bounty-1356690.html |title=Dettori unstoppable as he brings home Bounty - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1996-10-04 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> At the end of the season he was moved to the stable of [[Saeed bin Suroor]], spending the winter in [[Dubai]] before returning to Britain in spring 1997. He was ridden in five of his seven starts by [[Frankie Dettori]].

==Racing career==
===1996: two-year-old season===
Bahamian Bounty made his racecourse debut in July in a six-furlong [[maiden race]] at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Racecourse]]. he raced prominently and briefly led a [[furlong]] from the finish before being beaten a neck  by Grapeshot. Twelve days later he was dropped down in trip for a five-furlong maiden race at [[Great Yarmouth Racecourse|Yarmouth]], for which he started at the unusual odds of 1/11. As the betting suggested, he proved far too good for his four opponents, going clear in the final quarter mile and winning by two and a half lengths in a "canter".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=205320&r_date=1996-07-23&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Scroby Sands Maiden Stakes result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>

In August, Bahamian Bounty was moved directly to Group One level for the Prix Morny at Deauville. Although only five horses took part, they included the odds-on favourite [[Zamindar (horse)|Zamindar]] (an unbeaten brother of [[Zafonic]]), the [[July Stakes]] winner Rich Ground and the year's [[Cartier Racing Awards#Two-Year-Old Filly|outstanding]] filly [[Pas de Reponse]]. Bahamian Bounty and Zamindar disputed the lead from the start and raced together throughout the closing stages, with the English-trained colt prevailing by a short neck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=225687&r_date=1996-08-18&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Prix Morny result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> After the race Loder called him "a lovely horse with a tremendous temperament" and the bookmakers offered him at 16/1 for the following year's [[2000 Guineas]], although his  pedigree suggested that he would be most likely to make an impact as a sprinter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/bounty-in-longodds-mutiny-1310416.html |title=Bounty in long-odds mutiny - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1996-08-19 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>

The six-furlong Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket in October saw Bahamian Bounty sent off the 7/4 favourite ahead of ten rivals including Easycall ([[Richmond Stakes]]), Rich Ground, Muchea ([[Zukunfts-Rennen]]) and Deep Finesse ([[Prix du Bois]]). Dettori held the colt up in the early stages but then had problems finding space for a challenge in the final quarter mile. When a gap appeared Bahamian Bounty "flashed" through to settle the race "in a matter of strides". He idled after hitting the front and had to be driven out to beat Muchea by a head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=204630&r_date=1996-10-03&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Middle Park Stakes result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> After the race Dettori praised the colt's "terrific turn of foot."<ref name="independent1"/>

On his final start of the season, Bahamian Bounty attempted to become the first Middle Park winner to add the seven-furlong [[Dewhurst Stakes]] since [[Diesis (horse)|Diesis]] in 1982. As in the Middle Park Stakes, Bahamian Bounty had trouble finding a clear run after being held up. On this occesion, however, he could not reach the leaders and finished fourth to [[In Command]], beaten less then two lengths.

===1997: three-year-old season===
Bahamian Bounty spent the winter in Dubai before returning to England with the rest of the Godolphin team in late April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing-godolphin-team-in-flying-form-1270035.html |title=Racing: Godolphin team in flying form - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1997-04-29 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> Running for his new stable, Bahamian Bounty failed to reproduce his best form in two starts as a three-year-old. At [[Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamp]] he was made 11/10 joint favourite for the [[Poule d'Essai des Poulains]], but after leading in the middle part of the race he faded badly to finish last of the six runners behind [[Daylami]]. Two months later he returned to a sprint distance in the [[July Cup]] at Newmarket where he finshed fourth of the nine runners behind the 50/1 outsider [[Compton Place]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=238192&r_date=1997-07-10&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=July Cup result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>

==Assessment==
In November 1996, Bahamian Bounty was named [[European Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] at the [[Cartier Racing Awards]], although the situation was somewhat confused, with the [[Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere|Grand Criterium]] winner [[Revoque]] being given the title of Champion Two-Year-Old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/royal-return-of-pounds-51-on-the-tote-for-51-winner-1353344.html |title=Royal return of pounds 51 on the Tote for 5-1 winner - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1996-11-20 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> Bahamian Bounty was also rated behind Revoque in the official International Classification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/revoque-is-top-of-juvenile-class-racing-1283467.html |title=Revoque is top of juvenile class: Racing - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1997-01-16 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>

==Stud career==
Since retiring to the National Stud,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalstud.co.uk/stallions/bahamian-bounty-0001/index.aspx |title=Conformation &#124; Bahamian Bounty |publisher=The National Stud |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> Bahamian Bounty has proved to be a successful stallion, siring the winners of more than five hundred races.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloodstock.racingpost.com/stallionbook/stallion.sd?horse_id=448003&popup=1&tab=stud |title=Bahamian Bounty &#124; Stud Record &#124; Bloodstock Stallion Book &#124; Racing Post |publisher=Bloodstock.racingpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> As might have been predicted from his pedigree and racing career, he has proved particularly effective as a sire of two-year-old and sprinters, his best winners being the full brothers [[Pastoral Pursuits]] ([[July Cup]]) and [[Goodricke (horse)|Goodricke]] ([[Haydock Sprint Cup]]). He has also been "shuttled" to stand at the Eliza Park Stud in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingandsports.com.au/racing/rsNewsArt.asp?NID=27605&story=Bahamian_Bounty's_progeny_show_promise |title=Horse Racing - Horse Racing - Bahamian Bounty's progeny show promise |publisher=Racingandsports.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> In 2011 he stood at a fee of <U+00A3>10,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloodstock.racingpost.com/stallionbook/stallion.sd?horse_id=448003&popup=1&tab=details |title=Bahamian Bounty &#124; Details &#124; Bloodstock Stallion Book &#124; Racing Post |publisher=Bloodstock.racingpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>
