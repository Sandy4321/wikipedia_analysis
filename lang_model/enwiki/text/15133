'''John F. Stossel''' (born [[6 March]] [[1947]]) is a [[consumer]] [[reporter]], [[author]] and [[news presenter|co-anchor]] for the [[ABC News]] show ''[[20/20]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Stossel/story?id=124326&page=1 | title=Excerpt: John Stossel's 'Give Me a Break' | publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=[[2007-02-27]] | first=John | last=Stossel | accessdate =2007-04-13}}</ref>  Stossel began his journalism career as a researcher for [[KGW-TV]] and later became a consumer reporter at [[WCBS-TV]] in [[New York City]] before joining ABC News as consumer editor and reporter on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.  Stossel went on to be a ABC News [[news correspondent|correspondent]], joining the weekly news magazine program ''20/20''.  In his decades as a reporter, Stossel has received numerous honors and awards.  Stossel has also written two books entitled ''Give Me a Break'' and ''Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity''.

Stossel practices [[advocacy journalism]] where he often challenges "[[conventional wisdom]]".<ref name="Townhall bio"/>  His reports, a blend of commentary and reporting, reflect a roughly [[libertarian]] political philosophy and his views on [[economics]] are largely supportive of the [[free market]]. This makes him a "contrarian" in American media and he has been targeted by left-wing organizations that disagree with him.<ref>{{cite web

==Biography and work==
===Education and Early career===
John Stossel was born in [[Chicago Heights]], [[Illinois]], the second of two boys.<ref name="nndb">{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/389/000105074/ | title=John Stossel | publisher=Notable Names Database | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> He overcame a [[stuttering]] problem so he could become a reporter, and is now a supporter and advocate for [[The Stuttering Foundation]].

He began his journalism career as a researcher for [[KGW-TV]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].  He later became a consumer reporter at [[WCBS-TV]] in [[New York City]] before joining [[ABC News]] as consumer editor and reporter on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.

===Personal life===
Stossel lives in New York City with his wife and their two children.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.harpercollins.com/authors/25395/John_Stossel/index.aspx | publisher=HarperCollins | title=John Stossel Biography| accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> John's older brother, Tom, is a doctor.<ref name="nndb" />

===''20/20''===
Stossel was named co-[[news anchor| anchor]] of [[ABC News]]' ''[[20/20]]'' in [[2003#May|May 2003]]. He joined the weekly news magazine program in [[1981]], initially as [[news correspondent|correspondent]].  His "Give Me a Break" segments featured a [[Scepticism#Empirical skepticism|skeptical]] look at subjects ranging from [[government regulation]]s and [[pop culture]] to [[censorship]] and unfounded [[fear]].  The series was [[spinoff (television)|spun off]] into a series of one-hour specials, beginning [[1994]], with titles including "Stupid in America", "Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death?", "Junk Science: What You Know That May Not Be So", "Boys and Girls Are Different", "Freeloaders", "Greed", "Is America #1?", "You Can't Say That!", "Stossel Goes to Washington", "[[The Power of Belief]]", and "Sick in America".

===Publications===
[[Image:Stosselbook.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity'', authored by John Stossel, was published on [[May 1, 2005]].]]
Stossel has written two books. ''Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media'' is an [[autobiography]] documenting his career and philosophical transition from [[Modern liberalism in America|liberalism]] to [[libertarian]]ism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in [[free market]] and private enterprise, support for [[tort reform]], and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks.<ref name="Townhall bio">{{cite web| url=http://www.townhall.com/Columnists/JohnStossel/ | title=Columns by John Stossel | publisher=Townhall.com | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> ''Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel <U+2014> Why Everything You Know Is Wrong'' questions the validity of various [[conventional wisdom]]s, and argues that the belief he is [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] is untrue.

With financial support from the libertarian Palmer R. Chitester Fund, Stossel and ABC News launched a series of educational materials for public schools in 1999 entitled "[http://www.intheclassroom.org/students/index.php Stossel in the Classroom]".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.mediatransparency.org/reprints/brill_stossel.htm | title=Laissez-Faire TV | publisher=Media Transparency | last=Rose |first=Ted |date=2000-03 | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> In 2006, Stossel and ABC released ''Teaching Tools for Economics'', a video series based on the National Council of Economics Education standards.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Stossel/story?id=1936941 | title=Teaching Tools for Economics from John Stossel | publisher=ABC News| date=[[2007-04-29]] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

==Philosophical influences==
===Contrarianism===
Stossel's news reports and writings attempt to debunk popular beliefs.  His ''Myths and Lies'' series of ''[[20/20]]'' specials challenges a range of widely held beliefs.  He also hosted ''[[The Power of Belief (TV)|The Power of Belief]]'' ([[October 6]] [[1998]]), an ABC News Special that focused on the claims of the paranormal and people's desire to believe. Another report outlined why opposition to [[DDT]] is misplaced and that the ban on DDT has resulted in the death of millions of children,<ref name="DDTban">{{cite web | url=http://www.acsh.org/healthissues/newsID.442/healthissue_detail.asp | title=The DDT Ban Turns 30 <U+2014> Millions Dead of Malaria Because of Ban, More Deaths Likely | publisher=American Council on Science and Health | date=2002-06-01 | accessdate=2007-11-17 | last=Seavey | first=Todd }}</ref> mostly in poor nations.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/10/hooray_for_ddts_lifesaving_com.html | title=Hooray for DDT's Life-Saving Comeback | publisher=Real Clear Politics | date=[[2006-10-04]] | last=Stossel | first=John | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

Stossel agrees that [[global warming]] exists, but he is skeptical of definitive claims that it is caused by human activity. He asserts the science is not settled regarding the cause, and has argued that there is not a scientific consensus. He also challenges the notion that man-made [[climate change]] would have net negative consequences, pointing to warmer periods in human history.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3061015 | title=The Global Warming Myth? | publisher=ABC News | last=Stossel | first=John | date=[[2007-04-20]] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> Central to his argument, he argues that groups and individuals get much more public attention, donations, and government funding when they proclaim "this will be terrible" than groups that say "this is nothing to worry about." He points to groups like the [[World Wildlife Fund]], [[Greenpeace]], [[Rachel Carson]], the [[Environmental Defense Fund]], the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], and former U.S. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] as examples of environmental [[scaremonger]]s.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/07/a_convenient_lie.html | title=A Convenient Lie | publisher=Real Clear Politics | last=Stossel | first=John | date=[[2006-07-05]] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> At [[Live Earth New York]], Stossel was one of a handful of media personalities named by [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] [[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.]] as "these Flat Earthers, these corporate toadies, lying to you, lying to the American public, and telling you that global warming doesn't exist...."<ref>{{cite web| last =Johnson| first =Richard  | title =Warming War Has Foes on Fire| publisher =[[New York Post]]|date=July 13, 2007| url =http://www.nypost.com/seven/07132007/gossip/pagesix/pagesix.htm  | accessdate = 2007-10-02 }}</ref>

===Libertarianism===
As a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], Stossel believes in both [[Individual rights|personal freedom]] and the [[free market]]. He frequently uses  television airtime to advance these views and challenge viewers' distrust of [[capitalism|free market capitalism]] and [[Competition (economics)#Economics and business competition|economic competition]].  He told ''[[The Oregonian]]'', on [[26 October]] [[1994]]:

{{quote|I started out by viewing the marketplace as a cruel place, where you need intervention by government and lawyers to protect people. But after watching the regulators work, I have come to believe that markets are magical and the best protectors of the consumer. It is my job to explain the beauties of the free market.<ref>''[[The Oregonian]]'', 26 October 1994</ref>}}

{{quote|I'm a little embarrassed about how long it took me to see the folly of most government intervention. It was probably 15 years before I really woke up to the fact that almost everything government attempts to do, it makes worse.<ref name="Sigall" />}}

Stossel argues that personal [[greed]] creates an incentive to work and to innovate.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/JohnStossel/2006/04/26/greed_is_good |title=Greed is good | last=Stossel | first=John | publisher=Townhall.com | date=[[2006-04-26]] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> He has promoted [[school choice]] as a way to improve American schools, because he believes that when people are given a choice they will choose the better schools for their children.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/JohnStossel/2006/08/30/schools_need_competition_now |title=Schools need competition now | publisher=Townhall.com | last=Stossel | first=John | date=[[2006-08-30]] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> Referring to educational tests that rank American students lower than others he says:

{{quote|The people who run the international tests told us, "the biggest predictor of student success is choice." Nations that "attach the money to the kids" and thereby allow parents to choose between different public and private schools have higher test scores. This should be no surprise; competition makes us better.<ref name="smearchoice">{{cite news|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/JohnStossel/2006/07/26/smearing_education_choice |title=Smearing Education Choice | publisher=Townhall.com | last=Stossel | first=John | date=[[2006-07-26]] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>}}

He has also criticized government programs as inefficient, wasteful, and harmful.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/JohnStossel/2006/08/16/does_government_stupidity_know_any_bounds | title=Does Government Stupidity Know Any Bounds | publisher=Townhall.com | last=Stossel | first=John | date=[[2006-08-16]] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

==Awards, praise, and controversies==
===Awards===
Stossel has won 19 [[Emmy Award]]s. He was honored five times for excellence in consumer reporting by the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]], and has received the [[George Polk Awards|George Polk Award for Outstanding Local Reporting]] and the [[George Foster Peabody Award|Peabody Award]]. In one year, according to Stossel in his book ''Give Me A Break'', "I got so many Emmys, another winner thanked me in his acceptance speech 'for not having an entry in this category'".<ref name="gmabbook">{{cite book | first=Stossel| last=John| year=2005 | title=Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media... | edition=Paperback | publisher=Harper Paperbacks | id=ISBN 0-06-052915-6 }}</ref> According to Stossel, when he was in favor of government intervention and skeptical of business he was deluged with awards, but in 2006 he joked, "They like me less... Once I started applying the same skepticism to government, I stopped winning awards."<ref name="Sigall">{{cite news| url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/6/2/91815.shtml?s=lh | title=John Stossel: Not Afraid to Tell the Truth | last=Sigall | first=Ed | publisher=NewsMax | date=[[2006-06-03]] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

===Praise===
<U+201C>John Stossel is the most consistently thought-provoking TV reporter of our time," said the Dallas Morning News.<ref name="media maverick">{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.org/events/detail.asp?eventID=92 | title=Confessions of a Media Maverick: Exposing Hucksters, Cheats and Scam Artists | publisher=The Independent Institute Conference Center | date=[[2004-01-30]] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>  [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Milton Friedman]] lauded John Stossel saying, "Stossel is that rare creature, a TV commentator who understands economics, in all its subtlety."<ref name="media maverick" />  [[P.

He seeks the truths that destroy truisms, wields reason against all that<U+2019>s unreasonable, and ... puncture(s) sanctimonious idealism. ... He makes the maddening mad.

===Controversies===
Liberal economist [[James K. Galbraith]] said that Stossel, in a story on [[laissez-faire]] economics in September 1999, used an out of context clip of Galbraith to make it seem that Galbraith had said nearly the opposite of what he meant. Stossel denied that Galbraith's views had been misrepresented and changed the words with which he introduced the Galbraith clip in rebroadcasts of the program.<ref name="treatment">{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1134 | title=The Stossel Treatment | publisher=Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting | first=Rachel | last=Coen | date=2003-03 | accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref><ref>Rose, Ted (March 2000) [http://www.mediatransparency.org/reprints/brill_stossel.htm "Laissez-Faire TV: ABC's John Stossel is a man on a mission to teach Americans about the evils of government regulation and the rewards of free enterprise."] ''Brill's Content''</ref><ref>{{cite web

A February 2000 story about organic vegetables on ''20/20'' included statements by Stossel that tests had shown that neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food was more likely to be contaminated by [[E. coli]] bacteria.  The [[Environmental Working Group]] objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides.  They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's recollection that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, uncorrected, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in the [[New York Times]] confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.<ref name="Rutenberg">{{cite news | last=Rutenberg | first=Jim | title=Report on Organic Foods Is Challenged | publisher=The New York Times | date=[[2000-07-31]] | url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/financial/073100abc-organic.html | accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=124196&page=1 | title=20/20: Stossel Apology for Organic Food Report | date=[[2000-08-11]] | last=Stossel | first=John | publisher=ABC News | accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref><ref name="Rutenberg2">{{cite news | last=Rutenberg | first=Jim | coauthors=Barringer, Felicity | title=MEDIA; Apology Highlights ABC Reporter's Contrarian Image | publisher=The New York Times | date=[[2000-08-14]] | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E3DA133FF937A2575BC0A9669C8B63&sec=health&pagewanted=print | accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref><ref name=blasphemer>{{cite news | url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/mcelroy/mcelroy21.html | title=Blaspheming Organic Food: The Persecution of John Stossel | last=McElroy | first=Wendy | date=[[2000-08-15]] | publisher=LewRockwell.com | accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref><ref name="givemeafake">{{cite news| url=http://www.ewg.org/reports/givemeafake | title=Give Me a Fake: Stossel Under Fire| publisher=Environmental Working Group | date=[[2000-09-06]] | accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref> 

In a March 2007 segment about finances and lifestyles of [[televangelist]]s, 20/20 aired a clip of a TV minister originally broadcast by the [[Lifetime Network]] in 1997.  The clip made it seem that the minister was describing his wealth in extravagant terms, when actually, he was telling a parable about a rich man.  ABC News twice aired a retraction and apologized for the error.  The minister filed a lawsuit against Stossel, his source for the clip, 20/20, and ABC for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wavenewspapers.com/default.asp?sourceid=&smenu=71&twindow=&mad=&sdetail=6067&wpage=1&skeyword=&sidate=&ccat=&ccatm=&restate=&restatus=&reoption=&retype=&repmin=&repmax=&rebed=&rebath=&subname=&pform=&sc=1019&hn=wavenewspapers&he=.com | title=Price Strikes Back at ABC | last=Johnson | first=Gene C., Jr. | publisher=Los Angeles Wave | date=[[2007-08-02]] | accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1309570171.html?dids=1309570171:1309570171&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jul+25%2C+2007&author=Alana+Semuels&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=C.1&desc=TELEVISION%3B+Preacher+sues+%6020%2F20%2C%27+alleging+defamation | title=Preacher sues '20/20,' alleging defamation | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=[[2007-07-25]] | last=Semuels | first=Alana | accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref>

In an opinion piece published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in September 2007 called "Sick Sob Stories", Stossel described the case of Tracy and Julie Pierce that was explored in [[Michael Moore]]'s film, ''[[Sicko]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118964470258225901.html | title=Sick Sob Stories | publisher=Wall Street Journal | last=Stossel | first=John | date=[[2007-09-13]] | accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref> Julie criticized Stossel, saying her husband would have been saved by the Canadian health care system, and she thought Stossel should have interviewed her and her doctor before writing about them.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/news/article.php?id=10226 | title=Open Letter to ABC's John Stossel ... from Julie Pierce, American SiCKO | publisher=Michael Moore | last=Pierce | first=Julie | date=[[2007-09-14]] | accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref> Stossel expressed sympathy, but said she had been misled to believe the treatment was routinely available in Canada.

Some organizations from the [[Left-wing politics|left side]] of the [[political spectrum]], such as [[Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting]] (FAIR) and [[Media Matters for America]] (MMfA), have criticized Stossel's work,<ref name="fairprofile">{{cite web | url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=19&media_outlet_id=19 | title=John Stossel | publisher=Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref><ref name="mmprofile">{{cite web | url=http://mediamatters.org/issues_topics/search_results?qstring=john+stossel | title=John Stossel | publisher=Media Matters for America | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> for an ostensible lack of balance of coverage and distortion of facts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewg.org/files/tamperingwithtruth_letter.pdf | title=Letter from parents to Mr. Stossel |date=2001-06-24| publisher=Environmental Working Group | accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref> For his position on climate change, Stossel was criticized in 2001 by FAIR for using "highly selective...information" in his ''Tampering with Nature'' documentary: "Instead of reporting the increasingly strong scientific consensus on global warming, Stossel chose to highlight the views of so-called "skeptics," giving center stage to three dissenters from among the 2,000 scientists of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which recently released a report stating that global temperatures are rising almost twice as fast as previously thought."<ref name=fair>[http://www.fair.org/activism/stossel-tampering.html FAIR Action Alert: Stossel Tampers with the Facts]</ref>

David Mastio of Salon.com wrote in February 2000 that Stossel has a conflict of interest in donating profits from his public speaking engagements to, among others, a non-profit called "Stossel in the Classroom" which includes material for use in schools, some of which uses material made by Stossel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.salon.com/media/feature/2000/02/25/stossel/ | title=Prime-time propagandist | date=[[2000-02-25]] | last=Mastio | first=David | publisher=Salon Media | accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020107/dowie/3 | title=A Teflon Correspondent | last=Dowie | first=Mark | date=[[2001-12-20]] | accessdate=2007-10-06 | publisher=The Nation}}</ref>  Stossel claims in his books that he also receives criticism from the political right, because of his libertarian stance on such issues as [[drug legalization]].

===The Schults incident===

On December 28, 1984, during an interview for ''20/20'' on [[professional wrestling]], wrestler [[David Schults]] struck Stossel after Stossel asked if professional wrestling was fake.
