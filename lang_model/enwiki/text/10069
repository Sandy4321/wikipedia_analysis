'''Leonard Guy Ford, Jr.''' (February 18, 1926 &ndash; March 14, 1972) was an [[American football]] player from 1944 to 1958.  He played [[college football]] for the [[University of Michigan]] and professional football for the [[Los Angeles Dons]], [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Green Bay Packers]]. He was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1976 and the [[University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor]] in 1996.

Ford was an all-city athlete at his high school in [[Washington, D.C.]], and attended [[Morgan State University]] after graduating in 1944. After a brief stint in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] the following year, he transferred to Michigan, where he played on the [[Michigan Wolverines football]] team as an offensive and defensive [[End (American football)|end]]. He played for Michigan from 1945 to 1947 and was a member of the undefeated [[1947 Michigan Wolverines football team|1947 team]] that has been selected as the best team in the history of Michigan football.

Ford was passed over in all 32 rounds of the [[1948 NFL Draft]], but was selected by the Los Angeles Dons of the rival [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), where he played for two seasons as an offensive and defensive end. After the AAFC dissolved in 1949, Ford played eight seasons as a [[defensive end]] for the Cleveland Browns.  During those eight seasons, the Browns advanced to the NFL championship game seven times, won three championships, and allowed the fewest points in the NFL six times. Ford was one of the dominant defensive players of his era, having a rare combination of size and speed that helped him disrupt opposing offenses and force [[fumble]]s. He was selected as a first-team All-NFL player five times and played in four Pro Bowls.   

Ford was traded to the Packers in 1958, but played there just one season before retiring. He worked for the Detroit recreation department from 1963 to 1972.  He suffered a heart attack and died in 1972 at age 46.

==Early years==

Ford was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1926.  His father, Leonard G. Ford, Sr., was a Virginia native who was employed as a "skilled laborer" by the federal government in 1920 and as a printing operator at the [[United States Government Printing Office|Government Printing Office]] in 1940. His mother, Jeraldine, was also a Virginia native who worked as a [[social worker]] in a [[settlement house]] in 1940.  Ford had an older sister, Anita, and a younger brother, Claude.<ref>1930 U.S. Census for Leonard G. Ford and family.

In a mid-October game against the [[1950 Chicago Cardinals season|Chicago Cardinals]], an elbow by [[Pat Harder]] broke Ford's nose, cheekbone, and [[maxilla]] (upper jaw), knocked out two teeth, loosened several teeth and chipped another.<ref name=Surgery/> Ford, who had been fighting with Harder throughout the game, punched him following the play, resulting in a penalty, his ejection from the game and a $50 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50|1950}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) fine.<ref name="JockBio bio" /> NFL commissioner [[Bert Bell]] withdrew the fine when the damage to Ford's face was revealed.<ref name="JockBio bio" /> Ford's facial injuries were so severe that a plastic surgery was required, "virtually rebuilding the big end's face."<ref name=Surgery>{{cite news|title=Bell Rescinds Slugging Fine When Notified Ford Undergoes Facial Surgery: Browns' Star Out Indefinitely|author=Howard Sauerbrei|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=October 17, 1950|page=27}}</ref>  The Browns' long-time team doctor, Vic Ippolito, described Ford's injuries as "a sickening sight."<ref name=Doc>{{cite news|title=A doctor's diary|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=January 29, 1978|page=3-2}}</ref>

Because of the injury, Ford started only four regular season games in 1950.  However, he asked to be reinstated for the [[1950 NFL Championship Game]].  Head coach Paul Brown agreed to allow Ford to suit up after receiving approval from the team doctor and arranging for a special mask to be built to protect Ford from further injury.  Ford had been on a liquid diet until late November and dropped from 240 to 215 pound, though he was back up to 223 pounds shortly before the championship game.<ref>{{cite news|title=Len Ford Rejoins Browns, May See Action In Title Game Sunday: Star End to Don Mask For Battle|author=Harold Sauerbrei|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=December 21, 1950|page=27}}</ref>  As the championship game got underway, Ford sat on the bench as the Rams moved the ball 82 yards down the field for a touchdown. Browns head coach Paul Brown knew the defense had to tighten, and he called on Ford to enter the game.   The ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'' later called this "one of Len Ford's great moments."<ref name=Clary/>  Paul Brown stated that Ford "showed me that day he really was a man."<ref name=CH/>  Brown later recalled that Ford was the team's "only real hope of plugging a hole" and recalled one sequence as a defining moment in the game:<blockquote>"I'll always remember one three-play sequence where he threw [[Vitamin Smith]] for a 14-yard loss on a reverse, sacked [[Bob Waterfield|[Bob] Waterfield]] for another big loss and finally smothered [[Glenn Davis (American football)|Glenn Davis]] on an end run.  That turned the game around for us."<ref name=Clary>{{cite news|title=December 24, 1950: A Great Day for the Browns|author=Jack Clary|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=December 21, 1980|pages=166-170}}</ref></blockquote>
The Browns' defense held the Rams scoreless in the fourth quarter, and the Browns won the championship game by a 30-28 score in their first season in the league.<ref name=Clary/>

====1951 season====
Ford continued to excel as a pass-rusher in 1951, when the [[1951 Cleveland Browns season|Browns]] again advanced to the [[1951 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]] but lost to the [[1951 Los Angeles Rams season|Rams]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=230<U+2013>234}} He recovered four fumbles during the season and was named a first-team [[All-Pro]] by both the ''[[Associated Press]]'' (AP) and the ''[[United Press International]]'' (UPI).<ref name="PFR stats" /> He was also named to the [[1952 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]], the NFL's all-star game.<ref name="PFR stats" /> Ford's dominating play allowed Brown to assign him to two offensive linemen, giving Cleveland the latitude to put four men on the line and use three linebackers in what is now known as the [[4<U+2013>3 defense]].<ref name="JockBio bio" /> Cleveland's defensive coach [[Blanton Collier]] later recalled the thinking behind moving Ford: "We knew we had to get him in closer where his talents as a pass rusher could best be utilized.  So we moved both tackles in and dropped the linebackers off the outside.  It may have been the beginning of today's 4<U+2013>3 defense."<ref>{{cite news|title=Grid Hall of Fame taps Ford|author=Chuck Heaton|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|page=1-C}}</ref>  Collier also noted that "Len was very aggressive and had that touch of meanness in him that you find in most defensive players."<ref name="JockBio bio" />

===Green Bay Packers===

In May 1958, the Browns traded Ford to the [[Green Bay Packers]] in exchange for a draft choice.  Green Bay coach [[Ray McLean]] said at the time that he acquired Ford for his talent at putting pressure on the quarterback and noted that "he's one of the toughest guys in the league to block because of his speed, size and agility."<ref>{{cite news|title=Packers Acquire Browns' Ford|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=May 19, 1958|page=Pt. 2, pg. 2|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&dat=19580519&id=eGtQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WhAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3694,4972122}}</ref><ref name="Ford traded">{{cite news|title=Browns Trade Lennie Ford to Packers|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3y5aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MkwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2717,2766399&dq=len+ford+green+bay&hl=en|accessdate=September 6, 2013|newspaper=St. Joseph Gazette|date=May 20, 1958|agency=Associated Press|location=Cleveland|page=7}}</ref> The [[1958 Green Bay Packers season|1958 Green Bay team]] won just one game in Ford's lone season there.<ref>{{cite web|title=1958 Green Bay Packers|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=August 2, 2014|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/1958.htm}}</ref> Ford suffered multiple broken fingers before the last game of the 1958 season, and, because he was unable to play, the Packers refused to pay Ford the final $916.66 due on his contract.

===Career statistics and legacy===
Ford held a NFL record with 20 career fumble recoveries at the time of his retirement.<ref name="JockBio bio" /> Ford was successful in part because of his combination of quickness and size.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=300}} Few players of his era who were as tall and big as he was could move as fast; only [[Larry Brink]] of the Rams was close to him in proportions.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=300}}

==Family and later years==
In 1951, Ford married [[Geraldine Bledsoe Ford]] (1926<U+2013>2003),<ref name="Ford in Encyclopedia of Cleveland" /> who was a lawyer in the 1950s,<ref name=Jet/> and in the mid-1960s became the first African-American woman to serve as a judge in Michigan.<ref>{{cite news|title=So-Called White Backlash Not Shown in Maryland|publisher=Jet|date=November 24, 1966|page=11|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=krgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=%22lenny+ford%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hoPdU5WdGYvzoASuvYK4Cg&ved=0CF0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22lenny%20ford%22&f=false}}</ref> They had two daughters, Anita and Deborah,<ref name=WHT/> and divorced in 1959.<ref name="Ford in Encyclopedia of Cleveland" />  

While playing in the NFL, Ford worked during the off-season in a Detroit real estate office. He developed a reputation for being "cagey with the dollar" and told ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' magazine in 1955: "In what other sport can a boy just graduated from college make $5,000 in his first six months, then have a half-year left to make more money?"<ref name=Jet>{{cite news|title=Inside Sports|author=A.

Sports writer [[Chuck Heaton]] wrote that Ford's life was "pretty much down hill" after he retired from professional football.  Heaton recalled that, in his later years, Ford seemed in poor physical condition, "only a shadow of the mighty end he once was."<ref name=CH/>  Ford still aspired to obtain his law license, but, according to Heaton, "appeared to have lost the drive which made him such a great football player."<ref name=CH/> [[Don Newcombe]], who became good friends with Ford, was more blunt.  Interviewed in 1980, Newcombe said that Ford's life was "decimated" because of alcohol.  Newcombe added: "He became a wino, stumbling around in alleys. He gave up his life for alcohol."<ref>{{cite news|title=Newcombe is upset about alcohol abuse|author=Gregory S. Simms|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=October 23, 1980|page=3-D}}</ref>
