The '''''Pennsylvania'' class''' consisted of two [[super-dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s built for the [[United States Navy]] just before the [[World War I|First World War]]. The ships were named {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}} and {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|2}}, after the American states of the same names. They constituted the United States' second battleship design to adhere to the "[[all or nothing (armor)|all or nothing]]" armor scheme, and were the newest American [[capital ship]]s when the United States entered the First World War.

The {{sclass-|Nevada|battleship|1}}s represented a marked increase in the United States' dreadnought technology, and the ''Pennsylvania'' class was intended to continue this with slight increases in the ships' capabilities, including two extra {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} guns and improved underwater protection. The class was the second [[standard type battleship|standard type]] battleship class to join the United States Navy, along with the preceding ''Nevada'' and the succeeding {{sclass-|New Mexico|battleship|5}}, {{sclass-|Tennessee|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|5}} classes.

In service, the ''Pennsylvania'' class saw limited use in the First World War, as a shortage of [[fuel oil|oil fuel]] in the United Kingdom meant that only the coal-burning ships of [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|Battleship Division Nine]] were sent. Both were sent across the Atlantic to France after the war for the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], and were transferred to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] before being significantly modernized from 1929 to 1931. For the remainder of the inter-war period, the ships were used in exercises and [[fleet problem]]s. Both ''Pennsylvania'' and ''Arizona'' were present during the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. ''Arizona'' was sunk in a [[USS Arizona (BB-39)#Attack on Pearl Harbor|massive magazine explosion]] and was turned into [[USS Arizona Memorial|a memorial]] after the war, while ''Pennsylvania'', in [[dry dock]] at the time, received only minor damage. ''Pennsylvania'' went on to serve as a [[shore bombardment]] ship until the October 1944 [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#The Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October)|Battle of Surigao Strait]], the last battle ever between battleships. ''Pennsylvania'' was severely damaged by a torpedo in late 1945. With minimal repairs, it was used in [[Operation Crossroads|Operation ''Crossroads'']], part of the [[Bikini atomic experiments]], before being expended as a [[target ship]] in 1948.

== Background ==
{{main|Nevada-class battleship|l1=''Nevada''-class battleship|Standard-type battleship}}
[[File:Oklahoma (BB37). Starboard bow, underway, 01-15-1916.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|right|The ''Nevada'' class, represented here by {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|2}} in 1916, were the first American battleship class to utilize triple gun turrets, the "[[all or nothing (armor)|all or nothing]]" armor concept, oil fuel, and [[steam turbine]]s (albeit the latter only in {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}}); all of these innovations were continued in the ''Pennsylvania'' class. Photograph <span class="plainlinks">[http://arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/ExternalIdSearch?id=512922 courtesy]</span> of the National Archives and Records Administration.]]
The preceding ''Nevada''-class battleships represented a leap forward from previous American battleship technology and from most contemporary foreign designs. These ships were the first in the world to employ the "[[all or nothing (armor)|all or nothing]]" armor scheme that characterized every succeeding American battleship. Devised with the knowledge that engagement ranges between battle fleets was growing greater as [[main battery]] sizes increased, the system moved away from previous designs that used heavy, medium, and light armor, in favor of using only heavy armor to protect vital areas on the ship. The new system envisioned that, at long ranges, ships would be attacked with only [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor piercing]] (AP) projectiles, stoppable only by heavy armor. Medium or light armor would only serve to detonate the shells. By removing gun turrets and reducing the overall protected length of the ship, the navy's designers were able to devote the weight savings to the [[belt armor|belt]], as well as extra [[deck (ship)|deck armor]] to protect against plunging shells.<ref>Friedman, ''Design and Development'', 65<U+2013>66; Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 101<U+2013>02.</ref>

In issuing desired specifications for the design that would become the ''Nevada'' class, the navy's [[General Board of the United States Navy|General Board]] asked for triple gun turrets, i.e. three guns mounted per turret. They were very unsatisfied with the awkward placement required on classes preceding the ''Nevada''s, which had between five and six two-gun turrets<U+2014>yet moving back to the four two-gun turrets of the {{sclass-|South Carolina|battleship|4}} would be a significant loss in firepower. Although a triple turret was first proposed in American professional magazines in 1901 and briefly considered for the ''South Carolina''s, it was not even in the experimental stage<U+2014>the first turret was authorized in 1911 and would not be ready until months after contracts for the new ships would be signed with the shipbuilders. The decision to go ahead with the turret was a calculated gamble, but proved to be a qualified success: the only issue came with shell interference when the center and outside guns were fired simultaneously, which was easily solved by waiting for short periods in between individual firings. The major benefit, though, came from the weight savings from the reduction of an armored [[barbette]] and turret. These gains were used in heavier armor, making the "all or nothing" concept a reality.<ref>Friedman, ''Design and Development'', 134<U+2013>35; Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 102, 107, 111.</ref>

These ''Nevada''s were also the first American battleships to use exclusively [[fuel oil|oil fuel]], which had greater thermal efficiency than firing with coal or coal sprayed with oil.
The cumulative effect of the change was measured by the navy as a fifty-five&nbsp;percent increase in steam production per pound of fuel (in a design for an oil-fired version of the {{sclass-|New York|battleship|4}}). This would give oil-fired vessels additional range, an important consideration for ships based in the Pacific Ocean, but the United States Navy's [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] (C&R) pointed out what it saw as the unfortunate side effects, including a lower center of gravity, higher [[metacentric height]], and the loss of coal bunkers, which were employed as part of the armor protection. However, just a few years later oil tanks below the waterline were considered indispensable parts of the underwater armor scheme employed in American dreadnoughts.<ref>Friedman, ''Design and Development'', 93<U+2013>95; Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 102, 104<U+2013>05.</ref>

== Design ==
The General Board's call for a new 1913 [[fiscal year]] battleship design was sent in June 1911 with the recent ''Nevada'' innovations in mind. They desired a ship with a main battery of twelve 14-inch guns in triple turrets, a secondary battery of twenty-one 5-inch guns, a speed of {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h}}, and armor equivalent to that of the ''Nevada''s. C&R's first sketch was unsatisfactory; their lengthy design of {{convert|625|ft|m}} and {{convert|30000|LT|t}} actually had less armor than the ''Nevada''s, with a {{convert|12.5|in|mm|adj=on}} belt.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 113.</ref>

The design process was marked by various efforts to meet the General Board's specifications with only a moderate increase in tonnage over the ''Nevada'' class. Between January and March 1912, thirteen sketches were prepared for consideration by C&R with reciprocating or turbine engines that traded either speed or metacentric height for armor. Some later designs gave up a half knot of speed to free up about {{convert|500|LT|t}}, enough to thicken the belt from {{convert|13.5|to|15|in|mm}} and the barbettes to {{convert|14|in|mm}}. The choice between double or triple turrets was also still an issue, as the ''Nevada'' class had not been completed yet. The [[Bureau of Ordnance]] was in favor of waiting for test results, rather than risking reverting to two-gun 14-inch turrets or moving up to two-gun 16-inch turrets.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 113<U+2013>15.</ref>

In March 1912, C&R proposed their seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth designs to the General Board for approval. The eighth and ninth designs were the ones to give up a half knot of speed, while the tenth was a design with four triple turrets and {{convert|1200|LT|t}} lighter than the ''Nevada'' class ships. In April, the General Board chose the seventh design, which satisfied all of their requirements, albeit on the largest displacement, {{convert|31300|LT|t}}. The length was fixed at {{convert|630|ft|m}}, the beam at {{convert|93|ft|m}}, and the draft at {{convert|28.5|ft|m}}. Steam turbines gave the design {{convert|30500|shp}} and {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h}}, while the main armor belt was 13.5&nbsp;inches tapering to {{convert|8|in|mm}} at the ends. This design was further refined and emerged in a completed state in September. The delay was partially due to tests on the proposed armor, which were completed in June 1912 and resulted in significant alterations to the ''Pennsylvania'' class' underwater protection.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 114<U+2013>15.</ref>

The ''Pennsylvania''-class ships were significantly larger than their predecessors, the {{sclass-|Nevada|battleship|4}}. They had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|600|ft|1}}, an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|608|ft|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|97|ft|1}} (at the [[waterline]]), and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|29|ft|3|in|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. This was {{convert|25|ft|m|1}} longer than the older ships. Its designed [[standard displacement|standard]] and full load displacements were {{convert|31400|LT|t}} and {{convert|32440|LT|t}}, respectively, but they actually displaced {{convert|29158|LT|t}} standard and {{convert|31917|LT|t}} at full load, over {{convert|4000|LT|MT|-1}} more than the older ships. The class had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|7.82|ft|1}} at full load.<ref name="f0">Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 440.</ref>

The ships had four direct-drive [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]] sets, each of which drove a propeller {{convert|12|ft|1.5|in|1}} in diameter.<ref>Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 360.</ref> They were powered by twelve [[Babcock & Wilcox]] [[water-tube boiler]]s. The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|31500|shp|lk=in}}, but only achieved {{convert|29366|shp|abbr=on}} during ''Pennsylvania''{{'}}s sea trials, when it slightly exceeded its designed speed of {{convert|21|kn|lk=in}}.<ref name="f0" /> However, ''Pennsylvania'' reached {{convert|21.75|kn}} during full-power trials in 1916, and ''Arizona'' reached {{convert|21.5|kn}} in September 1924.<ref>Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 305; "Trials of Our Latest Dreadnought," ''Scientific American'', 297.</ref> The class was designed to normally carry {{convert|1548|LT|t|0}} of fuel oil, but had a maximum capacity of {{convert|2305|LT|t|0}}. At full capacity, they could steam at a speed of {{convert|12|knots}} for an estimated {{convert|6070|nmi|-1|lk=in|abbr=on}}, though this could be extended to {{convert|7585|nmi|-1}} with a [[:wikt:foul#Adjective|clean bottom]]. They had four {{convert|300|kW|0|adj=on}} [[turbo generator]]s.<ref name="f0" />

The ''Pennsylvania'' class carried twelve [[14"/45 caliber gun|14-inch]]/45 [[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] guns in triple [[gun turret]]s.<ref name="f0" /> The guns could not elevate independently and were limited to a maximum elevation of +15<U+00B0> which gave them a maximum range of {{convert|21000|yd}}.<ref>Wright, "The U.S. Navy's Study of the Loss of the Battleship Arizona," 66, 123, 285.</ref> The ships carried 100 shells for each gun. Defense against [[torpedo boat]]s was provided by twenty-two 51-caliber [[5"/51 caliber gun|five-inch guns]] mounted in individual [[casemate]]s in the sides of the hull; these proved vulnerable to sea spray and could not be worked in heavy seas.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 116, 440.</ref> At an elevation of 15<U+00B0>, they had a maximum range of {{convert|14050|yd}}.<ref>Campbell, ''Naval Weapons of World War II'', 136.</ref> Each gun was provided with 230 rounds of ammunition.<ref name="f0" /> The ships mounted four 50-caliber [[3"/50 caliber gun|three-inch guns]] for [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] defense, although only two were fitted when completed. The other pair were added shortly afterward on top of Turret III.<ref>Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 19.</ref> The class also mounted two {{convert|21|in|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s and carried 24 [[torpedo]]es for them.<ref name="f0" />

The ''Pennsylvania''-class design continued the all-or-nothing principle of armoring only the most important areas of the battleships, which began in the preceding ''Nevada'' class. The waterline armor belt of [[Krupp armor]] measured {{convert|13.5|in|mm|0}} thick and only covered the class' machinery spaces and [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]]. It had a total height of {{convert|17|ft|6|in|1}}, of which {{convert|8|ft|9.75|in|1}} was below the waterline; beginning {{convert|2|ft|4|in|1}} below the waterline, the belt tapered to its minimum thickness of {{convert|8|in|0}}.<ref name="f0" /> The transverse [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] at each end of the ships ranged from 13 to 8&nbsp;inches in thickness. The faces of the gun turrets were {{convert|18|in|0}} thick while the sides were {{convert|9|-|10|in}} thick and the turret roofs were protected by {{convert|5|in|0}} of armor. The armor of the barbettes was {{convert|18|to|4.5|in|mm|0}} thick. The [[conning tower]] was protected by {{convert|16|in|0}} of armor and had a roof eight inches thick.<ref name="s9" />

The main armor deck was three plates thick with a total thickness of {{convert|3|in|0}}; over the steering gear the armor increased to {{convert|6.25|in|0}} in two plates. Beneath it was the splinter deck that ranged from {{convert|1.5|to|2|in|mm|0}} in thickness.<ref name="f5">Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 115, 118, 440.</ref> The boiler uptakes were protected by a conical [[mantlet]] that ranged from {{convert|9|to|15|in}} in thickness.<ref name="s9">Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 359.</ref> A three-inch torpedo bulkhead was placed {{convert|9|ft|6|in|1}} inboard from the side, and the class was provided with a complete [[double bottom]]. Testing in mid-1914 revealed that this system could withstand {{convert|300|lb}} of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]].<ref name="f5" />

The authorization for the two ''Pennsylvania'' class ships faced political opposition for being too weak and expensive. Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] believed that a much more capable warship was needed because of the shocking increase in battleship size over the previous few years<U+2014>between 1907 (the {{sclass-|Delaware|battleship|4}}) and 1912, the displacement of American battleships increased by about  fifty percent, from around {{convert|20000|LT|t}} to {{convert|30000|LT|t}}.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 115<U+2013>16.</ref> Tillman proposed a "maximum battleship" in a Senate [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] in July 1912, which was adopted unanimously:

{{User:The ed17/Blockquote|''Resolved'': That the Committee on Naval Affairs [is] instructed to investigate and report to the Senate&nbsp;... the object being to find out from official sources the maximum size and maximum draft, the maximum armament, and the maximum armor to make the best battleship or cruiser the world has ever seen or ever will see; to have this country own the greatest marine engine of war ever constructed or ever to be constructed under known conditions; and to report whether one such overpowering vessel would not in its judgement be better for this country to build than to continue by increasing taxation to spend the millions and millions of dollars now in prospect in the race for naval supremacy.&nbsp;... Let us leave some money in the Treasury for other more necessary and useful expenditures, such as good roads, controlling the floods in the Mississippi, draining swamp land in the South, and irrigating the arid land in the West. (S 361, 62th Cong., 2nd sess.)}}

Tillman's proposal, however, was treated in his own words as a "joke"; the ''[[World Affairs|Advocate of Peace]]'' stated that "it is nearly impossible to read this&nbsp;... without having an inextinguishable bout of laughter."<ref>Tillman and Moffet, ''Construction of Battleships'', 3; "The Tillman Maximum Battleship," ''Advocate of Peace'', 182.</ref> Still, C&R completed multiple studies of a maximum battleship constrained only by technological limitations. The first design submitted by C&R was a severely enlarged ''Nevada'', or a  {{convert|38000|LT|t}} ship with twelve 14-inch guns, {{convert|17|to|9|in|mm}} belt armor, and a maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn}} for a price of $19.5&nbsp;million. A later sketch dropped the speed to {{convert|20|kn}} to see the effect on displacement and cost, which it dropped to {{convert|35000|LT|t}} and $17&nbsp;million, respectively, and the consequent shortening of the ship would allow it to enter the [[dry dock]]s in New York and [[Norfolk Naval Yard| Norfolk]]. Tillman was concerned with this speed, however, and another study increased the speed to {{convert|25|kn}}, trading it for four 14-inch guns, or one-third of the main battery, and much of the armor.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 148<U+2013>49.</ref>{{efn-ua|For further information on the these studies, see A.D. Zimm, "Build the Limit: The American 'Maximum Battleship' Studies of 1916&ndash;17," ''Warship International'' 12, no. 1 (1975), 31&ndash;59.}}

Political opposition in Congress also made it difficult to build the ''Pennsylvania'' class. The United States' [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] refused to fund any new battleships for the fiscal year 1913, though the [[United States Senate|Senate]] would fund two in its comparable bill. They eventually compromised on one, and the battleship that would become ''Pennsylvania'' was authorized on 22 August 1912. The ship's plans were given to prospective builders on 20 December; [[open tender|bids were opened]] on 18 February 1913; and the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder, [[Newport News Shipbuilding|Newport News]], on 27 February 1913 at the quoted price of $7,260,000 without armor or armament.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 116; "Battleship ''Pennsylvania''," ''Naval Engineers'', 519.</ref> The independent bidding process led the navy to claim $750,000 in savings, but the final cost actually came in at $7,800,000 ($15,000,000 with armor and armament).<ref>"Battleship 'Pennsylvania' and Class," ''Scientific American'', 254; "[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C06E5DD173DE633A25756C0A9649D946296D6CF Saves $750,000 on New Battleship]," ''New York Times'', 5 December 1913.</ref>

''Arizona'' was the one approved battleship for the fiscal year 1914. [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[George von Lengerke Meyer]] had requested three battleships for that fiscal year, citing the former policy of building two per year, plus an additional ship to make up for authorizing only ''Pennsylvania'' in the previous year, but congressional compromises once again approved only one new battleship. ''Arizona'' was authorized on 4 March 1913, but to avoid a lengthy delay between the two, the ship was ordered much more quickly (on 24 June) by giving the contract to a navy-owned shipyard.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 116.</ref>

The constructors were not able not meet these goals, though.

''Pennsylvania'' and ''Arizona'' were commissioned during the [[World War I|First World War]], but prior to the [[American entry into World War I|United States' entry]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. During their first year, the ships were cleaned and readied for full active duty.<ref>Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 13<U+2013>17.</ref> ''Pennsylvania'' became the [[flagship]] of the US Atlantic Fleet on 12 October 1916.<ref>"''Pennsylvania''", ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''.</ref> ''Arizona'' first fired its main guns on 23 December, but issues with the propulsion system, specifically a stripped turbine, kept the ship almost exclusively in the New York Navy Yard from December 1916 to March 1917.<ref>Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 18<U+2013>21.</ref> Both ships were based in the United States for the duration of the war, owing to a shortage of fuel oil in the United Kingdom, and only the coal-burning battleships of [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|Battleship Division Nine]] were sent.<ref>Jones, ''Battleship Operations'', 28, 92.</ref> After the [[Armistice with Germany|armistice]], both ''Pennsylvania''-class battleships were sent to the other side of the Atlantic. ''Arizona'' was sent first, leaving on 18 November and arriving in Portsmouth on the 30th. ''Pennsylvania'' escorted the American President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s transport, {{ship|SS|George Washington||2}}, across the Atlantic for the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.<ref>Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 37<U+2013>38; Jones, ''Battleship Operations'', 106.</ref> In 1921 and 1922, during the [[inter-war period]], both ships took part in a mission to Peru and were transferred to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]].<ref>"''Pennsylvania''" and "''Arizona''", ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''.</ref>

''Pennsylvania'' and ''Arizona'' were given extensive modernizations from 1929 through 1931; the expenditure came in the fiscal year 1930.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 191, 197.</ref> As part of the rebuilding, ''Pennsylvania'', which had been designed as a fleet flagship, had its conning tower expanded. Aside from that, ''Pennsylvania'' and ''Arizona'' received similar treatment: the elevation of the main batteries was increased to {{degree|30}}, new fire control systems on [[tripod mast]]s were added, the secondary armament and directors were replaced and overhauled (with the five-inch guns being moved into their own twin mounts), and their bridges were enlarged to hold elevated antiaircraft directors. Armor additions were comparatively minimal beyond [[anti-torpedo bulge]]s, which were standard additions on all major warships in this period: {{convert|1.75|to|2|in|mm}} of armor were added to the second [[deck (ship_|armored deck]], and a [[torpedo bulkhead]] was added to the engine room. The propulsion system of the two ''Pennsylvania''s received perhaps the most attention. The boiler system was entirely replaced with six small-tube boilers and new turbines, the latter partially from the canceled {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1920)|0}} battleship {{USS|Washington|BB-47|2}}. The new machinery allowed the ships to come close to their old design speed of {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h}}, even with the added bulk of bulges: ''Pennsylvania'' made 20.89&nbsp;knots and ''Arizona'' 20.7&nbsp;knots on full-power trials.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 197<U+2013>201.</ref>

After their modernization, both ships participated in the normal activities of the fleet, including [[fleet problem]] exercises, and then joined the entire Pacific Fleet in their new base in [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]], after the beginning of the Second World War in Europe. Two years later, on 7 December 141, the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] sank ''Arizona'' in a tremendous explosion and slightly damaged ''Pennsylvania'', which was in dry dock at the time.<ref>Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 274<U+2013>76; Whitley, ''Battleships'', 262; "''Pennsylvania''" and "''Arizona''", ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''.</ref>

''Pennsylvania'' came back into service more quickly than many of the other battleships present during the attack; it left on 20 December and was under repair in San Francisco until 30 March 1942. For the next several months, ''Pennsylvania'' was stationed on the United States' [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], before being reassigned to Pearl Harbor as the fleet flagship for a short time (August to October). After another refit in San Francisco, which lasted until February 1943, the ship was sent to assist American forces engaged in the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]]. During this time, ''Pennsylvania'' was nearly hit by a torpedo from {{Jsub|I-31}}, which was later sunk.<ref>Whitley, ''Battleships'', 262.</ref>

For the next year, ''Pennsylvania'' was utilized in shore bombardment in the Battles of [[Battle of Makin|Makin]], [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]], [[Battle of Eniwetok|Eniwetok]], and [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], along with the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Palau Islands Campaign]]. The ship also participated in the [[Battle of Leyte|landings on Leyte]] and the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. During this time, ''Pennsylvania'' was present at the last battle ever between battleships, the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#The Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October)|Battle of Surigao Strait]]. The ship did not fire any salvos because the Japanese vessels were turned away or sunk at long range, beyond ''Pennsylvania''{{'}}s outdated fire control but within range of other, radar-directed battleships.<ref>Whitley, ''Battleships'', 262<U+2013>63.</ref>

In 1945, ''Pennsylvania'' was sent for another refit in San Francisco, and the guns in its main battery, worn out from the frequent shore bombardments, were replaced by those from ''Nevada'' and ''Oklahoma''. After its completion in July, the ship bombarded [[Wake Island]] on 1 August en route to Okinawa, where it was struck by an air-dropped torpedo. It hit near the starboard propeller shaft, killing twenty men and knocking out three of the ship's four shafts. The area near the shafts, though, was also a vital area, and the opened seals around the shafts led to large amounts of flooding that nearly sank the battleship. ''Pennsylvania'' was towed to shallower waters, where local repairs were made. The ship's last action was to fire at a ''[[kamikaze]]'' on 13 August, before it was towed to Guam beginning on the 18th, where temporary repairs were effected, before it was sent to Puget Sound for more permanent repairs. ''Pennsylvania'' arrived on 24 October only after a torturous journey, which saw the ship lose all but one of its remaining propeller shafts while taking on water through the temporary patch put over the torpedo hole in Guam.<ref>Whitley, ''Battleships'', 263; Cates, ''War History'', 37<U+2013>38.</ref>

With the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] on 2 September, the Puget Sound repairs were limited to those necessary to ensure ''Pennsylvania''{{'}}s delivery to [[Bikini Atoll]] for [[Bikini atomic experiments|atomic experiments]] in July 1946. The old battleship survived the tests, but was decommissioned on 29 August and used for [[radiation|radiological]] studies before being sunk as a [[target ship]] on 10 February 1948. ''Pennsylvania'' was struck from the [[Navy Vessel Register]] nine days later.<ref>Whitley, ''Battleships'', 263; Cates, ''War History'', 38; "[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/BB38.htm Pennsylvania (BB 38)]," ''[[Naval Vessel Register]]''.</ref>
