[[File:DotNet.svg|thumb|right|250px|The .NET Framework stack.]]
Microsoft started development on the [[.NET Framework]] in the late 1990s originally under the name of Next Generation Windows Services (NGWS). By late 2000 the first beta versions of .NET 1.0 were released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ben.skyiv.com/clrversion.html |title=Framework Versions}}</ref>
<!--probably best not to use wiki links for dates to ensure consistent ISO date format for table readability-->

Version 3.0 of the .NET Framework is included with [[Windows Server 2008]] and [[Windows Vista]]. Version 3.5 is included with [[Windows 7]], and can also be installed on [[Windows XP]] and the [[Windows Server 2003]] family of operating systems.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc160717.aspx | author = [[Microsoft]] | title = Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Administrator Deployment Guide|accessdate = 26 June 2008}}</ref> On April 12, 2010, .NET Framework 4 was released alongside [[Visual Studio 2010]].

The .NET Framework family also includes two versions for [[Mobile computing|mobile]] or [[Embedded system|embedded]] device use. A reduced version of the framework, the [[.NET Compact Framework]], is available on [[Microsoft Windows CE|Windows CE]] platforms, including [[Windows Mobile]] devices such as [[smartphones]]. Additionally, the [[.NET Micro Framework]] is targeted at severely resource-constrained devices.

==.NET Framework 1.0==
[[File:NET v rgb w.png|thumb|The old .NET Framework logo]]
This is the first release of the .NET Framework, released on 13 February 2002 and available for Windows 98, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, and XP. Mainstream support by [[Microsoft]] for this version ended 10 July 2007, and extended support ended 14 July 2009.<ref name="MS_DotNET_EoL">{{Cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search/?sort=PN&alpha=.NET+Framework |title=Microsoft Product Lifecycle Search |work=Microsoft |accessdate=25 January 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jZfjU0F1|archivedate=5 September 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref>

==.NET Framework 1.1==
This is the first major .NET Framework upgrade. It is available on its own as a [[Freely redistributable software|redistributable package]] or in a software development kit, and was published on 3 April 2003. It is also part of the second release of Microsoft [[Visual Studio .NET]] (released as Visual Studio .NET 2003). This is the first version of the .NET Framework to be included as part of the Windows operating system, shipping with [[Windows Server 2003]]. Mainstream support for .NET Framework 1.1 ended on 14 October 2008, and extended support ends on 8 October 2013. Since .NET 1.1 is a component of Windows Server 2003, extended support for .NET 1.1 on Server 2003 will run out with that of the OS <U+2013> currently 14 July 2015. .NET 1.1 is the last available version for [[Windows NT 4.0]].

If .NET Framework 1.0 is removed, installing only .NET Framework 1.1 also provides the system support for version 1.0, except in rare instances where an application will not run because it checks the version number of a library. <ref>{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/Aa497323.aspx}</ref>

===Changes in 1.1 in comparison with 1.0===
*Built-in support for mobile [[ASP.NET]] controls. Previously available as an add-on for .NET Framework, now part of the framework.
*Security changes <U+2013> enable Windows Forms assemblies to execute in a semi-trusted manner from the Internet, and enable [[Code Access Security]] in ASP.NET applications.
*Built-in support for ODBC and Oracle databases. Previously available as an add-on for .NET Framework 1.0, now part of the framework.
*[[.NET Compact Framework]] <U+2013> a version of the .NET Framework for small devices.
*Internet Protocol version 6 ([[IPv6]]) support.
*Numerous API changes.

==.NET Framework 2.0==
Released with [[Microsoft Visual Studio#Visual Studio 2005|Visual Studio 2005]], [[Microsoft SQL Server#SQL Server 2005|Microsoft SQL Server 2005]], and [[BizTalk]] 2006.
*The 2.0 Redistributable Package can be downloaded for free from [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&DisplayLang=en Microsoft], and was published on 22 January 2006.
*The 2.0 Software Development Kit (SDK) can be downloaded for free from [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=fe6f2099-b7b4-4f47-a244-c96d69c35dec&DisplayLang=en Microsoft].
*It is included as part of [[Microsoft Visual Studio#Visual Studio 2005|Visual Studio 2005]] and [[Microsoft SQL Server#SQL Server 2005|Microsoft SQL Server 2005]].
*Version 2.0 without any Service Pack is the last version with support for [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows Me]]. Version 2.0 with Service Pack 2 is the last version with official support for [[Windows 2000]] although there have been some unofficial workarounds published online to use a subset of the functionality from Version 3.5 in Windows 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft don <!-- BOT GENERATED PAGE TITLE -->|url=http://rainstorms.me.uk/blog/2008/03/12/microsoft-net-framework-35-in-windows-2000/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5g9t5nE7k|archivedate=19 April 2009|work=|accessdate=5 March 2009}}</ref> Version 2.0 with Service Pack 2 requires [[Windows 2000]] with SP4 plus KB835732 or KB891861 update, [[Windows XP]] with SP2 or later and [[Windows Installer]] 3.1 (KB893803-v2)

*Full 64-bit support for both the x64 and the IA64 hardware platforms.
*Numerous API changes.
*[[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]] integration <U+2013> .NET 2.0, VS 2005, and SQL Server 2005 are all tied together. This means that instead of using [[Transact-SQL|T-SQL]], one can build [[stored procedures]] and triggers in any of the .NET-compatible languages.
*A new hosting API for native applications wishing to host an instance of the .NET runtime. The new API gives a fine grain control on the behavior of the runtime with regards to multithreading, memory allocation, assembly loading and more ([http://winfx.msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dv_fxunmanref/html/703b8381-43db-4a4d-9faa-cca39302d922.asp detailed reference]). It was initially developed to efficiently host the runtime in [[Microsoft SQL Server]], which implements its own scheduler and memory manager.
*Many additional and improved ASP.NET web controls.
*New data controls with declarative data binding.
*New personalization features for ASP.NET, such as support for themes, skins, master pages and webparts.
*[[.NET Micro Framework]] <U+2013> a version of the .NET Framework related to the [[Smart Personal Objects Technology]] initiative.
*Membership provider
*Partial classes
*Nullable types
*Anonymous methods
*Iterators
*Data tables

==.NET Framework 3.0==
.NET Framework 3.0, formerly called WinFX,<ref>[http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2006/06/09/624300.aspx WinFX name change announcement]</ref> was released on 21 November 2006. It includes a new set of [[managed code]] APIs that are an integral part of [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows Server 2008]] operating systems. It is also available for [[Windows XP]] SP2 and [[Windows Server 2003]] as a download. There are no major architectural changes included with this release; .NET Framework 3.0 uses the [[Common Language Runtime]] of .NET Framework 2.0.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/aa663314.aspx |title=.NET Framework 3.0 Versioning and Deployment Q&A |accessdate=1 June 2008}}</ref> Unlike the previous major .NET releases there was no .NET Compact Framework release made as a counterpart of this version.  Version 3.0 of the .NET Framework shipped with Windows Vista.  It also shipped with Windows Server 2008 as an optional component (disabled by default).

.NET Framework 3.0 consists of four major new components:
*[[Windows Presentation Foundation]] (WPF), formerly code-named Avalon; a new [[user interface]] subsystem and [[Application programming interface|API]] based on [[XML]] and [[vector graphics]], which uses [[3D computer graphics]] hardware and [[Direct3D]] technologies. See [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms754130.aspx WPF SDK] for developer articles and documentation on WPF.
*[[Windows Communication Foundation]] (WCF), formerly code-named Indigo; a service-oriented messaging system which allows programs to interoperate locally or remotely similar to [[web service]]s.
*[[Windows Workflow Foundation]] (WF) allows for building of task automation and integrated transactions using [[workflow]]s.
*[[Windows CardSpace]], formerly code-named InfoCard; a software component which securely stores a person's digital identities and provides a unified interface for choosing the identity for a particular transaction, such as logging in to a website.

==.NET Framework 3.5==
Version 3.5 of the .NET Framework was released on 19 November 2007, but it is not included with [[Windows Server 2008]]. As with .NET Framework 3.0, version 3.5 uses the CLR of version 2.0. In addition, it installs .NET Framework 2.0 SP1, (installs .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 with 3.5 SP1) and .NET Framework 3.0 SP1 (installs .NET Framework 3.0 SP2 with 3.5 SP1), which adds some methods and properties to the BCL classes in version 2.0 which are required for version 3.5 features such as [[Language Integrated Query|Language Integrated Query (LINQ)]]. These changes do not affect applications written for version 2.0, however.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommentView.aspx?guid=7cd75505-192f-4fef-b617-e47e1e2cb94b | title = Catching RedBits differences in .NET 2.0 and .NET 2.0SP1 | accessdate = 1 June 2008}}</ref>

As with previous versions, a new .NET Compact Framework 3.5 was released in tandem with this update in order to provide support for additional features on Windows Mobile and [[Windows Embedded CE]] devices.

The source code of the [[Base Class Library]] in this version has been partially released (for debugging reference only) under the [[Microsoft Reference License#Microsoft Reference Source License (Ms-RSL)|Microsoft Reference Source License]].<ref name="sourcerelease">{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx |title=Releasing the Source Code for the NET Framework |author=[[Scott Guthrie]] |date=3 October 2007 |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref>

===Service Pack 1 {{Anchor|.NET Framework 3.5 SP1}}===
The .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 was released on 11 August 2008. This release adds new functionality and provides performance improvements under certain conditions,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/products/cc533447.aspx | title = Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1 and .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 | accessdate = 7 September 2008}}</ref> especially with WPF where 20-45% improvements are expected. Two new data service components have been added, the [[ADO.NET Entity Framework]] and [[ADO.NET Data Services]]. Two new assemblies for web development, System.Web.Abstraction and System.Web.Routing, have been added; these are used in the [[ASP.NET MVC Framework]] and, reportedly, will be utilized in the future release of ASP.NET Forms applications. Service Pack 1 is included with [[SQL Server 2008]] and [[Microsoft Visual Studio#Visual Studio 2008|Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1]].  It also featured a new set of controls called "Visual Basic Power Packs" which brought back Visual Basic controls such as "Line" and "Shape".  Version 3.5 SP1 of the .NET Framework shipped with Windows 7.  It also shipped with Windows Server 2008 R2 as an optional component (disabled by default).

====.NET Framework 3.5 SP1 Client Profile====
For the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 there is also a new variant of the .NET Framework, called the ".NET Framework Client Profile", which at 28 MB is significantly smaller than the full framework and only installs components that are the most relevant to desktop applications.<ref>{{cite web

===Windows Server AppFabric===
After the release of the .NET Framework 4, Microsoft released a set of enhancements, named [[AppFabric|Windows Server AppFabric]],<ref>http://blogs.iis.net/appfabric/archive/2010/06/07/windows-server-appfabric-now-generally-available.aspx</ref> for [[application server]] capabilities in the form of AppFabric Hosting<ref name="dsource">{{cite web | url = http://www.devsource.com/c/a/Architecture/Dublin-App-Server-coming-toNET-40/ | title = 'Dublin' App Server coming to .NET 4 | work = DevSource | accessdate = 27 April 2009}}</ref><ref name="arule">{{cite web | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/architectsrule/archive/2008/10/01/net-framework-4-0-and-dublin-application-server.aspx | title = .NET Framework 4 and Dublin Application Server | work = [[MSDN]] Blogs | accessdate = 27 April 2009}}</ref> and in-memory distributed caching support.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_(memory_cache)</ref>

==Future versions==
Microsoft has revealed some details about what will come in the next version of the .NET Framework. A central theme is the introduction of a compiler as a service that enables programmers to embed compilers in their applications. One purpose of this would be to provide scripting engines for applications.<ref name="futurecsharp">{{cite web |url=http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL16/ |title= The Future of C#|author= Anders Hejlsberg|date=28 October 2008 |publisher= Microsoft|accessdate=9 August 2010}}</ref>

[[Anders Hejlsberg]], main architect of the C# programming language, has shown a [[REPL]] (read-eval-print loop) built on an early internal version of the API.<ref name="futurecsharp" />
