Chan was born on April 7, 1954, in [[Victoria Peak]], in the former [[Crown colony]] of Hong Kong, as Chan Kong-sang (meaning "born in Hong Kong") to [[Charles and Lee-Lee Chan]], refugees from the [[Chinese Civil War]]. He was nicknamed ''Paopao'' ({{zh|<U+70AE><U+70AE>}}, literally meaning "Cannonball") because the high-energy child was always rolling around.<ref>{{cite web

Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on [[Hong Kong Island]], where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school. In 1960, his father immigrated to [[Canberra]], Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a [[Peking Opera School]] run by Master [[Yu Jim-yuen]].<ref name=Tiscali/><ref name=CelebValues>{{cite web

== Film career ==
=== Early exploits: 1976<U+2013>1979 ===
[[File:Jackie Chan Fist.JPG|thumb|right|Jackie Chan began his film career as a [[stuntman]] in the [[Bruce Lee]] films ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (1972) and ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973, pictured).]]
In 1976, Jackie Chan received a telegram from Willie Chan, a film producer in the Hong Kong film industry who had been impressed with Jackie's stuntwork.  Willie Chan offered him an acting role in a film directed by [[Lo Wei]]. Lo had seen Chan's performance in the [[John Woo]] film ''[[Hand of Death]]'' (1976) and planned to model him after [[Bruce Lee]] with the film ''[[New Fist of Fury]]''.<ref name=Whoami /> His stage name was changed to Sing Lung ({{zh|<U+6210><U+9F8D>}}, also transcribed as Cheng Long,<ref>[http://kungfu.chinaa2z.com/kungfu/html/Kung%20Fu%20Star/2008/20081225/20081225165205590921/20081225172231339876.html Jackie Chan (Cheng Long): Chinese Kung Fu Superstar].</ref> literally "become the dragon") to emphasise his similarity to Bruce Lee, whose stage name was Lei Siu-lung ({{zh|<U+674E><U+5C0F><U+9F8D>}}, meaning "Little Dragon"). The film was unsuccessful because Chan was not accustomed to Lee's martial arts style. Despite the film's failure, Lo Wei continued producing films with similar themes, resulting in little improvement at the box office.<ref name="FightingMaster">{{cite web

Upon Chan's return to Lo Wei's studio, Lo tried to replicate the comedic approach of ''Drunken Master'', producing ''[[Half a Loaf of Kung Fu]]'' and ''[[Spiritual Kung Fu]]''.<ref name="Iamjc" /> He also gave Chan the opportunity to co-direct ''[[The Fearless Hyena]]'' with [[Kenneth Tsang]]. When Willie Chan left the company, he advised Jackie to decide for himself whether or not to stay with Lo Wei. During the shooting of ''[[Fearless Hyena Part II]]'', Chan broke his contract and joined [[Golden Harvest]], prompting Lo to blackmail Chan with [[Triad (underground society)|triads]], blaming Willie for his star's departure. The dispute was resolved with the help of fellow actor and director [[Jimmy Wang Yu]], allowing Chan to stay with Golden Harvest.<ref name="Jcm">{{cite web

=== Success of the action comedy genre: 1980<U+2013>1987 ===
[[File:Jcpmall.JPG|thumb|left|The film ''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'', nicknamed "Glass Story" for its stunt work, is set in a modern period.]]
[[Willie Chan]] had become Jackie's personal manager and firm friend, and has remained so for over 30 years. He was instrumental in launching Chan's international career, beginning with his first forays into the [[American film industry]] in the 1980s. His first Hollywood film was ''[[Battle Creek Brawl]]'' in 1980. Chan then played a minor role in the 1981 film ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'', which grossed [[United States dollar|US$]]100 million worldwide. Despite being largely ignored by audiences in favour of established American actors like [[Burt Reynolds]], Chan was impressed by the [[outtakes]] shown at the [[closing credits]], inspiring him to include the same device in his future films.

After the commercial failure of ''[[The Protector (1985 film)|The Protector]]'' in 1985, Chan temporarily abandoned his attempts to break into the US market, returning his focus to [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong films]].<ref name=FightingMaster/>

Back in Hong Kong, Chan's films began to reach a larger audience in [[East Asia]], with early successes in the lucrative Japanese market including ''[[The Young Master]]'' (1980) and ''[[Dragon Lord]]'' (1982). ''[[The Young Master]]'' went on to beat previous box office records set by [[Bruce Lee]] and established Chan as Hong Kong cinema's top star.

Chan produced a number of action comedy films with his opera school friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. The three co-starred together for the first time in 1983 in ''[[Project A]]'', which won the Best Action Design Award at the third annual [[Hong Kong Film Awards]].<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Rumble In The Bronx.jpg|thumb|right|Chan in his [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] breakthrough film ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]].'']]
In 1988 Chan starred alongside Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao for the last time to date, in the film ''[[Dragons Forever]]''. Hung co-directed with [[Corey Yuen]], and the villain in the film was played by [[Yuen Wah]], both of whom were fellow graduates of the China Drama Academy.

In the late 1980s and early 90s, Chan starred in a number of successful sequels beginning with ''[[Police Story 2]]'', which won the award for Best Action Choreography at the 1989 [[Hong Kong Film Awards]]. This was followed by ''[[Armour of God II: Operation Condor]]'', and ''[[Police Story 3: Super Cop]]'', for which Chan won the Best Actor Award at the 1993 [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards|Golden Horse Film Festival]].

=== New experiments and change in style: 2008<U+2013>present ===
As Chan had stated years before, there would be a point in his life in which he would have to be modernized and use special effects, and try new different things than martial arts flicks. This began in 2007, with the filming of ''[[The Forbidden Kingdom]]'' (released in 2008), Chan's first onscreen collaboration with fellow Chinese actor [[Jet Li]], which was completed on 24 August 2007 and the film was released in April 2008. The film featured heavy use of effects and wires.<ref>{{cite web

In ''[[Little Big Soldier]]'', Chan stars, alongside [[Leehom Wang]] in a non-martial arts comedy movie based on the [[Warring States Period]].

On June 22, 2009, Chan left [[Los Angeles]] to begin filming ''[[The Karate Kid (2010 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', a remake of [[The Karate Kid|the 1984 original]], in [[Beijing]].<ref>Brian Warmoth, [http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/05/06/karate-kid-remake-keeping-title-taking-jaden-smith-to-china/ <U+2018>Karate Kid<U+2019> Remake Keeping Title, Taking Jaden Smith to China], ''MTV Movie Blog'', May 6, 2009.</ref> The film was released in America on June 11, 2010 and sees Chan's first dramatic American film. In the film, he plays Mr. Han, a kung fu master and maintenance man who teaches [[Jaden Smith]]'s character, Dre, kung-fu so he can defend himself from school bullies. In Chan's next movie, ''[[The New Shaolin Temple]]'', instead of playing one of the major characters, he plays the cook of the temple.

He has stated in interviews that the primary inspiration for his more comedic stunts were films such as ''[[The General (1927 film)|The General]]'' directed by and starring [[Buster Keaton]], who was also known to perform his own stunts. Since its establishment in 1983, Chan has used the team in all his subsequent films to make choreographing easier, given his understanding of each member's abilities.<ref>{{cite video

Chan has been injured numerous times attempting stunts; many of them have been shown as outtakes or as [[blooper]]s during the closing credits of his films. He came closest to death filming ''[[Armour of God (film)|Armour of God]]'', when he fell from a tree and fractured his skull.

== Filmography and screen persona ==
{{See|Jackie Chan filmography}}
[[File:Jackie Chan Cannes.jpg|thumb|Jackie Chan at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
Jackie Chan created his screen persona as a response to Bruce Lee, and the [[Bruceploitation|numerous imitators]] who appeared before and after Lee's death. In contrast to Lee's characters, who were typically stern, morally upright heroes, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular guys (often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends or families) who always triumph in the end despite the odds.<ref name=Iamjc /> Additionally, Chan has stated that he deliberately styles his movement to be the ''opposite'' of Lee's: where Lee held his arms wide, Chan holds his tight to the body; where Lee was loose and flowing, Chan is tight and choppy.  Despite the success of the ''Rush Hour'' series, Chan has stated that he is not a fan of it since he neither appreciates the action scenes in the movie, nor understands American humour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,298648,00.html|title=Jackie Chan Admits He Is Not a Fan of 'Rush Hour' Films|date=30 September 2007|accessdate=1 October 2007 | work=Fox News}}</ref>

"Disciple of the Dragon") concluded. The series was produced by, and featured Jackie Chan. The aim of the program was to find a new star, skilled in acting and martial arts, to become Chan's "successor" and student in filmmaking. Contestants were trained by Jackie Chan Stunt Team members Alan Wu and He Jun and competed in various fields, including explosion scenes, high-altitude wire-suspension, gunplay, car stunts, diving, obstacles courses etc.
The regular judges on the program were [[He Ping]], [[Wu Yue]] and [[Cheng Pei Pei]]. Guest judges include [[Stanley Tong]], [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]]. The "Finals" began on 5 April 2008, with 16 contestants remaining, and concluded on 26 June 2008. Amongst those in attendance were [[Tsui Hark]], [[John Woo]], [[Ng See Yuen]] and [[Yu Rongguang]].

The winner of the series was Jack Tu (Tu Sheng Cheng). Along with runners up Yang Zheng and Jerry Liau, Tu is now set to star in three modern Chinese action films, one of which was scripted by Chan, and all three will be co-produced by Chan and his company [[JCE Movies Limited]]. The films will be entitled ''Speedpost 206'', ''Won't Tell You'' and ''Tropical Tornado'' and will be directed by [[Xie Dong]], [[Jiang Tao]] and [[Cai Rong Hui]]. All 16 finalists will be given the opportunity to work on the films, or to join the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]]. Production on the first film is due to begin in September 2008.

Chan has always wanted to be a role model to children, remaining popular with them due to his good-natured acting style. He has refused to play villains and has ''almost'' never used the word "[[fuck]]" in his films (He's only said that word in two films, ''The Protector'' and ''Burn, Hollywood, Burn''), but in ''[[Rush Hour (film)|Rush Hour]]'', in an attempt to be "cool" and imitate his partner Carter, who said "What's up, my nigga?" to a club of black men, he said the same thing when Carter was in another room and they all attacked him, so he had to pull out his fighting skills to beat them down and escape.<ref>{{cite news

== Controversies ==
During a news conference in Shanghai on 28 March 2004, Chan referred to the recently concluded [[Republic of China presidential election, 2004]] in [[Taiwan]], in which [[Democratic Progressive Party]] candidates [[Chen Shui-bian]] and [[Annette Lu]] were re-elected as President and Vice-President as "the biggest joke in the world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-03/29/content_318903.htm|title=Taiwan election biggest joke in the world <U+2013> China Daily}}</ref> Chan's comments were criticized by Parris Chang, a Taiwanese legislator and senior member of the DPP, who called for the government of Taiwan to take punitive steps against Chan for his comments, such as banning his movies and barring him the right to visit Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-04/22/content_325482.htm|title=Taiwan lawmaker calls for Jackie Chan movie ban|publisher=China Daily|date=22 April 2004}}</ref> Some 50 police and security personnel were required to separate protesters from Chan, as they were attempting to spit at him when he arrived at Taipei airport for a charity sponsored by cable TV channel [[TVBS]] on 18 June 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/news/article_1411923.php/Protestors_blast_Jackie_Chan_for_criticizing_Taiwan_elections|title=Protestors blast Jackie Chan for criticizing Taiwan elections <U+2013> People News}}</ref> Chan insisted that his remarks were not intended to insult the people of Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/19/2279237.htm|title=Protesters greet Jackie Chan in Taiwan <U+2013> ABC News (Australia)}}</ref>

Referring to his participation in the [[2008 Olympic Torch Relay|torch relay]] for the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing]], Chan spoke out against demonstrators who disrupted the relay several times attempting to draw attention to a wide-ranging number of grievances against the Chinese government, including [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|China's human rights record]] and the [[political status of Taiwan]]. He warned that he would lash out against anyone planning to stop him from carrying the Olympic Torch, saying, "Demonstrators better not get anywhere near me." In addition Chan felt that the protesters were publicity seekers. 'They are doing it for no reason. They just want to show off on the TV,' he said. 'They know, "if I can get the torch, I can go on the TV for the world news".'  Chan felt the country was trying to improve and the Olympics is a chance for the country to open up and learn from the outside world and vice versa. "We are not right about everything. Things are getting better in China but we can change and are changing. We want to learn from the rest of the world as well as teach others about our ways and our culture." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/oddballs/143026-kung-fu-star-jackie-chan-to-chop-down-olympic-protestors|title=Kung-fu star Jackie Chan to chop down Olympic protesters|publisher=METRO.co.uk|date=15 April 2008}}</ref>

On 18 April 2009, during a panel discussion at the annual [[Boao Forum for Asia]] titled "Tapping into Asia's Creative Industry Potential," Chan said "...in the 10 years after Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, I can gradually see, I'm not sure if it's good to have freedom or not."<ref name='boao1'>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090421/ap_en_ot/as_hong_kong_people_jackie_chan|title=Spokesman: Jackie Chan comments out of context <U+2013> Yahoo!

He also added, "I'm gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled. If we're not being controlled, we'll just do what we want."  Chan however complained about the [[2007 Chinese export recalls|quality of Chinese goods]], saying, "...a Chinese TV might explode."<ref name='boao2'>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090418/ap_en_ot/as_china_people_jackie_chan|title=Jackie Chan: Chinese people need to be controlled <U+2013> Yahoo!

On 24 August 2010, Jackie Chan tweeted about the botched rescue operation on the [[Manila hostage crisis]] that left 8 Hong Kong tourists dead. Although saddened by the news, he also tweeted "If they killed the guy sooner, they will say why not negotiate first? If they negotiate first, they ask why not kill the guy sooner?" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitter.com/EyeOfJackieChan/status/22054099041|title=1st Tweet on Hostage Crisis, EyeOfJackieChan, Jackie Chan's Twitter Page|date=24 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitter.com/EyeOfJackieChan/status/22054128619|title=2nd Tweet on Hostage Crisis, EyeOfJackieChan, Jackie Chan's Twitter Page|date=24 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitter.com/EyeOfJackieChan/status/22054214000|title=3rd Tweet on Hostage Crisis, EyeOfJackieChan, Jackie Chan's Twitter Page|date=24 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitter.com/EyeOfJackieChan/status/22058470325|title=4th Tweet on Hostage Crisis, EyeOfJackieChan, Jackie Chan's Twitter Page|date=24 August 2010}}</ref> Chan's comments caused outrage in Hong Kong. Several anti-Jackie Chan groups were set up on Facebook with tens of thousands of supporters. Some fellow actors and directors told local newspapers that they were also upset by his remarks. Chan reportedly has business interests in the Philippines. He issued a statement on 27 August 2010 apologizing for his comments and claiming that his assistant who helped him post the tweets had misunderstood the meaning of his original message.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jackiechan.com/scrapbook/1061068--Statement-of-Aplogy-from-Jackie-Chan|title=Statement of Apology from Jackie Chan|publisher=The JC Group|date=27 August 2010}}</ref>
