The emirate of Dubai is located on the southeast coast of the [[Persian Gulf]] and is one of the seven emirates that make up the country.

The earliest mention of Dubai is in 1095 AD, and the earliest recorded settlement in the region dates from 1799. Dubai was formally established on the 9th June 1833 by Sheikh Maktoum bin Butti Al-Maktoum when he persuaded around 800 members of his tribe of the [[Bani Yas]], living in what was then the [[Second Saudi State]] to follow him to the [[Dubai Creek]] by the Abu Falasa clan of the Bani Yas. It remained under the tribe's control when the United Kingdom agreed to protect the Sheikhdom in 1892<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/8575461/Give-me-a-break-stop-knocking-Dubai.html |title=Give me a break: stop knocking Dubai |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 June 2011 |accessdate=12 August 2011 |location=London}}</ref> and joined the nascent United Arab Emirates upon independence in 1971 as the country's second emirate. Its strategic geographic location made the town an important trading hub and by the beginning of the 20th century, Dubai was already an important regional port.

Today, Dubai has emerged as a [[Demographics of Dubai|cosmopolitan]] metropolis that has grown steadily to become a [[global city]] and a business and cultural hub of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2008/10/15/the_2008_global_cities_index?page=0,0|title=The 2008 Global Cities Index|date=15 October 2008|work=Foreign Policy|accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref> It is also a major transport hub for passengers and cargo. Although [[Economy of Dubai|Dubai's economy]] was historically built on the [[oil industry]], the emirate's Western-style model of business drives its economy with the main revenues now coming from [[Tourism in Dubai|tourism]], aviation, real estate, and financial services.<ref name=oilrev>[http://www.ameinfo.com/122863.html Oil share dips in Dubai GDP] ''[[AMEInfo]]'' (9 June 2007) Retrieved on 15 October 2007.</ref><ref name="ArBusEcon">[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7297:dubai-economy-set-to-treble-by-2015&Itemid=1 Dubai economy set to treble by 2015]{{dead link|date=October 2010}} ''ArabianBusiness.com'' (3 February 2007) Retrieved on 15 October 2007.</ref><ref name="Ddooo">{{cite web|title=Dubai diversifies out of oil |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/66981.html |publisher=[[AMEInfo]] |date=7 September 2005 |accessdate=12 August 2008}}</ref> Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects and sports events.

==Etymology==
In the 1820s, Dubai was referred to as ''Al Wasl'' by British historians. Few records pertaining to the cultural history of the UAE or its constituent [[Emirates of the United Arab Emirates|emirates]] exist and because of the region's oral traditions, folklore and myth were not written down. According to Fedel Handhal, a researcher in the history and culture of the UAE, the word ''Dubai'' may have come from the word ''Daba'' (a derivative of ''Yadub'', which means ''to creep''); referring to the slow flow of [[Dubai Creek]] inland. The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word, but to its alternative of ''[[locust]]''.<ref name=etymology2>[http://www.uaeinteract.com/docs/How_did_Dubai,_Abu_Dhabi_and_other_cities_get_their_names?_Experts_reveal_all/24335.htm How did Dubai, Abu Dhabi and other cities get their names?

==History==
{{Main|History of Dubai}}
Although stone tools have been found at many sites, little is known about the UAE's early inhabitants as only a few settlements have been found.<ref name=hist_trad/> Many ancient towns in the area were trading centers between the Eastern and Western worlds. The remnants of an ancient [[mangrove swamp]], dated at 7,000&nbsp;BC, were discovered during the construction of sewer lines near [[Dubai Internet City]]. The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland, becoming a part of the city's present coastline.<ref name=hist_trad>{{cite web|url=http://uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf_2006/English_2006/eyb4.pdf |title=History and Traditions of the UAE |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Al Bastakiya-Dubai8878.JPG|thumb|left|[[Al Bastakiya]], Dubai]]
The earliest recorded mention of Dubai is in 1095, in the "Book of Geography" by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]]-Arab [[geographer]] [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri]]. The [[Venice|Venetian]] pearl merchant Gaspero Balbi visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai (''Dibei'') for its [[pearl hunting|pearling]] industry.<ref name=balbi/> <!--comment out "connection has time out" referenced info Documented records of the ''town'' of Dubai exist only after 1799.<ref name=dubaienv>[http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:KcJGC0pgYMIJ:webhost.bridgew.edu/dleuenberger/student/Sustainability-Dubai%26Hawaii.pdf&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=42&gl=us Economic and Environmental Impacts of tourism on Dubai and Hawaii]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}. McEachern, Nadeau, et al.</ref>--> Since 1799, there has been a settlement known as Dubai town.<ref name=britannica/> In the early 19th century, the Al Abu Falasa clan ([[House of Al-Falasi]]) of [[Bani Yas]] clan established Dubai, which remained an important dependent of Abu Dhabi until 1833.<ref name=loc>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/UAE.pdf |title=United Arab Emirates |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2009}}</ref> On 8 January 1820, the [[sheikh]] of Dubai and other sheikhs in the region signed the "General Maritime Peace Treaty" with the British government.<ref name=hist_trad/> In 1833, following tribal feuding, the Al Maktoum dynasty (also descendants of the House of Al-Falasi) of the Bani Yas tribe left their ancestral home of the [[Liwa Oasis]], South-west of the settlement of [[Abu Dhabi]] and quickly took over Dubai from the Abu Fasala clan without resistance.<ref name=loc/>

Dubai came under the protection of the United Kingdom by the "Exclusive Agreement" of 1892, in which the UK agreed to protect Dubai against the developing interests of France, Germany, and Russia in the Persian Gulf.<ref name=loc/> Two catastrophes struck the town during the 1800s. First, in 1841, a [[smallpox]] epidemic broke out in the [[Bur Dubai]] locality, forcing residents to relocate east to [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]]. Then, in 1894, fire swept through Deira, burning down most homes.<ref name=hist_karim>{{cite web|url=http://www.alshindagah.com/september99/architecture.htm |title=Modernity and tradition in Dubai architecture. Karim, Luiza |publisher=Alshindagah.com |accessdate=31 July 2009}}</ref> However, the town's geographical location continued to attract traders and merchants from around the region. The emir of Dubai was keen to attract foreign traders and lowered trade tax brackets, which lured traders away from [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]] and [[Bandar Lengeh]], the region's main trade hubs at the time. Persian merchants naturally looked across to the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf finally making their homes in Dubai. They continued to trade with Lingah, however, as do many of the dhows in Dubai Creek today, and they named their district Bastakiya, after the Bastak region in southern Persia.<ref name=hist_karim/><ref name=asianaffairs>Davidson, Christopher, ''The Emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai: Contrasting Roles in the International System''. March 2007.</ref>

Dubai's geographical proximity to Iran made it an important trade location. The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen, chiefly those from Iran, many of whom eventually settled in the town. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was an important port.<ref name=britannica/> Dubai was known for its pearl exports until the 1930s; the pearl trade was damaged irreparably by World War I, and later on by the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s. With the collapse of the pearling industry, Dubai fell into a deep depression and many residents starved or migrated to other parts of the Persian Gulf.<ref name=hist_trad/>

In the early days since its inception, Dubai was constantly at odds with [[Abu Dhabi]]. In 1947, a border dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on the northern sector of their mutual border, escalated into war.<ref name=dxbadconflict>{{cite web|url=http://www.archiveeditions.co.uk/titledetails.asp?tid=120 |title=The UAE: Internal Boundaries And The Boundary With Oman.

This led the emirate to grant concessions to international oil companies, thus igniting a massive influx of foreign workers, mainly Indians and Pakistanis. Between 1968 and 1975 the city's population grew by over 300%.<ref name=pop7>{{cite web|url=http://www.ite.org/traffic/documents/AB00H5001.pdf |title=Historic population statistics |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2009}}</ref>

On 2 December 1971 Dubai, together with Abu Dhabi and five other emirates, formed the [[United Arab Emirates]] after the former protector, Britain, left the [[Persian Gulf]] in 1971.<ref name=nyt1971>"Six Persian Gulf Emirates Agree to a Federation".

In 1973, the monetary union with Qatar was dissolved and the [[UAE Dirham]] was introduced throughout the Emirates.

During the 1970s, Dubai continued to grow from revenues generated from oil and trade, even as the city saw an influx of immigrants fleeing the [[Lebanese civil war]].<ref name=nyt2>"Beirut Showing Signs of Recovery From Wounds of War".

The [[Gulf War]] of 1990 had a negative financial effect on the city, as depositors withdrew their money and traders withdrew their trade, but subsequently the city recovered in a changing political climate and thrived. Later in the 1990s, many foreign trading communities<U+2014>first from [[Kuwait]], during the Gulf War, and later from [[Bahrain]], during the [[Shia]] unrest<U+2014>moved their businesses to Dubai.<ref name="asianaffairs"/> Dubai provided refueling bases to [[allied forces]] at the Jebel Ali Free Zone during the Gulf War, and again during the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. Large increases in oil prices after the Gulf War encouraged Dubai to continue to focus on free trade and tourism.

Dubai is situated on the [[Persian Gulf]] coast of the United Arab Emirates and is roughly at sea level ({{convert|16|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} above). The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south, [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]] in the northeast, and the [[Sultanate of Oman]] in the southeast. [[Hatta, United Arab Emirates|Hatta]], a minor [[exclave]] of the emirate, is surrounded on three sides by Oman and by the emirates of [[Ajman]] (in the west) and [[Ras Al Khaimah]] (in the north). The Persian Gulf borders the western coast of the emirate. Dubai is positioned at {{Coord|25.2697|N|55.3095|E|}} and covers an area of {{convert|1588|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, which represents a significant expansion beyond its initial {{convert|1500|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} designation due to [[Land reclamation#Land amounts added|land reclamation from the sea]].

Dubai lies directly within the [[Arabian Desert]]. However, the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai's landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns, while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country.<ref name=geo1>[http://uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/14.pdf Environmental Development and Protection in the UAE]. Aspinall, Simon</ref> The sand consists mostly of crushed shell and coral and is fine, clean and white. East of the city, the salt-crusted coastal plains, known as ''sabkha'', give way to a north-south running line of dunes. Farther east, the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with iron oxide.<ref name=pop7/>

The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western [[Hajar Mountains]], which run alongside Dubai's border with Oman at Hatta. The Western Hajar chain has an arid, jagged and shattered landscape, whose mountains rise to about {{convert|1300|m|0|abbr=off}} in some places. Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases; however, Dubai does have a natural inlet, [[Dubai Creek]], which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through. Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains. A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai, and eventually leads into the desert known as [[The Empty Quarter]]. [[Seismic]]ally, Dubai is in a very stable zone<U+2014>the nearest seismic fault line, the ''Zagros Fault'', is {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=off}} from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai.<ref name=seismic>[http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/science/a-straight-line-to-disaster Far enough from the fault lines.] The National, 23 April 2008</ref> Experts also predict that the possibility of a [[tsunami]] in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami.<ref name=seismic/>

The sandy desert surrounding the city supports wild grasses and occasional date palms. Desert hyacinths grow in the ''sabkha'' plains east of the city, while acacia and [[prosopis cineraria|ghaf]] trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains. Several indigenous trees such as the date palm and [[neem]] as well as imported trees like the [[eucalypts]] grow in Dubai's natural parks. The [[houbara bustard]], [[striped hyena]], [[caracal]], [[Fennec Fox|desert fox]], falcon and [[Arabian oryx]] are common in Dubai's desert. Dubai is on the migration path between Europe, Asia and Africa, and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn. The waters of Dubai are home to more than 300 species of fish, including the [[hammour]]. The typical marine life off the Dubai coast includes tropical Fish, jellyfish, coral, [[dugong]], dolphins, whales and sharks. Various types of turtles can also be found in the area including the [[Hawksbill|Hawksbill turtle]] and [[Green Turtle]] which are listed as endangered species.<ref>[http://www.gowealthy.com/gowealthy/wcms/en/home/articles/entertainment/events-and-festivals/Flora-fauna-of-Dubai-B0odU6b3Lu.html Flora and fauna of Dubai] gowealthy.com</ref><ref>[http://www.uaeinteract.com/nature/default.asp Natural UAE] UAE Interact Retrieved 29 April 2010</ref>

[[Dubai Creek]] runs northeast-southwest through the city. The eastern section of the city forms the locality of [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] and is flanked by the emirate of [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]] in the east and the town of [[Al Aweer]] in the south. The [[Dubai International Airport]] is located south of Deira, while the [[Palm Deira#The Palm, Deira|Palm Deira]] is located north of Deira in the [[Persian Gulf]]. Much of Dubai's real-estate boom is concentrated to the west of the Dubai Creek, on the [[Jumeirah]] coastal belt. [[Port Rashid]], [[Jebel Ali]], [[Burj Al Arab]], the [[Palm Jumeirah]] and theme-based free-zone clusters such as [[Business Bay]] are all located in this section.

[[File:New Ferrari police car in Dubai.jpg|thumb|New Ferrari police car in Dubai]]
Dubai has been ruled by the [[Al Maktoum]] family since 1833. The current ruler, His Highness Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], is also the Vice President and Prime Minister of the [[United Arab Emirates]] and member of the Supreme Council of the Union (SCU). Dubai appoints eight members in two-term periods to the [[Federal National Council]] (FNC) of the UAE, the supreme federal legislative body.<ref name=uaegovt>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/persian-gulf-states/90.htm|title=Executive and Legislative Branches|publisher=US Library of Congress|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>

The [[Dubai Municipality]] (DM) was established by the then ruler of Dubai, [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]] in 1954 for purposes of city planning, citizen services and upkeep of local facilities.<ref name=dmhistory>[http://login.dm.gov.ae/wps/wcm/connect/e75de38048826210a159a925592b70e0/orgEnglish.gif?MOD=AJPERES Organizational Chart]. Dubai Municipality</ref> DM is chaired by [[Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], deputy ruler of Dubai and comprises several departments such as the Roads Department, Planning and Survey Department, Environment and Public Health Department and Financial Affairs Department. In 2001, Dubai Municipality embarked on an [[e-Government]] project with the intention of providing 40 of its city services through its web portal, [http://dubai.ae/ dubai.ae]. Thirteen such services were launched by October 2001, while several other services were expected to be operational in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dm.gov.ae/wps/portal/switch_en?TARGET=en&WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/dmegov/dm+internet+en/home-en/announcements-en/announcement080224-02 |title=Dubai Municipality's e-government initiative |format=PPT |date=2 December 2005 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref> Dubai Municipality is also in charge of the city's sanitation and sewage infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wheeler |first=Julia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7663883.stm |title=Raw sewage threat to booming Dubai |publisher=BBC News |date=13 October 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2009}}</ref>

The [[Dubai Police Force]], founded in 1956 in the locality of [[Naif]], has law enforcement jurisdiction over the emirate; the force is under direct command of Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai.

Dubai and [[Ras al Khaimah]] are the only emirates that do not conform to the federal judicial system of the United Arab Emirates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulf-law.com/uaecolaw_legalsystem.html|title=Background on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Legal System|publisher=Gulf-Law.com|accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> The emirate's judicial courts comprise the Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Cassation. The first Court of First Instance consists of the Civil court, which hears all civil claims; the Criminal Court, which hears claims originating from police complaints; and [[Sharia law|Sharia Court]], which is responsible for matters between Muslims. Non-Muslims do not appear before the Sharia Court. The Court of Cassation is the supreme court of the emirate and hears disputes on matters of law only.<ref name="judicial">{{cite web|url=http://dubai.usconsulate.gov/dubai/the_uae_court_system.html|title=Dubai <U+2013> UAE Consulate of the United States|publisher=Consulate of the United States|accessdate=23 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>

Historically, Dubai and its twin across the Dubai creek, Deira (independent of Dubai City at that time), were important ports of call for Western manufacturers. Most of the new city's banking and financial centres were headquartered in the port area. Dubai maintained its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s.

The government's decision to diversify from a trade-based, oil-reliant economy to one that is service and tourism-oriented made [[real estate|property]] more valuable, resulting in the property appreciation from 2004 to 2006.

Dubai is also known for the traditional [[souk]] districts located on either side of the creek. Traditionally, [[dhow]]s from East Asia, China, Sri Lanka, and India would discharge their cargo and the goods would be bargained over in the souks adjacent to the docks.

The delegation from the Bureau International des Expositions who visited Dubai in February 2013 to examine the Emirate<U+2019>s readiness for the largest exposition, was impressed by the infrastructure, and the level of national support.

===Architecture===
{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Dubai|Developments in Dubai}}
[[File:Burj Khalifa building.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Burj Khalifa]] is currently the tallest man-made structure in the world.]]

Dubai has a rich collection of buildings and structures of various [[architectural styles]]. Many modern interpretations of [[Islamic architecture]] can be found here, due to a boom in construction and architectural innovation in the Arab World in general, and in Dubai in particular, supported not only by top Arab or international architectural and engineering design firms such as [[Al Hashemi]] and [[Aedas]], but also by top firms of New York and Chicago.<ref>Karim, Luiza [http://www.alshindagah.com/september99/architecture.htm Modernity and tradition in Dubai architecture]. AlShindagah, 1999</ref> As a result of this boom, modern Islamic <U+2013> and world <U+2013> architecture has literally been taken to new levels in skyscraper building design and technology. Dubai now boasts more completed or topped-out skyscrapers higher than 2/3&nbsp;km, 1/3&nbsp;km, or 1/4&nbsp;km [[List of cities with most skyscrapers|than any other city]]. A culmination point was reached in 2010 with the completion of the [[Burj Khalifa]] (Khalifa Tower), now by far the world's tallest building at 829.8 m (2,722&nbsp;ft). The Burj Khalifa's design is derived from the patterning systems embodied in Islamic architecture, with the triple-lobed footprint of the building based on an abstracted version of the desert flower [[hymenocallis]] which is native to the Dubai region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burjkhalifa.ae/language/en-us/the-tower/design.aspx |title=Design of Burj Khalifa |publisher=Burjkhalifa.ae |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref> The completion of the Khalifa Tower, following the construction boom that began in the 1980s, accelerated in the 1990s, and took on a rapid pace of construction unparalled in modern human history during the decade of the 2000s, leaves Dubai with the world's tallest skyline as of 4 January 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=World's Ten Tallest Cities  In 2012, the JW Marriott Marquis Dubai opened and is the World's tallest hotel, standing at 72 stories (1,165&nbsp;ft).

====Burj al Arab====
{{See also|Hotels in Dubai}}
The [[Burj Al Arab]] (Arabic: '''<U+0628><U+0631><U+062C> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0639><U+0631><U+0628>''', ''Tower of the Arabs'') is a [[hotel rating|5 star]] [[luxury resort|luxury]] [[hotel]]. Although the hotel is frequently described as "the world's only seven-Star hotel", the hotel management claims to never have done that themselves. The Burj al Arab's management company, Jumeira Group, describes the hotel as simply a "five-star deluxe" property. A Jumeirah Group spokesperson is quoted as saying: "There's not a lot we can do to stop it. We're not encouraging the use of the term. We've never used it in our advertising."<ref name="The National">{{cite news|title=Hotel star ratings standards long overdue|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/travel-tourism/hotel-star-ratings-standards-long-overdue|accessdate=10 December 2010|newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |date=2009-07-14}}</ref>

The Burj Al Arab is located on an artificial island 280 metres (919&nbsp;ft) from Jumeirah beach on the Dubai shoreline and is connected to the mainland by a private curving bridge. It is managed by the Jumeirah Group and built by Said Khalil. Construction started in 1994 and completed in 1999. The design, by Tom Wright of WS Atkins PLC, is designed to symbolize Dubai's urban transformation and to mimic the sail of a traditional Arab [[dhow]]. The hotel cost $650 million to build. At 321 metres (1,053&nbsp;ft) and 60 floors, it was the world's tallest building used exclusively as a hotel until the completion of the [[Rose Tower|Rose Rayhaan by Rotana]] in 23 December 2009, also in Dubai. [[File:Burj Al Arab Dubai.jpg|thumb|left|Burj al Arab]]

The design features a steel exoskeleton wrapped around a reinforced concrete tower. Two wings spread in a V shape to form a vast mast, while the space between them is enclosed in a massive atrium by a teflon-coated fibreglass sail. During the day, the white fabric allows a soft, milky light inside the hotel, whereas a clear, glass front would produce blinding amounts of glare and a constantly increasing temperature. At night, both inside and outside, the fabric is lit by colour changing lights. Near the top of the building is a suspended helipad supported by a cantilever which has featured some of the hotel's notable publicity events.

The hotel's interior was designed by Kunan Chew. It features the world's tallest atrium lobby at 180 metres. The atrium lobby is formed by the building's V-shaped span, dominates the interior of the hotel, and takes up over 1/3 of the interior space. Despite its size, the Burj Al Arab holds only 28 double-story floors, accommodating 202 bedroom suites. It is one of the most expensive hotels in the world. The cost of staying at a suite begins at $1,000 per night. The Royal Suite is the most expensive, at $28,000 per night.

One of its restaurants, Al Muntaha, is located 200 metres above the Persian Gulf, offering a view of Dubai. It is supported by a full cantilever that extends 27 metres from either side of the mast, and is accessed by a panoramic elevator. Another restaurant, the Al Mahara, which is accessed by a simulated submarine voyage, features a large seawater aquarium, holding roughly {{convert|35000|cuft|m3}} of water. The tank, made of acrylic glass in order to withstand the water pressure, is about 18 centimetres thick.

===Sanitation issues===
{{Main|Sanitation in Dubai}}

Currently, sewage is piped to one of Dubai's two main sewage treatment plants at Jebel Ali and Al-Awir. In 2009, Dubai's rapid growth and the failure to increase sewerage infrastructure commensurately meant that it briefly stretched its sewage treatment infrastructure beyond its limits. Sewage tankers were drafted in to supplement the piped sewage network and, because of the long queues and delays, some tanker drivers resorted to illegally dumping the effluent into storm drains or behind dunes in the desert. Sewage dumped into storm drains flowed directly into the Persian Gulf, near the city's prime swimming beaches. Doctors at the time warned that tourists using the beaches ran the risk of contracting serious illnesses like typhoid and hepatitis.<ref>Haslam, Chris (23 November 2008) [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/news/article5207225.ece Poo-bai: floods of sewage threaten Dubai beaches, ''The Sunday Times'']</ref> Dubai municipality says that it is committed to catching the culprits and has imposed fines of up to $25,000 and threatened to confiscate tankers if dumping persists. The municipality maintains that test results show samples of the water are "within the standards".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wheeler |first=Julia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7663883.stm |title=Raw sewage threat to booming Dubai |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-10-13 |accessdate=2013-09-11}}</ref> As of September 2009, these queues and illegal dumping are no longer reported to be a problem.<ref>{{cite web|last=Menon|first=Preveen|title=No more queues at sewage terminal|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/environment/no-more-queues-at-sewage-terminal|publisher=The National|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>

On [[Valentine's Day]] 2013, the Dubai Miracle Garden, a 72,000-square meter flower garden, opened in [[Dubailand|Dubailand.]] It is currently the world's largest flower garden. When complete it will have 45 million flowers with re-use of waste water through [[drip irrigation]].

The Public Bus Transport system in Dubai is run by the RTA. The bus system services 140 routes and transported over 109 million people in 2008. By the end of 2010, there will be 2,100 buses in service across the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090609/NATIONAL/706089859/1010 |title=Dubai buses may be privatised <U+2013> The National Newspaper |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=8 June 2009 |accessdate=14 July 2009}}</ref> In 2006, the Transport authority announced the construction of 500 air-conditioned (A/C) Passenger Bus Shelters, and planned for 1,000 more across the emirates in a move to encourage the use of public buses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/traffic-transport/air-conditioned-bus-shelters-for-dubai-1.195356|title=Gulfnews: Air-conditioned bus shelters for Dubai|publisher=Archive.gulfnews.com |date=6 March 2010 |accessdate=10 March 2006}}</ref>

All taxi services are licenced by the RTA. Dubai licensed taxis are easily identifiable by their cream bodywork colour and varied roof colours identifying the operator. Dubai Taxi Corporation, a division of the RTA, is the largest operator and has taxis with red roofs. There are four private operators: Metro Taxis (orange roofs); Network Taxis (yellow roofs); Cars Taxis (blue roofs); and Arabia Taxis (green roofs). In addition, Dubai Taxi Corporation has a Ladies Taxi service, with pink roofs, which caters exclusively for female passengers, using female drivers.

The UAE culture mainly revolves around the religion of Islam and traditional Arab and [[Bedouin]] culture. In contrast, the city of Dubai is a highly cosmopolitan society with a diverse and vibrant culture. The influence of Islamic and Arab culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine and lifestyle are very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are called to prayer from the [[minaret]]s of mosques which are scattered around the country. Since 2006, the weekend has been Friday-Saturday, as a compromise between Friday's holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday-Sunday.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Sheikh-Miller |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/95027.html |title=UAE Weekend Switchover |publisher=AMEinfo |accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref>

In 2005, 84% of the population of metropolitan Dubai was foreign-born, about half of them from India.<ref name=migrationinformation/> The city's cultural imprint as a small, ethnically homogenous pearling community was changed with the arrival of other ethnic groups and nationals<U+2014>first by the Iranians in the early 1900s, and later by Indians and Pakistanis in the 1960s.

Major holidays in Dubai include [[Eid al Fitr]], which marks the end of [[Ramadan]], and [[National Day]] (2 December ), which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates. Annual entertainment events such as the [[Dubai Shopping Festival]]<ref>[http://www.traveldealsfinder.com/travel-packages/dubai-shopping-festival Dubai Shopping Festival 2011] More Details</ref> (DSF) and [[Dubai Summer Surprises]] (DSS) attract over 4&nbsp;million visitors from across the region and generate revenues in excess of $2.7&nbsp;billion.<ref name=dsf>[http://www.dubaicityguide.com/site/dsf/milestones.asp DSF Milestones].

The [[International Festivals and Events Association|International Festivals and Events Association (IFEA)]], the world's leading events trade association, has crowned Dubai as ''IFEA World Festival and Event City, 2012'' in the cities category with a population of more than one million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?xfile=/data/nationgeneral/2012/September/nationgeneral_September341.xml&section=nationgeneral|title=Dubai is world's festival city |date=23 September 2012 |publisher=khaleejtimes.com|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.definitelydubai.com/2012/09/23/dubai-crowned-world-festival-and-event-city-by-ifea/|title=Dubai crowned World Festival and Event City by IFEA |date=23 September 2012 |publisher=news.definitelydubai.com|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>

Large shopping malls in the city, such as [[Deira City Centre]], [[Mirdiff City Centre]], [[BurJuman]], [[Mall of the Emirates]], [[Dubai Mall]] and [[Ibn Battuta Mall]] as well as traditional ''souks'' attract shoppers from the region.

Khor Dubai, or Dubai Creek in English, is one of the few places in the city where old traditions could still be seen. [http://www.dubaichronicle.com/2013/06/04/dubai-creek-may-become-a-unesco-world-heritage-site/ Dubai Creek may become a UNESCO World Heritage Site] if the authorities' bid is successful. In that case, it will earn a place among internationally famous sites such as Grand Canyon, Yellowstone National Park and Stonehenge.

===Food===
{{See also|Emirati cuisine}}
[[Arab cuisine|Arabic food]] is very popular and is available everywhere in the city, from the small ''[[shawarma]]'' diners in [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] and [[Al Karama, Dubai|Al Karama]] to the restaurants in Dubai's hotels. Fast food, South Asian, and Chinese cuisines are also very popular and are widely available.

A liquor permit is required to purchase alcohol; however, alcohol is available in bars and restaurants within hotels.<ref name="Dubai Culture"/> ''[[Hookah|Shisha]]'' and ''[[coffee|qahwa]]'' boutiques are also popular in Dubai. Dubai is known for its nightlife. Clubs and bars are found mostly in hotels due to the liquor laws. The ''[[New York Times]]'' described Dubai as "the kind of city where you might run into Michael Jordan at the Buddha Bar or stumble across Naomi Campbell celebrating her birthday with a multiday bash".<ref name="nyt">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/travel/09party.html?_r=1&ex=1212987600&en=f13e9687f3c7e636&ei=5087&excamp=GGTRdubaitravel&WT.srch=1&WT.mc_ev=click&WT.mc_id=TR-S-E-GG-NA-CT-dubai_travel|title=Clubs Bloom in the Desert |last=Sherwood|first=Seth|date=9 December 2007|work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref>

Dubai has a vast variety of cuisines for people from all over the world. One of the most popular cuisines in Dubai is Indian.

===Dress and etiquette===
The Islamic dress code is not compulsory. Most Emirati males prefer to wear a [[thawb|kandura]], an ankle-length white shirt woven from wool or cotton, and most Emirati women wear an [[abaya]], a black over-garment covering most parts of the body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grapeshisha.com/UAE-National-clothing.html |title=Clothing in the UAE |publisher=Grapeshisha.com |accessdate=15 July 2009}}</ref> On an average a UAE male national would have up to 50 kanduras as they keep changing their clothing to ensure the dress being kept clean.<ref name="UAE National Dress">{{cite web|url=http://yagulf.com/uae/uae-national-dress.html |title=UAE National Dress |publisher=yagulf.com}}</ref> This attire is particularly well-suited for the UAE's hot and dry climate, the reason being that the white cloak reflects back the sunlight, for the same reason the UAE men wear white cloaks throughout the summer season while colorful cloaks are seen during the winters.<ref name="UAE National Dress"/> Conversely, the black clothing that women are obliged to wear absorbs and concentrates the sunlight. Western-style clothing is, however, dominant because of the large expatriate population, and this practice is beginning to grow in popularity among Emiratis.

Prohibitions on "indecent clothing" are an aspect of the UAE  to which visitors are expected to conform. Recently, many expatriates have disregarded the law and been arrested for indecent clothing, or lack thereof, at beaches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gulfnews.com/nation/General/10323797.html |title=Blame Europeans for topless displays, British women say |publisher=Gulfnews |accessdate=15 July 2009}}</ref> Western-style dress is tolerated in places such as bars or clubs, but the UAE has enforced anti-indecency prohibitions in other public spaces.

Approximately 10% of the population has university or postgraduate degrees. Many expatriates tend to send their children back to their home country or to Western countries for university education and to India for technology studies. However, a sizeable number of foreign accredited universities have been set up in the city over the last ten years. Some of these universities include [[Hult International Business School]], Manchester Business School,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbs.ac.uk/mba/global/|title=Global MBA programmes |publisher=University of Manchester Business School|accessdate=23 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref> [[RIT Dubai]], Michigan State University Dubai (MSU Dubai),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dubai.msu.edu/|title=About MSU Dubai|publisher=Michigan State University <U+2013> Dubai|accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> [[Middlesex University#Dubai|Middlesex University Dubai campus]],<ref name="MDXDubai">{{cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/Location/dubai/index.aspx|title=Dubai|publisher=Middlesex University|accessdate=25 December 2010}}</ref> the Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani <U+2013> Dubai (BITS Pilani), Murdoch University Dubai, Heriot-Watt University Dubai, American University in Dubai (AUD), Gulf Medical University [[Gulf Medical College]], European university college(nicolas and asp postgraduate dental college), the American College of Dubai, Mahatma Gandhi University (Off-Campus Centre), Amity University in Dubai,Institute of Management Technology <U+2013> Dubai Campus, SP Jain Center of Management, University of Wollongong in Dubai, University of Waterloo <U+2013> UAE Campus, and MAHE Manipal.

==Healthcare==
[[File:Dubai Al Wasl Rd.jpg|thumb|Iranian Hospital]]
Healthcare in Dubai can be divided in two different sectors; public and private. While we are focusing on Dubai, each Emirate is able to dictate health care standards according to their internal laws, although the standards and regulations rarely have extreme differences. Public hospitals in Dubai were first built in the late 1950s and continued to grow with public health initiatives. In the 80<U+2019>s to <U+2018>98 there were more than 20 medical clinics built within the Emirate. Dubai decided to keep the momentum going by following the WHO<U+2019>s policy of <U+2018>Healthcare for all by 2000<U+2019> and kept building. 2007 launched a new year and a new initiative of the Dubai Health Care Authority, which opened to continue progress in regulations and movements in healthcare in regards to health care. UAE nationals make up less than 20% of the population in Dubai, making the rest of the population foreign. In the past there has been no laws forbidding foreign nationals using the national and public healthcare systems. Unfortunately due to the population overload of the international community, most hospital beds seemed to be used less for those from the homeland and more for everybody else.

Dubai has a well-established network, radio, television and electronic media which serve the city. Dubai is the home of the Arabian Radio Network, which broadcasts eight FM radio stations including the first talk radio station in the Middle East, Dubai Eye 103.8. Dubai-based FM radio stations such as Radio 1 and Radio 2 (104.1 and 99.3), Dubai92 (92.0), Al Khaleejia (100.9) and Hit FM (96.7) provide programming in English, Arabic and South Asian languages. Multiple international channels available through cable, while satellite, radio and local channels are provided via the Arabian Radio Network and Dubai Media Incorporated systems. The UAE's most popular English radio station, [[Channel 4 FM]], took to the air in 1997 and became the UAE's first private commercial radio station.

Many international news agencies such as [[Reuters]], [[Associated Press Television News|APTN]], [[Bloomberg L.P.]] and [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]] (MBC) as well as network news channels operate in Dubai Media City and Dubai Internet City. Additionally, several local network television channels such as [[Dubai One]] (formerly Channel 33), and [[Dubai TV]] (EDTV) provide programming in English and Arabic respectively. Dubai is also the headquarters for several print media outlets. ''[[Dar Al Khaleej]]'', ''[[Al Bayan]]'' and ''[[Al-Ittihad (Emirati newspaper)|Al Ittihad]]'' are the city's largest circulating Arabic language newspapers,<ref name=alkhaleej>[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/New_Chart.pdf Largest-Circulation Arabic Newspapers].

Etisalat, the government-owned telecommunications provider, held a virtual monopoly over telecommunication services in Dubai prior to the establishment of other, smaller telecommunications companies such as Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC<U+2014>better known as Du) in 2006. Internet was introduced into the UAE (and therefore Dubai) in 1995. The current network has an Internet bandwidth of 7.5 Gbit/s with capacity of 49 STM1 links.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/etisalat-ramps-up-uae-bandwidth-62960.html|title=Etisalat ramps up UAE bandwidth|date=11 June 2006|publisher=arabianbusiness.com|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> Dubai houses two of four Domain Name System (DNS) data centres in the country (DXBNIC1, DXBNIC2).<ref name="dxbittopology">{{cite web|url=http://www.isoc.org/isoc/conferences/inet/05/hashim.pdf|title=UAEnicat a Glance|last=Hashim|first=Abdulla|date=5 May 2005|publisher=isoc.org|accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>

Internet content is regulated in Dubai. Etisalat uses a proxy server to filter Internet content that the government deems to be inconsistent with the values of the country, such as sites that provide information on how to bypass the proxy; sites pertaining to dating, gay and lesbian networks, and pornography; sites pertaining to the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]] and sites originating from [[Israel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opennet.net/studies/uae|title=Internet Filtering in the United Arab Emirates in 2004<U+2013>2005: A Country Study|date=5 May 2005|publisher=OpenNet Initiative|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> Emirates Media and Internet (a division of Etisalat) notes that as of 2002, 76% of Internet users are male. About 60% of Internet users were Asian, while 25% of users were Arab. Dubai enacted an Electronic Transactions and Commerce Law in 2002 which deals with digital signatures and electronic registers.
