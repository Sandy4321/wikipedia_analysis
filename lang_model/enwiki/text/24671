Colorado is part of the [[Western United States]], the [[Mountain States]], and the [[Southwestern United States]].

The state was named for the [[Colorado River]], which early [[Spain|Spanish]] explorers named the ''Rio Colorado'' for the red colored ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Colorado'') silt the river carried from the mountains. In 1861, [[Jefferson Territory|Jefferson Territorial]] officials decided that "Colorado" would be a fitting name for a new territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/history/symbemb.htm |title=Colorado Department of Personnel & Administration (DPA) Division of Information Technologies (DoIT) |publisher=Colorado.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/history/histfaqs.htm |title=Colorado Department of Personnel & Administration (DPA) Division of Information Technologies (DoIT) |publisher=Colorado.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> Colorado is nicknamed the "[[List of U.S. state nicknames|Centennial State]]" because it was admitted to the [[United States|Union]] as the 38th state in 1876, the [[century|centennial year]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

Colorado is bordered by the [[Northwestern United States|northwest]] state of [[Wyoming]] to the north, the [[Midwestern United States|midwest]] states of [[Nebraska]] and [[Kansas]] to the northeast and east, on the south by [[New Mexico]] and a small portion of the [[Southern United States|southern]] state of [[Oklahoma]], and on the west by [[Utah]]. The four states of Colorado, [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and [[Utah]] meet at one common point known as the [[Four Corners (United States)|Four Corners]], which is known as the heart of the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. Colorado is one of only three U.S. states with no natural borders, the others being neighboring [[Wyoming]] and [[Utah]].

Colorado is noted for its vivid landscape of [[mountains]], forests, [[High Plains (United States)|high plains]], [[mesa]]s, [[canyon]]s, [[plateau]]s, [[river]]s, and [[Desert|desert lands]]. The [[2010 United States Census]] tallied the state population at 5,029,196 as of April 1, 2010, an increase of +16.92% since the [[2000 United States Census]]. [[Denver]] is the [[capital (political)|capital]] and the [[Colorado municipalities by population|most populous city]] of Colorado. Residents of the state are properly known as "[[List of demonyms for U.S. states|Coloradans]]", although the archaic term "Coloradoan" is still used.<ref name=statestyle>[http://ccs.colostate.edu/style_guide/style_guide_az.aspx#state_names Writers Style Guide], Colorado State University.

[[File:6601-RedRocksTheater.JPG|thumb|[[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]], west of Denver, where the Plains meet the Rockies.]]
A little over one fourth of the area of Colorado is flat and rolling land. East of the Rocky Mountains are the [[Colorado Eastern Plains]] of the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]], the section of the Great Plains within Colorado at elevations ranging from roughly {{convert|3350|to|7360|ft|m|abbr=off}}.The midwest plains states of Kansas and Nebraska border Colorado to the east and northeast. The Colorado plains are usually thought of as [[prairie]]s, but actually they have many patches of [[deciduous forests]], [[butte]]s, and [[canyons]], much like the high plains in New Mexico as well. Eastern Colorado is presently mainly covered in farmland, along with small farming villages and towns. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is fair, averaging from {{convert|15|to|25|in|mm|abbr=off}} annually.<ref name=ccc>{{cite web|url=http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/climateofcolorado.php|title=Climate of Colorado |last=Doesken|first=Nolan J.|coauthors=[[Roger A.

Bliss |date=January 2003|publisher=Colorado Climate Center <U+2013> Department of Atmospheric Science <U+2013> [[Colorado State University]]|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref> The summers in the plains are normally hot and dry, while the winters are often quite cold, snowy, and icy. [[maize|Corn]], [[wheat]], [[hay]], [[soybeans]], and [[oats]] are all typical crops, and most of the villages and towns in this region boast both a [[water tower]] and a [[grain elevator]]. As well as the farming of [[crop]]s, Eastern Colorado has a good deal of [[livestock]] raising, such as at [[cattle]] ranches and [[Intensive pig farming|hog farm]]s. In eastern Colorado, a good deal of [[irrigation]] water is available from the South Platte, the Arkansas River, and a few other streams, and also from subterranean sources, including [[artesian well]]s. However, heavy use of ground water from wells for irrigation has caused underground water reserves to decline.

[[File:ChicoClosedBasin.jpg|thumb|The high desert terrain of the [[San Luis Valley]] in southern Colorado.]]
Most of Colorado's population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]] between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The only other significant population centers are at Grand Junction and [[Durango, CO|Durango]] in far western Colorado.

[[File:LovelandPass CMM.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Continental Divide]] dips down to {{convert|11990|ft|m|0|sp=us}} at [[Loveland Pass]].]]
To the west of Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include [[Longs Peak]], [[Mount Evans]], [[Pikes Peak]], and the [[Spanish Peaks]] near [[Walsenburg, Colorado]], in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the [[Mississippi River]] or the [[Rio Grande]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

The [[Continental Divide]] extends along the crest of the Rocky Mountains. The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope of Colorado]]. Drainage water west of the Continental Divide flows to the southwest via the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] and the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] into the [[Gulf of California]].

Within the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large so-called "parks" or high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the [[North Park (Colorado basin)|North Park of Colorado]]. The North Park is drained by the [[North Platte River]], which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park of Colorado]], which is drained by the Colorado River. The [[South Park (Colorado basin)|South Park of Colorado]] is the region of the [[headwater]]s of the South Platte River.

In southmost Colorado is the large [[San Luis Valley]], where the headwaters of the [[Rio Grande]] are located. The valley sits between the [[Sangre De Cristo Mountains]] and [[San Juan Mountains]], and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Across the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the [[Rio Grande Rift]], a major [[geological formation]] of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.

The Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain about 54 peaks that are {{convert|14000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} or higher in elevation above sea level, known as [[Colorado fourteeners|fourteeners]].<ref>{{cite web |author=U.S. Forest Service |title=Rocky Mountain Region 14ers |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/recreation/14ers/ |accessdate=November 6, 2009}}</ref> These mountains are largely covered with trees such as [[conifer]]s and [[aspen]]s up to the [[tree line]], at an elevation of about {{convert|12140|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in southern Colorado to about {{convert|10500|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in northern Colorado. Above this only alpine vegetation grows. Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year round. Much of the alpine snow melts by mid-August with the exception of a few snowcapped peaks and a few small glaciers. The [[Colorado Mineral Belt]], stretching from the [[San Juan Mountains]] in the southwest to [[Boulder, CO|Boulder]] and [[Central City, CO|Central City]] on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado.

[[File:Mount Elbert2.JPG|thumb|[[Mount Elbert]], the tallest peak in the [[Rocky Mountains]].]]
The 30 [[Highest mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains|highest major summits]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[North America]] all lie within the state. Colorado is home to [[List of national parks in Colorado|four national parks]], [[National monuments of Colorado|six national monuments]], [[National recreation areas of Colorado|two national recreation areas]], [[National historic sites of Colorado|two national historic sites]], [[National historic trails of Colorado|three national historic trails]], [[National scenic trail of Colorado|a national scenic trail]], [[National forests of Colorado|11 national forests]], [[National grasslands of Colorado|two national grasslands]], [[National wilderness areas of Colorado|41 national wilderness areas]], [[List of federal lands in Colorado#National Conservation Areas|two national conservation areas]], [[National wildlife refuges of Colorado|eight national wildlife refuges]], [[List of Colorado state parks|44 state parks]], [[Colorado State Forest|a state forest]], [[Colorado Division of Wildlife|323 state wildlife areas]], and numerous other scenic, historic, and recreational attractions.

The Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] and the [[San Juan River (California)|San Juan River]]), or by evaporation in its arid areas. Prominent in the southwestern area of the Western Slope are the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range, and to the west of the San Juan Mountains, the [[Colorado Plateau]], a high arid region that borders Southern Utah. The city of [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], is the largest city on the Western Slope, Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of [[radio broadcasting|radio]] and [[television broadcasting]], [[newspaper]]s, and higher education on the Western Slope. The [[Mesa State College]] in Grand Junction, Western State College in Gunnison, and Fort Lewis College in Durango are the only four-year colleges in Colorado west of the [[Continental Divide]].
[[File:6408-LovelandPassCOLO.jpg|thumb|left|August, 1964. Continental Divide at the top of Loveland Pass]]

Grand Junction is located along [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]], the only major highway of Western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the [[Union Pacific]], which also provides the tracks for [[Amtrak]]'s [[California Zephyr]] passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways.

To the southeast of Grand Junction is the [[Grand Mesa]], said to be the world's largest flat-topped mountain. Other towns of the Western Slope include [[Glenwood Springs, CO|Glenwood Springs]] with its resort hot springs, and the [[ski resort]]s of [[Aspen, CO|Aspen]], [[Breckenridge, CO|Breckenridge]], [[Vail, CO|Vail]], [[Crested Butte, CO|Crested Butte]], [[Steamboat Springs, CO|Steamboat Springs]], and [[Telluride, CO|Telluride]].

[[File:Grand Mesa and Mt. Garfield.jpg|thumb|[[Grand Mesa]], the largest mesa in the world.]]

The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely-populated region, and it contains part of the noted [[Dinosaur National Monument]], which is not only a [[paleontology|paleontological]] area, but is also a scenic area of high, rocky hills, canyons, and streambeads. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado.

From west to east, the land of Colorado consists of desert lands and desert plateaus, then alpine mountains with National Forests, than some scattered desert land in the southern mountain areas in the state, and then the relatively-flat grasslands and scattered forests of the [[Great Plains]]. The famous [[Pikes Peak]] is located just west of [[Colorado Springs, CO|Colorado Springs]]. Its isolated peak is visible from nearly the Kansas border on clear days, and also far to the north and the south.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=5689 |name=Pikes Peak, Colorado |accessdate=October 10, 2009}}</ref> The desert lands in Colorado are located in and around areas such as, the [[Royal Gorge]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Canon City, Colorado|Canon City]], [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Canyon of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], [[Ute Mountain]], [[Delta, Colorado|Delta]], [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Colorado National Monument]], [[Roan Plateau]], and other areas surrounding the [[Uncompahgre Plateau]] and [[Uncompahgre National Forest]].

Colorado is one of four states in the United States that share a common geographic point the [[Four Corners (United States)|Four Corners]], together with Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. At this intersection, it is possible to stand in four states at once.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Bearlakeinspring2.jpg|thumb|Spring melt at [[Bear Lake (Colorado)|Bear Lake]] in [[Rocky Mountain National Park]].]]

The [[climate]] of Colorado is quite complex compared to most of the United States. Unlike in other states, southern Colorado is not necessarily warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate. As a general rule, with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in [[temperature]] and an increase in [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.

==== Eastern Plains ====
[[File:PivotWithDrops.JPG|thumb|[[Center pivot irrigation]] of [[wheat]] growing in [[Yuma County, CO|Yuma County]].]]

The climate of the Eastern Plains is [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] ''[[Semi-arid climate#Cold Semi-arid climates|''BSk'']]'') with low [[humidity]] and moderate [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], usually from {{convert|15|to|25|in|mm|abbr=off}} annually. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool clear nights, which give this area a great average [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal temperature range]]. In summer, this area can have many days above {{convert|95|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|abbr=on}} and sometimes {{convert|100|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|abbr=on}},<ref name="Climate of Colorado">[http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/COLORADO.htm DRI.edu] Western Regional Climate Center. Retrieved October 24, 2006.</ref> although {{convert|105|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|abbr=on}} is the maximum in the front range cities above {{convert|5000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. In the plains, the winter extremes can be from 0 <U+00B0>F (-18 <U+00B0>C) to {{convert|-10|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-15|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|abbr=on}}. About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from [[thunderstorm]]s, which are often severe, and from major [[snowstorm]]s that occur most often in the early spring, late autumn, and sometimes winter. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold. In much of the region, March and April are the snowiest months. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to [[chinook wind]]s which warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of {{convert|40|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|abbr=on}} or higher in the winter.<ref name="Climate of Colorado"/> The average July temperature is {{convert|55|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} in the morning and {{convert|80|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} in the afternoon. The average January temperature is {{convert|10|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} in the morning and {{convert|30|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (22&nbsp;<U+00B0>C).<!--this is a temperature difference, so the convert template shouldn't be used here-->

==== West of the plains and foothills ====
[[File:GrandJunctionTrip92007013.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope]] from [[Grand Junction, CO|Grand Junction]].]]

West of the plains and foothills, the weather of Colorado is much less uniform. Even places a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography of the area. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate, which becomes an [[alpine climate]] at higher elevations. Humid [[microclimate]]s also exist in some areas. Generally, the wettest season in western Colorado is winter while June is the driest month. This is the opposite of precipitation patterns in the east. The mountains have cool summers with many days of high temperatures around {{convert|60|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|abbr=on}} to {{convert|70|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|abbr=on}}, although frequent thunderstorms can cause sudden drops in temperature. Summer nights are cool or even cold at the highest elevations, which sometimes get snow even in the middle of the summer. The winters bring abundant, powdery snowfall to the mountains with abundant sunshine in between major storms. The western slope has high summer temperatures similar to those found on the plains, while the winters tend to be slightly cooler due to the lack of warming winds common to the plains and Front Range. Other areas in the west have their own unique climate.

==== Extreme weather ====
[[File:October Snow in Colorado.jpg|thumb|Snow highlights the rugged mountains as well as the urban and agricultural landscapes of the Colorado plains.]]

Extreme weather is a common occurrence in Colorado. Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental divide in the spring and summer, and Colorado is one of the leading states in deaths due to [[lightning]]. [[Hail]] is a common sight in the mountains east of the divide and in the northwest part of the state. The Eastern Plains have some of the biggest hail storms in North America.<ref name=ccc/> Also the Eastern Plains are part of [[Tornado Alley]] and produce some of the deadliest U.S. tornadoes. Some damaging tornadoes in the Eastern Plains include the 1990 [[Limon, CO|Limon]] [[Fujita scale|F3]] tornado and the 2008 [[Windsor, CO|Windsor]] [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF3]] tornado, which devastated the town.<ref>{{cite web

The plains are also susceptible to [[flood]]s, which are caused both by thunderstorms and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather. Denver's record in 1921 for the number of consecutive days above {{convert|90|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} was broken during the summer of 2008. The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.<ref>{{cite web

However, there are some of the mountainous regions of Colorado which receive a huge amount of moisture via winter snowfalls. The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in such rivers as the [[Yampa River]], the [[Colorado River|Grand River]], the Colorado River, the Rio Grande, the Arkansas River, [[Cherry Creek (Colorado)|Cherry Creek]], the North Platte River, and the South Platte River. Water flowing out of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms, towns, and cities of fellow southwest states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, as well as midwest like Nebraska and Kansas, and also southern states like Oklahoma and Texas. A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and consistently) the flow of water reaches northern Mexico.

{{Main|History of Colorado |Outline of Colorado history}}
The region that is today the State of Colorado has been inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for more than 13 millennia. The [[Lindenmeier Site]] in [[Larimer County, CO|Larimer County]] contains [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] dating from approximately 11200 BCE to 3000 BCE. The eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was a [[Human migration|major migration route]] that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the [[Americas]]. The [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]] lived in the [[valley]]s and [[mesa]]s of the [[Colorado Plateau]].<ref>"[http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/genocide-native-americans-ethnic-cleansing.html Genocide Wiped Out Native American Population ]", Discovery News, September 20, 2010.</ref> The [[Ute Nation]] inhabited the mountain valleys of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Western Rocky Mountains]]. The [[Arapaho Nation]] and the [[Cheyenne Nation]] moved west to hunt across the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]].

The United States acquired a territorial claim to the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim of Spain to a huge region surrounding its [[colony]] of [[Santa F<U+00E9> de Nuevo M<U+00E9>jico]] as its [[sovereignty|sovereign]] trading zone with native peoples. [[Zebulon Pike]] led a [[Pike expedition|U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition]] into the disputed region in 1806. Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the [[San Luis Valley]] the following February, taken to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], and then expelled from Mexico the following July.

[[File:Beol court25.jpg|thumb|[[Bent's Old Fort]] along the [[Arkansas River]] operated from 1833 to 1849.]]
The United States relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the [[Arkansas River]] and south of [[42nd parallel north]] and west of the [[100th meridian west]] as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the [[Adams-On<U+00ED>s Treaty]] of 1819. The treaty took effect February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the United States admitted the southeastern portion of the [[Territory of Missouri]] to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[State of Missouri]] on August 10, 1821. The remainder of the [[Missouri Territory]], including what would become northeastern Colorado, became unorganized territory, and would remain so for 33 years over the [[Slavery in the United States|question of slavery]]. After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [[Treaty of C<U+00F3>rdoba]] signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adams-On<U+00ED>s Treaty in 1831. The [[Texian Revolt]] of 1835<U+2013>1836 fomented a dispute between the United States and Mexico which eventually erupted into the [[Mexican-American War]] in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the United States with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] at the conclusion of the war in 1848.

Most American [[settler]]s traveling overland west to the [[Oregon Country]], the new goldfields of California, or the new [[Mormon]] settlements of [[State of Deseret|Deseret]] in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], avoided the rugged [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], and instead followed the [[North Platte River]] and [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] to [[South Pass]], the lowest crossing of the [[Continental Divide]] between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal [[State of Deseret]], claiming the entire [[Great Basin]] and all lands drained by the [[Green River (Utah)|Green]], [[Colorado River|Grand]], and [[Colorado River|Colorado]] rivers. The federal government of the United States flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government, because it was [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership|theocratic]] and sanctioned [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]]. Instead, the [[Compromise of 1850]] divided the [[Mexican Cession]] and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the [[State of California]], the [[Territory of New Mexico]], and the [[Territory of Utah]]. On April 9, 1851, [[Mexican American]] settlers from the area of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] settled the village of [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]], then in the [[New Mexico Territory]], later to become Colorado's first permanent [[English American|Anglo American]] [[settlement (migration)|settlement]].

In 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] persuaded the [[U.S. Congress]] to divide the unorganized territory east of the [[Continental Divide]] into two new organized territories, the [[Territory of Kansas]] and the [[Territory of Nebraska]], and an unorganized southern region known as the [[Indian territory]]. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between [[free soil]] and [[Proslavery in the antebellum United States|pro-slavery]] factions.

[[Gold]] was discovered along the [[South Platte River]] then in western [[Kansas Territory]] in July 1858, precipitating the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]].<ref name=PikesPeakGold>{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Falls/2000/index.html | title = The Pike's Peak Gold Rush | author = Gehling, Richard | publisher = Richard Gehling | year = 2006 | accessdate = June 12, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080628172253/http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Falls/2000/index.html|archivedate=2008-06-28}}</ref> The [[placer deposit|placer gold deposits]] along the rivers and streams of the region rapidly played out, but miners soon discovered far more valuable seams of [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock]] gold in the nearby mountains.

[[File:Denver 1859.jpg|thumb|A [[lithograph]] of the [[Denver, CO|Denver City]] mining camp in 1859.]]
The gold seekers organized the [[Jefferson Territory|Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson]] on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the [[Congress of the United States]] embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the [[secession]] of nine southern [[slave states]] and the threat of [[American Civil War|civil war among the states]]. Seeking to augment the political power of the [[free state (United States)|Union states]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the [[Territory of Kansas]] into the [[United States|Union]] as the free [[State of Kansas]] on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.

Thirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] signed an Act of Congress organizing the [[Free state (United States)|free]] [[Territory of Colorado]].<ref name=ColoradoTerritory>{{cite web | url = http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/territory.pdf | title = An Act to provide a temporary Government for the Territory of Colorado | format = PDF | publisher = [[Thirty-sixth United States Congress]] | date = February 28, 1861 | accessdate = June 12, 2007}}</ref> The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged today. The name Colorado was chosen because it was commonly believed that the [[Colorado River]] originated in the territory.<ref name=Colorado_River>Early explorers identified the [[Gunnison River]] in Colorado as the [[headwaters]] of the Colorado River. The [[Colorado River|Grand River]] in Colorado was later tentively identified as the primary headwaters of the river. Finally in 1916, [[E.C. LaRue]], the Chief Hydrologist of the [[United States Geological Survey]], identified the Green River in southwestern Wyoming as the proper headwaters of the actual, overall  Colorado River.</ref> Early Spanish explorers named the Colorado River the "Rio Colorado" for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.<ref>{{cite web |author=State of Colorado <U+2013> Division of Information Technologies |url=http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/history/symbemb.htm#Name|title=State Names and Nicknames |accessdate=November 15, 2006}}</ref> In 1859, a [[U.S. Army]] [[Topography|topographic]] expedition led by Captain [[John Navarre Macomb, Jr.|John Macomb]] located the confluence of the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] with the [[Grand River (Colorado)|Grand River]] in what is now [[Canyonlands National Park]] in [[Utah]].<ref name=Macomb>Report of the exploring expedition from Santa F<U+00E9>, New Mexico, to the junction of the Grand and Green Rivers of the great Colorado of the West, in 1859:

In fact, the river that is now named the Colorado River did not flow through Colorado until the House of Representatives Joint Resolution 460 of the [[66th United States Congress]] changed the name of the Grand River to the Colorado River on July 25, 1921, in spite of the fact that the Green River had the more extensive [[drainage basin]].<ref name=Grand_River>{{cite web | url = http://www.summitdaily.com/article/20031223/OPINION/312230302 | title = Many years ago, the Colorado River was just Grand | author = Colorado River Water Conservation District | publisher = Summit Daily News | year = 2003 | accessdate = June 12, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:The-Battle-of-Glorieta-Pass.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], 1862]]
On April 12, 1861, [[South Carolina]] artillery opened fire on [[Fort Sumter]] to start the [[American Civil War]]. While many gold seekers held sympathies for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause. In 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the [[Territory of New Mexico]] and captured [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. The object of this [[New Mexico Campaign|Western Campaign]] was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of Colorado and California and to seize ports on the Pacific Ocean for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from [[Denver City, Colorado Territory]], to [[Glorieta Pass]], New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and ran off 500 head of their horses and mules. The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe. Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico, the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to [[San Antonio]] in defeat. The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the [[Southwestern United States]].

In 1864, [[Governor of Colorado|Territorial Governor]] [[John Evans (governor)|John Evans]] appointed the Reverend [[John Chivington]] as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his men to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along [[Sand Creek massacre|Sand Creek]]. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so called battle was nothing more than a [[Sand Creek massacre|massacre]] of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that bodies of the dead had been mutilated and desecrated in hideous manner. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming [[U.S. President|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished.

[[File:Mount of the Holy Cross.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Mount of the Holy Cross]] was photographed by [[William Henry Jackson]] in 1874]]
In the midst and aftermath of Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a determined few stayed on to develop mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in the Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered [[silver]] near [[Argentine Pass]], the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] laid its tracks west to [[Julesburg, Colorado|Weir]], now [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]], in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], on May 10, 1869, to form the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The [[Denver Pacific Railway]] reached Denver in June of the following year, and the [[Kansas Pacific]] arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the [[San Juan Mountains]] on the [[Ute tribe|Ute Indian]] reservation in southwestern Colorado. The Ute people were removed from the San Juans the following year.

The [[United States Congress]] passed an enabling act on March 3, 1875, specifying the requirements for the [[Territory of Colorado]] to become a state.<ref name=Colorado_Enabling_Act>{{cite web|url=http://www.i2i.org/Publications/ColoradoConstitution/cnenable.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080507151300/http://www.i2i.org/Publications/ColoradoConstitution/cnenable.htm|archivedate=2008-05-07|title=An Act to Enable the People of Colorado to Form a Constitution and State Government, and for the Admission of the Said State into the Union on an Equal Footing with the Original States|format=PDF|author=[[Forty-third United States Congress]]|date=March 3, 1875|accessdate=April 14, 2008}}</ref> On August 2, 1876 (28 days after the [[Centennial of the United States]]), U.S. President [[Ulysses S.

[[File:Georgetown loop 1899.jpg|thumb|The [[Georgetown Loop]] of the [[Colorado Central Railroad]] as photographed by [[William Henry Jackson]] in 1899]]
The discovery of a major [[silver]] lode near [[Leadville, CO|Leadville]] in 1878, triggered the [[Colorado Silver Boom]]. The [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] of 1890 invigorated silver mining, and Colorado's last, but greatest, gold strike at [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] a few months later lured a new generation of gold seekers. Colorado women were granted the [[suffrage|right to vote]] beginning on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant [[universal suffrage]] and the first one by a [[popular vote]] (of Colorado men). The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado, but the state slowly and steadily recovered.

Colorado became the first western state to host a major political convention when the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] met in Denver in 1908. By the [[United States Census, 1930|U.S. Census in 1930]], the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents. Colorado suffered greatly through the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s, but a major wave of immigration following World War II boosted Colorado's fortune. [[Tourism]] became a mainstay of the state economy, and [[high technology]] became an important economic engine. The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009.

Three [[warship]]s of the [[U.S. Navy]] have been named the USS ''[[USS Colorado|Colorado]]''. The first USS ''Colorado'' was named for the Colorado River. The later two ships were named in honor of the state, including the [[battleship]] USS ''[[USS Colorado (BB-45)|Colorado]]'' which served in [[War in the Pacific|World War II in the Pacific]] beginning in 1941. At the time of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], this USS ''Colorado'' was located at the naval base in [[San Diego, CA|San Diego, Calif.]] and hence went unscathed.

[[File:Colorado population map.png|thumb|left|410px|Colorado Population Density Map]]
Colorado's most populous city, and capital, is [[Denver, CO|Denver]]. The [[Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area]] with an estimated 2009 population of 3,110,436, is home to 61.90% of the state's residents.

As of 2005, Colorado has an estimated population of 4,665,177, which is an increase of 63,356, or 1.4%, from the prior year and an increase of 363,162, or 8.4%, since the year 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 205,321 people (that is 353,091 births minus 147,770 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 159,957 people into the state. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 112,217 people, and [[Human migration|migration]] within the country produced a net increase of 47,740 people.

The largest increases are expected in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]], especially in the [[Denver metropolitan area]]. The state's fastest-growing counties are [[Douglas County, CO|Douglas]] and [[Weld County, CO|Weld]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/top10/countyPop/coPop6.html |title=Epodunk.com |publisher=Epodunk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref> The [[center of population]] of Colorado is located just north of the village of Critchell in [[Jefferson County, CO|Jefferson County]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Population and Population Centers by State <U+2013> 2000 | publisher = United States Census Bureau | accessdate = December 4, 2008 | url = http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt}}</ref>

Colorado has a high proportion of [[Hispanic]], mostly [[Mexican-American]], citizens in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado Springs, as well as the smaller cities of Greeley and Pueblo, and in many other smaller cities and towns all throughout the state. Colorado is well known for its strong [[Latino]] culture and presence. Southern, Southwestern, and Southeastern Colorado has a large number of [[Hispanos]], the descendants of the early Mexican settlers of colonial Spanish origin. The [[2000 U.S. Census]] found that 10.5% of people aged five and over in Colorado speak only Spanish at home, with the 2009 estimate being roughly 14%. Colorado also has a large immigration presence all throughout the state, which has led to Colorado cities being referred to as "Sanctuary Cities" for illegal immigrants as well. Colorado has the 5th highest percentage of undocumented people in the U.S., only behind Nevada, Arizona, California, and tied with Texas. An estimated 5.5-6.0% of the states population being illegal immigrants. Also, over 20% of the states prisons are undocumented inmates.<ref>http://www.cairco.org/issues/issues_crime_colorado.html</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&state_id=8&mode=state_tops&order=r |title=Language Map Data Center |publisher=Mla.org |date=2007-07-17 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref> Colorado, like New Mexico, is very rich in archaic Spanish idioms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elcastellano.org/palabra.php?id=946 |title=talking about Colorado in "nada" |publisher=Elcastellano.org |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref>

Colorado also has some African-American communities located in Denver, in the neighborhoods of Montbello, Green Valley Ranch, Park Hill, Five Points, Whittier, and many other East Denver areas. A decent amount of African Americans are also found in Colorado Springs on the east and southeast side of the city. The state has sizable numbers of [[Asian-Americans]] of [[Mongolian American|Mongolian]], [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Filipino American|Filipino]], [[Koreans|Korean]], [[Southeast Asian]] and [[Japanese American|Japanese]] descent. The highest population of Asian Americans can be found on the south and southeast side of Denver, as well as some on Denver's southwest side. The Denver metropolitan area is considered more liberal and diverse than much of the state when it comes to political issues and environmental concerns.

According to the 2000 Census, the largest ancestry groups in Colorado are [[German American|German]] (22%) including of Swiss and [[Austrians|Austrian]] nationalities, [[Mexican-American|Mexican]] (18%), Irish (12%), and English (12%).

Early industry was based on the extraction and processing of minerals and agricultural products. Current agricultural products are [[cattle]], [[wheat]], [[dairy product]]s, [[maize|corn]], and [[hay]].

The [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] is also a major economic force in the state with many important federal facilities including [[NORAD]], [[United States Air Force Academy]] and [[Peterson Air Force Base]] in [[Colorado Springs]]; [[NOAA]] and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in [[Boulder, CO|Boulder]]; [[U.S. Geological Survey]] and other government agencies at the Denver Federal Center in [[Lakewood, CO|Lakewood]]; the [[Denver Mint]], [[Buckley Air Force Base]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|10th Circuit Court of Appeals]] in Denver; and a federal [[ADX Florence|Supermax Prison]] and other federal [[prisons]] near [[Ca<U+00F1>on City, CO|Ca<U+00F1>on City]].

In the second half of the 20th century, the industrial and service sectors have expanded greatly. The state's economy is diversified and is notable for its concentration of scientific research and high-technology industries. Other industries include [[food processing]], transportation equipment, [[Mechanical engineering|machinery]], [[chemical engineering|chemical products]], the extraction of metals such as gold (see [[Gold mining in Colorado]]), [[silver]], and [[molybdenum]].

A number of nationally known brand names have originated in Colorado factories and laboratories. From [[Denver#Economy|Denver]] came the forerunner of telecommunications giant [[Qwest Corporation|Qwest]] in 1879, [[Samsonite]] luggage in 1910, [[Gates Corporation|Gates]] belts and hoses in 1911, and [[Russell Stover Candies]] in 1923. Kuner canned vegetables began in [[Brighton, CO|Brighton]] in 1864. From [[Golden, CO|Golden]] came [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] beer in 1873, [[CoorsTek]] industrial ceramics in 1920, and [[Jolly Rancher]] candy in 1949. [[Colorado Fuel and Iron|CF&I]] railroad rails, wire, nails and pipe debuted in [[Pueblo, CO|Pueblo]] in 1892. [[Imperial Sugar|Holly Sugar]] was first milled from beets in [[Holly, CO|Holly]] in 1905, and later moved its headquarters to Colorado Springs. The present-day [[Swift & Company|Swift]] packed meat of [[Greeley, CO|Greeley]] evolved from Monfort of Colorado, Inc., established in 1930. [[Estes Industries|Estes]] model rockets were launched in [[Penrose, CO|Penrose]] in 1958. [[Fort Collins, CO|Fort Collins]] has been the home of [[Woodward Governor Company]]'s motor controllers (governors) since 1870, and [[Oral irrigator|Waterpik]] dental water jets and showerheads since 1962. [[Celestial Seasonings]] herbal teas have been made in [[Boulder, CO|Boulder]] since 1969. [[Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory]] made its first candy in [[Durango, CO|Durango]] in 1981.

Colorado has a flat 4.63% [[income tax]], regardless of income level. Unlike most states, which calculate taxes based on federal ''adjusted gross income'', Colorado taxes are based on ''taxable income'' <U+2013> income after federal exemptions and federal itemized (or standard) deductions.<ref>Colorado individual income tax return (2005) [http://www.revenue.state.co.us/PDF/05104f.pdf Revenue.state.co.us].

Retrieved September 26, 2006.</ref> Colorado's state [[sales tax]] is 2.9% on retail sales. When state revenues exceed state constitutional limits, full-year Colorado residents can claim a sales tax refund on their individual state income tax return. Many counties and cities charge their own rates in addition to the base state rate. There are also certain county and special district taxes that may apply.

[[Real estate]] and personal business property are taxable in Colorado. The state's senior property tax exemption was temporarily suspended by the Colorado Legislature in 2003. The tax break is scheduled to return for assessment year 2006, payable in 2007.

As of September 2010, the state's unemployment rate is 8.2%.<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/lau/ Bls.gov]; Local Area Unemployment Statistics</ref>

=== Philanthropy ===
Major [[philanthropic]] organizations based in Colorado, including the [[Daniels Fund]], the Anschutz Family Foundation, the [[Gates Family Foundation]], the El Pomar Foundation and the [[Boettcher Foundation]], grant approximately $400 million<ref>[http://www.coloradofunders.org/docs/2007%20Giving%20Study%20PublishedFinal_1.pdf Coloradofunders.org]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> each year from approximately $7 billion<ref>http://www.cof.org/files/Documents/Government/StateGiving/CO.pdf</ref> of assets.

=== Natural resources ===
Colorado has significant [[hydrocarbon]] resources. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], Colorado hosts seven of the Nation<U+2019>s 100 largest [[natural gas]] fields and two of its 100 largest [[oil field]]s. Conventional and unconventional natural gas output from several Colorado basins typically account for more than 5 percent of annual U.S. natural gas production. Colorado<U+2019>s [[oil shale]] deposits hold an estimated {{convert|1|Toilbbl|km3}} of oil <U+2013> nearly as much oil as the entire world<U+2019>s proven oil reserves; the economic viability of the oil shale, however, has not been demonstrated.<ref>{{cite web

[[Kimberlite]] [[volcanic pipe]]s have been found in Colorado; the [[Kelsey Lake Diamond Mine]] operated for several years, recovering gem quality [[diamond]]s.{{cn|date=May 2011}}

Colorado's high Rocky Mountain ridges and eastern plains offer [[wind power]] potential, and geologic activity in the mountain areas provides potential for [[geothermal power]] development. Much of the state is sunny and could produce [[solar power]]. Major rivers flowing from the Rocky Mountains offer [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] resources. Corn grown in the flat eastern part of the state offers potential resources for [[ethanol]] production.

=== Special tax districts ===
Some of the special tax districts are:
* The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties
* The [[Scientific and Cultural Facilities District]] (SCFD), a special regional tax district with physical boundaries contiguous with county boundaries of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson Counties
** It is a 0.1% retail sales and use tax (one penny on every $10).
** According to the Colorado statute, the SCFD distributes the money to local organizations on an annual basis. These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history or cultural history.
** As directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three "tiers" among which receipts are allocated by percentage.
*** Tier I includes regional organizations: the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. It receives 65.5%.
*** Tier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.
*** Tier III has over 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, and natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding to the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.
** An 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions in accordance with the Colorado Revised Statutes. Seven board members are appointed by county commissioners (in Denver, the Denver City Council) and four members are appointed by the Governor of Colorado.
* The Football Stadium District (FD or FTBL), approved by the voters to pay for and help build the [[Denver Broncos]]' stadium [[INVESCO Field at Mile High]]
* Local Improvement Districts (LID) within designated areas of southeast Jefferson and Boulder counties
* Regional Transportation Districts (RTA) taxes at varying rates in Basalt, Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, Gunnison County
* Occupational Privilege Taxes (OPT or Head Tax) Denver and Aurora both levy an OPT on Employers and Employees
** If any employee performs work in the city limits and is paid over US$500.00 for that work in a single month, the Employee and Employer are both liable for the OPT regardless of where the main business office is located or headquartered.
** In Denver, the Employer is liable for US$4.00 per employee per month and the Employee is liable for US$5.75 per month.
** In Aurora, both Employer and Employees are liable for US$2.00 per month.
** It is the Employer's responsibility to with hold, remit, and file the OPT returns. If an Employer does not comply, they can be held liable for both portions of the OPT as well as penalties and interest.

[[File:Denver capital.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Colorado State Capitol]] in [[Denver]]]]

Just like all the states, Colorado's [[state constitution]] provides for three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial branches. The [[List of Governors of Colorado|Governor]] heads the state's executive branch. The [[Colorado Supreme Court]] is the highest judicial court in the state. The state legislative body is the [[Colorado General Assembly]], which is made up of two houses, the [[Colorado House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Colorado Senate|Senate]].

The House has 65 members and the Senate has 35. Currently, the House is controlled by the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] by a one vote majority and the Senate is controlled by the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. The 2005 Colorado General Assembly was the first to be controlled by the Democrats in forty years. The incumbent governor is Democrat [[John Hickenlooper]].

Most Coloradans are originally native to other states (nearly 60% according to the 2000 census),<ref>{{cite web

{{Main|Politics of Colorado}}

Colorado is considered a [[swing state]] in both state and federal elections. Coloradans have elected 17 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 12 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to the governorship in the last 100 years. In presidential politics, Colorado supported Democrats [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 and [[Barack Obama]] in 2008, and supported Republicans [[Bob Dole|Robert J. Dole]] in 1996 and [[George W. Bush]] in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]]. The presidential outcome in 2008 was the second closest to the national popular vote, after Virginia.<ref>{{cite web

Colorado politics has the contrast of conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and liberal cities such as Boulder. Democrats are strongest in [[Denver Metropolitan Area|metropolitan Denver]], the college towns of [[Fort Collins, CO|Fort Collins]] and [[Boulder, CO|Boulder]], southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and a few western ski resort counties. The Republicans are strongest in the Eastern Plains, Colorado Springs, Greeley, and far Western Colorado near Grand Junction.
