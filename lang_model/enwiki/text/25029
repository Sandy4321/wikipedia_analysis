'''Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull''' {{IPA-is|<U+02C8>va<U+02B0>dna<U+02CC>j<U+0153><U+02D0>k<U+028F>tl<U+0325>|}} (meaning ''Glacier of Rivers''), also known as the '''Vatna Glacier''', is the largest and most voluminous [[glaciers of Iceland|Icelandic glacier]], and one of the largest in area in [[List of glaciers in Europe|Europe]]. It is located in the south-east of the island, covering more than 8 percent of the country.

==Size==
With an area of 8,100&nbsp;km<U+00B2>, Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull is the largest [[ice cap]] in Europe by volume (3,100&nbsp;km<U+00B3>) and the second largest (after [[Austfonna]] on [[Nordaustlandet]], Norway) in area (not counting the still larger [[Severny Island ice cap]] of [[Novaya Zemlya]], Russia, which may be regarded as located in the extreme northeast of Europe). On 7 June 2008, it became a part of the [[Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull National Park]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Vatnajokull National Park|url=http://www2.hi.is/page/www.hi.is/haskolasetur_hornafirdi/vatnajokull_nationalpark|work=H<U+00E1>sk<U+00F3>li <U+00CD>slands|publisher=hi.is|accessdate=9 July 2010}}</ref>

The average thickness of the ice is {{convert|400|m|abbr=on}}, with a maximum thickness of {{convert|1,000|m|abbr=on}}. [[Iceland]]'s highest peak, [[Hvannadalshn<U+00FA>kur]] ({{convert|2,109.6|m|abbr=on}}), is located in the southern periphery of Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull, near [[Skaftafell National Park]].

==Volcanoes==
Under the ice cap, as under many of the [[glacier]]s of Iceland, there are several [[List of volcanoes in Iceland|volcanoes]]. The volcanic lakes, [[Gr<U+00ED>msv<U+00F6>tn]] for example, were the sources of a large [[j<U+00F6>kulhlaup]] ([[glacial lake outburst flood]]) in 1996. There was also a considerable but short-time eruption of the volcano under these lakes at the beginning of November 2004. In May 21, 2011 a volcanic eruption started <U+00ED> Gr<U+00ED>msv<U+00F6>tn in Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull National Park at around 7 p.m. The plume reached as high as {{convert|20|km|mi}}.  During the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], numerous volcanic eruptions occurred under Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull, creating many [[subglacial eruption]]s.

==Sight line==
According to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' (''GWR''), Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull is supposedly the object of the world's longest [[sight line]], {{convert|550|km|abbr=on}} from [[Sl<U+00E6>ttaratindur]], the highest mountain in the [[Faroe Islands]]. ''GWR'' claims that "owing to the light bending effects of atmospheric refraction, Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull (2,109.6 m), Iceland, can sometimes be seen from the Faroe Islands, {{convert|340|mi}} away". This may be based on an alleged sighting by a British sailor in 1939. However, the record was shown impossible in mathematical and atmospheric detail by J.C. Ferranti.<ref>[http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/panoramas.html#longlines ''Longlines'' page at viewfinderpanoaramas.org by J.C. de Ferranti]</ref>

==In culture==
In 1950, a [[Douglas DC-4]] operated by the private airline [[Loftlei<U+00F0>ir]] crash-landed on the Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull glacier and never flew again. Its abandoned fuselage is visible in the 2007 film [[Heima]], a documentary about a tour performed by the band [[Sigur R<U+00F3>s]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dc3history.org/collisionsbombscrashes.html | title=COLLISIONS AND BOMBS! | work=dc3history.org | date=2010-04-12 | accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>

The glacier was used as the setting for the opening sequence (set in [[Siberia]]) of the 1985 [[James Bond]] film ''[[A View to a Kill]]'', in which Bond (played for the last time by [[Roger Moore]]) eliminated a host of armed villains before escaping in a submarine to [[Alaska]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090264/locations]</ref> Several other films, including another in the Bond franchise, have been filmed on or using [[J<U+00F6>kuls<U+00E1>rl<U+00F3>n]], the terminal lake of the Brei<U+00F0>amerkurj<U+00F6>kull outlet from Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull.

In November 2011, the glacier was used as a shooting location for the second season of the [[HBO]] fantasy TV series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Iceland filming location revealed|url=http://winter-is-coming.net/2011/10/iceland-filming-location-revealed/|accessdate=28 October 2011|newspaper=winter-is-coming.net|date=28 October 2011}}</ref>

==Outlet glaciers==
Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull has around 30 outlet glaciers flowing from the ice cap.  The Icelandic term for glacier is "j<U+00F6>kull", and so is the term for outlet glacier.  Given below is a list of outlet glaciers flowing from Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull, sorted by the four administrative territories of Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull National Park.<ref>{{cite web|title=General information map|url=http://www.vatnajokulsthjodgardur.is/media/skjol/Heildarkort_EN-12okt2011.jpg|publisher=Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull National Park|accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref>  This is not a complete list.
