==Institutional Football ==

Most football clubs in India are what are termed 'institutional' teams. That mean that they represent a company and the football club is merely a social aspect of the company for the benefit of workers. This is much the same model which was found in Japan before the introduction of the J-League. The positives are that the teams are usually well resourced with players earning decent money and the prospect of employment after their footballing days finish. On the negative side, teams only represent a few thousand workers rather than whole cities and thus do not gain broad support.

This is slowly changing with new teams such as Pune FC, New Delhi Heroes,Viva Kerala, Sporting Club-de-Goa and Mumbai FC building broad based club while retaining corporate ownership and support.
