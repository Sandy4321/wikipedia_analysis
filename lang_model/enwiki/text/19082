==Plot==
[[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] and [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]] take a train back to [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] after attending a [[Yale University|Yale]] football game. The train makes a brief stop because of a discarded [[couch]] on the tracks and a man named Larry comes up to the train and tries to hawk cheesy merchandise. He suddenly sees Mr. Burns, gasps and takes out an old picture of a man who looks similar and compares the two. Suddenly the train pulls away, leaving Larry behind. Meanwhile, the Simpson family head home after visiting a Cider Mill and see Larry hitchhiking. After much discussion, the family picks up the hitchhiker. Larry asks the Simpson family about Mr. Burns and they agree to take Larry to his house. In Springfield, Larry visits Mr. Burns' estate and reveals that he is Burns' son.

Mr. Burns is at first shocked, but after acknowledging the resemblance admits that Larry is the result of a one-night fling with the daughter of a former flame at a college reunion. At first, Mr. Burns is overjoyed to have a son and tried to shape Larry after himself. Burns takes Larry to fancy parties for the rich and tries to have him enrolled in Yale, but Larry keeps acting like an oaf and proves to be an embarrassment. Larry is put to work in Sector 7G at [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] alongside Homer and the two become fast friends. Larry invites Homer to dinner, and at dinner, Mr. Burns throws a fit due to Larry's boorishness and tells him that he wishes he had no son. Homer tries to convince Larry to fake a kidnapping so that Burns will admit that he loves his son, and although Larry is at first against the idea, he eventually decides to do it.

After going through with the plan, Larry moves into the Simpsons' basement. Homer calls Mr. Burns and says that he can have Larry back if he admits that he loves him. Marge eventually discovers the plan and convinces Homer and Larry to abandon their plot, but as they leave they are spotted by a news helicopter and are chased by reporters and police. 

The two are chased into a cinema where they climb out onto the marquee and have a brief standoff with the police. Larry gives a heartfelt speech and Mr. Burns forgives Homer and Larry for the hoax but explains he cannot be the father whom Larry needs. Larry says that's okay and announces that he has a wife and kids back home who are probably worrying about him (he told them that he was going out for [[coffee]] a week ago, and, apparently, still hasn't returned). Larry announces that they should have a party and the episode ends with the people of Springfield dancing outside the movie theater.<ref name=officialsite/><ref name="Simpsguide">{{cite book|last=Martyn |first=Warren|coauthors=Adrian Wood|title=I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Virgin Books|id=ISBN 0-7535-0495-2|pages=}}</ref><ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|id=ISBN 0-00063-8898-1|pages=p. 236}}</ref>

==Production==
[[Image:BBBReardon.png|left|200px|thumb|A caricature of director [[Jim Reardon]] seen behind Smithers and Burns. Reardon hates flying and thus a caricature of him is always placed in the background of scenes involving trains.<ref name="Reardon">{{cite video | people=Reardon, Jim|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Burns, Baby Burns"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>]]
[[Ian Maxtone-Graham]] wrote the episode and this was his first ''Simpsons'' writing credit, although he had served as a consultant on the show for several months.<ref name="Graham">{{cite video | people=Maxtone-Graham, Ian|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Burns, Baby Burns"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Maxtone-Graham had previously worked with [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] on a game show and the two had really wanted to bring him in as a ''Simpsons'' writer.<ref name="Weinstein">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Burns, Baby Burns"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The episode started out as a story about Mr. Burns and [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] both being stationed in Paris during [[World War II]] and falling in love with the same woman, who had a love child. Maxtone-Graham had wanted this episode to be about Burns having a child, which is where it went. The other episode idea eventually became "[[Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"|The Curse of the Flying Hellfish]]."<ref name="Weinstein"/> The episode opens with the family visiting [[John Swartzwelder|Mt. Swartzwelder]] Historic [[Cider]] Mill because the writers had wanted to do something involving [[autumn]] and a cider mill seemed like a good setting for that.<ref name="Weinstein"/>

The character from Yale that Mr. Burns briefly talks to is based on the fictional character Dink Stover from the book "Dink Stover at Yale."<ref name="Weinstein"/>

[[Rodney Dangerfield]] guest stars in this episode and was a huge favorite of many of the ''Simpsons'' writers.<ref name="Weinstein"/> Many of the jokes in the episode were specifically written to be "Dangerfield jokes," which were much tougher to write than the staff had originally thought.<ref name="Weinstein"/><ref name="Graham"/> Dangerfield had made several changes to his script and had left the script and a pen behind after recording his part. [[Josh Weinstein]] had kept the script and pen and considers them among his three most prized ''Simpsons'' possessions.<ref name="Weinstein"/> Designing Larry Burns was a challenge because the director had wanted him to look like Dangerfield but still have Burns' characteristics such as the pointed nose.<ref name="Reardon"/>

==Cultural references==
[[Image:BBBSnoopy.png|left|200px|thumb|Homer's Snoopy puzzle, designed with the head missing to avoid copyright laws.]]
After discovering that Larry Burns is also working in Sector 7G, Homer frantically cleans up and puts away an almost entirely assembled [[Jigsaw puzzle]] which has an image of [[Snoopy]] the dog lying on his doghouse. The puzzle is missing a piece over where Snoopy's head should be, which was intentionally drawn that way to avoid copyright laws.<ref name="Weinstein"/>

The episode contains several reference to the movie ''[[Caddyshack]]'', such as the scene where Larry tries to fit in with Mr. Burns' associates<ref name="Meyer">{{cite video | people=Meyer, George|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Burns, Baby Burns"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> and the ending street party which also parodies the way that several films end with a party and feature the song "[[Any Way You Want It]]" by [[Journey (band)|Journey]] which is also played in Caddyshack.<ref name="Weinstein"/> The episode ends at a movie theater, which is a reference a lot of famous criminals who were involved with theatres, such as [[John Dillinger]], [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] and [[John Wilkes Booth]].<ref name="Weinstein"/>

==Reception==
The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it "A fun episode, with Rodney Dangerfield putting a lot of pathos into Larry - and Homer's impassioned speech atop the cinema at the climax is one of his funniest moments."<ref name="bbc"/> The episode currently holds a score of 7.2/10 at the [[Internet Movie Database]]<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0701078/|title=Burns, Baby Burns|accessdate=2007-04-03|publisher=IMDB.com}}</ref> and a score of 8.1/10 at [[TV.com]].<ref name="TV">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/burns-baby-burns/episode/1442/summary.html?tag=ep_list;ep_title;3|title=Burns, Baby Burns|accessdate=2007-04-10|publisher=TV.com}}</ref>
