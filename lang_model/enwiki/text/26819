The '''Twenty-fifth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XXV''') to the [[United States Constitution]] deals with succession to the [[United States Presidency|Presidency]] and establishes procedures both for filling a vacancy in the office of the [[United States Vice President|Vice President]], as well as responding to Presidential disabilities. It supersedes the [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]] wording of [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Vacancy and Disability|Article II, Section 1, Clause 6]] of the Constitution, which does not explicitly state whether the Vice President becomes the President if the President died, resigned, was removed from office or was unable to discharge the Presidential powers.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.100megspop3.com/binugeorge/usa_constitution/p_succession.html USA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It was ratified in 1967.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/constamrat.html|title=Ratification of Constitutional Amendments|dateformat=mdy|accessdate=February 24 2007|last=Mount|first=Steve|year=2007|month=January}}</ref>

==Text==
{{quote|'''Section 1'''. In case of the removal of the [[President of the United States|President]] from office or of his death or resignation, the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] shall become President.

'''Section 2'''. Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.

'''Section 3'''. Whenever the President transmits to the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]] and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as [[Acting President of the United States|Acting President]].

'''Section 4'''. Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.

Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.}}

==Background==
[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Vacancy and Disability|Article II, Section 1, Clause 6]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states:{{quote|''In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.''}} That clause was unclear regarding Presidential succession or inability; it did not state who had the power to declare a President incapacitated.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Also, it did not provide a mechanism for filling a Vice Presidential vacancy prior to the next Presidential election. The vagueness of this clause caused difficulties many times before the Twenty-fifth Amendment's adoption:

*In 1841, President [[William Henry Harrison]] died in office. Vice President [[John Tyler]] asserted that he had succeeded to the office of President, as opposed to only obtaining its powers and duties. He also declined to acknowledge documents referring to him as "Acting President". Despite some strong calls against it, Tyler took the oath of office, becoming the tenth President. Tyler's claim was not formally challenged and so the precedent of full succession was established.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_John_Tyler.htm|title=John Tyler, Tenth Vice President (1841)|publisher=Senate.gov|accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref>

*There had been many occasions when a President was incapacitated. For example, following [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson's]] stroke no one officially assumed the Presidential powers and duties.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

*The office of Vice President had been vacant sixteen times due to the death or resignation of either the President or Vice President.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

All of these incidents made it evident that clearer guidelines were needed.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> There were two proposals for providing those guidelines:

===Keating-Kefauver proposal===
In 1963, Senator [[Kenneth Keating]] of [[New York]] proposed a Constitutional amendment which would have enabled the Congress to enact legislation providing for how to determine when a President is disabled, rather than, as the Twenty-fifth Amendment does, having the Constitution so provide.<ref>''One Heartbeat Away'' by Birch Bayh (1968), p. 345</ref> This proposal was based upon a recommendation of the [[American Bar Association]] in 1960.<ref>''One Heartbeat Away'' by Birch Bayh (1968), p. 27</ref>

The text of the amendment reads:<ref>''One Heartbeat Away'' by Birch Bayh (1968), p. 350</ref>{{quote|''In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the said office shall devolve on the Vice President. In case of the inability of the President to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the said powers and duties shall devolve on the Vice President, until the inability be removed. The Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what officer shall then be President, or, in case of inability, act as President, and such officer shall be or act as President accordingly, until a President shall be elected or, in case of inability, until the inability shall be earlier removed. The commencement and termination of any inability shall be determined by such method as Congress shall by law provide.''}} In the Senate, concerns were raised that the Congress could either abuse such authority<ref>''One Heartbeat Away'' by Birch Bayh (1968), p. 30</ref> or neglect to enact any such legislation after the adoption of this proposal.<ref>''One Heartbeat Away'' by Birch Bayh (1968), pp. 34 and 35</ref> [[Tennessee]] Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] (the Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee's]] Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments), a long-time advocate for addressing the disability question, spearheaded the effort until he died because of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on August 10, 1963.<ref>''One Heartbeat Away'' by Birch Bayh (1968), p. 28</ref><ref>[http://www.capitalareateamsports.com/amendment25/invocations.html Amendment25.com - Proposal & Ratification]</ref>

===Bayh-Celler proposal===
On January 6, 1965, Senator [[Birch Bayh]] (Kefauver's successor as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments) proposed in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and Representative [[Emanuel Celler]] (Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]]) proposed in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] what would become the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Their proposal specified the process by which a President could be declared disabled, thereby making the Vice President an [[Acting President of the United States|Acting President]], and by which he could regain the powers of that office. Also, their proposal provided a way to fill a vacancy in the office of Vice President before the next presidential election. This was as opposed to the Keating-Kefauver proposal, which did not provide for filling a vacancy in the office of Vice President prior to the next presidential election or itself provide a process for determining presidential disability. In 1964, the American Bar Association endorsed the type of proposal which Bayh and Celler advocated.<ref>''One Heartbeat Away'' by Birch Bayh (1968), pp. 348-350</ref>

On February 19, the Senate passed the amendment, but the House passed a different version of the amendment on April 13. On July 6, after a conference committee ironed out differences between the versions,<ref>[http://www.amendment25.com/conferencereport.html Amendment25.com - Conference Committee Report on Senate/House Joint Resolution 1 (1965)]</ref> the final version of the amendment was passed by both Houses of the Congress and presented to the states for ratification.<ref>''One Heartbeat Away'' by Birch Bayh (1968), pp. 354-358</ref>

On February 23, 1967, in a ceremony in the East Room of the [[White House]], [[General Services Administration|General Services Administrator]] Lawson Knott certified the amendment's adoption.

==Effect==
===Section 1: Presidential succession===
Section 1 resolved any [[ambiguity]] regarding what the Constitution requires when a [[President of the United States|President]] is removed from office, dies or resigns. In any of those situations, the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] immediately becomes President.

===Section 2: Vice Presidential vacancy===
The Constitution did not provide for Vice Presidential vacancies until the Twenty-fifth Amendment was adopted. The Vice Presidency has been vacant several times due to death, resignation, or succession to the Presidency. Often these vacancies lasted for many years. 

Under Section 2, whenever there is a vacancy in the office of Vice President, the President nominates a successor, who becomes Vice President if confirmed by a majority vote of both Houses of the [[United States Congress|Congress]].

===Section 3: Presidential declaration===
Section 3 provides that when the President transmits a written declaration to the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]] and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], stating that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the Presidency, and until the President sends another written declaration to the aforementioned officers declaring himself able to resume discharging those powers and duties, the Vice President serves as Acting President.

===Section 4: Vice Presidential-Cabinet declaration===
Section 4 is the only part of the amendment never to have been invoked.<ref>[http://www.capitalareateamsports.com/amendment25/invocations.html Amendment25.com - Historical Invocations]</ref> It allows the Vice President, together with a majority of either "the principal officers of the executive departments" (i.e., the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]) or of "such other body as Congress may by law provide", can declare the President disabled. As with Section 3, the Vice President would become Acting President.

Section 4 exists to be invoked if an incapacitation of the President results in both the inability of the President to discharge the duties of his office and the inability of the President to provide a written declaration to that effect. The President may resume exercising the Presidential duties by sending a written declaration to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House. 

Should the Vice President and Cabinet remain unsatisfied with the President's condition, they may within four days of the President's declaration submit another declaration that the President is incapacitated. The Congress must assemble within 48 hours if not in session, and within 21 days it must pronounce its decision. A two-thirds vote of each House of Congress is required to affirm the President as unfit. Upon this finding by the Congress that the Vice President will "continue" to discharge the Presidential duties, implying the Vice President remains Acting President while Congress deliberates.

Should the Congress resolve the issue in favor of the President, or if the Congress makes no decision within the 21 days allotted, then the President resumes discharging all of the powers and duties of his office. Conversely, should the Congress uphold the finding of incapacity, the Vice President would remain Acting President.<ref>The Vice President would not be President of the Senate while being Acting President (see [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: President Pro Tempore and Other Officers|Article I, Section 3, Clause 5 of the Constitution]])</ref> The President would remain in office, albeit stripped of all Presidential powers and duties. However, the President may again submit a written declaration of recovery to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House. That declaration could be responded to by the Acting President and the Cabinet in the same way as stated earlier. The allotted 21-day Congressional procedure would start again.

While Section 4 specifies that the Vice President must be involved in the decision, Section 4 allows the Congress to choose a body other than the Cabinet to decide upon Presidential incapacity. That "other body" would replace the Cabinet for the purpose of this Section.

==Invocations==
The Twenty-fifth Amendment has been invoked six times since its ratification.

===Appointment of Gerald Ford as Vice President (1973)===
On October 12, 1973, following [[Spiro Agnew]]'s resignation two days earlier, President [[Richard Nixon]] nominated long-time Representative [[Gerald Ford]] of [[Michigan]] to succeed Agnew as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]].

The United States Senate voted 92<U+2013>3 to confirm Ford on November 27 and, on December 6, the House of Representatives did the same by a vote of 387<U+2013>35. Ford was sworn in later that day before a [[joint session of the United States Congress]].<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/grf/timeline.asp Gerald R Ford Presidential Library.]</ref>

===Succession of Gerald Ford to Presidency (1974)===
[[File:Letter of Resignation of Richard M. Nixon, 1974.jpg|thumb|right|Nixon's resignation letter, August 9, 1974.]]
President [[Richard Nixon]] resigned on August 9, 1974. In accordance with section one, which formalized the [[John Tyler|Tyler]] precedent, Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] succeeded to the office of President. This made [[Gerald Ford]] the only person ever to be Vice President, and later President, without being elected to either office.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment25/ FindLaw: U.S. Constitution: Twenty-Fifth Amendment<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://hnn.us/articles/902.html Presidency: What the 25th Amendment Overlooks<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Appointment of Nelson Rockefeller as Vice President (1974)===
By becoming President, Gerald Ford left the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidency]] vacant. On August 20, 1974, after having previously considered [[Melvin Laird]] and [[George H. W. Bush]], President Ford nominated former [[List of Governors of New York|New York Governor]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]] to succeed him as Vice President.

On December 10, 1974, Rockefeller was confirmed 90<U+2013>7 by the Senate. On December 19, 1974 Rockefeller was confirmed 287<U+2013>128 by the House and sworn into office.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

===Acting President George H. W. Bush (1985)===
{{main|Acting President of the United States#Confusion regarding Reagan invocation}}
On July 12, 1985, President [[Ronald Reagan]] underwent a colonoscopy, during which a pre-[[cancer]]ous lesion called a villous [[adenoma]] was discovered. Upon being told by his physician (Dr. Edward Cattow) that he could undergo [[surgery]] immediately or in two to three weeks, Reagan elected to have it removed immediately.

That afternoon, Reagan consulted with White House counsel [[Fred Fielding]] by telephone, debating whether to invoke the amendment and, if so, whether such a transfer would set an undesirable precedent. Fielding and [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Donald Regan]] both recommended that Reagan transfer power and two letters doing so were drafted: the first specifically referencing Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the second not.

At 10:32 a.m. on July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and ordered its delivery to the appropriate officers as required under the amendment.

Books such as ''The President Has Been Shot: Confusion, Disability and the 25th Amendment'', by Herbert Abrams, and Reagan's autobiography, ''An American Life'', argue Reagan's intent to transfer power to Bush was clear. Fielding himself adds:{{quote|I personally know he did intend to invoke the amendment, and he conveyed that to all of his staff and it was conveyed to the VP as well as the President of the Senate. He was also very firm in his wish not to create a precedent binding his successor.}}

===Acting President Dick Cheney===
{{see|Acting President of the United States#Invocations of 25th Amendment}}
====2002====
On June 29, 2002, President [[George W. Bush]] underwent a [[colonoscopy]] and chose to invoke the Amendment, temporarily transferring his powers to Vice President [[Richard Bruce Cheney|Cheney]].

The procedure began at 7:09 a.m EDT and ended at 7:29 a.m. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, but did not resume his presidential powers & duties until 9:24 a.m. EDT after the president's doctor, [[Richard Tubb]], conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional time to make sure the sedative had no after effects.

Unlike [[Reagan transfer of power|Reagan's 1985 letter]], Bush's 2002 letter specifically cited Section 3 of the Amendment in his [[Acting President of the United States#Invocations of 25th Amendment|letter transferring power]].

====2007====
On July 21, 2007, President George W. Bush again underwent a colonoscopy and chose to invoke the Amendment, temporarily transferring his powers to Vice President Cheney. President Bush invoked Section 3 of the Amendment at 7:16 a.m. EDT. He reclaimed his powers, pursuant to Section 3, at 9:21 a.m. EDT. As happened in 2002, Bush specifically cited Section 3 of the Amendment when he transferred the Presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers.

==Considered invocations==
There are two documented instances in which invocation of Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment was considered.

===1981: Reagan assassination attempt===
Following the [[Reagan assassination attempt|assassination attempt]] on President [[Ronald Reagan]] on March 30, 1981, a number of cabinet officials suggested that Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] assume the role of [[Acting President of the United States|Acting President]] under Section 4 of the amendment. However, Bush was opposed to the idea, in part because he did not wish to be seen as leading a [[de facto]] ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]''.<ref>HBO: The Day Reagan Was Shot, 2001</ref>

In 1995, [[Birch Bayh]], the primary sponsor of the amendment in the Senate, said that Section 4 should have been invoked.<ref>Birch Bayh, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4DB1631F93BA35757C0A963958260 "The White House Safety Net"], ''The New York Times'', April 8, 1995</ref>

===1987: Reagan incapacity===
Upon assuming the role of [[White House Chief of Staff]] in 1987, [[Howard Baker]] was advised by his predecessor's staff to be prepared for a possible invocation of the Twenty fifth Amendment due to Reagan's perceived laziness and ineptitude.

According to [[PBS]]'s ''[[American Experience]]'' program recalling the Reagan administration: "What Baker's transition team was told by [[Donald Regan]]'s staff that weekend shocked them. Reagan was 'inattentive, inept,' and 'lazy,' and Baker should be prepared to invoke the 25th Amendment to relieve him of his duties."
Reagan biographer [[Edmund Morris (writer)|Edmund Morris]] stated in an interview aired on the program,
:"The incoming Baker people all decided to have a meeting with him on Monday, their first official meeting with the President, and to cluster around the table in the Cabinet room and watch him very, very closely to see how he behaved, to see if he was indeed losing his mental grip."
Morris went on to explain
:"...Reagan who was, of course, completely unaware that they were launching a death watch on him, came in stimulated by the press of all these new people and performed splendidly. At the end of the meeting, they figuratively threw up their hands realizing he was in perfect command of himself."<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/video/reagan_26.html Ronald Reagan Video, Chapter 26 - Highs and Lows | The Presidents | American Experience | PBS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
