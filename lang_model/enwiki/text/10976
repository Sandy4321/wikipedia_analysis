'''James Henry Molyneaux, Baron Molyneaux of Killead''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] (born [[August 27]], [[1920]]) is a [[Northern Irish]] [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionist]] politician and was leader of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] from [[1979]] to [[1995]]. He was a leading member and sometime Vice-President of the [[Conservative Monday Club]].

Born in [[Killead]], [[County Antrim]], Molyneaux was educated at nearby Aldergrove School before serving in the [[Royal Air Force]] between [[1941]] and [[1946]]. During the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]], he served on Antrim County Council as well as a number of committees concerning local healthcare, and in [[1970]] was elected Ulster Unionist [[Member of Parliament]] for [[South Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|South Antrim]]. In October [[1974]], Molyneaux became leader of the Ulster Unionists in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], and between [[1982]] and [[1986]] he sat as an Ulster Unionist member for South Antrim in the failed Northern Ireland Assembly. He was admitted to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in [[1982]]. Following boundary changes that divided South Antrim, he became member for the new seat of [[Lagan Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Lagan Valley]] in [[1983]]. In [[1985]], he resigned his seat along with his Unionist colleagues in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in protest at the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], and was re-elected in the subsequent [[by-election]]. 

Throughout the 1980s he was an active MP member and Vice-President of the [[Conservative Monday Club]]. In the Club's newspaper, ''Right Ahead'', the October 1985 Conservative Party Conference issue, Molyneaux contributed a lengthy article entitled ''[[Northern Ireland]] - [[Ulster]] belongs to Britain NOT to the [[Irish Republic]]''. 

When the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] declared a [[ceasefire]] in 1994, Molyneaux was heard to utter "This (the ceasefire) is the worst thing that has ever happened to us". In [[1995]] he was [[Ulster Unionist Party leadership election, March 1995|challenged for the leadership of the Ulster Unionists]] by a 21 year old student and, although winning easily, saw a strong protest vote against his leadership registered. Following the Ulster Unionists' poor showing in the [[North Down by-election, 1995|1995 North Down by-election]], Molyneaux yielded to renewed pressure to retire as leader. On retiring as Ulster Unionist leader he was [[knighted]] as a [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] in [[1996]]. The following year, after standing down as an MP at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 General Election]], he was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Molyneaux of Killead'''.

On several occasions in his retirement he was publicly critical of his successor as leader, [[David Trimble]], and fiercely opposed the [[Belfast Agreement|Good Friday Agreement]]. In [[2003]] Molyneaux supported half the Ulster Unionist MPs - [[David Burnside]], [[Jeffrey Donaldson]] and [[Martin Smyth]] - when they resigned the party whip in protest against the leadership of Trimble and the continuing support for the Agreement. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] Molyneaux caused a storm when he and Smyth endorsed the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] candidate [[Jimmy Spratt]] over the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] candidate [[Michael McGimpsey]] in [[South Belfast (UK Parliament constituency)|South Belfast]], the seat Smyth was retiring from. Molyneaux also endorsed Donaldson, his successor as MP for Lagan Valley, even though Donaldson had now defected to the DUP. However he also endorsed some Ulster Unionists, most notably Burnside in South Antrim. In the election Donaldson held his seat for his new party by a large majority whilst Spratt outpolled McGimpsey (though losing to the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]] candidate [[Alasdair McDonnell]] on a split vote) and many asserted that Molyneaux and Smyth's endorsements had contributed to the UUP's disastrous showing. However Burnside lost his seat.
