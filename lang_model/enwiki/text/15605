The '''Nante de Drance Hydropower Plant''' is a [[pumped-storage]] power station currently being constructed in the in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Valais]] in Switzerland. It is withing the municipality of [[Finhaut]], district of [[Saint-Maurice (district)|Saint-Maurice]] and about {{Convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Martigny]]. Construction on the power plant began in 2008 and it should begin operations in 2018. It is owned by Nant de Drance SA, a consortium of [[Alpiq]] (39%), [[Swiss Federal Railways|SBB]] (36%), Industrielle Werke Basel (IWB) (15%) and Forces 
Motrices Valaisannes (FMV) (10%). When complete, the US$1.9 billion plant it will have an installed capacity of 900 MW.<ref name=business>{{cite web|title=Projet Initi<U+00E9> Par Alpiq, CFF, IWB ET FMV|url=http://www.nant-de-drance.ch/plus/|publisher=Nant de Drance SA|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=French}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=De Clercq|first1=Geert|title=RPT-Cavernous Swiss power plant undermined by renewable energy|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/01/utilities-swiss-pumpedstorage-idUSL5N0QZ58820140901|accessdate=11 January 2015|agency=Reuters|date=1 September 2014}}</ref>

==Background==
[[Image:Lac du Vieux Emosson.jpg|thumb|left|Lac du Vieux Emosson will be raised and form the upper reservoir]]
On 25 August 2008, the Swiss [[Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications]] granted a building permit to Nate de Drance SA for the construction of the plant with a 600 MW design. Preliminary construction began in September 2008 but a concession was granted in April 2011 which allowed for a larger 900 MW plant. Excavation of the tunnels began in 2009 and the caverns commenced in 2010.<ref name=construction>{{cite web|title=A New Pumped Storage Plant|url=http://www.nant-de-drance.ch/projet/generalites/|publisher=Nante de Drance SA|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=French}}</ref> Raising of the upper Vieux Emosson began in Spring 2013 and should be done by the end of 2015. The [[underground power station|underground power house]] excavation was complete in April 2014.<ref name=alpiq>{{cite web|title=Nant de Drance|url=http://www.alpiq.com/what-we-offer/our-assets/hydropower/hydropower-plant-projects/nant-de-drance.jsp|publisher=Alpiq|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> The first generators should be tested in 2017 with all six commissioned between 2018 and 2020.<ref name=construction/>

In December 2014, at the International Tunnelling & Underground Space Awards, the project was awarded the Major Tunnelling Project of the Year award in the category of projects over US$500 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nant de Drance project wins at the International Tunnelling & Underground Space Awards 2014|url=http://www.bg-21.com/en/content/nant-de-drance-project-wins-international-tunnelling-underground-space-awards-2014|publisher=BG Group|accessdate=11 January 2015|date=11 December 2014}}</ref>

==Design==
[[Image:Karte_Lac_du_Vieux_Emosson.png|thumb|left|The plant will be located between the upper and lower reservoirs]]
The power plant will use two existing reservoirs to operate. The lower reservoir, [[Lac d'Emosson]], is formed by a {{Convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, {{Convert|555|m|ft|abbr=on}} long [[arch dam]] which was completed in 1974. It withholds a reservoir with a storage capacity of {{Convert|227000000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} and surface area of {{Convert|327|ha|acre|abbr=on}}. The lower reservoir is {{Convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and when full, lies {{Convert|1930|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The upper reservoir for the plant, [[Lac du Vieux Emosson]], is formed by a {{Convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{Convert|170|m|ft|abbr=on}} long arch dam originally completed in 1955. The dam is undergoing a raising and will be {{Convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. When raised, Lac du Vieux Emosson storage capacity will be doubled and withhold {{Convert|25000000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} and have a surface area of {{Convert|55|ha|acre|abbr=on}}. When full, it will lie {{Convert|2225|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.<ref name=design>{{cite web|title=The Heart of the Mountain|url=http://www.nant-de-drance.ch/projet/comment-ca-marche/|publisher=Nant de Drance SA|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=French}}</ref> 

The power plant will lie in-between both reservoir and use the [[pumped-storage]] hydroelectric method. To accomplish this, when energy demand is high, water will be release from the upper reservoir, down a series of {{Convert|425|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[penstock]]s to the nine 150 MW reversible [[Francis turbine]]-generators in the power plant.<ref name=design/> The large underground power house measures {{Convert|194|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{Convert|52|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{Convert|32|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name=alpiq/> After generating power, water from the power plant will we discharged to the lower reservoir. When power demand is low, such as at night, the turbines will reverse and water can be pumped back up to the upper reservoir for use during high demand periods. As such, it will serve a [[peaking power plant]].<ref name=design/>
