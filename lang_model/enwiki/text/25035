It was released by Irish indie label [[FIFA Records]] in May 2007<ref name="fighting talk"/> and sold out, generating a significant amount of media interest in the process.<ref name="Other Voices">{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/othervoices/fightlikeapes.html|title=Fight Like Apes|accessdate=2009-06-08|publisher=''[[Other Voices (TV series)|Other Voices]]''}}</ref><ref name="1st prize for imaginative EP title goes to<U+2026>">{{cite web|url=http://www.munster-express.ie/front-page-news/general-stories/1st-prize-for-imaginative-ep-title-goes-to/|title=1st prize for imaginative EP title goes to<U+2026>|date=2007-10-23|accessdate=2009-06-08|publisher=''[[The Munster Express]]''}}</ref> Three of the four tracks from this EP were reworked for ''[[Fight Like Apes and the Mystery of the Golden Medallion]]'', the band's debut album.

Despite the band having not released an album by this time, Dublin's journalists praised Fight Like Apes after hearing the EP.<ref name="fighting talk">{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2009/02/08/story39252.asp|title=fighting talk|date=2009-02-02|accessdate=2009-06-08|publisher=''[[The Sunday Business Post]]''}}</ref> The band played both [[Electric Picnic]], which was their first major Irish festival,<ref name="Manic <U+2018>Easter<U+2019> Monday">{{cite web|url=http://www.munster-express.ie/entertainment/music/manic-%e2%80%98easter-monday/|title=Manic <U+2018>Easter<U+2019> Monday|date=2008-03-19|accessdate=2009-06-08|publisher=''[[The Munster Express]]''}}</ref> and [[Hard Working Class Heroes]] in 2007 on the back of the release of ''How Am I Supposed to Kill You If You Have All the Guns?''<ref name="No monkey business with Fight Like Apes">{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickindependent.com/entertainment/entertainment/no-monkey-business-with-fight-like-apes/|title=No monkey business with Fight Like Apes|date=2007-10-31|accessdate=2009-06-08|publisher=''[[Limerick Independent]]''}}</ref><ref name="Manic <U+2018>Easter<U+2019> Monday"/><ref name="Other Voices"/> They also performed at the [[CMJ Music Marathon]] in [[New York]].<ref name="Manic <U+2018>Easter<U+2019> Monday"/><ref name="Other Voices"/>

The parents of the band's main songwriter Pockets were reported to have been "horrified" when they first heard the EP, labelling the efforts of him and his bandmates as "disgusting".<ref name="fighting talk"/> They were said to be displeased with the "electric shocks, digital distortion, blisteringly brutal lyrics and the screechy vocals" of vocalist [[MayKay]].<ref name="fighting talk"/>

== Reception ==
''How Am I Supposed to Kill When You've Got All the Guns?'' was critically acclaimed in Ireland.<ref name="monkey business"/> "Lend Me Your Face" was played regularly on alternative radio shows and is viewed as an anthem at all their Irish shows.<ref name="monkey business">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/monkey-business-1209605.html|title=monkey business|date=2007-11-02|accessdate=2009-06-08|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref>

''[[Hot Press]]'' described ''How Am I Supposed to Kill You If You Have All the Guns?'' as "a serious achievement" and "a kaleidoscope of different ideas that somehow manages to hang together and forge its own identity".<ref name="Fight Like Apes - How Am I Supposed to Kill You If You Have All the Guns? (Hot Press)"/> The magazine declared three of the four songs suitable for daytime radio if the occasional expletive was ignored.<ref name="Fight Like Apes - How Am I Supposed to Kill You If You Have All the Guns?

[[entertainment.ie]] gave the EP four out of five stars, declaring it "an absolute sucker-punch of a debut release".<ref name="Fight Like Apes - How Am I Supposed to Kill You If You Have All the Guns? (entertainment.ie)"/> They described lead track "Jake Summers" as "a dizzy punk-synth explosion" and last track "Battlestations" as "a twisted, haphazard synthfest that sounds like a modern take on an '80s video nasty compilation".<ref name="Fight Like Apes - How Am I Supposed to Kill You If You Have All the Guns? (entertainment.ie)"/> Most praise was, however, reserved for "Lend Me Your Face", described as "a razor-sharp peal of punk thunder".<ref name="Fight Like Apes - How Am I Supposed to Kill You If You Have All the Guns? (entertainment.ie)">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.ie/album-review/Fight-Like-Apes---How-Am-I-Supposed-to-Kill-You-If-You-Have-All-the-Guns?/5030.htm|title=Fight Like Apes - How Am I Supposed to Kill You If You Have All the Guns?|date=2007-06-08|accessdate=2009-06-13|publisher=[[entertainment.ie]]}}</ref>

"Jake Summers" later received a UK release as a 7" vinyl through the Cool For Cats label.<ref name="Other Voices"/> The song was inspired by a character from the TV series ''[[California Dreams]]'', who the band thought was a "fucking disappointment to the human race".<ref name="Fight Like Apes David Carradine Is A Bounty Hunter...
