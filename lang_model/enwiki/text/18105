'''Steven Lawrence Rattner''' (born July 5, 1952) is an American [[financier]] who served as lead adviser to the [[Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry|Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry in 2009]] for the [[Obama administration]].<ref name="NYT0127">[http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/rattner-to-serve-as-lead-adviser-on-auto-bailout/?hp "Rattner to Serve as Lead Adviser on Auto Bailout"] by Michael J. de la Merced and [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]], ''The New York Times'' "DealBook", Feb. 23, 2009.</ref> He was a managing principal of the [[Quadrangle Group]], a [[Private equity firm|private equity investment firm]] that specialized in the [[Media industry|media and communications]] industries. Prior to co-founding Quadrangle, he was an [[investment banker]] at [[Lehman Brothers]], [[Morgan Stanley]], and [[Lazard Freres|Lazard Freres & Co.]], where he rose to deputy chairman and deputy chief executive officer.<ref name="NYT0523">[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/23/business/lazard-names-new-top-team-post-rohatyn.html?ref=stevenrattner "Lazard Names New Top Team Post-Rohatyn"] by Peter Truell, ''The New York Times'', May 23, 1997.</ref> Rattner began his career as a [[journalist]] for ''[[The New York Times]].''

Rattner is chairman of Willett Advisors LLC, the private investment group that manages billionaire New York Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]'s personal and philanthropic assets. He continues to be involved in public policy matters as the economic analyst for MSNBC's ''[[Morning Joe]]'', and he has returned to ''The New York Times'' as a contributing writer for its Op-Ed page.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[New York City]], Rattner was raised in the suburb of [[Great Neck]], where he attended local public schools. He received his A.B. with honors in economics from [[Brown University]] in 1974 and was awarded the Harvey Baker Fellowship. While at Brown, he served as editor-in-chief of ''[[The Brown Daily Herald]]'' in 1973.

==Journalism career==
Upon graduating from Brown, Rattner was hired in Washington D.C. as a news clerk to legendary ''New York Times'' columnist [[James Reston]]. After a year, he moved to New York as a reporter to cover business, energy, and urban affairs, becoming friends with colleague [[Paul Goldberger]]. In 1977, he was sent back to Washington to cover the [[1970s energy crisis|energy crisis]]. At the unusually young age of 27, he became the paper's chief Washington economic correspondent, where he became close friends with future ''Times'' publisher [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]], and dated [[Judith Miller]]. He concluded his service to ''The New York Times'' with a two-year stint in London as its European economic correspondent.<ref name="TimeArticle">[http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1892461,00.html "2-Min. Bio: Obama Car Guru Steve Rattner"] by Kate Pickert, ''Time'', Apr. 20, 2009.</ref>

==Investment banking career==
At the end of 1982, Rattner left ''The New York Times'' and was recruited by [[Roger Altman]] to join the investment bank [[Lehman Brothers]] as an associate. After Lehman was sold to [[American Express]] in 1984, he followed his boss [[Eric Gleacher]] and several colleagues to [[Morgan Stanley]], where he founded the firm's communications group. In 1989, after Morgan Stanley filed for an [[initial public offering]], he joined Lazard as a general partner and completed various deals for large media conglomerates such as [[Viacom]] and [[Comcast]]. Alongside [[Felix Rohatyn]], Rattner became Lazard's top [[Rainmaker (business)|rainmaker]] in the 1990s. [[Michel David-Weill]] named him the firm's Deputy Chairman and Deputy Chief Executive in 1997.<ref name="NYT0523" />

==Private equity career==
In March 2000, Rattner and three Lazard partners including [[Joshua Steiner]] left the firm and founded the [[Quadrangle Group]], which initially focused on investing a $1 billion media-focused [[private equity fund]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/01/business/4-top-lazard-freres-bankers-are-quitting-to-open-firm.html "4 Top Lazard Freres Bankers Are Quitting to Open Firm"] by Patrick McGeehan, ''The New York Times'', March 01, 2001.</ref> Early investors in Quadrangle included Sulzberger, [[Mort Zuckerman]], and [[Merrill Lynch]]. Headquartered in the [[Seagram Building]], Quadrangle grew to manage more than $6 billion across several business lines, including [[private equity]], [[distressed securities]], and [[hedge fund]]s. The firm also hosted an annual gathering for media executives called Foursquare, where speakers included [[Rupert Murdoch]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. In 2008, the firm's asset management division announced it had been selected to invest the personal assets of Rattner's close friend, the billionaire New York Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].<ref name="NYT0108">[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/nyregion/16conflict.html "Bloomberg Chooses a Friend to Manage His Fortune"] by [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]], ''The New York Times'', Jan. 16. 2008. Retrieved 2-23-09.</ref>

Throughout his business career, Rattner served on several corporate boards including [[Cablevision]], [[IAC/InterActiveCorp]], and [[Protection One]].

==Public service==
From his tenure with ''The New York Times'' in Washington D.C., Rattner developed a lifelong interest in economic policy, which drew him to politics and public service. In the mid-1990s, he began to work actively on behalf of Democratic candidates, beginning with President [[Bill Clinton]]. While it was rumored that Rattner would join a Democratic administration, he did not do so until after the election of President [[Barack Obama]].<ref name="NYT0108" />

In February 2009, with [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]] insolvent, Rattner was appointed counselor and lead auto adviser to the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], a [[List of U.S. executive branch czars|role informally referred to in the media as the "car czar"]]. He soon assembled a team that grew to 14 professionals to address the financial problems of the two auto companies.<ref name="NYT0127" />

Reporting to both Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] and [[Lawrence Summers]], the head of the [[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council]], Rattner's team developed a plan to save both the two manufacturers and related suppliers and finance companies. The plan involved a total government (i.e., taxpayer) investment of $82 billion in the sector, coupled with controlled bankruptcies for the two auto companies, as well as new management for both, and the closure of 2,000 automobile dealerships and loss of tens of thousands of related jobs.<ref name="SGSB">{{cite web|last=Shao|first=Maria|title=The 2009 U.S. Auto Bailout Was Necessary, Argues Rattner|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/knowledgebase/cgi-bin/2011/03/16/the-2009-u-s-auto-bailout-was-necessary-argues-rattner/|work=Stanford Knowledgebase|publisher=Stanford Graduate School of Business|accessdate=2 May 2011}}</ref><ref name="WAPO120906"> [http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/auto-bailout-was-not-unmitigated-success/2012/09/06/4edae4bc-f854-11e1-8398-0327ab83ab91_story.html "Auto bailout was not unmitigated success"] by Zachary Goldfarb, "The Washington Post" September 6, 2012.</ref> Controversially, during the negoitations with the bond holders, Rattner threatened their professional reputations in order to get them on board with the controlled bankruptcies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2009/05/nontarp.html |title=White & Case's Tom Lauria Reflects on Non-TARP Lenders Crazy Chrysler Week |publisher=Amlawdaily.typepad.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref>

Rattner later stated that the toughest decision for President Obama about the two auto companies was whether to save Chrysler. There was, however, no disagreement about asking GM CEO&nbsp;[[Richard Wagoner]]&nbsp;to step aside.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rattner|first=Steven|title=Overhaul: An Insider's Account of the Obama Administration's Emergency Rescue of the Auto Industry|year=2010|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-44321-8}}</ref>

By July 2009, both automakers had emerged from bankruptcy, had new management and were on their way to profitability.<ref name="SGSB" /> At that time, Rattner left Washington and returned to private life in New York.

==Post-political career==
After leaving the government, Rattner wrote ''Overhaul: An Insider's Account of the Obama Administration's Emergency Auto Rescue'', his ''New York Times'' best-selling account of the [[automotive industry crisis of 2008-2010]]. 

He has continued to speak publicly on auto-related matters as well as broader economic issues. Early in 2011, he began contributing a monthly column to the Financial Times on subjects ranging from the Greek crisis to the U.S. budget deficit. He also became the economic analyst for the [[MSNBC]] news show, ''[[Morning Joe]]''.<ref name="FT">[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/548aabe2-2405-11e0-bef0-00144feab49a.html#axzz1LDRH5YoW "The great man theory of business"] by Steven Rattner, ''The Financial Times'', Jan. 19, 2011.</ref><ref name="MSNBC">[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35670112?q=Steven%20Rattner ''Steven Rattner on MSNBC.com'']</ref> And in June 2011, he was named a contributing writer to The New York Times Op-Ed page, publishing his first column on how government policies drive up corn prices.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/25/opinion/25Rattner.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Rattner | title=Ethanol Production Wastes Corn | date=June 24, 2011}}</ref>

==New York pension fund investigation==
In 2005, Quadrangle made payments to [[private placement agent]] Hank Morris to help Quadrangle raise money for its second buyout fund.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/business/22quadrangle.html | work=The New York Times | first=Louise | last=Story | title=Quadrangle Facing Questions Over Pension Funds | date=April 22, 2009}}</ref> Morris had come highly recommended to Rattner from U.S. Senator  [[Charles Schumer]].<ref>http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/11303</ref> Morris was also the chief political advisor to [[Alan Hevesi]], the [[New York State Comptroller]] and manager of the New York State Common Retirement Fund (CRF), which invests in many [[private equity fund]]s. Morris told Rattner he could increase the size of the CRF investment in Quadrangle's second buyout fund. Rattner agreed to pay Morris a [[Private placement|placement fee]] of 1.1% of any investments greater than $25 million from the CRF.<ref>[http://www.ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/press-releases/archived/QUADRANGLE%20AOD.pdf "Findings of the Attorney General<U+FFFD>s Investigation"] by NYAG, ''NYAG Website'',  April 15, 2010,</ref>

In 2009, Quadrangle and a dozen other investment firms, including the [[Carlyle Group]], were investigated by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] for their hiring of Morris. The SEC viewed the payments as "kickbacks" in order to receive investments from the CRF since Morris was also a consultant to Hevesi.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/business/22quadrangle.html | work=The New York Times | first=Louise | last=Story | title=Quadrangle Facing Questions Over Pension Funds | date=April 22, 2009}}</ref> Quadrangle paid $7 million in April 2010 to settle the SEC investigation, and Rattner personally settled in November for $6.2 million without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-18/sec-sues-steven-rattner-in-new-york-for-kickbacks-with-politcal-consultant.html "SEC Settles With Steven Rattner Over Kickbacks; Cuomo Files New Lawsuits"] by Joshua Gallu, Karen Freifeld and Bob Van Voris, ''Bloomberg'', Nov 18, 2010,</ref>

==Prosecution by Attorney General Cuomo==
The case drew significant media attention when [[Andrew Cuomo]], the [[New York State Attorney General]], demanded more severe penalties from Rattner than any of the other firms or individuals who had hired Morris as a placement agent.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/business/14rattner.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Louise | last1=Story | first2=Peter | last2=Lattman | title=Steven Rattner Is Said to Settle Pension Case | date=October 13, 2010}}</ref> Rattner was once a major fundraiser for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidates including [[Al Gore]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], but Rattner had repeatedly passed on fundraising for Cuomo despite Cuomo's past attempts to cultivate Rattner's support.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/nyregion/08rattner.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Louise | last1=Story | first2=Michael | last2=Barbaro | title=Cuomo Pension Inquiry on Steven Rattner Grows Nasty | date=December 7, 2010}}</ref>

In an appearance on the ''[[Charlie Rose Show]]'', Rattner asserted that hiring Morris as a placement agent was "legal then, legal now, and done properly."<ref>http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/11303</ref> He explained he was willing to settle on reasonable terms as he had done with the SEC, but questioned whether Cuomo was motivated by the "facts" of the case and called Cuomo's demands "close to extortion."<ref>http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/11303</ref>

On December 30, 2010, Rattner reached a settlement with Cuomo to pay $10 million in restitution but no fines or penalties. He was not prohibited from continuing to protest his innocence.<ref name="NYT1210">[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/rattner-settles-with-cuomo/ "Rattner to Pay $10 Million in Settlement With Cuomo"] by Peter Lattman, ''The New York Times'' "Deal Book", Dec. 30, 2010.</ref>

Rattner is also member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]<ref>http://newamerica.net/user/450</ref> and was an early investor in [[Current TV]], the liberal-leaning network founded by [[Al Gore]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}
