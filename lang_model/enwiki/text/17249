'''State Route 134''', a segment of the [[Ventura Freeway]], runs from its junction with [[U.S. Route 101 (California)|U.S. Route 101]] and [[State Route 170 (California)|State Route 170]] in [[North Hollywood]] (the [[Hollywood split|Hollywood Split]]) to its junction with [[Interstate 210 (California)|Interstate 210]] and a stub of future [[Interstate 710 (California)|Interstate 710]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]].

This route is part of the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]]<ref name="cafes">[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=shc&group=00001-01000&file=250-257 CA Codes (shc:250-257)]</ref>.

The road is the main connector from the [[San Fernando Valley]] and points north to the [[San Gabriel Valley]] and points east. Presently, future Interstate 710 dead-ends at California Blvd and is signed as [[State Route 710 (California)|State Route 710]]. Residents of [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]] have blocked efforts to extend [[Interstate 710 (California)|Interstate 710]] north to California Boulevard from its current end at Valley Boulevard north of [[Interstate 10 (California)|Interstate 10]] near the [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]]/[[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] city limit. Signs on SR 134 and I-210 refer to the SR 710 stub in Pasadena as <small>TO</small> [[State Route 110 (California)|State Route 110]], because exiting left from the Route 710 stub onto California Blvd and turning right on Arroyo Parkway will take you directly to SR 110, which is Pasadena's only direct freeway link to [[Downtown Los Angeles]].

The Interstate 5 offramp at Colorado St. is actually old SR 134, and there are still mileposts that refer to it as such. Old SR 134 followed Colorado St. through [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] and Colorado Boulevard in [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, California|Eagle Rock]] to the ramp connecting Colorado Boulevard and Figueroa Street to the Ventura Freeway.  Old SR 134 continued onto the ramp and then onto what is presently the Ventura Freeway to Orange Grove Boulevard in Pasadena.  The [[Colorado Boulevard]]/[[Figueroa Street]] ramps plus the segment of freeway between the ramps and just east of Orange Grove Boulevard were previously known as the '''Colorado Freeway'''.

==History==
The interchange of SR 134 and [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] is dedicated "[[Gene Autry]] Memorial Interchange." Autry's Museum of Western Heritage is located near the interchange in Griffith Park.

==Exit list==
:''Note: Except where prefixed with a letter, [[postmile]]s were measured in 1964, based on the alignment as it existed at that time, and do not necessarily reflect current mileage.''
The entire route is in [[Los Angeles County, CA|Los Angeles County]].
