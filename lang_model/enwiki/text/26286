The '''Missouri River''' is a major river of central [[North America]], and is a [[tributary]] of the [[Mississippi River]]. It is the longest river on the continent at over {{convert|2540|mi|km}} and the second largest tributary of the Mississippi by [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]], after the [[Ohio River]]. The [[drainage basin|watershed]] of the Missouri River drains nearly {{convert|530000|mi2|km2}} of the eastern [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Great Plains]], spanning parts of ten [[U.S. state]]s and two [[Canadian province]]s. Approximately 10 million people live in the drainage area, many concentrated in urban centers along the [[main stem]] such as [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Omaha, Nebraska]]; and [[Great Falls, Montana]]. Measured from its hydrologic source in the [[Centennial Mountains]] of southern [[Montana]] to the Mississippi's mouth at the [[Gulf of Mexico]], it forms part of the [[List of longest rivers|fourth-longest river system in the world]]. 

As early as 12,000 years ago, [[Paleo-Indians]] settled in the plains of the Missouri River basin.<ref name="archaeology">{{cite book

French, Spanish and American explorers wandered the region in the 18th and 19th centuries, during the time that the Missouri basin became part of [[France]]'s [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] territory. When France ceded Louisiana to the [[United States]], the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] traveled the river in search of a water route to the [[Pacific coast]] of North America. Settlers' expansion into the Great Plains pushed most of the Native Americans out of their traditional lands, leading to multiple wars. The Missouri River served as an unofficial boundary for the [[Frontier#American frontier|American frontier]] in the 19th century, and many prominent pioneer trails such as the [[Oregon Trail]] had their starting points on the river.

Although it once was, by far, the longest river of North America, today its length is comparable with the Mississippi River because of [[river engineering#Channelization|channelization]] of its waters to eliminate [[meander]]s and facilitate boat travel. The lower [[Missouri River Valley|Missouri valley]] has become a highly productive [[Agriculture|agricultural]] and [[Industry|industrial]] region. [[Barge]]s shipping [[gravel]], [[wheat]], [[fertilizer]], and other grown, mined or manufactured products provide much of the commerce on the river today. In response to the growing amount of water traffic, federal and state agencies including the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE) heavily [[dam]]med and channelized the river in the 20th century. Although this development has contributed to the economic growth of the region, it has taken a toll on the ecology and the water quality of the Missouri.

==Course==
The Missouri River rises in the [[Rocky Mountains]] of southwestern [[Montana]] at the confluence of the [[Jefferson River]] and [[Madison River]], in [[Missouri Headwaters State Park]] near the town of [[Three Forks, Montana|Three Forks]]. It flows north, passing through [[Canyon Ferry Lake]], west of the [[Big Belt Mountains]]. It exits from the mountains near [[Cascade, Montana|Cascade]], and flows northeast to the city of [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]], where it drops over the [[Great Falls of the Missouri]], a series of five substantial [[cataract]]s. The Missouri then flows east through canyons and [[badlands]], past the confluence with the [[Marias River]], widening into the [[Fort Peck Lake]] reservoir near the confluence of the [[Musselshell River]]. Farther on the river passes through the gates of the [[Fort Peck Dam]], and immediately after that, the [[Milk River (Montana-Alberta)|Milk River]] enters from the left.<ref name="topoquest">{{cite web

[[Image:FtLincoln-MissouriRiver.jpg|thumb|left|The Missouri River in the [[Great Plains]] south of [[Bismarck, North Dakota]]]]
It flows eastwards through the plains of [[eastern Montana]], receiving the [[Poplar River (Saskatchewan-Montana)|Poplar River]] at [[Poplar, Montana|Poplar]] before crossing into [[North Dakota]] where the [[Yellowstone River]], its greatest tributary, joins from the right. At the confluence, the two rivers are approximately the same size. The Missouri then meanders east past [[Williston, North Dakota|Williston]] and into [[Lake Sakakawea]], a reservoir formed by the [[Garrison Dam]], where the river turns south. South of [[Riverdale, North Dakota|Riverdale]], the [[Knife River]] enters from the right. The Missouri continues south to the city of [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]], the North Dakota state capital, where it receives the [[Heart River]]. It slows into the [[Lake Oahe]] reservoir just before the [[Cannonball River]] confluence. While it continues south, eventually reaching [[Oahe Dam]] in [[South Dakota]], the [[Grand River (South Dakota)|Grand]], [[Moreau River|Moreau]] and [[Cheyenne River]]s all join the Missouri from the right.<ref name="topoquest"/><ref name="ACMEmapper"/>

The Missouri makes a bend to the southeast as it meanders through the [[Great Plains]], receiving the [[Niobrara River]] from the right. The Missouri then proceeds to form the boundary of South Dakota and [[Nebraska]], then after it receives the [[James River (Dakotas)|James River]], forms the [[Iowa]]-Nebraska boundary. At [[Sioux City]] the [[Big Sioux River]] comes in from the left. The Missouri flows south to the big city of [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] where it receives one of its largest tributaries, the [[Platte River]]. Downstream of there, it begins to define the Nebraska-[[Missouri]] border, then flows between Missouri and [[Kansas]]. It turns east at [[Kansas City]], where the [[Kansas River]] enters from the right, and so on into north-central Missouri. The river passes south of [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] and receives the [[Osage River]], its last major tributary, downstream of [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]]. It then rounds the northern side of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to join the Mississippi River on the border between Missouri and [[Illinois]].<ref name="topoquest"/><ref name="ACMEmapper"/>

The Missouri River has hundreds of tributaries, with most of the larger ones coming in as the river draws close to the mouth. The largest by discharge are the Yellowstone, [[Osage River|Osage]], [[Kansas River|Kansas]] and Platte. On the other end of the scale is the tiny [[Roe River]] in Montana, which at {{convert|201|ft|m}} long is commonly held to be the world's shortest river.<ref>McFarlan and McWhirter, p. 32</ref> Tributaries of the Missouri River over {{convert|40|mi|km}} long<ref name="ACMEmapper"/> are listed going downstream also noting the state in which they enter.

===Flow===
<!-- [[Image:ConfluenceRubyBeaverheadRiver.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Beaverhead River]], part of the longest headwater stream of the Missouri, which goes by a number of different names. If the headwaters were included in the Missouri's length, it would become nearly {{convert|2600|mi|km}} long.]] -->
As the Missouri drains one of the more arid regions of the Great Plains, its discharge is much less than rivers of comparable size such as the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie]] or [[Yukon River|Yukon]]. The average flow of {{convert|86340|cuft/s|m3/s}}<ref name="missouriflow"/> divided by the size of the drainage basin works out to an average discharge of about {{convert|0.16|cuft/s|m3/s}} per square mile. Due to the large size and dryness of the basin, flows can also fluctuate significantly from year to year. The highest annual mean was {{convert|181800|cuft/s|m3/s}} in 1993, and the lowest was {{convert|41690|cuft/s|m3/s}} in 2006.<ref name="missouriflow"/> Extremes of the flow vary even further. The largest discharge ever recorded was over {{convert|710000|cuft/s|m3/s}} on July 31, 1993 during [[Great Flood of 1993|a historic flood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/peak?site_no=06934500&agency_cd=USGS&format=html|title=USGS Gage #07010000 on the Mississippi River at St. Louis, Missouri: Peak Streamflow|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|work=National Water Information System|date=1844-2009|accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref> The lowest, a mere {{convert|602|cuft/s|m3/s}}, was measured on December 23, 1963.<ref name="missouriflow"/>

==First peoples==
Archaeological evidence, especially in Missouri, suggests that early humans inhabited the Missouri River basin since at least 10,000 years ago. Although the exact time range of human occupation is much debated among historians, research in the 1920s suggested that man first made his presence here about 12,000 years ago, at the end of the [[Pleistocene]].<ref name="archaeology"/> During the end of the [[last glacial period]], a great migration of humans began, with [[Eurasia]]n peoples traveling into and throughout [[North America]]. As they traveled slowly over hundreds of years, the Missouri River formed one of the main migration paths. Most settled in the [[Ohio Valley]] and the lower [[Mississippi Valley]], but many, including the [[Mound builder (people)|Mound builders]], also stayed along the Missouri, becoming the ancestors of the later indigenous peoples of the Great Plains.<ref>{{cite web

Native Americans that lived along the Missouri had access to ample resources of food, water, and shelter. Many migratory animals inhabited the plains at the time, providing them meat, clothing, and other everyday items; there were also great [[Riparian zone|riparian]] areas along the river's shorelines that provided them with natural herbs and staple foods.<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> The river has had a continuous history of different tribes and groups, although few written records from the pre-European period exist. According to the writings of explorers, some of the major tribes along the Missouri River included the [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]], [[Missouria]], [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], [[Ponca]], [[Brul<U+00E9>]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]], [[Sioux]], [[Arikara]], [[Hidatsa]], [[Mandan]], [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], [[Gros Ventres]] and [[Blackfeet]].<ref>Benke and Cushing, p. 432</ref>

Native Americans along the river used it, at least to a limited extent, as a path of trade and transport. In addition, the river and its tributaries formed tribal boundaries. Lifestyles of the indigenous mostly centered around a semi-[[nomad]]ic culture; many tribes would have different summer and winter camps. However, the center of Native American wealth and trade lay along the Missouri River in the Dakotas region on its great bend south.<ref>{{cite web

Once the Missouri River was inhabited along its banks by tens of millions of [[American bison]] (also called buffalo), which were one of the [[keystone species]] of the Great Plains and the Ohio Valley.<ref>Lott and Greene, p. 167</ref> Most Native Americans in the basin relied heavily on the bison as a food source, and their hides and bones served to create other household items. In time, the species came to benefit from the indigenous peoples' periodic controlled burnings of the [[grassland]]s surrounding the Missouri, in order to clear out old and dead growth. However, after Europeans got to North America, both the bison and the Native Americans saw a rapid decline in population.<ref>{{cite web

==Early explorers==
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:justify; width:35%; float:right; padding:10px 15px; display:table;">While conversing about these monsters sailing quietly in clear and calm water, we heard the noise of a rapid into which we were about to run.  I never saw anything more terrific, a tangle of entire trees from the mouth of the Pekistanoui with such impetuosity that one could not attempt to cross it without great danger.  The commotion was such that the water was made muddy by it and could not clear itself.

Pekitanoui is a river of considerable size, coming from the northwest, from a great distance; and it discharges into the Mississippi.  There are many villages of savages along this river, and I hope by this means to discover the Vermillion or California Sea.<ref name="Houck">Houck, pp. 160<U+2013>161</ref><ref>Kellogg, p. 249</ref></blockquote>

===Jolliet and Marquette===
The first Europeans to see the river were the [[France|French]] explorers [[Louis Jolliet]] and [[Jacques Marquette]] in 1673 who shortly after looking at [[Piasa]] [[petroglyph]] paintings on the bluffs above the Mississippi River near the present-day location of [[Alton, Illinois]] heard the Missouri rushing into the Mississippi.  "Pekistanoui" or "Pekitanoui" was the Native American name that the explorers recorded for the Missouri. At the time, the Missouri was in flood, which made it look significantly larger than the main stem of the Mississippi.<ref name="Houck"/><ref>{{cite web

Marquette wrote that natives had told him that it was just a six-day canoe trip up the river, some {{convert|60|mi|km}}, where it would be possible to [[portage]] over to another river that would take people to what is now the state of [[California]] (which was definitely not true). Jolliet and Marquette never explored the Missouri beyond its mouth, and did not linger in the area for long.<ref name="Houck"/>

===Bourgmont===
[[File:Missouri River joins the Mississippi River.JPG <U+200E>|thumb|Mouth of the Missouri River (center)as it enters the Mississippi River (foreground)]] 
The Missouri remained formally unexplored and uncharted until [[<U+00C9>tienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont]] wrote "Exact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony" in 1713 followed in 1714 by "The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River." In the two documents Bourgmont was the first to use the name "Missouri" to refer to the river (and he was to name many of the tributaries along the river based on the Native American tribes that lived along them).  The names and locations were used by cartographer [[Guillaume Delisle]] to create the first reasonably accurate map of the river.<ref name="Bourgmont">{{cite web

Bourgmont was living with the Missouria tribe at its [[Brunswick, Missouri|Brunswick]] village with his Missouria wife and son. He had been [[on the lam]] from French authorities since 1706 when he deserted his post as commandant of [[Fort Detroit]] after he was criticized by [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac]] for his handling of [[Siege of Fort Detroit|an attack]] by the [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa tribe]] in which a priest, a French sergeant and 30 Ottawa were killed.<ref>{{cite web

Bourgmont's reputation was further enhanced when the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], who had been befriended by Bourgmont, massacred the Spanish [[Villasur expedition]] in 1720<ref>{{cite web

After squabbling with French authorities over financing of a new fort on the Missouri and also suffering a yearlong illness, Bourgmont established [[Fort Orleans]] near present day Brunswick in the north central part of present-day Missouri, which was the first fort and first longer term European settlement of any kind on the Missouri, in late 1723 near his home at Brunswick. In 1724 Bourgmont led an expedition to enlist [[Comanche]] support in the fight against the Spanish. In 1725 Bourgmont brought the chiefs of the Missouri River tribes to [[Paris]] to see the glory of France including the palaces of [[Versailles]], and [[Fountainbleau]] and a hunting expedition on a royal preserve with [[Louis XV]]. Bourgmont was raised to the rank of the nobility, remained in France and did not accompany the chiefs back to the New World. Fort Orleans was either abandoned or its small contingent was massacred by Native Americans in 1726.<ref>Houck, pp. 258<U+2013>265</ref>

It is unclear how far up the Missouri Bourgmont traveled. He is the documented first European discoverer of the [[Platte River]]. In his writings he described the blonde-haired [[Mandan]]s, so it is possible that he made it as far north as their villages in central North Dakota.<ref>{{cite article

===Fur trade===
[[Image:George Caleb Bingham 001.jpg|thumb|right|"Fur Traders on Missouri River", painted by [[George Caleb Bingham]] c. 1845]]
As early as the 18th century, [[fur trappers]] entered the extreme northern basin of the Missouri River in the hopes of finding populations of [[North American Beaver|beaver]] and [[River otter|otter]], the sale of whose pelts drove the thriving [[North American fur trade]]. They came from many different places <U+2013> some from the Canadian fur corporations at [[Hudson Bay]], some from the [[Pacific Northwest]], and some from the midwestern United States. Most did not stay in the area for long, as they failed to find significant resources.<ref>{{cite web

The first glowing reports of country rich with thousands of game animals came in 1806 when Meriwether Lewis and William Clark returned from their two-year expedition. Their journals described lands rich with thousands of buffalo, beaver, and river otter; and also an abundant population of [[sea otter]]s on the Pacific Northwest coast. In 1807, explorer [[Manuel Lisa]] organized an expedition which would lead to the explosive growth of the fur trade in the upper Missouri River country. Lisa and his crew traveled up the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers, trading manufactured items in return for furs from local Native American tribes, and established a fort at the confluence of the Yellowstone and a tributary, the [[Bighorn River|Bighorn]], in southern Montana. Although the business started small, its potential quickly grew it into a thriving trade.<ref>{{cite web

Lisa's men started construction of [[Fort Raymond]], which sat on a bluff overlooking the confluence of the Yellowstone and Bighorn, in the fall of 1807. The fort would serve primarily as a trading post for bartering with the Native Americans for furs.<ref>Morris, pp. 40<U+2013>41</ref> This method was unlike that of the Pacific Northwest fur trade, which involved trappers hired by the various fur enterprises, namely [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson's Bay]]. Fort Raymond was later replaced by [[Fort Lisa (North Dakota)|Fort Lisa]] at the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone in North Dakota; a second fort also called [[Fort Lisa (Nebraska)|Fort Lisa]] was built downstream on the Missouri River in Nebraska. In 1809 the [[St. Louis Missouri Fur Company]] was founded by Lisa in conjunction with William Clark and [[Pierre Choteau]], among others.<ref>South Dakota State Historical Society & South Dakota Department of History pp. 320<U+2013>325</ref><ref name="npsfur">{{cite web

Fur trapping activities in the early 19th century encompassed nearly all of the Rocky Mountains on both the eastern and western slopes. Trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company, St. Louis Missouri Fur Company, [[American Fur Company]], [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]], [[North West Company]] and other outfits worked thousands of streams in the Missouri watershed as well as the neighboring Columbia, [[Colorado River|Colorado]], [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]], [[Saskatchewan River|Saskatchewan]] and other river basins. During this period, the trappers, also called [[mountain men]], blazed trails through the wilderness that would later form the paths pioneers and settlers would travel by into the West. Transport of the thousands of beaver pelts required ships, providing one of the first large motives for river transport on the Missouri to start.<ref>Sunder, p. 10</ref><ref name="MDC">{{cite web

As the 1830s drew to a close, the fur industry slowly began to die as [[silk]] replaced beaver fur as a desirable clothing item <U+2013> by then, the beaver population of Rocky Mountains streams had been almost entirely decimated by intense hunting. Furthermore, frequent Native American attacks on trading posts made it dangerous for employees of the fur companies. In some regions, the industry continued well into the 1840s, but in others such as the Platte River valley, non-ideal conditions contributed to an earlier demise.<ref>Sunder, p. 8</ref> The fur trade finally disappeared in the Great Plains around 1850, with the primary center of industry shifting to the Mississippi Valley and central Canada. Despite the demise of the once-thriving industry, however, its legacy led to the opening of the American West and a flood of settlers, farmers, ranchers, adventurers, hopefuls, financially bereft, and entrepreneurs took their place.<ref name="MDC"/><ref>Sunder, pp. 12<U+2013>15</ref>

===Settlers and pioneers===
The river roughly defined the [[Frontier#American frontier|American frontier]] in the 19th century, particularly downstream from [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where it takes a sharp eastern turn into the heart of the state of Missouri. All of the major trails for the opening of the American West have their starting points on the river, including the [[California Trail|California]], [[Mormon Trail|Mormon]], [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], and [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]] trails. The first westward leg of the [[Pony Express]] was a ferry across the Missouri at [[St. Joseph, Missouri]]. Similarly, most emigrants arrived at the eastern terminus of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] via a ferry ride across the Missouri between [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] and [[Omaha, Nebraska]].<ref>Dick, pp. 127<U+2013>132</ref><ref>{{cite web

Over five hundred thousand pioneers in all set out from the river town of [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]] to their various destinations in the American West from the 1830s to the 1860s. These people had many reasons to embark on this strenuous year-long journey <U+2013> economic crisis, and later gold strikes including the [[California Gold Rush]], for example.<ref>{{cite web

|title=The Great Platte River Road

|date=1998-06-30
|accessdate=2011-01-07}}</ref> For most, the route took them up the Missouri to Omaha, Nebraska, where they would [[Great Platte River Road|set out along the Platte River]], which flows from the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming and Colorado eastwards through the Great Plains. An early expedition led by [[Robert Stuart (explorer)|Robert Stuart]] from 1812 to 1813 proved the Platte impossible to navigate by the [[dugout canoe]]s they used, let alone the large sidewheelers and sternwheelers that would later ply the Missouri in increasing numbers. One explorer remarked that the Platte was "too thick to drink, too thin to plow".<ref>Cech, p. 424</ref> Nevertheless, the Platte provided an abundant and reliable source of water for the pioneers as they headed west in covered wagons.<ref>Mattes, pp. 4<U+2013>11</ref>

During the 1860s, gold strikes in Montana, Colorado, Wyoming and northern [[Utah]] attracted another wave of hopefuls to the region. Although some freight was hauled overland, most transport to and from the gold fields was done through the Missouri River and its tributary the [[Kansas River]], as well as the [[Snake River]] in western Wyoming and the [[Bear River (Utah)|Bear River]] in Utah, [[Idaho]] and Wyoming.<ref>Holmes, Walter and Dailey, pp. 105<U+2013>106</ref> It is estimated that of the passengers and freight hauled from the Midwest to Montana, over 80% were transported by boat, a journey that took 150 days in the upstream direction. A route more directly west into Colorado lay along the Kansas River and the [[Republican River]] as well as pair of smaller Colorado streams, [[Big Sandy Creek (Colorado)|Big Sandy Creek]] and the [[South Platte River]], to near Denver. The gold rushes precipitated the decline of the [[Bozeman Trail]] as a popular emigration route, as it passed through land held by often-hostile Native Americans. Safer paths were blazed to the [[Great Salt Lake]] near [[Corinne, Utah]] during the gold rush period, which led to the large-scale settlement of the Rocky Mountains region and eastern [[Great Basin]].<ref>Athearn, pp. 87<U+2013>88</ref>

[[Image:bodmer5455.jpg|thumb|left|Karl Bodmer "[[Fort Pierre, South Dakota|Fort Pierre]] and the Adjacent Prairie", c. 1833]]
As settlers expanded their holdings into the Great Plains they naturally ran into conflicts with Native American tribes over land. This resulted in frequent raids, massacres and armed conflicts, leading to the federal government creating multiple [[Treaty|treaties]] with the Plains tribes, which generally involved establishing borders and reserving lands for the indigenous. As with the majority of other U.S.-Native American treaties, these promises were soon broken, leading to huge wars. Over 1,000 battles, big and small, were fought between the U.S. military and Native Americans before the tribes were forced out of their land onto reservations.<ref>{{cite web

However, the peace and freedom of the Native Americans did not last for long. The [[Great Sioux War of 1876-77]] was sparked when American miners discovered gold in the Black Hills of western South Dakota and eastern Wyoming. These lands were originally set aside for Native American use by the Treaty of Fort Laramie.<ref name="Laramie1868"/> When the settlers intruded onto the lands, they were attacked by Native Americans. U.S. troops were sent to the area to protect the miners, and drive out the natives from the new settlements. During this bloody period, both the Native Americans and the U.S. military won victories in major battles, resulting in the loss of nearly a thousand lives. The war eventually ended in a U.S. victory; Native Americans were relocated to reservations in Wyoming and Montana, and the Black Hills were given to the settlers.<ref>Greene, pp. xv<U+2013>xxvi</ref>

==Dams and engineering==
In the 20th century a great number of dams were built along the Missouri River, transforming parts of its watershed into one of the largest [[reservoir]] systems of North America. The Missouri's heavy sediment loads resulted in consistent course changes; its banks originally could shift a half-mile in an year, destroying property and infrastructure. Furthermore, the silt reduced the depth of its channel, exacerbating the power of floods and hindering navigation.<ref name="Story"/> As early as the 1860s, plans were already being considered for major alterations in the Missouri basin. The 1940s saw two grand proposals put forward for hydrologic modifications on the Missouri: the [[Pick-Sloan Plan]], and the [[Missouri River Bank Stabilization and Navigation Project]]. The USACE took the job of implementing these plans, which called for the construction of [[levee]]s, the excavation of new channels, and the creation of six dams that transformed 35 percent of the river's course into a chain of reservoirs. A total of fifteen dams, large and small, now impound long reaches of the Missouri River from south of [[Helena, Montana]] to [[Yankton, South Dakota]].<ref name="Story"/>

Violent floods struck the Missouri basin in [[Great Flood of 1844|1844]], [[Great Flood of 1881|1881]], 1903, 1908, 1915, [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|1926-1927]] and 1934.<ref name="flooding">{{cite web

This flood caused $1.4 million (about $17.85 million in 2011 dollars) of damage in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] when the river breached a levee, destroying over 100 buildings and killing one person.<ref>{{cite web

From the first decade of the 20th century to the 1940s, a series of dams was built on the Missouri in the vicinity of [[Great Falls, Montana]], to generate power from the [[Great Falls of the Missouri]], a series of five giant waterfalls formed by the river in its path through western Montana. [[Black Eagle Dam]], built in 1891 on [[Black Eagle Falls]], was one of the earliest dams built on the Missouri and the first built in this area.<ref>''Montana: A State Guide Book'', p. 150</ref> The structure was little more than a [[weir]] a few feet high atop Black Eagle Falls, diverting part of the Missouri's flow into the Black Eagle power plant. The main and present structure of the Black Eagle Dam, built in 1926, supplemented power to the [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plant, which was replaced in that year with a more modern unit.<ref>{{cite web

In that same time period, the [[Montana Power Company]] and several other smaller enterprises began a series of hydroelectric projects on the upper Missouri River, above Great Falls and below [[Helena, Montana]]. A small [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the river]] structure at the present site of [[Canyon Ferry Dam]] that was completed in 1898 became the second dam to be built on the Missouri; it generated 7.5 [[megawatt]]s of electricity for Helena and the surrounding countryside.<ref>Mulvaney, p. 112</ref> Another dam, the nearby [[Steel dam|steel]] [[Hauser Dam]], was built from 1905 to 1907, but failed in 1908 because of structural deficiencies and heavy river flows, causing catastrophic flooding all the way downstream past [[Craig, Montana]]. At Great Falls, the Black Eagle Dam was dynamited in order to save a nearby [[smelter]] from inundation.<ref>Mulvaney, p. 39</ref> Despite the disaster, the dam was rebuilt in 1910 by Montana Power Company using concrete, and stands to this day.<ref name="Hauser">{{cite web

Begun in 1944, the Pick-Sloan Plan called for a series of five reservoirs to be built along the main stem of the Missouri River and many more on its tributaries.  Although originally separated into two distinct plans <U+2013> the Sloan plan, which emphasized irrigation, and Pick plan, which called for flood control, navigation and hydroelectricity generation <U+2013> the two were combined into one, which eventually totaled 90 major dams. All five were built; today the Missouri flows through [[Garrison Dam|Garrison]], [[Oahe Dam|Oahe]], [[Big Bend Dam|Big Bend]], [[Fort Randall Dam|Fort Randall]] and [[Gavins Point Dam|Gavins Point]] dams; [[Fort Peck Dam]], which lies upstream of Garrison, had already been completed in 1940.

For a while, debate continued whether to build a low run-of-the-river dam at the Garrison Dam site, which would form [[Lake Sakakawea]], or up to twenty-seven on the Yellowstone and its tributaries.<ref name="Pick-Sloan"/> Eventually, it was decided to go with the former site, but with the construction of a much larger dam, because of its larger storage capacity and greater hydroelectric potential. This proposal was made by the USBR; however, the agency was not altogether heavily involved in the project. The [[Flood Control Act of 1944]] (Pick-Sloan Legislation) was passed, clearing the way for the Pick-Sloan plan to begin.<ref>{{cite web

===List of dams===
A comprehensive list is given of all fifteen dams on the Missouri River, ordered downstream. If the dam is a run-of-the-river facility (and thus lacking significant storage capacity), the reservoir parameter is left blank. Most of the dams are on the upper half of the river, otherwise they would impede navigation if built on the lower part of the Missouri.<ref>{{cite web

Boat travel on the Missouri first started with the wood-framed [[bull boat]]s and [[canoe]]s of the Native Americans, which were used for thousands of years before the introduction of larger craft to the river upon colonization of the Great Plains. The first [[steamboat]] on the Missouri was the ''[[Independence (steamboat)|Independence]]'', which started running between St. Louis and [[Keytesville, Missouri|Keytesville]] around 1819.<ref name="D101">Demoth, p. 101</ref> By the 1830s, large mail and freight-carrying vessels began operating on the river between Kansas City and St. Louis, and some even further up. A handful, such as the ''Western Engineer'' and the ''[[Yellowstone (steamboat)|Yellowstone]]'', were able to make it up the river as far as eastern Montana. At this time, the [[North American fur trade]] was at its height, and more and more ships began traveling nearly the whole length of the Missouri from Montana's rugged [[Missouri Breaks]] to the mouth, carrying beaver and buffalo furs to and from the areas that the trappers frequented.<ref>{{cite article

Water transport increased through the 1850s with multiple craft ferrying pioneers, emigrants and miners; many of these runs were from St. Louis or Independence to near Omaha. There, most of these people would set out overland along the broad, swift but shallow and unnavigable Platte River, which was described by pioneers as "a mile wide and an inch deep" and "the most magnificent and useless of rivers".<ref>Rogers, Brown and Garbrecht, p. 113</ref> By 1858, there were over 130 boats operating full-time on the Missouri, with many more smaller vessels. The industry's success, however, did not guarantee safety. In the early decades before the river's flow was controlled by man, its sketchy rises and falls and its massive amounts of sediment, which prevented a clear view of the bottom, wrecked some 300 boats.<ref>Dyer, p. 2</ref> Because of the danger of navigating the Missouri River, the average ship's lifespan was short <U+2013> about four years <U+2013> before she was sunk or pulled out of service. Eventually, the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] ended steamboat commerce on the Missouri. The number of boats slowly dwindled, until there was almost nothing left by the mid-1880s.<ref>{{cite news

===Passage to Sioux City===
Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Missouri River has been extensively engineered for water transport purposes. In 1912, the USACE was authorized to maintain the Missouri to a depth of {{convert|6|ft|m}} from [[Kansas City, Missouri]] to the mouth, a distance of  {{convert|553|mi|km}}. This was accomplished by constructing levees and [[wing dam]]s to direct the river<U+2019>s flow into a narrower, straighter channel and prevent sedimentation. In 1925, the USACE began a project to widen the navigation channel (the portion of the river's breadth maintained to a certain depth for the passage of large vessels)  to {{convert|200|ft|m}}. Then, in 1927, the USACE started the [[dredging]] of a deep-water channel from Kansas City to [[Sioux City, Iowa]]. Channeling has reduced the river's length from {{convert|2540|mi|km}} in the late 19th century to {{convert|2341|mi|km}} in the present day.<ref name="modifications"/><ref>{{cite web

[[File:Gavins Point Dam.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Gavins Point Dam]] at [[Yankton, South Dakota]] is the uppermost obstacle to navigation from the mouth on the Missouri today.]]
All these [[revetment]]s, however, did not allow for the passage of large riverboats and barges. Construction of dams on the Missouri under the Pick-Sloan Plan in the 1950s aided navigation by regulating water flow. The six large reservoirs along the Missouri <U+2013> Fort Peck, Sakakawea, Oahe, Francis Case, Sharpe, and Lewis and Clark <U+2013> can hold a combined {{convert|63102000|acre feet|km3}} of water, equaling slightly more than one year's worth of the river's flow.<ref>{{cite web

In 1945, the USACE began the Missouri River Bank Stabilization and Navigation Project, which would permanently increase the river<U+2019>s navigation channel to a width of {{convert|300|ft|m}} and a depth of {{convert|9|ft|m}}. During work that continues to this day, the {{convert|735|mi|km|adj=on}} navigation channel from Sioux City to St. Louis has been controlled by building rock dikes to direct the river<U+2019>s flow and scour out sediments, sealing and cutting off meanders and side channels, and dredging the riverbed.<ref>{{cite web

In 2006, several [[U.S. Coast Guard]] work boats ran aground in the Missouri River because the navigation channel had been severely silted.<ref>{{cite web

In 1929, the [[Missouri River Navigation Commission]] estimated the total amount of goods shipped on the river annually at 15 million tons (13.6 million metric tons), providing widespread consensus for the creation of a navigation channel. However, shipping traffic has since been far lower than expected <U+2013> shipments of commodities including produce, manufactured items, lumber, and oil averaged only 8.2 million tons (7.4 million metric tons) per year from 1994 to 2006.<ref name="GAO">{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> Of the tonnage of materials shipped, Missouri is by far the largest user of the river accounting for 83% of river traffic <U+2013> while Kansas has 12%, Nebraska 3% and Iowa 2%. Almost all of the barge traffic on the Missouri River ships sand and gravel dredged from the lower {{convert|500|mi|km}} of the river; the remaining portion of the shipping channel now sees little to no use by commercial vessels.<ref name="GAO"/>

===Traffic decline===
Tonnage of goods shipped by barges has seen a serious decline from the 1960s to the present on the Missouri River. In the 1960s, the USACE predicted an increase to 12 million annual tons (10.8 million metric tons) by 2000, but instead the opposite has happened. Tonnage of barge-shipped goods dropped from 3.3 million tons (3 million metric tons) in 1977 to just 1.3 million tons (1.18 million metric tons) in 2000.<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> One of the largest drops has been in agricultural products, especially [[wheat]]. Part of the reason is that irrigated acreage along the Missouri has only been developed to a tenth of its potential. In 2006, barges on the Missouri hauled only 200,000 tons (181,437 metric tons) of products which is equal to the amount of ''daily'' freight traffic on the Mississippi.<ref>{{cite news

Droughts and the development of other transportation systems have hampered river traffic on the Missouri in the late 20th century and early 21st century. As shipping turns to other forms of transportation such as trucks and trains, boat traffic has dropped to 245,000 tons (222,260 metric tons) as of 2009, which is also "the first year of recovery after eight years of drought".<ref name="decline"/> Also, the failure of the USACE to consistently maintain the navigation channel has negatively impacted the industry. Currently, efforts are being made to revive the shipping industry on the Missouri River, because of the efficiency and cheapness of river transport to haul agricultural products, and the overcrowding of alternative transportation routes. Solutions such as expanding the navigation channel and releasing more water from reservoirs during the peak of the navigation season are being considered.<ref>{{cite web

==Ecology and human impact==
[[Image:Missouririverecoregions.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ecoregion]]s of the Missouri basin as defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] and [[Nature Conservancy]]]]
Historically, the Missouri's [[floodplain]], an area thousands of square miles in size, supported a wide diversity of plant and animal species, generally increasing in size and variety as one proceeded downstream from the cold, relatively arid headwaters in Montana to the temperate, moist climate of Missouri. The river's [[riparian zone]] consisted primarily of [[Hibiscus tiliaceus|cottonwood]]s, [[willow]]s and [[Platanus|sycamore]]s, with several other types of trees such as [[maple]] and [[Fraxinus|ash]]. The height of the trees generally increase farther from the riverbanks for a limited distance, as the roots of the trees closer to the river are vulnerable to soil erosion during floods. Because of its large sediment concentrations, the Missouri does not support many aquatic invertebrates.<ref>Benke and Cushing, p. 436</ref> However, the basin does support 300 species of birds<ref>Benke and Cushing, p. 437</ref> and 150 species of fish.<ref>{{cite web

The Missouri River basin is divided into three freshwater [[ecoregion]]s by the [[World Wide Fund For Nature]]: the Upper Missouri, Lower Missouri and Central Prairie. The Upper Missouri, encompassing an area roughly within Montana, Wyoming, southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, and North Dakota is defined by a [[continental climate]] with dry grasslands and sparse biodiversity because of [[Ice Age]] [[glaciation]]s; there are no known [[endemic species]]. Except for the headwaters in the Rockies, there is little precipitation in this part of the watershed.<ref>{{cite web

This region has the greatest diversity of plants and animals of the three ecoregions, despite its large seasonal temperature fluctuations. There are 13 species of [[crayfish]] endemic to the lower Missouri.<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:Nishnabotna River aerial.jpg|thumb|left|The Missouri's confluence with the [[Nishnabotna River]] in western Missouri <U+2013> note that agricultural fields dominate most of the landscape, which was probably once [[floodplain]].]]
Throughout its history of industrialization and commerce, the Missouri has been severely polluted and degraded by human activities along its shores; in addition, most of the river's floodplain habitat is long gone, replaced by irrigated agricultural land. Additionally, development of the floodplain has led to more and more people and industries within areas at high risk of inundation. Levees have been constructed along much of the river in order to keep floodwaters within the channel, but this also leads to faster stream velocity and thence increasing peak flows in downstream areas. A major problem in the river is the excess of [[fertilizer]] runoff and resultantly, elevated levels of [[nitrogen]]. A large amount of fertilizer travels down the Missouri from farmland in the states of Iowa and Missouri, but it is not the most affected river in the Mississippi basin <U+2013> the upper Mississippi, [[Illinois River|Illinois]] and Ohio Rivers are even more severely affected. The result of this pollution are [[algae bloom]]s which result in oxygen depletion, and the vast [[Gulf of Mexico dead zone]] at the end of the Mississippi Delta.<ref>{{cite web

Environmentalists contend that channelization of the lower Missouri waters, which make the river narrower, deeper, and less accessible to riparian flora and fauna, has caused massive biological loss. The reclamation of over {{convert|300000|acre|km2}} of Missouri River floodplain has eliminated most critical habitat for fish and amphibians, as well as nesting sites for birds.<ref name="riparianloss">{{cite web|last=Kendle|first=Earl R.|url= http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=nebgamewhitepap|title=The Effects of Channelization in the Missouri River on Fish and Fish-Food Organisms|publisher=Digital Commons @ University of Nebraska, Lincoln|work=Nebraska Game and Parks Commission|date=1970-11-09|accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Furthermore, because of the extremely low use of the shipping channel in the lower Missouri maintained by the USACE, it is considered feasible to remove some of the levees, dikes and wing dams that constrict the river's flow, to allow it to naturally restore its environment.<ref name="riparianloss"/> Recently efforts to reestablish the riparian zones have been under way; as of 2001, there were {{convert|87000|acre|km2}} of riverside floodplain undergoing active restoration.<ref>{{cite news

The [[Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail]], some {{convert|3700|mi|km}} long, follows nearly the entire Missouri River from its mouth to its source, retracing the route of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Extending from [[Wood River, Illinois]] in the east to [[Astoria, Oregon]] in the west, it also follows portions of the Mississippi River and [[Columbia River]].
