'''Abby Cunningham''' (n<U+00E9>e '''Fairgate'''; formerly '''Ewing''' and '''Sumner''')<ref name="profile">{{cite news|url= http://www.knotslanding.net/characterbios/abbyb.htm |title=''Knots Landing Character: Abby Cunningham|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}</ref> is a [[fictional character]] from the [[CBS]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Knots Landing]]'', a long-running serial about [[working class]] life on the fictional [[cul-de-sac]] known as Seaview Circle in [[Los Angeles, California]]. She was played by actress [[Donna Mills]] between 1980 and 1989. Abby was created by producer David Jacobs as one of ''Knots Landing''{{'s}} earliest characters. She debuted in the [[List of Knots Landing episodes#Season two|first episode]] of the [[Knots_Landing#Season_Two_.281980.E2.80.9381.29|second season]]. Mills remained a principal actor in the series until she left in its [[Knots_Landing#Season_Ten_.281988.E2.80.9389.29|tenth season]]. She returned for the two-part [[Knots Landing#Season fourteen|series finale]] to provide closure for the fans. The character made her last television appearance in 1997, when she appeared in the ''Knots Landing'' reunion series ''[[Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac]]'', and was reunited with former cast members.

Prior to being cast on ''Knots Landing'', Mills was predominantly known for playing "[[damsel in distress]]" roles, which is why the producers didn't initially consider her. Abby's storylines focused on business dealings, affairs and family troubles. Introduced as the sister of [[Knots Landing#Credited cast|Sid Fairgate]], she was initially portrayed as a friendly, warm-hearted woman with great love for her children. In due time, she evolved into the series' main [[antagonist]], constantly causing mayhem in others' lives. According to series creator [[David Jacobs (writer)|David Jacobs]], the producers always intended Abby to be a [[J.R. Ewing]]-esque character. Jacobs said, "When we were casting the role of Abby, we were looking for a homey type, someone whom the other women characters would trust. It was our intention to have this nice person gain the trust of the other women and then cause trouble for them. We didn't want the other characters and the audience to know that there was a scheming person under this nice facade. We wanted her to come on as a good person and then evolve into a vixen."<ref name= "TCT"/>

The character became known for her manipulative behavior and was often labeled a "soap vixen". She was praised by television critics, with Carolyn McGuire of ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' saying: "Whoever shows up as the next villain, chances are his or her work won't be easy. That's because at least one resident<U+2014>Abby Ewing<U+2014>knows how to dish nasty with the best of them."<ref name= "TCT"/> When asked which character he wished he had created, [[Mike Kelley (writer)|Mike Kelly]], the creator of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s popular primetime-[[soap opera]] ''[[Revenge (TV series)|Revenge]]'', said: "Abby Ewing. Donna Mills, you rocked my world."<ref name= "MK"/> John Mapes of ''The Biography Channel'' said, "Any great soap opera needs a great villain. While viewers may identify more with the protagonist, the villains in a serial drama always spice things up, cause trouble, and make it more fun to watch."<ref name= "BC"/>

===Casting and creation===
Mills portrayed Abby from 1980<U+2013>1989.<ref name = "Toledo Blade"/> Prior to being cast in ''Knots Landing'', Mills was primarily known for playing the "[[damsel in distress]]" [[archetype]] in both film and television media. The actress became somewhat famous for playing these roles, often leading to unwanted typecasting.<ref name = "Toledo Blade">{{cite web|url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RElPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JgMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3173,7240085&dq=donna+mills+to+play+victim&hl=en |title= Donna Mills To Play Victim|work =[[Toledo Blade]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|date=July 4, 1982|author=Buck, Jerry|page=32}}</ref><ref name = "Park City Daily News">{{cite web|url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1697&dat=19911103&id=BxMfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=F5gEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5186,630253 |title= In Step With: Donna Mills|work =[[The Daily News (Kentucky)]]|publisher=John Pipes Gaines|date=November 3, 1991|author=Brady, James|page=22}}</ref> In an interview with Jerry Buck for the ''[[Toledo Blade]]'', Mills said: "I got tired of playing the victim. It's a more active role. Abby keeps things stirred up, and I like that."<ref name = "Toledo Blade"/> According Jacobs, Abby was not planned when the show began. He knew that he wanted a female [[J.R. Ewing]]-esque character.<ref name= "DJI">{{cite web|url=http://www.knotslanding.net/interviews/davidjacobs.htm  |title= Exclusive Interview: In conversation with series creator David Jacbos|work= Knots Landing.net (The Official [[Knots Landing]] Website) |publisher=[[CBS]]}}</ref> However, he had a different sense of the character and who would wind up in the role. With Mills' reputation of playing the victim, he initially didn't choose her for the part.<ref name= "DJI"/>

In the early planning stages of season two, [[CBS]] executive Tony Barch suggested Mills for the role of Abby Cunningham.<ref name= "DJI"/> The character was initially conceived as the sister of [[Knots Landing|Sid Fairgate]] ([[Don Murray (actor)|Don Murray]]), one of the central characters on the show, who was killed off in the next season. Casting agent [[Barbara Miller-Gidaly]] introduced Mills and Jacobs.<ref name= "DJI"/> After meeting with Miller-Gidaly, Jacobs decided to have Mills test for the role, which was unusual for an established actress. She auditioned shortly after and convinced the producers that she was the right person for the part.<ref name= "DJI"/> Jacobs said, "She came back that afternoon and she read and she was great, and it meant reshaping the role a little bit, but, um, not that much. You know, she still came in, she drove up in the [[Volvo]] [[station wagon]]. She had the kids in the back. It was very middle class."<ref name= "DJI"/>

In 1989, Mills announced her intention to leave the long-running nighttime soap after nine years as Abby.<ref name = "PJ">{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/projo/access/596022071.html?dids=596022071:596022071&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+27%2C+1989&author=FAYE+ZUCKERMAN+Special+to+the+Journal-Bulletin&pub=The+Providence+Journal&desc=Like+fine+wine%2C+'Knots+Landing'+ages+well&pqatl=google|title= Like fine wine, 'Knots Landing' ages well|work =[[The Providence Journal]]|publisher=[[A.

|quote =  I always planned her, because it was technically a spin off from ''Dallas'' everybody expected there to be a JR so I wanted to make sure there wasn't a JR. So I brought in Abby and her two children and so she was to become the villain but she was a great addition to the show. My initial thought was that it would be scenes of a marriage times four, but it became a dramatic exploration of the way people related in the post sexual revolution world and how they kept their marriages together if they could, what the relationships meant to them. To Abby it was currency, sex equaled currency, that's how she got money.

In an interview with Greg Hernandez, Mills explained: "I knew that she was going to be a trouble maker but actually knowing the writers and the producers, I knew that the character would be rounded and have dimension and that was really fun for me to play.

Mills became known for wearing a lot of eye makeup in her scenes, to the point where it  became a major character trait for her fictional personality.

In season three, Abby sets her sights on the wealthy Gary Ewing, the husband of her good friend [[Valene Ewing]]. While Gary initially thwarted her attempts, he eventually gave in and had a full-fledged affair with her. Actress [[Joan Van Ark]], who played Val, said: "I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Abby was well received by television critics. Carolyn McGuire of ''The Chicago Tribune'' commented, "Whoever shows up as the next villain, chances are his or her work won't be easy. That's because at least one resident<U+2014>Abby Ewing<U+2014>knows how to dish nasty with the best of them. Only [[Alexis Colby|Alexis Carrington Colby Dexter]], played by [[Joan Collins]] on ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]'', and [[Angela Channing]], portrayed by [[Jane Wyman]] on  ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', rival Abby Ewing, played by Donna Mills, for best prime-time female villain."<ref name= "TCT"/> When asked which character he wished he had created, [[Mike Kelley (writer)|Mike Kelly]], the creator of ABC's popular primetime-soap ''Revenge'', said: "Abby Ewing. Donna Mills, you rocked my world."<ref name= "MK">{{cite web|url= http://www.vulture.com/2012/06/showrunner-survey-revenge-mike-kelley.html |author =Adalian, Joseph|title=Showrunner Survey: Mike Kelley on Why Revenge<U+2019>s Emily Thorne Should Compete on The Bachelorette|work= [[Vulture.com]]|publisher= New York (magazine)|date= June 24, 2012|accessdate = July 24, 2012}}</ref> Jamey Giddens of [[Zap2it]] said, "While I readily admit Alexis will go down in soap history as the most famous of the 80's primetime soap vixens, she was never truly my cup of detergent. I much preferred the more subdued, methodical villainy of characters like Abby Fairgate (Donna Mills), who slept her way through Seaview Circle, and to the top of Corporate California on ''Knots Landing''. God I miss that damn Cul-de-Sac!"<ref name= "Zap2it">{{cite web|url= http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2009/01/an-ode-to-abby-fairgate |author =Giddens, Jamey|title=An Ode to Abby Fairgate|work= [[Zap2it]]|publisher= [[Tribune Media Services]]|date= January 17, 2009|accessdate = July 24, 2012}}</ref>

Josh Mapes of ''[[The Biography Channel]]'' listed her in the category "10 Primetime Stars We Love to Hate". He said, "Any great soap opera needs a great villain. While viewers may identify more with the protagonist, the villains in a serial drama always spice things up, cause trouble, and make it more fun to watch. From tongue lashings to catfights, underhanded tricks to boldface lies, the characters we love to hate have each brought a fair share of great moments to primetime soaps. While [[Larry Hagman]] played the bad guy on ''Dallas'', Donna Mills played bad girl on its spin-off, ''Knots Landing''. Unapologetically going after what she wanted, Mills' character engaged in affairs with two of the husbands on the Knots Landing cul-de-sac. But, like most vixens on primetime soaps, she was only out for money, not love."<ref name= "BC">{{cite web|url= http://www.biography.com/bio-now/10-primetime-soap-stars-we-love-to-hate-20851059 |author =Mapes, Josh|title=10 Primetime Stars We Love to Hate|work=[[The Biography Channel]]|publisher= [[Hearst Corporation]]|date= June 13, 2012|accessdate = July 24, 2012}}</ref> Steve Eighinger of the ''[[Quincy Newspapers]]'' listed Abby as the third-most memorable TV character in an article he wrote for the ''Quincy Herald-Whig''. He said, "No one, absolutely no one, rocked eye shadow and the messy-hair look like Abby Ewing, who was this marvelous combination of vixen and corporate sleuth. As her character developed, life on the cul-de-sac made ''Knots Landing'' destination TV every Thursday night for more than a decade."<ref name= "WHW">{{cite web|url=http://www.whig.com/story/19138076/eighinger-tvs-most-memorable-characters-include-kramer-homer-and-archie?clienttype=printable|author =Eighinger, Steve|title=Eighinger: TV's most memorable characters include Kramer, Homer and Archie|work=Quincy Herald-Whig|publisher=[[Quincy Newspapers]] |date= July 28, 2012|accessdate = August 15, 2012}}</ref>

Marta Hoelsher of Technorati Media said: "The biggest news of season two, though, is the appearance of Donna Mills as Abby Cunningham, the blonde bombshell who wreaks havoc all through the neighborhood. With the appearance of Abby, things really started to heat up and get interesting. No marriage is off limits when Abby sets her eyes on it. Played to perfection by Donna Mills, Abby is wicked, vicious, bitchy, and heartless enough to keep us loving and hating her for years. Abby's clashes with [[Karen MacKenzie]] and Val were legendary, and season two gets things rolling. After a fairly peaceful start to the season, we start to see the beginnings of the rivalry that defines the show for years:  Karen vs. Abby.  It's fun watching their early friendship evolve into a bitter rivalry."<ref name= "TM">{{cite web|url= http://blogcritics.org/video/article/dvd-review-knots-landing-the-complete1/ |author =Hoelsher, Marta|title=DVD Review: Knots Landing: The Complete Second Season|work=Blog Critics.org|publisher= Technorati Media |date= May 19, 2009|accessdate = July 24, 2012}}</ref>
