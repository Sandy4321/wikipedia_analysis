'''Nikephoros Komnenos''' ({{lang-el|<U+039D><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03B7><U+03C6><U+03CC><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+039A><U+03BF><U+03BC><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03CC><U+03C2>}}; ca. 970 <U+2013> after 1026) was a [[Byzantine]] military leader under [[Basil II]] and [[Constantine VIII]], serving as governor of the [[Medieval Armenia|Armenian]] region of [[Vaspurakan]], and one of the first known members of the [[Komnenos]] family.

== Biography ==
Nikephoros Komnenos is one of the first documented members of the [[Komnenos]] family,{{sfn|ODB|loc="Komnenos" (A. Kazhdan), pp. 1143<U+2013>1144}} but his early life, and indeed his connection to the main branch of the family, are unknown. The Greek scholar [[Konstantinos Varzos]] suggested that he was born ca. 970, and that he was the younger brother of the Komnenian dynasty's patriarch, [[Manuel Erotikos Komnenos]], but both assumptions cannot be verified.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=39}}{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Nikephoros Komnenos (#25676)}}

He is first attested in 1021/22, shortly after the [[King of Vaspurakan]], [[Senekerim-Hovhannes]] (reigned 1003<U+2013>1021), unable to confront the pressure of his Muslim neighbours, surrendered his kingdom to the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] (r. 976<U+2013>1025) in exchange for large estates and the governorship of the [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Sebasteia (theme)|Sebasteia]].{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=39}}{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Nikephoros Komnenos (#25676)}} Basil initially gave the new province (Asprakania, <U+1F08><U+03C3><U+03C0><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03AF><U+03B1>, in Greek) to Basil Argyros, but was forced to replace him soon after due to his ineptitude. The ''[[protospatharios]]'' Nikephoros Komnenos was the chosen successor as governor (''[[strategos]]'' or ''[[katepano]]''), and he swiftly managed to actually enforce Byzantine rule over the country.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Nikephoros Komnenos (#25676)}} The contemporary Armenian historian [[Aristakes Lastivertsi]] records that he captured the principality of [[Artze]] on the northern shore of [[Lake Van]], and incorporated it into his province, although from the narrative of the likewise contemporary Arab Christian historian [[Yahya of Antioch]], the feat seems to have been carried out by Emperor Basil himself.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Nikephoros Komnenos (#25676)}}

Nikephoros Komnenos continued to serve as ''strategos'' of Asprakania under Basil II's brother and successor, [[Constantine VIII]] (r. 1025<U+2013>1028), but in 1026 he was dismissed on suspicion of disloyalty and recalled to [[Constantinople]], where he was [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]].{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Nikephoros Komnenos (#25676)}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=40}} Two different versions are provided by the sources on the background to his recall: the Byzantine chronicler [[John Skylitzes]] reports that he insisted on a written pledge of support from his troops, intended to be used against the neighbouring Turkish rulers, but which was interpreted by Constantine as an attempt to create a force personally loyal to him.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Nikephoros Komnenos (#25676)}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=40}} While Skylitzes puts the blame on the ever-suspicious Constantine, Aristakes claims that Nikephoros was indeed engaged in treasonous talks with King [[George I of Georgia]] (r. 1014<U+2013>1027), aiming to declare himself emperor or making Vaspurakan an independent kingdom. When the troops of [[Cappadocia (theme)|Cappadocia]] found out about it, however, they captured Nikephoros and sent him prisoner to Constantinople, where Constantine VIII, after carefully examining the affair and convincing himself of Nikephoros guilt, had him and eight of his companions blinded.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Nikephoros Komnenos (#25676)}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=40}}

The date of his death, as well as any descendants, are unknown.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=40}}
