== History ==
[[Image:Amos tuck.jpg|thumb|right|[[Amos Tuck]], the namesake of the Tuck School]]
At the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth College president [[William Jewett Tucker]] decided to explore the possibility of establishing a school of business to educate the growing number of Dartmouth alumni entering the commercial world.<ref name="jstor">{{cite web | url =http://www.jstor.org/stable/1979681| title = The Amos Tuck School of Business Administration: Its Origin and Present Program | first = Karl A. | last = Hill |date=December 1961 | work = Journal of Higher Education | volume=32|issue=9|pages=473<U+2013>479 | accessdate = 2007-11-08}}</ref> Turning to his former roommate from his undergraduate years at Dartmouth, Tucker enlisted the support of [[Edward Tuck]], who had since become a wealthy banker and philanthropist.<ref name="our history">{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.edu/about/history/index.html | title = About Tuck: Our History | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070524141711/http://www.tuck.edu/about/history/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-24}}</ref> Tuck donated $300,000 in the form of [[preferred stock]] shares in a Minnesota railroad company as the capital to found the school. It was named the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance, after Edward Tuck's father and Dartmouth alumnus [[Amos Tuck]].<ref name="our history"/>

The new school's annual tuition was $100 for the few students who enrolled in the first year; graduates of the two-year program received a Master of Commercial Science degree (MCS).<ref name="tuck history timeline"/><ref name="our history"/> The curriculum involved both traditional [[liberal arts]] fields as well as economic and finance education.<ref name="jstor"/> Undergraduate professors taught most of the first-year courses, while outside guest instructors and businesspeople educated students in their second years.<ref name="jstor"/><ref name="our history"/> As the nation's first graduate school of business, the Tuck School's emphasis on a broad education in general management was adopted by many other emerging business schools, and was dubbed the "Tuck Pattern".<ref name="jstor"/><ref name="our history"/>

In the late 1920s, Dartmouth president [[Ernest Martin Hopkins]] sought to unify the Tuck School by establishing a central campus, uniting the school's academic and residential facilities. Edward Tuck, then an aged man living in France, donated an additional $570,000 for the effort.<ref name="our history"/> Using primarily his funds, four new buildings were constructed in 1929 on the west side of Dartmouth's campus.<ref name="our history"/><ref name="dartmo-tuck">{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/buildings/tuvwxyzbldg.html#tuckhall2 | title = Tuck Hall (II) | work = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-10-02 }}</ref>

In 1942, the school's name changed to the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, and in 1953, the degree program changed to the modern [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA). Until the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tuck School catered primarily to Dartmouth students, accepting undergraduates during their third year.<ref name="our history"/> Under Dean Karl Hill (1957<U+2013>1960), Tuck shifted its focus to soliciting a national student body. The resulting expansion under [http://JHennessey.org Dean John Hennessey] (1968<U+2013>1976) in the late 1960s saw additional growth of the campus with the construction of a new dormitory (1969) and the Murdough Center (1973), which contains the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library. Under Deans Richard West (1976<U+2013>1983), Colin Blaydon (1983<U+2013>1990) and Paul Danos (1995-present), the school's curriculum and faculty expanded extensively, and applications increased by one-third.<ref name="our history"/> Since the late 1980s, Tuck has continued to expand in student body and faculty size, and has seen the establishment of four new campus buildings as well as several research centers and nondegree business programs.<ref name="tuck history timeline"/>

Tuck has three residential facilities: Whittemore Hall (constructed 2000), Achtmeyer Hall (constructed 2008) and Pineau-Valencienne (constructed 2008). The newer residence halls and Raether Hall are part of the Tuck Living and Learning Complex, which houses 85 additional students as well as classrooms and study space.

== Academics ==
[[File:Tuck Interior.jpg|thumb|Interior]]

The Tuck School offers only a single degree: the two-year, full-time [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA).

The school stresses a collaborative and teamwork-based approach to learning, which it touts as one of its assets for "building the interpersonal skills required for business leadership."<ref name="strategy"/> However, this emphasis on cooperative group learning has been criticized as too "touchy-feely" for students entering the competitive business world, and the emphasis on consensus-building as detrimental to students' ability to make quick, independent decisions.<ref name="tuckies"/>

Students seeking other degrees can engage in one of seven dual-degree or joint-degree programs offered in conjunction with other academic institutions. Dual degrees include an MBA/Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy from [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] at [[Tufts University]], an MBA/[[Master of Public Affairs]] from the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]], an MBA/Master of Studies in Environmental Law from the [[Vermont Law School]], and an MBA/[[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] from the [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Joint degrees include a [[Doctor of Medicine]]/MBA from [[Dartmouth Medical School]], a [[Master of Public Health]]/MBA from Dartmouth's [[The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice|Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences]], and a Master of Engineering Management/MBA from Dartmouth's [[Thayer School of Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/degrees.html | title = Joint & Dual Degrees | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071023023848/http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/degrees.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-23}}</ref> 

The school also offers a variety of second-year exchange programs at other institutions such as the [[Handelshochschule Leipzig]] in Germany, the [[HEC School of Management]] and the [[ESSEC Business School]] in Paris, [[IESE Business School]] in Barcelona, [[IE Business School]] in Madrid, and the [[London Business School]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/exchange_programs.html | title = Exchange Programs | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref>

Like the undergraduate portion of Dartmouth College, the Tuck School operates on a [[Academic term|quarter system]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/academic_calendar.html | title = Academic Calendar | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071031074253/http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/academic_calendar.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-31}}</ref> As part of the larger institution, the Tuck School is ultimately administered by Dartmouth's President and [[Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College|Board of Trustees]]. The school is directly managed by a Dean (currently Paul Danos) who is advised by a Board of Overseers that was established in 1951.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/about/staff/overseers.html | title = Board of Overseers | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071105071427/http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/about/staff/overseers.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-05}}</ref>

Since the Tuck School offers only one degree, it does not contain formal academic departments as do other institutions. Instead, faculty are generally grouped in one or more of seven "academic areas": [[accounting]], [[finance]] and [[economics]], [[marketing]], [[operations management]] and [[management science]], strategy and management, [[international business]], and management communication.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/faculty/academic_areas.html | title = Academic Areas | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071103085344/http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/faculty/academic_areas.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-03}}</ref> Tuck is also home to research centers that organize research in different fields of business administration. The centers are meant to promote faculty research, establish liaisons between the Tuck School and the corporate world, and sponsor programs for Tuck as a whole; MBA students are occasionally invited to participate as fellows and research associates.<ref name="tuck-rc">{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/faculty/research_centers.html | title = Research Centers | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071101050952/http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/faculty/research_centers.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-01}}</ref> The six research centers are the Center for Business & Society, the Center for Corporate Governance, the [http://digitalstrategies.tuck.dartmouth.edu/ Center for Digital Strategies], The Center for Global Business & Government, the Center for Leadership and the Center for Private Equity and Entrepreneurship.<ref name="tuck-rc"/>

Together with [[ESSEC]] Business School in France and Singapore, [[Keio University]] Business School in Tokyo, the School of Management of [[Fudan University]] in Shanghai, the [[Funda<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Get<U+00FA>lio Varga]] in Brazil and the Business School of the [[University of Mannheim]] in Germany, Tuck forged an alliance of leading business schools from all parts of the world in 2010 called "Council on Business and Society". The Council on Business & Society convenes a biennial forum that combines the expertise of faculty members from each of the partner schools with that of representatives of business, government, and non-governmental organizations from around the world. The inaugural forum, held at ESSEC in Paris in November 2012, focused on Corporate Governance and Leadership. The 2014 forum was hosted by Keio Business School in Tokyo and focused on Health Care Delivery. The next edition will be hosted by Dartmouth in Boston and will focus on energy and environment
