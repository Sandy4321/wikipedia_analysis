'''Dimethyl ether''', also known as '''methoxymethane''', '''oxybismethane''', '''methyl ether''', '''wood ether''', and '''DME''', is a colorless [[gaseous]] [[ether]] with an ethereal [[odor]]. Dimethyl ether gas is water [[soluble]]. It has the formula CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>. Dimethyl ether is used as an [[aerosol spray#Propellant|aerosol spray propellant]], and is used in conjunction with [[propane]] to create a chemical reaction in which [[cryogenic]] freezing is used for the removal of common [[warts]] found on the human body. Dimethyl ether is also a clean-burning alternative to [[liquified petroleum gas]], [[liquified natural gas]], [[diesel]] and [[gasoline]]. It can be made from [[natural gas]], [[coal]], or [[biomass]].

==Production of DME==
Conventional DME production uses the Methanol dehydration method.<ref>[http://www.demeon.com/ProductionProcess/ demeon.com, production process]</ref> For mass production of DME as a fuel other methods are being considered, the main one being DME synthesis from hydrogen and CO gas, also known as [[syngas]].<ref>[http://www.jfe-holdings.co.jp/en/dme/02-seizo.html JFE-holdings.co.jp, dme]</ref>

===Using Methanol Dehydration===
DME can be produced from methanol by combining two methanol molecules to produce a DME molecule and a water molecule.<ref name=dehydrcat>[http://www.int.gov.br/questao/pdf/dehydration_catalyst.pdf gov.br, dehydration catalyst]</ref> This is a reversible reaction.<ref name=dehydrcat/> This can be shown in the following equation:
: methanol <math>\leftrightarrow</math> dimethyl ether + water
: 2CH<sub>3</sub>OH <math>\leftrightarrow</math> CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O

===Using DME-synthesis===
There are various companies developing this method of DME production, the most active one being JFE Holding in Japan.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  The DME-synthesis method has a better overall efficiency because with methanol dehydration,{{Fact|date=February 2007}} the methanol is firstly produced from a base source such as LPG, NG or coal via synthesis and then this is converted into DME.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 
This method attempts to cut out the intermediate methanol production and produce DME from LPG, NG, coal or even biomass in one process.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

DME production from solid raw materials such as [[biomass]] and [[coal]] requires more processes than DME production from gases such as [[NG]] and [[LPG]]. This is because the solid materials need go through the [[gasification]] process to produce the [[syngas]] required for the DME-synthesis. To allow for more efficient gasification the biomass and coal have various preparation processes; such as chipping of the biomass or producing slurry of the coal. To ensure that the DME produced is clean there are various gas scrubbing, cleaning and purification processes. DME production from methane can simply use the auto-thermal reforming method to produce syngas which follows the following equation:

: CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + Heat <math>\rightarrow</math> 3H<sub>2</sub> + 3CO + H<sub>2</sub>O

The image below shows a simple representation of the various processes from raw materials to DME.

==End Uses of DME==

DME is used as:<ref>[http://www.demeon.com/ demeon.com, Akzo Nobel DME]</ref> 
* A refrigerant 
* A (co-)blowing agent for foam 
* A propellant for aerosol products 
* A solvent 
* An extraction agent 
* A chemical reaction medium 
* A fuel for welding cutting and brazing
* A multi-purpose fuel

==DME as a fuel==

DME can be used as a fuel in [[diesel engines]],<ref>[http://www.nykomb.se/index.php?s=Chemicals nycomb.se, Nycomb Chemicals company]</ref> [[Petrol_engine|petrol engines]] (30% DME / 70% LPG) and [[gas turbines]].
It works particularly well in diesel engines due to its high [[cetane number]], which is >55 compared to diesel which is 38-53.<ref>[http://www.topsoe.com/site.nsf/all/BBNN-5PNJ3F?OpenDocument topsoe.com, Haldor Topsoe Chemicals Company]</ref>

Currently the EU is considering DME in its potential biofuel mix in 2030.<ref>[http://www.refuel.eu/biofuels/bio-dme/ refuel.eu, EU Refuel biofuel project]</ref>

==DME as a solvent ==
Like [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>), dimethyl ether can be [[condense]]d (liquified) and used as a solvent. Clearly there are limitation on the maximum temperature (e.g. the [[boiling]]/[[reflux]]temperature i.e. -23<U+00B0>C) which the solvent can be used. One advantage of using dimethyl ether as a solvent is that is  readily removed by evaporation, especially form a product which has a relatively low boiling point.
