'''Pencak silat''' ({{IPA-may|<U+02C8>p<U+025B>nt<U+0283>a<U+0294> <U+02C8>silat|id}}; also spelled '''penchak silat''' and '''pentjak silat''') is an umbrella term for the indigenous [[martial arts]] created in [[Indonesia]].<ref name="Draeger1992">{{cite book| title=Weapons and fighting arts of Indonesia |author=[[Donn F. Draeger]] |year=1992 |publisher=Rutland, Vt. : Charles E. Tuttle Co. |isbn=978-0-8048-1716-5}}</ref> The leading [[organization]] of pencak silat in Indonesia is IPSI (Ikatan Pencak Silat Indonesia, literally: Pencak Silat Association of Indonesia). The liaison body for international pencak silat is the International Pencak Silat Association or PERSILAT (''Persekutuan Pencak Silat Antara Bangsa'').

==Etymology==
Pencak silat was chosen in 1948 as a unifying term for the Indonesian fighting styles. It was a compound of the two most commonly used words for martial arts in Indonesia. Pencak was the term used in central and east [[Java]], while silat was used in [[Sumatra]]. In modern usage, pencak and silat are seen as being two aspects of the same practice. Pencak is the performance aspects of the martial art, while silat is the essence of the fighting and self-defense. It is often said by practitioners that there can be no silat without pencak, on the other hand pencak without silat skills is purposeless.<ref name="Alexander,et.al.1979">{{cite book| title=Pentjak Silat: The Indonesian Fighting Art |author=Howard Alexander, Quintin Chambers, [[Donn F. Draeger]] |year=1979 |publisher=Tokyo, Japan : Kodansha International Ltd.}}</ref>

==History==
Pencak silat was developed in a region where tribal warfare and hunting were common activities. Tribes fought over property, natural resources and trade routes, and they also fought invading outsiders. Throughout their history, there were many wars between various indigenous tribes and kingdoms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yourdiscovery.com/martialarts/southasia/pencaksilat/index.shtml |title=  
Pencak Silat |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Discovery Channel |accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> The pencak silat tradition is mostly oral, having been passed down almost entirely by word of mouth. In the absence of written records, much of its history is known only through myth and archaeological evidence. The primary weapons of Indonesia's tribal peoples were the single-edge sword, shield and [[javelin]]. The inhabitants of [[Nias|Nias Island]] had until the 20th century remained largely untouched by the outside world, however, they are culturally similar to the [[Himalaya]]n [[Naga people|Naga]] tribe. Neighbouring [[Sumatra]]ns are said to have left the Nias people alone because they were fearless warriors.

The combative measures as artifacts of silat roots, evolved around the 7th century A.D. Bas-reliefs in [[Srivijaya]] depict warriors wielding such weapons as the [[jian]] or Chinese straight sword, which is still used in some styles today.<ref name="Draeger1992">{{cite book| title=Weapons and fighting arts of Indonesia |author=[[Donn F. Draeger]] |year=1992 |publisher=Rutland, Vt. : Charles E. Tuttle Co. |isbn=978-0-8048-1716-5}}</ref>  Additionally, [[Javanese people|Javanese]] blades are of [[India]]n derivation. The earliest evidence of silat being taught in a structured manner comes from the [[Sumatra]]-based empire of [[Srivijaya]] where folklore tells that it was created by a woman named Rama Sukana who witnessed a fight between a [[tiger]] and a large bird. By using the animals' movements, she was able to fend off a group of drunken men that attacked her. She then taught the techniques to her husband Rama Isruna from whom they were formally passed down. There are several variations of this story depending on the region where it is told. On the island of Boyan (Bawean), Rama Sukana is believed to have watched [[monkey]]s fighting each other while the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] of [[West Java]] believe that she created ''cimande'' after seeing a [[monkey]] battle a [[tiger]]. The accuracy of this legend cannot be substantiated but the fact that silat is attributed to a woman is thought to indicate its age, considering the prominence of women in traditional Southeast Asian society. 

While [[Srivijaya]] dominated the coastal areas, the Sailendra and [[Medang Kingdom]]s ruled central [[Java]] where the fighting arts developed in three geographical regions: [[West Java]], [[Central Java]], and [[East Java]]. Pencak silat especially flourished in [[Java]] which is now home to more different styles than any other Indonesian islands. In the 13th century, [[Srivijaya]] was defeated by the [[Chola]]s of [[south India]]. This was followed by the decline of the Sailendra and Sanjaya kingdoms but it also gave rise to the [[Majapahit]] empire. This was the first empire to unite all of [[Indonesia]]'s major islands, and Javanese silat reached its peak under Majapahit. The influence of silat from the mainland was consolidated by Ninik Dato' Suri Diraja (1097<U+2013>1198) to create ''silek'' or Minangkabau silat in [[Sumatra]].<ref>Thesis: ''Seni Silat Melayu'' by Abd Rahman Ismail (USM 2005 matter 188)</ref>

Pencak silat later evolved openly along with the process of [[East Indies]] independence (formerly of [[Indonesia]]), the noble man inherited by his blood line and the people united against [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonialism. During this time the [[Bugis]] and [[Makassar]] people from [[south Sulawesi]] were very well known as expert sailors, navigators and warriors. After Indonesia's independence, pencak silat was influenced by social, culture, religious, and sport context up to its modern formulation.<ref name="Patzold2011">{{cite book| title=Self-Defense and Music in Muslim Context in West Java in Divine Inspirations: Music and Islam in Indonesia|author=[[Uwe Patzold]] |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford, UK : Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-538541-0}}</ref> It was eventually brought to Europe by [[Indo people]] of Eurasian (mixed Indonesian and European) ancestry, such as the well known [[Paatje Phefferkorn]].
