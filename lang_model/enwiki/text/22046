'''Major League Baseball''' ('''MLB''') is the highest level of professional baseball in the United States and Canada. Specifically, Major League Baseball refers to the [[organization]] that operates the [[National League]] and the [[American League]] by a joint [[organizational structure]] that has developed gradually between them since [[1901 in baseball|1901]] (the National League having been in existence since [[1876 in baseball|1876]]). In [[2000 in baseball|2000]], the two [[sports league|leagues]] were officially disbanded as separate [[legal entities]] with all their rights and functions consolidated in the [[Commissioner of Baseball|commissioner's office]].<ref name=2000nl>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr2000n.shtml|title=Year In Review : 2000 National League|publisher=www.baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=2008-09-05}}</ref> MLB effectively operates as a single league and as such it constitutes one of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports league]]s of the United States and Canada. It is currently composed of 30 [[Current Major League Baseball franchises|teams]]&nbsp;<U+2014> twenty-nine in the [[United States]] and one in [[Canada]]. In conjunction with the [[International Baseball Federation]], MLB also manages the [[World Baseball Classic]].

Each [[Season (sports)|season]] consists of 162 [[game]]s (with an additional game, or games, if a [[One-game playoff|tie breaker]] is needed to determine [[postseason]] participation), which typically begins on the first Sunday in April and ends on the first Sunday in October, with the postseason played in October and sometimes into early November. The same [[Baseball rules|rules]] and [[regulation of sport|regulations]] are played between the two leagues with one exception: the American League operates under the [[Designated hitter|Designated Hitter Rule]], while the National League does not. Utilization of the DH Rule in [[interleague play]], and the [[World Series]] is determined by the [[home advantage|home team's]] league rules. In April 2010, the [[MLB All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] instituted the DH rule for all future games for that event, including those in National League parks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/sports/baseball/29bats.html | work=The New York Times | title=Rosters Expanded For the All-Star Game | date=2010-04-28 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref>

MLB is controlled by the [[Major League Baseball Constitution]] that has undergone several incarnations since 1876 with the most recent revisions being made in 2005. Under the direction of the [[Commissioner of Baseball]] (currently [[Bud Selig]]), Major League Baseball hires and maintains the sport's [[umpire (baseball)|umpiring]] crews, and negotiates [[marketing]], labor, and [[Major League Baseball television contracts|television contracts]]. As is the case for most of the sports leagues in the United States and Canada, the "closed shop" aspect of MLB effectively prevents the yearly [[promotion and relegation]] of teams into and out of Major League Baseball because of their performance. Major League Baseball maintains a unique, controlling relationship over the sport, including most aspects of [[minor league baseball]]. This is due in large part to a 1922 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]'', which held that baseball is not [[interstate commerce]] and therefore not subject to federal [[antitrust]] law. This ruling has been weakened only slightly in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swlearning.com/economics/policy_debates/baseball.html |title=Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated? |accessdate=2008-09-04 |work= |publisher=''www.swlearning.com'' |date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/role-antitrust-laws-professional-sports-industry-financial-perspective |title=The Role of Antitrust Laws in the Professional Sports Industry From a Financial Perspective |accessdate=2008-09-04 |work=Howard Bartee, Jr |publisher=''The Sport Journal'' |date= }}</ref>

The production and multimedia branch of MLB is New York<U+2013>based [[MLBAM|MLB Advanced Media]], which oversees [[MLB.com]] and each of the thirty teams' websites. Its charter states that MLB Advanced Media holds [[editorial independence]] from the League, but it is under the same ownership group and revenue-sharing plan. MLB Productions is a similarly-structured wing of the league, focusing on video and traditional broadcast media.

==League organization==
{{Major Leagues}}
Major League Baseball is divided into the [[American League]] (14 teams) and the [[National League]] (16 teams). Currently, each league is further subdivided into three divisions <U+2014> labeled East, Central, and West. The three-division structure dates back to [[1994 in baseball|1994]], when the National League expanded to 14 teams.  From [[1969 in baseball|1969]] through [[1993 in baseball|1993]] each league consisted of an East and West division.  Before 1997, the two leagues met on the field only during the [[World Series]] and the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game| All-Star Game]]: regular-season [[interleague play]] was introduced in 1997.

In March 1995, two new franchises<U+2014> the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]<U+2014>were awarded by Major League Baseball, to begin play in [[1998 in baseball|1998]]. This addition would bring the total number of franchises to 30.  In early 1997, Major League Baseball decided to assign one new team to each league: Tampa Bay joined the American League and Arizona joined the National League.  The original plan was to have an odd number of teams in each league (15 per league, with 5 in each division.)  Interleague play (which only began in 1997) would have had to be extended throughout the entire season to allow every team to play every day.  It was unclear, however, whether interleague play would be possible after the 1998 season, since continuation of interleague play for 1999 and beyond would require the approval of the players' union.  For this and other reasons, it was decided that both leagues should continue  carrying an even number of teams. One existing club would have to switch leagues.<ref>''See also'' [[Major League Baseball#League organization]].</ref>
The [[Milwaukee Brewers #1994&ndash;98: Realignment / "We're taking this thing National"|Milwaukee Brewers]] agreed <U+2014> in November 1997 <U+2014> to move from the American League to the National League, thereby making the National League a 16-team league.<ref>At the same time, the [[Detroit Tigers]] agreed to move from the AL East to the AL Central (to replace Milwaukee), with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays joining the AL East. {{cite news |url=http://www.cincypost.com/sports/1997/brew110697.html |title=Brewers switch leagues, join Reds in NL Central |work=[[The Kentucky Post]] ([[Associated Press]]) |publisher=[[E.

''See also'' [[Milwaukee Brewers #1994&ndash;98: Realignment / "We're taking this thing National"]].</ref> 

The two leagues were once totally separate rival corporate entities, but that distinction has all but disappeared. In 1903, the two leagues began to meet in an end-of-year championship series called the [[World Series]]. In [[1920 in baseball|1920]], the weak National Commission, which had been created to manage relationships between the two leagues, was replaced with the much more powerful [[Commissioner of Baseball]], who had the power to make decisions for all of professional baseball unilaterally. In [[2000 in baseball|2000]], the American and National Leagues were dissolved as legal entities, and Major League Baseball became a single league ''de jure'', although it had operated as a ''de facto'' single entity for many years.

==History==
{{Main|History of baseball in the United States}}
===Differing definitions of MLB's founding year===
{{Section OR|date=February 2010}}
For its founding year, Major League Baseball (the current official organization) uses ''1869''<U+2014>the year the first professional team, the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], was established<U+2014>and held official celebrations for its 100th anniversary in 1969 and its 125th anniversary in 1994, both of which were commemorated with league-wide shoulder patches. The modern [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Atlanta Braves]] franchises trace their histories back to the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] in the early 1870s. Many believe that the formation of the [[National League]] in 1876 is the beginning of Major League Baseball. Others believe the signing of the [[Major League Baseball Constitution|National Agreement]] in 1903 (two seasons after the [[American League]]'s formation in 1901) is the true beginning of Major League Baseball.

===Founding===
The first attempt at a national major league was the short-lived [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]], which existed from 1871 to 1875. Two current Major League franchises, the [[Atlanta Braves]] and the [[Chicago Cubs]], can trace their origins to the National Association.

Currently, there are two major leagues: the [[National League]] (founded in 1876) and the [[American League]] (founded in 1901). 

===Other Leagues===

Several other defunct leagues are officially considered to be major, and their statistics and records are included with those of the two current Major Leagues. These include the [[Union Association]] (1884), the [[American Association (19th century)]] (1882<U+2013>1891, not to be confused with later minor leagues of the same name), the [[Players League]] (1890) and the [[Federal League]] (1914<U+2013>1915). In the late 1950s, a serious attempt was made to establish a third major league, the [[Continental League]], but that league never played.

The top players in the [[Negro Leagues]] of the first half of the 20th century were as good as or even better than their counterparts in the segregated Major Leagues, which was virtually all-white with few Hispanic and Native American players. Several Negro league players have been enshrined in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]. However, the Negro Leagues are not officially considered major, primarily because the statistical record is incomplete.

[[Nippon Professional Baseball|Japanese professional baseball]] is comparable in quality to American baseball, but the [[Pacific League]] and the [[Central League]] are not officially considered major leagues.  No Japanese players have been inducted into the Hall of Fame; however, [[Sadaharu Oh]] is famous on both sides of the Pacific for holding the all-time unofficial world record for career home runs: 868.

===Rise===
In the 1860s, aided by the Civil War, "New York"-style baseball expanded into a national game and baseball's first governing body, [[History of baseball in the United States|The National Association of Base Ball Players]], was formed. The NABBP existed as an amateur league for twelve years. By 1867, more than 400 clubs were members, although most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the northeastern part of the country.

In {{by|1870}}, a schism developed between professional and amateur ballplayers, after the 1869 founding of the first professional baseball team, the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]]. The NABBP split into two groups. The [[National Association of Professional Baseball Players|National Association of ''Professional'' Base Ball Players]] was formed in 1871.<ref name="base ball">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/404475/National-Association-of-Professional-Base-Ball-Players|title=National Association of Professional Base Ball Players |accessdate=2008-09-10|author=|year=|publisher=britannica.com}}</ref> Some consider it to have been the first major league.{{By whom|date=April 2009}} Its amateur counterpart disappeared after only a few years.

In 1876, the [[National League]] of Professional Base Ball ''Clubs''<U+2014>which still exists<U+2014>was established, after the National Association proved ineffective. The emphasis was now on "clubs" rather than "players". Clubs could now enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. For their part, clubs were required to play the full schedule of games, instead of forfeiting scheduled games when the club was no longer in the running for the league championship, which happened frequently under the National Association. A concerted effort was made to curb gambling on games which was leaving the validity of results in doubt.

The early years of the National League were tumultuous, with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated "reserve clause", which restricted the free movement of players between clubs. Competitive leagues formed regularly, and also disbanded regularly. The most successful was the American Association (1881<U+2013>1891), sometimes called the "beer and whiskey league" for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators. For several years, the National League and American Association champions met in a postseason championship series<U+2014>the first attempt at a [[Baseball/World Series|World Series]].

The [[Union Association]] survived for only one season (1884), as did the [[Players League]] (1890).<ref name="u">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/UA_1884.shtml|title=1884 Union Association|accessdate=2008-09-08|author=|year=|publisher=[[baseball-reference.com]]}}</ref><ref name="players league">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/PL_1890.shtml|title=1890 Players League |accessdate=2008-09-08|author=|year=|publisher=baseball-reference.com}}</ref> Both leagues are considered major leagues by many baseball researchers because of the perceived high caliber of play (for a brief time anyway) and the number of star players featured. However, some researchers have disputed the major-league status of the Union Association, pointing out that franchises came and went and contending that the St. Louis club, which was deliberately "stacked" by the league's president (who owned that club), was the only club that was anywhere close to major-league caliber.<ref name="union">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/unfiltered/?p=324|title=NerdFight: League Quality Adjustments|accessdate=2008-09-08|author=[[Nate Silver|Silver, Nate]]|year=2007|publisher=Baseball Prospectus}}</ref>
[[Image:1896 Baltimore Orioles.jpg|thumb|left|300px|National League [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|''Baltimore Orioles'']], 1896]]
There were dozens of leagues, large and small, at this time. What made the National League "major" was its dominant position in the major cities, particularly New York City. The large cities offered baseball teams national media distribution systems and fan bases that could generate revenues, enabling teams to hire the best players in the country.

The resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes. One of the most famous involved star second baseman [[Napoleon Lajoie]], who in 1901 went across town in Philadelphia from the National League Phillies to the American League Athletics. Barred by a court injunction from playing baseball in the state of Pennsylvania the following year, Lajoie was traded to the Cleveland team, where he played and managed for many years.<ref name="nap">{{cite web|url=http://www.docheritage.state.pa.us/documents/baseball.asp|title=The National Pastime |accessdate=2008-09-10|author=|year=|publisher=Doc Heritage}}</ref>

The war between the American and National leagues caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting at the Leland Hotel in Chicago in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. On September 5, 1901, [[Patrick T. Powers]], president of the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]], announced the formation of the second [[Minor League Baseball|National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues]], the NAPBL or "NA" for short.<ref name="hotel">{{cite web|url=http://www.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/|title=Minor League Baseball History |accessdate=2008-09-10|author=|year=|publisher=roadsidephotos.sabr.org}}</ref>

Ban Johnson had other designs for the NA. While the NA continues to this day (known as "[[Minor League Baseball]]"), he saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might some day want to expand in other territories and threaten his league's dominance.

After 1902, the three leagues<U+2014>the NL, the AL, and the NAPBL<U+2014>signed a new National Agreement. The new agreement tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause national league contracts. Baseball players became a commodity. The agreement also set up a formal classification system for independent minor leagues that regulated the dollar value of contracts, the forerunner of the system refined by [[Branch Rickey]] that is still used today.<ref name="nabpl">{{cite web|url=http://roadsidephotos.sabr.org/baseball/1903NatAgree.htm|title=1903 National Agreement |accessdate=2008-09-10|author=|year=|publisher=minorleaguebaseball.com}}</ref>

It also gave the NA great power. Many independents walked away from the 1901 meeting. The deal with the NA punished those other indies who had not joined the NA and submitted to the will of the 'majors.' The NA also agreed to the deal to prevent more pilfering of players with little or no compensation for the players' development. Several leagues, seeing the writing on the wall, eventually joined the NA, which grew in size over the next several years.

===Dead-ball era===
[[Image:Cy young.jpg|thumb|125px|Cy Young, 1911 baseball card]]
{{Main|Dead-ball era}}
At this time the games tended to be low scoring, dominated by such pitchers as [[Walter Johnson]], [[Cy Young]], [[Christy Mathewson]], [[Mordecai Brown]], and [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]], to the extent that the period 1900<U+2013>1919 is commonly called the "dead-ball era". The term also accurately describes the condition of the "baseball". A baseball cost three dollars, a hefty sum then equal to ${{Inflation|US|3|1919|r=2}} today (in [[inflation|inflation-adjusted]] [[US dollars]]). Club owners were therefore reluctant to spend much money on new balls, if not necessary. It was not unusual for a single baseball to last an entire game, by the end of which, the ball would be dark with grass, mud, and tobacco stains, and misshapen from contact with the bat. Balls were replaced only if they were hit into the crowd and lost, and many clubs employed security guards solely to retrieve balls hit into the stands.

Home runs were thus rare, and "small ball"<U+2014>singles, [[Bunt (baseball)|bunts]], [[stolen base]]s, the hit-and-run play, and other tactics<U+2014>dominated the strategies of the time.<ref>Daniel Okrent, Harris Lewine, David Nemec (2000) "The Ultimate Baseball Book", Houghton Mifflin Books,ISBN 0-618-05668-8 [http://books.google.com/books?id=mAbGN_1cmhcC&pg=PA33&dq=%22inside+baseball%22&sig=z_sYnAJ_Xovf2TTNN0l_cD_EZB0#PPA33,M1 , p. 33].</ref> Hitting methods, like the [[Baltimore Chop]], were used to increase the number of infield singles.<ref>Burt Solomon (2000) "Where They Ain't: The Fabled Life And Untimely Death Of The Original Baltimore Orioles", Simon and Schuster, ISBN 0-684-85917-3 [http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/where_they_aint.stm Excerpt].</ref>

The foul strike rule was a major rule change that, in just a few years, sent baseball from a high-scoring game to one where scoring runs became a struggle. Prior to this rule, foul balls were not counted as strikes: a batter could foul off any number of pitches with no strikes counted against him; this gave an enormous advantage to the batter. In 1901, the National League adopted the foul strike rule, and the American League followed suit in 1903.

===The World War II era===
On January 14, 1942, Major League Baseball Commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] wrote a letter to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] regarding the continuation of baseball during the war, called the Green Light Letter. In this letter, the commissioner pleaded for the continuation of baseball in hopes for a start of a new Major League season. President Roosevelt responds "I honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going. There will be fewer people unemployed and everybody will work longer hours and harder than ever before. And that means that they ought to have a chance for recreation and for taking their minds off their work even more than before."<ref>Roosevelt, Franklin. <U+201C>Green Light Letter<U+201D>. January 15, 1942.</ref>

With the approval of President Roosevelt, Major League Baseball began its spring training in 1942 with little repercussions. Although some men were being pulled away from the baseball fields and sent to the battlefield, baseball continued to field teams.

===Breaking the Color Barrier===
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2010}}
In the mid-1940s, [[Branch Rickey]], president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began to scout the Negro leagues for a possible roster addition. Rickey selected [[Jackie Robinson]] from a list of promising African-American players. Rickey was especially interested in making sure his signee could withstand any racial abuse that would be directed at him.  After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to "turn the other cheek" to racial antagonism, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month.   In what was later referred to as "The Noble Experiment", Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s, joining the Dodgers' farm club, the Montreal Royals, for the 1946 season.

The following year, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues. On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, including more than 14,000 black patrons. Black baseball fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning their Negro league teams which they had followed exclusively.  Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players.  Manager [[Leo Durocher]] informed his team, "I do not care if the guy is yellow or black...I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded.".

After a strike threat by some players, National League President [[Ford Frick]] and Baseball Commissioner [[Happy Chandler]] let it be known that any striking players would be suspended. Robinson received significant encouragement from several major league players. Dodgers teammate [[Pee Wee Reese]] once came to Robinson's defense with the famous line, "You can hate a man for many reasons. Color is not one of them."   

That year, Robinson earned the inaugural [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award]] (separate National League and American League rookie of the year honors were awarded until 1949).[128]

The next year, racial pressure on Robinson eased, as a number of other black players entered the major leagues. [[Larry Doby]] and [[Satchel Paige]] were signed by the Cleveland Indians, and the Dodgers added three other black players besides Robinson.

===Expanding west, south and north===
{{main|Major League Baseball relocation of 1950s-1960s}}
[[Image:Dodger-Stadium-Panorama-052707.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dodger Stadium]] in 2007]]

For half a century, from 1903 to 1953, the two major leagues consisted of two eight team leagues.  The 16 teams were located in just ten cities, all in the northeastern and midwestern United States: [[New York City]] had three teams and [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[St. Louis]] each had two teams. St. Louis was the southernmost and westernmost city with a major league team.  The longest possible road trip, from Boston to St. Louis, took about 24 hours by [[railroad]].
The era of expansion and realignment began in 1953 when the National League's Boston Braves became the [[Milwaukee Braves]].  In 1954, the St. Louis Browns became the [[Baltimore Orioles]].  In 1955, the Philadelphia Athletics became the [[Kansas City Athletics]].  These were three of the least successful major league franchises, even though the Braves were usually an above-.500 team, and they and the Browns had each won a league championship during the 1940s.  These three moves were not controversial.  The next pair of franchise moves is still controversial.

Baseball experts consider the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers' boss [[Walter O'Malley]] to be "perhaps the most influential owner of baseball's early expansion era."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071203&content_id=5714&vkey=hof_pr|title=Veterans elect five into Hall of Fame: Two managers, three executives comprise Class of 2008|accessdate=2008-01-19|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc.|date=2007-12-03}}</ref> Before the [[1958 Major League Baseball season]], he moved the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] to [[Los Angeles]]. <ref name=FYOL/> When O'Malley moved the Dodgers from Brooklyn, the story transcended the world of sport and he found himself on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19580428,00.html|title=Walter O'Malley|accessdate=2008-04-28|date=1958-04-28|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> The [[cover art]] for the issue was created by sports cartoonist [[Willard Mullin]],<ref name=SC>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868739,00.html|title=Sporting Cartoons|date=1958-08-25|accessdate=2008-04-30|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> long noted for his caricature of the "Brooklyn Bum" that personified the team.

Two new teams were added to the American League at the same time: the [[Los Angeles Angels]] (who soon moved from downtown L.A. to nearby [[Anaheim]]) and a new "second" [[Washington Senators]] franchise.  The National League followed suit by adding the   [[Houston Astros]] and the [[New York Mets]] in 1962.  The Astros (known as the "Colt. 45s" during their first three seasons) became the first southern major league franchise since the [[Louisville Colonels]] folded in 1899.  The Mets established a reputation for futility by going 40-120 during their first season of play in the nation's media capital<U+2014> and by playing only a little better in subsequent campaigns<U+2014> but in their eighth season (1969) the Mets became the first of the 1960s expansion teams to win a [[World Series]].

In 1966, Major League Baseball moved to the "Deep South" when the Braves moved to [[Atlanta Braves|Atlanta]].  In 1968, the Kansas City Athletics moved west to become the [[Oakland Athletics]]. 

In 1969, the two Major Leagues added two teams each.  The American League added the [[Seattle Pilots]] (who became the Milwaukee Brewers after one disastrous season in Seattle) and the [[Kansas City Royals]].  The National League added the first Canadian franchise, the [[Montreal Expos]] as well as the [[San Diego Padres]].

In 1972, the [[Washington Senators]] moved to Dallas-Forth Worth to become the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].  In 1977, baseball added a second Canadian team, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], as well as the [[Seattle Mariners]].  This marked the end of the expansion era: no new teams were added and no teams moved until the 1990s.  In 1993, the National League added the Miami-based [[Florida Marlins]] and the Denver-based [[Colorado Rockies]].  In 1998, the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] switched leagues by joining the [[National League]] and two new teams were added: the National League's [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] (based in Phoenix) and the American League's [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] (based in St. Petersburg, Fla.).

After the 2001 season, the team owners actually voted in favor of contraction.  The  [[Montreal Expos]]  and the [[Minnesota Twins]] were expected to be the two teams which would cease to exist.  Thanks to lawsuits from various parties, this plan was first delayed and finally killed  for good in June 2002.  The Twins ironically finished in first place in 2002. 

The Expos became the first franchise in over three decades to move when they became the [[Washington Nationals]] in 2005.  This move left Canada with just one team, but it also returned baseball to the United States capital city after a  33-year absence.  (Ironically, the President of the United States at the time, [[George W. Bush]], had been a co-owner of the team which had previously abandoned Washington, DC, i.e., the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].  However, he bought his share of the Rangers franchise long after it moved to Texas.) <ref>{{citeweb |title=Washington Nationals |publisher=Baseball Almanac Online |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teams/washington_nationals.shtml |accessdate=2010-06-07}}</ref> This franchise shift, like many previous ones, involved baseball's return to a city which had been previously abandoned.  Although there are a number of cities which permanently lost major league baseball in the 19th century, since 1901 only Montreal has lost its major league team without eventually getting another one.  (This is not counting the short-lived [[Federal League]].  However, the two established leagues have only passed over two Federal League markets<U+2014> [[Buffalo Buffeds/Blues|Buffalo]] and [[Indianapolis Hoosiers|Indianapolis]].)

===Pitching dominance and rules changes===
[[Image:MLB runs.png|thumb|Graph showing the yearly number of runs per MLB game|250px]]
By the late 1960s, the balance between pitching and hitting had swung in favor of the pitchers. In 1968<U+2014>later nicknamed "the year of the pitcher"<ref name="yearofthepitcher">"[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/1998/08/04/1968_pitchers/ 1968 -- The Year of the Pitcher]" ''Sports Illustrated'', 4 August 1998.</ref><U+2014>[[Boston Red Sox]] player [[Carl Yastrzemski]] won the American League batting title with an average of just .301, the lowest in history.<ref name="yaz">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hibavg3.shtml|title=Year by Year Leaders for Batting Average|accessdate=2008-09-08|author=|year=|publisher=baseball-almanac.com}}</ref> [[Detroit Tigers]] pitcher [[Denny McLain]] won 31 games, making him the first pitcher to win 30 games in a season since [[Dizzy Dean]].<ref name="denny">{{cite web|url=http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=162|title=When Denny McLain stood baseball on its ear |accessdate=2008-09-08|author=Bailey, Mary|year=2000|publisher=The Detroit News}}</ref> [[St. Louis Cardinals]] starting pitcher [[Bob Gibson]] achieved an equally remarkable feat by allowing an ERA of just 1.12.<ref name="gibson">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/g/gibsobo01.shtml|title=Bob Gibson Statistics |accessdate=2008-09-08|author=|year=|publisher=baseball-reference.com}}</ref>

Following these pitching performances, in December 1968 the rules committee voted to reduce the strike zone from knees to shoulders to top of knees to armpits and lower the pitcher's mound from 15 to 10&nbsp;inches, beginning in the 1969 season.<ref name="mound">{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082211/index.htm|title=From Mountain To Molehill |accessdate=2009-03-09|author=William Leggett|year=1969|publisher=Sports Illustrated | date=1969-03-24}}</ref>

In 1973 the American League, which had been suffering from much lower attendance than the National League, sought to increase scoring even further by initiating the [[designated hitter]] (DH) rule.<ref name="dh">{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2003/0327/1530427.html|title=Blomberg first permanent pinch-hitter |accessdate=2008-09-08|author=Merron, Jeff|year=2003|publisher=espn.com}}</ref>

===Power age===
Routinely in the late 1990s and early 2000s, baseball players hit 40 or 50 home runs in a season, a feat that was considered rare even in the 1980s. It has become apparent since that at least some of this power surge was a result of players using steroids and other performance enhancing drugs such as human growth hormone. Many modern baseball theorists believe that the need of pitchers to combat the rise in power could lead to a pitching revolution at some point. New pitches, such as the mysterious<ref name="gyroball">{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=jp-gyro031306&prov=yhoo&type=lgns|title=Searching for baseball's Bigfoot|accessdate=2008-09-06|author=Passan, Jeff|year=2006|publisher=Yahoo Sports}}</ref> [[gyroball]], could shift the balance of power back to the defensive side. A pitching revolution would not be unprecedented; several pitches have changed the game of baseball, including the [[slider]] in the '50s and '60s and the [[Fastball#Split-finger fastball|split-fingered fastball]] in the '70s to '90s. Since the 1990s, the [[changeup]] has made a resurgence, being thrown masterfully by pitchers such as [[Jamie Moyer]], [[Trevor Hoffman]], [[Greg Maddux]], [[Tom Glavine]], [[Johan Santana]], [[Cole Hamels]], [[Pedro Martinez]], [[Tim Lincecum]], and rookie [[Stephen Strasburg]].<ref name="maddux">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FIH/is_n5_v65/ai_n18606862|title=What makes Greg Maddux so good and can we teach it?|accessdate=2008-09-09|author=Mazzoni, Wayne|year=1995|publisher=findarticles.com}}</ref><ref name="glavine">{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/anatomy-of-a-player-tom-glavine/|title=Anatomy of a player: Tom Glavine|accessdate=2008-09-09|author=Kalk, Josh|year=2007|publisher=hardballtimes.com}}</ref><ref name="santana">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/sports/baseball/03santana.html?_r=1&ex=1205211600&en=32bc22a3d855ca04&ei=5070&emc=eta1&oref=slogin|title=Santana<U+2019>s Changeup: Hitters Never See It Coming|accessdate=2008-09-09|author=Curry, Jack|year=2008|publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=2008-03-03}}</ref>

==MLB uniforms==
[[Image:Baseball1870s.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A baseball team and its uniforms in the 1870s.]]
{{Main|Major League Baseball uniforms}}
A [[baseball uniform]] is a type of [[uniform]] worn by [[position player|baseball players]], and by some non-playing personnel, such as [[Manager (baseball)|field managers]] and [[Coach (sport)|coaches]]. It is worn to indicate the person's role in the game and&nbsp;<U+2014> through the use of [[logo]]s, colors, and [[uniform number (Major League Baseball)|numbers]]&nbsp;<U+2014> to identify the teams and their players, managers, and coaches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/57907 |title=The American Chronicle |publisher=www.americanchronicle.com|accessdate=2008-06-25|author = Robert Riles | date =April 8, 2008}}</ref>

The New York Knickerbockers were the first baseball team to use uniforms, taking the field on April 4, 1849, in pants made of blue wool, white [[flannel]] shirts ([[jersey (clothing)#In sports|jerseys]]) and [[straw hat]]s.<ref name=articlesbase/><ref name=articlesbase>{{citeweb|url=http://www.articlesbase.com/baseball-articles/history-of-baseball-uniforms-in-the-major-leagues-126428.html|title=Baseball Uniforms in the Major Leagues: The Evolution of the Battle Suit|publisher=www.articlesbase.com|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.19cbaseball.com/sessearch.php?q=uniforms|title=Date when the New York Knickerbockers wore the first baseball uniforms and what they were made of|publisher=iterpret.co.za|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://interpret.co.za/art/Recreation-and-Sport/Baseball/history_of_baseball_uniforms_in_the_major_leagues.php|title=History Of Baseball Uniforms In The Major Leagues|publisher=interpret.co.za|accessdate=2008-05-02|last=|first=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/introduction.htm|title=The history of the baseball uniform at the National Baseball Hall of Fame|publisher=exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org|accessdate=2008-06-14}}</ref> The practice of wearing a uniform soon spread, and by 1900, all major league teams had adopted them.

[[baseball cap|Caps]], or other types of headgear with eyeshades, have been a part of baseball uniforms from the beginning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55808234.html|title=A short history of the baseball cap.(The Home Forum) - The Christian Science Monitor&nbsp;<U+2014> HighBeam Research|publisher=www.highbeam.com|accessdate=2008-05-02|last=|first=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3660333.stm|title= Happy 50th, baseball caps|work=BBC News |accessdate=2008-05-02|last=|first= | date=2004-04-27}}</ref> Baseball teams often wore full-brimmed straw hats or no cap at all since there was no official rule regarding headgear.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070827&content_id=2174187&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=Celebrating the rich history of baseball caps|publisher=mlb.mlb.com|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref> Completing the baseball uniform are cleats and stockings, both of which have also been around for a long time.

By the end of the 19th century, teams began the practice of having two different uniforms, one for when they played at home in their own [[Baseball park|baseball stadium]] and a different one for when they played away ([[Road game|on the road]]) at the other team's ballpark. It became common to wear white pants with a white color vest at home and gray pants with a gray or solid color vest when away. Most teams also have one or more [[third jersey|alternate uniforms]], usually consisting of the primary or secondary team color on the vest instead of the usual white or gray. Teams on occasion will also wear [[throwback uniform]]s.

Traditionally home uniforms have displayed the team name on the front, while away uniforms have displayed the name of the city (or state) that the team is from. There are many exceptions to that rule, however.

==Season structure==
{{Main|Major League Baseball schedule}}

===Spring training===
{{Main|Spring training}}
[[Image:Spring training.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Grapefruit League game at the LA Dodgers camp in [[Vero Beach, Florida]]]]
Spring training is a series of practices and exhibition games preceding the start of the [[regular season]]. [[Spring training]] allows new players to audition for roster and position spots, and gives existing team players practice time prior to competitive play. Spring training has always attracted fan attention, drawing crowds who travel to the warmer climates to enjoy the weather and watch their favorite teams play, and spring training usually coincides with [[spring break]] for many college students. Autograph seekers also find greater access to players during Spring Training.

Spring training typically lasts almost two months, starting in mid February and running until just before the season opening day (and often right at the end of spring training, some teams will play spring training games on the same day other teams have opening day of the season), traditionally the first week of April. Pitchers and catchers report to spring training first because pitchers benefit from a longer training period due to the exhaustive nature of the position. A week or two later, the [[position player]]s arrive and team practice begins.

===Regular Season===
The current MLB regular season is a 162 game schedule, organized into [[series]] of normally 3 games, but they can also be 2 or 4 games long. These series are organized into '''homestands''' and '''road trips''', that group multiple series together. Teams generally play games six days per week, commonly having Monday or Thursday as an off day. Frequently, games are scheduled at [[Night_game#Baseball|night]], but during the vacation months of June, July, and August, more day games are played. From mid-May into late-June teams participate in [[Interleague_play|Interleague Play]] in which fans get the chance to see teams that rarely play each other. Over the course of a season teams are competing for 1 of the 4 [[Playoffs |playoff]] berths in their league. They can win one of these berths by either winning the [[MLB#League_organization|division]] they are in, or by capturing a [[Wild_card_(sports)#Major_League_Baseball|wild card]]. In many seasons, post-season teams are not determined until the very end of the season, while in other years, a post-season team can be decided as early as August.

===All-Star Game===
{{Main|Major League Baseball All-Star Game}}
[[Image:Kennedy 1962 All Star Game.gif|right|thumb|300px|President [[John F. Kennedy]] throwing out the first pitch at the 1962 All-Star Game.]]
In early July&nbsp;<U+2014> just after the midway point of the season&nbsp;<U+2014> a three-day break is taken and the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] is held. The All-Star game features a team of players from the National League (NL)&nbsp;<U+2014> led by the manager of the previous NL [[World Series]] team&nbsp;<U+2014> and a team of players from the American League (AL), similarly managed, in an exhibition game. From 1959 to 1961, two games were held, one in July and one in August.  The designated-hitter rule was used in the All-Star game for the first time in 1989. Following games used a DH when the game was played in an AL ballpark. Starting in 2010, the DH rule will be in effect regardless of venue.

The 2002 contest in Milwaukee controversially ended in an 11-inning tie.  Since 2003, the league which wins the All-Star game gets [[home advantage|home-field advantage]] in the World Series: the league champion hosts the first two games at its own ballpark as well as the last two (if necessary.)  2010 will mark the first time that a National League champion benefits from this rule.  The National League did, however, manage to win three out of the seven World Series played between 2003 and 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2003_WS.shtml |title=2003 World Series (4-2): Florida Marlins (91-71) over New York Yankees (101-61) |accessdate=2008-09-06 |work= |publisher=''baseball-reference.com'' |date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/20036WS.shtml |title=2006 World Series (4-1): St. Louis Cardinals (83-78) over Detroit Tigers (95-67) |accessdate=2008-09-06 |work= |publisher=''baseball-reference.com'' |date= }}</ref>

The first All-Star Game was held as part of the [[Century of Progress|1933 World's Fair]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and was the brainchild of [[Arch Ward]], then sports editor for ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://baseball-almanac.com/asgmenu.shtml |title=All-Star Game History |accessdate=2008-09-07 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}</ref> Initially intended to be a one-time event, its great success resulted in making the game an annual one. Ward's contribution was recognized by Major League Baseball in 1962 with the creation of the "Arch Ward Trophy", given to the All-Star Game's [[most valuable player]] each year.<ref>Newman, Mark. "[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060710&content_id=1550905&vkey=allstar2006&fext=.jsp All-Star MVP Awaits Your Vote]", [[MLB.com]], July 10, 2006.</ref> (In 2002, this was renamed the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award]].)

Beginning in 1947, the eight position players in each team's starting lineup have been voted into the game by fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgmenu.shtml |title=All-Star Game |accessdate=2008-09-06 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}</ref> The fan voting was discontinued after a 1957 ballot-box-stuffing scandal in Cincinnati: seven of the eight slots originally went to [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]] players, two of whom were subsequently removed from the lineup to make room for [[Willie Mays]] and [[Henry Aaron]]. Fan voting was reinstated in 1970 and has continued ever since, including [[Internet]] voting in recent years.<!-- in this context, it is the proper noun, so needs to be capitalized --> 

From the first All-Star Game, players have worn their regular team uniforms, with one exception: In the first game, the National League players wore uniforms made for the game, with the lettering "National League" across the front of the shirt.<ref name="The World Series and Highlights of Baseball">{{cite book| last = Lamont| first = Buchanan| title = The World Series and Highlights of Baseball| publisher = E.

When the regular season ends after the first Sunday in October (or the last Sunday in September), eight teams enter the post-season playoffs. Six teams are division champions; the remaining two "wild-card" spots are filled by the team in each league that has the best record but is not a division champion (best second-place team). Three rounds of series of games are played to determine the champion:

# [[American League Division Series]] and [[National League Division Series]], each a best-of-five-games series.
# [[American League Championship Series]] and [[National League Championship Series]], each a best-of-seven-games series played between the surviving teams from the ALDS and NLDS.
# [[World Series]], a best-of-seven-games series played between the champions of each league.

Within each league, the division winners are the #1, #2 and #3 seeds, based on win/loss records. The wild-card team is the #4 seed&nbsp;<U+2014> regardless of its record&nbsp;<U+2014> and is paired against the highest seed outside of its own division in the first round of the playoffs, while the remaining two division champions play each other. In the first two rounds, the better-seeded team has home-field advantage, regardless of record.<ref name="playoff stages">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/postseason.shtml|title=Baseball Postseason Playoffs|accessdate=2008-09-10|author=|year=|publisher=baseball-almanac.com}}</ref>

The team belonging to the league that won the mid-season [[All-Star Game]] receives home-field advantage in the World Series.

Because each postseason series is split between the two teams' home fields, "home-field advantage" theoretically does not play a significant role unless the series goes to its maximum number of games, in which case the final game takes place on the field of the team holding the advantage. "Home-field advantage", however, ''can'' play a role, if the team with home-field advantage wins the first two games (at home),<ref name="[[World Series]]">, [[World Series]], sec. 3.2.2 (Game-by-Game), note 2; As of 2008, the 1981 Los Angeles Dodgers are the last team to win a World Series after losing the first two games on the road.</ref> thereby gaining some "momentum" for the rest of the Series.<ref name="alds">{{cite web|url=http://pressbox.mlb.com/pressbox/news/pressbox_story.jsp?ymd=20070514&content_id=1964536&vkey=pressbox&fext=.jsp|title=Major League Baseball announces revamped postseason schedule|accessdate=2008-09-07|author=|year=2007|publisher=mlb.com}}</ref>

==International play==
Since {{by|1986}}, a team of Major League Baseball All-Stars has made a biennial end-of-the-season tour of Japan, playing exhibition games against the [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] All-Stars in the [[Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series|MLB Japan All-Star Series]]. Starting in 1992 and continuing intermittently, several Major League Baseball teams have played exhibition games against Japanese teams.<ref>See [[Professional baseball in Japan#International play]].</ref>

In {{mlby|2008}}, Major League Baseball played the [[Major League Baseball China Series|MLB China Series]] in the People's Republic of China. It was a series of two spring-training games played by the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers. The games were an effort to popularize baseball in China.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-03-03-voa35.cfm "MLB, China Baseball League Team to Tour China"], VOAnews.com, Mar. 3, 2005.

The original steroid policy provided for a 10-game suspension for a first positive test, a 30-game suspension for a second positive test, a 60-game suspension for a third positive test, a one year suspension for a fourth positive test, and a penalty at the commissioner<U+2019>s discretion for a fifth positive test.

A former [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]], [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[United States Attorney|prosecutor]], and ex-[[Chair (official)|chairman]] of [[The Walt Disney Company]], George Mitchell was appointed by [[Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Bud Selig]] on March 30, 2006<ref name = "MLB_pre">{{cite news|author=Barry M.

The appointment was made after several influential members of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] made negative comments about both the effectiveness and honesty of MLB's [[Major League Baseball drug policy|drug policies]] and Commissioner Selig.<ref name = "NYT_20071213" />

According to the report, after mandatory random testing began in 2004, [[HGH Treatment for Athletic Enhancement]] became popular among players, as HGH is not detectable in tests, though the Mitchell report was careful to point out that HGH is likely a placebo with no performance enhancing effects.<ref name = "report_pg_SR2">{{cite web | url = http://files.mlb.com/mitchrpt.pdf | title = Mitchell Report | format = PDF | page = SR2 | accessdate = 2007-12-13 }}</ref> Also, at least one player from each of the thirty Major League Baseball teams was involved in the alleged violations.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mitchell report: Baseball slow to react to players' steroid use |publisher=ESPN.com |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3153509 |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2007-12-13 }}</ref>

On December 12, 2007, the day before the report was to be released, Bud Selig said, regarding his decision to commission the report, "I haven't seen the report yet, but I'm proud I did it."<ref name = "Chicago Tribune 20071212">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/cs-071212report,1,5400599.story?ctrack=1&cset=true |title=Mitchell report will assess the damage done |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |author=Phil Rogers |date=2007-12-12|accessdate=2007-12-13}}</ref><ref name = "espn">{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3152573 |title=Sources: Players, owners to share blame in Mitchell report |publisher=espn.com |firstname=T.J |lastname=Quinn |coauthors=Mark Fainaru-Wada |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2007-12-13 }}</ref>

According to [[ESPN]], some people questioned whether Mitchell being a director of the [[Boston Red Sox]] created a [[conflict of interest]], especially because no "prime [Sox] players were in the report." Mitchell described his role with the team as that of a "consultant".<ref name = "report_pg_A1">{{cite web | url = http://files.mlb.com/mitchrpt.pdf | title = Mitchell Report | format = PDF | page = A1 | accessdate = 2007-12-31 }}</ref> Despite the lack of "prime" Boston players, the report had named several prominent Yankees who were parts of [[World Series]] clubs. This made some people feel that there was a conflict of interest on Mitchell's part, due to the fierce [[Red Sox <U+2013> Yankees rivalry|rivalry]] between the two teams. [[Cleveland Indians]] pitcher [[Paul Byrd]], along with his teammates, felt the timing of publicizing Byrd's alleged use was suspicious, as the information was [[News leak|leaked]] prior to the deciding Game 7 of the [[2007 American League Championship Series]] between the Indians and the Red Sox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/7365076|author=Ken Rosenthal|title=Mitchell investigation raises questions |date=2007-10-23|accessdate=2007-12-24|publisher=Fox Sports}}</ref> Former U.S. prosecutor [[John M. Dowd]] also brought up allegations of Mitchell's conflict of interest. Dowd, who had defended Senator [[John McCain]] of [[Arizona]] during the [[Keating Five]] investigation in the late 1980s, cited how he took exception to Mitchell's scolding of McCain and others for having a conflict of interest with their actions in the case and how the baseball investigation would be a "burden" for him when Mitchell was named to lead it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2006-03-30-mitchell-role_x.htm|author=Mike Dodd|title=Is George Mitchell independent enough?|date=2006-03-31|accessdate=2007-12-24|publisher=USA Today}}</ref> After the investigation, Dowd later told the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' that he was convinced the former Senator has done a good job.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/baseball/bal-mitchell1212,0,7812674.story|author=Childs Walker|title=Some question Mitchell as report draws near|date=2007-12-11|accessdate=2007-12-24|publisher=Baltrimore Sun}}</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Mitchell acknowledged that his "tight relationship with Major League Baseball left him open to criticism".<ref name=gregjohnson>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/mlb/la-sp-mitchellbio14dec14,1,6912601.story?coll=la-headlines-sports-majorbaseb&ctrack=1&cset=true|author=Greg Johnson|title=Mitchell cites unbiased history|date=2007-12-14|accessdate=2007-12-19|publisher=The Los Angeles Times}}</ref> Mitchell responded to the concerns by stating that readers who examined the report closely "will not find any evidence of bias, of special treatment of the Red Sox".<ref name=gregjohnson/>

The current MLB drug policy provides for a 50-game suspension for a first positive test, a 100-game suspension for a second positive test, and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test<ref>http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090507&content_id=4603850&vkey=news_la&fext=.jsp&c_id=la</ref>.

Since the opening of the 2009 season, Major League Baseball and its fans have been rocked by the steroid allegations against [[Alex Rodriguez]] and [[David Ortiz]] and the positive test result and 50-game suspension of [[Manny Ramirez]], three of baseball's biggest stars.

==Major League Baseball in media==
===Blackout policy===
[[Image:MLB Blackout Areas.png|right|thumb|300px|MLB Blackout map in the United States]]
{{Main|Major League Baseball blackout policy}}
{{See also|Syndication exclusivity}}
Major League Baseball has several [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] rules.
A local broadcaster has priority to televise games of the team in their market over national broadcasters. For example, at one time [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] showed many [[Atlanta Braves]] games nationally and internationally in Canada. [[Fox Sports Net]] (FSN) also shows many games in other areas. If the Braves played a team that FSN or another local broadcaster showed, the local station will have the broadcast rights for its own local market, while TBS would have been blacked out in the same market during the game. A market that has a local team playing in a weekday [[ESPN]] or [[ESPN2]] game and is shown on a local station will see [[ESPNews]], or, in the past, another game scheduled on ESPN or ESPN2 at the same time (if ESPN or ESPN2 operates a regional coverage broadcasting and operates a game choice), or will be subject to an alternative programming feed. MLB's streaming Internet video service is also subject to the same blackout rules.

===MLB on television===
{{Main|Major League Baseball television contracts}}
Major League Baseball is in the transition to a new set of television contracts. The league has three current broadcast partners: Fox, ESPN and TBS.

It was announced on July 11, 2006 that [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] will remain with MLB through 2013 and broadcast ''[[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox Saturday Baseball]]'' throughout the entire season, rather than the previous May to September format.<ref name="fox">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2516552|title=Fox, TBS have seven-year, $3 billion TV deal with MLB|accessdate=2008-09-06|author=|year=2006|publisher=espn.com}}</ref> Fox will also hold rights to the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] each season. Fox will also alternate League Championship Series broadcasts, broadcasting the [[American League Championship Series]] in [[Even and odd numbers|odd-numbered]] years and the [[National League Championship Series]] in [[Even and odd numbers|even-numbered]] years as part of the new contract. Fox will continue to broadcast all games of the [[World Series]], which will begin on a Wednesday evening rather than the current Saturday evening format.

[[ESPN]] will continue to broadcast Major League Baseball through 2013 as well, beginning with national Opening Day coverage.<ref name="espn">{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=mlbespn&prov=st&type=lgns|title=MLB extends TV agreement with ESPN through 2013|accessdate=2008-09-06|author=|year=|publisher=Yahoo Sports}}</ref> ESPN will continue to broadcast ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'', ''[[Monday Night Baseball]]'', ''[[Wednesday Night Baseball]]'', and ''[[Baseball Tonight]]''. ESPN also has rights to the [[Home Run Derby]] at the All-Star Game each July.

[[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] will air [[Major League Baseball on TBS|Sunday afternoon regular season games]] (non-exclusive) nationally from 2008 to 2013. In 2007, TBS began its exclusive rights to any tiebreaker games that determine division or wild card champions at the end of each regular season in the event of a tie with one playoff spot remaining and exclusive coverage of the [[Division Series]] round of the playoffs.<ref name="tbs">{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2006-07-11-hiestand-mlb_x.htm?csp=34|title=TBS drops Braves games, joins Fox in rich TV deal|accessdate=2008-09-06|author=Michael Hiestand|year=2006|publisher=USA Today | date=2006-07-11}}</ref> TBS carries the [[League Championship Series]] that are not included under Fox's television agreement; TBS shows the [[National League Championship Series]] in [[Even and odd numbers|odd-numbered]] years and the [[American League Championship Series]] in [[Even and odd numbers|even-numbered]] years as part of the new contract through 2013.<ref name="tv">{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061017&content_id=1715532&vkey=ps2006news&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=TBS signs on to air LCS games|accessdate=2008-09-06|author=Barry M.

===MLB on radio===
{{Main|Major League Baseball on the radio}}

[[ESPN Radio]] holds national broadcast rights and broadcasts [[Sunday Night Baseball]] weekly throughout the season in addition to all playoff games. The rights to the World Series are exclusive to ESPN.

In addition, each team employs its own announcers, who broadcast during the regular season. Most teams operate regional networks to cover their fan base; some of these supposedly regional networks (such as the [[New York Yankees Radio Network]]) have a national reach with affiliates located across the United States.

Major League Baseball has an exclusive rights deal with [[XM Satellite Radio]], which includes the channel [[MLB Home Plate]] and live play-by-play of all games.
