A '''famine''' is a widespread scarcity of food,<ref>Scarcity and Poor Relief in Eighteenth-Century Ireland: The Subsistence Crisis of 1782-4, http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30008004?uid=3738032&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21100863504381, 20 June 2012</ref> caused by several factors including crop failure, population unbalance, or government policies. This phenomenon is usually accompanied or followed by regional [[malnutrition]], [[starvation]], [[epidemic]], and increased [[death|mortality]]. Nearly every continent in the world has experienced a period of famine throughout history. Some countries, particularly in sub-Sahara Africa, continue to have extreme cases of famine.

The [[famine relief]] model increasingly used by aid groups calls for giving [[cash]] or cash vouchers to the hungry to pay local [[farmer]]s instead of buying food from donor countries, as is often required by [[law]] (for example [[U.S.]] law requires that food aid money be spent on food grown in the U.S.), as it wastes money on transport costs,<ref name=csmonitor>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html|title=UN aid debate: give cash not food?|publisher=csmonitor.com|date=2008-06-04|accessdate=2011-06-22}}</ref><ref name=wfp>{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&Key=2899|title=Cash roll-out to help hunger hot spots|publisher=[[World Food Program]]|date=2008-12-08|accessdate=2011-06-22}}</ref> but more importantly, it perpetuates the cycle of dependency on foreign imports rather than helping to create real local stability through agricultural abundance. Emergency measures in relieving famine include providing high calorie ready-to-use [[therapeutic food]] (RUTF), through [[food fortification|fortified]] sachets of peanut-based paste such as [[Plumpy'nut]] that are given primarily to children.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8114750.stm|title=Firms target nutrition for the poor|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-06-24|accessdate=2011-06-22|first=Tatum|last=Anderson}}</ref>

Long-term measures include investment in modern [[agriculture]] techniques, such as [[fertilizers]] and [[irrigation]], which largely eradicated [[hunger]] in the [[developed world]].<ref name=obama>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/europe/09food.html "Obama enlists major powers to aid poor farmers with $15 billion"], ''New York Times'', 9 Jul 2009</ref> [[World Bank]] strictures restrict government subsidies for farmers, and increasing use of fertilizers is opposed by some environmental groups because of its unintended consequences: adverse effects on water supplies and habitat.<ref name=newyorktimes>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 "Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts"], ''New York Times'', 2 Dec 2007</ref><ref name=atlantic>[http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm Jan Borlaug, "Forgotten benefactor of humanity"], ''The Atlantic''</ref>

Sub-Saharan African countries the hardest, but with exhaustion of food resources, overdrafting of [[groundwater]], wars, internal struggles, and economic failure, famine continues to be a worldwide problem with hundreds of millions of people suffering.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0724/p01s01-wogi.html Rising food prices curb aid to global poor]</ref> These famines cause widespread malnutrition and impoverishment; The [[1984<U+2013>1985 famine in Ethiopia|famine in Ethiopia]] in the 1980s had an immense death toll, although Asian famines of the 20th century have also produced extensive death tolls. Modern African famines are characterized by widespread destitution and malnutrition, with heightened mortality confined to young children.
[[File:Famine in Algeria 1869.jpg|thumb|180px|A starving child during the 1869 famine in [[Algeria]].]]
Relief technologies including [[immunization]], improved [[public health]] infrastructure, general food rations and supplementary feeding for vulnerable children, has provided temporary mitigation to the mortality impacts of famines, while leaving their economic consequences unchanged, and not solving the underlying issue of too large a regional population relative to food production capability. Humanitarian crises may also arise from genocide campaigns, civil wars, refugee flows and episodes of extreme violence and state collapse, creating famine conditions among the affected populations.

Despite repeated stated intentions by the world's leaders to end hunger and famine, famine remains a chronic threat in much of Africa and Asia. In July 2005, the [[Famine Early Warning Systems Network]] labelled [[Niger]] with emergency status, as well as [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[South Sudan]], [[Somalia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. In January 2006, the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] warned that 11 million people in Somalia, [[Kenya]], [[Djibouti]] and Ethiopia were in danger of starvation due to the combination of severe drought and military conflicts.<ref>http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000206/index.html</ref> In 2006, the most serious humanitarian crisis in Africa was in [[Sudan]]'s region [[Darfur]].

The [[Green Revolution]] was widely viewed as an answer to famine in the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1950 and 1984, hybrid strains of high-yielding crops transformed agriculture around the globe and world grain production increased by 250%.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6496585.stm The limits of a Green Revolution?]</ref> Some{{who|date=August 2013}} criticize the process, stating that these new high-yielding crops require more chemical [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s, which can harm the environment.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Although these high-yielding crops make it technically possible to feed more people, there are indications that regional food production has peaked in many world sectors, due to certain strategies associated with intensive agriculture such as [[groundwater]] [[overdrafting]] and overuse of [[pesticide]]s and other agricultural chemicals.

[[Frances Moore Lapp<U+00E9>]], later co-founder of the [[Institute for Food and Development Policy]] (Food First) argued in ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'' (1971) that [[vegetarian]] diets can provide food for larger populations, with the same resources, compared to omnivorous diets.

Noting that modern famines are sometimes aggravated by misguided economic policies, political design to impoverish or marginalize certain populations, or acts of war, political economists have investigated the political conditions under which famine is prevented. Economist [[Amartya Sen]]{{#tag:ref|Sen is known for his assertion that famines do not occur in democracies in much the same way that [[Adam Smith]] is associated with the "[[invisible hand]]" and [[Joseph Schumpeter]] with "[[creative destruction]]".{{sfn|Massing|2003|p=1}}|group=note}} states that the liberal institutions that exist in India, including competitive elections and a free press, have played a major role in preventing famine in that country since independence. [[Alex de Waal]] has developed this theory to focus on the "political contract" between rulers and people that ensures famine prevention, noting the rarity of such political contracts in Africa, and the danger that international relief agencies will undermine such contracts through removing the locus of accountability for famines from national governments.

==Effects==

[[File:Russia Famine Saratov 1921.jpg|thumb|200px|A woman, a man and a child, all three dead from starvation. [[Russia]], 1921.]]
The demographic impacts of famine are sharp. Mortality is concentrated among children and the elderly. A consistent demographic fact is that in all recorded famines, male mortality exceeds female, even in those populations (such as northern India and Pakistan) where there is a male longevity advantage during normal times. Reasons for this may include greater female resilience under the pressure of malnutrition, and possibly female's naturally higher percentage of body fat. Famine is also accompanied by lower fertility. Famines therefore leave the reproductive core of a population<U+2014>adult women<U+2014>lesser affected compared to other population categories, and post-famine periods are often characterized a "rebound" with increased births. Even though the theories of [[Thomas Malthus]] would predict that famines reduce the size of the population commensurate with available food resources, in fact even the most severe famines have rarely dented population growth for more than a few years. The mortality in China in 1958<U+2013>61, Bengal in 1943, and Ethiopia in 1983<U+2013>85 was all made up by a growing population over just a few years. Of greater long-term demographic impact is emigration: Ireland was chiefly depopulated after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|1840s famines]] by waves of emigration.

== Levels of food insecurity ==

{{Main|Famine scales}}
In modern times, local and political governments and [[non-governmental organization]]s that deliver famine relief have limited resources with which to address the multiple situations of food insecurity that are occurring simultaneously.  Various methods of categorizing the gradations of food security have thus been used in order to most efficiently allocate food relief.  One of the earliest were the [[Indian Famine Codes]] devised by the British in the 1880s. The Codes listed three stages of food insecurity: near-scarcity, scarcity and famine, and were highly influential in the creation of subsequent famine warning or measurement systems.  The early warning system developed to monitor the region inhabited by the [[Turkana people]] in northern [[Kenya]] also has three levels, but links each stage to a pre-planned response to mitigate the crisis and prevent its deterioration

The experiences of famine relief organizations throughout the world over the 1980s and 1990s resulted in at least two major developments: the "livelihoods approach" and the increased use of nutrition indicators to determine the severity of a crisis. Individuals and groups in food stressful situations will attempt to cope by rationing consumption, finding alternative means to supplement [[income]], etc., before taking desperate measures, such as selling off plots of [[agriculture|agricultural]] land. When all means of self-support are exhausted, the affected population begins to migrate in search of food or fall victim to outright mass [[starvation]]. Famine may thus be viewed partially as a social phenomenon, involving [[market]]s, the price of food, and social support structures. A second lesson drawn was the increased use of rapid nutrition assessments, in particular of children, to give a quantitative measure of the famine's severity.

Since 2003, many of the most important organizations in famine relief, such as the [[World Food Programme]] and the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]], have adopted a five-level scale measuring intensity and magnitude. The intensity scale uses both livelihoods' measures and measurements of mortality and child malnutrition to categorize a situation as food secure, food insecure, food crisis, famine, severe famine, and extreme famine. The number of deaths determines the magnitude designation, with under 1000 fatalities defining a "minor famine" and a "catastrophic famine" resulting in over 1,000,000 deaths.

Definitions of famines are based on three different categories <U+2013> these include food supply-based, food consumption-based and mortality-based definitions. Some definitions of famines are:
* Blix <U+2013> Widespread food shortage leading to significant rise in regional death rates.{{sfn|Blix|Svensk n<U+00E4>ringsforskning|1971|p=}}
* Brown and Eckholm <U+2013> Sudden, sharp reduction in food supply resulting in widespread hunger.{{sfn|Brown|Eckholm|1974|p=}}
* Scrimshaw <U+2013> Sudden collapse in level of food consumption of large numbers of people.{{sfn|Scrimshaw|1987|p=}}
* Ravallion <U+2013> Unusually high mortality with unusually severe threat to food intake of some segments of a population.{{sfn|Ravallion|1996|p=2}}
* Cuny <U+2013> A set of conditions that occurs when large numbers of people in a region cannot obtain sufficient food, resulting in widespread, acute malnutrition.{{sfn|Cuny|1999|p=}}

Food shortages in a population are caused either by a lack of food or by difficulties in food distribution; it may be worsened by natural climate fluctuations and by extreme political conditions related to oppressive government or warfare. The conventional  explanation until 1981 for the cause of famines was the Food availability  decline (FAD) hypothesis. The assumption was that the central cause of all  famines was a decline in food availability.{{sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica|2010|p=}} However, FAD could not  explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by famines while others were insulated from famines.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} Based on the  studies of some recent famines, the decisive role of FAD has been questioned  and it has been suggested that the causal mechanism for precipitating  starvation includes many variables other than just decline of food  availability. According to this view, famines are a result of entitlements,  the theory being proposed is called the "failure of exchange  entitlements" or FEE.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} A person may own  various commodities that can be exchanged in a market economy for the other  commodities he or she needs. The exchange can happen via trading or  production or through a combination of the two. These entitlements are called  trade-based or production-based entitlements. Per this proposed view, famines  are precipitated due to a breakdown in the ability of the person to exchange his entitlements.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} An example of famines due to FEE is the inability of an agricultural laborer to exchange  his primary entitlement, i.e., labor for rice when his employment became  erratic or was completely eliminated.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}}

According to the Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), global [[climate change]] is additionally challenging the Earth's ability to produce food, potentially leading to famine.<ref name="Psrccaf">{{cite web|title=Climate Change and Famine|url=http://www.psr.org/resources/climate-change-and-famine.html|publisher=Physicians for Social Responsibility|accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref>

Some elements make a particular region more vulnerable to famine. These include poverty, [[population growth]],<ref>"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14291581 'Top 10 culprits' for Horn of Africa hunger]". BBC News. July 26, 2011.</ref> an inappropriate social infrastructure, a suppressive political regime, and a weak or under-prepared government.{{sfn|Ravallion|1996|p=1}}

=== State-sponsored famine ===
In certain cases, such as the [[Great Leap Forward]] in China (which produced the largest famine in absolute numbers), [[North Korean famine|North Korea in the mid-1990s]], or [[Zimbabwe]] in the early-2000s, famine can occur because of government policy. Few historians{{who|date=September 2013}} have argued that the [[Great Irish Famine]] was caused by the shortage of food, given that Ireland was producing enough food to feed its eight million people, but by the British government's choice to leave open the ports, as they are normally closed during Irish crop blights.

[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|The government's [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization]] of agriculture is considered a main reason for the [[Soviet famine of 1932<U+2013>1933]].]]
In 1932, under the USSR, [[Ukraine]] experienced one of their largest famines as a result of state sponsored famine. Termed [[Holodomor]], meaning killing by hunger, between 2.4 and 7.5 millions peasants died from a planned repression to eliminate protesters of collectivization as well. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Forced grain quotas imposed upon the rural peasants and brutal terror contributed to the widespread famine despite the large grain harvest and good weather. Soviets continued to deny the problem and did not provide for victims nor accept foreign aid.

In 1958 in China, [[Mao Zedong]]'s Communist Government began the [[Great Leap Forward]] campaign, aimed at rapidly industrializing the country.<ref name=NewYorkTimes>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/02/16/reviews/970216.16ebersta.html|
title=The Great Leap Backward|publisher=The New York Times|date=1997-02-16|accessdate=2011-10-22}}</ref> The government forcibly took control of agriculture. Barely enough grain was left for the peasants, and starvation set in many rural areas. Exportation of grain continued despite the famine to conceal the problem.  While the famine is attributed to unintended consequences, it is believed that the government refused to acknowledge the problem, thereby further contributing to the deaths. In many instances, peasants were persecuted. Between 20 to 45 million people perished in this famine, making it one of the most deadly famines to date.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html |title=Mao's Great Leap Forward 'killed 45 million in four years' |last=Akbar |first=Arifa |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2010 |location=London |work=The Independent}}</ref>

Malawi ended its famine by subsidizing farmers against the strictures of the World Bank.<ref name=newyorktimes /> During the 1973 [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia#Wollo famine|Wollo Famine]] in [[Ethiopia]], food was shipped out of Wollo to the capital city of [[Addis Ababa]], where it could command higher prices. In the late-1970s and early-1980s, residents of the [[dictatorship]]s of Ethiopia and [[Sudan]] suffered massive famines, but the democracy of [[Botswana]] avoided them, despite also having a severe drop in national food production. In [[Somalia]], famine occurred because of a [[failed state]].

Many famines are caused by imbalance of food production compared to the large populations of countries whose [[overpopulation|population exceeds the regional carrying capacity]] {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}. Historically, famines have occurred from agricultural problems such as [[drought]], crop failure, or [[infectious disease|pestilence]]. Changing weather patterns, the ineffectiveness of medieval governments in dealing with crises, wars, and [[List of epidemics|epidemic diseases]] such as the [[Black Death]] helped to cause hundreds of famines in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]], including 95 in Britain and 75 in France.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3609390/Poor-studies-will-always-be-with-us.html "Poor studies will always be with us"], ''The Telegraph''</ref> In France, the [[Hundred Years' War]], crop failures and epidemics reduced the population by two-thirds.<ref>[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3031536.html Don O'Reilly, "Hundred Years' War: Joan of Arc and the Siege of Orl<U+00E9>ans]", ''TheHistoryNet.com''</ref>

The failure of a harvest or change in conditions, such as [[drought]], can create a situation whereby large numbers of people continue to live where the [[carrying capacity]] of the land has temporarily dropped radically. Famine is often associated with [[subsistence]] agriculture. The total absence of agriculture in an economically strong area does not cause famine; [[Arizona]] and other wealthy regions import the vast majority of their food, since such regions produce sufficient economic goods for trade.

Famines have also been caused by volcanism. The 1815 eruption of  the [[Mount Tambora]] volcano in Indonesia caused crop failures and famines worldwide and caused the worst famine of the 19th century. The current consensus of the scientific community is that the aerosols and dust released into the upper atmosphere causes cooler temperatures by preventing the sun's energy from reaching the ground. The same mechanism is theorized to be caused by very large meteorite impacts to the extent of causing mass extinctions.

Beginning in the 20th century, nitrogen [[fertilizer]]s, new [[pesticide]]s, [[desert farming]], and other agricultural technologies began to be used to increase food production, in part to combat famine. Between 1950 and 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] influenced [[agriculture]], world grain production increased by 250%. However, as early as 1995, there were signs that these new developments may contribute to the decline of arable land (e.g. persistence of pesticides leading to [[soil contamination]] and decline of area available for farming). Developed nations have shared these technologies with developing nations with a famine problem.

Evan Fraser, a geographer at the [[University of Guelph]] in [[Ontario]] [[Canada]], explores the ways in which [[climate change]] may affect future famines.<ref>Fraser, E. 2007a. Travelling in antique lands:  Studying past famines to understand present vulnerabilities to climate change. Climate Change 83:495-514.</ref> To do this he draws on a range of historic cases where relatively small environmental problems triggered famines as a way of creating theoretical links between climate and famine in the future.  Drawing on situations as diverse as the [[Great Irish Potato Famine]],<ref>Fraser, E. 2003. Social vulnerability and ecological fragility:  building bridges between social and natural sciences using the Irish Potato Famine as a case study. Conservation Ecology 7:9: on line.</ref> a series of weather induced famines in [[Asia]] during the late 19th century, and famines in Ethiopia during the 1980s, he concludes there are three <U+201C>lines of defense<U+201D> that protect a community<U+2019>s [[food security]] from [[environmental change]].  The first line of defense is the [[Agroecosystem|agro-ecosystem]] on which food is produced: diverse ecosystems with well managed soils high in [[organic matter]] tent to be more resilient.  The second line of defense is the wealth and skills of individual households: if those households affected by bad weather such as [[drought]] have savings or skills they may be able to do all right despite the bad weather.  The final line of defense is created by the formal institutions present in a society.  Governments, churches, or NGOs must be willing and able to mount effective relief efforts.  Pulling this together, Evan Fraser argues that if an [[ecosystem]] is resilient enough, it may be able to withstand weather related shocks.  But if these shocks overwhelm the ecosystem<U+2019>s line of defense, it is necessary for the household to adapt using its skills and savings.  If a problem is too big for the family or household, then people must rely on the third line of defense, which is whether or not the formal institutions present in a society are able to provide help. Evan Fraser concludes that in almost every situation where an environmental problem triggered a famine you see a failure in each of these three lines of defense.<ref>Fraser, E. D. G. 2006.

[[File:Norman Borlaug.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Norman Borlaug]], father of the [[Green Revolution]], is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation.]]
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the [[Western world]], such as [[nitrogen]] [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticides]], to [[Asia]], called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in decreases in malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing [[infrastructure]] and institutions that are in short supply in [[Africa]], such as a system of roads or public [[seed]] companies that made seeds available.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin In Africa, prosperity from seeds falls short</ref> Supporting [[farmer]]s in areas of food insecurity, through such measures as free or subsidized [[fertilizer]]s and [[seed]]s, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.<ref name=newyorktimes/><ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest]</ref>

There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.<ref name=csmonitor>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html UN aid debate: give cash not food?]</ref> The [[United Nations]]' [[World Food Program]] (WFP), the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.<ref name=csmonitor/><ref name=wfp>[http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&Key=2899 Cash roll-out to help hunger hot spots]</ref> The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a [[mobile phone]] operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.<ref name=csmonitor/>

[[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed recipe for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2 A model of African food aid is now in trouble]</ref>

In the mid-22nd century BC, a sudden and short-lived climatic change that caused reduced rainfall resulted in several decades of drought in [[Upper Egypt]]. The resulting famine and civil strife is believed to have been a major cause of the collapse of the [[Old Kingdom]].
An account from the [[First Intermediate Period]] states, "All of Upper Egypt was dying of hunger and people were eating their children." In 1680s, famine extended across the entire [[Sahel]], and in 1738 half the population of [[Timbuktu]] died of famine.<ref>[http://ag.arizona.edu/~lmilich/desclim.html Len Milich: Anthropogenic Desertification vs <U+2018>Natural<U+2019> Climate Trends]</ref> In [[Egypt]], between 1687 and 1731, there were six famines.<ref>{{cite book|name=Donald Quataert|title=The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-521-83910-6|page=115}}</ref> The famine that afflicted Egypt in 1784 cost it roughly one-sixth of its population.<ref>"[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061121232204.htm Icelandic Volcano Caused Historic Famine In Egypt, Study Shows]".

According to John Iliffe, "Portuguese records of [[Angola]] from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys."<ref>John Iliffe (2007) [http://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC&pg=&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Africans: the history of a continent''].

With famine reigning over Africa, corruption in governments and foreign aid started to become more prevalent. Donors and corporations sometimes build infrastructures and give loans, but the continued protection and aid depends on the governments and agencies.  One common theme in foreign aid and how it is disrupted is a correlation between geography and food security along with class, ethnicity, gender and religion.  Foreign aid tends to find its way into hands that don<U+2019>t need it in corrupt governments, siphoning it away from the poor. Taking the aid away from the people that really need it slows the pace of development and progress ultimately undermines the welfare of citizens.

The first documentation of weather in West-Central Africa occurs around the mid-16th to 17th centuries in areas such as Luanda Kongo, however, not much data was recorded on the issues of weather and disease except for a few notable documents. The only records obtained are of violence between Portuguese and Africans during the battle of mbilwa in 1665. In these documents the Portuguese wrote of African raids on Portuguese merchants solely for food, giving clear signs of famine. Additionally, instances of cannibalism by the African Jaga were also more prevalent during this time frame, indicating an extreme deprivation of a primary food source.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Joseph C.|title=The Significance of Drought, Disease and Famine in the Agriculturally Marginal Zones of West-Central Africa|journal=Journal of African History|year=1982|month=January|volume=23|issue=1|pages=17<U+2013>61|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&fid=3243140&jid=AFH&volumeId=23&issueId=01&aid=3243132|accessdate=11/11/2011|doi=10.1017/S0021853700020235|pmid=11632226}}</ref>

Historians of African famine have documented repeated famines in [[Ethiopia]]. Possibly the worst episode occurred in 1888 and succeeding years, as the [[1890s African rinderpest epizootic|rinderpest epizootic]], introduced into [[Eritrea]] by infected cattle, spread southwards reaching ultimately as far as [[South Africa]]. In Ethiopia it was estimated that as much as 90 percent of the national herd died, rendering rich farmers and herders destitute overnight. This coincided with [[drought]] associated with an el Nino oscillation, human epidemics of [[smallpox]], and in several countries, intense [[war]]. The [[Famines in Ethiopia|Ethiopian Great famine]] that afflicted Ethiopia from 1888 to 1892 cost it roughly
one-third of its population.<ref>[http://www.ccb.ucar.edu/ijas/ijasno2/georgis.html El Ni<U+00F1>o and Drought Early Warning in Ethiopia]</ref> In [[Sudan]] the year 1888 is remembered as the worst famine in history, on account of these factors and also the exactions imposed by the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdist state]].

Wars related to colonization by the British, Spanish, Portuguese, and Belgian empires in the 19th and early 20th centuries may have contributed to numerous famines.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} A prominent figure in the starvation of many Africans around the turn of the 20th century was Belgian [[King Leopold II]] who is credited with the forming of the [[Congo Free State]]. In forming this state, Leopold used mass labor camps to finance his empire.<ref name="Masci 2002">{{cite journal|last=Masci|first=David|title=Famine in Africa|journal=CQ Researcher|date=11/08/2002|year=2002|month=November|volume=12|issue=39|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2002110800#top|accessdate=11/27/2011}}</ref> His empire contributed to the death of perhaps 10 million Africans and has had long lasting effects on the current [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Dummett|first=Mark|title=King Leopold's Legacy of DR Congo Violence|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3516965.stm|accessdate=11/27/2011|date=02/24/2004|work=BBC News}}</ref> Figures on the numbers of people affected vary widely. [[William Rubinstein]] wrote: "It appears almost certain that the population figures given by [[Adam Hochschild|Hochschild]] are inaccurate. There is, of course, no way of ascertaining the population of the Congo before the twentieth century, and estimates like 20 million are purely guesses. Most of the interior of the Congo was literally unexplored if not inaccessible."<ref>Rubinstein, W. D. (2004).

Colonial "pacification" efforts often caused severe famine, as for example with the repression of the Maji Maji revolt in [[Tanganyika]] in 1906. The introduction of cash crops such as cotton, and forcible measures to impel farmers to grow these crops, also impoverished the peasantry in many areas, such as northern Nigeria, contributing to greater vulnerability to famine when severe drought struck in 1913.

Another example of this pacification can be taken from the years revolving around 1896 in which the British empire destroyed large amounts of grain and food stocks, suppressing a riot being formed by the Ndeblee tribe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Waal|first=Alex De|title=Famine Crimes: Politics and the Disaster Relief Industry in Africa|year=1997|pages=1<U+2013>27}}</ref>

Records compiled for the [[Himba people|Himba]] recall two droughts from 1910-1917. They were recorded by the Himba through a method of [[oral tradition]]. From 1910-1911 the Himba described the drought as "drought of the omutati seed" also called ''omangowi'', which means the fruit of an unidentified vine that people ate during the time period. From 1914-1916 droughts brought ''katur' ombanda'' or ''kari' ombanda'' which means "the time of eating clothing".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Joseph C.|title=The Significance of Drought , Disease and Famine in the Agriculturally Marginal Zones of West-Central Africa|journal=Journal of African History|year=1982|month=January|volume=23|issue=1|pages=17<U+2013>61|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&fid=3243140&jid=AFH&volumeId=23&issueId=01&aid=3243132|accessdate=11/27/2011|doi=10.1017/S0021853700020235|pmid=11632226}}</ref>

For the middle part of the 20th century, agriculturalists, economists and geographers did not consider Africa to be famine prone (they were much more concerned about Asia).{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} There were notable counter-examples, such as the famine in [[Rwanda]] during World War II and the [[Malawi]] famine of 1949, but most famines were localized and brief [[wikt:food shortage|food shortages]]. Although the drought was brief the main cause of death in Rwanda was due to Belgian prerogatives to acquisition grain from their colony (Rwanda). This and the drought caused 300,000 Rwandans to perish.<ref name="Masci 2002"/>

From 1967-1969 large scale famine occurs in Biafra and Nigeria due to the government blockading the Breakaway territory (see: [Nigerian Civil War]). It is estimated that 1.5 million people died of starvation due to this famine. Additionally, with the added effect of the drought and other corrupt governments withholding food during this time; 500,000 Africans perish in Central and West Africa.<ref>{{cite book|last=Iliffe|first=John|title=Africans: The History of a Continent|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge}}</ref>

The specter of famine recurred only in the early 1970s, when [[Ethiopia]] and the west African [[Sahel]] suffered drought and famine. The Ethiopian famine of that time was closely linked to the crisis of feudalism in that country, and in due course helped to bring about the downfall of the Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]. The Sahelian famine was associated with the slowly growing crisis of pastoralism in Africa, which has seen livestock herding decline as a viable way of life over the last two generations.
[[File:Starved girl.jpg|200px|thumb|170px|A girl during the [[Nigerian-Biafran war]] of the late 1960s. Pictures of the famine caused by Nigerian blockade garnered sympathy for the Biafrans worldwide.]]

Since then, African famines become more frequent, more widespread and more severe until the start of the 21st century. Since then, more effective early warning and humanitarian response actions have reduced the number of deaths by famine markedly. That said, many African countries are not self-sufficient in food production, relying on income from [[cash crop]]s to import food. [[Agriculture]] in Africa is susceptible to [[climate|climatic]] fluctuations, especially [[drought]]s which can reduce the amount of food produced locally. Other agricultural problems include [[fertility (soil)|soil infertility]], [[land degradation]] and [[erosion]], swarms of [[desert locust]]s, which can destroy whole crops, and livestock diseases. The [[Sahara]] reportedly spreads at a rate of up to 30 miles a year.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0801/p01s02-woaf.html Hunger is spreading in Africa], csmonitor.com, August 1, 2005</ref> The most serious famines have been caused by a combination of drought, misguided economic policies, and conflict. The 1983<U+2013>85 famine in Ethiopia, for example, was the outcome of all these three factors, made worse by the Communist government's censorship of the emerging crisis. In Sudan at the same date, drought and economic crisis combined with denials of any food shortage by the then-government of President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], to create a crisis that killed perhaps 250,000 people<U+2014>and helped bring about a popular uprising that overthrew Nimeiry.

Numerous factors make the [[food security]] situation in Africa tenuous, including political instability, armed conflict and [[civil war]], [[political corruption|corruption]] and mismanagement in handling food supplies, and trade policies that harm African agriculture. An example of a famine created by human rights abuses is the [[1998 Sudan famine]].  [[AIDS]] is also having long-term economic effects on agriculture by reducing the available workforce, and is creating new vulnerabilities to famine by overburdening poor households. On the other hand, in the modern history of Africa on quite a few occasions famines acted as a major source of acute political instability.<ref>See, for example, [[Andrey Korotayev]] and [[Daria Khaltourina]] ''[http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=70 Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends in Africa]''. Moscow: Russia, 2006.  ISBN 5-484-00560-4</ref> In [[Africa]], if current trends of [[population growth]] and soil degradation continue, the continent might
be able to feed just 25% of its population by 2025, according to [[United Nations University]] (UNU)'s Ghana-based Institute for Natural Resources in Africa.<ref name="news.mongabay.com"/>

Recent examples include [[Sahel drought]] of the 1970s, [[Ethiopia]] in 1973 and mid-1980s, [[Sudan]] in the late-1970s and again in 1990 and 1998. The 1980 famine in [[Karamoja]], [[Uganda]] was, in terms of mortality rates, one of the worst in history. 21% of the population died, including 60% of the infants. [http://www.unu.edu/unupress/food/8F091e/8F091E05.htm]

In the 1980s there was large scale multilayer drought that occurred in the Sudan and Sahelian region of Africa. This was a large concern because even though the Sudanese Government believed there was a surplus of grain, there were local deficits that were occurring across the region.<ref>{{cite web|last=BE|first=Spiers|title=Famine in Africa|url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=9110094&q=Famine+in+Africa&uid=791203203&setcookie=yes|accessdate=11/27/2011}}</ref>

In October 1984, television reports around the world carried footage of starving [[Ethiopia]]ns whose plight was centered around a feeding station near the town of [[Korem]]. [[BBC]] newsreader [[Michael Buerk]] gave moving commentary of the tragedy on 23 October 1984, which he described as a "biblical famine". This prompted the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] single, which was organized by [[Bob Geldof]] and featured more than 20 pop stars. The [[Live Aid]] concerts in [[London]] and [[Philadelphia]] raised even more funds for the cause. An estimated 900,000 people died within one year as a result of the famine, but the tens of millions of pounds raised by Band Aid and Live Aid are widely believed to have saved the lives of Ethiopians who were in danger of dying.

A central reason as to why the famine (one of the largest seen in the country) is thought to have occurred is that Ethiopia (and the surrounding Horn) was still recovering from the droughts which occurred in the mid-late 1970s. Compounding this problem was the intermittent fighting erupting in the region due to a civil war occurring in Ethiopia. Further issues were created by the government's lack of organization in providing relief; many even hoarded supplies as a way to control the population. Ultimately, over 1 million Ethiopians died and over 22 million people suffered due to the prolonged drought, which lasted roughly 2 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ethiopia in Crisis: Famine and Its Aftermath 1984-1988|url=http://countrystudies.us/ethiopia/35.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress}}</ref>

Subsequently in 1992 Somalia becomes a war zone with no effective government, police, or basic services. This is mainly due to the collapse of the dictatorship led by [Barre] and the split of power between warlords. Additionally a massive drought occurs at the same instance causing over 300,000 Somalians to perish.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Masci|first=David|title=Famine In Africa|journal=CQ Researcher|date=11/08/2002|year=2002|month=November|volume=12|issue=39|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2002110800#top}}</ref>

;2012 Sahel drought
{{main|2012 Sahel drought}}
July 6 saw the [[Methodist Relief & Development Fund (MRDF)]] aid experts say that more than 10 million people in the western Sahel were at risk of famine due to a month long heat wave that was hovering over [[Niger]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Burkina Faso]]. A fund of about <U+00A3>20,000 was distributed to the crisis-hit countries of Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso and Mauritania.<ref>http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/12566</ref>

====Initiatives to increase Food Security====

Against a backdrop of conventional interventions through the state or markets, alternative initiatives have been pioneered to address the problem of food security. An example is the "Community Area-Based Development Approach" to agricultural development ("CABDA"), an NGO programme with the objective of providing an alternative approach to increasing food security in Africa. CABDA proceeds through specific areas of intervention such as the introduction of drought-resistant crops and new methods of food production such as agro-forestry. Piloted in [[Ethiopia]] in the 1990s it has spread to [[Malawi]], [[Uganda]], [[Eritrea]] and [[Kenya]]. In an analysis of the programme by the [[Overseas Development Institute]], CABDA's focus on individual and community capacity-building is highlighted. This enables farmers to influence and drive their own development through community-run institutions, bringing food security to their household and region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2572&title=community-area-based-development-approach-cabda-programme-alternative-way-address-current-african-food-crisis|title=Community Area-Based Development Approach (CABDA) Programme.

====Cambodia====
In 1975, the [[Khmer Rouge]] entered the capital of [[Phnom Penh]] and took control of [[Cambodia]].  With the application of the fundamental ideals of [[communism]], the new government under [[Pol Pot]] drove all urban residents into the countryside to work on communal farm and civil work projects.  Without external assistance, with 75% of the necessary draft animals dead from the previous four years of war, agricultural guidelines written by idealists, and work overseen by zealous cadre, the country soon sunk into the depths of famine.  No international relief would come until the [[Vietnam]]ese army invaded in 1979 and liberated the country.  While Pol Pot was in power, between one and three million people died out of a total population of eight million.  Many were executed, most died from malnourishment and exhaustion as a result of the famine caused by inept and negligent government officials.<ref>Shawcross, William, ''The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust and Modern Conscience'', Touchstone, 1985, pp. 115<U+2013>116.</ref><ref>Vickery, Michael, Correspondence, ''Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars'', vol. 20, no. 1, January<U+2013>March 1988, p. 73.</ref><ref name="kaplan">Kaplan, Robert D., ''The Ends of the Earth'', Vintage, 1996, p. 406.</ref>

These events are comparable, though somewhat smaller in scale, to the ecological trigger events of China's vast 19th-century famines. (Pierre-Etienne Will, ''Bureaucracy and Famine'') Qing China carried out its relief efforts, which included vast shipments of food, a requirement that the rich open their storehouses to the poor, and price regulation, as part of a state guarantee of subsistence to the peasantry (known as ''ming-sheng'').

When a stressed monarchy shifted from state management and direct shipments of grain to monetary charity in the mid-19th century, the system broke down. Thus the 1867<U+2013>68 famine under the [[Tongzhi Restoration]] was successfully relieved but the [[Northern Chinese Famine of 1876<U+2013>1879|Great North China Famine]] of 1877<U+2013>78, caused by drought across northern China, was a catastrophe. The province of [[Shanxi]] was substantially depopulated as grains ran out, and desperately starving people stripped forests, fields, and their very houses for food. Estimated mortality is 9.5 to 13 million people.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U8480E/U8480E05.htm Dimensions of need <U+2013> People and populations at risk].

=====Great Leap Forward=====
{{Main|Great Leap Forward|Great Chinese Famine}}

The largest famine of the 20th century, and almost certainly of all time, was the 1958<U+2013>61 [[Great Leap Forward]] famine in China. The immediate causes of this famine lay in Mao Zedong's ill-fated attempt to transform China from an agricultural nation to an industrial power in one huge leap. Communist Party cadres across China insisted that peasants abandon their farms for collective farms, and begin to produce steel in small foundries, often melting down their farm instruments in the process. Collectivisation undermined incentives for the investment of labor and resources in agriculture; unrealistic plans for decentralized metal production sapped needed labor; unfavorable weather conditions; and communal dining halls encouraged overconsumption of available food.<ref>Chang, G, and Wen, G (1997), "[http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Communal%20dining%20and%20the%20Chinese%20Famine%201958-1961&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&btnG=Search Communal dining and the Chinese Famine 1958-1961]"</ref> Such was the centralized control of information and the intense pressure on party cadres to report only good news<U+2014>such as [[production quota]]s met or exceeded<U+2014>that information about the escalating disaster was effectively suppressed. When the leadership did become aware of the scale of the famine, it did little to respond, and continued to ban any discussion of the cataclysm. This blanket suppression of news was so effective that very few Chinese citizens were aware of the scale of the famine, and the greatest peacetime demographic disaster of the 20th century only became widely known twenty years later, when the veil of censorship began to lift.

The exact number of famine deaths during 1958<U+2013>61 is difficult to determine, and estimates range from 18<ref name=grada9>{{Cite journal | last = Gr<U+00E1>da | first = Cormac <U+00D3> | title = Great Leap into Famine | series = UCD Centre For Economic Research Working Paper Series | year = 2011| page = 9 }}</ref> to at least 42 million<ref name=dikotterxii>Dik<U+00F6>tter, Frank.

====India====
{{Main|Famine in India}}
Owing to its almost entire dependence upon the [[monsoon]] rains, [[India]] is vulnerable to crop failures, which upon occasion deepen into famine.<ref>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Famine Famine - Encyclopaedia Britannica 1911]</ref> There were 14 famines in [[History of India|India]] between the 11th and 17th centuries (Bhatia, 1985). For example, during the 1022<U+2013>1033 Great famines in India entire provinces were depopulated. Famine in [[Deccan]] killed at least 2 million people in 1702-1704. B.M. Bhatia believes that the earlier famines were localised, and it was only after 1860, during the [[British Raj|British rule]], that famine came to signify general shortage of foodgrains in the country. There were approximately 25 major famines spread through states such as [[Tamil Nadu]] in the south, and [[Bihar]] and [[Bengal]] in the east during the latter half of the 19th century.
[[File:Starved child.jpg|thumb|190px|A child suffering extreme starvation in India, 1972]]
[[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] argued as early as 1900, and present-day scholars such as [[Amartya Sen]] agree, that some historic famines were a product of both uneven rainfall and British economic and administrative policies, which since 1857 had led to the seizure and conversion of local farmland to foreign-owned plantations, restrictions on internal trade, heavy taxation of Indian citizens to support British expeditions in [[Afghanistan]] (see [[European influence in Afghanistan#Second Anglo-Afghan War|The Second Anglo-Afghan War]]), inflationary measures that increased the price of food, and substantial exports of staple crops from India to Britain. (Dutt, 1900 and 1902; Srivastava, 1968; Sen, 1982; Bhatia, 1985.) Some British citizens, such as [[William Digby (writer)|William Digby]], agitated for policy reforms and famine relief, but Lord Lytton, the governing British viceroy in India, opposed such changes in the belief that they would stimulate shirking by Indian workers. The first, the [[Bengal famine of 1770]], is estimated to have taken around 10 million lives <U+2014> one-third of Bengal's population at the time. Other notable famines include the [[Great Famine of 1876<U+2013>78]], in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died<ref name=mikedavis>Davis, Mike. Late Victorian Holocausts. 1. Verso, 2000. ISBN 1-85984-739-0 pg 7</ref> and the [[Indian famine of 1899<U+2013>1900]], in which 1.25 to 10 million people died.<ref name=mikedavis>Davis, Mike. Late Victorian Holocausts. 1. Verso, 2000. ISBN 1-85984-739-0 pg 173</ref>  The famines continued until independence in 1947, with the [[Bengal famine of 1943|Bengal Famine of 1943<U+2013>44]]<U+2014> even though there were no crop failures <U+2014>killing 1.5 million to 3 million Bengalis during [[World War II]].

The observations of the Famine Commission of 1880 support the notion that food distribution is more to blame for famines than food scarcity. They observed that each province in British India, including [[Burma]], had a surplus of foodgrains, and the annual surplus was 5.16 million tons (Bhatia, 1970). At that time, annual export of rice and other grains from India was approximately one million tons.

{{cquote|Population growth worsened the plight of the peasantry. As a result of peace and improved sanitation and health, the Indian population rose from perhaps 100 million in 1700 to 300 million by 1920. While encouraging agricultural productivity, the British also provided economic incentives to have more children to help in the fields. Although a similar population increase occurred in Europe at the same time, the growing numbers could be absorbed by industrialization or emigration to the Americas and Australia. India enjoyed neither an industrial revolution nor an increase in food growing. Moreover, Indian landlords had a stake in the cash crop system and discouraged innovation. As a result, population numbers far outstripped the amount of available food and land, creating dire poverty and widespread hunger  .|20x|20x|-Craig A.

In 1966, there was a close call in [[Bihar]], when the [[United States]] allocated 900,000 tons of grain to fight the famine.

The vulnerable agricultural sector experienced a massive failure in 1995<U+2013>96, expanding to full-fledged famine by 1996<U+2013>99.

The [[Great Famine of 1315<U+2013>1317]] (or to 1322) was the first major food crisis that struck Europe in the 14th century.

During the 17th century, continuing the trend of previous centuries, there was an increase in [[market]]-driven agriculture. [[Farmer]]s, people who rented land in order to make a profit off of the product of the land, employing [[wage labour]], became increasingly common, particularly in [[western Europe]]. It was in their interest to produce as much as possible on their land in order to sell it to areas that demanded that product. They produced guaranteed surpluses of their crop every year if they could. Farmers paid their labourers in [[money]], increasing the commercialization of [[rural]] society. This [[commercialization]] had a profound impact on the behaviour of peasants.
[[File:Goya-Guerra (59).jpg|thumb|An engraving from [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]'s ''[[Disasters of War]]'', showing starving women, doubtless inspired by the terrible famine that struck [[Madrid]] in 1811-1812.]]

The 1590s saw the worst famines in centuries across all of Europe, except in certain areas, notably the Netherlands. Famine had been relatively rare during the 16th century. The economy and population had grown steadily as subsistence populations tend to when there is an extended period of relative peace (most of the time). Peasants in areas of high population density, such as northern Italy, had learned to increase the yields of their lands through techniques such as promiscuous culture.

Famine is a very destabilizing and devastating occurrence. The prospect of [[starvation]] led people to take desperate measures. When scarcity of food became apparent to peasants, they would sacrifice long-term prosperity for short-term survival. They would kill their [[draught animal]]s, leading to lowered production in subsequent years. They would eat their [[seed]] corn, sacrificing next year's crop in the hope that more seed could be found. Once those means had been exhausted, they would take to the road in search of food. They migrated to the cities where merchants from other areas would be more likely to sell their food. Some cities also administered relief programs and bought grain for their populations so that they could keep order. With the confusion and desperation of the migrants, crime would often follow them. Many peasants resorted to [[bandit]]ry in order to acquire enough to eat.

One famine would often lead to difficulties in the following years because of lack of seed stock or disruption of routine, or perhaps because of less-available labour. Famines were often interpreted as signs of God's displeasure. They were seen as the removal, by God, of His gifts to the people of the Earth. Elaborate religious processions and rituals were made to prevent God's wrath in the form of famine.

The Netherlands had the most commercialized agriculture in all of Europe at this time, growing many industrial crops, such as [[flax]], [[hemp]], and [[hops]]. Agriculture became increasingly specialized and efficient.  As a result, productivity and wealth increased, allowing the Netherlands to maintain a steady food supply. By the 1620s, the economy was even more developed, so the country was able to avoid the hardships of that period of famine with even greater impunity.

The years around 1620 saw another period of famines sweep across Europe. These famines were generally less severe than the famines of twenty-five years earlier, but they were nonetheless quite serious in many areas. Perhaps the worst famine since 1600, the great famine in [[Finland]] in 1696, killed one-third of the population. {{PDFlink|[http://www.euro.who.int/document/peh-ehp/nehapfin.pdf]|589&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 603384 bytes -->}}

Two massive famines struck [[France]] between 1693 and 1710, killing over two million people.

Other areas of Europe have known famines much more recently. [[France]] saw famines as recently as the 19th century. Famine still occurred in eastern Europe during the 20th century.

The frequency of famine can vary with climate changes. For example, during the [[little ice age]] of the 15th century to the 18th century, European famines grew more frequent than they had been during previous centuries. The led to the rise of [[conspiracy theories]] concerning the causes behind these famines, such as the [[Pacte de Famine]] in France.<ref>Kaplan, Steven. ''The Famine Plot Persuasion in Eighteenth-Century France''. Pennsylvania: Diane Publishing Co, 1982. ISBN 0-87169-723-8</ref>

Because of the severity of famine in many societies, it has long been a chief concern of governments and other authorities. In pre-industrial Europe, preventing famine, and ensuring timely food supplies, was one of the chief concerns of many governments, which employed various tools to alleviate famines, including [[price controls]], purchasing stockpiles of food from other areas, [[rationing]], and regulation of production. Most governments were concerned by famine because it could lead to [[revolt]] and other forms of social disruption.
[[File:Voedselbonnen-01.jpg|thumb|right|Food ration coupons during the [[Dutch famine of 1944]].]]
Famine returned to the [[Netherlands]] during [[World War II]] in what was known as the ''[[Dutch famine of 1944|Hongerwinter]]''. It was the last famine of Western Europe, in which approximately 30,000 people died of starvation. Some other areas of Europe also experienced famine at the same time.

=====Italy=====
The harvest failures were devastating for the northern [[Italy|Italian]] economy. The economy of the area had recovered well from the previous famines, but the famines from 1618 to 1621 coincided because of a period of war in the area. The economy did not recover fully for centuries. There were serious famines in the late-1640s and less severe ones in the 1670s throughout northern Italy.

In northern Italy, a report of 1767 noted that there had been famine in 111 of the previous 316 years (i.e. the period 1451-1767) and only sixteen good harvests.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=eGsCGAdH4YQC&pg=PA64&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false The savage wars of peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian trap]''". Alan Macfarlane (1997). p.64. ISBN 0-631-18117-2</ref>

According to Stephen L. Dyson and Robert J. Rowland, "The Jesuits of [[Cagliari]] [in Sardinia] recorded years during the late 1500s "of such hunger and so sterile that the majority of the people could sustain life only with wild ferns and other weeds" ... During the terrible famine of 1680, some 80,000 persons, out of a total population of 250,000, are said to have died, and entire villages were devastated..."<ref>{{cite book|last=Dyson|first=Stephen L|coauthors=Rowland, Robert J |title=Archaeology and history in Sardinia from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages: shepherds, sailors & conquerors|publisher=UPenn Museum of Archaeology, 2007|location=Philadelphia|year=2007|isbn=1-934536-02-4|page=136}}</ref>

=====England=====
From 1536 England began legislating [[Poor Laws]] which put a legal responsibility on the rich, at a parish level, to maintain the poor of that parish. English agriculture lagged behind the Netherlands, but by 1650 their agricultural industry was commercialized on a wide scale. The last peace-time famine in England was in 1623<U+2013>24.<ref name="famine"/> There were still periods of [[hunger]], as in the Netherlands, but there were no more famines as such. Rising population levels continued to put a strain on food security, despite potatoes becoming increasingly important in the diet of the poor. On balance, potatoes increased food security in England where they never replaced bread as the staple of the poor. Climate conditions were never likely to simultaneously be catastrophic for both the wheat and potato crops.

=====Iceland=====
According to [[Reid Bryson|Bryson]] (1974), there were thirty-seven famine years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=T4DLK7zLxYMC&pg=PA399&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Expectations of life: a study in the demography, statistics, and history of world mortality]''". Henry Oliver Lancaster (1990). [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]. p.399. ISBN 0-387-97105-X</ref>

In 1783 the volcano [[Laki (volcano)|Laki]] in south-central [[Iceland]] erupted. The lava caused little direct damage, but ash and sulphur dioxide spewed out over most of the country, causing three-quarters of the island's livestock to perish. In the following famine, around ten thousand people died, one-fifth of the population of Iceland. [Asimov, 1984, 152-153]

[[File:Irish potato famine Bridget O'Donnel.jpg|thumb|Depiction of victims of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in [[Ireland]], 1845-1849]]
Iceland was also hit by a potato famine between 1862 and 1864.  Lesser known than the [[Irish potato famine]], the [[Icelandic potato famine]] was caused by the same [[blight]] that ravaged most of Europe during the 1840s.  About 5 percent of Iceland's population died during the famine.

=====Finland=====
The country suffered from severe famines, and [[Great Famine of Finland (1695<U+2013>1697)|that of 1696<U+2013>1697]] may have killed a third of the population.<ref>"[http://countrystudies.us/finland/9.htm Finland and the Swedish Empire]". ''Federal Research Division, [[Library of Congress]]''.</ref> The [[Finnish famine of 1866<U+2013>1868]] killed 15% of the population.

=====Ireland=====
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
{{see also|Great Irish famine}}

The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in [[Ireland]], 1846<U+2013>1851, was partly caused by policies of the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] government of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] under [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]]. The [[British government]]'s response to the food crisis in Ireland was to leave the matter solely to market forces to decide.

The immediate effect was 1,000,000 dead and another 2,000,000 [[refugees]] fleeing to Britain, Australia and the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite book

According to Scott and Duncan (2002), "Eastern Europe experienced more than 150 recorded famines between AD 1500 and 1700 and there were 100 hunger years and 121 famine years in Russia between AD 971 and 1974."<ref>Susan Scott,Christopher John Duncan (2002).

Droughts and famines in [[Imperial Russia]] are known to have happened every 10 to 13 years, with average droughts happening every 5 to 7 years. Eleven major famines scourged Russia between 1845 and 1922, one of the worst being the [[Russian famine of 1891-2|famine of 1891<U+2013>2]].<ref>"[http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/savage/A-FAM.PDF The Dimension of Famine]" (PDF). [[Alan Macfarlane]].</ref> Famines continued in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, the most notorious being the ''[[Holodomor]]'' in various parts of the country, especially the [[Volga Region|Volga]], and the Ukrainian and northern [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] SSR's during the winter of 1932<U+2013>1933. The [[Soviet famine of 1932<U+2013>1933]] is nowadays reckoned to have cost an estimated 6 million lives.<ref>St<U+00E9>phane Courtois, Mark Kramer.

The [[Hunger Plan]], i.e. the Nazi plan to starve large sections of the Soviet population, caused the deaths of many. The Russian Academy of Sciences in 1995 reported civilian victims in the USSR at German hands, including Jews, totalled 13.7 million dead, 20% of the 68 million persons in the occupied USSR. This included 4.1 million famine and disease deaths in occupied territory. There were an additional estimated 3 million famine deaths in areas of the USSR not under German occupation.<ref>The Russian Academy of Science Rossiiskaia Akademiia nauk.

The 872 days of the [[Siege of Leningrad]] (1941<U+2013>1944) caused unparalleled famine in the Leningrad region through disruption of utilities, water, energy and food supplies. This resulted in the deaths of about one million people.<ref>[http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&story_id=24841 Last Battle of Siege of Leningrad Re-Enacted], The St. Petersburg Times, January 29, 2008</ref>

===Oceania===
[[Easter Island]] was hit by a great famine between the 15th and 18th centuries. Hunger and subsequent cannibalism was caused by [[overpopulation]] and depletion of natural resources as a result of deforestation, partly because work on megalithic monuments required a lot of wood.<ref>Bo Rothstein (2005). Social traps and the problem of trust. Cambridge University Press. p. 20. ISBN 0-521-84829-6</ref>

There are other documented episodes of famine in various islands of Polynesia, such as occurred in [[Ka'u]], [[Hawai'i]] in 1868.<ref>Patrick Vinton Kirch (1989). The Evolution of the Polynesian Chiefdoms. Cambridge University Press. p.</ref>

According to Daniel Lord Smail, "'Famine [[cannibalism]]' was until recently a regular feature of life in the islands of the [[Milne Bay Province|Massim]] near [[New Guinea]] and of some other societies of Southeast Asia and the Pacific."<ref>Andrew Shryock, Daniel Lord Smail (2011).

==Society and culture==

===In folklore===
Famine personified as an [[allegory]] is found in some cultures, e.g. one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] in Christian tradition,  the [[fear gorta]] of Irish folklore, or the [[Wendigo]] of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tradition.
