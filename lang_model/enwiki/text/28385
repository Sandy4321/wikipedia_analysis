'''Timothy Henry "Tim" Henman''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 6 September 1974) is a British retired professional [[tennis player]] and former [[British people|British]] Number One. Henman played a [[serve-and-volley]] style of tennis that suited the grass courts of Wimbledon. He was the first player from the United Kingdom since [[Roger Taylor (tennis)|Roger Taylor]] in the 1970s to reach the semi-finals of the [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] Men's Singles Championship. Having reached six [[Grand Slam title|Grand Slam]] semi-finals, won 15 career ATP titles (11 in singles and 4 in doubles), and been ranked number 4 in the world, Henman was one of Britain's most successful [[History of tennis#Open era|open era]] male tennis players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/24082007/58/atp-tour-henman-announces-retirement.html|title=ATP Tour - Henman announces retirement|publisher=Eurosport|date=2007-08-24|accessdate=2007-09-03}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He retired after helping [[Great Britain Davis Cup team|Great Britain]] defeat [[Croatia Davis Cup team|Croatia]] in a [[Davis Cup]] match played in September 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/6954442.stm|title=Henman to retire after GB Cup tie|publisher=BBC|date=2007-08-23|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

==Early and personal life==
Tim Henman comes from a privileged sporting family: his father Tony, a [[solicitor]], was accomplished at various sports, including tennis and squash. His mother Jane, a dress designer, played Junior Wimbledon and introduced Tim and his older brothers Michael and Richard to tennis as soon as they could walk on the family's vast grass court.<ref name="TimH02"/> His great grandfather played at Wimbledon. His maternal grandfather, [[Henry Billington]], played at Wimbledon between 1948 and 1951,<ref name="TimH03"/> plus representing Britain in the [[Davis Cup]] in 1948, 1950 and 1951.<ref name="TimH02">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19980628/ai_n14154213/pg_2 Profile: Tim Henman in ''The Independent'', 28 Jun 1998 by Ronald Atkin]</ref><ref name="TimH04"/> In 1901 his maternal great-grandmother, Ellen Stanwell-Brown (or Ellen Mary Stowell-Brown),<ref name="TimH06">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/wimbledon_98/behind_the_scenes/110424.stm BBC - Wimbledon, Behind the Scenes]</ref> was reputedly the first woman to serve overarm at Wimbledon.<ref name="TimH03">[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-445583-details/Henman%27s+hopes+for+girl+tennis+star/article.do Profile in ''This is London'']</ref><ref name="TimH01">[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/09/19/news/arena.php Profile in International Herald Tribune]</ref> His maternal grandmother, [[Susan Billington]], appeared regularly at Wimbledon in the 1950s, playing mixed doubles on Centre Court with her husband Henry, reaching the third round of the ladies' doubles in 1951, 1955 and 1956.<ref name="TimH04">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1533211/Susan-Billington.html Profile of Susan Billington in ''The Telegraph'']</ref><ref name="TimH01"/>

Henman was privately educated at the [[Dragon School]], Oxford and later at [[Reed's School]], [[Cobham, Surrey]], where he passed 10 [[GCSE]] exams, combining school with a tennis scholarship. Between the ages of 10 and 17 he was a member of the ''[[David Lloyd (tennis)|David Lloyd]] Slater Squad'', where he trained alongside a number of other young British tennis hopefuls. Henman won many titles at various different tournaments.

While at school, Henman was diagnosed with [[osteochondritis]], a bone disease (one form of [[chondritis]]). However, he continued to play tennis. In 1992 won the National Junior titles in singles and doubles, deciding to join the professional tour in 1993.

On 11 December 1999, Henman married his long-term girlfriend, [[television producer|TV producer]] Lucy Heald in [[Hampshire]].<ref name="BMD">[http://www.findmypast.co.uk/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp Marriages and Births England and Wales 1984-2006]</ref> Together they have three daughters, Rose Elizabeth "Rosie" (born [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|Hammersmith and Fulham]],<ref name="BMD"/> London, 19 October 2002),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2002/10/21/timbabyjoy/ |title=Fatherhood Beats Wimbledon Says Tim Henman After Baby's Birth |publisher=[[Hello Magazine]] |date=21 October 2002 |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref> Olivia Susan (born Hammersmith and Fulham,<ref name="BMD"/> 15 December 2004),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timhenman.org/aboutMe/biography.sps?itype=5889&icustompageid=8513 |title=Biography |publisher=Tim Henman (official website) |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref> and Grace (born 14 September 2007).<ref>[http://www.timhenman.org/NEWS/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=471286&itype=5883 The Official Website of Tim Henman - News - Full Story - 12:24:05 AM<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Henman supports [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United Football Club]] and is a keen [[golf]]er, playing off [[Handicap_(golf)#Scratch_and_bogey_golfers|scratch]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2101209/Tim-Henman-comes-up-to-scratch-as-a-golfer.html |title=Tim Henman comes up to scratch as a golfer |date=2008-06-09 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2138606/Tim-Henman-I-prefer-golf-to-tennis-these-days.html |title=Tim Henman: I prefer golf to tennis these days |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}</ref>

In 2010, he was appointed chief hero of England in a [[GQ]] poll.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Professional career==
Henman climbed up the rankings very quickly. In 1994, he was among the top 200 players in the world; by 1995, among the top 100; and by 1996, he had made it into the top 30 and won a medal at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Olympics]]. He was the UK's highest ranked player that year, and won the ''Most Improved Player'' trophy at the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] awards. He was subsequently elected to the ATP Tour Player Council and went on to win his first championship in January 1997. In March of that year, he underwent surgery on his elbow which kept him out of action for two months.

During his early career he became the first player ever to be disqualified from the Wimbledon tournament in 1995. The young Henman thrashed a ball in a fit of pique during a doubles match, striking ball girl Caroline Hall on the head.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/core/Content/displayPrintable.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/06/29/ftballs29.xml&site=6&page=0 |title=Strawberries, cream and BBGs |date=2006-06-29 |accessdate=2007-08-21 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |quote=[Henman] was disqualified from Wimbledon for purposefully hitting a ball at a ball girl's head | location=London | first=Bryony | last=Gordon}}</ref> He made a public apology after the incident.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/7456666.stm |title=Henman ready for new chapter |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2008-06-26 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |quote=[Henman] made a public apology after hitting a ball girl with a ball}}</ref>

Henman came to the attention of the wider tennis world in 1996 when he came from match point down to beat [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] in the first round at Wimbledon, going on to reach the quarter finals before losing to [[Todd Martin]]. By the time he reached the last 16 at the US Open later in the year, he was firmly established as a top player.

He won his first ATP Tour title in January 1997, beating [[Carlos Moy<U+00E1>]] at the Sydney International event. He again reached the quarter-final at Wimbledon. In 1998 he went one better, reaching the semi-final for the first time, by which time he was ranked as one of the top 10 ATP players. [[Image:Tim Henman backhand volley Wimbledon 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Henman playing a backhand at Wimbledon, 2004]]

"Tiger Tim" as he is known to the British tabloids and Wimbledon die hards, even today the phrase "come on Tim" nostalgically rings out from time to time (many of whom assemble on [[Henman Hill]], unofficially named after him) - came close to reaching the final on a number of occasions, losing in the semi-finals in 1998, 1999, 2001 (when just two points from victory at one point) and 2002. In 2000 he reached the fourth round and in 1996, 1997, 2003 and 2004 he lost in the quarter-finals. Two of those semi-final losses were to [[Pete Sampras]]. In another, he lost to [[Lleyton Hewitt]] who was ranked number 1 in the world at the time.

One of the tournaments in which he has been most successful is [[Queen's Club]]. He reached the final in 1999, where he lost to [[Pete Sampras]], and went on to reach the final again in 2001 and 2002, where both times he lost to Lleyton Hewitt.

2001 was arguably Henman's best Wimbledon year. He beat the emerging [[Roger Federer]] in 4 sets during the quarter-final to reach the semi-finals minus defending champion Pete Sampras who had been knocked out (by Federer). Henman faced three-time finalist [[Goran Ivani<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]], who was likewise seeking his first Wimbledon title. Ivani<U+0161>evi<U+0107> won in five sets, after rain had stopped the match in the fourth when Henman was in a dominant position, two sets to one up.

In 2002, Hemnan again reached the Wimbledon semifinals, losing to eventual champion Lleyton Hewitt in straight sets.  He reached a career-high #4 in the ATP rankings in July under the tutelage of [[Larry Stefanki]].

In 2003 Henman took his first and only ATP [[Masters Series]] title, winning the [[Paris Masters]] against [[Andrei Pavel]]. Henman beat several high-ranked players on his way to the final, including [[Nikolay Davydenko]], [[S<U+00E9>bastien Grosjean]], [[Gustavo Kuerten]], [[Roger Federer]] and [[Andy Roddick]]. He only lost one set in the entire competition. Later in the year, Henman was created an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the 2003 [[New Year's Honours List]]. He was painted by Royal artist [[Christian Furr]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.cfls01485.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/mysite/images/Tim%20Henman%20Portrait.jpg]</ref>

2004 was arguably Henman's best year on tour. Until 2004, Henman had never progressed beyond the fourth round of any grand slam apart from Wimbledon. However, at the [[French Open]] he reached the semi-finals beating many accomplished clay-court players on the way using a serve and volley technique uncommon to clay courts. He was beaten by tournament favourite and eventual runner-up [[Guillermo Coria]] after winning the first set, the first that the Argentine had lost during the championships. Henman then continued his form and reached the quarter-finals of Wimbledon. Later that year, he added another grand slam semi-final appearance, at the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]], losing to eventual champion [[Roger Federer]]. Finally, at the end of year he qualified for the year-end [[Tennis Masters Cup]], due to the above results. In the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] [[Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics|tennis event]], Henman was seeded fourth, but lost in the first round.

In 2005, he lost in straight sets to [[Nikolay Davydenko]] in the third round of the [[Australian Open]]. This was considered a disappointing result considering his improvement at Grand Slams the previous year, it would however turn out to be the last time he progressed beyond the second round of a major in his career.  He went out in the second round at both the [[French Open]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. In France, he lost in four sets to [[Luis Horna]]. At Wimbledon, he lost in five sets to [[Dmitry Tursunov]]. At the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]] he lost in straight sets in the first round to [[Fernando Verdasco]].

Henman ended an eight-match losing streak against Lleyton Hewitt on 25 March 2006, with a 7<U+2013>6, 6<U+2013>3 victory at the [[Miami Masters|Nasdaq-100]] event in [[Miami]]. However, 3 months later at the 2006 [[Queen's Club Championship|Stella Artois Championships]], Henman lost to Lleyton Hewitt 6<U+2013>3, 3<U+2013>6, 6<U+2013>2 in the semi-finals.

Henman's results in the latter part of his career saw him slip down the rankings to number 62, leading to him being unseeded at Wimbledon in 2006 for the first time in a number of years. At that Wimbledon championships, he lost in the second round to eventual champion Federer, 6<U+2013>4, 6<U+2013>0, 6<U+2013>2, after a five-set victory over [[Robin S<U+00F6>derling]] of Sweden in the first round. After this, Henman's results saw an improvement and his world ranking increased to number 39. However, he continued to suffer from injury problems.

In September 2006, Henman played two tournaments in the far east. Starting in [[PTT Bangkok Open|Bangkok]], Henman reached the Quarter Finals where he lost to [[Paradorn Srichaphan]] 6<U+2013>7 6<U+2013>4 7<U+2013>6. Henman then reached his first final since 2004 ([[Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells]]) at the [[Japan Open Tennis Championships|AIG Open]] in Tokyo, losing to [[Roger Federer]] 6<U+2013>3 6<U+2013>3.

Although Henman was scheduled to play in both Basel & Paris at the end of the 2006 season, he lost in the second round in Basel against the rising [[Switzerland|Swiss]] star [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] 2<U+2013>6, 7<U+2013>6, 6<U+2013>4. He twisted a knee; he did not retire but resorted to a less mobile game that saw Wawrinka win.

On Henman's last practice session before departing for the Australian Open at the start of 2007, having recovered from his knee injury, he injured his hamstring which forced him to withdraw from the tournament. He returned in time to enter Masters Series events in [[Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells]] and [[Miami Masters|Miami]] after withdrawing from [[ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament|Rotterdam]] & [[PBZ Zagreb Indoors|Zagreb]] but lost in the first round in both of them.

After these tournaments Henman travelled back to the UK to help defeat the [[Netherlands Davis Cup team|Netherlands]] 4<U+2013>1 by winning both his rubbers in straight sets in the Davis Cup Euro-Africa Zone match at the Birmingham NEC. The victory allowed Great Britain a play off against [[Croatia Davis Cup team|Croatia]] for the World Group in October 2007, played on Court 1 at Wimbledon. Henman took part alongside [[Andy Murray]].

Henman's poor luck with injury and form continued into the 2007 clay court season with first round losses to [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]] 7<U+2013>5 6<U+2013>2 in [[Monte Carlo Masters|Monaco]], Nicol<U+00E1>s Almagro 7<U+2013>5, 6<U+2013>1 in [[Rome Masters|Rome]] and a poor showing against 18 year old grand slam debutant [[Ernests Gulbis]] 6<U+2013>4, 6<U+2013>3, 6<U+2013>2 in the French Open. Henman's clay court season ended without a single set won.  His Grass court season got underway on 12 June 2007 at Queens Club, but was put to an abrupt end by [[Croatian people|Croatian]] wildcard entry [[Marin <U+010C>ili<U+0107>]]. However, he ended the day with a doubles victory with partner Lleyton Hewitt over Australian Jordan Kerr and Austrian Alexander Peya. An early loss at a grass court event in [[Nottingham Open|Nottingham]] was followed up with a poor showing at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], with Henman losing in the second round to [[Feliciano L<U+00F3>pez]] in 5 sets.

==Retirement==
Henman announced at a press conference on 23 August 2007 that he would retire from tennis after the [[Davis Cup]] match against [[Croatia Davis Cup team|Croatia]] in September 2007.<ref>[http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,70131-1281159,00.html Henman to hang up his racket (Sky News)]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/6954442.stm Henman to retire after GB Cup tie] [[BBC News]] retrieved 23 August 2007</ref>

Henman defeated his rival [[Dmitry Tursunov]] (who had won five of their six previous matches<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orange.co.uk/sport/news/19981.htm?linkfrom=feed_sport&link=link_6&article=sport|title=Henman delight at Tursunov victory|publisher=Orange|date=2007-08-31|accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> ) in the 1st round of the US Open 6<U+2013>4, 3<U+2013>6, 6<U+2013>3, 6<U+2013>4 in what many had assumed would be his final grand slam match. He did in fact compete in his final grand slam match on 31 August 2007 and was defeated by [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]] 7<U+2013>6 (7<U+2013>2), 2<U+2013>6, 7<U+2013>5, 6<U+2013>4 in the second round. Henman seemed slugglish compared to his first round match and threw away serving for the first set.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/6971620.stm ''Clinical Tsonga ends Henman era''] [[BBC News]] retrieved 1 September 2007</ref>

Henman played his final match in the [[Davis Cup]] tie against Croatia on 22 September 2007. The doubles match with [[Jamie Murray]] was played on Court 1 at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] which they won 4<U+2013>6, 6<U+2013>4, 7<U+2013>6, 7-5. The match put Great Britain in an unassailable 3<U+2013>0 lead and back in the World Group, with the doubles win being added to singles wins the previous day from Henman and [[Andy Murray]]. After the match Henman told Sue Barker in an interview on [[BBC]] Television and in front of the Court 1 crowd, "It's occasions like this and fans like this that I will miss so much".

At the time of his retirement Henman, had already committed to playing a Charity Exhibition at London's Royal Albert Hall during the Seniors Tennis Event The Blackrock Masters in December 2007. Henman's opponent was veteran Swede and former Wimbledon Champion [[Stefan Edberg]], Tim won the pro-set 8<U+2013>4.

Henman became part of the commentary team for the BBC coverage of the [[2008 Wimbledon Championships]] and [[2009 Wimbledon Championships]].

Henman took part in a test event for the adoption of the centre court roof in May 2009 and played mixed doubles with [[Kim Clijsters]] against husband and wife team [[Andre Agassi]] and [[Steffi Graf]].

Henman appeared on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' on 26 June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Henman on Friday night chatshow|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lc5s1}}</ref>
