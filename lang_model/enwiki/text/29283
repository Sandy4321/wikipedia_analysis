'''''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence''''' is the sixth [[studio album]] by [[Australian music|Australian]] [[Rock music|rock]] group [[Powderfinger]], released by [[Universal Records]] on [[2 June]] [[2007]] in Australia, and [[19 November]] of the same year in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was released with a limited edition bonus DVD, entitled ''Powderfinger's First XI'', featuring eleven [[music video]]s spanning the band's career, from the first single, "[[Tail (song)|Tail]]" to "[[Bless My Soul]]", the band's latest single before the release of the album.

Following the success of their previous album, ''[[Vulture Street]]'', Powderfinger toured and then spent three years on hiatus, releasing a [[best of]] album, ''[[Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000]]'', in the process.  They reunited in late 2006 to write songs for the album, which was recorded in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in early 2007 by producer [[Rob Schnapf]]. The first single from the album, "[[Lost and Running]]" was released on [[12 May]], [[2007]], and reached number five on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA singles chart]]. The second single "[[I Don't Remember]]", was released on [[12 August]], [[2007]].

The album received critical acclaim, with many reviewers commenting that the album was "consistent" and "distinctly Australian".  The album encountered controversy relating to the song "[[Black Tears]]" with claims that it may have influenced the [[Palm Island death in custody]] trial. Powderfinger released an abridged version of the song as a result of these claims.

== Background ==
[[Bernard Fanning]] stated in [[television]] interviews in 2006 that Powderfinger was working on a new album to be released the following year. The band reunited in late 2006 to write songs for the album, which was recorded in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in early 2007 by producer [[Rob Schnapf]], best known for his work with [[Beck]] and [[The Vines]].<ref name=triplej>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/review/album/s1932552.htm|title=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence|work=Music Reviews|publisher=[[Triple J]]|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> On Powderfinger's website, guitarist [[Ian Haug]] said that the upcoming album was an "exciting new direction" for the band's music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powderfinger.com/vs/news/news.asp?id=55|title=New album|publisher=Powderfinger|work=News|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> After a month of recording, on [[2 March]], [[2007]], Fanning made an announcement on Australian radio station [[Triple J]] that tracking was complete, mixing the album was to follow, and the approximate release date was June.<ref name="FanningtripleJ">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s1898994.htm|title=New Powderfinger Album Details|publisher=Triple J|work=Music News|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Fanning also stated that several of the tracks on the album feature session pianist [[Benmont Tench]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,21824774-5012327,00.html |title=Powderfinger's blitz| publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|accessdate=2007-10-02|date=[[May 13]], [[2007]]|author=McCabe, Kathy}}</ref>

''[[The Herald Sun|Herald Sun Hit]]'' announced the album's title as ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' with production by [[Rob Schnapf]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[The Herald Sun]]|work=Herald Sun Hit|url=http://www.heraldsunhit.com.au/artist/lost_running_11722.html |title=Powderfinger|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> The title of the album was drawn from the book "[[The Brooklyn Follies]]" by [[Paul Auster]], which Fanning had read during the recording. He stated the concept of the title related to [[escapism]], and that he felt it an appropriate sentiment to attach to the music of the album.<ref name="play4me">{{cite web|url=http://www.play4me.com.au/product/dream_days_at_the_hotel_existence_1489161_11722.html |title=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence|publisher=Play4Me|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

== Recording and production ==
''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' was recorded in a different manner to Powderfinger's previous records, as the band sought a different sound to past works. Melbourne's Sing Sing studios were not used for recording unlike previous albums. Following a brief blog entry on the band's [[MySpace]] [[blog]] telling fans to expect a new album, the band began recording in late January 2007 at the historic [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset Sound]] studio. Powderfinger had already written most of the album before departing to the United States, although the band had used different techniques in putting this album together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,21838719-5005381,00.html|title=Black Tears|publisher=News.com.au|work=PerthNow|accessdate=2007-11-10|author=Cameron Adams|date=[[2 June]] [[2007]]}}</ref> In particular, Powderfinger wrote songs in parts and brought them together. Some songs were written in pairs or trios, while other songs were written in parts by different people, and then combined. According to the band, this created a more "diverse" and "fresh" approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.take40.com/artist/Powderfinger|title=Powderfinger Biography|publisher=Take40|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

Another new introduction was American producer [[Rob Schnapf]].<ref name=triplej>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/review/album/s1932552.htm|title=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence|publisher=[[Triple J]]|work=Triple J music reviews|accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref> Albums had been produced previously by American producer [[Nick DiDia]]. The band used different approaches in putting the album together as "it comes back to the sound the five of us can make together", as said by singer Bernard Fanning. Powderfinger guitarist [[Darren Middleton]] commented that as a rule they preferred not to put together an album that was just "plain". As the style of writing differed, the band identified the need for piano performances in many of their songs, and enlisted veteran pianist Benmont Tench to play parts throughout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,21825563-7642,00.html|title=Finger Tips Fresh Sound|accessdate=2007-11-10|date=[[1 June]] [[2007]]|author=Noel Mengel|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|work=[[The Courier Mail]]}}</ref>

=== Critical response ===
''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' was well received by reviewers.  DVD Orchard gave the album a score of 9 (out of a possible 10), stating that Powderfinger have "maintained their undisputed knack for songwriting".  Visitors to the website gave the album the same score.<ref name=orchard>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdorchard.com.au/product.asp?PND=145147|title=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence|publisher=DVD Orchard|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> [[Herald Sun]] music journalist, Cameron Adams, described the album positively as "in a word: consistent," stating that nothing much had changed between this album and previous Powderfinger albums.<ref name="CAdams">{{cite web|publisher=[[The Herald Sun]]|work=Herald Sun Hit|url=http://www.heraldsunhit.com.au/product/dream_days_at_the_hotel_existence_1489161_11722.html |title=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence review|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Sydney Morning Herald]] reviewer Bernard Zuel said "you couldn't fault the playing, the singing or, most of the time, the arrangements here", but that "it is Powderfinger's first dull album".

== Cover art ==
''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence's'' cover art was designed by Aaron Hayward & David Homer of Debaser, a [[New South Wales]] based design organisation. The recipient of the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2007|2007 ARIA Award]] for "Best Cover Art",<ref name=Debaser>{{cite web|url=http://www.designfederation.net/news/?p=344|title=Debaser win ARIA award for 2007 album cover art|publisher=Design Federation|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref> the album art features a photograph of a road leading into the Australian outback horizon. In the centre, placed in the sky in relation to the background, there is a window with a crimson curtain. Within this window is a hotel room, as per the name of the album, in which a man with no head in a suit is seated at the end of the bed while watching the television.

[[Image:Powderfingerheader.gif|left|thumb|The typeface used on the album's cover art.]]
Above the window is the album title and at the top of the cover is the band's name in a typeface more crafty than on previous album covers. Though the general design of the cover is that of a 1930s hotel in style, the typeface juxtaposes the general design with being a rather futuristic, science-fiction styled typeset. This is the second futuristic style that the band has used for their name, the first being on their earlier studio album, ''[[Vulture Street]]''.<ref name="art">[[:Image:Dream Days at the Hotel Existence.PNG|Dream Days at the Hotel Existence cover art]]</ref>
