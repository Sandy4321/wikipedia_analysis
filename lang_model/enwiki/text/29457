'''State Highway 41''', abbreviated '''SH-41''', is a [[state highway]] mostly in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Idaho]].  It runs from [[Interstate 90 (Idaho)|Interstate 90]] in [[Post Falls, Idaho|Post Falls]] to [[U.S. Route 2]] on the [[Washington]] state line.  The northernmost {{convert|0.41|mi|km}} of SH-41 run along State Street along the state line, with the southbound lane in the town of [[Newport, Washington]], and the northbound lane in [[Oldtown, Idaho]].  The part of the highway in Washington is designated '''State Route 41'''.

==Route description==
The southern terminus of State Highway 41 is located at the intersection of Ross Point-Rathdrum Highway and Selstice Way, just south od [[I-90 (ID)|I-90]] exit 7 in the city of [[Post Falls, Idaho]].<ref>{{cite map|publisher=Rand McNally|title=The Thomas Guide Pacific Northwest Road Atlas|edition=7th|year=2006|page=354|section=D7|isbn=0528858696}}</ref>  The highway then proceeds north on the Ross Point-Rathdrum Highway, intersection [[State Highway 53 (Idaho)|State Highway 53]] in the town of [[Rathdrum, Idaho|Rathdrum]].<ref>{{cite map|publisher=Rand McNally|title=The Thomas Guide Pacific Northwest Road Atlas|edition=7th|year=2006|page=115|section=A1|isbn=0528858696}}</ref>  It passes by [[Spirit Lake, Idaho|Spirit Lake]], intersecting [[State Highway 54 (Idaho)|State Highway 54]], before turning northwest towards the [[Newport, Washington|Newport]]/[[Oldtown, Idaho|Oldtown]] area.<ref>{{cite map|publisher=Rand McNally|title=The Thomas Guide Pacific Northwest Road Atlas|edition=7th|year=2006|page=106|section=C3|isbn=0528858696}}</ref>.

Shortly after crossing the Oldtown city limits, SH-41 intersects State Avenue, which straddles the state (and city) line between Oldtown, Idaho, and [[Newport, Washington]].  North of this intersection, the northbound lanes lie in Oldtown, while the southbound lanes are known as State ''Route'' 41 by the [[Washington State Department of Transportation]], and lie in Newport.  Approximately 7 blocks north of the intersection with State Avenue, SH-41 ends at [[U.S. Route 2]].  The eastern terminus of [[Washington State Route 20]] is three blocks west of the northern terminus of SH-41.<ref name=ID-log /><ref>{{cite map|publisher=Yahoo!

==History==
State Street straddles the Washington-Idaho state line, with the southbound lane in Newport and the northbound lane in [[Oldtown, Idaho]]. Between Walnut and Fourth, the Idaho side of the street is part of State Highway 41, which runs from US-2 at the state line south to [[Interstate 90 (Idaho)|Interstate 90]] at [[Post Falls, Idaho|Post Falls]]. Until [[1997]], the Washington side of the street was part of US 2, which created confusion as each side of the street was part of a completely different highway. In 1997 the Washington side of State Street was designated SR 41 to match the Idaho numbering.
