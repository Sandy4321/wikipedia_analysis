'''Rory Storm''' (born Alan Caldwell, [[21 September]], [[1939]], in Oakhill Park Estate, [[Stoneycroft]], [[Liverpool]] died [[28 September]], [[1972]], at 'Stormville' 54 Broadgreen Road, Broadgreen, [[Liverpool]]), was the leader of '''Rory Storm and The Hurricanes''', a [[Liverpool, England|Liverpool]] band who were contemporaries of [[The Beatles]] in the late [[1950s]] and early [[1960s]].  [[Ringo Starr]] was the [[drummer]] for The Hurricanes before joining The Beatles in 1962.

The Hurricanes were one of the most popular acts on the [[Liverpool, England|Liverpool]] club scene during that era. However, their attempt at a recording career was not successful. They released only two singles, the second one being a version of the ''[[West Side Story]]'' song "America." This was the only record ever produced by Beatles manager [[Brian Epstein]].

==Death==
When Storm's father died, he returned from [[Benidorm]] (where he had been working as a DJ) to Liverpool to be with his mother. Storm developed a [[Lower respiratory tract infection|chest infection]] and could not sleep properly, so he took [[sleeping pills]]. On [[28 September]][[1972]], both Storm and his mother were found dead at their home. Some believe that this was a double [[suicide]], but a [[post mortem]] revealed that Storm had not taken enough to kill himself.<ref name="RoryStormBiog">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.tropeamagazine.it/thebeatles/mersey/rory/rory.htm |title=Rory Storm and The Hurricanes |publisher=tropea magazine |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> Storm's coffin was carried from the hearse to the cremation by Ken 'Dixie' Dean, Byrne, Vince Earl, Lee Baron and Ty Brian.<ref name="BillHarryPage1"/>

<!-- In 1960, [[Alan Williams]], who took the Beatles to [[Hamburg,  Germany|Hamburg]], [[Germany]], was involved in a recording that has become known as the Akustic Audio Session. In order for Hurricanes [[bassist]] Lu Watters to make a record of his favorite songs, "[[Summertime(song)|Summertime]]" and "[[Fever (song)|Fever]]" for relatives, he took the group's drummer, Ringo Starr, added [[John Lennon]],[[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]] of the Beatles for [[harmonies]] and had several copies of a 78 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]] disc cut at what was really a do it yourself [[recording booth]].

As [[Pete Best]] was indisposed, this marked the first time all four Beatles as they were to become appeared together.
All copies have apparently been lost, but it is possible one may turn up.
