'''Motherwell Football & Athletic Club''' are a Scottish professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Motherwell, Scotland|Motherwell]]. The club compete in the [[Scottish Premier League]] and are one of only seven teams to have remained in this league since it was founded in 1998. Motherwell have not dropped out of the top-flight of Scottish football since 1984, but have only lifted one trophy in that time - the [[Scottish Cup]] [[1990<U+2013>91 Scottish Cup|in 1991]].

Clad in the traditional claret and amber, Motherwell play their home matches at [[Fir Park Stadium]] and have done since 1896. The club's main rivals over the years have been [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]] and [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]], due in part to their close geographical proximities. The meetings of these clubs have been fairly few and far between over recent years, however since the 2008/09 season and Hamilton's promotion from the [[Scottish First Division|First Division]], the Lanarkshire derby has been somewhat revived. 



==History==
===1920s and 1930s successes===

[[File:Past Motherwell Home strips.jpg|thumb|right|A montage of Motherwell F.C. kits from 1935 to 2006.<ref>[http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Motherwell/Motherwell.htm Historical Kits]</ref>]]
Motherwell enjoyed a successful period in the aftermath of [[World War I]], managed by [[John Hunter (footballer)|John Hunter]]. The club placed third in the [[1919<U+2013>20 in Scottish football|1919<U+2013>20 season]] and, although narrowly avoiding relegation in [[1924<U+2013>25 in Scottish football|1924<U+2013>25]], they steadily climbed the table and enjoyed seven successive seasons finishing in the top three.

In the summer of 1927, the club made a very successful tour of Spain, winning six out of the eight games they played and losing only one.  These results included an emphatic 3-1 victory over [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and a 2-2 draw with current European champions, [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].  Following their success in Spain, the club went on another summer tour, this time of South America.  After losing only three of their previous ten games, the tour culminated in an embarrassing 5-0 defeat by a Brazilian League Select side<ref>[http://www.motherwellfc.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=138&Itemid=175 Motherwell FC - 1918-1929]</ref>.

Motherwell's first (and to this day, only) First Division league championship came in [[Scottish Football League 1931%E2%80%9332#First Division|1931<U+2013>32]] - with 30 wins in 38 fixtures, scoring 119 goals - a record 52 of which were scored by [[Willie MacFadyen]], who remains to this day the record holder for most goals scored in a single season and one of the club's all-time top goalscorers with 251 goals. Motherwell also contested three Scottish Cup finals in this period - in [[1930<U+2013>31 in Scottish football|1931]], [[1932<U+2013>33 in Scottish football|1933]] and [[1938<U+2013>39 in Scottish football|1939]], although they were defeated on all three occasions.

===Post-World War II period===

Following the breakup of the squad after [[World War II]], the club were not instantly successful. It then captured two major trophies in as many years with victories in the [[1950 Scottish League Cup Final]] and the [[Scottish Cup 1951-52#Final|1952 Scottish Cup Final]]. The club was then relegated for the first time ever at the end of the [[1952-53 in Scottish football|1952<U+2013>53 season]], but the club were promoted the next year. Following their return to the First Division, [[Bobby Ancell]] took management of the club in 1955 and presided over an era in which highly regarded [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] stars like [[Ian St. John]] and [[Charlie Aitken]] played for the club.  However, Motherwell were unable to keep their assets, and no trophies were won in Ancell's era. His resignation came in 1965 amidst a downturn in form which eventually saw the club relegated back to the Second Division at the conclusion of the [[1967<U+2013>68 in Scottish football|1967<U+2013>68 season]].

===1970s recovery and the McLean era===

Motherwell were immediately promoted back to the First Division in [[1968<U+2013>69 in Scottish football|1969]], maintaining a mid-table position. When the 18-team First Division was superseded by a new 10-team Premier League for the [[1975<U+2013>76 in Scottish football|1975<U+2013>76 season]], Motherwell improved to fourth in the table, but only maintained their position in the Premier League briefly. Relegation down to the now-First Division and promotion back to the Premier League occurred twice in the early 1980s, before a successful decade under manager [[Tommy McLean]] which culminated in a famous Scottish Cup win in [[1990<U+2013>91 in Scottish football|1991]]. However, as in the late 1950s, this squad's Scotland internationals - including [[Tom Boyd (footballer)|Tom Boyd]] - were sold. Fortunes initially faded, although the club reached another brief zenith with third- and second-placed Premier League finishes in the mid-1990s.

===Financial troubles===
With Tommy McLean's departure to [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] in 1994, much of his squad was broken up; a large fee in particular was paid by [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] for [[Phil O'Donnell (footballer)|Phil O'Donnell]]. Much of this money was reinvested in the squad, while the club cycled through managers including [[Alex McLeish]] and [[Harri Kampman]]. At this point, in 1997, John Boyle bought the club and installed [[Billy Davies]] as manager. Davies paid large transfer fees and wages to a number of prominent players including ex-Scotland internationals [[John Spencer (footballer)|John Spencer]] and [[Andy Goram]]. The investment though failed to provide results on the pitch, and by the end of Davies' tenure The club were in financial trouble. [[Eric Black]] was briefly in charge with the club floating near the foot of the table before it was placed in [[administration (insolvency)|administration]] in April 2002 with losses approaching [[Pound sterling|GBP]] 2,000,001 yearly.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/1948121.stm "Motherwell in turmoil"] - [[bbc.co.uk]], April 24, 2002.</ref> Black resigned, and was replaced with [[Terry Butcher]]. The club's outlook remained bleak as they were forced to make redundant or release 19 players and replace them with younger players; Boyle also placed the club up for sale.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/1958230.stm "Motherwell axe 19 players"] - [[bbc.co.uk]], April 29, 2002.</ref>  Relegation in [[2002<U+2013>03 in Scottish football|2002<U+2013>03]] - normally automatic following a last-place finish in the league - was avoided on a technicality, as First Division winners [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] lacked a stadium meeting Premier League regulations.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/falkirk/2931808.stm "Falkirk denied promotion"] - [[bbc.co.uk]], May 23, 2003.</ref>

===Emergence from administration===
Despite the lack of resources, Butcher was able to find a number of young talented players to play for the club; crucially, when many of these moved on, including [[Stephen Pearson]] and [[James McFadden]], they brought revenue in the form of transfer fees, and with John Boyle waiving the club's personal debt to him, its financial future was assured by the conclusion of the [[2004<U+2013>05 in Scottish football|2004<U+2013>05 season]] with the club's yearly losses falling to one of the lowest figures in the Premier League<ref>[http://worldsoccer.about.com/b/a/140198.htm "Scottish Soccer Clubs Still In Debt"] - [[World Soccer]], January 18, 2005.</ref> and the club coming out of administration in time to avoid a ten-point Premier League penalty which was being phased in for teams in administration<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/3433979.stm "Motherwell plans still on course"] - [[bbc.co.uk]], January 27, 2004.</ref>. On the field, the club also managed to reach the League Cup final, although they were comprehensively defeated by [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Butcher moved on to [[Sydney F.C.|Sydney]] at the end of the [[2005<U+2013>06 in Scottish football|2005<U+2013>06 season]], and was succeeded by his assistant Maurice Malpas. Malpas' stint at the club lasted just one season before his resignation in May 2007. After a short period with [[Scott Leitch]] as [[caretaker manager]], Mark McGhee was appointed to the position.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/6761427.stm McGhee named new Motherwell boss] - [[bbc.co.uk]], June 18, 2007</ref> Mark McGhee left Motherwell for the vacant managerial position at [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in June 2009.

===Return to Europe ===
[[Image:Motherwell FC training.jpg|thumb|right|Motherwell F.C. training before the Co-operative Insurance Cup match against [[Hamilton Academical F.C.]]]]
Finishing 3rd in the SPL in 2008 meant automatic qualification in the 2008 - 2009 UEFA cup. The draw on 29 August 2008 saw Motherwell pitted against [[AS Nancy]] of France. Motherwell avoided Valencia, Sparta Prague, Club Brugge and Manchester City in this draw. The first leg was played in France on 18 September with the home team winning 1<U+2013>0. The second leg was played at Fir Park on the 2 October, with Motherwell losing 2<U+2013>0, going out 3<U+2013>0 on aggregate.

Motherwell qualified for Europe for a second consecutive season and are competing in the first-ever [[UEFA Europa League]], after being awarded a [[UEFA Fair Play ranking|Fair Play]] place by [[UEFA]]. They entered the [[2009<U+2013>10 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round|first qualifying round]] on 2 and 9 July.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/8068424.stm|title=Motherwell win Europa League spot |date=2009-05-26|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>
In the first leg of their first qualifying round tie, in Jim Gannon's first match in charge, they suffered a surprise 0<U+2013>1 home defeat at the hands of Welsh Premier League runners up [[Llanelli A.F.C.|Llanelli]] at Airdrie's [[Excelsior Stadium]] (the Fir Park pitch was undergoing extensive remedial work at the time).  However in the return leg in Wales, they were comfortable 3<U+2013>0 winners, with two goals from [[John Sutton (footballer)|John Sutton]] and one from [[Jamie Murphy]], which meant that Motherwell went through 3<U+2013>1 on aggregate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/8098697.stm|title=Well confirm Euro ties in Airdrie |date=2009-06-13|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-07-01}}</ref>

Motherwell won 8-1 in the second leg, with Jamie Murphy getting a hat-trick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8164957.stm|title=Motherwell 8-1 Flamurtari|date=2009-07-23|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref> They faced [[FC Steaua Bucure<U+015F>ti|Steaua Bucharest]] of [[Romania]] in the third qualifying round only to lose 3-0 in the first leg<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8175035.stm|title=Steaua Bucharest 3-0 Motherwell |date=2009-07-30|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> and 3-1 in the second leg<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8185154.stm|title=Motherwell 1-3 Steaua B'rst (1-6) |date=2009-08-06|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-08-11}}</ref>, losing 6-1 on aggregate. Gannon was sacked in December 2009 after a fall-out with the club's board, and former Scotland manager [[Craig Brown]] was called in to replace him. Motherwell's form improved under Brown's management and the club finished fifth. Because Dundee United had finished third and won the Scottish cup, this meant that Motherwell's 5th place finish qualified them for Europe for a third successive year. Motherwell shall face Brei<U+00F0>ablik on the 15th of July at Fir Park to start their European conquest.

==Rivals==

Motherwell's main rivals are [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]] and [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]]. These matches have been rare over the years, as they have all been in different divisions, but Hamilton got promoted to the SPL in 2008 and are currently Motherwell's regular rivals in a [[Lanarkshire derby]] match. The rivalry between Motherwell and Airdrie has always been more intense, and Motherwell fans themselves see [[Airdrie United]] as their main rivals, despite Hamilton competing in the [[Scottish Premier League]].

==Records and statistics==

The club has won four major trophies in its history: the First Division in 1931<U+2013>32, the Scottish Cup in 1952 and 1991, and the Scottish League Cup in 1950. In addition, it has won the second-tier Scottish league on four occasions; as the Second Division in [[1953<U+2013>54 in Scottish football|1953<U+2013>54]] and [[1968<U+2013>69 in Scottish football|1968<U+2013>69]], and as the First Division (beneath the Premier League) in [[1981<U+2013>82 in Scottish football|1981<U+2013>82]] and [[1984<U+2013>85 in Scottish football|1984<U+2013>85]]. It also won the [[Milk Cup]], in 1983.

[[Bob Ferrier (English footballer)|Bob Ferrier]] holds the record for the number of Motherwell appearances, with 626 in the inter-war period. The goalscoring record is held by [[Hughie Ferguson]], who scored 284 league goals in 10 seasons in the 1910s and 1920s. Willie MacFadyen's 52 goals in the title-winning 1931<U+2013>32 season remains a club (and country) record for goals in one season.

Fir Park's current safety certificate limits the capacity to 13,742, [[All-seater stadium|all-seated]] in accordance with the [[Taylor Report]]. Its average home gate for the [[2006<U+2013>07 in Scottish football|2006<U+2013>07 season]] was 5,885<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team/stats?id=266&cc=5739 Motherwell Statistics 2006<U+2013>07] - [[Soccernet|ESPN Soccernet]]</ref>. The club's record attendance for a home match is 35,632, against Rangers in a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay on 12 March 1952.

On 5 May 2010, Motherwell were involved in the [[Motherwell v Hibernian (5 May 2010)|highest scoring match in the SPL]], drawing 6-6 with [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] at Fir Park, with [[Lukas Jutkiewicz]] scoring the equaliser in the 91st minute. This ecliped another high-scoring game involving Motherwell, a 6-5 defeat by [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] on 20 October 1999.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/8658858.stm | title = Motherwell 6-6 Hibernian | accessdate= 2010-05-05 }}</ref>

The record transfer fee paid by the club was to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for John Spencer in 1999 (GPB 500,000) and the highest received was that for [[Phil O'Donnell (footballer)|Phil O'Donnell]] for his move to Celtic in 1994 (GBP 1,750,000). O'Donnell later rejoined Motherwell but died after collapsing on the pitch in a game against Dundee United on 29 December 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.motherwellfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10292~1201964,00.html | title = Statement on Phil O'Donnell | accessdate= 2007-12-29 }}</ref>

Also, the 8-1 win over Flamurtari on 23 July 2009 currently stands as their record victory in European competition.

==Sponsorship==
Motherwell are currently sponsored by JAXX, a German gambling company. They replaced Anglian Home Improvements , who had been the club's shirt sponsor for 2 seasons. Previous to this the club had been sponsored by [[Zoom Airlines Limited|Zoom Airlines]], who were part-owned by club director John Boyle, and who retained advertising space on both the Davie Cooper Stand and the South Stand<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/3680261.stm| title = Well fly with new sponsor | work=BBC News | date=2004-05-03 | accessdate=2010-01-05}} - [[bbc.co.uk]], May 3, 2004</ref> until they ceased trading in August 2008.

The previous sponsor, from 2002<U+2013>04, was a local company called The Untouchables<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/2051770.stm| title = Motherwell secure shirt deal | work=BBC News | date=2002-06-18 | accessdate=2010-01-05}} - [[bbc.co.uk]], June 18, 2002</ref>. Previously the club had enjoyed a long-term association with [[Motorola]], but this ended after 11 years in 2002 as the sponsor started to reduce its manufacturing operations in Scotland. This had in turn followed another long-term association with local car dealer Ian Skelly, who had sponsored the club since 1984.

The club have had a number of different kit manufacturers since the 1970s. Taking over from [[Bukta]], New-Zealand based sporting goods manufacturer, [[Canterbury of New Zealand|Canterbury]], were announced as the official kit supplier to Motherwell for the four years beginning with the 2009-10 season. However Canterbury went into administration and in May 2010 it was announced that Puma would take over as kit manufacturer from the 2010-11 season.  Major manufacturers [[Adidas]], [[Admiral (sportswear)|Admiral]], [[Hummel International|Hummel]], [[Patrick (shoe company)|Patrick]], [[Pony International|Pony]], [[Umbro]] and [[Xara]] have all been kit providers for Motherwell.
