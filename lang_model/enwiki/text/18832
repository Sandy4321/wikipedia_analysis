'''''Out of This World Adventures''''' was a pulp magazine which published two issues, in July and December 1950.  It included several pages of comics as well as science fiction stories.  It was edited by [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and published by [[Avon Books|Avon]].  Sales were weak, and after two issues Avon decided to cancel it.

== Publication history ==
The early 1950s saw dramatic changes in the world of U.S. science fiction publishing. At the start of 1949, all but one of the major magazines in the field were in [[pulp magazine|pulp]] format; by the end of 1955, almost all had either ceased publication or switched to [[digest size|digest]] format.<ref name=AshleyV3_106>Ashley (1976), p. 106.</ref>  Despite the rapid decline of the pulp market, several new science fiction magazines were launched in pulp format during these years; ''Out of This World Adventures'' was one of these.<ref>Ashley (2000), pp. 220&ndash;223.</ref>

In 1947 [[Avon Books]] launched the ''[[Avon Fantasy Reader]]'', a series of fantasy anthologies in digest format, edited by [[Donald A. Wollheim]].{{#tag:ref|These were considered by Avon to be books, but have generally been regarded by fans and bibliographers as magazines.<ref name=Davin/>|group=note}}  Two years later, [[Joseph Meyers (publisher)|Joseph Meyers]], Avon's president, decided to launch a science fiction magazine, and Wollheim purchased six stories for it before it was cancelled for financial reasons.<ref name=Davin>Davin (2006), p. 179.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The stories were subsequently published in ''The Girl with the Hungry Eyes'', the first science fiction anthology of original material.<ref name=Davin/><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/wollheim_donald_a|title = Wollheim, Donald A.|date = 17 September 2014|accessdate = 16 October 2014|website = SF Encyclopedia|publisher = Gollancz|last = Clute|first = John|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}</ref>|group = note}} The following year, Avon's printer, J.W. Clements, suggested to Meyers the idea of a pulp magazine which included a few pages of comics.  Meyers asked Wollheim to try the idea,<ref name=":0" /> thinking that the additional section might draw comics readers to buy a pulp magazine,<ref name=":2" /> and in July 1950 Wollheim duly launched ''Sparkling Love Stories ''and ''Out of This World Adventures''.<ref name=":0" /><ref>Nevins (2007), p. 176.</ref>  The romance magazine was cancelled after a single issue because of poor sales; but ''Out of This World Adventures'' seemed promising enough to try a second issue, which appeared in December 1950, along with a third magazine in the part-comic format: ''Pioneer Western''.<ref name=":0" /><ref>Dinan (1983), p. 49.</ref>  Neither sold well enough to extend their runs any further.<ref name=":0" />

[[Donald A. Wollheim]] was the editor for both issues.  His editorial policy was slanted towards interplanetary fiction, according to his editorial in the first issue.  The magazine included stories by several writers who were either already well-known or who would go on to more success; the first issue featured [[A.E. van Vogt]], [[Lester del Rey]], [[Kris Neville]], [[William Tenn]], [[Mack Reynolds]], [[Ray Cummings]] and [[A. Bertram Chandler]].  Science fiction historians [[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]] and Wendy Bousfield both regard Tenn's story, "The Puzzle of Priipiirii", as the best in the magazine.<ref name=":0" />  The 32-page comics section, which was taken directly from an existing Avon comic called ''Out of This World,'' included comics written by [[John Michel]] and [[Gardner Fox]]; the latter, a pastiche of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s "[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]" stories, was titled "Crom the Barbarian" and was illustrated by [[John Giunta]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">Ashley (2005), pp. 4<U+2212>5.</ref>  Michel, like Wollheim a member of the [[Futurians]], a group of sf fans and aspiring writers, wrote the lead comic for both issues,<ref>Davin (2006), p. 174.</ref> though the second issue of the Canadian edition used a different comic section than the U.S. edition.<ref name=":1" />  The interior artwork was the responsibility of Avon's art director, rather than Wollheim, and illustrators such as William McWilliam, who worked on Avon's comics, were used.<ref name=":0">Bousfield (1985), pp. 467&ndash;471.</ref>
