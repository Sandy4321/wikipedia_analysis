'''''Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers''''' is the 1971 (see [[1971 in music]]) debut album of [[Hound Dog Taylor|Theodore Roosevelt "Hound Dog" Taylor]].  

Cub Coda of [[Allmusic]] describes it as "wild, raucous, crazy music straight out of the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] clubs", and calls it "one of the greatest [[slide guitar]] albums of all time".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r104518/review|pure_url=yes}} All Music Guide: Hound Dog Taylor and the Houserockers]</ref>  ''The Penguin Guide to Blues Recordings'' describes its sound as "loud, harsh, boxy and exciting".<ref>Russell, T. and Smith, C. (2006): ''The Penguin guide to Blues Recordings'', London: Penguin Books </ref>

Originally issued on [[LP album|LP]] as the first release on the [[Alligator Records|Alligator]] label, it has subsequently been reissued on [[CD]].

==Background==

As well as being Taylor's debut album, ''Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers'' was the first release on the [[Alligator Records|Alligator]] label.   The label was founded by [[Bruce Iglauer]] for the specific purpose of releasing an album of Taylor's music after he had been unable to persuade [[Bob Koester]], then his boss at [[Delmark Records|Delmark]], to record Taylor.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p543/biography|pure_url=yes}} All music Guide: Hound Dog Taylor Biography]</ref>

The album features only three musicians: Taylor himself on vocals and slide guitar, Brewer Phillips on [[guitar]] and Ted Harvey on [[Drum kit|drums]].  For solos, the two guitarists alternate between playing lead and accompanying the other guitarist.

The record sold 9,000 copies in its first year, a large number for a blues record on an independent label, and by 1998 had sold around 100,000 copies.  At the time of the recording, Taylor was playing locally in taverns, but the higher profile the album's success gave him enabled him to obtain work further afield, eventually touring as far away as Australia.<ref>[http://www.furious.com/perfect/hounddogtaylor.html Perfect Sound Forever: interview with Bruce Iglauer by Jason Gross, June 1998]</ref>

Further material from the same sessions was released on the posthumous album ''Genuine Houserocking Music''.
