The '''Greater Rhea''' (''Rhea americana'') is a [[flightless bird]] found in eastern [[South America]]. Other names for the Greater Rhea include the '''Grey''', '''Common''', '''American Rhea''', '''<U+00F1>and<U+00FA>''' ([[Guaran<U+00ED> language|Guaran<U+00ED>]]) or '''ema''' ([[Portuguese (language)|Portuguese]]). One of two species in the genus [[Rhea (bird)|Rhea]], in the family [[Rheidae]], the Greater Rhea is endemic to [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Uruguay]]. It inhabits a variety of open areas, such as [[grassland]]s, [[savanna]] or grassy wetlands. Weighing {{convert|50|-|55|lb|kg}}, the Greater Rhea is the largest bird in South America.<ref name="Davies"/> In the wild, the Greater Rhea has a life expectancy of 10.5 years.<ref name=BLI>Birdlife International (2008)</ref> It is also notable for its reproductive habits, and for the fact that a group has established itself in [[Germany]] in recent years. {{fact|date=July 2012}}

==Taxonomy==
The Greater Rhea derives its scientific name from [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], a Greek goddess, and the Latinized form of America.<ref>Gotch, A.F. (1995)</ref> It was originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus]]<ref name="Davies"/> in his 18th-century work, [[Systema Naturae]] under the name Struthio camelus americanus.<ref name="L"/> He identified specimens from [[Sergipe]], and [[Rio Grande do Norte]], [[Brazil]], in 1758.<ref name="Davies"/> They are from the family Rheidae, and the order [[Struthioniformes]], commonly known as [[ratite]]s.  They are joined in this order by [[Emu]]s, [[Ostrich]]es, [[Cassowary|cassowaries]], and [[kiwi]]s, along with the extinct forms [[moa]]s, and [[elephant bird]]s.

===Subspecies===
There are five [[subspecies]] of the Greater Rhea; their ranges meet around the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]:<ref name=Folch />
* ''R. a. americana'' &ndash; campos of northern and eastern [[Brazil]]<ref name="Cornell">Hodes, C. (2010)</ref>
* ''R. a. intermedia'' &ndash; [[Uruguay]] and extreme southeastern [[Brazil]] ([[Rio Grande do Sul]] state)<ref name="Cornell" />
* ''R. a. nobilis'' &ndash; eastern [[Paraguay]], east of [[Rio Paraguay]]<ref name="Cornell" />
* ''R. a. araneipes'' &ndash; chaco of [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]] and the [[Mato Grosso]] state of [[Brazil]]<ref name="Cornell" />
* ''R. a. albescens'' &ndash; plains of [[Argentina]] south to the [[Rio Negro Province|Rio Negro]] province<ref name="Cornell" />

Main subspecific differences are the extent of the black coloring of the throat and the height.<ref name="SN" /> However, subspecies of the Greater Rhea differ so little across their range that, without knowledge of the place of origin, it is essentially impossible to identify captive birds by subspecies.<ref name=Folch />

==Description==
[[File:greater rhea in english wildlifepark arp.jpg|thumb|left|Greater Rhea, closeup, [[Cricket St Thomas]] Wildlife Park (Somerset, England)]]
The adults have an average weight of {{convert|20|-|27|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and often measure {{convert|127|to|140|cm|in|abbr=on}} long from beak to tail; they usually stand about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall to the top of the head.<ref name="Davies"/> The males are generally bigger than the females. Large males can weigh up to {{Convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, stand nearly {{convert|1.83|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall and measure over {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, although this is rare.<ref name="Davies">Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003)</ref><ref>McFie, H. (2003)</ref><ref name = "Mercolli & Yanosky">Mercolli, C. & Yanosky, A. (2001)</ref>

The head and [[Beak|bill]] are fairly small, the latter measuring {{convert|8|-|10.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length.<ref name="Davies"/> The legs are long, with the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] measuring between {{convert|33.5|and|37|cm|in|abbr=on}},<ref name = "Bologna">Bologna, G. (1981)</ref><ref name="Davies"/> and strong and have 22 horizontal plates on the front of the tarsus. They have three toes, and the hind toe is absent. The wings of the American rhea are rather long; the birds use them during running to maintain balance during tight turns, and also during coutship displays.

Greater Rheas have a fluffy, tattered-looking plumage, that is gray or brown, with high individual variation, The head, neck, rump, and thighs are feathered.<ref name="Davies"/> In general, males are darker than females. Even in the wild&mdash;particularly in Argentina&mdash;[[leucistic]] individuals (with white body plumage and blue eyes) as well as [[albino]]s occur. Hatchling Greater Rheas are grey with dark lengthwise stripes.<ref name="Folch">Folch, A. (1992)</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
The Greater Rhea is endemic to [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Uruguay]].<ref name=IUCN2012/> This species inhabits grassland dominated by [[satintail]] (''Imperata'') and [[bahiagrass]] (''Paspalum'') species,<ref name = "Mercolli & Yanosky" /> as well as [[savanna]], scrub forest, [[chaparral]], and even [[desert]] and [[palustrine]]<ref>Accordi, I. & Barcellos, A. (2006)</ref> lands, though it prefers areas with at least some tall vegetation. It is absent from the [[humid]] [[tropical]] forests of the [[Mata Atl<U+00E2>ntica]] and [[planalto]] uplands along the coast of Brazil<ref>Bencke, G. (2007)</ref> and extends south to 40<U+00B0> [[latitude]]. They prefer lower elevation and seldom go above {{convert|1200|m|ft}}.<ref name=BLI/> During the breeding season (spring and summer), it stays near water.

A small population of the Greater Rhea has become established in [[Germany]]. Three pairs escaped from a farm in [[Gross Gr<U+00F6>nau]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], in August 2000. These birds survived the winter and succeeded in breeding in a habitat sufficiently similar to their native South American range. They eventually crossed the [[Wakenitz]] river and settled in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] in the area around and particularly to the north of [[Thandorf]] village.<ref name="Schuh">Schuh, H. (2003)</ref> As of late 2000 the population was estimated to be seven birds and in 2001 eighteen birds. In October 2008 the population was estimated by two German scientists at around 100 birds.<ref>Korthals, A. & F. Philipp (2008)</ref>

==Behavior==

===Individual and flock behavior===
The Greater Rhea is a silent bird except during mating season, when they make low booming noises, and as chicks, when they give a mournful whistle.<ref name="Davies"/> During the non-breeding season they will form flocks of between 10 and 100 birds. When in flocks, they tend to be less vigilant, but the males can get aggressive towards other males. When chased they will flee in a zig-zag pattern, alternately raising one wing then the other. These flocks break up in the winter in time for breeding season.<ref name="Davies"/>

===Feeding and diet===
[[File:Mercedes Cossio 2.jpg|thumb|right|Wild Greater Rhea (probably ''R. a. albescens'') in habitat. [[Goya Department]], [[Corrientes Province]], [[Argentina]]]]
The bulk of its food consists of broad-leaved [[dicot]] [[foliage]] and other plantstuffs, particularly [[seed]] and [[fruit]] when in season. Favorite food plants include native and introduced [[species]] from all sorts of dicot [[family (biology)|families]], such as [[Amaranthaceae]], [[Asteraceae]], [[Bignoniaceae]],<ref name="Azevedo"/> [[Brassicaceae]], [[Fabaceae]],<ref name="Azevedo"/> [[Lamiaceae]],<ref name="Azevedo"/> [[Myrtaceae]]<ref name="Azevedo"/> or [[Solanaceae]].<ref name="Azevedo"/> [[Magnoliids|Magnoliidae]] fruit, for example of ''[[Duguetia furfuracea]]'' ([[Annonaceae]]) or [[avocados]] (''Persea americana'', [[Lauraceae]]) can be seasonally important. They do not usually eat [[cereal]] grains, or [[monocots]] in general. However, the leaves of particular [[grass]] species like ''[[Brachiaria brizantha]]'' can be eaten in large quantities, and [[Liliaceae]] (e.g. the [[Smilax|sarsaparilla]] ''[[Smilax brasiliensis]]'') have also been recorded as foodplants. Even tough and spiny vegetable matter like [[tuber]]s or [[thistle]]s is eaten with relish. Like many birds which feed on tough plant matter, the Greater Rhea swallows [[pebble]]s which help grind down the food for easy digestion. It is much attracted to sparkling objects and sometimes accidentally swallows metallic or glossy objects.<ref name=Folch /><ref name="Azevedo">Azevedo et al. (2006)</ref>

[[File:Nandu Ger.jpg|thumb|left|Feral Greater Rhea in [[cereal]] field in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Germany]]. The species normally uses such [[monoculture]]s to hide rather than to feed on the plants.]]
In [[field (agriculture)|field]]s and [[plantation]]s of plants they do not like to eat, e.g., [[cereal]]s or [[eucalyptus]], the Greater Rhea can be a species quite beneficial to farmers. It will eat any large [[invertebrate]] it can catch; its food includes [[locust]]s and [[grasshopper]]s, [[true bug]]s, [[cockroach]]es, and other [[pest (organism)|pest]] [[insect]]s. Juveniles eat more animal matter than adults. In mixed ''[[cerrado]]'' and agricultural land in [[Minas Gerais]] (Brazil), ''R. a. americana'' was noted to be particularly fond of [[beetle]]s. It is not clear whether this applies to the species in general but for example in [[pampas]] habitat, beetle consumption is probably lower simply due to availability while [[Orthoptera]] might be more important. The Greater Rhea is able to eat [[Hymenoptera]] in quantity. These [[insect]]s contain among them many who can give painful [[insect sting|stings]], though the birds do not seem to mind. It may be that this species has elevated resistance to poison, as it readily eats [[scorpion]]s. But even small [[vertebrate]]s like [[rodent]]s, [[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, and small [[bird]]s are eaten. Sometimes, Greater Rheas will gather at [[carrion]] to feed on [[fly|flies]]; they are also known to eat dead or dying [[fish]] in the dry season, but as vertebrate prey in general not in large quantities.<ref name=Folch /><ref name="Azevedo"/>

===Predators===
The natural [[predator]]s of adult Greater Rheas are limited to the [[Cougar]] (''Puma concolor'') and the [[Jaguar]] (''Panthera onca''). [[feral|Feral dog]]s are known to kill younger birds, and the [[Southern Caracara]] (''Caracara plancus'') is suspected to prey on hatchlings. [[Armadillo]]s sometimes feed on Greater Rhea eggs; nests have been found which had been undermined by a [[Six-banded Armadillo]] (''Euphractus sexcinctus'') or a [[Big Hairy Armadillo]] (''Chaetophractus villosus'') and the rhea eggs were broken apart.<ref name = "Mercolli & Yanosky " />

Captive-bred Greater Rheas exhibit significant [[ecological na<U+00EF>vete]]. This fearlessness renders them highly vulnerable to predators if the birds are released into the wild in [[reintroduction]] projects. [[Classical conditioning]] of Greater Rhea juveniles against predator models can prevent this to some degree, but the [[personality type]] of the birds<U+2014>whether they are bold or shy<U+2014>influences the success of such training. In 2006, a protocol was established for training Greater Rheas to avoid would-be predators, and for identifying the most cautious animals for release.<ref>Azevedo, C. S. de & Young, R. (2006)</ref>

===Reproduction===
[[File:Baby Rhea americana.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Two-month old Greater Rhea in [[Tierpark Hagenbeck]] with hatchling at its feet]]
After the large flocks break up in the winter, they form into three loose groups: single males, flocks of between two to fifteen females, and a large flock of yearlings. As this time approaches, males become more aggressive towards each other. Then they start couring females by calling and raising the front of their body up while keeping their nech straight and ruffling their plumage. They will raise their wings and may run some distance like this, sometime flapping their wings methodically. After doing this and attracting females, they will continue calling at a specific female, and will start to either walk along side her or in front of her while spreading his wings and lowering his head. As the display continues, he will get more intense and animated and start waving his neck around and in figure eights. Once he has attracted a first mate he will copulate with her and then lead her to his nest.<ref name="Davies"/>  When it is time for the eggs to be laid, the male will typically be on the nest already and will act aggressive when approaced by the female, covering his nest with his wings. He will gradually relax and allow her to crouch and lay the egg at the edge of the nest. The male will roll the egg into his nest. Males are simultaneously [[polygynous]], females are serially [[polyandrous]]. In practice, this means that the females move around during breeding season, mating with a male and depositing their eggs with the male before leaving him and mating with another male. Males on the other hand are sedentary, attending the nests and taking care of incubation and the hatchlings all on their own. Although recent evidence suggest that dominant males may enlist a subordinate male to roost for him while he starts a second nest with a second harem.<ref name="Davies" />  The nests are thus collectively used by several females and can contain as many as 80 [[egg (biology)|eggs]] laid by a dozen females; each individual female's [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] numbers some 5<U+2013>10 eggs.<ref name=Folch /> However, the average clutch size is 26 with 7 different females eggs.<ref name="Davies" /> Recent evidence has shown that some males will utilize subordinate males to help incubate and protect the eggs. If this happens, the dominant male will find a second harem and start the process over again.</ref name="Davies"/>

Rhea eggs measure about {{Convert|130|x|90|mm|in|abbr=on}} and weigh {{Convert|600|g|oz|abbr=on}} on average; they are thus less than half the size of an [[ostrich]] egg. Their shell is greenish-yellow when fresh but soon fades to dull cream when exposed to light. The nest is a simple shallow and wide scrape in a hidden location; males will drag sticks, grass, and leaves in the area surrounding the nest so it resembles a firebreak as wide as their neck can reach.
The incubation period is 29<U+2013>43 days. All the eggs hatch within 36 hours of each other even though the eggs in one nest were laid perhaps as much as two weeks apart.<ref name="Davies" /> As it seems, when the first young are ready to hatch they start a call resembling a pop-bottle rocket or even [[fireworks]], even while still inside the egg, thus the hatching time is coordinated. Greater Rheas are half-grown about three months after hatching, and sexually mature by their 14th month.

==Status==
The Greater Rhea is considered a [[Near Threatened]] species according to the [[IUCN]], and they have a decreasing range of about {{convert|6540000|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name=BLI/> The species is believed to be declining due to increased hunting<ref name=IUCN2012/> and the conversion of central South American grasslands to farmland and ranchland.<ref>Giordano, P.F. et al. (2008)</ref> The populations of Argentina and Uruguay are most seriously affected by the decline.<ref name=Folch />

Farmers sometimes consider the Greater Rhea pests, because they will eat broad-leaved crop plants, such as [[cabbage]], [[chard]] and [[bok choi]].<ref name="Handbook">Elliott, Andrew (1992)</ref> Where they occur as [[pest (organism)|pest]]s, farmers tend to hunt and kill Greater Rheas. The burning of crops in [[South America]] has also contributed to their decline.<ref>Goriup, P.D. (1988)</ref>

International trade in wild-caught Greater Rheas is restricted as per [[CITES Appendix II]].<ref>CITES (1990)</ref>

The rheas in Germany are legally protected in a similar way to native species. In its new home, the Greater Rhea is considered generally beneficial as its browsing helps maintain the [[habitat]] diversity of the sparsely populated grasslands bordering the [[Schaalsee]] [[biosphere reserve]].<ref name="Schuh" />

==Relationship to humans==
This species is farmed in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] similar to the [[Emu]] and [[Ostrich]]. The main products are [[meat]] and [[egg (food)|eggs]], but [[rhea oil]] is used for cosmetics and soaps and rhea [[leather]] is also traded in quantity. Male Greater Rheas are very territorial during the breeding season. The infant chicks have high mortality in typical confinement farming situations, but under optimum free-range conditions chicks will reach adult size by their fifth month.
