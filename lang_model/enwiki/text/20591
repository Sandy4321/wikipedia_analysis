'''GameSpy Arcade''' is a [[shareware]] [[multiplayer]] [[game server browser|game server browsing]] utility designed for the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system. Gamespy arcade allows players to view and connect to available multiplayer games, and chat to other users of the service. It was initially released by GameSpy Industries, a division of IGN Entertainment, in early 2000, to replace the ageing GameSpy3D program. Version 2 is the latest offering of the software, boasting additional features such as increased speed and advanced server sorting abilities. Currently, the best patch is 2.0.5

==Features==
GameSpy Arcade includes various other features which enhance its overall functionality. These include:-
*Ability for users to have their own profiles .
*Scanning a user<U+2019>s hard disk for Arcade compatible games.
*A basic web browser.
*Voice Chat
*Buddy List

==Subscription Levels==
GameSpy arcade is essentially free however the software maintains shareware status as there are three different subscription levels which provide extra benefits according to their price.

'Basic users' can be created for free at the GameSpy website and are able to display and connect to games, as well as chat to users inside the game lobby. Various advertisements are shown inside the program for these users.

'GameSpy Arcade', the first pay subscription service, provides extended functionality such as no advertisements and in game voice chat, as well as priority service for technicians to assist in solving problems with the software.

'Founders Club', the second pay subscription service, is the highest possible level of membership to GameSpy arcade. This subscription has benefits which apply across the entire GameSpy network, including FilePlanet access, and <U+2018>Insider<U+2019> newsletters. This is the most expensive of the subscriptions on offer.

==Gaming==
GameSpy Arcade allows one to game online with games such as [[Halo]], [[Command & Conquer: Renegade]], [[Counter Strike]], [[Unreal Tournament 2004]], and other first person games. Additionally, there '''was''' Parlor Games, but these were removed due to hacking. Some of the Parlor Games that existed were Y.A.R.N (story making) [[Reversi]], [[Poker]], [[Checkers]], [[Chess]],and [[Backgammon]]. Also, GameSpy Arcade's chat allows roleplay in a simple fashion ("/me" command is used to roleplay)

==Criticism==
Gamespy has often been criticized for showing more concern regarding minor issues such as swearing inside the programs chat system, while the issue of spam is left unattended to. More recently, the issue of spam has been given more focus, with a new warning message whenever a user joins a game lobby.

Some users feel that they have been pressured into using the GameSpy Arcade software, as there is no other alternative with sufficient game support or the large user base. This was especially the case with the recent closing of [[MSN Gaming Zone]], an alternative game server software. Many of the games previously supported by MSN Gaming Zone were moved to GameSpy Arcade, forcing users to install the new software to be able to continue playing these games online.

Also, many users feel that GameSpy Arcade is irrelevant and that ingame server browsers suffice.
