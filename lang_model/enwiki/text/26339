The '''Platte Canyon High School hostage crisis''' was an incident of a [[hostage taking]] and shooting that occurred at [[Platte Canyon High School]] in [[Bailey, Colorado|Bailey]], [[Colorado]], on September 27, 2006.

About 11:40 a.m.,<ref name="denverpost" /> Morrison entered the school carrying a [[.40 S&W|.40]]-[[caliber]] [[Glock pistol|Glock 22]] pistol <ref name="denver5552493">{{cite news | author = Jim Spencer | title =  Firearms culture gives a 15-gun salute to irony  | url = http://www.denverpost.com/ci_5552493 | accessdate = December 6, 2008 | work=Denver Post | date=March 30, 2007}}</ref> and a backpack, which he claimed contained [[explosive]]s. One report attributed to the local police stated that Morrison fired a single shot using his [[handgun]] when a teacher did not do what he asked.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news | author = BBC World News | title = US school siege ends in bloodshed | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5387062.stm | accessdate = September 27, 2006  | date=September 28, 2006 | work=BBC News}}</ref>

A sixteen-year-old student named Katrina Keller reportedly saw Morrison entering the school before the time specified by police. She stated that she had been walking past a vacant classroom and saw a man inside wearing a hooded sweatshirt, apparently angry. Keller did not report the incident to the school office.<ref name="gazette" /> Other students reported that they witnessed Morrison sitting in a yellow [[Jeep]] in the school parking lot at around 10:45 a.m., almost an hour before he entered the school. Morrison was believed to have been living in the car, camping out near Bailey.<ref name="rmn2">{{cite web | author = Rocky Mountain News | title = Student admits he lied to TV news shows | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5027867,00.html | accessdate = September 28, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060929153651/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5027867,00.html |archivedate = September 29, 2006}}</ref> Videos taken from security cameras outside show that Morrison was in his Jeep for at least 20 minutes, mingling with students as classes changed, 35 minutes before the siege began. Earlier, Morrison had spoken to a male high school student that day and "asked about the identity of a list of female students."<ref name="gazette2">{{cite web | author = The Gazette | title = Bailey gunman wrote of coming death  | url = http://www.gazette.com/display.php?id=1322126&secid=1 | accessdate = September 30, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930160330/http://www.gazette.com/display.php?id=1322126&secid=1 |archivedate = September 30, 2007}}</ref>

After entering a classroom on the second floor, where teacher Sandra Smith taught Honors English, Morrison fired his handgun into the air and instructed all of the students to stand facing the [[chalkboard]]. [[Park County, Colorado|Park County]] sheriff Fred Wegener informed the media that all the girls were molested, though he did not know "how much or to what degree."<ref name="cnn3">{{cite news | author = CNN | title = Sheriff: School shooter sent letter to say sorry | url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/09/29/school.shooting/index.html | accessdate = September 29, 2006 }}</ref> Lynna Long, a 15-year-old [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]] and one of the six hostages, stated that Duane Morrison lined the girls up facing a chalkboard and then sexually assaulted all of them;<ref name="WBBM">{{cite web | author = WBBM News Radio Chicago | title = Colorado Gunman Said Sent Letter Warning of Death | url =  http://www.wbbm780.com/pages/94468.php?contentType=4&contentId=214824 | accessdate = September 29, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927000518/http://www.wbbm780.com/pages/94468.php?contentType=4&contentId=214824 |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}</ref> Long stated that she knew that the other hostages were being molested because of "the rustling of clothes and elastic being snapped and zippers being opened and closed."<ref name="gazette2" />

===Negotiations and evacuations===
A "code white" alert was sounded over the intercom and students were instructed to remain in their classrooms.<ref name="theage">{{cite news | author = The Age | title = US school hostage dies in hospital | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/US-school-hostage-dies-in-hospital/2006/09/28/1159337244606.html | accessdate = September 27, 2006 | location=Melbourne | date=September 28, 2006}}</ref> Negotiations with Morrison began with the goal of allowing the six remaining hostages in the room to be released.<ref name="denverpost" /> He spoke via telephone and used the student hostages as relayers between the [[negotiators]] and himself, as he did not want to speak directly with officials.  After four of the six girls were released, negotiators heightened the intensity of their indirect discussions with Morrison.<ref name="denverpost" /> During this time, 16-year-old junior Emily Keyes, one of the two remaining hostages, managed to send her family a brief [[short message service|text message]] stating, "I love u guys"<ref name="cnn2" /> in response to a text message ("R U OK?") her father, John-Michael Keyes, had sent using his cell phone after receiving word that an incident was occurring at the high school. When Keyes' father sent the message "Where are you?" he received no response.<ref name="rmn3">{{cite web | author = Rocky Mountain News | title = Bailey victim's parents praise police | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5045175,00.html | accessdate = November 23, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061112002131/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5045175,00.html |archivedate = November 12, 2006}}</ref>

A total of 800 students from both [[Platte Canyon High School]] and the nearby Fitzsimmons Middle School were rapidly evacuated.<ref name="bbc" /> Morrison's demands were unknown, although police confirmed that his primary concern was a request for the police to back away. All students, except the hostages, were safely evacuated by 12:10 p.m.<ref name="cnn">{{cite news | author = CNN.com | title = Gunman, hostage dead after high school siege | url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/09/27/school.shooting/index.html | accessdate = September 27, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060928005535/http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/09/27/school.shooting/index.html |archivedate = September 28, 2006}}</ref> and by 3:00 p.m. all had been taken to Deer Creek Elementary School.<ref name="denverpost" /> Parents were able to gain little information from authorities, who remained silent regarding the issue while the crisis continued.<ref name="theage" />

By the time the four student hostages were released, a [[bomb squad]], [[SWAT]] team from [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson County]], and agents from the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] were sent to the scene.<ref name="cnn" /> Ambulances parked in the end zone of the high school's football field.<ref name="theage" /> A 4-mile (6&nbsp;km) stretch of [[U.S. Route 285]] was closed. Morrison explicitly stated that he would stop negotiating at 4:00 p.m.<ref name="denverpost" />

Sheriff Fred Wegener (whose son was in the school building at the time of the incident)<ref name="rmn" /> said that police had chosen to storm the second-floor classroom after the man ended negotiations,<ref name="bbc" /> stating that "something would happen at 4 p.m." SWAT team members witnessed Morrison assaulting the girls, and Wegener made the decision to save the hostages by force, stating later, "My decision was either wait&mdash;<nowiki>[and have the]</nowiki> possibility of having two dead hostages or act and try to save what I feared he would do to them. ... Because I'd want whoever was in my position to do the same thing, and that is to save lives."<ref name="gazette" /> The police burst through the door at approximately 3:45 p.m. After using the hostages as [[human shield]]s against the [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson County]] [[SWAT]] team, Morrison shot at the policemen,<ref name="rmn" /> and then at Emily Keyes,<ref name="denverpost" /> who was trying to run.<ref name="rmn3" /> Morrison committed [[suicide]] soon thereafter.<ref name="cnn" /> Keyes was taken by helicopter to a hospital in Denver, where she was pronounced dead at 4:32 p.m. The other hostage survived with no physical injuries.<ref name="bbc" /> Investigators found no sign of explosives in the man's backpack,<ref name="cnn" /> but an [[assault rifle]] was found in a clearing adjacent to a river about a mile north of the school.<ref name="gazette2" />

The coroner of Park County, Sharon Morris, confirmed that the body of Morrison (which had four bullet wounds, three nonfatal from police and one fatal shot from his own gun)<ref name="rmn2" /> was still in the second-floor classroom as of 6:00 p.m. District officials stated that both the high school and Fitzsimmons Middle School would be closed for September 28 and September 29; a counseling center set up at a local church would open at 7:00 a.m. for students.<ref name="rmn" />

Platte Canyon High School reopened a week after the shooting on October 5. Memorials had been erected along the highway leading to the school that carried messages such as "Be Strong" and "Random Acts of Kindness". A number of students prayed in front of the school before the day began and students were given donated [[teddy bear]]s as they left. Fifty counselors were present during the day for students.<ref name="gazette3">{{cite web | author = The Gazette | title = Bailey schools resume classes  | url = http://www.gazette.com/display.php?id=1322300 | accessdate = November 23, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930160848/http://www.gazette.com/display.php?id=1322300 |archivedate = September 30, 2007}}</ref><ref name="stl">{{cite web | author= St. Louis Post-Dispatch | publisher = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | title= High school reopens a week after shooting | url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/24738666DC0BEFBA862571FF00134739?OpenDocument | accessdate = November 23, 2006 }} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Superintendent Dr. James Walpole noted that of 460 high school students, only 10 were absent.<ref name="rmn3" />

The procession of motorcycles was so long that the first to get to Platte Canyon High School arrived as the final motorcyclists departed from Columbine High School, two riding alongside each other.<ref name="kutv">{{cite news | author= KUTV.com | publisher = KUTV.com | title= Thousands Ride In Honor Of Slain Student | url= http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-10-08-standoff-benefit_x.htm | accessdate = November 23, 2006 | date=October 8, 2006}}</ref>

The efforts initiated toward increased school security had come to a standstill several years after the [[Columbine High School massacre]] as federal and state funding toward safety was cut in favor of higher test scores. Although an increase in communication with law enforcement was evident in the Platte Canyon High School shooting, Del Elliot of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] noted that "[the vast majority of school districts] are so totally absorbed with [[Colorado Student Assessment Program|CSAP]] and academic requirements that they aren't spending a lot of time and resources on this issue".<ref name="denverpost2">{{cite news | author= Jennifer Brown and Kevin Simpson | publisher = The Denver Post | title= Momentum for school safety at standstill | url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_4407834 | accessdate = November 23, 2006 | date=September 27, 2006}}</ref>

By October 11, investigators had conducted 124 interviews and had found 174 pieces of evidence related to the case. They were also investigating the [[Amish school shooting]] in [[Pennsylvania]], which had occurred five days after the shooting in Bailey. As a result of the September 27 incident, Platte Canyon High School increased its security, leaving only one school entrance unlocked. It plans to install more security cameras. Park County Sheriff Fred Wegener proposed having a guard there during the school day, but he stated that that particular suggestion was outside the current budget.<ref name="7news" />

Police announced that a suicide letter written by perpetrator Duane Morrison to a family member was being analyzed by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Morrison's family gave the letter to police, who then submitted the document to the FBI Behavioral Unit in [[Quantico, Virginia]].<ref name="kutv">{{cite web | author= Reuters | publisher = Reuters | title= FBI to analyze letter from Colo. school shooter | url= http://www.topix.net/content/reuters/2842841998046702310702849423911381971598 | accessdate = November 23, 2006 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
