'''Deletionpedia''' is a web site containing articles [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|deleted]] from [[Wikipedia]].  Its articles preserve most Wikipedia article content, such as [[Help:Infobox|infoboxes]], references and [[Wikipedia:Categorization|categories]].  Deletionpedia's version of each article includes a header with more information about the deletion, such as (if applicable) whether a [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] occurred, where on Wikipedia the delete discussion about the article can be found, and who did the deletion.
==Function==
The site is based on [[MediaWiki]], though updates have been [[Botsourcing|botsourced]].  Deletionpedia has collected about 64,000 articles, currently{{update after|2009|1|1}} limited to those deleted from Wikipedia between February and September 2008.<ref>[http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Category:Deletionpedia:Pages_by_deletion_date  Category:Deletionpedia:Pages by deletion date], from the Deletionpedia website</ref>

In addition to categories from Wikipedia, Deletionpedia adds its own categories to articles, based on various deletion criteria.  It organizes pages by what month they were deleted, by how many editors had worked on a page, by how long they had lasted on Wikipedia (thousands of pages lasted over 1000 days before they were deleted<ref>[http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Category:Deletionpedia:Pages_on_Wikipedia_for_1000_or_more_days Deletionpedia:Pages on Wikipedia for 1000 or more days], from the Deletionpedia website</ref>), and [[Wikipedia:Lists|pages which are lists]], among other criteria.

Deletionpedia states that it avoids hosting deleted pages that are copyright violations, pages with serious libel problems, pages whose full [[Help:Page history|revision history]] is still available on [[:Category:Wikimedia projects|Wikipedia's sister sites]], and pages which set out to offend others.<ref>[http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Deletionpedia:Archive&oldid=1241010 Deletionpedia:Archive], from the Deletionpedia website</ref>. However, it also claims that it intends to make the entire process automated. 

Some of the articles preserved by Deletionpedia were deleted from Wikipedia for being uninteresting, while others were the result of manipulation by political and business interests.<ref> {{citation|url=http://www.20min.ch/digital/webpage/story/Friedhof-der-Wikipedia-Artikel-23217219|publisher=20 minuten|title=Friedhof der Wikipedia-Artikel|author=Henning Steier|date=19 Sep 2008}}</ref>  Unlike [[Wikipedia]], the site seeks no donations, suggesting instead that supporters donate to [[mySociety]] or to the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].<ref>[http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Deletionpedia:Site_support Deletionpedia:Donate], from the Deletionpedia website</ref>

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' cited it as a response to the culture clash that exists on Wikipedia between [[Deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia|deletionists and inclusionists]].<ref> [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121815517776622597.html Wikipedians Leave Cyberspace, Meet in Egypt], by James Gleick.

==Related proposals==
Deletionpedia is a [[third party]] example of what ''CIO'' magazine called a "Wikimorgue"; in September 2007 they called such a site a "small but powerful check on Wikipedia's editors, who might think twice about deleting articles if they knew that by routine practice and internal policy, Wikipedia preserved all deleted pages, including their histories and discussions."<ref>[http://www.cio.com/article/print/141650 Wikipedia's Awkward Adolescence], from ''CIO'' magazine</ref>  

In April 2008, [[Nicholson Baker]] proposed the creation of the similarly-named "Deletopedia" because:<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/apr/10/wikipedia.internet How I fell in love with Wikipedia], an April 2008 article in ''The Guardian'', written by [[Nicholson Baker]]</ref>
:"a lot of good work - verifiable, informative, brain-leapingly strange - is being cast out of [[Wikipedia|this paperless, infinitely expandable accordion folder]] by people who have a narrow notion of what sort of curiosity an online encyclopedia should be able to satisfy."
