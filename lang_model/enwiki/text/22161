'''Blizzard''' ('''Donnie Gill''') is a [[fictional character]], both a [[supervillain]] and [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]]. He is the second [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]].

==Fictional character biography==
Donald "Donnie" Gill was born in Newark, Delaware. He became a criminal mercenary and was hired by [[Justin Hammer]], who gave him a cryogenic suit reminiscent of the original [[Blizzard (comics)#Gregor Shapanka|Blizzard]]. As the original was vaporized by Iron Man 2020, Donnie decided to use the name Blizzard, as well. His first mission had him working with two other super-villains <U+2014> the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] and [[Blacklash (comics)|Blacklash]] <U+2014> in order to capture [[Force (comics)|Force]], who had betrayed Hammer.  However, Blizzard was clumsy, and annoyed his teammates with his amateur mistakes, such as creating an ice wall which blocked their path to their objective.  After accidentally encasing Blacklash in ice, the trio fled as more reinforcements arrived to protect Force.<ref>''Iron Man'' #223-224</ref>

Later, the trio retried to capture Force, but he was under the protection of [[Iron Man]]. Blizzard battled much more competently this round, but when Force entered the fight, he rendered the villains' powers useless.  Deciding to flee and rest until their powers restored, Blizzard, Beetle, and Blacklash split up. Force found Blizzard, who had regained his powers. However, his powers were ineffective against Force, so he decided to battle him with his bare hands. Force repelled Blizzard, blasting him through a wall.  Blizzard, unwilling to give up, attempted to blast Force once more, despite Force's warnings, and was electrocuted. The Beetle and Blacklash abandoned Blizzard, deciding to blame him for their failures, while he was taken into custody.

However, before he could be imprisoned, he was rescued by [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] on Hammer's behalf. Blizzard's loyalty to Hammer grew greatly, although Iron Man had attempted to help him legally and morally. Hammer decided to bargain with Iron Man over Blizzard, forcing Iron Man to help him take down the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #239-240</ref> Iron Man agreed, but Blizzard refused to believe Hammer would betray him. After hearing a recording, Blizzard was crushed and surrendered to Iron Man.

After several missions on his own which put him in opposition of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]{{Issue|date=August 2009}} and the [[New Warriors]],{{Issue|date=August 2009}} attending the [[AIM (comics)|AIM Weapons Expo]] with several other super-villains,{{Issue|date=August 2009}} and joining the largest incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]],{{Issue|date=August 2009}} Blizzard decided to try again with a smaller team, working a mission alongside villains such as [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], and the daughters of [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]] and [[Batroc the Leaper]]. Their mission failed miserably after interference from [[Agent X]] and his allies.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Blizzard has also been a constant annoyance to [[She-Hulk]], though in their most recent confrontation, Blizzard attacked She-Hulk in a bar and instead of defeating him, she invited him to join her for a drink. He ended up getting extremely drunk, contemplating his self-existence and lack of recognition. Before collapsing in a drunken stupor, Blizzard noted that he liked She-Hulk, forming a friendship with her. After reverting to her Jennifer Walters persona, she collapsed on top of him, vomiting everywhere.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

[[Image:BlizzardDonnieGill3.jpg|thumb|left|215px|Blizzard and Speed Demon.]]
With the Avengers disbanded, the Beetle, now known as [[Abner Jenkins|Mach-IV]], decided to form a new group of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. As with the original group of Thunderbolts, this incarnation was based on former villains seeking redemption and forgiveness for their crimes while working as super-heroes. Donnie Gill was one of the first members invited to join by Mach-IV, and he agreed to join.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #1</ref> However, he lacked any confidence despite his intense drive to help people. As a Thunderbolt, Blizzard went up against several enemies, including [[Fathom Five (comics)|Fathom Five]],<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #1</ref> the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #2</ref> and the [[Purple Man]].<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #12</ref>

Blizzard and fellow Thunderbolt [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]] began to bond, forming a close friendship. When Speed Demon attempted to commit illegal acts alongside the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], Blizzard stopped him by convincing him to use his former Whizzer outfit and placing a tracking device on him. Speed Demon, angry at Blizzard, defeated him and tied him upside down on a bridge, naked.<ref>New Thunderbolts #8 </ref> While constantly doubting his status as a super-hero and often feeling as though he should give up, Blizzard gained strength through the others, most notably [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], who often insulted him and even dismissed him from the group after she became leader.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

===Civil War/Initiative===
[[Baron Zemo]], forming a group to battle Songbird's Thunderbolts, recruited Blizzard, who spent his days drinking in bars after being fired by Songbird. His new teammate, the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]], upgraded Blizzard's costume, enhancing his abilities.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} He participated in the ensuing battle against the Thunderbolts, but soon the groups were assimilated, and Blizzard aided the group against the [[U-Foes]] during [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #103</ref> In the battle against [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]], Blizzard proved himself to his teammates by shielding them from the onslaught of his attacks, along with Songbird.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

In the final battle against the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], Blizzard's suit was destroyed after the Wellspring energy was released.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #108</ref> He was pardoned for his past crimes.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #109</ref>

On the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1, it shows Blizzard amongst the 142 registered superheroes.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map]</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Blizzard has no superhuman powers. However, he wears a battle-suit that contains microcircuited cryogenic units which allow its wearer to generate and focus intense cold on a level beyond that of his predecessor, the original [[Blizzard (comics)#Gregor Shapanka|Blizzard]]. By manipulating this cold, Gill can create blasts of cold, ice missiles and walls of ice from ambient moisture, as well as forming sleet, snow, and freezing rain. He can emit freezing rays capable of lowering the temperature within the ray's range by 50<U+00B0>F (28<U+00B0>C) in about 15 seconds. At the risk of depleting his water supply, he can encase people in snow or ice, create an ice barricade, or form an ice slide beneath his feet.

The current costume used by Blizzard has been improved upon by the members of the Thunderbolts formerly known as the Beetle and the [[Fixer (comics)#Fixer/Techno|Fixer]]. It can essentially emulate most of the powers originally wielded by the mutant known as [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], including the spontaneous generation of Ice Bridges for extremely swift and maneuverable transportation (it does not give the wearer thermal vision). The limits of this costume are not yet known.

Donnie Gill is otherwise an athletic man, with extensive experience in street-fighting techniques.

==Other versions==
===[[House of M]]: [[Masters of Evil]]===
Blizzard appears as a member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s Masters of Evil.<ref>''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #1</ref>

===Power Pack===
Blizzard appears in ''[[Power Pack|Iron Man & Power Pack Issue #2]]'', teamed up with [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]]. He kidnaps Irena Crumb, the daughter of millionaire Arnold Crumb at her school and takes her to an abandoned warehouse across town, where he tells her why she's there and tortures her. 

Speed Demon runs in, telling him that Power Pack has found them and yells at him for having ''him'' make the ransom call. Then, Power Pack bursts in, who start to battle him and Speed Demon. Blizzard sneaks up on [[Jack Power|Mass Master]] who is trying to save Irena and freezes him. He goes into cloud form and starts to Blizzard attempts to freeze him again.

Doing this, he freezes the ground, causing Speed Demon to slip and smash into him, almost knocking him out. The Pack ties him up, and [[Julie Power|Lightspeed]] takes his mask so she can rescue Irena from Speed Demon. Later, Blizzard is taken in by the Police with Speed Demon. <ref>''Power Pack'' #2</ref>
