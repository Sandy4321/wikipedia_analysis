'''Matrikas''' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{IAST|m<U+0101>t<U+1E5D>k<U+0101>s}}, {{lang|sa|<U+092E><U+093E><U+0924><U+0943><U+0915><U+093E>}}, lit.

However, they may sometimes be eight ('''Ashtamatrikas''': {{IAST|ashtam<U+0101>t<U+1E5D>k<U+0101>s}}, {{lang|sa|<U+0905><U+0937><U+094D><U+091F><U+092E><U+093E><U+0924><U+0943><U+0915><U+093E>}}, "eight mothers"). While in South India, Saptamatrika worship is prevalent; the Ashtamatrika are venerated in [[Nepal]].<ref>van den Hoek in Nas, p.362</ref>

The Matrikas assume paramount significance in the goddess-oriented sect of [[Hinduism]],  [[Tantra|Tantrism]].<ref name = "W41"> Wangu p.41</ref> In [[Shaktism]], they are "described as assisting the great Shakta [[Devi]] (goddess) in her fight with demons."<ref>Bhattacharyya, N.

(New Delhi, 1974, 2d ed. 1996), p. 126.</ref> Some scholars consider them as [[Shaiva]] goddesses.<ref name = "A"> Wangu p.75</ref> They are also connected with the cult of warrior god [[Murugan|Skanda]].<ref>The Iconography and Ritual of <U+015A>iva at Elephanta By Charles Dillard Collins p.143</ref>

In most early references, the Matrikas are described having inauspicious qualities and often described as dangerous. They come to play a protective role in later mythology, although some of their inauspicious, wild characteristics still persist in these accounts.<ref>Kinsley (1988) p.151</ref> Thus, "they represent the prodigiously fecund aspect of nature as well as its destructive force aspect".<ref name = "Jain162">Jain p.162</ref> 

The 6th century encyclopedia [[Brihat-Samhita]], [[Varahamihira]] says that <U+201C>Mothers are to be made with cognizance of [different major Hindu] gods corresponding to their names.<U+201D><ref>Brhatsamhita, Ch.57, v.56. {{cite web |url= http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/Sept2004/englishPdf/sakti.pdf| title= Sakti Cult in Upper Mahanadi Valley|accessdate=2008-01-08 |last= Panda| first= S.S.|coauthors= |month= September | year= 2004|work= Orissa Review|publisher= Government of Orissa|format=PDF}}</ref> They are associated with these gods as their spouses or their energies (''[[Shakti]]s'').<ref name = "Jain162"/> Originally believed to personification of the seven stars of the constellation [[Pleiades]], they became quite popular by the seventh century and a standard feature of goddess temples from the ninth century onwards.<ref>Wangu Glossary p.187</ref>

==Origins and development==
According to Jagdish Narain Tiwari and Dilip Chakravati, the Matrikas were existent as early as the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic period]] and the [[Indus Valley]] civilization. Coins with rows of seven feminine deities or priestesses are cited as evidence for the theory.<ref>Jagdish Narain Tiwari, "Studies in Goddess Cults in Northern India, with Reference to the First Seven Centuries AD" p.215-244; as referred in Kinsley p.151</ref><ref>Dilip Chakravati in ''Archaeology and World Religion'' By Timothy Insoll, Published 2001, Routledge, 
ISBN 0415221544, pp.42-44 </ref> A Hindu text known as the [[Rigveda]] (IX 102.4) speaks of a group of seven Mothers who control the preparation of [[Soma]], but the earliest clear description appears in some layers of during the epic [[Mahabharata]](dated to 1st century AD).<ref name="Kinsley p.151">Kinsley p.151</ref><ref>Pal in Singh p.1836</ref> Wangu believes that Matrika description in Mahabharata, is rooted in the group of seven females depicted on [[Indus valley]] seals.<ref name = "W41"/> It was assumed that the people locally worshipped these goddesses, such an example is also described in Zimmer Heinrich book ''The Art Of Indian Asia'', about the seven shrines of seven Mother Goddesses worshipped locally. By the fifth century, all these goddesses were incorporated in mainstream orthodox Hinduism as Tantric deities.<ref>Zimmer Heinrich, 1960,2001 The Art Of Indian Asia, Its Mythology and Transformations.Motilal Banarsidas Publication. New Delhi (Page B4C,257,135)</ref><ref>Harper in Harper and Brown, p.48</ref> David Kinsley proposes that the Matrikas may be non-[[Aryan]] or at least non-[[Brahmanical]] (orthodox Hinduism), local village goddesses, who were being assimilated in the mainstream. He cites two reasons for his assertion: their description in Mahabharata as dark in colour, speaking foreign languages and living in "peripheral areas" and their association with non-Brahmanical god Skanda and his father, Shiva, who though Vedic has non-Brahmanical attributes.<ref>Kinsley p.155</ref> Sara L. Schastok suggests that Matrikas maybe inspired by the concept of [[Yaksha]]s, who are associated with [[Murugan|Skanda]] and [[Kubera]] - both are often portrayed with the Matrikas.<ref>Schastok pp.58-60</ref>

In contrast to Indus valley origins theory, Bhattacharyya notes:
<blockquote>[The] cult of the Female Principle was a major aspect of Dravidian religion, The concept of Shakti was an integral part of their religion [...] The cult of the ''Sapta Matrika'', or Seven Divine Mothers, which is an integral part of the [[Shakta]] religion, may be of [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] inspiration.<ref>Bhattacharyya, N. N., ''History of the Sakta Religion'', Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd. (New Delhi, 1974, 2d ed. 1996).</ref></blockquote>

The Sapta-Matrikas were earlier connected with Skanda (Kumara) and in later times, associated with the sect of Shiva himself.<ref>The Iconography and Ritual of <U+015A>iva at Elephanta By Charles Dillard Collins p.143</ref>

During the [[Kushana]] period (1st to 3rd century), the sculptural images of the matrikas first appear in stone. The Kushana images merged from the belief in ''Balagraha'' (lit "destroyers of children") worship related to conception, birth, diseases and protection of children. The Balagraha tradition included the worship of the infant Skanda with the Matrikas. The goddesses were considered as personifications of perils, related to children and thus, were pacified by worship. The Kushana images emphasize the maternal as well as destructive characteristics of the Matrikas through their emblems and weapons. They appear to be an undifferentiated sculptural group but develop in standard and complex iconographic representation during the following Gupta period.<ref>Wangu pp.58-59</ref>

In the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period (3rd to 6th century A.D.), folk images of Matrikas became important in  villages.<ref>Wangu p.67 </ref> The diverse folk goddesses of the soldiers like Matrikas were acknowledged by the Gupta rulers and their images were carved on royal monuments in order to strengthen the loyalty and adherence of the armed forces.<ref>Wangu p. 68</ref> The Gupta kings [[Skandagupta]] and [[Kumaragupta I]] (c. second half of fifth century) made Skanda (Kumara){{Ref_label|B|b|none}} their model and elevated the position of Skanda's foster mothers, the Matrikas from a cluster of folk goddesses to court goddesses.<ref> Wangu p.76</ref> Since the fourth century; [[Parhari]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] had a rock-cut shrine been solely devoted to the Sapta Matrika.<ref name="Berkson p.212">Berkson p.212</ref>

The [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] (350-1000 CE) kings of [[Karnataka]] built many Hindu temples along with ''saptamatrika'' carvings<ref> {{cite book |last= Kamath|first= Suryanath U.|title=  A concise history of Karnataka : from pre-historic times to the present|origyear=1980|year= 2001|publisher= Jupiter books|location= Bangalore|oclc= 7796041|id= {{LCCN|809|0|5179}}}} p51 </ref> and memorials, containing sculptural details of ''saptamatrikas''.<ref> Kamath (2001), p52</ref> The evidence of Matrika sculptures is further pronounced in the [[Pratihara|Gurjara<U+2013>Patiharas]] (8th to 10th century A.D.) and [[Chandella]] period (8th to 12th century A.D.).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://anistor.co.hol.gr/english/enback/Saptmatrika.pdf|title= Sapta Matrikas In Indian Art and their significance in Indian Sculpture and Ethos: A Critical Study|accessdate=2008-01-08 |last= Goswami|first= Meghali|coauthors= Gupta, Dr.Ila; Jha, Dr. P. of IIT, Roorkee|month= March | year= 2005|work= Anistoriton Journal|publisher= Anistoriton|format=PDF}} "Anistoriton is an electronic Journal of History, Archaeology and ArtHistory.

In most of the relevant texts, their exact number has not been specified, but gradually their number and names became increasingly crystallized and seven goddesses were identified as matrikas, albeit some references indicate eight or even sixteen Matrikas.<ref>Kinsley p.156</ref> 

Laura Kristine Chamberlain cites:
<blockquote>The inconsistency in the number of Matrikas found in the valley [Indus] today (seven, eight, or nine) possibly reflects the localization of goddesses [.]  Although the Matrikas are mostly grouped as seven goddesses over the rest of the Indian Subcontinent, an eighth Matrikas has sometimes been added in Nepal to represent the eight cardinal directions.  In [[Bhaktapur]], a city in the Kathmandu Valley, a ninth Matrika is added to the set to represent the center.<ref>Cited in Laura Kristine Chamberlain.  <U+201C>Durga and the Dashain Harvest Festival: From the Indus to Kathmandu Valleys<U+201D> in ReVision, Summer 2002, vol. 25, no. 1, p.26</ref>

==Legends==
[[Image:Matrika Inde Mus<U+00E9>e Guimet 11073.jpg|thumb|9th-10th century granite [[Chola]] statue of Matrika Maheshvari - seen with a trident in a hand, adorned by serpent ornaments and her vahana (mount)- the bull Nandi is seen on her seat - [[Mus<U+00E9>e Guimet]], Paris.]]
There are several Puranic texts related to the origin of Matrikas. [[Matsya Purana]], [[Vamana Purana]], [[Varaha Purana]], [[Kurma Purana]] and the [[Suprabhedagama]] contain references to Matrikas, and this asserts their antiquity.<ref> The stories are quoted in (Rao, T.A. Gopinatha, Elements of Hindu Iconography, Vol.I, Part-II, 2nd Edition, Indological Book House, Varanasi, 1971, pp.379-383).</ref>

According to the [[Sumbha and Nisumbha|Shumbha-Nishumbha]] myth of [[Devi Mahatmya]], Matrikas appear as [[Shakti]]s from the bodies of the gods - Brahma, Shiva, Skanda, Vishnu, Indra;<ref>Kinsley p. 156, Devi Mahatmya verses 8.11-20</ref> having form of each, approached [[Chandi|Chandika]] (identified with Ambika and Devi) with whatever form, ornaments and vehicle the god possessed. In that form, they slaughter the demon army.<ref name = "A"/><ref>Kinsley p. 156, Devi Mahatmya verses 8.38, 44, 49, 62</ref> Thus, the Matrikas are goddesses of the battlefield. They are described as assistants of Durga having sinister as well as propitious characteristics.<ref name = "W72"/> After the battle, the Matrikas dance drunk with their victim's blood.<ref>Kinsley p. 156, Devi Mahatmya verses 8.62</ref> This description is repeated with little variation in Devi Bhagavata Purana.<ref>Kinsley p. 156, verses 5.28-29 and It names 10 goddesses and then says that some shaktis of other gods also came to battle.</ref> and Vamana Purana.<ref>Kinsley p. 156, verses 30</ref> The [[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]] mentions three other goddesses, Shaktis of other gods in addition to Saptamatrikas making a group of 10 Matrikas.<ref>Kinsley p.242</ref>

According to latter episode of Devi Mahatmya, Durga created Matrikas from herself and with their help slaughtered the demon army. In this version, [[Kali]] is described as a Matrika, who sucked all the blood of demon [[Raktabija]]. Kali is given the epithet [[Chamunda]] in the text. When demon Shumbha challenges Durga to a single combat, she absorbs the Matrikas in herself and says that they are her different forms.<ref>Kinsley p. 158, Devi Mahatmya verses 10.2-5</ref> In the Vamana Purana too, the Matrikas arise from different parts of Devi and not from male gods although they are described and named after the male deities.<ref>Kinsley p. 158,verses 30.3-9</ref>

In Matsya Purana, seven Matrikas are created by Shiva to combat the demon Andhaka, who has the ability to duplicate from each drop of his blood that falls from him when he is wounded.{{Ref_label|C|c|none}} The Matrikas drink up his blood and help Shiva defeat the demon. After the battle, the Matrikas begin a rampage of destruction by starting to devour other gods, demons and peoples of the world. [[Narasimha]], Vishnu's man-lion incarnation, creates a host of thirty-two benign goddesses who calm down the terrible, fire-breathing Matrikas. Narasimha commanded the Matrikas to protect the world, instead of destroying it and thus be worshipped by mankind. At the end of the episode, Shiva's terrible form [[Bhairava]] is enshrined with the images of the Matrikas at the place where the battle took place.<ref>Kinsley p. 158-159, verses 179.8-90</ref><ref>Pal in Singh p.1835-6</ref> This story is retold in Vishnudharmottara Purana.<ref>Kinsley p. 159, verses 1.225</ref> Vishnudharmottara Purana further relates them with vices or inauspicious emotions like envy, pride, anger etc.<ref>Kinsley p. 159, verses 17.33-37</ref> 

In Varaha Purana, they are created from the distracted mind of goddess Vaishnavi, who loses her concentration while doing asceticism. They are described as lovely and act as the goddesses' attendants on the battlefield.<ref>Kinsley p. 159, Verses 44.1-96</ref> In [[Bhagavata Purana]], when beings created by Vishnu are enlisted; the Matrikas are listed with rakshasas (demons), bhutas (ghosts), pretas, [[dakini]]s and other dangerous beings. In the same text, milkmaids offer a prayer for protection of the infant-god [[Krishna]] from the Matrikas.<ref>Kinsley p. 159, verses 2.10.37-39 and 10.63.6 ff., 10.6,27-29</ref>

The [[Devi Purana]](6th - 10th century) mentions a group of sixteen matrikas and six other types of Matrikas mentioned, apart from the Saptamatrikas.<ref>Pal in Singh p.1839</ref> It introduces the ''Loka-matara'' (mothers of the world), a term used in the Mahabharata, in the very first chapter. Kind to all creatures, the Matrikas are said to reside in various places for the benefit of children.<ref>Pal in Singh p.1835</ref> The text paradoxically describes the Matrikas as being created by various gods like Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra as well as being their mothers.<ref>Pal in Singh p.1844</ref> Devi Purana describe a pentad of Matrikas, who help [[Ganesha]] to kill demons.<ref>Pal in Singh p.1840, Chapters 111-116</ref> Further, sage Mandavya is described as worshipping the ''{{IAST|M<U+0101><U+1E6D>rpa<U+0148>caka}}'' (the five mothers) named Ambika (Kaumari), Rudrani, Chamunda, Brahmi and Vaishnavi and who have been established by [[Brahma]]; for saving king [[Harishchandra]] from calamities. The Matrikas direct the sage to perform worship of ''{{IAST|M<U+0101><U+1E6D>rchakra}}''(interpreted as a [[Yantra]] or [[Mandala]] or a circular shrine to the Matrikas), established by [[Vishnu]] on the [[Vindhya]] mountains, by meat and ritual sacrifice.<ref>Pal in Singh p.1840, Chapter 116(82-86)</ref>

===Mahabharata===
The Mahabharata narrates in different chapters the birth of warrior-god [[Skanda]] (the son of Shiva and [[Parvati]]) and his association with the Matrikas - his adopted mothers.

[[Image:Camunda5.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Hoysala]] sculpture of Chamunda, [[Halebidu]]. Surrounded by skeletons, the goddess has large nails and protruding teeth and wears a garland of skulls.]]
In one version, [[Indra]] (king of demi-gods) sends the goddesses called "mothers of the world" to kill him.<ref name="Kinsley p.151"/> However, upon seeing Skanda, instead they follow their maternal instincts and raise him.<ref name = "W41"/> In the chapter ''Vana-parva'' version, the Saptamatrikas are mentioned.<ref name="Kinsley p.151"/><ref>Mahabharata verses 215.16 - 215.18, two of the goddesses are described in 215.21-22</ref> Later in the Mahabharata; when absorption of these indigenous goddesses in the Brahmanic pantheon was initiated, a standardized group of seven goddesses - the Saptamatrikas, Shaktis or powers of Brahmanic gods are mentioned as Brahmi, Maheshvari, Kumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda.<ref name = "W41"/>

In other accounts of Skanda's birth in Mahabharata, eight ferocious goddesses emerge from Skanda, when struck by Indra's [[Vajra]] (thunderbolt). These are K<U+0101>ki, Halim<U+0101>, M<U+0101>lin<U+012B>, {{IAST|B<U+1E5B>hal<U+012B>}}, <U+0100>ry<U+0101>, Pal<U+0101>l<U+0101> and Vaimitr<U+0101>, which Skanda accepted as his mothers, who stole other children - a characteristic of the Matrikas.<ref name="Kinsley p.152">Kinsley p.152</ref>

Another account mentions the ''Maha-matrikas'' (the great mothers), a group of the wives of six of the [[Saptarishi]]s (7 great sages), who were accused of being Skanda's real mothers and thus abandoned by their husbands. They request Skanda to adopt them as his mothers. Skanda agrees and grants them two boons: to be worshipped as great goddesses and permission to torment children til they are younger than 16 years and then act as their protectors.<ref name="Kinsley p.152"/> These six goddesses as well as the Saptamatrikas are identified or associated with [[Vedic]] [[Krittika]]s, the constellation [[Pleiades]].<ref>Harper in Harper and Brown, p.116</ref>

The Shalya Parva of the Mahabharata mentions characteristics of a host of Matrikas, who serve Skanda. Ninety-two of them are named but the text says there exist more. The Shalya Parva describes them as young, cheerful, most of them fair but having dangerous features like long nails and large teeth. They are said to fight like Indra in battles, invoking terror in minds of enemies; speak different foreign tongues and lives in inaccessible places away from human settlements like crossroads, caves, mountains, springs, forests, riverbanks and cremation grounds.<ref>Kinsley p.153</ref><ref>Pattanaik pp.132-3</ref><ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m09/m09046.htm Vaishampayana said<U+2026>] [[Mahabharata|The Mahabharata]] translated by [[Kisari Mohan Ganguli]] (1883 -1896], Book 9: Shalya Parva: Section 46. </ref> Notable among these lists of Matrikas is ''[[Putana]]'', a demoness who tried to kill the infant [[Krishna]] (an incarnation of Vishnu) by suckling him with poisoned breast milk and consequently killed by Krishna.<ref>Kinsley p.154</ref>

==Depictions==
[[Image:British Museum Ganesha Matrikas Kubera.jpg|thumb|300px|Bronze group with (from left) Ganesha; Brahmi, Kumari, Vaishnavi - the 3 Matrikas and [[Kubera]] taken at the British Museum; Originally from Eastern India, Dedicated in 43rd year of reign of [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king [[Mahipala]] I (about AD 1043)]]
The textual description of Matrikas is generally awesome, frightening and ferocious. In the [[Mahabharata]], all the seven mothers are described as fatal or serve as threats to foetuses or infants. They are described as living in trees, crossroads, caves and funeral grounds and they are terrible as well as beautiful.<ref name = "W41"/> But, in the sculptural portrayal, they are depicted quite differently as protectors and benevolent mothers. They are armed with the same weapons, wear the same ornaments, and ride the same vahanas and carry the same banners as their corresponding male deities.

The Saptamatrkas are generally carved in relief on a rectangular stone slab in the sequential order of Brahmani, Maheshvari, Kumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda, being flanked 
by two male figures - a terrible form of [[Shiva]] ([[Virabhadra]]) and his son [[Ganesha]] in both sides (first - on their right and last - on their left). Thus, the Matrikas are considered [[Shaiva|Saivite goddesses]].<ref name = "A"/> They are often depicted on the lintel slabs of the main door of a Shiva temple - mainly in [[Jaunsar]]-[[Bawar]] region, with their respective mounts forming the pedestal.<ref name = "Jain162"/> Sometimes, they are occupied by the couple Uma-Maheshvara ([[Parvati]] and Shiva). The earliest instance of their portrayal with Uma-Maheshvara is at Desha Bhattarika, Nepal although now the Matrika images have withered away.<ref>Singh p.1855</ref> The 12th century Sanskrit author [[Kalhana]] mentions worship of Matrikas with Shiva in [[Kashmir]], his work [[Rajatarangini]].<ref name="Pal in Singh p.1858">Pal in Singh p.1858</ref>

Three panels of Saptamatrikas appear near the Shiva cave at Udayagiri, [[Bhopal]].<ref name="Harper in Harper and Brown, p.117">Harper in Harper and Brown, p.117</ref> They are also depicted in the [[Shaiva]] caves of [[Elephanta]] and [[Ellora]] (Caves 21, 14, 16 and 22).<ref>Berkson p.87</ref> In sixth century Rameshvara cave (Cave 21) at Ellora, "With the terrific aspect repressed entirely, the matrikas are depicted as benign and are worshipped in adulation. Sensuous, elegant, tender, beautiful adolescents, they are yet haughty and grand, quintessentially the creatrix."<ref>Berkson p.134</ref> Karrtikkeyi (Kumari) is depicted with a child on her lap and even Varahi is depicted with a human head, rather than the usual boar one.<ref>For images see Berkson pp.136 - 144 </ref> In Ravana-ka-kai cave (Cave 14), each of the matrikas is with a child.<ref name="Berkson p.186">Berkson p.186</ref> In eighth century [[Kailash Temple]] (cave 16) - dedicated to [[Shiva]] - of [[Rashtrakuta]] period, the Matrikas appear on the southern boundary of the temple.<ref name="Berkson p.212"/> As the influence of [[Tantra]] rose, the fertility area and upper parts of body in the Matrika sculptures were stressed.<ref>Berkson pp.186-7</ref> 

In each of the four depictions at Ellora, the matrikas are accompanied by Virabhadra, Ganesha  and also on their left (besides Ganesha) by [[K<U+0101>la (time)|Kala]] (Time personified or Death).<ref>Berkson p.135</ref> The presence of Kala in form of a skeleton, seems to indicate the darker aspect of the matrikas' nature.<ref name="Berkson p.186"/> At [[Osian]], the Matrikas is flanked by Ganesha and [[Kubera]] (the treasurer of the gods and a devotee of Shiva) while Virabhadra sits in the middle of the group.<ref>Kalia p.109</ref> In Gupta and post-Gupta art, like in 6th Century caves of [[Shamalaji]], the Matrikas are accompanied by Shiva's son [[Murugan|Skanda]].

==Associations==
===Yoginis===
[[Image:Kumari (Matrika) 01.jpg|thumb|right|Kumari, folio from Devi Mahatmya.]]
Often the Matrikas are confused with the [[Yogini]]s, a group of sixty-four or eighty-one Tantric goddesses.<ref>Dehejia, Vidya, ''Yogini Cult and Temples''</ref> In Sanskrit literature the Yoginis have been represented as the attendants or various manifestations of goddess [[Durga]] engaged in fighting with the demons Shumbha and Nishumbha, and the principal Yoginis are identified with the Matrikas.<ref name = "Bhattacharyya"> Bhattacharyya, N. N., ''History of the Sakta Religion'', Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd. (New Delhi, 1974, 2d ed. 1996), p. 128.</ref> Other Yoginis are described as born from one or more Matrikas. The derivation of sixty-four Yoginis from eight Matrikas became a common tradition, by mid- 11th century. The [[Mandala]] (circle) and [[chakra]] of Yoginis were used alternatively. The eighty-one Yoginis evolve from a group of nine Matrikas, instead of seven or eight. The Saptamatrika (Brahmi, Maheshvari, Kumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda) joined by [[Chandika]] and Mahalakshmi form the nine Matrika cluster. Each Matrika is considered to be a Yogini and is associated with eight other Yoginis resulting in the troupe of eighty-one (nine times nine).<ref>Wangu p.114</ref> Thus, Yoginis are considered as manifestations or daughters of the Matrikas.<ref>Banerji p.296</ref> The yoginis also occupy an important place in [[Tantra]], one of their chief temples in India is the 'Chaushatti Jogini' (the 64 yoginis) temple near [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Orissa]].

The rise of Yogini cult is also analogous to the rise of the Matrikas' cult. Bhattacharyya sums it this way:
<blockquote>The growing importance of Shaktism [of the matrikas and yoginis in the first millennium CE] brought them into greater prominence and distributed their cult far and wide. [...] The primitive Yogini cult was also revived on account of the increasing influenced of the cult of the Seven Mothers.<ref name = "Bhattacharyya"/> </blockquote>

===Devanagari Alphabet===
According to K.C. Aryan, the number of Matrikas is determined in the structure of the [[Devanagari]] alphabet. First is the (A) group which contains the [[vowel]]s, then the (Ka), (Cha), (Ta), (ta), (Pa), (Ya) and (Ksha) groups. The seven mother goddesses (''Saptamatrikas'') correspond to the seven [[consonant]] groups; when the vocalic (A) group is added, the eight mother goddesses (''Ashtamatrikas'') are obtained.<ref>Aryan (1980), p. 9</ref>

The [[Shakta]]s hold that the Mothers preside over impurities (''mala'') and over sounds of the language. The Mothers were identified with fourteen vowels plus the ''anusarva'' and ''visarga'' - making their number sixteen.<ref>Jain p.163</ref>

In [[Tantra]], the fifty or fifty-one letters including vowels as well as consonants from A to Ksha, of the [[Devanagari]] alphabet itself, the [[Varnamala]] of [[bija]], have been described as being the Matrikas themselves. It is believed that they are infused with the power of the [[Divine Mother]] herself. The Matrikas are considered to be the subtle form of the letters ''(varna)''. These letters combined make up syllables ''(pada)'' which are combined to make sentences ''(vakya)'' and it is of these elements that [[mantra]] is composed. It is believed that the power of mantra derives from the fact that the letters of the alphabet are in fact forms of the goddess.<ref>Aryan (1980), pp. 24-28</ref>

:The 50 Matrika Kalas are given in the same account as follows: Nivritti, Pratishtha, Vidya, [[Shanti]], Indhika, Dipika, Mochika, Para, Sukshma, Sukshmamrita, Jnanamrita, Apypayani, Vyapini, Vyomarupa, Ananta, Srishti, Riddhi, Smriti, Medha, Kanti, [[Lakshmi]], Dyuti, Sthira, Sthiti, [[Siddhi]], Jada, Palini, Shanti, Aishvarya, [[Rati]], Kamika, Varada, Ahladini, Pritih, Dirgha, Tikshna, Raudri, Bhaya, Nidra, Tadra, Kshudha, Krodhini, Kriya, Utkari, Mrityurupa, Pita, Shveta, Asita, Ananta.<ref>Woodroffe, p. 103</ref>

Sometimes, the Matrikas represent a diagram written in the letter, believed to possess magical powers.<ref>Banerji p.61</ref>

==Worship==
===In India===
[[Image:7mothers56.JPG|thumb|right|Shrine of the "Seven Mothers" in [[Ramanathapuram District]], Tamil Nadu.]]
According to Leslie C. Orr, the Saptamatrika, who first appeared in South India in the eighth century, had once temples dedicated exclusively to them, but the ninth century onwards, they were demoted to status of "deities of the entourage" (''parivara devata'') of Shiva. Their images moved from the sanctums to corners of temple complexes and now they are as guardian deities in small village shrines.<ref>Leslie C. Orr, ''Gods and Worshippers on South Indian sacred ground'' in ''The World in the Year 1000'' By James Heitzman and Wolfgang Schenkluhn, pp.244-5, Published 2004, University Press of America, 338 pages, ISBN 0761825614.</ref> The Saptamatrikas are worshipped as ''Saptakanyakas'' (the celestial nymphs) in most South Indian Shiva temples. But the Selliyamman temple at [[Alambakkam]] in [[Tiruchirapalli district]] (In 1909 called Trichonopoly district) is important in worship of the Matrikas. Here once stood a temple dedicated to the Saptamatrika, which was replaced by the present temple.<ref>''The Madras Epigraphical Department'', Annual Report 1909-10 p. 285 as quoted in pp.285-6 ''South Indian shrines illustrated'' By P. V. Jagadisa Ayyar. Published 1993, Asian Educational Services,ISBN 8120601513</ref>

In India, shrines of the Saptamatrikas are located in "the wilderness", usually near lakes or rivers, and are made of seven vermilion smeared stones. It is believed that the Matrikas kill fetuses and newborns unless pacified with bridal finery and prayers by women.<ref>Pattanaik p.131</ref> Devdutt Pattanaik says: "The cult of the Seven Mothers is found all over India. ... Pregnant women and nursing mothers worship them. When these goddesses are angry, they make women barren and strike newborns with fatal fevers. When they are appeased, they ensure the health and happiness of children."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://shaktisadhana.50megs.com/Newhomepage/Frames/messageboard/Saptamarikas.html|title= SaptaMatrikas and Matrikas|accessdate=2008-01-08 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= 27 March 2006|work= |publisher= Shakti Sadhana Group}}</ref> Though the [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] says: "Any Saptamatrka cult that may have existed seems to have disappeared by the eleventh century, perhaps absorbed by growing worship of powerful and energetic feminine gods as pre-eminent deities".<ref>Students' Britannica India By Dale Hoiberg, Indu Ramchandani p.344, Published 2000, Popular Prakashan,ISBN 0852297602</ref>

The Saptamatrika images are worshipped by women on ''Pithori'' - new moon day, with the 64 yoginis represented by rice flour images or supari nuts. The goddesses are worshipped by ceremonial offerings of fruit and flower and [[mantras]].<ref>The Hindu Religious Year By Muriel Marion Underhill; Published 1991; Asian Educational Services, 194 pages, ISBN 8120605233, p.110</ref>

===In Nepal===
The Matrikas function both as city protectors and individual protectors in both Hinduism and [[Buddhism]]. The Astha matrika are considered as [[Ajima]]s (grandmother goddesses, who are feared as bringer of disease and misfortune as well act as protectresses) in the [[Newar]] pantheon. Temples (''pithas'' i.e. seats) of the ashta matrika built in and around [[Kathmandu]] are considered powerful places of worship.<ref>The Rough Guide to Nepal By David Reed, James McConnachie p.521 Published 2002 Rough Guides ISBN 1858288991</ref> 

The ''pithas'' are usually open-air shrines, but may be closed structures too. In these ''pithas'', the Matrikas are worshipped with their followers (''[[gana]]s'') in form of stone statues or natural stones, while in ''[[dyochem]]s'' (god-houses) in towns and villages, they are represented in brass images. The brass images (''utsav-murtis'') are paraded around town and placed at their respective ''pithas'' once every year. Like Vishnudharmottara Purana (discussed in [[#Legends|Legends]]), the Matrikas are considered as representing a vice and are worshipped by ''pithapuja'' (a pilgrimage around the ''pithas'') to free oneself from them.<ref>van den Hoek, Bert in Nas, p.362</ref> Though each ''pitha'' is primarily dedicated to a Matrika, the other Matrikas are also worshipped as subordinate deities.<ref name="van den Hoek, Bert in Nas, p.367-8">van den Hoek, Bert in Nas, p.367-8</ref> The ''pithas'', which are "theoretically located at the outer boundaries of the city" are said to form a protective [[mandala]] around the city and assisted to a certain compass point.<ref>van den Hoek, Bert in Nas, p.364</ref> In other temples like the ones dedicated to [[Pacali Bhairava]], the Asthamatrikas are worshipped as a circle of stones.<ref name="van den Hoek, Bert in Nas, p.367-8"/> In [[Bhaktapur]], the Ashtamatrikas are believed to the preserver goddesses of the city guarding the eight geometrical directions. Mary Sluser says "Not only do the {{IAST|M<U+0101>t<U+1E5B>k<U+0101>s}} guard the compass points but they are also regarded as regents of the sky." <ref>White p.61</ref> Sometimes, they are paired with the Ashtabhairava ("Eight [[Bhairava]]s) and sculpted on temple roofs or terraces. Nepali Buddhists worship the Matrikas as described in [[Dharanisamgraha]]s.<ref>Pal in Singh p.1851</ref>

The [[Malla]] king of Nepal Srinivasa Malla built the [[Patan, Lalitpur|Patan]] [[durbar]] (court) in 1667 AD and is believed to have seen the Matrikas dance in the durbar one night. The king ordered that the Ashta-matrika be worshipped during the Ashwin [[Navaratri]] and cost is defrayed by the durbar. The custom continues til this day.<ref>p.245 History of Nepal: With an Introductory Sketch of the Country and People of Nepal. By Daniel Wright Published 1996,Asian Educational Services,340 pages,ISBN 8120605527 </ref> Another festival ''Ghorajatra'' is celebrated in Patan with animal sacrifices to the Matrikas.<ref>Nepal Handbook By Tom Woodhatch Published 1999 Footprint Travel Guides 572 pages ISBN 0658000160 </ref>

In the Kathmandu valley of Nepal, the Ashta-matrikas with a central village goddess are worshipped as protectors of the city or town. They are identified with the guardians of directions (''digpala''), places  (''lokapala'') or lands (''kshatrapala''), satiated by blood sacrifice. Newar Buddhists associate the Matrikas with 24 human qualities, which can mastered by visting three sets of eight Matrika ''pitha''s.<ref name = "Hiltebeitel260">Hiltebeitel p. 260</ref>

===Tantric worship===
[[Image:Saptamatrika (seven mothers) in Panchalingeshvara Temple at Govindanahalli.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Saptamatrika with Ganesha, at [[Panchalingeshvara temple]] in [[Karnataka]].]]
The 7th century [[Sanskrit]] author [[Banabhatta]] mentions the propitiation of Matrikas by a Tantric ascetic in his [[Harshacharita]].<ref>Banerji p.34</ref> The text mentions use of ''{{IAST|m<U+0101><U+1E6D>rmandala}}'' ([[mandala]] of the Matrikas) or ''[[Yantra]]'' along with a special ''anusthana'' (ritual) to cure the ailing king.<ref name="Joshi, M.C p.48">Joshi, M.C. in Harper and Brown, p.48</ref> The text describes "young nobles [..](of the king) burning themselves with lamps to propitiate the Matrikas in a temple dedicated to the Matrikas (''{{IAST|ma<U+1E6D><U+1E5B>-g<U+1E5B>ha}}''). Banabhatta's [[Kadambari]], [[Bhasa]]'s [[C<U+0101>rudatta]], [[<U+015A>udraka|Shudraka]]'s [[Mrichakatika]] mention the ritual offerings of food and shrines of Matrikas at [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]].<ref name="Lorenzen p.29"/> Other offerings include flowers and clothes and meat and wine for some Matrikas. Tantric works like Tantrar<U+0101>ja-Tantra (unknown date, author) and {{IAST|Kulac<U+016B><U+1E0D><U+0101>ma<U+1E47>i}} discuss the worship of Matrikas as Shaktis or letters of the alphabet.<ref>Banerji p.148 and 205</ref> A process of this worship, ''Matrika-nyasa'' (lit. "installation of the Mothers"), is described in [[History_of_Shaktism#Devi_Gita|Devi Gita]], part of Devi Bhagavata Purana.<ref>Brown, p.292 Verses 10.6-8</ref> It involves installation of powers of Matrikas - as letters of the alphabet - in one's body, by "feeling the deity worshipped in different parts of the body" like head, face, anus and legs and reciting [[mantra]]s.<ref>Banerji p.27</ref> The ''Hrillekha-matrika-nyasa'', a more specialized form of ''Matrika-nyasa'', combines the installation of "most powerful set of all letters (Matrikas)" with the seed syllable ''{{IAST|Hr<U+012B><U+1E43>}}'' of Goddess [[Bhuvaneshvari]].<ref>Brown, p.293-4</ref> 

Stone inscriptions of Tantric worship of The Matrikas are found in [[Gangadhar]], [[Rajasthan]](by king [[Vishvavarman]]- 423 C.E., identified as the first epigraphic evidence of Tantra worship); in [[Bihar]] (by Guptas - fifth century) and in [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh|Deogarh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] (by {{IAST|Sv<U+0101>mibha<U+1E6D>a}} - sixth century).<ref name="Lorenzen p.29"/> The Gangadhar inscripture deals with a construction to a shrine to Chamunda and the other Matrikas, "who are attended by [[Dakini]]s (female demons)" and rituals of daily Tantric worship (''Tantrobhuta'') like the ritual of ''Bali'' (offering of grain).<ref name="Joshi, M.C p.48"/>

The eight Matrikas are said to reside the second line of ''bhupura'' in [[Sri Chakra]]. They are frequently aligned with the Eight [[Bhairava]]s, as in ''{{IAST|J<U+0148><U+0101>n<U+0101>r<U+1E47>ava Tantra}}''. The {{IAST|Svaccha<U+1E47><U+1E0D>a Tantra}}(1.33) explains that the primary function of Matrikas is to preside eight groups (''vargas'') of letters of Devanagari alphabet, while Brahmay<U+0101>mala states they issue originate from the vowels.<ref>Brooks p.143-4</ref>

===Rituals and goals of worship===
The [[Natya Shastra]] (13.66) recommends worship to Matrikas before setting up the stage and before dance performances.<ref>Kinsley p.155</ref> Indra declares in chapter 90 of Devi Purana that the Matrikas are the best among all deities and should be worshipped in cities, villages, towns and shields.<ref>Singh p.1850</ref> Matrikas are generally to be worshipped on all occasions with [[Navagraha]] (the nine planets) and the Dikpala ([[Guardians of the directions]]) and at night with the Goddess.<ref>Singh p.1850-51</ref>

The Matsya Purana and Devi Purana prescribe that Matrika shrines should be north-facing and be placed in northern part of a temple-complex.<ref>Pal in Singh p.1850-1</ref> The temples of the Matrikas are found earliest dating to the fourth century and from textual evidence, it is predicated that "there must be impressive shrines all over the [Indian] subcontinent".<ref>Pal in Singh p.1854</ref> Although circular Mandalas and Chakras are mentioned in religious texts, most existing shrines are rectangular in nature. Pal speculates that earlier circular shrines, which open to the sky or under trees of less durable material were replaced by the Guptas in stone as rectangular shrines.<ref name="Pal in Singh p.1858"/>

The [[Devi Purana]] mentions the Matrikas or ''Deva Shaktis'' (powers of the gods) as group of seven or more, who should be worshipped for [[Mukti]] (liberation) by all, but particularly kings for powers of domination.<ref name="Harper in Harper and Brown, p.117"/> The Saptamatrika are worshipped for "personal and spiritual renewal" with Mukti as the ultimate goal as well as for powers to control and rule and earthly desires ([[Bhukti]]).<ref>Harper in Harper and Brown, p.122</ref> Also important are the banners of the Saptamatrikas, which are carved outside the Udayagiri caves. These banners are called "Indra's sisters" in the Devi Purana. The Purana lists them as: swan, bull, peacock, conch, discus, elephant and skleton - attributes of the Matrikas. A king installing these banners is believed to get mukti and bhukti. As per the [[Nitisara]], Matrikas acted as the king's tangible Shaktis and conferred the power to conquer and rule.<ref>Harper in Harper and Brown, p.125-7</ref>
