The '''Salisbury by-election, 1942''' was a [[by-election]] held for the [[British House of Commons]] [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of '''[[Salisbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Salisbury]]''' in [[Wiltshire]] on 8 July 1942.  It was won by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidate [[John Morrison, 1st Baron Margadale|John Morrison]], later [[Baron Margadale]].

== Vacancy ==
The seat had become vacant on the death of the 55-year-old sitting [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[James Despencer-Robertson]]. He had won the seat at a [[Salisbury by-election, 1931|by-election in 1931]], having previously been MP for [[Islington West (UK Parliament constituency)|Islington West]] from [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922]] to [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923]].

== Candidates ==

During [[World War II]], most by-elections were unopposed, since the major parties had agreed not to contest by-elections when vacancies arose in seats held by the other parties; contests occurred only when independent candidates or minor parties chose to stand, and the [[Common Wealth Party]] was formed with the specific aim of contesting war-time by-elections.

In Salisbury, there were two [[independent (politics)|independent]] candidates: 
William Reginald Hipwell, editor of ''Reveille'', a " barrack room newspaper for the fighting forces",<ref>{{cite web|title=Investigation into the affairs of W.R.

D. Monro as an "Independent Democrat".
