'''Imperial War Museum North''' (sometimes referred to as '''IWM North''') is a museum in [[Greater Manchester]], England. One of the five branches of the [[Imperial War Museum]], the museum explores the impact of modern conflicts on people and society. It is the first branch of the Imperial War Museum to be located in the north of England. The museum occupies a site overlooking the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in [[Trafford Park]], an area which during the [[Second World War]] was a [[Trafford_Park#Second_World_War|key industrial centre]] and consequently heavily bombed during the [[Manchester Blitz]] in 1940. The area is now home to [[the Lowry]] cultural centre and the [[mediacity:uk]] development, which stand opposite the museum at [[Salford Quays]].

The museum building was designed by [[architect]] [[Daniel Libeskind]] and opened in July 2002, receiving 470,000 visitors in its first year of opening. It was recognised with awards or prize nominations for its architecture, but has also been criticised for poor energy efficiency. The museum features a permanent exhibition of chronological and thematic displays, supported by hourly audiovisual presentations which are projected throughout the gallery space. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions in a separate gallery. Since opening, the museum has operated a successful [[volunteer]] programme, which since January 2007 has been run in partnership with [[Manchester Museum]]. As part of a national museum, Imperial War Museum North is financed by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] and by self-generated income. Admission is free.

==Planning and construction==
During the 1990s, the Imperial War Museum sought to open a branch in the north of England. Seventy-one sites were offered for consideration by 36&nbsp;local councils.<ref name=Glancey>Glancey, Jonathan (22 April 2002) [[The Guardian|''Guardian Unlimited'']] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4398707,00.html War and peace and quiet]. Accessed 7 October 2009</ref> One such council was that of [[Hartlepool]], in [[County Durham]], for whom a new museum building was designed by [[architect]] [[Norman Foster (British architect)|Sir Norman Foster]] for a site on Hartlepool's dockside.<ref>Glancey, Jonathan (27 July 1994) ''[[The Independent]]'' [http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/architecture-renaissance-in-the-north-the-northeast-is-forging-a-brave-new-future-for-itself-by-translating-its-mills-into-museums-jonathan-glancey-reports-1416523.html Architecture: Renaissance in the North].

===Architecture===
[[file:ImperialWarMuseumNorth02Trim.jpg|thumb|The entrance to Imperial War Museum North, at the base of the air shard tower]]
An architectural competition for the new museum was held in 1997, with the winning design being that of Berlin-based [[architect]] [[Daniel Libeskind]]. Born in [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]], Poland, in 1946, Libeskind's family had suffered during the [[Second World War]] and dozens of his relatives had died in the [[Holocaust]]. At the museum's opening, Libeskind said that he sought to "create a building&nbsp;... which emotionally moved the soul of the visitor toward a sometimes unexpected realization"'.<ref name=Forrester>Forrester, Jim (2004) ''Manchester Region History Review'' Vol. 17 No. 1 [http://www.mcrh.mmu.ac.uk/pubs/pdf/mrhr_17i_museums_forrester.pdf War & Conflict: New Perspectives in the North]. (Manchester: [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]). Accessed 9 October 2009.</ref> Libeskind envisaged a'' 'constellation composed of three interlocking shards' ''<ref name=Libeskind>Libeskind, Daniel; ''Studio Daniel Libeskind'' [http://www.daniel-libeskind.com/projects/show-all/imperial-war-museum-north/ Imperial War Museum North]. Accessed 7 October 2009.</ref> with each shard being a remnant of an imagined globe shattered by conflict. These shards in turn represented air, earth and water, and each formed a functionally distinct part of the museum. The 55m high air shard, provides the museum's entranceway and a viewing balcony above the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] with views of the Manchester skyline. The construction of the tower leaves viewers exposed to the elements and one reviewer considered that it reflected "the aerial perspective of modern warfare and the precariousness of the life below".<ref name=Glancey/> The earth shard houses the museum's exhibition spaces, while the water shard accommodates a cafe with views of the canal. Originally budgeted at <U+00A3>40&nbsp;million, the museum was eventually completed for <U+00A3>28.5&nbsp;million after anticipated [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies. The [[European Union]]'s [[European Regional Development Fund]] contributed <U+00A3>8.9&nbsp;million, [[English Partnerships]] and the [[North West Development Agency]] <U+00A3>2.7&nbsp;million, and <U+00A3>2.8&nbsp;million was provided by Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council. [[Peel Holdings]], a local transport and property company, contributed <U+00A3>12.5&nbsp;million;<ref name=AJ/> this was reportedly the largest single sum ever given to a UK cultural project by a private enterprise.<ref name=Vallely>Vallely, Paul (17 July 2002) ''[[The Independent]]'' [http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/uk/its-grand-up-north-648609.html It's grand up North]. Accessed 15 October 2009.</ref> The reduction in budget forced a number of changes; the substitution of metal for concrete in the construction of the shards, the removal of a planned auditorium, and a change of exhibition content. The site's external landscaping also had to be reduced; in 2009, following an international design competition, Berlin-based company Topotek 1 were appointed to complete this landscaping.<ref>George, Sophie (12 June 2009) ''[[Architects Journal]]'' [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/first-look-topotek-1-adds-to-libeskinds-imperial-war-museum-north/5203431.article First Look: Topotek 1 adds to Libeskind's Imperial War Museum North].

In addition to the physical exhibits, the walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of hourly audiovisual presentations called the Big Picture, which explore themes related to modern conflict. These presentations use up to 1,500&nbsp;images from the Imperial War Museum's [[Imperial War Museum#Collections|photograph archive]] projected from 60&nbsp;synchronised [[slide projector]]s mounted throughout the space.<ref name=Martin/> The images are complemented by personal accounts from the museum's [[oral history]] sound archive. The Big Picture was devised after the reduction in the museum's budget forced the scrapping of the previous exhibition plan by designers DEGW and Amalgam.<ref>''[[Architects Journal]]'' (28 January 1999) [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/libeskinds-war-museum-to-go-ahead-but-at-a-cost-/769243.article Libeskind's war museum to go ahead - but at a cost.].

Supporting Imperial War Museum North's educational goals, the museum has operated a [[volunteer]] programme since opening in 2002. The programme seeks to engage local people at risk of social exclusion. Originally based on a [[National Vocational Qualification]], the programme was revised and relaunched in 2004, and consisted of a basic cultural heritage course, providing opportunities to develop academic skills and improve confidence, and to support individuals seeking to return to employment.<ref>[[Northwest Development Agency]] (25 May 2005) [http://www.nwda.co.uk/news--events/press-releases/200501/imperial-war-museum-north-awar.aspx Imperial War Museum North awarded for Volunteers Programme].
