The '''H<U+00E4>meenmaa class minelayers''' ({{lang-fi|H<U+00E4>meenmaa}}-luokan miinalaiva) is a two vessel strong class of [[minelayer]]s, used by the [[Finnish Navy]].

The ships have a steel hull and alloy superstructure. The class has an ice operating classification of ICE-1A and can operate around the year. The design included some first attempts on [[stealth technology]] in the Finnish Navy.

During a crisis the main task for the ''H<U+00E4>meenmaa'' class ships is minelaying, but the vessels can also act as escort, transport and depot ships.

== History ==
[[Image:FNS Uusimaa Helsinki 1.jpg|thumb|left|FNS ''Uusimaa'' in [[Helsinki]].]]
The contract for the ''H<U+00E4>meenmaa'' class was originally awarded to [[W<U+00E4>rtsil<U+00E4>|W<U+00E4>rtsil<U+00E4> Meriteollisuus]], but following its bankruptcy the contract was transferred to [[Hollming]]. Turmoil in the Finnish shipbuilding industry didn't stop there. In early [[1992]] Hollming and [[Rauma Yards]] merged their shipbuilding industry to form a new company called [[Finnyards]].

===Modernization===

Both ships are being modernized [[2006]]-[[2008]]. The purpose of the modernization is to firstly upgrade the ships' equipment to fit modern standards, and secondly, to enable the ships to participate in international operations, mainly [[European Security and Defence Policy]] operations. They are fitted with weapons systems transferred from the discontinued [[Tuuli class hovercraft|''Tuuli'' class]] hovercrafts including the [[Umkhonto missile]] system. Also a new fire control system Saab 9LV325E FCS, modern monitoring equipment including TRS3D-16ES surveillance radar and Kongsberg ST2400 Variable Depth Sonar and SS2030 Hull mounted sonar, and possibly other modernised equipment will be installed.

==Role after modernization==

Modernization of the two H<U+00E4>meenmaa-class ships serves of course the interests of Finnish Navy, but also the ones of EU's Helsinki Headline Goal: these two ships will most likely be the most important ships for EU, having relatively wide selection of roles that they can assume, from light espionage- and minelayer ship to escort- and anti-submarine warfare ship, these two vehicles are practically perfect for monitoring Russia's Baltic fleet.

''H<U+00E4>meenmaa'' was delivered from the dock back to the Navy on 13 April 2007 and ''Uusimaa'', which had been under modernization since November 2006 at the [[Aker Yards]] dock in [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]], was delivered on 26 October 2007. ''H<U+00E4>meenmaa'' and ''Uusimaa'' will be conducting sea trials on their new systems until the end of 2008, when operational readiness is achieved.<ref>[http://www.mil.fi/merivoimat/tiedotteet/3456.dsp www.mil.fi 26.10.2007]</ref>
