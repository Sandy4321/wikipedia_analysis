'''Dave Strasser''' (born July 13, 1969) is a former American [[mixed martial arts]] fighter who competed in the [[Welterweight (MMA)|Welterweight]] division for the [[UFC]], [[Shooto]], [[M-1 Global]], and [[Cage Rage Championships|Cage Rage]]. 14 of his 25 career wins came by way of submission.

==Background==
Strasser competed in [[high school wrestling]] and [[collegiate wrestling]], in addition to [[boxing]] and [[Karate|Shidokan Karate]]. His studying of Shidokan led a six-month stay in Japan to compete in [[kickboxing]].<ref>http://uscombatsports.com/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&view=items&cid=184&id=2247&Itemid=107</ref>

==Mixed martial arts career==
Strasser's second professional fight was a no-rules bout against a fighter making his professional debut, [[Travis Fulton]].<ref name=mccauley>McCauley, Bob. "[http://martialartsmagazine.com/HomePage/travis_fulton.htm Travis Fulton <U+2013> on the road to the top]", ''Martial Arts'' magazine, November 1, 1999.</ref> Strasser subdued the inexperienced Fulton with a choke hold from behind.<ref name=mccauley /> Fulton would go on to become one of the most prolific fighters in mixed martial arts history, with over 300 recorded professional decisions as of November 2011. 

Strasser trained with [[Pat Miletich]] and [[Jeremy Horn]] from 1996-97.<ref>http://uscombatsports.com/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&view=items&cid=184&id=2247&Itemid=107</ref>

==UFC==
At [[UFC 42]], Strasser fought against Romie Aram.<ref name=plottufc42>Plott, J. Michael. "Xtreme Fighting: UFC 42: Sudden Impact", ''Black Belt'' magazine, August 2003, pp. 54<U+2013>55.</ref> Aram had been undefeated before the fight, and was being groomed by the UFC for a possible title shot against [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]].<ref name=meltzer>Meltzer, Dave. "[http://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=dm-ufcfortytwo0514&prov=yhoo&type=lgns UFC 42: Wrestler vs. wrestler]", Yahoo! Sports, May 14, 2009.</ref> As such, Aram came into the fight as the favorite.<ref name=meltzer /> In the first round, Strasser was immediately dropped by a punch to the head, but he successfully pulled guard, and the referee stood the fighters up.<ref name=plottufc42 /> Strasser scored a takedown later in the round, delivering punches and elbows from the top position.<ref name=plottufc42 /> Strasser controlled the second round with standup striking, though Aram remained competitive.<ref name=plottufc42 /> The fighters remained on their feet in the third round, with Aram delivering more powerful punches but Strasser displaying better precision.<ref name=plottufc42 /> Strasser's blows in this round made Aram's nose bleed.<ref name=plottufc42 /> All three judges scored the fight for Strasser, and he won by unanimous decision.<ref name=plottufc42 />

Strasser fought again in the UFC at [[UFC 44]].<ref name=plottufc44>Plott, J. Michael. "Xtreme Fighting: Couture Spanks Ortiz at UFC 44", ''Black Belt'' magazine, January 2004, pp. 52 & 94.</ref> In the welterweight match, his opponent was judo practitioner [[Karo Parisyan]], who was making his debut in the UFC.<ref name=plottufc44 /> Parisyan's status as a student of notable judokas [[Gene LeBell]] and Gokor Chivchyan increased fan interest in the bout,<ref name=plottufc44 /> but the 21-year-old was still seen as a significant underdog.<ref name=fogan>Fogan, Sara. "Judo Stylist Triumphs at UFC 44", ''Black Belt'' magazine, April 2004, p. 118.</ref> When the fight started, Strasser attempted to stay on his feet and exchange punches.<ref name=plottufc44 /> Parisyan, however, performed a judo throw, which put Strasser on the ground and placed him in position for a [[Kimura lock|kimura]] armlock, which Parisyan duly applied.<ref name=fogan /> As a result of the hold, Strasser submitted at 3:52 of the first round.<ref name=plottufc44 /> This fight was notable, as judokas had not enjoyed many prior successes in MMA competitions, and Parisyan's win helped to establish [[judo]] as a viable [[martial arts]] style in [[mixed martial arts|MMA]].<ref name=fogan />

==Other ventures==
Strasser has also worked as a mixed martial arts trainer and promoter. He runs a gym, Dave Strasser's Freestyle Academy, in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]].<ref name=cole>Cole, David. "Ready to rumble `Ultimate fighting,' described by some as barbaric, will brawl in Kenosha", The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, October 19, 1999.</ref> [[Nick Thompson (fighter)|Nick Thompson]],<ref name=thompson>"[http://www.mmaranks.com/NickThompson.html 20 questions for... NICK THOMPSON]", mmaranks.com interview, published February 27, 2006.</ref>[[Jameel Massouh]], and [[Ben Rothwell]]<ref name=knapp>Knapp, Brian. "[http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/mma/news/story?id=4045087 Torres retains title in all-out slugfest]", ESPN.com, published April 6, 2009.</ref> are among the fighters who have trained with Strasser.

==Personal life==
Strasser comes from a very athletic family and has three brothers and two sisters. His father was an all-state sprinter and football player who was recruited by [[Miami University]] and other [[NCAA]] Division I schools. Strasser's uncle was a talented [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifter]], holding the state record for the squat and dead-lift. Strasser's siblings' accomplishments have ranged from a state finals champion in Cross Country, player of the year in baseball, all-state in basketball, [[NCAA]] Division I runner, among many other notable feats. One of his brothers, Mark, played professional football in Sweden and set Division I records for [[Central Connecticut State University]]. Mark currently works for the [[Minnesota Twins]] organization.<ref>http://www.criticalbench.com/Mark-Strasser.htm</ref>
