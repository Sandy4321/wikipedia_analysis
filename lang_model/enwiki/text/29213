'''Spinnaker Tower''' is a {{convert|170|m|adj=on}} landmark [[tower]] in [[Portsmouth]], England, UK. It is the centrepiece of the redevelopment of [[Portsmouth Harbour]], which was supported by a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] grant. Its shape was chosen by Portsmouth residents from a selection. The tower, designed by local firm [[HGP Architects]] and the engineering consultants [[Scott Wilson Group|Scott Wilson]] and built by [[Mowlem]], reflects Portsmouth's [[Sea|maritime]] history by its being modelled after a sail.<ref>{{cite web| title= Spinnaker Tower Also known as Portsmouth Millenium Tower | url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=406 | work=Skyscraper News | date=8 December 2012 | accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> The tower was opened on 18 October 2005.

The tower is owned by Portsmouth City Council, but operationally managed by Continuum Leading Attractions, a cultural attractions group based in York. Continuum also run five other visitor attractions across the country.

==Structure==
The tower, at a height of 170&nbsp;m<!--converted above--> above [[Ordnance Datum|sea level]], is {{frac|2|1|2}} times as high as [[Nelson's Column]], making it the tallest accessible structure in the United Kingdom outside London. The tower is visible for miles around Portsmouth, changing the horizon of the area. It can be seen from the [[Isle of Wight]] and the [[Manhood Peninsula]].

The tower represents sails billowing in the wind, a design accomplished using two large, white, sweeping metal arcs, which give the tower its [[spinnaker]] sail design. The steelwork was fabricated by [[Butterley Engineering]]. At the top is a triple observation deck, providing a 350<U+00B0> view of the city of [[Portsmouth]], the [[Langstone Harbour|Langstone]] and Portsmouth harbours, and a viewing distance of {{convert|37|km|mi}}. The highest of the three observation platforms, the [[crow's nest]], has a wire mesh roof, allowing visitors to be in the elements. Windows extend to above head height, so it is not possible to get a view unobstructed by glass. The [[glass floor]] is the largest in Europe. The tower has a design lifetime of 80 years.<ref>[[LUSAS]], 4 November 2005. [http://www.lusas.com/case/civil/spinnaker_tower.html Spinnaker Tower, Portsmouth]. Retrieved 17 September 2006.</ref>

The design is similar to the [[Burj Al Arab]] in [[Dubai]], whose structure is a little less than twice as tall at {{convert|323|m}}.

==History==
Planning began in 2000, and construction began 2001, and was completed in mid-2005, due to repeated delays and extra funding requests by the builders [[Mowlem]]. This was six years later than the planned opening date of 1999, chosen to coincide with [[Millennium]] celebrations. The tower, originally called Portsmouth Millennium Tower, was renamed Spinnaker Tower.

The project was over budget, with an overall cost of <U+00A3>35.6 million for the tower alone. Taxpayers were not meant to fund the tower, but Portsmouth City Council eventually contributed <U+00A3>11.1 million towards construction.

In March 2004, Portsmouth Council's former leader Cllr Leo Madden resigned from leading the Labour Group on the Council after a highly critical report of the council's handling of the project and failure to exploit revenue opportunities, such as the Millennium. Barry Smith, the project's legal advisor, also retired after being suspended on full pay,<ref>{{cite news | author=Staff writers | title=Spinnaker opens five years late | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/4326932.stm | work=BBC News | date=18 October 2005 | accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> mostly due to controversy over the contract with the builders, which at one point would have cost the council more to cancel than to complete.

The tower has had a number of issues since opening, including a malfunctioning external glass [[Elevator|lift]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Staff writers | title=City's troubled tower lift shuts | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/hampshire/7409772.stm | work=BBC News | date=20 May 2008 | accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> During the late construction a protester from the rights group [[Fathers 4 Justice]] scaled the tower wearing a [[high-visibility clothing|high-visibility jacket]] unfurling a banner in the process.<ref>{{cite news| author=Staff writers | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/4136369.stm | work=BBC News | title=Father's rights man scales tower | date=30 December 2004}}</ref> Another incident happened a year later when a [[base jumper]] managed to get past site security and base jump off the Spinnaker Tower, he quickly ran off site after parachuting down.<ref>{{cite news| author=Staff writers | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/4145808.stm | work=BBC News | title=Parachutist jumps from Spinnaker | date=12 August 2005}}</ref>

The tower was dedicated on 16 October 2005 and opened two days later. On opening day, the Tower's [[project manager]], David Greenhalgh, and representatives for [[Mowlem]] and Maspero were stranded in the tower's malfunctioning external lift (built by Maspero) for an hour and a half. [[Abseiling]] engineers were called to rescue them.<ref>{{cite news | author=Staff writers | title=Troubled Spinnaker given blessing | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/4345534.stm | work=BBC News | date=16 October 2005 | accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author=Staff writers | title=Council boss trapped in Spinnaker | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/4351452.stm | work=BBC News | date=18 October 2005 | accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Spinnaker's big day hit by a towering calamity | url=http://www.portsmouthtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=455&ArticleID=1224482 | work=Portsmouth Today | date= 18 October 2005 | accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> Some, including the franchise's chief executive, felt it was rather fitting that these particular people were trapped.<ref>{{cite news | title=Red faces over Portsmouth's showcase project | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/10/19/ntower19.xml&sSheet=/news/2005/10/19/ixhome.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=19 October 2005 | accessdate=28 April 2006}}</ref> As of December 2012, the external lift was being removed.

Once open, the tower attracted crowds in excess of expectations, despite only the internal lift working since opening, with over 600,000 people visiting the tower in the first year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spinnaker Tower | publisher= Mott MacDonald |url=http://www.mottmac.com/projects/?id=39661 |accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> It is one of a number of observation towers around the world that have become popular, including [[Vancouver]]'s [[Harbour Centre]], Toronto's [[CN Tower]], [[Blackpool]]'s [[Blackpool Tower|Tower]] and Shanghai's [[Oriental Pearl Tower]].

In June 2006, the local press raised a concern that the tower may be forced to close. All public buildings in the UK require disabled access under the 1995 [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|Disability Discrimination Act]]. With the external lift inoperative and only the internal lift for disabled access, the tower did not meet this requirement, and the tower operators could be sued under the act.<ref>{{cite news | title=Closure threat to Spinnaker Tower | url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/local/east-hampshire/closure_threat_to_spinnaker_tower_1_1265803 | work=Portsmouth Today | date=4 July 2006 | accessdate=3 March 2011}}</ref> This problem was rectified by investing in an evacuation chair, and training for staff to use it. In the event of evacuation, should the internal lift be inoperable, those unable to navigate the 570 steps can use the evacuation chair.

The Spinnaker, being a southern landmark, features on the BBC South Today news programme. It also features on ITV News.

In June 2009, Tower operators succeeded in gaining permission for a free fall ride to be attached to the Tower.<ref>{{cite news | title=Spinnaker Tower freefall plan approved | url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/biz/Spinnaker-Tower-freefall-plan-approved.5406244.jp | work=Portsmouth News | date=29 June 2009 | accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> As of 2011 this has only been a plan.

In 2006, the tower won the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors|RICS]] Project of the year award and the RICS Regeneration award.<ref>{{cite web| title = Portsmouth Spinnaker Tower (Regeneration Winner 2006)| publisher = RICS| url = http://www.rics.org/AboutRICS/Awards/RICSAwards/RICSRegenerationAward/awards_portsmouthspinnakertower02062006.htm| accessdate =  26 October 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
