'''''Live at the Roundhouse 1975''''' is a 1982 album of a 1975 concert by the [[UK underground]] group [[Pink Fairies]].

A one-off reunion concert featuring all five previous members of the group was organised by Ted Carroll, head of [[Chiswick Records]]. At the time of this gig, Rudolph was also playing bass for [[Hawkwind]] whilst Wallis was playing guitar for [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]]. The tapes were licensed from Douglas Smith for release in 1982, although only part of the concert was issued, the rest being deemed unsuitable for public consumption.<ref>Fairies Wear Boots <U+2013> Kerrang! 1983 <U+2013> [http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/_drw01/pinkfairies.html HawkFanFare]</ref>

It was pressed on pink vinyl with a cover by long standing collaborator Edward Barker featuring a pig which had become the band's ident. The track "Going Down" is a cover of the [[Freddie King]] song, but was erroneously credited to Lou Reed on the original release.
