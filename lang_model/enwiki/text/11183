==Early life==
Cheng was born in Hong Kong with family roots in [[Chaozhou]], [[Guangdong]]. Cheng Cheng received his education in Hong Kong. He later became an apprentice in aircraft maintenance, and obtained professional qualifications as an aircraft maintenance engineer. Between 1970 and 1981, Cheng worked as an aircraft engineer at [[CP Air]].

==Publishing career==
In 1981, Cheng left the aviation industry and became an independent market consultant. In 1983, Cheng was invited by the chairman of Sing Tao Holdings, Sally Aw Sian, to return to Hong Kong and lead the Group<U+2019>s advertising, marketing and business development. He left the company in 1985.

After consulting for a Sino-Canadian joint venture on the tender for a [[Light Rail (MTR)|Light Rail Transit system]] project, Cheng established the Capital Communications Corporation Ltd. in 1986. The company founded the Capital magazine and introduced in Hong Kong the Chinese edition of publications such as Playboy and Forbes. The launch of the first edition of Playboy whose cover girl was Miss Hong Kong [[Olivia Cheng]], and of Olivia Cheng<U+2019>s Photo Album caused a furor in society. The Capital magazine published after the 1987 stock market crash was the most successful business/financial magazine in Hong Kong and introduced the rich and family listing in Hong Kong.

In 1990, Capital Communications Corporation was given an award for its enterprising achievement. In 1991, the company was acquired by Paramount Publishing Group, of which Cheng became CEO until 1994. 

In 1999, Cheng took advantage of the dot-com bubble to set up 36.com Holdings Ltd., which was listed on the Growth Enterprise Market in 2000. 36.com was initially a website but it later launched the Cup magazine, a weekly magazine that has turned into a monthly publication now. Cheng is still the publisher emeritus of the Cup magazine. 

==From <U+201C>News Tease<U+201D> to <U+201C>Teacup in a Storm<U+201D>==

In 1994, Cheng partnered with [[Raymond Wong Yuk Man|Raymond Wong Yuk-man]] and Chan Yiu-nam to co-host ATV<U+2019>s talk show <U+201C>News Tease<U+201D>, which turned out to be widely popular. In 1995, Winnie Yu of Commercial Radio invited Cheng to host the morning phone-in programme entitled <U+201C>Teacup in a Storm<U+201D>. Cheng<U+2019>s relentless criticisms of government officials and discussions on numerous hotly debated livelihood issues and current affairs made the talk show the most popular current affairs programme in the broadcasting sector. For ten consecutive years, Cheng was named the most popular radio host, and <U+201C>Teacup in a Storm<U+201D> ranked first among the most popular radio programmes. Because of this talk show, Cheng was also rated as one of the 25 most influential Hongkongers by Time magazine in 1997. In 1998, he was selected as one of the 50 Asia<U+2019>s Stars by Business Week. In 2000, Cheng was named one of the 25 most influential Hongkongers by Asiaweek and [[Ming Pao]].
Cheng<U+2019>s influence, however, also invited his assault. In August 1998, on his way to work, Cheng was attacked by thugs outside the Commercial Radio headquarters. He suffered eight slashes and the tendons of his hand were chopped off. He was hospitalized for two months. To date, nobody has been arrested for the attack.

During the SARS outbreak in 2003, many medical workers of the Hospital Authority called Cheng<U+2019>s talk show to complain about the Authority<U+2019>s slow action against the epidemic outbreak. In response, Cheng contacted and queried the concerned officials, and organized a fund-raising campaign to help purchase facial masks for frontline medical workers. He was thus hailed as the <U+201C>Chief Executive before 10am<U+201D>.  He also ordered from a Canadian manufacturer 500,000 bottles of Vitamin C pills in one go and distributed them to primary and secondary school students in Hong Kong. Moreover, he launched the <U+201C>One orange for one medical worker<U+201D> campaign, which successfully raised approximately HK$100 million worth of supplies and services.

==The Talk Show Saga==
During the [[SARS outbreak]], to safeguard the welfare of medical workers, Cheng ruthlessly condemned his friend Ko Wing-man, former Director of Hospital Authority, in his talk show. In April 2003, Cheng called Lau Kai-hung, Assistant Director of Housing, a <U+201C>dog official<U+201D>. In June, according to sources, the government would renew the Commercial Radio<U+2019>s operating licence for three years only. In the summer of 2003, Cheng deliberately took leave from the radio operator until autumn. This was seen as a move to reconcile the parties concerned and help the Commercial Radio renew its licence for a normal six-year period.

On 1 May 2004, Cheng announced that he would take leave again on the grounds of pressure and was temporarily replaced by Allen Lee Peng-fei, Leung Man-to, Tony Tsoi Tung-ho and Ivan Choy Chi-keung as co-hosts of the talk show. However, Cheng was suddenly dismissed by Winnie Yu during his leave and was forced to quit the radio programme. Yu and Cheng confronted each other over the issue on a number of media occasions. The Commercial Radio later dismissed Tsoi and Leung as well, and suspended Choy<U+2019>s duties in the programme. In October 2004, <U+201C>Teacup in a Storm<U+201D> was replaced by a new programme called <U+201C>On a Clear Day<U+201D>.

==Legislative Councillor==
In August 2004, Cheng decided to participate in politics in order to retain the people<U+2019>s voice in society, and joined hands with Andrew To Kwan-hang, the then Secretary of The Frontier and [[Wong Tai Sin District]] Council member ([[Chuk Yuen North Estate]]), to contest Legislative Council election in the Kowloon East constituency. The swift approval of his application to relinquish his Canadian nationality by the Canadian government qualified him to run for the election. Cheng won more than 73,000 votes, the largest number of votes obtained among the contestants, and was elected a lawmaker. In 2008, he announced that he would not stand for re-election.

During his service as a lawmaker, Cheng was a member of the Public Accounts Committee and chairman of the Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting. He was considered a pan-democrat in the legislature, but had dividing views with the pro-democracy camp over the constitutional reform in 2005 and the nomination of his good friend [[Donald Tsang|Donald Tsang Yam-kuen]] as chief executive.

==The Link Reit Incident==
In December 2004, the Housing Department bypassed the legislature and injected into the Link Real Estate Investment Trust (Link REIT) the commercial properties of public housing estates, including 150 public shopping malls and 80,000 car park spaces. It also launched an initial public offering and planned to list the Link REIT on the stock exchange on 16 December. Cheng opposed the listing on the grounds that the public assets were sold to the Link Reit at too low a price. He thus supported the attempt of a public housing estate resident, Lo Siu-lan, to prevent the Link REIT from being listed on the stock exchange by initiating a litigation in the High Court on 8 December, accusing the Housing Department of breaching the Housing Ordinance. Although the case was overruled by the Court of Final Appeal, the listing was withdrawn since the litigation did not close before the listing date. The Link REIT was officially listed in 2005.

Cheng<U+2019>s opposition to the listing of the Link REIT was then criticized for hindering others from reaping profits. On 1 January 2005, 50,000 people joined a protest against Cheng. In 2007, however, with the increasing number of complaints about the Link REIT, the public changed to support Cheng<U+2019>s position. Cheng also stressed in his promotion materials his clear objection to the listing of the Link REIT in December 2004.

On 1 January 2005, at the instigation of some shameless politicians and media, 50,000 people allegedly took to the street to protest against the <U+201C>backstage manipulator<U+201D> who prevented the Link REIT from being listed on the stock exchange. 

==Family Life==
Cheng reportedly married Canto-pop queen [[Paula Tsui|Paula Tsui Siu-fung]] in Canada in 1975 but was divorced in 1979. Neither of them has ever admitted the reports. According to sources, they were only lovers at that time; the pair got married just to help Tsui and her family members to migrate to Canada, and they had no actual husband and wife relationship. In 1987, Cheng married Irene Lo Kam-seung, Miss Hong Kong of 1981. They have three sons.

==Charity==
Cheng was an active participant of the minority equal rights movements in Canada in the 1970s. After he had returned to Hong Kong in the 1980s, he founded the Chinese Canadian Association of Hong Kong in 1987. He was also the chairman and a board member of the Society of Hong Kong Publishers, and the chairman of the Hong Kong Film Awards in 1982. In 1996, he set up the Senior Citizen Home Safety Association, of which he has been a trustee. The association provides the Personal Emergency Link Service for the elderly, and has been recognized as a role model for social enterprises.
