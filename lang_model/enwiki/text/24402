The '''Semper Gallery''' or '''Semper<U+2019>s Building''' (German: '''Sempergalerie''' or '''Semperbau''') in [[Dresden]], Germany, was designed by the architect [[Gottfried Semper]] and constructed from 1847 until 1854. 

The long-stretched building in [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style closes the [[Zwinger]] courtyard on its northern side. It faces the [[Zwinger]] in the south; in the north it borders the Theater Square (''Theaterplatz'') with the [[Semperoper|Semper Opera House]] as well as the [[Dresden Castle]] and the [[Katholische Hofkirche|Catholic Church of the Royal Court]] (''Katholische Hofkirche'').

The Semper Gallery houses the [[Gem<U+00E4>ldegalerie Alte Meister|Old Masters Picture Gallery]] (''Gem<U+00E4>ldegalerie Alte Meister'') and the [[Dresden Armory|Armory]] (''R<U+00FC>stkammer'').

When the [[Zwinger]] was completed in 1728, its northern side towards the Theater Square and the river was left open in order to allow for further enlargements.<ref name="Loeffler" >Fritz L<U+00F6>ffler: ''Das alte Dresden - Geschichte seiner Bauten''. 16th ed.

In 1838, the architect Gottfried Semper was asked to design an appropriate architectural setting for the [[Gem<U+00E4>ldegalerie Alte Meister|painting collection]] of the royal court.<ref name="Marx">Harald Marx: ''Gem<U+00E4>ldegalerie Dresden - F<U+00FC>hrer Alte Meister ''. E. A. Seemann, Leipzig, 3. Aufl., 2006, ISBN 978-3865020215, pp. 8-17. {{de icon}}</ref> It was not until 1846 that it was decided to close the northern side of the Zwinger courtyard by placing the gallery building there and so creating a gallery wing of the Zwinger.<ref name="Marx" /> 

The building, later named Semper Gallery, was constructed from 1847 until 1854. It is a reminiscence of the [[List of palazzi in Italy|Italian Palazzi]] of the [[Renaissance]].<ref name="Loeffler" /> In 1855, the interior was completed. Unlike the former buildings that housed the painting collection, the interior of the Semper Gallery could be heated and therefore could remain open throughout the year. In 1855 the collection moved into the Semper Gallery, where it opened as the New Royal Museum (''Neues K<U+00F6>nigliches Museum'').

The sculptors [[Ernst Friedrich August Rietschel|Ernst Rietschel]] and Ernst Julius H<U+00E4>hnel from [[Dresden]] did the outer decoration of the building.<ref >B<U+00E4>rbel Stefan: ''Ernst Rietschel <U+2013> Zum 200. Geburtstag des Bildhauers'', Skulpturensammlung der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden, 2004 {{de icon}}</ref>  
While the northern facade towards the Theater square displays [[Ancient art#Europe|antique themes]], the southern facade shows [[Christian art|Christian religious themes]].

Until the Second World War, the Semper Gallery housed not only the painting collection, by now named [[Old Masters Gallery]], but also the [[Kupferstichkabinett, Dresden|Collection of Prints, Drawings and Photographs]] and the Collection of Classical Sculptures.

The building was severely damaged during the February 13, 1945 [[bombing of Dresden in World War II]]. Most of the paintings were evacuated for safe-keeping earlier and so were not harmed. The building's reconstruction was completed in 1960.

Following another restoration period of more than four years, the Semper Gallery re-opened in 1992.
