'''George P. Burdell''' is a fictitious student officially enrolled at [[Georgia Tech]] in [[1927]] as a [[practical joke]].

==History==
===Origins===
The credit for the origins of Burdell go to William Edgar "Ed" Smith, [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] [[1930]]. George P. Burdell was born when Ed received two enrollment forms for Georgia Tech. The exact origin of George Burdell's name is still hazy, but Smith said that he originally intended to enroll his high school principal, George P. Butler. He decided against it and changed the last name to Burdell.<ref name="TBook">[http://web.archive.org/web/20051031055915/www.tbook.org/index.php?id=2 The TBook: George P. Burdell]</ref>

After being enrolled, Burdell signed up for all the same classes Smith did. And Smith would do everything twice, changing it slightly to avoid [[professor]]s catching his [[sham]]. When he had a test, he would take it twice and then turn it in under both names.<ref>[http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html RamblinWreck.com : Traditions]</ref> By 1930 George had earned his bachelor's, and only a few years later received his master's degree. He became an official [[alumnus]], even though he has remained an active student ever since.<ref name="SI">[http://gtalumni.org/StayInformed/magazine/spr98/div02.html Stay Informed profile]</ref>

George's first prank came after he was snubbed by a fraternity he had intended to join. "That irritated George. He went out and ordered a truckload of furniture to be delivered c.o.d. to that fraternity. Of course, the order was made by George P. Burdell."<ref>[http://gtalumni.org/news/ttopics/win96/drennon.html Burdell's Pal: Colonel Drennon to receive Alumni Distinguished Service Award]</ref>

===World War II===

During [[World War II]], George P. Burdell served in the armed forces on many fronts, his name appearing around the world. He was listed on the flight crew of a [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 bomber]], flying 12 missions over Europe with the [[8th Air Force]] in [[England]]. However, when a Tech graduate became the new operations officer for the crew, he immediately recognized the name on the flight log, and Burdell's flying days were over.<ref name="TBook"/>

Burdell and equally fictitious [[Agnes Scott College]] student [[Ramona Cartwright]] announced their engagement in the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' in the 1950s.<ref>[http://www.agnesscott.edu/studentlife/p_traditions.asp Agness Scott | Student Life | Traditions]</ref>{{check}}  Their 50th wedding anniversary, of "Mr. and Mrs. George P.
