"'''Homer's Phobia'''" is the fifteenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]], and originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] in the [[United States]] on February 16, 1997. In the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] dissociates himself from new family friend John after discovering that John is [[gay]]. Homer fears that John will have a negative influence on his son [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and decides to ensure Bart's heterosexuality by taking him hunting.

It was the first episode written by [[Ron Hauge]] and was directed by [[Mike B. Anderson]]. [[George Meyer]] pitched "Bart the homo" as an initial idea for an episode while [[show runner]]s [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] were planning an episode involving [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] "discovering the joys of [[Camp (style)|campy]] things". Oakley and Weinstein combined the two ideas and they eventually became "Homer's Phobia". Fox censors originally found the episode unsuitable for broadcast because of its controversial subject matter, but this decision was reversed after a turnover in the Fox staff. Filmmaker [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] guest-starred, providing the voice of the new character, [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#Season 8|John]].

"Homer's Phobia" was the show's first episode to revolve entirely around [[gay]] themes and received a positive critical response both for its humor and anti-[[homophobia]] message. It won four awards, including an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or Less)]] and a [[GLAAD Media Awards|GLAAD Media Award]] for "Outstanding TV <U+2013> Individual Episode".

== Plot ==
Needing money to pay for the gas repair bill, the Simpson family visits "Cockamamie's", an offbeat [[collectible]]s shop, hoping that it will purchase one of the family's heirlooms. Homer meets John, the antiques dealer, who explains that much of the merchandise is there because of its [[camp (style)|camp]] value. [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] are impressed with John, and Homer invites him to the Simpsons' house to see the campy items that the family owns. The next morning, Homer tells [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] that he likes John and suggests they invite him and "his wife" over. Marge hints repeatedly to an oblivious Homer that John is [[gay]], and when Homer finally understands, he is horrified. Homer's attitude towards John changes completely, and he turns against him, refusing to join his tour of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. The rest of the family joins John and has a good time, but Homer is upset with the family upon their return. The rest of the Simpson family continue to enjoy John's company, especially Bart, who starts wearing [[Aloha shirt|Hawaiian shirts]] and dancing in [[drag (clothing)|a woman's wig]]. This makes Homer uneasy, and he begins to fear Bart is gay.

Homer endeavors to make Bart more masculine by forcing him to look at a [[cigarette]] [[Billboard (advertising)|billboard]] featuring scantily clad women in hopes Bart will be attracted to girls, but instead Bart gets the urge to smoke "anything slim." Homer then escorts him to see a [[steel mill]], only to discover that the mill<U+2019>s muscle-bound workforce is all gay and that the factory in question moonlights as The Anvil, a gay disco. A desperate Homer insists on taking Bart [[deer hunting]] with [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] and [[Barney Gumble|Barney]]. When they cannot find any deer, they decide instead to go to "Santa's Village" and shoot the [[reindeer]] in the corral. This backfires when the reindeer attack them. John, with the help of Lisa and Marge, uses a Japanese [[Santa Claus]] robot to scare off the reindeer and save the hunting party. Homer accepts John, more or less, and tells Bart, who is still unaware of his father's concerns, that any way he lives his life is fine with him. After Lisa informs Bart that Homer thinks he is gay, Bart is stunned. The episode ends with everyone driving off in John's car.

Just before the end credits a dedication to the steelworkers of America is shown, reading ''"Keep reaching for that [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow]]!"''

== Production ==

The original concept for the episode came from a few lines of show ideas written by [[George Meyer]]. One of them read "Bart the homo", and [[Ron Hauge]] was selected to write the episode, with the story stemming from that line.<ref name="roncom">{{cite video | people=Hauge, Ron|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Phobia"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The idea of using [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] as a guest star had been around for a while. [[Showrunners]] [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] had planned to use him in an episode called "Lisa and Camp", which revolved around Lisa "discovering the joys of campy things".<ref name="Billcom">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Phobia"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Their idea was combined with Meyer's and it became this episode. The episode was originally titled "Bart Goes to Camp", but was renamed because the joke was too oblique.<ref name="roncom"/> [[Mike B. Anderson]] directed the episode, telling ''[[The Gold Coast Bulletin]]'': "When I read the script I was enthralled, not only because of the visual possibilities, but also because the story felt very solid. It was engaging and surprising and I really put heart into that episode."<ref name=origins/>

John Waters accepted his invitation to be a guest star instantly, stating that if it was good enough for [[Elizabeth Taylor]], who appeared in the season four episodes "[[Lisa's First Word]]" and "[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]", it was good enough for him. He joked, however, about a negative reaction if his character would be made to look like [[Richard Simmons]].<ref name="JohnWaterscom">{{cite video | people=Waters, John|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Phobia"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> As thanks for his performance, the show's staff sent Waters an [[Cel|animation cel]] from the episode which he now has hanging in his office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sick-boy.com/waters.htm|title=The Prince of Puke talks porn, pubes and periods|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Planet Sick Boy|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070624224210/http://www.sick-boy.com/waters.htm |archivedate = June 24, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

According to Oakley, the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[Censorship|censor]] objected to "Homer's Phobia" being aired. The normal procedure is for an episode's script to be sent to the censor and then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should be substituted. However this episode came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line in the show. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word "[[gay]]", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph which stated that "the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]". Usually the censor notes are ignored as the offending lines and problems are dealt with after the episode has been animated. In this case the entire episode was deemed a problem, so it could not be solved in this way.<ref name="Billcom"/> The staff asked Waters if he thought the gay community would find the episode offensive. Homer's use of the word "fag" to insult John was his only problem, so the writers changed it to "[[queer]]".<ref name="NoHomers">{{cite web|url=http://www.nohomers.net/showthread.php?t=51876&page=2|title=Ask Bill & Josh|publisher=[[NoHomers.net]]|date=2005-11-02|accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> The censor problems ultimately came to nothing as when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: "acceptable for broadcast".<ref name="Billcom"/>

The "gay steel mill" scene was written by [[Steve Tompkins]]. He first pitched that Homer and Bart would encounter [[Stevedore|longshoremen]], but it was too much work to animate the [[Cargo|lading]] of ships, so a steel mill was used instead.<ref name="tompkins">{{cite video | people=Tompkins, Stephen|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Phobia"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Tompkins also wrote a different third act for the episode which was replaced in the final cut. Instead of Homer, Bart, Barney and Moe going deer hunting and ending up at "Santa's Village" they would go back to the steel mill. There, Homer would attempt to prove his heterosexuality by having a human [[tractor pulling]] contest with some of the steel mill workers. It was decided that it "didn't really service the story" and was dropped.<ref name="com">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Tompkins, Steve|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Phobia"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

== Cultural references ==
The episode features numerous cultural references. The song "[[Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)]]" by [[C+C Music Factory]] is played twice during the episode: first as the steel mill transforms into a disco, and second over the closing credits.<ref name="BBC"/> Homer's record collection includes music by [[The New Christy Minstrels]] and The Wedding of [[Lynda Bird Johnson]], the albums ''Loony Luau'' and ''[[Ballads of the Green Berets]]'' by [[Staff Sergeant|Staff Sgt.]] [[Barry Sadler]].<ref name="book"/><ref name="BBC"/> The song that John picks out and he and Homer dance to is "[[I Love the Nightlife]]" by [[Alicia Bridges]], and the song that Bart dances to is [[Cher]]'s version of "[[The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)]]" by [[Betty Everett]].<ref name="BBC"/> When John is introduced there is a plastic pink flamingo lying in the background, a reference to John Waters's film ''[[Pink Flamingos]]''.<ref name="book"/>

=== Critical reviews and analysis ===
"Homer's Phobia" has been cited as a significant part of ''The Simpsons''' exploration of [[LGBT|lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)]] themes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why America's love affair with The Simpsons is being forced out of the closet|date=2004-08-07|author=Andrew Gumbel|work=[[Irish Independent]]}}</ref> The series made several references to homosexuality before the episode aired.<ref name="Mudhar">Raju Mudhar, "Springfield's coming-out party; Cartoon to reveal gay character And it might not be Smithers," ''[[Toronto Star]]'', July 28, 2004, pg. A.03.</ref> In the 1990 episode "[[Simpson and Delilah]]", the character Karl (voiced by [[Harvey Fierstein]]) kisses Homer, while the recurring character [[Waylon Smithers]] is often shown to be in love with his boss, [[Montgomery Burns]], initially suggestively and since then more overtly.<ref>Stephen Kiehl, "Homersexual debate splits Springfield," ''[[The Ottawa Citizen]]'', February 12, 2005, pg. L.7.</ref> However, "Homer's Phobia" was the first episode to revolve entirely around homosexual themes. Two later episodes that explored LGBT issues were "[[Three Gays of the Condo]]" and "[[There's Something About Marrying]]".<ref name="Outing">"Springfield awaits its first outing," ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', July 29, 2004, pg. E.2.</ref>

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood stated in their book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', that: "Only ''The Simpsons'' could do this so tongue-in-cheek that nobody could get in a tizzy about it. Very good indeed."<ref name="BBC"/> John Alberti praised the episode's critiquing of "the most common misconception about homosexuality: namely that gayness is somehow contagious", as well as its other themes.<ref name=alberti/> In his review of ''The Simpsons - The Complete Eighth Season'' DVD, Todd Gilchrist said that "Homer's Phobia" "certainly qualifies as one of the all-time greatest episodes."<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/725/725343p1.html|title=The Simpsons - The Complete Eighth Season|accessdate=2007-03-01|author=Gilchrist, Todd|date=2006-08-14|IGN.com}}</ref> Catharine Lumby of the [[University of Sydney]] cited the episode as an example of good satire as it "managed to explore a lot of [homosexual] issues in quite a deep way [...] without being overtly political" which she claimed, along with the episode's humor, made its anti-homophobia message more successful than that of other gay-themed shows like ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mmmmmmmm ... clever|work=[[The Age]]|author=Michael Lallo|date=2007-07-25|page=Culture 9}}</ref>

In 2002, ''Off the Telly'' writers Steve Williams and Ian Jones named "Homer's Phobia" one of the five worst episodes of ''The Simpsons'', stating that it "leaves such a nasty taste in the mouth", as Homer is "quite simply a bastard" throughout the course of the episode. The pair concluded by saying "this is a side of the show we'd not seen before, nor particularly wanted to see."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/?page_id=382|title=Five Of The Best ... And Five Of The Worst|accessdate=2007-05-13|author=Williams, Steve; Jones, Ian|publisher=Off the Telly}}</ref> In June 2003, Igor Smykov sued the Russian television channel [[REN TV]] on claims that ''The Simpsons'', along with ''[[Family Guy]]'', were "morally degenerate and promoted drugs, violence and homosexuality." As evidence, "Homer's Phobia" was shown to the judge to prove that ''The Simpsons'' promoted homosexuality, and thus should not be aired again on the channel. The case was thrown out after one day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/story/3199|title=Court Rules for Simpsons Cartoon|accessdate=2007-03-07|work=[[The St. Petersburg Times]]|date=2005-04-05}}</ref>
