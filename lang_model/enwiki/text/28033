==International career==
Mkhitaryan is one of the most important members of the [[Armenia national football team|Armenia national team]]. He debuted in an away [[exhibition game|friendly match]] against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] on 14 January 2007.

He scored six goals for Armenia in [[UEFA Euro 2012]] [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group B|qualifying Group B]], thus becoming top goalscorer in that group.<ref>{{cite web|title=EC Qualification|url=http://www.soccerway.com/international/europe/european-championship-qualification/2012-poland-ukraine/qualifying-round/group-b/|publisher=Soccerway |accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref> He scored an upsetting goal against the Republic of Ireland in which he ended Ireland's eight game clean sheet record. Although Armenia did not advance past the qualifying stage for UEFA Euro 2012, Mkhitaryan's performances landed him in the UEFA Euro 2012 Qualifying dream team with six goals.

==Style of play==

Mkhitaryan is capable of playing positions of both central striker and striker style midfielder. He thrives playing just behind the strikers, where he always looks to link up with his teammates in and around the box. Tearing apart opposition defences time and time again, he makes space for the striker/wingers to exploit and create goal scoring opportunities. Mkhitaryan has been praised for his technique, movement, accurate passing, dribbling, creativity, ball control and work rate. He's equipped with a dangerous shot, trickery to beat defenders, and a superb vision to go for the pass.<ref>{{cite web|title=UEFA Champions League: 4 players to keep an eye out for.|url=http://tikitakastyle.wordpress.com/tag/henrikh-mkhitaryan/|publisher=tikitakastyle.wordpress.com|accessdate=3 March 2013 | date = 18 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mkhitaryan is one of the best footballers of the Ukraine cup: Buryak|url=http://lurer.com/?p=36069&l=en|publisher=Lurer.com|accessdate=3 March 2013 | date = 14 August 2012}}</ref>

During the 2012<U+2013>13 season, Chelsea legend [[Pat Nevin]] said of Mkhitaryan, "Eleven goals in eight league matches already is fantastic, but when you add that he is a midfielder, it is phenomenal. You may not have heard of him yet, even if all the scouts at the top European clubs have, but you soon will. He has pace, skill, a rocket of a shot and the ability to arrive in the box like Frank Lampard. This all singles him out as a player who must be watched or more importantly marked."<ref>{{cite web|title=PAT NEVIN: GROUP TASK|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2915434|publisher=www.chelseafc.com|accessdate=3 March 2013 | date = 11 September  2012 | first = Pat | last = Nevin}}</ref>

==Personal life==
The death of his father impacted Mkhitaryan greatly. He feels if his father were alive, "everything would be different." Notwithstanding, he would give him a number of useful advices from a professional point of view. Those people, who enjoyed his father<U+2019>s play at [[Hrazdan Stadium]], say that their styles resemble each other very much.

Mkhitaryan is fluent in five languages: [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. [[Donbass Arena]] has a tradition of playing music each time home players score goals. Each track corresponds to the nationality of a scorer. [[Sabre Dance]] by [[Aram Khachaturian]] plays whenever Mkhitaryan scores. This song became very popular in Donetsk due to Mkhitaryan scoring frequently.<ref name="SBHM" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Jonathan|title=Henrik Mkhitaryan orchestrates Shakhtar Donetsk's great leap forward|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/oct/22/henrik-mkhitaryan-shakhtar-donetsk|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 October 2012 | first = Jonathan | last = Wilson}}</ref>

Mkhitaryan has visited the [[Artsakh Republic]] three times on charity visits. On 21 December 2012, Mkhitaryan visited [[Stepanakert]] and gave gifts to the families of fallen soldiers. He later met with Artsakh President [[Bako Sahakyan]] and Deputy Defence Minister of Artsakh, president of the Football Federation of Artsakh, head of Union Veterans of the Karabakh War and Hero of Artsakh Samvel Karapetyan. They both praised the contributions of Mkhitaryan and awarded him the Order of Defender of the Fatherland.<ref>{{cite web|title=Henrikh Mkhitaryan presented gifts to the families of fallen soldiers|url=http://tigrantorosyan.edublogs.org/2013/01/15/henrikh-mkhitaryan-presented-gifts-to-the-families-of-fallen-soldiers/|publisher=tigrantorosyan.edublogs.org|accessdate=1 March 2013 | date = 15 Janaury 2013}}</ref>
