"'''Hollywood A.D.'''" is the nineteenth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]] of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on April 30, 2000. The episode is a [[List of Monster-of-the-Week characters in The X-Files|"Monster-of-the-Week"]] story, unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "Hollywood A.D." earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.7, being watched by 12.88 million people in its initial broadcast.

In this episode, an entrepreneurial Hollywood producer and college friend of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) picks up the idea for a film based on the X-Files, however special agent [[Fox Mulder]] (David Duchovny) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) find that the level of realism in their fictional portrayal is somewhat questionable. 

"Hollywood A.D." was written and directed by series star David Duchovny, his second writing and directing credit after the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] episode "[[The Unnatural (The X-Files)|The Unnatural]]." The episode<U+2014>written with a "[[Self-referential humor|self-reflexive]]" tone<U+2014>features a myriad of guest stars, including, most notably, [[Garry Shandling]] and [[T<U+00E9>a Leoni]], who portray Mulder and Scully, respectively, in the episode's fictional movie.

== Plot ==
[[Walter Skinner]]'s old college friend, [[Wayne Federman]], is making a movie about the bureau and Skinner has given him access to Mulder and Scully during his research phase. Meanwhile, they are trying to solve a case involving the attempted murder of a Cardinal O'Fallon at his church. Federman tags along and consistently interrupts the agents. In the catacombs of the church, Mulder finds the remains of Micah Hoffman, a 1960s counter-culturalist who disappeared, in the blast rubble. They search Hoffman's apartment and find bombs and counterfeiting tools as well as forged gospel of [[Mary Magdalene]]. Mulder and Federman return to the church and search the catacombs. The two find several skeletons and pieces of the forged gospel. Federman wanders off and stumbles upon animated bones, who attempt to assemble a shatter piece of pottery. He panics and leaves the scene.

Mulder and Scully examine the bowl. Scully tells Mulder the story of "The Lazarus Bowl" that she learned at her [[Catholic school]]. Purportedly, the aunt of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] had been making a clay bowl when [[Jesus Christ]] resurrected Lazarus. The words of Christ were then [[Archaeoacoustics|recorded in the grooves of the bowl]] much like a phonograph record. Mulder brings the relic to [[Charles Burks]], who, after performing a sonic analysis, discovers noises in [[Aramaic]]. The first part, roughly translated, reads "[[I am the Walrus|I am the walrus]]. I am the walrus. [[Paul is dead]]. Goo goo g'joob." Burks mentions that Aramaic doesn't actually have a word for walrus, and the pottery literally said the "bearded, cow-like sea beast." The second part is the audio of one man commanding another to rise from the dead.

Mulder visits Cardinal O'Fallon, who admits he bought the forged gospel from Hoffman, but believed it was real. Meanwhile, during the autopsy of Hoffman, the man comes back to life on the operating table, but when Scully looks down he is back on the operating table. She finishes the autopsy and finds strychnine in his system. Later at church Scully sees a vision of Hoffman again hanging on the cross in the place of Jesus. Mulder arrests Cardinal O'Fallon but Micah Hoffman walks in, unscathed. Hoffman tells Mulder and Scully that, initially, he created the forgeries to make money, but eventually, he became the reincarnation of Jesus Christ and he bombed the church to get rid of the "blasphemous" forgeries. Skinner suspends Scully and Mulder for four weeks because of the mix-up. 16 months later Cardinal O'Fallon kills Micah Hoffman and then kills himself. As such, the [[X-File]] is never truly solved.

During their suspension, Mulder and Scully venture to [[Hollywood]] to view the production of Federman's film. It is revealed that Federman's movie will be called ''The Lazarus Bowl'' and [[Gary Shandling]] will play Mulder and [[T<U+00E9>a Leoni]] will play Scully. After filming is done, Mulder and Scully watch the movie, but are thoroughly disgusted at how they and their case are portrayed on the big screen. The episode ends with dead people coming to life on the movie set and Mulder and Scully holding hands on their way presumably to dinner with the FBI credit card Skinner gave them after watching the movie, hinting at the continued romantic relationship between Mulder and Scully that has been hinted at in the last few episodes.<ref name="plot">Shapiro, pp. 229-240</ref>

===Writing and filming===
[[File:David Duchovny 2011 Shankbone.JPG|"Hollywood A.D." was written and directed by series star [[David Duchovny]].|150px|thumb|left]]
"Hollywood A.D." was written and directed by series star [[David Duchovny]]. The episode was written after Duchovny received positive feedback on his last creation, [[The X-Files (season 6)|season six's]] "[[The Unnatural (The X-Files)|The Unnatural]]."<ref name="s240"/> Duchovny originally approached [[Frank Spotnitz]] about the possibility of writing another episode.<ref name="s240"/> Spotnitz gave him the go-ahead and was soon given a rough copy of the script.<ref name="s240"/> Series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] was very happy with the story, calling it "a smart, intelligent, quirky, and intelligent idea" and he later described it as "outside the norm, even for ''The X-Files''."<ref name="s240">Shapiro, p. 240</ref> Once the script was approved, Duchovny took on an active roll in preparing for the episode.<ref name="s240"/>

There was a considerable amount of stunt work and choreographing done for "Hollywood A.D." Two stunt doubles were hired for the scene were Shandling tackles Leoni and they tumble down a hill into an open casket.<ref name="s241"/> Some of the stunt men were even cast in non-stunt related jobs.<ref name="s241"/> Several were "transformed" into [[zombies]], a process which took five hours.<ref name="s241"/> The zombie dance sequence at the end of the episode took two days to film.<ref name="s241"/> The first day was shot during active production and the second was scheduled for the [[Chroma key|blue screen]] work that was required.<ref name="s241"/>

===Casting===
Duchovny cast several of ''The X-Files''' technical crew members in the episode. Tina M. Amedrui, the show's actual craft services woman, portrayed Tina, the craft service woman for Wayne Federman's movie.<ref name="s240"/> Bill Roe, the show's photography director, was cast as the vegetarian zombie.<ref name="s240"/> Assistant director Barry K. Thomas was cast as Sugar Bear, Paul Rabwin was cast as a producer, and special effects coordinator Bill Millar was cast as the movie's director.<ref name="s240"/><ref name="s241">Shapiro, p. 241</ref> Duchovny also cast his brother, Daniel, as the assistant director.<ref name="s241"/>
 
T<U+00E9>a Leoni, who portrayed a fictionalized version of herself portraying Scully in the production, was married to David Duchovny when this episode was filmed, a decision casting director Rick Millikan considered "clever."<ref name=canada/><ref name="s241"/> Duchovny also cast his friend and fellow actor Garry Shandling as a fictionalized version of himself portraying Mulder. Shandling had originally been sought out to play the part of Morris Fletcher in the sixth season episode "[[Dreamland (The X-Files)|Dreamland]]."<ref name="m64">Meisler, p. 64</ref> The joke about Garry Shandling having a crush on Mulder came from a recurring joke from the TV show [[The Larry Sanders Show]], starring Garry Shandling.<ref name=canada/> In the recurring joke, David Duchovny has a homosexual interest in Shandling's character.<ref name=canada/>

The joke about Mulder wanting [[Richard Gere]] to appear in the movie stemmed from the fact that Duchovny's acting was often compared to Gere's.<ref name="thetruth"/> Duchovny decided to turn the idea into a joke, saying, "we used to always have the joke on set that when they do the movie it's going to be Richard Gear and [[Jodie Foster]] [playing Mulder and Scully]. So I originally wrote the teaser for Richard Gear and Jodie Foster and I just started to think about it and you know, it's so much funnier with Gary and T<U+00E9>a."<ref name="thetruth">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]], et al |date=2000 |title=The Truth Behind Season 7 |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

The episode featured several uncredited celebrity cameos. During the premiere of the movie, both [[Minnie Driver]] and [[David Alan Grier]] appear as members of the audience.<ref name="s241"/> In addition, Chris Carter, the show's creator, made cameo during the the theater scene.<ref name="s241"/> The appearance was his second in the series.<ref name="s241"/>
