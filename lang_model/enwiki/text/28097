The song went on to become Shania's seventh and to date, final number one single on the ''Billboard'' Country singles chart. "Honey, I'm Home" was included in both her [[Come on Over Tour]] and [[Up! Tour]], as well as her [[The Specials (Shania Twain DVD)|Miami, Dallas]] and [[Up! Live in Chicago|Chicago]] video specials.  No commercial single was made available for this release.

The video was directed by [[Larry Jordan]]. This was the first of three live videos taken from ''Come on Over''.
