Although benedictine is rarely seen in restaurants outside the state of Kentucky, articles written about benedictine have recently appeared in national publications such as the ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[Washington Post]]'', and ''[[Saveur|Saveur Magazine]]'', and also been reported on multimedia outlets such as the [[Food Network]] and [[NPR]].

==History==
Benedictine was invented near the beginning of the 20th century by Jennie Carter Benedict, a [[catering|caterer]], restaurateur and cookbook author in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref name="Ency2001">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Louisville |edition=1 |year=2001 |article=Benedict, Jennie Carter |pages=85<U+2013>86 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pXbYITw4ZesC&q=Jennie+Carter+Benedict#v=snippet&q=Jennie%20Carter%20Benedict&f=false |isbn=9780813128900 |editor-first=John E. |editor-last=Kleber |first=Laurie A. |last=Birnsteel |accessdate=2014-07-05}}</ref> Benedict opened a kitchen for providing catering services in 1893, and in 1900 opened a restaurant and [[tea house|tea room]] called Benedict's.<ref name="Ency2001"/>  It was probably during her catering period when she invented and originally served benedictine.<ref>{{cite news |author=Stinnett, Donna |title=Claim to fame Kentucky restaurant owner, caterer contributes |url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2008/oct/02/claim-to-fame-kentucky-restaurant-owner-caterer/ |newspaper=[[Evansville Courier & Press]] |date=October 2, 2006 |accessdate=2014-07-04}}</ref>

Benedict's cook books are still being sold a century after they were first published. For example, her ''The Blue Ribbon Cook Book'', which first published in 1902, has been reprinted numerous times and as recently as 2008.<ref name=tc-2008nov26>{{cite news |title=Storied Kentucky cookbook still has relevance today |newspaper=[[Tucson Citizen]] |date=November 26, 2008 |first=Larry |last=Cox}}</ref>  This book also contains a recipe for the spread.

==Recipe==
Following are the original benedictine recipe ingredients used by Benedict, as reported by the Louisville ''[[The Courier-Journal|Courier-Journal]]'' and [[NPR]]:<ref name="CJ2009"/><ref name=npr-20130713 />
*8 [[ounce|oz.]] cream cheese, softened
*3 [[tablespoon|tbsps.]] cucumber juice
*1 tbsp. [[onion]] juice
*1 [[teaspoon|tsp.]] [[salt]]
*A few grains of [[cayenne pepper]]
*2 drops green [[food coloring]]

The original spread is made by thoroughly blending all these ingredients with a fork.<ref name="CJ2009"/><ref name=npr-20130713 />

Modern variants of the recipe use grated or chopped cucumber and onions rather than juice, as well as [[dill]] and other ingredients commonly used to make spreads.  They also use significantly less salt.<ref name="WashPo"/><ref name=npr-20130713 />
