(Thus, there is generally no purpose in giving permission; it is better to rewrite.) 

A Wikipedia article  needs to be written like an encyclopedia article, not a press release--don't praise the person, say what he does. in plain descriptive language. First give the basic biographical information: birth year and place, education , including high school and later,  Do it as a plain narrative,l--don't try for a creative effect. 

Then talk about his work. Where the work has been published is important, but more important his group and solo exhibitions, and even more important is indication of whether his work has become part of any major permanent collection. The criteria for inclusion here are at [[WP:CREATIVE]]. The most important part of it is writings about him and his work, especially critical reviews of his exhibited or published work, in articles or books providing substantial coverage from  3rd party independent published reliable sources, print or online, but ''not'' blogs or press releases, or material derived from press releases. Gallery press releases are not acceptable. 

Then are awards. Don't just refer to them in passing. List every important award of national significance.  Don't rely on a listing of them in a contributors list in a general book--such listings tend to be compiled by the subject. Give actual sources for each award, separately 

If you include discussions of the merits or the nature of his work, these must be quoted from reliable third party sources. WP itself makes no such judgments--it just reports them. Include only material that would be of interest to a general reader coming across the mention of the subject and wanting the sort of information that would be found in an encyclopedia. Do not  think in terms of what the subject wishes to communicate to the public, but   what the public might wish to know.   |declinets=20121210040052|decliner=DGG|ts=20121207223853|u=Rayevsky|ns=5}}
