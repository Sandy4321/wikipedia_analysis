The '''National Industrial Recovery Act''' ('''NIRA'''; {{USStatute|73|90|48|195|1933|06|16}}, codified at {{USC|15|703}}), was an [[United States|American]] [[statute]] which purposed to authorize the [[President of the United States]] to regulate industry and permit [[cartel]]s and [[monopoly|monopolies]] in an attempt to stimulate economic recovery, and established a national [[public works]] program.<ref name="Schlesinger">Schlesinger, ''The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal,'' 2003.</ref><ref name="Kennedy">Kennedy, ''Freedom from Fear,'' 2001.</ref>

The legislation was enacted in June 1933 during the [[Great Depression]] as part of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] legislative program. Section 7(a) of the bill, which protected [[collective bargaining]] rights for [[trade union|unions]], proved contentious (especially in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]),<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Morris" /> but both chambers eventually passed the legislation and President Roosevelt signed the bill into law on June 16, 1933.<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="McKenna" /> The Act had two main sections (or "titles"). Title I was devoted to industrial recovery, and authorized the promulgation of industrial codes of fair competition, guaranteed trade union rights, permitted the regulation of working standards, and regulated the price of certain refined [[petroleum]] products and their transportation. Title II established the [[Public Works Administration]], outlined the projects and funding opportunities it could engage in, and funded the Act.

The Act was implemented by the [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA) and the [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA).<ref name="Kennedy" /><ref name="Himmelberg">Himmelberg, ''The Origins of the National Recovery Administration,'' 1993.</ref>  The NIRA was set to expire in June 1935, but in a major constitutional ruling the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] held Title I of the Act unconstitutional on May 27, 1935, in ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]],'' [[case citation|295 U.S. 495]] (1935).<ref name="Kennedy" /> The Act encouraged union organizing, which led to significant labor unrest.<ref name="Dubofsky">Dubofsky and Dulles, ''Labor in America: A History,'' 1999; Bernstein, ''The Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933-1941,'' 1970; Rayback, ''A History of American Labor,'' 1974.</ref> The Act had no mechanisms for handling these problems, which led [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass the [[National Labor Relations Act]] in 1935.<ref name="Bernstein">Bernstein, ''The New Deal Collective Bargaining Policy,'' 1975; Vittoz, ''New Deal Labor Policy and the American Industrial Economy,'' 1987; Gross, ''The Making of the National Labor Relations Board,'' 1974; Tomlins, ''The State and the Unions,'' 1985; Fine, ''Automobile Under the Blue Eagle,'' 1963.</ref> The Act was a major force behind a major modification of the [[False Claims Act]] criminalization of [[making false statements]].<ref name="gilliland"/>

==Background and enactment==
The [[Great Depression]] began in the [[United States]] in October 1929.<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Kennedy" /><ref name="Galbraith">Galbraith, ''The Great Crash of 1929,'' 1997.</ref> President [[Herbert Hoover]] feared that too much intervention or coercion by the government would destroy individuality and self-reliance, which he considered to be important American values, and his ''[[laissez-faire]]'' views appeared to be shared by the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Andrew W. Mellon]].<ref name="Hoover">Smith, ''The Shattered Dream: Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression,'' 1970; Barber, ''From New Era to New Deal,'' 1989; Sobel and Hyman, ''Herbert Hoover at the Onset of the Great Depression, 1929-1930,'' 1975.</ref>  Hoover organized a number of voluntary measures with businesses, encouraged state and local government responses, and accelerated federal building projects,<ref name="Hoover" /> but his policies had little or no effect on economic recovery.<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Kennedy" /><ref name="SchlesingerCrisis">Schlesinger, ''The Age of Roosevelt: Crisis of the Old Order,'' 2003.</ref> Toward the end of his term, however, Hoover supported several legislative solutions which he felt might lift the country out of the depression. The final attempt of the Hoover administration to rescue the economy was the passage of the [[Emergency Relief and Construction Act]] (which provided funds for public works programs) and the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) (which provided low-interest loans to businesses).<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Kennedy" /><ref name="Hoover" /><ref name="SchlesingerCrisis" />

Hoover was defeated for re-election by Franklin D. Roosevelt in the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election]]. Roosevelt was convinced that legislative activism was needed to reverse the country's economic decline. In his first hundred days in office, the Congress enacted at Roosevelt's request a series of bills designed to strengthen the banking system, including the [[Emergency Banking Act]], the [[Glass<U+2013>Steagall Act]] (which created the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]), and the [[1933 Banking Act]].<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Kennedy" /> The Congress also passed the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] to stabilize the nation's agricultural industry.<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Kennedy" />

===Enactment===
[[Image:1933 Time Man of the Year cover.jpg|thumb|right|Hugh S. Johnson, one of the primary authors of NIRA, was ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1933.]]
The National Industrial Recovery Act was enacted at the very end of [[New Deal#The First Hundred Days|the Hundred Days]]. [[Hugh Samuel Johnson|Hugh S. Johnson]], [[Raymond Moley]], [[Donald Richberg]], [[Rexford Tugwell]], [[Jerome Frank]], and [[Bernard Baruch]]<U+2014>key Roosevelt advisors<U+2014>believed that unrestrained competition had helped cause the Great Depression and that government had a critical role to play through national planning, limited regulation, the fostering of [[trade association]]s, support for "fair" trade practices, and support for "democratization of the workplace" (a standard work week, shorter working hours, and better working conditions).<ref name="Johnson">Johnson, ''The Blue Eagle From Egg to Earth,'' 1935.</ref><ref>Moley, ''After Seven Years,'' 1939; Vadney, ''The Wayward Liberal: A Political Biography of Donald Richberg,'' 1970; Richberg, ''My Hero: The Autobiography of Donald Richberg,'' 1954; Sternsher, ''Rexford Tugwell and the New Deal,'' 1964.</ref> Roosevelt himself, the former head of a trade association, believed that government promotion of "self-organization" by trade associations was the least-intrusive and yet most effective method for achieving national planning and economic improvement.<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="McKenna" /> Some work on an industrial relief bill had been done in the weeks following Roosevelt's election, but much of this was in the nature of talk and the exchange of ideas rather than legislative research and drafting.<ref name="Phillips">Phillips and Mitgang, ''From the Crash to the Blitz, 1929-1939,'' 2000.</ref> The administration, preoccupied with banking and agriculture legislation, did not begin working on industrial relief legislation until early April 1933.<ref name="McKenna">McKenna, ''Franklin Roosevelt and the Great Constitutional War,'' 2002.</ref><ref name="Phillips" /><ref name="Houck">Houck, ''Rhetoric As Currency: Hoover, Roosevelt, and the Great Depression,'' 2001.</ref> Congress, however, was moving on its own industrial legislation. In the Senate, [[Robert F. Wagner]], [[Edward P. Costigan]], and [[Robert M. La Follette, Jr.]] were promoting [[public works]] legislation, and [[Hugo Black]] was pushing short-work-week legislation.<ref name="Phillips" /><ref name="Houck" /> Motivated to work on his own industrial relief bill by these efforts, Roosevelt ordered Moley to work with these Senators (and anyone else in government who seemed interested) to craft a bill.<ref name="Phillips" /><ref name="Houck" />

By May 1933, two draft bills had emerged, a cautious and legalistic one by John Dickinson ([[United States Department of Commerce|Under Secretary of Commerce]]) and an ambitious one focusing on trade associations by Hugh Johnson.<ref name="McKenna" /><ref name="Phillips" /> Many leading businessmen<U+2014>including [[Gerard Swope]] (head of [[General Electric]]), [[Charles M. Schwab]] (chairman of [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]]), [[E. H. Harriman]] (chairman of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]), and [[Henry I. Harriman]], president of the [[United States Chamber of Commerce|U.S. Chamber of Commerce]]<U+2014>helped draft the legislation.<ref name="Kennedy" /><ref name="Phillips" /> A two-part bill, the first section promoting cooperative action among business to achieve fair competition and provide for national planning and a second establishing a national public works program, was submitted to Congress on May 15, 1933, after Roosevelt himself reconciled differences between the two competing bills.<ref name="McKenna" /><ref name="Phillips" /><ref name="Houck" />

The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] easily passed the bill in just seven days.<ref name="McKenna" /><ref name="Phillips" /> The most contentious issue was the inclusion of Section 7(a), which protected [[collective bargaining]] rights for [[trade union|unions]].<ref name="Morris">Morris, ''The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights In The American Workplace,'' 2004.</ref> Section 7(a) had nearly not made it into the bill, but Senator Wagner, Jerome Frank, and [[Leon Keyserling]] (another Roosevelt aide) worked to retain the section in order to win the support of the American labor movement.<ref name="Schlesinger" />

The bill had a more difficult time in the Senate. The [[National Association of Manufacturers]], Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist [[Henry Ford]] all opposed its passage.<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Best">Best, ''Pride, Prejudice, and Politics: Roosevelt Versus Recovery, 1933-1938,'' 1991.</ref> Senator [[Bennett Champ Clark]] introduced an amendment to emasculate Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator [[George W. Norris]] led the successful opposition to the change.<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Morris" /> The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of [[Competition law|antitrust law]]. Senators [[William Edgar Borah|William E. Borah]], [[Burton K. Wheeler]], and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], arguing that this would exacerbate existing severe [[economic inequality]] and concentrate wealth in the hands of the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression).<ref name="McKenna" /><ref name="Galbraith" /><ref name="Gould">Gould, ''The Most Exclusive Club: A History of the Modern United States Senate,'' 2006.</ref><ref>"Borah Debates With Wagner." ''Associated Press.'' June 8, 1933.</ref> Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion of codes of fair trade practices would help create progressive standards for wages, hours, and working conditions, and eliminate sweatshops and child labor.<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Gould" /> The Senate passed the amended legislation 57-to-24 on June 9.<ref>"Income Publicity Voted." ''New York Times.'' June 10, 1933.</ref>

A [[United States congressional conference committee|House-Senate conference committee]] met throughout the evening of June 9 and all day June 10 to reconcile the two versions of the bill, approving a final version on the afternoon of June 10. The House approved the conference committee's bill on the evening of June 10.<ref>"Recess Taken to Monday." ''New York Times.''

==Structure of the Act==
The National Industrial Recovery Act had two major titles.

Title I was devoted to industrial recovery.  Title I, Section 2 empowered the President to establish executive branch agencies to carry out the purposes of the Act, and provided for a [[sunset provision]] nullifying the Act in two years.<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 2.</ref> The heart of the Act was Title I, Section 3, which permitted trade or industrial associations to seek presidential approval of codes of fair competition (so long as such codes did not promote monopolies or provide unfair competition against small businesses) and provided for enforcement of these codes.<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 3.</ref> Title I, Section 5 exempted the codes from the federal antitrust laws.<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 5.</ref>

Title I, Section 7(a) guaranteed the right of workers to form unions and banned [[yellow-dog contract]]s:
<blockquote>...employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and shall be free from the interference restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection; <nowiki>[and]</nowiki> (2) that no employee and no one seeking employment shall be required as a condition of employment to join any company union or to refrain from joining, organizing, or assisting a labor organization of his own choosing... .<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 7(a).</ref></blockquote>

Title I, Section 7(b) permitted the establishment of standards regarding maximum hours of labor, minimum rates of pay, and working conditions in the industries covered by the codes, while Section 7(c) authorized the President to impose such standards on codes when voluntary agreement could not be reached.<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 7(b).</ref>

Title I, Section 9 authorized the regulation of oil pipelines and prices for the transportation of all petroleum products by pipeline.<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 9(a).</ref> Section 9(b) permitted the executive to take over any oil pipeline company, subsidiary, or business if the parent company was found in violation of the Act.<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 9(b).</ref>

Title II established the Public Works Administration.  Title II, Section 201 established the agency and provided for a two-year sunset provision.<ref>Sections in Title I of the NIRA are numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.  However, in a discrepancy, sections in Title II and III of the NIRA are numbered 201, 202, 203, etc. and 301, 302, 303, etc.  ''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title II, Sec. 201.</ref> Section 202 outlines the types of public works which the new agency may seek to fund or build.<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title II, Sec. 202.</ref> Title II, Section 203 authorized the Public Works Administration to provide grants and/or loans to states and localities in order to more rapidly reduce unemployment as well as to use the power of [[eminent domain]] to seize land or materials to engage in public works.<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title II, Sec. 203.</ref>  Title II, Section 204 explicitly provided $400 million for the construction of public highways, bridges, roads, railroad crossings, paths, and other transportation projects.<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title II, Sec. 204.</ref>

Title II, Section 208 authorized the president to expend up to $25 million to purchase farms for the purpose of relocating individuals living in overcrowded urban areas (such as cities) to these farms and allowing them to raise crops and earn a living there.<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title II, Sec. 208.</ref>

Title II, Sections 210-219 provided for revenues to fund the Act, and Section 220 appropriated money for the Act's implementation.<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title II, Sec. 210-220.</ref>

Title III of the Act contained miscellaneous provisions, and transferred the authority to engage in public works from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to the Public Works Administration.<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title III.</ref>

==Implementation==
[[Image:NewDealNRA.jpg|thumb|right|NRA [[Blue Eagle]] poster, the image most commonly associated with the NIRA.]]
{{main|National Recovery Administration}}
{{main|Public Works Administration}}
Implementation of the Act began immediately.  Hugh Johnson spent most of May and June planning for implementation, and the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was established on June 20, 1933<U+2014>a scant four days after the law's enactment.<ref name="Schlesinger" /> Roosevelt angered Johnson by having him administer only the NRA, while the Public Works Administration (PWA) went to [[Harold L. Ickes]].<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Kennedy" /><ref name="Clarke">Clarke, ''Roosevelt's Warrior: Harold L. Ickes and the New Deal,'' 2006.</ref> NRA and PWA reported to different cabinet agencies, making coordination difficult, and PWA money flowed so slowly into the economy that NRA proved to be the more important agency by far.<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Johnson" />

The premiere symbol of the NIRA was the [[Blue Eagle]].<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Himmelberg" /><ref name="Johnson" />

NIRA, as implemented by the NRA, became notorious for generating large numbers of regulations. The agency approved 557 basic and 189 supplemental industry codes in two years.<ref name="Eisner">Eisner, ''Regulatory Politics in Transition,'' 2000.</ref> Between 4,000 and 5,000 business practices were prohibited, some 3,000 administrative orders running to over 10,000 pages promulgated, and thousands of opinions and guides from national, regional, and local code boards interpreted and enforced the Act.<ref name="Best" /> The backlash against the Act was so significant that it generated a large loss of political support for the New Deal and turned a number of Roosevelt's closest aides against him.<ref name="Kennedy" /> Roosevelt himself shifted his views on the best way to achieve economic recovery, and began a new legislative program (known as the "Second New Deal") in 1935.<ref name="Backlash">Schlesinger, ''The Age of Roosevelt, Vol. 3: The Politics of Upheaval, 1935-1936,'' 2003; Brinkley, ''The End Of Reform: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War,'' 1996; Venn, ''The New Deal,'' 1999; Shogan, ''Backlash: The Killing of the New Deal,'' 2006.</ref>

Implementation of Section 7(a) of the NIRA proved immensely problematical as well.  The protections of the Act led to a massive wave of union organizing punctuated by employer and union violence, [[general strike]]s, and [[recognition strike]]s.<ref name="Dubofsky" /> At the outset, NRA Administrator Hugh Johnson na<U+00EF>vely believed that Section 7(a) would be self-enforcing, but he quickly learned otherwise and the [[National Labor Board]] was established under the auspices of the NRA to implement the collective bargaining provisions of the Act.<ref name="Morris" /><ref name="Bernstein" /> The National Labor Board, too, proved to be ineffective, and on July 5, 1935, a new law<U+2014>the [[National Labor Relations Act]]<U+2014>superseded the NIRA and established a new, long-lasting federal labor policy.<ref name="Bernstein" />

The leadership of the Public Works Authority was torn over the new agency's mission. PWA could initiate its own construction projects, distribute money to other federal agencies to fund their construction projects, or make loans to states and localities to fund their construction projects.<ref name="Schlesinger" /> But many in the Roosevelt administration felt PWA should not spend money, for fear of worsening the federal deficit, and so funds flowed slowly.<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Kennedy" /> Furthermore, the very nature of construction (planning, specifications, and blueprints) also held up the disbursement of money. Harold Ickes, too, was determined to ensure that graft and corruption did not tarnish the agency's reputation and lead to loss of political support in Congress, and so moved cautiously in spending the agency's money.<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Kennedy" /><ref name="Clarke" /> Although the U.S. Supreme Court would rule Title I of NIRA unconstitutional, the [[severability]] clause in the Act enabled the PWA to survive. Among the projects it funded between 1935 and 1939 are:  the ''[[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|USS Yorktown]]''; ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS Enterprise]]''; the [[30th Street Station|30th Street]] [[train station|railroad station]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]; the [[Triborough Bridge]]; the [[Brownsville, Texas|port of Brownsville]]; [[Grand Coulee Dam]]; [[Hoover Dam|Boulder Dam]]; [[Fort Peck Dam]]; [[Bonneville Dam]]; and the [[Overseas Highway]] connecting [[Key West]], [[Florida]], with the mainland.<ref name="Schlesinger" /> The agency survived until 1943, when the [[Reorganization Act of 1939]] consolidated most federal public works and work relief functions of the federal government into the new [[Federal Works Agency]].<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16423 "Executive Order 9357 - Transferring the Functions of the Public Works Administration to the Federal Works Agency."

''Historical Dictionary of the Great Depression, 1929-1940.'' Santa Barbara, Calif.: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001. ISBN 0313306184</ref>

President Roosevelt sought reauthorization of NIRA on February 20, 1935.<ref name="Schlesinger" /> But the backlash against the New Deal, coupled with continuing congressional concern over the Act's suspension of antitrust law, left the President's request politically dead.<ref name="Kennedy" /><ref name="Best" /><ref name="Backlash" /> By May 1935, the issue was moot as the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] had ruled Title I of NIRA unconstitutional.

==Legal challenge and nullification==
{{main|Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States}}
On April 13, 1934, the President had approved the "Code of Fair Competition for the Live Poultry Industry of the Metropolitan Area in and about the City of New York."<ref>''Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,'' 295 U.S. 495, 555, fn. 5.</ref> The goal of the code was to ensure that live poultry (provided to [[kosher]] slaughterhouses for butchering and sale to observant [[Jew]]s) were fit for human consumption and to prevent the submission of false sales and price reports.<ref name="Kennedy" /> The industry was almost entirely centered on [[New York City]].<ref name="Schlesinger" /> Under the new poultry code, the Schechter brothers were indicted on 60 counts (of which 27 were dismissed by the trial court), acquitted on 14, and convicted in 19.<ref>''Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,'' 295 U.S. 495, 555, fn. 2.</ref> One of the counts on which they were convicted was for selling a diseased bird, leading Hugh Johnson to jokingly call the suit the "sick chicken case".<ref name="Johnson" />

[[Image:Charles-E-Hughes.jpg|thumb|left|Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Charles Evans Hughes.]]
A number of court challenges to the NIRA were winding their way through the courts. Although Roosevelt, most of his aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff felt the Act would survive a court test, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] had on March 25, 1935, declined to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code on the grounds that the case was not a good test of the NIRA's constitutionality.<ref name="Schlesinger" /> The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the ''Schechter'' case.<ref name="Schlesinger" /> Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in ''Schechter'' was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.<ref name="Schlesinger" />

On May 27, 1935, [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Charles Evans Hughes]] wrote for a unanimous Court in ''Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States'' 295 U.S. 495 (1935) that Title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act was unconstitutional. First, Hughes concluded that the law was [[void for vagueness]] because the critical term "fair competition"<ref>''National Industrial Recovery Act,'' Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 3(a) reads: "Upon the application to the President by one or more trade or industrial associations or groups, the President may approve a code or codes of fair competition for the trade or industry or subdivision thereof..."</ref> was nowhere defined in the Act.<ref>''Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,'' 295 U.S. 495, 531.</ref> Second, Hughes found the Act's delegation of authority to the executive branch [[nondelegation doctrine|unconstitutionally overbroad]]:
<blockquote>To summarize and conclude upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe rules of conduct to be applied to particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and of the nature of the few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.<ref>''Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,'' 295 U.S. 495, 541-542.</ref></blockquote>
Finally, in a very restrictive reading of what constituted interstate commerce,<ref name="Ross">Ross, ''The Chief Justiceship of Charles Evans Hughes, 1930-1941,'' 2007.</ref> Hughes held that the "'current' or 'flow'" of commerce involved was simply too minute to constitute interstate commerce, and subsequently Congress had no power under the [[Commerce Clause]] to enact legislation affecting such commercial transactions.<ref>''Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,'' 295 U.S. 495, 542-548.</ref> The Court dismissed with a bare paragraph the government's ability to regulate wages and hours.<ref>''Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,'' 295 U.S. 495, 548-550.</ref> Although the government had argued that the national economic emergency required special consideration, Hughes disagreed. The dire economic circumstances the country faced did not justify the overbroad delegation or overreach of the Act, the majority concluded. "Extraordinary conditions may call for extraordinary remedies. But the argument necessarily stops short of an attempt to justify action which lies outside the sphere of constitutional authority. Extraordinary conditions do not create or enlarge constitutional power."<ref>''Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,'' 295 U.S. 495, 528.</ref>

Although the decision emasculated NIRA, it had little practical impact, as Congress was unlikely to have reauthorized the Act in any case.<ref name="Ross" /><ref>As of 2007, ''Schechter Poultry'' and ''Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan,'' [[case citation|293 U.S. 388]] (1935), are the only cases in which the Supreme Court has struck down an act of Congress for overbroad delegation of legislative authority. See: Ross, ''The Chief Justiceship of Charles Evans Hughes, 1930-1941,'' 2007.</ref>

==Criticism==
A key criticism of the Act at the time as well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with that type of [[market failure]].<ref name="Eisner" /><ref name="Bellush">Bellush, ''The Failure of the NRA,'' l975.</ref><ref name="ReviewBoard">National Recovery Review Board, ''Report to the President of the United States,'' First report, May 21, 1934.</ref><ref name="Cole">{{cite news |first1=Harold L. |last1=Cole |first2=Lee E. |last2=Ohanian |authorlink2=Lee E.

A second key criticism of the Act is that it lacked support from the business community, and thus was doomed to failure.<ref name="Paulsen">Paulsen, "The Federal Trade Commission v. the National Recovery Administration, 1935," ''Social Science Quarterly,'' March 1989.</ref> Business support for national planning and government intervention was very strong in 1933, but had collapsed by mid-1934.<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Kennedy" /><ref name="Eisner" /> Many studies conclude, however, that business support for NIRA was never uniform. Larger, older businesses embraced the legislation while smaller, newer ones (more nimble in a highly competitive market and with less capital investment to lose if they failed) did not.<ref name="Eisner" /><ref>Galambos, ''Competition and Cooperation: The Emergence of a National Trade Association,'' 1966{{Page needed|date=August 2011}}; {{cite journal |jstor=3113736 |pages=369<U+2013>391 |last1=Collins |first1=R.

A third major criticism of the Act is that it was poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, big business and small business, etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation.<ref name="Eisner" /><ref name="Krepps" /> As a consequence, NRA collapsed due to failure of leadership and confusion about its goals.<ref name="Paulsen" /> By end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies<U+2014>contributing to the collapse of almost all industry codes.<ref name="Horwitz">Horwitz, ''The Irony of Regulatory Reform: The Deregulation of American Telecommunications,'' 1989.{{Page needed|date=August 2011}}</ref>

There are a wide range of additional critiques as well. One is that NIRA's industry codes interfered with capital markets, inhibiting economic recovery.<ref>Lyon, et al., ''The National Recovery Administration: An Analysis and Appraisal,'' 1935.</ref> But more recent analyses conclude that NIRA had little effect on capital markets one way or the other.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1005054019819 |year=2000 |last1=Anderson |first1=William L. |journal=Public Choice |volume=103 |pages=139<U+2013>161}}</ref> Another is that political uncertainty created by the NRA caused a drop in business confidence, inhibiting recovery.<ref>Bernstein, ''The Great Depression: Delayed Recovery and Economic Change in America, 1929-1939,'' 1989.</ref> But at least one study has shown no effect whatsoever.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=2121886 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700035166 |title=Political Shocks and Investment: Some Evidence from the 1930s |year=2009 |last1=Mayer |first1=Thomas |last2=Chatterji |first2=Monojit |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=913}}</ref>

As noted above, Section 7(a) led to significant increases in union organizing, as intended by the Act. But the enforcement of Section 7(a) and its legal limitations led to clear failures. Although Section 7(a) was not affected by the Supreme Court's decision in ''Schechter Poultry,'' the failure of the section led directly to passage of the National Labor Relations Act in July 1935.

==Legacy==
In 1934, at the request of the Secretary Ickes, who wished to use the statute criminalizing [[making false statements]] to enforce Section 9(c) of the NIRA against producers of "hot oil", oil produced in violation of production restrictions established pursuant to the NIRA, Congress passed {{USStatute|73|394|48|996|1934|06|18}}, which amended the [[False Claims Act]] of 1863 to read:<ref name="gilliland">{{cite court | litigants= [[:wikisource:United States v. Gilliland|United States v. Gilliland]] | vol= 312 | reporter= US | opinion= 86 | pinpoint= 93-94 | date= 1941 | quote= Legislation had been sought by the Secretary of the Interior to aid the enforcement of laws relating to the functions of the Department of the Interior and, in particular, to the enforcement of regulations under Sec. 9(c) of the [NIRA].}}</ref>
