==Career==
[[File:TimHetheringtonCamera2002.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hetherington at a photo session in [[Huambo]], Angola, in 2002.]]
Hetherington's first job was that of a trainee at ''[[The Big Issue]]'', in [[London]], where he was the sole staff photographer.<ref name="bigissue" />

Hetherington spent much of the next decade in [[West Africa]], documenting political upheaval and its effects on daily life in [[Liberia]], [[Sierra Leone]],<ref name="Tel">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8464433/Libya-British-photographer-killed-in-Misurata.html "Libya: British Photographer Killed in Misurata"].  ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.</ref> [[Nigeria]], and other countries. In the [[Second Liberian Civil War]], he and his broadcast colleague [[James Brabazon]] were the only foreign journalists to live behind rebel lines, which earned them an execution order from then-[[President of Liberia|Liberian President]] [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]]. Hetherington was a photographer on ''Liberia: An Uncivil War'' (2004) and ''[[The Devil Came on Horseback]]'' (2007).

Hetherington won the 2007 [[World Press Photo]] competition for his picture of a tired American soldier covering his face with his hand following a day of fighting in the [[Korengal valley]], [[Afghanistan]]. The work was made for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', for which he was a contributing photographer.<ref>[http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/bios/tim_hetherington/search?contributorName=Tim%20Hetherington Contributing Photographer: Tim Hetherington]".

[[File:TimHetherington2002.jpg|thumb|upright|Hetherington at a photo session in Huambo, Angola, in 2002.]]
In 2006, Hetherington took a break from image making to work as an investigator for the [[United Nations Security Council]]'s Liberia Sanctions Committee.

Hetherington received a 2009 [[Alfred I. duPont Award]] in broadcast journalism,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://programs.corcoran.org/products/tim-hetherington-infidel | title = Corcoran&nbsp;&ndash; Tim Hetherington: Infidel |publisher = [[Programs.corcoran.org]] | date = | accessdate = 1 December 2010}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> and the 2008 [[Rory Peck Award|Rory Peck Features award]] for his broadcast work titled ''Afghanistan&nbsp;&ndash; The Other War'', which was also made in the Korengal Valley and aired on ''[[Nightline]]'', a program of [[ABC News]].

==Death==
Hetherington was killed while covering the front lines in the besieged city of [[Misrata]], [[Libya]]. There appears to be uncertainty whether he was killed by a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar shell]]<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1378976/British-photgrapher-Tim-Hetherington-killed-Misrata-Gaddafi-troops.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | title = Oscar-Nominated War Photographer Tim Hetherington Killed in Libya Mortar Attack by Gaddafi's Troops | work = [[Daily Mail]] | date = 21 April 2011 | accessdate = 21 April 2011}}</ref> or an [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/04/20/libya.journalists/index.html?hpt=C1 | title = Two Photographers Killed in Libya | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = 21 April 2011 | accessdate = 21 April 2011}}</ref> round.

==Legacy==
Just days after Hetherington's death in Misrata, the Libyan city of [[Ajdabiya]] renamed its largest square after him. Anti-Gaddafi protesters also held a march to the newly rechristened Tim Hetherington Square in his honor. "We have named the square after this hero and I now consider Tim as one of our martyrs," [[Al Jazeera]] quoted a Libyan surgeon in the city as saying.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://blogs.aljazeera.net/africa/2011/04/22/ajdabiya-honours-fallen-british-photojournalist | publisher = [[Al Jazeera]] | author = Turton, Sue | date = 22 April 2011 | accessdate = 23 April 2011 | title = Ajdabiya Honours Fallen British Photojournalist}}</ref>
