[[File:Titan atmosphere detail narrow.svg|thumb|upright=1|A graph detailing temperature, pressure, and other aspects of Titan's climate. The atmospheric haze lowers the temperature in the lower atmosphere, while methane raises the temperature at the surface. Cryovolcanoes erupt [[methane]] into the atmosphere, which then rains down onto the surface, forming lakes.]]

The '''climate of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]''', the largest moon of [[Saturn]], is similar in many respects to that of [[Earth]], despite having a far lower surface temperature. Its thick atmosphere, [[methane]] rain, and possible [[cryovolcanism]] create an analogue, though with different materials, to the climatic changes undergone by Earth during its far shorter year. 

==Overview==
Titan's surface temperature is about 94&nbsp;K (<U+2212>179&nbsp;<U+00B0>C, or <U+2212>290&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). At this temperature water ice has an extremely low vapor pressure, so the atmosphere is nearly free of water vapor. The [[haze]] in Titan's atmosphere contributes to the moon's [[anti-greenhouse effect]] by reflecting sunlight back into space, making its surface significantly colder than its upper atmosphere.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.11538492|author=C.P.

Simulations of global wind patterns based on wind speed data taken by ''Huygens'' during its descent have suggested that Titan's atmosphere circulates in a single enormous [[Hadley cell]]. Warm air rises in Titan's southern hemisphere<U+2014>which was experiencing summer during ''Huygens''' descent<U+2014>and sinks in the northern hemisphere, resulting in high-altitude air flow from south to north and low-altitude airflow from north to south. Such a large Hadley cell is only possible on a slowly rotating world such as Titan.<ref name="Titan wind"/> The pole-to-pole wind circulation cell appears to be centered on the stratosphere; simulations suggest it ought to change every twelve years, with a three-year transition period, over the course of Titan's year (30 terrestrial years).<ref name=Rannou2006>{{cite journal |last=Rannou |first=R. |year=2006 |title= The Latitudinal Distribution of Clouds on Titan|journal= [[Science Magazine|Science]] |volume=311 |issue=5758 |pages=201<U+2013>205 |doi=10.1126/science.1118424 |pmid= 16410519 |last2=Montmessin |first2=F |last3=Hourdin |first3=F |last4=Lebonnois |first4=S|bibcode = 2006Sci...311..201R}}</ref> This cell creates a global band of low pressure<U+2014>what is in effect a variation of Earth's [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ). Unlike on Earth, however, where the oceans confine the ITCZ to the tropics, on Titan, the zone wanders from one pole to the other, taking methane rainclouds with it. This means that Titan, despite its frigid temperatures, can be said to have a tropical climate.<ref name=pierrehumbert>{{cite web|title=Tropical Titan|work=astrobio.net|year=2007|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article2485.html|accessdate=2007-10-16|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011160212/http://astrobio.net/news/article2485.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007}}</ref>

The number of methane lakes visible near Titan's southern pole is decidedly smaller than the number observed near the north pole. As the south pole is currently in summer and the north in winter, an emerging hypothesis is that methane rains onto the poles in winter and evaporates in summer.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA Cassini File: Radar Images Titan's South Pole|work=JPL|year=2008|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=26627|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref>
[[File:titanvortex.gif|thumb|A rotating vortex above Titan's south pole]]
In June 2012, Cassini imaged a rotating vortex on Titan's southern pole, which the imaging team believe is related to a "polar hood" - an area of dense, high altitude haze seen over the northern pole since the probe's arrival in 2004. As the hemispheres are now switching seasons since the 2009 equinox, with the southern pole entering winter and the north entering summer, it is hypothesised that this vortex could mark the formation of a new, southern polar hood.<ref>{{cite web|title=The South Polar Vortex in Motion|year=2012|author=Cassini Imaging Team|url=http://www.ciclops.org/view.php?id=7236|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref><ref> {{cite news | title = Huge vortex spied on Saturn moon | date = 11 July 2012 | publisher = BBC News | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18797414 | work = NASA | accessdate = 2012-07-11}}</ref>

==Clouds==
[[File:Vortex on saturn's moon titan.png|thumb|South pole vortex detail|right|text-top]]

[[File:Titancloud.jpg|thumb|A cloud system imaged in false color over Titan's north polar region]]
In September 2006, ''Cassini'' imaged a large cloud at a height of 40&nbsp;km over Titan's north pole. Although methane is known to condense in Titan's atmosphere, the cloud was more likely to be ethane, as the detected size of the particles was only 1<U+2013>3 [[micrometre|micrometers]] and ethane can also freeze at these altitudes. In December, ''Cassini'' again observed cloud cover and detected methane, ethane and other organics. The cloud was over 2400&nbsp;km in diameter and was still visible during a following flyby a month later. One hypothesis is that it is currently raining (or, if cool enough, snowing) on the north pole; the downdrafts at high northern latitudes are strong enough to drive organic particles towards the surface. These were the strongest evidence yet for the long-hypothesized "methanological" cycle (analogous to Earth's [[hydrological cycle]]) on Titan.<ref name=nasagov />

Clouds have also been found over the south polar region. While typically covering 1% of Titan's disk, outburst events have been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands to as much as 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened [[insolation|levels of sunlight]] during the Titanian summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in [[convection]]. This explanation is complicated by the fact that cloud formation has been observed not only post<U+2013>summer solstice but also at mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Emily L. |first=Schaller |coauthors=Brouwn, Michael E.; Roe, Henry G.

Research models that match well with observations suggest that clouds on Titan cluster at preferred coordinates and that cloud cover varies by distance from the surface on different parts of the satellite. In the polar regions (above 60 degrees [[latitude]]), widespread and permanent ethane clouds appear in and above the troposphere; at lower latitudes, mainly methane clouds are found between 15 and 18&nbsp;km, and are more sporadic and localized. In the summer hemisphere, frequent, thick but sporadic methane clouds seem to cluster around 40<U+00B0>.<ref name=Rannou2006/>

Ground-based observations also reveal seasonal variations in cloud cover. Over the course of Saturn's 30-year orbit, Titan's cloud systems appear to manifest for 25 years, and then fade for four to five years before reappearing again.<ref name=nasagov>{{cite web|title=Cassini Images Mammoth Cloud Engulfing Titan's North Pole|work=NASA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20070201.html|year=2007|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>

Cassini has also detected high-altitude, white, [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]]-type clouds in Titan's upper atmosphere, likely formed of methane.<ref>{{cite web|title=Earth-like Cirrus Clouds Found on Titan|author=Nancy Atkinson|publisher=Universe Today|url=http://www.universetoday.com/83095/earth-like-cirrus-clouds-found-on-titan/|accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>

Although no evidence of lightning activity has yet been observed on Titan, computer models suggest that clouds in the moon's lower troposphere can accumulate enough charge to generate lightning from an altitude of roughly 20&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|title=Titan's Thunder Could Point to Alien Lightning|author=Denise Chow|publisher=space.com|url=http://www.space.com/8381-titan-thunder-point-alien-lightning.html|accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>
