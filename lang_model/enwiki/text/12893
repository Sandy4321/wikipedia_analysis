'''''Iris''''' (<U+C544><U+C774><U+B9AC><U+C2A4>) is a [[South Korea|South Korean]] [[espionage]] television drama series broadcast by [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] in 2009. With a budget in excess of 20 billion [[Korean won|won]] ($17 million [[United States dollar|USD]]), it is the most expensive Korean drama ever produced.<ref>{{cite news | author=Jonathan M.

Premiering in October 2009, the series was a critical and commercial success, with an average viewership of over 30% in addition to ranking as the top program consistently every week after its debut.<ref>{{ko icon}} {{cite news | author=<U+C774><U+C7AC><U+D658> | url=http://www.newsen.com/news_view.php?uid=200912110715231001 | title= <U+2018><U+C544><U+C774><U+B9AC><U+C2A4><U+2019> 35.7% 12<U+D68C><U+C5F0><U+C18D> 30%<U+B300>, <U+CD5C><U+C2B9><U+D76C><U+B3C4> IRIS? | work=Newsen | date=2009-12-11 | accessdate=2010-04-21}}</ref> The series also took home many of the highest honors at the 2009 [[KBS Drama Acting Awards]], including [[Lee Byung-hun]] winning the top recognition in the form of the Daesang Award. Among other nominations and recognitions, Lee and [[Kim Tae-hee]] were also named as one of the best on-screen couples.

The plot revolves around two friends from the [[707th Special Mission Battalion]] recruited into a secret South Korean [[black ops]] agency known as the National Security Service. Of the pair, recruit Kim Hyun-jun begins to uncover evidence that his foggy past may not be so irrelevant to his joining of the secret organization after all. As the two friends find their loyalties tested and forge new, unlikely alliances, the journey takes them from their home country to [[Hungary]], [[Japan]], and [[China]] where they find themselves at the center of an international conspiracy.

The success of the series has led to a feature film and a 2010 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] titled ''[[Athena: Goddess of War]]''. A sequel series is set to follow in 2011.

==Synopsis==
Lifelong friends Kim Hyun-Jun ([[Lee Byung-hun]]) and Jin Sa-woo ([[Jung Joon-ho]]), two Special Forces soldiers under the [[South Korean army]]'s 707th Special Mission Battalion, each independently come into contact with an alluring woman by the name of Choi Seung-hee ([[Kim Tae-hee]]). The pair do not at first realize they have fallen for the same woman and continue to aim for her affections. Soon afterward, they are ushered from their military base to a secret compound in the middle of the night.

There, they are subjected to extensive torture as a means of gauging their worth under the most extreme of conditions. After successfully completing the test, Hyun-jun and Sa-woo are introduced to the standing head of the National Security Service, Baek San ([[Kim Yeong-cheol]]). The director informs them that the NSS is a secret organization tasked with preempting foreign threats and protecting the country's interests through [[covert operation|wetwork operations]] including assassination of anyone who could be a threat to South Korean national security. Since its founding in 1976 during the rule of [[Park Chung-hee]], the agency's very existence has remained a state secret from everyone, including the President.

Upon being initiated into the NSS, the pair learn individually that they had been headhunted by Seung-hee. Stirred by her deceit, Hyun-jun compliments her skills as an actress, while Sa-woo takes the news less bitterly. Still unaware that they share affection for the same woman, the two quickly prove themselves as capable agents within the NSS.

After taking on an unofficial assignment and foiling an assassination attempt on the leading presidential candidate, Hyun-jun and Sa-woo are invited to the [[Blue House]]. There, Hyun-jun experiences [[d<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> vu]], believing that he had stood in that very spot many years earlier.

Meanwhile, an elite assassin ([[T.O.P (entertainer)|T.O.P]]) appears at a high-rise hotel in Shanghai to eliminate a figure of political importance. After his bodyguards are disposed of, the man is killed and the assassin mentions his intention to move to the next and final target: Hong Seung-ryong, a defector from North Korea and the scientist heading their [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction#Nuclear weapons|nuclear arms program]].

As their personal relationships develop in unexpected ways, Hyun-jun, Sa-woo, and Seung-hee are soon sent to [[Budapest]] to secure Hong Seung-ryong while the Blue House decides whether to grant him asylum. Despite interference, they manage to deliver the defector to fellow agents tasked with escorting him to the South.

While their handover of Hong goes unheeded, a grand conspiracy begins to unravel at the hands of a far-reaching villain. As political tensions mount, Hyun-jun is given an independent assignment that will alter the course of history and change his life forever.

==Cast==
''Iris'' featured an ensemble cast split between characters of [[North Korea|North Korean]] and [[South Korea|South Korean]] descent. Because the series explores the tension and mentality behind the two sides of the conflict, both the North and South perspectives are shown at length. The plot focuses on the cast overcoming the manipulation they face at an international level and occasionally attempting to reconcile their differences to fight an evil greater than either side ever acknowledged, making way for scenarios in which their allegiances are stressed and put to the test.

[[File:Main cast of Iris.png|280px|right|thumb|The main cast of ''Iris'', clockwise from top left: [[Lee Byung-hun]], [[Kim Tae-hee]], [[Jung Joon-ho]], [[T.O.P (entertainer)|T.O.P]], [[Kim Seung-woo]], and [[Kim So-yeon]]. The cast won numerous awards for their contributions to the series.]]
* [[Lee Byung-hun]] as Kim Hyun-jun  {{flagicon|South Korea}}
:A soldier with the South Korean Special Forces, Hyun-jun has floated through life with little attention for the details. Possessing a [[photographic memory]], top athletic ability, and proficiency with most firearms, he has little difficulty distinguishing himself as a member of the NSS. Assuming the codename "TK1" during operations, he is frequently paired with his friend and colleague Jin Sa-woo.
* [[Kim Tae-hee]] as Choi Seung-hee  {{flagicon|South Korea}}
:Ranked as a "Team Leader" within the NSS, Seung-hee is an expert profiler that assisted Deputy Director Park Sang-hyun with recruiting Hyun-jun and, more directly, Jin Sa-woo. Admired for her beauty and perspicacity, Seung-hee is universally liked within the organization and remains very close with fellow NSS member Yang Jung-in.
* [[Jung Joon-ho]] as Jin Sa-woo  {{flagicon|South Korea}}
:A friend that has grown up alongside Hyun-jun, Sa-woo is the more level-headed and responsible of the two. While members of the Special Forces, they often found themselves in fierce competitions, and after joining the NSS, find themselves competing for the affection of Choi Seung-hee. In accordance with Hyun-jun's codename, he becomes known as "TK2".
* [[Kim Seung-woo]] as Park Cheol-young  {{flagicon|North Korea}}
:A seasoned and steadfast supporter of the [[Workers' Party of Korea|WPK]], Park Cheol-young is the head of the North Korean security team responsible for escorting and protecting heads of state on diplomatic missions. He first encounters Kim Hyun-jun as they are caught in a political impasse in Hungary<U+2014>one that leaves Park and his entire team at the mercy of their superiors should they not resolve the situation quickly in their favor.
* [[Kim So-yeon]] as Kim Seon-hwa  {{flagicon|North Korea}}
:Despite being one of very few females to achieve her status, Kim Seon-hwa has gained the trust and acknowledgment of her colleagues in the North Korean security forces. As a subordinate of Park Cheol-young and a ranking officer in his security outfit, she has great admiration for her superior and harbors deep resentment for the South.
* [[T.O.P (entertainer)|T.O.P]] as Vick
:A mysterious assassin working for an even more mysterious organization, Vick answers to a man known only as "Mr. Black." Though of apparent Korean descent, his actual origins are unknown and he communicates fluently in both English and Korean. Often, he is responsible for eliminating political targets and retrieving, as well as destroying, sensitive information at the behest of his superiors.

===Supporting cast===
====National Security Service (NSS)====
The NSS is headed by Baek San ([[Kim Yeong-cheol]]), its standing director and the man responsible for the recruiting of Hyun-jun and Sa-woo. His motivations for many of his actions are mysterious, occasionally outright inconsistent with that of the general national interests. Due to the very existence of the organization being kept secret, he enjoys a state of personal protection that few others do. 

While Baek San oversees the organization, the acting deputy director, Park Sang-hyun ([[Yoon Je-moon]]), is the general supervisor and runs the daily operations of the NSS. He has the respect of his subordinates and is known as understanding but also intransigent where failures are concerned, often personally dealing with each and every agent. For field assignments, he watches over and commands all missions set domestically.

Many of the NSS agents have close personal ties to one another, and the floor supervisor and head of security resources, Yang Jung-in ([[Kim Hye-jin]]), is no exception. She is often viewed as a dependable and accommodating authority figure and remains a very close friend to colleague Choi Seung-hee. 

Being the South's first line of defense against foreign threats, the NSS houses technology unavailable to their sister intelligence agencies. The two primary tech agents, Yang Mi-jung ([[Hyun Jyu-ni]]) and Hwang Tae-sung ([[Na Yoon]]), are often responsible for ensuring field agents have all that is required to see their missions through. Mi-jung does not meet the expected conventions of someone involved in national intelligence. Given that her sense of fashion and general interests are more contemporary than that of her associates, she often stands out from the others, but her hacking abilities have made her irreplaceable. Still, Tae-sung remains the more perdurable of the two and is often instrumental in the success of a number of operations.

The forensics and scientific investigations section is headed by Oh Hyun-ku ([[Yoon Joo-sang]]), an eccentric that is the eldest of the general staff. He often exhibits a fatherly relationship with many of the agents, including Mi-jung and Seung-hee.

====The Blue House====
Due to the overarching plot of the series involving the disputes inherent to the [[Korean Peninsula]] and the intricacies of the foreign relations between the North and South, the [[Blue House]] and its primary staff are featured prominently throughout.
[[File:Cast of Blue House in Iris.png|right|205px|thumb|The political consequences of the series are often shown from the perspective of the [[Blue House]], represented prominently in the series by, from left to right: Secretary Hong Soo-jin ([[Myung Ji-yun]]), Chief Advisor Jung Jyung-jun ([[Jung Han-yong]]), and President Cho Myung-ho ([[Lee Jung-gil]]).]]
The candidate that wins the election and assumes office is eventual [[President of South Korea]] Cho Myung-ho ([[Lee Jung-gil]]). His administration begins with his undertaking the grand task of forwarding talks of [[Korean reunification|reunification between the North and South]] after witnessing the grim reality that is the struggle between the two nations. With strong ambitions, he leads diplomatic outreaches with the North that no one expected of a candidate so early in his term.

President Cho's chief advisor and head of his cabinet is Jung Jyun-jun ([[Jung Han-yong]]), and is one of the few around him that the president feels he can trust with any information, no matter how sensitive it may be. Later in the series, he becomes the only reliable lifeline the president has against the influence of sabotage originating inside and outside the Blue House.

The secretary to the president, Hong Soo-jin ([[Myung Ji-yun]]), tends to find herself at odds with the head of the his chief advisor. She rarely speaks her mind freely and appears to have allegiances beyond those that are already apparent.

====Others====
Given the wide range of countries the characters find themselves in throughout the story, a number of recurring characters arise from countries outside of Korea.

Early in the series, Hyun-jun and Seung-hee encounter a young Japanese schoolgirl while in [[Akita, Japan|Akita]] by the name of Yuki ([[Karen Miyama]]). Her family operates one of the tourist traps nearby, and she exhibits affection for Hyun-jun and attempts to find herself in his company as much as possible. Later, it is Hyun-jun that needs her, as Yuki and her family help him when he needs them most.

When Hyun-jun finds himself tangled in a political web while in Japan, he crosses paths with Eriko Sato ([[Yoo Min]]). A Japanese woman with the country's national intelligence agency, Sato is charged with investigating foreign threats that find themselves on Japanese soil.
