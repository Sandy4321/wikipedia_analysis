'''Hanson Peak''' ({{coor dm|71|21|S|170|18|E|}}) is a small peak (1,255 m) 4 nautical miles (7 km) south of [[Cape Adare]] in the north part of [[Adare Peninsula]]. Named by the [[New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] (NZ-APC) after [[Nikolai Hanson]], member of the [[British Antarctic Expedition]], 1898-1900, under [[C.E. Borchgrevink]], who was the first man known to have died on the Antarctic mainland (at Cape Adare, [[October 14]], [[1899]]). Hanson's grave surmounts nearby Cape Adare.
