[[Blabbermouth.net]]</ref>

==Background==
[[Tomas Haake]] stated, "As always, we try to take our music in a slightly different direction with each album and with ''Koloss'', we feel that we really nailed what we were going for. Organic brutality, viscera and groove all crammed into a 54-minute metalicious treat, best avoided by the faint of heart!!"<ref name="Blab Jan. 16, 2012"/>

==Release==
The album was released on March 23, 2012 in Germany, March 26 in the rest of Europe, and March 27 in North America. It will be released as a digipack, a limited edition "Magic Cube" (including the digipack and an exclusive DVD, only available through Nuclear Blast mail-order), and a double-LP pressed on brown vinyl.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=168380 Meshuggah: New Album Cover Artwork, Track Listing Revealed - Jan. 17, 2012].
