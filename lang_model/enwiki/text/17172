'''SEGAS LNG''' is a [[liquefied natural gas]] complex in [[Damietta]], [[Egypt]]. It is located {{convert|60|km|mi|0}} west of [[Port Said]].<ref name=hydrocarbons>{{cite news | url = http://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/projects/seagas/ | title = SEGAS Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Complex, Damietta, Egypt | publisher = Hydrocarbons Technology | accessdate = 2008-02-13}}</ref> 

==History==
The LNG plant was ordered in [[2000]] and the construction works started in September [[2001]].<ref name=hydrocarbons/> The complex came on-stream in December [[2004]] and the first cargo was load on [[20 January]] [[2005]]. When SEGAS LNG became operational, it was the largest single train LNG plant in the world.<ref name=egas>{{cite news | url = http://www.egas.com.eg/docs/selectednews21.asp | title = Egypt<U+2019>s SEGAS LNG Startup  | publisher = EGAS  |date = January 2005 | accessdate = 2008-02-13}}</ref>

==Technical features==
The output capacity of the plant is 5 million tons of LNG per year. The initial capacity was designed to be 5.5 million tons of LNG per year. The complex includes the [[LNG train|LNG liquefaction train]], inlet gas reception area (metering and analysis), natural gas liquids removal and fractionation area, a docking jetty for tanker loading and transportation, LNG refrigerated storage and export facilities (tanks and booms), utilities and supporting infrastructure (power, water and roads), gas metering and treatment facilities (acid gas removal and dehydration), refrigerant condensate and LNG storage (two 150,000m<U+00B3> PC LNG storage tanks). The total investment costs of the LNG complex were around US$1.3 billion.<ref name=hydrocarbons/>

The Damietta LNG complex was designed by [[KBR (company)|KBR]] and constructed by KBR, JGC Corporation, [[M. W. Kellogg Limited]] and [[T<U+00E9>cnicas Reunidas]].  [[Saipem]] constructed storage tanks while Dodsal Pte Ltd was the subcontractor responsible for the construction of the mechanical works of LNG train.<ref name=hydrocarbons/>

==Gas supply==
The plant is supplied by natural gas from the West Delta Deep Marine (WDDM) Concession Area about {{convert|140|km|mi|-1}} from the LNG complex.  It is supplied by the Egyptian Natural Gas Company Holding (EGAS).<ref name=hydrocarbons/>

==Export markets==
Produced LNG is exported mainly to the Spanish market via a new receiving terminal at [[Sagunto]].  3.2 million tons of LNG per year is taken by Uni<U+00F3>n Fenosa Gas. Rest of the LNG is sold by Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company.<ref name=hydrocarbons/>

==Operating company==
The LNG complex is operated by SEGAS, which is controlled by Uni<U+00F3>n Fenosa Gas, a joint venture of [[Uni<U+00F3>n Fenosa]] and [[Eni]].  Uni<U+00F3>n Fenosa Gas owns 80% of SEGAS shares. Minor share holders are Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS - 10%) and Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC <U+2013> 10%).<ref name=egas/><ref name=oilegypt>{{cite news | url = http://www.oilegypt.com/webpro1/MAIN/Mainnews.asp?id=29 | title = EGAS, EGPC, Union Fenosa Gas & SEGAS sign Agreements in relation to the Damietta LNG plant | publisher = Oil Egypt |date = [[2003-06-30]] | accessdate = 2008-02-13}}</ref>

==Proposed second train==
{{future energy infrastructure}}
There are plans to build second LNG train. On [[28 March]] [[2005]] Eni, [[BP]], and EGAS signed a Memorandum of Understanding of construction of the second train in Damietta.<ref name=downstream1>{{cite news | url = http://www.downstreamtoday.com/(S(204lwz455i3vwgat0x0xgw3f))/news/Articles/200503/ENI_Inks_Deal_with_Egypt_for_nd_LNG_Tra_461.aspx | title = ENI Inks Deal with Egypt for 2nd LNG Train in Damietta | publisher = Downstream Today |date = [[2005-03-28]] | accessdate = 2008-02-13}}</ref>  On [[19 June]] [[2006]] BP and its partners signed the framework agreement for the expansion of the capacity of the LNG plant to 10 million tonnes per year.<ref name=upstream1>{{cite news | url = http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article111984.ece | title = BP signs Damietta framework deal | publisher = Upstream Online |date = [[2006-06-19]] | accessdate = 2008-02-13}}</ref>  It will be probably supplied from the Satis gas discovery in the offshore Nile Delta.
