'''Robert Smith Walker''' (born [[December 23]], [[1942]]) was an American [[politician]] who represented [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] as a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] from [[1977]] to [[1997]].  He was known for his fiery rhetoric and knowledge of [[parliamentary procedure]].

Born in [[Bradford, Pennsylvania]], Walker graduated from Penn Manor High School.  He attended the [[College of William and Mary]] from [[1960]] to [[1961]] and received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] from [[Millersville University of Pennsylvania]] in [[1964]].  Walker taught high school from [[1964]] to [[1967]].  He took his [[Master's degree|M.A.]] from the [[University of Delaware]] in [[1968]] and served in the Pennsylvania National Guard from [[1967]] to [[1973]].  

Walker became an assistant to Pennsylvania congressman [[Edwin Duing Eshleman]], working for him from [[1967]] to Eshleman's retirement in [[1977]].  Walker was elected to his seat representing southeastern Pennsylvania, including [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]], [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], and [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester]] Counties.  

In Congress, Walker was an outspoken conservative and allied himself with fellow conservatives [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Bob Dornan]] and [[Trent Lott]] and the [[Conservative Opportunity Society]].  [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]] and [[Grant Ujifusa]] wrote that Walker was "scrappy, good humored, and ready to push his principles forward even at the cost of being mocked."  He was a hawk on deficit spending and worked to reduce government spending but at the same time served on the science committee and advocated more spending on the space program, weather research, hydrogen research, and [[earthquake]] programs as well as pushing for a cabinet-level department of science.

Walker was also responsible for a rare punishment of the Speaker of the House and aiding in the rise of Gingrich.  When [[C-SPAN]] began televising the House, Walker, Gingrich, and other conservatives found they could reach a national audience with special order speeches, given at the end of the day after the House finished its legislative program.  In these speeches, they assailed the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] and their leadership in the House.  On [[May 10]], [[1984]], Walker gave one such fiery oration that irritated Speaker [[Tip O'Neill]] because the cameras did not show Walker was speaking to a deserted chamber.  O'Neill ordered Representative Charlie Rose, whose committee oversaw television coverage, to have the cameras pan the chamber and show Walker and his allies were talking to nobody.  No notice of this change was given to the Republicans when it was implemented on [[May 14]], [[1984]].  When the Republicans found out what was going on, Walker, who was speaking when the panning began, and [[Robert H. Michel]], the Republican leader, angrily complained on the floor.  The next day, Gingrich was speaking and Speaker O'Neill lost his cool, resulting in O'Neill's words being taken down and ruled out of order.  No Speaker had been so punished since [[1795]].  These events made Gingrich a household name.  Gingrich would later bring Walker into the Republican leadership; Walker was chief deputy whip.  

Walker was a fierce advocate of stronger drug laws.  He proposed that all federal contractors institute programs among their employees with violations to result in the forfeiture of federal contracts--even if as little as one joint were found in a contractor's workplace.  Walker also led a campaign against the rewriting of the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' and had the practice banned in the [[104th United States Congress|104th Congress]] when Republicans won control of the House.

''[[Congressional Quarterly]]'' would write that "he has raised too many hackles and rubbed too many nerves to be very popular" in the House, but the voters back in Pennsylvania only once gave him less than seventy percent of the vote.

In [[2001]] he was appointed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] to chair the [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry]].

His name had been circulated as a possible [[NASA]] administrator following the [[2004]] resignation of [[Sean O'Keefe]].  He is currently on the board of directors of [[SpaceDev]] and [[Zero Gravity Company]], and chairman of the board of the [[Space Foundation]].
