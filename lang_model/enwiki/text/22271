McGrath, a native of [[Ballymore, County Westmeath|Ballymore]], [[County Westmeath]] was educated at St Finian's College, [[Mullingar]] and at Trinity and All Saints College, [[Leeds]]. Prior to entering national politics, he worked as a primary schoolteacher in County Westmeath.

Paul McGrath was first elected to D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann at the [[Irish general election, 1989|1989 general election]] as a Fine Gael candidate in the Longford<U+2013>Westmeath constituency, replacing the retiring Fine Gael TD, [[Patrick Cooney]].<ref name=elecs_irl>

In 1991, he was elected as a member of [[Westmeath County Council]] and Mullingar Town Commissioners (now [[Mullingar Town Council]]), and was a member of both bodies until his retirement from local politics in 2002.

In D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann, he served as Fine Gael spokesperson on Public Works from 1993 to 1994 and as front bench spokesperson on Education in 1994, while Fine Gael were in opposition. During Fine Gael's period in government between 1995 and [[Irish General Election, 1997|1997]], he was not appointed as a senior or junior minister, but was chairperson of the Joint [[Oireachtas <U+00C9>ireann|Oireachtas]] Committee on the Family between 1995 and 1997.

In the [[Members of the 29th D<U+00E1>il|29th D<U+00E1>il]] elected in 2002, he was a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance  and the Committee on the Houses of the Oireachtas, as well as being Fine Gael's deputy spokesperson on Finance.

In 2005, his Westmeath constituency was re-constituted into the new [[Longford<U+2013>Westmeath (D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann constituency)|Longford<U+2013>Westmeath]] constituency.  In an unexpected move, McGrath retired at the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007 general election]]. Among the reasons cited were his age, his dissatisfaction with Fine Gael's proposed candidate selection strategy in the new constituency, and that he felt it unlikely that he would be chosen as a minister if Fine Gael were returned to government.
