"'''Irreplaceable'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyonc<U+00E9>]] for her second studio album, ''[[B'Day]]'' (2006). The song was written by [[Ne-Yo|Shaffer "Ne-Yo" Smith]], [[Stargate (production team)|Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel, S. Eriksen]], [[Espionage (production team)|Espen Lind, Amund Bj<U+00F8>rklund]], Beyonc<U+00E9> and produced by [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]] and Beyonc<U+00E9>. "Irreplaceable" was originally a [[country music|country]] record; it was re-arranged as a mid-[[tempo]] [[ballad]] with pop and R&B influences by modifying the vocal arrangements and instrumentation. During the production and recording sessions, Beyonc<U+00E9> and Ne-Yo wanted to create a record which people of either gender could relate to. The song's lyrics are about the breakdown of a relationship with an unfaithful man and the song contains a message about [[Women's rights|female empowerment]].

Following the moderate chart performances of "[[D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu (Beyonc<U+00E9> song)|D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu]]" and "[[Ring the Alarm]]", "Irreplaceable" was released internationally on October 23, 2006 as the album's second [[single (music)|single]], and the third in the United States on December 5, 2006. The single was released through [[Columbia Records]]. "Irreplaceable" was well-received by contemporary music critics, who cited its distinct production compared with most songs featured on the album, and complimented its [[Hook (music)|hook]], "To the left, to the left". ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed it on their lists of Best Songs of the 2000s. "Irreplaceable" won several awards, including Best R&B/Soul Single at the 2007 [[Soul Train Music Awards]]. It was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] award at the [[50th Grammy Awards]].

The single was commercially successful worldwide. It became Beyonc<U+00E9>'s fourth number-one in the U.S., was ''B'Day''{{'}}s most successful release, and remained at the top of the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for ten consecutive weeks. "Irreplaceable" was the best-selling U.S. single of 2007, the twenty-fifth most successful song of the 2000s (decade) in the U.S., and was [[Music recording sales certification|certified]] double-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). It became Beyonc<U+00E9>'s second single to achieve 200 million audience impressions in 2006. She is the second singer to achieve this feat in the U.S., the first having been [[Mariah Carey]] in 2005. "Irreplaceable" peaked at number one in Australia, at number four in the United Kingdom, and reached the top twenty in several European countries. "Irreplaceable" was 2007's tenth best-selling digital single with over 4.6&nbsp;million copies sold worldwide.<ref name="IFPI2007YEC">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/DMR208.pdf|title=Digital Music Sales Around The World|date=January 21, 2010|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|page=6|accessdate=March 17, 2013}}</ref>

The single's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Anthony Mandler]] and served as the debut performance of Beyonc<U+00E9>'s all-female band, Suga Mama. The video was included on the 2007 ''[[B'Day Anthology Video Album]]'', and a video edit was produced for "Irreemplazable", the Spanish version of the song. It won the Video of the Year award at the 2007 [[Black Entertainment Television]] (BET) Awards, and was nominated for the [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year]] at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards|2007 Awards]]. "Irreplaceable" has regularly featured in Beyonc<U+00E9>'s tours and live performances since 2006. The [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP) recognized the song as one of the most performed of 2007 at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards.

The recording was engineered by Jim Caruana and mixed by Jason Goldstein at [[Sony Music Studios]] in New York City.<ref name="B'Day"/> Goldstein was  hired to mix ''B'Day''. He said: "This song was really simple to mix. It was produced by Stargate and the sounds are really good and they all made sense, and there was lots of room for all the instruments."<ref name="sound"/> Goldstein used a board [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]] for the drums' treatment. For the acoustic guitars, he used the [[Analogue electronics|analogue]] [[Flanging|flanger]] of a [[TC Electronic|TC 1210]] spatial expander "to sweeten the sound" and to give them "a little bit more spread".<ref name="sound"/> Goldstein thought "Irreplaceable" sounded "a bit old-school"; an [[eighth note]] [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] [[Echo#In music|echo]] was placed on the song's [[lead vocalist|lead vocal]] at 341ms, using the [[Line 6 (company)|''Echo Farm'']] [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] software.<ref name="sound"/> For the backing vocals, Goldstein used ''Echo Farm'' with a [[quarter note]] delay at 682ms and Sony's ''Oxford Dynamics'' [[Audio compression (data)|compressor]]/[[limiter]] in dual-mono mode.<ref name="sound"/>

The compressor was placed in Classic setting, to emulate the [[LA-2A Leveling Amplifier|LA-2A]] [[leveler|leveling amplifier]], and the Warmth button used to add harmonics. ''Oxford Dynamics'' was used for the bass in a different setting. Goldstein passed the final mix through the ''Oxford EQ'' and ''Inflator'' plug-ins.<ref name="sound"/> [[Pro Tools]] software was used to print the [[Aux-send|aux track]] into a [[44,100 Hz|44.1kHz]]/[[24-bit]] CD and then into a 24-bit [[Audio mastering|CD master]].<ref name="sound">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr07/articles/insidetrack_0407.htm|title=Secrets Of The Mix Engineers: Jason Goldstein <U+2013> Beyonc<U+00E9>'s 'D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu' and 'Irreplaceable' |work=Sound on Sound |first=Paul |last=Tingen |date=April 2007 |accessdate=September 26, 2011}}</ref> After the sessions for "Irreplaceable" ended, Hermansen said that "everyone felt they had captured something special and that Beyonc<U+00E9> had done the track justice", but there were still concerns that urban radio might not play the song as it featured acoustic guitars and had more of a pop appeal. "But then it became the biggest urban record ... ever," [Hermansen] said.<ref name="Gil" />

=== Songwriting controversy ===
A controversy arose over the writing credits on "Irreplaceable". Ne-Yo told MTV: "Apparently Beyonc<U+00E9> was at a show somewhere and right before the song came on she said, 'I wrote this for all my ladies' and then the song came on&nbsp;...&nbsp;The song is a co-write. I wrote the lyrics, I wrote all the lyrics. Beyonc<U+00E9> helped me with the melodies and the harmonies and the vocal arrangement and that makes it a co-write.

The song's lyrics are constructed in the verse-pre-chorus-chorus form.<ref name="Sheet"/> It begins with guitar strumming, and Beyonc<U+00E9> sings the [[Hook (music)|hook]]-[[Introduction (music)|intro]], "To the left, to the left: everything you own in a box to the left".<ref name="Kelefa"/><ref name="Joseph"/> In bar seven, she sings the first verse, arguing with her boyfriend about the indifference of their relationship, and tells him to walk away. The pre-chorus and chorus follow, "You must not know 'bout me&nbsp;...&nbsp;I can have another you by tomorrow / I could have another you in a minute&nbsp;...&nbsp;Don't you ever for a second get to thinking / You're irreplaceable". In the second verse, Beyonc<U+00E9> recollects the moment she discovered her boyfriend's infidelity. The same pattern leads to the second chorus. Towards the end, Beyonc<U+00E9> sings the [[bridge (music)|bridge]], where she tells her lover, "Replacing you is so easy". The song closes with an [[Ad libitum|ad-libbed]] chorus.<ref name="Kelefa"/> ''The Boston Globe'' noted that Beyonc<U+00E9> sings some parts of it in a higher register "that complements the lyrics' wounded sensibility".<ref name="Boston"/>

== Release ==
During the production of "Irreplaceable", Hermansen thought that the track would not receive radio play because of the acoustic guitars, and deemed the song too pop-oriented. Hermansen did not expect "Irreplaceable" to conform to any genre. Despite his prediction, the song became successful on [[urban contemporary|urban]] charts. It was played in New York and on country radio stations. Shortly after the release of "Irreplaceable", Beyonc<U+00E9> told MTV: "I love 'Irreplaceable'. I think it's important to have those songs. I've had so many people come up to me in tears, saying, 'I experienced my first breakup. If it wasn't for the song, I wouldn't be strong enough to not call. I wouldn't know how much I'm worth.' I'm happy to be a part of that."<ref name="Gil"/>

Her acting-then-ex-boyfriend in the video is model [[Bobby Roache]], who played police officer for the "Ring the Alarm" music video and warrior during [[Jay-Z]] and Beyonc<U+00E9>'s live performance at the 2006 Fashion Rocks show.<ref name="Reid">{{Cite web |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |title=Beyonc<U+00E9>'s 'Irreplaceable' Guy Had A Tough Time Getting Dumped: VMA Lens Recap |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1568975/beyonces-irreplaceable-guy-had-a-tough-time-getting-dumped-vma-lens-recap/ |publisher=MTV News|date=September 6, 2011 |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}</ref> The video was included on the 2007 ''[[B'Day Anthology Video Album]]'', and a video edit was produced for "Irreemplazable".

The music video follows the storyline of the song's lyrics. "She told me to pack up all my stuff, I'm getting kicked out<U+2014>the video starts off like that", said Roache.<ref name="Reid"/> It opens with Beyonc<U+00E9> filing her nails in silence, as her ex-partner packs up his property, as Beyonc<U+00E9> orders him to leave. Mid-way in the video, Beyonc<U+00E9> follows her then-ex-boyfriend outside the house and leans on a 2007 [[Jaguar XK]]. She appears to be pretentiously caressing him; only for the audience to find out that she is repossessing things she bought for him. He leaves her and the car, about to ride off in a taxi. Between cuts, Beyonc<U+00E9> manages herself in front of a mirror; putting on a lipstick, wearing huge curlers and a high-waisted skirt. There are additional beats mixed to the arrangement for the video version that can be heard, when Beyonc<U+00E9> sings with her all-female band, Suga Mama, towards the end. It ends with Beyonc<U+00E9> greeting her new boyfriend at the front door.
