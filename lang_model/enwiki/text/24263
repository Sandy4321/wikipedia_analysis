'''Castlemaine Perkins''' is a [[brewery]] located in [[Milton, Queensland|Milton]], [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]].

In [[1877]], the Fitzgerald brothers of [[Castlemaine, Victoria]] bought the site of a failing distillery and created a brewery, which they named after their home town and its eponymous brewery. They began to brew beer there in the following year and the brewery continues production to this day. Castlemaine Perkins is the home of the [[XXXX]] beer brand.

The brewery is located on Milton Road opposite the [[Milton railway station, Brisbane|Milton railway station]], and is a prominent landmark visible in the surrounding suburbs. In particular the XXXX red neon sign is mounted on the top of the building. The side of the building also a neon XXXX man on the side (visible on Milton Road when travelling out of the city). As well as being visible, the smell of the brewery travels around the surrounding suburbs depending on wind conditions.

The brewery building, Milton Railway Station and trains feature on almost all XXXX packaging directly below the XXXX logo.  Over the years bottle labels have depicted steam, diesel and electric trains.

Tours of the brewery are regularly run for groups.

Castlemaine's signature beer, [[XXXX Bitter]] (despite its name a [[lager]]), was introduced in [[1924]]. The XXXX had been used for a sparkling ale since 1878.

Castlemaine Perkins was acquired in [[1992]] by drinks conglomerate [[Lion Nathan]].
