The three '''''Indiana''-class battleships''' were the first [[battleship]]s to be built by the [[United States Navy]] equivalent to contemporary European ships, such as the British [[HMS Hood (1891)|''Hood'']]. Authorized in 1890 and commissioned between November 1895 and April 1896, they were relatively small battleships with heavy armor and ordnance that pioneered the use of an [[Pre-dreadnought battleship#armament|intermediate battery]]. Specifically intended for [[Coastal defence and fortification|coastal defense]], their [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] was too low in the water to deal well with the waves of the open ocean. They also lacked counterweights to their turrets, and the main [[armor belt]] was placed too low to be effective under most conditions.

The ships were named ''Indiana'', ''Massachusetts'' and ''Oregon'' and designated ''Battleship Number 1'' through ''3''. All three served in the [[Spanish-American War]], although the ''Oregon''<U+2014>who was stationed on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]<U+2014>had to make a 14,000 mile (26,000&nbsp;km) cruise around South America to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] first. After the war the ''Oregon'' returned to the Pacific and participated in the [[Philippine<U+2013>American War]] and [[Boxer Rebellion]], while her sister ships were restricted to training missions in the Atlantic ocean. After 1903, the obsolete battleships were de- and recommissioned several times, the last time during [[World War I|World&nbsp;War&nbsp;I]] when ''Indiana'' and ''Massachusetts'' served as a training ships, while the ''Oregon'' was a transport escort for the [[Siberian Intervention]].

In 1919 all three ships were decommissioned for the final time. ''Indiana'' was sunk as an explosives test target a year later and sold for scrap in 1924. ''Massachusetts'' was scuttled off the coast of [[Pensacola]] in 1920 and used as an artillery target. The wreck was never scrapped and is now a [[Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve]]. ''Oregon'' was initially preserved as a museum, but was sold for scrap during [[World War II]]. The scrapping was later halted and the stripped hulk was used as an ammunition barge during the [[Battle of Guam (1944)|battle of Guam]]. The hulk was finally sold for scrap in 1956.

==Background==
The ''Indiana'' class was very controversial at the time of their approval by the [[United States Congress]]. A policy board convened by the [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Benjamin F. Tracy]] came up with an ambitious 15-year naval construction program on 16 July 1889, three years after the {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|2}} and the {{USS|Texas|1892|2}} were authorized. The battleships in their plan would include ten [[first rate]] long range battleships with a 17-knot (20&nbsp;mph; 31&nbsp;km/h) top speed and a steaming radius of 5,400&nbsp;[[nautical miles|nautical&nbsp;miles]] (10,000&nbsp;km) at 10&nbsp;knots (19&nbsp;km/h)<U+2014>6,500&nbsp;nmi (12,000&nbsp;km) maximum. These ships, with the ability to travel overseas and take the fight into an enemy's home waters, were envisioned as a possible [[fleet in being]], where enemies would be forced to keep powerful warships at home<U+2014>as opposed to off the coast of the United States<U+2014>to counter a possible raiding mission. 25 short range [[second rate]] battleships would provide home defense in both the Atlantic and Pacific and support the faster and larger long range vessels. With a range of roughly 2,700&nbsp;nautical miles (3,100&nbsp;mi; 5,000&nbsp;km) at 10&nbsp;knots and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of 23.5&nbsp;feet (7&nbsp;m), they would roam from the [[St. Lawrence River]] in the north to the [[Windward Islands]] and [[Panama]] in the south and would be able to enter all of the ports in the southern United States.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 23<U+2013>24, 29</ref><ref name=RS52>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', 52</ref>

It was proposed, probably for cost reasons, that the short range battleships should have a hierarchy of three subclasses. The first would mount four 13-inch (330&nbsp;mm) guns each on eight 8,000-long-ton (8,100&nbsp;t) ships; the second would mount four 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns each on ten 7,150-long-ton (7,260&nbsp;t) ships, and the third would mount two 12-inch and two 10-inch (254&nbsp;mm) guns each on five 6,000-long-ton (6,100&nbsp;t) ships. The two battleships already under construction, ''Texas'' and ''Maine'', were to be grouped under the last class. In addition, 167 smaller ships, including [[Naval ram|rams]], [[cruiser]]s and [[torpedo boat]]s, would be built, coming to a total cost of [[United States dollar|$]]281.55&nbsp;million,<ref name=RS52/><ref name=F24>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 24</ref> approximately equal to the sum of the entire US navy budget during the previous fifteen years.<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/budget.htm Historical naval budget]</ref>

Congress balked at the plan, seeing in it an end to the United States [[United States non-interventionism|policy of isolationism]] and the beginning of [[imperialism]]. Even some supporters of a naval expansion were wary; Senator [[Eugene Hale]] feared that because the proposal was so large, the entire bill would be shot down and no money appropriated for any ships. However, in April 1890, the [[House of Representative]]s approved funding for three 8,500-long-ton (8,600&nbsp;t) battleships. Tracy, trying to soothe tensions within Congress, remarked that these ships were so powerful that only twelve would be necessary instead of the 35 from the original plan. He also slashed the operating costs of the Navy by giving the remaining [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]]<U+2014>which were utterly obsolete by this time<U+2014>to navy militias operated by the states.<ref name=F2425>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 24<U+2013>25</ref> The appropriation was also approved by the Senate, and in total three coast<U+2013>defense battleships (the "Indianas"), a cruiser, and a torpedo boat were given official approval and funding on 30 June 1890.<ref name=F2425/><ref name="G121">Gardiner, ''Steam, Steel & Shellfire: The Steam Warship 1815<U+2013>1905'', 121</ref>

The first class of short range ships as envisioned by the policy board were to mount 13-inch/35 [[caliber#Caliber as measurement of length|caliber]] and new 5-inch (127&nbsp;mm) guns, with 17&nbsp;inches (432&nbsp;mm) of [[belt armor]], 2.75&nbsp;inches (70&nbsp;mm) of deck armor and 4&nbsp;inches (102&nbsp;mm) of armor over the [[casemate]]s. The ''Indiana''s, as actually built, exceeded the this design in displacement by 25 percent, but most other aspects were relatively similar. An 18-inch (457&nbsp;mm) belt and a secondary battery of 8- and 6-inch (203 and 152&nbsp;mm) guns were adopted, the latter because the [[Bureau of Ordnance]] did not have the capability to construct rapid-firing 5-inch weaponry. As the larger weapons were much slower firing and much heavier, this was not seen as a great compromise, but without the heavier guns, the ships would not be able to penetrate the armor of foreign battleships.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 26<U+2013>27</ref>

==Design==
[[File:USS Oregon 1893 USNHC NH 76619 010332.jpg|thumb|Outboard profile of the ''Oregon'', with position and arc of fire of the armament|alt=drawing schematic, showing two large turrets before and aft and four smaller turrets on wing positions midships]]
===General characteristics===
The ''Indiana'' class was designed specifically for coastal defense and was not intended for offensive actions.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal = Scientific American| volume = 74| pages = 97| date = 9 May 1896}}; cited in Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', 210</ref> This design view was reflected in their moderate coal endurance, relatively small displacement and low freeboard, which limited sea going capability.<ref name=G121/> They were however heavily armed and armored, so much in fact that Conway describes them as "attempting too much on a very limited displacement."<ref name=C140>Conway, ''All the world's fighting ships'', 140</ref>. They resembled the contemporary British [[HMS Hood (1891)|HMS ''Hood'']], but were {{convert|60|ft|m}} shorter, had 4,000 tons less displacement and featured an intermediate battery consisting of eight {{convert|8|in|mm|sing=on}} guns not found in European ships<ref name=G121/>, giving it a very respectable amount of firepower for its time.<ref name=RS52/>

The original design of the "Indianas" included [[bilge keel]]s, but they were considered problematic for [[drydock]] operations and not included during construction. This meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for the ''Indiana'' when both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy sea a year after commissioning. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. When the ship encountered more bad weather four months later, she promptly steamed back to port for fear the clamps would break again.<ref name=RS59>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', 59</ref> This convinced the navy that bilge keels were necessary and they were subsequently installed on all three ships.<ref name=RS60>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', 60</ref>

===Armament===
Given its limited displacement, the ''Indianas'' had a formidable armament for its time: four 13&nbsp;inch (330&nbsp;mm) guns, an intermediate battery of eight 8&nbsp;inch (208&nbsp;mm) guns and a secondary battery of four 6&nbsp;inch (152&nbsp;mm) guns, twenty [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss|Hotchkiss 6-pounders]], six [[QF 1 pounder pom-pom|Maxim-Nordenfelt 1-pounders]] as well as six <ref group=note name=torpedo>Sources conflict on this. Reilly & Scheina claim six on p. 56, then four on p. 68. They also claim on ''Massachusetts'' and ''Oregon'' one broadside tube was left out to provide additional space, leaving them with three or five tubes. [[DANFS]] claims six tubes on the latter two and no information is given on the ''Indiana''. Friedman claims the contract called for seven tubes, but the ships were completed with five and only four on the ''Indiana''</ref> 18&nbsp;inch (460&nbsp;mm) [[British 18 inch torpedo|Whitehead torpedo]] tubes <ref>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', 54-55</ref>
[[File:USS Indiana forecastle.jpg|thumb|left|alt=several men stand on deck next to a large turret, with a smaller one visible in the backgound|The forecastle of ''Indiana'', showing its fore 13-inch turret and one of the 8-inch turrets]]
The 13-inch gun was 35 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]] long and used [[black powder]], giving a range of about {{convert|12000|yd}} at 15 degrees of elevation. At {{convert|6000|yd}} a shell was expected to penetrate {{convert|10|-|12|in|cm}} of side armour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_13-35_mk1.htm |title=13"/35 (33 cm) Mark 1 and Mark 2 |publisher=navweaps.com }}</ref> The four guns were mounted in two centerline turrets, located fore and aft. The turrets were originally designed to feature sloping side armor, but space requirements made this impossible without using significantly larger gun turrets or redesigning the gun mounts (which was later done for the [[Illinois class battleship|''Illinois'' class battleships]]).<ref>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', 55</ref> The ships' low freeboard greatly hindered the use of the main battery in rough weather conditions, because the deck would become awash. Also, because the ship lacked a counterweight to offset the weight of the gun barrels, the ship would [[List (watercraft)|list]] in the direction the guns were aimed. This reduced the maximum arc of elevation (and thus range) to about 5 degrees, brought the main armor belt under water on that side, and exposed the unarmored bottom on the other. It was considered in 1901 to replace the turrets with new balanced models used in later ships, but that was decided to be too costly since the ships were already obsolete. Instead counterweights were added, which partially solved the problem. The hydraulic rammers and  turning mechanisms of the 8-inch turrets were also replaced by faster and more efficient electric equivalents, new sights were fitted and on ''Indiana'' and ''Massachusetts'', and new turret hoists were installed to improve the reloading speed,<ref name=RS62>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', 62</ref> but the gun mountings never performed in an entirely satisfactory manner.<ref name="G121"/>

The eight 8&nbsp;inch (208&nbsp;mm) guns were mounted in pairs in four wing turrets placed on the superstructure. Their arc of fire, although big on paper, was in reality limited. Adjacent gun positions and superstructure would be damaged by their muzzle blast if the gun was trained alongside it, a defect also suffered by the 13&nbsp;inch (330&nbsp;mm) guns.<ref name="RS60"/> The smaller 6&nbsp;inch guns were mounted in twin wing [[casemates]] midships on the main deck level, with a ''6-pounder'' in between. The other ''Hotchkiss 6-pounders'' lined the superstructure and bridge decks. Four of the ''1-pounders'' were placed in hull casemates at the bow and stern of the ship and two more in the [[fighting top]]s of the masts.<ref name=RS52/> In the 1908 the 6&nbsp;inch and most of the lighter guns were removed to compensate for the counterweights added to the main battery and because ammunition supply to the guns was considered problematic. A year later twelve 3&nbsp;inch (76mm) 50 caliber single-purpose guns were added midships and on fighting top mounts.<ref name=RS62/>

Sources conflict on the number of torpedo tubes originally included in the ships<ref group= note name=torpedo/>, but it is clear they were located on the [[Berth deck]] and had above water ports located on the extreme front and aft and possibly midships. Located too close to the waterline to allow use while moving and vulnerable to gunfire when opened, they were considered useless and were quickly reduced in number, being completely removed before 1908.<ref name=RS62/>

===Protection===
With the exception of the deck armor, 8-inch turrets and conning tower<U+2014>which consisted of conventional nickel steel<U+2014>the ''Indiana'' class was protected with modern [[Harvey armor]]. Its main protection was an 18&nbsp;inch (460&nbsp;mm) thick belt, placed along two thirds of the length of the hull from 3&nbsp;ft (0.9&nbsp;m) above to 1&nbsp;ft (0.3&nbsp;m) under the waterline. Beyond this point the belt gradually grew thinner until it ended 4&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;inch (1.3&nbsp;m) under the waterline, where the belt was only 8.5&nbsp;inch (220&nbsp;mm) thick. Below the belt the ship had no armor, only a double bottom. On both ends the belt was connected the to the [[barbettes]] of the main guns with 14&nbsp;inch (360&nbsp;mm) armored [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]]. In the waterline sections outside this central citadel compartments filled with compressed cellulose were placed, intended to "self seal" when damaged. Between the deck and the main belt 5&nbsp;inch (130&nbsp;mm) hull armor was used. The deck armor was 2.75&nbsp;inch (70&nbsp;mm) thick inside the citadel and 3&nbsp;inch (76&nbsp;mm) outside it. The hollow [[conning tower]] was a 10&nbsp;inch (250&nbsp;mm) thick single forging. The 13&nbsp;inch gun battery had 15&nbsp;inch (380&nbsp;mm) vertical turret plating and 17&nbsp;inch (430&nbsp;mm) thick barbettes, while the 8&nbsp;inch cannons only had 6&nbsp;inch (150&nbsp;mm) vertical turret plating and 8&nbsp;inch (200&nbsp;mm) thick barbettes. The casemates protecting the 6&nbsp;inch guns were 5&nbsp;inch (130&nbsp;mm) and the other casemates, lighter guns, shell hoists and turret crowns were all lightly armored.<ref group=note name=armor>The armor of the ''Oregon'', build by a different shipyard, had slightly different dimensions: 8&nbsp;inch (200&nbsp;mm) at the lowest point of the belt, 6.25&nbsp;inch (160&nbsp;mm) on the hull and 4.5&nbsp;inch (114&nbsp;mm) on the deck inside the citadel. She also had no double bottom outside the central citadel</ref><ref>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', 56,58 & 68</ref>
[[File:Fire room Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|alt=Two dirty men feeding coal into an oven in a rather gloomy looking room| A close up view of the fire room (boiler room) of the ''Massachusetts'']]
The belt armor for the ''Indiana'' class was designed based on the nominal draft, which was 24&nbsp;ft (8&nbsp;m) with a normal load of 400 tons of coal on board. Her total coal storage capacity was 1600 tons and fully loaded her draft would increase to 27&nbsp;ft (9&nbsp;m), entirely submerging the armor belt. These findings outraged the Walker board during their design studies for the [[Illinois class battleship|''Illinois'' class]] in 1896. The board decided to set a standard for future ships, dictating that the normal load of coal and ammunition had to be at least two-thirds of the maximum.<ref>Friedman, "U.S. Battleships", 29</ref>

===Propulsion===
Two vertical inverted [[triple expansion]] [[reciprocating steam engine]]s, powered by four [[Scotch marine boiler#Double-ended|double ended Scotch boilers]], drove the ''Indianas'' twin propellers, while two single ended Scotch boilers supplied steam for auxiliary machinery.<ref name=RS58>Reilly & Scheina, "American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923", 58</ref> The engines were designed to provide 9000 [[indicated horsepower]] (6700&nbsp;kW), giving the ship a top speed of {{convert|15|knots|km/h}}<ref name=F425>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 425</ref> During [[sea trial]]s<U+2014>which were conducted with limited amounts of coal, ammunition and supplies on board<U+2014>it was found that the indicated horsepower and top speed exceeded design values and a significant variation between the three ships existed. The engines of the ''Indiana'' delivered {{convert|9700|ihp|kW|abbr=on}}, giving a top speed of {{convert|15.5|knots|km/h}}. ''Massachusetts'' had a top speed of {{convert|16.2|knots|km/h}} with {{convert|10400|ihp|kW|abbr=on}} and the ''Oregon'' reached a speed of {{convert|16.8|knots|km/h}} with {{convert|11000|ihp|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref name=RS68>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', 68</ref> On the ''Indiana'' and ''Massachusetts'' eight [[Babcock & Wilcox boiler]]s, including four with [[superheater]]s, were installed in respectively 1904 and 1907 to replace the outdated Scotch boilers<ref name=RS62>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', 62</ref>

{{Main|USS Indiana (BB-1)}}
Commissioned in 1895, the ''Indiana'' did not participate in any notable events until the outbreak of the [[Spanish-American War]] in 1898, when Indiana was part of the [[North Atlantic Squadron]] under [[Rear admiral]] [[William T. Sampson]].<ref name=DANFS1>{{Cite web

His squadron was ordered to the Spanish port of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] in an attempt to intercept and destroy [[Admiral]] [[Pascual Cervera y Topete|Cevera]]'s Spanish squadron, which was on route to the Caribbean from Spain. The harbor was empty, but ''Indiana'' and the rest of the squadron bombarded it for two hours before realizing their mistake. Three weeks later news arrived that [[Commodore]] [[Winfield Scott Schley|Schley]]'s [[Flying Squadron (US Navy)|Flying Squadron]] had found ''Cervera'' and was now blockading him in the port of [[Santiago]]. ''Sampson'' was quick to reinforce ''Schley'' and assume overall command.<ref name=swsan>{{Cite web

''Cervera'' saw that his situation was desperate and attempted to run the blockade on 3 July 1898. ''Indiana'' did not join in the chase of the fast Spanish [[cruiser]]s because of her extreme eastern position on the blockade<ref name=DANFS1/> and low speed caused by engine problems,<ref name=swsan/> but was near the harbor entrance when the Spanish [[destroyer]]s [[Spanish destroyer Pluton|''Pluton'']] and [[Spanish destroyer Furor|''Furor'']] emerged. Together with battleship [[USS Iowa (BB-4)|''Iowa'']] and [[armed yacht]] [[USS Gloucester (1891)|''Gloucester'']] she opened fire, quickly destroying the lightly armored enemy ships.<ref name=DANFS1/>

After the war the ''Indiana'' returned to training exercises before decommissioning in 1903. The battleship recommissioned in January 1906 to function as a training vessel until she was decommissioned again in 1914. Her third commission was in 1917 when ''Indiana'' served as a training ship for gun crews during [[World War I]]. She decommissioned for the final time on 31 January 1919, shortly after being reclassified ''Coast Battleship Number 1'' so that the name ''Indiana'' could be assigned to the newly authorized<U+2014>but never completed<U+2014>battleship [[USS Indiana (BB-50)]]. She was sunk as a target in under water explosion and aerial bombing tests in November 1920. Her hulk was sold for scrap on 19 March 1924.<ref name=DANFS1/>

During the war she was placed in the Flying Squadron under Commodore [[Winfield Scott Schley]]. ''Schley'' went searching for ''Cervera's'' Spanish squadron and found it in the port of Santiago. The battleship was part of the blockade fleet until 3 July, but missed the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]], because she had steamed to [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]] the night before to resupply coal.<ref name=swsan/> The next day the battleship came back to Santiago, where she and ''Texas'' fired at the [[Spanish cruiser Reina Mercedes]], which was being scuttled by the Spanish in a failed attempt to block the harbor entrance channel.<ref name=reinam>{{Cite web

During the next 7 years, ''Massachusetts'' cruised the Atlantic coast and eastern Caribbean as a member of the [[North Atlantic Squadron]] and then a year more as a training ship for Naval Academy midshipmen until she was decommissioned in January 1906.
May 1910 she was placed in reduced commission as a training ship again before entering the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]] in September 1912, where she stayed until decommissioning in May 1914. ''Massachusetts'' recommissioned in June 1917 to serve as a training ship for guncrews during World War I. She decommissioned for the final time on 31 March 1919, after being re-designated ''Coast Battleship Number 2'' two days earlier so her name could be reused for the [[USS Massachusetts (BB-54)]]. On 6 January 1921 she was scuttled off the coast of [[Pensacola]] and used as an artillery target for [[Fort Pickens]]. The navy attempted to sell her for scrap, but no buyer could be found and in 1956 the ship was declared property of the state of Florida.<ref name=DANFS2/> The wreck is currently one of the [[Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserves]] and serves as an artificial reef.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museumsinthesea.com|title=museums in the sea|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref>

===Oregon (BB-3)===
{{Main|USS Oregon (BB-3)}}
''Oregon'' served for a short time on the [[Pacific Station]] before being ordered on a voyage around South America to the East Coast in march 1898 to serve in a possible war with Spain. She departed from [[San Francisco]] on 19 March, and reached [[Jupiter Inlet]] on 24 May, stopping several times for additional coal on the way. A journey of over 14,000 nautical miles (26,000 km) completed in 66 days, which was considered a remarkable achievement at that time.<ref> Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', 66-67</ref> The [[DANFS]] describe the effect of the journey on the American public and government as follows: "On one hand the feat had demonstrated the many capabilities of a heavy battleship in all conditions of wind and sea. On the other it swept away all opposition for the construction of the [[Panama Canal]], for it was then made clear that the country could not afford to take two months to send warships from one coast to the other each time an emergency arose."<ref name=DANFS3>{{Cite web

She took part in the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]], where she was the only ship fast enough to chase down the [[Spanish cruiser Cristobal Colon]] and forcing it surrender. The American cruisers had higher maximum speeds, but had half of their engines uncoupled. This fuel-saving measure had the side effect of halving speed, making them unable to keep up with the Spanish ships.<ref name=swsan/> Her journey around South-America and performance during the battle of Santiago earned her the nickname "[[William McKinley|Mc Kinley]]'s Bulldog" or "Bulldog of the Navy".<ref name=Ortrip>{{Cite web

After the war the ''Oregon'' was refitted in [[New York]] before she was sent back to the Pacific, where she served as a [[guard ship]] for two years. First a year in the [[Philippines]] during [[Philippine<U+2013>American War]] and then another year in China at [[Wusong]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] until May 1901, when she was ordered back to the United States for an overhaul. In March 1903 ''Oregon'' returned to Asiatic waters and the ship remained in the Far East, returning only shortly before decommissioning in April 1906. ''Oregon'' recommissioned in August 1911, but saw little activity and on went officially into a reserve status in 1914. On 2 January 1915 was placed in full commission again and sailed to [[San Francisco]] for the [[Panama<U+2013>Pacific International Exposition]]. A year later she was back to reserve status, only to be returned to full commission in April 1917 when the United States joined World War I. ''Oregon'' acted as one of the escorts for transports of the [[Siberian Intervention]]. In June 1919 she decommissioned, only to be temporarily recommissioned from August to October to be the reviewing ship for President [[Woodrow Wilson]] during the arrival of the Pacific Fleet at [[Seattle]]. As a result of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], ''Oregon'' was declared "incapable of further warlike service" in January 1924. In June 1925 she was loaned to the [[State of Oregon]], who used her as floating monument and museum in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].<ref name=DANFS3/>

In February 1941, ''Oregon'' was re-designated IX<U+2013>22. Shortly after it was decided that<U+2014>because of [[World War II]]<U+2014>the scrap value of the ship was more important then her historical value and she was sold. Her stripped hulk was later returned to the Navy and used as an ammunition barge during the [[battle of Guam (1944)|battle of Guam]], where she remained for several years. During a typhoon in November 1948, she broke loose and drifted out to sea. She was relocated 500 miles southeast of Guam and towed back. She was sold on 15 March 1956 and scrapped in Japan.<ref name=DANFS3/>
