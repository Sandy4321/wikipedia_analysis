'''Rosemary de Brissac Dobson''' [[Order of Australia|AO]] (born  18 June 1920) is an award winning [[Australia]]n poet, who is also significant as an illustrator, editor and anthologist.<ref name = "Anderson">Anderson (1996)</ref> She has published fourteen volumes of poetry, has been published in almost every annual volume of ''Australian Poetry'' and has been translated into French and other languages.<ref name = "Adelaide">Adelaide (1988) p. 52</ref>

The Judges of the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards in 1996 described her significance as follows: "The level of originality and strength of Rosemary's poetry cannot be underestimated, nor can the contribution she has made to Australian literature. Her literary achievements, especially her poetry, are a testament to her talent and dedication to her art."<ref>New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards Judges Comments</ref>

==Life==
Rosemary Dobson was born in [[Sydney]], the second daughter of English-born A.A.G. (Arthur) Dobson and Marjorie (n<U+00E9>e Caldwell). Her father's father was [[Henry Austin Dobson|Austin Dobson]] a poet and essayist.<ref name = "HootonB">Hooton (2000b) p. 1, 5, 10, 11, 25, 3</ref> Her father died when she was five years old. She attended the prestigious [[Frensham School]] where her mother obtained work as a housemistress.<ref name= "HootonB"/> Here she met Australian children's author, [[Joan Phipson]], who had been asked to set up a printing press.<ref name= "HootonB"/> She stayed on, after completion of her studies, as an apprentice teacher of art and art history.<ref name= "HootonB"/>

When she turned 21, Dobson attended the [[University of Sydney]] as a non-degree student.<ref name= "HootonB"/> She also studied design with Australian artist, [[Thea Proctor]].<ref name = "Adelaide"/> She worked as an editor and reader for the publisher [[Angus and Robertson]]<ref>[http://www.austlit.com/a/dobson/ Rosemary Dobson Contents Page] (Australian Literature Resources) Accessed: February 13, 2007</ref> with Beatrice Davis and [[Nan McDonald (poet)|Nan McDonald]].

She married the publisher Alec Bolton (1926-1996), whom she met while working at Angus and Robertson, in Sydney, and they had three children. During these Sydney years she became well-acquainted with other writers and artists, such as poet [[Douglas Stewart]] and his artist wife, [[Margaret Coen]], writer and artist [[Norman Lindsay]], [[Kenneth Slessor]], and [[James McAuley]]. They lived in [[London]] from 1966 to 1971, during which she travelled widely in Europe and cemented her lifelong interest in art.<ref name = "Anderson"/>

The Boltons moved to [[Canberra]] in 1971 where Alec Bolton set up the Publications area of the [[National Library of Australia]]. In Canberra they were friendly with [[David Campbell (poet)|David Campbell]],  [[A. D. Hope]], R. F. Brissenden and [[Dorothy Auchterlonie|Dorothy Green]]. As time wore on, her local circle explanded to include younger writers such as [[Alan Gould]] and [[Geoff Page]].<ref name= "HootonB"/>

Her older sister, Ruth, became Australia's first woman career diplomat Ambassador.<ref name= "HootonB"/>

==Literary career==
Dobson began writing poetry at the age of seven.<ref name= "HootonB"/> Her first collection, ''In a Convex Mirror'', appeared in 1944, and was followed by thirteen more volumes. Her work demonstrates her love of art, antiquity and mythology<ref>Wilde, Hooton and Andrews (1994) p. 135</ref> as well as her experience of motherhood. Hooton describes her work as both consistent and varied: "consistency balanced with variety, reserve with passion, past with present, tradition with innovation, ancient myth with contemporary life, domesticity with culture, and above all Australia with Europe.<ref name= "HootonB"/>

[[Douglas Stewart]] suggested that she is "a religious person in the deepest and most important sense".<ref name="Smith334">Smith (1980) p. 334</ref> In her introduction to her 1973 ''Selected Poems'', Dobson wrote of her aims: <blockquote>"I hope it will be perceived that the poems presented here are part of a search for something only fugitively glimpsed, a state of grace which one once knew, or imagined, or from which one was turned away. Surely everyone who writes poetry would agree this is part of it - a doomed but urgent wish to express the inexpressible".<ref name="Smith334"/></blockquote>

In addition to poetry she has produced anthologies including two, with poet [[David Campbell (poet)|David Campbell]], containing their translations of Russian poetry. She has also written prose.

==Brindabella Press==
In 1972, Dobson's husband, Alec Bolton, sent up [[Brindabella Press]] on which he worked for the rest of his life, working more actively after his retirement from the Library in 1987. Dobson had input as editorial adviser and proof-reader.<ref name= "HootonB"/> Both she and Bolton enjoyed the art of the private press in a time when computer type-setting was taking over and producing a more standardised product.<ref name="Smith333">Smith (1980) p. 333</ref>

Two early publications from the press, published in 1973, were a small sheet edition of some of Dobson's poems titled ''Three poems on water-springs'' and a small book of poems by David Campbell titled ''Starting from Central Station : a sequence of poems''.

==Portraits==
Norman Lindsay made three portraits of Dobson, the first one at the suggestion of Douglas Stewart who suggested he draw or paint Australian writers.<ref name = "Bolton8">Bolton (2005) p. 8</ref> Lindsay's first portrait of Dobson was a drawing, but it was then suggested that he do an oil painting. Lindsay asked her to wear her rose-coloured evening dress. This painting is now owned by the [[National Library of Australia]], as is the dress she wore for the portrait.<ref name = "Bolton89">Bolton (2005) p. 8-9</ref> Dobson sat a third time for Lindsay, at his request and wearing clothes of his suggestion. This portrait is now missing.<ref name = "Bolton89"/>

Artist [[Thea Proctor]] made four drawings of Dobson while Dobson was attending Proctor's art classes.<ref name = "Bolton9">Bolton (2005) p. 9</ref>
