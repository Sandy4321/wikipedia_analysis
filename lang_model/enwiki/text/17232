The '''Skrulls''' are a [[fictional]] race of [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] shapeshifters that appear in the [[Marvel Universe]]. The Skrulls first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #2 (January 1962) and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

The Skrull civilization is organized into a highly aggressive and [[military|militaristic]] Empire that has been the dominant power in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] for thousands of years. In the known Marvel Universe, only the [[Kree]] and the [[Shi'ar]] have the resources to match the Skrull Empire.

==Conception==
In creating the Skrulls, [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] drew upon stereotypes of [[extraterrestrial life]] common in [[science fiction]]. Skrull skin color suggested the concept of [[little green men]], and Skrull [[shapeshifting]] and infiltration abilities recalled the then-recent horror-thriller film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''.<ref>Released in 1956</ref> The name "Skrull" also hints at the word "[[skull]]", bringing to mind images of death (in the Portuguese versions of Marvel Comics, the Skrulls are known as ''os caveiras'' - literally "the skulls"). The cover of the first issue of the Fantastic Four to feature the Skrulls is also highly evocative of the Skrulls' origins as [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] alien invaders:

{{quotation|THEY WERE MERCILESS! THEY WERE INHUMAN! THEY HAD POWERS FAR GREATER THAN EARTHMEN! THEY WERE THE DEADLY "SKRULLS FROM OUTER SPACE!"}}

Though originally nothing more than stereotypical [[alien invasion|alien invaders]] bent on conquest, writers have over the years written Skrull characters into more complex and multifaceted roles.

== Fictional species biography ==

Millions of years ago, the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] performed genetic experiments on the [[reptile|reptilian]] ancestors of the Skrulls, resulting in three branches of Skrulls that eventually warred with one another. The [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] branch - possessing the innate ability to [[shapeshift]] - were triumphant, and after wiping out all other Skrulls began to expand their territory. The Deviant branch would later split into two more groups, being the modern Skrulls and an anomaly called the [[Dire Wraiths]], a parasitic race that could still shapeshift and had use of magic, but were not as technologically advanced as the Skrulls (the Dire Wraiths were eventually exterminated through the efforts of [[Rom Spaceknight]]).

The modern Skrulls originate from the planet of Skrullos, and were originally a mercantile civilisation, primarily interested in [[free trade]] and willing to share their [[technology]] with all race they deemed worthy. A Skrull delegation to the planet Hala, home to the then barbaric [[Kree]] and the peaceful [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]], held a contest between the two races to determine with whom the Skrulls would trade. The Cotati won, but the vengeful Kree massacred the Skrull delegation, took over the Skrull landing spaceship by force, and developed their own technology from it with which to begin waging war against the Skrulls. Kree aggression forces the Skrulls to become a militaristic civilisation, and the [[Kree-Skrull War]] continues for thousands of years with only brief interruptions.<ref>Avengers vol. 1, #133 - 134 (March - April 1975)</ref> About 100,000 years ago, the Skrull Throneworld was moved from Skrullos to the more central Tarnax IV.

The Skrull Empire eventually decides to conquer Earth, but fails to take into account the appearance of the modern [[superhero]]. As a result, the Skrulls are repeatedly drawn into conflicts with metahumans such as the Fantastic Four and the Avengers:

* An initial scouting party impersonates the Fantastic Four and attempts to have them incarcerated but are beaten through trickery.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #2</ref>

* In retaliation the Skrull Emperor Dorrek VII dispatches Kl'rt, a Skrull known as the [[Super-Skrull]] to Earth to defeat the Fantastic Four. Kl'rt possesses the powers of the entire Fantastic Four (in addition to shapeshifting and [[hypnotism]] ) and holds the team at bay until [[Mr. Fantastic]] discovers the source of his power.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #18 (September 1963)</ref>

* The Fantastic Four travel to Tarnax IV and find the Skrull responsible for the murder of Susan and Johnny Storm's father<ref>Fantastic Four vol. 1, #37</ref>

* A princess from [[Xandar]] accidentally teleports to Earth and draws the Fantastic Four into a war between Xandar and the Skrulls. The invasion of Xandar by the Skrulls is stalled and is  resolved several years later.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #204 - 209 and later ''Rom'' vol. 1, 324</ref>

* '''The Kree-Skrull War:''' The Kree Accuser [[Ronan]] wrests control of the Empire from the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and attacks the Skrulls, reigniting the [[Kree-Skrull War]]. The Avengers become involved once the Super Skrull kidnaps Captain Marvel, and in turn battle a Kree [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry]] robot, three of the original Skrulls that fought the Fantastic Four, [[SHIELD]] agents, rogue [[Inhumans]] and legions of Skrulls. The Supreme Intelligence ends the immediate conflict by revealing to Avengers' ally [[Rick Jones]] tha he has vast mental potential, which is then used to freeze all combatants in place. The Supreme Intelligence then announces that while the Kree and Skrulls have reached genetic dead ends, the human race displays incredible untapped potential.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #89 - 97</ref> Despite this development there is still bad blood between the Kree and the Skrulls, and years later the cosmic being the [[Watcher]] adjudicates over a duel between champions from both races: Colonel Bel-Dann of the Kree and Warlord Raksor of the Skrulls. Unfortunately, after one year of conflict the duel is deadlocked and is ultimately abandoned with no resolution.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, Annual #18</ref>

Ironically, it is revealed years later that the conflict actually produced a Kree-Skrull hybrid - Hulkling - who is the child of one-time lovers Captain Marvel and the Skrull princess Anelle.<ref>''Young Avengers'' vol. 1, #9 - 12</ref>

===Galactus and Zabyk's Disaster===

Years later Emperor Dorrek VII's wife, Empress R'klll, stages a coup and kills him to become ruling Empress herself.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #209 (August 1979)</ref> Empress R'klll's reign is short-lived, however, due to the arrival of the World Devourer [[Galactus]]. After his Herald [[Frankie Raye|Nova (Frankie Raye)]] annihilates the Skrull fleet, Galactus devours Tarnax IV, killing millions of Skrulls - including R'klll and the Princess Anelle.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #257</ref>

Galactus's consumption of Tarnax IV throws the entire Skrull Empire into disarray and [[civil war]]. Five warlords vie for leadership of the Empire and the ensuing conflict sparks the second Kree-Skrull War.<ref>Throughout ''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3, #1 - 31</ref>

It is during this time of civil war that the Skrulls Zabyk and Myrn detonate a genetic "hyperwave bomb" which prevents all Skrulls, everywhere in the universe,  from  shapeshifting, trapping them in whatever form they occupied at the time.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, Annual #14 (1985) & ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, Annual'' #19 (1985)</ref> The Skrull Empire is on the verge of collapse, until the [[Super-Skrull|Kl'rt the Super-Skrull]] is rescued from the [[Van Allen radiation belt]], where he had been trapped as a stream of dissociated particles. The Super Skrull is not affected as he is not in physical form at the time of detonation.

After reintegration, the Super Skrull joins forces with the [[Silver Surfer]], who introduces him to S'byll, one of the five claimants to the Skrull Throne. Using Kl'rt as a template, S'byll is able to regain her shapeshifting abilities and then to restore them to all Skrulls.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #25</ref> S'byll is then soon acclaimed as the new Empress by the Skrull race, and negotiates a truce with the Kree after defeating them in a decisive battle.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #31</ref>

===Setbacks===

Some time later a Skrull called [[Paibok]] mounts a campaign to invade Earth, using another Skrull called [[Lyja]] as an infiltrator. The plan, however, fails, and ends with the Fantastic Four destroying the "Skrull War World",  the Skrulls' largest attack ship.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #358</ref> This loss is compounded when the villain [[Devos the Devastator]] destroys the new Skrull Throneworld - which was established after Galactus devoured Tarnax IV.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #383</ref> S'byll is killed when the Throneworld is destroyed, causing the collapse of the Skrull Empire once more.

The Skrull Empire is also the first of the major interstellar empires to be invaded by the forces of [[Annihilus]]. The [[Annihilation Wave]] has laid waste to much of the Empire, with its superweapon, the Harvester of Sorrow, destroying dozens of Skrull planets.<ref>''Annihilation: Prologue'' (May 2006) and ''Annihilation'' : ''Super-Skrull'' #1 - 4 (June-September 2006)</ref>  After the war the Annihilation Wave's forces now control what it left of their Emipre, while the skrulls once in the trillions now only a few hundread are left.

befor this the Skrulls were attempting to convince [[Hulkling]] to become the new Emperor,<ref>''Young Avengers'' vol. 1, #9 - 12</ref> although this is opposed by the Baroness S'Bak, who wishes to take power herself.

==Appearance & abilities==

Skrulls are green-skinned [[reptile|reptilian]] [[humanoid]]s, of roughly the same height and weight as humans, with large pointed ears and corrugated chins. The Skrulls are known for their ability to [[shapeshift]], and are able to assume virtually any form, be it organic (eg.cows<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #2</ref>) or inorganic (eg. lamp<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #14</ref>). As a result, the Skrulls excel at spying and infiltration. Skrulls are also able to use their shapeshifting abilities to form weapons (eg. blades and clubs) with parts of their bodies, making them dangerous hand-to-hand combatants.

Courtesy of their advanced technology, the Skrulls have also been able to augment their abilities in certain warriors, such as the Super Skrull and Warskrulls - an elite group who with special encoding are able to emulate the powers as well as appearance of their templates.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1, #274 - 277</ref>

==Notable Skrull planets==
The Skrull empire is made up of several planets within the Andromeda Galaxy. The Kree warrior [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] once claimed that the Skrulls would trade fifty worlds to possess a certain Kree artifact, which is an indication as to the extent of their Empire.<ref>The Omni-Wave Projector, in ''Captain Marvel'' vol. 1, #51</ref>

Some of the planets under Skrull control include:
* Aks'lo <U+2014> paradisical vacation planet, destroyed by the [[Annihilation Wave]]<ref>Annihilation: Super-Skrull'' vol. 1, #1 (June 2006)</ref>

* Kral <U+2014> populated by Skrulls fascinated with the culture of [[1930s]] Earth and have attempted to replicate that time period. Skrull inhabitants of Kral maintain human rather than Skrull form.

* Satriani - Sometime after the destruction of Tarnax IV the homeworld was moved to Satriani after Satriani resident S'Byll assumed the role of empress with the aid of her lover the Super Skrull and the Silver Surfer.

* Skrullos <U+2014> original Skrull homeworld

* Tarnax IV <U+2014> former Skrull Throneworld, consumed by Galactus<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1,  #257</ref>

* Tarnax VII <U+2014> native planet of [[Xavin]], a Super Skrull in training. Was engaged in a war with non-Skrull planet Majesdane but have now both destoryed each other via anti-matter bombs.

* Zaragz'na <U+2014> home of the [[Super-Skrull]]'s son, destroyed by the Annihilation Wave<ref> ''Annihilation: Super-Skrull'' vol. 1, #3 (August 2006)</ref>

==Alternate versions==
===Ultimate Skrulls===

* The Skrulls are introduced as the '''Chitauri''', who attempt to conquer the [[Earth]] but are stopped by the [[Ultimates]].<ref>''Ultimates'' vol. 1 #8 - 13</ref> The more traditional Skrulls appear later, and identify the Chitauri as a subversive group of Skrull [[terrorism|terrorists]].<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #27 - 29</ref>

* The Ultimate Super-Skrull appears in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]''. At one point he is in fact the Skrull Emperor and also the oldest living Skrull (around one billion years old).<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #27 - 29</ref>

* The Skrullian Skymaster (real name Skymax) is a member of the [[Squadron Supreme]]. While created to be an alternate version of J'onn J'onzz, the [[Martian Manhunter]], it has been revealed that Skymax possesses abilities matching the Super Skrull from [[Earth-616]].<ref>''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' (1998)</ref>

==In other media==
* The Skrulls appear in several episodes of the [[Fantastic Four]] [[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|animated series]].

* The Chitauri appear in the animated movie ''[[Ultimate Avengers]]'' and the sequel, ''[[Ultimate Avengers 2]]''.

* The Skrulls appear as villains in the RPG video game [[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]].

*A Skrull is a leading character in the new Marvel Comic series '''"[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]"'''
