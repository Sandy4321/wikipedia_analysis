'''Antonio Carrizo''' (born '''Antonio Carozzi''', September 15, 1926) is a noted Argentine [[Radio in Argentina|radio]] and [[Television in Argentina|television]] presenter.
==Life and work==
Born in [[General Villegas]], in western [[Buenos Aires Province]], his first experience in broadcasting was during his teens at the helm of a [[transit media]] vehicle, from which he could be heard hawking ''Mejoral'', a [[paracetamol]] analgesic, in General Villegas and surrounding [[Pampas]] towns. He arrived in [[Buenos Aires]] following a year of [[military service]], and began on the radio as an ad announcer on Radio del Pueblo in 1948. He later co-hosted a program on ratings leader [[Radio Belgrano]] with [[Beatriz Taibo]], in which the duo became known for announcing advertisements in the form of a dialogue. Taibo, for example, might ask: ''"Traffic's at a standstill. What do you think happened?"'' to which Carrizo would answer ''"A [[Sunlight (cleaning product)|Sunlight]] girl must have walked by!"'' <ref name=carrizo>{{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.ar/_es/pais/personalidades/C2526-antonio-carrizo.php|title=Antonio Carrizo|publisher=Argentina en noticias}}</ref>

The [[radio theater]] producer at [[Radio El Mundo]], Julio C<U+00E9>sar Barton, hired Carrizo in 1949. He worked with leading names in Argentine radio at the time such as [[Nin<U+00ED> Marshall]], [[Tita Merello]], and [[Luis Sandrini]], eventually becoming the station's [[programming director]]. Remaining on the radio, Carrizo debuted on Argentine television in the 1950s on [[Canal 7 Argentina|Channel 7]], and in cinema as a radio presenter in [[Luis C<U+00E9>sar Amadori]]'s ''El barro humano'' (1955). Carrizo was hired by [[Canal 9 (Argentina)|Channel 9]] director [[Alejandro Romay]] to host ''S<U+00E1>bados Continuados'' in 1964. He returned to Channel 7 as host of ''Bienvenido S<U+00E1>bado'' (''Welcome, Saturday''), a [[variety show]] that aired in 1965, and in the 1970s hosted ''Primera de la Noche'' (''Top of the Evening''). Carrizo also appeared from 1966 on [[Radio Rivadavia]], which by then had become the nation's top radio network, working with [[Cacho Fontana]], [[H<U+00E9>ctor Larrea]], and [[Juan Carlos Mareco]], and in 1971 left El Mundo to become host of Rivadavia's ''La Vida y El Canto'' (''Life and Song'').<ref name=carrizo/> The urbane [[talk show]], which ran for twenty years, drew guests from [[Argentine music]], [[Cinema of Argentina|cinema]], and [[Argentine literature|literature]] (including [[Jorge Luis Borges]], with whom he taped ''Borges, el Memorioso'' in 1979), as well as foreign guests such as [[Italian cinema]] great [[Vittorio Gassman]].<ref name=eter>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/533057-antonio-carrizo-el-clasico-del-eter|title=Antonio Carrizo, el cl<U+00E1>sico del <U+00E9>ter|publisher=''La Naci<U+00F3>n''}}</ref> He also hosted ''C<U+00ED>clo Los Int<U+00E9>rpretes'' (''Performers' Series'') on Radio Rivadavia, devoted to [[folk music|folk]] and [[classical music]], and appeared as a recurring guest commentator on the popular [[Round table (discussion)|round table]] program ''Pol<U+00E9>mica en el F<U+00FA>tbol'' (''Controversies in [[Argentine Football]]''). Carrizo earned a [[Konex Award]] for his career as presenter in 1981.<ref name=konex>{{cite web|url=http://fundacionkonex.com.ar/b49-lI-Antonio-Carrizo|title=Antonio Carrizo|publisher=Fundaci<U+00F3>n Konex}}</ref>

Carrizo was named President of the Society of Argentine Bibliophiles, and of the Argentine Chess Federation.<ref name=ba>{{cite web|url=http://www.agenciacomunas.com.ar/nota.asp?notaid=66970|title=Antonio Carrizo recibi<U+00F3> la Medalla del Bicentenario|publisher=Agencia Comunas}}</ref>  The accomplished [[chess]] player counted among his friends Grand Master [[Bobby Fischer]]. Fischer visited Argentina often, and Carrizo's home hosted numerous matches between the two, as well as with other noted players such as [[Tigran Petrosian]] and [[Miguel Quinteros]]; during one such match, which Fischer and Quinteros played for money, the unpredictable Fischer repeatedly slammed the Japanese [[forest glass]] coffee table, prompting Carrizo to urge Quinteros to lower the stakes, ''"lest that son of a bitch break my table!"'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gente.com.ar/nota.php?ID=14150|title=En la vida, un ni<U+00F1>o inmaduro.
