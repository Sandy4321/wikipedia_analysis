By observing her conductor, she began to teach herself how to conduct and even collected [[Baton (conducting)|batons]]. Chen attended the [[Walnut Hill School]], a preparatory school affiliated with the [[New England Conservatory]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], starting at age sixteen. She continued her undergraduate and advanced degree work at the Conservatory and became the first student to graduate from the institution with a double [[master's degree]] in conducting and violin performance. Chen later obtained a [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degree from the [[University of Michigan]].

Chen became the [[Portland Youth Philharmonic]]'s fourth conductor in 2002. During her five-year tenure, the orchestra debuted at [[Carnegie Hall]], earned an [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] award in 2004 for innovative programming, and began collaborating with the [[Oregon Symphony]] and [[Chamber Music Northwest]]. She also served as assistant conductor of the Oregon Symphony from 2003 to 2005 and as cover conductor for the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]]. In 2005, Chen became the first woman to win the [[Malko Competition]], which recognizes young conductors. That same year she won the Taki Concordia Fellowship. Chen left the Philharmonic in 2007, to become assistant conductor of the [[Atlanta Symphony]]. Chen served as assistant conductor of the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]] for its 2009<U+2013>2010 season. She was appointed music director of the Memphis Symphony Orchestra; her three-year tenure began in September 2010. Chen also began serving as music director for the Chicago Sinfonietta during its 2010<U+2013>2011 season.

Chen remained in Boston for nine years until she attended the [[University of Michigan]] to obtain a [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degree in conducting.<ref name=Sinfonietta/><ref name=Memphis/><ref name=PYPPDF/> There she studied with Kenneth Kiesler and [[Martin Katz]], served as music director of the campus orchestras, and also became conductor for the Arbor Opera Theater.<ref name=PYPPDF/> Chen has admitted that she obtained the doctorate degree was because she was not receiving any job offers and that she questioned whether she was being rejected because she was "young, a woman, Asian, or combination of all three."<ref name=Chinchilla/><ref name=Patner/>

==Career==
In 2001, while attending the University of Michigan, Chen guest conducted the [[Toledo Symphony Orchestra]]'s "Halloween Spooktacular" concert.<ref name=Toledo/> That same year she was the youngest finalist in the [[Maazel-Vilar Conductor's Competition]] in Tokyo.<ref name=Malko>{{cite web|url=http://www.malkocompetition.com/about/previous-winners/mei-ann-chen|title=2005: Mei-Ann Chen|accessdate=October 1, 2011|publisher=Nordic Artists Management}}</ref> [[Leonard Slatkin]] invited Chen in 2002 to conduct the National Symphony at the [[Kennedy Center]] in the National Conducting Institute.

===Portland Youth Philharmonic===
Chen became the [[Portland Youth Philharmonic]]'s (PYP) fourth conductor in 2002 after being selected by a committee of "musically inclined" parents, a member of the orchestra, and representatives of the [[Oregon Symphony]] and [[Portland Opera]].<ref name=Bancud/> She conducted both the Philharmonic ensemble as well as the Conservatory Orchestra.<ref name=Bancud/> One board member of the organization recalled that during her audition Chen very quickly captured the rapport of the orchestra and displayed "wonderful communication skills and genuineness".<ref name=Bancud/>

{{Quote box|width=200px|quote="I pushed [musicians of the Portland Youth Philharmonic] quite hard, but at the same time I was doing that for them, they helped me find my own voice.

I couldn't have asked for more."|source=Chen on her role as conductor of the Philharmonic<ref name=Bartels/>}}

During her five-year tenure with the organization, PYP debuted at [[Carnegie Hall]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/features/story.php?story_id=26134|title=Orchestra conquers Carnegie|first=Eric|last=Bartels|work=Portland Tribune|publisher=Pamplin Media Group|accessdate=September 25, 2011|location=Portland, Oregon|date=September 10, 2004|pages=1<U+2013>2}}</ref> received its third [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] award in 2004 for innovating programming,<ref name=Sinfonietta/> and began collaborating with the Oregon Symphony (Chen was the ensemble's assistant conductor from 2003 to 2005) and [[Chamber Music Northwest]].<ref name=OEPYP>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/entry/view/portland_youth_philharmonic/|title=Portland Youth Philharmonic|first=James|last=McQuillen|accessdate=November 19, 2010|publisher=[[The Oregon Encyclopedia]]}}</ref> In April 2005 Chen became the first woman to win the [[Malko Competition]], the "world's most prestigious prize" for young conductors.<ref name=Bartels/><ref name=Baltimore>{{cite news|url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/classicalmusic/2010/08/baltimore_symphony_assistant_c.html|title=Baltimore Symphony assistant conductor Mei-Ann Chen gets Chicago post|date=August 4, 2010|accessdate=November 30, 2010|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|first=Tim|last=Smith|issn=1930-8965|location=Baltimore, Maryland}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=29484|title=Orchestra leader hits world radar|first=Eric|last=Bartels|work=Portland Tribune|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Pamplin Media Group|pages=1<U+2013>2|accessdate=September 25, 2011|date=April 19, 2005}}</ref> She also won the Taki Concordia Fellowship in 2007, an award established by [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]] music director [[Marin Alsop]] to support "promising" female conductors.<ref name=Baltimore/><ref name=Fleming>{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/performingarts/article512279.ece|title=Madcap touch just right for Tchaikovsky at Mahaffey Theater|first=John|last=Fleming|date=May 18, 2008|accessdate=September 25, 2011|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|location=St. Petersburg, Florida|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|oclc=5920090}}</ref> Chen was presented the Sunburst Award from Young Audiences for her contribution to music education and was named "Educator of the Week" by [[KKCW]].<ref name=Sinfonietta/><ref name=PYPPDF/>

While conductor of the Philharmonic, Chen set up a box in her office so that students could leave notes for her about themselves. One musician of the orchestra felt that Chen was "kind of formal" during rehearsal but felt "like a big sister" once practice ended. Chen has been described as a "firecracker: small, bright and full of ka-boom", and her enthusiasm at times caused her to lose her breath.<ref name=Bancud/> One board member of the organization praised Chen's attitude and felt that her lack of ego was a "rare quality in top symphony performers".<ref name=Bancud/> 

Chen turned down a position with the Oregon Symphony to continue work at PYP, later recalling: 

{{Quote|They became my kids, they were no way for me to give them up. So I made a very unusual decision. I gave up my professional position with the Oregon Symphony, I stayed with the youth orchestra. People thought that I was crazy that I stayed with a youth orchestra instead of pursing a more professional opportunity. Because I told you my life story, and a youth orchestra changed my life and gave me the chance to fulfill my dreams, I feel working with young musicians is a way for me to give back. It changed my life and I would like to do my part to change other people's lives.<ref name=Chinchilla/> }}
