'''Insane Clown Posse''' is an [[United States|American]] [[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[Duet (music)|duo]] from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].  The group is composed of [[Joseph Bruce]] and [[Joseph Utsler]], who perform under the respective personas of the "[[Evil clown|wicked clowns]]" '''''Violent J''''' and '''''Shaggy 2 Dope'''''.  Insane Clown Posse performs a style of [[hardcore hip hop]] known as [[horrorcore]] and is known for its elaborate live performances. The duo has earned two [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] and three gold albums.  According to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], the entire catalog of the group has sold 6.5&nbsp;million units in the United States and Canada as of April 2007.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSN0232707820070402|title=Insane Clowns prosper even as album sales wane|accessdate=2008-09-24|publisher=[[Reuters]]/''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''|date=April 2, 2007}}</ref>

Originally known as ''Inner City Posse'', the group introduced [[supernatural]]- and [[horror fiction|horror]]-themed lyrics as a means of distinguishing itself stylistically.  The duo founded the independent [[record label]] [[Psychopathic Records]] with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature films ''[[Big Money Hustlas]]'' and ''[[Big Money Rustlas]]''. They formed their own [[professional wrestling]] federation, [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]], and later collaborated with many well-known hip hop and [[rock music|rock]] musicians. The group has established a dedicated following, often referred to as [[Juggalo]]s.

The songs of Insane Clown Posse center thematically on the mythology of the [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival]], a metaphoric limbo in which the lives of the dead are judged by God. The Dark Carnival is elaborated through a series of [[Morality play|stories]] called Joker's Cards, each of which offers a specific lesson designed to change the [[sin|"evil ways"]] of listeners before "the end consumes us all."

==== Formation of the group ====
[[Joseph Bruce]] (Violent J) and [[Joseph Utsler]] (Shaggy 2 Dope) met in [[Oak Park, Michigan|Oak Park]], a suburb on the North border of [[Detroit, Michigan]]. Along with Utsler's brother, John, and friend, Lacy, they wrestled in [[backyard wrestling|backyard rings]] that they had built themselves.<ref name="BehindthePaint51">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=51<U+2013>61 |chapter=JJ Boys and The Royal Oak Township|year=2003|month=August }}</ref> In 1989, Joseph Bruce, as Jagged Joe, Joseph Utsler, as Kangol Joe, and John Utsler, as Master J, released the single titled "[[Party at the Top of the Hill]]" under the name of JJ Boys, but the group did not pursue a serious career in music.<ref name="BehindthePaint539">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=539<U+2013>540 |chapter=Complete Discography|year=2003|month=August }}</ref> Poverty and a difficult home life drove Bruce to move in with Rudy "The Rude Boy" Hill in [[River Rouge, Michigan|River Rouge]], a city near the industrial southwest side of Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint108">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=108<U+2013>111 |chapter=Rude Boy and the Magical Land of Toxic Waste|year=2003|month=August }}</ref>

Feeling a sense of home and belonging, Bruce formed a gang called Inner City Posse, which was composed of Joseph Utsler, Rudy Hill, other friends of Bruce, and a number of other connections he had made in Southwest Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint108"/> Bruce was jailed for ninety days in 1989<U+2013>1990 for death threats, robbery, and violating [[probation]];<ref name="BehindthePaint125">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=125<U+2013>132 |chapter=Intelligence and Violence|year=2003|month=August }}</ref> this experience convinced him to reduce his involvement in gang life.<ref name="BehindthePaint125"/> Bruce began his [[professional wrestling]] career after getting out of jail, and it was at his first show that he met [[Rob Van Dam]] and [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], two other first-timers with whom he became very good friends.<ref name="BehindthePaint125"/> During this time Bruce brought Utsler backstage with him, and all four became close friends.

Bruce became frustrated with the backstage politics of the wrestling business and began searching for another career.<ref name="BehindthePaint125"/> Back on the streets, Bruce began listening to hip hop with Utsler and with Utsler's brother, John. The trio performed at local night clubs, using the stage names Violent J, 2 Dope, and John Kickjazz, under the name of their gang, Inner City Posse.<ref name="BehindthePaint539"/> Seeing a need for a manager, Bruce's brother [[Robert Bruce (rapper)|Robert]] recommended his friend and record store owner Alex Abbiss, who established the [[Psychopathic Records]] record label with the group in 1991. Later that year the group released the self-produced [[Extended play|EP]] entitled ''[[Dog Beats]]''.<ref name="AMGHipHop">

After receiving jail sentences, the group members abandoned gang life.<ref name="BehindthePaint125"/>

In late 1991, the group invested more money into production than was covered by returns. The group decided that its [[gangsta rap]] style was the cause of the problem: Most emcees at the time used similar styles, making it difficult for Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically.<ref name="BehindthePaint174">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=174<U+2013>185 |chapter=The Dark Carnival|year=2003|month=August }}</ref> Referring to local rapper [[Esham]]'s acid rap style, Bruce suggested the band adapt this genre, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to rap openly about [[Satan]], which Esham often did.<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/>

After the change in musical style, the group decided it needed a new name. Utsler suggested keeping the "I.C.P." initials to inform the community that Inner City Posse was not defunct, an idea to which the group agreed.<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/> Several names were considered before Bruce recalled his dream of a clown running around in Delray, which became the inspiration for the group's new name: '''Insane Clown Posse'''. The other members agreed, deciding that they would take on this new genre and name, and would all don face paint due to the success of their former clown-painted [[hype man]].<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/>

Upon returning home that night, Bruce says he had a dream in which "spirits in a [[traveling carnival]] appeared to him"<U+2014>an image that would become the basis for the Dark Carnival mythology detailed in the group's Joker's Cards series.<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/>

==== ''Carnival of Carnage'' and ''Ringmaster'' ====
The group began recording their debut album, ''[[Carnival of Carnage]]'', with producer Chuck Miller. After recording only three songs for US$6,000 with Miller, Alex Abbiss made his first major managerial move by finding another producer, [[Mike E. Clark]].<ref name="BehindthePaint198">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=198<U+2013>208 |chapter=The Broken Path of a Dream|year=2003|month=August }}</ref> The group finished recording the album with Clark, who continued to work with them throughout their career. The album featured appearances from local rappers, including Esham and [[Kid Rock]].<ref name="AMGHipHop"/> Just weeks prior to the release of their album, John left the group because he felt that it was "taking up too much of [his] life."<ref name="BehindthePaint198"/> When Bruce and Utsler attempted to call a meeting to talk about the issues, John did not attend.<ref name="BehindthePaint198"/>

''Carnival of Carnage'' was released on October 18, 1992, with distribution within a {{convert|120|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint198"/> [[Allmusic]] reviewer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] compared the group's performance on the album to "a third-rate [[Beastie Boys]] supported by a cut-rate [[Faith No More]], all tempered with the sensibility that made [[GWAR]] cult heroes<U+2014>only with&nbsp;... more sexism and jokes that&nbsp;... wind up sounding racist."<ref name="AMGHipHop"/> The follow-up EP, ''[[Beverly Kills 50187]]'', sold well and gained a larger audience. During a live performance of the song "The Juggla", Bruce addressed the audience as ''Juggalos'', and the positive response resulted in the group using the word thereafter.<ref name="BehindthePaint231">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=237<U+2013>253 |chapter=Ringmaster's Word|year=2003|month=August }}</ref> The word has been the subject of criticism from both [[Ben Sisario]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and Allmusic's Erlewine, who suggested the term is similar to the racial slur ''[[List of ethnic slurs#J|jigaboo]].''<ref name="AMGHipHop"/><ref name="RSAlbumGuide">{{cite book |title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide |editor=Brackett, Nathan |year=2004 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |isbn=0743201698 |pages=405<U+2013>6 }}</ref>

The group's second studio album, ''[[Ringmaster (album)|Ringmaster]]'', was released on March 8, 1994, and its popularity enabled the group to sell out larger nightclubs across Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint231">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=231<U+2013>253 |chapter=Ringmaster's Word|year=2003|month=August }}</ref> Because Bruce and Utsler made reference to the Detroit-produced soft drink [[Faygo]] in their songs, they "figured it would be cool to have some on stage with [them]."<ref name="Brant"/> During a concert in 1993, Bruce threw an open bottle of Faygo at a row of concertgoers who were giving them [[Finger (gesture)|the finger]]. After receiving a positive response, Bruce and Utsler have since continued to spray Faygo onto audiences.<ref name="Brant"/> A subsequent national tour increased sales of the album,<ref name="BehindthePaint231"/> earning ''Ringmaster'' a [[Music recording sales certification|gold certification]].<ref name=RIAA>{{cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=Certification for Insane Clown Posse |accessdate=2008-05-05 |publisher=RIAA Gold and Platinum Certification Database}}</ref> The group's second EP, ''[[The Terror Wheel]]'', was released on August 5, 1994. One of the songs from the EP, "Dead Body Man", received considerable local radio play.<ref name="BehindthePaint231"/> The same year marked their first "Hallowicked" concert, which has since continued annually on [[Halloween]] night in Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint231"/>

=== Major releases (1995<U+2013>1997) ===
==== ''Riddle Box'' ====
In 1995, Bruce and Utsler attempted to obtain a contract with a major record label. The duo eventually signed a contract with the short-lived [[Jive Records]] sub-label [[Battery Records (dance)|Battery Records]],<ref name="BehindthePaint231"/> which released the group's third studio album, ''[[Riddle Box]]'', on October 10, 1995.<ref name="BehindthePaint552">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |page=552 |chapter=Complete Discography|year=2003|month=August }}</ref> After Battery/Jive Records showed little interest in promoting the album, Insane Clown Posse funded the promotion of ''Riddle Box'' independently. This effort led the group to [[Dallas, Texas]], where it persuaded several music retail stores to stock the album. Sales averaged 1,500 copies per week as a result.<ref name="BehindthePaint268">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=268<U+2013>269 |chapter=Fuck Jive|year=2003|month=August }}</ref>

==== ''The Great Milenko'' ====
Manager Alex Abbiss negotiated a contract with the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]]-owned label [[Hollywood Records]], which reportedly paid US$1&nbsp;million to purchase the Insane Clown Posse contract from Battery/Jive/BMG Records.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430332/19970703/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clowns Point The Finger At Disney |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=July 3, 1997 |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref> The group started recording its fourth studio album, ''[[The Great Milenko]]'', in 1996, during which Disney requested that the tracks "The Neden Game," "Under the Moon," and "Boogie Woogie Wu" be removed.

During a music store autograph signing, Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had recalled the album within hours of its release,<ref name="BehindthePaint306"/> despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching #63 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="Browne">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288784,00.html |title=Review of ''The Great Milenko'' |accessdate=2008-05-08 |last=Browne |first=David |date=July 25, 1997 |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430331/19970704/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Posse Angry At Disney's Decision |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=July 4, 1997 |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref> The group was also informed that its in-store signings and nationwide tour had been canceled, commercials for the album and the [[music video]] for "Halls of Illusions" (which had reached #1 on [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]] video request channel) were pulled from television, and that the group was dropped from the label.<ref name="BehindthePaint306"/> It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] at the time because of Disney's promotion of "Gay Days" at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]], in addition to presiding over the gay-themed television sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''.

==== Nationwide tour ====
Two days after the [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) program, Insane Clown Posse began its rescheduled nationwide tour with House of Krazees and Myzery. Their first concert, held in [[Orlando, Florida]], was hand-picked by Insane Clown Posse and free to the public.<ref name="BehindthePaint336">{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Bruce|coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey|title=ICP: Behind the Paint|origdate=|edition=2nd|publisher=Psychopathic Records|location=Royal Oak, Michigan|isbn=09741846083|pages=336<U+2013>349|chapter=Calling of the Road|year=2003|month=August}}</ref> Halfway through the tour, Brian Jones of House of Krazees had a falling out with his band members. Jones left the group, forcing House of Krazees to quit the tour.<ref name="BehindthePaint336"/>

The success of the tour enabled Bruce and Utsler to purchase new houses both for each other and for their families.<ref name="BehindthePaint330"/> Bruce even told his mother to quit her job because he would pay her expenses.<ref name="BehindthePaint353">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=353<U+2013>365 |chapter=Life on the Road|year=2003|month=August }}</ref>

==== Eminem feud ====
In late 1997, Bruce took Myzery to St. Andrew's Hall. [[Eminem]], then an unknown local emcee, approached Bruce and handed him a flyer advertising the release party for ''[[The Slim Shady EP]]''. The flyer read, "Featuring appearances by Esham, Kid Rock, and ICP (maybe)."<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Bruce asked why Eminem was promoting a possible Insane Clown Posse appearance without first contacting the group. Eminem explained, "It says 'maybe.' Maybe you will be there; I don't know. That's why I'm asking you right now. You guys comin' to my release party, or what?"<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Bruce, upset over not being consulted,  responded, "Fuck ''no'', I ain't coming to your party. We might have, if you would've asked us first, before putting us on the fuckin' flyer like this."<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Eminem took Bruce's response as a personal offense, subsequently attacking the group in radio interviews. Bruce and Utsler responded later in 1999 by releasing a parody of Eminem's "[[My Name Is]]" entitled "Slim Anus". Barbs between Insane Clown Posse and Eminem continued.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A19778 |title=''Juggalos Are Us: Get past the clown makeup, the violent lyrics and the sea of thrown soda and we're all about family, say Insane Clown Posse fan'' |accessdate=2008-05-31 |last=Meinzer |first=Melissa |date=November 9, 2006 |publisher=Pittsburgh City Paper}}</ref> However, Eminem and ICP have since reconciled.

==== The House of Horrors Tour ====
One month after ''ICP's Strangle-Mania Live'', Insane Clown Posse began their second nationwide tour, "The House of Horrors Tour", with Myzery added as one of the opening acts. While searching for the second opening act, Bruce received a telephone call at his home from former House of Krazees members [[Jamie Spaniolo]] and [[Paul Methric]], who told Bruce that the group was officially disbanded and asked to be on the tour.<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Spaniolo and Methric provided a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] containing three songs: "2nd Hand Smoke", "Diemotherfuckdie", and "How Does It Feel?"<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Bruce was extremely impressed, and immediately had a contract drafted with Psychopathic Records for the new group to sign. Bruce, Spaniolo, and Methric agreed on the band name [[Twiztid]]. The House of Horrors Tour thus featured Insane Clown Posse, with opening groups Twiztid, Myzery, and [[Psycho Realm]].<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/>

==== Legal troubles ====
On November 16, 1997, Bruce was arrested on an [[aggravated battery]] charge after allegedly striking an audience member thirty times with his [[microphone]] at a concert in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Bruce was held for four hours before being released on US$5,000 bail.<ref name="MTV-battery">{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430327/19971120/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Charged With Battery |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=November 20, 1997 |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref> The January 1998 issue of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine ran a four-page cartoon lampooning Insane Clown Posse and Juggalos, claiming that the group was offensive "not for their obscenity, but for their stupidity." ''Spin'' likened Insane Clown Posse's stage act to "a sort of circus karaoke" and portrayed the group's fans as overweight suburbanites. On the group's website, Bruce responded to the article by stating, "I could give a fuck less."<ref name="MTV-Spin">{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430325/19980107/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clowns Swing At "Spin" As Tour Nears |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=January 7, 1998 |publisher=[[MTV]] }}</ref>

After a show in [[Indianapolis]], Insane Clown Posse's tour bus stopped at a [[Waffle House]] in [[Greenfield, Indiana]]. When a customer began to harass Spaniolo and Bruce, a fight broke out between the customer and all of the bands' members.<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Months later on June 4, 1998, Bruce and Utsler pleaded guilty to misdemeanor [[disorderly conduct]] charges (reduced from [[battery (crime)|battery]]) in an Indiana court and were fined US$200 each.

By late 1998 over one million copies of ''The Great Milenko'' had been sold,<ref name="BehindthePaint414">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=414<U+2013>433 |chapter=Big Money Hustlas|year=2003|month=August }}</ref> and Insane Clown Posse was ready for its fifth album, ''[[The Amazing Jeckel Brothers]]''. Working with Mike E. Clark and Rich "Legs Diamond" Murrell, Bruce and Utsler developed their album with the highest of hopes. The group was known nationally, but were not taken very seriously. Hoping to receive the respect Bruce and Utsler felt they deserved, they planned to feature well-known, respected rappers on their album.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Bruce stated outright that he wanted to involve [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. They paid Snoop Dogg US$40,000 to appear on the song "The Shaggy Show." Snoop Dogg also helped them contact Ol' Dirty Bastard, who was paid US$30,000 for his appearance. Ol' Dirty Bastard recorded his track in a matter of two days; however, his recording consisted of nothing more than him rambling about "bitches."<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> It took Bruce and Utsler a week to assemble just four rhymes out of his rambling, and had to re-record the track and title it "Bitches."<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Finally, Insane Clown Posse contacted [[Ice-T]], who charged them only US$10,000.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> The group felt that Ice-T's song did not belong on the album, and was instead released on a later album, ''[[Psychopathics from Outer Space]]''.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/>

To help increase their positive publicity, the group hired the [[Nasty Little Man]] publicity team.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/>  The team set up a photo shoot for Insane Clown Posse that was to appear on the cover of ''[[Alternative Press]]'' magazine in Cleveland. On the set of the photo shoot, a member of the publicity team approached Bruce and explained that in the song "Fuck the World", the lyric that stated "Fuck the Beastie Boys and the [[Dalai Lama]]" needed to be changed.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Insulted, Bruce exclaimed that his music would not be censored again<U+2014>referring to Disney's previous requirement for censorship.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Nasty Little Man told Bruce that the Beastie Boys were not only clients of the company but also personal friends, and the Beastie Boys told the company to make Bruce change the lyric.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> In response, Bruce fired Nasty Little Man and asked its team to leave the photo shoot.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/>

''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' was released on May 25, 1999, and reached #4 on the ''Billboard'' album charts,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430318/19990603/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Posse Makes "Amazing" Top Five Debut |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=June 3, 1999 |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref> and has since been certified platinum by the [[RIAA]].<ref name=RIAA/> Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a "four out of five stars" rating, stating that "[Insane Clown Posse] actually delivered an album that comes close to fulfilling whatever promise their ridiculous, carnivalesque blend of [[Hardcore hip hop|hardcore hip-hop]] and [[Shock rock|shock-metal]] had in the first place".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:f9ftxqrkldje~T1 |title=Review of ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' |accessdate=2008-05-08 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' writer Barry Walters gave the album a "two out of five stars" rating, writing that "no musical sleight of hand can disguise the fact that Shaggy and J remain the ultimate wack MCs."<ref name="RSJeckelBros">{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/insaneclownposse/albums/album/120991/review/6068329/the_amazing_jeckel_brothers |title=Insane Clown Posse: The Amazing Jeckel Brothers: Music Reviews |accessdate=2007-12-26 |first=Barry |last=Walters |date=1999 |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071223012603/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/insaneclownposse/albums/album/120991/review/6068329/the_amazing_jeckel_brothers |archivedate = December 23, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> At the same time as ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers''' release, Island Records merged with [[Def Jam Records]].

==== ''Big Money Hustlas'' ====
On Insane Clown Posse's previous tour (The House of Horrors Tour), they had watched the movie ''Big Ballers''.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> The group, as well as Twiztid, loved the video. After Insane Clown Posse finished its ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' album, Bruce and Utsler decided to create their own movie, ''[[Big Money Hustlas]]'', with the same low-budget comedy style as ''Big Ballers''. Island Records gave them US$250,000 to begin work on the movie.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Bruce and Utsler were contacted by [[John Cafiero]], who said that he was a fan of Insane Clown Posse, and offered to direct the movie.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Insane Clown Posse asked Mick Foley to appear in the movie as "Cactus Sac", a parody of his "Cactus Jack" persona. Cafiero retained the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], [[Fred Berry]], and, at Bruce's request, [[Harland Williams]].<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> The script was written by Bruce, and filmed in New York City.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Bruce played a crime boss and Utsler portrayed a police detective.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:210371 |title=Overview for ''Big Money Hustlas'' |accessdate=2008-07-16 |first=Mark |last=Deming |publisher=[[Allmovie]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigmoneyhustlas.com/synop.html |title=Synopsis for ''Big Money Hustlas'' |accessdate=2008-07-16 |publisher=[[Psychopathic Records]] }}</ref> The stage crew members, who showed their dislike for Insane Clown Posse, were a source of contention. Despite the crew striking twice, the movie was filmed in two months.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/>

==== Woodstock 1999 ====
While on "The Asylum In-store Tour", Bruce and Utsler were informed by Abbiss that they were offered US$100,000 to perform at [[Woodstock 1999]].<ref name="BehindthePaint444">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=444<U+2013>455 |chapter=Buried Alive |year=2003|month=August }}</ref> They were excited about the offer, as it indicated their impact on the music industry. Some people perceived participating in Woodstock 1999 was a [[selling out|sell-out]] for the group; however, Bruce and Utsler disagreed. As Bruce explains, "[Woodstock] sold out the mainstream style for us! Woodstock never came to us and asked us to change one fuckin' thing about us or our show! They wanted ICP just as ICP is, and nothing else. If that ain't fresh, then I don't know what the fuck is!"<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/>

==== Amazing Jeckel Brothers Tour troubles ====
After Woodstock 1999, Insane Clown Posse began its "Amazing Jeckel Brothers Tour", along with musicians [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]], [[Krayzie Bone]], Twiztid, [[Mindless Self Indulgence]], and [[Coal Chamber]].<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Biohazard, Mindless Self Indulgence, Krayzie Bone, and Twiztid were well-received by audiences;<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> however, Coal Chamber was not. Insane Clown Posse fans were not purchasing tickets, as they did not like Coal Chamber.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> For the three shows that Coal Chamber played, there were multiple ticket refunds.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce and his brother, Rob, made the decision to eliminate Coal Chamber from the tour. After doing so, there were no tickets returned for the remainder of the tour dates.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce and Utsler claimed that Coal Chamber had been removed from the tour because of equipment problems, but later revealed the true reason for their actions on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', which aired August 19, 1999.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce continued by saying, "Nobody will tell you that, because everybody's afraid of your crumpet-ass bitch manager."<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Later that night, [[Howard Stern|Stern]] contacted Bruce and Utsler, asking them to appear on his show the following day to talk with Coal Chamber's manager, [[Sharon Osbourne]].<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/>

Before the show went on air, Osbourne bet Bruce and Utsler US$50,000 that Insane Clown Posse's next album would not even sell 200,000 copies<U+2014>a bet that Bruce accepted.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> On air Osbourne informed Bruce and Utsler that Coal Chamber filed a lawsuit for [[breach of contract]].<ref name="SternOsbourne">{{cite news |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5924396/insane_clown_posse_and_sharon_osbourne_battle_on_howard_stern_radio_show |title=Insane Clown Posse and Sharon Osbourne Battle on Howard Stern Radio Show |accessdate=2007-12-26 |last=Fischer |first=Blair R |date=August 20, 1999 |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080112093429/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5924396/insane_clown_posse_and_sharon_osbourne_battle_on_howard_stern_radio_show |archivedate = January 12, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Osbourne stated that her group was to receive US$12,500 per show for a scheduled two-month package tour. Bruce reiterated that Coal Chamber's music did not appeal to Insane Clown Posse fans, and that ticket refunds decreased after Coal Chamber had been removed from the tour.<ref name="SternOsbourne"/> Osbourne then made public the bet with Bruce about Insane Clown Posse's next album, also stating that the duo would be subsequently dropped from their distributor. In Osbourne's words, "You're dead. Your career is over."<ref name="SternOsbourne"/> Bruce predicted that the group's next album would sell at least 500,000 copies;<ref name="SternOsbourne"/> however, the bet officially stood at 200,000 copies as agreed by both Bruce and Osbourne backstage.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/>

Two music videos were released from the albums: "Tilt-a-Whirl," from ''Bizaar,'' and "[[Let's Go All the Way (song)|Let's Go All The Way]]," a cover of a [[Sly Fox (band)|Sly Fox]] song from ''Bizzar.''

On November 5, 2002, Insane Clown Posse released their eighth studio album, ''[[The Wraith: Shangri-La]]'', which debuted at #15 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and #1 on the Top Independent Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=326&cfgn=Albums&cfn=Top+Independent+Albums&ci=3048322&cdi=7956457&cid=02%2F01%2F2003 |title=Charts for ''The Wraith: Shangri-La'' |accessdate=2008-05-09 |publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' }} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref> The album was notable for its explicit acknowledgment of ICP's [[Insane Clown Posse#Spirituality|belief in God]].

According to Bruce, "Some people might've been upset by [spiritual themes in ''The Wraith: Shangri-La''], but through our eyes all we did was touch a lot of people.

Something we might've done once in '94 at St. Andrew's Hall, we can go back again and now do it nationwide-style."<ref name="Dominic"/>

On tour following the release of ''Carnival of Carnage'', Insane Clown Posse was scheduled to perform at Ferris State University in [[Big Rapids, Michigan]]. After the group was announced by their manager, Alex Abbiss, Bruce remembers that "[w]e came out with no microphones or nothing; we were just right up in the people's faces. Shaggy and I were just fuckin' yelling over our own cassette. The people were staring at us in amazement and bewilderment. They must have been in shock and awe. We finished our two-song set, and the crowd&nbsp;... didn't cheer or boo. They just stood there, stunned."<ref name="Brant"/>

The group was unable to bring the large amounts of Faygo needed for their concerts to their European tours without a sales permit [[Visa (document)|visa]] because [[customs]] believed that the group had intended to sell the soda at their concerts.<ref name="BehindthePaint387"/> As a result, the group's European record label purchased similar quantities of another soda and created fake Faygo stickers to label the bottles. According to Bruce, "The craziness was this: they were not the regular two-liter bottles we're used to; they were some other amount&nbsp;... maybe one-and-a-half-liter bottles. Over there, they make their plastic bottles taller and thinner.&nbsp;... when you're doing what we do with them<U+2014>that makes a world of difference."<ref name="Brant"/> During a performance in England, Bruce recounts that he "rocketed one of them bottles off my foot and that motherfucker shot straight up and out like a guided [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot missile]], right towards the [[disco ball]] high above the crowd.&nbsp;... The bottle nailed the disco ball, and&nbsp;... came falling down&nbsp;... on top of some English kid's head.&nbsp;... We must've knocked fifteen or twenty people flat-out cold on that tour&nbsp;... Shaggy and I both had black eyes and several injuries and bruises ourselves from them things hittin' us."<ref name="Brant"/>

Bruce and Utsler did not expect many of their fans to attend Woodstock 1999, and were surprised when thousands of people chanted "I-C-P! I-C-P!" as they waited for the group to perform.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce told his stage crew that he would pay US$2,000 to each person who ran around the stage naked, and two people took up his offer. Insane Clown Posse also brought naked women on stage.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce and Utsler felt that because the tickets to the event were over-priced, they needed to "give something back."<ref name="Brant"/> According to Bruce, "We brought along these big beach balls. We announced to the crowd that they each had a hundred dollars taped to them, and then we proceeded to kick about thirty of them into the crowd. Then we rolled out these bigger giant-ass beach balls and announced, 'These ones have five hundred bucks taped to them!' We booted a gang of them into the human sea."<ref name="Brant"/><ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce also recounts that their set had multiple technical problems, and the audience was not allowed to get close to the stage, which made the duo feel less connected with them.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/>

The group's 2009 tour in support of ''Bang! Pow! Boom!'' featured clowns, [[showgirls]], a [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] and caged "attractions", including "Ape Boy".<ref name="Sculley">{{cite news |title=''Insane Clown Posse gets topical on latest CD'' |first=Alan |last=Sculley |url=http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20091204/ENTERTAINMENT01/91201031/Insane-Clown-Posse-gets-topical-on-latest-CD |newspaper=[[Courier News (New Jersey)|Courier News]] |date=December 4, 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=''Review: ICP show blends family with Faygo'' |first=Danielle |last=Hatch |url=http://www.pjstar.com/news/x819331739/Review-ICP-show-blends-family-with-Faygo  |newspaper=[[Peoria Journal Star]] |date=December 12, 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-12 }}</ref> According to Bruce, "This is actually the biggest tour we've ever brought out, as far as stage theatrics and extras on stage&nbsp;... We've got a whole circus. We're touring clubs and theaters, but it's more like an arena show. It's like an arena concert packed into a club."<ref name="Sculley"/>

===Spirituality===
The themes of God's presence and the final judgment of individuals are explored in multiple Insane Clown Posse songs. Throughout their career, the group has used parables set within the Dark Carnival mythology to warn of the ultimate consequences of immoral behavior.<ref name="Dominic"/><ref name="Ronson">{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/oct/09/insane-clown-posse-christians-god |title=Insane Clown Posse: And God created controversy |author=Jon Ronson |date=2010-10-09 |publisher= |accessdate=15 October 2010}}</ref> Their 2002 album ''[[The Wraith: Shangri-La]]'', which ended the first set of Joker Card albums, explicitly revealed that the hidden message of ICP's music was always to follow [[God]].<ref name="BehindthePaint504"/><ref name="Dominic"/><ref name="Ronson"/> Joseph Bruce remarked that "The ending of the Joker Cards, the way we looked at it, was death. Heaven and hell. That's up to each and every juggalo [to decide]."<ref name="Dominic"/> 

Several journalists have commented on the apparent conflict between the group's sexualized and often violent lyrics and their stated spiritual message.<ref name="Sculley"/><ref name="Ronson"/> In a June 2010 interview with [[The Columbian]]'s Alan Sculley, Bruce explained, "[Sex and violence is] the stuff that people are talking about on the streets...to get attention, you have to speak their language. You have to interest them, gain their trust, talk to them and show you're one of them. You're a person from the street and speak of your experiences. Then at the end you can tell them God has helped me out like this and it might transfer over instead of just come straight out and just speak straight out of religion."<ref name="Sculley"/>

In an October 2010 article for [[The Guardian]], [[Jon Ronson]] characterized the Insane Clown Posse as "evangelical Christians" who have "only been pretending to be brutal and sadistic to trick their fans into believing in God."<ref name="Ronson"/> In an interview with ICP conducted for the article, two of Ronson's queries referred parenthetically to ICP's "Christian message" and to the members' identities as "[secret] Christians." Neither Bruce nor Utsler challenged these assertions. Several papers, including [[The Washington Post]], published summaries of Ronson's claims.<ref name="WaPo">{{cite web |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/clicktrack/2010/10/polls_insane_clown_posse_serio.html |title=Polls: Insane Clown Posse: Serious about being Christians, or having a Joaquin Phoenix moment? |author=Allison Stewart |date=2010-10-12 |accessdate=1 November 2010}}</ref>

Eight days after publication of the Guardian article, Joseph Bruce tweeted "I think [it's] crazy how some press say we're a christian band and act like we're all religious [...] I'm proud that we believe in God but I haven't been to church since I was like 10.

In a 2009 interview with the [[Metro Times]], Bruce contended that Insane Clown Posse is "not an ultra-religious group. I don't go to church or anything. I like to believe in God."<ref name="Dominic"/> Joseph Utsler explained in a 2002 interview with Craig Markley that "God is in your heart [...] In my definition, it doesn<U+2019>t matter what creed, religion, or group you belong to. If you<U+2019>re doing what<U+2019>s right and are a good person, then you're right with God."<ref name="Markley">{{cite web | url = http://www.publicitywhore.com/pwblast28/OTW/shaggy.html | title = "Musician of the Week: Insane Clown Posse" | first = Craig | last = Markley | accessdate = 2010-10-26}}</ref>
