'''Owen Stanley Range''' is the south-eastern part of the central mountain-chain in [[Papua New Guinea]]. It was seen in 1849 by Captain [[Owen Stanley]] while surveying the south coast of Papua and named after him. Strictly, the eastern extremity of the range is [[Mount Victoria, Papua New Guinea|Mount Victoria]] {{Convert|4072|m|ft|0}}, which was climbed by Sir [[William Macgregor]] in 1888, and it extends as far west as [[Mount Thynne|Mounts Thynne]] and [[Mount Lilley|Lilley]]. But the name is generally used to denote the whole of the chain from [[Mount Chapman, Papua New Guinea|Mount Chapman]] {{Convert|3376|m|ft|0}} to the south-eastern end of the island, and to include [[Mount Albert Edward, Papua New Guinea|Mount Albert Edward]] {{Convert|3990|m|ft|0|abbr=on|abbr=on|abbr=on}} which is really separated from it by the Wharton Chain.

The range is flanked by broken and difficult country, particularly on the south-western side. There are few practicable passes, the easiest being the famous [[Kokoda Track]] which crosses the range between [[Port Moresby]] and Buna and was in use for more than 50 years as a regular overland mail-route. Vehicular roads, though not impossible, would be very difficult and expensive to construct. In fact one was constructed during [[World War II]] crossing from [[Wau]] in the north to Bulldog in the south and known as the [[Bulldog track]]. It was largely due to the impossibility of transporting heavy equipment across the range that the Japanese failed to secure Port Moresby as a base early in 1942. The mountains are rough and precipitous, with occasional fertile plateaux which are occupied by native food-gardens.
