'''Derek George Riordan''' (born [[16 January]] [[1983]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who currently plays for [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].

==Club career==
===Hibernian===
Riordan signed for [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibs]] in 2000 and made his debut the following year. It took a few years for Riordan to establish himself in the first team, and he spent a brief spell on loan at [[Cowdenbeath F.C.|Cowdenbeath]] in January 2003. He was finally given an opportunity towards the end of the 2002&ndash;03 season, as Hibs finished in the bottom half of the [[Scottish Premier League]]. He took this opportunity well, and he was the club's top goalscorer for each of the next three seasons, with 18, 23 and 20 goals respectively. This success earned him recognition in the form of the [[Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year]] award in 2005, and selections for the full [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] international squad during 2005. 

At the end of the [[2004-05 in Scottish football|2004&ndash;05]] season, Riordan rejected an offer of an extension to his contract, and Hibs decided to place him on the transfer list. In August 2005, a <U+00A3>1 million fee was agreed between the clubs for his transfer to [[Football League]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], but Riordan rejected the move. Riordan caused controversy when he appeared in a video making "[[racist]] chants" about [[Rudolf Sk<U+00E1>cel|Rudi Sk<U+00E1>cel]], who was then a [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] player. The video, which was recorded by a fan using a mobile phone, involved singing a song to the tune of [[The Beatles]]' [[Yellow Submarine]] about Sk<U+00E1>cel being a "[[refugee]]". (Sk<U+00E1>cel is from the [[Czech Republic]].) Riordan later apologised for the incident.<ref>[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16411029&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=hibs-star--i-m-sorry-for-racist-jibe-name_page.html Daily Record story]</ref> During the January 2006 transfer window, [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] had a bid turned down for Riordan worth <U+00A3>450,000 on transfer deadline day [[January 31]] [[2006]]. Two bids from foreign clubs were accepted, but Riordan rejected these potential moves.

===Celtic===
Riordan signed for Celtic in a <U+00A3>200,000 deal in June 2006. The fee was reduced from the previous offers because Riordan's contract with Hibs was due to expire in October 2006, and Riordan had already made a pre-contract agreement to sign for Celtic on a free transfer in January 2007. Riordan has had difficulty obtaining a place in the Celtic side. As of [[October 4]] [[2006]], he had only played three minutes in league matches for Celtic out of a possible 810. He has sometimes even not been selected as a substitute. He finally made his full debut for Celtic against [[St Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] in the [[Scottish League Cup|CIS Cup]], as [[Gordon Strachan]] fielded a side containing many players who are not first team regulars. Riordan has publicly aired his disappointment at not being given more opportunities in the Celtic first team, and speculated that he may move to another club in order to play regularly. In August 2008, Hibernian lodged an official bid to Celtic to bring Riordan back to Hibs on loan, which was rejected by the Celtic Heirarchy.
