'''Jos<U+00E9> Antonio Romualdo Pacheco Jr.''' (October 31, 1831{{ndash}} January 23, 1899) was an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] and [[diplomat]]. Involved in [[California]] state and federal politics, Pacheco was elected and appointed to various posts and offices throughout his more than thirty-year career, including the [[California State Senate]], the [[List of Governors of California|12th]] [[Governor of California]], and three terms in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Pacheco remains the only [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] governor in the state's history as part of the U.S. He was also the state's first California-born governor.<ref>[http://governors.library.ca.gov/12-Pacheco.html Governors of California Biography]</ref> Pacheco represented California in the United States House of Representatives from March 4, 1877 to February 7, 1878, and from March 4, 1879 to March 3, 1883. He was the first Hispanic Representative from a U.S. state; several others had previously served as [[delegate]]s for [[United States territory|U.S. territories]] and as such did not have full [[voting]] privileges.

==Early life==
Jos<U+00E9> Antonio Romualdo Pacheco, Jr. was born in [[Santa Barbara, California]] to a prominent [[Alta California]] family. His father, Captain Jos<U+00E9> Antonio Romualdo Pacheco, had moved to California from [[Guanajuato]], [[Mexico]] in 1825, and served as an aide to Governor [[Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a de Echeand<U+00ED>a]]. Captain Pacheco was killed at the [[Battle of Cahuenga Pass]] in 1831, when the young Romualdo was just five weeks old. His mother, Maria Ramona Carrillo de Pacheco, was a sister-in-law of General [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], and a daughter of Maria Ygnacia Lopez de Carrillo, the grantee of [[Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa]].  After the death of his father, Romualdo's mother married Captain John D. Wilson, a [[Scotland|Scotsman]], who sent Pacheco to [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] for his [[education]].

At age twelve, Pacheco began an [[apprenticeship]] aboard a [[trade|trading]] [[ship|vessel]]. The [[Mexican-American War]] broke out two years later, and he was briefly held by American forces on one trip in July 1846 as he brought cargo to [[Yerba Buena (town)|Yerba Buena]] (which is now [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]). The ship he was on was searched, and he made an oath of allegiance to the United States and was released.

==Politics==
Pacheco's association with a prominent family in the state helped him to gain support as he entered politics in the 1850s. He was also well respected by [[Anglo]]s coming into the area. Early in his political career in the 1850s, he was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. He became affiliated with the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] in the 1860s, but was elected to most of his positions as a candidate for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

He was [[election|elected]] to the [[California State Senate|state senate]] in 1857 and re-elected two times, serving until 1863. During the [[American Civil War]] Pacheco was appointed the rank of [[brigadier general]] by Governor [[Leland Stanford]] and directed to disarm military companies in the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] area that were not loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].

Pacheco served as state [[treasurer]] from 1863 to 1867, then returned to the State Senate until becoming Lieutenant Governor. He served as [[Lieutenant Governor of California]] under [[Newton Booth]] until Booth was elected to the [[United States Senate]] in 1875. Pacheco then served as Governor from February 27, 1875 to December 9, 1875, when Lieutenant Governor [[William Irwin (California politician)|William Irwin]], winner in the September elections that year, was inaugurated.

After briefly serving as Governor, Pacheco ran for a U.S. House seat, defeating incumbent [[Peter D. Wigginton]] by just one vote. Wigginton contested the election, eventually forcing Pacheco to leave in 1878 when the [[United States House Committee on Elections|House Committee on Elections]] refused Pacheco's certificate of election. Returning to California, he went into [[business]] until winning a House seat again in September 1879. He was reelected in 1880.

After leaving Congress, Pacheco lived on a [[cattle]] [[ranching|ranch]] in the northern [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Coahuila]] for five years until appointed U.S. [[Diplomatic rank|Minister]] to [[Central America]] in 1890. He returned to California in 1893, and died in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] in 1899. He is buried in Oakland's [[Mountain View Cemetery (Oakland, California)|Mountain View Cemetery]].

==Family life==
In 1863 he married Mary McIntire, a 22-year-old playwright. They had two children, Maybella Ramona (b. 1865), and Romualdo, who died in childhood. In 1889 Maybella married Will Tevis, the son of a powerful business family, in San Francisco. Maybella and Will would give Romualdo and Mary Pacheco four grandsons.
