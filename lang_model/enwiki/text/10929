The '''Black Duck Joint Venture''' is a [[Conservation movement|conservation]] partnership established in 1989 to stabilize and restore the population of the [[American Black Duck]] (''Anas rubripes'').{{sfn|Delta Waterfowl Foundation}}{{sfn|Ducks Unlimited Canada}} It consists of government and non-governmental agencies and organizations in Canada and the United States.{{sfn|Black Duck Joint Venture: What is the BDJV}} Its geographical scope is the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and the 23 [[U.S. state]]s in the [[Atlantic Flyway|Atlantic]] and [[Mississippi Flyway]]s.{{sfn|North American Waterfowl Management Plan}}{{sfn|Black Duck Joint Venture: What is the BDJV}} It was the first of the three species joint ventures operating within the [[North American Waterfowl Management Plan]] to be established.{{sfn|Black Duck Joint Venture: What is the BDJV}}

==Structure and funding==
The joint venture has a [[board of directors|management board]] consisting of eleven members "with representation from Canadian and U.S. wildlife agencies".{{sfn|United States Geological Survey: Black Duck Joint Venture Strategic Plan}} It is advised by a technical board composed of waterfowl biologists, which is responsible for project implementation and progress evaluation.
{{sfn|Sands|DeMaso|Schnupp|Brennan|2012|p=169}}{{sfn|United States Geological Survey: Black Duck Joint Venture Strategic Plan}} Members are also organized into [[working group]]s representing each program in its scope.{{sfn|Sands|DeMaso|Schnupp|Brennan|2012|p=169}} Its current coordinator is Brigitte Collins.{{sfn|United States Fish and Wildlife Service}}

The management board reports to the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, and is responsible for "overall program coordination, and for developing funding and delivery mechanisms".{{sfn|United States Geological Survey: Black Duck Joint Venture Strategic Plan}} The Black Duck Joint Venture receives some of its funding from research grants. From 1989 to 1994, it had an operational budget of about [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] $870,000.{{sfn|Milton|1994}}

==Programs==
The efforts of American Black Duck researchers in Canada and the United States is coordinated via the Black Duck Joint Venture, including research related to "monitoring, population dynamics, harvest management and ecological requirements".{{sfn|van der Linde|Danskin|1998|p=150}} The current science coordinator is Patrick Devers.{{sfn|United States Fish and Wildlife Service}}

The joint venture has conducted banding and survey programs in cooperation with other organizations, for which data collected is used in harvest management.{{sfn|North American Waterfowl Management Plan}} The program led to more restrictive harvest regulations in the 1980s, which has led to the stabilization of American Black Duck populations in some areas and recovery in others.{{sfn|Ducks Unlimited Canada}}

In 1990, the venture began "large-scale aerial surveys of breeding populations" of all species of eastern ducks and some other species to identify trends in breeding populations of those species.{{sfn|Environment Canada: Hinterland Who's Who}} This consisted of [[helicopter]] surveys in southern Quebec and throughout the [[Maritime Provinces]].{{sfn|Wells|2010|p=56}} Breeding ground surveys have also been conducted.{{sfn|Milton|1994}} from the mid 1990s to 2002, the number of breeding pairs in Quebec had more than doubled to 396,000.{{sfn|Wells|2010|p=56}}

It was a participant in the American Black Duck Mapping Project conducted at [[Mount Allison University]] in conjunction with [[Ducks Unlimited Canada]], the [[Canadian Wildlife Service]], and other government organizations.{{sfn|Lieske}} This research collected data about Black Duck populations in [[Atlantic Canada]] to complement previous research by the [[Eastern Habitat Joint Venture]].{{sfn|Lieske}}

Other research partners include the [[Patuxent Wildlife Research Center]].{{sfn|United States Geological Survey}}

In the United States, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] has purchased wintering, [[Bird migration|staging]] and breeding [[habitat]]s of the American Black Duck (and other species), which it manages to encourage population recovery.{{sfn|Wells|2010|p=57}} This includes over {{convert|1000|acres|km2|0}} of [[wetland]]s at [[Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge]].{{sfn|Wells|2010|p=57}}
