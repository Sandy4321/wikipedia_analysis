In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Utah]], [[U.S. Route 89]] is a long north-south [[state highway]] through the central part of the state. Between [[Provo, UT|Provo]] and [[Brigham City, UT|Brigham City]], US-89 serves as a local road, paralleling [[Interstate 15 (Utah)|Interstate 15]], but the portions from [[Arizona]] north to Provo and Brigham City northeast to [[Wyoming]] serve separate corridors. The former provides access to several [[national park (US)|national park]]s and [[Arizona]], and the latter connects I-15 with [[Logan, UT|Logan]], the state's only [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] not on the Interstate.<ref>[[U.S. Census Bureau]], [http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/List1.txt Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas and Components], December 2006, accessed May 2008</ref>

===Arizona border to I-70===
[[Image:US 89 Kane County.jpg|thumb|left|US-89 near [[Long Valley Junction, Utah|Long Valley Junction]], a [[Utah Scenic Byway]]]]
US-89 enters Utah from the south inside the [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]], about 7 miles (11 km) north of the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], where it crosses the [[Colorado River]] near [[Page, Arizona]]. After leaving the recreation area and passing the small town of [[Big Water, Utah|Big Water]], the highway curves west through the [[Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument]]. US-89 stays near the monument's southern boundary,<ref>[[Bureau of Land Management]], [http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ut/grand_staircase-escalante/misc.Par.74354.Image.-1.-1.1.gif Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument map], accessed May 2008</ref> crossing the [[East Clark Bench]] and [[The Cockscomb]] and passing south of the [[Vermilion Cliffs]] of the [[Grand Staircase]]. At the city of [[Kanab, UT|Kanab]], US-89 meets the north end of [[US-89A (UT)|US-89A]], an [[alternate route]] south into Arizona, and abruptly turns north and begins climbing the staircase. Here the Mt. Carmel Scenic Byway begins; one of the [[Utah Scenic Byways]], it stretches north to [[SR-12 (UT)|SR-12]] at [[Bryce Canyon Junction, Utah|Bryce Canyon Junction]].<ref name=admin>[[Utah Administrative Code]], [http://www.rules.utah.gov/publicat/code/r926/r926-007.htm Rule R926-7: Scenic Byways], as in effect on [[April 1]], [[2008]], accessed May 2008</ref> The Vermilion Cliffs are ascended via the canyon carved by [[Kanab Creek]]. Near the [[White Cliffs (Jurassic)|White Cliffs]], US-89 meets [[SR-9 (UT)|SR-9]] at [[Mt. Carmel Junction, Utah|Mt. Carmel Junction]], where travelers can turn to reach [[Zion National Park]]. The final "step" is the [[Pink Cliffs]], where the highway follows alongside the [[Virgin River]] to the highest point on US-89 in southern Utah and the east end of [[SR-14 (UT)|SR-14]], a summit at [[Long Valley Junction, Utah|Long Valley Junction]] ([[elevation]] 7450 feet/2300 m).<ref name=maps>[[Google Maps]] street maps and [[USGS]] [[topographic map]]s, accessed May 2008 via [http://mapper.acme.com/ ACME Mapper]</ref>

[[Image:US 89 near I-70.jpg|thumb|Looking south from [[Sevier, UT|Sevier]] towards the [[Sevier Canyon]]]]
North from Long Valley Junction, US-89 descends through the valley of the [[Sevier River]], meeting [[SR-12 (UT)|SR-12]], a [[scenic highway]] that leads to [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], at [[Bryce Canyon Junction, Utah|Bryce Canyon Junction]], [[SR-143 (UT)|SR-143]] in [[Panguitch, UT|Panguitch]], and [[SR-20 (UT)|SR-20]] at [[Bear Valley Junction, Utah|Bear Valley Junction]]. As the highway continues north, the valley narrows significantly into the [[Circleville Canyon]] before opening out near the town of [[Circleville, UT|Circleville]]. In this part of the valley, the Sevier River is [[dam]]med to create the [[Piute Reservoir]], and US-89 meets [[SR-62 (UT)|SR-62]] near [[Kingston, UT|Kingston]]. North of [[Marysvale, UT|Marysvale]], the valley again narrows into the [[Sevier Canyon]], which carries the river to its confluence with [[Clear Creek (Utah)|Clear Creek]] and US-89 to its [[overlap (road)|overlap]] with [[Interstate 70 (Utah)|Interstate 70]], beginning at [[Sevier, UT|Sevier]].<ref name=maps/>

===I-70 to the Wasatch Front===
Although US-89 follows the I-70 [[freeway]] from Sevier to [[Salina, UT|Salina]], the old alignment can still be driven, and is state-maintained north of [[Elsinore, UT|Elsinore]] as [[SR-258 (UT)|SR-258]], [[SR-118 (UT)|SR-118]] (which overlaps [[Interstate 70 Business (Richfield, Utah)|I-70 Business]] through [[Richfield, UT|Richfield]]), [[SR-24 (UT)|SR-24]], and [[US-50 (UT)|US-50]]. Both highways stay mainly in the west half of the Sevier River's valley, with the faster I-70/US-89 bypassing the communities that the surface road passes through. Just south of [[Salina, UT|Salina]], I-70 curves to the east, rising alongside [[Salina Creek]], and US-89 exits into downtown Salina, where it rejoins its pre-freeway alignment. [[US-50 (UT)|US-50]] overlaps US-89 between I-70 and Salina, following I-70 east and a separate alignment northwest from the area; the short [[Interstate 70 Business (Salina, Utah)|Interstate 70 Business]] also uses this roadway as a [[business spur]] from I-70 to the city. North of Salina, US-89 bypasses [[Redmond, UT|Redmond]] ([[SR-256 (UT)|SR-256]] follows the former route through the town) and passes through [[Centerfield, UT|Centerfield]] to [[Gunnison, UT|Gunnison]], where it meets [[SR-28 (UT)|SR-28]] and finally turns away from the Sevier River.<ref name=maps/>

At Gunnison, US-89 turns east before curving northeast into the [[Sanpete Valley]], formed by the [[San Pitch River]], a tributary of the Sevier River. Along US-89 in this valley are several small cities: [[Manti, UT|Manti]], [[Ephraim, UT|Ephraim]], [[Mount Pleasant, UT|Mount Pleasant]], and [[Fairview, UT|Fairview]]. Between Ephraim and Mount Pleasant, US-89 meets the south end of [[SR-132 (UT)|SR-132]] at [[Pigeon Hollow Junction, Utah|Pigeon Hollow Junction]]. SR-132 was formerly [[U.S. Route 189 (1920s)|US-189]], connecting US-89 with [[US-91 (UT)|US-91]] in [[Nephi, UT|Nephi]]. Beyond Fairview, where the scenic [[SR-31 (UT)|SR-31]] turns east, US-89 climbs out of the valley, reaching a summit at [[Hill Top, Utah|Hill Top]] (elevation 6400 feet/2000 m). [[Thistle Creek]] parallels the next leg of the highway, descending through a canyon to the junction with [[US-6 (UT)|US-6]] near the [[ghost town]] of [[Thistle, UT|Thistle]], flooded by a [[landslide]] in 1983. Thistle Creek and [[Soldier Creek]], paralleled by US-89 and US-6, merge near this junction to form [[Spanish Fork (Utah)|Spanish Fork]], which the [[overlap (road)|overlap]]ped routes follow northwest through [[Spanish Fork Canyon]] into the [[Utah Valley]] at [[Moark Junction, Utah|Moark Junction]]. US-89 splits to the north from US-6 there, skirts the west edge of [[Mapleton, UT|Mapleton]], and merges with [[SR-51 (UT)|SR-51]] - the old [[Arrowhead Trail (auto trail)|Arrowhead Trail]] ([[US-91 (UT)|US-91]]) - south of downtown [[Springville, UT|Springville]].<ref name=maps/>

===Wasatch Front===
[[Image:Utah State Capitol seen from State Street.jpg|thumb|left|[[State Street (Utah)|State Street]] approaching the [[Utah State Capitol]]; northbound US-89 turned left here until 2007]]
From Springville north to [[Salt Lake City, UT|Salt Lake City]], US-89 parallels<U+2014>and for a distance [[overlap (road)|overlap]]s<U+2014>[[Interstate 15 (Utah)|Interstate 15]], following the old Arrowhead Trail, once the main highway from Salt Lake City to [[Los Angeles, CA|Los Angeles]], through a number of downtowns. Numerous state highways connect US-89 to I-15, including [[SR-77 (UT)|SR-77]] in [[Springville, UT|Springville]], [[SR-114 (UT)|SR-114]] in [[Provo, UT|Provo]], [[SR-52 (UT)|SR-52]] in [[Orem, UT|Orem]], [[SR-180 (UT)|SR-180]] and [[SR-145 (UT)|SR-145]] in [[American Fork, UT|American Fork]], and [[SR-73 (UT)|SR-73]] in [[Lehi, UT|Lehi]]. In Provo, US-89 meets [[US-189 (UT)|US-189]], its only branch, which heads northeast through [[Provo Canyon]] to [[Heber City, UT|Heber City]], connecting to [[I-80 (UT)|I-80]] and bypassing Salt Lake City. North of Lehi, US-89 merges with I-15 (at exit 282), which has been built on or near the old road through a [[gap (geology)|gap]] in the [[Traverse Mountains]] (elevation 4800 feet/1500 m) into the [[Salt Lake Valley]]. The routes split in [[Draper, UT|Draper]], formerly with a direct interchange north of [[SR-71 (UT)|SR-71]], but US-89 traffic must now exit at SR-71 (exit 291), turn east to Factory Outlet Drive, and follow this [[frontage road]] to the location of the former split. From here all the way to [[downtown Salt Lake City]], US-89 is marked along [[State Street (Utah)|State Street]], a major north-south street that lies along 100 East in the city's [[grid plan (Salt Lake City)|grid plan]] and ends at the [[Utah State Capitol]]. After passing through [[Sandy, UT|Sandy]], [[Midvale, UT|Midvale]], [[Murray, UT|Murray]], and [[South Salt Lake, UT|South Salt Lake]], State Street enters Salt Lake City at the intersection with [[SR-201 (UT)|SR-201]] (2100 South). Until 2007, US-89 followed State Street to North Temple (100 North), two blocks from the capitol, but now it turns at 400 South, following the former alignment of [[SR-186 (UT)|SR-186]] west and north on 300 West, and rejoining its pre-2007 route at North Temple. As it leaves downtown, 300 West curves northwesterly and becomes Beck Street.<ref name=maps/>

US-89 leaves Salt Lake City at exit 312 of [[I-15 (UT)|I-15]], where it acts as I-15's [[frontage road]]s. Just south of I-15's junction with [[I-215 (UT)|I-215]], US-89 splits to the northeast, passing through [[Bountiful, UT|Bountiful]] and [[Woods Cross, UT|Woods Cross]]. A northerly curve onto 500 West removes the highway from Bountiful's Main Street, and it merges with I-15 at exit 317 to bypass [[Centerville, UT|Centerville]] and [[Farmington, UT|Farmington]], where the old road (former [[US-91 (UT)|US-91]], but never US-89) is [[SR-106 (UT)|SR-106]], through the narrow strip of land that separates [[Farmington Bay]] from the [[Wasatch Mountains]]. US-89 leaves I-15 at exit 324, where the under-construction [[Legacy Parkway]] will end, and proceeds north on a [[freeway]]. This portion of US-89 is the only one to include [[exit number]]s based on its own mileage, as opposed to the [[overlap (road)|overlap]]ping I-15 or I-70. The freeway ends after US-89 crosses [[SR-273 (UT)|SR-273]], the former surface alignment of US-91 in both directions, and heads north as a four-lane road along the Wasatch foothills, to the east of [[Layton, UT|Layton]] and [[Hill Air Force Base]]. After crossing [[I-84 (UT)|I-84]] in [[Uintah, UT|Uintah]], US-89 enters [[Ogden, UT|Ogden]], which it traverses via Washington Boulevard, rejoining old US-91 (now [[SR-26 (UT)|SR-26]]) south of downtown. Beyond Ogden, US-89 continues in a general northerly direction along the thin strip between [[Willard Bay]] and the Wasatch Mountains to [[Brigham City, UT|Brigham City]], where it finally turns east away from the I-15 corridor.<ref name=maps/>

===Wasatch Front to Idaho border===
[[Image:Logan-Scenic-Byway.JPG|thumb|US-89 through [[Logan Canyon]], a [[National Scenic Byway]]]]
US-89 meets the current alignment of [[US-91 (UT)|US-91]] in the southern outskirts of Brigham City, turning east for an overlap on the city's southeast bypass. ([[SR-13 (UT)|SR-13]] and [[SR-90 (UT)|SR-90]] are the former alignment through Brigham City.) The two routes head east up [[Box Elder Canyon]] in the southern [[Wellsville Mountains]], finally leaving the valley of the [[Great Salt Lake]] into a small valley that contains [[Mantua Reservoir]] (elevation 5200 feet/1600 m). US-89/US-91 turns north there, bypassing the town of [[Mantua, UT|Mantua]] to the west, and continues to ascend to [[Sardine Summit]] (elevation 5900 feet/1800 m). Another small valley leads to [[Wellsville Canyon]], where the four-lane roadway again turns east and descends into the [[Cache Valley]]. In that valley, US-89/US-91 heads northeast, bypassing [[Wellsville, UT|Wellsville]] to the east, into downtown [[Logan, UT|Logan]]. US-91 continues northerly from Logan into [[Idaho]], but US-89 splits to the east, beginning a long climb of the [[Bear River Range]] through [[Logan Canyon]]. The [[Logan Canyon Scenic Byway]], a Utah and [[National Scenic Byway]], begins at Logan and follows US-89 to [[Garden City, UT|Garden City]] (Utah's definition continues to the state line).<ref>[[National Scenic Byways Program]], [http://www.byways.org/explore/byways/2001/ Logan Canyon Scenic Byway], accessed May 2008</ref><ref name=admin/> [[Bear Lake Summit]] (elevation 7800 feet/2400 m), at the top of the range, is the highest point on US-89 in Utah, from which it descends the east slope via [[horseshoe curve (road)|horseshoe curve]]s to [[Garden City, UT|Garden City]] on the shore of [[Bear Lake (Idaho-Utah)|Bear Lake]] (elevation 5900 feet/1800 m). The final segment of US-89 to the [[Idaho]] state line follows the lake's west shore, its location constrained by the Bear River Range just to the west.<ref name=maps/>

==History==
When US-89 was created in 1926, it only went as far north as [[Spanish Fork, UT|Spanish Fork]], where travelers could continue to [[Salt Lake City, UT|Salt Lake City]] via [[US-91 (UT)|US-91]].<ref name="1926 map">[[Bureau of Public Roads]], [[:Image:1926us.jpg|United States System of Highways]], [[November 11]], [[1926]]</ref><ref name="1927 log">[[American Association of State Highway Officials]], United States Numbered Highways, ''[[American Highways]]'', April 1927</ref> The highway was extended north to the [[Canadian border]] near [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in the mid-1930s,<ref>[[H.M.

The [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] decided in favor of Utah and Idaho, placing US-89 on or near US-91 between Spanish Fork and [[Logan, UT|Logan]], where it split northeasterly to [[Yellowstone National Park]]. (US-89 only left US-91 twice: between [[Farmington, UT|Farmington]] and [[Ogden, UT|Ogden]], where it still travels today, and via an all-weather route<!--described as such in the Soda Springs Sun--> from [[Brigham City, UT|Brigham City]] into the [[Cache Valley]], now [[SR-38 (UT)|SR-38]] and [[SR-30 (UT)|SR-30]].<ref name="1946 Rand McNally">[[Rand McNally]] [http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/NorthernRockies/randmcnally_ra_1946_015.html Auto Road Atlas], 1946</ref>) Wyoming's preferred routing, which left US-91 at [[Provo, UT|Provo]], instead became [[US-189 (UT)|US-189]].<ref name=settled>[[Soda Springs Sun]], Road Routing Of U.S. 89 Settled, [[December 15]], [[1938]]</ref> Beginning in the 1950s, [[Interstate 15 (Utah)|Interstate 15]] was constructed, replacing US-91 for through traffic south of Brigham City, and leading to that route's truncation there in 1974.<ref name=resolutions-91>[[Utah Department of Transportation]], [http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/f?p=100:pg:5285268476414239680:::1:T,V:1348, Highway Resolutions]: {{PDFlink|1=[http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=200609181116091 Route 91]|2=19.6&nbsp;MB}}, updated November 2007, accessed May 2008: includes scans of correspondence with [[AASHO]]</ref> On the other hand, US-89 follows independent corridors south of Spanish Fork and north of Logan.

The southern part of US-89, running northerly from [[Kanab, UT|Kanab]], mostly follows a succession of linear valleys. The [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] opened a branch (later the [[Marysvale Branch]]) from its main line at [[Thistle, UT|Thistle]] to [[Manti, UT|Manti]] in 1890, and extended it (through a subsidiary, the [[Sevier Railway]]), to [[Salina, UT|Salina]] in 1891, [[Belknap, Utah|Belknap]] in 1896, and [[Marysvale, UT|Marysvale]] in 1900.<ref>R.

Major numbering changes were made in Utah's state highway system in the 1960s and 1970s, beginning with the construction of [[Interstate Highway]]s and culminating in the [[1977 renumbering (Utah)|1977 renumbering]], where state route numbers concurrent with other types were dropped entirely. However, the majority of these changes were not visible to the public, as signs continued to display US-89 and other U.S. Routes and Interstates.
