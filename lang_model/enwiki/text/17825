'''Pink Floyd''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band that achieved international success with their [[progressive rock|progressive]] and [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, and elaborate [[Pink Floyd live performances|live shows]], they are one of the most [[List of best-selling music artists|commercially successful]] and musically influential groups in the history of popular music.

Founded in 1965, the group originally consisted of university students [[Roger Waters]], [[Nick Mason]], [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] and [[Syd Barrett]]. They first gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett's creative leadership they released two charting singles and a successful d<U+00E9>but album. [[David Gilmour]] joined as a fifth member in December 1967, and Barrett left the band in April 1968 due to his deteriorating mental health. After Barrett's departure, Waters became their primary songwriter and lyricist. With Waters, Mason, Wright and Gilmour, Pink Floyd achieved critical and commercial success with the [[concept album]]s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973), ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975), ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979).

Wright left the group in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd and Wright subsequently joined them as a paid musician. They continued to record and tour through 1994; two more albums followed, ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Division Bell]]'' (1994). They have sold more than 250 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million certified units in the United States. They were inducted into the US [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996, and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2005.

After nearly two decades of acrimony, the band reunited in 2005 for a performance at the global awareness event [[Live 8]]. Barrett died in 2006 and Wright in 2008. In 2011, surviving members Gilmour and Mason joined Waters at one of his [[The Wall Live (concert tour)|The Wall Tour]] shows at [[The O2 Arena (London)|the O2</sub> Arena]] in London.

===Formation===

[[Roger Waters]] and [[Nick Mason]] met while they were both studying architecture at the [[University of Westminster|London Polytechnic]] at Regent Street.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=37<U+2013>38}}: Mason meeting Waters while studying architecture at the London Polytechnic; {{harvnb|Fitch|2005|p=335}}: Waters meeting Mason while studying architecture at the London Polytechnic.</ref> They first played music together in a group formed by Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe with Noble's sister Sheilagh. Fellow architecture student [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] joined later that year and the group became a sextet named Sigma&nbsp;6, the first band to include Waters, Wright, and Mason.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=39<U+2013>40}}: Wright was also an architecture student when he joined Sigma 6; {{harvnb|Povey|2008|pp=13<U+2013>14}}: The formation of Sigma 6; {{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=27}}: Instrumental line-up of Sigma 6: Waters (lead guitar), Wright (rhythm guitar) and Mason (drums).</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Wright studied architecture until 1963, when he began studying music at London's [[Royal College of Music]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=39<U+2013>40}}}} The band started performing during private functions, while rehearsing in a [[Tea house|tearoom]] in the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by [[The Searchers (band)|the Searchers]] and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=38<U+2013>39}}

In September 1963, Waters and Mason moved into a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens, near [[Crouch End]] London, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the nearby [[Hornsey College of Art]] and the Regent Street Polytechnic.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=24<U+2013>26}}{{refn|group=nb|Leonard designed light machines, which used electric motors to spin perforated discs, casting patterns of lights on the walls. These would be demonstrated in an early edition of ''[[Tomorrow's World]]''. For a brief time, Leonard played keyboard with them using the front room of his flat for rehearsals.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=24<U+2013>26}}}} Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist [[Bob Klose]] moved in during September 1964.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=14}}{{refn|group=nb|Wright also briefly lived at Leonard's.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=14}}}} Sigma&nbsp;6 went through a number of other transitory names, including the Meggadeaths, the Abdabs and the Screaming Abdabs, Leonard's Lodgers, and the Spectrum Five before settling on the Tea Set.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=13<U+2013>18}}{{refn|group=nb|Povey spelled it Meggadeaths but Blake spelled it Megadeaths.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=39}}: Megadeaths; {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=13}}: Meggadeaths.</ref> Architectural Abdabs is sometimes suggested as another variation; Povey dismisses it as a misreading of [http://sigma6.livejournal.com/850.html a headline about the Abdabs] in the Polytechnic's student newspaper.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=14<U+2013>15}} Povey used the Tea Set throughout whereas Blake's claim of the alternative spelling, the T-Set, remains unsubstantiated.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=43<U+2013>44}}: The T-Set as an alternate spelling; {{harvnb|Povey|2008|pp=28<U+2013>29}}: The Tea Set used throughout.</ref>}} In 1964, as Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band, [[Syd Barrett]] joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=41}} Barrett moved to London in 1962 to study at the [[Camberwell College of Arts|Camberwell College of Art]].{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=13}} Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett's mother's house.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=22<U+2013>23}} Mason said this about Barrett: "In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me."{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=27}}

Noble and Metcalfe left the Tea Set in late 1963, and Klose introduced the band to singer Chris Dennis, a technician with the [[Royal Air Force]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=42<U+2013>44}} In December 1964, they managed to secure their first recording time, at a studio in West Hampstead, through one of Wright's friends, who let them use some down time for free. Wright, who was taking a break from his studies, did not participate in the session.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=29<U+2013>30}}{{refn|group=nb|The four-song session became the band's first demo and included the R&B classic "[[I'm a King Bee]]", and three Syd Barrett originals, "Butterfly", "Lucy Leave" and "Double O Bo", a song Mason described as "Bo Diddley meets the 007 theme".{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=29<U+2013>30}}}} When the RAF assigned Dennis a post in [[Bahrain]] in early 1965, Barrett became the band's frontman.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=19}}{{refn|group=nb|According to Povey, by 1964 the group began calling itself the Abdabs.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=14}}}} Later that year, they became the resident band at the Countdown Club, near [[Kensington High Street]] in London, where from late night until early morning they played three sets of ninety minutes each. During this period, spurred by the group's need to extend their sets in order to minimise song repetition, came the band's "realisation that songs could be extended with lengthy solos", wrote Mason.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=30}} After pressure from his parents and advice from his college tutors, Klose quit the band in mid 1965 and Barrett took over on lead guitar.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=44<U+2013>45}}: Klose quit the band in mid 1965 and Barrett took over on lead guitar (secondary source); {{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=32}}: Klose quit the band in mid 1965 (primary source).</ref> The group first referred to themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965. Barrett created the name on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=18<U+2013>19}} The name is derived from the given names of two [[blues]] musicians whose [[Piedmont blues]] records Barrett had in his collection, [[Pink Anderson]] and [[Floyd Council]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=33<U+2013>37}}: The origin of the band name Pink Floyd (primary source); {{harvnb|Povey|2008|pp=18<U+2013>19}}: The origin of the band name Pink Floyd (secondary source).</ref>

By 1966, the group's repertoire consisted mainly of [[rhythm and blues]] songs and they had begun to receive paid bookings, including one for a performance at the [[Marquee Club]] in March 1966, where [[Peter Jenner]] noticed them. A lecturer at the [[London School of Economics]], Jenner was impressed by the sonic effects Barrett and Wright created, and with his business partner and friend [[Andrew King (music manager)|Andrew King]], he became their manager.<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=33<U+2013>37}}: Jenner was impressed by Barrett and Wright; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=17}}: Jenner and King became Pink Floyd's business managers.</ref> The pair had little experience in the [[music industry]] and used King's inherited money to set up [[Blackhill Enterprises]], purchasing about <U+00A3>1,000 worth of new instruments and equipment for the band. It was around this time that Jenner suggested they drop the "Sound" part of their band name, thus becoming the Pink Floyd.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=32<U+2013>33}}{{refn|group=nb|Soon after, someone stole the equipment, and the group resorted to purchasing new gear on a payment plan.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=32}}}} Under Jenner and King's guidance, the group became part of London's [[underground music]] scene, playing at venues including All Saints Hall and the Marquee.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=50<U+2013>51}} While performing at the Countdown Club the band had experimented with long instrumental excursions, and they began to expand upon these with rudimentary but visually effective light shows, projected by coloured slides and domestic lights.<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=46<U+2013>49}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=34}}: (secondary source).</ref> Jenner and King's social connections helped gain the band prominent coverage in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and an article in ''[[the Sunday Times]]'' which stated: "At the launching of the new magazine ''[[International Times|IT]]'' the other night a pop group called the Pink Floyd played throbbing music while a series of bizarre coloured shapes flashed on a huge screen behind them&nbsp;... apparently very psychedelic."<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=52<U+2013>53}}: Jenner and King's connections helped gain the band important coverage; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=44}}: "apparently very psychedelic."</ref>

In 1966, they strengthened their business relationship with Blackhill Enterprises, becoming equal partners with Jenner and King and the band members each holding a one-sixth share.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=32<U+2013>33}} By late 1966, their set included fewer R&B standards and more Barrett originals, many of which would be included on their first album.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=49}} While they had significantly increased the frequency of their performances, the band was not widely accepted at the time. Following a performance at a Catholic youth club, the owner refused to pay them, claiming that their performance wasn't music.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=54}} When their management filed suit in a small claims court against the owner of the youth organisation, a local magistrate upheld the owner's decision. However, they were much better received at the [[UFO Club]] in London, where a small fan base began to build up around the band.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=54<U+2013>58}} Barrett's performances were enthusiastic, "leaping around&nbsp;... madness&nbsp;... improvisation&nbsp;... [inspired] to get past his limitations and into areas that were&nbsp;... very interesting. Which none of the others could do", wrote biographer [[Nicholas Schaffner]].{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=49}}

===Signing with EMI===

In 1967, Pink Floyd began to attract the attention of the mainstream music industry.<ref>{{harvnb|di Perna|2002|p=29}}: Pink Floyd as a spack rock band; {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=37}}: The music industry began to take notice of Pink Floyd.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|They dropped the definite article from the band's name at some point in early 1967.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=79}}}} While in negotiations with record companies, ''IT'' co-founder and UFO club manager [[Joe Boyd]] and Pink Floyd's booking agent [[Bryan Morrison]] arranged for and funded the recording of some songs at Sound Techniques in [[West Hampstead]]. Included were the standout track "[[Arnold Layne]]" and "[[Candy and a Currant Bun]]" as its B-side, both of which they recorded on 29 January 1967.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=37}}{{refn|group=nb|Previous to this session, on 11 and 12 January, they recorded a long take of "[[Interstellar Overdrive]]".{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=37}} Sometime around the 29 January sessions they produced a short music film for "Arnold Layne" in Sussex.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=59<U+2013>63}}}} Three days later Pink Floyd signed with EMI, receiving a <U+00A3>5,000 advance. EMI released the band's first single, "Arnold Layne", on 10&nbsp;March 1967, on its [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label.<ref>{{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=342}}: Release date for "Arnold Layne"; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=54<U+2013>55}}: Signing with EMI.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Shaffner described the <U+00A3>5,000 advance as generous; however, Povey suggested it was an inadequate agreement which required that the money be dispersed over five years.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=37}}}} The song's references to [[cross-dressing]] led to a ban by several radio stations; however, some creative manipulation by the retailers who supplied sales figures to the music business meant that the single peaked in the UK at number&nbsp;20.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=84<U+2013>85}}

EMI-Columbia released Pink Floyd's second single, "[[See Emily Play]]", on 16&nbsp;June 1967. It fared slightly better than "Arnold Layne", peaking at number&nbsp;6 in the UK.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=342}} They performed on the BBC's ''Look of the Week'', where Waters and Barrett, erudite and engaging, faced tough questioning from [[Hans Keller]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=86<U+2013>87}} They appeared on the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', an immensely popular programme which controversially required artists to mime their singing and playing.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=86<U+2013>87}} Though Pink Floyd returned for two more performances, by the third, Barrett had begun to unravel, and it was around this time that the band first noticed significant changes in his behaviour.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=43}} By early 1967, he was regularly using [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], and Mason described him as "completely distanced from everything going on".<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=82}}: Barrett was "completely distanced from everything going on"; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=51}}: Barrett's increasing LSD use starting early 1967.</ref>

The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=391}} Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, [[Marc Bolan|June Child]], who commented: "I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so&nbsp;... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage&nbsp;... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down."<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=95}}: "The band started to play and Syd just stood there"; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=36}}: June Child was Blackhill's assistant and secretary.</ref>

Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=67}} Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist [[R.

Working with Barrett eventually proved too difficult, and matters came to a head in January while en route to a performance in [[Southampton]] when a band member asked if they should collect Barrett.

[[File:Saucerful of secrets2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.80|Original psychedelic album artwork by Hipgnosis|alt=A psychedelic album cover with mostly greenish blues tones.]]

In 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to record their second album, ''A Saucerful of Secrets''. The LP included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, "[[Jugband Blues]]". Waters began to develop his own songwriting, contributing "[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]", "[[Let There Be More Light]]" and "[[Corporal Clegg]]". Wright composed "[[See-Saw (song)|See-Saw]]" and "[[Remember a Day]]". Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision.

''Ummagumma'' represented a departure from their previous work.

After a tour of the UK performing ''Dark Side'', Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their seventh studio album, ''Wish You Were Here''.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=184}} Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with [[the Alan Parsons Project]], and so the band turned to Brian Humphries.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=177: Parsons declined an offer to continue working with Pink Floyd, 200: Pink Floyd hired Humphries}} Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as "falling within a difficult period" and Waters found them "torturous".{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=184<U+2013>185}} Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=184<U+2013>185}}

Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=184<U+2013>185}} During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=178<U+2013>184}} These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett.<ref>{{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=184}}: The motif reminded Waters of Barrett; {{harvnb|Watkinson|Anderson|2001|p=119}}: Gilmour composed the motif entirely by accident.</ref> The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=185<U+2013>186}} Waters commented: "Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt&nbsp;... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd."{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=184}}

While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio, during which Thorgerson recalled that he "sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there."{{sfn|Watkinson|Anderson|2001|p=120}} He had changed significantly in appearance, and the band did not initially recognise him.

The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis, and although Gilmour was largely responsible for "Dogs", which took up almost the entire first side of the album he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part "[[Pigs on the Wing]]".{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=242<U+2013>245}} Wright commented: "It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave ''did'' have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there."{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=242}} Mason recalled: "Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately."{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=242}}{{refn|group=nb|"Pigs on the Wing" contained references to Waters' romantic relationship with Carolyne Anne Christie.

Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward ''Animals''; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=242<U+2013>243}} ''Animals'' is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: "''Animals''...&nbsp;wasn't a fun record to make&nbsp;... this was when Roger ''really'' started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band&nbsp;... that it was only because of him that [we] were still going&nbsp;... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me."{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=242<U+2013>243}}

Released in January 1977, the album peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=347}} ''[[NME]]'' described the album as "one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music&nbsp;... available this side of the sun", and ''Melody Maker''{{'}}s Karl Dallas called it "[an] uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific".{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=247}}

They performed much of the album's material during their "[[In the Flesh Tour|In the Flesh]]" tour, Pink Floyd's first experience playing large stadiums, the size of which caused unease in the band.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=252<U+2013>253}} Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance.

{{Main|The Wall|Pink Floyd<U+2014>The Wall}}
In July 1978, amidst financial turmoil caused by negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title, ''Bricks in the Wall'', and the other would later become Waters' first solo album, ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]''. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=258<U+2013>259}}{{refn|group=nb|In 1976, Pink Floyd had become involved with financial advisers Norton Warburg Group (NWG).

NWG invested between <U+00A3>1.6&nbsp;million and <U+00A3>3.3&nbsp;million of the band's money in high-risk venture capital schemes, primarily to reduce their exposure to UK taxes. It soon became apparent that the band were still losing money. Not only did NWG invest in failing businesses, they also left the band liable for tax bills as high as 83 percent of their income. The band eventually terminated their relationship with NWG and demanded the return of any funds not yet invested, which at that time amounted to <U+00A3>860,000; they received only <U+00A3>740,000.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=206<U+2013>208}} Pink Floyd eventually sued NWG for <U+00A3>1M, accusing them of fraud and negligence. NWG collapsed in 1981: Andrew Warburg fled to Spain;  Waterbrook purchased Norton Warburg Investments, and many of its holdings sold at a significant loss.

[[Gerald Scarfe]] produced a series of animations for the subsequent live shows, ''The Wall Tour''. He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline including the "Mother", the "Ex-wife" and the "Schoolmaster". Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances of the album.{{sfn|Scarfe|2010|pp=91<U+2013>115}} Relationships within the band were at an all-time low; their four [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]]s parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre.

''The Wall'' concept also spawned a film, the original idea for which was to be a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes. However, the concert footage proved impractical to film. [[Alan Parker]] agreed to direct and took a different approach. The animated sequences would remain, but scenes would be acted by professional actors with no dialogue. Waters was screen-tested, but quickly discarded and they asked [[Bob Geldof]] to accept the role of Pink. Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning ''The Wall''{{'}}s storyline as "bollocks".{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=289}} Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=288<U+2013>292}}{{refn|group=nb|Waters took a six-week leave during filming and returned to find that Parker had used his artistic license to modify parts of the film to his liking.

===''The Final Cut''===
{{Main|The Final Cut (album)}}
In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project for the band, with the working title ''Spare Bricks'', originally conceived as the soundtrack album for ''Pink Floyd The Wall''; however, with the onset of the [[Falklands War]], Waters changed artistic direction and began writing new material. Waters saw [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and he dedicated the new album to his late father. Immediately there were arguments between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycling a number of songs passed over for ''The Wall''. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=294<U+2013>295}} [[Michael Kamen]], a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of ''The Wall'', mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then absent Wright.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=296<U+2013>298}}{{refn|group=nb|Recording took place in eight studios, including Gilmour's home studio at [[Outside Studios|Hookend Manor]] and Waters' home studio at [[East Sheen]].<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=296<U+2013>298}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=268}}: (primary source)</ref>}} The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure.

Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album.

==="A spent force"===

Gilmour recorded his second solo album, ''[[About Face (album)|About Face]]'', in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics; from the murder of [[John Lennon]] to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]''.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=302<U+2013>309}} Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded ''[[Identity (Zee album)|Identity]]'', which went almost unnoticed upon its release.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=309<U+2013>311}}{{refn|group=nb|Wright was also in the midst of a difficult divorce and later said that the album was, "made at a time in my life when I was lost."{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=309<U+2013>311}}}} Mason released his second solo album, ''[[Profiles]]'', in August 1985.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=311<U+2013>313}}

After Waters had declared Pink Floyd "a spent force", he contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, and this angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. Waters then went to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in an effort to prevent their use of the Pink Floyd name.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=311<U+2013>313}}: O'Rourke's involvement in the settlement; {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=240}}: "a spent force".</ref> When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. He later told the ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'': "Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him".{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=271}}

Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia declaring his intention to leave the group, and asking them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract<U+2014>which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended<U+2014>and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. With the case still pending, Waters dismissed O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=311<U+2013>313}}{{refn|group=nb|Waters went on to record the soundtrack for ''[[When the Wind Blows (film)|When the Wind Blows]]'', as well as his second solo album, ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]''.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=263<U+2013>266}}}}

The associated tour had a rough start because Waters attempted to subvert it by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his [[Ferrari 250 GTO]] as collateral.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=322}} Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright  entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured throughout North America, Waters' ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]'' tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the [[Pink Floyd pigs|flying pig]]. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=277}} The parties reached a legal agreement on 23&nbsp;December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, amongst other things, ''The Wall''.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=329<U+2013>335}}

For several years, Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the [[Carrera Panamericana]] and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=311<U+2013>313}}{{refn|group=nb|Gilmour divorced his wife Ginger and Mason married actress Annette Lynton.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=352}}}} In January 1993, they began working on a new album, returning to Britannia Row Studios, where for several days, Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, ad-libbing material.

== Musicianship ==
=== Genres ===

Considered one of the UK's first [[psychedelic music]] groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene. Some categorize their work from that era as a [[space rock]].<ref>{{harvnb|di Perna|2002|p=29}}: Pink Floyd as a spack rock act; {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=86}}: Pink Floys as one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|In early 1965, Pink Floyd auditioned for [[ITV]]'s ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'', which Mason described as "the definitive music show of the day".{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=31}} Despite sounding what Mason considered "too ''radical'' for the general viewer", they earned a callback for a second audition, with the caveat that they play material more familiar to the judges; they did not earn an appearance on the show.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=31<U+2013>32}} Also in 1965, they auditioned for the ''[[Melody Maker]]'' Beat Contest, losing to the eventual national winners.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=31<U+2013>32}}}} According to ''Rolling Stone'': "By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on [[hard rock]], [[blues]], [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[electronic music]]."{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=761}} Released in 1968, the song "[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]" helped galvanise their reputation as an [[art rock]] group.{{sfn|di Perna|2002|p=13}} Critics also describe them as an [[acid rock]] band.{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=760}} By the late 1960s, the press had begun to label their music [[progressive rock]].{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=85}} O'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd:

<blockquote>
Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own&nbsp;... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of he performance."{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=199}}
</blockquote>

In 1968, Wright commented on Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: "It's hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group. We never saw ourselves that way&nbsp;... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun&nbsp;... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted&nbsp;... the emphasis&nbsp;... [is] firmly on spontaneity and improvisation."{{sfn|Fitch|2001|p=45}} Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental' ... Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't want to go back to playing "[[Interstellar Overdrive]]" for hours and hours."{{sfn|Hibbert|1996|p=147}} Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and [[ambient music|ambient music]] during the 1980s.{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|pp=760<U+2013>761}}

=== Gilmour's guitar-work===
{{main|David Gilmour}}
{{quote box|quote= "While Waters was Floyd's lyricist and conceptualist, Gilmour was the band's voice and its main instrumental focus."|source= ~ Alan di Perna, in ''Guitar World'', May 2005|width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

Gilmour's guitar-playing was a key component of the Pink Floyd sound. ''Rolling Stone'' ranked him number 14 in their "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" list and critic Alan di Perna described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, calling him "the missing link between [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] and [[Eddie Van Halen|Van Halen]]."<ref>{{harvnb|di Perna|2006|p=58}}: "the missing link"; For ''Rolling Stone''{{'s}} "100 Greatest Guitarists" list see: {{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/david-gilmour-19691231|title=100 greatest guitarists of all time|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> In 2006, Gilmour commented on his playing technique: "[My] fingers make a distinctive sound ... [they] aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable ... The way I play melodies is connected to things like [[Hank Marvin]] and [[the Shadows]]".{{sfn|di Perna|2006|pp=58<U+2013>59}} Critics have praised Gilmour's less is more approach to guitar solos; his ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to [[Jazz]] trumpeter [[Miles Davis]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=62}} 

In 2006, ''Guitar World'' writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's guitar style as "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures."{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=62}} According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]", "[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]" and "[[Comfortably Numb]]" "cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog."{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=62}} Brown described the "Time" solo as "a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development ... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato."{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=66}} Brown described Gilmour's sense of phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: "I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting ... [to get] singing sustain ... you need to play loud<U+2014>at or near the feedback threshold. It's just so much more fun to play ... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade."{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=62}}

=== Sonic experimentation ===
Throughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound. Their second single, "See Emily Play" premiered at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in London, on 12 May 1967. During the performance, the group first used an early [[Quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic device]] called an [[Azimuth co-ordinator]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=86}} The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=134}} In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=178}}

Waters experimented with the [[EMS Synthi A]] and [[EMS VCS 3|VCS 3]] synthesisers on Pink Floyd pieces such as "[[On the Run (instrumental)|On the Run]]", "[[Welcome to the Machine]]", and "[[In the Flesh?]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=169}}: Synthesiser use in "On the Run"; {{harvnb|Fitch|2005|p=324}}: Synthesiser use on "Welcome to the Machine"; {{harvnb|Fitch|Mahon|2006|p=71}}: Synthesiser use on "In the Flesh?".</ref> He used a Binson Echorec 2 echo effect on his bass-guitar track for "[[One of These Days (Pink Floyd song)|One of These Days]]".{{sfn|Mabbett|1995|p=39}} 

Pink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of ''The Final Cut''. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental [[Holophonic]] system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=297<U+2013>298}}

=== Film scores ===
Pink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with ''[[The Committee (film)|The Committee]]''.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=133<U+2013>135}} In 1969, they recorded the score for [[Barbet Schroeder]]'s film ''[[More (1969 film)|More]]''. The soundtrack proved beneficial; not only did it pay well but, along with ''A Saucerful of Secrets'', the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=128}} While composing the soundtrack for director [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'', the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month. Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week. Eventually he used only three of their recordings. One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called "The Violent Sequence", later became "Us and Them", included on 1973's ''The Dark Side of the Moon''.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=135<U+2013>136}} In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film ''La Vall<U+00E9>e'', for which they released a soundtrack album called ''Obscured by Clouds''. They composed the material in about a week at the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau d'H<U+00E9>rouville]] near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top&nbsp;50 on the US Billboard chart.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=156<U+2013>157}}

To celebrate the launch of the [[London Free School]]'s magazine ''[[International Times]]'', they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of [[Roundhouse (venue)|the Roundhouse]], attended by celebrities including [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Marianne Faithfull]].{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=42<U+2013>43}} In mid 1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of [[Polarizer|polariser]]s, mirrors and stretched [[condom]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Fitch|2005|pp=359<U+2013>360}}: Peter Wynne-Willson; {{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=78<U+2013>79}}: Wynne-Willson updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas.</ref> After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a [[Ford Transit]] van, then considered extravagant band transportation.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=70}} On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called ''[[The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream]]'' at the [[Alexandra Palace]], London. Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=58}}{{refn|group=nb|Road manager [[Peter Watts (road manager)|Peter Watts]] joined them before touring Europe in 1968.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=115<U+2013>119}}}} In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called "[[List of unreleased Pink Floyd material#"Moonhead" |Moonhead]]".{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=87: The television audience, 111: Pink Floyd performed a piece titled "Moonhead"}}

In November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=183}} In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named "Algie". Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the [[In the Flesh Tour]].{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=241}} The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album ''[[The Wall]]''. The subsequent [[The Wall Tour]] featured a {{convert|40|ft|m}} high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience. They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story. They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=280<U+2013>282}} One striking feature of the tour was the performance of "Comfortably Numb". While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him. Gilmour stood on a [[flightcase]] on castors; an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician. A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=284<U+2013>285}}

During [[The Division Bell Tour]], an unknown person using the name [[Publius Enigma|Publius]] posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|East Rutherford]] spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, someone projected the word "enigma" in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band. As of {{CURRENTYEAR}} the puzzle remains unsolved.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=363<U+2013>367}}

== Lyrical themes ==

''Rolling Stone'' described Pink Floyd as "purveyors of a distinctively dark vision".{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=760}} Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote that Pink Floyd's "interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference."{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=192}} Waters identified [[empathy]] as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=36}} Author George Reisch described ''Meddle''{{'s}} psychedelic opus, "[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]", as "built around the core idea of genuine communication, [[sympathy]], and ''collaboration'' with others."{{sfn|Reisch|2007|p=268}} Despite having been labeled "the gloomiest man in rock", author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an [[Existentialism|existentialist]], dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics.{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|pp=81<U+2013>82}}

;Disillusionment, absence and non-being
Waters' lyrics to ''Wish You Were Here''{{'s}} "[[Have a Cigar]]" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=133}} The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes "Pink" is one of the band member's names.{{sfn|Detmer|2007|p=77}} According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the "dehumanizing aspects of the world of commerce", a situation the artist must endure in order to reach their audience.{{sfn|Detmer|2007|p=75}} 

Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealized political goals and unsuccessful endeavors. Their film score, ''[[Obscured by Clouds]]'', dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with aging.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=197}} Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of ''Wish You Were Here'': "The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present whilst their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling."<ref>{{cite book|last=Thorgerson|first=Storm|year=1978|title=The Work of Hipgnosis - Walk Away Rene<U+00E9>|publisher= A & W|isbn=978-0-89104-105-4|page=148}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Thorgerson's design for ''Wish You Were Here''{{'s}} cover included four sides, counting the inner jacket, which represented four absences related to the classical [[Classical element|categories of substance]]: earth, air, fire and water. His ''Dark Side'' album cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of coloured light symbolizes unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity.{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|p=86}} Absence is a key element in the existentialism of [[Albert Camus]], who defined absurdity as the absence of a response to the individual's need for unity.{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|p=86}}}} Waters commented: "it's about none of us really being there&nbsp;... [it] should have been called ''Wish We Were Here''".{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|p=90}}

O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of [[Being and Nothingness#Nothingness|non-being]] a common theme in their music.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=192}}{{refn|group=nb|Philosophy originated from the Greek poet, [[Parmenides]], who wrote a poem in which the protagonist takes a cosmic chariot ride guided by a goddess who shows him that there are only two paths in life, being, which leads to truth, and non-being, which leads to confusion and discontent. The goddess also told Parmenides: "thought and being are one".{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=191}}}} Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in ''The Wall'', with the lyrics to "Comfortably Numb": "I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner or my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone."{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=197}} Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, "Jugband Blues": "I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here."{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=197}}

;Exploitation and oppression

Author Patrick Croskery described ''Animals'' as a unique blend of the "powerful sounds and suggestive themes" of ''Dark Side'' with ''The Wall''{{'s}} portrayal of artistic alienation.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=35}} He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's ''Animal Farm''.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=35}} ''Animals'' begins with a thought experiment, which asks: "If you didn't care what happened to me. And I didn't care for you", then developes a [[beast fable]] based on anthropomorphized characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of [[dystopia]], the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|pp=35<U+2013>36}}

The album's characters include the "Dogs", representing fervent capitalists, the "Pigs", symbolizing political corruption, and the "Sheep", who represent the exploited.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|pp=37<U+2013>40}} Croskery described the "Sheep" as being in a "state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity", a [[false consciousness]].{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=40}} The "Dog", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|pp=37<U+2013>38}} Waters used [[Mary Whitehouse]] as an example of a "Pig"; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=39}} At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: "You know that I care what happens to you.

;Alienation, war and insanity
{{quote box|quote= "When I say, 'I'll see you on the dark side of the moon'...&nbsp;what I mean [is]&nbsp;... If you feel that you're the only one&nbsp;... that you seem crazy [because] you think everything is crazy, you're not alone."{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=89}}  |source= ~ Waters, quoted in Harris, 2005|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

O'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of ''Dark Side''{{'s}} "[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]" with [[Karl Marx]]{{'s}} theory of [[Social alienation#Self-estrangement|self-alienation]]; "there's someone in my head, but it's not me."{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=195}}{{refn|group=nb|Marx considered insanity the ultimate form of self-alienation.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=195}}}} The lyrics to ''Wish You Were Here''{{'s}} "[[Welcome to the Machine]]" suggest what Marx called the [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation of the thing]]; the song's protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=195}} Allusions to the [[Marx's theory of alienation#Types of alienation|alienation of man's species being]] can be found in ''Animals''; the "Dog" reduced to living instinctively as a non-human.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=196}} The "Dogs" become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a "necessary and defensible" position in "a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle" wrote Detmer.{{sfn|Detmer|2007|p=73}} [[Marx's theory of alienation#Types of alienation|Alienation from others]] is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of ''The Wall''.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|p=195}} 

War, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of ''The Wall'', and a recurring theme in the band's music.{{sfn|O'Neill Surber|2007|pp=195<U+2013>196}} Waters' father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from "[[Corporal Clegg]]" (1968), "[[Free Four]]"  (1972), "[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]" (1973), "[[When the Tigers Broke Free]]" and "[[The Fletcher Memorial Home]]" from ''The Final Cut'' (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled ''A Requiem for the Postwar Dream''.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=294}}: ''The Final Cut'' dedicated to Waters' late father; {{harvnb|George-Warren|2001|p=761}}: ''A Requiem for the Postwar Dream''.</ref> The themes and composition of ''The Wall'' express Waters' upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively effected his personal relationships with women.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=294<U+2013>295: The influence of WWII on ''The Wall'', 351: An English society depleted of men after WWII}}

Waters' lyrics to ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=194<U+2013>195}} He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition.{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|p=85}} However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate [[positivism]], calling it "an exhortation&nbsp;... to embrace the positive and reject the negative."{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=81}} Reisch described ''The Wall'' as "less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that ''create'' or ''cause'' madness."{{sfn|Reisch|2007|p=257}} ''The Wall''{{'s}} protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making. After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is "crazy, over the rainbow".{{sfn|Reisch|2007|p=263}} He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: "have I been guilty all this time?"{{sfn|Reisch|2007|p=263}} Realizing his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him. He then stands trial for "showing feelings of an almost human nature", further exacerbating his alienation of species being.{{sfn|Reisch|2007|pp=263<U+2013>264}} As with the writings of philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, "custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies", contribute to his angst, according to Reisch.{{sfn|Reisch|2007|pp=258<U+2013>264}}
