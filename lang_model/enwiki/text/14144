==World Series==
{{main|1993 World Series}}
===Game 1===
[[October 16]], [[1993]] at the [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] in [[Toronto, Canada]]

The series' first game sent two staff aces -- [[Curt Schilling]] for Philadelphia and [[Juan Guzman (pitcher)|Juan Guzman]] for Toronto -- against one another. The result was less than a pitcher's duel, however, as both teams scored early and often.

The deciding plays came in the middle innings. With Toronto behind 4-3 in the 5th inning, [[Devon White]] hit a solo home run to tie the game. The next inning, [[John Olerud]] hit a solo home run of his own to put Toronto on top. Toronto added three insurance runs in the bottom of the 7th and held on to win 8-5. [[Al Leiter]] pitched 2 2/3 innings -- in relief of a sporadic Juan Guzman, who walked four in just five innings -- for his first World Series win. [[John Kruk]] had three hits for Philadelphia.

===Game 2===
[[October 17]], [[1993]] at [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] in [[Toronto, Canada]]

In the second game of the series, [[Dave Stewart (baseball player)|Dave Stewart]] was on the mound for Toronto and [[Terry Mulholland]] started for Philadelphia. Philadelphia jumped out to an early lead: in the third inning, [[Jim Eisenreich]] followed [[John Kruk]] and [[Dave Hollins]] RBI singles with a three-run home run to deep right-centre. Toronto got on the scoreboard in the fourth inning courtesy of a [[Joe Carter]] two-run home run to left (his second most important home run of the series by a wide margin), but the Jays were unable to mount a significant offensive push later in the game. Philadelphia held on to win 6-4. Terry Mulholland pitched 5 2/3 innings, allowing 3 earned runs, for the win.

===Game 3===
[[October 19]], [[1993]] at [[Veterans Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]

For Toronto, [[Pat Hentgen]] faced off against Philadelphia starter [[Danny Jackson]] in Game 3. Hentgen pitched a strong 6 innings, allowing just 1 run, and the Toronto offense took care of the rest. Toronto won 10-3.

Toronto manager [[Cito Gaston]] was faced with an unusual and difficult decision prior to game time. As the series switched the [[National League]] ballpark, Gaston was forced to sit one player from his regular line-up as the [[designated hitter]] (DH) would not be allowed to play. As regular DH [[Paul Molitor]] had been a hot hand in the line-up, Gaston elected to sit firstbaseman [[John Olerud]] and place Molitor at first base. The decision was potentially controversial as Olerud led the [[American League]] in batting during the year with a .363 average and Molitor was the less sure-handed fielder. Molitor, however, put these concerns to rest, going 3 for 4, hitting a home run in the 3rd inning, and driving in 3 runs.

===Game 4===
[[October 20]], [[1993]] at [[Veterans Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]

In the fourth game of the series, [[Todd Stottlemyre]] started for Toronto while [[Tommy Greene]] started for Philadelphia. The starters are notable because neither lasted three innings.

In one of the more unusual plays in World Series history, Todd Stottlemyre, trying to go first to third on a [[Roberto Alomar]] single in the 2nd inning, did a bellyflop diving into third base, where he was called out. Todd's awkward dive resulted in an abrasion on his chin and appeared to shake him up in the next inning, during which he surrendered a [[Lenny Dykstra]] two-run home run. Stottlemyre was pulled after the second inning, having already given up six runs. (Tommy Greene fared little better, being pulled after giving up seven runs in 2 1/3 innings.)

Philadelphia took a commanding 12-7 lead in the 5th inning, courtesy of two-run home runs from [[Darren Daulton]] and Dykstra, and a run-scoring double from [[Milt Thompson (baseball)|Milt Thompson]].

Toronto fought back from a 14-9 deficit in the 8th inning, scoring six runs on run scoring hits from [[Paul Molitor]], [[Tony Fernandez]], [[Rickey Henderson]], and [[Devon White]]. [[Duane Ward]] pitched the final 1 1/3 innings, preserving the 15-14 victory.  Three new World Series records included the longest game at four hours fourteen minutes (4:14), most runs by both clubs with twenty-nine (29), and runs scored by a losing team with fourteen (14). 

Also, [[Charlie Williams (umpire)|Charlie Williams]] became the first [[African American]] to serve as the home plate umpire for a World Series game.

===Game 5===
[[October 21]], [[1993]] at [[Veterans Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]

The offenses were due for an off-day, and it came in Game 5 courtesy of a [[Curt Schilling]] (Philadelphia) and [[Juan Guzman (pitcher)|Juan Guzman]] (Toronto) pitching duel. Schilling shut down the previously unstoppable Toronto offense, limiting the team to just five hits and no runs. Guzman pitched well in a losing effort, allowing only two runs and five hits in seven innings of work.

The two runs scored as a result of scrappy play from the Philadelphia offense. In the first inning, [[Lenny Dykstra]] walked, stole second, moved to third on a [[Pat Borders]] throwing error, and scored on a [[John Kruk]] ground out. In the second inning, [[Darren Daulton]] opened with a double, took third on a ground out, and scored on a [[Kevin Stocker]] single.

===Game 6===
[[October 23]], [[1993]] at [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] in [[Toronto, Canada]]

[http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/baseballs_best/mlb_bb_gamepage.jsp?story_page=bb_93ws_gm6_phitor]

The sixth game in the series was a rematch between Game 2 starters [[Terry Mulholland]] and [[Dave Stewart (baseball player)|Dave Stewart]], who would have similar results. Toronto opened up the scoring in the bottom of the first with a run-scoring [[Paul Molitor]] triple, [[Joe Carter]] sacrifice fly, and [[Roberto Alomar]] RBI single. Molitor added a solo home run in the 5th inning, bringing the score to 5-1 for Toronto.

In the 7th inning, Philadelphia fought back with five runs to take a 6-5 lead. [[Lenny Dykstra]] hit a three-run home run, [[Dave Hollins]] had an RBI single and [[Pete Incaviglia]] hit a sacrifice fly. The inning brought an end to [[Dave Stewart (baseball player)|Dave Stewart]]'s night, leaving the game with 6 innings pitched and 4 runs given up.

Philadelphia closer [[Mitch Williams]] came on to the pitch the bottom of the 9th with Philadelphia clinging to a 6-5 lead. After beginning the inning by walking [[Rickey Henderson]], Williams tried to counter Henderson's speed by pitching out of a slide-step style of pitching delivery. Prior to Game 6 of the 1993 World Series, Williams never used the slide-step delivery in his career.  This may have cut back on the [[velocity]] of the hard throwing Williams.  The walk to Henderson was followedy by a [[Devon White]] fly out and a single by [[Paul Molitor]]. [[Joe Carter]] came up next and, on a two strike pitch, he hit an inside pitch just over the left field fence, giving the Blue Jays a come-from-behind 8-6 victory, and the World Series crown.
