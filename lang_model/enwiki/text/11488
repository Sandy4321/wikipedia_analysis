'''Pan-Asianism''' (also known as Asianism or Greater Asianism) is an [[ideology]] or a movement that [[Asia]]n [[nations]] unite and solidify and create a continental identity to defeat the designs of the [[Western world|Western]] nations to perpetuate [[hegemony]]. 

==Japanese Asianism==
Pre-[[World War II]] [[Japan]]ese Pan-Asianism was, at its core, the idea that Asia should unite against [[Europe]]an [[imperialism]]. 

Before and during World War II, this was a major element in Japanese [[propaganda]] to justify Japanese external invasions. The [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] was an example of this [[propaganda]]. 

Japanese Asianism developed in intertwining among debates on solidarity with [[Asia]]n [[nation]]s who were under pressure of the [[West]] and on aggressive expansion to the Asian continent. The former debates originated from leftist [[liberalism]]. Their ideologues were [[Tokichi Tarui]] (1850<U+2013>1922) who argued for equal [[Japan]]-[[Korea]] unionization for cooperative defence against the Western powers<ref>Tarui, Tokichi (1893) ''Daito Gappo-ron''</ref>, and [[Kentaro Oi]] (1843<U+2013>1922) who attempted domestic [[constitutional government]] in Japan and reforms of Korea<ref>See [[Osaka Incident of 1885]].</ref>. Pan-Asian thought in Japan began to develop in the late 19th century and was spurred on particularly following the defeat of [[Russia]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904<U+2013>1905). This created interest from [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Sun Yat-sen|Sun Wen]] and [[Sri Aurobindo]].

However, Japanese society had been strongly inclined to [[ultranationalism]] from the [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]]. The latter debates on aggressive [[expansionism]] to [[Asia]] became clearly apparent. Their representatives were the [[Black Ocean Society]] and the [[Black Dragon Society]]. The Black Dragon Society (1933) argued for [[Japanese imperialism]] and expansionism, and they led to a debate on securing the Asian continent under Japanese control. Exceptionally, [[Ry<U+014D>hei Uchida]] (1874<U+2013>1937), who was a member of the Black Dragon Society, was a Japan-Korea unionist and activist of Philippine and [[Chinese revolution]]s.

[[Toten Miyazaki]] (1870<U+2013>1922) consistently supported a Chinese revolution of [[Sun Yat-sen|Sun Wen]] with spiritual sacrifice and sympathy under imperial Japan. [[Tenshin Okakura]] (1862<U+2013>1913) criticized Western [[imperialism]] as a destroyer of human beauty, and argued for romantic solidarity with diverse "[[Asia]] as one" against Western civilization. 

<blockquote>
''ASIA is one. The [[Himalayas]] divide, only to accentuate, two mighty civilisations, the [[China|Chinese]] with its [[communism]] of [[Confucius]], and the Indian with its [[individualism]] of the [[Vedas]]. But not even the snowy barriers can interrupt for one moment that broad expanse of love for the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Ultimate]] and [[Universal (metaphysics)|Universal]], which is the common thought-inheritance of every Asiatic race, enabling them to produce all the great [[religion]]s of the world, and distinguishing them from those [[sea|maritime]] peoples of the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], who love to dwell on the [[Particular]], and to search out the means, not the end, of life.''<ref>Okakura, Tenshin (1904) ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/ioe Ideal of the East]''</ref>
</blockquote>

In this Okakura was utilising the Japanese concept of ''sangoku'', which existed in [[Japanese culture]] before the concept of [[Asia]] became popularised. ''Sangoku'' literally means the "three countries": ''[[Honsh<U+016B>]]'' (the largest island of Japan), ''[[Tang Dynasty|Kara]]'' (China) and ''[[Tenjiku]]'' (India).

However, most Asianists were [[nationalistic]] and imperialistic and were connected with rightist{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} organizations. They discussed self-righteous solidarity which led to [[ideology]] such as a "new order" of [[East Asia]] and "[[Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere]]" based on Japanese supremacy.

==New Greater Asianism from Modern China==
In a Chinese perspective, Japanese Asianism was interpreted as a rationalized ideology for Japanese military aggression and political absorption (cf. [[Twenty-One Demands]]). In 1917, [[Li Dazhao]] (1889<U+2013>1927) argued for liberation of Asian nations and equal greater Asian union. In 1924, [[Sun Yat-sen]] (1866<U+2013>1925) stated that the West was [[hegemonic]] and the East was [[Confucian]], and he argued for full independence by resisting [[colonialism]] with "Greater Asianism" which unionizes Asian nations<ref>[[s:Sun Yat Sen's speech on Pan-Asianism|1924 speech on Greater Asianism]]</ref>.

=="Third Way" from the Postcolonial World==
After the [[World War II]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] (1889<U+2013>1964) of [[India]] argued for neutral [[third way]] under the [[cold war]]. His assertion was: Asian nations should be fair to both American and Soviet sides, and the [[United Nations]] should be strong and independent who played a role to balance the world [[power politics]]. However, the [[North-South divide]] show that the [[postcolonial]] world has been confronted with economic independence and development.

The growing official interest in broader Asian concerns was shown in the establishment of facilities for Indian Studies. In 1899 [[Tokyo Imperial University]] set up a chair in [[Sanskrit]] and [[P<U+0101>li|Pali]], with a further chair in [[Comparative religion]] being set up in 1903. In this environment, a number of Indian [[students]] came to Japan in the early twentieth century, founding the [[Oriental Youngmen's Association]] in 1900. Their anti-[[United Kingdom|British]] political activity caused consternation to the Indian Government, following a report in the [[London]] ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]''.

Political leaders from [[Sun Yat-Sen]] in the 1910s and 20s to [[Lee Kuan Yew]] in the 1990s argue that the political models and ideologies of [[Europe]] lack values and concepts found in Asian societies and philosophies. Some{{Who|date=March 2009}} proponents argue that these values are better for all human societies. Some{{Who|date=March 2009}} would argue that they are better or more suited for Asian societies. European values such as individual rights and freedoms would not be suited for Asian societies in this extreme formulation of Pan-Asianism.

In the 1930s and 1940s this ideology was used by the Japanese government as part of a [[propaganda]] campaign against European (and U.S.) [[imperialism]] in support of its rival imperialist [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]].

During the [[Cold War]] Pan-Asianism took a back seat.  Several countries like [[India]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Indonesia]] advocated for greater ties with the rest of the developing world within and beyond [[Asia]], while others were economically and politically more orientated towards either one of the superpowers.  However [[ASEAN]] emerged in 1967, providing a framework for cooperation in South-East Asia.

The idea of [[Asian values]] is somewhat of a resurgence of Pan-Asianism. One foremost enthusiast of the idea of [[Asian values]] is the former prime minister of [[Singapore]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]]. In India, [[Rammanohar Lohia]] dreamt of a united socialist Asia.
