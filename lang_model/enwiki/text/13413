'''Vortigaunts''' are a fictional [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] race in the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]] by [[Valve Corporation]]. In ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and its three expansions, Vortigaunts are frequently encountered by the player as hostile [[non-player character]]s. The Vortigaunts are depicted in ''Half-Life'' as being an enslaved race in an [[multiverse|alternate dimension]] called [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]], subservient to a large Xen creature called the [[List of creatures in the Half-Life series#Nihilanth|Nihilanth]], which itself is a slave to undisclosed masters. In ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', the Vortigaunts have broken free of their slavery, and actively assist the player and other humans in resisting the [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] occupation of [[Earth]].

Vortigaunts are shown as a very communal and cultural race, believing in a force that binds the fabric of the universe and each Vortigaunt together, as well as producing a tradition of poetry and music. Vortigaunts also display the ability to summon and command electrical energy without the need for technology. This ability is used for various activities, such as a means of attack, powering electrical equipment, and healing. 

The fictional creatures have received a range of critical responses from their various appearances. While critics hailed their graphical depiction in ''Half-Life'' and its expansions, the characters' [[game artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] was thought of as rudimentary in comparison to that of human enemies. Reviewers found the evolution of the Vortigaunts into allies for ''Half-Life 2'' intriguing and that the aliens were fun for a player to fight alongside in ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two|Episode Two]]'', but felt their story elements in ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One|Episode One]]'' disappointing. In addition to their role within the ''Half-Life'' series, Vortigaunts have been adapted for [[machinima]] productions and have been made into a [[plush toy]] by Valve.

==Character design==
[[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] provides the voice for the Vortigaunts in ''Half-Life 2'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=43775&tab=credits|title=''Half-Life 2'' <U+2013> Credits|publisher=[[Allgame]]|accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref> and was partially chosen due to his role as the alien in the film ''[[Enemy Mine (film)|Enemy Mine]]''.<ref name="raising the bar">{{cite book|title=[[Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar]]|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|first=David|last=Hodgson|year=2004|isbn=9780761543640}}</ref> In ''Episode Two'', the Vortigaunts' voicing was done by [[Tony Todd]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=50489&tab=credits|title=''The Orange Box'' <U+2013> Credits|publisher=[[Allgame]]|accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref> Valve had to determine whether to feature new voice acting for the Vortigaunts in ''Episode Two'', as it had the potential to ruin the atmosphere of the game when done wrong. However, they settled on the new voice acting for Vortigaunt dialogue to enhance the sections of the game in which the player is accompanied by a Vortigaunt.<ref name="phillip">{{cite web|url=http://www.planetphillip.com/posts/matt-glanville-interview/|title=Matt Glanville Interview|publisher=PlanetPhillip|date=2008-06-12|accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref> Graphically, the Vortigaunts in both ''Half-Life'' and ''Half-Life 2'' were designed by [[concept art]]ists Dhabih Eng and Chuck Jones.<ref name="raising the bar"/>

Initially, Vortigaunts were planned to begin ''Half-Life'' as enemy non-player characters, which the player has to win over as allies and lead in rebellion. This idea, however, proved impractical and was abandoned in favor of keeping the Vortigaunts as adversaries.<ref name="raising the bar"/> The plan re-emerged for ''Half-Life 2'', in which the species are active allies of the player. The Vortigaunts in ''Half-Life 2'' were originally going to be fully integrated in [[City 17]] alongside the humans under Combine rule. This did not reach fruition; due to the focus on developing the city combat, the resources to accomplish this were not available. As there were so few resulting Vortigaunts in the city, the developers instead decided to involve the Vortigaunts far more substantially in the sections of the game taking place in the countryside surrounding the city. The few Vortigaunts placed inside the city were used to hint at the story arc for the Vortigaunts later in the game.<ref name="CVG">{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=147512|title=PC Interview: Looking Back... ''Half-Life 2: Episode One''|work=[[PC Zone]]|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|date=2006-10-12|accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref> Midway through ''Half-Life 2'', the player witnesses a scene with a deceased Vortigaunt in a prison. Originally, the developers were intending to feature this Vortigaunt as an ally character who, if players rescue him, would fight enemy characters alongside the player. The developers liked this idea, but it was too late in the development to attempt this; instead, the idea was preserved for use in ''Episode Two''.<ref name="CVG"/> The concept was later showcased in an ''Episode Two'' trailer shown at the [[Games Convention]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200608/N06.0824.1746.35287.htm|title=GC 2006: New ''Half-Life 2: Episode Two'' Details Emerge|work=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop Corporation]]|first=Billy|last=Berghammer|date=2006-08-24|accessdate=2009-08-31}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

According to series writer [[Marc Laidlaw]], one of the most important goals with ''Episode Two'' was to expand on the Vortigaunts as characters, as opposed to just "purveyors of bugbait or Xen [[K<U+014D>an|koans]]".<ref name="play">{{cite web|url=http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.Content&contentid=587|title=Interview <U+2013> Valve Software|work=[[Play (US magazine)|Play]]|publisher=Fusion Publishing|first=Mike|last=Griffin|date=2008-05-21|accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref> As such, Valve added new behaviours, new animations, and new audio to the Vortigaunts.<ref name="play"/> Multiple branching story paths were considered for ''Episode Two'', including being able to choose between allowing a Vortigaunt to escape at the cost of trapping the player character or leaving the Vortigaunt behind, and a segment in which the player has to choose between rescuing a Vortigaunt or another friendly human character; however, these ideas were abandoned for the simplicity of sticking to a single supporting character.<ref name="phillip"/> Other material cut from the games includes [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] technology called "Vorti-Cells", which were meant to siphon power from captive Vortigaunts in City 17. The player would then be able to free Vortigaunts from these devices to gain their assistance.<ref name="raising the bar"/>

==Attributes==
===Society===
Vortigaunts are very intelligent and social creatures. In ''Half-Life'', they serve as basic ground units for the [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] forces, often supporting heavier troops fighting the player and the humans in the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]]. They are capable of developing intelligent strategies and tactics to take on their enemies.<ref name="VortHL2"/> Initially, Vortigaunts are enslaved to the [[Nihilanth]], a large creature on Xen, who, in turn, claims it is a slave to unknown superiors.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 1998| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Interloper| quote='''Nihilanth''': Their slaves, we are their slaves, we are.}}</ref> On Xen, the Vortigaunts are used as factory workers and drones.<ref name="interloper"/> In ''Half-Life 2'', Vortigaunts indicate that this slavery has lasted for generations.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote='''Vortigaunt''': We have endured these chafing bonds for eons, yet a single moment of further servitude seems intolerable! How often have we slipped our yoke, only to find it choking us again.}}</ref> Despite this, Vortigaunts are shown to have developed an intellectual culture, valuing poetry,<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote='''Vortigaunt''': Our finest poet describes it thus: Gallum galla gilla ma.}}</ref> music<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote='''Vortigaunt''': Your song we sing and shall sing for eternity.}}</ref> and philosophy.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote='''Vortigaunt''': We are mindful of the words of our greatest philosopher: Kpnnum gninin vogenuk!}}</ref> In addition, Vortigaunts practise the husbandry of [[antlion (Half-Life)|antlions]], large insectoids that live in underground hives, as an ancestral tradition. The death of the Nihilanth at the hands of [[Gordon Freeman]] at the end of ''Half-Life'' frees the Vortigaunts from their slavery;<ref name="freedom">{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote = '''Vortigaunt''': While our own lay scattered at your feet, you severed the vortal cord that bound the Nihilanth to life, and to us.}}</ref> consequently the Vortigaunts see Freeman as a [[messianic figure]].

Vortigaunts possess their own method of vocal communication, "flux shifting", which they can be heard using in ''Half-Life 2''. This method of communication involves both speakers vocalising at the same time and cannot be understood by other species who lack the auditory anatomy to interpret the sounds.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Sandtraps| quote='''Vortigaunt #1''': The Freeman must excuse us. It is rude of us to commune by flux shifting in front of those whose vortal inputs are impaired. / '''Vortigaunt #2''': Yes, we will vocalize in your auditory language as a matter of courtesy. / '''Vortigaunt #1''': Unless we wish to say unflattering things about you. / '''Vortigaunt #2''': Just so.}}</ref> In addition to standard conversation, flux shifting can be used by Vortigaunts to communicate over long distances. Vortigaunts use scattered English words in ''Half-Life'' to taunt the player, although by ''Half-Life 2'' they have learned to speak at least the English language fluently, albeit using archaic words and grammatical structures. In addition, the Vortigaunts believe in a binding life-force referred to as the "Vortessence".<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote = '''Vortigaunt''': Communion of the Vortessence. And that other: a deeper mystery. No deeper than the void itself.}}</ref> The exact nature of the Vortessence is left unclear, although it is revealed that Vortigaunts believe the Vortessence is the fabric of the universe and connects everything.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote = '''Vortigaunt''': We are a tapestry woven of Vortessence. It is the same for you if only you would see it.}}</ref>

===Depiction===
In general, a Vortigaunt is a somewhat [[humanoid]] figure with two legs and two arms, but has an additional arm protruding from its thorax. Vortigaunts have mottled green skin and [[digitigrade]] legs, allowing them to move quickly. Typically, Vortigaunts have a slightly hunched posture. In addition, Vortigaunts have sharp teeth, clawed hands, strong senses, and their faces are dominated by a large red eye.<ref name="VortHL2E"/> In ''Half-Life'', this eye is surrounded by five smaller eyes,<ref name="VortHL1"/> although in ''Half-Life 2'' this has been reduced to three smaller eyes.<ref name="VortHL2"/> A key aspect of the Vortigaunts is their ability to summon energy to their command without the need for any equipment. In-game, this ability is most commonly used as a means of attack, with Vortigaunts hurling the energy towards foes in the form of green electrical bolts.<ref name="VortHL1"/> In addition, Vortigaunts have been shown to be able to use the energy for other purposes, such as assisting in repair work, removing rubble and blockages, recharging the player's [[HEV suit]] or powering up electrical generators.<ref name="VortHL2"/> Enslaved Vortigaunts are depicted with green collars and shackles,<ref name="VortHL1"/> although the means by which these control Vortigaunts is not explored. Vortigaunts are not typically seen wearing clothing, although several Vortigaunts are observed wearing lab coats and chef's clothing in the course of ''Half-Life 2'' and its expansions. Vortigaunts are depicted as [[carnivore|meat eaters]]; the player can observe Vortigaunts eating human corpses in ''Half-Life''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=hlstrategies.detail&id=14&game=4|title=''Half-Life'' Walkthrough: Lambda Core|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> and cooking [[headcrab]]s in ''Half-Life 2'',<ref name="WaterHazard"/> although ''Half-Life 2'' also shows Vortigaunts working in kitchens with chef hats, preparing soups and salads, suggesting that Vortigaunts are omnivores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&id=16&game=3|title=''Half-Life 2'' Walkthrough<U+2014>Chapter 5: Black Mesa East|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>

Vortigaunts are first introduced as one of the primary enemies in ''Half-Life''. They are frequently encountered by players throughout ''Half-Life'' and its three expansions, ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Opposing Force]]'', ''[[Half-Life: Blue Shift|Blue Shift]]'' and ''[[Half-Life: Decay|Decay]]''. They are portrayed as one of the sentient races of [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]], often working in groups or with more heavily armored Xen troops.<ref name="VortHL1">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HLGameInfo.Detail&id=7&game=4|title=Life Forms|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref> In the later stages of ''Half-Life'', Vortigaunts are seen working in factory-like environments, constructing or maturing the more heavily armored Xen troops in [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]-like capsules under the direction of other aliens in the Xen hierarchy.<ref name="interloper">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=hlstrategies.detail&id=17&game=4|title=''Half-Life'' Walkthrough: Interloper|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref>

In the [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative multiplayer]] expansion ''Decay'', players have the opportunity to assume the role of two Vortigaunts if they score highly on all missions. In this bonus mission, entitled "Xen Attacks", two Vortigaunts, designated as Drone Subjects X-8973 and R-4913, are given a mission by the Nihilanth to retrieve a number of crystals stolen from Xen by human scientists from the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]].<ref name="Decay">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Previews.Detail&id=67|title=''Half-Life: Decay''|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2006-11-12|accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref>

===''Half-Life 2''===
The role of the Vortigaunts is substantially changed in ''Half-Life 2''. Now acting as allies to the player, Vortigaunts have been freed as a result of protagonist [[Gordon Freeman]] killing the Nihilanth at the end of ''Half-Life''. Instead of acting with hostility towards humanity, the Vortigaunts are actively engaged in assisting the human resistance against the [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]], a multi-dimensional empire that has invaded and occupied [[Earth]] in between ''Half-Life'' and ''Half-Life 2''.<ref name="VortHL2"/> Vortigaunts are frequently seen at resistance compounds and stations,<ref name="WaterHazard">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&id=15&game=3|title=''Half-Life 2'' Walkthrough<U+2014>Chapter 4: Water Hazard|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref> often performing maintenance work or providing help with experiments, and sometimes assist the player by using their energy abilities to recharge the player's [[HEV suit]].<ref name="VortHL2">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&id=2&game=3|title=''Half-Life 2'' Allies|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref> However, a number of Vortigaunts are still in captivity, as at various points in the game, Vortigaunts are shown used as slave labor by the Combine; for example, one Vortigaunt is seen cleaning the floor of a Combine train station with a broom, wearing a similar collar to those worn in ''Half-Life''.<ref name="VortHL2"/>

Vortigaunts play a greater part in the story of the series in ''Half-Life 2''{{'}}s continuations, ''Episode One'' and ''Episode Two''. In ''Episode One'', Vortigaunts use unexplained powers to rescue [[Alyx Vance]], the series' main female character, from the top of the Combine Citadel in [[City 17]], saving her from the explosion of the Citadel's reactor at the end of ''Half-Life 2''.<ref name="VortHL2E">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&id=23&game=3|title=''Half-Life 2: Episode Two'' Allies|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref> The Vortigaunts also free Gordon Freeman from the [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] imposed on him at the end of ''Half-Life 2'' by his enigmatic employer, the [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]], much to the G-Man's irritation.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]] |developer=[[Valve Corporation]]| level = Direct Intervention |date=2006-06-01 |platform=[[Personal computer|PC]] |quote='''G-Man:''' We'll see... about ''that''. }}</ref> ''Episode Two'' dedicates much of the early part of the game to the Vortigaunts, with a group of four Vortigaunts working to heal Alyx Vance after she is mortally wounded by a Combine [[Half-Life 2: Episode Two#Enemies|Hunter]], while tracking and killing the Combine [[Combine Advisor|Advisors]] that fled the Citadel.<ref name="VortHL2E"/> One Vortigaunt accompanies the player and acts as combat support on an expedition into an antlion hive. In the latter stages of ''Episode Two'', a number of Vortigaunts are observed in the [[White Forest]] missile silo, performing various tasks to facilitate the launch of a satellite to close a Combine [[Portal (fiction)|super portal]].

The use of sandbox applications like ''[[Garry's Mod]]'' have allowed for the Vortigaunt to be used in a variety of [[webcomic]]s and [[machinima]] productions. For example, in the webcomic ''[[Concerned]]'', the inability for the players to harm allied non-player characters such as the Vortigaunt in ''Half-Life 2'' forms a recurring joke, where the protagonist Gordon Frohman constantly tries to shoot Vortigaunts due to their role as enemies in ''Half-Life''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-09-19|title=Issue #54|work=[[Concerned: The Half-Life and Death of Gordon Frohman]]|first=Christopher|last=Livingston|date=2005-09-19|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-04-14|title=Issue #137|work=[[Concerned: The Half-Life and Death of Gordon Frohman]]|first=Christopher|last=Livingston|date=2006-04-14|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> This eventually backfires on him, as when Vortigaunts try to rescue Frohman from the destruction of the Citadel, his hostile nature leads them to simply abandon him to his fate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-10-26|title=Issue #203|work=[[Concerned: The Half-Life and Death of Gordon Frohman]]|first=Christopher|last=Livingston|date=2006-10-26|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> Vortigaunts are occasionally featured in machinima productions, often taking on the roles of minor characters, such as janitors under Combine jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://litfusefilms.com/movies/combinenationepisodetwo/|title=''Combine Nation: Episode Two''|publisher=Lit Fuse Films|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> In addition, Vortigaunts are central to one ''Half-Life'' single-player [[Mod (computer gaming)|modification]], ''POV <U+2013> Point of View'', in which the player assumes the role of a Vortigaunt slave attacking Black Mesa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetphillip.com/posts/point-of-view-half-life/|title=''Point of View'' <U+2013> ''Half-Life''|publisher=PlanetPhillip|date=2008-04-07|accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref>
