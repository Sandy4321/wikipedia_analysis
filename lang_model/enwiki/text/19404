'''Four Lane Ends Metro station''' is a station on the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] network. It forms part of a major [[transport interchange]] located on the boundary of [[North Tyneside]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in [[England]]. The station is located at the junction of Benton Lane (A188), Benton Park Road (A191) and Front Street (A191). The crossroads has historically been important for [[trader]]s, [[cattle]] drivers, and those transporting local [[salt]]s and [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] towards the [[shipyard]]s and [[factory|factories]] in Newcastle.

The station was erected specifically to service the Metro [[light rail]] system, opening in August 1980.  Whilst the [[Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority]] utilised existing stations where possible, such as at [[Whitley Bay Metro station|Whitley Bay]] and [[Tynemouth Metro station|Tynemouth]], new stations such as Four Lane Ends had a definite corporate look of rectangular blocks, light enamelled wall panels, and black roofing.  The interchange was redeveloped in 2004 to include a [[multi-storey car park]] and improved facilities. Despite the redevelopment of the interchange the station concourse remains unchanged.

Nearby employment sites such as the Government complex at Longbenton, which houses [[Department for Work and Pensions|DWP]] and [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] offices, mean that the station is one of the most used on the Metro system. Regular [[bus]] services depart the interchange for destinations towards [[Killingworth]], the [[MetroCentre]], Newcastle city centre, [[Northumberland]] and [[Wallsend]].

==Ticketing anomalies==
Different zonal fare systems are used for Metro single tickets and inter-modal [[Transfare]] tickets, which means that for a number of journeys a Transfare may actually be cheaper than a standard Metro-only ticket.
