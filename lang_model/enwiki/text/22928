'''Simon Bolivar Buckner''' (April 1, 1823{{ndash}} January 8, 1914) fought in the [[United States Army]] in the [[Mexican<U+2013>American War]] and in the [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. He later served as the thirtieth [[governor of Kentucky]].

After graduating from the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, Buckner became an instructor there. He took a hiatus from teaching to serve in the Mexican<U+2013>American War, participating in many of the major battles of that conflict. He resigned from the army in 1855 to manage his father-in-law's [[real estate]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He returned to his native state in 1857 and was appointed [[adjutant general]] by Governor [[Beriah Magoffin]] in 1861. In this position, he tried to enforce [[Kentucky]]'s neutrality policy in the early days of the Civil War. When the state's neutrality was breached, Buckner accepted a commission in the Confederate Army after declining a similar commission to the [[Union Army]]. In 1862, he accepted [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s demand for an "unconditional surrender" at the [[Battle of Fort Donelson]]. He participated in [[Braxton Bragg]]'s failed invasion of Kentucky and near the end of the war became chief of staff to [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] in the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi]] Department. He was both the first and last Confederate general to surrender in the war.

In the years following the war, Buckner became active in politics. He was elected governor of Kentucky in 1887. It was his second campaign for that office. His term was plagued by violent feuds in the eastern part of the state, including the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]] and the [[Rowan County War]]. His administration was rocked by scandal when state treasurer [[James "Honest Dick" Tate]] absconded with $250,000 from the state's treasury. As governor, Buckner became known for [[veto]]ing special interest legislation. In the 1888 legislative session alone, he utilized more vetoes than the previous ten governors combined. In 1895, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. The following year, he joined the [[National Democratic Party (United States)|National Democratic Party]], or "Gold Democrats", who favored a [[sound money]] policy over the [[Free Silver]] position of the mainline Democrats. He was the Gold Democrats' candidate for [[Vice President of the United States]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1896|1896 election]], but polled just over one percent of the vote on a ticket with [[John Palmer (politician)|John Palmer]]. He never again sought public office and died of [[acute kidney failure|uremic poisoning]] on January 8, 1914.

==Early life==
Simon B. Buckner, Sr., was born at Glen Lily, his family's estate near [[Munfordville, Kentucky]].<ref name=kye136>Harrison in ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'', p. 136</ref> He was the third child and second son of Aylett Hartswell and Elizabeth Ann (Morehead) Buckner.<ref name=stickles4>Stickles, p. 4</ref> Named after the "South American soldier and statesman, [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var]], then at the height of his power",<ref name=stickles5>Stickles, p. 5</ref> the boy did not begin school until age nine, when he enrolled at a private school in Munfordville.<ref name=stickles6>Stickles, p. 6</ref> His closest friend in Munfordville was [[Thomas J. Wood]], who would become a [[Union Army]] general opposing Buckner at the [[Battle of Perryville]] and the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] during the Civil War.<ref>Noe, pp. 96&ndash;97</ref> Buckner's father was an iron worker, but found that Hart County did not have sufficient timber to fire his iron furnace.<ref name=stickles7>Stickles, p. 7</ref> Consequently, in 1838, he moved the family to southern [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]] where he organized an iron-making corporation.<ref name=stickles7 /> Buckner attended school in [[Greenville, Kentucky|Greenville]], and later at Christian County Seminary in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky|Hopkinsville]].<ref name=kye136 /><ref name=stickles9>Stickles, p. 9</ref>

On July 1, 1840, Buckner enrolled at the [[United States Military Academy]].<ref name=harrison119>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 119</ref> In 1844 he graduated eleventh in his class of 25 and was commissioned a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[2nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|2nd U.S. Infantry Regiment]].<ref name=harrison119 /><ref name=Eicher>Eicher, pp. 151&ndash;52</ref> He was assigned to garrison duty at [[Sackets Harbor, New York|Sackett's Harbor]] on [[Lake Ontario]] until August 28, 1845, when he returned to the Academy to serve as an assistant professor of [[geography]], [[history]], and [[ethics]].<ref>Stickles, p. 15, 24; Hewitt, p. 139</ref>

==Service in the Mexican<U+2013>American War==
In May 1846, Buckner resigned his teaching position to fight in the [[Mexican<U+2013>American War]], enlisting with the [[6th Infantry Regiment (United States)|6th U.S. Infantry Regiment]]. His early duties included recruiting soldiers and bringing them to the [[Texas]] border. In November 1846, he was ordered to join his [[company (military unit)|company]] in the field; he met them en route between [[Monclova]] and [[Parras (municipality)|Parras]]. The company joined [[John E. Wool]] at [[Saltillo]]. In January 1847, Buckner was ordered to [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] with [[William J. Worth]]'s [[division (military)|division]]. While [[Major general (United States) | Maj. Gen.]] [[Winfield Scott]] [[Siege of Veracruz|besieged Vera Cruz]], Buckner's unit engaged a few thousand Mexican cavalry at a nearby town called Amazoque.<ref>Stickles, pp. 16&ndash;17</ref>

On August 8, 1847, Buckner was appointed [[quartermaster]] of the 6th Infantry. Shortly thereafter, he participated in battles at [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] and [[Battle of Churubusco|Churubusco]], being slightly wounded in the latter battle. He was appointed a brevet [[First Lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] for gallantry at Churubusco and [[Battle of Contreras|Contreras]], but declined the honor in part because reports of his participation at Contreras were in error&mdash;he had been fighting in San Antonio at the time. Later, he was offered and accepted the same rank solely based on his conduct at Churubusco.<ref name=stickles17>Stickles, p. 17</ref>

Buckner was again cited for gallant conduct at the [[Battle of Molino del Rey]], and was appointed a brevet [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]]. He participated in the [[Battle of Chapultepec]], the Battle of Belen Gate, and the [[Battle for Mexico City|storming of Mexico City]]. At the conclusion of the war, American soldiers served as an army of occupation for a time, leaving soldiers time for leisure activities. Buckner joined the [[Aztec Club of 1847|Aztec Club]], and in April 1848 was a part of the successful expedition of [[Popocat<U+00E9>petl]], a volcano southeast of [[Mexico City]].<ref>Stickles, pp. 17&ndash;19</ref> Buckner was afforded the honor of lowering the American flag over Mexico City for the last time during the occupation.<ref name=Hewitt139>Hewitt, p. 139</ref>

==Interbellum==
After the war, Buckner accepted an invitation to return to West Point to teach infantry tactics.<ref name=stickles20>Stickles, p. 20</ref> Just over a year later, he resigned the post in protest over the academy's compulsory chapel attendance policy.<ref name=stickles22>Stickles, p. 22</ref> Following his resignation, he was assigned to a recruiting post at [[Fort Columbus]].<ref name=stickles23>Stickles, p. 23</ref> 

Buckner married Mary Jane Kingsbury on May 2, 1850, at her aunt's home in [[Old Lyme, Connecticut]]. Shortly after their wedding, he was assigned to [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota|Fort Snelling]] and later to Fort Atkinson on the [[Arkansas River]] in present-day [[Kansas]].  On December 31, 1851, he was promoted to first lieutenant, and on November 3, 1852, he was elevated to captain of the commissary department of the 6th U.S. Infantry in [[New York City]].<ref name=Hewitt139/> Previously, he had attained only a brevet to these ranks. Buckner gained such a reputation for fair dealings with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]], that the [[Oglala Lakota]] tribe called him Young Chief, and their leader, [[Yellow Bear]], refused to [[treaty|treat]] with anyone but Buckner.<ref>Stickles, pp. 25&ndash;29</ref> 

Before leaving the Army, Buckner helped an old friend from West Point and the Mexican<U+2013>American War, Captain [[Ulysses S. Grant]], by covering his expenses at a New York hotel until money arrived from Ohio to pay for his passage home. On March 26, 1855, Buckner resigned from the Army to work with his father-in-law, who had extensive real estate holdings in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. When his father-in-law died in 1856, Buckner inherited his property and moved to Chicago to manage it.<ref>Stickles, pp. 34&ndash;37</ref> 

Still interested in military affairs, Buckner joined the Illinois State Militia of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] as a [[Major (United States)|major]]. On April 3, 1857, he was appointed [[adjutant general]] of [[Illinois]] by [[Governor of Illinois|Governor]] [[William Henry Bissell]]. He resigned the post in October of the same year. Following the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]], a regiment of Illinois volunteers organized for potential service in a campaign against the [[Mormonism|Mormons]]. Buckner was offered command of the unit and a promotion to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. He accepted the position, but predicted that the unit would not see action. His prediction proved correct, as negotiations between the federal government and Mormon leaders eased tensions between the two.<ref name=stickles8>Stickles, p. 38</ref>

In late 1857, Buckner and his family returned to his native state and settled in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. Buckner's daughter, Lily, was born there on March 7, 1858. Later that year, a Louisville militia known as the Citizens' Guard was formed, and Buckner was made its captain. He served in this capacity until 1860, when the Guard was incorporated into the Kentucky State Guard's Second Regiment.<ref>Stickles, pp. 41&ndash;43</ref> He was appointed inspector general of Kentucky in 1860.<ref name=Hewitt139/>

==Civil War==
In 1861 Kentucky governor [[Beriah Magoffin]] appointed Buckner adjutant general, promoted him to [[Militia General (CSA)|major general]], and charged him with revising the state's militia laws.<ref name=powell68>Powell, p. 68</ref><ref name=nga>"Kentucky Governor Simon Bolivar Buckner", National Governors Association</ref> The state was torn between [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], with the legislature supporting the former and the governor the latter. This led the state to declare itself officially [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]]. Buckner assembled 61&nbsp;[[Company (military unit)|companies]] to defend Kentucky's neutrality.<ref name=powell68 /> 

The state board that controlled the militia considered it to be pro-[[Secession in the United States|secessionist]] and ordered it to store its arms.<ref name=stickles78>Stickles, p. 78</ref> On July 20, 1861, Buckner resigned from the state militia, declaring that he could no longer perform his duties due to the board's actions.<ref name=stickles78 /> That August he was twice offered a commission as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[Union Army]]&mdash;the first from general in chief [[Winfield Scott]], and the second from [[United States Secretary of War | Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]] following the personal order of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]&mdash;but he declined.<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis and His Generals'', p. 44; Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 120; Hewitt, p. 140</ref> After Confederate Maj. Gen. [[Leonidas Polk]] occupied [[Columbus, Kentucky]], violating the state's neutrality, Buckner accepted a commission as a [[History of Confederate States Army Generals#Brigadier general|brigadier general]] in the [[Confederate States Army]] on September 14, 1861, and was followed by many of the men he formerly commanded in the state militia.<ref name=Eicher/><ref>Gott, p. 37</ref> When his Confederate commission was approved, Union officials in Louisville indicted him for treason and seized his property. (Concerned that a similar action might be taken against his wife's property in Chicago, he had previously deeded it to his brother-in-law.)<ref name=Hewitt140>Hewitt, p. 140</ref> He became a [[division (military)|division]] commander in the Army of Central Kentucky under Brig. Gen. [[William J. Hardee]] and was stationed in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].<ref>Gott, p. 38</ref>

===Fort Donelson===
After Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant [[Battle of Fort Henry|captured Fort Henry]] on the [[Tennessee River]] in February 1862, he turned his sights on nearby [[Fort Donelson]] on the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]]. [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] commander [[Full General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] sent Buckner to be one of four brigadier generals defending the fort. In overall command was the influential politician and military novice [[John B. Floyd]]; Buckner's peers were [[Gideon J. Pillow]] and [[Bushrod Johnson]].<ref>Gott, pp. 133&ndash;35</ref> 

Buckner's division defended the right flank of the Confederate line of entrenchments that surrounded the fort and the small town of [[Dover, Tennessee]]. On February 14, the Confederate generals decided they could not hold the fort and planned a breakout, hoping to join with Johnston's army, now in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. At dawn the following morning, Pillow launched a strong assault against the right flank of Grant's army, pushing it back {{convert|1|to|2|mi|sigfig=1}}. Buckner, not confident of his army's chances and not on good terms with Pillow, held back his supporting attack for over two hours, which gavwe Grant's men time to bring up reinforcements and reform their line. Buckner's delay did not prevent the Confederate attack from opening a corridor for an escape from the besieged fort. However, Floyd and Pillow combined to undo the day's work by ordering the troops back to their trench positions.<ref>Gott, pp. 191&ndash;217; Connelly, ''Army of the Heartland'', pp. 121&ndash;23</ref>

Late that night the generals held a [[council of war]] in which Floyd and Pillow expressed satisfaction with the events of the day, but Buckner convinced them that they had little realistic chance to hold the fort or escape from Grant's army, which was receiving steady reinforcements. His defeatism carried the meeting. General Floyd, concerned he would be tried for [[treason]] if captured by the North, sought Buckner's assurance that he would be given time to escape with some of his [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]] regiments before the army surrendered. Buckner agreed and Floyd offered to turn over command to his subordinate, Pillow. Pillow immediately declined and passed command to Buckner, who agreed to stay behind and surrender. Pillow and Floyd were able to escape, as did cavalry commander Col. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]].<ref>Gott, pp. 238&ndash;49; Connelly, ''Army of the Heartland'', pp. 123&ndash;24</ref> 

That morning, Buckner sent a messenger to the Union Army requesting an armistice and a meeting of commissioners to work out surrender terms.<ref name=stickles164>Stickles, p. 164</ref> He may have been hoping Grant would offer generous terms, remembering the assistance he gave Grant when he was destitute, but Grant had no sympathy for his old friend and his reply included the famous quotation, "No terms except unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted. I propose to move immediately upon your works."<ref>Stickles, pp. 165&ndash;166</ref> To this, Buckner responded:

{{Quote|SIR:<U+2014>The distribution of the forces under my command, incident to an unexpected change of commanders, and the overwhelming force under your command, compel me, notwithstanding the brilliant success of the Confederate arms yesterday, to accept the ungenerous and unchivalrous terms which you propose.<ref>Gott, p. 257</ref>}}

Grant was courteous to Buckner following the surrender and offered to loan him money to see him through his impending imprisonment, but Buckner declined. The surrender was a humiliation for Buckner personally, but also a strategic defeat for the Confederacy, which lost more than 12,000&nbsp;men and much equipment, as well as control of the Cumberland River, which led to the evacuation of Nashville.<ref>Gott, pp. 262&ndash;67</ref>

===Invasion of Kentucky===
While Buckner was a Union [[prisoner of war]] at [[Fort Warren (Massachusetts)|Fort Warren]] in [[Boston]], Kentucky [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Garrett Davis]] unsuccessfully sought to have him tried for treason.<ref name=powell68 /> On August 15, 1862, after five months of writing poetry in solitary confinement, Buckner was exchanged for Union Brig. Gen. [[George A. McCall]].<ref>Hewitt, p. 140; Eicher, p. 152</ref> The following day he was promoted to [[History of Confederate States Army Generals#Major general|major general]]<ref name=stickles192>Stickles, p. 192</ref> and ordered to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], to join Gen. [[Braxton Bragg]]'s [[Army of Mississippi]].<ref>Stickles, p. 194; Hewitt, p. 140</ref>

Days after Buckner joined Bragg, both Bragg and Maj. Gen. [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] began an invasion of Kentucky. As Bragg pushed north, his first encounter was in Buckner's home town of [[Battle of Munfordville|Munfordville]]. The small town was important for Union forces to maintain communication with Louisville if they decided to press southward to Bowling Green and Nashville. A small force under the command of Col. [[John T. Wilder]] guarded the town. Though vastly outnumbered, Wilder refused requests to surrender on September 12&nbsp;and September 14. By September 17, however, Wilder recognized his difficult position and asked Bragg for proof of the superior numbers he claimed. In an unusual move, Wilder agreed to be blindfolded and brought to Buckner. When he arrived, he told Buckner that he (Wilder) was not a military man and had come to ask him what he should do. Flattered, Buckner showed Wilder the strength and position of the Confederate forces, which outnumbered Wilder's men almost 5-to-1. Seeing the hopeless situation he was in, Wilder informed Buckner that he wanted to surrender. Any other course, he later explained, would be "no less than willful murder."<ref>Noe, p. 70; Stickles, pp. 194&ndash;202; Connelly, ''Army of the Heartland'', pp. 229&ndash;30; Cozzens, ''This Terrible Sound'', pp. 14&ndash;15</ref>

Bragg's men continued northward to [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]] where they rested and sought supplies and recruits. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s [[Army of the Ohio]], the main Union force in the state, was pressing toward Louisville. Bragg left his army and met Kirby Smith in Frankfort, where he was able to attend the [[inauguration]] of Confederate Governor [[Richard Hawes]] on October 4. Buckner, although protesting this distraction from the military mission, attended as well and gave stirring speeches to the local crowds about the Confederacy's commitment to the state of Kentucky. The inauguration ceremony was disrupted by the sound of cannon fire from an approaching Union division and the inaugural ball scheduled for that evening was canceled.<ref>McDonough, p. 200; Noe, p. 129</ref>

[[File:Perryville 1545.png|thumb|[[Battle of Perryville]]: Actions in Buckner's sector (~ 3:45 p.m.)

]]
Based on intelligence acquired by a spy in Buell's army, Buckner advised Bragg that Buell was still ten miles from Louisville in the town of [[Mackville, Kentucky|Mackville]]. He urged Bragg to engage Buell there before he reached Louisville, but Bragg declined. Buckner then asked Leonidas Polk to request that Bragg concentrate his forces and attack the Union army at [[Perryville, Kentucky|Perryville]], but again, Bragg refused. Finally, on October 8, 1862, Bragg's army&mdash;not yet concentrated with Kirby Smith's&mdash;engaged Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook | Alexander McCook's]] corps of Buell's army and began the [[Battle of Perryville]]. Buckner's division fought under General Hardee during this battle, achieving a significant breakthrough in the Confederate center, and reports from Hardee, Polk, and Bragg all praised Buckner's efforts. His gallantry was for naught, however, as Perryville ended in a tactical draw that was costly for both sides, causing Bragg to withdraw and abandon his invasion of Kentucky. Buckner joined many of his fellow generals in publicly denouncing Bragg's performance during the campaign.<ref>Stickles, pp. 204&ndash;208; Noe, pp. 219&ndash;28, 339; McDonough, pp. 258&ndash;61; Connelly, ''Army of the Heartland'', pp. 264&ndash;67</ref> 

===Later Civil War service===
Following the Battle of Perryville, Buckner was reassigned to command the District of the Gulf, fortifying the defenses of [[Mobile, Alabama]].<ref name=Eicher/> He remained there until late April 1863, when he was ordered to take command of the Army of East Tennessee.<ref name=stickles213>Stickles, p. 213</ref> He arrived in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] on May 11, 1863, and assumed command the following day.<ref>Eicher, p. 152; Stickles, p. 216</ref> Shortly thereafter, his department was converted into a district of the Department of Tennessee under Gen. Bragg and was designated the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee.<ref>Hewitt, p. 140; Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory'', p. 149; Stickles, p. 220</ref> 

In late August, Union Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]] approached Buckner's position at Knoxville. Buckner called for reinforcements from Bragg at [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], but Bragg was being threatened by forces under Maj. Gen. [[William Rosecrans]] and could not spare any of his men. Bragg ordered Buckner to fall back to the [[Hiwassee River]]. From there, Buckner's unit traveled to Bragg's supply base at [[Ringgold, Georgia]], then on to [[Lafayette, Georgia|Lafayette]] and [[Chickamauga, Georgia|Chickamauga]]. Bragg was also forced from Chattanooga and joined Buckner at Chickamauga. On September 19&nbsp;and 20, the Confederate forces attacked and emerged victorious at the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]. Buckner's Corps fought on the Confederate left both days, the second under the "wing" command of Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], participating in the great breakthrough of the Union line.<ref>Stickles, pp. 226&ndash;231; Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory'', pp. 201&ndash;34; Cozzens, ''This Terrible Sound'', pp. 454&ndash;62; Woodworth, ''Six Armies in Tennessee'', pp. 89, 93&ndash;94</ref> 

After Chickamauga, Rosecrans and his [[Army of the Cumberland]] retreated to fortified Chattanooga. Bragg held an ineffective siege against Chattanooga, but refused to take any further action as the Union forces there were reinforced by Ulysses S. Grant and reopened a tenuous supply line.<ref>Woodworth, ''Six Armies in Tennessee'', pp.  129&ndash;68</ref> Many of Bragg's subordinates, including Buckner, advocated that Bragg be relieved of command. Thomas L. Connelly, historian of the Army of Tennessee, believes that Buckner was the author of the anti-Bragg letter sent by the generals to President [[Jefferson Davis]].<ref>Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory'', p. 239</ref> Bragg retaliated by reducing Buckner to division command and abolishing the Department of East Tennessee.<ref>Cozzens, ''Shipwreck of Their Hopes'', p. 24; Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory'', pp. 252&ndash;53; Hewitt, pp. 140&ndash;41</ref> 

Buckner was given a medical leave of absence following Chickamauga, returning to Virginia, where he engaged in routine work while recovering his strength. His division was sent without him to support Longstreet in the [[Knoxville Campaign]], while the remainder of Bragg's army was defeated in the [[Chattanooga Campaign]]. Buckner served on the court martial of Maj. Gen. [[Lafayette McLaws]] after that subordinate of Longstreet's was charged with poor performance at Knoxville.<ref>Hewitt, p. 141</ref> Buckner was briefly given command of Maj. Gen. [[John Bell Hood]]'s division in February 1864, and on March 8, he was given command of the reestablished Department of East Tennessee.<ref>Hewitt, p. 141; Stickles, pp. 241&ndash;249</ref> The department was a shell of its former self&mdash;less than one-third its original size, badly equipped, and in no position to mount an offensive.<ref name=stickles250>Stickles, p. 250</ref> Buckner was virtually useless to the Confederacy here, and on April 28, he was ordered to join Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederacy.<ref>Stickles, p. 252; Hewitt, p. 141</ref>

Buckner had difficulty traveling to the West and it was early summer before he arrived. He assumed command of the District of West Louisiana on August 4. Shortly after Buckner arrived at Smith's headquarters in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], Smith began requesting a promotion for him.<ref>Hewitt, p. 141; Stickles, p. 256</ref> The promotion to [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]] came on September 20.<ref>Eicher, p. 152; Hewitt, p. 141</ref> Smith placed Buckner in charge of the critical but difficult task of selling the department's cotton through enemy lines.<ref name=stickles262>Stickles, p. 262</ref> 

As news of Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender on April 9, 1865, reached the department, soldiers deserted the Confederacy in droves. On April 19, Smith consolidated the District of Arkansas with the District of West Louisiana; the combined district was put under Buckner's command. On May 9, Smith made Buckner his chief of staff. Rumors began to swirl in both Union and Confederate camps that Smith and Buckner would not surrender, but would fall back to Mexico with soldiers who remained loyal to the Confederacy. Though Smith did cross the [[Rio Grande]], he learned on his arrival that Buckner had traveled to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] on May 26 and arranged terms of surrender.<ref>Stickles, p. 265&ndash;270; Hewitt, p. 141</ref> At Fort Donelson, Buckner had become the first Confederate general of the war to surrender an army; at New Orleans, he became the last.<ref name=foote>Foote, p. 1021</ref> The surrender became official when Smith endorsed it on June 2.<ref name=foote />

==Postbellum life==
The terms of Buckner's parole in Shreveport, Louisiana, on June 9, 1865, prevented his return to Kentucky for three years. He remained in New Orleans, worked on the staff of the ''Daily Crescent'' newspaper, engaged in a business venture, and served of the board of directors of a fire insurance company, of which he became president in 1867.<ref name=Eicher/><ref name=stickles282>Stickles, p. 282</ref> His wife and daughter joined him in the winter months of 1866 and 1867, but he sent them back to Kentucky in the summers because of the frequent outbreaks of [[cholera]] and [[yellow fever]].<ref name=stickles281>Stickles, p. 281</ref>

Buckner returned to Kentucky when he was eligible in 1868 and became editor of the Louisville ''Courier''.<ref name=Eicher/> Like most former Confederate officers, he petitioned the [[United States Congress]] for the restoration of his [[civil rights]] as stipulated by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]. He recovered most of his property through lawsuits and regained much of his wealth through shrewd business deals.<ref name=kye136 /> 

On January 5, 1874, after five years of suffering with [[tuberculosis]], Buckner's wife died. Now a widower, Buckner continued to live in Louisville until 1877 when he and his daughter Lily returned to the family estate in Munfordville. His sister, a recent widow, also returned to the estate in 1877. For six years, these three inhabited and repaired the house and grounds of Glen Lily, which had been neglected during the war and its aftermath. On June 14, 1883, Lily Buckner married [[Morris B. Belknap]] of Louisville, and the couple made their residence in Louisville. On October 10 of the same year, Buckner's sister died, and he was left alone.<ref>Stickles, pp. 313&ndash;322</ref>

==Political career==
Buckner had a keen interest in politics and friends had been urging him to run for governor since 1867, even while terms of his surrender confined him to Louisiana. Unwilling to violate these terms, he instructed a friend to withdraw his name from consideration if it was presented. In 1868, he was a delegate to the [[1868 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] that nominated [[Horatio Seymour]] for president.<ref name=stickles297>Stickles, p. 297</ref> Though Buckner had favored [[George H. Pendleton]], he loyally supported the party's nominee throughout the campaign.<ref name=stickles298>Stickles, p. 298, 318</ref> 

In 1883, Buckner was a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.<ref name=tapp213>Tapp, p. 213</ref> Other prominent candidates included [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Thomas Laurens Jones]], former congressman [[J. Proctor Knott]], and [[List of mayors of Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville mayor]] [[Charles Donald Jacob]].<ref name=tapp213 /> Buckner consistently ran third in the first six ballots, but withdrew his name from consideration before the seventh ballot.<ref name=tapp213 /><ref name=stickles319>Stickles, p. 319</ref> The delegation from [[Owsley County, Kentucky|Owsley County]] switched their support to Knott, starting a wave of defections that resulted in Jones' withdrawal and Knott's unanimous nomination.<ref name=tapp213 /> Knott went on to win the general election and appointed Buckner to the board of trustees for the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the [[University of Kentucky]]) in 1884.<ref>Stickles, pp. 322&ndash;323</ref> At that year's state Democratic convention, he served on the committee on credentials.<ref name=stickles323>Stickles, p. 323</ref>

On June 10, 1885, Buckner married Delia Claiborne of [[Richmond, Kentucky]].<ref name=stickles324>Stickles, p. 324</ref> Buckner was 62; Claiborne was 28.<ref name=stickles323 /> Their son, [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.]], was born on July 18, 1886.<ref name=stickles332>Stickles, p. 332</ref>

===Governor of Kentucky===
[[File:Governor Simon B Buckner.jpg|thumb|right|Governor Simon Bolivar Buckner|alt=A color portrait of an older gentleman with white hair and a white goatee]]
Delegates to the 1887 state Democratic convention nominated Buckner unanimously for the office of governor. A week later, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s chose [[William O. Bradley]] as their candidate. The [[Prohibition Party]] and the Union Labor Party also nominated candidates for governor. The official results of the election gave Buckner at plurality of 16,797 over Bradley.<ref>Stickles, pp. 336&ndash;344</ref>

Buckner proposed a number of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] ideas, most of which were rejected by the legislature. Among his successful proposals were the creation of a state board of tax equalization, creation of a parole system for convicts, and codification of school laws. His failed proposals included creation of a department of justice, greater local support for education and better protection for forests.<ref>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', pp. 120&ndash;121</ref>

Much of Buckner's time was spent trying to curb violence in the eastern part of the state. Shortly after his inauguration, the [[Rowan County War]] escalated to vigilantism, when residents of the county organized a posse and killed several of the leaders of the feud. Though this essentially ended the feud, the violence had been so bad that Buckner's adjutant general recommended that the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] dissolve Rowan County, though this suggestion was not acted upon. In 1888, a posse from Kentucky entered [[West Virginia]] and killed a leader of the Hatfield clan in the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]]. This caused a political conflict between Buckner and [[Governor of West Virginia|Governor]] [[Emanuel Willis Wilson]] of [[West Virginia]], who complained that the raid was illegal. The matter was adjudicated in federal court, and Buckner was cleared of any connection to the raid. Later in Buckner's term, feuds broke out in [[Harlan County, Kentucky|Harlan]], [[Letcher County, Kentucky|Letcher]], [[Perry County, Kentucky|Perry]], [[Knott County, Kentucky|Knott]], and [[Breathitt County, Kentucky|Breathitt]] counties.<ref>Stickles, pp. 348&ndash;355, 367</ref>

A major financial scandal erupted in 1888 when Buckner ordered a routine audit of the state's finances which had been neglected for years.<ref name=kye136 /> The audit showed that the state's longtime treasurer, [[James "Honest Dick" Tate]], had been mismanaging and [[embezzlement|embezzling]] the state's money since 1872.<ref name=kye136 /> Faced with the prospect that his malfeasance would be discovered, Tate absconded with nearly $250,000 of state funds.<ref name=kye136 /> He was never found.<ref name=stickles358>Stickles, p. 358</ref> The General Assembly immediately began [[impeachment]] hearings against Tate, convicted him ''[[in absentia]]'', and removed him from office.<ref name=stickles358 /> State auditor Fayette Hewitt was [[censure]]d for neglecting the duty of his office, but was not implicated in Tate's theft or disappearance.<ref name=stickles355>Stickles, p. 355</ref>

During the 1888&nbsp;session, the General Assembly passed 1,571&nbsp;bills, exceeding the total passed by any other session in the state's history. Only about 150&nbsp;of these bills were of a general nature; the rest were special interest bills passed for the private gain of legislators and those in their constituencies. Buckner [[veto]]ed 60&nbsp;of these special interest bills, more than had been vetoed by the previous ten governors combined. Only one of these vetoes was overridden by the legislature. Ignoring Buckner's clear intent to veto special interest bills, the 1890&nbsp;legislature passed 300&nbsp;more special interest bills than had its predecessor. Buckner vetoed 50&nbsp;of these. His reputation for rejecting special interest bills led the Kelley Axe Factory, the largest axe factory in the country at the time, to present him with a ceremonial "Veto Hatchet".<ref>Stickles, pp. 360&ndash;361, 374&ndash;375</ref> 

When a tax cut passed over Buckner's veto in 1890&nbsp;drained the state treasury, the governor loaned the state enough money to remain solvent until tax revenue came in.<ref name=kye136 /> Later that year, he was chosen as a delegate to the state's constitutional convention.<ref name=kye136 /> In this capacity, he unsuccessfully sought to extend the governor's appointment powers and levy taxes on churches, clubs, and schools that made a profit.<ref name=harrison121>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 121</ref>

===Later career===
After his term as governor, Buckner returned to Glen Lily.<ref name=kye136 /> In 1895, he was one of four candidates nominated for a seat in the U.S. Senate &mdash;the others being the incumbent, [[Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn|J. C. S. Blackburn]]; outgoing governor [[John Y. Brown (1835<U+2013>1904)|John Y. Brown]]; and congressman [[James B. McCreary]].<ref name=stickles402>Stickles, p. 402</ref> The Democratic party split over the issue of [[bimetalism]].<ref name=harrison122>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 122</ref> Buckner advocated for a gold standard, but the majority of Kentuckians advocated "[[Free Silver]]".<ref name=stickles403>Stickles, p. 403</ref> Seeing that he would not be able to win the seat in light of this opposition, he withdrew from the race in July 1895.<ref name=stickles403 /> In spite of his withdrawal, he still received 9&nbsp;of the 134&nbsp;votes cast in the General Assembly.<ref name=tapp357>Tapp, p. 357</ref>

At the [[1896 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago, the Democrats nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] for [[President of the United States|president]] and adopted a platform calling for the free coinage of silver. [[Sound money]] Democrats opposed Bryan and the free silver platform. They formed a new party&mdash;the [[National Democratic Party (United States)|National Democratic Party]], or Gold Democrats&mdash;which Buckner joined. At the new party's state convention in Louisville, Buckner's name was proposed as a candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. He was given the nomination without opposition at the party's national convention in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]]. Former Union general [[John M. Palmer (politician)|John Palmer]] was chosen as the party's nominee for president.<ref>Stickles, pp. 408&ndash;409</ref>

Palmer and Buckner both had developed reputations as independent executives while serving as governors of their respective states. Because they had served on opposite sides during the Civil War, their presence on the same ticket emphasized national unity. The ticket was endorsed by several major newspapers including the ''[[Chicago Chronicle]]'', ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'', ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', ''[[Richmond Times]]'', and ''[[New Orleans Picayune]]''. Despite these advantages, the ticket was hurt by the candidates' ages, Palmer being 79&nbsp;and Buckner 73. Further, some supporters feared that voting for the National Democrat ticket would be a wasted vote and might even throw the election to Bryan. Ultimately, Palmer and Buckner received just over one percent of the vote in the election.<ref name=beito566>Beito, pp. 563&ndash;566</ref>

Following this defeat, Buckner retired to Glen Lily but remained active in politics. Though he always claimed membership in the Democratic party, he opposed the [[political machine|machine politics]] of [[William Goebel]], his party's gubernatorial nominee in 1899. In 1903, he supported his son-in-law, Morris Belknap, for governor against Goebel's [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]], [[J. C. W. Beckham]]. When the Democrats again nominated William Jennings Bryan in the [[United States presidential election, 1908|1908 presidential election]], Buckner openly supported Bryan's opponent, Republican [[William Howard Taft]].<ref>Stickles, pp. 416&ndash;421</ref>

At 80&nbsp;years of age, Buckner memorized five of [[William Shakespere|Shakespere]]'s plays because [[cataract]]s threatened to blind him, but an operation saved his sight.<ref name=harrison121 /> On a visit to the [[White House]] in 1904, Buckner asked President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to appoint his only son as a cadet at West Point, and Roosevelt quickly agreed.<ref>Stickles, pp. 420&ndash;421</ref> His son would later serve in the U.S. Army and be killed at the [[Battle of Okinawa]] during [[World War II]].<ref>Hughes, p. 137</ref>

Following the deaths of [[Stephen D. Lee]] and [[Alexander P. Stewart]] in 1908, Buckner became the last surviving Confederate soldier with the rank of lieutenant general.<ref name=stickles421>Stickles, p. 421</ref> The following year, he visited his son, who was stationed in Texas, and toured old Mexican<U+2013>American War battlefields where he had served.<ref name=harrison122 /> In 1912, his health began to fail.<ref name=harrison122 /> He died on January 8, 1914, after a week-long bout with [[Acute renal failure|uremic poisoning]].<ref name=harrison122 /> He was buried in [[Frankfort Cemetery]] in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]].<ref name=nga />
