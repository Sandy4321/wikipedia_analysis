</ref>  Following an [[Football Association|F.A.]] Commission, the club was ousted from the amateur game in 1905, deemed a professional organisation.  Later that year Norwich were elected to play in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] and with increasing crowds, they were forced to leave Newmarket Road in 1908, moving to The Nest, a disused chalk pit.  During the [[First World War]], with football suspended and facing spiralling debts, City went into voluntary [[liquidation]] on [[10 December]], [[1917]].<ref name=earlyhistory>{{Cite web

The earliest known recorded link between the club and canaries, comes in an interview recorded in the [[Eastern Daily Press]] with newly appointed manager, [[John Bowman (football manager)|John Bowman]] in April 1905. The paper quotes him saying "Well I knew of the City's existence... I have... heard of the canaries."<ref name=p24>{{cite book

By February 1907, the nickname '''Canaries''' had come more into vogue; thoughts that an FA Cup tie against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] (nicknamed "Throstles" after a bird) was "a bird -singing contest" were dismissed by the [[polymath]] [[C.B.

1963 saw the record attendance for Carrow Road, with a crowd of 43,984 for a 6th round F.A. Cup match against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], but in the wake of the [[Ibrox_disaster#Second_Ibrox_disaster|Ibrox stadium disaster]] in 1971, safety licences were required by clubs which resulted in the capacity being drastically reduced to around 20,000.  A two-tier terrace was built at the River End and soon after seats began to replace the terraces.  By 1979 the stadium had a capacity of 28,392 with seats for 12,675.  A fire in 1984 partially destroyed one of the stands which eventually led to its complete demolition and replacement by 1987 of a new City Stand, which chairman Robert Chase described as "Coming to a football match within the City Stand is very much like going to the theatre <U+2013> the only difference being that our stage is covered with grass".<ref name=carrow/>  After the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in 1989 and the subsequent outcome of the [[Taylor Report]] in 1990, the stadium was converted to all-seater with the corners being filled.  Today, Carrow Road is an all-seater stadium, with a capacity of 26,034.<ref name=stadium>{{Cite web

Locally, much is made of the informal title "[[Pride of Anglia]]". Fans variously claim the title for either winning the East Anglian Derby, finishing highest in the league, having the better current league position, having the more successful club history or for reasons without any apparent logical basis.  The club's main local rival is [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].  When Norwich and Ipswich meet it is known as the '[[East Anglian Derby]]', or, informally, as the '[[Old Farm Derby]]', a comic reference to the '[[Old Firm]] Derby' played between [[Scotland|Scottish]] teams [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].<ref>{{Cite web

[[Ron Ashman]] holds the record for Norwich appearances, having played 592 first-team matches between 1947 and 1964. [[Ralph Hunt]] holds the record for the most goals scored in a season, 31 in the [[1955-56 in English football|1955&ndash;56]] season in [[Football League Third Division South|Division Three (South)]], with [[Johnny Gavin]] the top scorer over a career - 122 between 1948 and 1955.

The club's widest victory margin in the league was their 10&ndash;2 win against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in the Division Three (South) in 1930.  Their heaviest defeat in the league was 10&ndash;2 against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in 1908 in the [[Southern League]].

Norwich's record home attendance is 43,984 for a sixth round [[F.A. Cup]] match against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on [[30 March]], [[1963]].  With the introduction of regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, it is unlikely that this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future. 

The highest transfer fee received for an Norwich player is <U+00A3>7.25&nbsp;million, from [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] for [[Dean Ashton]] in January 2006, while the most spent by the club on a player was <U+00A3>3.5&nbsp;million for [[Robert Earnshaw]] from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the same month.<ref>{{Cite web
