'''William Seward Webb''', [[Medical Doctor|M.D.]] (January 31, 1851 <U+2013> October 29, 1926) was a businessman, and [[Inspector General]] of the [[Vermont]] [[militia]] with the rank of [[Colonel]]. He was a founder and former President of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].

==Biography==
He was born on January 31, 1851 to [[James Watson Webb]]. He studied [[medicine]] in [[Vienna]], [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]]. Returning to America, he entered the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] and was graduated from there in 1875. For several years he practiced medicine, and then forsook the profession for [[finance]] at the behest of his wife's family, establishing the [[Wall Street]] firm of W. S. Webb & Co. In 1883, he married [[Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt]], daughter of [[William H. Vanderbilt]].  Eliza's brother George went on to create the [[Biltmore Estate]], one of America's grandest country estates.  

In 1883, Webster Wagner, the president of the Wagner Palace Car Company, was crushed between two of his own railroad cars. Vanderbilt owned a controlling interest in the company, and asked his new son-in-law to take over the firm. William Seward invited his brother [[H. Walter Webb]] to join him, which started them both on careers in the railroad business. The Wagner Palace Car Company was subsequently merged with the [[Pullman Company]]. Dr. Webb later became President of the [[Fulton Chain Railway Company]], the [[Fulton Navigation Company]], and the [[Raquette Lake Transportation Company]]. He was the builder and President of the [[Mohawk and Malone Railway]].  His railroads were instrumental in opening the [[Adirondacks]] to the tourism rush of the mid- to late 19th century.

Dr. Webb served as [[Inspector General]] of the [[Vermont]] [[militia]] with the rank of [[Colonel]]. He served a term in the Vermont Legislature in the 1890s. 

He died on October 29, 1926 and was survived by his wife, Lila Vanderbilt Webb, three sons <U+2013> J. Watson, William Seward, and Vanderbilt <U+2013> and one daughter, Frederica.

==Legacy==
The Webbs for thirty years lived at 680 Fifth Avenue, New York. This house, a wedding gift from [[William H. Vanderbilt]] to his daughter, was sold in 1913 to [[John D. Rockefeller]]. The Webb property at [[Shelburne, Vermont]] was created from more than thirty separate farms on the shores of [[Lake Champlain]] and is known today as [[Shelburne Farms]]. The property is a [[National Historic Landmark]], and one of the main concert sites of the [[Vermont Mozart Festival]]. The former Webb estate has stunning views and some of the grandest barns of any [[Gilded Age]] property.  A great horseman, Dr. Webb had a large collection of carriages, many of which are on display today at the Shelburne Museum. The Vanderbilt Webb's other country estate was an Adirondack [[Great Camp]] named [[NeHaSane]], a game preserve of some 200,000 acres (800&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), much of which was later donated to the State of New York to become part of the [[Adirondack Park]]. The town of [[Webb, New York]] in the park is named after him.
