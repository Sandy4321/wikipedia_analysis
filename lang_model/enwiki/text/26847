The '''Bombardment of Sal<U+00E9>''' was a naval attack against the Moroccan city of [[Sal<U+00E9>]] that took place between 26 and 27 November 1851, in response to the looting of a French cargo ship by residents of the city. After seven hours of fighting, the Moroccan artillery suffered severe damage, and the French bombarded the city through the night, damaging the city's infrastructure and the [[Great Mosque of Sal<U+00E9>]].

French losses were minimal, with only four dead and 18 wounded. Between 18 and 22 Moroccans died, two-thirds of whom were civilians. The French forces withdrew, and both sides claimed victory.

==Background==
[[File:Battle-Isly.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Isly]] in 1844]]
After the [[French conquest of Algeria]], [[Abdelkader El Djezairi]] declared war against France, and requested assistance from Sultan [[Abd al-Rahman of Morocco]]. When the Sultan responded favorably, it triggered the [[Franco-Moroccan War]].{{sfn|L'<U+00C9>conomiste|2009|p=18}} France sent warships to bombard [[Tangier]] on 6 August 1844, destroying large parts of the city and its defenses. The French then bombarded [[Essaouira]], and occupied the [[Iles Purpuraires]].{{sfn|L'<U+00C9>conomiste|2009|p=18}} After the French army defeated the Moroccan cavalry at the [[Battle of Isly]] on 14 August 1844, Sultan Abd al-Rahman asked for peace with France, leading to the signing of the [[Treaty of Tangiers (1844)|Treaty of Tangier]] on 10 September 1844. Morocco's defeat caused a revolt in [[Rabat]];{{sfn|L'<U+00C9>conomiste|2009|p=18}} in Sal<U+00E9>, the city's nobility, known as the [[Sharif]], sent a letter to the Sultan complaining about the lack of weapons and ammunition in the city.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=238}}

Meanwhile, the French government's anger against Morocco was increasing. A series of incidents in October 1849 damaged relations between both countries;{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=238}} a series of assassinations directed at the French frontier had occurred, and the French Consul had requested the dismissal of Pacha Ouchda, who was believed to have caused these issues.<ref name="Morning Chronicle">{{cite news|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000082/18491012/017/0006|title=Express from Paris|date=12 October 1849|publisher=''[[The Morning Chronicle]]''|p=6|subscription=yes}}</ref> From 1845 to 1851, Morocco had a serious agricultural crisis caused by a drought, resulting in crop failure. The people of Morocco were suffering as the price of wheat and barley reached unprecedented heights. In Sal<U+00E9>, many people were starving, and the agricultural crisis and anger towards France ultimately led to the bombardment of Sal<U+00E9>.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=238}}{{sfn|Godard|1860|p=621}}{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=239}}

==Preliminaries==
[[File:Louis Thomas Napol<U+00E9>on du Bourdieu (1804-1857).jpg|thumb|right|Louis Dubourdieu was tasked by the French Secretary of the Navy to take action against Sal<U+00E9>, and five vessels were assigned to him.]]
On 1 April 1851, a French cargo ship carrying 98 [[long ton|tons]] of goods from Gibraltar to Rabat capsized near the coast of Sal<U+00E9>.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=239}} A few tons of goods were rescued, and were stored in the city for safekeeping.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=239}} Sal<U+00E9> turned out to be less than safe, however; by the next day, hundreds of townspeople were scavenging and stealing the goods.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=239}} The thieves were thwarted by [[Abdelhadi Zniber]], but only temporarily.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=239}} By the end of the raids, the French had lost 11,391 [[French franc#French Empire and Restoration|franc germinal]]s worth of goods.{{sfn|Dukk<U+0101>l<U+012B>|1986|pp=335<U+2013>336}}{{sfn|Coust<U+00E9>|1989|pp=77<U+2013>78}}

French diplomat [[Nicolas Prosper Bour<U+00E9>e]] reported the situation in Sal<U+00E9> to the French, and accused the people in the city of piracy. Bour<U+00E9>e recommended sending military forces to the city; the French government obliged.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=239}}{{sfn|Godard|1860|p=622}}

On 10 November 1851, the French Secretary of the Navy tasked [[Louis Dubourdieu]] with the execution of the action against Sal<U+00E9>,{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=2}} and five vessels were assigned to him in this regard: ''Henri IV'' (armed with 100 cannons and captained by [[Louis Henri de Gueydon]]), the ''Sane'' (14 cannons),<ref name="Sane">{{cite web|title=Sane|publisher=DossiersMarine|url=http://dossiersmarine.free.fr/fs_f_F5.html|language=French}}</ref> the ''Gomer'' (14 cannons),<ref name="gomer">{{cite web|title=Gomer class|publisher=DossiersMarine|url=http://dossiersmarine.free.fr/fs_f_F5.html|language=French}}</ref> the ''Narval'' (4 cannons),<ref name="narval">{{cite web|title=Narval|publisher=Net-Marine|url=http://www.netmarine.net/bat/smarins/narval/ancien.htm|language=French}}</ref> and the ''Caton'' (6 cannons).{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=2}}{{sfn|Dubochet|pp=369<U+2013>370}}<ref name="canton">{{cite book|url=http://www.memoireetactualite.org/presse/26COURDROMAR/PDF/1853/26COURDROMAR-18530324-P-0001.pdf|title=Courrier de la Dr<U+00F4>me et de l<U+2019>Ard<U+00E8>che|publisher=Memoireetactualite|language=French}}</ref> The fleet gathered in [[C<U+00E1>diz]] on 19 November, and after being supplied with food and coal, sailed for Sal<U+00E9> on 21 November.{{sfn|Dubochet|pp=369<U+2013>370}}

==Bombardment==
[[File:Gomer-F Roux img 3112.jpg|thumb|right|''Gomer'', a steam frigate with 14 cannons]]
On 24 November, some of the French ships traveled to Tangier, where they picked up [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] Julius Doazan and his secretary, Fleurat, on ''Narval''. Later that evening, ''Caton'' reached Sal<U+00E9> and offered safe passage to Rabat for the British [[consul]] Elton and his family, in anticipation of the bombardment of the city.{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=2}} The following day, at 11:00 a.m., ''Caton'' anchored between the cities of Rabat and Sal<U+00E9>. Its commander demanded an apology over the thefts and raids and immediate repayment for the stolen goods, under threat of bombardment. The [[rais]] in the ports of both cities promised to answer to the French demands within three hours.{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=2}} Two hours later, all of the French ships had reached the mouth of the [[Bou Regreg]], between Rabat and Sal<U+00E9>.{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=3}}

The French crews of ''Henri IV'' received a telegraph from Admiral de Gueydon, suggesting that the bombardment of the city would begin soon,{{sfn|Dubochet|pp=369<U+2013>370}} which the crews welcomed with enthusiasm. By then, a large crowd of people in Rabat and Sal<U+00E9> had gathered to observe the French ships after they were spotted by Moroccan [[artillery battery|artillery]] operators. Admiral de Gueydon decided against starting the bombardment until consul Elton was aboard ''Canton''; the consul did not come aboard the ship until four hours later.{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=3}} At dawn on 26 November though, the British steamer ''Janus'' joined ''Caton'', and took the consul as its passenger.{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=3}}

The Moroccan soldiers in both Rabat and Sal<U+00E9> prepared to repel the French attack, and armed themselves with artillery.{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=3}} On the French side, ''San<U+00E9>'' had moved to the fort at the entrance to the Bou Regreg river; ''Henri IV'' was a short distance from the Moroccan batteries north of Sal<U+00E9>. ''Gomer'' moved to a suitable position to attack, and both ''Narval'' and ''Caton'' would provide logistical support.{{sfn|Dubochet|pp=369<U+2013>370}}{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=3}}

The French opened fire on the forts of Sal<U+00E9> at 10:00 a.m., and the Moroccans retaliated instantly with forty batteries of artillery weapons.{{sfn|Dubochet|pp=369<U+2013>370}}{{sfn|Dukk<U+0101>l<U+012B>|1986|pp=335<U+2013>338}} An hour into the confrontation, the batteries in Sal<U+00E9> were destroyed, and the artillery in Rabat were damaged to a level that they became almost useless.{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=3}}{{sfn|Dukk<U+0101>l<U+012B>|1986|pp=335<U+2013>338}} The French fire intensified, but at 3:30 p.m., the damaged batteries were removed from the city by Moroccan forces;{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=3}} however, resistance did not stop until 5:00 p.m.{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=4}} ''Sane'' and ''Gomer'', lacking for ammunition, withdrew from the battle,{{sfn|Godard|1860|p=623}} while ''Henri IV'' continued its barrage on the city until 7:00 a.m. the next morning.{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=4}}

==Aftermath==
{{Campaignbox Franco-Moroccan conflicts}}

The following day, Dubourdieu sent a report to the [[Minister of Defence (France)|Minister of War]] describing the French losses. ''Henri IV'' took several hits, with 1 dead and 9 wounded.{{sfn|Dubourdieu|1851|p=4}} The ''Sane'' suffered more damage than the ''Gomer'', but neither was seriously damaged. Three men were killed on the ''Sane'', and nine were wounded.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=239}}

The damage to Sal<U+00E9> was considerable; a wall from the [[Almohad Caliphate]] was severely damaged, and the [[Great Mosque of Sal<U+00E9>]] was struck by six cannonballs. Several homes were destroyed, and many were burnt down. Between 12 and 15 civilians were killed, along with six to seven soldiers.{{sfn|Dukk<U+0101>l<U+012B>|1986|p=337}} Tactically, the battle was a victory for France. In order to prevent Tangier from receiving a similar bombardment, Morocco agreed to pay 100,000 francs to the French on November 29, 1851.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=239}}

Politically, however, the battle is considered a failure for France. Initially, France had desired a revolt against the governor of Sal<U+00E9> to force repayment and avoid destruction of the city, but this did not occur.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=240}} The French demanded that those who killed Christians in the city be sentenced to death, and that thieves have their hands cut off; however, the governor of Sal<U+00E9> simply banished these people from the city.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=240}}

Following this confrontation, diplomatic relations between France and Morocco ended for several months,{{sfn|Dukk<U+0101>l<U+012B>|1986|p=337}} until a French diplomatic mission returned in 1852.{{sfn|Dubochet|pp=369<U+2013>370}}{{sfn|Godard|1860|p=623}} After the bombardment, Dubourdieu was promoted to Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor, and then to vice-admiral in February 1852.{{sfn|Louis Dubourdieu}}
