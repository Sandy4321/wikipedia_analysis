'''''Macrotarsomys petteri''''', also known as '''Petter's Big-footed Mouse''',<ref name=iucn/> is a [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] rodent in the genus ''[[Macrotarsomys]]''. With a head and body length of 150&nbsp;mm (5.9&nbsp;in) and body mass of 105&nbsp;g (3.7&nbsp;oz), ''Macrotarsomys petteri'' is the largest species of its genus. The upperparts are brown, darkest in the middle of the back, and the underparts are white to yellowish. The animal has long whiskers, short forelimbs, and long hindfeet. The tail ends in a prominent tuft of long, light hairs. The skull is robust and the [[molar (tooth)|molars]] are low-crowned and [[cusp (dentistry)|cuspidate]].

''Macrotarsomys petteri'' is now found only in the [[Mikea Forest]] of southwestern Madagascar, but [[subfossil]] records indicate that it was previously more widely distributed in southern Madagascar. Climatic changes and competition with introduced species may have led to the shift in its distribution. The Mikea Forest, the only place where it is still known to occur, is threatened by human development.

==Taxonomy==
During a 2003 biological inventory of the [[Mikea Forest]], a forest region of southwestern Madagascar, a single specimen of the rodent genus ''[[Macrotarsomys]]'' was collected.<ref name=GS452>Goodman and Soarimalala, 2005, p. 452</ref> This animal turned out to be distinct from both previously known species of the genus<U+2014>''[[Macrotarsomys bastardi]]'', which is widespread in western Madagascar, and the larger ''[[Macrotarsomys ingens]]'', known only from the [[Ankarafantsika National Park]]. Accordingly, [[Steven Goodman]] and Voahangy Soarimalala named it in 2005 as a new species, ''Macrotarsomys petteri''.<ref name=GS453>Goodman and Soarimalala, 2005, p. 453</ref> The [[specific name]], ''petteri'', honors French zoologist [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Petter]] for his contributions to the study of Malagasy rodents.<ref name=GS457>Goodman and Soarimalala, 2005, p. 457</ref> ''M.&nbsp;petteri'', the largest species in the genus, is most similar to ''M.&nbsp;ingens'', which may be its closest relative.<ref name=GS459>Goodman and Soarimalala, 2005, p. 459</ref>

==Description==
''Macrotarsomys petteri'' is a [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] rodent with short forelimbs and long hindfeet.<ref name=GS454>Goodman and Soarimalala, 2005, p. 454</ref> With a head and body length of 150&nbsp;mm (5.9&nbsp;in) and body mass of 105&nbsp;g (3.7&nbsp;oz) in the only known complete specimen,<ref name=GSt1>Goodman and Soarimalala, 2006, table 1</ref> it is much larger than ''M.&nbsp;bastardi'', and its measurements fall at or above the upper end of the known range of variation in ''M.&nbsp;ingens''.<ref name=GS457/> The upperparts are covered with soft and short, brown fur. Most cover hairs (the main part of the fur) are dark brown for the two-thirds closest to the base, then light brown, with a short dark brown tip. The middle of the back appears darker, because the cover hairs there are entirely dark brown. The hairs are 6 to 8&nbsp;mm (0.2 to 0.3&nbsp;in) long on the shoulders and 7 to 9&nbsp;mm (0.3 to 0.4&nbsp;in) on the back. The [[guard hair]]s are gray. Because the flanks lack entirely dark cover hairs, they are slightly lighter than the rest of the upperparts. They are sharply separated in color from the underparts, which are entirely white to buffish. The [[mystacial vibrissae]] (whiskers above the mouth) are long, up to 60&nbsp;mm (2.4&nbsp;in), and white or black in color. The [[pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]] (external ears) are dark brown and covered with fine gray hairs,<ref name=GS455>Goodman and Soarimalala, 2005, p. 455</ref> and ear length is 32&nbsp;mm (1.3&nbsp;in).<ref name=GSt1/>

Hindfoot length is 37&nbsp;mm (1.5&nbsp;in).<ref name=GSt1/> The upper sides of the feet are covered with grayish white fur, which extends around the claws to form [[ungual tufts]]. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is relatively short at 6&nbsp;mm (0.2&nbsp;in); the hallux (first digit) is 8&nbsp;mm (0.3&nbsp;in) long, and the other digits 11 to 12&nbsp;mm (0.4 to 0.5&nbsp;in).<ref>Goodman and Soarimalala, 2005, pp. 455<U+2013>456</ref> The tail is 238&nbsp;mm (9.4&nbsp;in) long<ref name=GSt1/> and naked in part.<ref name=GS455/> At the base, it is dark brown both above and below, but slightly lighter below. The upper side remains dark brown for much of its length, though the color does become lighter towards the tip. The lower side becomes mottled at about 55&nbsp;mm (2.2&nbsp;in) from the tip and then whitish at about 65&nbsp;mm (2.6&nbsp;in). ''Macrotarsomys petteri'' has a well-developed tuft at its tail tip, consisting of whitish and occasional light brown hairs. This tuft commences at about 130&nbsp;mm (5.1&nbsp;in) from the base with fairly short hairs and becomes more pronounced at 180&nbsp;mm (7.1&nbsp;in).<ref name=GS456>Goodman and Soarimalala, 2005, p. 456</ref> In contrast, ''M.&nbsp;ingens'' has a weaker, dark brown tuft.<ref name=GS457/>

''Macrotarsomys petteri'' has a large and robust skull with well-developed [[zygomatic arch]]es (cheekbones).<ref name=GS456/> The [[interorbital region]] of the skull (between the eyes) is smooth, as in ''M.&nbsp;ingens'', and lacks the shelves characteristic of ''M.&nbsp;bastardi''. The [[palate]] is broad and the [[incisive foramina]] (openings in the front portion of the palate) are long and broad.<ref name=GS457/> In the [[mandible]] (lower jaw), the root of the lower [[incisor]] is housed in a distinct [[capsular process]], a protuberance at the back of the jawbone. The lower [[masseteric ridge]] (a crest on the outer side of the mandible) is prominent.<ref name=Gea957>Goodman et al., 2006, p. 957</ref> As is typical of ''Macrotarsomys'', the [[molar (tooth)|molars]] are [[cusp (anatomy)|cuspidate]] and low-crowned.<ref name=GS457/>

==Distribution and ecology==
The single known living specimen, a young adult male, was collected at 80&nbsp;m (260&nbsp;ft) altitude in the [[Andaladomo]] forest (part of the Mikea Forest).<ref name=GS454/> The Andaladomo forest is different in vegetation from the rest of the Mikea Forest, and is similar to forests further to the north on Madagascar.<ref name=GS460>Goodman and Soarimalala, 2005, p. 460</ref> The animal was found in an isolated fragment of dry deciduous forest amid land cleared for maize cultivation. The trap was set at the foot of a tree surrounded by bushes and succulent plants.<ref name=GS454/> Other small mammals known from the Mikea Forest include ''Macrotarsomys bastardi'', the introduced [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''), several species of [[tenrec]]s, and the shrew ''[[Suncus madagascariensis]]''.<ref name=GS459/> Although only a single individual of ''M.&nbsp;petteri'' was caught during Goodman and Soarimalala's survey, which accrued 3100&nbsp;trap-nights, they argue that this does not necessarily mean the species is rare, since trapping rates for rodents in the dry forests of Madagascar are often variable depending on year and season.<ref name=GS460/> Nothing is known of its behavior, but the animal's morphology suggests it lives on the ground.<ref name=G242>Garbutt, 2007, p. 242</ref>

Subsequent to its discovery at the Mikea Forest, ''Macrotarsomys petteri'' was also found as a [[subfossil]] in cave deposits at [[Andrahomana]] in far southeastern Madagascar, a find reported in 2006.<ref name=Gea753>Goodman et al., 2006, p. 753</ref> There, it was found together with more abundant remains of the introduced black rat and [[house mouse]] (''Mus musculus''), as well as indigenous rodents such as ''Macrotarsomys bastardi''. Two ''M.&nbsp;petteri'' bones were [[radiocarbon dated]] to 790<U+2013>410&nbsp;BCE and 150<U+2013>390&nbsp;CE, respectively, a period when the local climate became drier and humans first appeared.<ref name=Gea957/> ''Macrotarsomys'' species are thought to burrow in sandy ground and would not be expected to enter caves; therefore, the subfossils are probably remains of animals eaten by birds of prey. Although ''M.&nbsp;petteri'' could conceivably persist in remnant pockets of wet habitat in southeastern Madagascar, searches at two sites near Andrahomana failed to confirm its presence. It may have become locally extinct in the area because of the drying climate and competition with the black rat.<ref name=Gea960>Goodman et al., 2006, p. 960</ref>

In 2009, ''Macrotarsomys petteri'' was also recorded from the cave of [[Ankilitelo]] in southwestern Madagascar.<ref>Muldoon et al., 2009, p. 1120</ref> Remains of a large ''Macrotarsomys'' had previously been reported from other southern Madagascar sites, and at least some of these may be ''M.&nbsp;petteri''.<ref>Goodman and Soarimalala, 2005, p. 459; Goodman et al., 2006, p. 960</ref> A [[karst]]ic deposit near [[Lake Tsimanampetsotsa]] (dated to the Late [[Pliocene]] or Early [[Pleistocene]] on unclear grounds) contained three species of ''Macrotarsomys'', including a very large one that may well be ''M.&nbsp;petteri''. Remains identified as ''Macrotarsomys ingens'' have been reported from a cave at [[Ankazoabo]] in southern Madagascar; these may also be ''M.&nbsp;petteri''.<ref name=GS459/>

==Conservation status==
The [[IUCN Red List]] assesses ''Macrotarsomys petteri'' as "[[Data Deficient]]", but notes that the species will very probably qualify as threatened if its current distribution turns out to be restricted to primary forest in the Mikea Forest. The Mikea Forest is one of the largest remaining forests of southwestern Madagascar, but it is not protected and is threatened by logging, pasture, and conversion to agricultural land.<ref name=iucn/>
