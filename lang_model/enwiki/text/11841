==History==

Around 1880, William K Heninger settled in a small basin above Altadena. Henninger was born in Virginia and had been a gold prospector. <ref name="forestry 1<U+201D>>{{cite web |url= http://fire.lacounty.gov/Forestry/OpsHenningerHistory1800LifeOfWKHenninger.asp
 |title= Los Angeles County Fire Department  | accessdate=2007-05-24 |format= |work= }} </ref> The area was originally purchased by Mr. Peter Stiel through the [[Homestead Act]]. Stiel<U+2019>s friend Henninger had been squatting on the area since 1884. <ref name="forestry 2<U+201D>>{{cite web | url= http://fire.lacounty.gov/Forestry/OpsHenningerHistory1800.asp |title= Los Angeles County Fire Department  | accessdate=2007-05-24 |format= |work= }} </ref>

Heninger was given the title captain by the other miners he worked with as a sign of respect. Henninger married a [[Baja California]] Indian known to us only as Teresa. Their first born, Natividad, was baptized at the [[San Gabriel Mission]] on December 1858. He and Teresa had three daughters: Louisa, Susana and Jesefa. <ref name="forestry 1<U+201D>>{{cite web |url= http://fire.lacounty.gov/Forestry/OpsHenningerHistory1800LifeOfWKHenninger.asp

Heninger built a house and a [[cistern]] for water storage. He planted fruit, vegetables, and hay and nut trees. The produce he then carried into town a mile and a half down the steep trail that ended in Eaton Canyon. In 1892 Heninger was visited by T. P. Lukens and R. J. Busch who started the very first experimental reforestation in California at Heninger Flats. <ref name="rippens">{{cite book |last= Rippens |first= Paul H.  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Heninger Flats: The story of William K. Heninger and the area that bears his name |year= 1999 |publisher= Copy-Rite Press |location= [[Alhambra, California]] |isbn= }} </ref> Upon his death in March of 1894, the property was willed to his daughters. The property was auctioned in  1895 to Harry C. and Harriet M. Allen of Pasadena. In October 1895, the Allens sold the property for $5,000 to four men who then sold the property to the Mt. Wilson Toll Road Company for $76,600 as part of the [[Mount Wilson Toll Road]]. <ref name="forestry 2<U+201D>>{{cite web | url= http://fire.lacounty.gov/Forestry/OpsHenningerHistory1800.asp |title= Los Angeles County Fire Department  | accessdate=2007-05-24 |format= |work= }} </ref>

In 1903, under the direction of Lukens, a [[nursery]] was established at Heninger Flats. During the years that followed the road was widened to accommodate the passage of equipment up to the [[observatory]] at [[Mt. Wilson]]. By 1917 the road was widened to the present width of twelve feet.<ref name="rippens">{{cite book |last= Rippens |first= Paul H.  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Heninger Flats: The story of William K.

Since 1928, the flats have been used as a high elevation forest nursery by the [[Los Angeles County Fire Department]]. <ref name="rippens">{{cite book |last= Rippens |first= Paul H.  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Heninger Flats: The story of William K.

The road is a popular hike, and the flats are a popular campground. The Henniger Flats Forestry Center is also used for conservation education. <ref name="hiking<U+201D>>{{cite web |url= http://www.pasadenacal.com/sports/hiking.html |title= Pasadena Convention and Visitors Bureau |accessdate=2007-05-24 |format= |work= }} </ref> The toll road was washed out by a landslide<!--when?--> and the trail is closed. <ref name="washout">{{cite news | first=Joe | last= Robinson | url=http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/outdoors/la-os-henninger15nov15,1,4305032.story?coll=la-outdoors-printedition | title= What a washout | publisher=Los Angeles Times| date= November 15, 2005 }}</ref><ref name="eaton<U+201D>>{{cite web |url= http://www.ecnca.org/Information/HikingTrails/Henninger_Flats.htm |title= Eaton Canyon Nature Center Associates |accessdate=2007-05-24 |format= |work= }} </ref>
