'''Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon''' is a [[castle]] located on the bank of the [[Vienne (river)|Vienne river]] in [[Chinon]], France. It was founded by [[Theobald I, Count of Blois]]. In the 11th&nbsp;century the castle became the property of the [[Counts and dukes of Anjou|counts of Anjou]]. In 1156 [[Henry II of England]], a member of the House of Anjou, took the castle from his brother Geoffrey after he had rebelled for a second time. Henry favoured the Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon as a residence: most of the standing structure can be attributed to his reign and he died there in 1189.

Early in the 13th&nbsp;century, King [[Philip II of France]] harassed the English lands in France and in 1205 he captured Chinon after a siege that lasted several months, after which the castle remained under French control. When King [[Philip IV of France|Philip&nbsp;IV]] accused the [[Knights Templar]] of [[heresy]] during the first decade of the 14th&nbsp;century, several leading members of the order were imprisoned there.

Used by Charles&nbsp;VII in the 15th&nbsp;century, the Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon became a prison in the second half of the 16th&nbsp;century, but then fell out of use and was left to decay. It has been recognised as a ''[[monument historique]]'' by the [[French Ministry of Culture]] since 1840. The castle, which contains a museum, is now owned and managed by the Indre-et-Loire General Council and is a major tourist attraction. In the early 21st&nbsp;century it was restored at a cost of 14.5&nbsp;million euros.

===Background===
The settlement of Chinon is on the bank of the Vienne river about {{convert|6|mi|0}} from where it joins the [[Loire River|Loire]]. From prehistoric times, when the settlement of Chinon originated,<ref>P<U+00E9>rouse de Montclos (1997), p.&nbsp;178</ref> rivers formed the major trade routes,<ref>Clark (1952), p.&nbsp;282</ref> and the Vienne joins the fertile southern plains of the [[Poitou]] and the city of [[Limoges]] to the thoroughfare of the Loire.<ref>Garrett (2011), p.&nbsp;xv</ref> The site was fortified early on, and by the 5th&nbsp;century a [[Gallo-Roman]] ''[[castrum]]'' had been established.<ref>Wheeler (1983), p.&nbsp;14</ref> [[Theobald I, Count of Blois]] built the earliest known castle on the mount of Chinon in the 10th&nbsp;century.<ref name=history>{{citation |url=http://www.forteressechinon.fr/en/editorial/35/history-of-the-fortress.html |title=History of the fortress |publisher=Fortresse Royale de Chinon |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> After [[Odo II, Count of Blois]] died in battle in 1037, [[Fulk III, Count of Anjou]] marched into [[Touraine]] to capture [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Langeais]] and then Chinon, some {{convert|22|km|abbr=on}} away. When Fulk arrived at Chinon the castle's garrison immediately sought terms and surrendered.<ref>Bachrach (1993), pp.&nbsp;239<U+2013>240</ref> In 1044, [[Geoffrey II, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]] (the count of Anjou) captured [[Theobald of Blois-Chartres]]. In exchange for his release, Theobald agreed to to recognise Geoffrey's ownership of Chinon, Langeais, and Tours.<ref>Bradbury (2007), p.&nbsp;102</ref> From then until the early 13th&nbsp;century, Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon descended through his heirs.

===Counts of Anjou===

According to contemporaneous chronicler [[Robert of Torigni]], on the death of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]] in 1151 his second son, who was also called [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]], inherited four castles. Robert did not specify which these were, but historian [[W. L. Warren]] speculated that Chinon, [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Loudun|Loudun]], and [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Mirebeau|Mirebeau]] numbered amongst these castles as they were in the territory which may have been traditionally the inheritance of the second oldest son. Geoffrey rebelled against his older brother, [[Henry II of England|Henry]], in 1152. Henry negotiated with the [[castellan]]s of the castles of Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau to surrender before laying siege to [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Montsoreau]]. Following the loss of Montsoreau, Geoffrey surrendered to his brother.<ref>Warren (1973), pp.&nbsp;45<U+2013>47</ref> By 1156 Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau were back under Geoffrey's control. That year he readied them for war as he rebelled against Henry a second time. In the intervening years, his brother had been crowned King Henry&nbsp;II of England at the end of a long-running [[The Anarchy|civil war]]. Henry besieged and captured Geoffrey's castles in the summer of 1156 and kept them under his control, giving Geoffrey an [[annuity]] of <U+00A3>1,500 in compensation.<ref>Warren (1973), p.&nbsp;65</ref> The presence of a treasury and one of Henry&nbsp;II's main arsenals marked Chinon as a particularly important castle in the 12th&nbsp;century.<ref>Warren (1973), p.&nbsp;591</ref> It was a primary residence of Henry&nbsp;II who was responsible for construction of almost all of the massive castle.<ref name=Stokstad37>Stokstad (2005), p.&nbsp;37</ref>

In 1173 Henry&nbsp;II betrothed his youngest son, Prince [[John, King of England|John]], to the daughter of Count [[Umberto III, Count of Savoy|Humbert]], an influential lord in [[Provence]]. John had no land, but as part of the arrangement Henry promised him the castles of Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau. Henry&nbsp;II's eldest son, also called [[Henry the Young King|Henry]], had been crowned King of England alongside his father but had no land of his own and was angered by the situation. His discontent grew and Henry the Young King demanded some of the land promised to him be handed over, claiming to have the support of the English barons and his father-in-law, King [[Louis&nbsp;VII of France]].<ref>Warren (1973), pp.&nbsp;117<U+2013>118</ref> While the king was at [[Limoges]] he was informed of a conspiracy involving his wife and sons to overthrow him. Choosing to keep his eldest son by his side, Henry&nbsp;II set off north to [[Normandy]], ensuring along the way that his castles in Aquitaine were prepared for war. En route they stayed at Chinon; under the cover of darkness Henry the Young King escaped and set off to Paris to join the court of Louis&nbsp;VII.<ref>Warren (1973), p.&nbsp;118</ref><ref>Gillingham (2002), p.&nbsp;42</ref> Two of Henry the Young King's brothers, Richard and Geoffrey, joined him in rebellion along with the barons of France and some in England.<ref>Flori (1999), p.&nbsp;33</ref> War followed, lasting until 1174, and Chinon, Loudun, and [[Ch<U+00E2>tellerault]] were key to Henry&nbsp;II's defence.<ref>Warren (1973), p.&nbsp;132</ref>

[[File:Douves s<U+00E9>ches et donjon ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Tour du Coudray, a [[keep]], was built during the reign of Philip Augustus,<ref name=history/> and in the early 14th&nbsp;century was used as a prison.<ref name=Stokstad38>Stokstad (2005), p.&nbsp;38</ref>]]
After the revolt ended in 1174, relations between Henry&nbsp;II and his sons continued to be strained. By 1187 Henry the Young King was dead, Richard was in line to inherit, and Henry&nbsp;II was on the brink of war with Philip&nbsp;II. In June that year Richard travelled to Paris with Philip&nbsp;II and struck up a friendship with the French king. Concerned his son might turn against him, Henry&nbsp;II asked him to return. Richard went to Chinon and raided the castle's treasury so he could fund the repair of his own castles in Aquitaine.<ref>Gillingham (2002), pp.&nbsp;82<U+2013>85</ref> In 1189 Richard and Philip were wreaking havoc in Maine and Toulouse, capturing Henry&nbsp;II's castles; the king was ill and went to Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon. He left briefly in July to meet with Richard and Philip&nbsp;II and agree a truce, and died at Chinon on on 6&nbsp;July. The king's body was taken to [[Fontevraud Abbey]] and Richard became king.<ref>Gillingham (2002), p.&nbsp;99</ref>

In 1199, John succeeded his brother as King of England. By 1202 his lands in France were under threat from [[Philip&nbsp;II of France]], threatening the east, and the barons of [[Brittany]]. In January 1203 John sent a band of mercenaries to retrieve Queen [[Isabella of Angoul<U+00EA>me|Isabelle]] from Chinon as it was under threat from rebels.<ref>Warren (1978), pp.&nbsp;84<U+2013>86</ref> In the spring [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent]], took over as commander of Chinon's garrison; the war was not going in John's favour and in August that year he ordered the [[slighting|demolition]] of several castles, including [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Montr<U+00E9>sor]], to prevent them from being used by the enemy. By 1205, Chinon was one of the last castles in the Loire Valley.<ref>Powicke (1999), p.&nbsp;160</ref> Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon fell to French force in the Easter of 1205 after a siege of several months; damage to the castle meant the garrison was no longer able to hold out so [[sortie|sallied]] to meet the French outside the castle walls. Hubert de Burgh was injured and taken prisoner in the event, and would remain in captivity until 1207.<ref>Warren (1978), p.&nbsp;116</ref><ref>West (2004)</ref> Soon after Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon was captured, Philip&nbsp;II took Normandy from the England crown.<ref>Powicke (1999), p.&nbsp;264</ref> The French king was a prolific castle-builder and was responsible for building the cylindrical keep at Chinon, the Tour du Coudray. The round keep was typical of French design the period, a departure from usually square keeps, and was repeated by Philip&nbsp;II at the castles of [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Dourdan|Dourdan]], [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Falaise|Falaise]], [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Gisors|Gisors]], Laon, and [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Lillebonne|Lillebonne]].<ref name=Thompson43>Thompson (1991), p.&nbsp;43</ref>

Though it was not the reason they were built, castles could often be used as prisons. One such instance from the 14th&nbsp;century illustrates this aspect of Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon's history.<ref>King (1983), p.&nbsp;xvii</ref> Founded in the Holy Land as a [[crusade|crusading]] [[military order]] in the early 12th&nbsp;century, by the close of the 13th&nbsp;century the [[Knights Templar]] had gained swathes of lands in Europe, particularly France. King [[Philip&nbsp;IV of France]] had the members of the order in his kingdom arrested, accusing them of heretical practices. The leaders of the order, including the Grand Master [[Jacques de Molay]], were imprisoned at Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon,<ref>Barber (1993), pp.&nbsp;1<U+2013>2</ref> in the Tour du Coudray built by Philip&nbsp;II one century earlier.<ref name=Stokstad38/> Graffiti carved by the imprisoned knights can be seen on the walls of the tower.<ref>Ralls (2007), p.&nbsp;183</ref> In August 1308, [[Pope Clement V]] sent three cardinals to hear the leaders' confessions.<ref>Barber (1993), pp.&nbsp;107, 111</ref> The outcome was that in 1312 the pope issued a [[papal bull|bull]], the ''[[Vox in excelso]]'', suppressing the order and its property was given to the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. The leaders were sentenced to life imprisonment, apart from Jacques de Molay and [[Geoffrey de Charney]] who were burnt at the stake.<ref>Barber (1993), p.&nbsp;3</ref>

The [[Hundred Years' War]] in the 14th and 15th&nbsp;centuries was fought between the kings of England and France over the succession to the French throne. The war ended in 1453 when the English were finally ejected from France, but in the early 15th&nbsp;century the English under King [[Henry V of England|Henry&nbsp;V]] made significant territorial gains.<ref>Neillands (2001), pp.&nbsp;1<U+2013>4</ref> The [[Treaty of Troyes]] in 1420 made Henry&nbsp;V the heir apparent to the French throne but when the French king, [[Charles VI of France|Charles&nbs;VI]], and Henry&nbsp;V died  in the space of two months in 1422 the issue of succession was again uncertain. The English supported Henry&nbsp;V's son, [[Henry VI of England|Henry&nbsp;VI]] who was still a child, while the French supported recognised [[Charles VII of France|Charles&nbsp;VII]], the the [[Dauphin of France]].<ref>Neillands (2001), p.&nbsp;236</ref> Between 1427 and 1450 Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon was the residence of Charles,<ref>Stokstad (2005), p.&nbsp;xxxv</ref> when Touraine was virtually the only territory left to him in France, the rest being occupied by the Burgundians or the English.

On 6&nbsp;March 1429 [[Jeanne d'Arc|Joan of Arc]] arrived at Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon. She claimed to hear heavenly voices that said Charles would grant her an army to relieve the [[siege of Orl<U+00E9>ans]].<ref name=Neillands>Neillands (2001), pp.&nbsp;253<U+2013>258</ref> While staying at the castle she resided in the Tour du Coudray.<ref>Gies (1981), pp.&nbsp;45, 52</ref> Charles met with her two days after her arrival and then sent her to [[Poitiers]] so that she could be cross-examined to ensure she was telling the truth. Joan returned to Chinon in April where Charles granted her supplies and sent her to join the army at Orl<U+00E9>ans.<ref name=Neillands/>

In 1562 the ch<U+00E2>teau came briefly into the possession of the [[Huguenots]] and was turned into a state prison by [[Henry IV of France]]. [[Cardinal Richelieu]] was given the castle to prevent it from coming under the control of unfriendly forces, though he allowed it to fall into ruin. Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon was abandoned until 1793 when, during the [[Reign of Terror]], the castle was temporarily occupied by royalist [[Revolt in the Vend<U+00E9>e|Vendeans]].<ref>Chirol & Seydoux (1992), p.&nbsp;83</ref> Soon after, the castle lapsed back into decay.

[[File:Fort Saint Georges ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon.JPG|thumb|The remains of the Fort St&nbsp;George in 2005, before the visitor centre was built.]]
The 19th&nbsp;century saw increasing public interest in France's heritage and efforts were undertaken to preserve historic buildings. In 1830 the newly crowned [[Louis Philippe&nbsp;I]] created the role of Inspector-General of Historic Monuments. [[Prosper M<U+00E9>rim<U+00E9>e]], better known as a writer, assumed the position in 1834 and helped halt the decay that had set in at Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon and instigated repairs to the structure.<ref>Watts (2007), pp.39<U+2013>40</ref> Since 1840, the castle has been recognised as a ''[[monument historique]]'' by the [[French Ministry of Culture]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.annuaire-mairie.fr/monument-historique-chinon.html |title=Monuments Historiques et Immeubles prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>s sur Chinon |publisher=www.annuaire-mairie.fr |language=French |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref>

Between 2003 and 2010 the castle was the subject of a massive excavation and restoration project, costing 14.5 million euros. It was hoped that the restored castle would attract 250,000&nbsp;tourists a year with a visitor centre built in the Fort St-George, which was entirely excavated in advance. Before the visitor centre was built, the Fort St-George was the subject of an archaeological excavation which covered nearly {{convert|4000|m2}}, unearthing the entire interior of the fort. The royal lodgings (''logis royales'') which were roofless for two hundred years, were restored inside and out and given with a mock 15th-century interior. In addition about {{convert|150|m}} of the ramparts were also restored as well as the Tour du Coudray. Today, it is owned and managed by the Indre-et-Loire General Council and is a major tourist attraction.<ref name=restoration>{{citation |url=http://www.forteressechinon.fr/en/editorial/24/history-of-a-construction-site.html |title=History of a construction site |publisher=Fortresse Royale de Chinon |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref>

==Description==
[[File:Fort du Coudray vue a<U+00E9>rienne.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Fort du Coudray, the castle's westernmost enclosure]]
Standing on a rocky outcrop above the Vienne river, Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon has natural defences on three sides and a ditch dug along the fourth.<ref name=Larned147>Larned (1895), p.&nbsp;147</ref> Writing in the 12th&nbsp;century, the chronicler [[William of Newburgh]] commented that even before Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon came under the control of Henry&nbsp;II "its strength was such that nature seemed to vie with human art in fortifying and defending it".<ref>Quoted in Warren (1973), p.&nbsp;231</ref> That said, in the 12th&nbsp;century Henry&nbsp;II undertook a project of rebuilding the castle and much of the extant remains date from this period.<ref name=Stokstad37/> The stone used to build the castle was quarried on the site.<ref>Erlande-Brandenburg (1995), p.&nbsp;104</ref>

The castle is divided, along its length, into three enclosures, each separated by a deep dry [[moat]]. There are some similarities with [[Ch<U+00E2>teau Gaillard]], built by Richard the Lionheart in the closing years of the 12th&nbsp;century, which also consists of three three enclosures and sits on a promontory above a nearby town.<ref>Stokstad (2005), pp.&nbsp;37<U+2013>38</ref>

[[File:163-Chinon-model (cropped).jpg|thumb|Museum model of how Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon may have appeared]]
The easternmost enclosure is known as Fort St-Georges, the central is the Ch<U+00E2>teau du Milieu (the middle castle), while the westernmost is known as the Fort du Coudray. The Fort St-George was built under Henry&nbsp;II and contained a chapel dedicated England's patron saint. The Ch<U+00E2>teau du Coudray was added by Philip&nbsp;II in the early 13th&nbsp;century, while the Ch<U+00E2>teau de Milieu was built in the 12th and 14th&nbsp;centuries.<ref>Henneman (1995), p.&nbsp;218</ref> The round Tour du Coudray built by Philip&nbsp;II (which has parallels at [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Dourdan|Dourdan]], [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Falaise|Falaise]], [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Gisors|Gisors]], Laon, and [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Lillebonne|Lillebonne]]).<ref name=Thompson43/> guarded the bridge linking the Fort du Coudray and the Ch<U+00E2>teau de Milieu.<ref>Dunlop (1969), p.&nbsp;14</ref> While the [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] stands in many places, the buildings within the ch<U+00E2>teau do not survive to the same extent, and in many cases little more can be said about them than the location of their foundations and possible use.<ref name=Larned147/>{{clr}}
