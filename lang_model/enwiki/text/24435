The '''NWT Spruce Coupe''' is an [[United States|American]] [[homebuilt aircraft]] that was designed and produced by [[NWT Co]] of [[Charleston, Maine]]. When it was available the aircraft was supplied as a kit and also in the form of plans for amateur construction.<ref name="Aerocrafter">Purdy, Don: ''AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, Fifth Edition'', page 213. BAI Communications, 15 July 1998. ISBN 0-9636409-4-1</ref>

==Design and development==
The Spruce Coupe features a [[strut-braced]] [[low-wing]], a single-seat enclosed cockpit, fixed [[conventional landing gear]] and a single engine in [[tractor configuration]].<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

The aircraft is made from a combination of [[spruce]] or [[pine]], and [[fir]], [[birch]], [[mahogany]] [[plywood]] with its flying surfaces covered in [[Aircraft dope|doped]] [[aircraft fabric]]. Its {{convert|22.00|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} span wing has a wing area of {{convert|88.00|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, mounts [[Junkers]] [[aileron]]s and is braced with "V" struts to the [[landing gear]]. The cabin width is {{convert|23|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The acceptable power range is {{convert|40|to|50|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and the standard engine used is the {{convert|45|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Zenoah G-50]] twin-cylinder, [[horizontally opposed]], [[two stroke]], [[carburetor|carburetted]] [[aircraft engine]].<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

The Spruce Coupe has a typical empty weight of {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and a gross weight of {{convert|600|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, giving a useful load of {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. With full fuel of {{convert|6|u.s.gal}} the payload for the pilot, passengers and baggage is {{convert|270|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

The standard day, sea level, no wind, take off with a {{convert|45|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine is {{convert|75|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and the landing roll is {{convert|100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

The manufacturer estimates the construction time from the supplied kit as 500&nbsp;hours.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

==Operational history==
By 1998 the company reported that one aircraft had been completed and was flying.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />
