The network was also available in South Asia under a deal between [[STAR TV]] and [[A+E Networks|AETN International]] until November 21, 2008. The channel has consistently produced prime time [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] in the U.S. comparable to or higher than [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] itself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} 
On February 16, 2008, a new logo was launched on the flagship American network. While keeping their trademark "H", the triangle shape on the left acts as a play button for animation and fly-outs during commercials and shows. On March 20, 2008, The History Channel dropped the "The" and "Channel" parts of its name to become simply "History".<ref>International Herald Tribune [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/20/arts/TV-History-Channel.php Television's The History Channel Drops 'The' and 'Channel' from Its Name, Keeps History] March 20, 2008</ref>

== Programming ==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by History (TV channel)}}
{{POV-section|date=February 2012}}
Programming covers a wide range of [[History by period|periods]] and topics, while similar topics are often organized into themed weeks or daily marathons. It is seen in more than eighty million households. Subjects include military history, medieval history, the 18th century, the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, modern engineering, historical biographies, metaphysical subjects, mythical creatures, monsters, UFOs, aliens, truck drivers, alligator hunters, pawn stores, pickers, religions, disaster scenarios, and the apocalypse scenarios; a number of these documentaries are narrated by [[Edward Herrmann]]. Some of the aired programs compare contemporary culture and technology with the past, while other programs focus on subjects such as [[conspiracy theory]], religious interpretation, [[unidentified flying object|UFO]] speculation, and reality television. In particular, the [[History Channel]] has aired a number of films on [[Nostradamus]],<ref>See [http://shop.history.com/nostradamus/index.php/?v=history_show_nostradamus here]</ref> as well as a special series on [[doomsday]] that promulgates various popular [[2012 Phenomenon|2012]] theories, including films such as ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' (2005<U+2013>2007), ''2012, End of Days'' (2006), ''[[Last Days on Earth]]'' (2006), ''Seven Signs of the Apocalypse'' (2007), and ''Nostradamus 2012'' (2008).<ref>See its own online publicity for its ''Armageddon'' series [http://www.history.com/shows/armageddon here]</ref>

==Criticism and evaluation==
''History'' has in the past, particularly during the 1990s, been jokingly referred to as "The [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] Channel"<ref>Schone, Mark. [http://www1.salon.com/may97/media/media970508.html "All Hitler, All the Time"], [[Salon.com]], May&nbsp;8, 1997).</ref> for its extensive coverage of World War II.  Recently, much of its military-themed programming has now been shifted to its sister network, [[Military History (TV channel)|Military History]], and the network's programming now covers a diverse range of topics on history and hypothetical future events. 

The U.S.-based network has also been criticized for having "a bias towards [[History of the United States|American history]]", although another former sister network, [[History International]], covered more extensively history outside the US. In 2011 History International was rebranded as [[History 2|H2]] and now has more to do with the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/guide03/explore1.html|title=Time traveler's guide to the Roman Empire|publisher=Channel4.com|quote=The History Channel:
The website of the American cable channel has a bias towards American history, as evidenced by Extreme History with Roger Daltrey|accessdate=August 4, 2007}}</ref>

The network was also criticized by Stanley Kutner for airing the controversial series ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]'' in 2003; Kutner was one of three historians commissioned to review the documentary, which the channel disavowed and never aired again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/articles/4504.html|title=Why the History Channel Had to Apologize for the Documentary and the fact that it doesnt show history that Blamed LBJ for JFK's Murder|author=Stanley Kutner|publisher=History News Network|date=July 4, 2004|accessdate=August 4, 2007|quote=The History Channel has made a start in the right direction as it has totally disavowed the program and publicly promised it never will be shown again.}}</ref> On the other hand, programs such as ''[[Modern Marvels]]'' have been praised for their presentation of detailed information in an entertaining format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?ID=28158|title=Modern Marvels: Technology|author=Scott Weinberg|work=DVD Talk|date=May 29, 2007|accessdate=August 4, 2007|quote=If you're trying to throw your kids a little education, but in a fast-paced and colorful presentation, these "Modern Marvels" series come pretty highly recommended. Then again, I'm a mid-30s guy and I'm learning tons of new stuff from these programs.}}</ref>

Also some of the network's series, including ''[[Ice Road Truckers]]'', ''[[Ax Men]]'' and ''[[Pawn Stars]]'' garnered ratings in the U.S., while receiving criticism over the series' [[Channel drift|non-historical nature]]. [[Forbes|Forbes.com]] contributor Brad Lockwood criticized the History Channel's addition of "programs devoted to monsters, aliens and conspiracies" and wrote that ratings trends have influenced the network to focus on entertainment rather than actual historical programming.<ref name=Forbes>{{cite web|last=Lockwood|first=Brad|title=High Ratings Aside, Where's the History on History?|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/bradlockwood/2011/10/17/high-ratings-aside-wheres-the-history-on-history/|work=10/17/2011|work=Forbes|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref> U.S. Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] is a frequent critic of the channel and its lack of historical or educational programming, showing particular disdain for ''Ax Men'' and ''Pawn Stars''.<ref>Malone, Noreen (March 20, 2012).

''New York'' magazine. Retrieved April 2, 2012.</ref>

In his book ''2012: It's Not the End of the World'' Peter Lemesurier describes the channel's ''[[Nostradamus]]'' series, in which he was invited to participate, as 'largely fiction' and 'lurid nonsense'.<ref>For summaries and reviews see [http://nostraeffect.blogspot.com/ here].</ref> He also lists numerous misleading suggestions made in its films on the alleged Mayan 'end of the world' and the 'rare' galactic alignment that is supposed by [[John Major Jenkins]] to accompany it in [[2012 Phenomenon|2012]],<ref>Lemesurier, Derwen Publishing, 2011</ref> while Jenkins himself has described ''Decoding the Past'' as '45 minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism.'<ref>See his online comments on "How Not to Make a 2012 Documentary" [http://www.alignment2012.com/historychannel.html here]</ref>

In December 2011 [[Politifact]] gave the History Channel's claim that the United States Congress stayed open on Christmas Day for most of its first 67 years of existence a "pants on fire" rating, the lowest of its ratings, noting that its own research showed that both the Senate and the House had only convened once in those 67 years on a Christmas Day and adding that since there's a 1/7 chance of Christmas falling on a Sunday (where Congress did not meet in order to attend church) the claim that they would have convened almost every Christmas is "ridiculous".<ref name='Pf'>{{cite web|title=Comic Jon Stewart says Congress met most Christmas Days in its early years|url=http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/09/jon-stewart/comic-jon-stewart-says-early-congress-met-most-chr/|publisher=[[Politifact]]|accessdate=January 21, 2012|month=December 11|year=2011}}</ref> The claim had first been broadcast on the History Channel's show "Christmas Unwrapped <U+2013> The History of Christmas", before being subsequently picked up by the [[American Civil Liberties Union|American Civil Liberties Union's]] website on the "Origins of Christmas", and by [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central's]] program [[The Daily Show]].<ref name='Pf'/> The Daily Show responded the next day by stating it was their fault for trusting the History Channel, and satirized a clip from the History Channel about UFOs and Nazis by stating, "The next thing you know we'll all find out the Nazis did not employ alien technology in their quest for world domination".<ref name=HP>{{cite web|title=Jon Stewart Fires Back At Politifact Over War On Christmas|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/13/jon-stewart-politifact-war-on-christmas_n_1146118.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=January 21, 2012|month=December 13|year=2011}}</ref><ref name=Daily>{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Jon|title=Anne Burrell|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/mon-december-12-2011-anne-burrell|work=[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|accessdate=January 21, 2012|month=December 12|year=2011}}</ref>

==== Canada ====
The History Channel (as it was then known) was not initially related with a similar Canadian service, [[History Television]], which launched in 1999, and the channels' programming, while similar in nature, differed considerably throughout the 1990s. Indeed, the phrase "Not available in Canada" became a ''de facto'' slogan for the U.S. channel in its early years, as a result of its use in promotional ads on American channels which were imported to Canadian systems, particularly A&E.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lisnews.com/index.pl?issue=20040722&mode=|title=Librarian and Information Science News|publisher=LIS News|accessdate=August 4, 2007|quote=I always wondered why the History Channel commercials said not available in Canada.}}</ref>

As late as the late 2000s (decade), flagship History (U.S.) series were slow to reach Canadian viewers (if they got there at all); ''[[Ice Road Truckers]]'' debuted in 2007 but did not join the History Television schedule until early 2009. However, the relationship between the two counterparts has improved since then. On May 30, 2012, History Television's current owner [[Shaw Media]] announced that it will rebrand the channel as a Canadian version of History in the fall of 2012, through a licensing agreement with A+E Networks; the Canadian History channel will also receive a companion channel, licensed as a [[Category B services|Category B]] digital channel, that will be a Canadian version of [[H2 (TV channel)|H2]].<ref>[http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/shaw-media-and-a-e-to-launch-two-new-specialty-channels/1001418951/ Shaw Media and A&E to Launch Two New Specialty Channels], ''Broadcaster Magazine'', May 30, 2012.</ref>

Initially time-sharing with [[TV1000 Cinema]], it was later moved to the Swedish [[TV8 (Sweden)|TV8]] channel and continued broadcasting there until November 2004 when Viasat launched their own history channel, [[Viasat History]], in the Nordic region and closed down the History Channel. On February 1, 2007 the History Channel returned to Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden when the UK version was launched as a stand-alone channel on the [[Canal Digital]] satellite platform.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
