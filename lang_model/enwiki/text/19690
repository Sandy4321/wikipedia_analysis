'''Daniel Carter "Uncle Dan" Beard''' (June 21, 1850 <U+2013> June 11, 1941) was an [[United States|American]] illustrator, author, youth leader, and social reformer who founded the [[Sons of Daniel Boone]] in 1905, which Beard later merged with the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA).

==Early life==
Beard was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] into a family of artists.<ref name=rowan>{{cite book |last=Rowan |first=Edward L. |year =2005 |title=To Do My Best: James E. West and the History of the Boy Scouts of America |publisher=Las Vegas International Scouting Museum |isbn=0-9746479-1-8}}</ref> As a youth, he explored the woods and made sketches of nature. He lived at [[Daniel Carter Beard Boyhood Home|322 East Third Street]] in [[Covington, Kentucky]] near the [[Licking River (Kentucky)|Licking River]], where he learned the stories of [[Kentucky]] pioneer life.

He started an early career as an engineer and surveyor. He attended art school in [[New York City]]. He wrote a series of articles for ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine|St. Nicholas]]'' magazine that later formed the basis for the ''American Boy's Handy Book''. He was a member of the Student Art League, where he met and befriended [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] in 1883. He illustrated a number of books for [[Mark Twain]], and for other authors such as [[Ernest Howard Crosby|Ernest Crosby]].

Beard became the editor of ''Recreation'' magazine and wrote a monthly column for youth. He founded the [[Sons of Daniel Boone]] in 1905, basing it on American frontier traditions. He later moved his column to ''Women's Home Companion''. After conflicts with a new editor, he moved to the ''[[Pictorial Review]]''. Since ''Women's Home Companion'' retained the rights to the name, he simply renamed the organization to ''Boy Pioneers of America''.<ref name="ISCAjournal">{{cite journal| last=Scott| first=David C.| title=Ernest Thompson Seton and BSA - The Partnership Collapse of 1915| journal=International Scouting Collectors Association| volume=6| issue=2| month=June| year=2006| pages=10}}</ref>

He merged his organization into the [[Boy Scouts of America]] when it was founded in 1910. Beard became one of the first National Scout Commissioners of the Boy Scouts and served it for 30&nbsp;years. The work of both Beard and [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] are in large part the basis of the [[Traditional Scouting]] movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inquiry.net/traditional/index.htm |title=Traditional Scouting |publisher=American Traditional Scouting |accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref><ref name="ISCAjournal2">{{cite journal| last=Rowan| first=Edward L.| title=Dan Beard, Founder of the First Boy Scout Society| journal=International Scouting Collectors Association| volume=6| issue=4| month=December| year=2006| pages=28<U+2013>29}}</ref>

Beard also helped his sister organize the [[Camp Fire USA|Camp Fire Girls]] and became president of the [[Camp Fire Club of America]]. Beard was a [[Freemason]] in a [[List of Freemasons#Educators, religious leaders, and others|New York Lodge]], and an award for Masonic Scouters has been named in his honor.

Beard founded Boy Scouts Troop 1 in [[Flushing, New York]], which is believed to be the oldest continuously chartered Boy Scout Troop in the United States.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}  Beard became an Eagle Scout on February 15, 1915.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.memberconnections.com/olc/membersonly/NESA/old/old.cgi?FNC=todetailspage__Asearch_results_html___NESA___2231467|title=National Eagle Scout Association Online Community&nbsp;<U+2014> Online Eagle Directory: Beard, Daniel Carter |accessdate=2009-12-03}}</ref>

Prior to the establishment of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]], Dan Beard was recipient of the only "gold Eagle badge" awarded at the Second National Training Conference of Scout Executives held in 1922 in Blue Ridge, North Carolina.<ref name=rowan/>

Dan Beard was also involved with the [[Culver Academies]]' summer camp program for many years, which used his "Sons of Daniel Boone" program.  This program still exists as the Academy's Culver Woodcraft Camp.

Beard died on June 11, 1941, shortly before his 91st birthday at his home (named "Brooklands") in [[Suffern, New York]].<ref>June 12, 1941, New York Herald Tribune</ref> He was buried near his home at the Brick Church Cemetery in [[Spring Valley, New York]].<ref>Brick Church Cemetery aka Reformed Church Cemetery, Beard Family Plot - (Section D, Division 1, Plot 1, Grave 6),221 Brick Church Rd (Brick Church Rd and Hwy 306), Spring Valley NY 10977, 845-354-6785</ref> The National Program Director of the Boy Scouts of America, [[E. Urner Goodman]], was selected to be in charge of the beloved youth leader's funeral in Suffern. An estimated 2,000&nbsp;people lined the funeral route to the cemetery in [[Monsey, New York]], where {{nowrap|127 Boy Scouts}} formed an honor guard and assisted with traffic control.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scouts Officiate at Beard Funeral |date=June 16, 1941 | work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=FB0911F83F5B147B93C4A8178DD85F458485F9 |accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref>

==Honors and legacy==
The [[Daniel Carter Beard Bridge]], which carries [[Interstate 471|I-471]] across the [[Ohio River]], was named for him. A life-size bronze statue of Daniel Carter Beard and Boy Scout, created by world-renowned sculptor Kenneth Bradford, stands in [[Covington, Kentucky]]. The nearby [[Daniel Carter Beard Boyhood Home]] is now a [[National Historic Landmark]] in the [[Riverside Drive Historic District]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=244&ResourceType=Building |title=Beard, Daniel C., Boyhood Home |work=National Historic Landmarks |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref>

At the Philmont Scout Ranch in the Western Region, there is a staffed campsite named after him. At that campsite scouts work on low impact camping and participate in team building activities. The campsite is also on the edge of the Valle Vidal, and much vegetation around it is burned down due to many fires.

The J.H.S. 189 Daniel Carter Beard School in Flushing, New York carries his name, also a park near by the school also has the same name. In addition, Daniel Carter Beard School in Chicago, Illinois bears his name. A framed portrait of the old Scout greets all visitors as they enter the school.

The more camping-intensive half of the Forestburg Scout Camp in Forestburg, NY is named after Dan Beard.
