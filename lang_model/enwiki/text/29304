'''''Kala''''' is the second [[studio album]] by British musician [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]], released in August 2007.  The album features musical styles ranging from [[dance music]] to [[alternative hip hop]] and makes extensive use of ethnic sounds such as that of the [[urumee]], a drum native to [[India]].  It was mainly written and produced by M.I.A. and [[Switch (DJ)|Switch]], and features contributions from [[Timbaland]], [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]], [[Afrikan Boy]] and [[The Wilcannia Mob]].

M.I.A. named the album after her mother, in contrast to her first album ''[[Arular]]'', which was named after her father, and stated that her mother's struggles in life are a major theme of the recording.  She began recording the album in early 2006 and worked on the tracks in various locations around the world, including [[India]] and [[Trinidad]].  Planned sessions in the United States failed to occur, after M.I.A. was refused a long-term work [[Visa (document)|visa]] to enter the country.

''Kala'' was ranked as one of the best albums of the year by several publications, although others gave it a poor review.  It reached number&nbsp;18 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, 172 places higher than ''Arular'', and topped the magazine's [[Dance/Electronic Albums|Top Electronic Albums]] chart.  In the United Kingdom it reached number&nbsp;39 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], 59 places higher than her debut album.  ''Kala'' has spawned the [[Single (music)|singles]] "[[Boyz (song)|Boyz]]", "[[Jimmy (song)|Jimmy]]" and "[[Paper Planes]]".

==Composition and recording==
British musician M.I.A. (Mathangi "Maya" Arulpragasam) had released her debut album ''[[Arular]]'' in 2005, which achieved critical acclaim and sold 130,000 copies.<ref name="via" />  Plans for a second album were first revealed when she spoke later that year of her intention to work with American producer [[Timbaland]].

''Kala'' is named after M.I.A.'s mother, in contrast to her previous album, ''[[Arular]]'', which was named after her father.<ref>{{cite web | title=M.I.A. : Kala| url= http://drownedinsound.com/releases/11132/reviews/2310992- | publisher= [[Drowned in Sound]] | dateformat=dmy|accessdate=15 September 2009|date=23 December 2007|first=Sam|last=Lewis}}</ref>  She contends that ''Arular'' was a "masculine" album, but that ''Kala'' "is about my mum and her struggle<U+2013>how do you work, feed your children, nurture them and give them the power of information?"<ref name="urb">{{cite article | last=Hawkins|first=Si|title= M.I.A.: World Party| url= http://web.archive.org/web/20071013164618/http://www.urb.com/features/183/MIAWorldParty.php?PageId=2 | work = [[URB (magazine)|URB]] | date=17 May 2006| dateformat=dmy|accessdate=24 May 2007}}</ref><ref name="miapw">{{cite article | title= What's Up With M.I.A.| url= http://web.archive.org/web/20071013165645/http://philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=12933  | work = [[Philadelphia Weekly]] | date=6 September 2006 | dateformat=dmy|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref>  She further summed the album up as "shapes, colours, Africa, street, power, bitch, nu world, and brave."<ref>{{cite article | last=Empire|first=Kitty| title= 10 essential albums for Spring| url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2007/mar/11/featuresreview.review | work=[[The Observer]]|date=11 March 2007 | dateformat=dmy|accessdate=7 April 2007}}</ref>

The tracks "[[Boyz (song)|Boyz]]" and "Bird Flu" use [[urumee]] drums, a signature instrument of the [[gaana]] music of [[Tamil Nadu]], with which M.I.A. was familiar from her time spent living in Sri Lanka.  She later worked on these tracks in Trinidad, where she absorbed influences from the country's love of [[soca music]].<ref name="miafadermag07"/><ref name="villagevoicemia"/><ref name="miaexclaimkala07"/>  The lyrics of "Boyz" deal with the artist's time in Jamaica, and reference Jamaican dance moves.<ref name="miafadermag07"/>  The song "Hussel" began as an image in M.I.A.'s head of [[refugees]] being smuggled in boats, which she expressed musically by imagining how "if they banged that beat on the side of a boat, what would it sound like?  That's why it's all [[echo (phenomenon)|echo-y]] and [[submarine|submarine-y]]".<ref name="miafadermag07"/>  "World Town" used instrumentation from the temple music she recalled waking up to as a child in Sri Lanka.<ref name="miafadermag07"/>  After playing the track to children in Liberia, she expressed a desire to record a video for the song there.<ref name="miafadermag07"/>  M.I.A.'s "flat, unaffected vocals and delivery of lyrics" on some songs drew comparisons to British [[post-punk]] bands such as [[Delta 5]] and [[The Slits]].  She says it "was just what was happening to me naturally...I wanted it to be difficult and raw and not get into it so much".<ref name="villagevoicemia"/>

[[Afrikan Boy]], an exponent of [[grime (music)|grime]], a UK-based genre of [[urban music]], provided vocals on the song "Hussel".  M.I.A. opted to work with him because she felt that he seemed comfortable with his identity as a "real immigrant" and because his background was different to that of most [[Master of Ceremonies#Hip_hop_culture|MCs]] in the genre.<ref name="miaexclaimkala07"/>  She had originally planned to include "Mango Pickle Down River"<U+2014>her remix of [[The Wilcannia Mob]]'s song "Down River"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/29/1038386308756.html|title=The Wilcannia mob|date=29 November 2002|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=16 March 2010}}</ref><U+2014>on a [[mix-tape]], but chose to include it on the album because she felt it was rare to hear the "[[Aboriginal music|aboriginal voice]]" in recorded music,<ref name="miaexclaimkala07"/> and described opening track "Bamboo Banga" as having a "bamboo-stick beat, [[house (music)|house-y]] feel".<ref name="miaexclaimkala07">{{cite web | last= Lindsay|first=Cam| title= M.I.A.| work= [[Exclaim!]]| url= http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=114&csid2=946&fid1=27365| month= September | year= 2007 |dateformat=dmy|accessdate=6 March 2008}}</ref>  The song "[[Jimmy (song)|Jimmy]]" was included as a tribute to her mother and is M.I.A.'s version of an old [[Bollywood]] film track to which she used to dance at parties as a child.<ref name="villagevoicemia">{{cite article |last=Breihan|first= Tom| title= Status Ain't Hood interviews M.I.A.| url= http://blogs.villagevoice.com/statusainthood/archives/2007/07/status_aint_hoo_28.php | work = [[The Village Voice]] | dateformat=dmy|accessdate=6 March 2008|date=18 July 2007}}</ref>  Despite the involvement of [[Baltimore club]] musician Blaqstarr, "The Turn" turned out to be the album's only ballad, and the track has been described as the least like [[club music]].<ref name="miaexclaimkala07"/>  "20 Dollar" was written about the relative ease of buying [[AK-47]]s in war-torn [[Liberia]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Track by Track : M.I.A.|  publisher=[[VH1]]|first=Jonathan|last=Durbin|url= http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1567706/20070823/mia__4_.jhtml | date=23 August 2007 | dateformat=dmy|accessdate=23 December 2008}}</ref>  "XR2" recalls part of the artist's life growing up with [[rave music]] in early 1990s London,<ref name="miaexclaimkala07"/> while the song "[[Paper Planes]]" jokingly plays on M.I.A.'s problems with visas and certain perceptions of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web | title= M.I.A.
