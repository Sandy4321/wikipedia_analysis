'''Kilkis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: '''<U+0398>/<U+039A> <U+039A><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03BA><U+03AF><U+03C2>''') was a 13,000 ton [[Mississippi class battleship|''Mississippi''-class]] [[battleship]] originally built by the [[US Navy]] in 1904&ndash;1908. The [[Greek Navy]] purchased the ship in 1914, along with her sister {{USS|Idaho|BB-24|2}}, renamed [[Greek battleship Limnos|''Limnos'']]. ''Kilkis'' was named for the [[Battle of Kilkis-Lahanas]], a crucial engagement of the [[Second Balkan War]]. Armed with a main battery of four {{convert|12|in|abbr=on|0}} guns, ''Kilkis'' and her sister were the most powerful vessels in the Greek fleet.

The ship saw limited action during [[World War I]]. Greece's pro-German monarch, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] opted to remain neutral until October 1916, when pressure from the [[Triple Entente]] forced him to abdicate in favor of a pro-Entente government. For the remainder of the war, ''Kilkis'' operated solely as a harbor defense ship. In the immediately ensuing [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1919&ndash;1922, ''Kilkis'' supported Greek landings in Turkey and participated in the final Greek sea-borne withdrawal in 1922. She remained in service into the early 1930s, when she was used for a [[training ship]]. During the German invasion of Greece in 1941, she and her sister were sunk in [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] by German [[Ju-87 Stuka]] dive-bombers. The two ships were ultimately raised in the 1950s and broken up for scrap.

==Construction==

[[File:USS Mississippi BB-23 construction.jpg|thumb|left|The ship under construction, as ''Mississippi'']]
Laid down on 12 May 1904, the ship was launched on 30 September 1905 and commissioned into the [[United States Navy]] on 1 January 1908 as {{USS|Mississippi|BB-23|6}}.<ref name=G144>Gardiner, p. 144</ref> She served in the US Navy until 1914, when she and her sister were sold on 30 June 1914,<ref name=GG384>Gardiner & Gray, p. 384</ref> for the sum of $12,535,276.58.<ref>Cassimatis, p. 4</ref> The two ships were transferred to the Greek Navy in [[Newport News, Virginia]] the following month.<ref name=Hore>Hore, p. 89</ref> The ship was {{convert|382|ft}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|77|ft|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{convert|24|ft|8|in|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|13000|MT|sp=us}} as designed and up to {{convert|14465|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. The ship was powered by two-shaft vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s and eight coal-fired [[Babcock & Wilcox]] [[boiler]]s rated at {{convert|10000|ihp|lk=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|17|kn|lk=in}}. [[Lattice mast]]s were installed in 1909. She had a crew of 744 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=G144/>

The ship was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|12|in|abbr=on|0}} L/45 guns in two twin turrets, one on either end of the [[superstructure]]. Eight {{convert|8|in|abbr=on|0}} L/45 guns were mounted in four twin turrets, two on other side of the vessel [[amidships]]. The secondary battery was rounded out with eight {{convert|7|in|abbr=on|0}} L/45 guns mounted individually in [[casemate]]s along the length of the hull. Close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s was protected by a battery of twelve {{convert|3|in|abbr=on}} L/50 guns, six 3-pounder guns and two 1-pounder guns. The ship's armament system was completed by two {{convert|21|in|abbr=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s submerged in her hull.<ref name=G144/> ''Kilkis'' and ''Limnos'' were the most powerful vessels in the Greek Navy.<ref name=PH80>Paloczi-Horvath, p. 80</ref>

==Service history==
''Kilkis'' and ''Limnos'' quickly left the United States after their transfer in July, due to the rising tensions in Europe following the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] the previous month.<ref>Parramore et. al., p. 292</ref> After arriving in Greece, ''Kilkis'' became the [[flagship]] of the Greek fleet.<ref name=L64>Lautenschl<U+00E4>ger, p. 64</ref> At the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Greece's pro-German monarch, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]], decided to remain neutral. The [[Triple Entente|Entente]] powers landed troops in [[Salonika]] in 1915, which was a source of tension between France and Greece. Ultimately, the French seized the Greek Navy on 19 October 1916 (see ''[[Noemvriana]]'' and [[National Schism]]).<ref name=GG383>Gardiner & Gray, p. 383</ref> ''Kilkis'' was reduced to a skeleton crew and had the breech blocks for her guns removed to render them inoperable. All ammunition and torpedoes were also removed.<ref>Fotakis, p. 131</ref> Ultimately, a pro-Entente government replaced Constantine and declared war on the Central Powers. ''Kilkis'', however, did not see active service with Greece's new allies,<ref name=GG383/> and instead was used solely for harbor defense until the end of the war.<ref name=PH80/>

After the end of World War I ''Kilkis'' saw service during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], where she supported landings to seize Ottoman territory.<ref name=GG383/> On 5 May 1919, ''Kilkis'' and a pair of [[destroyer]]s escorted a convoy of six troop transports to [[Smyrna]], where the soldiers were disembarked.<ref>Dobkin, p. 65</ref> The Ottoman Navy had been interned by the Allies after the end of World War I, and so provided no opposition to the Greek Navy's activities. Operations came to a close in September 1922 when the Greek Army was forced to evacuate by sea, along with a sizable number of civilians, from Asia Minor. The fleet transported a total of 250,000 soldiers and civilians during the evacuation.<ref name=GG383/> 

[[File:Iowa sunk with Miss in background.jpg|thumb|right|''Kilkis'', sunk by German dive-bombers]]
During the operations in Turkey, ''Kilkis'' left the theater to represent Greece during the [[Fleet Review]] in [[Spithead]] to honor [[King George V]] on his birthday, 3 June 1920.<ref name=L64/> ''Kilkis'' underwent repairs and upgrades in 1926&ndash;1928 but was already obsolete due to low speed and low freeboard.<ref name=PP>Paizis-Paradellis, p. 96</ref> The ship had her boilers re-tubed during this refit.<ref name=GG384/> On 29 November 1929, the Greek navy announced that ''Kilkis'' would be withdrawn from service and broken up for scrap.<ref>Lautenschl<U+00E4>ger, pp. 64&ndash;65</ref> Consequently, in 1930, the [[armored cruiser]] [[Greek armored cruiser Georgios Averof|''Georgios Averof'']] replaced her as the fleet flagship. Nevertheless, ''Kilkis'' remained in service with the fleet until 1932.<ref name=L65>Lautenschl<U+00E4>ger, p. 65</ref> The ship was then withdrawn from the active fleet and used as a [[training ship]].<ref name=GG384/> 

A minor insurrection in the Greek fleet in March 1935 led to a reduction in the number of personnel in the Navy. As a result, ''Kilkis'' and ''Georgios Averof'' were removed from active service.<ref>Brassey, p. 42</ref> After the revolt, ''Kilkis'' was used as a training ship for anti-aircraft gunners.<ref name=L65/> She was used as a floating battery in 1940&ndash;1941, based in [[Salamis Island|Salamis]].<ref name=GG384/> Spare guns from ''Kilkis'' and ''Limnos'' were employed as coastal batteries throughout Greece.<ref>Kaufmann & Jurga, p. 312</ref> The ship was attacked in [[Salamis Naval Base]] by [[Ju-87 Stuka]] [[dive bomber]]s on April 23, 1941, during the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion of Greece]].<ref name=GG384/> ''Kilkis'' attempted to get underway to evade the attacks, but she was hit by several bombs and sank in the harbor.<ref name=L65/> Her wreck was refloated and broken up for scrap in the 1950s.<ref name=Hore/>
