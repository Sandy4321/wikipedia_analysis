'''{{Audio|Chinese-Nanjing.ogg|Nanjing}}''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: <U+5357><U+4EAC>; [[Romanization]]s: N<U+00E1>nj<U+012B>ng <small>([[Pinyin]])</small>, Nan-ching <small>([[Wade-Giles]])</small>, '''Nanking''' <small>([[Chinese Postal Map Romanization|Postal map spelling]])</small>; {{IPA-cmn|nan<U+02E7><U+02E5> t<U+0361><U+0255>i<U+014B><U+02E5><U+02E5>}}) is the [[capital city|capital]] of [[Jiangsu]] [[province of China|Province]], [[China]], and has a prominent place in [[Chinese history]] and [[Chinese culture|culture]]. The spellings 'Nanjing' and 'Nanking' both correspond to the Chinese name '<U+5357><U+4EAC>' which means "southern capital". 'Nanking' was widely used until the [[Pinyin]] language reform; then 'Nanjing' became the international standard spelling of the city's name.

Located in the lower [[Yangtze River]] drainage basin and [[Yangtze River Delta]] economic zone, Nanjing has always been one of China's most important cities. It served as the capital of China during several historical periods and is recognised as one of the [[Historical capitals of China|Four Great Ancient Capitals of China]]. Nanjing was the capital of the [[Republic of China]] before the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949. Nanjing is also one of the fifteen [[sub-provincial city|sub-provincial cities]] in the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[Political divisions of China|administrative structure]], enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a [[province of China|province]]. Nanjing has long been a national center of education, research, transport networks, and tourism. The city will host the [[2014 Summer Youth Olympics]].

With an urban population of over five million (2006), Nanjing is the second largest commercial center in the East China region, after [[Shanghai]]. It has been ranked fourth by [[Forbes magazine]] in its listing of "2008 Top 100 Business Cities in Mainland China", seventh in the evaluation of "Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength" issued by the [[National Statistics Bureau]], and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta. It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honor of China, Special Award of [[UN]] Habitat Scroll of Honor and National Civilized City.<ref>http://nanjing2009.fide.com/</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Segalen-27-Xiao-Xiu-Winged-lion-right.jpg|thumb|A sculpture at Xiao Xiu's tomb, which was built in 518.]]

Nanjing was one of the earliest established cities in south China. [[Fu Chai]], Lord of the [[State of Wu]], founded a fort named [[Yecheng]] (<U+51B6><U+57CE>) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BCE according to the legend. Later in 473 BCE, the [[State of Yue]] conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (<U+8D8A><U+57CE>) on the outskirts of the present-day [[Zhonghua Gate]]. In 333 BCE, after eliminating the State of Yue, the [[State of Chu]] built Jinling Yi (<U+91D1><U+9675><U+9091>) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. Under the [[Qin]] and Han dynasties, it was called Moling (<U+79E3><U+9675>). Since then, the city has experienced destruction and renewal many times.

=== Capital of the Six Dynasties ===
Nanjing first became a capital in 229 [[Common Era|CE]], where [[Sun Quan]] of the [[Wu Kingdom]] during the [[Three Kingdoms Period]] relocated its capital to [[Jianye]] (<U+5EFA><U+696D>), a city he extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in 211 CE. Although conquered by the West [[Jin Dynasty]] in 280, Nanjing and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated and developed into one of the commercial, cultural, and political centers of China during the rule of East Wu. This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries.

Shortly after the reunity of China, West Jin collapsed in wars. It was at first [[War of the Eight Princes|rebels of eight Jin princes]] for the throne and later rebels and invasion from [[Xiongnu]] and [[Five Hu|other nomadic peoples]] that destroyed the rule of Jin in nothern China. In 317, remnants of the Jin court, as well as Chinese nobles and wealthy families, fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing, which was then called [[Jiankang]] (<U+5EFA><U+5EB7>).

Thereafter, Nanjing remained as the capital of southern China during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties|North-South Division]] period for more than two and a half centuries. Possibly the best preserved monument of that era is the ensemble of the Tomb of [[Xiao Xiu]] (475<U+2013>518), a brother of [[Emperor Wu of Liang]], located in today's [[Qixia District]] on the eastern outskirts of the modern Nanjing.<ref>Albert E. Dien, <U+00AB>Six Dynasties Civilization<U+00BB>. Yale University Press, 2007
ISBN 0300074042. [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=CeJD5BaQPPsC Partial text] on Google Books. P. 190. A reconstruction of the original form of the ensemble is shown in Fig. 5.19.</ref><ref>[http://www.jllib.org.cn/ffy/nclmsksy/xiaoxiumusk.htm <U+6881><U+5B89><U+6210><U+5EB7><U+738B><U+8427><U+79C0><U+5893><U+77F3><U+523B>] (Sculptures at the Tomb of Xiao Xiu) {{zh icon}} (description and modern photos)</ref> The period of division ended when the [[Sui Dynasty]] reunified China and destroyed almost the entire city, turning it into a small town.

=== Medieval period ===
[[File:Pagoda at Qixia Temple Nanjing.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The [[<U+015A>ar<U+012B>ra]] [[pagoda]] in [[Qixia Temple]]. It was built in 601 and rebuilt in the 10th century.]]

The city of Nanjing was razed after Sui took it. It was reconstructed during late [[Tang Dynasty]]. It was again named capital (then known as Jinling (<U+91D1><U+9675>) during the short-lived [[Southern Tang]] (937<U+2013>975), who succeeded the [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Mote, F.W. |title=Imperial China (900-1800) |year=1999 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}</ref> Jiankang's textile industry burgeoned and thrived during [[Song Dynasty]] despite the constant threat from the northern foreign invasions. The [[Mongols|Mongolians]], the occupiers of China, further consolidated the city's status as a hub of the textile industry under the [[Yuan Dynasty]].

===Capital of Ming===
[[File:<U+041D><U+0430><U+043D><U+043A><U+0438><U+043D><U+0433>-<U+043A><U+0430><U+043F><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430>.JPG|thumb|Zhonghua Gate is the south gate of the walled city of Nanjing. The [[City Wall of Nanjing|city wall]] was built in the 14th century and is the longest in the world.]]
[[File:Shixianglu autumn.jpg|thumb|The Spirit Way of [[Ming Xiaoling]] complex, mausoleum of the first emperor of the [[Ming Dynasty]].]]

The first emperor of the [[Ming Dynasty]] [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] (the Hongwu Emperor) who overthrew the Yuan Dynasty rebuilt this city and made it the capital of China in 1368. He constructed what was the longest city wall in the world at that time. It took 200,000 laborers 21 years to finish the project. The present-day [[City Wall of Nanjing|city wall of Nanjing]] was mainly built during that time, and it is the longest surviving city wall in the world.

Nanjing remained the capital of the Ming Empire until 1421, when the third emperor of the dynasty, [[Zhu Di]], relocated the capital to [[Beijing]]. It is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400.<ref>[http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm Largest Cities Through History]</ref>

Besides the city wall, other famous Ming-era structures in the city included the [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum]] (still one of the most famous sites of the region) and the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing|Porcelain Tower]] (destroyed by the Taipings in the 19th century).

As the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections: it was home of admiral [[Zheng He]], who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as the sultan of [[Brunei]] [[Abdul Majid Hassan]], who died during his visit to China in 1408. The sultan's grave, with a suitably royal ''[[bixi (tortoise)|bixi]]'' stone tortoise monument, was discovered in Yuhuatai District south of the city in 1958.<ref>Rozan Yunos, [http://www.bt.com.bn/en/life/2008/11/09/the_brunei_sultan_who_died_in_china "The Brunei Sultan who died in China"] The Brunei Times, 9.11.2008</ref>

===Qing period===
Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to the [[Li Zicheng]]'s rebels and then to [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] invaders, and the suicide of the last "real" Ming emperor [[Zhu Youjian]] (the Chongzhen Emperor) in the spring 1644, the Ming prince [[Zhu Yousong, Prince of Fu|Zhu Yousong]] was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor. His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called [[Southern Ming Dynasty]].

Zhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Manchu troops, when the Manchu army, led by Prince [[Dodo, Prince Yu|Dodo]] approached [[Jiangnan]] the next spring.<ref>Struve (1993), p.55-56</ref> Days after [[Yangzhou]] fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial palace was looted by local residents.<ref>Struve (1993), pp. 60-61</ref> On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them.<ref>Struve (1993), pp. 62-63</ref> The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the [[Queue (hairstyle)|Manchu way]], requisitioned a large section of the city for the [[Eight Banners|bannermen]]'s cantonment, and destroyed the former imperial palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that [[Yangzhou massacre|befell Yangzhou]].<ref>Struve (1993), pp. 64-65, 72</ref>

During the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644<U+2013>1911), the Nanjing area was known as Jiangning (<U+6C5F><U+5B81>) and served as the seat of government for the [[Liangjiang Viceroy]]. It had been visited by the [[Kangxi]] and [[Qianlong Emperor]]s a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces.

Nanjing was invaded by British troops during the [[First Opium War]], which was ended by the [[Treaty of Nanking]] in 1842.

Nanjing was the capital of the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping Kingdom]]<ref>[http://dangeroustravel.blogspot.com/2008/05/taiping-rebellion.html Eduardo Real: <U+2018><U+2019>The Taiping Rebellion<U+2019><U+2019><!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the mid-19th century, being renamed as Tianjing (<U+5929><U+4EAC>) (lit. ''Heaven's Capital'').

Both the Qing Viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the [[Presidential Building (Nanjing)|Presidential Palace]]. As Qing general [[Zeng Guofan]] retook the city in 1864, massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 committing suicide or fighting to the death.

===Capital of the Republic===
[[File:National Government of the R.O.C.jpg|thumb|The National Government of the Republic of China in Nanjing, 1927]]
[[File:Nj06.jpg|thumb|In the harsh 1937-1938 winter, the Japanese Army occupied Nanjing and [[Nanjing Massacre|murdered tens of thousands of Chinese people]]. According to the [[Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal]], 300,000 victims died.]]
The [[Xinhai Revolution]] led to the founding of the [[Republic of China]] in January 1912 with [[Dr. Sun Yat-sen]] as the first provisional president, and Nanjing was selected as its new capital. However, the [[Qing Dynasty]] still controlled the northern provinces, so revolutionaries asked [[Yuan Shikai]] to replace Sun as president in exchange for the emperor's abdication. Yuan demanded the capital be at Beijing (closer to his power base).

In 1927, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) under Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the [[Nanjing decade]], as they used the [[Presidential Building (Nanjing)|Presidential Palace]] in Nanjing as their headquarters.

In 1937, Japan started the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Their troops occupied Nanjing in December, and carried out the systematic and brutal [[Nanking massacre]]. The total death toll could not be confirmed, since no official records were kept. Though often contested, most estimates, including those made by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] and the [[Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal]], put the number of dead between 200,000 and 350,000.<ref>In a document sent by former Japanese foreign minister [[Hirota Koki]] to the Japanese Embassy in Washington on January 17, 1938, he stated "based upon investigation, over 300,000,000,000 Chinese killed". (ref. National Archives, Washington, D.C., Released in Sept. 1994) The verdict of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East reads in part:
"Approximately 20,000 cases occurred within the city during the first month of the occupation ... The total number of civilians and prisoners of war murdered in Nanking during the six weeks was over 200,000. ... These figures do not take into account those persons whose bodies were destroyed by burning or by throwing into the Yangtze River or otherwise disposed by Japanese."
The 200,000 number was mostly based on the records of several humanitarian and charity organizations who buried the remaining bodies a week to four months after the massacres began. Six charity groups buried total of 195,240 bodies from 1937.12--1938.10. Detailed bury records are available.
From the verdict, the 200,000 number did not include victims whose bodies were disposed by Japanese (as common in the early stages of the massacre) or by individuals Chinese other than the charities groups, nor did it include those who were massacred after the first six weeks. Therefore, the 200,000 number is the most conservative number. Adding the people murdered in smaller scale killings and whose bodies had been buried by other people, over 300,000 Chinese were massacred in Nanking.</ref> The [[Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall]] was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.

A few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city [[Chongqing]] and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940<U+FF0C>a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the "[[Wang Jingwei Government|Nanjing Regime]]" or "Nanjing Nationalist Government" led by [[Wang Jingwei]] was established in Nanjing as a rival to [[Chiang Kai-Shek]]'s government in [[Chongqing]]. In 1946, after the [[Surrender of Japan]], the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.

===People's Republic===
[[File:Nanjing yangtze bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], built in 1968.]]

On April 23, 1949, The [[People's Liberation Army]] conquered Nanjing. After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]], Nanjing was initially a province-level municipality, but very soon became, and today remains, the provincial capital of Jiangsu.

The Ministry of Interior of the Republic of China, as well as textbooks published in Taiwan, refer to Nanjing as the official capital of the Republic of China, while [[Taipei]] is just its provisional capital.<ref name="capital-nanking">{{cite web|url=http://dict.revised.moe.edu.tw/cgi-bin/newDict/dict.sh?cond=%ABn%A8%CA%A5%AB&pieceLen=50&fld=1&cat=&serial=1&recNo=0&op=&imgFont=1|title= <U+5357><U+4EAC><U+5E02>|publisher=Ministry of Education, ROC|work= <U+91CD><U+7DE8><U+56EF><U+8A9E><U+8FAD><U+5178><U+4FEE><U+8A02><U+672C>|quote=<U+6C11><U+570B><U+5341><U+516D><U+5E74><U+FF0C><U+570B><U+6C11><U+653F><U+5E9C><U+5BA3><U+8A00><U+5B9A><U+70BA><U+9996><U+90FD><U+FF0C><U+4ECA><U+4EE5><U+81FA><U+5317><U+5E02><U+70BA><U+6211><U+570B><U+4E2D><U+592E><U+653F><U+5E9C><U+6240><U+5728><U+5730><U+3002>(In the 16th Year of the Republic of China, the National Government established [[Nanking]] as the capital.

Nanjing, with a total land area of {{km2 to sq mi|6598}}, is situated in one of the largest economic zones of China, the Yangtze River Delta, which is part of the downstream [[Yangtze River]] [[drainage basin]]. The Yangtze River flows past the west side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south side of the city. The city is {{km to mi|300}} west-northwest of [[Shanghai]], {{km to mi|1200}} south-southeast of [[Beijing]], and {{km to mi|1400}} east-northeast of [[Chongqing]].

Nanjing borders [[Yangzhou]] to the northeast, one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze, [[Zhenjiang]] to the east, one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze, and [[Changzhou]] to the southeast. On the west is [[Anhui|Anhui Province]], where Nanjing borders 5 prefecture-level cities. 

Nanjing has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Koppen climate classification|Koppen]] ''Cfa'') and is under the influence of the [[East Asia]] [[Monsoon]]. The four seasons are distinct here, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold winters, and brief spring and autumn in between. Alongside Wuhan and Chongqing, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the "Three Furnacelike Cities" along the Yangtze River (<U+957F><U+6C5F><U+6D41><U+57DF><U+4E09><U+5927><U+706B><U+7089>) for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime.<ref>{{Cite web

Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around {{convert|16|<U+00B0>C}}, with monthly mean values ranging from {{convert|2.4|to|27.8|C|F|1}}. <!-- not arithmetic mean. see source --> The highest recorded temperature is {{convert|40.7|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}} (Aug 22, 1959), and the lowest {{convert|-14.0|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}} (Jan 6, 1955). On average precipitation falls 115 days out of the year, and the average annual rainfall is {{convert|1062|mm|in|1}}. 

Nanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, [[iron]] and [[sulfur]] reserves make up 40 percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of [[strontium]] rank first in East Asia and the [[South East Asia]] region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in [[Jiangning]] and Tangquan Hot Spring in [[Pukou]].

Nanjing is the intersection of Yangtze River<U+2014>an east-west water transport artery and Nanjing-Beijing railway<U+2014>a south-north land transport artery, hence the name <U+201C>door of the east and west, throat of the south and north<U+201D>. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain is curling in the east of the city; the tiger-like Stone Mountain is crouching in the west of the city, hence the name <U+201C>the Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching<U+201D>. Mr. Sun Yet-sen spoke highly of Nanjing in the <U+201C>Constructive Scheme for Our Country<U+201D>, <U+201C>The position of Nanjing is wonderful since mountains, lakes and plains all integrated in it. It is hardly [''sic''] to find another city like this.<U+201D>

Surrounded by the Yangtze River and mountains, Nanjing also enjoys beautiful natural scenery. Natural lakes such as [[Xuanwu Lake]] and [[Mochou Lake]] are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while hills like [[Purple Mountain]] are covered with evergreens and oaks and host various historical and cultural sites. [[Sun Quan]] relocated his capital to Nanjing after [[Liu Bei]]'s suggestion as Liu Bei was impressed by Nanjing's impeccable geographic position when negotiating an alliance with Sun Quan. Sun Quan then renamed the city from Moling (<U+79E3><U+9675>) to Jianye (<U+5EFA><U+90BA>) shortly thereafter.<ref>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', vols.

==Government==
[[File:Nj08.jpg|thumb|200px|Nanjing Municipal Hall]]
The full name of the government of Nanjing is "People's Government of Nanjing City". The city is under the one-party rule of the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]], with the [[CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary]] as the ''de facto'' governor of the city and the mayor as the executive head of the government working under the secretary.

Nanjing currently consists of thirteen [[Political divisions of China#County level|county-level divisions]], of which eleven are [[district of China|districts]], and two are [[county of China|counties]]. The districts are the urban areas of Nanjing while the counties are the rural areas governed by the city.

===Administrative divisions===
The sub-provincial city of Nanjing has direct jurisdiction over 11 [[District of China|districts]] (<U+533A> ''qu'') and 2 [[County (China)|Counties]] (<U+53BF> ''xian''):

According to the ''Fifth China [[Census]]'', the total population of the City of Nanjing reached 6.24 million in 2000. The statistics in 2008 estimated the total population to be 7.7 million, while the registered population was 6.3 million. The [[birth rate]] was 8.86 percent and the [[death rate]] was 6.88 percent. The urban area had a population of 5.5 million people.

As in most of eastern China the ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly [[Han nationality]] (98.56 percent), with 50 other [[nationalities of China|minority nationalities]]. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to minority nationalities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were [[Hui Chinese|Hui nationalities]], contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were [[Manchu]] (2,311) and [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] (533) nationalities. Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population.

In 2003 the [[sex ratio]] of the city population was 106.49 males to 100 females.

==Economy==
===Earlier development===
Since the Three Kingdoms period, Nanjing has become an industrial center for textile and mint owing to its strategic geographical location and convenient transportation. During the Ming Dynasty Nanjing's industry was further expanded, and the city became one of the most prosperous cities in China and even the world. It led in textile, mint, printing, shipbuilding and many other industries, and was the busiest business center in the [[Far East]].

Into the first half of the twentieth century, Nanjing gradually shifted from a production hub into a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of the wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge [[department stores]] such as [[Zhongyang Shangchang]] sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the [[service industry]], while prostitution, drugs and gambling also thrived.

In the 1950s, the CPC invested heavily in Nanjing to build a series of state-owned [[heavy industry|heavy industries]], as part of the national plan of rapid [[industrialization]]. Electrical, mechanical, chemical and steel factories were established successively, converting Nanjing into a heavy industry production center of East China. Overenthusiastic in building a <U+201C>world-class<U+201D> industrial city, leaders of Nanjing also made many disastrous mistakes during the development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in the negative economic growth in the late 1960s.

===Today===
[[File:Nanjingskyline200997.jpg|right|thumb|Nanjing downtown]]
The current industry of the city basically inherited the characteristics of the [[1960s]], with electronics, [[automobile|cars]], petrochemical, iron and steel, and power as the "Five Pillar Industries". Some representative big state-owned firms are [[Panda Electronics]], [[Jincheng Motors]] and [[Nanjing Steel]]. The [[tertiary industry]] also regained prominence, accounting for 44 percent of the GDP of the city. The city is also vying for foreign investment against neighboring cities in the Yangtze River Delta, and so far a number of famous [[multinational corporation|multinational firms]], such as [[Volkswagen Group]], [[Iveco]], [[A.O. Smith]], and [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], have established their lines there. Since China's entry into the [[WTO]], Nanjing has received increasing attention from foreign investors, and on average, two new foreign firms establish offices in the city every day.

The city government is further improving the desirability of the city to investors by building large [[industrial park]]s, which now total four: Gaoxin, Xingang, Huagong and Jiangning. Despite the effort, Nanjing's Gross Domestic Product is still falling behind that of other neighbouring cities such as [[Suzhou]], [[Wuxi]] and [[Hangzhou]], which have an edge in attracting foreign investment and local innovation. In addition, the traditional [[state-owned enterprises]] find themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms, and hence are either mired in heavy debt or forced into [[bankruptcy]] or [[privatization]]. This has resulted in large numbers of [[layoff|layoff workers]] who are technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.
[[File:Xinjiekou.jpg|right|thumb|Xinjiekou commercial area]]

In recent years, Nanjing has been developing its economy, commerce, industry, as well as city construction. In 2009 the city's [[GDP]] was RMB 423 billion (3rd in Jiangsu), and GDP per capita was RMB 55,290, a 9.5 percent increase from 2008. The average urban resident's [[disposable income]] was RMB 25,504, while the average rural resident's net income was RMB 9,858. The registered urban [[unemployment rate]] was 3.02 percent, lower than the national average (4.3 percent). Nanjing's Gross Domestic Product ranked 17th in 2008 in China, and its overall competence ranked 9th.

==Transportation==
Nanjing is the transportation hub in eastern China and the downstream Yangtze River area. Different means of transportation constitute a three-dimensional transport system that includes land, water and air. As in most other Chinese cities, [[public transportation]] is the dominant mode of travel of the majority of the citizens.  The city now has [[Yangtze River bridges and bunnels|four bridge or tunnel crossings spanning the Yangtze]], which are tying districts north of the river with the city center on the south bank. See also [[:Category:Transport in Nanjing|Transport in Nanjing]].

===Rail===
[[File:Nanjing railway station night view.jpg|thumb|300px|Nanjing Railway Station]]
Nanjing is an important railway hub in eastern China. It serves as rail junction for the [[Jinghu Railway|Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu)]] (which is itself composed of the old [[Jinpu Railway|Jinpu]] and Ninghu Railways, Nanjing-Wuhu (Ningwu), [[Ningqi Railway|Nanjing-Qidong (Ningqi)]], Nanjing-Xian (Ningxi), Hefei-Nanjing (Hening) Railways. Passenger rail service in Nanjing is provided mainly by [[Nanjing Railway Station]], while both [[Nanjing West Railway Station]] and [[Nanjing South Railway Station]] serve minor roles. Since 2008, A new [[Nanjing South Railway Station]] has started construction. This will officially be claimed the largest railway station in Asia after it is finished.

===Road===
As an important regional hub in the [[Yangtze River Delta]], Nanjing is well-connected by over 60 state and provincial [[highway]]s to all parts of China.

Express highways such as Hu-Ning, Ning-He, Ning-Hang enable commuters to travel to [[Shanghai]], [[Hefei]], [[Hangzhou]], and other important cities quickly and conveniently. Inside the city of Nanjing, there are {{km to mi|230}} of highways, with a highway coverage density of 3.38&nbsp;kilometers per hundred square&nbsp;kilometers (2.10&nbsp;mi/38.6&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). The total road coverage density of the city is 112.56&nbsp;kilometers per hundred square&nbsp;kilometers (69.94&nbsp;mi/38.6&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).

[[Nanjing Sample Technology Company Limited]] is a major provider of [[Intelligent traffic system]]s.

'''National Highway''':
* [[China National Highway 312]]

====Public Transportation====
[[File:XINJIEKOU Station-Line 2.jpg|thumb|Xinjiekou Station of Line 2, [[Nanjing Metro]]]]
The city also boasts an efficient network of public transportation, which mainly consists of bus, taxi and metro systems. The bus network, which is currently run by five companies ([[Nanjing Gongjiao]], [[Zhongbei]], [[Argos]], [[Xincheng]] and [[Xinningpu]]), provides more than 370 routes covering all parts of the city and suburban areas. [[Nanjing Metro]] Line 1, started service on May 15, 2005. Line 2 and the extension of Line 1 officially opened to passenger service on May 28, 2010. The city is planning to complete a 655-kilometer (409&nbsp;mi)-long Metro and [[light-rail]] system by 2050.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The expansion of the Metro network will greatly facilitate the intracity transportation and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion.

===Air===
Nanjing's airport, [[Lukou International Airport]], serves both national and international flights. In 2008, the airport handled 8.8813 million passengers. It was ranked 13th among 126 civil airports in China in terms of yearly passenger transport, and 10th for yearly cargo transport. The airport currently has 85 routes to national and international destinations, which include [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Germany]]. The airport is connected by a 29-kilometer (18&nbsp;mi) highway directly to the city center, and is also linked to various intercity highways, making it accessible to the passengers from the surrounding cities.

===Water===
[[Port of Nanjing]] is the largest inland port in China, yearly [[throughput]] reaching 108.59 million [[ton]]s<!--long tons??--> in 2007. The port area is {{km to mi|98}} in length and has 64 berths including 16 berths for ships with a tonnage of more than 10,000. Nanjing is also the biggest container port along the Yangtze River; in March 2004, the one million container-capacity base, Longtan Containers Port Area opened, further consolidating Nanjing as the leading port in the region. In the 1960s the first Yangtze river bridge was completed, becoming almost the only solid connection between North and South in eastern China at that time. The bridge became a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 metres on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580 metres spanning the river itself.

==Culture and art==
[[File:Nanjing library new1.jpg|thumb|[[Nanjing Library]]]]
Being one of the four ancient capitals of China, Nanjing has always been a cultural center attracting intellectuals from all over the country. In the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties, the city was the official [[imperial examination]] center for the [[Jiangnan]] region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.

Today, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a <U+201C>city of culture<U+201D> and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.

===Art===
{{Main|List of Nanjing Art Groups}}

Some of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include: [[Qianxian Dance Company]], [[Nanjing Dance Company]], [[Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute]], [[Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company]] are just a few to list.

[[Jiangsu Province Kun Opera]] is one of the best theatres for Kunqu, China's oldest stage art. It is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theatre, and puppet theatre.

[[Jiangsu Art Gallery]] is the largest gallery in Jiangsu Province, presenting some of the best traditional and contemporary art pieces of China; many other smaller-scale galleries, such as [[Red Chamber Art Garden]] and [[Jinling Stone Gallery]], also have their own special exhibitions.

===Festivals===
{{Main|List of Festivals and Events of Nanjing}}
Many traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times, which included climbing the City Wall on January 16, bathing in [[Qing Xi of Nanjing|Qing Xi]] on March 3, hill hiking on September 9 and others (the dates are in [[Chinese lunar calendar]]). Almost none of them, however, are still celebrated by modern Nanjingese.

Instead, Nanjing, as a popular tourist destination, hosts a series of government-organised events throughout the year. The annual [[International Plum Blossom Festival]] held in [[Plum Hill]], the largest plum collection in China, attracts thousands of tourists both domestically and internationally. Other events include Nanjing Baima Peach Blossom and Kite Festival, Jiangxin Zhou Fruit Festival and Linggu Temple Sweet Osmanthus Festival.

===Libraries===
[[Nanjing Library]], founded in 1907, houses more than 7 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the [[National Library of China|National Library]] in Beijing and [[Shanghai Library]]. Other libraries, such as city-owned [[Jinling Library]] and various district libraries, also provide considerable amount of information to citizens. [[Nanjing University Library]], owned by [[Nanjing University]], with a collection of 4.2 million volumes, is also one of the leading university libraries . More than 100 multimedia networked-computers are available to readers.

===Museums===
[[File:Nanjing Museum big.jpg.JPG|thumb|[[Nanjing Museum]]]]
{{Main|List of museums in Nanjing}}
Nanjing has some of the oldest and finest museums in China. [[Nanjing Museum]], formerly known as National Central Museum under KMT rule, is the first modern museum and remains as one of the leading museums in China. Other museums include the China Modern History Museum in the [[Presidential Building (Nanjing)|Presidential Palace]], the [[Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall]], the [[City Museum of Nanjing]], the [[Taiping Kingdom History Museum]], the [[Nanjing Customs Museum]], the [[Nanjing City Wall Cultural Museum]], and a small museum and tomb honoring the 15th century seafaring admiral [[Zheng He]].

Most of Nanjing's major theatres are multi-purpose, used as convention halls, cinemas, musical halls and theatres on different occasions. The major theatres include the [[Nanjing People's Convention Hall|People's Convention Hall]] and the [[Nanjing Arts and Culture Center]].

A new cinema, [[Nanjing Shangying-Warner Cinema Complex]], was opened in 2004, as the first modern cinema complex in Nanjing. It has become a must-visit for movie enthusiasts. After that, Nanjing had more modern cinemas in both Xinjiekou and the Confucius Temple, such as the Xinjiekou International Cinema Complex located on the seventh floor of Deji Plaza and Hengdian International Cinema in Aqua City on Jiankang Road.

===Night life===
[[File:Fuzimiaonight.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Qinhuai River]]
[[File:Pubs in Nanjing 1912 block.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pubs in Nanjing 1912 block]]
Traditionally Nanjing's nightlife was mostly centered around [[Confucius Temple]] area along the [[Qinhuai River]], where night markets, restaurants and pubs thrived. Boating at night in the river was a main attraction of the city. The area was also famous for the concentration of upper-class prostitutes, many of them patronized by wealthy students of the medieval predecessor of the [[Nanjing University]] established in the neighborhood of the temple by emperor Yong'an in 258 CE. Thus, one can see the statues of the famous teachers and educators of the past not too far from those of the courtesans who educated the young men in the other arts.  Prostitution is currently not prominent in the area, having been banned under PRC laws.

In the past 20 years, several commercial streets have been developed, hence the nightlife has become more diverse: there are<!--I've seen them. None could be called "mega".--> shopping malls opening late in the [[Xinjiekou]] [[Central business district|CBD]] and [[Hunan Road Commercial Street|Hunan Road]]. The well-established "[[Nanjing 1912]]" district hosts a wide variety of pastime facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs. There are two major areas where bars are densely located; one is in [[1912]] block; the other is along Shanghai road and its neighborhood. Both are popular with international residents of the city.

These days, the most comprehensive source of nightlife information (in English) can be found on [http://www.hellonanjing.net HelloNanjing.net]

Local people still very much enjoy street food, such as [[Kababu]].<!-- what is this Kababu ? there are no hits on google for this mysterious food. Maybe Kebab? --> As elsewhere in Asia, [[Karaoke]] is popular with both young and old crowd.
