'''AL-34662''' is an [[indazole]] derivative drug which is being developed for the treatment of [[glaucoma]]. It acts as a selective [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[agonist]], the same target as that of hallucinogenic drugs like [[psilocin]], but unlike these drugs, AL-34662 was designed specifically as a peripherally selective drug, which does not cross the [[blood-brain barrier]]. This means that AL-34662 can exploit a useful side effect of the hallucinogenic 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonists, namely reduction in [[intra-ocular pressure]] and hence relief from the symptoms of glaucoma, but without causing the hallucinogenic effects which make centrally active 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonists unsuitable for clinical use.<ref>Sharif NA, Kelly CR, Crider JY, Davis TL.

PMID 17238805</ref> In animal studies, AL-34662 has been shown to be potent and effective in the treatment of symptoms of glaucoma, with minimal side effects.<ref>Sharif NA, McLaughlin MA, Kelly CR.

Peripherally acting 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonists have been a rich field of research in recent years, with potential glaucoma treatments being the main proposed application for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonists at present, as centrally acting agonists for this receptor tend to be hallucinogenic and thus have little medical use. While many novel, potent and selective 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonists have been developed for this application,<ref>May JA, Chen HH, Rusinko A, Lynch VM, Sharif NA, McLaughlin MA.
