==Background==
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 12 July 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  First held in 1829, the race takes place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 12 July 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref>  The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and, as of 2014, broadcast worldwide.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|title=Former Winnipegger in winning Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race crew|date=6 April 2014|publisher=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/former-winnipegger-in-winning-oxford-cambridge-boat-race-crew-1.2600176|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/tv-and-radio | title = TV and radio | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate = 12 July 2014}}</ref>  Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1956|1956 race]] by one-and-a-quarter lengths, and led overall with 56 victories to Oxford's 45 (excluding the [[The Boat Race 1877|"dead heat" of 1877]]).<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher =The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 12 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url= http://theboatraces.org/classic-moments-the-1877-dead-heat | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Classic moments <U+2013> the 1877 dead heat | accessdate = 12 July 2014}}</ref>

Cambridge's coaches were [[James Crowden]] (who had rowed for the Light Blues in the [[The Boat Race 1951|1951]] and [[The Boat Race 1952|1952 races]]), D. K. Hill (who had rowed for Cambridge in 1953 and 1954), Derek Mays-Smith (who had represented Cambridge in the [[The Boat Race 1955|1955]] and [[The Boat Race 1956|1956 races]] and James Owen.  Oxford were coached by J. H. Page, L. A. F. Stokes (a Dark Blue in 1951 and 1952) and R. A. Wheadon (who had rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1954|1954 race]]).<ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>  The race was umpired by [[Gerald Ellison]], the [[Bishop of Chester]], who had rowed for Oxford in the [[The Boat Race 1932|1932]] and [[The Boat Race 1933|1933 races]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 74</ref>

According to the rowing correspondant of ''The Times'', "never in the past 10 years has there been such unanimity in Boat Race forecasts as this year, when only the staunchest Cambridge supporters could see more than an outside chance of a light blue victory".<ref name=astonishing>{{Cite news | title = Astonishing reversal of Boat Race fortune | work = [[The Times]] | date = 1 April 1957 | page = 3 | issue = 53804}}</ref>  He described the Oxford crew as "exceptionally strong and mechanically quite efficient" yet "lacks polish and uniformity" and while Cambridge were were demonstrated uniformity, they rowed in a way which "does look like hard work".<ref name=form>{{Cite news | title = Oxford's form points to Boat Race victory | work = [[The Times]] | date = 30 March 1957 | page = 7 | issue = 53803}}</ref>  In the build-up to the race, Oxford's time in their second full course row was 45 seconds quicker than that rowed by Cambridge the previous day.<ref name=form/>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 13&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 3&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (83.7&nbsp;kg), {{convert|5.75|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents,<ref name=burn78>Burnell, p. 78</ref> making them the heaviest crew on record.<ref name=form/> Cambridge's crew featured a single rower with Boat Race experience: their number six and boat club president Michael Delahooke had rowed in the previous year's race.  Oxford saw four rowers return who had previously participated in the event.<ref name=burn78/>  Two members of each crew were registered as non-British: Oxford's [[Roderick Carnegie]] was Australian while their [[Coxswain (rowing)|cox]] A. Said was from Pakistan.  Cambridge's crew included two Americans in J. R. Meadows and their cox R. C. Milton.<ref>Burnell, p. 39</ref>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Oxford won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey side of the river to Cambridge.<ref name=astonishing/>  Both crews rowed 38 strokes in the first minute, with the Light Blues holding a canvas-length lead.  While Oxford dropped their [[stroke rate]] to 32 strokes per minute, Cambridge continued at pace, rating 35 strokes per minute in an attempt to extend their early lead through to [[Beverley Brook]].  Oxford's longer stroke saw them pass Cambridge to pass the Mile Post around a length ahead.  At the Crab Tree pub, Cambridge pushed on while the Dark Blues maintained their rhythm, with the rowing correspondant for ''The Times'' suggesting this was "Oxford's tactical error".<ref name=astonishing/>  

The Dark Blues' lead was down to half a length by the time the crews passed [[Harrods Furniture Depository]] and by [[Hammersmith Bridge]] Cambridge had edged ahead.  Still out-rating Oxford, the Light Blues gradually pulled away and were a length and a half ahead by Chiswick Steps.  With no response from Oxford, Cambridge extended their advantage further to around two lengths by [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]], a lead which they held at the finishing post in a time of 19 minutes 1 second.<ref name=astonishing/>  They secured their third consecutive victory and their ninth win in eleven years and taking the overall record in the race to 57&ndash;45 in their favour.<ref name=results/>  At the post-race dinner, held at the [[Royal Automobile Club]] in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], the Oxford boat club president Carnegie defended his crew's style: "The style was all right but we did not match up to it".<ref name=explains>{{Cite news | title = Oxford explains | work = [[The Observer]] | date = 31 March 1957 | page = 1}}</ref>  His counterpart Delahooke suggested that had the race been held ten days prior, Oxford would have won.<ref name=explains/>
