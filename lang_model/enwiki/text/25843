'''''Final Straw''''' is the third album by [[Snow Patrol]], released in the [[United Kingdom]]  and the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 2003 and in the [[United States]] in 2004. The album is notable for bringing the band their first mainstream success outside of their native countries of [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The album was re-released in the UK in 2004 with two extra tracks,<ref>http://www.snowpatrol.com/discography/default.aspx?pid=3</ref> before being exported to the [[United States|U.S.]] (without the bonus tracks). The album was also released on [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] and [[DualDisc]] with 5.1 Surround mixes.<ref>http://www.snowpatrol.com/discography/default.aspx?&in=8</ref>

==Background==
The band's A&R Jim Chancellor explained the reasons for choosing rock producer Jacknife Lee to oversee the record by saying, "I wanted a record for them that was bigger and bolder and a lot different than their previous records. I wanted them to make a more of a rock album than an indie record."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JimChanc.html |title=Interview With Jim Chancellor |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=Oct 26, 2005 |accessdate=Jun 29, 2010}}</ref> Chancellor, Lee and the band chose fifteen songs to start working on out of an original pool of 24.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Critical to the new direction was Lightbody's development into a more rounded songwriter. "They played us some songs which were not indie. There were a couple of pop songs and then <U+201C>Run<U+201D>, which is an enormous emotional rollercoaster of a track," said Chancellor.

==Recording and composition==
During the first couple of weeks in the studio the band found it quite difficult to adapt from an 'indie'-orientated sound to a more commercially viable pop rock sound.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Producer Lee offered constructive suggestions about how to both simplify their songs and augment them with other sounds such as strings, and Snow Patrol proved very receptive his advice.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> According to Chancellor, "Some bands tend to be more defensive about what goes on in the studio. Snow Patrol weren<U+2019>t. They were very much like, <U+201C>Yeah, we really want to be successful this time.<U+201D><ref name="hitquarters.com"/>  

Guitarist [[Nathan Connolly]] joined the band during the recording sessions. He did not contribute much, as the whole album had already been demoed. He commented that he found it easy to start writing and sharing his ideas with the rest of the band, as he had a good relationship with the band before being a member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.muzika.hr%2Fclanak%2F22192%2Finterview%2Fnathan-connolly-snow-patrol-s-vremenom-postajemo-veci-bend-i-nemamo-straha-izaci-na-jednu-od-najvecih-pozornica-ikada.aspx&date=1 October 2009|title=Interview - Nathan Connolly (Snow Patrol)|last=Jurilj|first=Igor|date=4 August 2009|publisher=''Muzika''|language=Croatian|accessdate=1 October 2009}} Note: Translation can be found [http://garylightbody.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/muzika-hr-interview/ here].</ref> The album's music incorporates [[Distortion (music)|distorted guitar]], [[Audio feedback|feedback]] styles, and the vocals are gritty. The lyrics deal with the themes of relationships and politics. The band's sound on the album was described as being a "cross between the sullen [[Folk music|folk]] of [[Nick Drake]] and the more punchy [[Rock music|rock]] moments of [[Simple Minds]] and the [[Pixies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-13235006_ITM|title=Scotland's Snow Patrol jumps on gloom bandwagon|last=Weingarten|first=Abby|date=3 September 2004|work=[[AccessMyLibrary]]|publisher=''[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]''|accessdate=2009-10-19}} '''Appears as''': "Using distorted guitar, feedback and gritty vocals, the band inserts lyrics with political and relationship themes." and "{{sic|hide=y|comprised |of}} Gary Lightbody (songwriting, vocals, guitar and keyboards), Nathan Connolly (guitar), Mark McClelland (bass and keyboards) and Johnny Quinn (drums), Snow Patrol has a sound that's a cross between the sullen folk of Nick Drake and the more punchy rock moments of Simple Minds and the Pixies."</ref> Lightbody has said that him "finally learn[ing] to write a chorus" was the key to the album's success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kvhEAV7s|title=Snow Patrol: 'We're not ready for greatest hits'|last=Heawood|first=Sophie|date=30 October 2009|publisher=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-31}}</ref>

The lyrics, all written by Lightbody are about failing relationships and break-ups. They were inspired by his personal experiences. Quinn, his longtime friend, says that he knows who Lightbody sings about in those songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kskyWtQq|title=That's Snow business|date=25 July 2004|publisher=''[[The Age]]''|accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref>

A limited 20,000 copies of the album were pressed and released, all eventually selling by word of mouth.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The album was later re-issued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kCwW5mc1|title=The flaky success of Snow Patrol|last=Jelbert|first=Steve|date=13 February 2004|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd.|accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref>
