'''Youngblood''' is a [[superhero]] team, and eponymous [[comic book]], created by [[Rob Liefeld]]. The team made its debut as a backup feature in the 1987 one-shot "Megaton: Explosion". Its first "official" appearance was in 1992 as the flagship publication for [[Image Comics]]. Frequently criticized for the quality of its art and writing, its frequent lateness, and its graphic violence and foul language [http://img114.exs.cx/img114/2947/bloodsport24up.jpg], ''Youngblood'' has often been portrayed as an example of everything that went wrong with the comic book industry in the [[1990]]s.

The members of Youngblood include '''[[Shaft (youngblood)|Shaft]]''', an [[Archery|archer]] whose bow uses magnets to propel its arrow instead of a string; '''[[Badrock]]''' a teenager transformed into a living block of stone (originally named "Bedrock" until Liefeld thought there could possibly be a legal threat from [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] [[The Flintstones|The Flinstones]] especially with The Flinstones movie that came out around that time.); '''Vogue''', a Russian fashion model with purple-and-chalk-white skin; and '''Chapel''', a government assassin.

== Origins of the series ==
In interviews, Liefeld has explained that ''Youngblood'' was partially based on a 1991 plan of his for a new ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' series for [[DC Comics]], possibly titled "Team Titans," to be co-written with [[Marv Wolfman]]. Liefeld and managing editor [[Dick Giordano]] "couldn't make the numbers work," however, and Liefeld merged his Titans ideas into a new [[creator ownership|creator-owned]] project, ''Youngblood'', to be published by the newly-founded Image Comics. According to Liefeld, "Shaft was intended to be [[Speedy]]. Vogue was a new [[Harlequin (comics)|Harlequin]] design, Combat was a Kh'undian warrior circa the [[Legion of Super Heroes]], ditto for Photon and Die Hard was a [[S.T.A.R. Labs|Star Labs]] android. I forgot who Chapel was supposed to be." [http://goodcomics.blogspot.com/2005/06/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-2.html] 
Another inspirational source for ''Youngblood'', Liefeld claims, is the theory that if superheroes really did exist, they would be treated much the same way as movie stars and athletes. Throughout the series there are numerous references to endorsement deals, TV show appearances, agents, managers and the perceived pressures of celebrity life.

== Image Comics debut ==
With his opportunity with DC to do ''Team Titans'' looking bleak, and a growing strained relationship with [[Marvel comics]] over his ''[[X-Force]]'' royalties, Rob Liefeld decided to band together with other unhappy Marvel artists to form an independent comics company. The company formed was called [[Image Comics]], and the first comic Image debuted was ''Youngblood'' #1. At the time of its release, Youngblood #1 was the highest selling independent comic book ever. However, ''Youngblood'' #1 also received very poor reviews from critics, which led to Liefeld firing his co-writer from the book. Throughout its run at Image, Youngblood was criticized for poor writing and inconsistent art, but mostly for its lateness. Near the mid [[1990s]], Liefeld had a falling out with his Image partners, forcing him to leave the company and take ''Youngblood'' with him.

== Alan Moore age ==
In [[1998]], Liefeld hired [[Alan Moore]] to write new issues of ''Youngblood''; however, despite Moore's well-publicized plans for at least 12 issues, only two issues were ever printed and the third issue was published in another book called ''Awesome Adventures''. The team also appeared in a short story in the ''Awesome Christmas Special'' where Shaft's journal provides the narration as the new team comes together.

He created a new Youngblood group that was financed by the millionaire Waxey Doyle, formerly the WWII superhero Waxman introduced in Moore's run on ''Supreme''. The team was formed by Shaft and the new members Big Brother (Leonard, Waxey's adopted son that controlled a series of robots), Doc Rocket (a speedster that is the granddaughter of a golden age superhero of same name), Twilight (a female and gothic version of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]), Suprema ([[Supreme (comics)|Supreme]]'s adopted sister) and Johnny Panic (in Moore's words "the first postmodern superhero"; his powers come from a suit that can create holograms). The team's headquarters at this time was Waxey's mansion, the House of Wax.

Most of the villains featured in this series were Moore's creations, like Stormhead (a villain whose mood influences the weather around him), most members of the Badblood (a team created by former Team Youngblood leader Sentinel) and Jack-A-Dandy (a strange criminal that looks and acts like a Victorian dandy, modeled after [[The Joker]]).

Moore's rough outline for the series was published in ''Alan Moore's Awesome Handbook,'' and included a budding relationship between Big Brother and Suprema, a giant planet-devouring entity called "The Goat", and the revelation that Johnny Panic was the biological son of Supreme villain Darius Dax.

== Controversy ==
In [[1993]], Liefeld solicited Youngblood stories from [[Kurt Busiek]], who wrote detailed plots for three issues and ideas for a fourth, for ''Youngblood: Year One''. This was never produced; however, in [[2004]], Liefeld began soliciting orders for ''Youngblood: Genesis'', using Kurt Busiek's unused "Year One" plots. Busiek asked Liefeld to be only credited with plots on this new series. He was only listed as plotter on the comic book itself, but when Liefeld mentioned the comic as written by Kurt Busiek and scripted by Brandon Thomas on an online comic book forum, Busiek became furious and claimed that Liefeld didn't stick to their agreement. Liefeld replied as only using his name as a writer of the plots on the forum and nothing more. Busiek still asked that his fans not buy the series. It officially ended after two issues as the third and fourth issues would have used Image Comics characters that Liefeld didn't have the copyrights to.

==Present==

In March [[2004]], Liefeld hired [[Mark Millar]] to write new issues of ''Youngblood: Bloodsport''; [[As of 2004|as of December 2004]], only one issue has been printed.

In 2004, [[Robert Kirkman]] began writing a new series, ''Youngblood: Imperial'', but left after one issue due to his busy schedule. [[Fabian Nicieza]] was slated to take over, but so far issues #2-3 have yet to appear, despite solicitations.

In 2005, Liefeld announced that [[Joe Casey]] would be re-assembling and re-scripting the original ''Youngblood'' miniseries into a more coherent and sophisticated story, to be titled ''Maximum Youngblood''.
