'''Michel Eyquem de Montaigne''' ({{IPA-fr|mi<U+0283><U+025B>l ek<U+025B>m d<U+0259> m<U+0254><U+0303>t<U+025B><U+0272>|lang}}; 28 February 1533&nbsp;<U+2013> 13 September 1592) was one of the most influential writers of the [[French Renaissance]], known for popularizing the [[essay]] as a [[literary genre]], and commonly thought of as the father of modern [[skepticism]]. He became famous for his effortless ability to merge serious intellectual exercises with casual anecdotes<ref>His anecdotes are 'casual' only in appearance; Montaigne writes: 'Neither my anecdotes nor my quotations are always employed simply as examples, for authority, or for ornament . . . They often carry, off the subject under discussion, the seed of a richer and more daring matter, and they resonate obliquely with a more delicate tone,' Michel de Montaigne, ''Essais'', Pl<U+00E9>iade, Paris (ed. A. Thibaudet) 1937, Bk. 1, ch.40, p. 252 (tr. Charles Rosen)</ref> and autobiography<U+2014>and his massive volume ''[[Essais]]'' (translated literally as "Attempts" or "Trials") contains, to this day, some of the most widely influential essays ever written. Montaigne had a direct influence on writers all over the world, including [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes]],<ref>Buckley, Michael J., At the Origins of Modern Atheism, Yale UP, 1990, p. 69.</ref> [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Albert Hirschman]], [[William Hazlitt]],<ref name="Kinnaird p. 274">Kinnaird, John, ''William Hazlitt: Critic of Power'', Columbia University Press, 1978, p. 274.</ref> [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Eric Hoffer]],<ref>from ''Truth Imagined'', memoir by Eric Hoffer.</ref> [[Isaac Asimov]], and possibly on the later works of [[William Shakespeare]].

In his own time, Montaigne was admired more as a [[Politician|statesman]] than as an author. The tendency in his essays to digress into anecdotes and personal ruminations was seen as detrimental to proper style rather than as an innovation, and his declaration that, 'I am myself the matter of my book', was viewed by his contemporaries as self-indulgent. In time, however, Montaigne would be recognized as embodying, perhaps better than any other author of his time, the spirit of freely entertaining doubt which began to emerge at that time. He is most famously known for his skeptical remark, '''Que s<U+00E7>ay-je''?' ('What do I know?' in [[Middle French]]; modern French ''Que sais-je?''). Remarkably modern even to readers today, Montaigne's attempt to examine the world through the lens of the only thing he can depend on implicitly<U+2014>his own judgment<U+2014>makes him more accessible to modern readers than any other author of the Renaissance. Much of modern literary non-fiction has found inspiration in Montaigne and writers of all kinds continue to read him for his masterful balance of intellectual knowledge and personal story-telling.

Montaigne was born in the [[Aquitaine]] region of France, on the family estate [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Montaigne]], in a town now called [[Saint-Michel-de-Montaigne]], not far from [[Bordeaux, France|Bordeaux]]. The family was very rich; his great-grandfather, Ramon Felipe Eyquem, had made a fortune as a herring merchant and had bought the estate in 1477, thus becoming the Lord of Montaigne. His father, Pierre Eyquem, Seigneur of Montaigne, was a [[Roman Catholicism in France|French Catholic]] soldier in Italy for a time and had also been the mayor of Bordeaux. Although there were several families bearing the patronym 'Eyquem' in Guyenne, his family is thought to have had some degree of [[Marrano]] ([[Spanish and Portuguese Jew]]) origins.<ref>Sophie Jama, ''L<U+2019>Histoire Juive de Montaigne'' [''The Jewish History of Montaigne''], Paris, Flammarion, 2001, page 76.</ref> His mother, Antoinette L<U+00F3>pez de Villanueva, was a convert to Protestantism.{{Cn|date=May 2013}} His maternal grandfather, Pedro Lopez,<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=CObUAAAAMAAJ&q=Honorette+DUPUY+Pierre&dq=Honorette+DUPUY+Pierre | title = Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Franz<U+00F6>sische Sprache und Literatur | author1 = Winkler | first1 = Emil | year = 1942}}</ref> from [[Zaragoza]], was from a wealthy [[Marrano]] ([[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jewish]]) family who had converted to Catholicism.<ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0014_0_14134.html</ref><ref>''Introduction: Montaigne's Life and Times'', in ''Apology for Raymond Sebond'', By Michel de Montaigne (Roger Ariew), (Hackett: 2003), page iv: "Michel de Montaigne was born in 1533 at the chateau de Montagine (about 30 miles east of Bordeaux), the son of Pierre Eyquem, Seigneur de Montaigne, and Antoinette de Louppes (or Lopez), who came from a wealthy (originally Iberian) Jewish family".</ref><ref>"...the family of Montaigne's mother, Antoinette de Louppes (Lopez) of Toulouse, was of Spanish Jewish origin...."

His mother lived a great part of Montaigne's life near him, and even survived him, but is mentioned only twice in his essays. Montaigne's relationship with his father, however, is frequently reflected upon and discussed in his essays.

From the moment of his birth, Montaigne's education followed a [[pedagogy|pedagogical plan]] sketched out by his father and refined by the advice of the latter's [[humanism|humanist]] friends. Soon after his birth, Montaigne was brought to a small cottage, where he lived the first three years of life in the sole company of a peasant family, 'in order to', according to the elder Montaigne, 'draw the boy close to the people, and to the life conditions of the people, who need our help.'<ref>Montaigne. ''Essays'', III, 13</ref> After these first spartan years, Montaigne was brought back to the ch<U+00E2>teau. The objective was for [[Latin language|Latin]] to become his first language. The intellectual education of Montaigne was assigned to a German tutor (a doctor named Horstanus who couldn't speak French). His father hired only servants who could speak Latin and they also were given strict orders to always speak to the boy in Latin. The same rule applied to his mother, father, and servants, who were obliged to use only Latin words he himself employed, and thus acquired a knowledge of the very language his tutor taught him. Montaigne's Latin education was accompanied by constant intellectual and spiritual stimulation. He was familiarized with Greek by a pedagogical method that employed games, conversation, and exercises of solitary meditation, rather than books.

The atmosphere of the boy's life, although designed by highly refined rules taken under advisement by his father, created in the boy's life the spirit of "liberty and delight", in order to "to make me relish... duty by an unforced will, and of my own voluntary motion... without any severity or constraint;"<ref name=essay2>http://montaigne.classicauthors.net/Essays/Essays2.html</ref> yet he would have everything in order to take advantage of his freedom. And so a musician woke him every morning, playing one instrument or another,<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first= Robert Maynard|editor1-last=Hutchins |editor2-first=W. Carew|editor2-last=Hazlitt |others= Trans. Charles Cotton|title=The Essays of Michel Eyquem de Montaigne |accessdate= |series=Great Books of the Western World |volume=twenty-five |year= 1952|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |page=v |quote=He had his son awakened each morning by 'the sound of a musical instrument'}}</ref> and an ''[[<U+00E9>pinettier]]'' (with a [[zither]]) was the constant companion to Montaigne and his tutor, playing a tune to alleviate boredom and tiredness.

Around the year 1539, Montaigne was sent to study at a prestigious [[boarding school]] in Bordeaux, the [[College of Guienne|Coll<U+00E8>ge de Guyenne]], then under the direction of the greatest Latin scholar of the era, [[George Buchanan]], where he mastered the whole curriculum by his thirteenth year. He then studied law in [[Toulouse]] and entered a career in the local legal system. He was a counselor of the Court des Aides of [[P<U+00E9>rigueux]] and, in 1557, he was appointed counselor of the [[Parlement]] in Bordeaux (a high court). From 1561 to 1563 he was [[courtier]] at the court of [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]]; he was present with the king at the [[siege of Rouen (1562)]]. He was awarded the highest honour of the French nobility, the [[Collar (Order of Knighthood)|collar]] of the Order of St. Michael, something to which he aspired from his youth. While serving at the Bordeaux Parliament, he became very close friends with the humanist poet [[<U+00C9>tienne de la Bo<U+00E9>tie]], whose death in 1563 deeply affected Montaigne. It has been argued that because of Montaigne's "imperious need to communicate," that, after losing <U+00C9>tienne, he began the ''[[Essais]]'' as his "means of communication;" and that "the reader takes the place of the dead friend."<ref>Frame, Donald (translator). ''The Complete Essays of Montaigne.'' 1943. p.v.</ref>

In a prearranged marriage, Montaigne married Fran<U+00E7>oise de la Cassaigne. He did not marry her under his own free will and was pressured by family to do so;{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} they had six daughters, though only the second-born survived childhood.
{{French literature sidebar}}
Following the petition of his father, Montaigne started to work on the first translation of the Catalan monk [[Raymond Sebond]]'s ''[[Theologia naturalis]]'', which he published a year after his father's death in 1568 (In 1595, Sebond's Prologue was put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] for its declaration that the Bible is not the only source of revealed truth). After this, he inherited the family's estate, the Ch<U+00E2>teau de Montaigne, to which he moved back in 1570, thus becoming the Lord of Montaigne. Another literary accomplishment was Montaigne's posthumous edition of his friend Bo<U+00E9>tie's works.

In 1571, he retired from public life to the [[Montaigne's tower|Tower of the Ch<U+00E2>teau]], his so-called "citadel", in the [[Dordogne]], where he almost totally isolated himself from every social and family affair. Locked up in his library, which contained a collection of some 1,500 works, he began work on his ''Essais'' ("Essays"), first published in 1580. On the day of his 38th birthday, as he entered this almost ten-year period of self-imposed reclusion, he had the following inscription crown the bookshelves of his working chamber:

<blockquote>'In the year of Christ 1571, at the age of thirty-eight, on the last day of February, his birthday, Michael de Montaigne, long weary of the servitude of the court and of public employments, while still entire, retired to the bosom of the learned virgins, where in calm and freedom from all cares he will spend what little remains of his life, now more than half run out. If the fates permit, he will complete this abode, this sweet ancestral retreat; and he has consecrated it to his freedom, tranquility, and leisure.<U+2019><ref>As cited by Richard L. Regosin, <U+2018>Montaigne and His Readers', in Denis Hollier (ed.) ''A New History of French Literature'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, London 1995, pp. 248<U+2013>252, p. 249. The Latin original runs: 'An.

During this time of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] in France, Montaigne, a Roman Catholic, acted as a moderating force,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} respected both by the Catholic [[Henry III of France|King Henry III]] and the Protestant [[Henry of Navarre]].

In 1578, Montaigne, whose health had always been excellent, started suffering from painful [[kidney stone]]s, a sickness he had inherited from his father's family. Throughout this illness, he would have nothing to do with doctors or drugs.<ref name=cne/> From 1580 to 1581, Montaigne traveled in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy, partly in search of a cure, establishing himself at Bagni di Lucca where he took the waters. His journey was also a pilgrimage to the Holy House of Loreto, to which he presented a silver relief depicting himself and his wife and daughter kneeling before the Madonna, considering himself fortunate that it should be hung on a wall within the shrine.<ref>Edward Chaney, ''The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance'', 2nd ed. (London, 2000), p. 89.</ref> He kept a fascinating journal recording regional differences and customs and a variety of personal episodes, including the dimensions of the stones he succeeding in ejecting from his bladder.

Frame and foreword by Guy Davenport, San Francisco, 1983</ref>

While travelling through Rome in 1581 Montaigne was detained in order to have the text of his ''Essais'' examined by [[Sisto Fabri]] who served as [[Theologian of the Pontifical Household|Master of the Sacred Palace]] under [[Pope Gregory XIII]].  After Fabri examined Montaigne's ''Essais'' the text was returned to its author on 20 March, 1581.  Montaigne had apologized for references to the pagan notion of "fortuna" as well as for writing favorably of [[Julian the Apostate]] and of heretical poets, and was released to follow his own conscience in making emendations to the text.<ref>''Treccani.it, L'encicolpedia Italiana, [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sisto-fabri_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ Dizionario Biografico'']. Accessed 10 August, 2013</ref>

While in the city of [[Lucca]] in 1581, he learned that he had been elected mayor of Bordeaux; he returned and served as mayor. He was reelected in 1583 and served until 1585, again moderating between Catholics and Protestants. The [[Black Death|plague]] broke out in Bordeaux toward the end of his second term in office, in 1585. In 1586, the plague and the Wars of Religion prompted him to leave his ch<U+00E2>teau for two years.<ref name=cne/>

Montaigne continued to extend, revise, and oversee the publication of ''Essais''. In 1588 he wrote its third book and also met the writer [[Marie de Gournay]], who admired his work and later edited and published it. Montaigne called her his adopted daughter.<ref name=cne>{{Cite Collier's|Montaigne, Michel, Seigneur}}</ref> King [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] was assassinated in 1589, and Montaigne then helped to keep Bordeaux loyal to [[Henry of Navarre]], who would go on to become King Henry IV.

Montaigne died of [[Peritonsillar abscess|quinsy]] at the age of 59, in 1592 at the Ch<U+00E2>teau de Montaigne. The disease in his case "brought about paralysis of the tongue",<ref>Montaigne, Michel de, ''Essays of Michel de Montaigne'', tr. [[Charles Cotton]], ed. [[William Carew Hazlitt]], 1877, "The Life of Montaigne" in v. 1. n.p., Kindle edition.</ref> and he had once said "the most fruitful and natural play of the mind is conversation. I find it sweeter than any other action in life; and if I were forced to choose, I think I would rather lose my sight than my hearing and voice."<ref>"The Autobiography of Michel De Montaign", translated, introduced, and edited by Marvin Lowenthal, David R.

He was buried nearby. Later his remains were moved to the church of [[Saint]] [[Antoine]] at Bordeaux. The church no longer exists: it became the [[Convent des Feuillants]], which has also disappeared.<ref>Bakewell, Sarah.  ''How to Live <U+2013> or <U+2013> A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer'' (2010), pp. 325<U+2013>6, p. 365 (n. 325).</ref> The Bordeaux Tourist Office says that Montaigne is buried at the Mus<U+00E9>e Aquitaine, Facult<U+00E9> des Lettres, Universit<U+00E9> Bordeaux 3 Michel de Montaigne, [[Pessac]].

==''Essais''==
{{Main|Essays (Montaigne)}}
His fame rests on the ''Essais'', a collection of a large number of short subjective treatments of various topics published in 1580, inspired by his studies in the classics, especially [[Plutarch]]. Montaigne's stated goal is to describe humans, and especially himself, with utter frankness.
Montaigne's writings are studied within literary studies, as literature and philosophy around the world.

Inspired by his consideration of the lives and ideals of the leading figures of his age, he finds the great variety and volatility of human nature to be its most basic features. He describes his own poor memory, his ability to solve problems and mediate conflicts without truly getting emotionally involved, his disdain for the human pursuit of lasting fame, and his attempts to detach himself from worldly things to prepare for his timely death. He writes about his disgust with the religious conflicts of his time, reflecting a spirit of [[skepticism]] and belief that humans are not able to attain true certainty. The longest of his essays, ''[[Apology for Raymond Sebond]]'', contains his famous motto, "What do I know?"

Montaigne considered marriage necessary for the raising of children, but disliked strong feelings of passionate love because he saw them as detrimental to freedom. In education, he favored concrete examples and experience over the teaching of abstract knowledge that has to be accepted uncritically. His essay "On the Education of Children" is dedicated to [[Diana of Foix]].

The ''Essais'' exercised important influence on both French and English literature, in thought and style.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=The Western Canon}}</ref> [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[Essays (Francis Bacon)|''Essays'']], published over a decade later, in 1596, are usually assumed to be directly influenced by Montaigne's collection, and Montaigne is cited by Bacon alongside other classical sources in later essays.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bakewell|first=Sarah|title=How to live : a life of Montaigne in one question and twenty attempts at an answer|year=2010|publisher=Vintage|location=London|isbn=9780099485155|page=280|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=27yZQxm0OX8C&lpg=PA280&dq=francis%20bacon%20montaigne&pg=PA280#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

==Montaigne's Influence on Psychology==

Though not a scientist, Montaigne made observations on topics in psychology.<ref name="King">King, Brett; Viney, Wayne; Woody, William.''A History of Psychology: Ideas and Context'', 4th ed., Pearson Education, Inc. 2009, p.112.</ref> In his essays, he developed and explained his observations of these topics.His thoughts and ideas covered topics including (but not limited to) thought, motivation, fear, happiness, child education, experience, and human action. Montaigne<U+2019>s ideas have had an impact on psychology and are a part of psychology<U+2019>s rich history.

'''Child Education'''

Child education was among the psychological topics that he wrote about.<ref name="King"/> His essays ''On the Education of Children'', ''On Pedantry'', and ''On Experience'' explain the views he had on child education.<ref name="Hall1997"> Hall, Michael L. ''Montaigne's Uses of Classical Learning''. "Journal of Education" 1997, Vol. 179 Issue 1, p.61</ref>{{rp|61}}{{rp|62}}{{rp|70}} Some of his views on child education are still relevant today.<ref name="Ediger">Ediger, Marlow.'' Influence of ten leading educators on American education''.''Education'' Vol. 118 Issue 2, p.270</ref> 

Montaigne<U+2019>s views on the education of children were opposed to the common educational practices of his day.<ref name="Hall1997"/>{{rp|63}}{{rp|67}}He found fault with both what was taught and how it was taught.<ref name="Hall1997"/>{{rp|62}} Much of the education during Montaigne<U+2019>s time was focused on the reading of the classics and learning through books.<ref name="Hall1997"/>{{rp|67}}Montaigne disagreed with learning strictly through books. He believed it was necessary to educate children in a variety of ways.He also disagreed with the way information was being presented to students. It was being presented in a way that encouraged students to take the information that was taught to them as absolute truth. Students were denied the chance to question the information. Therefore, students could not truly learn. Montaigne believed that to truly learn, a student had to take the information and make it their own.

At the foundation Montaigne believed that the selection of a good tutor was important for the student to become well educated.<ref name="Hall1997"/>{{rp|66}} Education by a tutor was to be done at the pace of the student.<ref name="Hall1997"/>{{rp|67}}He believed that a tutor should be in dialogue with the student, letting the student speak first. The tutor should also allow for discussions and debates to be had. Through this dialogue, it was meant to create an environment in which students would teach themselves. They would be able to realize their mistakes and make corrections to them as necessary. 

Individualized learning was integral to his theory of child education as well. He argued that student combines information he already knows with what is learned and forms a unique prospective on the newly learned information from his previous knowledge.<ref name="Worley"> Worley, Virginia. ''Painting With Impasto: Metaphors, Mirrors, and Reflective Regression in Montagne's 'Of the Education of Children.' '' ''Educational Theory'', Jun 2012, Vol. 62 Issue 3, p.343-370.</ref>{{rp|356}} Montaigne also thought that tutors should encourage a student<U+2019>s natural curiosity and allow them to question things.<ref name="Hall1997"/>{{rp|68}}He postulated that a successful student was one that was encouraged to question things and study them for themselves, rather than simply accepting what they heard from the authorities on any given topic. Montaigne believed that a child<U+2019>s curiosity could serve as an important teaching tool when a child is allowed to explore the things that they are curious about.

Experience was also a key element to learning for Montaigne. Tutors needed to teach students through experience rather than through the mere memorization of knowledge often practiced in book learning.<ref name="Hall1997"/>{{rp|62}}{{rp|67}}He argued that students would become passive adults; blindly obeying and lacking the ability to think on their own.<ref name="Worley"/>{{rp|354}}Nothing of importance would be retained and no abilities would be learned.<ref name="Hall1997"/>{{rp|62}} He believed that learning through experience was superior to learning through the use of books.<ref name="Ediger"/> For this reason he encouraged tutors to educate their students through practice, travel, and human interaction. In doing so, he argued that students would become active learners, who could claim knowledge for themselves.  

Montaigne<U+2019>s views on child education continue to have an influence in the present. Variations of Montaigne<U+2019>s ideas on education are incorporated into modern learning in some ways. He argued against the popular way of teaching in his day, encouraging individualized learning. He believed in the importance of experience over book learning and memorization. Ultimately, Montaigne postulated that the point of education was to teach a student how to have a successful life by practicing an active and socially interactive lifestyle..<ref name="Worley"/>{{rp|355}}

The very words that import lying, falshood, treason, dissimulations, covetousnes, envie, detraction, and pardon, were never heard of amongst them.

However, as with [[Cervantes]], [[Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] similarities with writers in other nations could be due simply to their simultaneous study of Latin moral and philosophical writers such as [[Seneca the Younger]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]] and [[Virgil]].

Much of [[Blaise Pascal]]'s skepticism in his ''[[Pens<U+00E9>es]]'' has been traditionally attributed to his reading Montaigne.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eliot|first=Thomas Stearns|title=Introduction to Pascal's Essays|year=1958|publisher=E. P. Dutton and Co.|location=New York|page=viii|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-8.txt}}</ref>

The English essayist [[William Hazlitt]] expressed boundless admiration for Montaigne, exclaiming that "he was the first who had the courage to say as an author what he felt as a man. ... He was neither a pedant nor a bigot.  ... In treating of men and manners, he spoke of them as he found them, not according to preconceived notions and abstract dogmas".<ref>Quoted from Hazlitt's "On the Periodical Essayists" in Park, Roy, ''Hazlitt and the Spirit of the Age'', Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1971, pp. 172<U+2013>73.</ref> Beginning most overtly with the essays in the "[[Essay#Familiar|familiar]]" style in his own ''[[Table-Talk (Hazlitt)|Table-Talk]]'', Hazlitt tried to follow Montaigne's example.<ref name="Kinnaird p. 274"/>

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] chose "Montaigne; or, the Skeptic" as a subject of one of his series of lectures entitled ''Representative Men'', alongside other subjects such as Shakespeare and Plato. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] judged of Montaigne: "That such a man wrote has truly augmented the joy of living on this Earth".<ref>Nietzsche, ''Untimely Meditations'', Chapter 3, "Schopenhauer as Educator," Cambridge University Press, 1988, p. 135</ref>

The American philosopher [[Eric Hoffer]] employed Montaigne both stylistically and in thought. In Hoffer's memoir, ''Truth Imagined'', he said of Montaigne, "He was writing about me. He knew my innermost thoughts." The Welsh novelist [[John Cowper Powys]] expressed his admiration for Montaigne's philosophy in his books ''Suspended Judgements'' (1916) and ''The Pleasures of Literature'' (1938). [[Judith N. Shklar]] introduces her book ''Ordinary Vices'' (1984), "It is only if we step outside the divinely ruled moral universe that we can really put our minds to the common ills we inflict upon one another each day. That is what Montaigne did and that is why he is the hero of this book. In spirit he is on every one of its pages..."
