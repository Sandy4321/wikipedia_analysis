'''Artabanes''' ({{lang-el|{{Polytonic|<U+1F08><U+03C1><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03B2><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C2>}}}}, from Old Armenian [[wikt:<U+0531><U+0580><U+057F><U+0561><U+0582><U+0561><U+0576>|Artawan]], ''[[floruit|fl.]]'' 538<U+2013>554) was an [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman (Byzantine)]] general of [[Armenians|Armenian]] origin who served under [[Justinian I]] (r. 527<U+2013>565). Initially a rebel against Byzantine authority, he fled to the [[Sassanid Persia]]ns but soon returned to Byzantine allegiance. He served in [[Praetorian prefecture of Africa|Africa]], where he won great fame by killing the rebel general [[Guntharic]] and restoring the province to imperial allegiance. He became engaged to Justinian's niece [[Praejecta]], but did not eventually marry her due to the opposition of the Empress [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]]. Recalled to [[Constantinople]], he became involved in a failed conspiracy against Justinian in 548/549, but was not severely punished after its revelation. He was soon pardoned and sent to [[Italian peninsula|Italy]] to fight in the [[Gothic War (535<U+2013>554)|Gothic War]], where he participated in the decisive Byzantine victory at [[Battle of Casilinum|Casilinum]].

== Early life <U+2013> Revolt against Byzantium ==
Artabanes was a descendant of the royal Armenian [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid line]], a branch of which at the time was recognized as [[Roman Armenia#Eastern Roman Armenia|autonomous local princes]] in the eastern fringes of the Eastern Roman Empire. His father was named John, and he had a brother also named John.<ref name="PLRE125">Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 125</ref> In 538/539, Artabanes, at the time apparently still a young man, took part in the Armenian conspiracy against Acacius, the [[proconsul]] of [[First Armenia]], whose heavy taxes and cruel behaviour was greatly resented. Artabanes himself killed Acacius. Shortly after, in a skirmish between the rebels and the Byzantine army at Oenochalacon, Artabanes may have killed the Byzantine general [[Sittas]], sent by Justinian to quell the rebellion ([[Procopius]] supplies two accounts, one attributing Sittas' death to Artabanes and another to an otherwise unknown Armenian named Solomon).<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 8<U+2013>9, 125, 1162</ref> Artabanes' father tried to negotiate a settlement with Sittas' successor, [[Bouzes]], but was murdered by the latter. This act forced Artabanes and his followers to seek the aid of the [[Sassanid Persia]]n ruler, [[Khosrau I]] (r. 531<U+2013>579). Crossing over to Persian territory, over the next few years Artabanes and those who followed him took part in Khosrau's [[Roman<U+2013>Persian Wars#Justinian vs. Khosrau I|campaigns]] against the Byzantines.<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 125, 255, 641</ref>

== Return to Byzantine service ==
At some time around 544, perhaps as early as 542, Artabanes, his brother John and several other Armenians deserted back to the Byzantine camp.<ref name="PLRE125"/>

=== Service in Africa ===
Along with his brother, Artabanes was placed in command of a small Armenian contingent and sent to [[Praetorian prefecture of Africa|Africa]] in spring 545 under the senator Areobindus.<ref name="PLRE125"/> There the Byzantines were engaged in a protracted war with the rebellious [[Moors|Moorish tribes]]. Shortly after their arrival, John died in battle at Sicca Veneria with the rebel forces of the renegade [[Stotzas]].<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 108, 643</ref> Artabanes and his men remained loyal to Areobindus during the rebellion of the ''dux Numidiae'' [[Guntharic]] in late 545. Guntharic, allied with the Moorish chieftain [[Antalas]], marched on [[Carthage]] and seized the city gates. At the urging of Artabanes and others, Areobindus decided to confront the rebel. The two armies appeared evenly matched, until Areobindus took fright and fled to a monastery seeking sanctuary. Thereupon the troops loyal to him also fled, and the city fell to Guntharic.<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 108<U+2013>109, 126, 575</ref> 

Areobindus was murdered by Guntharic, but Artabanes secured guarantees of his safety and pledged himself to Guntharic's service. In secret however he began planning to overthrow him. Soon after, Artabanes was entrusted with an expedition against Antalas' Moors. He marched south, along with an allied Moorish contingent under [[Cutzinas]]. Antalas' men fled before him, but Artabanes did not pursue them and turned back. According to Procopius, he considered leading his men to join the loyalist imperial garrison that held out at [[Hadrumetum]], but decided to return to Carthage and go on with his plan to assassinate Guntharic.<ref name="PLRE126">Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 126</ref>

Upon his return to Carthage, he justified his decision to turn back by insisting that the entire army was needed to quell the insurgents, and urged Guntharic to set forth himself. At the same time, he conspired with his nephew, Gregory, and a few other of his Armenian bodyguards to murder the usurper (although [[Corippus]] suggests that it was the [[praetorian prefect]] Athanasius who was the real mastermind of the plot). On the eve of the army's departure in early May, Guntharic hosted a great banquet, and invited Artabanes and Athanasius to share the same couch, a mark of honour. Suddenly, during the banquet, Artabanes' Armenians fell upon Gontharic's bodyguards, while Artabanes himself allegedly landed the killing blow on Guntharic.<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 126<U+2013>127, 143, 576</ref><ref name="Bury146">Bury (1958), p. 146</ref>

This deed won him great honour and fame: [[Praejecta]], the widow of Areobindus and niece of Justinian, whom Guntharic was planning to marry, gave him a rich reward, while the emperor confirmed him as ''[[magister militum]]'' of Africa. Despite being already married to a relative of his, Artabanes eventually became engaged with Praejecta. He sent her back to [[Constantinople]] and himself asked from Justinian to be recalled from Africa, so that they could marry.<ref name="Bury146"/><ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 125, 127, 576, 1048</ref>

=== Constantinople <U+2013> Conspiracy against Justinian ===
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 004.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Emperor Justinian I]]
Soon afterwards, Artabanes was indeed recalled to Constantinople, replaced in Africa by [[John Troglita]]. He received numerous honours from Justinian, and was named ''magister militum praesentalis'', ''[[comes]] [[foederati|foederatorum]]'' and honourary [[Roman consul|consul]]. Despite these and his great popularity however, he was unable to achieve his ambition of marrying Praejecta: his wife came to the imperial capital and presented her case to the Empress [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]]. The Empress compelled Artabanes to retain his wife, and not until after Theodora's death in 548 was the Armenian general able to divorce himself. By then however Praejecta had already been re-married.<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 127<U+2013>128, 1048<U+2013>1049</ref><ref>Bury (1958), p. 67</ref>

Irritated over this affair, shortly after Theodora's death (late 548/early 549) he became involved in the so-called "Armenian Plot" or "Conspiracy of Artabanes". The real instigator however was a relative of his, named Arsaces, who proposed to assassinate Justinian, and elevate Justinian's cousin [[Germanus (cousin of Justinian I)|Germanus]] on the throne instead. The conspirators thought Germanus amenable to their plans, since he had been dissatisfied with Justinian's meddling in the settling of the will of his recently deceased brother Boraides, which had initially named Germanus as the major beneficiary as opposed to the former's sole daughter.<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 128</ref><ref>Bury (1958), pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref> The conspirators approached Germanus' son [[Justin (consul 540)|Justin]] first, and revealed to him the plot. Immediately he informed his father, and he in turn informed the ''[[comes excubitorum]]'' [[Marcellus (comes excubitorum)|Marcellus]]. In order to find out more of their intentions, Germanus met the conspirators in person, while a trusted aide of Marcellus was concealed nearby and listened in.<ref>Bury (1958), pp. 67<U+2013>68</ref> Although Marcellus hesitated to inform Justinian without further proof, eventually he revealed the conspiracy to the emperor. Justinian ordered the conspirators imprisoned and questioned, but they were otherwise treated remarkably leniently. Artabanes was stripped of his offices and confined to the palace under guard, but was soon pardoned.<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 128<U+2013>129</ref><ref>Bury (1958), p. 68</ref>

=== Service in Italy ===

Indeed, in 550 he was appointed ''magister militum per [[Diocese of Thrace|Thracias]]'' and sent to replace the aged senator [[Liberius (praetorian prefect)|Liberius]] in command of an expedition under way against [[Sicily]], which had recently been overrun by the [[Ostrogoth]] king [[Totila]]. Artabanes failed to catch up with the expedition before it salied for Sicily, and his own fleet was driven back and scattered by severe storms in the [[Ionian Sea]].<ref name="PLRE129">Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 129</ref><ref>Bury (1958), pp. 69, 255<U+2013>256</ref> Eventually he arrived in Sicily and took command of the Byzantine forces there. He besieged the Gothic garrisons left behind by Totila after he left the island and soon forced them to surrender. Over the next two years, he remained in Sicily. According to Procopius, the inhabitants of the mainland city of [[Croton]], which was being besieged by the Goths, repeatedly sent to him for help, but he did nothing.<ref name="PLRE129"/><ref>Bury (1958), p. 260</ref> 

In 553 he crossed over into mainland Italy, where he joined the army of [[Narses]] as one of its generals. Facing the [[Franks|Frankish]] invasion in summer 553, Narses ordered Artabanes and other generals to occupy the passes of the [[Apennines]] and harass the enemy advance; after a Byzantine contingent was defeated at [[Parma]] however, the other Byzantine generals withdrew to [[Faventia]], until an envoy from Narses persuaded them to move up to the area of Parma again.<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 129<U+2013>130</ref> In 554, Artabanes was stationed at [[Pisaurum]] with Byzantine and [[Huns|Hunnic]] troops. At Fanum, he ambushed and defeated the advance guard of the Frankish army of [[Leutharis]], which was returning from a plundering expedition into southern Italy and heading back to [[Gaul]]. Most of the Franks fell, and in the confusion, the many captives escaped, taking much of the Franks' booty with them. Artabanes did not engage the main body of Leutharis' army however, since it far outnumbered his own force.<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 130, 789<U+2013>790</ref> He then marched south and joined Narses' main force, accompanying him in his campaign against the remaining Frankish army under [[Butilinus]]. At the decisive Byzantine victory in the [[Battle of Casilinum]], along with Valerian he commanded the cavalry in the Byzantine left flank. They were concealed in a wood, as part of Narses' stratagem to attack the Franks in the rear and encircle them. Nothing further is known of him after that.<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 130</ref><ref>Bury (1958), p. 279</ref>
