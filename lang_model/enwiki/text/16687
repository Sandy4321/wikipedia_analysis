'''US Highway&nbsp;141''' ('''US&nbsp;141''') is a north<U+2013>south [[United States Numbered Highway]] in the states of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]]. The highway runs north-northwesterly from an interchange with [[Interstate 43]] (I-43) in [[Bellevue, Wisconsin]], near [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], to a junction with [[U.S. Route 41 in Michigan|US&nbsp;41]]/[[M-28 (Michigan highway)|M-28]] near [[Covington, Michigan]]. In between, it follows city streets in Green Bay and has a [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] section with [[U.S. Route 41 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;41 in Wisconsin]]. North of Green Bay, US&nbsp;141 is either a [[freeway]] or an [[Limited-access road|expressway]] into rural northern Wisconsin before downgrading to an [[undivided highway]]. In Michigan, US&nbsp;141 is an undivided highway that runs through rural woodlands. The highway has two segments in each state; after running through Wisconsin for about {{convert|103|mi|km}}, it crosses into Michigan for approximately another {{convert|8|mi|km<!--|spell=in-->}}. After that, it crosses back into Wisconsin for about {{convert|14+1/2|mi|km|0}} before crossing the state line one last time. The northernmost Michigan section is about {{convert|43+1/2|mi|km|0}}, making the overall length about {{convert|169|mi|km}}.

When the US Highway System was formed on November 11, 1926, US&nbsp;141 ran from [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] to Green Bay, and one segment of the modern highway in Michigan was originally designated '''US&nbsp;102'''. This other designation was [[decommissioned highway|decommissioned]] in 1928 when US&nbsp;141 was extended north from Green Bay into Michigan. Michigan has rebuilt the highway in stages over the years to smooth out sharp curves in the routing. Since the 1960s, the section south of Green Bay has been converted into a freeway in segments. US&nbsp;141 has ended southeast of Green Bay in Bellevue since the 1980s<U+2014>the southern freeway segment was redesignated as I-43. The section north of [[Abrams, Wisconsin]], was converted to a freeway in the opening years of the 21st century, with an additional divided-highway section opening a few years later.

US&nbsp;141 starts at an interchange with I-43 southeast of Green Bay in the suburb of Bellevue. From the terminus at exit&nbsp;178, US&nbsp;141 runs north to Main Street, and then northwesterly along Main Street through town. [[Wisconsin Highway&nbsp;29]] (WIS&nbsp;29) merges with US&nbsp;141 at an intersection on the northwest side of Bellevue, and the two highways [[concurrency (road)|run concurrently]] through residential subdivisions. Main Street passes over I-43 and continues to the north and into the city of Green Bay. US&nbsp;141/WIS&nbsp;29 crosses Baird Creek and runs along the banks of the [[East River (Wisconsin)|East River]]. At the intersection with Monroe Avenue, WIS&nbsp;29 turns south, joining [[Wisconsin Highway 54|WIS&nbsp;54]]/[[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]] while US&nbsp;141 continues westward on Main Street to cross the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]] on the [[Ray Nitschke Memorial Bridge]]. On the west side of the river, the highway follows Dousman Street for a block before turning north along Broadway Avenue for four blocks. From there, the highway follows Mather Street west to Velp Avenue. US&nbsp;141 follows that street northwesterly and parallel to I-43 on the north side of Green Bay. This area is mostly residential with some businesses immediately on either side. In the suburb of Howard, US&nbsp;141 merges onto the US&nbsp;41 [[freeway]] via the interchange at exit&nbsp;170. US&nbsp;41/US&nbsp;141 has an interchange for I-43 just south of the Duck Creek crossing.<ref name=google>{{google maps |url= http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=US-141+N%2FCounty+Rd+MM%2FElm+View+Rd&daddr=44.4546829,-87.9449341+to:44.4763211,-87.9685066+to:M-28+E%2FUS-141+N&hl=en&sll=45.770157,-87.996025&sspn=0.240439,0.232773&geocode=FbYJpgIdanzC-g%3BFRpTpgIdGhHC-in3qDDS-eMCiDGddmVYAnVC_w%3BFaGnpgIdBrXB-inXCAwQXuQCiDFrgIwbUrzqpQ%3BFQjUxgIdIgG6-g&vpsrc=0&mra=mrv&via=1,2&t=h&z=8 |title= Overview Map of US&nbsp;141 |accessdate= January 4, 2012}}</ref><ref name=WisDOT10GB>{{cite map |publisher= Wisconsin Department of Transportation |year= 2010 |title= Official State Highway Map |edition= 2010<U+2013>11 |inset= Green Bay and Vicinity |scale= Scale not given |cartography= WisDOT }}</ref>

From Howard northward, the freeway runs through suburban [[Brown County, Wisconsin|Brown County]] to [[Suamico, Wisconsin|Suamico]], parallel to a line of the [[Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad]] (ELS), through a mixture of farm fields and residential subdivisions. There are [[frontage road]]s on both sides of the freeway to provide access to the properties immediately adjacent to US&nbsp;41/US&nbsp;141. There are a number of interchanges with county-maintained roads between Suamico and [[Abrams, Wisconsin|Abrams]] in [[Oconto County, Wisconsin|Oconto County]]. At Abrams, US&nbsp;141 splits from US&nbsp;41 and heads northward while the latter freeway turns northeasterly. The landscape north of the split transitions to forest, and the freeway crosses the [[Oconto River]] in [[Stiles, Wisconsin|Stiles]] south of the interchange with [[Wisconsin Highway 22|WIS&nbsp;22]]. The freeway bypasses [[Lena, Wisconsin|Lena]] to the east and continues north through mixed farm fields and forest to the county line. North of the line, US&nbsp;141 continues to the [[Marinette County, Wisconsin|Marinette County]] communities of [[Coleman, Wisconsin|Coleman]] and [[Pound, Wisconsin|Pound]] as an [[Limited-access road|expressway]]. Past the latter town, US&nbsp;141 transitions from expressway to a two-lane undivided highway.<ref name=WisDOT10>{{cite map |publisher= Wisconsin Department of Transportation |year= 2010 |title= Official State Highway Map |edition= 2010<U+2013>11 |section= I4<U+2013>I6, H3 |scale= Scale not given |cartography= WisDOT }}</ref><ref name=google/>

[[File:BeecherWisconsinSignUS141.jpg|thumb|right|Headed northward into Beecher, Wisconsin]]
South of [[Crivitz, Wisconsin|Crivitz]], US&nbsp;141 crosses the [[Peshtigo River]]. The highway crosses a branch line of the ELS  on the east side of Crivitz and continues north through woodland to the community of [[Middle Inlet, Wisconsin|Middle Inlet]]. North of town, the roadway turns northeasterly to the community of [[Wausaukee, Wisconsin|Wausaukee]] where it intersects [[Wisconsin Highway 180|WIS&nbsp;180]]. From there, the highway passes through the communities of [[Amberg, Wisconsin|Amberg]] and [[Beecher, Wisconsin|Beecher]] before coming into [[Pembine, Wisconsin|Pembine]]. That town is where [[U.S. Route 8|US&nbsp;8]] merges in from the west. The two highways run concurrently north and northeasterly to an intersection southeast of [[Niagara, Wisconsin|Niagara]]. US&nbsp;8 separates to the east, and US&nbsp;141 turns northwestly along River Street into Niagara. The highway then turns north along Roosevelt Road and over the [[Menominee River]] to exit the state of Wisconsin.<ref name=WisDOT10/><ref name=google/>

===Qunnesec northward===
Once in Michigan, {{convert|1|mi|km<!--|spell=in-->}} west of [[Quinnesec, Michigan|Quinnesec]], US&nbsp;141 meets and joins [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|US&nbsp;2]]. The two highways run concurrently westward into [[Iron Mountain, Michigan|Iron Mountain]] along Stephenson Avenue, passing through a retail business corridor and into downtown. [[M-95 (Michigan highway)|M-95]] joins the two highways, and all three pass Lake Antoine. M-95 turns off north of town and US&nbsp;2/US&nbsp;141 crosses the Menominee River back into Wisconsin.<ref name=google/><ref name="MDOT10">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Department of Transportation Map |year=2010 |section= C4<U+2013>D4, D5 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:15&nbsp;mi&nbsp;/ 1&nbsp;cm:9&nbsp;km |cartography= MDOT }}</ref>

US&nbsp;2/US&nbsp;141 makes a {{convert|14.5|mi|km|adj=on}} run through [[Florence County, Wisconsin|Florence County]], passing the Spread Eagle Chain of Lakes. The highway serves the communities of [[Spread Eagle, Wisconsin|Spread Eagle]] and [[Florence (CDP), Wisconsin|Florence]]. The only junction with another state trunk highway in Wisconsin on the northern section is with the concurrent highways [[Wisconsin Highway 70|WIS&nbsp;70]] / [[Wisconsin Highway 101|WIS&nbsp;101]] in Florence. The highway crosses back into Michigan on a bridge over the [[Brule River]] south of [[Crystal Falls, Michigan|Crystal Falls]].<ref name=WisDOT10/><ref name=google/>

[[File:US141NorthernTerminusUS41M28.jpg|thumb|left|Northern terminus]]
Across the state line, the trunkline runs through forest near several smaller bodies of water such as Stager, Kennedy and Railroad lakes. The highway enters Crystal Falls on 5th Street. US&nbsp;2/US&nbsp;141 runs along the top of the hill in town and intersects the western terminus of [[M-69 (Michigan highway)|M-69]] next to the [[Iron County Courthouse (Crystal Falls, Michigan)|Iron County Courthouse]]. US&nbsp;141 continues westward on Crystal Avenue and separates from the US&nbsp;2 concurrency on the western edge of town. Running north and northwesterly, US&nbsp;141 passes to the east of the [[Ottawa National Forest]] through rural [[Iron County, Michigan|Iron County]]. The highway crosses the [[Paint River]] and continues through forest to the community of [[Amasa, Michigan|Amasa]]. The trunkline crosses the [[Hemlock River]] on the west side of town. From there, US&nbsp;141 runs northward into the southwest corner of [[Baraga County, Michigan|Baraga County]] and also enters the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. West of Worm Lake, US&nbsp;141 meets [[M-28 (Michigan highway)|M-28]] in the community of Covington. The two highways merge and run easterly for about {{convert|4|mi|km<!--|spell=in-->}} before US&nbsp;141 terminates at US&nbsp;41; M-28 continues eastward, merging with US&nbsp;41.<ref name=google/><ref name=MDOT10/>

==History==

===Initial state highways===
In 1918, when Wisconsin initially numbered its highway system, the route of what initially became US&nbsp;141 followed two separate state highways; [[Wisconsin Highway 17|WIS&nbsp;17]] from downtown Milwaukee to Manitowoc and [[Wisconsin Highway 16|WIS&nbsp;16]] from Manitowoc north to Green Bay. Segments that later became US&nbsp;141 in Wisconsin were numbered [[Wisconsin Highway 15|WIS&nbsp;15]] between Green Bay and Abrams, and [[Wisconsin Highway 38|WIS&nbsp;38]] between Abrams and Wausaukee. North of Wausaukee, the future US Highway was an unnumbered secondary highway.<ref name=WI1918>{{cite map |title=Official Map of the State Trunk Highway System of Wisconsin |publisher=Wisconsin Highway Commission |cartography= WHC  |scale= Scale not given |section= P8<U+2013>Q11, Q11<U+2013>P15 |year= 1918 |url= http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/fullRecord.asp?id=40972 |accessdate= November 14, 2010}}</ref> In 1919, Michigan signed its highway system,<ref name=press-1919-09-20>{{cite news |title=Michigan May Do Well Following Wisconsin's Road Marking System |work= [[The Grand Rapids Press]] |date= September 20, 1919 |page=10 |oclc= 9975013}}</ref> but the state did not have a highway running south from Quinnesec to the state line.

As originally proposed in 1925, several US Highways in Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula were to be designated. However, the routings for two highways were different in Michigan in 1925 than on the final 1926 map. In the original plan, US&nbsp;102 was supposed to replace [[M-15 (Michigan highway)|M-15]] from US&nbsp;2 at [[Rapid River, Michigan|Rapid River]], continue via [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]] into Baraga County, and end at US&nbsp;41 near Covington. At the same time, US&nbsp;41 was to have followed US&nbsp;2 from [[Powers, Michigan|Powers]] to Crystal Falls and continued north to Covington.<ref name="US1925">{{cite report |title=Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925 |author=Secretary of Agriculture |date=November 18, 1925 |publisher= US Department of Agriculture}}</ref> However, when the final plan was approved and implemented on November 11, 1926,<ref name=mcnichol74/> US&nbsp;41 took the eastern routing through Rapid River and Marquette, and US&nbsp;102 was routed between Crystal Falls and Covington.

Wisconsin proposed an addition to the [[Interstate Highway System]] in the 1950s to connect Green Bay, the state's third-largest city, to the system. Variations on this proposal included using either the US&nbsp;41 or US&nbsp;141 corridors, or a new corridor in between. This request was rejected in the 1950s, but it was approved in the 1960s. After approval, the state started the process to convert US&nbsp;141 between Milwaukee and Abrams into a freeway.<ref name=fhwa43/> The first segments of freeway were opened in the Milwaukee area, starting in 1963 between Locust Street and Good Hope Road.<ref name=WI1963>{{cite map |publisher= State Highway Commission of Wisconsin |year= 1963 |title= Wisconsin Highway Map |cartography= SHCW |inset= Milwaukee and Vicinity |scale= Scale not given}}</ref><ref name=WI1964>{{cite map |publisher= State Highway Commission of Wisconsin |year= 1964 |title= Wisconsin Highway Map |cartography= SHCW |inset= Milwaukee and Vicinity |scale= Scale not given }}</ref> The following year, an extension of the freeway opened southward from Locust to North Avenue.<ref name=WI1964/><ref name=WI1965>{{cite map |publisher= State Highway Commission of Wisconsin |year= 1965 |title= Wisconsin Highway Map |cartography= SHCW |inset= Milwaukee and Vicinity |scale= Scale not given}}</ref> By 1965, the bypass of [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]] was opened;<ref name=fhwa43>{{cite web |first1= Stefan |last1= Natzke |first2= Kevin |last2= Adderly |lastauthoramp= y |date= May 4, 2012 |title= Economic Development History of Interstate&nbsp;43 Corridor |work= Economic Development |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |url= http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/economic_development/assistance/i43wi.cfm |accessdate= March 20, 2013}}</ref> the Milwaukee area freeway was extended northward to Brown Deer Road the following year.<ref name=WI1966>{{cite map |publisher= State Highway Commission of Wisconsin |year= 1966 |title= Wisconsin Highway Map |cartography= SHCW |inset= Milwaukee and Vicinity |scale= Scale not given}}</ref><ref name=WI1967M>{{cite map |publisher= State Highway Commission of Wisconsin |year= 1967 |title= Wisconsin Highway Map |cartography= SHCW |inset= Milwaukee and Vicinity |scale= Scale not given}}</ref> Another freeway segment in the Milwaukee area opened in 1967, extending northward to [[Grafton, Wisconsin|Grafton]] in Ozaukee County.<ref name=WI1967>{{cite map |publisher= State Highway Commission of Wisconsin |year= 1967 |title= Wisconsin Highway Map |cartography= SHCW |scale= Scale not given |section= I9}}</ref><ref name=WI1968>{{cite map |publisher= State Highway Commission of Wisconsin |year= 1968 |title= Wisconsin Highway Map |cartography= SHCW |scale= Scale not given |section= I9}}</ref> The last section of US&nbsp;141 in the city of Milwaukee to open as a freeway was completed in 1968 when [[Interstate 94 in Wisconsin|I-94]] was finished through downtown; at the same time, US&nbsp;141 was extended southward from North Avenue to meet I-94.<ref name=WI1968M>{{cite map |publisher= State Highway Commission of Wisconsin |year= 1968 |title= Wisconsin Highway Map |cartography= SHCW |scale= Scale not given |inset= Milwaukee and Vicinity}}</ref><ref name=WI1969M>{{cite map |publisher= State Highway Commission of Wisconsin |year= 1969 |title= Wisconsin Highway Map |cartography= SHCW |scale= Scale not given |inset= Milwaukee and Vicinity}}</ref>
