It was an ancient market settlement.

In the 18th and 19th centuries it became a famous market for animals and craft products called Eski-Djumaia. Industrial development began after the Second World War. Factories producing car batteries and machines for the food industry were opened; later, furniture and textile industries developed. One of Bulgaria's largest wine production factories is located there. The town is a cultural center. In [[2000]], ruins of an ancient Roman town called Missionis (<U+041C><U+0438><U+0441><U+0438><U+043E><U+043D><U+0438><U+0441>) were found near Targovishte.
