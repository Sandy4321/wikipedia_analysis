==Early life==

Flowers was born in [[Jones County, North Carolina|Jones County]], [[North Carolina]] on 29 December 1947.  He was raised in rural Jones County near Phillips Crossroads.  At the age of ten, he started working in the fields with his grandparents, who were sharecroppers.
He graduated from Jones High School in 1965.  Flowers could not afford to attend college so after graduating, he decided to enlist in the Air Force.  Because he was only seventeen, his grandmother had to sign a release allowing him to enlist.  Flowers entered the Air Force on 5 August 1965.<ref name="TSW">Williams, Richard (Technical Sergeant) , [http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123280402 "Longest serving Airman calls it a career"], Air Force Public Affairs Agency, United States Air Force, The Pentagon, Washington, District of Columbia, 21 November 2011.</ref><ref name="TFP">Hanks, Bryan C., [http://www.kinston.com/articles/day-77770-air-veterans.html "Major General from Jones County set to retire after 46-year career in Air Force"], ''The Free Press'', Freedom Communications, Kinston, North Carolina, 11 November 2011.</ref><ref name= "MER">Ruane, Michael E., [http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/defense-depts-longest-serving-general-and-african-american-retires/2011/11/01/gIQAgVCXmM_story.html "Defense Dept.<U+2019>s longest-serving general and African American retires"], The Washington Post, Washington, District of Columbia, 4 November 2011.</ref>

==Enlisted service==

After completing basic military training at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Flowers was assigned to duty as a supply warehouseman at [[Grand Forks Air Force Base]], [[North Dakota]].  After two years at Grand Forks, he was retransferred into the air transportation career field and sent to [[Da Nang Air Base]], [[Republic of Vietnam]].  At Da Nang, Flowers was responsible for collecting casualties, hauling wounded and deceased soldiers out of the jungle at night.<ref name="TSW"/><ref name="AFB">[http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=7833 "Major General Alfred K.

When he completed his bachelor's degree in 1975, Flowers applied for [[Air Force Officer Training School]] and was accepted.  Shortly after his acceptance, his wife (who was still enlisted) was reassigned to Iraklion Air Base in [[Greece]].

In 1976, Flowers finished his master's degree and re-applied to the officer training; however, his application was denied.  He applied again in 1977 and was denied again.
