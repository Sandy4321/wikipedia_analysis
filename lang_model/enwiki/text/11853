Catawissa Creek starts in Luzerne County, not far from Hazleton. It flows west and slightly south into Schuylkill County before flowing north into Columbia County and then west to the [[Susquehanna River]], which it flows into at [[Catawissa, Pennsylvania|Catawissa]]. It parallels Catawissa Mountain for a significant portion of its course.

The [[surface rock]] in Catawissa Creek largely consists of sedimentary rock, such as sandstone and shale. However, there is also coal in the watershed. Major soils in the creek's watershed include the Leck Kill soil and the [[Albrights series]]. Most of the steeper hills in the watershed are situated near the headwaters of the creek.

[[Coal mining]] was once a major industry in the Catawissa Creek watershed, but this is no longer the case. Major [[tributary|tributaries]] of Catawissa Creek include Little Catawissa Creek and Tomhicken Creek. The president of the Catawissa Creek Watershed Restoration Association, Ed Wytovich, called Catawissa Creek "probably the most beautiful screwed-up stream east of the Mississippi".<ref name = "lancasteronline">{{Citation|author = Ad Crable|url = http://lancasteronline.com/article/local/24322_No-longer-dead-in-the-water.html|title = No longer dead in the water|date = July 26, 2006|accessdate = November 14, 2013}}</ref>

The geological features near the headwaters of Catawissa Creek primarily include [[anthracite]] and ridges of [[sandstone]]. The valleys in this part of the watershed are narrow and steep. Elsewhere in the watershed, the topography consists mostly of less steep valleys and some hills.<ref name = "catawissacreekreport"/>

McCauley Mountain and Green Mountain form the sides of the Catawissa Creek valley in Beaver Township, Columbia County. McCauley Mountain has a gradual slope near the creek.<ref name = "annals"/>

At the location where Catawissa Creek flows past [[Nescopeck Mountain]] in Main Township, there is a {{convert|580|ft|m}} layer of rock known as the [[Pocono Formation]]. Below it, there is a {{convert|375|ft|m}} layer of rock called the [[Pocono-Catskill Formation]]. Below the Pocono-Catskill Formation is a layer of red shale that is {{convert|100|ft|m}} thick.<ref name = "annals"/>

Catawissa Creek rises in [[strip mine]]s in southern [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne County]] near [[Audenried, Pennsylvania|Audenried]] and [[McAdoo, Pennsylvania|McAdoo]],<ref name = "catawissacreekreport"/><ref name = "luzerne"/> a few miles southwest of the city of [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania|Hazleton]]. However, it quickly becomes lost in the strip mines of the area. The creek resurfaces in an iron-filled pool west of [[Interstate 81]].<ref name = "catawissacreekreport"/> It runs west through another strip mine before passing into [[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Schuylkill County]].<ref name = "luzerne">{{Citation|author = [[USGS]]|url = http://www.usgwarchives.org/maps/pa/county/luzerne/usgs/luzerne.jpg|title = Luzerne County|date = |accessdate = October 28, 2013}}</ref>

Upon entering Schuylkill County in [[East Union Township, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|East Union Township]], Catawissa Creek flows approximately west-southwest into a valley. In the valley, it goes past the geographical features Round Head and Blue Head, picking up a tributary near Blue Head. Beyond Blue Head, the creek flows past [[Sheppton, Pennsylvania|Sheppton]] and then [[Brandonville, Pennsylvania|Brandonville]]. It picks up a tributary called Rattling Run at the edge of the township, shortly before entering Union Township.<ref>{{Citation|author = [[USGS]]|url = http://www.usgwarchives.org/maps/pa/county/schuyl/usgs/eunion.jpg|title = East Union Township|date = |accessdate = October 28, 2013}}</ref> As the creek enters Union Township, its valley briefly becomes very deep before becoming shallower again.

At Zion Grove, the walls of the creek's valley again become considerably higher and steeper. As it exits Zion Grove, it picks up Tomhicken Creek. Catawissa Creek takes a sharp turn to the west and flows under Red Ridge. At the western edge of Red Ridge, the creek takes a sharp turn northwards, followed shortly afterwards by a gentle turn westwards. It picks up Crooked Run at the edge of North Union Township, and then flows into Columbia County.<ref>{{Citation|author = [[USGS]]|url = http://www.usgwarchives.org/maps/pa/county/schuyl/usgs/nunion.jpg|title = North Union Township|accessdate = October 29, 2013}}</ref>

Catawissa Creek enters Columbia County in [[Beaver Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Beaver Township]]. It immediately passes by Bunker Hill and makes several [[meander]]s and passes by Beaver Valley. An old [[Conrail]] railroad starts paralleling Catawissa Creek at this point. In the southern part of Beaver Township, the creek is situated between [[Buck Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Buck Mountain]] to the east and [[Catawissa Mountain]] to the west. The takes a sharp turn westwards as it passes by [[Shumans, Pennsylvania|Shumans]], where Pennsylvania Route 339 crosses the creek and Beaver Run flows into it. The creek closely follows Catawissa Mountain for a short distance before turning northwards and passing close to McCauley Mountain. It meanders past Dry Ridge and then Full Mill Hill, where Pennsylvania Route 339 crosses it again. The creek makes a [[hairpin turn]] northwards and picks up Gap Run before exiting Beaver Township.<ref name = "beaver">{{Citation|author = [[USGS]]|url = http://www.usgwarchives.org/maps/pa/county/columb/usgs/beaver.jpg|title = Beaver Township|accessdate = October 29, 2013}}</ref> Upon leaving Beaver Township, the creek enters [[Main Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Main Township]].

After picking up Furnace Run, Catawissa Creek flows between Catawissa Mountain and [[Nescopeck Mountain]] in a high, narrow gorge. As the creek leaves the gorge, it passes [[Mainville, Pennsylvania|Mainville]] and enters a [[plain]]. The creek turns west-southwest and the plain narrows slightly. On the south side of the plain is Catawissa Mountain and on the north side are lower hills. After a few miles, the creek flows out of Main Township and into [[Catawissa Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Catawissa Township]].<ref>{{Citation|author = [[USGS]]|url = http://www.usgwarchives.org/maps/pa/county/columb/usgs/main.jpg|title = Main Township|accessdate = October 29, 2013}}</ref> In Catawissa Township, the creek flows southwest to Catawissa. It follows the southern border of Catawissa until it reaches its edge and turns northwards, following the western border of Catawissa. [[Pennsylvania Route 487]] crosses over the creek at this point.

===Modern history===
Settlers of European descent arrived on or near Catawissa Creek before 1776. The settlers included [[Alexander McCauley]] and Andrew Harger. McCauley left the area in 1776 and Harger was abducted by Indians. The Englishman Thomas Wilson was another early settler in the area. He lived in a [[cave]] on Catawissa Creek. The first [[watermill|mill]] in Columbia County was built on Catawissa Creek in 1774.<ref name = "annals"/> Two other mills were built on the Creek in 1789 and 1799.<ref>{{Citation|author = J.H.

There are five drainage tunnels in the Catawissa Creek watershed. They are called Audenried, Onedia #1, Onedia #3, Catawissa, and Green Mountain. The first one of these drains the [[Jeansville Coal Basin]] on the eastern edge of the watershed. The second tunnel empties into, Sugarloaf Creek, a tributary of Catawissa Creek. The third of these empties into Tomhicken Creek, another tributary of Catawissa Creek. The other three empty into Catawissa Creek itself, relatively close to each other. The [[Audenried Tunnel]] is responsible for 80% of the acid mine drainage flowing into Catawissa Creek.<ref name = "catawissacreekreport"/>

78.4% of the land in Catawissa Creek's watershed is [[forest]]ed, 17.4% is [[agriculture|agricultural]], and 1% is developed. 2% of the land in the watershed is former coal-mining land, such as old [[coal mine]]s and [[quarry|quarries]].<ref name = "catawissacreekreport"/>

==Fauna and flora==
Some of Catawissa Creek's tributaries are known to contain [[trout]], but the creek itself does not contain any fish due to pollution from acidic mine drainage.<ref name = "catawissacreekreport"/><ref name = "Genetic studies">{{Citation|publisher = Ardent Media|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=NAa-k2xlKF8C&pg=PA14&dq=catawissa+creek&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yukYUZCQO86N0QG7qYCoCw&ved=0CDgQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=catawissa%20creek&f=false|title = Genetic Studies of Fish|year =1974|accessdate = October 24, 2013}}</ref> In 1966, some [[woodcocks]] were observed to live along Catawissa Creek.<ref name = "Soil survey">{{Citation|url  = http://books.google.com/books?id=tdzwAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA138&dq=catawissa+creek&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yukYUZCQO86N0QG7qYCoCw&ved=0CCQQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=catawissa%20creek&f=false|title = Soil survey|year = 1966|accessdate = October 24, 2013}}</ref>

In the late 1950s, Catawissa Creek was found by the [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]] to have good temperatures for trout habitation, but there was no aquatic life in the creek due to acid mine drainage. This situation continued through the 1960s and 1970s. However, by 1997, large populations of wild trout were found on some tributaries of Catawissa Creek. As of 2003, Catawissa Creek is considered to be a [[cold-water]] [[fishery]] between its headwaters and its confluence with Rattling Run. Several other tributaries, namely Dark Run, Davis Run, Little Catawissa Creek, and Messers Run are designated as high-quality cold water fisheries.<ref name = "catawissacreekreport"/>

Aquatic [[macroinvertebrate]]s are not common in and around Catawissa Creek, as of 2003. However, some adult members of the [[Allocapnia]] and [[Taeniopteryx]] genera have been observed. Large numbers of [[Amphinmeura]] and [[Leuctra]] have also been observed on the creek between its headwaters and the Audenried and Green Mountain tunnels.<ref>{{Citation|author = |url = http://www2.datashed.org/sites/default/files/final_catawissa_creek_restoration_plan.pdf|title = Catawissa Creek Watershed Restoration Plan Update

==Tributaries==
Spies Run and Davis Run are two tributaries that flow into Catawissa Creek within a few miles of its headwaters. Spies Run is about one mile long and joins Catawissa Creek from the south.<ref>{{Citation|url = https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Spies_Run|title = Google Maps|year=2013|accessdate = November 6, 2013}}</ref> Davis Run is slightly longer, about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}. It also joins Catawissa Creek from the south, near [[Brandonville, Pennsylvania|Brandonville]].<ref name = "brandonville google maps">{{Citation|url = https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Brandonville,_PA|title = Google Maps|year=2013|accessdate = November 6, 2013}}</ref> Rattling Run, a {{convert|2.3|mi|km}} tributary, also flows into Catawissa Creek from the south near Brandonville.<ref name = "brandonville google maps"/>

The next tributaries of Catawissa Creek going downstream are Dark Run and Little Catawissa Creek. Dark Run is close to four miles long and flows into Catawissa Creek from the southwest. [[Little Catawissa Creek]] is approximately ten miles long and flows into Catawissa Creek from the west, less than a mile downstream from Dark Run. Little Catawissa Creek starts near [[Centralia, Pennsylvania|Centralia]] and passes by [[Ringtown, Pennsylvania|Ringtown]].<ref>{{Citation|url = https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Little_Catawissa_Creek|title = Google Maps|year = 2013|accessdate = November 6, 2013}}</ref>

[[Tomhicken Creek]] is the next tributary of Catawissa Creek flowing downstream. It has a few tributaries, including Raccoon Creek and Sugarloaf Creek.<ref>{{Citation|url = https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Tomhicken_Creek|title = Google Maps|year = 2013|accessdate = November 6, 2013}}</ref> Approximately two miles downstream of Tomhicken Creek, Crooked Run, Cranberry Run and Klingerman's Run join Catawissa Creek from the south about 2 to 3 miles apart.<ref>{{Citation|url = https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Cranberry_Run,_PA|title = Google Maps|date = 2013|accessdate = November 9, 2013}}</ref>

In addition to Klingerman's Run, Fisher Run and Furnace Run flow down Catawissa Mountain to Catawissa Creek. Scotch Run flows into the creek from the east.<ref>{{Citation|url = https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Scotch_Run,_PA|title = Google Maps|date = 2013|accessdate = November 9, 2013}}</ref>

==Recreation==
It is possible to paddle on much of Catawissa Creek for parts of the year. However, it is not usually possible to paddle on the creek during the summer. Upstream of Mainville, there are some [[riffle]]s and small [[rapid]]s. There is larger rapid downstream of a lowdam in the lower reaches of the creek.<ref name = "paddling"/>
