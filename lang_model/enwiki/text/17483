The work is commonly cited by the abbreviations ''Cat''., ''CW'' (occasionally ''HCW'') or ''GK'' (= ''Gynaikon Katalogos'').</ref>&mdash;is a [[Lost work|fragmentary]] [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek]] [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] that was attributed to [[Hesiod]] during antiquity. The "women" of the title were in fact [[hero]]ines, many of whom lay with gods, bearing the heroes of [[Greek mythology]] to both divine and mortal paramours. In contrast with the focus upon [[narrative]] in the [[Homer]]ic ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', the ''Catalogue'' was structured around a vast system of [[genealogy|genealogies]] stemming from these unions and, in [[Martin Litchfield West|M.L. West's]] appraisal, covered "the whole of the heroic age."<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=3}}; cf. {{harvtxt|Hunter|2005b}}.</ref> Through the course of the poem's five books, these family trees were embellished with stories involving many of their members, and so the poem amounted to a compendium of heroic mythology in much the same way that the Hesiodic ''[[Theogony]]'' presents a systematic account of the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek pantheon]] built upon divine genealogies.

Most scholars do not currently believe that the ''Catalogue'' should be considered the work of Hesiod, but questions about the poem's authenticity have not lessened its interest for the study of literary, social and historical topics. As a Hesiodic work that treats in depth the Homeric world of the heroes, the ''Catalogue'' offers a transition between the divine sphere of the ''Theogony'' and the terrestrial focus of the ''[[Works and Days]]'' by virtue of its subjects' status as [[demigod]]s. Given the poem's concentration upon heroines in addition to heroes, it provides evidence for the roles and perceptions of women in Greek literature and society during the period of its composition and popularity. Greek aristocratic communities, the ruling elite, traced their lineages back to the heroes of epic poetry; thus the ''Catalogue'', a veritable "map of the Hellenic world in genealogical terms," preserves much information about a complex system of kinship associations and hierarchies that continued to have political importance long after the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]].<ref>The ''Catalogue'' as "map" is from {{harvtxt|Hunter|2005b|p=1}}; for constructions of intra-Hellenic identities, see {{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=7<U+2013>11}}, {{harvtxt|Fowler|1998}}, {{harvtxt|Hunter|2005b|p=3}}.</ref> Many of the myths in the ''Catalogue'' are otherwise unattested, either entirely so or in the form narrated therein, and held a special fascination for poets and scholars from the late Archaic period through the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Greece|Roman]] eras.

Despite its popularity among the [[Ancient Greek literature#Hellenistic_poetry|Hellenistic literati]] and reading public of [[Roman Egypt]], the poem went out of circulation before it could pass into a medieval manuscript tradition and is preserved today by [[papyrus]] fragments and quotations in ancient authors. Still, the ''Catalogue'' is much better attested than most "lost" works, with some 1,300 whole or partial lines surviving: "between a third and a quarter of the original poem", by one estimate.<ref>{{harvtxt|Osborne|2005|p=6}}.</ref> The evidence for the poem's reconstruction<U+2014>not only elements of its content, but the distribution of that content within the ''Catalogue''<U+2014>is indeed extensive, but the fragmentary nature of this evidence leaves many unresolved complexities and has over the course of the past century led to several scholarly missteps.

==Title and the ''<U+0113>' hoi<U+0113>''-formula==
Ancient authors most commonly referred to the poem as the ''Catalogue of Women'', or simply the ''Catalogue'', but several alternate titles were also employed.<ref>For the ancient naming conventions, see {{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=1}} and {{harvtxt|Hirschberger|2004|pp=26<U+2013>30}}. The plural ''Catalogue<ins>s</ins> of Women'' also appears in [[Menander Rhetor]]; see {{harvtxt|Merkelbach|West|1967|p=2}}, while the corresponding shorthand ''Catalogues'' is slightly more common (e.g. [[Scholia|Schol.]] [[Apollonius of Rhodes|A.R.]] 3.1086 = {{ws|''Cat.'' [[:s:Catalogue of Women/fr. 2#Text|fr. 2]]}}); cf. {{Harvtxt|West|1985a|p=1 n. 1}}, and {{Harvtxt|Hirschberger|2004|p=26 n. 35}}.</ref> The tenth-century encyclopedia known as the ''[[Suda]]'' gives an expanded version, the ''Catalogue of Heroic Women'' ({{lang|grc|<U+0393><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+1FF6><U+03BD> <U+1F29><U+03C1><U+03C9><U+03CA><U+03BD><U+1FF6><U+03BD> <U+039A><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B3><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}), and another late source, the twelfth-century Byzantine poet and grammarian [[John Tzetzes]], prefers to call the poem the ''Heroic Genealogy'' ({{lang|grc|<U+1F29><U+03C1><U+03C9><U+03CA><U+03BA><U+1F74> <U+0393><U+03B5><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B1>}}).<ref>''Suda'' s.v.

[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] (on [[Vergil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' 7.268) calls the poem {{lang|grc|<U+03A0><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+1F76> <U+03B3><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+1FF6><U+03BD>}}, ''Concerning Women''.</ref> But the earliest and most popular alternate title was ''Ehoiai'' ({{lang|grc|<U+1F28><U+03BF><U+1FD6><U+03B1><U+03B9>}}), after the [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] [[Oral-formulaic composition|formula]] ''<U+0113>' hoi<U+0113>'' ({{lang|grc|<U+1F20>' <U+03BF><U+1F35><U+03B7>}}, {{IPA-el|<U+025B><U+02D0> ho<U+0237><U+0301>.<U+025B><U+02D0>|a}}), "or such as", which introduces new sections within the poem via the introduction of a heroine or heroines.<ref>The title ''Ehoiai'' is formed from the plural of the formula, {{lang|grc|<U+1F20>' <U+03BF><U+1F37><U+03B1><U+03B9>}} (''<U+0113>' hoiai''); cf.

As is reflected by its use as an alternate title, the ''<U+0113>' hoi<U+0113>''-formula was one of the poem's most recognizable features. It may have belonged originally to a genre of poetry that simply listed notable heroines,<ref>{{harvtxt|Rutherford|2000|pp=92<U+2013>3}}.</ref> but in the ''Catalogue'' the formula is used as a structuring tool that allows the poet to resume a broken branch of a family tree, or to jump horizontally across genealogies to a new figure and line of descent.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=35}}, {{harvtxt|Hirschberger|2004|pp=30<U+2013>1}}.</ref> A characteristic example is found in the introduction of the daughters of [[Porthaon]] at ''Cat''. {{abbr|fr.|fragment}} 26.5<U+2013>9:<ref group=lower-alpha name="edd">Unless noted otherwise, this article cites the ''Catalogue'' according to the text and numeration of the edition of record, that of [[Reinhold Merkelbach|Merkelbach]] ([[:de:Reinhold Merkelbach|de]]) and [[Martin Litchfield West|West]] (M<U+2013>W).

The preceding section of the poem had dealt at some length with the extended family of Porthaon's sister [[Demodice]], tracing her line down to the generation following the Trojan War. Here ''<U+0113>' hoiai'' (plural) is used to jump backwards in order to complete the account of the descendants of Porthaon and Demodice's father [[Agenor (son of Pleuron)|Agenor]] by covering the son's family. Elsewhere the formula is used in transitions to more distant branches. The [[Catalogue of Women#Mestra|Ehoie of Mestra]], for example, ultimately serves to reintroduce the family of [[Sisyphus]], Mestra's great-granduncle who hoped to win her as bride for his son [[Glaucus (son of Sisyphus)|Glaucus]]. Although that marriage does not take place, the descendants of Sisyphus are soon presented.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 43a; cf. {{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=64}}.</ref>

According to the ''Suda'', the ''Catalogue'' was five books long.<ref>''Suda'' s.v.

===Book 1===
The first is by far the best-attested book of the poem, with several extensive papyri overlapping ancient quotations or coinciding with paraphrases: at least 420 verses of [[dactylic hexameter]] survive in part or entire. One papyrus includes [[stichometry|line numbers]] which, taken together with the system of overlaps among the other sources, allows much of the book's content to be assigned approximate line numbers.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=72<U+2013>6}} provides an inductive survey of the evidence.</ref> Perhaps the most significant of these overlaps is between the papyrus containing the opening lines of the poem and the ''[[Theogony]]'': the ''Catalogue'' was styled as a continuation of the "canonical" Hesiodic poem, with the  final two verses of the ''Theogony'' standing as ''Catalogue of Women'' book 1, lines 1<U+2013>2.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lobel|1956|p=1}}.</ref> Toward the end of the ''Theogony'' as transmitted by the manuscript tradition, following Zeus's final ordering of Olympus and his siring several key deities, the poet invokes the [[Muse]]s to sing of the "tribe of goddesses&nbsp;... immortals who slept with mortal men, bearing children like gods."<ref>''Theogony'' 965<U+2013>8.</ref> After some 150 verses on this topic, the [[preface|proem]] to the ''Catalogue'' comes in the form of another re-invocation of the Muses to introduce a new, only slightly more terrestrial topic (''Cat''. fr. 1.1<U+2013>5):

====First families====
The repeated use of the introductory phrase "or such as&nbsp;..." implies an initial "such as&nbsp;...", and it is likely that this first woman treated was [[Pyrrha]], wife of [[Deucalion]].<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=50<U+2013>3, 56}}.</ref> There is some debate about whether the ''Catalogue'' included an account of the [[Flood myth]],<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=55<U+2013>6}} thinks that it did not; {{harvtxt|Hirschberger|2004|p=34 n. 89}} holds the opposite view.</ref> but the creation of a race of [[Leleges#Greece_and_the_Aegean|humans born from stones]] cast by Deucalion and Pyrrha does appear to have figured in the poem.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 234; cf. {{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=52}}.</ref> Zeus unsurprisingly had first pick from the catalogue of women, and sired [[Hellen]] by Pyrrha.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=50<U+2013>3, 56}}; cf. ''Cat''. frr. 3 and 9.</ref> Pyrrha also had three daughters by Deucalion: [[Thyia]], [[Protogeneia]] and [[Pandora II|Pandora]], who was named for her maternal grandmother, the famous [[Pandora]].<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=173}}.</ref> Like their mother, these three lay with Zeus, bearing sons from whom several early Greek tribes were said to descend. Thyia bore [[Magnes (mythology)|Magnes]] and [[Makedon (mythology)|Macedon]]; Protogeneia bore [[Aethlius]], the grandfather of [[Aetolus]]; and Pandora's son was [[Graecus]].<ref>Thyia: ''Cat''. fr. 7; Protogeneia: {{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=52}}; Pandora: ''Cat''. fr. 5.</ref>

But it was the family of Hellen, who would himself ultimately be the [[eponym]] for the entire Greek world, that had the greatest mythological significance. He sired [[Dorus]], [[Xuthus]] and [[Aeolus#Son of Hellen|Aeolus]], apparently by Othryis, the [[nymph]] of [[Mount Othrys]].<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=57}}.</ref> Dorus was the eponym of the [[Dorians]], and his son [[Aegimius]]' sons, [[Dymas]] and [[Pamphylus (mythology)|Pamphylus]], gave their names to two of the three Dorian tribes, the Dymanes and Pamphyli.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=57}}; cf. ''Cat''. fr. 10a.6<U+2013>7 OCT.</ref> The third division was called the Hylleis, after Heracles' son [[Hyllus]], with whom Pamphylus and Dymas migrated to the [[Peloponnese]].<ref>Cf. {{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=57}}, [[Tyrtaeus]] frr. 2.12<U+2013>15, 19.8.</ref> Xuthus married [[Erechtheus]]' daughter [[Creusa]] and was the father of [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] and [[Achaeus (son of Xuthus)|Achaeus]], along with a daughter named Diomede.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 10a.20<U+2013>4 OCT.</ref> The relation between the progenitors of Greek tribes among the descendents of Deucalion is outlined in the following table:

====Aeolids====
What was likely the largest unified stemma to be treated, the account of the descendents of Aeolus and [[Enarete|Aenarete]]'s five daughters and seven sons, stretched from before the 200th line of book 1 well into the second book.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=72<U+2013>6}}.</ref> The sons who were certainly found in the ''Catalogue'' are [[Cretheus]], [[Athamas]], [[Sisyphus]], [[Salmoneus]], [[Deioneus|Deion]] (or Deioneus) and [[Perieres]].<ref>''Cat''. fr. 10a.25<U+2013>8 OCT. For the form of [[Deioneus|Deion<U+2013>Deioneus]]' name, see {{harvtxt|West|1983}}.</ref> A seventh son's name is obscured in [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]]: he has been identified tentatively as [[Minyas (mythology)|Minyas]], [[Locrus]] or a second Magnes, not the eponym of the Magnetes, but the father of [[Dictys]] and [[Polydectes]] of the [[Dana<U+00EB>]]-[[Perseus]] myth.<ref>At ''Bibliotheca'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.7.3&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 1.7.3] the seventh son is named as Magnes and made father of Dictys and Polydectes at [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.9.6&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 1.9.6]; this latter detail matches a verse quotation of the ''Catalogue'': {{lang|grc|<U+039C><U+03AC><U+03B3><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C2> <U+03B4>' <U+03B1><U+1F56> <U+0394><U+03AF><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03C5><U+03BD> <U+03C4><U+03B5> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+1F76> <U+1F00><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03AF><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03BD> <U+03A0><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03C5><U+03AD><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03B1>}}, "Now, Magnes (sired) Dictys and godlike Polydectes" (fr. 8). {{harvtxt|Merkelbach|West|1967}} follow previous editors in identifying this Magnes with the eponym of the Magnetes.</ref> No similar doubt attends the identities of Aeolus' daughters: they were [[Pisidice|Peisidice]], [[Alcyone]], [[Calyce (mythology)|Calyce]], [[Canace]] and [[Perimede (mythology)|Perimede]].<ref>''Cat''. fr. 10a.33<U+2013>4 OCT.</ref> The families of the daughters were treated first, and much of the middle of book 1<U+2014>over 400 lines<U+2014>was devoted to recounting their descendents. Aeolus' extended family, via both sons and daughters, is notable for a concentration of fantastical narratives and folk elements of a sort largely absent from the Homeric poems, beginning with the doomed, hubristic love of [[Ceyx]] and Alcyone, who called one another "Zeus" and "Hera" and were turned into the kingfisher and halcyon as punishment (frr. 10a.83<U+2013>98, 10d OCT, 15).

Ater treating the [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] families of Peisidice and Canace, the poet turned to the intermingled [[Aetolia]]n-[[Elis|Elian]] lines of Calyce and Perimede. Perimede had earlier in the book borne two sons to the river [[Achelous]], one of whom was the grandfather of [[Oeneus]], [[Hippodamas]].<ref>''Cat''. fr. 10a.35<U+2013>57.</ref> To [[Aethlius]] Calyce bore [[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]], whose son [[Aetolus (son of Endymion)|Aetolus]] was the eponym of Aetolia and the great-grandfather of [[Demodice]] and [[Porthaon]], through whom the later Aetolian and Elian genealogies were traced. Somewhere within these families, [[Eurytus and Cteatus]] were found in a form more fearsome than they were in the ''Iliad'': in the ''Catalogue'' they were fierce [[conjoined twins]] with two heads, four arms and an equal number of legs.<ref>The birth of their mother, their birth and characteristics are reported in frr. 17<U+2013>18.</ref> Most significant for the epic tradition, however, was the marriage of Demodice's son [[Thestius]] and Porthaon's daughter Eurythemiste which produced the daughters [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], [[Althaea (mythology)|Althaea]] and [[Hypermnestra#Daughter of Thestius and Eurythemis|Hypermestra]]<!--This is the form used in the Catalogue-->, who are introduced in a group Ehoiai at fr. 23a.3<U+2013>5.

In West's opinion, the verdict forces Erysichthon to give him some goods as a penalty. {{harvtxt|Casanova|1977}} believes that Sisyphus had paid for Mestra, and that Erysichthon now demands a new deal: the judgement rules against Erysichthon; further conjectures are presented by {{harvtxt|Ormand|2004|pp=334<U+2013>6}}.</ref> but Sisyphus ultimately comes out on the losing end, for Mestra does not bear children to Glaucus.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 43a.51<U+2013>4.</ref> Instead Poseidon whisks her off to [[Kos]], where she bears [[Eurypylus#Son of Poseidon|Eurypylus]] to the god.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 43a.55<U+2013>9.</ref> Eurypylus' descendents rule the island, which is sacked by Heracles in a brief allusion to the great hero's adventures.

The Ehoie of Mestra closes with her returning to Athens to care for her father,<ref>''Cat''. fr. 43a.66<U+2013>9.</ref> but the poet's attention stays with Sisyphus, as he and his son are the male subjects of the Ehoie of [[Eurynome (daughter of Nisus)|Eurynome]] which immediately follows.

The gods again got in the way, though, and she bore [[Bellerophon]]tes to Poseidon, who gave his son the winged horse [[Pegasus]] with which Bellerophontes slew the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]].<ref>''Cat''. fr. 43a.81<U+2013>7.</ref>  In the ''Iliad'' this task was presented as the order of Proetus' father-in-law [[Iobates]],<ref>''Iliad'' 6.174<U+2013>83.</ref> and in the ''Catalogue'' it appears to be followed immediately by the marriage of Bellerophontes and a daughter of the Lycian king.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 43a.88<U+2013>91.</ref>

In the ''Catalogue'' and later mythographic tradition, the family of Belus' brother Agenor was something "like a repository for aliens and displaced persons."<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=152}}.</ref> His son [[Phoenix (son of Agenor)|Phoenix]] was the eponym of [[Phoenicia]], and if [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and [[Cadmus]] were also his sons, the Agenorids would have been present in [[Aethiopia]] and [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] as well.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=82<U+2013>3}}.</ref> By one [[Alphesiboea]] Phoenix sired [[Adonis]].<ref>''Cat''. fr. 139.</ref> [[Cassiopeia (mythology)#Wife of Phoenix|Cassiepeia]] bore to him [[Phineus]]; she was perhaps also the mother of Phoenix's daughter [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], but the girl's mother might have been [[Telephaassa]], as in [[Moschus]]' ''Europa''.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 138, 140; Moschus, ''Europa'' 40.

Europa's tale, well known in later classical literature and beyond, appears in a largely familiar form in the ''Catalogue''. She caught Zeus's eye while she and some friends were gathering flowers in a meadow.<ref name="Cat. fr. 140">''Cat''. fr. 140.</ref> The god transformed into a bull with breath smelling of saffron, in the guise of which he abducted Europa, carrying her upon his back to [[Crete]].<ref>''Cat''. frr. 140, 141.1<U+2013>2</ref> There she bore [[Minos]], [[Rhadamanthys]] and [[Sarpedon]] to Zeus, and he gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus that would figure in Theban saga as the [[Necklace of Harmonia]].<ref>''Cat''. frr. 140, 141.3<U+2013>14, 142.</ref> Sarpedon ruled [[Lycia]], and was apparently granted a lifespan equal to three generations of men by Zeus.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 141.20 app. crit. with Apld.

Phineus was even better-traveled than his sister Europa, and his biography in the ''Catalogue'' was  apparently a "''[[pi<U+00E8>ce de r<U+00E9>sistance]]''" meant to conclude the geographically diverse Inachid stemma with an appropriate flourish.<ref name="harvtxt|West|1985a|p=84"/> He ruled in [[Thrace]], but was kidnapped by the [[Harpies]].<ref>''Cat''. frr. 157, 151.</ref> Zetes and Calais, the [[Boreads]], pursued the tormentors and tormented to the ends of the earth.<ref>''Cat''. frr. 150<U+2013>6.</ref> The poet catalogued many far-flung and remarkable races encountered during the chase, including: the Katoudaioi ("Subterranean Men"), [[Pygmy (Greek mythology)|Pygmies]], Melanes ("Black Men"), [[Aethiopia]]ns, [[Libya]]ns, "horse-milking" [[Scythians]], Hemikynes ("Half-Dogs") and the [[Macrocephali|Makrokephaloi]], as well as [[griffins]].<ref>''Cat''. frr. 150<U+2013>3.</ref> [[Ephorus]] called the episode the ''G<U+00EA>s Per<U+00ED>odos'' ({{lang|grc|<U+0393><U+1FC6><U+03C2> <U+03A0><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}, "Journey Around the World"), and it was once thought that this title referred to an independent work, one erroneously attributed to Hesiod.<ref>Ephorus = ''Cat''. fr. 151. {{harvtxt|Marcksheffel|1840|pp=197<U+2013>8}} gives the background of the debate, but correctly concluded that the ''G<U+00EA>s Per<U+00ED>odos'' was part of the ''Catalogue''.</ref> This view was disproved conclusively in 1911 with the publication of an extensive papyrus fragment (''pictured'') of the episode which derived from the same bookroll that contained the myth of Europa described above.

====Arcadia====
It is likely that the section describing the [[Arcadian]] descendants of [[Pelasgus]] and [[Arcas]] followed that of the Inachids.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=90<U+2013>1}}.</ref> Pelasgus was [[autochthon (person)|autochthon]]ous; he sired [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]] either by the [[Oceanid]] Meliboea or by Cyllene, the [[oread]] of an [[Mount Kyllini|Arcadian mountain]] which still bears her name.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 160 (with the app. crit. citing Apld.

====Atlantids====
In the ''Bibliotheca'', the Arcadian genealogies are immediately followed by the Atlantids, and this progression is known to mirror the structure of the ''Catalogue'' because other fragments of the papyrus roll that transmits the Telephus myth cover families of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]' daughters: [[Taygete]], [[Electra (Pleiad)|Electra]], [[Alcyone (Pleiades)|Alcyone]], [[Sterope (Pleiad)|Sterope]], [[Celaeno]], [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] and [[Merope (Pleiades)|Merope]]. Maia bore Hermes to Zeus on Mount Cyllene.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 170*</ref> Taygete also slept with Zeus, becoming the mother of [[Lacedaemon (mythology)|Lacedaemon]], through whom much of the Spartan line was traced, including [[Tyndareos]], the father of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], and [[Penelope]], the wife of [[Odysseus]].<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=180}}.</ref> To Zeus yet again Electra bore [[Dardanus]], the progenitor of the Trojan line, and [[Eetion]], who was killed for sleeping with [[Demeter]].<ref>''Cat''. fr. 177.5<U+2013>12.</ref> Dardanus' sons were [[Erichthonius of Dardania|Erichthonius]] and [[Ilus]].<ref>''Cat''. fr. 177.13<U+2013>15.</ref> [[Hyrieus]] and Hyperes were Poseidon's children by Alcyone. Her section included the Ehoie of Hyrieus' daughter [[Antiope (mother of Amphion)|Antiope]], who bore [[Amphion and Zethus]] to Zeus.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 181; cf. {{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=97<U+2013>9}}.</ref> Hyperes' daughter Arethusa slept with Poseidon and was changed to a spring in [[Euboea]], but not before bearing [[Abas (mythology)|Abas]], the eponym of the [[Abantes]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Renner|1977|pp=287<U+2013>9}}.</ref> His line is traced down to [[Elephenor]], leader of the Abantes in the Trojan War.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 244*, {{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=99}}.</ref> Sterope lay with Ares and bore [[Oenomaus]], but it is possible that this union was delayed to book four as part of the section treating the family of [[Pelops]] and Oenomaus' daughter [[Hippodamia|Hippodameia]].<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=99}}.</ref>

===Book 4===
Before the papyri began to accrue, the longest extant passage of the ''Catalogue'' was known from the ''[[Shield of Heracles]]'', the first 56 lines of which were borrowed from book 4 according to an ancient hypothesis to the ''Shield''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Merkelbach|West|1967|p=93, fr. 195 app. crit.}} The statement of the scholia was confirmed by the publication of P.Oxy. XXIII 2355, which contains the verses preceding the section borrowed by the poet of the ''Shield''; cf. {{harvtxt|Lobel|1956|p=3}}.</ref> This passage, the Ehoie of [[Alcmene]], recounts how she went  to Thebes with her husband [[Amphitryon]], who could not consummate the marriage until he had avenged the deaths of her brothers at the hands of the [[Taphians]] and [[Teleboans]].<ref>''Cat''. fr. 195 (''Sc''.) 14<U+2013>19.</ref> As Amphitryon returned having accomplished this feat, Zeus lay with Alcmene; upon his return that very night, so too did Amphitryon.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 195 (''Sc''.) 27<U+2013>37.</ref> To the god Alcmene bore [[Heracles]] and to the hero she bore [[Iphicles]].<ref>''Cat''. fr. 195 (''Sc''.) 51<U+2013>6.</ref>

Alcmene belongs to the Pelopid line<U+2014>her mother [[Lysidice (daughter of Pelops and Hippodamia)|Lysidice]] was a daughter of Pelops and Hippodameia<U+2014>, and the passages preceding her Ehoie also concern Pelopids. Three of Pelops' daughters married sons of Perseus: Lysidice married [[Electryon]], [[Nicippe]] wed [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], and [[Astydameia#Daughter of Pelops|Astydameia]] wed [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]].<ref>''Cat''. frr. 190, 193; {{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=110}}.</ref> Nicippe and Sthenelus' daughter [[Astymedusa]] married [[Oedipus]], and at the funeral games in his honor his son [[Polynices]] caught the eye of his future wife [[Argeia]], the daughter of [[Adrastus]].<ref>''Cat''. fr. 193 (with app. crit.); {{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=111}}.</ref> Pelops' son [[Atreus]] was the father of [[Pleisthenes#Son of Atreus|Pleisthenes]] who, contrary to the better known genealogy, was the father of [[Agamemnon]] and [[Menelaus]].<ref>''Cat''. fr. 194, {{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=110}}.</ref> Their mother was [[Aerope]], the daughter of [[Catreus]], and their births were reported in the verses directly preceding the Ehoie of Alcmene.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 195.1<U+2013>7.</ref>

Besides the Pelopid line, and whatever remained of the Atlantid stemmata among which it ultimately belongs, little is known for certain about the further content of book 4.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hirschberger|2004|p=41}}, in her survey of the conclusive evidence for each book's content, lists no evidence for book 4 other than the Alcmene-Ehoie's attribution.</ref> It is possible that an Athenian section including the various autochthonous kings of Athens and the daughters of [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]] was found here.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=103<U+2013>9}}.</ref> A family springing from the river [[Asopus#Boeotian Asopus|Asopus]] has also been proposed for this region based on the presence of "several persons or families that other sources represent as descended from daughters of Asopos."<ref>{{harvtxt|1985a|p=100}}.</ref> The most notable family that would belong to this section is that of Asopus' daughter [[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]], the nymph of the [[Aegina|island that bears her name]] who slept with Zeus and bore [[Aeacus]].<ref name="Cat. fr. 205">''Cat''. fr. 205.</ref> Fearing that Aeacus would be lonely on his island, Zeus changed all of Aegina's ants into men, spawning the tribe of [[Myrmidons]], a play upon their name and the Greek word for "ant", {{lang|grc|<U+03BC><U+03CD><U+03C1><U+03BC><U+03B7><U+03BE>}}, ''m<U+00FD>rm<U+0113>x''.<ref name="Cat. fr. 205"/> This is the family to which [[Achilles]] belongs, the most notable hero in the Trojan saga, as well as his father [[Peleus]] and uncles [[Telamon]] and [[Menoetius (mythology)|Menoetius]].<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=111, 181}}.</ref>

===Book 5===
[[File:P.Berol. inv. 9739 col. iv-v.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|alt=Papyrus|Portions of the Catalogue of Suitors ( ''Cat''. frr. 199<U+2013>200 = P.Berol. inv. 9739 col. iv&ndash;v, 2nd c. AD)]]
The final book was different in that it apparently left behind the genealogical structure of the first four books. Book five opened with a nearly 200-line catalogue of the suitors of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], similar in style to the [[Catalogue of Ships]] in ''[[Iliad]]'' book 2.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cingano|2005|p=119}}. The length and placement of the Catalogue of Suitors is known from a [[beta]] to the left of fr. 204.94 marking that verse as the 200th line of its book; cf. {{harvtxt|Schwartz|1960|p=416}}, {{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=114<U+2013>17}}.</ref>  Although it is likely that the entire catalogue included twenty-five to thirty suitors,<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=117}}.</ref> only twelve are attested by name. From Argos [[Amphilochus (brother of Alcmaeon)|Amphilochus]] and [[Alcmaeon (mythology)|Alcmaeon]], the sons of [[Amphiaraus]], attempted to win Helen, but were perhaps never able to join in the contest because of their punishment for the matricide of [[Eriphyle]].<ref>''Cat''. fr. 196.6<U+2013>9. The text is unclear, but their absence from the war at Troy and the presence of the word "but" as the text breaks off imply that they were never bound by the oath of Tyndareus ({{harvtxt|Cingano|2005|pp=140<U+2013>1}}).</ref> Ever shrewd, [[Odysseus]] did not give gifts but simply sent envoys to Castor and Polydeuces, because he knew that Menelaus would ultimately prevail.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 198.2<U+2013>8.</ref> [[Thoas]] was not so wise and gave many sheep and cows in the hope of winning Helen.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 198.9<U+2013>12.</ref> From [[Phylace (Magnesia)|Phylace]], many gifts were given by [[Podarces]] and [[Protesilaus]], who were cousins in the ''Catalogue'', not brothers as in the Catalogue of Ships.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 199.4<U+2013>12; cf. ''Iliad'' 2.704<U+2013>6 with {{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=68 n. 87}}.</ref> Athenian [[Menestheus]] gave many gold cauldrons and tripods, confident that he was the wealthiest of all the heroes.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 200.3<U+2013>9.</ref> [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]] wooed Helen from [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], promising to pillage the surrounding lands and give their possession as part of his gift.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 204.44<U+2013>51, {{harvtxt|Cingano|2005|pp=144<U+2013>9}}. {{harvtxt|Finkelberg|1988}} believes that Ajax actually ruled these surrounding countries in the ''Catalogue''.</ref> [[Idomeneus]] made the long journey from [[Crete]] himself, aware of Helen's beauty only from secondhand accounts.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 204.56<U+2013>63. Another Cretan, Lycomedes, wooed as well (''Cat''. fr. 202). {{harvtxt|Hirschberger|2004|p=412, on her fr. 110.65}} identifies this Lycomedes with the "son of Creon" at ''Iliad'' 9.84.</ref> 

Before giving his decision, Tyndareus bound all the suitors to his fateful oath: should anyone ever take his daughter by force, all those who had wooed her must exact vengeance upon her abductor. To this all the suitors readily agreed, each believing that he would be given Helen's hand.<ref>''Cat'' fr. 204.78<U+2013>85.</ref> At this point the Catalogue of Suitors has come to a close, but even as Menelaus' success is reported, the poet introduces [[Achilles]] because of his status as the greatest hero of the Trojan saga and his central role in Zeus's plan to bring the Heroic Age to a close.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cingano|2005|p=129}}.</ref> With the aid of Agamemnon, Menelaus had given the most bride prices, but were Achilles already of age, he would surely have won Helen's hand, "for neither warlike Menelaus nor any other human on earth would have defeated him".<ref>''Cat''. fr. 204.89<U+2013>92, trans. {{harvtxt|Most|2007|p=233, his fr. 155}}.</ref> But Achilles was not present, and Menelaus won Helen, who bore [[Hermione (mythology)|Hermione]] to him.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 204.94<U+2013>5.</ref>

====The end of the Heroic Age====
The marriage of Helen and Menelaus precipitates the Trojan War, the event that ultimately brings the heroic age to an end, but the circumstances surrounding this transition in the ''Catalogue'' are unclear. Directly following the birth of Hermione strife arises among the gods, and Zeus hatches a plan to stir up trouble among mankind.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 204.95ff.</ref> The exact meaning of this plan is obscure because of deficiencies in the text, and several interpretations have been proposed, the most commonly accepted being that Zeus plans to destroy a great number of men by causing the war, ultimately removing the heroes to a life lived in conditions resembling the Golden Age.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=119}}</ref> Another possibility is that Zeus intends to destroy the race of heroes and return the world to its former order, when gods slept with each other, not mortals.<Ref>{{harvtxt|Clay|2005|pp=29<U+2013>31}} and {{harvtxt|Gonzalez|2010}}.</ref> In any event, a great change is coming, and as the final placed fragment of the ''Catalogue'' breaks off, several enigmatic scenes are sketched. A great storm arises which dwindles the strength of mankind:<ref>''Cat''. fr. 204.124<U+2013>30; the text is that of {{harvtxt|Hirschberger|2004}} fr. 110, incorporating the emendations of {{harvtxt|Beck|1980}}.</ref>

These lines, described by West as "the finest passage of poetry yet known from the ''Catalogue''",<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1961|p=133}}.</ref> might parallel [[Calchas]]' prophecy in ''Iliad'' 2, which presages the first nine fruitless years of the Trojan War via the image of a snake devouring nine sparrows.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clay|2005|pp=33<U+2013>4}}; cf, ''Iliad'' 2.308<U+2013>20.</ref> Here the "hairless one," a kenning for a snake, gives birth to what appears to be the first of three sets of triplets, and as the remains of the papyrus become more meager, the snake sloughs its skin, representing the regeneration that will come once the heroic age comes to an end and the world is given over to mortals.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clay|2005|pp=33<U+2013>4}}; cf. {{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=120}}.</ref>

===Notable unplaced and disputed fragments===
Many fragments that are securely attributed to the ''Catalogue'', some of which are relatively substantial, cannot be placed within the poem because their content is either too obscure or could be assigned to different individuals or genealogies which are themselves difficult to locate within the five books.<ref>These are ''Cat''. frr. 205<U+2013>245. In {{harvtxt|West|1985a}}, {{harvtxt|Hirschberger|2004}} and {{harvtxt|Most|2007}} are offered tentative assignments for many fragments unplaced in {{harvtxt|Merkelbach|West|1967}}. There are also a handful of papyrus fragments which derive from the same rolls as securely interpreted fragments, but are so miniscule that their interpretation will be all but impossible until other papyri are found to overlap them. ''Cat.'' frr. 79<U+2013>86 and 88<U+2013>120 all appear to belong to rolls which preserve the first two books, but many are so small that even the identification of their sources is obscure; cf. {{harvtxt|Merkelbach|West|1967|p=v}}.</ref>

====Cyrene====
The place of [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]] within the poem has implications beyond the level of content, for if her narrative is to be connected to the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in Libya, the ''[[terminus post quem]]'' for the composition of the ''Catalogue'' would be 631 BC, the approximate year of that city's foundation.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=132}}.</ref> Pindar, ''Pythian'' 9 tells how Apollo saw Cyrene hunting in her native [[Thessaly]] and was immediately enamoured of the [[tomboy]]. The god goes to the cave of the wise [[centaur]] Chiron and asks who she is and whether it would be wise to consort with her. Chiron then prophesies that it is fated for Cyrene and Apollo to mate, and that he will bring her across the sea to Libya, where she will be queen of a portion of the land and bear to him a son, [[Aristaeus]]. A [[scholia|scholium]] on the ode states that "Pindar took the story from an Ehoie of Hesiod's" ({{lang|grc|<U+1F00><U+03C0><U+1F78> <U+03B4><U+1F72> <U+1F28><U+03BF><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03C2>

[[Richard Janko]], who believes that the ''Catalogue'' was composed c. 690, argues that the extent to which Pindar relied upon the Hesiodic text is unknown and that, even if Apollo did carry Cyrene to Libya, this does not presuppose an aetiology of the city.<ref>{{harvtxt|Janko|1982|p=248 n. 38}}; the table outlining his dating is found on page 200. For the position that Thessalian Cyrene does not presuppose the city of the same name, cf. {{harvtxt|Dr<U+00E4>ger|1993|pp=221<U+2013>9}}.</ref> Others have argued that the citation is also vague regarding just which Hesiodic poem included the Cyrene-Ehoie, the ''Catalogue'' or the ''Megalai Ehoiai'': the latter might have included a narrative similar to Pindar's, with the former presenting a different version of the myth, if indeed the ''Catalogue'' treated Cyrene at all.<ref>{{harvtxt|D'Alessio|2005a|pp=206<U+2013>7}}; cf. {{harvtxt|Cohen|1986|p=34}}.</ref> The complete removal of Cyrene would not, however, be easily accommodated by related evidence<U+2014>it would presumably also involve transferring two fragments concerning Aristaeus which have traditionally been attributed to the ''Catalogue'', and his son [[Actaeon]] certainly appeared in the poem.<ref>The Aristaeus fragments are 215 and 216, neither of which are explicitly assigned to the ''Catalogue'' by the testimonia; cf. {{harvtxt|D'Alessio|2005a|p=207}} who notes that Cyrene is the only known mother of Aristaeus.</ref>

====Actaeon====
The myth of Actaeon is known to have been narrated in the ''Catalogue'' by virtue of a paraphrase found in a fragmentary dictionary of metamorphoses.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 217A OCT, first edited by {{harvtxt|Renner|1978}}. Before the publication of the dictionary, some version of the myth appeared to be attributed to the ''Cat''. (called the ''Ehoiai'') by [[Philodemus]] (''On Piety'' B 6552<U+2013>55 [[Dirk Obbink|Obbink]]), but, because of great damage to that text, Merkelbach and West printed it as a doubtful fragment (fr. 346); the Philodemus fragment contains very little more than the name Actaeon and the citation.</ref> According to the dictionary, the ''Catalogue'' included a variant of the myth in which Actaeon was changed into a stag by Artemis and then killed by his own hounds because he attempted to take [[Semele]] as his wife, thus angering Zeus, who had designs upon the woman.<ref>The role of Zeus in the myth is not made explicit (or, at least, does not survive) in the papyri, but has been assumed by scholars; cf. {{harvtxt|Renner|1978|p=283}}, {{harvtxt|Hirschbeger|2004|p=394}}.</ref> Before this testimonium appeared, another papyrus containing 21 hexameters related to the Actaeon myth was published by [[Edgar Lobel]], who tentatively attributed the text to the ''Catalogue''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lobel|1964|pp=4<U+2013>7}}. This is P.Oxy. XXX 2509, printed as ''Cat''. fr. 103 in {{harvtxt|Hirschberger|2004}} and fr. 162 in {{harvtxt|Most|2007}}.</ref> As the fragment opens, Actaeon has already been torn apart by his dogs, and a goddess<U+2014>Athena or, less likely, Artemis<ref group=lower-alpha>The general consensus is that this is Athena because she occasionally acts as Zeus's courier and because the goddess is referred to as the "daughter of great aegis-bearing Zeus" ({{lang|grc|<U+03B1><U+1F30><U+03B3><U+03B9><U+03CC><U+03C7><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03BF> <U+0394><U+03B9><U+1F78><U+03C2> <U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03C1><U+03B7> <U+03BC><U+03B5><U+03B3><U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03BF>}}, ''aigiokhoio Dios kour<U+0113> megaloio''), one of Athena's common appellations; cf. {{harvtxt|Lobel|1964|p=6}}, {{harvtxt|Janko|1984|p=302}}, {{harvtxt|DePew|1994|pp=413<U+2013>15}}. {{harvtxt|Casanova|1969a|pp=33<U+2013>4}}, argues that similar epithets are also applied to Artemis, and that her central role in the myth and status as the goddess of both the hunt and the taming of animals would make her a deity more likely to cure the hunting dogs of their madness in line 15.</ref><U+2014>arrives at [[Chiron]]'s cave. She prophesies to the centaur that Dionysus will be born to Semele and that Actaeon's dogs will roam the hills with him until his apotheosis, after which they will return to stay with Chiron. At this point the papyrus is damaged, but it is clear that the dogs are delivered from a "madness" ({{lang|grc|<U+03BB><U+03CD><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03B1>}}, ''[[Lyssa|lussa]]'', line 15) and begin to mourn their master as the goddess returns to Olympus. Merkelbach and West did not include this papyrus in their edition of the fragment, the latter calling it an "incoherent epic pastiche" which would cause the author of the ''Catalogue'' to "turn in his grave if he knew that it had been attributed to him."<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1965|p=22}}. Twenty years later, West was "still loth to believe" the fragment was Hesiodic ({{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=88}}).

After relating the motivation for Actaeon's death which was found in the ''Catalogue'' (but attributing it to [[Acusilaus]]), Apld. reports the better-known version, in which the transformation and death are punishment for Actaeon's having seen Artemis bathing. He continues to say that Artemis transformed him into a stag and drove the dogs into a "madness" ({{lang|grc|<U+03BB><U+03CD><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03B1>}}, cf. P.Oxy. 2509.15) so that they wouldn't recognize their master as they devoured him. Distraught, they then went in search of Actaeon, before coming back to the cave of Chiron, who made an image of the dead man so as to cease their grief. Following this paraphrase are the ten verses interpolated into the text of the ''Bibliotheca'' ({{harvtxt|Janko|1984|p=305}}) which name some of the hounds and describe their rending of Actaeon. {{harvtxt|Malten|1911|pp=20<U+2013>3}} and {{harvtxt|Casanova|1969a}} believe that these lines also derive from the ''Catalogue'', but many consider them Hellenistic (e.g. {{harvtxt|Powell|1925}}), and none of the recent editions include them; cf. {{harvtxt|Janko|1984|pp=305<U+2013>7}}.</ref>

==Date, composition and authorship==
During antiquity the ''Catalogue'' was almost universally considered the work of Hesiod.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=127}}, {{harvtxt|Hirschberger|2004|p=42}}, {{harvtxt|Cingano|2009|p=105}}.</ref> [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] reports, however, that the [[Boeotia]]ns living around [[Mount Helicon]] during his day believed that the only genuine Hesiodic poem was the ''Works and Days'' and that even the first 10 lines of that poem (the so-called "hymn to Zeus") were spurious.<ref>Paus. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.31.4 9.31.4].</ref> The only other surviving expression of doubt is found in [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], who cites "Hesiod" for the number of [[Niobe]]'s children, but qualifies his citation with "unless these verses are not by Hesiod, but have been passed off falsely as his, like many other passages."<ref>Ael. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/aelian/varhist12.xhtml#chap36 ''VA'' 12.36] = ''Cat''. fr. 183; the translation given above is that of {{harvtxt|Most|2007|p=195, his fr. 127}}.</ref> But Aelian's skepticism could have stemmed from the still common belief that Hesiodic poetry suffered from [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]],<ref>Cf. {{harvtxt|Solmsen|1982}}, [[#{{harvid|Wilamowitz-Moellendorf|1905|pp=123<U+2013>4}}|Wilamowitz (1905]], pp. 123<U+2013>4).

[[File:seneca.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Sculpture bust|A [[Pseudo-Seneca|Roman-era sculpture]] possibly representing Hesiod, believed by ancient readers to be the author of the ''Catalogue of Women'']]
Modern scholars have not shared the confidence of their Hellenistic counterparts, and today the ''Catalogue'' is generally considered to be a post-Hesiodic composition. Since Hesiod is supposed to have lived around the turn of the 7th century, the [[Catalogue of Women#Cyrene|Cyrene-Ehoie]] alone could guarantee that the poem was not his.<ref>For Hesiod's ''[[floruit]]'' as c. 730<U+2013>690, see {{harvtxt|West|1966a|pp=43<U+2013>6}}.</ref>
Richard Janko's survey of epic language suggests that the ''Catalogue'' is very early, perhaps contemporary with Hesiod's ''Theogony''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Janko|1982|pp=85<U+2013>7}}. Janko's findings in fact suggest that the language of the ''Catalogue'' is more archaic than that of the ''Theogony'', but the nature of his study does not provide an exact chronology, especially in the case of closely related compositions.<!--In the Theogony Hesiod had a genealogical line to follow which was itself a sort of narrative thread; in the Catalogue of women he (or whoever was its author) simply added one story to another. ... Such a poem needed no structure and could obviously go on as long as anyone wanted to hear it; the episodes could be arranged in any order.--></ref>

Martin West argues on poetic, linguistic, cultural and political grounds that an Athenian poet "compiled the ''Catalogue of Women'' and attached it to Hesiod's ''Theogony'', as if it were all Hesiodic," sometime between 580 and 520, and thinks it possible that this range might be narrowed to the period following 540.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1999|p=380}}; cf. {{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=136<U+2013>7}}.</ref> He sees, for example, the marriage of Xuthus to a daughter of Erechtheus as a means of subordinating all of Ionia to Athens, since their union produced the eponym Ion.<ref>''Cat''. fr. 10a.20<U+2013>4 OCT, {{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=57<U+2013>8, 106}}; cf the [[#stemma|table above]].</ref> Similarly, [[Sicyon (mythology)|Sicyon]] is made a son of Erechtheus (fr. 224), which West takes as a reflection of the tyrant [[Cleisthenes of Sicyon]]'s attempts to promote Ionian<U+2013>Athenian interests in the polis, which had traditionally been more closely connected to Dorian Argos.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=133}}. {{harvtxt|Schwartz|1960|pp=488<U+2013>9}}, even posits a connection between the Catalogue of Helen's Suitors and the competition for the hand of Cleisthenes' daughter [[Agariste of Sicyon|Agariste]].</ref> These and other considerations would, in West's view, establish a ''[[terminus post quem]]'' of {{circa|575}}, but he prefers a later dating on the assumption that ''Theogony'' 965<U+2013>1020, which he assigns to the latter portion of the 6th century,<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=130}}, citing himself: {{harvtxt|West|1966a|pp=417, 430, 436}}</ref> was contemporaneous with the composition of the ''Catalogue''.<ref>Proposed at {{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=136}}, {{harvtxt|West|1999|p=380}}.</ref>

West's arguments have been highly influential,<ref>It is considered persuasive, if not certain, by (e.g.) {{harvtxt|Davies|1988}} and {{harvtxt|Rutherford|2005}}.</ref> but other scholars have arrived at different conclusions using the same evidence. Fowler thinks that the Sicyon genealogy would more likely reflect a composition before Cleisthenes' death c.&nbsp;575) and dates the poem to the period closely following the [[First Sacred War]], connecting its content to the growing influence of the [[Amphictyonic League]] and placing its author in [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] [[Thessaly]] because of the Aeolid family-trees centered around that region which dominate the earlier portions of the poem.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fowler|1999}}.</ref> Hirschberger, on the other hand, takes this focus upon the Aeolids and the ''Catalogue'' poet's perceived interest in eastern peoples to be indicative of a poet from [[Aeolis]] in Asia Minor, and proposes that the ''Catalogue'' was composed there between 630 and 590, viewing an apparent allusion to the poem by [[Stesichorus]] (died c.&nbsp;555) as the ultimate ''[[terminus ante quem]]''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hirschberger|2004|pp=48<U+2013>51}}. {{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=133<U+2013>4}}, does not believe that Stesichorus actually alluded to the ''Catalogue'', but that he alluded to another epic (or epic tradition) which paralleled the content of the Hesiodic poem; the authors who report that Stesichorus engaged with "Hesiod" on these point engaged in inference, according to West. Viewing the ''Catalogue'' as a product of a period when writing had already become a widely employed medium, {{harvtxt|Nasta|2006}} also considers the late 7th or early 6th c. to be the likeliest period of composition.</ref> Other dates have been proposed: Jacques Schwartz thought that the poem reached its final form between 506 and 476.

==Reception==
The ''Catalogue''{{'}}s greatest influence was felt during the [[Hellenistic period]], when the poem was used as an extra-Homeric touchstone for the poets of the era who favored recondite and antiquarian references over direct engagement with the more prominent members of the canon.<ref>See, for example, {{harvtxt|Hunter|2005c}}, {{harvtxt|Asquith|2005}} and the allusions to the poem collected in {{harvtxt|West|1969}} and {{harvtxt|West|1986}}.</ref> The most famous Hellenistic allusion to the ''Catalogue'' is found in [[Hermesianax]]'s ''Leontion'', which included a catalogue of great literary figures and their loves, beginning with [[Orpheus]] and Agriope (more commonly known as [[Eurydice]]) and proceeding down to the poet's contemporaries, including his teacher [[Philitas of Cos]]. Many of the entries engage playfully with their subjects' work: Homer, for example, is portrayed as pining for [[Penelope]]. Directly preceding that lovestruck bard comes Hesiod's blurb:<ref>''Leontion'' fr. 7.21<U+2013>26 [[#{{harvid|Powell|1925}}|Powell]]=3 [[#{{harvid|Lightfoot|2009}}|Lightfoot]].

At Rome the poets of the [[Roman Republic|Late Republic]] and [[Augustan literature|Augustan age]] continued the Hellenistic period's allusive engagement with the ''Catalogue''. [[Catullus]], a poet who made plain his Callimachean affiliations, is the earliest Roman author who can be seen to engage with the ''Catalogue''.<ref>In addition to Catullus' translating a section the ''Aetia'' (''Carm''. 66, the "Coma Berenices"), in ''Carm''. 116 he mentions a desire to send an erstwhile friend the poems of Callimachus in order to soften his attitude toward Catullus (''Saepe tibi studioso animo verba ante requirens'' | ''carmina uti possem vertere Battiadae,'' | ''qui te lenirem nobis, neu conarere'' | ''tela infesta meum mittere in usque caput'', 116.1<U+2013>4). On Catullus and Alexandrianism, see, conveniently, {{harvtxt|Clausen|1982}}.</ref> In his [[Catullus 64|epyllion on the wedding of Peleus and Thetis]], Catullus alludes to the [[theoxeny]] that the proem to the ''Catalogue'' presented as a defining characteristic of the heroic age and to the [[epithalamium]] of the couple that was sung in a later book.<ref>{{harvtxt|Pontani|2000}}.</ref> In the ''[[Aeneid]]'' [[Vergil]] closes his catalogue of combatants with the swift female warrior [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]], alluding to the Hesiodic account of Iphiclus' speed in "a remarkably subtle nod to tradition in the best Alexandrian style."<ref>{{harvtxt|Weiden Boyd|1992|pp=231<U+2013>3}}.</ref> [[Ovid]] picked up on Vergil's allusion in the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' with his treatment of [[Atalanta]], which recast's his Roman forbearer's allusion to Iphiclus in such a way that it highlights the Hesiodic character of his own poem in contrast with the Homeric character of the ''Aeneid''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ziogas|2011}}.</ref>

==Transmission and reconstruction==
It is impossible to tell exactly when the last complete copy of the ''Catalogue'' was lost. Fragments of over fifty ancient copies have been found, dating from the Hellenistic period through early Byzantine times.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=1}}. The earliest papyrus is P.Lit.Lond. 32 (''Cat''. fr. 73), which dates to the early 3rd c. BC; the latest is P.Berol. inv. 9777 (frr. 25 & 26), which is assigned to the 4th c. AD.</ref> A book label from the century or so after the latest ''Catalogue'' papyrus lists the contents of a 5th- or 6th-century Hesiodic [[codex]] as "Hesiod's ''Theogony'', ''Works and Days'' and ''Shield''", and it appears that by this time the Byzantine triad of Hesiod's works had become the notional corpus, to the detriment of the other poems which had traveled under the poet's name.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1966a|pp=51<U+2013>2}}; the ''syllabos'' belongs to P. Achm<U+00EE>n 3.</ref> Knowledge of the ''Catalogue'' did not cease altogether with the loss of the final complete copy, however, and well into medieval times authors such as [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] and [[Tzetzes]] could cite the poem via fragments contained in other ancient authors. Other vestiges of the poem's influence are less clear: the Pseudo-Apollodoran ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', an early Roman-era handbook of Greek mythology, for example, is widely believed to have taken the ''Catalogue'' as its primary structural model, although this is not stated explicitly within that text.<ref>Cf. {{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=32, 35, 43<U+2013>6}}. The validity of this view has occasionally been questioned (e.g. {{harvtxt|Heilinger|1983}}).</ref>
[[File:Daniel Heinsius.JPG|thumb|225px|upright|alt=Drawing|Daniel Heinsius, editor of the first modern collection of the Hesiodic fragments]]
The collection and interpretation of the Hesiodic fragments in the modern era began during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, primarily with the editions of {{harvtxt|Heinsius|1603}} and {{harvtxt|Graevius|1667}}. The earliest collections simply presented ancient quotations organized by the quoting author, and it was not until the work of {{harvtxt|Lehmann|1828}}, {{harvtxt|Goettling|1831}} and {{harvtxt|Marckscheffel|1840}} that attempts at a proper reconstruction began.<ref>The following survey owes much to {{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=31<U+2013>50}}, who, however, passes over the contributions of Lehmann and Goettling in silence.</ref> Marckscheffel was the first to recognize that the early portions of the poem treated the descendants of Deucalion in a systematic fashion, but he regarded what were called the "''Catalogue of Women''" and "''Ehoiai''" as two initially separate works that had been joined: the former was genealogically structured, while the latter, in Marckscheffel's view, simply recounted myths involving notable Thessalian and Boeotian heroines, with each introduced by the ''<U+0113>' hoi<U+0113>''-formula.<ref name=West31>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=31}}.</ref> Since the Ehoie of Alcmene was attested for book 4, Marckscheffel proposed that books 1<U+2013>3 were the "''Catalogue''", and books 4 and 5 were the "''Ehoiai''".<ref name=West31 />

As the 19th century progressed, there were several other important observations about the genealogical structure of the ''Catalogue''. In 1860 [[Adolf Kirchhoff]] noted the mass of information connected to the family of Io, a stemma which could be assigned to the third book because of an ancient citation placing Phineus, one of her descendents, there.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kirchhoff|1860}}.</ref> The picture of the ''Catalogue'' that was emerging began to resemble the ''Bibliotheca'' in structure, but [[Theodor Bergk]] was the first to suggest explicitly (though in passing) that the poem might be reconstructed with the help of the mythographic work.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bergk|1872|p=1002 n. 83}}.</ref> Bergk and his contemporaries still largely followed Marckscheffel's conclusion that the ''Catalogue'' and ''Ehoiai'' were semi-distinct texts, and it was not until 1894 that [[Friedrich Leo]] finally demonstrated that these were in fact alternate titles for a single poem.<ref>{{harvtxt|Leo|1894}}.</ref>

A few years before Leo's paper, the first small papyrus fragment was found, and the first half of the 20th century would see the publication of several other pieces which added significantly to the modern text of the ''Catalogue''.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=33}}, where a list of the papyri published before 1962 can be found in n. 10. The first papyrus published was the Atalanta fragment pictured [[Catalogue of Women#Book 3|above]].</ref> Among these finds were important passages, the Catalogue of Suitors and Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis for example, but few advanced the modern understanding of the work's overall structure.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=33}}.</ref> The appearance of the proem in 1956 actually led to a major misapprehension, for the list of gods found therein, beginning with Zeus and proceeding through the divine Heracles, led some to believe that the ''Catalogue'' was not organized in a strictly genealogical manner, but presented the unions of gods and heroines organized to some extent by amorous deity.<ref>E.g. {{harvtxt|Treu|1957}}; cf. {{harvtxt|West|1985a|pp=34<U+2013>5}}.</ref> Six years later, with the publication of the 28th part of the ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]'', the corpus of papyrus witnesses to the fragmentary Hesiodic poems was nearly doubled, with the lion's share of these new texts belonging to the ''Catalogue''.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1963b|p=752}}; the publication is {{harvtxt|Lobel|1962}}.</ref> The new papyri proved once and for all that the poem was organized by genealogies of the great families in a way similar to the ''Bibliotheca'', and that the poet's use of the ''<U+0113>' hoi<U+0113>''-formula was not a random method of introduction but an organizing tool within an overall structure.<ref>{{harvtxt|West|1985a|p=35}}.</ref>
