The '''Consolidated line''', or '''C-line''', was a series of [[diesel-electric]] [[railway]] [[locomotive]] designs produced by [[Fairbanks-Morse]] and its [[Canada|Canadian]] licensee, the  [[Canadian Locomotive Company]]. Individual locomotives in this series were commonly referred to as "'''C-liners'''."  A combined total of 165 units (123 cab-equipped lead [[A unit]]s and 42 cabless booster [[B unit]]s) were produced by F-M and the CLC between [[1950]] and [[1955]].  

==Genesis of the C-liner==
{{main|Fairbanks-Morse}}
Since 1932, Fairbanks-Morse had specialized in the manufacture of [[opposed piston engine|opposed piston]] diesel engines for [[U.S. Navy|United States Naval]] vessels. Not long after, the company produced a 300 hp 5 x 6 engine that saw limited use in [[railcar]] applications on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&O]], [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]], and a few other lines. Additionally, two of the 5 x 6s were placed in an experimental center cab [[switcher]] locomotive under development by the [[Reading Company|Reading Railroad]] (road #87, built in 1939 by the [[St. Louis Car Co.|St. Louis Car Company]], or SLCC, and scrapped in 1953). A 5 x 6 powered the plant switcher at F-M's [[Beloit, Wisconsin]] manufacturing facility.

In 1939, the SLCC placed F-M 800 hp 8 x 10 engines in six streamlined [[railcar]]s, which are known today as the [[FM OP800]]. In [[1944]], F-M began production of its own 1,000 hp [[classification yard|yard]] switcher, the [[FM H-10-44|H-10-44]]. [http://www.irm.org/pictures/600/760milw12.jpg Milwaukee Road #760] (originally delivered as #1802), the first Fairbanks&ndash;Morse locomotive constructed in their own plant, is now preserved and on display at the [[Illinois Railway Museum]]. F-M, like other locomotive producers, was subject to strict wartime restrictions regarding the number and type of railroad-related products they could manufacture. Following [[World War II]], North American railways began phasing out their aging [[steam locomotive]]s and sought to replace them with state-of-the-art [[diesel locomotive]]s at an ever-increasing rate.  Fairbanks-Morse, along with its competing firms, sought to capitalize on this new market opportunity. 

In December, 1945 F-M produced its first streamlined, cab-equipped dual service diesel locomotive as direct competition to such models as the [[ALCO PA]] and [[EMD E-unit]]. Assembly of the 2,000 hp unit, which was mounted on a [[AAR wheel arrangement#A1A-A1A|A1A-A1A]] wheelset, was subcontracted out to [[GE Transportation Systems|General Electric]] due to lack of space at F-M's Wisconsin plant. GE built the locomotives at its [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] facility, thereby giving rise to the name "Erie-built." F-M retained the services of renowned industrial designer [[Raymond Loewy]] to create a visually impressive carbody for the Erie-built. The line was only moderately successful, as a total of 82 cab and 28 booster units was sold through 1949, when production was ended. The Erie-built's successor was to be manufactured in Beloit and designed from the ground up; the result of this effort was the Consolidated line, which debuted in January, 1950.

==C-liner models==

C-liners took many of their design cues from the Erie-builts, and appeared in the F-M catalogue with a variety of options. All of the designs were based on a common 56'&ndash;3" (17.2&ndash;meter) carbody, but the customer could choose cab or booster units equipped with 1,600 hp, 2,000 hp, or 2,400 hp [[opposed piston engine]] [[prime mover]]s. Each option was also offered in both passenger and freight configurations. 

All freight units, and the CLC-built Model CPA/B-16-4 were designed with an [[AAR wheel arrangement#B-B|B-B]] wheel arrangement, while passenger units (in addition to having different gearing) featured an unusual [[AAR wheel arrangement#B-A1A|B-A1A]] wheel configuration, as the rear truck required an extra unpowered axle to help distribute the weight of the steam generator. All C-liners were fitted out with electrical generators and traction motors manufactured by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric]].

==Failure in the marketplace==
Orders for the C-liners were initially received from the [[New York Central]], followed by the [[Long Island Rail Road]], the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], the [[Milwaukee Road]] and the [[New Haven Railroad|New Haven]]. Orders to the Canadian Locomotive Company were also forthcoming in Canada from the [[Canadian Pacific]] and [[Canadian National]] railways. However, accounts of mechanical unreliability and poor technical support soon began to emerge. It quickly became apparent that the 2,400 h.p. Westinghouse generators were prone to failure, and the F-M prime movers initially suffered from relatively poor piston life and proved difficult to maintain.  Moreover, railroads were quickly moving away from [[cowl unit]] designs, and standardizing on [[road-switcher]] designs, as offered by the competition in the form of the [[EMD GP7]] or the [[ALCO RS-3]]. 

By 1952, orders had dried up in the United States, with a total production run of only 99 units. The units proved relatively more popular in Canada, particularly with the CPR, and orders continued there until 1955. Several variants were only ever produced by the Canadian Locomotive Company, and Canadian roads accepted a total of 66 units. However, Westinghouse had announced in [[1953]] that it was leaving the locomotive equipment market, in part because of the generator reliability issues in the F-M units. This development made continuing production of the C-liners impractical without a redesign, and since marketplace acceptance was already marginal, the decision was made to end production. 

With the [[FM Train Master|Train Master]] series, F-M continued production of their own road-switcher designs, but these also ultimately proved unsuccesful in the marketplace and Fairbanks-Morse departed the locomotive market.
