While commanding HMS Lion, on 22 March 1711,{{Ref|Notea|a}} Walpole's ship was in Vado Bay in the Mediterranean as lookout cruisers when they sighted four French enemy ships. Amongst those who gave chase and engaged the enemy for about two hours was HMS Lion who lost forty men. Walpole was so badly injured that his right arm was amputated by the ship's surgeon [[John Atkins (naval surgeon)|John Atkins]] who sat up for two nights with Walpole who gave not thanks for the attention.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Clowes |first=William Laird |authorlink=William Laird Clowes |title=The Royal Navy, a history from the earliest times to the present |publisher=Sampson Low, Marston and Company |year=1898 |location=London |pages=531 |url=https://archive.org/stream/royalnavyhistory02clowuoft#page/577 }}</ref><ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Atkins, John|last=Moore|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Moore|volume=2}}</ref>

==Lord Nelson's sword==
Walpole's sword, used on HMS Lion was given to a young [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] who was apparently wielding it when he too lost his right arm in the [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] on 15 July 1797.<ref name="naval chronicle 14"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Nevill |first=Lady Corothy |title=Mannington and the Walpoles |publisher=[[Fine Art Society]] |year=1894 |location=London |pages=13<U+2013>14 |url=http://memory.loc.gov/service/gdc/scd0001/2007/20070601074ma/20070601074ma.pdf }}</ref> The Walpole sword which has a silver-hilted hanger was made by Nixon Cutlers of London, has 1752 London silver hallmarks and a 60cm curved blade. Due to its provenance, the sword is known as the Galfridus Walpole&nbsp;<U+2014> Suckling Sword, having been given to Walpole's godson and great nephew [[Maurice Suckling]] whose sister [[Catherine Suckling]] was Nelson's mother. William Suckling, Maurice's bother gave the sword to Nelson, who wore his uncle's valued gift his early career. The sword appears to have been returned to the Suckling family.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sword Carried by Nelson Offered at Sotheby<U+2019>s |work=Press release |publisher=[[Sotheby<U+2019>s]] |date=30 October 2003 |url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/BID/3410150189x0x104943/8dfb2a96-6e3c-43c6-8530-d935a011d164/20031021-120462.pdf |accessdate=22 September 2014 }}</ref> The sword was sold at auction by [[Sotheby<U+2019>s]] in late 2003 for [[Pound sterling|GBP]] 36,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Galfridus Walpole and Maurice Suckling silver-hilted hanger believed to be that carried by Captain (later Admiral Lord) Horatio Nelson, by Nixon, Strand, London |work=Auction lot description |publisher=Sotheby<U+2019>s |date=4 December 2003 |url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2003/arms-armour-w03806/lot.80.html |accessdate=22 Spetember 2014 }}</ref> While Sotheby<U+2019>s couched their lot desction with the word "believed", back in 1922 the veracity of the story was questioned in the Oxford Journal, ''Notes & Queries'' based on the fact that Nelson would be most unlikely to have used an outdated century old sword in battle.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Andrew |first=W.J. |title=The Fighting Sword of Lord Nelson |journal=Notes & Queries |volume= s12-XI |issue=232 |pages=241<U+2013>242 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |date=23 September 23 1922 |url=http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/s12-XI/232/local/front-matter.pdf |issn=0029-3970 |accessdate=22 September 2014 }}</ref>
