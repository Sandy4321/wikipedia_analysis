'''Full genome sequencing''' (FGS) refers to the laboratory process of obtaining exact [[DNA sequence]] data (genotypic information) for the entire genome of an [[organism]] at a single time.  This includes sequencing all of the [[DNA]] from an organism, including all chromosomes as well as DNA contained in the [[mitochondria]] (for animals) or [[chloroplast]] (for plants). Almost any biologic sample that contains even a very small amount of DNA, or DNA that is quite old, such as thousands of years old, can provide the genetic material necessary for full genome sequencing, such as blood, saliva, [[epithelial cells]], [[bone marrow]], hair (as long as the hair contains a [[hair follicle]]), seed, leaf of a plant, etc.  The sequencing data that is produced can be quite large (for example, there are ''three billion'' bases in each human genome) and therefore full genome data is always stored electronically and requires a large amount of computing power and storage capacity.  Full genome sequencing would have been nearly impossible before the advent of the [[microprocessor]], [[computers]], and the [[Information Age]]. 

Full genome sequencing is synonymous with whole genome sequencing (WGS), complete genome sequencing (CGS), and entire genome sequencing (EGS).  Full genome sequencing is a laboratory process that only provides [[genotypic]] data and may not provide any clinical analysis of the genetic data or any correlation with diseases or traits.  The first full genome sequenced was that of Dr. J. [[Craig Venter]].<ref>{{cite news | title=In the Genome Race, the Sequel Is Personal | last=Wade | first=Nicholas | publisher=New York Times | date=September 4, 2007 | dateformat=mdy | accessdate=February 22, 2009 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/04/science/04vent.html}}</ref>  Although it was not known during the race to sequence the first entire human genome during the 1990's, it was later revealed that [[Celera Genomics]]' sequence was actually that of it's CEO, Dr. Venter.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=PLoS Biology|year=2007|volume=5|issue=10|title=The Diploid Genome Sequence of an Individual Human|author=Levy S, Sutton G, Ng PC, Feuk L, Halpern AL, et al.|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254|pages=e254}}</ref>  Since that time, many other full genomes have been sequenced, such as Dr. [[James Watson]]'s,<ref>{{cite web | title=DNA pioneer Watson gets own genome map | last=Wade | first=Wade | publisher=International Herald Tribune | date=June 1, 2007 | dateformat=mdy | accessdate=February 22, 2009 | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/01/america/dna.php}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Genome of DNA Pioneer Is Deciphered  | last=Wade | first=Nicholas | publsiher=New York Times | date=May 31, 2007 | dateformat=mdy | accessdate=February 21, 2009 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/science/31cnd-gene.html}}</ref> although, as of February 2009 the true [[commercialization]] of full genome sequencing has yet to be achieved.

==New technological approaches==
===Nanopores===
One possible way to accomplish the cost-effective [[high-throughput sequencing]] necessary to accomplish full genome sequencing is by utilizing [[Nanopore]] technology, which is a patented technology held by Harvard University and Oxford Nanopore and licensed to biotechnology companies.<ref>http://www.nanotechwire.com/news.asp?nid=6428</ref>  [[Illumina]] has licensed this technology from Oxford Nanopore and is utilizing it to enable their full genome sequencing services.<ref>http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS49869+12-Jan-2009+BW20090112</ref>

===Fluorophores===
Another possible way to accomplish cost-effective high-throughput sequencing is by utilizing [[fluorophore]] technology.  Pacific Biosciences is currently using this approach in their SMRT (single molecule real time) DNA sequencing technology.<ref>http://www.pacificbiosciences.com/index.php?q=technology-introduction</ref>

===DNA nanoballs===
Complete Genomics is developing DNA Nanoball (DNB) technology that are arranged on self-assembling arrays.<ref>http://www.completegenomicsinc.com/pages/materials/CompleteGenomicsTechnologyPaper.pdf</ref>

===Pyrosequencing===
[[Pyrosequencing]] is a method of [[DNA sequencing]] based on the sequencing by synthesis principle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v6/n11/glossary/nrg1709_glossary.html | title=Definition of pyrosequencing from the Nature Reviews Genetics Glossary | accessdate=2008-10-28 }}</ref> The technique was developed by [[P<U+00E5>l Nyr<U+00E9>n]] and his student [[Mostafa Ronaghi]] at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm in 1996,<ref name=RonachiScience>

==Older technological approaches==
===Shotgun sequencing===
Full genome sequencing of the entire human genome was first accomplished in 2000, in-part utilizing shotgun sequencing technology.  While full genome shotgun sequencing for small (4000 to 7000 basepair) genomes was already in use in 1979,<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/461197</ref> broader application benefited from pairwise end sequencing, known colloquially as ''double-barrel shotgun sequencing''.  As sequencing projects began to take on longer and more complicated DNAs, multiple groups began to realize that useful information could be obtained by sequencing both ends of a fragment of DNA. Although sequencing both ends of the same fragment and keeping track of the paired data was more cumbersome than sequencing a single end of two distinct fragments, the knowledge that the two sequences were oriented in opposite directions and were about the length of a fragment apart from each other was valuable in reconstructing the sequence of the original target fragment. The first published description of the use of paired ends was in 1990 as part of the sequencing of the human [[Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase | HPRT]] locus,<ref>{{cite journal

  | doi = 10.1016/S1046-2023(05)80162-8 }}</ref> although the use of paired ends was limited to closing gaps after the application of a traditional shotgun sequencing approach. The first theoretical description of a pure pairwise end sequencing strategy, assuming fragments of constant length, was in 1991.<ref>{{cite journal

The strategy was subsequently adopted by [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] (TIGR) to sequence the entire genome of the bacterium ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' in 1995,<ref>{{cite journal

While shotgun sequencing was one of the first approaches utilized to successfully sequence the full genome of a human, it is too expensive and requires too long of a turn-around-time to be utilized for commercial purposes.  Because of this, shotgun sequencing technology, even though it is still relatively 'new', has already been displaced by more current technologies that are significantly more cost-effective and time-efficient, such as those mentioned above.

==Race to commercialization==
In October 2006, the [[X Prize Foundation]], working in collaboration with the J. Craig Venter Science Foundation, established the [[Archon X Prize]] for Genomics<ref>http://synthesis.cc/2007/01/a-few-thoughts-on-rapid-genome-sequencing-and-the-archon-prize.html</ref>, intending to award $10 million to "the first Team that can build a device and use it to sequence 100 human genomes within 10 days or less, with an accuracy of no more than one error in every 100,000 bases sequenced, with sequences accurately covering at least 98% of the genome, and at a recurring cost of no more than $10,000 (US) per genome."<ref>[http://genomics.xprize.org/genomics/archon-x-prize-for-genomics/prize-overview "PRIZE Overview: Archon X PRIZE for Genomics"].</ref>  However, a higher accuracy rate will be needed before this technology has clinical utility.  An error rate of 1 in 100,000 bases, out of a total of 3 billion bases in the human genome, would mean about 30,000 errors per genome, which is a ''highly'' significant number of false positives and false negatives, especially since it will not be known where the errors occurred (for example, did the error occur while sequencing the [[BRCA1]] gene, which may then be associated with a false [[breast cancer]] risk analysis).  Instead, the error rate will have to be ''better than'' 1 in 10 million bases, which will provide 300 inaccurate bases per genome or less and will then make the data applicable for global, wide-spread clinical use (such as in [[Predictive Medicine]]).<ref>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VS0-4M4TNKN-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=76731e3a5387a2021c72f9c339546ca2</ref>  As of February 2009, the [[Archon X Prize]] for Genomics remains unclaimed.

In 2008 and 2009, both public and private companies have emerged that are now in a competitive race to be the [[first mover]] to provide full genome sequencing services that are commercially viable,<ref>http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem.aspx?aid=939&chid=1</ref> including [[Illumina]],<ref>http://www.eyeondna.com/2008/02/11/whole-genome-sequencing-costs-continue-to-drop/</ref> [[454 Life Sciences]]<ref>http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem.aspx?aid=658&chid=2</ref>, [[Pacific Biosciences]],<ref>http://venturebeat.com/2008/02/10/pacific-bio-lifts-the-veil-on-its-high-speed-genome-sequencing-effort/</ref> and [[Complete Genomics]].<ref>http://www.bio-itworld.com/headlines/2008/oct06/complete-genomics-dna-nanoballs.html</ref>  These companies are heavily financed and backed by venture capitalists, hedge funds, investment banks and, in the case of 454 and Illumina, heavy re-investment of profits into research and development, mergers and acquisitions, and licensing initiatives.<ref>http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/pacific-biosciences-garners-100m-sequencing-tech/2008-07-14</ref>  <ref>http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2009/02/09/story1.html?b=1234155600^1773923</ref>  

Complete Genomics is the only company that has provided a service release date and price by stating that they will be able to provide a ''$5,000'' full genome sequencing service for the human genome by the ''summer of 2009''.<ref>http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/21466/</ref>  The accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of their technology, however, is still unknown.

A [[personal genomics]] company located in Massachusetts, Knome.com, currently provides genome sequencing services but the cost is USD $350,000 per genome, the turn-around time is unknown, the accuracy is unknown, and the number of people is reportedly limited to 20 so this does not qualify as the true [[commercialization]] of full genome sequencing.<ref>http://springwise.com/lifestyle_leisure/premium_genome_mapping_service/</ref>

As of February, 2009, there are no indications that any of these companies have been hindered by the global recession.  And thus, the race appears to be proceeding forward at full speed.

==Disruptive technology==
Full genome sequencing provides information on a genome that is orders of magnitude larger than that provided by the current leader in genotyping technology, DNA arrays.  For humans, DNA genotyping arrays currently provides genotypic information on up to one million genetic variants<ref>http://www.gladstone.ucsf.edu/gladstone/site/genomicscore/section/1919</ref><ref>http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/431</ref><ref>http://www.genomeweb.com/arrays/illumina-decode-build-1m-snp-chip-q2-launch-coincide-release-affys-60-snp-array</ref> while full genome sequencing will provide information on all three billion bases in the human genome, or 3,000 times more data.  Because of this, full genome sequencing will be disruptive to the DNA genotyping array markets once the accuracy (>99.98%), precision (>99.99%), and consistent reproducibility of extremely high-quality results (>99.99%) is demonstrated and its cost becomes competitive with DNA arrays (less than $500 per sample).<ref>http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem.aspx?aid=658&chid=2</ref>.  It is unknown whether the other established DNA genotyping array manufacturers, [[Sequenom]] or [[Agilent]], are also working on full genome sequencing technologies or services.  It is thought that [[Affymetrix]], the pioneer of array technology in the 1990s, has fallen behind due to significant corporate and stock turbulence and is currently not working on any known full genome sequencing approach.<ref>http://sacramento.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2008/07/21/daily52.html</ref><ref>http://www.fool.com/investing/high-growth/2006/04/24/affymetrix-gets-chipped-again.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7117/full/444256a.html</ref>  It is unknown what will happen to the genotyping array market once full genome sequencing becomes commercially viable, especially when companies and laboratories providing this disruptive technology start to realize economies of scale.  It is postulated, however, that this new technology may significantly diminish the total market size for arrays and any other genotyping technology once it becomes commonplace for individuals and newborns to have their full genome's sequenced.<ref>http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/n10/full/nbt1008-1109.html</ref>

==Societal impact==
Inexpensive, time-efficient full genome sequencing will be a major accomplishment not only for the field of [[Genomics]], but for the entire human [[civilization]] because, for the first time, individuals will be able to have their entire genome sequenced.  Utilizing this information, health care professionals, such as physicians and [[genetic counselors]], will be greatly empowered by this information and be able to use it to predict what diseases a person may get in the future and attempt to either minimize the impact of that disease or avoid it altogether through the implementation of personalized, [[preventive medicine]].  Full genome sequencing will allow [[health care professionals]] to analyze the entire human genome of an individual and therefore detect all disease-related genetic variants, regardless of the genetic variant's prevalence or frequency.  This will enable the rapidly emerging medical fields of [[Predictive Medicine]] and [[Personalized Medicine]] and will mark a significant leap forward for the clinical genetic revolution.

Illumina's CEO, Jay Flatley, stated in Februrary 2009 that "A complete DNA read-out for every newborn will be technically feasible and affordable in less than five years, promising a revolution in healthcare" and that "by 2019 it will have become routine to map infants' genes when they are born."<ref>http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article5689052.ece</ref>
