The '''Daimler Majestic''' 101 was introduced by the [[Daimler Motor Company]] of [[Coventry]] in 1958 and was in production until 1962. The six cylinder, four door saloon, with new three speed [[Borg Warner]] [[automatic transmission]], [[power steering]] and four-wheel [[disc brakes]], vacuum-servo assisted, was very mechanically advanced for its time, but it had an outdated heavy body and engine with [[separate chassis]] which kept the car's mass well above more modern designs and made it difficult to manoeuvre, despite the modern steering. The styling was already somewhat outdated when the car appeared and became increasingly dated as lighter bodies with [[Monocoque|monocoque construction]] appeared during the Majestic's production run.<ref name="Early">{{cite web|url=http://www.motorbase.com/vehicle/by-id/539/|title=Motorbase.com Daimler Majestic|accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref>

==Construction==
Like all previous postwar Daimlers, the "Majestic" was designed around a massive cruciform-braced box-section [[chassis]] equipped with coil-sprung independent front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], with a well located 'live' rear axle with semi-elliptic [[leaf spring]]s. Four-wheel disc brakes were regarded as a first for a British production car<ref name="brake">{{cite web|url=http://www.fletcherservices.com.au/fs_024.htm|title=Fletcherservices.com  Daimler Majestic and Majestic Major|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref>.

The engine was an inline six of 3.8 litres (3794&nbsp;cc), based on previous Daimler sixes with [[pushrod]] operated overhead valves and retaining the 107.95 millimetre (4.25&nbsp;inch) stroke, but with the bore increased to 86.36 millimetres (3.4&nbsp;inches) from the 82.55 millimetres (3.25&nbsp;inches) of the 104, giving a power output of over {{convert|147|bhp}} at 4,400 rpm<ref>Smith; The Daimler Tradition; p. 261.</ref> and a maximum speed of around 180km/h (112mph). To help with the increase in the bore, the [[cylinder block]] was considerably enlarged to allow for the fitting of completely new liners: dry liners as present on the 104 were absent on the Majestic.

The styling of the Majestic was similar to, but wider and with smoother lines than the short lived 104 model it replaced. The body was massive and the doors were quite high with narrow windows and a rounded rear window. There were two small headlamps at each end on the front side and two [[fog lamp]]s just above low-set [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]]. There were plain disc [[wheel]]s.

==Performance==
A  car tested by the British magazine [[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]] in 1958 had a top speed of {{convert|100.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and could accelerate from 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 14.2 seconds. A fuel consumption of {{convert|19.3|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} was recorded. The test car cost <U+00A3>2495 including taxes of <U+00A3>832. <ref name=Motor1958>{{cite journal | authorlink = Unsigned |title = The 3.8 litre Daimler Majestic saloon| journal =[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]| volume = | pages = | date = July 9 1958}}</ref> 

==Notable successors==
The Daimler Majestic was soon overshadowed by the [[Daimler Majestic Major]], using the same body, but with a new 4.5 litre hemi-head [[V8]] engine introduced in 1959, even though production continued, side by side till 1962.<ref name="brake"/> It is notable that, though produced for a shorter period, significantly more examples of the six-cylinder model were produced than of the latterly better-known "Major".

In 1989 and 1990 Jaguar Cars produced a special edition of the [[Jaguar XJ6|XJ40]] using the Majestic name, at first in the US only, leather-equipped with steering wheel in interior colour and often red or blue pipin. In the final XJ40 years the name Majestic was used for the special build LWB XJ40. Only 121 Jaguars and Daimler were built like that.
