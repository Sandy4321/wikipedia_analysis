'''Echo Lake''' is a shallow, [[oligotroph]]ic [[lake]] situated at {{Convert|10600|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} above sea level near [[Mount Evans]] in the [[Colorado]] [[Rocky Mountains]]. It formed during the latest period of [[glaciation]] roughly 10,000 years ago.  As glaciers retreated in the Chicago Creek valley, lateral [[moraine]]s formed a natural dam to drainage, forming the lake.  The ecosystem around the lake is dominated by [[Engelmann Spruce]] (''Picea engelmannii'') and [[Subalpine Fir]] (''Abies lasiocarpa''), with some [[Limber Pine]] (''Pinus flexilis'') on exposed sites.
