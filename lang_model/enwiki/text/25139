===1975<U+2013>1984: Founding===

Following the launch of the [[Altair 8800]], William Henry Gates III, (known as [[Bill Gates]]) called the creators of the new [[microcomputer]], [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]] (MITS), offering to demonstrate an implementation of the [[BASIC programming language]] for the system. After the demonstration, MITS agreed to distribute [[Altair BASIC]].<ref name="keyevents">{{cite web |title=Information for Students: Key Events In Microsoft History |url=http://www.microsoft.com/about/companyinformation/visitorcenter/student.mspx |publisher=Microsoft Visitor Center Student Information |accessdate=October 1 |accessyear=2005 |format=doc}}</ref> [[Bill Gates|Gates]] left [[Harvard University]], moved to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] where MITS was located, and founded Microsoft there.  The company's first international office was founded on November 1, 1978, in Japan, titled "[[ASCII]] Microsoft" (now called "[[Microsoft Japan]]").<ref name="keyevents" /> On January 1, 1979, the company moved from Albuquerque to a new home in [[Bellevue, Washington]].<ref name="keyevents" /> [[Steve Ballmer]] joined the company on June 11, 1980, and later succeeded Bill Gates as [[CEO]].<ref name="keyevents" />

Among pre-IBM-PC products were the software package TASC (The [[Applesoft BASIC|AppleSoft]] Compiler), which compiled a BASIC program into Apple machine language, and the hardware [[Microsoft Softcard]], an add-on [[Z80]] processor card for the Apple II and compatible computers which allowed the use of the [[CP/M]] [[operating system]] instead of [[Applesoft]] and [[Apple DOS]]. In 1980, Microsoft entered the operating system business with its own version of [[Unix]], called [[Xenix]], which it licensed to various computer vendors.

[[DOS]] ([[Disk storage|Disk]] Operating System) was the operating system that brought the company its first real success. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with [[Digital Research]] failed, [[International Business Machines|IBM]] awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide a version of the [[CP/M]] operating system, which was set to be used in the upcoming [[IBM Personal Computer]] (PC). For this deal, Microsoft purchased a [[CP/M]] clone called [[86-DOS]] from [[Seattle Computer Products]], which IBM renamed to [[PC-DOS]]. Later, the market saw a flood of IBM PC clones after [[Columbia Data Products]] successfully cloned the IBM [[BIOS]], and by aggressively marketing [[MS-DOS]] to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones, Microsoft rose from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the home computer industry.<ref name="Smart-Close">{{cite web |url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/r0304/09r04/09r04.asp&guid= |title=Booting Your PC: Getting Up Close & Personal With A Computer<U+2019>s BIOS |publisher=Smart Computing |month=November | year=1999 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref><ref name="Smart-WhatBIOS">{{cite web |url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/1994/july94/pcn0713/pcn0713.asp&articleid=5360&guid= |title=What Is The BIOS? |month=July | year=1994 |publisher=Smart Computing |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref><ref name="Lemley-BIOS">{{cite web |url=http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1151907,00.asp |title=Everything You Want or Need to Know About Your BIOS |publisher=Extreme Tech |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref><ref name="Lemley-IP">{{cite book |last=Lemley |first=Mark |coauthors=Peter S.

===1985<U+2013>1994: IPO, OS/2 and Windows===

In August 1985, Microsoft and [[IBM]] partnered in the development of a different operating system called [[OS/2]].<ref name="Dubash">{{cite web |author=Manek Dubash |title=Techworld Article:OS/2 users must look elsewhere |work=Techworld |publisher=[[IDG]] |url=http://www.techworld.com/applications/features/index.cfm?featureid=1603&Page=1&pagePos=5 |date=2005-07-19 |accessdate=2005-07-05}}</ref>  On November 20, 1985, Microsoft released its first retail version of [[Microsoft Windows]], originally a graphical extension for its MS-DOS operating system.<ref name="keyevents" /> On March 13, 1986 the company went public with an [[IPO|initial public offering (IPO)]], with a starting initial offering price of $21.00 and ending at the first day of trading as at US $28.00.

====IPO====

Microsoft's [[Initial Public Offering]] occurred on March 14, 1986. The stock closed at $27.75 per share after peaking at $29.25 shortly after the opening. Microsoft's two founders, Gates and Allen, were made instant millionaires. Gates owned 45% of the company's 24.7 million outstanding shares and Allen roughly 25%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/102018.asp|title=Looking back: Microsoft IPO, March 1986|last=Bishop|first=Todd|date=2006-03-16|publisher=The Microsoft Blog|accessdate=2009-05-30}}</ref> Gates' stake was therefore $234 million and Microsoft's total-value $520million, at that time.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.09/trillionaire.html Wired 7.09: The World's First Trillionaire]</ref>

In 1989, Microsoft introduced its flagship [[office suite]], [[Microsoft Office]].

===1995<U+2013>2005: Internet and legal issues===

In 1995, Microsoft released [[Windows 95]], a new version of the company's flagship operating system which featured a completely new user interface, including a novel [[Start menu|start button]]; more than a million copies of Microsoft Windows 95 were sold in the first four days after its release.<ref name="thocp2" /> The company also released its [[web browser]], [[Internet Explorer]], with the Windows 95 Plus!

In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the Federal [[District court|District Court]] in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.<ref name="keyevents" />

The year 1998 was significant in Microsoft's history, with Bill Gates appointing [[Steve Ballmer]] as president of Microsoft but remaining as Chair and CEO himself.<ref name="keyevents" /> The company released [[Windows 98]], an update to Windows 95 that incorporated a number of Internet-focused features and support for new types of devices.<ref name="keyevents" /> On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of [[United States v.

Part of this ruling was later overturned by a federal [[Appeal|appeals court]], and eventually settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2001.

In 2001, Microsoft released [[Windows XP]], the first version that encompassed the features of both its business and home product lines. Before XP was released, Microsoft had to maintain both the [[Windows NT|NT]] and the [[Windows 9x|9x]] codebase.

== Product divisions ==

<!-- Generally we stick to products that are in the current annual report here - if you wish to add one that is not you probably need to provide a reference for it -->

To be more precise in tracking performance of each unit and delegating responsibility, Microsoft reorganized into seven core business groups<U+2014>each an independent financial entity<U+2014>in April 2002. Later, on September 20, 2005, Microsoft announced a rationalization of its original seven business groups into the three core divisions that exist today: the Windows Client, MSN and Server and Tool groups were merged into the ''Microsoft Platform Products and Services Division''; the Information Worker and Microsoft Business Solutions groups were merged into the ''Microsoft Business Division''; and the [[mobile computing|Mobile and Embedded Devices]] and Home and Entertainment groups were merged into the ''Microsoft Entertainment and Devices Division''.<ref name="MS-Commitment">{{cite web |title=Our Commitment to Our Customers: Microsoft's Business|url=http://www.microsoft.com/About/CompanyInformation/ourbusinesses/business.mspx |publisher=Microsoft |date=2005-09-20 |accessdate=2007-03-31 }}</ref><ref name="MSPR-AllchinRetire">{{cite press release |title=Microsoft Realigns for Next Wave of Innovation and Growth: CEO Ballmer appoints presidents of three core divisions; Allchin announces retirement plan |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/sep05/09-20ExecChangesPR.mspx |date=2005-09-20 |accessdate=September 26 |publisher=Microsoft |accessyear=2005 }}</ref>

=== Platform Products and Services Division ===
[[Image:Windows logo.svg|thumb|The current logo of [[Microsoft Windows]], the company's signature product.]]

This division produces Microsoft's [[flagship]] product, the Windows operating system. It has been produced in many versions, including [[Windows 3.1]], [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98]], [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows Me]], [[Windows Server 2003]], [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Vista]]. Almost all [[IBM PC compatible|IBM compatible]] [[personal computers]] come with Windows preinstalled. The current desktop version of Windows is Windows Vista. The [[online service]] MSN, the cable television station [[MSNBC]] and the Microsoft online magazine ''Slate'' are all part of this division. (''Slate'' was acquired by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on December 21, 2004.) At the end of 1997, Microsoft acquired [[Hotmail]], the most popular [[webmail]] service, which it rebranded as "MSN Hotmail". In 1999, Microsoft introduced [[MSN Messenger]], an [[instant messaging]] client, to compete with the popular [[AOL Instant Messenger]]. Along with Windows Vista, MSN Messenger became [[Windows Live Messenger]].<ref name="2005annual" />

[[Microsoft Visual Studio]] is the company's set of [[programming]] tools and [[compilers]]. The software product is GUI-oriented and links easily with the [[Windows API]]s, but must be specially configured if used with non-Microsoft libraries. The current version is [[Visual Studio 2008]]. The previous version, [[Visual Studio 2005]] was a major improvement over its predecessor, Visual Studio.Net 2003, named after the .NET initiative, a Microsoft marketing initiative covering a number of technologies. Microsoft's definition of .NET continues to evolve. As of 2004, .NET aims to ease the development of Microsoft Windows-based applications that use the Internet, by deploying a new Microsoft communications system, ''Indigo'' (now renamed [[Windows Communication Foundation]]). This is intended to address some issues previously introduced by Microsoft's DLL design, which made it difficult, even impossible in some situations, to manage, install multiple versions of complex [[Software package (programming)|software packages]] on the same system (see [[DLL-hell]]), and provide a more consistent development platform for all Windows applications (see [[Common Language Infrastructure]]). In addition, the Company established a set of certification programs to recognize individuals who have expertise in its software and solutions. Similar to offerings from [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Novell]], [[IBM]], and [[Oracle Corporation]], these tests are designed to identify a minimal set of proficiencies in a specific role; this includes developers ([[Microsoft Certified Professional|"Microsoft Certified Solution Developer"]]), system/network analysts ([[MCSE|"Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer"]]), trainers ("[[Microsoft Certified Professional|Microsoft Certified Trainers]]") and administrators ([[MCSA|"Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator"]] and [[MCDBA|"Microsoft Certified Database Administrator"]]).<ref name="2005annual" />

Microsoft offers a suite of [[Server (computing)|server]] software, titled [[Windows Server System]]. [[Windows Server 2003]], an operating system for network servers, is the core of the Windows Server System line. Another server product, [[Systems Management Server]], is a collection of tools providing remote-control abilities, patch management, software distribution and a hardware/software inventory. Other server products include:
* [[Microsoft SQL Server]], a [[relational database]] management system;
* [[Microsoft Exchange Server]], for certain business-oriented [[e-mail]] and scheduling features;
* [[Small Business Server]], for messaging and other small business-oriented features; and
* [[Microsoft BizTalk Server]], for [[business process management]].<ref name="2005annual" />

=== Business Division ===
[[Image:Microsoft building 17 front door.jpg|thumb|left|Front entrance to building 17 on the main campus of the company's Redmond campus.]]

The Microsoft Business Division produces [[Microsoft Office]], which is the company's line of office software. The software product includes [[Microsoft Office Word|Word]] (a word processor), [[Microsoft Access|Access]] (a personal relational database application), [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] (a [[spreadsheet]] program), [[Microsoft Office Outlook|Outlook]] (Windows-only [[collaborative software|groupware]], frequently used with [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange Server]]), [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] (presentation software), and [[Microsoft Publisher|Publisher]] ([[desktop publishing software]]). A number of other products were added later with the release of Office 2003 including [[Microsoft Visio|Visio]], [[Microsoft Project|Project]], [[Microsoft MapPoint|MapPoint]], [[Microsoft InfoPath|InfoPath]] and [[Microsoft Office OneNote|OneNote]].<ref name="2005annual" />

The division also develops financial and business management software for companies. These products include products formerly produced by the Business Solutions Group, which was created in April 2001 with the acquisition of [[Great Plains (accounting)|Great Plains]]. Subsequently, [[Microsoft Navision|Navision]] was acquired to provide a similar entry into the European market, resulting in the planned release of [[Microsoft Dynamics NAV]] in 2006. The group markets [[Axapta]] and Solomon, catering to similar markets, which is scheduled to be combined with the Navision and Great Plains lines into a common platform called [[Microsoft Dynamics]].<ref name="2005annual" />

=== Entertainment and Devices Division ===

[[Image:Xbox_360.png|thumb|right|The [[Xbox 360]], Microsoft's second system in the gaming console market.]]

Microsoft has attempted to expand the Windows brand into many other markets, with products such as [[Windows CE]] for [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDAs]] and its "Windows-powered" Smartphone products. Microsoft initially entered the mobile market through Windows CE for [[handheld device]]s, which today has developed into [[Windows Mobile]] 6. The focus of the operating system is on devices where the OS may not directly be visible to the end user, in particular, appliances and cars.

The company produces [[MSN TV]], formerly [[WebTV]], a television-based [[Internet appliance]]. Microsoft used to sell a set-top [[Digital Video Recorder]] (DVR) called the [[Microsoft TV|UltimateTV]], which allowed users to record up to 35 hours of television programming from a [[Direct-To-Home|direct-to-home]] [[satellite television]] provider [[DirecTV]]. This was the main competition in the UK for [[British Sky Broadcasting]]'s (BSkyB) SKY + service, owned by [[Rupert Murdoch]]. UltimateTV has since been discontinued, with DirecTV instead opting to market DVRs from [[TiVo]] Inc. before later switching to their own [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] brand.<ref name="2005annual" />

Microsoft sells [[computer games]] that run on Windows PCs, including titles such as ''[[Age of Empires]]'', ''[[Halo (video game series)|Halo]]'' and the ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'' series. It produces a line of [[reference work]]s that include [[encyclopedia]]s and [[atlas (cartography)|atlases]], under the name ''[[Encarta]]''. [[Microsoft Zone]] hosts free premium and retail games where players can compete against each other and in tournaments.

Microsoft entered the multi-billion-dollar [[game console]] market dominated by [[Sony]] and [[Nintendo]] in late 2001,<ref name="BizWire-2001Ent">{{cite web |title=NPD Reports Annual 2001 U.S. Interactive Entertainment Sales Shatter Industry Record |publisher=Business Wire |date=February 7, 2002 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_Feb_7/ai_82604922 |accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> with the release of the [[Xbox]]. The company develops and publishes its own video games for this console, with the help of its [[Microsoft Game Studios]] subsidiary, in addition to [[third-party developer|third-party]] Xbox [[video game publisher]]s such as [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Activision]], who pay a license fee to publish games for the system. The Xbox also has a successor in the [[Xbox 360]], released on November 22, 2005 in North America and other countries.<ref name="Wolfe">{{cite web |author=Alexander Wolfe |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=174401045 |work=Information Week |publisher=[[CMP Media]] |title=Midnight Madness Hypes Xbox 360 Launch |date=November 22, 2005 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref><ref name="BBC-Xbox360">{{cite web |date=December 2, 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4491804.stm |title=Xbox 360 sells out within hours |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> With the [[Xbox 360]], Microsoft hopes to compensate for the losses incurred with the original [[Xbox]]. However, Microsoft made some decisions considered controversial in the video [[Gaming Community|gaming community]], such as releasing the console with high [[Xbox 360 technical problems|failure rates]], selling two different versions of the system, one without the [[hard disk drive]] and providing limited [[backward compatibility]] with only particular Xbox titles.<ref name="Thorsen-360play">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6139702.html |title=360 to play 200-plus Xbox games |author=Tor Thorsen |publisher=GameSpot |date=2005-11-11 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref><ref name="Thorsen-360compat">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6140998.html |title=360 backward-compatibility update rereleased |author=Tor Thorsen |publisher=GameSpot |date=2005-12-09 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> 

In addition to the Xbox line of products, Microsoft also markets a number of other computing-related hardware products as well, including [[computer mouse|mice]], [[Computer keyboard|keyboards]], [[joystick]]s, and [[gamepad]]s, along with other [[game controller]]s, the production of which is outsourced in most cases. As of November 15, 2007, Microsoft announced the purchase of Musiwave, [[Openwave]]'s mobile phone music sales business.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musiwave.net/MW_press_release_details.php?idrelease=87 |title=Musiwave acquisition |date=2007-11-15 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

== Economic impact ==

One of [[Bill Gates]]' key visions for the company was to "to get a workstation running our software onto every desk and eventually in every home".<ref name="findingsoffact">{{cite web |author=Thomas Penfield Jackson, U.S. District Judge |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f3800/msjudgex.htm |title=U.S. vs. Microsoft findings of fact |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |date=1999-11-05 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref><ref>Quote from ComputerWorld 1985 (7/22); there is as yet no documented use of this vision statement prior to 1985.

Because of their huge market share in home and business operating systems, they play an important role in the economics of software.

Microsoft has footholds in other markets besides operating systems and office suites, with assets such as the [[MSNBC]] [[cable television]] network, the [[MSN]] [[Web portal|Internet portal]], and the [[Encarta|Microsoft Encarta]] multimedia encyclopedia. The company also markets both [[computer hardware]] products such as the [[IntelliMouse|Microsoft mouse]] and [[home entertainment]] products such as the [[Xbox]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Zune]] and [[MSN TV]].<ref name="2005annual" />

== User culture ==
<!-- Note we could really use more here about the user culture as the expected behaviur - i.e. how apple tends to generate advocates while Microsoft users mainly see its products as tools, for example-->
Technical reference for developers and articles for various Microsoft magazines such as ''Microsoft Systems Journal'' (or MSJ) are available through the Microsoft Developer Network, often called [[MSDN]]. MSDN also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software.<ref name="MSDN-SubscribeFAQ">{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ms123402.aspx?missingurl=%2fsubscriptions%2ffaq%2fdefault.aspx |publisher=Microsoft|title=MSDN Subscription FAQ |accessdate=2006-07-03}}</ref><ref name="MSJ-home">{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/msj/ |title=Microsoft Systems Journal Homepage |publisher=Microsoft|date=April 15, 2004 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> In recent years, Microsoft launched a community site for developers and users, titled [[Channel9]], which provides many modern features such as a [[wiki]] and an [[Internet forum]].<ref name="Hobson">{{cite web |author=Neville Hobson |url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/04/11/microsofts-channel-and-cultural-rules |title=Microsoft's Channel 9 And Cultural Rules |work=WebProNews |publisher=[[iEntry Inc]] |date=2005-04-11 |accessdate=2006-07-03}}</ref> Another community site that provides daily [[videocast]]s and other services, ''On10.net'', launched on March 3, 2006.<ref name="On10-home">{{cite web |url=http://www.On10.net |title=On10.net homepage |accessdate=2006-05-04}}</ref>

Most free technical support available through Microsoft is provided through online [[Usenet]] [[newsgroups]] (in the early days it was also provided on [[CompuServe]]). There are several of these newsgroups for nearly every product Microsoft provides, and often they are monitored by Microsoft employees. People who are helpful on the newsgroups can be elected by other peers or Microsoft employees for [[Microsoft Most Valuable Professional]] (MVP) status, which entitles people to a sort of special social status, in addition to possibilities for awards and other benefits.<ref name="MVP">{{cite web | url=http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2005/06/13/somehow_usenet_lumbers_on/ | title=Somehow, Usenet lumbers on | author=Hiawatha Bray | date=[[2005-06-13]] | accessdate=2006-07-03 | publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]}}<br />* {{cite web | url= http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/mvpfaqs | title= Microsoft Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = Microsoft (Most Valued Professional) | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>

== Corporate affairs ==
=== Corporate structure ===

The company is run by a Board of Directors consisting of ten people, made up of mostly company outsiders (as is customary for [[publicly traded]] companies). Current members of the [[board of directors]] are: [[Steve Ballmer]], [[James Cash, Jr.]], [[Dina Dublon]], [[Bill Gates]], [[Raymond Gilmartin]], [[Reed Hastings]], [[David Marquardt]], [[Charles Noski]], [[Helmut Panke]], and [[Jon Shirley]].<ref name="MSPR-Board">{{cite press release |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/bod/bod.aspx|title=Microsoft Board of Directors|work=PressPass|publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> The ten board members are elected every year at the annual [[shareholder]]s' meeting, and those who do not get a majority of votes must submit a [[resignation]] to the board, which will subsequently choose whether or not to accept the resignation. There are five committees within the board which oversee more specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues with the company including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Finance Committee, which handles [[financial]] matters such as proposing mergers and acquisitions; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters including nomination of the board; and the Antitrust Compliance Committee, which attempts to prevent company practices from violating [[antitrust]] laws.<ref name="MS-Govern">{{cite web |title=Microsoft Corporation Corporate Governance Guidelines |url=http://www.microsoft.com/about/companyinformation/corporategovernance/guidelines.mspx |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=October 9 |accessyear=2005 }}</ref><ref name="MS-ProxyStmt">{{cite web |title=Microsoft 2005 Proxy Statement |publisher=Microsoft |url=http://www.microsoft.com/msft/reports/proxy2005.mspx |accessdate=2008-08-18 }}</ref>

There are several other aspects to the corporate structure of Microsoft. For worldwide matters there is the Executive Team, made up of sixteen company officers across the globe, which is charged with various duties including making sure employees understand Microsoft's culture of business. The sixteen officers of the Executive Team include the Chairman and [[Software architecture|Chief Software Architect]], the CEO, the [[General Counsel]] and Secretary, the [[CFO]], senior and group vice presidents from the business units, the CEO of the Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions; and the heads of Worldwide Sales, Marketing and Services; [[Human resources|Human Resources]]; and Corporate Marketing. In addition to the Executive Team there is also the Corporate Staff Council, which handles all major staff functions of the company, including approving corporate policies. The Corporate Staff Council is made up of employees from the Law and Corporate Affairs, Finance, Human Resources, Corporate Marketing, and Advanced Strategy and Policy groups at Microsoft. Other [[Executive Officers]] include the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the various product divisions, leaders of the marketing section, and the [[Chief technical officer|CTO]], among others.<ref name="MS-Citizenship">{{cite web |title=Microsoft 2004 Citizenship Report |url=http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/us/default.mspx |publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=October 9 |accessyear=2005 }}</ref><!-- The previous source link is out of date, but it did verify the text as if the access date; needs to be updated or link fixed though--><ref name="2005annual" />

Partly through the work of the [[Gay and Lesbian Employees at Microsoft]] (GLEAM) group, Microsoft added [[gender expression]] to its anti-discrimination policies in April 2005, and the Human Rights Campaign upgraded Microsoft's Corporate Equality Index from its 86% rating in 2004 to its current 100% rating.<ref name="HumanRights-EqIndex">{{cite web |title=Corporate Equality Index: A Report Card on Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Equality in Corporate America |year=2005 |url=http://www.hrc.org/TemplateRedirect.cfm?Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=28841 |publisher=Human Rights Campaign Foundation |accessdate=October 13 |accessyear=2005 |format=PDF }}</ref><ref name="MS-GLEAM">{{cite web |title=Gay and Lesbian Employees at Microsoft (GLEAM) |url=http://www.microsoft.com/about/diversity/programs/dac/gleam.mspx |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref>

Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas make it difficult to hire employees for the company, stating "I'd certainly get rid of the H1B cap."<ref name="MarkRoy">{{cite web |url=http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3500986 |title=Gates Rakes Congress on H1B Visa Cap|author=Roy Mark |publisher=internetnews.com|date=2005-04-27 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

===Logos and slogans===
In 1987, Microsoft adopted its current logo, the so-called "''[[Pac-Man]]'' Logo", designed by Scott Baker. According to the March 1987 ''Computer Reseller News Magazine'', "The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the ''o'' and ''s&nbsp;'' to emphasize the "soft" part of the name and convey motion and speed." Dave Norris, a Microsoft employee, ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter ''O'', nicknamed the ''blibbet'', but it was discarded.<ref name="Osterman2005-07-14">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/07/14/438777.aspx |title=Remember the blibbet |publisher=Larry Osterman's WebLog |author=Larry Osterman |date=July 14, 2005 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

Microsoft's logo with the "''Your potential. Our passion.''" tagline below the main corporate name, is based on the slogan Microsoft had as of 2008. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually started a TV campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of ''"[[Where do you want to go today?]]."''<ref name="wherego1" /><ref name="potentialpassion1" /><ref name="Reimer">{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060123-6031.html |title=Microsoft set to launch new marketing campaign |publisher=Ars Technica |author=Jeremy Reimer |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

==Environmental record==

Microsoft was ranked the 2nd worst company for the environment out of 18 companies rated in Greenpeace's Greener Electronics guide in June, 2008.  It received a score of 2.2/10, ahead only of Nintendo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/company-scores-plummet |title=Company scores plummet in Greener Electronics Guide |publisher=Greenpeace |date=June 25, 2008 |accessdate=2009-07-06}}</ref>

Microsoft has taken actions to become more environmentally friendly.<ref name="news1">[http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-vs.-Google-Whos-greener---page-2/2100-1022_3-6080297-2.html?hhTest=1 Microsoft vs. Google: Who's greener? - CNET News.com]</ref> Some examples include:
*  Microsoft's newest building on its campus in [[Hyderabad, India]] was built as an environmentally friendly structure. Microsoft Research India developed a project called [[Digital Green]] in 2008, which aims to educate farmers in India on how to use azolla - an aquatic fern fed to cows, yielding increased milk production.<ref>''The New York Times'' Microsoft Goes Far Afield to Study Emerging Markets." Vance, Ashlee. Oct. 27, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/India/MSIDC/life/campus.aspx Microsoft India Development Center]</ref>
*Microsoft has phased out the use of [[polyvinyl chloride]] plastic in its packaging material, due to environmental concern, and to match actions by competitors.<ref name=PVC/> Polyvinyl chloride, also referred to as PVC or vinyl, can release toxins into the environment during production and if it is burned after production. These toxins are synthetic chemicals that can be linked to cancer, and issues with the reproductive and immune systems. In six months time, Microsoft was able to eliminate approximately 361,000 pounds of polyvinyl packaging by transitioning to a packaging utilizing [[polyethylene terephthalate]] plastic (PET). The company claims to be examining eco-friendly packaging made of corn starch, sugar, and vegetable oil.<ref name=PVC>[http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-to-phase-out-toxic-plastics/2100-1041_3-5985712.html?hhTest=1 Microsoft to phase out toxic plastics - CNET News.com]</ref> 
* The company has installed over 2,000 [[solar panels]] spanning {{convert|30000|sqft|m2}} on top of its buildings in its Silicon Valley campus.<ref>[http://solar.rain-barrel.net/microsoft-solar/ Microsoft Solar - Solar Times]</ref> These panels supply 480 kilowatts of power, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by the campus and cutting the [[greenhouse gasses]] that would otherwise be produced to supply that power.<ref name="news1"/>
* Microsoft has created one of the worlds largest private bus systems (the "Connector") as mass transit system in the Seattle area.  Employees, interns, vendors and contractors are encouraged to use regional public mass transit with subsidised fares.   For on-campus transportation, the "Shuttle Connect" uses a large fleet of hybrid cars, saving over 20,000 galons of fuel per year.<ref name="news1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/environment/our_commitment/articles/alternative_commuting.aspx |title=Fostering Alternative Ways to Commute at Microsoft |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2009-07-06}}</ref>
* The company uses an irrigation system at its Redmond campus that senses upcoming weather changes, saving 11 million gallons of water per year.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/environment/our_commitment/articles/building_practices.aspx Microsoft Environment :: Microsoft Smart and Sustainable Building Practices]</ref> The company has received a silver certification from the U.S. Green Building Council's [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] program for environmental design.<ref name="news1"/>
* Beginning in June 2008, Microsoft has added compost bins in all cafeterias on its Redmond campus, and replaced all polystyrene plates and cups and plastic flatware with biodegradable alternatives.  In the first two months after this transition, the Redmond campus reduced its non-compost trash output by 50%.

{{main|Criticism of Microsoft}}
<!-- PLEASE DISCUSS BEFORE ADDING STUFF HERE - THIS IS MEANT TO BE A SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ARTICLE -->

=== Anti-competitive ===
Since the 1980s, Microsoft has been the focus of much controversy in the computer industry.<ref name="ecis-ms-history"> {{cite web|url=http://www.ecis.eu/documents/Finalversion_Consumerchoicepaper.pdf |title=Microsoft A History of Anticompetitive Behavior and Consumer Harm |accessdate=2009-05-25 |date=2009-03-31 |format=PDF |publisher=European Committee for Interoperable Systems }}</ref> The majority of criticism has been for its business tactics, often described with the motto "[[embrace, extend and extinguish]]". Microsoft initially embraces a competing standard or product, then extends it to produce their own version which is then incompatible with the standard, which in time extinguishes competition that does not or cannot use Microsoft's new version.<ref name="eee">{{cite web |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-100925.html |title=Intel exec: MS wanted to 'extend, embrace and extinguish' competition |author=Will Rodger |publisher=[[ZDNet]] News |date=1998-11-08 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> These and other tactics have resulted in lawsuits brought by companies and governments, and billions of dollars in rulings against Microsoft.<ref name="Orlowski2004-03-05">{{cite press release |url=http://www.burst.com/new/newsevents/pressrelease007.htm |title=Microsoft Corp.

=== Freedom and privacy ===
[[Free software]] proponents point to the company's joining of the [[Trusted Computing Platform Alliance]] (TCPA) as a cause of concern. A group of companies that seek to implement an initiative called [[Trusted Computing]] (computing in which a computer is not only secured for its owner, but also secured against its owner as well), TCPA is decried by critics as it allows software developers and platform controllers to enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and over how computers behave.<ref>[[Richard Stallman]].

Advocates of free software also take issue with Microsoft's promotion of [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) and [[total cost of ownership]] (TCO) comparisons with its "Get the facts" campaign. Digital Rights Management is a technology that allows content providers to impose restrictions on the methods by which digital media is used on consumer hardware; and subsequently, detractors contend that such technology may infringe on [[fair use]] and other rights, especially given that it restricts legal activities such as re-mixing or reproduction of material for use in slide shows or the [[first-sale doctrine|resale of the goods by the customer]].<ref name="Chisnall">{{cite web |url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=465447&rll=1 |publisher=Informit.com |title=

=== Misrepresentation ===
The "Get the facts" campaign argues that Windows Server has a lower [[total cost of ownership|TCO]] than Linux and lists a variety of studies in order to prove its case.<ref name="MS-GetFacts">{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/compare/default.mspx |title=Get the facts home |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref> Proponents of Linux unveiled their own study arguing that, contrary to one of Microsoft's claims, Linux has lower management costs than Windows Server.<ref name="Jaques">{{cite web |url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2150210/linux-fans-hit-back-microsoft |title=Linux fans hit back at Microsoft TCO claims |author=Robert Jaques |publisher=vnunet.com |date=2006-02-13 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> Another study by the [[Yankee Group]] claims that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a significant fraction (a quarter to a third) of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux, even for large enterprises, and that the other major reasons for a switch away from Windows servers were the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and a chance to escape the Microsoft "lock-in".<ref name="Foley">{{cite news |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070612025517/http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1553727,00.asp|title=Yankee Independently Pits Windows TCO vs. Linux TCO |author=Mary Jo Foley |publisher=eWeek.com |date=2004-03-24 |accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref>

In 2004, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) of the UK warned Microsoft that an ad from the campaign which claimed that "Linux was ... 10 times more expensive than Windows Server 2003", was "misleading", as the hardware chosen for the Linux server was needlessly expensive.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3600724.stm|title = Microsoft's Linux ad 'misleading'|accessdate = 2007-07-25|date = August 26, 2004|publisher = [[BBC News]]}}</ref> The ASA's complaint was that "the measurements for Linux were performed on an [[IBM zSeries]] [mainframe], which was more expensive and did not perform as well as other IBM series." The comparison was to Windows Server 2003 running on two 900 MHz [[Intel Xeon]] CPUs.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://news.com.com/Ad+watchdog+warns+Microsoft+to+'Get+the+Facts'/2100-1016_3-5323672.html|title = Linux 10 times more expensive?

David Meyer writing on Zdnet.com pointed out that, "Microsoft has a long history of applying for, and being granted patents for, inventions that many argue--and can sometimes demonstrate--were based on earlier work carried out by others, or based on a common, self-evident idea."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1%3Cbr%20%3E%3C/a%3E%20&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7,415,666.PN.&OS=PN/7,415%3Cbr%20/%3E%20,666&RS=PN/7,415,666|title=United States Patent concerning "page-up/page-down technology" |publisher=United States Patent Office |date=2008-08-19 |accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref> This was in response to its 2008 patent application for the ability to progress in [[Page Up and Page Down keys|page-up or page-down]] increments with a single keystroke <U+2014> a method that has been pervasive for decades.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2424-9595_22-218626.html|title=Microsoft has been granted a patent on 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' keystrokes. |publisher=ZDNet.co.uk |date=2008-08-29 |accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>
