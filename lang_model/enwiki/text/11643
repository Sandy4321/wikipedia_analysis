'''Marcos Ren<U+00E9> Maidana''' (born 17 July 1983) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] professional [[boxing|boxer]] and the former [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] welterweight champion. He currently has a [[professional boxing|professional]] record of 35<U+2013>4, with his only professional losses coming against [[Andreas Kotelnik]], [[Amir Khan (British boxer)|Amir Khan]], [[Devon Alexander]] and [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]], all by decision. His biggest win was against [[Adrien Broner]] on 14 December 2013, where Maidana handed Broner his first defeat, knocked him down twice and captured his WBA [[Welterweight]] title in the process.

==Professional career==

=== Light Welterweight ===

On February 2, 2009, [[Andreas Kotelnik]] beat Maidana via controversial split decision, with the judges scoring the fight 115-114, 113-115, 115-113 in Kotelnik's favour.

Maidana's first fight in the [[United States]] was against [[Mexican-American]] [[Victor Ort<U+00ED>z]], that took place on June 27, 2009.<ref name="boxrec">http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=257790&cat=boxer</ref> Maidana was knocked down three times within the first two rounds, but rallied and came back to beat Ortiz for the interim WBA super lightweight title with a sixth-round TKO victory.<ref name="boxrec"/>

After his fight with Ortiz, it was rumoured that Maidana would face British boxer, and WBA super lightweight champion, [[Amir Khan (British boxer)|Amir Khan]], who won the title after defeating [[Andreas Kotelnik]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8469411.stm |title=Amir Khan set for US fight debut against Marcos Maidana |work=BBC Sport - Boxing |accessdate=14 April 2010 | date=2010-01-20}}</ref> However, Khan opted for [[Paulie Malignaggi]] as his next opponent. As a result, Maidana was scheduled to fight undefeated Victor Manuel Cayo, whose record, at that time, included 16 knockouts from 24 wins on March 27, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=357688&cat=boxer |title=Professional boxing record of Victor Manuel Cayo |work=BoxRec |accessdate=14 April 2010}}</ref> Maidana knocked out the undefeated Victor Cayo in the sixth round to retain his interim WBA super lightweight title.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/columns/story?columnist=rafael_dan&id=5035739 |title= ESPN - Marcos Maidana KOs Victor Cayo |work=ESPN Boxing |accessdate=14 April 2010}}</ref>

After failing to secure a fight with [[Timothy Bradley]], Maidana fought and defeated DeMarcus Corley in August 2010. Despite knocking Corley down in the 7th round, Maidana had to go the distance for only the fourth time in his career, eventually securing victory via unanimous decision (117-110, 117-110, 115-112).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/maidana-still-champion-58009 |title= Maidana still champion: Has trouble, but beats Corley |work=Fightnews.com |accessdate=29 August 2010}}</ref><ref>http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=257790&cat=boxer</ref>

==== Amir Khan vs. Marcos Maidana ====
{{main|Amir Khan vs. Marcos Maidana}}

Before his fight with Corley, Maidana accused Khan and trainer [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddie Roach]] of "hypocrisy" and called out Khan in an interview: 
{{cquote|I'll go to Khan's home soil to take the other portion of the WBA title, which belongs to me&nbsp;... They say they want me next when the cameras and mics are on. But when it comes to make the fight for real Roach begs [[Golden Boy Promotions]] to keep Khan away from me.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id=30247 |title=Maidana: "Khan, Roach hugging Talking and Fight Me!" |work=BoxingScene.com |accessdate=29 August 2010}}</ref>}}
On September 15, ESPN revealed that both fighters had agreed to fight on December 11 at [[Mandalay Bay]], Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=5577437 |title=Amir Khan, Marcos Maidana finally fight |work=ESPN Boxing |accessdate=16 September 2010}}</ref>

Khan dominated the fight early and knocked down Maidana in the 1st round with a left hook to the liver, but had to withstand a furious barrage by Maidana in round 10, and continually backed up during rounds 11 and 12. Maidana was unable to finish Khan however, who went on to win the fight by unanimous decision.<ref>http://www.boxingnews24.com/2010/12/khan-looks-shaky-in-beating-maidana/</ref><ref>http://www.boxingnews24.com/2010/12/joe-cortez-to-referee-khan-vs-maidana-fight/</ref> The fight was awarded the [[Harry Markson Award|Boxing Writers Association of America Award]] for [[Fight of the Year]].<ref>[http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12183_6702125,00.html Amir scoops American honour], [[Sky Sports]]</ref>

==== Erik Morales vs. Marcos Maidana ====
{{main|Erik Morales vs. Marcos Maidana}}

In the first round against [[Erik Morales]], Maidana came out with ferocity as expected and proceeded to batter his older opponent around the ring. He landed multiple power punches, including an uppercut that opened a huge swelling over Morales' left eye which worsened over the course of the fight, and when the Mexican walked back to his corner having taken a large amount of punishment in the opening three minutes most observers felt their predictions were being fulfilled. The one-sided nature of the bout continued for the next couple of rounds, but then at the end of the third round Morales begin to fight back and landed a hard combination to the head of Maidana and the tide began to turn.

From the fourth round onwards and although he was effectively fighting with one eye, Morales gave as good as he got and was landing the cleaner more effective shots, albeit occasionally being swarmed by the sheer number of punches being landed in return by the relentless Maidana. The fight became a see-saw affair and then, in the eighth round, Morales hit Maidana with a huge left hook that almost stopped the Argentinian. The next couple of rounds continued in this fashion, with Maidana using his strength and stamina to bully Morales and the Mexican using his sharper punching and ring intelligence to land effective counters and combinations. The fight was fast turning into a modern classic.

In the "championship rounds" (the eleventh and twelfth), Morales seemed to tire and Maidana took advantage, overwhelming him with his strength and punishing the ageing warrior continually to the head and body. Maidana finished the fight much the stronger of the two and his late surge gave him the win on the scorecards, 116-112 twice with the third judge scoring the fight a draw, 114-114.

Maidana was scheduled to defend his title Aug. 27 against Robert Guerrero, but Guerrero suffered a shoulder injury less than two weeks before the fight. Maidana's fought [[Petr Petrov]] of Russia on Sept. 23 instead, winning by fourth round knockout.<ref>http://www.badlefthook.com/2011/9/23/2445881/maidana-vs-petrov-results-tko-4-win-maidana-no-trouble-argentina</ref>

=== Welterweight ===
On February 25, 2012 Maidana moved up to welterweight and fought [[Devon Alexander]] who was also moving up in weight. Maidana clearly seemed uncomfortable in his first fight at the new weight as Alexander dominated the fight and went on to win a lopsided unanimous decision. 
In his first fight following the Alexander loss, Maidana defeated [[Jesus Soto Karass]] on September 15, 2012 by eighth round TKO in a back-and-forth slugfest.<ref>http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/8382678/marcos-maidana-wins-bitter-brawl-jesus-soto-karras</ref>

Maidana then fought the largely unknown Angel Martinez on December 12, 2012. Maidana won the fight by KO in the third round.

Maidana scored a TKO over welterweight contender [[Josesito Lopez]] in the sixth round of a June 9, 2013 fight. Maidana had injured his hip in the second round and Lopez capitalized tagging his opponent with hard shots. Maidana was able to reverse the tide and hurt Lopez with an overhand right in the sixth round that dropped him to the canvas.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2013/06/09/marcos-maidana-stops-josesito-lopez-in-6th-round/2404791/ | work=USA Today | first=Mike | last=Coppinger | title=Marcos Maidana stops Josesito Lopez in 6th round | date=2013-06-09}}</ref>

==== Adrien Broner vs. Marcos Maidana ====
On December 14, 2013, Marcos Maidana defeated the heavily favored [[Adrien Broner]] after 12 rounds via unanimous decision to win the WBA Welterweight title. Maidana dropped the previously unbeaten Broner in the second and eighth rounds and won by comfortable margins on all three judges scorecards, 115-110, 116-109, 117-110. Maidana was a 3/1 underdog entering this fight.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2013/12/14/adrien-broner-marcos-maidana-wba-welterweight-title-san-antonio-alamodome-showtime/4028013/ | work=USA Today | first1=Bob | last1=Velin | title=Marcos Maidana stuns Adrien Broner for welterweight belt | date=2013-12-14}}</ref> He has now won four consecutive fights under the tutelage of boxing trainer [[Robert Garcia (American boxer)|Robert Garcia]].
