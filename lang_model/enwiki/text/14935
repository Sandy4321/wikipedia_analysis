==Before The Beatles==
{{Main|The Quarrymen|Jim and Mary McCartney}}
On 6 July 1957, when he was aged fifteen, McCartney met Lennon and [[The Quarrymen]] at the [[Woolton]] (St. Peter's church hall) f<U+00EA>te.<ref name="SpitzPage93">Spitz (2005), p93.</ref> At the start of their friendship, Lennon's [[Aunt Mimi]] disapproved of McCartney because he was, she said, "[[working class]]", and called him "John's little friend".<ref name="MilesPage44">Miles (1998), p44.</ref> McCartney's father told his son that Lennon would get him "into trouble", although he later allowed The Quarrymen to rehearse in the front room at 20 Forthlin Road.<ref name="MilesPage32-38">Miles (1998), pp32-38.</ref><ref name="ForthlinRoadSite">{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-20forthlinroadallerton/ |title=Inside ForthlinRoad |publisher= nationaltrust.org.uk |accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref>

McCartney formed a close working relationship with Lennon and they collaborated on many songs. He convinced Lennon to allow Harrison to join The Quarrymen (Lennon thought Harrison was too young) after Lennon heard Harrison play at a rehearsal in March 1958.<ref name=" SpitzPage126-127">Spitz (2005), pp126-127.</ref> Harrison joined the group as [[lead guitarist]], followed by Lennon's [[art school]] friend, [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], on bass, although McCartney was later dismissive about Sutcliffe's musical ability.<ref name="MilesPage47-50">Miles (1998), pp47-50.</ref><ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnPage94">Cynthia Lennon (2006), p94.</ref> By May 1960, they had tried several new names, including [[The Quarrymen|The Silver Beetles]]; playing a tour of Scotland under that name with [[Larry Parnes|Johnny Gentle]]. They finally changed the name of the group to The Beatles for their performances in [[Hamburg]].<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnPage67">Cynthia Lennon (2006), p67.</ref><ref>Coleman, Ray (1984).

[[Image:Indra-Club-Hamburg.png|right|thumb|The Indra Club, Hamburg, where the Beatles first played]]
Starting in May 1960, The Beatles were managed by [[Allan Williams]], who booked them into [[Bruno Koschmider]]'s Indra club in [[Hamburg]]. The Beatles first played at the Indra club, sleeping in small, "dirty" rooms in the [[Bruno Koschmider|Bambi Kino]], and then moved (after the closure of the Indra) to the larger [[Kaiserkeller]].<ref name="MilesPage57-58">Miles (1998), pp57-8.</ref> In October 1960, they left Koschmider's club and worked at the "Top Ten Club", which was run by Peter Eckhorn.<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnPage93">Cynthia Lennon (2006), p93.</ref><ref name="MilesPage71-72">Miles (1998), pp. 71<U+2013>72.</ref> When McCartney and [[Pete Best]] went back to the Bambi Kino to get their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, they found a [[condom]], attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of their room, and set fire to it. There was no real damage, but Koschmider reported them for attempted [[arson]]. McCartney and Best spent three hours in a local jail and were deported, as was Harrison, for working under the legal age limit.<ref name="MilesPage72-73">Miles (1998), pp72-73.</ref>

The group reunited in December 1960, and on 21 March 1961, played their first of many concerts at Liverpool's [[Cavern club]].<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnp84">Cynthia Lennon (2006), p84.</ref><ref name="Page80">Lewisohn (2002), p80.</ref> McCartney realised that other Liverpool bands were playing the same cover songs, which prompted him and Lennon to write more original material.<ref name="MilesPage81-82">Miles (1998), pp81-82.</ref> The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, and recorded "[[My Bonnie]]" with [[Tony Sheridan]].<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnp97">Cynthia Lennon (2006), p97.</ref> Sutcliffe left the band after the end of their contract, so McCartney reluctantly took over [[bass guitar|bass]].<ref name="MilesPage74">Miles (1998), p74.</ref> After borrowing Sutcliffe's H<U+00F6>fner 500/5 model for a short time, he bought a left-handed 1962 500/1 model [[H<U+00F6>fner]] bass.<ref name="BabiukPage49">Babiuk. pp 49-50.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanteen.com/mccartney2.html |title=Rosetti Solid 7 |publisher=thecanteen.com |accessdate=2006-12-14}}</ref> On 1 October 1961, McCartney went with Lennon (who paid for the trip) to [[Paris]] for two weeks.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp99">Cynthia Lennon (2006), p99.</ref>

The Beatles were first seen by [[Brian Epstein]] at the [[Cavern club]] on 9 November 1961, and he later signed them to a management contract.<ref name="MilesPage85">Miles (1998), p85.</ref> The Beatles' [[road manager]], [[Neil Aspinall]], drove them to London on 31 December 1961, where they auditioned the next day, but were rejected by [[Decca Records]].<ref name="MilesPage89">Miles (1998), p89.</ref> In April 1962, they went back to Hamburg to play at the [[Star-Club]], and learned of [[Stuart Sutcliffe|Stuart Sutcliffe's]] death a few hours before they arrived.<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnp109">Cynthia Lennon (2006), p109.</ref> The Beatles were ready to sign a record contract on 9 May 1962, with [[Parlophone]] Records<U+2014>after having been rejected by many record companies<U+2014>but Epstein sacked Pete Best (at the behest of McCartney, Lennon and Harrison; Best's replacement was [[Richard Starkey]], whose stage name was [[Ringo Starr]], from [[Rory Storm and the Hurricanes]], although he had already performed, occasionally, with the Beatles in Hamburg) before they signed the contract.<ref name="Spitzp330">Spitz (2005), p330.</ref> "[[Love Me Do]]" was released on 5 October 1962, featuring McCartney singing solo on the chorus line.<ref name="MilesPage91">Miles (1998), p91.</ref> Over the course of the next two years, McCartney and his band mates would rise from relative obscurity to international stardom, an unprecedented feat at that time for a rock-music combo.

Lennon, Harrison, and Starr lived in large houses in the '[[stockbroker belt]]' of southern England,<ref name="MilesPage166-167">Miles (1998), pp166-167.</ref> but McCartney continued to live in central London: in Jane Asher's parents' house, and then at 7 Cavendish Avenue, [[St John's Wood]], near the [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name="MilesPage166-167"/> It was at Cavendish Avenue that McCartney bought his first [[Old English Sheepdog]], Martha, whose name ostensibly inspired the song "[[Martha My Dear]]", but which is actually about the end of McCartney and Asher's relationship.

McCartney often went to nightclubs alone, which offered 'dining and dancing until 4:00 a.m.' and featured [[cabaret]] acts.<ref name="MilesPage129">Miles (1998), p129.</ref> McCartney would get preferential treatment everywhere he went, which he readily accepted.<ref name="MilesPage130-131">Miles (1998), pp130-131.</ref> He even once accepted an offer from a [[Policing in the United Kingdom|policeman]] to be allowed to park McCartney's car.<ref name="MilesPage129"/> He later visited [[gambling]] clubs after 4:00am, such as 'The Curzon House', and often saw Epstein there.<ref name="MilesPage131">Miles (1998), p131.</ref> The [[Ad Lib]] club (above the Prince Charles Theatre at 7 Leicester Place) was later opened for the emerging 'Rock and Roll' crowd of musicians, and tolerated their unusual lifestyle.<ref name="MilesPage132-133">Miles (1998), pp132-133.</ref> After the Ad Lib fell out of favour, McCartney moved on to the [[Scotch of St James]], at 13 Masons Yard.<ref name="MilesPage134">Miles (1998), p134.</ref> He also frequented [[The Bag O'Nails]] club at 8 Kingly Street in [[Soho]], [[London]], where he met [[Linda Eastman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3023903.stm |title=The Bag o<U+2019>Nails |date=13 May 2003 |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref><ref name="Wingspandvd">Wingspan, DVD, Catalogue number: 4779109, 19 November 2001 </ref>

On 31 June 1965, The Beatles were appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Members of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE);<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=43667|supp=yes|startpage=5488|date=4 June 1965|accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref> they received their insignia from [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] at an [[investiture]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 26 October 1965.

McCartney later attempted to persuade Lennon and Harrison to return to the stage, and when they had a meeting to sign a new contract with [[Capitol Records]], McCartney suggested "going back to our roots," to which Lennon replied, "I think you're mad!"<ref name="WingspanPage9">Wingspan (2001), p9.</ref> Although Lennon had quit the group in September 1969, and Harrison and Starr had temporarily left the group at various times, McCartney was the one who publicly announced [[The Beatles' breakup]] on 10 April 1970<U+2014>one week before releasing his first solo album, ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]''.<ref name="SpitzPage858">Spitz (2005), p858.</ref> The album included a press release inside with a self-written interview stating McCartney's hopes about the future.

==After The Beatles==
After the breakup of The Beatles, McCartney started to be called "Macca" as a nickname.<ref name="MaccasABlue">{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/macca-s-a-blue.html |title=Macca's a blue |accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref> Since 1970 he has continued to work in popular music, both with solo work and in a number of collaborations, including the group [[Wings (band)|Wings]] which was active between 1971 and 1981 with numerous successful singles and albums (see [[#Discography|discography]]).

The following year, McCartney released ''[[Spies Like Us]]'' the title song to the Dan Ackroyd/Chevy Chase comedy which hit #7 on the Billboard chart (making it his last US Top 20 hit to date) and #24 in Canada.  On 13 July 1985, McCartney played "Let It Be" at the [[Live Aid]] concert in [[London]], but much of his performance was marred by technical difficulties.  He was backed on this performance by [[Bob Geldof]], [[Pete Townshend]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Alison Moyet]].

In the second half of the decade McCartney would find new collaborators. [[Eric Stewart]] had appeared on McCartney's ''[[Pipes of Peace]]'' album,<ref>Pipes of Peace, 9 August 1993, Catalogue number: CDP 89267</ref> and he co-wrote most of McCartney's 1986 album ''[[Press to Play]]''. The album and its lead single, "[[Press (song)|Press]]", became minor hits.<ref>Press to Play, 9 August 1993, Catalogue number: CDP7892692</ref> McCartney returned the favour by co-writing two songs for Stewart's band, [[10cc]]: "Don't Break the Promises" (''[[...Meanwhile]]'', 1992), and "Yvonne's the One" (''[[Mirror Mirror (10cc album)|Mirror Mirror]]'', 1995). In 1987, [[EMI]] released [[All the Best!]] which was the first compilation of McCartney's own songs.

In 1988, he released, initially in the Soviet Union only, ''[[<U+0421><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430> <U+0432> <U+0421><U+0421><U+0421><U+0420>]]'', a collection of McCartney cover-versions of his favourite vintage Rock and roll classics which later had a general release in 1991. Around this time, McCartney also began a songwriting partnership with [[Elvis Costello]] (Declan MacManus)<ref name="Costello">{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/sunsetstrip/amphitheatre/4512/costello.html |title=Costello on McCartney |publisher=geocities.com/sunsetstrip |accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref> from which songs would appear on singles and albums by both artists, notably "[[Veronica (song)|Veronica]]"on Costello's album ''[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]'' and  "[[My Brave Face]]" from McCartney's ''[[Flowers in the Dirt]]'', (which reached #1 in the UK on release in 1989).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geetarz.org/reviews/beatles/macca_collaboration.htm |title=McCartney and Costello collaborations |publisher=geetarz.org |accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref> Further McCartney/MacManus compositions for surfaced on Costello's 1991 album ''[[Mighty Like a Rose]]'' and McCartney's 1993 album ''[[Off the Ground]]''.

In the early 1990s (after another world tour), McCartney, Harrison and Starr worked together on [[Apple Corps|Apple's]] ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' documentary series. It included three double albums of alternative takes, live recordings, and previously unreleased Beatles songs, as well as a ten-hour video boxed set. ''[[Anthology 1]]'' was released in 1995, and featured "[[Free as a Bird]]", which was the first Beatles reunion track, while [[Anthology 2]], released in 1996, included "[[Real Love (John Lennon song)|Real Love]]" (1996), the second and final in the reunion series. Both reunion tracks were co produced by [[Electric Light Orchestra]] frontman [[Jeff Lynne]], who had worked with Harrison in The [[Traveling Wilburys]]. Both reunion tracks were completed by adding new music and vocal tracks to Lennon's [[Demo (music)|demos]] from the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,13887,1569834,00.html |title=Macca beyond Interview |date=2005-09-18 |publisher=observer.guardian.co.uk |accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref>

In 1997, McCartney released ''[[Flaming Pie]]''. The album garnered the best reviews for a McCartney album since ''Tug of War''. It debuted at #2 in the UK and the US, and was nominated in the category [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the 1998 [[Grammy Awards]]. In 1999, McCartney released another album of rock 'n' roll songs, titled ''[[Run Devil Run]]''.

On 13 November 2005, McCartney played a live concert at the [[Arrowhead Pond]] in [[Anaheim, CA]]. Towards the end of the concert, a satellite link-up was made to the [[International Space Station]] so McCartney and those at the concert could see [[NASA]] Astronaut [[Bill McArthur]] and Russian Cosmonaut [[Valery Tokarev]] as they were awakening for the 44th day of their six month mission in space. McCartney proceeded to play the traditional wakeup song played on each space mission, a tradition that began during the moon missions. McCartney also performed "[[Good Day Sunshine]]", and "English Tea". Afterwards he and the concert goers talked with McArthur and Tokarev via a projection screen. This was the first time a live concert had been linked to a U.S. spacecraft.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/nov/HQ_05406_mccartney_wakeup.html}}</ref>

McCartney later noted, in between his solo set of "Fine Line" and "Helter Skelter", that it was the first time he had performed at the Grammys and quipped, "I finally passed the audition," which was a reference to the Lennon comment at the end of the ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'' film: "I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves and I hope we passed the audition."<ref name="SpitzPage817">Spitz (2005), p817.</ref>

The performance went 53 minutes past the midnight curfew, costing McCartney $1000 per minute.

On 1 June 2009, McCartney appeared onstage with Ringo Starr at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] gaming convention after Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison had appeared.
