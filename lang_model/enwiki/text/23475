'''Le Havre''' is a city in the northwest region of [[France]] situated on the right bank of the mouth of the [[Seine River]]. It is a commune in the [[Seine-Maritime]] department and the [[Haute-Normandie]] region. The inhabitants of the city are called ''Havrais'' or ''Havraises''. It is the most populous commune in the Haute-Normandie region and the largest sub-prefecture in France. It is also a bishop's [[Episcopal see|see]]. 

''Le Havre'' is also used in the sense of "port". The city was first called ''Franciscopolis'', in homage to King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], who took the initiative to construct the city, in addition to ''Le Havre'' (or ''Le Hable'') ''de Gr<U+00E2>ce'', the latter term being derived from the chapel ''Notre-Dame-de-Gr<U+00E2>ce'', which existed on the site before the city's founding. 

The city was also dubbed the ''Porte Oc<U+00E9>ane'', or ''Door to the Ocean''. Architecturally, this image has been revived through the "door" that forms the frame at either end of Fochs Avenue, which comes out of the sea. In population, Le Havre ranks second of the French ports, first of the cities in Normandy, and ranks second in the metro areas of Haute-Normandie. 

Le Havre was honored with the [[Legion of Honor]] award on [[July 18]], [[1949]].

[[UNESCO]] declared the city center of Le Havre a [[World Heritage Site]] on [[July 15]], [[2005]], in honoring the "innovative utilization of concrete's potential." The 133-hectare space that represents, according to UNESCO, "an exceptional example of architecture and town planning of the post-war era," is one of the rare contemporary World Heritage Sites in Europe.

Le Havre was once synonymous with urban coldness and grayness. The city's inhabitants have done much to change this, and it has been marked by improvement since then. The city is spoken of now as the [[Brasilia]] of France.  {{Fact|date=February 2008}}.

Le Havre's [[home port]] code is [[LH]].

==Geography==
Le Havre is a [[subprefecture]], the largest in France, and the administrative center of the district bordering the [[Sainte-Adresse]] commune. 

===Location===
Le Havre is situated in the southwest of the [[Pays de Caux]] region. The city is surrounded by the seashore of the [[English Channel]] to the west, the mouth of the Seine to the south, and the coast to the north. The Seine has, for a long time, marked a natural border between [[Haute-Normandie]] and [[Basse-Normandie]]. Thus, the city of [[Honfleur]] is, in the expression of the ''Havrais'', "on the other coast." In order to face the city's relative enclosure, the city's connections have multiplied : the most prestigious connection is the [[Pont de Normandie]], which connects the two banks of the Seine, and reduces traveling time between Honfleur and Le Havre to less than a quarter-hour.

===Geography===
Le Havre is naturally separated into two areas by a [[cliff]]. The ''ville basse'', or low city, is composed of the port, the city center, and the peripheral regions. It was constructed upon the ancient [[marshlands]] which were drained in the 16th century. The soil is composed of [[alluvium]] deposited by the river Seine. The city center, reconstructed after [[World War II]], lies on approximately a meter (3.3 ft) of flattened rubble. The ''ville haute'', or high city, is composed of wealthy, average and unfavorable residential suburbs ([[Mont-Gaillard]], [[Caucriauville]], and [[Mare-Rouge]]). The north-west region of the high city ([[Sainte-Adresse]] and [[Dollemard]]) is the highest in altitude (between 90 and 115 meters.) The cape of La H<U+00E8>ve is situated at an altitude of approximately 100 meters.

==Governance==
Le Havre is a [[commune in France|commune]] and a ''[[sous-pr<U+00E9>fecture]]'' of the [[Seine-Maritime]] ''[[d<U+00E9>partement in France|d<U+00E9>partement]]''. Le Havre is the largest commune in both the [[Haute-Normandie]] region and the Seine-Maritime department, yet is the capital or ''pr<U+00E9>fecture'' of neither, both honors belonging to [[Rouen]]. (The only other city in [[metropolitan France]] in a similar situation is the city of [[Reims]].) In its support, Rouen does have many more large [[suburb]]s than does Le Havre, making its [[metropolitan area]] much more populous than Le Havre's.

The current mayor of Le Havre is Antoine Rufenacht.

==Demographics==
The population of the Le Havre commune had 190,905 inhabitants in 1999, which makes it the 12th most populated city in [[France]] and the most populated in [[Haute-Normandie]]. It has seen a drop in population, particularly from 1975 to 1982; during these years of industrial crisis the population fell by 18,494. During the 1980s the population continued to decrease, though less rapidly. Le Havre's city limit had a population of 248,547 in 1999 (25th in France) and the urban area had a population of 296,773. With 20% of the population less than 20 years old, the city of Le Havre is relatively young, even though the population is shrinking. The foreign-born population is estimated at 8,208, 4.3% of the population, with a tendency to diminish, as well. Due to the economic changes that had affected the city, the [[CSP]] greatly evolved in the 1980s; between 1982 and 1999, the number of blue-collar workers decreased by a third (10,593). At the same time, the number of office workers and professionals has increased by 24.5%, which partly explains the creation and development of the [[University of Le Havre]].

==History==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=February 2008}}
The city was founded in 1517, when it was named ''Franciscopolis'' after [[Francis I of France]], and subsequently named '''Le Havre-de-Gr<U+00E2>ce''' ("Harbor of Grace"; hence [[Havre de Grace, Maryland]]). ''Le Havre'' simply means ''the harbour'' or ''the port''. Its construction was ordered to replace the ancient harbours of [[Honfleur]] and [[Harfleur]] whose utility had decreased due to silting. The history of the city is inextricably linked to its harbour. In the 18th century, as trade from the [[West Indies]] was added to that of France and Europe, Le Havre began to grow.  On [[19 November]] 1793, the city changed its name to H<U+00E2>vre de Marat and later H<U+00E2>vre-Marat in honor of the recently deceased [[Jean-Paul Marat]], who was seen as a martyr of the [[French Revolution]].  By early 1795, however, Marat's memory had become somewhat tarnished, and on January 13, 1795, H<U+00E2>vre-Marat changed its name once more to simply Le Havre, its modern name.

During the 19th century, it became an industrial centre.  The German-seized city was devastated during the [[Battle of Normandy]] in World War II: 5,000 people were killed and 12,000 homes were totally destroyed, mainly by British air attacks. Despite this, Le Havre became the location of one of the biggest Replacement Depots, or "Repple Depples" in the European Theatre of operations in WWII.  Thousands of American replacement troops poured through the city before being deployed to combat operations.<ref>Ambrose, Stephen.  ''Citizen Soldiers'', p 274-277.  </ref> After the war, the center was rebuilt in [[Modernism|modernist]] style by [[Auguste Perret]]. It was designated a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2005.
