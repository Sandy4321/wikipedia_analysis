The [[Republic of China Air Force|Republic of China (Taiwan) Air Force]]'s '''AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo''' (<U+7D93><U+570B>) is a light fighter aircraft named after the late ROC President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]].  It entered active service in [[1994 in aviation|1994]], and 131 production aircrafts were manufactured by 1999. 

Although named and commonly known as the '''Indigenous Defence Fighter''' (IDF), the project was a joint effort between Taiwanese (ROC) and [[United States|U.S.]] Defense companies, with final assembly by the [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation]] (based in [[Taichung]], in the ROC).  The IDF program started when purchase of the [[F-20 Tigershark]] ran into political problems.

==History and Background==
The preliminary search for the [[Republic of China Air Force|ROCAF]]'s F-5 and F-104 replacement began with the indigenous fighter project [[XF-6]] (later renamed "Ying Yang") in the late 1970s.  After the U.S. established formal relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] and ended the Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan, President [[Chiang Ching-Kuo]] decided to expand the indigenous defense industry and ordered the [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation|AIDC]] to design an indigenous high-speed interceptor on August 28th, 1980.  Originally the ROCAF listed the priority of the XF-6 behind the [[XA-3]] "Lei Ming" attack aircraft, due to the high risks of the XF-6 project.<ref>{{cite book | author = Hua Hsi-Chun | title = Fighter's Sky | publisher = Commonwealth publishing | year = 1999 | language = Chinese}}</ref>

The signing of 1982 US-[[PRC]] [[Three Communiques|Joint Communiqu<U+00E9>]], which would limit arms sale to Taiwan, effectively ended the possibility of the ROCAF obtaining either [[F-16]]s or [[F-20]]s, therefore ensuring the continuation of the indigenous fighter project.  Although U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] reluctantly accepted his advisers' suggestion of building relations with the [[PRC]] to counter the [[USSR]], Reagan decided to balance the 1982 US-PRC Communiqu<U+00E9> with "[[Six Assurances]]" to Taiwan.  This opened the door for covert US technology transfer and assistance to Taiwan's defense industry, including the IDF project.

==Development==
[[Image:IDF Pre-production.jpg|thumb|Pre-production F-CK-1A model.]] 

The [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation|AIDC]] officially began the IDF development project in 1982 following the ROCAF's failure to purchase new fighters from the United States as a result of the [[PRC]]'s diplomatic pressure. The project was named "An Hsiang" and divided into four sections in 1983:

*Ying-Yang (<U+9DF9><U+63DA>): "Soaring Eagle".  Development of the [[fuselage|airframe]]. Cooperation with [[General Dynamics]].
*Yun-Han (<U+96F2><U+6F22>): "Galaxy".  Development of the aircraft powerplant and propulsion. Cooperation with [[Garrett Systems|Garrett]] (Now [[Honeywell]]).
*Tien-Lei (<U+5929><U+96F7>): "Sky Thunder".  Development of the avionics system. Cooperation with Smiths Industries, with some components purchased directly from [[Lear Astronics]] (later [[BAE Systems|BAE]]), [[Litton Industries|Litton]] (later [[Northrop Grumman]]), and [[Martin-Baker]]. 
*Tien-Chien (<U+5929><U+528D>): "Sky Sword".  Development of air-to-air missiles.

The IDF was designed to counter the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]]'s [[Shenyang J-8|J-8]], [[Chengdu J-7|J-7]], and newer fighters such as the [[Nanchang J-12|J-12]], with the intention to have performance on par with the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] and the [[Dassault-Breguet Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]]. The greatest difficulties were encountered by the propulsion group in attempting to develop or acquire suitable advanced jet engines.  There is also speculation that the use of weaker engines was due to political rather than technical reasons, namely that U.S. did not want to see Taiwan to provoke the [[PRC]] and thus mandated the IDF to have a "range no greater than [[Northrop F-5|F-5E]]" and "ground attack capability no greater than the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]]".  Regardless of the reason, many people consider the F-CK-1 to be somewhat underpowered, meaning that the performances are not as substantial as other ROCAF fighters (i.e [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] Block 20).

=== Yun Han: Engine Research ===

Exports of more advanced engines such as the [[General Electric F404]] or the [[Pratt & Whitney F100]] weren't available to Taiwan.  Both the [[General Electric J85]] and [[General Electric J79]] weren't suitable in performance, and most European / American engine companies declined to cooperate with Taiwan.  Joint investment with [[Garrett Systems|Garrett]] became the only realistic solution.

In 1978, following the success of the [[Honeywell TFE731|TFE-731]] engine, U.S. engine company [[Garrett Systems|Garrett]] announced joint research of the TFE-1042 afterburner with Swedish company [[Volvo Aero|Volvo Flygmotor AB]].  The TFE-731 Model 1042 was touted as a low bypass ratio "military derivative of the proven commercial TFE 731 engine" and "provides efficient, reliable, cost effective propulsion for the next generation of light strike and advanced trainer aircraft", with thrust of 4260 lb (dry) and 6790 lb (with afterburner).  After the initial negotiation, the investment was going to be divided between [[Garrett Systems|Garrett]], Volvo, [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation|AIDC]], and Italian company Piaggio.  The development would consist of the non-afterburning TFE-1042-6 for light attack aircraft/advanced trainer, and the TFE-1042-7 for the [[AMX International AMX|AMX]] or the [[Northrop F-5|F-5]] upgrade.  The [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation|AIDC]] also suggested upgrading the TFE-1042-7 to 8000 lb thrust as twin engine solution, in order to compete with the GE [[F404]].  However the [[Gripen|JAS39]] project decided to continue with the single engine solution [[F404]], and Piaggio asked to participate at a later date due to financial reasons.  Thus only [[Garrett Systems|Garrett]] and the [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation|AIDC]] invested in the new [[International Turbine Engine Corporation]](ITEC), with the contract signed in 1982.

The engine requirements changed after the IDF's role shifted from the high-speed interceptor to air superiority fighter at the end of 1982.  The ITEC completely redesigned the TFE-1042-7 into the TFE-1042-70 (For example, bypass ratio was changed from 0.84 to 0.4), and the investment had increased from USD 1.8 billion to about USD 3.2 billion.  However, to avoid pressures from the PRC, the United States government had asked all the U.S. companies cooperating with Taiwan on the IDF project to remain low-key.  Therefore the perception that "the TFE-1042 is merely the civilian engine TFE-731 with an afterburner" was never completely dispelled.

In 1985, the preliminary review of IDF design revealed some performance requirement shortfalls, and it was determined that upgrade of 10% engine thrust was the simplest solution.  Due to the U.S. export license restrictions, the ITEC used [[FADEC]] to artificially limit the thrust below certain height (the restriction was not removed until 1990).  Although the upgrade essentially used the TFE-1088-11 configuration, to reduce political interference the ITEC renamed the original lower thrust version as the TFE-1042-X70 and retained the TFE-1042-70 designation for the new upgraded version.  
     
In 1988, the ITEC decided to invest in the 12000 lb TFE-1088-12, which was re-designated as the TFE-1042-70A (for political reason as well).  The preliminary study had shown that the IDF could supersonic cruise with the new engine.  At the same time, [[General Electric|GE]] decided to enter the market with the J101/SF, a smaller version of the [[General Electric F404|F404]].  However after the IDF order was cut in half due to budget concerns, the TFE-1088-12 engine upgrade plan ended as well <ref>{{cite book | last = Hua | first = Hsi-Chun | title = Story of Yun Han | year = 1997 | publisher = China Productivity Center | language=Chinese}}</ref>.  Since then, there are many rumors of the [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation|AIDC]] completing engine upgrade research in private.  However, the ROCAF and the [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation|AIDC]] never officially annunced any IDF fleet engine upgrade.

=== Ying Yang: Aerodynamic Design ===

The cooperation between the [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation|AIDC]] and [[General Dynamics]] was divided into four phases: 1.  [[General Dynamics|GD]] would analyze the ROCAF aircraft performance and force requirements.  2.  Taiwan would assess [[General Dynamics|GD]] report and select [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation|AIDC]]'s original design or [[General Dynamics|GD]]'s new design.  3.  The AIDC would send personnel to [[General Dynamics|GD]] for preliminary design.  4.  [[General Dynamics|GD]] would send personnel to Taiwan to complete the project.  It should also be noted that [[General Dynamics|GD]]'s assistance was restricted by the U.S. State Department's arms export control, which limited [[General Dynamics|GD]]'s  work to initial design consulting but not further development, production, or marketing.

Many different airframe design concepts were explored (i.e. the 2D Thrust-Vectoring nozzle of XX-201, the double delta wings / twin tailed 401).  After the [[General Electric J79|J79]] was officially abandoned as potential solution in 1983, three configurations emerged from [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation|AIDC]].  Configuration A was similar to the [[Northrop F-5|F-5E]].  Configuration B was similar to the [[Eurofighter Typhoon|EFA]] / [[Gripen|JAS39]].  Configuration C was similar to the [[F-15]].  At the same time, [[General Dynamics|GD]] worked on the G configuration in parallel.  Eventually the G-4 was selected, but with many features of the C-2 integrated.  During this time, the project was named the "Light Weight Defense Fighter".  In 1985, the configuration conceptual design had evolved into the SE-1 preliminary design.  By the end of 1985, the [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation|AIDC]] decided to skip the prototype stage and go into Full Scale Development (FSD) directly, in order to reduce time and save money.  The project was again renamed into the "Indigenous Defense Fighter".  Four FSD aircraft were made, with three single-seaters and one double-seater <ref name = "yangpaochih">{{cite book | last = Yang | first = Pao-Chih | title = Soaring Eagle: A Development Story of Taiwan's Indigenous Defense Fighter | publisher = Yun Hao Publishing| language=Chinese}}</ref>.

=== Tien Lei:  Avionics Integration ===
The IDF is equipped with the GD-53 (Golden Dragon) multi-mode pulse-Doppler radar, which is based on the [[General Electric]] AN/AGP-67(V) developed for the [[F-20]].  Because of the inherently unstability pitch design, the IDF incorporated a modern triple-redundant full authority fly-by-wire control system.  The avionics suite was based on modular architecture with dual redundant MIL-STD-1553B digital MUX bus.  The Honeywell H423 [[Inertial navigation system|INS]], the TWS-95 RHAWS, and the Bendix-King [[HUD]] were selected. <ref name = "jonlake">{{cite book | last = Lake | first = Jon | title = Ching-Kuo: The Indigenous Defence Fighter, WAPJ Vol. 26 | publisher = Aerospace Publishing Ltd}}</ref>.  It is rumored that some capabilities were delayed or dropped in ordered to meet the performance requirement, since the engine limitation has resulted in necessity of weight control.

=== Tien Chien:  Missile R&D ===
The [[CSIST]]'s Tien Chien project was slightly more independent, since it was considered by some officials to be a development for all the ROCAF aircrafts rather than the IDF only.  The Tien Chien 1 (TC-1) is a short range IR missile similar to the AIM-9 external configuration.  The Tien Chien 2 (TC-2) is an active radar homing Beyond Visual Range missile claimed to be in the AIM-120 class.

The first test firing of the TC-1 was made by the F-5E in April 1986, with the Beech target drone successfully destroyed.  Initial production of the TC-1 began in 1989, and entered service in 1991.  Both the AIM-9 and the TC-1 appeared on operational IDFs <ref name="jonlake"/>.  The production quantity is unknown.

The CSIST is believed to have cooperated with [[Motorola]] on the active seeker, likely based on the [[Motorola]] design that participated in the AIM-120 competition but weren't selected by the United States.  40 pre-production TC-2s were produced in response to the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis, as part of many emergency measures.  210 production TC-2s are planned.  The production status and timeline is unknown.

== Variants and Versions ==
=== F-CK-1 A/B "An Hsiang" ===

The first successful test flight (FSD A1) was made on May 28th, 1989.  The twin-seater(FSD B1) conducted its first flight on July 10th, 1990. <ref>{{cite web | title = IDF Ching-Kuo Fighter Product Introduction | publisher = [[AIDC]] | accessdate = 2006-10-15 | url=http://www.aidc.com.tw/AIDCsite/twn4/twn4_1a.htm | language=Chinese}}</ref>  The first successful firing of the Tien-Chien II (Sky Sword II) air to air missile took place in 1992. The ROCAF established its first F-CK-1 squadron the following year.

The ROCAF's initial order of 250 aircrafts was cut to 130 in 1991, following deals for F-16s & Mirage 2000-5s with the U.S. and France. The last IDF A/B rolled off the production lines in 1999.<ref name="globalsecurity"/>

=== F-CK-1 C/D "Hsiang Sheng" ===
[[Image:IDF F-CK-1C.jpg|thumb|The first test flight of the F-CK-1 C/D varient.]]

The ROC Ministry of National Defense (MND) announced that beginning in 2001, the government would allocate new budgets for the IDF upgrade plan (as included in the five MND proposals to help the AIDC <ref>The five proposals were:  1. Upgrades of AIDC's AT-3, IDF, and F-5 would be assigned to AIDC in the future.  2.  Procurements of Army's Utility Helicopter, Navy's long range ASW aircraft, Marine's helicopter, and Air Force's medium transport will all be produced and assembled by domestic qualifying firms in conjunction with the foreign firms that originally designed them.  3.  CSIST and AIDC will jointly assemble a team for the early planning of Air Force's next generation fighter, in order to assess procurement methods and suggest concepts.  4.  AIDC's joint venture with foreign firms or alliance of domestic firms will be given high priority in military aircraft service and maintenance.  5.  In the future, the military will give weapon system flight tests, electronic warfare exercises, air towing drones, avionics maintenance, and weapon procurement planning to AIDC, in situations where AIDC has the professional capacity that the military lack </ref><ref>{{cite news
|title=Improve Ching-Kuo Fighter Performance, FY90 Allocate Ten Million Budget|author=Yeh Kun-Lang|date=[[2000-08-12]]|publisher= ETtoday|language=Chinese}}</ref>).  This is part of the seven-year IDF C/D R&D plan (FY2001~FY2007), which allocates 10 million New Taiwanese Dolloars (NTD) annually for a total of 70 million NTD for both CSIST and AIDC.  Initial media reports indicated that the upgraded IDF would be called the "Joint Counter Platform" <ref>{{cite news | title=IDF R&D for defensive counterattack capability | date=[[2000-07-31]] | publisher= United Daily | language=Chinese}}</ref>.

In the [[Jane's Defence Weekly]] 2006 interview, the AIDC Chairman Sun Tao-Yu said two new prototypes were manufactured.  The upgrade would allow the IDF to carry an additional 771 kg fuel.  In addition, it includes improved avionics suite, retrofitted electronic-warfare capabilities, and new weapons systems.  The landing gear has been strengthened to accommodate the additional payload and fuel, but the plan for the dielectric radar-absorbing "stealth" fuselage was dropped due to concerns for weight.  The project consists of three phases:  
1.  Increase the carrying capacity for the TC-2 "Sky Sword" Beyond-Visual Range Air-To-Air missiles from two to four.  Integrate the TC-2A anti-radiation missile and the "Wan Chien" cluster bomb.  
2. Upgrade the mission computers, the electronic counter-countermeasures, the electronic warfare systems, the AIFF system, and the terrain-following / radar improvements.
3.  Ground and air testing.  If the program is approved, the service entry is scheduled for 2010 <ref>{{cite news | title=Jane's says Taiwan ready to test upgraded fighters | date=[[2006-04-17]] | publisher= Taiwan News| url=http://english.www.gov.tw/TaiwanHeadlines/index.jsp?categid=8&recordid=93611 | accessdate = 2006-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Improved version of Indigenous Defense Fighter to be tested | url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/04/17/2003303112 | date=[[2006-04-17]]
|publisher= Taipei Times| accessdate = 2006-10-18}}</ref>.  

The development contract for the upgraded IDF C/D flight control computer was awarded in 2002 to BAE.  The computer has a 32-bit PowerPC-based processor with faster processing/computing, higher reliability, and better integration with avionics.  The AIDC said the improvements of the flight computer will result in "a safer, higher-performing aircraft." <ref>{{cite news | title = BAE SYSTEMS Flight Control Computer Flies on Taiwan<U+2019>s Newest Fighter | publisher = BAE press release via Business Wire | date = [[2006-11-06]] | url = http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20061106005723&newsLang=en | accessdate = 2006-11-06}}</ref>

The AIDC originally planned to launch the IDF C/D prototype on National Day October 10th, 2006 <ref>{{cite news

=== IDF Lead-in Fighter Trainer ===

According to media, the AIDC IDF trainer concept apparently involved the removal of fire control radar and combat systems with the retention of flight control, so that the IDF could be used as a [[lead-in fighter trainer]] (LIFT).  The ROCAF seemed to have reservations with the concept, since it would mean the IDF LIFT would not be usable in wartime <ref>{{cite news|author=Lu Chao-Lung|title = AIDC Urges The Birth of IDF Variant | date =[[2000-07-15]] | publisher= China Times | language = Chinese}}</ref>.  A MND letter said, "Regarding the newspaper report of AIDC's desire to use the IDF fighter as a basis for Supersonic Trainer development, it is only that company's operational planning concept.  The Ministry of National Defense and the Air Force currently do not have such a plan".  The letter then said that due to a tight budget allocation the ROCAF would instead ask AIDC to extend the life of the AT-3 and continue to use the F-5 in the LIFT role <ref>{{cite|author=ROC Ministry of National Defense|title=ROC Executive Yuan Letter #904492, ROC Legislative Yuan Letter #4-3-32-4280|work = ROC Legislative Yuan Communiqu<U+00E9> Vol 89 #50 Yuan Record|publisher=ROC Legislative Yuan|date=2000-08-14|language=Chinese}}</ref>.  In 2003, the former AIDC Chairman Huang Jung-Te said the AIDC still hopes the ROCAF would consider using a simplified version of the IDF for LIFT, and that such a concept could have a cost as low as USD 1.6 million per unit, compared to the [[T-50 Golden Eagle|T-50's]] USD 1.9 million <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aidc.com.tw/AIDCsite/twnpub/news.asp?Sno=58 |author=Cheng Chi-Wen|title = Interview: AIDC Chairman, General Huang Jung-Te | date =[[2003-04-04]] | publisher= DIIC Magazine via AIDC website | language = Chinese}}</ref>.  However, the F-CK-1 LIFT modifications or new production concepts never received government funding or approval.

In May 2006, Lt. General Cheng Shih-Yu testified that the MND indeed plans to retire the F-5E/F by 2010 and allow the IDF to takeover training missions <ref>{{cite news|title = MND Plans To Buy New Fighter Planes|url = http://english.www.gov.tw/TaiwanHeadlines/index.jsp?recordid=20490&action=CNA| date=[[2006-05-18]]|accessdate=2006-10-16|publisher=Central News Agency}}</ref>.  It is unclear what modifications (if any) will be made to IDF after they become trainers.

=== Advanced Defense Fighter ===

There were some initial concepts for further developments of the IDF project.  After the IDF basic variant was finalized, the next step would have involved an upgrade with systems improvement, new technologies, and material/weight adjustment. Then the next advanced version of the IDF would have configuration modifications, performance improvement, advanced technologies, new materials, and applications of advanced weapons.  Finally, the next generation design would take place <ref name="yangpaochih"/>.  However, the concept apparently died along with cuts in IDF procurement and third engine upgrade investment.
