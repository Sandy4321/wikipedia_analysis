Athletes from '''[[Belarus]]''' began their '''[[Olympic Games|Olympic]]''' participation at the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Summer Games]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] as part of the [[Soviet Union]] ([[List of IOC country codes|IOC code]]: URS).<ref>International Olympic Committee [http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1952 Helsinki 1952 Olympics Overview]. Retrieved July 14, 2007.</ref> When the Soviet Union disbanded in 1991, Belarus, along with eleven of the other fourteen former Soviet republics, competed in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] (held in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]) as the [[Unified Team]]. Earlier in 1992, only four republics joined Belarus to compete as the Unified Team at the [[1992 Winter Olympics|Winter Games]] in [[Albertville]], [[France]]. Two years later, Belarus competed for the first time as an independent nation in the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], held in [[Lillehammer]], [[Norway]].<ref>NOC Republic of [[Uzbekistan]].

Coming from a rather small country, the Belarussian sportsmen have gained a distinct reputation for being successful in events which require brute or raw strength and power, as well as precision at the summer Olympics, while taking much lower participation in winter games. Events that Belarus are commonly successful in include the [[shooting]], [[gymnastics]], [[athletics]] events such as [[shot put]], [[discus]], [[hammer throw]], [[javelin]], as well as [[weightlifting]], [[wrestling]] and even [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. In summer Olympic games, Belarus gains one of the highest numbers of medals per capita in the world (usually the second), and definitely the highest in Europe.
