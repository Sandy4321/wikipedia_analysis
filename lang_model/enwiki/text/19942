Raised in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], Biggie grew up during the peak years of the 1980s' [[crack epidemic]] and started [[Illegal drug trade|dealing drugs]] at an early age. When Biggie debuted with the 1994 record ''[[Ready to Die]]'', he was a central figure in the [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast hip-hop scene]] and increased New York's visibility at a time when [[hip hop]] was mostly dominated by [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] artists.<ref name="allmusic"/> The following year, Biggie led his childhood friends to chart success through his prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> group, [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.]]

=== Arrests, a death and a birth ===
Biggie started recording his second record album in September 1995.

In June 1996, [[Tupac Shakur]] released "[[Hit 'Em Up]]"; a [[wikt:diss song|diss song]] in which he explicitly claimed to have had sex with Biggie's wife (at-the-time estranged), and that Biggie copied his style and image. Biggie acknowledged the former, referring to it in regards to his wife's [[pregnancy]] on [[Jay-Z]]'s "Brooklyn's Finest" ("If Fay had twins, she'd probably have two-Pacs/Get it? .. Tupac's"), but did not directly respond to the record, stating in a 1997 radio interview it is "not [his] style" to respond.<ref name="final interview"/> 

Shakur was shot multiple times in a [[drive-by shooting]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], on September 7, 1996. Shakur would die of complications as a result of gunshot wounds six days later on September 13, 1996.

=== ''Life After Death'' ===
During the recording sessions for his second record, tentatively named "Life After Death... 'Til Death Do Us Part", later shortened to ''[[Life After Death]]'', Biggie was involved in a car crash that shattered his left leg and temporarily confined him to a wheelchair.<ref name="allmusic"/> The injury forced him to use a cane for the rest of his life.<ref name="Court TV"/>

In January 1997, Biggie was ordered to pay [[United States dollar|US$]]41,000 in damages following an incident involving a friend of a concert promoter who claimed to have been beaten and robbed by Biggie and his entourage following a dispute in May 1995.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/?source=TLD_news.mtv.com#/news/articles/1425841/19970127/notorious_big.jhtml "Notorious B.I.G.

On March 5, 1997 Biggie gave a radio interview with [[The Dog House]] on [[KYLD]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. In the interview he stated that he had hired security since he feared for his safety, but this was because he was a celebrity figure, not specifically a [[rapper]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1425831/19970312/notorious_big.jhtml |title=Biggie Told Interviewer He Worried About Safety |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=March 12, 1997 |accessdate=2008-05-06}}</ref> ''[[Life After Death]]'' was scheduled for release on March 25, 1997.

Biggie traveled in the front passenger seat alongside his associates, Damion "D-Rock" Butler, [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.]] member [[Lil' Cease]] and driver, Gregory "G-Money" Young. Combs traveled in the other vehicle with three [[bodyguard]]s. The two trucks were trailed by a [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] carrying [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy's]] director of security.<ref name="rolling stone murder"/>

By 12:45 a.m. the streets were crowded with people leaving the event. Biggie's truck stopped at a red light {{convert|50|yd|m}} from the museum. A black Chevy Impala pulled up alongside Biggie's truck. The driver of the Impala (an African-American male neatly dressed in a blue suit and bow tie) rolled down his window, drew a 9 mm blue-steel pistol and fired numerous rounds into the GMC Suburban; four bullets hit Biggie in the chest.<ref name="rolling stone murder"/> Biggie was rushed to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] by his entourage but was pronounced dead at 1:15 a.m.

Biggie's [[murder]] remains unsolved and there are a plethora of theories as to the identities and motives of the murderers.

An article published in ''Rolling Stone'' by Sullivan in December 2005 accused the LAPD of not fully investigating links with Death Row Records based on evidence from Poole.

Sullivan, in response, quoted the lead attorney of the Wallace estate calling the newspaper "a co-conspirator in the cover-up".<ref>Duvoisin, Marc and Sullivan, Randall [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9142533/la_times_responds_to_biggie_story "L.A.

On April 16, 2007, relatives of Biggie filed a second wrongful death lawsuit against the city of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The suit also named two LAPD officers in the center of the [[LAPD Rampart Division]] corruption probe, [[Rafael P<U+00E9>rez (police officer)|Rafael Perez]] and [[Nino Durden]]. According to the claim, Perez, an alleged affiliate of Death Row Records, admitted to LAPD officials that he and Mack (who was not named in the lawsuit) "conspired to [[murder]], and participated in the murder of Christopher Wallace". The Wallace family believe the LAPD "consciously concealed Rafael Perez's involvement in the murder of ...

== Posthumous career ==
Fifteen days after his death, Biggie's double-disc second album was released as planned with the shortened title of ''[[Life After Death]]'' and hit #1 on the Billboard 200 charts, after making a premature appearance at #176 due to street-date violations. The record album featured a much wider range of guests and producers than its predecessor.<ref name="allmusic lad">Birchmeier, Jason [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:acftxqthldde Life After Death review] ''Allmusic''.

Its lead single, "[[Hypnotize (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Hypnotize]]", was the last [[music video]] recording in which Biggie would participate. His biggest chart success was with its follow-up "[[Mo Money Mo Problems]]", featuring [[Sean Combs|Sean "Puffy" Combs]] (under the rap alias "Puff Daddy") and [[Mase]].

The most prominent single from the record album was "[[I'll Be Missing You]]", featuring Puff Daddy, [[Faith Evans]] and [[112 (band)|112]], which was dedicated to Biggie's memory. At the 1998 [[Grammy Awards]], ''Life After Death'' and its first two singles received nominations in the rap category.

In December 1999, [[Bad Boy Records]] released ''[[Born Again (The Notorious B.I.G.)|Born Again]]''. The record consisted of previously unreleased material mixed with guest appearances including many artists Biggie had never collaborated with in his lifetime. It gained some positive reviews but received criticism for its unlikely pairings; ''The Source'' describing it as "compiling some of the most awkward collaborations of his career".<ref>[http://www.towerrecords.com/product.aspx?pfid=1711041&title=Born+Again+%5bExplicit+Lyrics%5d&artist=The+Notorious+B.I.G.

Biggie is celebrated as one of the greatest rap artists and is described by ''Allmusic'' as "the savior of [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast hip-hop]]".<ref name="allmusic"/> ''The Source''  and [[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] named Biggie the greatest rapper of all time.<ref name="bbc profile">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artist/bx3n/ Music Profiles - The Notorious B.I.G.] ''BBC''. Retrieved on 2007-01-27</ref> In 2003, when [[XXL (magazine)|''XXL'' magazine]] asked several hip hop artists to list their five favorite [[Master of Ceremonies#Hip hop culture|MCs]], Biggie's name appeared on more rappers' lists than anyone else. In 2006, he was ranked at #3 in MTV's The Greatest MC's of All Time.<ref name="mtv greatest"/>

Since his death, Biggie's lyrics have been sampled and quoted by a variety of hip hop, R&B and pop artists including Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Fat Joe, Nelly, Ja Rule, Lil Wayne, and Usher. On August 28, 2005, at the 2005 MTV [[Video Music Awards]], [[Sean Combs]] (then using the rap alias "P.

Before his death, Biggie founded a hip hop [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] called [[The Commission (hip hop)|The Commission]], which consisted of Jay-Z, [[Lil' Cease]], Combs, [[Charli Baltimore]] and himself. The Commission was mentioned by Biggie in the lyrics of "What's Beef" on ''[[Life After Death]]'' and "[[Victory (Puff Daddy song)|Victory]]" from ''[[No Way Out (Puff Daddy album)|No Way Out]]'' but never completed an album. A song on ''Duets: The Final Chapter'' titled "Whatchu Want (The Commission)" featuring Jay-Z was based on the group.

Biggie had begun to promote a clothing line called Brooklyn Mint, which was to produce plus-sized clothing but fell dormant after he died. In 2004, his managers, Mark Pitts and Wayne Barrow, launched the clothing line, with help from Jay-Z, selling T-shirts with images of Biggie on them. A portion of the proceeds go to the Christopher Wallace Foundation and to Jay-Z's Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://allhiphop.com/blogs/news/archive/2005/02/08/18129732.aspx |title=B.I.G.'s Brooklyn Mint Clothing Line Debuts, Jay-Z Gets Down |publisher=AllHipHop |author=Strong, Nolan |date=February 8, 2005 |accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref> In 2005, [[Voletta Wallace]] hired branding and licensing agency Wicked Cow Entertainment to guide the Estate's licensing efforts.<ref>{{cite|The Licensing Letter|epmcom.com |title=Properties Available for Licensing |publisher=EPM |author=The Licensing Letter |date=July 17, 2006}}</ref> Biggie-branded products on the market include action figures, blankets, and cell phone content.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://allhiphop.com/blogs/news/archive/2006/06/22/18131214.aspx |title=Limited Action Figures of B.I.G., Public Enemy Coming This Fall |publisher=AllHipHop |author=Wolfe, Roman |date=June 22, 2006 |accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref>
