'''Ian Michael Kinsler''' (born June 22, 1982, in [[Tucson, Arizona]]) is a [[Major League Baseball]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] [[second baseman]] for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].

Despite having been drafted in only the 17th round out of college, Kinsler has risen to become the Rangers' starting second baseman, a two-time All Star, a two-time [[Player of the Week]], and a member of the ''[[Sporting News]]''' 2009 list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball.  

Kinsler had an historic game in April 2009, in which he had hits in all six of his at bats, and [[hit for the cycle]].  That season he became the second [[30-30 club|30<U+2013>30]] player in Rangers' history.  Through 2010, on defense he had the highest career [[range factor]] per game of all active major league second basemen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/range_factor_per_game_2b_active.shtml |title=Active Leaders & Records for Range Factor/Game as 2B |publisher=Baseball-Reference |date= |accessdate=October 6, 2010}}</ref>  He led the Rangers with 9 RBIs in the first two rounds of the 2010 playoffs.

Kinsler is known as a [[five-tool player]], hitting for average and power, and excelling in baserunning, throwing, and fielding.<ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary1">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Ian_Kinsler.html|last=Ariel|first=Bard|title=Ian Kinsler|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|date=|accessdate=May 28, 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/jonah_freedman/05/11/ian.kinsler/?eref=sircrc Freedman, Jonah, "Are Kinsler's gaudy stats another creation of Rangers Ballpark?," ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 5/11/09, accessed 8/7/09]</ref>  Injuries interrupted his first few seasons in major league baseball, however.

==Early life and high school==
Kinsler's father, Howard, was a [[Prison warden|warden]] at a state prison on Tucson's Southeast Side.  He has been the greatest influence on Kinsler.  When Kinsler was four his father would toss him fly balls, and his dad says Kinsler would "get under them like he'd been doing it his whole life."<ref name=non/>  

His father coached him until high school, and was an especially tough coach.<ref name=non/><ref>[http://www.azstarnet.com/sports/226099 Hansen, Greg, "Opinion by Greg Hansen: Hard work got most of 38 Tucsonans to big leagues,"] ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'', 2/24/08, accessed 8/7/09{{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070502&content_id=1942720&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex "Interview:  Kinsler feels Rangers have talent to win:  Infielder acknowledges April has been frustrating,"] ''[[MLB.com]]'', 5/2/07, accessed 8/5/07</ref>  When Kinsler was 13 years old, and the best player on a [[PONY Baseball and Softball|PONY league]] team coached by his father that was playing for a championship, his dad caught Kinsler rolling his eyes as he gave the team orders.  "I benched him, without hesitation," said his father.<ref name=non/>  With Kinsler on the bench, the team lost the game.<ref name=non/>

Kinsler has had a physical challenge to overcome.  "I<U+2019>ve had [[asthma]] my whole life,<U+201D> Kinsler said. "That was tough when I was younger. I woke up a lot and couldn<U+2019>t breathe, and had to go to the hospital in the middle of the night. It kind of held me back from athletics.  I still have it, but I control it. Now I use an [[atomizer nozzle|atomizer]] or an [[inhaler]]. When I was younger I used this breathing machine<U+2026> I hated that thing. I always wanted to run around and be active."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minorleaguewatch.com/MLRamblings/040921ik.html|author=Mitchell, Bill |title= Kinsler slugs his way to prospect status in Texas organization |publisher=Minor League Watch |date=September 20, 2004 |accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref>

He graduated in 2000 from [[Canyon del Oro High School]] in the Tucson suburb of [[Oro Valley, Arizona]].<ref name=non/>  Kinsler helped lead the baseball team to state titles in 1997 and 2000. He [[Batting average|hit]] .380 as a junior, to earn second-team All-League honors, and .504 with 5 [[home run]]s and 26 [[stolen base]]s during his senior year, in which he was named first-team All-State and first-team All-League.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:A8UAZbNzqS8J:thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-basebl/mtt/kinsler_ian00.html+%22ian+kinsler%22+canyon+del+oro&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=3&lr=lang_en |title=Arizona State Sun Devils; Ian Kinsler:  Profile|publisher=CSTV |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref>  Four of his high school teammates have also made it to the major leagues:  [[Brian Anderson (outfielder)|Brian Anderson]] (his best friend in high school), [[Scott Hairston]], [[Chris Duncan]], and [[Shelly Duncan]].<ref name=non/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/baseball/rangers/stories/030406dnspokinsler.216e20c5.html|last=Grant|first=Evan|title=Rangers' Kinsler eyeing second base|publisher=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=March 4, 2006|accessdate=8/7/09}}</ref>

==Draft and college==
Kinsler was drafted by his home state [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] after high school in [[2000 Major League Baseball Draft|2000]] (29th round), but didn't feel ready for the pros. He opted instead to take a college tour.  First (because he hadn't been recruited by any [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] programs) he attended [[Central Arizona College]], where he hit .405 with 17 [[double (baseball)|double]]s, 37 [[Run (baseball)|RBI]]s, and 24 stolen bases, was named second-team All-[[ACCAC]], and played shortstop alongside future major leaguers [[Scott Hairston]] and [[Rich Harden]].<ref name=non>{{cite news|last=Chen |first=Albert|title=Second To None: He has been overshadowed this season by teammate Josh Hamilton; in fact, he has been overshadowed at almost every stop in his career since high school.

[[Arizona State Sun Devils baseball|Arizona State]] coach Pat Murphy then convinced him to transfer to ASU in his sophomore year, promising that he would play shortstop for the Sun Devils.  But while he started briefly alongside fellow [[middle infielder]] [[Dustin Pedroia]], he ended up spending much of the season on the bench.<ref name=non/><ref>[http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/9772962/Surprised-Kinsler-was-overlooked-again?-Don't-be Ringolsby, Tracy, "Surprised Kinsler was overlooked again?

[[Missouri Tigers baseball|University of Missouri]] Tigers coach Tim Jamison spotted him in a summer league, and convinced him to head east for his junior year. Jamison said:  "I saw him take ground balls and thought, defensively, he was as good a middle infielder as I had ever seen.

Kinsler was then drafted a third time, by the Texas Rangers in the 17th round (496th overall) in the [[2003 Major League Baseball Draft]] as a [[shortstop]], at the urging of area scout Mike Grouse.<ref name=hunt/>  Grouse liked Kinsler's tools, makeup, desire, and gritty approach.<ref name=bre/>  In Grouse's scouting report he wrote that Kinsler had a great feel for the game, athleticism, solid defensive skills, intensity, and leadership qualities.  Grouse knew that Kinsler was probably being underrated by rival scouts, who didn't know that Kinsler had played with a foot [[stress fracture]] while at Missouri, <U+201C>so [Kinsler] really couldn<U+2019>t run like I knew he could. I<U+2019>d seen him in Wichita the year before, so I knew he was a plus runner. Most people ... didn<U+2019>t know that, so they probably downgraded him. But I knew it, and I wasn<U+2019>t telling anybody.<U+201D><ref name=hunt/>  Kinsler, for his part, says:  "I thought I was a lot better than a 17th round pick.

Five years later, John Sickels wrote:  "Only a handful of players from the 2003 draft are as good as Kinsler, and he's certainly outperformed many more heralded talents. Scouting and drafting will always be an inexact science/art."<ref>{{cite web|last=Billy |first=King |url=http://www.minorleagueball.com/2008/8/29/603843/prospect-retro-ian-kinsler|author=Sickels, John |title=Prospect Retro: Ian Kinsler |publisher=Minor League Ball|date=August 29, 2008 |accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref>  The pick was later lauded as "one of the greatest 17th round picks of all time."<ref name=hunt/>

==Minor league career==
===2003:  Entering the pros===
Kinsler signed quickly, and broke in as a shortstop in 2003.  He batted .277 in 188 at bats in his pro debut for the [[Spokane Indians]] in the [[short season|short-season]] [[Northwest League]], while leading the team in steals (11) and triples (6).<ref name=bre/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?l_id=47&t_id=477&id=3035888 |title=Indians Alumni Climbing The Ladder|publisher=OurSports Central |date=May 17, 2004 |accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref>  He then spent the 2003<U+2013>04 winter in Arizona, working out with the Rangers' strength and conditioning coaches.<ref name=bre/>  He said:  "I was probably 170 pounds, and I decided I needed to lift, put on some weight, and eat as much as I could.  And I learned how to hit".<ref name=rel/>

===2004:  Breakout season===
By early 2004, Kinsler had vaulted to the # 1 spot on ''[[Baseball America]]'''s Prospect Hot Sheet.  [[John Sickels]] of ''[[ESPN]]'' described him as having "great plate discipline, power, and ... [being] a reasonably good defensive shortstop."<ref name=bre/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?id=1829376|author=Sickels, John |title=Teahen's power questionable |publisher=ESPN|date=June 25, 2004 |accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref> 

He had a breakout year in 2004.  He split the season between two teams, beginning with the Low-A [[Clinton Lumberkings]], for which he hit .401/.465/.687 in 224 [[at bat]]s.<ref name= HB>{{cite web|last=Hindman |first=M.J.|title=Five Questions: Texas Rangers|publisher= [[The Hardball Times]]|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/five-questions-texas-rangers1/|date=March 18, 2006|accessdate=8/5/09}}</ref><ref name=mino/>  Kinsler was voted to start at shortstop for the [[Midwest League]] Western Division All Star team, while he was leading the league in batting, on base percentage, slugging percentage, hits, doubles, extra-base hits, and runs scored, but did not play as he was promoted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3051367&l_id=&t_id= |title=40th Annual Midwest League All-Star Game Game Notes|publisher=OurSports Central |date= June 22, 2004|accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref>  ''Baseball America'' rated him the most exciting ballplayer and the # 8 prospect in the league.  When a friend asked him what the secret was to his success, he responded:  "Dude, I have no idea."<ref name=non/>

Kinsler was promoted two levels on June 12 to the Double-A [[Frisco RoughRiders]]. "When I first got called up, there were a million things running through my head," he said. "I was nervous, my hands were sweating.  It was really exciting, but I didn't know what to expect. I was a little nervous that ... all of a sudden I wouldn't be able to hit."<ref name=ff/> In June he was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Falkoff|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20040708&content_id=792716&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=null |title=Notes: Rogers ready for start|publisher=Mlb.com |date= July 89, 2004|accessdate=July 6, 2010}}</ref>  Frisco manager [[Tim Ireland]] observed:  <blockquote>I think he's succeeding because his swing is graceful and effortless.  It's just a smooth swing, and he hits for power because he lets his swing work for him.  Defensively, so far he's shown a real feel for shortstop.  He's got good feet and soft hands, and he throws well enough.... He seems pretty legit to me.<ref name=bre/></blockquote>  In July the Rangers agreed with the Rockies to send Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson to Colorado for [[Larry Walker]], but Walker vetoed the trade.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/news/040730penny.html |author=Callis, Jim|title= Dodgers, Marlins swap six players, may not be done |publisher=Baseball America|date=July 30, 2004 |accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref>  

He ended up hitting .300/.400/.480 for Frisco in 277 at bats.<ref name=HB/><ref name=mino/> Those numbers would have placed him fourth in OBP, seventh in slugging percentage, and eighth in the league's batting race had he received enough [[plate appearance]]s to qualify for the title (he was short by about 60).<ref name=HB/>  ''Baseball America'' rated Kinsler the # 9 prospect in the [[Texas League]].<ref name=top/>

Overall, in 501 at bats, Kinsler tied for first in the minor leagues in doubles (51), and was seventh in batting average (.345) and ninth in hits (174). He also had 20 home runs, 103 [[run (baseball)|runs]], 99 RBIs, 18 [[Hit by pitch|HBP]], and 23 steals.<ref name=mino>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Ian Kinsler, Minor League Stats |publisher=[[Baseball-Reference]]|url= http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=kinsle001ian |date=|accessdate=August 13, 2009}}</ref>  Rangers manager [[Buck Showalter]] marveled at Kinsler's 51 doubles, saying: "Fifty...

Towards the end of the season, Sickels augmented his scouting report on Kinsler by reporting that he was:  <blockquote>a good athlete, not super-toolsy, but strong for his size with speed a notch above average. His swing looked short, quick, and sharp.  Although I'm told that some people worry that his swing is too long, it looked fine to me.  "Long swings" usually show up in the stat line as excessive strikeout totals, but Kinsler is not a whiff king.  He works the count well, controlling the strike zone without trouble and not swinging at pitches outside the plate area. His bat has some pop in it, particularly to the gaps, where he rifles frequent extra-base shots.  He already has above-average power for a player his size, and I think he has enough bat speed to keep hitting home runs at higher levels.  Defensively, he shows slightly above-average range and good hands.  His arm strength is average, but he's accurate with his throws and seems fundamentally sound, although his error rate is higher than ideal (20 in 71 games at Frisco).  He might end up at second base eventually.  Kinsler's running speed is a bit better than average, but he's fairly aggressive on the bases and will steal if the opportunity is there.  Overall, he is a solid all-around player who makes the most of his natural ability.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?id=1885355|author=Sickel, John |title=Rangers prospect Ian Kinsler |publisher=ESPN |date=September 20, 2004 |accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

Kinsler spent the winter of 2004<U+2013>05 playing for the [[Peoria Saguaros]] of the [[Arizona Fall League]], improving his versatility by getting work in at second base.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Falkoff|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050221&content_id=947691&vkey=spt2005news&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex |title=Notes: Kinsler reaps reward for '04, 2/21/05 |publisher=Texas.rangers.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=July 6, 2010}}</ref>  There, he hit .306/.369/.500.<ref name=HB/>  One scout in Arizona noted that his swing was so effortless, yet generated so much [[line drive]] power, that:  "It's like he's swinging a [[Wiffleball]] bat out there."<ref name=ff/>

====2006: Rookie====
With [[Alfonso Soriano]] having been traded in the off-season, Kinsler won the Rangers' starting second base job in [[spring training]] in 2006 over [[Mark DeRosa]]. "Ian Kinsler came as advertised," said Showalter.<ref>{{cite web|author=T.R.

He made his major league debut against the [[Boston Red Sox]] on Opening Day on April 3, 2006, and got his first major league [[hit (baseball)|hit]] in his first major league at bat, off [[Curt Schilling]].  Kinsler said: <blockquote>The crowd was full; I had the butterflies going, so to get that hit was huge. The family was in town....

He was hitting .476 when he [[Joint dislocation|dislocated]] his left thumb sliding head-first into second base on April 11, 2006, and was placed on the [[disabled list]].

During the 2006<U+2013>07 off-season, Kinsler focused on building up his legs to improve his speed, durability, and agility.<ref name="texas.rangers.mlb.com"/>  In spring training in 2007, he hit .429, led the AL in RBIs (19), and was sixth in the major leagues in hits (27).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/league_leaders.jsp?c_id=mlb&baseballScope=mlb&statType=1&sortByStat=RBI&timeSubFrame3=&timeSubFrame=23&Submit=Submit&timeFrame=1|title= Stats: League Leaders, ''MLB.com''<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=T.R.

His torrid hitting continued into the season, and Kinsler was named the AL [[Player of the Week]] for the period ending April 15. He batted .476 (10-for-21) that week with four home runs, eight RBIs, seven runs scored, and a 1.095 slugging percentage.  His nine home runs in April tied the team record for that month (shared by [[Ivan Rodriguez]] (2000), [[Alex Rodriguez]] (2002), and [[Carl Everett]] (2003)), and were the most ever in the season's first month by a Major League second baseman.<ref name=kd>{{cite web|last=Daley|first=Ken|title=Notes: Gagne's 'pen session goes well:  Club leaning toward rehab assignment before activation|publisher=MLB.com|url= http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070502&content_id=1943322&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex|date=5/2/07|accessdate= 8/5/07}}</ref><ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/archives/sports/200751/108499.htm "Red Sox pour on misery for Yankees," ''[[The China Post]]'', 5/1/07, accessed 8/5/09]</ref>  Kinsler said: "I'm trying to put good swings on the ball, and if it goes out, it goes out."<ref>{{cite web|author=Justice B.

In 2007, Kinsler hit 20 home runs (leading all AL second basemen) and was 23-for-25 in stolen base attempts (a 92% success rate).  He was one of only six batters in the AL to have at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases, along with Alex Rodriguez, [[Gary Sheffield]], [[Grady Sizemore]], [[B.J.

====2008:  All Star====
In February 2008, Kinsler signed a five-year deal worth $22 million guaranteed. It will jump to $32 million if the Rangers exercise their $10 million option for 2013. He received a raise to $500,000 in 2008, and a $1 million signing bonus. The contract went to $3 million in 2009 and $4 million in 2010, and will go to $6 million in 2011 and $7 million in 2012. If the Rangers choose not to exercise their $10 million option, Kinsler will receive a $500,000 buyout. If he is traded, both the buyout and the option year will increase by $500,000. If the option is exercised, the commitment will have been the largest the Rangers have ever made to a player who they drafted and developed. "Ian represents the past, present, and future of this organization," said assistant general manager [[Thad Levine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/022008dnsporanglede.bb2121d.html|author=Grant, Evan |title=Texas Rangers' Kinsler gets five-year, $22 million deal |publisher=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=February 20, 2008 |accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref>

Asked what impact the money would have on him, Kinsler said:  <blockquote>I'm going to play the same regardless of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion.  It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm going to go out there and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy.

While initially reluctant, to Kinsler's delight Rangers [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Ron Washington]] ultimately committed to Kinsler being the team's leadoff hitter in 2008. "I didn't think he was the prototype leadoff hitter, but the guy proved me wrong," Washington said. "He'll take a walk, or get one run for us with one swing of the bat. He can bunt, he can run, and he can hit the ball to the other side."<ref>{{cite news|author=T.R.
