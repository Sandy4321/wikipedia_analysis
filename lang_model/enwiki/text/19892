'''Ralph''' (died [[1122]]), also known as '''Ralph d'Escures''' from his father's estate of [[Escures]], near [[S<U+00E9>ez]] in [[Normandy]], was a medieval [[Bishop of S<U+00E9>es#History|Abbot of S<U+00E9>ez]], [[Bishop of Rochester]] and then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. He studied at the school at the [[Abbey of Bec]] before he entered the [[abbey]] of [[St Martin]] at S<U+00E9>ez in 1079 and became [[abbot]] of the house in 1091. He was a friend of both [[Saint Anselm]] and [[Bishop Gundulf|Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester]], whose see he took over on the death of the bishop.

He was not chosen archbishop of Canterbury by the chapter of Canterbury alone. His election involved an assembly of the lords and bishops meeting with the king. Ralph then received his [[pallium]] from the pope, rather than traveling to Rome to retrieve it. As archbishop, Ralph was very assertive of the rights of the [[see of Canterbury]] and of the liberties of the English church. He claimed authority in [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]].  Ralph also quarreled for a time with Pope [[Paschal II]].

Ralph suffered a stroke on [[11 July]] [[1119]] and was left partially paralysed and unable to speak clearly from that time until his death  on [[20 October]] [[1122]]. A surviving English translation of a sermon delivered by Ralph is preserved in the manuscript Vespasian D. The sermon survives in some fifty Latin manuscripts.  

==Early life==
Ralph was the son of Seffrid d'Escures and his first wife Rascendis,<ref name=DNB>Brett, Martin "Escures, Ralph d' (c.1068<U+2013>1122)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23047 Online Edition] accessed ovember 7, 2007</ref> and either a full brother<ref name=Knowles51>[[David Knowles|Knowles, David]]; Brooke C.

''The Heads of Religious Houses: England and Wales 940-1216'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1972 ISBN 0-521-08367-2 p. 51</ref> or half brother<ref name=BHOChich>[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=34293 British History Online Bishops of Chichester] accessed on October 20, 2007</ref><ref name=DNB/> of [[Seffrid I]], [[Bishop of Chichester]] from 1125 to 1145. The surname of de Turbine is only attested in the fourteenth century and possibly resulted from confusion with [[William de Corbeil]], Ralph's successor at Canterbury.<ref name=DNB/> Ralph studied at the school at the [[Abbey of Bec]]<ref name=Cantor176>[[Norman Cantor|Cantor, Norman F.]] ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture in England 1089-1135'' Princeton, NJ:Princeton University Press 1958 p. 176</ref> before he entered the [[abbey]] of [[St Martin]] at S<U+00E9>ez in 1079 and, about ten years later, became [[abbot]] of the house in 1091. His election was attended by [[Saint Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm, abbot of Bec]].<ref name=Vaughn61>Vaughn, Sally N. ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' Berkeley:University of California Press 1987 ISBN 0-520-05674-4 p. 61</ref> St. Martin was a house founded by the [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Montgomery]] and [[William I Talvas|Bell<U+00EA>me]] families, and was still under their lordship.<ref name=Vaughn109>Vaughn, Sally N. ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' Berkeley:University of California Press 1987 ISBN 0-520-05674-4 p. 109</ref>

==Time in England==
[[Image:Henry I of England - Illustration from Cassell's History of England - Century Edition - published circa 1902.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Henry I depicted in ''Cassell's History of England'' (1902)]]Soon afterwards he paid a visit to [[England]], perhaps to visit [[Shrewsbury Abbey]], which was a daughter house of S<U+00E9>ez.<ref name=DNB/> He may have been involved in the mediating the surrender of [[Robert of Bell<U+00EA>me, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury|Robert of Bell<U+00EA>me]] at [[Shrewsbury]] in 1102, for some chroniclers state that it was Ralph who delivered the keys of the castle to King [[Henry I of England]].<ref name=HenryI163>Hollister, C. Warren ''Henry I'' ed. by Amanda Clark Frost New Haven:Yale University Press 2001 ISBN 0-300-08858-2 p. 163</ref> In 1103 he took refuge in England from the demands of Robert of Bell<U+00EA>me for [[Homage (medieval)|homage]]. Ralph declined to do homage because [[Pope Urban II]] had ordered that no clergy could do homage to the laity.<ref name=Vaughn24>Vaughn, Sally N. ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' Berkeley:University of California Press 1987 ISBN 0-520-05674-4 p. 24-25</ref> Robert was also demanding heavy taxes, and Ralph fled with [[Serlo]], [[bishop of S<U+00E9>ez]], who was also subjected to Robert's demands.<ref name=HenryI181>Hollister, C. Warren ''Henry I'' ed. by Amanda Clark Frost New Haven:Yale University Press 2001 ISBN 0-300-08858-2 p. 181</ref> He passed his time in England with his friends Saint Anselm and [[Bishop Gundulf|Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester]].<ref name=Barlow82>Barlow, Frank ''The English Church 1066-1154'' London:Longman 1979 ISBN 0-582-50236-5 p. 82</ref> He attended the [[Translation (relics)|translation]] of [[Saint Cuthbert]]'s remains at [[Durham]], where he was one of examiners of the body, and declared the saint's remains uncorrupt. In 1106 he visited Anselm at the Abbey of Bec, but probably did not try to assert himself at S<U+00E9>ez. After Anselm was elected to the [[see of Canterbury]], Ralph appears to have become part of the archbishop's household.<ref name=DNB/> 

In June of 1108 he succeeded Gundulf as [[Bishop of Rochester]], having been nominated by the bishop himself before his death,<ref name=BHORoch>[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33873 British History Online Bishops of Rochester] accessed on October 30, 2007</ref> and was consecrated on [[August 9]] [[1108]].<ref name=Powicke248>[[Maurice Powicke|Powicke, F. Maurice]] and E. B. Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' 2nd. ed. London:Royal Historical Society 1961 p. 248</ref> He was at Anselm's deathbed in April of 110,<ref name=DNB/> and, afterwards, Ralph acted as administrator of the see of Canterbury<ref name=Powell>Powell, J. Enoch and Keith Wallis ''The House of Lords in the Middle Ages: A History of the English House of Lords to 1540'' London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson 1968 p. 57</ref> until [[April 26]] [[1114]], when he himself was chosen Archbishop at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].<ref name=Powicke210>[[Maurice Powicke|Powicke, F. Maurice]] and E. B. Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' 2nd. ed. London:Royal Historical Society 1961 p. 210</ref> [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] had wanted his doctor, [[Faritius|Faricus]], who was an Italian and [[abbot of Abingdon]], but the nobles and the bishops objected to anyone but a [[Normans|Norman]] being appointed.<ref name=Barlow82/> The bishops also desired someone who was not a monk, or at least not one who was so close to Henry.<ref name=Monastic181>[[David Knowles|Knowles, Dom David]] ''The Monastic Order in England: From the Times of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council'' Second Edition Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1976 reprint ISBN 0-521-05479-6 p. 181</ref> As a compromise, Ralph was chosen, rather than the [[secular clergy]] that the bishops favored.<ref name=Monastic628>[[David Knowles|Knowles, Dom David]] ''The Monastic Order in England: From the Times of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council'' Second Edition Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1976 reprint ISBN 0-521-05479-6 p. 628</ref> Although Ralph was a monk and had not previously been a royal clerk, and even been a disciple of Anselm's, he was still a bishop.<ref name=Cantor33>[[Norman Cantor|Cantor, Norman F.]] ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture in England 1089-1135'' Princeton, NJ:Princeton University Press 1958 p. 33</ref>

==Archbishop of Canterbury==
It is noteworthy that, while Ralph was not chosen by the chapter of Canterbury alone, his election involved an assembly of the magnates and bishops meeting with the king. He was not selected solely by the king, nor solely by the bishops or chapter.<ref name=Cantor281>[[Norman Cantor|Cantor, Norman F.]] ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture in England 1089-1135'' Princeton, NJ:Princeton University Press 1958 p. 281</ref> Ralph received his [[pallium]] from the pope, rather than traveling to Rome to retrieve it.<ref name=Barlow38>Barlow, Frank ''The English Church 1066-1154'' London:Longman 1979 ISBN 0-582-50236-5 p. 38</ref> It was only with difficulty, however, that [[Pope Paschal II]] was persuaded to grant the pallium, as he wished to once more assert that the pope had jurisdiction over the English Church. It was [[Anselm of St Saba]] who brought the pallium to England, along with letters from Paschal complaining that the English Church was translating bishops from see to see without papal permission, that [[papal legate|legates]] from the papacy were being refused entry to England and that the king was allowing no appeals to be made to the pope over ecclesiastical issues.<ref name=HenryI240>Hollister, C. Warren ''Henry I'' ed. by Amanda Clark Frost New Haven:Yale University Press 2001 ISBN 0-300-08858-2 p. 240-243</ref>  In 1116 the pope even demanded the payment of [[Peter's Pence]].  Ralph, when he took the pallium, professed "fidelity and canonical obedience" to the pope, but did not submit to the papal demands and, in fact, supported King Henry in opposing the pope's demands.<ref name=Cantor301>[[Norman Cantor|Cantor, Norman F.]] ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture in England 1089-1135'' Princeton, NJ:Princeton University Press 1958 p. 301-308</ref>

[[Image:B Paschalis II.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Pope Paschal II granted the archbishop the pallium.]]
As archbishop Ralph was very assertive of the rights of the see of Canterbury and of the liberties of the English church.<ref name=Barlow83>Barlow, Frank ''The English Church 1066-1154'' London:Longman 1979 ISBN 0-582-50236-5 p. 83</ref> He claimed authority in [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]], writing to the pope that "the church of Canterbury has not ceased to provide pastoral care for the whole of Britain and Ireland, both as a benevolence and from its rights of primacy."<ref name=Bartlett92>quoted in Bartlett, Robert ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings: 1075-1225'' Oxford:Clarendon Press 2000 ISBN 0-19-822741-8 p. 92</ref> He advised the [[bishop of Llandaff]] that a new [[Llandaff Cathedral]] should be built and granted an [[indulgence]] to contributors.<ref name=HenryI395>Hollister, C. Warren ''Henry I'' ed. by Amanda Clark Frost New Haven:Yale University Press 2001 ISBN 0-300-08858-2 p. 395</ref> He even refused to consecrate [[Thurstan]] as Archbishop of [[York]] because the latter prelate declined to profess obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury.<ref name=Vaughn357>Vaughn, Sally N. ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' Berkeley:University of California Press 1987 ISBN 0-520-05674-4 p. 357-359</ref> At first, Ralph depended only on the king to demand Thurstan to submit, but later he appealed to the popes to force Thurstan to obey.<ref name=Cantor301/> This step involved him in a quarrel with the [[papacy]], for Pope Paschal II supported Thurstan. Ralph visited [[Rome]] in 1117, but was unable to obtain an interview with Paschal as the pope had fled the city in front of an invading [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] army.<ref name=Cantor301/> Ralph had taken ill with an ulcer on his face during the trip to Rome and, for a time, it was feared that he would die. He recovered enough to continue on to Rome, however, although it was a fruitless trip.<ref name=DNB/> In spite of peremptory orders from Paschal<U+2019>s successors, [[Pope Gelasius II|Gelasius II]] and [[Pope Calixtus II|Calixtus II]], the archbishop still refused to consecrate Thurstan, and the dispute was unsettled when Ralph died.<ref name=Vaughn362>Vaughn, Sally N. ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' Berkeley:University of California Press 1987 ISBN 0-520-05674-4 p. 362</ref> Thurstan was eventually consecrated at [[Rheims]] by Pope Calixtus II in May of 1119, although the issue of primacy remained unresolved.<ref name=DNB/>

Although he feuded with York over the primacy, it appears clear that Ralph considered the [[Investiture Crisis]] settled in England for, in 1117 while visiting Rome, he took a neutral position as regards the issues between the Pope and the Emperor.<ref name=Cantor275>[[Norman Cantor|Cantor, Norman F.]] ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture in England 1089-1135'' Princeton, NJ:Princeton University Press 1958 p. 275-276</ref> In 1115, however, he refused to consecrate [[Bernard, Bishop of St David's|Bernard]] as [[Bishop of St David's]] in the royal chapel, although [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert of Meulan]], the king's chief counsellor, was advocating that the consecration must take place in the royal chapel according to ancient custom. The king did not insist and Ralph won the confrontation.<ref name=Cantor281/>

==Final years and legacy==
[[Image:Tizian 041.jpg|right|thumb|175px|The archbishop's sermon for the feast of the [[Assumption of the Virgin]], depicted here by [[Titian]], survives in some fifty Latin manuscripts]] 
Ralph suffered a stroke on [[July 11]] [[1119]] as he was removing his vestments after celebrating Mass. From then until his death, Ralph was partially paralysed and unable to speak clearly.<ref name=BlackMonks673>Bethell, D. L. "English Black Monks and Episcopal Elections in the 1120s" ''English Historical Review'' Vol. 84 No. CCCXXXIII (333) October 1969 p. 673</ref> He was still involved in decision making and, in 1120, he agreed to King [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] of Scotland's suggestion that [[Eadmer]] become the next [[Archbishop of St Andrews|Bishop of St Andrew's]].<ref name=DNB/> Ralph was one of the lords consulted about the remarriage of Henry I to [[Adeliza of Leuven]] at London in 1121.<ref name=Powell58>Powell, J. Enoch and Keith Wallis ''The House of Lords in the Middle Ages: A History of the English House of Lords to 1540'' London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson 1968 p. 58</ref> He also successfully asserted his right to celebrate the king's new marriage, over attempts by [[Roger of Salisbury]] to officiate instead.<ref name=Cantor299>[[Norman Cantor|Cantor, Norman F.]] ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture in England 1089-1135'' Princeton, NJ:Princeton University Press 1958 p. 299</ref> Due to the damage from the stroke, Ralph was unable to perform the ceremony but, when Roger made an attempt to do so, Ralph successfully insisted on choosing the officiant and [[William Giffard]] [[Bishop of Winchester]] performed the marriage.<ref name=HenryI280>Hollister, C. Warren ''Henry I'' ed. by Amanda Clark Frost New Haven:Yale University Press 2001 ISBN 0-300-08858-2 p. 280-281</ref> Ralph died on [[October 20]], [[1122]].<ref name=Powicke210/> His nephew, [[John (bishop)|John]], was a clerk under Ralph, and later Ralph appointed him [[Archdeacon of Canterbury]]. After Ralph's death, John was elected to the see of Rochester.<ref name=BHORoch/><ref name=BHOArchDCant>[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33855 British History Online Archdeacons of Canterbury] accessed on October 30, 2007</ref>

Ralph was regarded as a "witty, easygoing" man.<ref name=HenryI235>Hollister, C. Warren ''Henry I'' ed. by Amanda Clark Frost New Haven:Yale University Press 2001 ISBN 0-300-08858-2 p. 235</ref> The struggle with York, however, along with his illnesses and the effects of the stroke, turned Ralph in his last years into a quarrelsome person.<ref name=HenryI280/> [[Orderic Vitalis]] said that he was well educated and well loved by people. Even [[William of Malmesbury]] could only find fault with him for his occasional lapses into unbecoming frivolity.<ref name=DNB/>

A surviving English translation of a sermon delivered by Ralph is preserved in the manuscript Vespasian D.<ref name=Bartlett494>[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Bartlett, Robert]] ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings: 1075-1225'' Oxford:Clarendon Press 2000 ISBN 0-19-822741-8 p. 494</ref> The sermon was for the feast of the [[Assumption of the Virgin]] and it survives in some fifty [[Latin language|Latin]] manuscripts, probably because it was thought to have been written by [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]] instead of Ralph.<ref name=DNB/> Ralph also had the monks of [[Christ Church, Canterbury]] search for documents relating to the privileges of Canterbury and had those documents copied into a manuscript which still survives, BM MS Cotton Cleopartra E.<ref name=Cantor301/> His seal is one of the first to take the usual form for bishop's seals, with Ralph standing, in full vestments including a [[mitre]], and performing a benediction with his right hand while holding his [[crozier]] in his left. The seal took the form of a pointed oval.<ref name=Seals>Harvey, P. D.
