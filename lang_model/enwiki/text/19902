Meanwhile, after seeing a television advertisement about "The Frying Dutchman"'s all you can eat offer, Homer insists that Marge come dine with him, so he arranges for Laura to babysit Bart and Lisa in his and Marge's absence. After being served by the Sea Captain, Homer eats an excessive amount of food and is thrown out. He sues the restaurant for false advertising. [[Lionel Hutz]] is employed by him to represent him in court, and the Sea Captain and Homer eventually agree that Homer shall be displayed in the restaurant as "Bottomless Pete: Nature's Cruelest Mistake".
