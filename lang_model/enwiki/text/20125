'''HMS ''Scorpion''''' was an [[S and T-class destroyer|S-class]] [[destroyer]] of the [[Royal Navy]], the eleventh of her name, commissioned on 11 May 1943. Initially she was to be named ''Sentinel'', but this was changed following the loss of the {{sclass-|Dragonfly|river gunboat|1}} ''Scorpion'' in the [[Bangka Strait]] in February 1942.<ref>[[#refCFV|Cocker]], pp.&nbsp;101</ref> She served in the Royal Navy during the [[Second World War]], mostly in the Arctic Ocean, and fought in the [[Battle of North Cape]]. She was sold to the Dutch in 1945 and scrapped in 1962.

==War time service==

===Home Fleet and convoy escort===
''Scorpion'' joined the 23rd Destroyer Flotilla of the [[Home Fleet]] at [[Scapa Flow]] on 11 May 1943 and was deployed on patrol in the [[Western Approaches|Northwestern Approaches]].<ref name="Mason">{{cite web  | last =Mason | first =Geoffrey B | authorlink = |author2=Gordon Smith | title = Service Histories of Royal Navy Warships in World War 2 | url =http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-55S-HMS_Scorpion.htm  | accessdate = 21 August 2014 }}</ref> On 20 October she joined an escort group of nine destroyers, a Norwegian corvette and two minesweepers which sailed to the [[Kola Inlet]] as part of Operation FR, tasked to bring back merchant ships that had been waiting in Russian ports over the summer while the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic Convoys]] were suspended.<ref>[[#refAC|Woodman]], pp.&nbsp;342.</ref> Covered by dense fog, convoy RA54A arrived safely in [[Loch Ewe]] on 14 November, while the destroyer flotilla turned around to escort [[Convoy JW 54B]] to [[Archangel]].<ref>[[#refAC|Woodman]], pp.&nbsp;343.</ref> She returned to Scapa Flow, but was out again on 10 December to screen the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Duke of York|17|2}} and [[cruiser]] {{HMS|Jamaica|C44|2}} which had been ordered to sea to cover [[Convoy JW 55A]]. The ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' did not emerge and so she sailed with the battleship all the way through to the Kola Inlet, an unusual and risky move that surprised the Russians.<ref>[[#refAC|Woodman]], pp.&nbsp;353.</ref>

===Battle of the North Cape===
{{Main|Battle of the North Cape}}
''Scorpion'' covered ''Duke of York'' as she returned west to refuel in [[Akureyri]] in Iceland on 21 December 1943. The Home Fleet left Iceland on 23 December to cover [[Convoy RA 55A]] and [[Convoy JW 55A]], alerted of German intentions to intercept one of the convoys by [[Ultra]] intelligence.<ref>[[#refAC|Woodman]], pp.&nbsp;355.</ref> On 26 December the {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst}}, escorted by five destroyers, attempted to attack the ships of Convoy JW 55A, but were driven away by [[Robert Burnett|Admiral Burnett]]'s three light cruisers and then cut off by [[Bruce Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of North Cape|Admiral Fraser]]'s force. During the action ''Duke of York'' hit ''Scharnhorst''{{'}}s starboard boiler room with a 14 inch shell, slowing her briefly to {{convert|10|kn}} as she attempted to evade the British fleet.<ref name="Woodman, pp. 370">[[#refAC|Woodman]], pp.&nbsp;370.</ref> This provided the destroyers with an opportunity to attack with torpedoes. Closing from astern, {{HMS|Saumarez|G12|2}} and {{HMS|Savage|G20|2}} fired star-shell, blinding the Germans to the approach of ''Scorpion'' and the Norwegian {{HNoMS|Stord|G26|2}} on the starboard side of the battleship.<ref>[[#refAC|Woodman]], pp.&nbsp;371.</ref> The two destroyers launched 16 torpedoes, scoring one hit, and driving ''Scharnhorst'' into firing range of ''Saumarez'' and ''Savage'', which scored two more hits.<ref name="Woodman, pp. 370"/> This crippled the German ship and allowed the slower ''Duke of York'' to catch up and sink her. After the battle ''Scorpion'' picked up 30 survivors and sailed on to the Kola Inlet, arriving there on 27 December. She returned to Scapa Flow with the rest of the fleet on New Year's Eve.<ref>[[#refAC|Woodman]], pp.&nbsp;374.</ref>

===Operation Neptune===
{{Main|Normandy landings}}
In March 1944 ''Scorpion'' was assigned to the "Ocean Escort" force for [[Convoy JW 58]], one of the largest Arctic convoys of the war. All ships arrived safely and ''Scorpion'' returned with Convoy RA 58.<ref name="Mason"/> ''Scorpion'' was then assigned to Force S, alongside several other S-class destroyers, part of the Normandy invasion fleet. During May she took part in preparatory exercises before sailing to [[Spithead]] early in June. She crossed the channel on 5 June and took up position off [[Ouistreham]] to bombard targets in support of Allied landing forces in the Queen Sector of [[Sword Beach]].<ref>[[#refSB|Ford]], pp.&nbsp;51.</ref> On 7 June she was assigned to patrol the Eastern Task Force area following the loss of her [[sister ship]], the Norwegian {{HNoMS|Svenner|G03|2}} to German [[German torpedo boats of World War II|T-boats]]. On 9 June she was detached with ''Scourge'' to reinforce the [[O and P-class destroyer|O-class destroyer flotilla]] against the threat posed by the German [[Type 1936A-class destroyer|heavy destroyers]] from [[Brest, France|Brest]].<ref name="Mason"/> She spent the rest of June, July and August on patrol in the [[English Channel]] protecting convoys from [[E-boats]].<ref name="Mason"/>

===Arctic Convoys===
{{Main|Arctic convoys of World War II}}
''Scorpion'' returned to escorting the Arctic convoys in September 1944, screening the battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} in support of Convoy JW 60 and then Convoy RA 60.<ref>[[#refAC|Woodman]], pp.&nbsp;405.</ref> In October she was diverted to support Operation Lycidas, screening two [[escort carriers]], {{HMS|Fencer|D64|2}} and {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|2}}, as they carried out aerial minelaying around the Norwegian coast.<ref name="Mason"/> In November, sailing with ''Savage'', she carried Norwegian troops to the Kola Inlet (Operation Freeman), their role being to join Red Army as it pushed the Germans away from Murmansk back into Norway, lending authority to the [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Norwegian Government in exile]].<ref>[[#refAC|Woodman]], pp.&nbsp;413.</ref> She then joined the escort for Convoy RA 60A on 11 November. Later in the month she supported two more operations with escort carriers off the Norwegian coast near [[Karm<U+00F8>y]] on the 20th (Operation Handfast) and then near [[Mosj<U+00F8>en]] on the 27th.<ref name="Mason"/>

She escorted Convoy JW 63 over the New Year period, her anti-aircraft gunners accidentally shooting at (and missing) two [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Wildcat]]s which had been launched to intercept a German aircraft.<ref>[[#refAC|Woodman]], pp.&nbsp;418.</ref> She escorted four more Arctic convoys early in 1945, RA 63 in January, RA 64 in February, and JW 65 and RA 65 in March. She was also deployed to support three more operations in the [[North Sea]] in February, Operations Selenium, Shred and Groundsheet. She continued in service with the Home Fleet until VJ Day in August 1945 when she was placed in reserve.<ref name="Mason"/>

==Post war==
In October 1945 ''Scorpion'' was sold to the [[Dutch Navy]] and renamed ''Kortenaer'', serving as a destroyer until 1957 when she was converted to a fast [[frigate]]. She was broken up in 1962.<ref name="Mason"/>
