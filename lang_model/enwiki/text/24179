'''Enterprise''' is an [[unincorporated community]] in [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia County]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]], and its former [[county seat]].  Situated on the northern shore of [[Lake Monroe (Florida)|Lake Monroe]], it is flanked by the cities of [[DeBary, Florida|DeBary]] and [[Deltona, Florida|Deltona]].  Enterprise was once the head of navigation on the [[St. Johns River]] and at various times, the county seat for three counties:  Mosquito, Orange, and Volusia.<ref>Pleasant Gold, History of Volusia County, Fl, p. 72-74</ref>  In 2006 Volusia County government approved a historic overlay which designates Enterprise as an "area of special concern" as a historic village.  This ensures that any development must follow strict guidelines and establishes a historic district within the community.<ref>"Enterprise Historic Overlay Plan," Volusia County Growth Management Department, DeLand, Florida, 2006</ref>

== History ==
===Early===
[[Image:Shell Midden, Enterprise, FL.jpg|thumb|none|Shell Midden in 1875]]
In 1565, [[Pedro Men<U+00E9>ndez de Avil<U+00E9>s]] explored the St. Johns River, perhaps reaching Lake Monroe.  At the time of contact with Europeans, the area was home to the [[Mayaca people|Mayaca]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]], who lived in small villages.  They collected [[snail]]s and [[shellfish]], hunted [[turtle]]s, [[deer]] and [[alligator]]s, or gathered [[root]]s, [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s and [[berries]]. The Enterprise midden or shell mound accumulated over thousands of years from the debris of cooking and toolmaking by the ancestors of the Mayaca.<ref>Barbara Purdy, "Excavations in Water-saturated Deposits", ''The Florida Anthropologist'' V. 47, number 4, p. 326</ref>  Beginning in the First Spanish Period, Florida Indians fell victim to European diseases, forced labor, missionization, and slave raids from the English militia of the Carolinas allied with invading tribes from the north.  By the 1760s, Florida's native cultures including the Mayaca, Timucua, Apalachee, Ais, Surruque, Calusa, and Tequesta had been decimated.<ref>Jerald Milanich, Florida Indians and the Invasion from Europe, p.177-180, 228-231</ref> Later called [[Seminoles]], Indians from [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] moved in to fill the void left by native Florida tribes.

===Nineteenth century===
Following the acquisition of Florida by the [[United States]] in 1821, the Seminoles had conflicts with settlers and troops throughout the [[Seminole Wars]].  In 1835, they burned [[Palatka, Florida|Palatka]], a major [[port]] on the St. Johns River, then the major artery into [[Central Florida]].  Consequently, "Fort Kingsbury," a [[stockade]] defense, was built in 1838 at Enterprise, across the lake from "Fort Mellon," built in 1836 at Mellonville (now [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]]).

To displace the Seminoles, in 1842 the ''Armed Occupation Act'' was passed, granting {{convert|160|acre|km2}} to settlers who would clear, cultivate and hold {{convert|5|acre|m2}} for 5 years.  Over 200,000 acres (800&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) south of Palatka were opened for development.  One of more than 1,000 who applied was Cornelius Taylor from San Pablo (now [[Mayport, Florida|Mayport]]), a former timber agent and first cousin to General [[Zachary Taylor]].  In 1841, he and about 20 others founded "Enterprise" at Fort Kingsbury, which had been abandoned after 6 weeks, and filed for homestead the next year.

Taylor built an inn atop the shell midden to attract visitors traveling by shallow-draft [[steamboat]] from Palatka, the furthest upstream ocean-going vessels could navigate.  [[orange (fruit)|orange]] [[grove (nature)|grove]]s were planted, a [[gristmill]] established, together with a [[sawmill]] to cut [[Southern live oak]], prized by the [[U.S. Navy]] for [[warship]]s.  In 1843, Enterprise became county seat of "Mosquito County."   It was renamed "Orange County" in 1845, with the county seat moved to Mellonville.  An [[epidemic]], believed to be [[smallpox]], had claimed his oldest daughter and 9 slaves in 1842, and Taylor left in 1847.  

In 1851, Jacob Brock bought land a mile west of the original settlement, where he built a [[wharf]] and laid out streets and lots.  A [[steamboat]] captain with "a notable reputation for the lavish and original nature of his profanity," he had transported to Enterprise many invalids seeking the climate and [[sulfur]] [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] believed to be curative.  In 1854, he completed The Brock House, a 2 and a half story hotel with accommodations for more than 50.  Enterprise became county seat of "Volusia County" that year, and Brock operated the first regular steamboat passenger service from [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] to Palatka, expanding to Enterprise.

It was a {{convert|206|mi|km|sing=on}} trip aboard the ''Darlington'', which departed Jacksonville at 8:00 AM on Saturday, timed to receive passengers discharged from ocean-going ships.  It would arrive and spend Sunday in Palatka, from which it departed at 5:00 AM on Monday morning, docking at Enterprise that evening.  Only by daylight did prudent captains navigate the narrow, crooked upper part of the St. Johns River.  Crew members had to watch for [[snake]]s, slithering aboard out of [[Spanish moss]] in overhanging trees, and also for alligators, shot before they could tangle with the paddlewheel.  Soon, an additional danger would imperil the waterway<U+2014>the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

[[Image:The Brock House, Enterprise, FL.jpg|thumb|none|The Brock House in 1876]]
The [[South Atlantic Blockading Squadron]] division commanded by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] Captain [[George Balch]] set out to capture Confederate steamboats on the St. Johns River.  Seized at Lake Monroe on March 14, 1864 was the ''Hattie Brock'', named for the captain's daughter, and loaded with 150 bales of [[cotton]] for export to help finance the rebel cause.  It was towed to Brock's wharf to load wood fuel.  From the [[veranda]] of The Brock House, the ''New York Tribune'' would  report, Miss Brock expressed grief and indignation at the capture of her namesake by the [[Yankee]]s. The [[Marines (military)|marines]] were reportly glad to get away as soon as their boats were supplied.  They took with them 2 black males and 3 black females from their stop in Enterprise, and 2,000 pounds of [[sugar]] from a [[sugar mill|refinery]], which was then demolished, about {{convert|2|mi|km}} farther downriver on the east side of DeBary Creek.

Following the rebellion, the state experienced a boom in tourism, and Enterprise became a fashionable resort and sportsmen's paradise for fish and game.  "No dreamland on earth," wrote [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] in 1873, "can be more unearthly in its beauty and glory than the St. Johns in April."  Sold and renovated in 1876, The Brock House was then the most famous hotel in the state, with guests including President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], President [[Grover Cleveland]], General [[William Sherman]], [[Jay Gould]] and members of the [[Vanderbilt family]].  Others came from [[England]], [[France]] and [[South America]].  In 1877, Enterprise was incorporated.

Another notable visitor was (Samuel) Frederick deBary of [[New York City]], a wealthy importer of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] and other [[French wine]]s.  After staying at The Brock House in 1870, he would buy {{convert|400|acre|km2}} to the west in 1871 and build "[[DeBary Hall]]," a mansion and hunting lodge.  Acquiring much more land, deBary planted orange groves and [[pecan]] trees.  In 1876, he established the DeBary Merchants Line, a steamship company contracted to carry mail from Jacksonville to Enterprise.  He contributed money to build the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] [[All Saints Episcopal Church (Enterprise, Florida)|All Saints Episcopal Church]], completed in 1883.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.

[[Image:Steamer City of Jacksonville.jpg|thumb|none|''St. Johns River Steamer'' in 1908]]
The Atlantic Coast, St. Johns & Indian River Railroad in 1885 linked [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]] with Enterprise, from which ran a spur line to the [[Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railroad|Jacksonville, Tampa & Key West Railroad]] at Enterprise Junction in present-day DeBary.  But in 1888, Florida experienced an epidemic of [[yellow fever]].  The population of Enterprise dwindled, and [[Deland, Florida|Deland]] became county seat.  The freezes of 1894 and 1895 wiped out the citrus industry in much of the state, including the deBary groves.  Enterprise voted to de-incorporate in 1895.  Its distinctive midden, once featured on the city [[seal (device)|seal]], would disappear, the shells used to pave streets and sidewalks.

===Recent===
In 1924, the George E. Turner Power Plant was built near the shore of Lake Monroe.  Around this time, the Methodist Church organized and was named after a popular preacher named Rev. Barnett. The town was renamed "Benson Springs" in 1927, a change petitioned by the owner, employees and guests of the Benson Springs Hotel.  Never popular, the name "Benson Springs" changed back to "Enterprise" in 1937, the year the deteriorating hotel was razed to increase room for the 'Florida United Methodist Children's Home.  The [[Florida East Coast Railway]] branch was abandoned in the 1950s, its track removed in the 1970s.  Dismantling the George E. Turner Power Plant began in 2007, and was completed in February 2008.  Today, Enterprise struggles not to be absorbed by Deltona.
