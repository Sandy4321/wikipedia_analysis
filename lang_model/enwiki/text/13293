Kell was inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1983.

In college, Kell played for [[Arkansas State University]], where the baseball facility, [[Tomlinson Stadium<U+2013>Kell Field]], is named after him.<ref name="facil">[https://admin.xosn.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7200&ATCLID=207069 Tomlinson Stadium<U+2014>Kell Field] at admin.xosn.com, URL accessed June 25, 2010. [http://www.webcitation.org/5qkbiUEa1 Archived] 06-25-10</ref>

A solid right-handed hitter and a sure-handed fielder, Kell was a 10-time All-Star, [[batting average|batted]] over .300 nine times and topped the league's third basemen in [[Baseball statistics|assists]] and [[total chances]] four times and in fielding percentage seven times. He won his only batting title in {{by|1949}} (.343), denying [[Ted Williams]] his third [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]]; until the final week of the season, Williams had led the batting race. On October 2, 1949, Kell went 2-for-3 while Williams was hitless in two official at bats.<ref name="DFPobit"/> Kell's final mark was .3429, Williams's .3427. One year later, Kell batted .340, leading the league with 218 hits and 56 doubles, but lost the batting title to Williams' teammate, Red Sox [[second baseman]] [[Billy Goodman]]. 

In his career, Kell batted .306, with 78 [[home run]]s and 870 [[runs batted in]], 881 [[run (baseball statistics)|runs scored]], 2054 [[hit (baseball statistics)|hits]], 385 [[double (baseball)|doubles]], 50 [[triple (baseball)|triples]], 51 [[stolen base]]s, a ..414 [[slugging average]], and 621 [[base on balls|walks]] for a .367 [[on base percentage]].

Kell was inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] by the Veterans Committee in 1983.  A memorable quote from his induction speech at the Hall of Fame goes as follows, "I have always said that George Kell has taken more from this great game of baseball than he can ever give back.  And now I know, I am deeper in debt than ever before."<ref name="DFPobit"/>

==Broadcasting career==
Following his retirement as a player, Kell worked as a [[play-by-play]] announcer for the Orioles (1957), [[Major League Baseball on CBS#1955<U+2013>1958|CBS]] television (1958), and the Tigers (1959<U+2013>1963, 1965<U+2013>1996). Kell also helped call the [[1959 National League tie-breaker series]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Dodgers Confident of National Flag|date=September 29, 1959|first=Joe|last=Reichler|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Times Daily|page=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Crosby Sings Plenty|date=September 29, 1959|first=Cynthia|last=Lowry|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Kentucky New Era|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Vet, Rookie Combine for LA Playoff Win|date=September 30, 1959|author=United Press International|newspaper=The Modesto Bee|page=C10}}</ref> for [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] television along with [[Bud Blattner]], the [[1962 National League tie-breaker series]] for [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] television along with [[Bob Wolff]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Torre & Cubs?|date=June 13, 1986|newspaper=The Hour|page=19}}</ref> the [[1962 World Series]] for [[Major League Baseball on NBC Radio|NBC Radio]] along with [[Joe Garagiola]], and Games 3-5 of the [[1968 World Series]] (for which the Tigers were the home team) for NBC television along with [[Curt Gowdy]].

From 1975 until his retirement from broadcasting, Kell was joined on Tiger telecasts by [[Al Kaline]] as [[color commentator]]. After the [[1984 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]]' World Series win in [[1984 World Series|1984]], Kell remarked, "If we get a little pitching out of Wilcox, this team could do it again." The Tigers got very little pitching out of the aging [[Milt Wilcox]] after 1984 and did not return to the fall classic until [[2006 World Series|2006]].

===Broadcasting style===
[[File:George Kell 1953.jpg|thumb|180px|Kell during his time with the Red Sox.]]
Kell had a relaxed, easygoing "country-gentleman" style of announcing. In contrast to his compatriot [[Ernie Harwell]], who opened his radio broadcasts with "Hiya, Tiger fans!", Kell traditionally opened his broadcasts with "Good afternoon, everyone!" or "Good EVE-ning, everyone!" When paired with Larry Osterman on Tigers telecasts in the late 1960s and early '70s, the opening was often "Thank you, Larry, and good afternoon."

Kell was also known for particular colloquialisms in his style, such as always referring to a high pitch near the batter's eyes as being "up in his wheelhouse", or a hard-hit home run being "tommyhawked" into the stands. A particularly good catch was exemplified by "Speared by [[Aurelio Rodr<U+00ED>guez|(Aurelio) Rodr<U+00ED>guez]]! Whale of a play!" 

His home run call was simple but delivered with rising pitch: "Long drive...way back...could be... and it is. Home run!"  The game-ending out, whether it meant a Tiger win or loss, usually merited a decrescendo: "Fly ball to center field...this should be the ball game... it is." Kell also relayed stories of his Hall of Fame career in the same folksy style. A favorite story of his was about the incident when his jaw was broken by a line drive off the bat of [[Joe DiMaggio]]. "I got up, made the play at third, then passed out."

In 2009, the Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association gave Kell its highest individual honor, an honorary lifetime membership. The association was founded in 1948 by pioneer Tigers announcer [[Ty Tyson]].

==Personal life==
Kell served ten years on the Arkansas State Highway Commission (1973<U+2013>83) and owned a car dealership, George Kell Motors, in [[Newport, Arkansas|Newport]].

Kell's brother, [[Skeeter Kell|Everett "Skeeter" Kell]], played the 1952 season for the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]].<ref>http://www.baseball-reference.com/k/kellsk01.shtml</ref>

Kell married his childhood sweetheart Charlene; they remained married for 50 years until her death from cancer in 1991. They had one daughter, Terrie Jane. And one son George Kell Jr.

Best-selling author [[Elmore Leonard]] in the 1990 anthology ''Cult Baseball Players'' wrote that Kell was his favorite player. When the novelist threw out the first pitch at a June 15, 1999 Tigers game, Leonard wore a No. 21 jersey that was presented to him by the Tigers in an homage to Kell.

Kell is survived by his second wife, Carolyn.

==Death==

Kell died at age 86 in his sleep in his hometown of Swifton, Arkansas on March 24, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame baseball player George Kell passes away|publisher =[[KAIT]] |date =2009-03-24|url=http://www.kait8.com/global/story.asp?s=10061862|accessdate=2009-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= Steve|last= Ginsburg|coauthors= Justin Palmer|title= Hall of Fame third baseman Kell dies|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUSTRE52N66B20090324?feedType=RSS&feedName=sportsNews&sp=true|publisher= [[Reuters]]|date= 25 March 2009|accessdate=25 March 2009}}</ref>

[[Fox Sports Detroit]] (the Detroit Tigers' current local TV rights holder) honored Kell with re-airings of the special ''FSN Basement: All Star Edition 2005'' featuring interviews with George Kell and Al Kaline, each recalling their memories of playing for the Tigers and working together in the television booth. It re-aired several times during the week after his death.<ref>[http://msn.foxsports.com/other/story/9375616/Tigers-Fans,-FOX-Sports-DetroitMourn-the-Passing-of-George-Kell Tigers Fans, FOX Sports Detroit Mourn the Passing of George Kell]</ref>

==Post Office==

Kell would have yet one more honor bestowed upon him, yet this one he never got to experience. On 6/12/2009, John Putt, III, Postmaster of Swifton, Arkansas sent a formal request to Rep Marion Berry (AR-1), to have the towns Post Office named for George Kell. H.R. 3634 was introduced to the 111th Congress (2009<U+2013>2010) on 9/23/2009 and on 6/9/2010 it was signed by President Obama and became Public Law 111-180. A Dedication Ceremony was held at the Swifton Post Office on 8/26/2010 that included a special cancellation for the day<U+2019>s event.
