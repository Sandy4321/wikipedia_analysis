{{French literature (small)}}
'''Jacques Roubaud''' (born [[1932]]) is a [[France|French]] [[poet]] and [[mathematician]]. 

A Mathematics teacher at [[Universities of Paris|University of Paris X]] and a member of the [[Oulipo]] group, he has also published poetry, plays, novels, and translated English poetry and books into French such as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]''.

Roubaud's fiction often suppresses the rigorous constraints of the [[Oulipo]] (while mentioning their suppression, thereby indicating that such constraints are indeed present), yet takes the [[Oulipian]] self-consciousness of the writing act to an extreme. This simultaneity both appears playfully, with his Hortense novels, ''Our Beautiful Heroine'', ''Hortense in Exile'', and ''Hortense is Abducted'', and with the gravity and reflection of the writing act as the affirmation of one's worth and existence in ''The Great Fire of London'', considered the pinnacle of his prose.
