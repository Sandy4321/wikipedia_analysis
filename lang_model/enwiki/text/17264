:''This article is about the 17th century king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. For another person sometimes mentioned as W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV of Poland in works of reference, see the 14th century [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw I the Elbow-high|Ladislaus I the Elbow-high of Poland]]''

'''W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV Vasa''' ({{lang-pl|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV Waza}}, {{lang-la|Vladislaus IV Vasa}}, {{lang-lt|Vladislovas IV Vaza}}, June 9, 1595 <U+2013> May 20, 1648) was a Polish and Swedish prince, the son of [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and his wife, [[Anna of Austria (1573<U+2013>1598)|Anna of Austria]] (also known as Anna of Habsburg). W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV reigned as [[King]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] from November 8, 1632, to his death in 1648.

In 1610, the teenage W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw was elected [[Tsar]] of [[Russia]] by [[Seven Boyars]], but did not assume the [[Muscovy|Muscovite throne]] due to his father's opposition <ref>''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', p.&nbsp;750</ref> and popular uprising in Russia; he used the title of Grand Duke of [[Muscovy]] until 1634. The throne during this time was instead held by [[Michael I of Russia|Michael Romanov]].

W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw managed to prevent the Commonwealth becoming embroiled in the bloody [[Thirty Years' War]] that ravaged [[western Europe]] during his reign, and was fairly successful in defending the Commonwealth from invasion. He supported [[religious tolerance]] and carried out military reforms. He failed, however, to realize his dreams of fame and conquest, or to reform and strengthen the Commonwealth.

His death marked the end of the [[Polish Golden Age|Golden Age of the Commonwealth]], as conflicts and tensions that W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw had failed to resolve led in 1648 to the greatest of the [[Cossacks|Cossack]] uprisings<U+2014>the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]]<U+2014>and to Swedish invasion ("[[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]]").

==Royal titles==
* Royal titles in Latin: ''Vladislaus Quartus Dei gratia rex Poloniae, magnus dux Lithuaniae, Russiae, Prussiae, Masoviae, Samogitiae, Livoniaeque, necnon Suecorum, Gothorum Vandalorumque haereditarius rex, electus magnus dux Moschoviae.''
* English translation: ''Vladislaus IV, by the grace of God, king of [[Poland]], grand duke of [[Lithuania]], [[Ruthenia]], [[Prussia]], [[Masovia]], [[Samogitia]], [[Livonia]], and also hereditary king of the [[Swedish people|Swedes]], [[Goths]] and [[Vandals]], elected Grand Duke of [[Moscow]].''

As W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Zygmunt Waza-Jagiellon, in 1632 he was elected King of Poland. By paternal inheritance, he legally succeeded as [[King of Sweden]]. He was also heir to one of the several Christian claims to the title of [[King of Jerusalem]], but the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] had been defunct for several centuries. His titles were the longest of those of any Polish king ever.<ref name=wladcy3>[[Maciej Rosalak]], ''Kr<U+00F3>l, ksi<U+0105><U+017C><U+0119>, kr<U+00F3>l i car'', Introduction to ''W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV Wasa'', W<U+0142>adcy Polski, p.3</ref>

==Biography==
===Father's legacy===
[[Image:Wladyslaw Zygmunt Waza.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Prince W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Sigismund Vasa, c.1605.]]
His father [[Sigismund III Vasa]], grandson of [[Gustav I of Sweden]], had [[Order of succession|succeeded]] his father to the [[Swedish throne]] in 1592, only to be deposed in 1599 by his uncle, subsequently [[Charles IX of Sweden]]. This led to a long-standing feud where the [[Polish kings]] of the [[House of Vasa]] claimed the Swedish throne. The effects of this were the [[Polish-Swedish War|Swedish War]] (1600<U+2013>1629) and later, [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] of 1655. Sigismund, a devout [[Catholic]], pursued other military conflicts abroad, barely avoiding involving the Commonwealth in the [[Thirty Year War]] and supported [[counter-reformation]], both policies which lead to increasing tensions inside the Commonwealth.

===Childhood===
W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's mother died three years after giving birth to him. He would be raised by one of her former ladies of the court, Urszula Meierin.<ref name=wladcy4>[[Tomasz Bohun]], ''Wychowaczyni Urszula Meierin'', ''W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV Wasa'', W<U+0142>adcy Polski, p.4</ref> Urszula was a powerful player at the royal court, with much influence.<ref name=wladcy4/> Around early 17th century she seems to have lost much of her influence, as W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw gained new teachers and mentors, such as priests Gabriel Prowancjusz, [[Andrzej Szo<U+0142>drski]] and Marek <U+0141><U+0119>tkowski.<ref name=wladcy4/> W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw also formed a friendship with [[Adam Kazanowski]] and his brother, [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Kazanowski (1601-1648)|Stanis<U+0142>aw]].<ref name=wladcy4/> It is reported that W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw was interested in arts; later this would lead to him becoming an important patron of arts.<ref name=wladcy4/> He spoke and wrote in German, Italian and Latin.<ref name=wladcy4/> W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw was liked by szlachta, however, his father plans to secure him the throne of Poland (''[[vivente rege]]'') were crushed in the [[Zebrzydowski Rebellion]] ([[rokosz]]).<ref name=wladcy5>[[Tomasz Bohun]], ''M<U+0142>odzieniec urodziwy, z wrodzonym powabem'', ''W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV Wasa'', W<U+0142>adcy Polski, p.5</ref>

===Tsar===
[[Image:VasaVladislav.JPG|thumb|upright|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw in young age.]]
In 1610 W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw, aged 15, was elected [[Tsar]] by [[Muscovy]]'s aristocracy council of ''[[Seven boyars]]'', who overthrew tsar [[Vasily Shuysky]] during the [[Polish<U+2013>Muscovite War (1605<U+2013>1618)|Polish-Muscovite War]] and Muscovy's [[Time of Troubles]].<ref name=wladcy8>[[Tomasz Bohun]], ''W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Zygmuntowicz - car z Polski'', ''W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV Wasa'', W<U+0142>adcy Polski, p.8</ref> His election was ruined by his father,  Zygmunt, who aimed to convert Muscovy's population from [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religion to [[Catholicism]].<ref name=wladcy8/> Zygmunt refused to agree to the boyar's request to send prince W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw to [[Moscow]] and his conversion to Orthodoxy.<ref name=wladcy8/> Instead, Zygmunt proposed that he should reign as a regent in Muscovy instead.<ref name=wladcy8/> This unrealistic proposal led to the resumed hostilities.<ref name=wladcy8/> W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw tried to regain the tsar's throne himself, organizing a campaign in 1616.<ref name=wladcy9>[[Tomasz Bohun]], ''Wyprawa po czapk<U+0119> Manomacha'', ''W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV Wasa'', W<U+0142>adcy Polski, p.9</ref> Despite some military victories, he was unable to capture Moscow.<ref name=wladcy9/> W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw was never able to reign in Russia; he held on to the title, without any real power, until 1634.<ref name=wladcy9/>

===Prince===
Before he was elected king of the Commonwealth, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw fought in many campaigns, seeking personal glory. After his final campaign against [[Russia]]ns in 1617-1618 (the end of [[Dymitriads]]), in 1619 he went to [[Silesia]], looking for an opportunity to aid the [[Habsburgs]] in their struggle against the Czech [[Hussites]] in the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref name=wladcy11>[[Tomasz Bohun]], ''Z Chodkiewiczem pod Chocimiem'', ''W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV Wasa'', W<U+0142>adcy Polski, p.11</ref> That opportunity never came, but from that point onward, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw would have a good relationship with [[George William, Elector of Brandenburg]].<ref name=wladcy11/>

The following year W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw would take part in the second phase of the [[Polish<U+2013>Ottoman War (1620<U+2013>1621)|Polish<U+2013>Ottoman War]], a consequence of the [[Moldavian Magnate Wars|long series of struggles between Poland and the Ottomans over Moldavia]]. In 1621 W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw would be one of the Polish commanders at the [[Battle of Khotyn (1621)|Battle of Chocim]]; reportedly he was struck ill, but despite that, he proved a voice of reason, convincing other Polish commanders there to stay and fight.<ref name=wladcy11/> His advice was correct, and the battle eventually ended with a [[Treaty of Khotyn|peace treaty]] that returned the [[status quo]] from before the Ottoman invasion.<ref name=wladcy11/> This peace treaty also gave W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw an international reputation as a "defender of [[Christian]] faith."<ref name=wladcy11/>

[[Image:Silenus1.jpg|thumb|left|''The March of the [[Silenus]]'', [[Peter Paul Rubens]], 1620s. The painting was purchased in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in 1624, during W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's journey.]]

In 1624 king Zygmunt decided that time has come for W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw to travel, like many of his peers, to [[Western Europe]].<ref name=wladcy12b>[[Tomasz Bohun]], ''Podr<U+00F3><U+017C>e po Europie'', ''W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV Wasa'', W<U+0142>adcy Polski, p.12</ref> For security reasons, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw traveled under a fake name, Snopkowski (from Polish Snopek, meaning [[sheaf]], as seen in the [[House of Vasa|Vasa's]] [[coat of arms]]).<ref name=wladcy12b/> In his voyage (1624<U+2013>1625) he was accompanied by [[Albrycht Stanis<U+0142>aw Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]] and other, less notable courtiers.<ref name=wladcy12b/> First, he travelled to [[Wroc<U+0142>aw]] (Breslau), then [[Munich]], where he met [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria]].<ref name=wladcy12b/> In Brussels he met [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain]]; in [[Antwerp]], [[Rubens]].<ref name=wladcy12b/> Near [[Breda]] he met [[Ambrosio Spinola]].<ref name=wladcy12b/> It was during his stay with Spinola that he was impressed by the Western military techniques; this was later to be reflected when he became king: military matters were always important to him.<ref name=wladcy12b/> While not a military genius, and surpassed by famous Commonwealth contemporary [[hetman]]s like [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Koniecpolski]], W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw was known as a fairly skillful commander on his own. In [[Rome]], he was welcomed by [[Pope Urban VIII]], who congratulated him on his fighting against the Ottomans.<ref name=wladcy12b/> During his stay in [[Florence]] he was impressed by [[opera]], and decided to bring this form of art to the Commonwealth, where it was previously unknown.<ref name=wladcy12b/> In [[Genua]] and [[Venice]] he was impressed by the local shipyards, which resulted in his later attempt to create the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy]].<ref name=wladcy12b/>

After returning to Poland, from 1626 to 1629 he would fight against the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in [[Polish<U+2013>Swedish War (1626<U+2013>1629)|last phase of the Polish-Swedish War]].

===King===
====Politics====
{{House of Vasa}}
At first W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw did not want to have deeper relationships with Habsburgs. In 1633 promised equal treating of Protestants and orthodox and forced [[Albrycht Stanis<U+0142>aw Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]] (Catholic) to countersign decree threatened him with giving key posts in Commonwealth to Protestants.{{Clarify|date=June 2010}} In 1633/35 nominated [[Krzysztof Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]] (Calvinist) on the highest posts in country (wojewoda wile<U+0144>ski (of Vilnius <U+2013> capital of Lithuania), grand Lithuanian hetman). However after Protestant nobles blocked his attempt to wage a war against Protestant Sweden, in 1635 at the [[Armistice of Stuhmsdorf]] (Treaty of Sztumska Wie<U+015B>), he renew his father's alliance with Habsburgs.

W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV owed allegiance to the Imperial [[Habsburgs]] as a member of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].

====Marriages====
W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw was married twice. At the very beginning of 1634, or even at the end of 1633 W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw asked pope [[Urban VIII]] for permission (or better to say promise of permission, since no name was included) to marry a Protestant princess. The pope refused, and speed of this refusal W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw treated as insult. At the beginning of 1634 W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw sent [[Aleksander Przypkowski]] with a secret mission to king of England [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Envoy had to discuss king's marriage plans and English help for reconstruction of Polish fleet. King's marriage plans were discussed on Senate meeting on 19 March 1635, but only four bishops were present and only one supported plan. There exist also other documents concerning planned marriage of Wladislaw and Princess [[Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine]] (daughter of [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], also known as the "Winter King"). However, when he was "cheated" during peace talks with Sweden in 1635 - by Polish magnates and nobles, many of them Protestant, by Protestant Swedes and by Protestant representatives of other foreign monarchs against a new war between the Commonwealth and Sweden, a war W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw pushed for - W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw changed his mind about marrying a Protestant and decided to seek support from the Catholic factions, especially the [[Habsburgs]].

Another marriage briefly considered in 1636 was to [[Anna Wi<U+015B>niowiecka]], daughter of [[Micha<U+0142> Wi<U+015B>niowiecki]] and sister of [[Jeremi Wi<U+015B>niowiecki]], of the powerful Polish magnate family of [[Wi<U+015B>niowiecki]]. Although W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw was quite supportive of the marriage, it was blocked by the [[Sejm]]. Anna eventually married [[Zbigniew Firlej]] between 1636 and 1638.

[[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]]'s proposal of marriage between Wladislaw and [[Archduchess]] [[Cecilia Renata of Austria]] (sister of future [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor]]) arrived in Warsaw somewhere during spring 1636. King's trusted, father Walerian (of [[Franciscan]] religious order) and voivode [[Kasper Doenhoff]] arrived in Regensburg (Polish: ''Ratyzbona'') on 26 October 1636 with consent and performed negotiations. Archduchess [[dowry]] was agreed for 100,000 [[z<U+0142>oty]] (currency unit), the Emperor promised to pay dowries of [[Sigismund III Vasa|Siegmund III]] both wives: [[Anna of Austria (1573<U+2013>1598)|Anna]] and [[Constance of Austria|Konstance]]. Additionally the son of Wladislaw and Cecilia Renata was to obtain [[duchy of Opole]] and [[duchy of Racib<U+00F3>rz|Racib<U+00F3>rz]] in Silesia (ksi<U+0119>stwo opolsko-raciborskie). However before everything was confirmed and signed Ferdinand II died and Ferdinand III backed from giving the Silesian duchy to the son of Wladislaw. Instead a dowry was written/protected by [[Bohemia]]n estates of [[T<U+0159>ebo<U+0148>]] ([[Trebon]]). The marriage took place in 1637.

After Cecilia's death in [[1644]], he married the [[France|French]] [[princess]] [[Ludwika Maria Gonzaga|Ludwika Maria Gonzaga de Nevers]], daughter of [[Karol I Gonzaga]], prince [[Nevers|de Nevers]] in 1646. He had no heirs. He was succeeded by his half brother [[John II of Poland|Jan II Kazimierz]].

== Assessment ==
===Successes===
[[Image:Medal (12 ducats) commemorating voctories of Polish King Vladislaus IV over Russia, Turkey and Sweden 1637.PNG|thumb|left|Medal commemorating victories of King W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV Vasa over Russia, Turkey and Sweden, 1637.]]
W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw [[Royal elections in Poland|was elected]] to the Polish throne few months after his father's death in, on 8 November 1632 and crowned on 5 February on the following year. In an attempt to take advantage of confusion expected after the death of the Polish king, [[Michael I of Russia|Tsar Michael of Russia]] ordered an attack on the Commonwealth. A Muscovite army (of approximately 34,500) crossed the Commonwealth eastern frontier in October 1632 and laid siege to [[Smolensk]] (which was ceded to Poland by Russia in 1618, at the end of the [[Dymitriad]] wars). In the war against Russia in 1632-1634 (the [[Smolensk War]]), W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw succeeded in breaking the siege in September 1633 and then in turn surrounded the Russian army, which was then forced to surrender on March 1, 1634. The resulting [[Peace of Polyanov]] (Treaty of Polan<U+00F3>w), favourable to Poland, confirmed the pre-war territorial ''status quo''. Muscovy also agreed to pay 20,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] in exchange for Wladyslaw's renunciation of all claims to the tsardom and return of the royal insignia, which were in the Commonwealth possession since the Dymitriads. It was during that campaign that Wladislaw started the modernisation program of the Commonwealth army, emphasising the usage of modern [[infantry]] and [[artillery]].

Following the Smolensk campaign, the Commonwealth was threatened by another attack by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the [[Ottoman-Commonwealth War (1633-1634)|wars against Ottomans in 1633-1634]] W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw moved the Commonwealth army south of the Muscovy border and forced the Turks to come to terms with him. In the resulting treaty, both countries agreed again to curb the border raids by [[Cossacks]] and the [[Tatars]], to a shared joint suzerainty (a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]) over [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] (Wo<U+0142>oszczyzna).

After the southern campaign, Commonwealth was threatened from the north. Sweden, weakened by involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]], agreed to sign the [[Armistice of Stuhmsdorf]] (also known as [[Treaty of Sztumska Wie<U+015B>]]) in 1635, favourable to the Commonwealth in terms of territorial concessions.

The king, while [[Catholic]], was very [[religious tolerance|tolerant]] and didn't support more aggressive policies of the [[Counter-Reformation]]. While it can be argued he often played one religious movement against other as a means of conserving his own powers, it is a fact he was in effect one of the most tolerant monarchs of his time.

===Patronage===
W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw was also a connoisseur of the arts and music. He sponsored many musicians and created the first [[amphitheater]] in the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Warsaw castle]], where during his reign dozens of [[opera]]s and [[ballet]]s were performed. He is credited with bringing the very [[genre]] of opera to Poland.<ref name=wladcy3/><ref name=wladcy4/> He also collected paintings and invested in decorative architecture; among his most famous sponsored projects is the monument to his father, the [[Column of Sigismund]] which became one of the symbols of [[Warsaw]] and two palaces in the capital of [[Poland]] - [[Kazanowski Palace]] and ''[[Kazimierz Palace|Villa Regia]]''. W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw assembled an important collection of [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[Baroque]] paintings, much of which were lost in the wars after his death.

Notable artists W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw supported included [[Tommaso Dolabella]],<ref name=wladcy4/> [[Pieter Soutman]], [[Peter Danckerts de Rij]]<ref name=wladcy4/> and [[Wilhelm Hondius]].<ref name=wladcy4/>

===Failures===
Wladislaw used the title of the [[King of Sweden]], although he had no control over Sweden whatsoever and never set foot in that country. He would continue his attempts to regain the Swedish throne, with similar lack of results as his father.

W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw was criticized for being thrifty; he lived lavishly, spending more than his royal court treasury could afford.<ref name=wladcy12a>[[Tomasz Bohun]], ''Utracjusz i jego faworyci'', ''W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV Wasa'', W<U+0142>adcy Polski, p.12</ref> He also dispensed much wealth among his [[courtier]]s, who were seen by people further from the court as mooching of the king.<ref name=wladcy12a/>

[[Image:Frans Luycx 006.jpg|thumb|upright|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Vasa, painted by Frans Luyckx in about 1639.]]

In internal politics he attempted to strengthen the power of the monarchy, but this was mostly thwarted by the [[szlachta]], who valued their independence and [[democratic]] powers. Wladyslaw suffered continuing difficulties caused by the efforts of the Polish [[Sejm]] ([[parliament]]) to check the King's power and limit his dynastic ambitions. The Szlachta viewed Vladislaus' military dreams as an attempt to strengthen his position during war and thus the [[Sejm]] strongly opposed the majority of his plans for war (for example, with Sweden in 1635 or Turks in 1646), and usually thwarted them by denying the funds for military campaigns and withholding its cosignature on the [[declaration of war]]. Similarly, Wladislaw's foreign ambitions came to little, as his attempts to mediate in the Thirty Year's War between the warring German and Scandinavian powers came to nothing, and his support for the Habsburgs brought him almost nothing in return.

He attempted to create a [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy]] to secure part of the [[Baltic Sea]], but this plan never succeeded. Despite his support for religious tolerance, he did fail, however, to resolve the conflict stemming from the [[Union of Brest]] split.

In 1638 W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw proposed that still not paid dowries of his mother and second wife of Zygmunt III would be protected by one of [[Silesian duchies]] (preferably [[Duchy of Opole|opolsko]]-[[Duchy of Racib<U+00F3>rz|raciborskie]] (of Opole-Racib<U+00F3>rz)). In 1642 proposed to give Habsburgs his rights to Swedish throne in exchange for giving him Silesia in deposit. [[Ludovico Fantoni]], sent to Vienna in summer 1644 proposed to exchange Wladys<U+0142>aw's incomes from Bohemian estates in [[Treben]] for duchies opolsko-raciborskie and [[Duchy of Teschen|cieszy<U+0144>skie]] (of Cieszyn (Teschen)). At the beginning of 1645, tired by constant stalling of Vienna's court, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw said to Emperor's envoy sent to Warsaw, [[Maximilian Dietrichstein]], that Poland will cooperate with Sweden <U+2013> it was an open threat (that he could take Silesia with Swedes help and against Emperor) pronounced by fact that on 6 March 1645 Swedish general [[Lennart Torstensson]] defeated Emperor's, Bavarian and Saxon forces in [[battle of Jankov]] and started march against Vienna. Now Emperor was again ready for discussion and sent [[Johannes Putz von Adlertum]] to Warsaw in April 1645 giving him wide prerogatives in transferring rights of duchy opolsko-raciborskie to son of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw and Cecylia Renata, Zygmunt Kazimierz as a hereditary fief. Negotiations eventually ended with Habsburgs success and Polish failure. Duchy was given not as a hereditary fief but 50 years long deposit and owner was required to swear allegiance to king of Bohemia (thus it could not be Polish king), but as an exempt W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw would rule duchy until his son was an adult. Additionally W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw promised to lend Emperor 1,100,000 [[z<U+0142>oty]] (minus still not paid three dowries).

Many historians argue that Wladislaus was very ambitious and dreamed of achieving great fame through conquests, and in the latter years he planned to use the Cossacks to provoke the Turks into attacking Poland so that his military leadership would be indispensable. On various times he set his sights on regaining the Swedish crown, capturing the Russian throne and even conquering the entire [[Ottoman Empire]]. He was often able to convince the restless [[Cossacks]] to join his side, but with little support from the [[szlachta]] and foreign allies (like the [[Habsburgs]]), he constantly failed in those attempts, often resulting in unnecessary border wars and diluting the strength of the Commonwealth, which later proved fatal when the country was finally invaded by its neighbours.

Some Polish historians claim that Wladislaus had short temper and when angered, could act to take revenge without considering all consequences. E.g. when Protestant szlachta blocked his plans for war with Sweden in 1635, he turned back to pro-Habsburg politics, sent them military help and married archduchess Cecylia Renata. Had many plans (dynastic, personal, about wars, territorial gains: regaining Silesia, Inflanty (Livonia), incorporation of Ducal Prussia, creation of his hereditary dukedom etc.), some of them with real chances of success, but because of bad luck or objective obstacles almost nothing went as he planned.

Wladislaw died in 1648. His heart and ''[[viscera]]'' were interred in the Chapel of [[St. Casimir]] of [[Vilnius Cathedral]]. A year after the death of his son, on the eve of the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] and [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]]. He failed to realize his dreams of conquest and he did not reform the Commonwealth. Wladislaw managed to avoid involving the Commonwealth in the bloody Thirty Year's War but his legacy would end the Golden Era of the Commonwealth. The Cossacks, angered because Wladislaw's promises to them failed to materialize, were beginning their greatest revolt against Polish rule, which would be exploited by Swedish invasion.

==Influence and remembrance==
Fort and town of [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>awowo]] was named after him.

Several years after his death, a diplomatic mission from Muscovy demanded that publications about W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw's victories in the [[Smolensk War]] of 1633-1634 be collected and [[book burning|burned]]. Eventually, to much controversy, their demand was met. Polish historian [[Maciej Rosalak]] noted: "under the reign of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV, such a shameful event would have never been allowed."<ref name=wladcy3/>
