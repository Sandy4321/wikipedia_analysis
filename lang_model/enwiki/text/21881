'''Ferdinand Van Derveer''' ([[February 27]], [[1823]] &ndash; [[November 5]], [[1892]]) was a lawyer and a [[brigadier general]] in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

Van Derveer was born in [[Middletown, Ohio]]. He was educated in the local schools, studied law, passed his bar exam and established his practice in Middletown. However, when the [[Mexican-American War]] erupted, he left his law office and enlisted in the military as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the 1st Ohio Volunteers. By the end of the war, he had risen to the rank of [[captain]] and commanded an assaulting column at the [[Battle of Monterey]]. Van Derveer returned home after the war and resumed his legal career. He served for a number of years as the [[Sheriff]] of [[Butler County, Ohio]].

When the Civil War began, Van Derveer organized the 35th Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry and became its first [[colonel]]. It originally consisted of 921 men, 750 of whom came from Butler County. Before disbanding in September 1864, the 35th O.V.I. fought in the [[Battle of Mill Springs]], the [[Battle of Stones River]], the [[Battle of Missionary Ridge]], and the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], during which nearly half the men in the regiment were killed or wounded. In 1864, Van Derveer was appointed Brigadier General of Volunteers and assigned to the [[IV Corps (ACW)|IV Corps]] in [[Alabama]] in January 1865.

After the conclusion of the war, Van Derveer returned to Butler County and served as a [[judge]]. He is buried in Hamilton, Ohio.
