The club had a very successful period in the clubs history in the 2000s, especially the in the 2005-2006 season when after a period in the [[I liga (Poland)|second flight]] of the football pyramid and a marvellous [[Polish Cup|Cup]] run where they reached the quarter-final, beating two [[Ekstraklasa 2005-06|top-flight]] teams [[KS Cracovia (football)|Cracovia]] and [[Pogo<U+0144> Szczecin]], before being eventually knocked out by another top-flight team [[Wis<U+0142>a P<U+0142>ock]].
