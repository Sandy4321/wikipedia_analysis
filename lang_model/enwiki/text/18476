'''U.S. Route 202''' ('''US 202''') is a [[US Highway]] running from [[New Castle, Delaware]] northeast to [[Bangor, Maine]]. The southernmost section of the route in the U.S. state of [[Delaware]] runs through northern [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]]. It runs from its southern terminus at a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[U.S. Route 13 in Delaware|US 13]]/[[U.S. Route 40 in Delaware|US 40]] near the [[New Castle Airport]] north to the [[Pennsylvania]] border in [[Brandywine Hundred]]. The route heads past the airport [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[Delaware Route 141]] (DE 141) before coming to an interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Delaware|Interstate 95]] (I-95). At this point, US 202 heads northeast along with I-95 through [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]. Just north of Wilmington, US 202 splits from I-95 by heading north on '''Concord Pike''' through the suburban Brandywine Hundred area to the Pennsylvania border.

The Concord Pike was originally chartered as the Wilmington and Great Valley Turnpike in 1811, a turnpike that was to connect Wilmington to [[Great Valley, Pennsylvania]]. The Concord Pike between US 13 in Wilmington and the Pennsylvania border became a part of '''US 122''' in 1926. By 1936, US 122 was renumbered to US 202 and the road was realigned to head southwest  and end at US 13 in downtown Wilmington. In the 1950s, the Concord Pike north of Wilmington was widened into a divided highway. By 1959, US 202 was realigned to follow US 13 northbound and Washington Street southbound through downtown Wilmington and was also extended south along US 13 to end at [[Interstate 295 (Delaware)|I-295]]/US 40 in [[Farnhurst, Delaware|Farnhurst]]. In 1971, US 202 was realigned to follow Concord Avenue to end at [[U.S. Route 13 Business (Wilmington, Delaware)|US 13 Business]] (US 13 Bus.). By 1981, US 202 was truncated to the I-95 interchange north of Wilmington, with [[Delaware Route 202|DE 202]] designated along Concord Avenue. US 202 was extended to its current terminus in 1985.

==Route description==
US 202 begins at a cloverleaf interchange with [[U.S. Route 13 in Delaware|US 13]]/[[U.S. Route 40 in Delaware|US 40]] east of the [[New Castle Airport]], with the road continuing south toward [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]] as [[Delaware Route 141|DE 141]]. From the southern terminus, US 202 heads north-northwest [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with DE 141 on four-lane [[divided highway|divided]] Basin Road, passing between New Castle Airport to the west and residential neighborhoods to the east. The road passes between a [[Delaware Air National Guard]] station to the west and homes and commercial establishments to the east, coming to an intersection with the northern terminus of [[Delaware Route 37|DE 37]]. Past this intersection, the median of US 202/DE 141 widens as the road intersects Airport Road and becomes a freeway. The road comes to an interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Delaware|I-95]] and the southern terminus of [[Interstate 295|I-295]].<ref name="DE 2008 map">{{Delaware road map|year=2008}}</ref><ref name="google">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=DE-141+N%2FUS-202+N%2FBasin+Rd&daddr=US-202+N%2FConcord+Pike&hl=en&sll=39.836157,-75.529289&sspn=0.015983,0.042272&geocode=Fet6XQIdRZR--w%3BFdzkXwIdwFt_-w&vpsrc=0&mra=ls&t=h&z=11|title=overview of U.S. Route 202 in Delaware|accessdate=January 6, 2012}}</ref>

Here, US 202 splits from DE 141 and heads to the east along I-95, an eight-lane freeway with a wide median. I-295 splits off to the east before the freeway curves northeast and interchanges with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 495 (Delaware)|I-495]]. Following this, I-95/US 202 becomes a six-lane freeway and heads through marshland, crossing the [[Christina River]]. The freeway comes to a bridge over [[Norfolk Southern]]'s [[Shellpot Branch]] and continues through more wetlands, with [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] running a short distance to the northwest. The road heads into [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] and curves to the north, passing to the west of [[Frawley Stadium]], which is home of the [[Wilmington Blue Rocks]] baseball team. I-95/US 202 heads towards downtown Wilmington and crosses onto a viaduct, passing over the Northeast Corridor and coming to an interchange that provides access to the downtown area by way of [[Delaware Route 4|DE 4]] and [[Delaware Route 48|DE 48]]. At this point, the four-lane freeway continues northeast, with one-way northbound North Adams Street to the east and one-way southbound North Jackson Street to the west serving as [[frontage road]]s. I-95/US 202 continues through residential areas to the west of downtown Wilmington, passing over [[Delaware Route 9|DE 9]]. Farther northeast, the freeway heads into an alignment below street level and comes to an interchange with [[Delaware Route 52|DE 52]]. Past this interchange, the road heads to the north and crosses [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]], heading through Brandywine Park, which is a part of the [[Wilmington State Parks]] complex. The freeway curves northeast again and passes under [[CSX]]'s [[Philadelphia Subdivision]] before reaching an interchange with the northern terminus of [[Delaware Route 202|DE 202]] at the northern edge of Wilmington, at which point US 202 splits from I-95.<ref name="DE 2008 map"/><ref name="google"/>

[[File:US 202 SB at Cleveland Avenue Wilmington.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Southbound US 202 along the Concord Pike at the intersection with Cleveland Avenue]]Upon splitting from I-95, US 202 heads north on the six-lane divided Concord Pike into the [[Brandywine Hundred]] area, coming to an interchange with the northern terminus of DE 141 and the southern terminus of [[Delaware Route 261|DE 261]]. Past this interchange, the road heads into [[Fairfax, Delaware|Fairfax]] and passes between [[AstraZeneca]]'s North American headquarters to the west and suburban homes and businesses to the east. The route continues through commercial areas, heading into [[Talleyville, Delaware|Talleyville]]. At this point, the median of the road widens at the intersection with Garden of Eden Road/Silverside Road. The median narrows again as the road runs past more shopping centers, curving to the north-northeast. US 202 passes to the west of the [[Concord Mall (Delaware)|Concord Mall]] before it reaches an intersection with [[Delaware Route 92|DE 92]]. Past this intersection, the route runs between business parks to the west and the Brandywine Town Center shopping center to the east. The road narrows to four lanes as it passes between farm fields to the west and residential development to the east. US 202 reaches the [[Pennsylvania]] border, where it continues into that state as Wilmington West Chester Pike.<ref name="DE 2008 map"/><ref name="google"/>

US&nbsp;202 in Delaware has an [[annual average daily traffic]] count ranging from a high of 102,035&nbsp;vehicles at the south end of Wilmington along the I-95 concurrency to a low of 30,807&nbsp;vehicles at the intersection with Augustine Cut-Off between I-95 and DE 141/DE 261.<ref name=DelDOT/> The portion of US&nbsp;202 in Delaware from the south end of the I-95 concurrency to the Pennsylvania border is part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]].<ref name="NHS">{{cite map|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]|title=National Highway System: Delaware|format=PDF|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/maps/de/de_delaware.pdf|year=2010|accessdate=February&nbsp;10, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
The Wilmington and Great Valley Turnpike Company was chartered on January 23, 1811 to build a turnpike running north from Wilmington along the Concord road, continuing to [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]] and [[Great Valley, Pennsylvania|Great Valley]] in Pennsylvania. Construction on the turnpike progressed throughout the 1810s.<ref name=history>{{cite book|last=Scharf|first=John Thomas|accessdate=January 6, 2012|title=History of Delaware : 1609-1888, Volume 1|publisher=L.J.
