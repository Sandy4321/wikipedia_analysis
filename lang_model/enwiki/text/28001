'''Wilhelm Schmidt''' (1868<U+2013>1954) was an  [[Austria]]n [[linguistics|linguist]], [[anthropologist]], and [[ethnologist]].  

Wilhelm Schmidt was born in [[H<U+00F6>rde]], Germany in 1868.  He entered the [[Society of the Divine Word]] in 1890 and was ordained as a [[Roman Catholic]] priest in 1892.  He studied linguistics at the universities of [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]].

Schmidt<U+2019>s main passion was [[linguistics]]. He spent many years in study of [[language]]s around the world. His early work was on the [[Mon<U+2013>Khmer languages]] of [[Southeast Asia]], and languages of Oceania and [[Australia]]. The conclusions from this study led him to hypothesize the existence of a broader [[Austric languages|Austric]] group of languages, which included the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] group. Schmidt managed to prove that Mon<U+2013>Khmer language has inner connections with other languages of the South Seas, one of the most significant findings in the field of linguistics.

From 1912 to his death in 1954, Schmidt published his 12-volume ''Der Ursprung der Gottesidee'' (''The Origin of the Idea of God''). There he explained his theory of [[primitive monotheism]], the belief that [[primitive culture|primitive religion]] among almost all tribal peoples began with an essentially monotheistic concept of a high god &mdash; usually a [[sky god]] &mdash; who was a benevolent creator.  Schmidt theorized that human beings believed in a God who was the First Cause of all things and Ruler of Heaven and Earth before men and women began to worship a number of gods:
*"Schmidt suggested that there had been a primitive monotheism before men and women had started to worship a number of gods. Originally they had acknowledge only one Supreme Deity, who had created the world and governed human affairs from afar." <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=_n3cCF2I2FUC&dq=karen+armstrong+history+of+god&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=Jz_vS4OmBY-C8gbogemfDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=schmidt&f=false Armstrong, Karen ''A History of God'' p. 3]</ref>

In 1906, Schmidt founded the journal [http://www.anthropos-journal.de/ Anthropos], and in 1931, the Anthropos Institute, both of which still exist today.  In 1938, Schmidt and the Institute fled from Nazi-occupied Austria to [[Fribourg]], Switzerland.  

His works available in English translation are: ''The Origin and Growth of Religion'' (1931), ''High Gods in North America'' (1933), ''The Culture Historical Method of Ethnology'' (1939), and ''Primitive Revelation'' (1939).
