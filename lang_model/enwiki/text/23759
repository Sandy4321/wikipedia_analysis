The '''Australian Ringneck''' (''Barnardius zonarius'') is a [[parrot]] native to all mainland [[Australia|Australian]] states. Except for extreme tropical and highland areas the species has adapted to all conditions.  Traditionally, two species were recognized in the genus '''''Barnardius''''', the '''Port Lincoln Parrot''' (''Barnardius zonarius'') and the '''Mallee Ringneck''' ''Barnardius barnardi'')<ref name=forshaw>{{cite book | first= Joseph M.| last= Forshaw| coauthors= Cooper, William T.|year= 1981|origyear=1973, 1978|edition=corrected second edition| title= Parrots of the World|publisher=David & Charles, Newton Abbot, London|id=ISBN 0715376985}}</ref>, but the two species readily interbred at the contact zone and are now considered one species<ref>Christidis, L. & Boles, W.E. (1994). The Taxonomy and Species of Birds of Australia and its Territories. Hawthorn East, Victoria : Royal Ornithologists Union Monograph Vol. 2 112 pp.</ref><ref name=Joseph>Joseph, L. & Wilke, T. 2006. Molecular resolution of population history, systematics and historical biogeography of the Australian ringneck parrots ''Barnardius'': are we there yet? ''Emu'' 106: 49-62</ref>. Currently, four [[subspecies]] are recognised, each with a distinct range. 

In Western Australia, the Ringneck competes for nesting space with the [[Rainbow Lorikeet]], an introduced species.  To protect the Ringneck, culls of the lorikeet are sanctioned by authorities in this region. Overall, though, the Ringneck is not a threatened species.

==Classification==
Currently, four subspecies of Ringneck are recognized <ref name=Joseph/><ref name=AusGov>http://www.deh.gov.au/cgi-bin/abrs/fauna/details.pl?pstrVol=AVES;pstrTaxa=1169;pstrChecklistMode=2</ref>.  The '''Port Lincoln Parrot''' or '''Port Lincoln Ringneck''' (''B. z. zonarius'' <small>([[George Shaw|Shaw]], 1805)</small>) is common from [[Port Lincoln, South Australia|Port Lincoln]] in the south east to [[Alice Springs]] in the north east, and from the Karri and Tingle forests of South Western Australia up to the [[Pilbara]] district.  The '''Twenty Eight''' (''B. z. semitorquatus'' <small>([[Jean Ren<U+00E9> Constant Quoy|Quoy]] & [[Joseph Paul Gaimard|Gaimard]], 1830)</small>), named in imitation of its distinctive 'twentee-eight' call, is found in the south western forests of coastal and subcoastal Western Australia.  The '''Mallee Ringneck''' (''B. z. barnardi'' <small>([[Nicholas Aylward Vigors|Vigors]] & [[Thomas Horsfield|Horsfield]], 1827)</small>) inhabits New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria, and the '''Cloncurry Parrot''' (''B. z. macgillivrayi'' <small>([[Alfred John North|North]], 1900)</small>) is found from the [[Lake Eyre]] basin in the [[Northern Territory]] to the North gulf of [[Queensland]].

The classification of this species is still debated, and recent molecular research has found that all subspecies are very close related <ref name=Joseph/>. Several other subspecies have been described, but are considered synonyms with one of the above subspecies. ''B. z. occidentalis'' has been synomised with ''B. z. zonarius''<ref>By Schodde, R. In ''Schodde, R. & Mason, I.J.'' (1997). [[Aves]] ([[Columbidae]] to [[Coraciidae]]).  In, Houston, W.W.K. & Wells, A. (eds) Zoological Catalogue of Australia.  Melbourne: CSIRO Publishing, Australia Vol. 37.2 xiii 440 pp.</ref>.  Intermediates exist between all subspecies except for between ''B. z. zonarius'' and ''B. z. macgillivrayi''. 

The species is considered not threatened<ref>[http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=1460&m=0 Birdlife International Factsheet] on the ''Australian Ringneck''</ref>, but in Western Australia, the Twenty Eight subspecies (''B. z. semitorquatus'') gets locally displaced by the introduced [[Rainbow Lorikeet]]s that aggressively complete for nesting places <ref name=WA_gov> [http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/pls/portal30/docs/FOLDER/IKMP/PW/VP/200603_declaredanimals.PDF Department of Agriculture WA declared pests]</ref><ref> [http://www.biodiv.org/doc/case-studies/ais/cs-ais-nz-lorikeet-en.pdf Rainbow lorikeet pest]</ref>.  Most local councils in the south west of Western Australia including the metropolitan councils of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] together with the [[Department of Agriculture, Western Australia|Department of Agriculture]]<ref name=WA_gov/> participate in culling of the Rainbow Lorikeet to protect other species.

==Description==
The subspecies of the Australian Ringneck differ considerably in coloration<ref name=forshaw/>. It is a medium size species of around 33 cm long. The basic colour is green, and all four subspecies have the characteristic yellow ring around the hindneck; wings and tail are a mixture of green and blue. The ''B. z. zonarius'' and ''B. z. semitorquatus'' subspecies have a dull black head; back, rump and wings are brilliant green; throat and breast bluish-green. The different between these two subspecies is that ''B. z. zonarius'' has a yellow abdomen while ''B. z. semitorquatus'' has a green abdomen; the latter has also a prominent crimson frontal band that the former lacks (the intermediate shown in the taxobox has characteristics of both subspecies). The two other subspecies differ from these subspecies by the bright green crown and nape and blush cheek-patches. The underparts of ''B. z. barnardi'' are turquoise-green with an irregular orange-yellow band across the abdomen; the back and mantle are deep blackish-blue and this subspecies has a prominent red frontal band. The ''B. z. macgillivrayi'' is generally pale green, with a wide uniform pale yellow band across the abdomen.

==Ecology==
The Australian Ringneck is active during the day and can be found in [[Eucalyptus|eucalypt]] woodlands and eucalypt-lined watercourses. The species is gregarious and depending on the conditions can be resident or nomadic. As most parrots, it breeds in tree cavities. Breeding season for the Northern populations starts in June or July, while the central and southern populations breed from August to February but this can be delayed when climatic conditions are unfavourable. This species eats a wide range of foods that include nectar, insects, seeds, fruit, and native and introduced bulbs. It will eat orchard-grown fruit, and are sometimes seen as a pest by farmers<ref name=forshaw/><ref name=AusGov/><ref>[http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/pls/portal30/docs/FOLDER/IKMP/LWE/VEGT/TREES/TREENOTE26.htm Department of Agriculture, Western Australia]: Parrot damage in agroforestry in the greater than 450 mm rainfall zone of Western Australia</ref>.
