However, this painting is only a copy of the original [[Gouache]] by [[Louis Carrogis Carmontelle]] from 1770.

The painting shows six Gentilshommes (French: Gentlemen) dressed in red frock coats and black stockings which was the outfit for the countryside of the [[House of Orl<U+00E9>ans]]. The six gentlemen are (from left to right): The Chevalier de Gax, the Marquis de P<U+00E9>rigny, the Chevalier de Saint-Mars, the Chevalier d<U+2019>Estr<U+00E9>es, the Baron de Touremp<U+00E9> and the Chevalier Desparts. 

This painting belonged to [[Prince Emmanuel, Duke of Vend<U+00F4>me]]. It was sold at auction with part of the Duke<U+2019>s estate when he died in 1931. Today the painting belongs to the collection of the [[Mus<U+00E9>e Nissim de Camondo]] (Inv. CAM 568). 

In December 1987 an extract of the painting was the front cover of the magazine ''Vogue D<U+00E9>coration.'' The front cover showed the extract with the Chevalier de Gax (half of him), the Marquis de P<U+00E9>rigny, the Chevalier de Saint-Mars and the Chevalier d<U+2019>Estr<U+00E9>es. 

The painting is very popular and is often copied and re-used as a design for wallpaper, cushions et cetera.<ref name=MNC>Mus<U+00E9>e Nissim de Camondo</ref><ref name=VD>Vogue D<U+00E9>coration No. 12, December 1987</ref>
