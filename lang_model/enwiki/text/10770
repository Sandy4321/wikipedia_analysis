The '''Connecticut Compromise''' (also known as the '''Great Compromise of 1787''' or '''Sherman's Compromise''') was an agreement between large and small states reached during the [[Philadelphia Convention]] of [[1787]] that in part defined the legislative structure and representation that each state would have under the [[United States Constitution]]. It proposed a [[bicameral legislature]], resulting in the current [[United States Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

==Context==
On May 29, 1787, [[Edmund Randolph]] of the [[Virginia]] delegation proposed the creation of a [[bicameral legislature]]. Membership in the lower house was to be allocated in proportion to state population, and candidates were to be nominated and elected by the people of each state. Membership in the upper house was to be allocated in the same way, but candidates were to be nominated by the state legislatures and elected by the members of the lower house. This proposal was known as the [[Virginia Plan]].

Less populous states like [[Delaware]] were afraid that such an arrangement would result in their voices and interests being drowned out by the larger states.  Many delegates also felt that the Convention did not have the authority to completely scrap the [[Articles of Confederation]]<ref name="Madison's notes, June 16th 1787">[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_616.asp], Madison's notes, June 16th 1787, from the Yale Avalon project. </ref>, as the Virginia Plan would have<ref name="Madison's notes, May 30th 1787">[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_530.asp], Madison's notes, May 30th 1787, from the Yale Avalon project. </ref>. In response, on June 15, 1787, [[William Paterson (judge)|William Paterson]] of the [[New Jersey]] delegation proposed a legislature consisting of a single house. Each state was to have equal representation in this body, regardless of population. The [[New Jersey Plan]], as it was called, would have left the Articles of Confederation in place, but would have amended them to somewhat increase [[Congress of the Confederation|Congress]]' powers.<ref name= "Madison's notes, June 15th 1787">[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_615.asp], Madison's notes, June 15th 1787, from the Yale Avalon project.</ref>

==The Compromise==
On July 16, 1787, [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]], both of the [[Connecticut]] delegation, created a compromise for a bicameral, or two-part, legislature consisting of a lower and upper house.

In favor of the larger states, membership in the lower house, as in the [[Virginia Plan]], was to be allocated in proportion to state population and candidates were to be nominated and elected by the people of each state.  A census of all inhabitants of the United States was to be taken every 10 years.  Also all bills for raising taxes, spending or appropriating money, and setting the salaries of Federal officers were to originate in the lower house and be unamendable by the upper house. In exchange, membership in the upper house, however, was more similar to the [[New Jersey Plan]] and was to be allocated two seats to each state, regardless of size, with members being chosen by the state legislatures.<ref>{{cite web

By and large the compromise was accepted into the final form of the U.S. Constitution. The provision that all fiscal bills should start in the House was incorporated as [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Art. 1]], <U+00A7>7, Clause 1 (known as the [[Origination Clause]]), albeit in a limited form applying only to tax bills and allowing the Senate to amend.

==Aftermath==
This agreement allowed [[deliberations]] to continue and thus led to the [[Three-fifths compromise|Three-Fifths Compromise]], which further wrangled the issue of popular representation in the House.  Less populous Southern States were allowed to count three-fifths of all non-free, non-Native American people towards population counts and allocations.
