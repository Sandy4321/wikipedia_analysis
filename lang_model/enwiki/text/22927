The '''Rumpler G.I''' was a bomber aircraft produced in Germany during the First World War, together with refined versions known as the '''G.II''' and '''G.III'''.<ref name="JEA">Taylor 1989, p.772</ref> Based on a prototype with the factory designation '''4A15''', the G.I and its successors were built to a conventional bomber design for their time, two-bay biplanes with unstaggered wings of unequal span.<ref name="IEA">''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft'', p.2834</ref> The pilot sat in an open cockpit just forward of the wings, and open positions were provided the nose and amidships for a gunner and observer. The engines were mounted pusher-fashion in nacelles atop the lower wings and enclosed in streamlined cowlings.<ref name="IEA"/> Fixed tricycle undercarriage was fitted, with dual wheels on each unit.<ref name="IEA"/> 

The '''G.II''' version was almost identical, but featured more powerful engines and carried a second machine gun and increased bombload.<ref name="IEA"/> The '''G.III''' was again similar, but had engine nacelles that were now mounted on short struts clear of the lower wing.<ref name="IEA"/>
