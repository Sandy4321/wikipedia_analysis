The '''Battle of 42nd Street''', was a battle during [[World War II]] on the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Crete]]. After [[Nazi Germany]] launched an [[Airborne forces|airborne invasion]] of Crete under the codename '''Unternehmen Merkur''' ("Operation Mercury"), the German forces were bayonet charged by a rearguard of retreating [[Australia]]n and [[New Zealand]] forces south-east of [[Canea]].

==Background==
{{See|Crete order of battle}}
Canea, a town on the north coast of Crete, was important to the military defense of Crete.

[[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth]] forces had been [[Battle of Greece|forced out]] of [[Greece]] by the Germans and had retreated to Crete. While there were between 27,000<U+2013>28,000 troops in Crete to defend it, most were only lightly armed because the heavier equipment had been left in Greece.<ref>Bassett, James A. "Past Airborne Employment", Military Affairs, Vol. 12, No. 4 (Winter, 1948), p 214 URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/1983420</ref> Although the Germans were able to dominate the skies, the British [[Royal Navy]] had control of the sea. The German plan was to use [[paratrooper]]s and [[glider aircraft|glider]]s to send forces down by air.

==Geography==
The unsealed road ran from [[Hania]] to [[Souda Bay]] lined with olive trees, running perpendicular to the main coastal road. The road was lower than the surrounding land and had a raised embankment on its western side. The road was nicknamed after the 42nd Field Company of the Royal Engineers, however known locally as Tsivalarion Road.

==Before the battle==
The weakened Australian [[2/7th Battalion (Australia)|2/7th]] and [[2/8th Battalion (Australia)|2/8th Battalion]]s, supported by the New Zealand [[21st Battalion (New Zealand)|21st]], [[28th Battalion (New Zealand)|28th]], [[19th Battalion (New Zealand)|19th]], [[22nd Battalion (New Zealand)|22nd]] and [[23rd Battalion (New Zealand)|23rd Battalions]], took up positions along 42nd Street.<ref>Bell, ATJ, "The Battle for Crete - The Tragic Truth", Australian Defence Force Journal 1991 no.88, May<U+2013>June p.15-18</ref> The Anzac units were manned at less than 50 percent of their normal strength.

==The offensive==
The 1st Battalion of the 141st Gebirgsjager Regiment were seen approaching 42nd Street. C and D companies of the Australian 2/7th Battalion charged the Germans, on their flank. The New Zealand 28th (Maori) Battalion also joined in the charge, followed by the other battalions. The charge resulted in the Germans retreating over 1500 metres. Over 280 Germans and four Australians died during the charge. 

==Aftermath==
That afternoon,  German forces were seen moving to the west trying to encircle the Anzacs. The Anzac troops withdrew joining the columns retreating south.
