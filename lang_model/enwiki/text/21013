'''Domnall Gerrl<U+00E1>mhach''' (died 1135), also known as '''Domnall mac Muirchertaig''' and '''Domnall Ua Briain''', was an obscure twelfth-century [[U<U+00ED> Briain]] dynast and [[King of Dublin]]. He was one of two sons of [[Muirchertach Ua Briain|Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland]]. Domnall's father appears to have installed him as King of Dublin in the late eleventh- or early twelfth century, which suggests that he was his father's successor-designate. Although Domnall won a remarkable victory in the defence of the [[Kingdom of Dublin]] in the face of an invasion from the [[Kingdom of Leinster]] in 1115, he failed to achieve the successes of his father. After his final expulsion from Dublin at hands of [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair|Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht]], and the death of his father, Domnall disappears from record until his own death in 1135. He was perhaps survived by two sons.

Domnall was one of two recorded sons of [[Muirchertach Ua Briain|Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland]] (died 1119); the other being Mathgamain.<ref>[[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 116 n. 111; [[#P1|Pender (1951)]] p. 147 (<U+00A7> 1935).</ref> Domnall was a member of the [[U<U+00ED> Briain]], a branch of the [[D<U+00E1>l Cais]], descended from the eponymous [[Brian Boru|Brian B<U+00F3>ruma mac Cenn<U+00E9>tig, High King of Ireland]] (died 1014).<ref>[[#J2|Jefferies (2005)]]; [[#B1|Bracken (2004a)]].</ref> Domnall's mother was his father's wife, Derb Forgaill, daughter of Lethlobar Ua Laidcn<U+00E9>n, King of [[Airg<U+00ED>alla]].<ref>[[#C2|Candon (2006)]] p. 118; [[#B1|Bracken (2004a)]].</ref> The ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' accord Domnall the [[epithet]] ''gerrl<U+00E1>mhach'' ("short-armed") which may indicate&mdash;if the term is taken literally&mdash;that he suffered some sort of deformity.<ref>[[#T1|''The Annals of Tigernach'' (2010)]] <U+00A7> 1118.5; [[#D5|Duffy (2006)]] p. 71; [[#A1|''Annals of Tigernach'' (2005)]] <U+00A7> 1118.5; [[#D2|Duffy (2005)]]; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 116 n. 111.</ref>

Muirchertach Ua Briain was one of three sons of [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain|Toirdelbach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland]] (died 1086),<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (2005)]]; [[#H2|Hudson (2005b)]]; [[#B1|Bracken (2004a)]].</ref> a man who secured control of the [[Kingdom of Munster]] in the 1060s before gaining the [[High King of Ireland|high-kingship of Ireland]] less then a decade later.<ref>[[#H2|Hudson (2005b)]]; [[#J2|Jefferies (2005)]].</ref> In 1175, in an act of overlordship over the [[Kingdom of Dublin]], Toirdelbach Ua Briain appointed Muirchertach Ua Briain [[King of Dublin]],<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (2005)]]; [[#B1|Bracken (2004a)]]; [[#B2|Bracken (2004b)]]; [[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] p. 15; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 103.</ref> following a precedent set by [[Diarmait mac Ma<U+00ED>l na mB<U+00F3>|Diarmait mac Ma<U+00ED>l na mB<U+00F3>, King of Leinster]] (died 1072), a previous claimant to the Irish high-kingship who had done the same to his own eldest son, [[Murchad mac Diarmata|Murchad]] (died 1070), in 1052.<ref>[[#H1|Hudson (2005a)]]; [[#H4|Hudson (2004)]]; [[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] pp. 14&ndash;15; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 99&ndash;100, 103.</ref> When Toirdelbach Ua Briain finally died in 1086, his sons bitterly contested the [[King of Munster|kingship of Munster]] before Muirchertach Ua Briain succeeded in securing it for himself.<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (2005)]]; [[#B1|Bracken (2004a)]]; [[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] p. 15.</ref> By 1091, the latter appears to have regained control of the Dublin,<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (2005)]]; [[#R1|Ryan (1949)]] pp. 76&ndash;77.</ref> only to lose it to [[Godred Crovan|Gofraid Crob<U+00E1>n, King of the Isles]] (died 1095),<ref name="gofraid1">[[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 108&ndash;110; [[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] p. 16; [[#R1|Ryan (1949)]] p. 77.</ref> who united it with the [[Kingdom of the Isles]].<ref>[[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] p. 16.</ref> Gofraid's reign in Ireland was short-lived, as Muirchertach Ua Briain forced him from Dublin in 1094.<ref name="gofraid1"/> After the Gofraid's death the following year, Muirchertach Ua Briain appointed his own nephew, [[Domnall mac Taidc]] (died 1115), as [[Kings of the Isles|King of the Isles]]. U<U+00ED> Briain influence in the Isles was similarly short-lived, however, as Domnall mac Taidc was apparently forced from the region,<ref>[[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] p. 16; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 108&ndash;110.</ref> and [[Magnus Barefoot|Magn<U+00FA>s <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fsson, King of Norway]] seized control of not only the Isles, but perhaps even Dublin itself, before falling in battle in 1103.<ref>[[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] p. 16; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 110&ndash;113.</ref> Later in 1111, Domnall mac Taidc temporarily seized the kingship of the Isles in an act that appears to have been opposed by his aforesaid uncle.<ref>[[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] p. 16; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 114&ndash;115.</ref> The reasons for Domnall mac Taidc's exit from the Isles are uncertain.

==Kingship of Dublin==

[[File:Domnall mac Muirchertaig (Annals of Inisfallen).jpg|thumb|upright|Excerpt from folio 30v of Bodleian Library MS Rawlinson B 503 (the ''Annals of Inisfallen'') concerning Domnall's participation in the defence of Dublin in 1115. Domnall's name appears in the top two lines of script.]]

In 1114, the power of a now gravely ill Muirchertach Ua Briain's began to waver.<ref>[[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 115&ndash;116.</ref> The kingship of Munster was temporarily seized by Muirchertach Ua Briain's half-brother, [[Diarmait Ua Briain]] (died 1118). The record of a grant to [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]], in which Domnall is styled "King of Ireland", appears to suggest that he attempted to assert a claim to the kingship as well.<ref>[[#D5|Duffy (2006)]] p. 72.</ref> Although Muirchertach Ua Briain's problems were lessened with the death Domnall mac Taidc's in 1115,<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (2005)]].</ref> within the year Donnchad mac Murchada (died 1115) and Conchobar Ua Conchobair Failge, King of [[Kingdom of U<U+00ED> Failghe|U<U+00ED> Failge]] (died 1115), [[King of Leinster|co-Kings of Leinster]], took advantage of his own decline, and attempted to gain control of Dublin by way of a major assault upon the town.<ref name="dublin1115">[[#T3|''The Annals of Ulster'' (2012)]] <U+00A7> 1115.4; [[#A5|''Annals of Inisfallen'' (2010)]] <U+00A7> 1115.8; [[#A4|''Annals of Inisfallen'' (2008)]] <U+00A7> 1115.8; [[#T2|''The Annals of Ulster'' (2008)]] <U+00A7> 1115.4; [[#O5|O'Byrne (2005b)]]; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 115&ndash;116; [[#O2|<U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (1971)]] pp. 24&ndash;25.</ref> In fact, Domnall's father and grandfather had excluded the [[Kingdom of Leinster]] from overlordship of Dublin for the last forty years.<ref>[[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] p. 17.</ref> Whilst Conchobar was an unremitting opponent of Muirchertach Ua Briain;<ref>[[#O2|<U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (1971)]] p. 25.</ref> Donnchad was married to Domnall mac Taidc's sister, and possessed a claim of his own to the kingship Dublin, as both his father and grandfather&mdash;the aforesaid Murchad and Diarmait mac Ma<U+00ED>l na mB<U+00F3>&mdash;had held it during their careers.<ref>[[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 115&ndash;116, 115 n. 109.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Both B<U+00E9> Binn and her aforesaid brother were maternal-grandchildren of [[Echmarcach mac Ragnaill|Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles]] (died 1064 or 1065).<ref>[[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 105, 105 n. 59.</ref>|group=note}}

The prospect of enduring overlordship from nearby Leinster, as compared to the more distant and anaemic overlordship of Munster, appears to have compelled the Dubliners to oppose the Leinstermen.<ref>[[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 116.</ref> The ensuing battle itself is recorded by both the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' and the ''[[Annals of Inisfallen]]'', which reveal that it was Domnall himself who marshalled the forces of Munster to victory.<ref name="dublin1115"/> Considering Munster's weakened state, his triumph in Dublin was remarkable achievement.<ref>[[#D5|Duffy (2006)]] p. 72.</ref> Unfortunately for Donnchad, however, he lost his life in the encounter;<ref>[[#B2|Byrne (2008)]] p. 26; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 116; [[#O2|<U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (1971)]] p. 25.</ref> and according to the thirteenth-century ecclesiast [[Gerald of Wales|Giraldus Cambrensis]] (died 1220<U+00D7>23), the Dubliners added insult to injury by burying his corpse with that of a dog as a show of contempt to the Leinstermen.<ref>[[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] p. 17; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 116; [[#S2|Scott; Martin (1978)]] p. 67; [[#W1|Wright; Forester; Hoare (1905)]] p. 213.</ref> There is uncertainty as to when Domnall originally gained the kingship of Dublin. His father could have installed him as such upon assuming the Irish high-kingship,<ref>[[#B3|Byrne (2008)]] p. 26.</ref> or perhaps following the aforesaid ousting of Gofraid Crob<U+00E1>n in 1094<ref>[[#F1|Flanagan (2008)]] p. 907.</ref>&mdash;although it is not impossible that Domnall mac Taidc was installed as king at this point instead.<ref>[[#B1|Bracken (2004a)]].</ref> Another possibility is that Domnall had been appointed king not long before his victory over the Leinstermen,<ref>[[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 116, 116 n. 112; [[#O2|<U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (1971)]] p. 25.</ref> or else not long afterwards.<ref>[[#O3|<U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (2001)]] p. 26.</ref> Whatever the case, the evidence of Domnall's kingship indicates that Muirchertach Ua Briain was the third consecutive claimant to the high-kingship to appoint an intended successor to the kingship of Dublin.<ref>[[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 116&ndash;117; [[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] pp. 14&ndash;17.</ref>

Although Muirchertach Ua Briain recovered enough to regain power in Munster within the year, Dublin was later lost to Donnchad's kinsman and Leinster successor, [[Diarmait mac <U+00C9>nna meic Murchada|Diarmait mac <U+00C9>nna meic Murchada, King of Leinster]], who died there in 1117.<ref>[[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 116; [[#O2|<U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (1971)]] p. 25; [[#R1|Ryan (1949)]] p. 77.</ref> Meanwhile, as Muirchertach Ua Briain's power continued to evaporate, the authority of [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair|Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht]] (died 1156) ever increased.<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (2005)]]; [[#O1|O'Byrne (2005b)]]; [[#S1|Simms (2004)]].</ref> In 1118, several sources, such as the ''[[Annals of Loch C<U+00E9>]]'', the ''Annals of the Four Masters'', ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'', and the ''the Annals of Tigernach'', indicate that Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair gained control of Dublin.<ref>[[#A2|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013a)]] <U+00A7> 1118.6; [[#A3|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013b)]] <U+00A7> 1118.6; [[#C4|''Chronicon Scotorum'' (2012)]] <U+00A7> 1118; [[#C3|''Chronicon Scotorum'' (2010)]] <U+00A7> 1118; [[#T1|''The Annals of Tigernach'' (2010)]] <U+00A7> 1118.5; [[#A7|''Chronicon Scotorum'' (2008)]] <U+00A7> 1118.7; [[#A1|''Annals of Tigernach'' (2005)]] <U+00A7> 1118.5; [[#A6|''Chronicon Scotorum'' (2005)]] <U+00A7> 1118.7; [[#R1|Ryan (1949)]] p. 77.</ref> In fact, the later source specifies that he had driven Domnall from the kingship once and for all,<ref>[[#F1|Flanagan (2008)]] p. 917; [[#O1|O'Byrne (2005c)]]; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 116&ndash;117; 116 n. 112.</ref> revealing that Domnall had regained the kingship following Diarmait mac <U+00C9>nna's death in 1117. Although this source also relates that [[Hostage#Historical_hostage_practices|hostage]]s from the "northern half of Ireland" were recovered from Dublin by Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, a statement perhaps indicative of the power that Domnall managed to preserve over northern realms once firmly under his father's suzerainty,<ref>[[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 117.</ref> at his height Domnall's father had been one of the most successful U<U+00ED> Briain monarchs,<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (2005)]].</ref> and Domnall was unable to match his accomplishments.<ref>[[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 116; [[#D5|Duffy (2006)]] p. 71.</ref> Domnall's victory in Dublin marked the beginning of the end of Munster domination of Norse-Gaelic Dublin.<ref>[[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 116.</ref> Before the frail Muirchertach Ua Briain finally died in 1119, he was forced to resign the kingship of Munster in favour of his half-brother.<ref>[[#D5|Duffy (2006)]] p. 72; [[#D2|Duffy (2005)]].</ref> When the latter died in 1118, Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair had the realm partitioned between Tadc Mac Carthaig in the [[Kingdom of Desmond]], and the sons of Diarmait Ua Briain in the [[Kingdom of Thomond]].<ref>[[#B3|Byrne (2008)]] p. 30; [[#F1|Flanagan (2008)]] p. 917; [[#C1|Campbell (2005)]]; [[#D2|Duffy (2005)]]; [[#B1|Bracken (2004a)]]; [[#S1|Simms (2004)]].</ref> Domnall himself was excluded from the kingship.<ref>[[#B1|Bracken (2004a)]].</ref>

==Death==

[[File:Domnall Gerrl<U+00E1>mhach (Annals of the Four Masters).jpg|thumb|Excerpt from folio 486v of Royal Irish Academy MS C iii 3 (the ''Annals of the Four Masters''), a seventeenth-century manuscript, documenting Domnall's death in 1135. The annal-entry litterally calls Domanall a lord of "[[Vikings|the foreigners]]" and of Leinster.]]

Thereafter Domnall disappears from record until his death,<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (2005)]].</ref> as an old man at [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]], dated by the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'' to 1135. The annal-entry itself describes him as a one-time lord of Leinster, which could be evidence that he had tried to seize Leinster at some point in his career.<ref>[[#A2|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013a)]] <U+00A7> 1135.5; [[#A3|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013b)]] <U+00A7> 1135.5; [[#D5|Duffy (2006)]] p. 71; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 117 n. 117; [[#K1|Kelleher (1988)]] p. 23 n. 4.</ref> The ''Annals of Tigernach'' apparently also record Domnall's death, although the annal-entry identifies him as a grandson of Muirchertach Ua Briain.<ref>[[#T1|''The Annals of Tigernach'' (2010)]] <U+00A7> 1135.11; [[#A1|''Annals of Tigernach'' (2005)]] <U+00A7> 1135.11; [[#K1|Kelleher (1988)]] p. 23 n. 4.</ref> Long afterwards in 1157, [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn|Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cen<U+00E9>l nE<U+00F3>gain]] (died 1166), a contender to the Irish high-kingship, invaded the partitioned Munster and forced the submission of Diarmait Mac Carthaig,<ref>[[#O4|O'Byrne (2005a)]]; [[#K1|Kelleher (1988)]] p. 23.</ref> and further drove out Toirdelbach mac Diarmata U<U+00ED> Briain&mdash;the son of Domnall's aforesaid uncle, Diarmait Ua Briain<ref>[[#K1|Kelleher (1988)]] p. 23.</ref>&mdash;and replaced him with another U<U+00ED> Briain dynast, Conchobar mac Domnaill U<U+00ED> Briain, King of Ormond.<ref>[[#O4|O'Byrne (2005a)]]; [[#K1|Kelleher (1988)]] p. 23.</ref> The latter was likely a brother of Lughaid mac Domnaill U<U+00ED> Briain who was slain in the [[battle of M<U+00F3>in Mh<U+00F3>r]] in 1151. Both men&mdash;Conchobar and Lughaid&mdash;could well have been sons of Domnall himself,<ref>[[#K1|Kelleher (1988)]] pp. 23 n. 4, 24&ndash;26.</ref> although another candidate may be his like-named first cousin, Domnall mac Taidc.<ref>[[#K1|Kelleher (1988)]] p. 23 n. 4.</ref>
