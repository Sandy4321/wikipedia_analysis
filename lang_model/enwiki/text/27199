The '''CSS ''Neuse''''' was an [[ironclad warship]] of the [[Confederate States Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The remains of the ship can now be seen at an exhibit in [[Kinston, North Carolina]] as the '''CSS Neuse State Historic Site''' and '''Governor Caswell Memorial'''. The ship is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>[http://www.nr.nps.gov/iwisapi/explorer.dll?IWS_SCHEMA=NRIS1&IWS_LOGIN=1&IWS_REPORT=100000044 Impromptu Web Query<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

==Construction==
A contract for the construction on the CSS ''Neuse'' was signed on 17 October 1862 by the shipbuilding company of Thomas Howard and Elijah Ellis and the Confederate Navy. Work began in October on the bank across the [[Neuse River]] (her namesake) in [[North Carolina]] from the small village of Whitehall (present day [[Seven Springs, North Carolina|Seven Springs]]). She was designed similarly to the {{ship|CSS|Albemarle}}. Her hull structure was {{convert|158|ft|m}} long by {{convert|34|ft|m}} wide made of mostly [[pine]] wood, abundant in the region. Many delays were incurred due to the lack of materials, mostly [[wrought iron]] for her deck plating. The [[Confederate Army]] exercised priority over the Navy on use of the railroads.

==Armament==
She was fitted with two {{convert|6.4|in|mm|sing=on}} [[John Mercer Brooke|Brooke]] [[Brooke rifle|rifled cannon]] (similar to a [[Parrott rifle]]). Each weighed more than 12,000 pounds.

==Service history==
Launched in November 1863, ''Neuse'' sailed in April 1864 for duty on the inland waters of North Carolina as part of the force under Comdr. R. F. Pinkney, CSN. Shortly thereafter she grounded off Kinston and remained fast for almost a month. She never left the river, and in March 1865 she was burned by the Confederates to escape capture by the [[Union Army]] under Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].

==Recovery==
Nearly a century later the remains of the ship were discovered. It was raised in 1963. Later the ship was installed beside the river at the Governor Caswell Memorial in Kinston.

==Replica==
A full-size replica called the CSS Neuse II is on display at a separate site in Kinston. Constructed by volunteers from 2002 to 2009, it is reportedly the only full-size replica of a Confederate gunship.
