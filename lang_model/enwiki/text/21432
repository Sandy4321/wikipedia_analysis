Aside from writing the ''Potter'' novels, Rowling is perhaps equally famous for her "[[rags to riches]]" life story, in which she progressed from living on welfare to multi-millionaire status within five years.

As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would usually then read to her sister. She recalls that <blockquote>"I can still remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a rabbit called Rabbit.

After Jessica's birth and the separation from her husband, Rowling had left her teaching job in Portugal.

Rowling has said she particularly dislikes the British tabloid ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', which made references to a stalker Rowling insists does not exist, and conducted interviews with her estranged ex-husband. As one journalist noted, "Harry's [[Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] is a grotesque philistine of violent tendencies and remarkably little brain. It is not difficult to guess which newspaper Rowling gives him to read [in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]'']."<ref name=vernon>Lockerbie, Catherine. {{cite web|title="All aboard the Hogwarts Express"|work=[[The Scotsman]]|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-scotsman-lockerbie.html}} 11 July 2000.

Some have speculated that Rowling's fraught relationship with the press was the inspiration behind the character [[Rita Skeeter]]. However, Rowling noted in 2000 that the character actually predates her rise to fame: "People have asked me whether Rita Skeeter was invented [to reflect ''Harry Potter'''s popularity], but in fact she was always planned."<ref>{{cite web|title="About the Books: transcript of J.K.

She wasn't called Rita then but she was a woman. And then I thought, as I looked at the plot overall, I thought, that's not really where she fits best, she fits best in Four when Harry's supposed to come to terms with his fame."<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/fall00-bbc-newsround.html Transcript of interview with J.K.

==Philanthropy==
In 2000, Rowling established the Volant Charitable Trust, which uses its annual budget of <U+00A3>5.1 million to combat [[poverty]] and social inequality. The fund also gives to organisations that aid children, one parent families, and multiple sclerosis research.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Volant Charitable Trust (UK and overseas)|work=Merseyside Funding|year=|url=http://www.mfip.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1085&Itemid=27}} Accessed 19 January 2008.</ref> Rowling said, "I think you have a moral responsibility when you've been given far more than you need, to do wise things with it and give intelligently."<ref name=USAToday200707 />
===Anti-poverty===
Rowling, once a single parent herself, is now president of the charity [[One Parent Families]], having already become their first Ambassador in 2000.<ref name="OPF">{{cite web|url=http://www.oneparentfamilies.org.uk/|title=One Parent Families Gingerbread|work=OneParentFamilies}}.

In 2001, the UK anti-poverty fundraiser [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] asked three bestselling British authors <U+2013> cookery writer and TV presenter [[Delia Smith]], ''[[Bridget Jones]]'' creator [[Helen Fielding]], and Rowling <U+2013> to submit booklets related to their most famous works for publication.<ref>Goodson, Rory and Chittenden, Maurice.

Since going on sale in March 2001, the books have raised <U+00A3>15.7 million ($30 million) for the fund. The <U+00A3>10.8 million ($20 million) they have raised outside the UK have been channeled into a newly created International Fund for Children and Young People in Crisis.<ref>[http://www.comicrelief.com/stuff-to-buy/harrys-books/the-money/ The Money]. Comic Relief. Accessed 25 October 2007.</ref>

In 2005, Rowling and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Emma Nicholson]] founded the Children's High Level Group.<ref>{{cite web|title=Children's High Level Group|url=http://www.chlg.org/who-we-are.asp|publisher=The Children's Voice}} Accessed 1 November 2007.</ref> In January 2006, Rowling went to [[Bucharest]] to highlight the use of caged beds in children's [[mental institution]]s.<ref> [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=91 Launch of the Children's High Level Group].

===Political donation===
In September 2008, on the eve of the [[Labour Party Conference]], Rowling announced that she had donated <U+00A3>1&nbsp;million to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], saying in a statement: <blockquote>
"I believe that poor and vulnerable families will fare much better under the Labour Party than they would under a [[David Cameron|Cameron]]-led Conservative Party. Gordon Brown has consistently prioritised and introduced measures that will save as many children as possible from a life lacking in opportunity or choice. The Labour government has reversed the long-term trend in child poverty, and is one of the leading EU countries in combating child poverty. David Cameron's promise of tax perks for the married, on the other hand, is reminiscent of the Conservative government I experienced as a lone parent. It sends the message that the Conservatives still believe a childless, dual-income, but married couple is more deserving of a financial pat on the head than those struggling, as I once was, to keep their families afloat in difficult times."<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter author JK Rowling gives <U+00A3>1 million to Labour|author=Ben Leach|year=2008|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/3021309/Harry-Potter-author-JK-Rowling-gives-1-million-to-Labour.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref>

===Multiple sclerosis===

Rowling has contributed money and support for research and treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]], from which her mother died in 1990. In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward the creation of a new Centre for Regenerative Medicine at [[Edinburgh University]]. For reasons unknown, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of multiple sclerosis in the world.<ref>MS Society, Scotland [http://www.research-innovation.ed.ac.uk/records/news/20060421MSresearch.asp JK Rowling funds new MS centre].

===Other philanthropic work===
In May 2008, bookseller [[Waterstones]] asked Rowling and 12 other writers ([[Sebastian Faulks]], [[Doris Lessing]], [[Lisa Appignanesi]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Lauren Child]], [[Richard Ford]], [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Nick Hornby]], [[Michael Rosen]], [[Axel Scheffler]], [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[Irvine Welsh]]) to compose a short piece of their own choosing on a single [[ISO 216|A5]] card, which would then be sold at auction in aid of the charities Dyslexia Action and English [[International PEN|PEN]].
