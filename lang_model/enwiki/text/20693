'''Padeniye Berlina''') is a 1950 two-part [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] film directed by [[Mikhail Chiaureli]]. The plot revolves around the history of the [[Great Patriotic War]], focusing on the role that [[Joseph Stalin]] played in the events. It is considered as one of the most important representations of Stalin's [[cult of personality]].

==Plot==
===Part 1===
Alexei Ivanov, a shy steel factory worker, [[Stakhanovite movement|greatly surpasses his production quota]] and is chosen to receive the [[Order of Lenin]] and to have a personal interview with [[Joseph Stalin]]. Alexei falls in love with the idealist teacher Natasha, but has difficulties approaching her. When he meets Stalin, who tends his garden, the leader helps him to understand his emotions and tells him to recite poetry to Natasha. Then, they both have a luncheon with the rest of the Soviet leadership in Stalin's home. After he returns from Moscow, Alexei confesses his love to Natasha. While they are both having a stroll in a wheat field, their town is attacked by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]], who [[Operation Barbarossa|invade the Soviet Union]]. 

Alexei loses his consciousness and sinks into a coma. When he awakes, he is told that Natasha is missing and that the Germans are at the gates of Moscow. In the capital, Stalin plans the defense of the city, explaining to the demoralized [[Georgy Zhukov]] how to deploy his forces. Alexei volunteers to the [[Red Army]], takes part in the parade in the Red Square and in the [[Battle of Moscow]]. At Berlin, after receiving the blessings of his allies - [[Turkey]], the [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Romania]] and [[Japan]] - and watching a long column of [[OST-Arbeiter|Soviet slaves-laborers]], Natasha among them, [[Adolf Hitler]] is furious to hear that Moscow has not fallen. He dismisses [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] from his office and offers the command of the army to [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]; the latter refuses, saying that Stalin is a great captain and Germany's defeat is certain. Hitler orders to [[Battle of Stalingrad|attack Stalingrad]]. In the meanwhile, G<U+00F6>ring negotiates with British capitalist Bedstone, who supplies Germany with needed materials. After the Soviet victory in Stalingrad, [[Vasily Chuikov]] tells Ivanov that Stalin is always with the Red Army. The storyline leaps to the [[Yalta Conference]], where Stalin and his [[Western Allies]] debate the future of the war. The treacherous [[Winston Churchill]] intends to deny the Soviets access to Berlin and almost manages to convince the gullible [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] to accept his plans.

===Part 2===
Stalin asks his generals who will take Berlin, they or the Western Allies. The generals answer that they will capture the city. Alexei's Guards Army advances towards Berlin, while Hitler has a nervous breakdown and demands that his soldiers fight to the end. The Germans plan to execute the inmates of the concentration camp in which Natasha is held before the arrival of the Red Army, but Alexei's unit liberates the prisoners before they carry through their design. Natasha faints, and he does not find her. Hitler and the German leadership fall into despair and lose their grip on reality the closer the Soviets get to Berlin. Hitler orders to flood the subway stations as the Soviets approach, drowning thousands of civilians. He then marries [[Eva Braun]] and commits suicide. [[Hans Krebs (general)|Hans Krebs]] carries the news of Hitler's death to the Red Army and begs for a ceasefire. Stalin orders to accept only an unconditional surrender. Alexei is chosen to carry the [[Victory Banner]], alongside [[Mikhail Yegorov]] and [[Meliton Kantaria]]. Their division storms the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] and the three hoist the banner atop of it. The Germans surrender and Red Army soldiers from throughout the USSR celebrate victory. Stalin's plane lands in Berlin, and he is greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of soldiers and liberated slave-laborers, holding posters with his picture and waving red flags. Stalin carries a speech in which he calls for world peace. Standing in the crowd, Alexei and Natasha recognize each other and are reunited. Natasha asks Stalin to let her kiss him on the cheek, and they hug while prisoners praise Stalin in numerous languages. The film ends with Stalin wishing all peace and happiness.

===Background===
Stalin's cult of personality, which began to manifest itself already at the late 1930s, was marginalized during World War II; to mobilize the population against the enemy, Soviet films focused on historical heroes who defended Russia or on the feats of the people themselves.<ref name = "Front"/> The premier's character appeared in only two pictures during the war.<ref name = "Icon">{{cite book |author=Victoria E. Bonnell|title=Iconography of Power|year=1999|location=|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520221536}} Page 253.</ref> However, as victory seemed secure, Stalin tightened his control over every aspect of the Soviet society, including cinema. After 1945, his cult returned to the screen with greater intensity than ever before, and he was credited as the sole architect of Germany's defeat. Denise J. Youngblood wrote that shortly afterwards, there remained only three kinds of war heroes: "the dead, the maimed and Stalin."<ref name = "Front">{{cite book |author=Denise J.

===Inception===
Mikheil Chiaureli, Stalin's favourite director,<ref name = "Story"/><ref name = "Taylor"/> and writer [[Pyotr Pavlenko]] have already collaborated to create the 1946 personality cult picture ''[[The Vow (1946 film)|The Vow]]''. The Soviet Minister of Cinema, Ivan Bolshakov, instructed them both to begin work on ''The Fall of Berlin'' shortly after the release of ''The Vow'' at July 1946.<ref name="History">{{cite web |url=http://urokiistorii.ru/2010/09/3-chiaureli%20|title="<U+041F><U+0430><U+0434><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> <U+0411><U+0435><U+0440><U+043B><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430>": <U+043C><U+0438><U+0444> <U+043E> <U+0421><U+0442><U+0430><U+043B><U+0438><U+043D><U+0435>, <U+0441><U+043E><U+0437><U+0434><U+0430><U+043D><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+0438><U+043C> | trans_title=''The Fall of Berlin'': Stalin's Myth, Made By Him| language =Russian |author=Olga Romanova |date=|publisher=|work=urokiistorii.ru|accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref>  The film was conceived as the Mosfilm studio's gift to Stalin for his official 70th birthday,<ref group="a">Most historians believe that Stalin's date of birth was 18 December 1878, based on various documents.

Spring|title=Stalinism and Soviet cinema|year=1993|location=|publisher=Routledg|isbn=978-0415072854}} page 88.</ref> ''The Fall'' was supposed to be part of a cycle of ten films about the premier's role in World War II, entitled ''Stalin's Ten Blows'', though not corresponding with the [[Stalin's ten blows|eponymous series of Eastern Front campaigns]]. The project was only partially fulfilled until Stalin's death.<ref name="History"/>

===Development===
As with all films in which his character made an appearance, Stalin took a keen interest in the work on ''The Fall of Berlin''.<ref name = "Taylor">{{cite book |author=Richard Taylor|title=Film propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany|year=1999|location=|publisher=I.B. Tauris|isbn=978-1860641671}} pages 99-127.</ref> The premier intervened in Pavlenko's writing, read the screenplay's manuscript and corrected several grammatical mistakes; he also deleted a short sequence during which a German civilian in Berlin exhorted his family to hasten and flee as the Red Army approaches. German historian Lars Karl believed that this signaled his resolution to demonstrate that the civilian populace had nothing to fear from the Soviets.<ref name = "Karl"/> The picture was the first feature film about the Battle of Berlin and the events in Hitler's bunker, preceding ''[[Der letzte Akt]]'' by five years.<ref name = "Perspective">{{cite book |author=Leen Engelen, Roel Vande Winkel|title=Perspectives on European film and history|year=2007|location=|publisher=Academia Scientific|isbn=978-9038210827}} page 185 .</ref> 

[[Edvard Radzinsky]] claimed his father heard from Pavlenko that ''[[The Vow (1946 film)|The Vow]]'' and ''The Fall of Berlin'' were both overlayed with Christian motifs, and were intended to sublimely identify Stalin with [[Jesus]]: in the first, Lenin has acted like [[John the Baptist]] and recognized him as the messiah; in the second, he had fought and defeated Hitler, whose character represented the [[Antichrist]].<ref name = "Rad">{{cite book |author=Edvard Radzinsky|title=Stalin|year=1996|location=|publisher=Random House|isbn= 978-0553474039}} page 536.</ref> Russian historian Alexander Prokhorov believed that the film was influenced by Nazi propaganda films.<ref name="Pro">{{cite web |url=http://www.kinokultura.com/2006/12-prokhorov.shtml|title=Size Matters: The Ideological Functions of the Length of Soviet Feature Films|author=Alexander Prokhorovr |year=2006|work= kinokultura.ru|accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref> Author John Riley claimed that the scene in which Stalin's plane arrives in Berlin - that was fictional; Stalin never flew to the German capital, let alone on the day of the capture of the Reichstag<ref name = "Era">{{cite book |author=Philip Boobbyer|title=The Stalin Era|year=2000|location=|publisher=Springer Verlag|isbn=978-0415182980}} page 113.</ref> - was modeled after Hitler's landing in Munich from the ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', and that the film's ending was inspired by a similar sequence from ''[[Kolberg (film)|Kolberg]]''; the storming of the Reichstag "parodied" the massacre on the [[Potemkin Stairs|Odessa Steps]] from ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'', a gesture intended to mock [[Sergei Eisenstein]], according to Riley.<ref name = "Life"/>  

According to the memories of [[Svetlana Aliluyeva]], Chiaureli approached her father with the idea to combine the fate of his son, [[Yakov Dzhugashvili]], in the plot. Stalin promptly rejected this.<ref name = "Dancer">{{cite book |author=David Caute |title=The Dancer Defects: the Struggle for Cultural Supremacy During the Cold War|year=2003|location=|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199249084}} Pages 143-146.</ref> Soviet actor Artyom Karapetian claimed Chiaureli's wife, actress Veriko Anjaparidze, told him Stalin was so outraged when he heard of this that [[Lavrentiy Beria]] - who was standing nearby -  reached into his trousers' pocket, "presumably, for his gun."<ref name="Karapetian">{{cite web |url=http://noev-kovcheg.1gb.ru/article.asp?n=99&a=14|title=<U+0412><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0439> <U+043A><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D>| trans_title=Second Caravan| language =Russian |author= Artiom Karapetian|date=|publisher= |work=noev-kovcheg.ru|accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref> The director's daughter, [[Sofiko Chiaureli]], recounted that her father "knew that he was saved" when Stalin wiped tears from his eyes as he watched Gelovani descend from the plane and muttered "If only I have went to Berlin."<ref name = "Story">{{cite book |author=Wendell Steavenson|title=Stories I Stole|year=2003|location=|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=978-0802117373}} page 43 .</ref>

===Principal photography===
Chiaureli brought some 10,000 Soviet extras to Berlin for the filming, and also hired many local residents for the tunnel flooding sequence; He wasn't able to work in the Reichstag, that was located in the British Zone of West Berlin, and conducted the photography mainly in the [[Babelsberg Studios]].<ref name="Spi">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-44448956.html|title=Frau Hitler reicht das Gift| trans_title=Mrs. Hitler is Satisfied with the Poison| language =German |author=non-credited writer |date=13 July 1950|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|work=spiegel.de|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref> However, most of the episodes set in the German capital were filmed in ruined cities in the [[Baltic region]].<ref name="Abgesang">{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/1991/39/die-meister-des-abgesangs|title=Die Meister des Abgesangs| trans_title=The Masters of the Swan Song| language =German |author=Andreas Kilb |date=20 September 1991|publisher=[[Die Zeit]]|work=zeit.de|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref> In addition, a scale model of the Berlin, over one square kilometer in size,<ref name = "Kino">{{cite book|last1=unknown|first1=author|last2=|first2=|title=Iskusstvo kino, Issues 9-12|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=yk61TanJLcnX8gPyqYyWDA&ct=result&id=jAILAQAAMAAJ&dq=%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5+%D0%91%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%A7%D0%B8%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8&q=300#search_anchor|accessdate=30 April 2011|year=1996|publisher=State Committee of Cinematographylishers|issn=0021-1788|page=79}}</ref> was built in Mosfilm's studios; this miniature was to create the urban combat scenes in the end of Part II.<ref name="History"/><ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Ogoniok]]|year=29 January 1951|volume=|issue=1182|pages=12 |title= Padeniya Berlina|author= Mikhail Chiaureli |issn=0131-0097 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nYJBAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA12&dq=%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%82+%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0&hl=en&ei=Qpp3Tpn8HIqB4ASJifmoDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%82%20%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0&f=false |format= |accessdate=2011-09-19 }}</ref> 

The Soviet Army provided five divisions, their supporting artillery formations, four tank battalions, 193 military aircraft and 45 captured German tanks to recreate the open field battles portrayed in ''The Fall of Berlin''. They consumed 1.5 million liters of fuel during the filming.<ref name = "Karl">{{cite book |author= Thomas Lindenberger (editor)|title=Massenmedien im Kalten Krieg: Akteure, Bilder, Resonanzen|year=2006|location=|publisher=B<U+00F6>hlau Verlag|isbn=978-3412231057}} pages 83-90.</ref> 

''The Fall of Berlin'' was one of the first colored films made in the Soviet Union. The producers used [[Agfacolor]] reels, taken from [[Universum Film AG|UFA]]'s studios in [[Potsdam-Babelsberg|Neubabelsberg]].<ref name = "Taylor"/>

===Music===
Composer [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], who was accused of [[Anti-formalism campaign|Formalism]] during 1948, was called on to compose the score. [[Vano Muradeli]] told the composer's biographer John Riley that his contribution to ''The Fall of Berlin'' and other Stalinist films was the only thing that saved him from persecution by the establishment. Riley wrote that the film's score, along with ''[[Song of the Forests]]'', "was the closest Shostakhovich came to overt praise for Stalin." One additional piece of music used in ''The Fall of Berlin'' was [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s [[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|Wedding March]], heard during the scene in which Hitler marries Eva Braun; the march was banned in Nazi Germany. According to Riley, it is unclear whether Chiaureli intended to mock the Nazis by portraying them as unable to recognize an item they have forbidden, or he has simply been ignorant of the ban.<ref name = "Life">{{cite book |author=John Riley|title=Dmitri Shostakovich: a Life in Film|year=2005|location=|publisher=I.B.

The East German political establishment excessively promoted the picture, as well; It was officially classified as a documentary, and all servicemen of the [[Kasernierte Volkspolizei|Barracked People's Police]] were obliged to watch it. However, ''The Fall of Berlin'' was received with little enthusiasm by the populace. Years later, in an article he wrote for the ''Deutshce Filmkunst'' magazine on 30 October 1959, Sigfried Silbermann - director of the state film distributor Progress-Film Verleih - attributed this response to the effect that years of anti-Soviet propaganda had on the German people.<ref name = "Karl"/> 

''The Fall of Berlin'' was distributed in Western Europe shortly after its release, but most countries, including France, banned it.<ref name="Abgesang"/><ref name = "Nat">{{cite book |author=Natasha Laurent|title= Le cin<U+00E9>ma stalinien : Questions d'histoire|year=2003|location=Toulouse|publisher= PU Mirail|isbn= 978-2858165995}} pages 224-225.</ref> It reached the United Kingdom and the United States only at 1952 - during the [[Korea War]]. In the UK, the film was one of the few foreign-language pictures to be presented in the BBC's program ''Current Release''; former war correspondent Matthew Halton was invited to comment on it.

===De-Stalinization===
Stalin's death at March 1953 signaled a sharp turn in the politics of the Eastern Bloc. After Beria was arrested and executed, Chiaureli was instructed by the new rulers to leave Moscow.<ref name = "Khru">{{cite book |author=Nikita Sergeevich Khrushchev, Serge<U+012D> Khrushchev|title=Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev, Volume 2 |year=|location=|publisher= Brown University|isbn=978-0-271-02861-3}} pages 41-42.</ref> ''The Fall of Berlin'' was withdrawn from circulation. A directive of the Soviet Film Export Bureau to halt its screening reached East Germany at July.<ref name = "Karl"/> During the summer of 1953, the scene featuring Alexei Ivanov dining with Stalin and the other Soviet leaders in Moscow was edited out from all available copies; author Richard Taylor attributed this to the appearance Beria's character had there.<ref name = "Taylor"/> In the post-1953 version, Ivanov is introduced to Stalin, and is then shown strolling with Natasha in the wheat field. 

On February 1956, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] delivered a [[Secret Speech|speech condemning Stalin's cult of personality]] in front of the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. In the midst of it, he told the audience: "Let us recall the film, ''The Fall of Berlin''. Here only Stalin acts. He issues orders in a hall in which there are many empty chairs. Only one man approaches him to report something to him - it is [[Alexander Poskrebyshev|Poskrebyshev]]... And where is the military command? Where is the politburo? Where is the government? What are they doing, and with what are they engaged? There is nothing about them in the film. Stalin acts for everybody, he does not reckon with anyone. He asks no one for advice. Everything is shown to the people in this false light. Why? To surround Stalin with glory - contrary to the facts and contrary to historical truth."<ref name="Speech">{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2007/apr/26/greatspeeches3 |title=The cult of the individual - part 3|author=Nikita Khrushchev |date=25 February 1956|work=Guardian.uk |accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref>  Following the speech, the film was banned altogether, and all of its copies were placed in the archives.<ref name = "Taylor"/> However, it continued to be screened in the [[People's Republic of China]], the leadership of which [[Anti-Revisionism|opposed Khrushchev's criticism of Stalin]].<ref name = "China">{{cite book |author=Olivia Khoo, Sean Metzger|title=Futures of Chinese Cinema|year=2009|location=|publisher=Intellect Ltd|isbn=978-1841502748}} page 80.</ref>

===Critical analysis===
Historian Nikolas H<U+00FC>llbusch viewed ''The Fall of Berlin'' as a representation of Stalin's strengthening political power. He compared it to the first fiction film that featured the premier, the 1937 ''[[Lenin in 1918]]'', which depicted Stalin as [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s most devout disciple; and to ''The Vow'', in which he is chosen as Lenin's heir and takes an oath to keep his legacy. In ''The Fall of Berlin'', Lenin has no impact on the plot. Instead of being the state founder's successor, Stalin's legitimacy was now based on his leadership of the USSR during the war.<ref name ="Cult">{{cite book |author=Klaus Heller,Jan Plamper<U+200F>|title=Personality cults in Stalinism |year=2004|location=G<U+00F6>ttingen|publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht|isbn=9783899711912}} Pages 227-238.</ref> 

Denise Youngblood wrote that the film, although not the first to portray Stalin as "war hero in chief" - that was already done in pictures like ''[[The Battle of Stalingrad (1949 movie)|The Battle of Stalingrad]]'' - elevated him to a new status: "it deified Stalin."<ref name = "Front"/> Richard Taylor pointed out that the premier was the only decision maker in the plot, the only one responsible for the victory over Germany, and all other characters were either subservient or antagonistic. Stalin's stoic calm was stressed out by deliberately contrasting it to the hysterical rage of Hitler, or to the slow wit of [[Georgy Zhukov]], who was portrayed in accordance with his political status at the late 1940s, after he was shunned by Stalin: Zhukov was not even among the generals who received Stalin in Berlin. Beside this, most characters - from Natasha to [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] - praise him as a great leader.<ref name = "Taylor"/> Author Katerina Clark discerned that Stalin, beside his function as a great captain, was made the enabler of romantic relationship: before meeting him, Alexei was incapable of expressing his love to Natasha.<ref name = "Land">{{cite book |author=Evgeny Dobrenko, Eric Naiman|title=The landscape of Stalinism: the art and ideology of Soviet space|year=|location=2005|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0295983417}} page 16.</ref> [[Slavoj <U+017D>i<U+017E>ek]] commented that Stalin played the part of the "magician and the matchmaker who wisely leads the couple to reunion."<ref name = "Zizek">{{cite book |author=Slavoj <U+017D>i<U+017E>ek|title=In Defense of Lost Causes|year=2008|location=|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1844671083}} Page 59.</ref>
Alexei's character was not intended to be perceived as an individual,<ref group="a">It is interesting to note that Alexei Ivanov served as the third man in the group that carried the [[Victory Banner]], alongside two historical figures: [[Mikhail Yegorov]] and [[Meliton Kantaria]]. The other two were officially recognized and were awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. There was another person with the two in the Reichstag, though: [[Alexei Berest]], a junior political officer. His part in the operation was silenced until years after Stalin's death.</ref> but rather, a symbol to the entire Soviet people: he was depicted as an archetypal worker; his date of birth is given as 25 October 1917 by the [[Julian Calendar]], the day of the [[October Revolution]].<ref name = "Front"/> 

The movie also made many references to the political situation in Europe. [[Turkey]], which was a neutral country during the war but a rival of the Soviet Union in the [[Cold War]], was portrayed as if it was an Axis state; the Turkish ambassador even greeted Hitler in the name of [[<U+0130>smet <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>]]. The Nazi sympathies of Vatican ambassador [[Cesare Orsenigo]] were emphasized as well. Churchill, seen as an enemy after his 1946 [[Iron_Curtain#Iron_Curtain_speech|Fulton Speech]], was portrayed in a highly negative fashion.<ref name = "Taylor"/>

The film is regarded by many critics as the epitome of Stalin's cult of personality in cinema: Denise Youngblood wrote that "it was impossible to go further" in the "veneration" of him;<ref name = "Front"/> Philip Boobbyer claimed that the cult reached "extraordinary proportions" with its release;<ref name = "Era"/> Lars Karl opined that it "stood above any other part of the cult";<ref name = "Karl"/> Slavoj <U+017D>i<U+017E>ek regarded it as the "supreme case of the Stalinist epic"<ref name = "Zizek"/> Nikolas H<U+00FC>llbusch commented that it was the "zenith" of the representation of Stalin's screen "alter-ego";<ref name ="Cult"/> and Richard Taylor believed that it was "the apotheosis of Stalin's cult of Stalin".<ref name = "Taylor"/>

===Restoration===
In 1991, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union ''The Fall of Berlin'' had its first public screening in thirty-five years, during the [[48th Venice International Film Festival]].<ref name="Abgesang"/> On 2003, the film was remastered by a company from [[Toulouse]], in a relatively poor quality. At 2007, it was re-released by the American group International Historical Films. No available version contains the Beria scene, though several old uncensured copies of the film appear to exist.<ref name="Taylor2">{{cite web |url=http://www.kinokultura.com/2007/15r-padenie.shtml |title=Mikhail Chiaureli: The Fall of Berlin (Padenie Berlina, two parts, 1949)|author=Richard Taylor |year=2007|work= kinokultura.ru|accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref>
