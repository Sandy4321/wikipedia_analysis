'''Typhoon Helen''' was the most destructive [[tropical cyclone]] to strike [[Japan]] during the [[1972 Pacific typhoon season]]. Originating from a tropical disturbance on September&nbsp;11 near the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], Helen gradually intensified as it moved northwestward. By September&nbsp;14, it reached typhoon strength and soon turned northeast towards Japan. Accelerating due to a [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] over the [[East China Sea]], Helen rapidly approached the country and made [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near Cape Kushimoto as a [[SSHS#Category 3|Category&nbsp;3 equivalent]] typhoon on the [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. Later that day, a weakened Helen emerged into the [[Sea of Japan]]. After merging with an [[upper-level low]], the storm transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on September&nbsp;19 and was last noted two days later after moving through southern [[Hokkaido]].

In Japan, Typhoon Helen produced torrential rain, peaking at {{convert|790|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in Hokkaido, and damaging winds that caused widespread damage. A total of 4,213 homes were destroyed and another 146,547 were damaged as a result of [[flash flood]]ing and landslides. Numerous vessels ran aground due to rough seas associated with the storm, including several thousand ton cargo freighters. In all, 87 fatalities and $102&nbsp;million in damage was attributed to Typhoon Helen.

In early September&nbsp;1972, a tropical disturbance developed within a [[near-equatorial trough]] near the [[Northern Mariana Islands]].<ref name="ATCR">{{cite web|author=Lt. Ryan R.

On September&nbsp;13, a [[Air Force Weather Agency|United States Air Force]] [[Weather reconnaissance|reconnaissance plane]] flew into the system and found that it had intensified into a tropical storm. At this time, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center|Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)]] began monitoring the newly named Tropical Storm Helen.<ref name="ATCR"/>{{#tag:ref|The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] is a joint [[United States Navy]] &ndash; [[United States Air Force]] task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the western Pacific Ocean and other regions.<ref>{{cite web|work=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy|title=Joint Typhoon Warning Center Mission Statement|year=2011|accessdate=January 2, 2012|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070726103400/https://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/menu/JTWC_mission.html}}</ref>|group="nb"}} Additionally, the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] began warning on the system, assigning it the local name ''Paring''.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Typhoon 2000|year=2011|accessdate=January 2, 2011|url=http://www.typhoon2000.ph/stormarchives/1963-1988_PTC.txt|title=1963-1988 PAGASA Storm Names}}</ref> The following day, Helen attained typhoon status as it turned northward. Subsequently, a deepening [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] over the [[East China Sea]] caused the typhoon to turn north-northeastward and accelerate.<ref name="ATCR"/>

During the afternoon of September&nbsp;16, a reconnaissance plane recorded flight-level winds of 185&nbsp;km/h (115&nbsp;mph). Around this time, surface winds were estimated to be the same, making Helen a [[SSHS#Category 3|Category&nbsp;3 equivalent]] on the [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. Later that day, the storm made [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Cape Kushimoto]]. In Shinomisaki, just west of where the center of Helen passed, a [[barometric pressure]] of 956.9&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] ([[Pascal (unit)|hPa]]; 28.26&nbsp;[[Inches of Mercury|inHg]]) was recorded, the lowest in relation to the storm. As the system neared [[Hokkaido]], it slowed down and began a multi-day anticyclonic loop. During this period, it merged with an [[upper-level low]] and transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on September&nbsp;19.<ref name="ATCR"/> The remnants of Helen then tracked across southern Hokkaido before dissipating just east of the island on September&nbsp;21.<ref name="JMABT"/>

Throughout the main island of [[Honshu]], areas within 110&nbsp;km (70&nbsp;mi) of the storm's center experienced winds in excess of 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph), leading to considerable disruptions to air, sea, and land travel.
