{{History of Portugal}}
The '''Lusitanians''' (or '''Lusitani''' in [[Latin]]) were a tribe living in the west of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] long before it became the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman provinces|province]] of [[Lusitania]] (most of modern [[Portugal]], [[Extremadura]] and a small part of the [[Salamanca (province)|province of Salamanca]]). They spoke the [[Lusitanian language]], an [[Indo-European language]] which might have been a form of Celtic or influenced by Celtic. Modern [[Portuguese people]] see the Lusitanians as their ancestors. The most notable Lusitanian was [[Viriathus]].

==Origins==
Some modern authors consider them to be indigenous and initially dominated by the [[Celt]]s, before gaining full independence from them.  Alternatively, archeologist [[Scarlat Lambrino]] proposed that they were originally a tribal group of Celtic origin related to the [[Lusones]] of [[Saefs]] origin.
[[Diodorus Siculus]] considered the Lusitanians a ''Celtic'' people: "Those who are called Lusitanians are the bravest of all [[Cimbri]]".<ref>http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/classical_diodorus.html#B5|Diodorus Siculus.

Ethnological speculations abound on the origin Lusitanians and whether they had some substantial  connection with the Lusones or that the similarity in their tribal names was merely accidental.

The first area settled by the Lusitanians was probably the Douro valley and the region of [[Beira Alta]]; then they moved south, and expanded on both sides of the Tagus river, before being conquered by the Romans.

The original Roman province of Lusitania briefly included the territories of [[Asturia]] and [[Gallaecia]], but these were soon ceded to the jurisdiction of the ''Provincia Tarraconensis'' in the north, while the south remained the ''Provincia Lusitania et [[Vettones]]''. After this, Lusitania's northern border was along the Douro river, while its eastern border passed through ''Salmantica'' and ''Caesarobriga'' to the ''Anas'' ([[Guadiana]]) river.

== Culture ==
Categorising Lusitanian culture generally, including the language, is proving difficult. Some believe it was essentially a pre-Celtic Iberian culture with substantial Celtic influences, while  others argue that it was an essentially Celtic culture with strong indigenous pre-Celtic influences.[[File:L<U+00FA>nula lusitana de Ch<U+00E3>o de Lamas (M.A.N. 28589) 01.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Lusitanian [[Gold lunula|lunula]] from [[Miranda do Corvo]] ([[Portugal]])]]

Lusitanians lived in small quadrangular houses (round in the north) with a single floor, made of stones. Their clothes were made of wool or of goat skin. They wore necklaces, bracelets, and other jewelry made of gold. They made their jewels using a filigree method, or by hammering. Wine was only used in festivities and they usually drank water, goats milk and beer. Lusitanians practiced [[monogamy]]. They used boats made of leather, or from harvested lumber.

They used anointing-rooms twice a day and took baths in vapors that rose from heated stones, then bathing in cold water.

They practiced gymnastic exercises such as boxing and racing. They sacrificed goats, horses, and human prisoners to [[Cariocecus]], god of war.

In battles with the Romans, Lusitanians gained a reputation as fierce fighters. They used weapons such as the [[dagger]], the iron [[pilum|javelin]], and the brass [[spear]]. Roman records attest to their presence among [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] mercenaries in battles in the [[Pyrenees]].

== Religion ==
{{main|Lusitanian mythology}}

The Lusitanians worshipped various gods in a very diverse polytheism, using animal sacrifice. They represented their gods and warriors in rudimentary sculpture. [[Endovelicus]] was the most important god: his cult eventually spread across the Iberian peninsula and beyond, to the rest of the Roman Empire and his cult maintained until the 5th century; he was the god of public health and safety. The goddess [[Ataegina]] was especially popular in the south; as the goddess of rebirth (Spring), fertility, nature, and cure, she was identified with [[Proserpina]] during the Roman era. Lusitanian mythology was related to or heavily influenced by Celtic mythology, and during later Roman rule, it also became heavily influenced by Roman mythology, while the Romans also adopted some Lusitanian gods. Also well attested in inscriptions are the names [[Bandua]], often with a second name linked to a locality such as Bandua Aetobrico and [[Nabia]], possibly a goddess of rivers and streams.

The Lusitanians practiced the cult of the dead, and used cremation.

== Language ==
{{main|Lusitanian language}}

The Lusitanian language was a [[paleohispanic languages|paleohispanic language]] that clearly belongs to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family and may be related to the [[Celtiberian language]].

The precise filiation of the Lusitanian language inside [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family is still in debate: there are those who endorse that it is a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] language with an obvious "celticity" to most of the lexicon, over many anthroponyms and toponyms. A second theory relates Lusitanian with the [[Italic languages]]; based on a relation of the name of Lusitanian deities with other grammatical elements of the area. Finally, Ulrich Schmoll proposed a new branch to which he named "Galician-Lusitanian".

== Tribes ==

Turduli movement in red, Celtici in brown and Lusitanian in a blue colour. Most tribes neighbouring the Lusitanians were dependent on them. Names are in Latin.]]

The Lusitanians were a single large [[tribe]] that lived between the rivers [[Douro River|Douro]] and [[Tagus]]. As the Lusitanians fought fiercely against the Romans for independence, the name Lusitania was adopted by the [[Gallaeci]], tribes living north of the Douro, and other closely surrounding tribes, eventually spreading as a label to all the nearby peoples fighting Roman rule in the west of Iberia. It was for this reason that the Romans came to name their original province in the area, that initially covered the entire western side of the Iberian peninsula, Lusitania.

Tribes, often known by their Latin names, living in the area of modern Portugal, prior to Roman rule:
* [[Bardili (Turduli)]] ''- living in the Set<U+00FA>bal peninsula;''
* [[Bracari]] ''- living between the rivers T<U+00E2>mega and [[C<U+00E1>vado River|C<U+00E1>vado]], in the area of the modern city of [[Braga]];''
* [[Callaici]] ''-living north of the River Douro;''
* [[Celtici]] ''- Celts living in [[Alentejo]];''
* [[Coelerni]] ''- living in the mountains between the rivers Tua and Sabor;''
* [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii]] ''- living in the [[Algarve]] and the south of [[Alentejo]];''
* [[Equaesi]] ''- living in the most mountainous region of modern [[Portugal]];''
* [[Grovii]] ''- a mysterious tribe living in the Minho valley;''
* [[Interamici]] ''- living in [[Tr<U+00E1>s-os-Montes (region)|Tr<U+00E1>s-os-Montes]] and in the border areas with [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (in modern [[Spain]]);''
* [[Leuni]] ''- living between the rivers Lima and Minho;''
* [[Luanqui]] ''- living between the rivers T<U+00E2>mega and Tua;''
* Lusitani ''- being the most numerous and dominant of the region;''
* [[Limici]] ''- living in the swamps of the river Lima, on the border between Portugal and Galicia);''
* [[Narbasi]] ''- living in the north of modern Portugal (interior) and nearby area of southern Galicia;''
* [[Nemetati]] ''- living north of the Douro Valley in the area of Mondim;''
* [[Paesuri]] ''- a dependent tribe of the Lusitanians, living between the rivers Douro and Vouga;''
* [[Quaquerni]] ''- living in the mountains at the mouths of rivers Cavado and T<U+00E2>mega;''
* [[Seurbi]] ''- living between the rivers [[C<U+00E1>vado River|C<U+00E1>vado]] and Lima (or even reaching the river Minho);''
* [[Tamagani]] ''- from the area of [[Chaves, Portugal|Chaves]], near the river T<U+00E2>mega;''
* [[Tapoli]] ''- another dependent tribe of the Lusitanians, living north of the river Tagus, on the border between modern Portugal and Spain;''
* [[Turduli]] ''- in the east of [[Alentejo]] (Guadiana Valley);''
* [[Turduli Veteres]] ''- the "ancient Turduli" living south of the estuary of the river Douro;''
* [[Turdulorum Oppida]] ''- Turduli living in the Portuguese region of [[Estremadura Province (historical)|Estremadura]];''
* [[Turodi]] ''- living in [[Tr<U+00E1>s-os-Montes (region)|Tr<U+00E1>s-os-Montes]] and bordering areas of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]];''
* [[Vettones]] ''- living in the Spanish provinces of [[<U+00C1>vila (province)|<U+00C1>vila]] and [[Salamanca (province)|Salamanca]], as well as parts of [[Zamora (province)|Zamora]], [[Toledo (province)|Toledo]] and [[C<U+00E1>ceres (province)|C<U+00E1>ceres]];''
* [[Zoelae]] ''- living in the mountains of Serra da Nogueira, Sanabria and Culebra, up to the mountains of [[Mogadouro]] in northern Portugal and adjacent areas of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].''

== War with the Romans and eventual Romanisation ==
{{Campaignbox Roman conquest of Hispania}}
{{Main|Lusitanian War}}

Since 193 BC, the Lusitanians had been fighting the Romans. In 150 BC, they were defeated by Praetor Servius Galba: springing a clever trap, he killed 9,000 Lusitanians and later sold 20,000 more as slaves in [[Gaul]] (modern [[France]]).  Three years later (147 BC), [[Viriathus]] became the leader of the Lusitanians and severely damaged the Roman rule in Lusitania and beyond. In 139 BC Viriathus was betrayed and killed in his sleep by his companions (who had been sent as emissaries to the Romans), [[Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus]], bribed by [[Marcus Popillius Laenas]]. However, when Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus returned to receive their reward by the Romans, the Consul [[Quintus Servilius Caepio|Servilius Caepio]] ordered their execution, declaring, "Rome does not pay traitors".

After Viriathus' rule, the Lusitanians became largely romanised and more interbred with them, acquiring Roman culture and language; the Lusitanian cities, in a manner similar to those of the rest of the romanised Iberian peninsula, eventually gained the status of "Citizens of Rome". The [[Portuguese language]] itself is a local evolution of the Roman language, [[Latin]].

==Contemporary meaning==
{{further|[[Lusitanic]], [[Lusophone]]}}

Lusitanians are often used by Portuguese writers as a [[metaphor]] for the [[Portuguese people]], and  similarly, '''Lusophone''' is used to refer to a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] speaker.

'''Lusitanic'''  is at present a term used to categorize persons who share the linguistic and cultural traditions of the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-speaking nations and territories of [[Portugal]], [[Brazil]], [[Macau]], [[Timor-Leste]], [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]], [[Cape Verde]], [[S<U+00E3>o Tom<U+00E9> and Pr<U+00ED>ncipe]], [[Guinea Bissau]] and others.
