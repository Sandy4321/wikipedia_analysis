'''Stephen "Ste" Hay''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Kieron Richardson]]. He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 17 February 2006. Ste was created by David Hanson and was originally intended to be a short-term character for seven episodes. The following series producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] decided to bring the character back on a permanent basis. As of 2010, Richardson has revealed that he is committed to staying in the serial.

Ste has been at the centre of several storylines including joyriding, a baby kidnapping plot and a gay relationship. He was initially portrayed a "bad boy" type character. Although he changed producer [[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Allan]] wanted him to revert back. The issue of [[domestic violence]] has been portrayed through the character on two occasions: the first was his violence towards girlfriend [[Amy Barnes]], and the second when he suffered abuse from his boyfriend [[Brendan Brady]]. Richardson and co-star Slanina-Davies both fronted a anti-domestic abuse campaign called "Expect Respect" for [[Women's Aid Federation of England|Women's Aid]].

Ste's gay storyline prompted Richardson to [[come out]] as gay. Its aim was to raise awareness of domestic abuse in a homosexual relationship. Whilst Ste and his storylines have received a mixed reaction from critics, Richardson has been nominated for various awards for his portrayal. Some favour his gay storyline, whilst others bemoan the baby snatch storyline.

==Character creation and casting==
The character of Ste was originally a background character, who was cast by David Hanson for only seven episodes.<ref name="more">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a282075/more-from-hollyoaks-star-kieron-richardson.html |title=More from Hollyoaks star Kieron Richardson |work=Digital Spy |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-14<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vRcbHHt3|archivedate=02 January 2011 -->}}</ref> Upon completion of his initial short stint, new producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] decided to bring the character back for another handful of episodes in October 2006 in which Ste fled the scene of a car accident involving [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]). Following positive viewer feedback after this second stint, Kirkwood asked Richardson to reprise the role on a permanent basis beginning 26 September 2007.<ref name="more"/>

In 2010, speculation arose that Richardson would leave the show, due to his participation in [[ITV]] ice skating competition ''[[Dancing on Ice (UK)|Dancing on Ice]]''.<ref name=doile/> Richardson said "I'm not leaving, I'm staying put". He added his participation in the reality television series was for "fun",<ref name=doile/> and stating: "I still want to stay at ''Hollyoaks'' and progress in my career there" because he did not think he was a good enough actor to pursue other projects.<ref name=doile>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a193813/richardson-im-not-leaving-hollyoaks.html|title=Richardson: "I'm not leaving Hollyoaks"|work=Digital Spy|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Oli|last=Simpson|date=4 January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-04<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vRceir3v|archivedate=02 January 2011 -->}}</ref> However, he later revealed he was not sure executive producer [[Paul Marquess]] would renew his contract.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wrightman|first=Catriona|title=Richardson worried about 'Hollyoaks' axe|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a210668/richardson-worried-about-hollyoaks-axe.html|work=Digital Spy|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=2010-11-30|date=25 March 2010}}</ref> In November 2010, Richardson commented on his future with the show, branding it a new era and thankful to be part of it.<ref name=lamss/> Richardson stated: "Marquess loved everything I've been doing and wanted to keep me on.

==Development==
===Characterisation===
When Ste was introduced on ''Hollyoaks'', he was introduced as a violent and rebellious teenager who was often in trouble.  He bullied several of his peers, including [[Josh Ashworth]] ([[Sonny Flood]]), [[Jamie "Fletch" Fletcher]] ([[Sam Darbyshire]]) and [[Nicole Owen]] ([[Ciara Janson]]). His troublesome personality continued as he became a drug dealer, stole money and began hitting Amy. During 2009, Ste's persona improved when he became a single father to [[Lucas Hay]] (Jude) and Amy's daughter to a previous relationship, Leah [[Leah Barnes]] (Jessica Croft-Lane) after she developed [[post-natal depression]]. Ste began working in restaurant Il Gnosh to earn money for his children, showing that the character had matured.

In 2010, Richardson revealed that executive producer [[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Allan]] was going to return Ste to his "bad" ways.<ref name=dghved/> Richardson said that Ste had portrayed the whole "bad thing" and mellowed. He felt Ste was emulating fellow character [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]), because Ste was "running a restaurant, camping it up like him and talking like him".<ref name=dghved/> Allan wanted to change that and see him regain some old habits.<ref name=dghved>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a195041/hollyoaks-ste-to-return-to-bad-ways.html|title=Hollyoaks' Ste to return to bad ways?|work=Digital Spy|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Oli|last=Simpson|date=8 January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-08<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vRcWhFM0|archivedate=02 January 2011 -->}}</ref> These changes did not happen because Allan quit her position soon after.<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a196734/hollyoaks-producer-allan-quits-soap.html | title='Hollyoaks' producer Allan quits soap | work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] | author=Green, Kris |date=15 January 2010 | accessdate=2010-01-16 }}</ref>

Richardson later told ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that he hated Ste when he first joined the show, adding: "When he came into the show Ste was a bit of a skater boy, and I hated that." Richardson would recite his lines in "a sinister way and do under-the-eyebrows stuff", which Richardson felt inspired the writers to develop Ste's character more deeply.<ref name="hate">{{cite web|title=Hollyoaks' Kieron: 'I used to hate Ste'|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/hollyoaks/news/hollyoaks-kieron-i-used-to-hate-ste/11373|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[IPC Media]])|accessdate=2010-01-02|date=29 December 2010<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vRXquPo9|archivedate=02 January 2011 -->}}</ref>

===Domestic violence and fatherhood===
Returning later in 2007, Ste and Amy eventually got back together. The pair moved into their own flat, to the dismay of Amy's father [[Mike Barnes (Hollyoaks)|Mike Barnes]] ([[Tony Hirst]]). Despite this, Ste became increasingly violent and started to hit Amy, on one occasion even cutting off her ponytail.

Whilst the storyline aired, Richardson and Slanina-Davies fronted a charity campaign called "Expect Respect" in order to combat domestic violence.<ref name="respect"/> At the time Richardson released a statement opining domestic violence affects many young people in any form of life.

During April 2009, Amy gave birth to Lucas, and subsequently left due to [[post-natal depression]]. Ste was left looking after both Lucas, and Amy's daughter Leah. A couple, [[Abi Raven]] ([[Elaine Glover]]) and [[Daniel Raven]] (Chris Hargreaves) befriended Ste and tried to convince him that he was a good father, and that he did not need Amy in their lives. However, Abi and Daniel planned to kidnap Lucas, at first in order to keep him and then later on to give him to another family. Richardson expressed to [[Digital Spy]] his pleasure with this storyline, saying, "It's getting quite dark." He was also shocked with its entertaining and unexpected ending."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a164135/hollyoaks-ste-hints-at-baby-plot-ending.html|title=Hollyoaks Ste hints at baby plot ending|work=Digital Spy|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=8 July 2009|accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref> When the storyline came to its climax, Abi and Daniel tried to take Lucas, but they were stopped.

Ste told Amy's father Mike to look after Lucas and Leah in the aftermath of the baby plot because he didn't think he was a good father. Richardson reported that he enjoyed working with Jude and Jessica Croft-Lane, the young actors who played Lucas and Leah. He reported that Jude was camera shy and liked to play with camera equipment during filming and that he told Croft-Lane that his name was actually Ste.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Kieron Richardson is at your mercey|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=1 January 2011|issue=52|pages=48|accessdate=30 December 2010|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}</ref>

===Homosexual domestic violence===
During an interview on ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', Kieron Richardson revealed he was gay, and that Ste would explore his sexuality and come out as gay after embarking on a dangerous affair with his boss [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]). Ste saw a nicer side to Brendan and they formed an "unusual friendship," which eventually lead to having a wild lads night out and a drunken kiss. Brendan rejected Ste, giving into passion later, they kiss again.

[[File:Brendan and Ste.png|thumb|right|200px|Ste and Brendan's first kiss - a storyline development which attracted media coverage. (2010)]]
During an interview, series producer [[Paul Marquess]], he described it as a long running storyline, adding: "It is dark to begin with, the lessons that Ste learns are ultimately positive and life affirming." He also felt it was about not "being afraid of who you are" and Ste was "refreshingly accepting" of his feelings towards a man. Richardson revealed he was shocked to discover the details of the plot. He felt it was interesting to see how Ste coped with the being the victim of domestic violence.<ref name="ds ste"/><ref name="loveaffair"/>

{{Quote_box |width=20% |align=left|quote="I think it's nice that the fans have just accepted Ste being gay straight away, because I was worried that it wouldn't be believable because of him being a real straight character in the past and a bit of a scally.

==Storylines==
===Backstory===
Ste was originally portrayed as being a smart loner who kept to himself, with a cool older brother who taught him how to drive cars. It was later shown that his loneliness was just an act to get girls to sleep with him and that he was not really intelligent. In later episodes, his "brother" was never mentioned, possibly insinuating that Ste had lied about him. Ste was shown to have come from a broken home: raised by his alcoholic mother [[Pauline Hay]] (Julie Hogarth) and his abusive stepfather [[Terry Hay]] (Conor Ryan), with no contact with his biological father. Ste was regularly beaten by Terry, who was defended by Pauline. This led to Ste's violent nature and resentment of his mother.

===2006<U+2014>===
Ste first appears as a friend of [[Wayne Tunnicliffe (Hollyoaks)|Wayne Tunnicliffe]] ([[Joe Marsden]]). Ste eventually begins a relationship with Amy and pressures her to have sex with him. Ste begins a feud with Josh and his cousin Fletch after they both defend Amy, who does not want to have sex. Ste and Wayne push Josh and Fletch into rebelling, which they go along with in order to impress them. Amy becomes pregnant by a stranger, but does not tell Ste. Afterward, Ste confides in Amy about the abuse he had to deal with from his stepfather. Ste takes Fletch, Amy, Josh and [[Michaela McQueen]] ([[Hollie-Jay Bowes]]) joyriding and causes a car accident, after which he flees. Following a confession to the police from Fletch, Ste is sent to a young offender's institute.

[[File:Hollyoaks screenshot of Ste cutting Amys hair.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Ste cuts off Amy's hair as part of their domestic abuse storyline (2008)]]
Months later, Ste returns and seeks Amy's help. After convincing her he has changed, Amy gives Ste a second chance. Amy's father Mike attacks Ste, but is told by Amy that Ste is her daughter Leah's father. Ste and Amy become a couple again and move into a flat of their own. Mike contacts Ste's stepfather Terry, who arrives and beats up Ste. Amy then throws Mike out. To help with their money worries, Ste steals [[Warren Fox]]'s ([[Jamie Lomas]]) credit card. With this, he buys expensive belongings for the flat. When Warren finds out, he takes the belongings and threatens Ste, who later breaks into Warren's business, Evissa and sets a fire, which almost kills Warren's fianc<U+00E9>e [[Louise Summers]] ([[Roxanne McKee]]). After this, Warren beats up Ste. Ste then turns to dealing drugs for money with his friend [[Nige Foster]] (Sam Townend) and influences Fletch to begin smoking [[marijuana]]. Amy lets Ste's mother Pauline see Leah, causing an angry Ste to end up hitting Amy. However, they reconcile. After Ste fails to find a job, Ste steals [[Carmel McQueen]]'s ([[Gemma Merna]]) handbag, but is stopped. To defend himself, Ste lies that Leah has been diagnosed with [[leukaemia]]. Amy is angry, but also lies after they receive money. Ste and Amy's relationship turns violent, with his lashing out on several occasions. The lie about Leah's health is revealed and Amy has no other option but to stay with Ste. Amy discovers she is pregnant, so Ste agrees that he will change. Despite his promise, Ste steals a karaoke machine, which causes Amy to walk out and tell Mike of her abuse, after which he beats Ste up. A drunken Ste climbs onto scaffolding and threatens to commit suicide. [[Kieron Hobbs]] ([[Jake Hendriks]]) tries to talk him down as Amy, [[Sarah Barnes]] ([[Loui Batley]]) and Mike leave, believing Ste is attention-seeking. As they turn away, Ste falls and breaks his leg. After this, Ste and [[Justin Burton]] ([[Chris Fountain]]) become friends and move in together. For the sake of his unborn child, Ste gets a job in Il Gnosh restaurant and begins taking anger management classes.

Ste becomes friends with Natty, Daniel and Abi and begins a short-lived relationship with [[Theresa McQueen]] ([[Jorgie Porter]]), which he ends to focus on getting Amy back. Amy gives birth to her and Ste's son [[Lucas Hay]], helped by Ste, Daniel and Abi. Amy, however, suffers from [[post-natal depression]], and leaves to live with her grandmother, leaving Lucas and Leah with Mike, who later leaves them in Ste's care. Abi and Daniel begin to help Ste with looking after Lucas, with plans of taking Lucas to replace their own son who died. Abi starts drugging Ste as Daniel turns him against Natty, who grows suspicious of Daniel and Abi's interests. Mike finds Ste asleep whilst looking after Lucas, so takes him. However, Ste takes Lucas back and bans Mike from seeing him. Ste almost shakes Lucas, so Daniel convinces him to give his son up. The truth is revealed, Daniel is arrested and later released, he and Abi leave the village. Amy returns and slowly begins to bond with her children again. They move into their old flat together.

When Tony fires him, Ste starts working at Chez Chez nightclub as a barman. Ste grows suspicious of Brendan Brady after he uses Carmel to smuggle drugs. Ste's former co-worker and love interest [[Rae Wilson]] ([[Alice Barlow]]) returns following a stay with her ill grandmother. Brendan is jealous of their relationship, so gets [[Veronica (Hollyoaks)|Veronica]] (Lynsey McLaren) to kiss Ste, which Rae witnesses. They later make up after Ste convinces Rae that the kiss meant nothing. Following a drunken night, Ste kisses Brendan, who then throws him out. The next day, Brendan corners Ste and kisses him again. In the club a further day later, Ste follows Brendan to a cellar and moves to kiss him. However, Brendan punches Ste, who falls to the ground. Brendan then makes Ste tell [[Cheryl Brady]] ([[Bronagh Waugh]]) he was mugged. Ste avoids Brendan, still shaken by his actions. They resume their relationship and Ste tells Amy of his relationship. This prompts Brendan to attack Ste again. Amy realises that Ste is being abused. To hide their relationship, Brendan tells Ste to go out on a date with Rae. When Rae and Ste finally sleep together, Amy is hospitalised after being involved in a fire. Ste suspects Brendan started the fire. However, he denies it. Ste discovers Brendan's former lover [[Macca (Hollyoaks)|Macca]] (Drew Dillon) is in hospital after being beaten up by Brendan. Macca and Ste end up kissing. Ste later confides in [[Dominic Reilly]] ([[John Pickard (British actor)|John Pickard]]) about Brendan and the fire, however Dom is later charged.

Ste starts a relationship with Rae. Ste is angered when he sees Brendan has assaulted [[Trev Costello]] ([[Scott Neal]]), who he thinks is gay, leading him to believe that Brendan's denial of his sexuality is leading him to gay-bash, ending their relationship. Ste later decides to give Brendan a second chance. Brendan reluctantly agrees to a date with Ste and the pair go to a gay bar, but Brendan bails. Rae reveals to Ste that she is pregnant. Amy convinces Brendan to end his affair with Ste. Whilst sharing a goodbye kiss, Brendan and Ste are caught by [[Mitzeee Minniver]] ([[Rachel Shenton]]). Ste becomes jealous when Brendan and Mitzeee agree to pretend to be a couple. Rae catches them kissing, she suffers a miscarriage. Ste ends his affair with Brendan when he attacks him again.

After Richardson came out on ''This Morning'', Dennis Ayers, writing for gay men's news website [[AfterElton.com]], criticised the revelation, believing it to be for promotional purposes only.<ref name="after elton"/> Whilst acknowledging Ste as being a "violent bully, a domestic abuser, and a single father", Ayers could see nothing in Ste's "dark past hinted that he might be gay."<ref name="after elton">{{cite web |url=http://www.afterelton.com/tv/2010/09/hollyoaks-actor-comes-out |title="Hollyoaks" Actor Comes Out.

Langford, also writing for AfterElton, who avidly followed the plot, felt shocked when he witnessed Brendan attacking Ste. He moped there was worse to come and found it compelling viewing. He also did not perceive it as a romantic story stating: "Ste and Brendan's scenes do have an element of sexual allure since the actors have chemistry, but there's too much darkness and manipulation on the edges of every scene to make real romance even possible".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afterelton.com/tv/gayslives/10-17-2010-hollyoaks-preview?page=0%2C1 |title=Hollyoaks<U+201D> Preview: You Sometimes Hurt The One You Love |work=[[AfterElton]] |publisher=[[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]]|first=Anthony D. |last=Langford |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-21<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vRcBMKwV|archivedate=02 January 2011 -->}}</ref> He also gave credit to the show for its slow build up over a few months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afterelton.com/tv/gayslives/10-20-2010-hollyoaks-update |title="Hollyoaks" Video Update: Coming Out On Top |work=[[AfterElton]] |publisher=[[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]]|first=Anthony D. |last=Langford |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-21<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vRc7yWRq|archivedate=02 January 2011 -->}}</ref>
