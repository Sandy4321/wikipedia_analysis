'''Harlech Castle''', located in [[Harlech, Wales|Harlech]], [[Gwynedd]], [[Wales]], is a [[concentric castle]], constructed atop a cliff close to the [[Irish Sea]]. Architecturally, it is particularly notable for its massive [[gatehouse]].

Built by [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] during his [[Edward I of England#Welsh wars|conquest of Wales]], the [[castle]] was subject to several assaults and [[siege]]s during its period of active use as a [[fortification]]. The castle served as the defacto capital of an independent Wales between [[1404]] and [[1409]] when it was held by [[Owain Glyndwr]]. The later seven-year siege of the castle, during the [[Wars of the Roses]]<ref>''The Oxford Companion to British History'' - Oxford University Press (1997) page 454; ''Dictionary of Ancient & Medieval Warfare'' by Matthew Bennett (2001)</ref>, has been memorialised in the famous song "[[Men of Harlech]]".

[[Image:SDJ Harlech Castle Gatehouse.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The main gatehouse at Harlech Castle.]]
The castle is built to a concentric plan, with one line of defences enclosed by another. The outer walls are much shorter and thinner than the mighty inner walls, and have no towers defending them besides the small gatehouse. The inner ward is roughly square, with a large round tower at each corner. The domestic buildings, including the great hall, are built against the inside of the inner walls. Since the surrounding cliffs made it practically impossible to attack the castle except from the east, this side is faced by the imposing gatehouse. The gateway is flanked by two massive "D-shaped" towers, and defended by a series of doors, [[portcullis]]es and [[murder-holes]]. Notably, there are large windows on the inner face of the gatehouse. The west wall of the [[inner ward]] also has large windows (as it forms one wall of the great hall).

The outer ditches at Harlech were cut into the rock.<ref name=morrisp115/> In the height of construction, in 1286, the workforce was 546 general labourers, 115 quarriers, 30 blacksmiths, 22 carpenters and 227 stonemasons.<ref name=morrisp117>{{Cite book

Harlech is also notable for an unusual feature: the "way from the sea". Edward's forces were often in danger from land-based attack, but he enjoyed total supremacy on water. Many of his castles included [[sally port]]s which allowed resupply from the sea, but Harlech's is far more elaborate. Here, a fortified stairway hugs the rock and runs almost {{convert|200|ft|m}} down to the foot of the cliffs, where (at the time of construction) the sea reached. Today, the sea has retreated several miles, making it more difficult to envisage the concept in its original setting. James of St. George's plan was a triumph; when the castle was besieged during [[Madoc ap Llywelyn]]'s campaign, this stairway was used to supply the castle.

Like many of Edward's castles, Harlech was originally designed to be attached to a [[Bastide|fortified borough]].

==History==
[[Image:Harlech Castle with Snowdon.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The castle and [[Snowdon]] (background left)]]
The castle built by Edward I as can be seen today was probably built on the site of an earlier Welsh fortress. The scope of this earlier creation is a matter of archaeological conjecture but Welsh history and legend suggests the site has had continuous military use from perhaps as early as the [[Iron Age Britain|Iron Age]]. The noted [[antiquarian]] A. Morris describes a rich history long before King Edward I;

<blockquote>"Our most famous structure, and perhaps the most famous in the whole of the land, is Harlech Castle, erected in the thirteenth century. Yet 
Harlech, according to the traditions of this county, goes back in its origin to much earlier times. One of its towers, known as Twr [[Bronwen]], is a name that carries us back to the times of [[Bran ap Llyr]]. Some authorities say that the first fortress of a military character erected here was built by [[Maelgwn Gwynedd]] some time in the sixth century. In the eleventh century it seems to have been known as ''Caer Collwyn''. [[Fifteen Tribes of Wales|Collwyn ap Tango]] was lord of [[Eifionydd]], [[Lleyn]], and [[Ardudwy]], and lived in the time of [[Anarawd ap Rhodri|Anarawd]], King of Gwynedd, in the ninth century. Collwyn resided in a square tower of the original building, the remains of which may still be seen, for some of its walls form the base of the present structure." ''Merionethshire'', Cambridge University Press, by A. Morris (1913)[http://www.archive.org/stream/merionethshire00morruoft/merionethshire00morruoft_djvu.txt]</blockquote>

In 1294, [[Madoc ap Llywelyn]], cousin to Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, began an uprising against English rule that spread quickly through Wales. Several English-held towns were razed and Harlech (along with [[Criccieth Castle]] and [[Aberystwyth Castle]]) were besieged that winter. As noted above, the "Way to the Sea" helped the defenders survive until the siege was lifted the following spring.

In 1404, the castle fell to [[Owain Glynd<U+0175>r]] after a long siege when starvation reduced the determined and fearful garrison to just twenty-one men.  Harlech became his residence and family home and military headquarters for four years. He held his second parliament in Harlech in August 1405.<ref>R.R. Davies, ''The Revolt of Owain Glyn D<U+0175>r'' (Oxford: University Press, 1995), pp. 115f</ref>  Four years later, after another long siege of eight months, Harlech Castle was retaken in 1409 by Prince Henry (later [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]) and a force of 1000 men under [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|John Talbot]], during which [[Edmund Mortimer]] starved to death and Glynd<U+0175>r's wife, [[Margaret Hanmer]], two of his daughters and four grandchildren were captured, later to be imprisoned and die.

In the Wars of the Roses in the first part of [[Edward IV of England]]'s reign (1461&ndash;1470), Harlech was held by its Welsh constable [[Dafydd ap Ieuan]] as a Lancastrian stronghold. Following the [[Battle of Northampton]], [[Margaret of Anjou]] and the infant [[Henry VII of England]] fled to Scotland via Harlech. Following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the [[Battle of Towton]], Edward controlled the country and Harlech eventually became last major stronghold under their control. Sir [[Richard Tunstall]] arrived as a reinforcement to the Lancastrians in the latter half of the siege in 1465. In 1468 it was the last Lancastrian fortress to surrender; it was able to withstand the seven-year siege through its being provisioned from the sea. It is the longest known siege in the history of the British Isles.<ref>Bert S. Hall, Weapons and Warfare in Renaissance Europe by (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001) - page 212.</ref> This famous siege inspired the song "[[Men of Harlech]]" according to tradition.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to British History'' - Oxford University Press (1997) page 454</ref> The castle was also briefly occupied during the insurrection of 1498.

During the [[English Civil War]] the castle was the last [[cavalier|royalist]] fortress to hold out against the [[roundhead|Parliamentary]] forces.  The surrender, on 16 March 1647, over a year after [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] had himself been captured, marked the end of the [[First English Civil War|first phase]] of the war. The parliamentarians [[slighting|slighted]] the castle after its fall.

==Present day==
Harlech is part of the "Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Harlech, Beaumaris, Caernarfon and Conwy (Gwynedd)" [[World Heritage site]], reflecting its importance and remarkable state of preservation.<ref>{{Cite web
