'''''Velos''''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+03A4>/<U+0392> <U+0392><U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2>, "Arrow") was a [[Niki class destroyer|''Niki'' class]] [[destroyer]] that served in the [[Hellenic Navy|Royal Hellenic Navy]] (1907 - 1926).

The ship, along with her three sister ships, was ordered from [[Germany]] in [[1905]] and was built in the [[Stettiner Vulcan AG|Vulcan]] shipyard at [[Stettin]].

During [[World War I]], Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]] and, due to Greece's neutrality the four ''Niki'' class ships were seized by the Allies in October, 1916, taken over by the French in November and served in the [[French Navy]] from 1917-18. By 1918, they were back on escort duty under Greek colors, mainly in the [[Aegean Sea]]. 

'' Velos'' saw action in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]].  In 1918, after the [[Armistice of Mudros|Armistice of Moudros]], ''Velos'' entered the [[Dardanelles]] with the allied fleet and was the first Greek warship to enter [[Constantinople]] under the command of Lt. Commander Petros Voulgaris.  In 1919, she conducted escort missions in the [[Black Sea]] carrying Greek refugees from [[Pontus]]. 

After the war, ''Velos'' was stricken in 1926, while her sister ships of [[Niki Class Destroyers]] was refurbished.
