==History==
===1978<U+2013>1982===
[[Paul Ferguson|"Big" Paul Ferguson]] was drummer in the Matt Stagger Band when he met [[Jaz Coleman|Jeremy "Jaz" Coleman]]  (from [[Cheltenham, Gloucestershire]]) in [[Notting Hill, London, England|Notting Hill, London]]. In October 1978 (or early 1979), after Coleman was briefly keyboard player in that band, he and Ferguson left to form Killing Joke. They placed an advertisement in the music press which attracted guitarist [[Geordie Walker|Kevin "Geordie" Walker]] and bassist [[Martin Glover|Martin "Youth" Glover]]. According to Coleman, their [[manifesto]] was to "define the exquisite beauty of the [[atomic age]] in terms of style, sound and form".<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" />

By September 1979, shortly before the release of their debut EP, ''[[Turn to Red]]'', they began the Malicious Damage [[record label]] with graphic artist Mike Coles as a way to press and sell their music;<ref>{{cite web
 | url        = http://www.maliciousdamage.biz/

}}</ref> [[Island Records]] distributed the records, until Malicious Damage switched to [[E.G. Records]] in 1980. The songs on Killing Joke's early singles were primitive punk rock sometimes mixed with electronic ("Nervous System" and "Turn to Red"). ''Turn to Red'' came to the attention of legendary DJ [[John Peel]], who was keen to champion the band's urgent new sound and gave them extensive airplay. They quickly progressed this sound into something denser, more aggressive, and more akin to [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]], as heard on their first two albums, ''[[Killing Joke (album)|Killing Joke]]'' (1980) and the more abrasive ''[[What's THIS For...!]]'' (1981). They toured extensively throughout the UK during this time, and both fans of [[post punk]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] took interest in Killing Joke through singles such as "Follow the Leaders" (1981).<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" />

Killing Joke became notorious largely due to the controversies that arose from their imagery. Typically the images that appeared on their records and on-stage while performing live were bizarre and potentially shocking and inflammatory. One promotion poster featured a photo of a priest walking among rows of soldiers offering Fascist salutes, which was later used for the cover of the band's compilation album, ''[[Laugh? I Nearly Bought One!]]''.  Shortly afterwards, the band was banned from performing a concert in [[Glasgow, Scotland]]. At the same time, some journalists were suspicious about Killing Joke's image and wrote that "Killing Joke's music includes certain fascist tendencies...". This was a common misconception because, if anything, Killing Joke were politically apolitical or "meta-political" - with much of their disturbing imagery acting as ironic or cynical symbols for a world which they perceived was becoming ever more materialist, unjust and conservative. Killing Joke had various 'run-ins' with a number of music journalists at the time.

Killing Joke's third album, ''[[Revelations (Killing Joke)|Revelations]]'', produced by [[Conny Plank]], was released in 1982, and supported by a pair of performances on [[BBC Radio]]'s ''The John Peel Show'' and by the singles "[[Chop-Chop]]", "[[Empire Song]]", and an unofficial release of "[[We Have Joy]]".  The LP reached #12 in the UK Top albums.<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" />

By 1982, members of Killing Joke, especially Coleman, had become immersed in the [[occult]], particularly the works of occultist [[Aleister Crowley]]. In February of that year, Coleman, with Geordie and Youth following shortly after, moved to [[Iceland]] to survive the [[Apocalypse]], which Coleman predicted was coming soon. While in Iceland, Coleman and Geordie worked with musicians from the band [[<U+00DE>eyr]] in the project [[Niceland]].  After a few months, Youth decided there was no indication of the Apocalypse, and decided to move back to England. Youth then began the band [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]] with Paul Ferguson, but the latter defected and travelled to Iceland to rejoin Killing Joke with new bassist [[Paul Raven]] (previously of [[Neon Hearts]] and the rock / glam band Kitsch) in tow.  After spending some time in Iceland, Killing Joke returned to England and began touring and recording again.

The new lineup soon produced, again with Conny Plank, the single "Birds of a Feather / Sun Goes Down / Flock the B-Side" and ''[[Ha! (Killing Joke album)|Ha!]]'', a six-track 10" [[Extended play|EP]] of a live performance recorded in Toronto in August.

===1983<U+2013>1988===
Killing Joke's fourth album, ''[[Fire Dances]]'' (1983), contained music that, like that heard on the "Birds of a Feather" single, was artier and relatively calmer than before, which began a new direction.  This was continued with the non LP singles "Me or You" (1983, b/w "Wilful Days") and "A New Day" (1984, b/w a dance remix or dub mix of the same), the latter promoted with a [[music video]].<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" />

Mixing their sound with a slightly [[pop music|pop]] style, and with Coleman singing and not growling, Killing Joke had developed a variation of new wave on their fifth album, ''[[Night Time]]'' (1985).  They achieved mainstream success with the single "Love Like Blood" which covered all ground from [[goth]]<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/fun-games-killing-joke-in-the-mid-80s ''Fun & Games: Killing Joke in the mid-<U+2018>80s''] by Adrien Begrand, [[PopMatters.com]]. <U+00AB> Punk, goth, new wave, dance, pop, <U+201C>Love Like Blood<U+201D> covers all that ground with astonishing grace.  <U+00BB> </ref> to dance : it peaked at #16 in the UK and #8 in the Netherlands. ''Night Time'' also included the singles "Eighties" (1984) and "Kings and Queens" (1985), which both reached the UK Top 75. The album itself reached #11 in the UK.<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" />

The music on Killing Joke's sixth album, ''[[Brighter than a Thousand Suns (album)|Brighter than a Thousand Suns]]'' (1986), was mostly similar in sound and mood to "Love like Blood".  While no less aggressive and heavy than their older work, ''Brighter Than a Thousand Suns'' diverged musically in ways that lead to controversy among listeners.  In this case, disagreements between fans and critics alike included opinions on whether the band was conforming with pressures from EG Records to develop a more commercial sound, to whether the songs were relevant for those listeners more comfortable with their proto post-punk beginnings.  Those who are strongly approving of the work consider it a milestone - and quite intense - progressive rock album, and their most consistent work to date.  Two singles were released from the album - "Adorations" and "Sanity" - and the band continued touring successfully until the end of the year.<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" />

In 1987, Coleman began plans for a solo record of unusual music, and he made demos of his songs, on which he performed with [[Geordie Walker|Geordie]]'s assistance.  The project ran way over budget and so, despite Coleman's objections, the record company decided that the music would be released under the name "Killing Joke" in order to best recoup the costs.  Attempts were made to include Killing Joke rhythm section members Raven and Ferguson, but it didn't work out, and tensions ultimately led to both being fired from the band.  Session player [[Jimmy Copley]] was then brought in to provide the drumming on the songs, along with percussion player [[Jeff Scantlebury]].

The resulting album, ''[[Outside the Gate]]'' (1988), is Killing Joke's most controversial album, with opinion ranging from admiration to total disgust, owing to its synth-led sonics (experimentally, and disagreement over the quality of the material.  It is not signature-sound Killing Joke, being built around Coleman's orchestral keyboards instead of Geordie's distinctive guitar riffs.  Had the album been released as "Coleman/Walker" (as the cover graphic implies) it might have been better received.  Released as "Killing Joke" however, it was panned by confused critics and fans alike.  Two singles, "America" and "My Love of This Land", were released from the album but did little to improve its fortunes. The video for the former features Coleman and Geordie with drummer [[Jimmy Copley]] and session bassist [[Jerome Rimson]], who never actually recorded with the band.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> No live dates were played to support the album and the band spent much of 1988 in a legal battle as they tried to split from their management and record company, [[E.G. Records|E.G.]]  This struggle resulted in Coleman suffering a nervous breakdown.

On 19 September 1987 Coleman had delivered a lecture at London's [[Courtauld Institute]] outlining the thinking behind the then-unreleased ''[[Outside the Gate]]'' album, touching on [[numerology]] and the occult.  Geordie and percussionist Jeff Scantlebury provided a minimal musical backing at the event. A recording of the lecture was eventually released under the title ''[[The Courtauld Talks]]'' on Martin Atkins' [[Invisible Records]] in 1989.

===1989<U+2013>1991===
Towards the end of 1988, Coleman and Geordie decided to get Killing Joke up and running again as a live band, and they began looking for full-time bass players and drummers. First on board was drummer [[Martin Atkins]], who had gained notability in [[Public Image Ltd.]] and later [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Pigface]]. A suitable bass player proved more difficult, however.  Former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] man [[Andy Rourke]] was hired, then dismissed after only three days.  Eventually the band settled on Welsh bass player Dave "Taif" Ball, and played their first gigs in almost two years in December 1988.<ref>{{cite web

 | publisher  = taif.co.uk 
}}</ref>  These were seen as a return to form, and featured the best of their 1980 to 1985 work, alongside powerful new material which alluded to the band's earlier, harsher sound. Nothing from ''Brighter Than a Thousand Suns'' or ''[[Outside the Gate]]'' was played (and indeed, never has been since).  Touring continued across the UK, Europe and the US until August 1989, when the band took a break to record its new material in Germany, and to allow [[Jaz Coleman]] time to record ''[[Songs from the Victorious City]]'' with [[Anne Dudley]] of [[Art of Noise]].

However, for reasons which remain unclear, the German Killing Joke sessions were shelved and bass player Taif left the band to be replaced by old hand [[Paul Raven]].  The revised line-up began recording again, this time in London, and the result was Killing Joke's eighth album, the ferocious ''[[Extremities, Dirt & Various Repressed Emotions]]'', released on the German [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise International]] label in 1990.  It included some of the heaviest, noisiest and harshest music ever to appear on a Killing Joke record, although the progressive musical spirit of the previous two albums remained as well.  The many highlights included "Solitude", "Slipstream", "Age of Greed," and the single "Money Is Not Our God". Once again, the band toured Europe and North America, but by the middle of 1991 this promising new line-up had imploded.  Coleman emigrated to New Zealand to live on a remote Pacific island, and it looked as though Killing Joke was over for good.

[[Geordie Walker]], [[Martin Atkins]], [[Paul Ferguson]], [[Paul Raven]] and the band's live keyboard player [[John Bechdel]] ([[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Fear Factory]], [[Prong (band)|Prong]], [[Pigface]], [[Abstinence(band)|Abstinence]], [[False Icons]], [[Ascension of the Watchers]]) added Scottish vocalist [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]] ([[Finitribe]], [[Revolting Cocks]]) and continued as the short-lived [[Murder, Inc. (band)|Murder, Inc.]], releasing a self-titled album in 1992.

===1992<U+2013>1996===
[[File:Killing Joke-1994-Nottingham.jpg|thumb|Youth and Jaz (1994)]]
A Killing Joke anthology, ''[[Laugh? I Nearly Bought One!]]'', was released in 1992, and during its production, Geordie was re-acquainted with [[Martin Glover|Youth]], who suggested that they reform the band with himself back on bass.  That same year, two singles (on cassette and CD) appeared featuring the early songs "Change" and "Wardance" in several new versions remixed by Youth, by then a very successful producer.

Coleman had produced the 1993 debut album ''[[Churn (album)|Churn]]'' by the New Zealand Band [[Shihad]] and Shihad drummer [[Tom Larkin]] played drums on some of the songs on ''Pandemonium''. However, relations later soured between Coleman and Shihad due to a dispute over Coleman's production fee for ''[[Churn (album)|Churn]]'', and the fact that Shihad considered him a  "megalomaniac".  Shihad's second album, 1995's ''[[Killjoy (album)|Killjoy]]'', includes a song about Coleman and the dispute: 'Silvercup'. Coleman has also made a number of disparaging remarks about [[Shihad]] in the media.  Shihad singer and guitarist [[Jon Toogood]] says his band have since put the dispute behind them.

Killing Joke also sued [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] during this phase, alleging that the riff for the latter's song "[[Come As You Are (Nirvana song)|Come as You Are]]" was copied from the riff for their song "[[Eighties (song)|Eighties]]".<ref name="anikerrang" /><ref name="Borzillo-Vrenna-Nirvana_Pay_Back_Killing_Joke" />  The lawsuit was dropped after the sudden death of Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]].<ref name="bbc">{{cite web

The reactivated Killing Joke released two strong and well-received albums on Youth's [[Butterfly Recordings]] label, ''[[Pandemonium (Killing Joke album)|Pandemonium]]'' and ''[[Democracy (album)|Democracy]]'', which saw the band shift back to the simpler arrangements of their early albums whilst also (on 12&nbsp;inch remixes) employ young talent, the likes of Waxworth Industries in order to provide an alternative inroad to the bands new and evolving sound. ''[[Pandemonium (Killing Joke album)|Pandemonium]]'' (1994) wove a metallesque ritualistic sound with mosh beats and loops and provided Killing Joke with a memorable [[Top of the Pops]] performance for the single 'Millennium', which was a UK Top 40 hit (the album itself made the Top 20). The title track was also released as a single and made the UK Top 30. ''Democracy'' (1996) successfully introduced acoustic guitar into the mix, as well as adopting more of a "live band" sound again. The title track was again released as a single and made the UK Top 40. Much of ''Pandemonium'' and all of ''Democracy'' featured session drummer [[Geoff Dugmore]].  He also played live with the band throughout this era.  [[Nick Holywell-Walker]] joined the band on keyboards and programming for 11 years from 1994-2005, notably on ''[[Democracy (album)|Democracy]]'' and ''[[XXV Gathering (live) (album)|XXV Gathering (live)]]''.  Youth bowed out of live performance early in the ''Democracy'' tour and was replaced by [[Troy Gregory]], ex [[Prong (band)|Prong]].<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" />

After the ''Democracy'' tour, the band went on an extended hiatus. Jaz Coleman and Youth produced a string of well-received orchestral rock albums based on the music of legends such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[The Doors]].  Coleman became Composer-in-Residence for New Zealand and Czech symphony orchestras.<ref name="decibelmagazine.com-Killing_Joke">{{cite web

===2002<U+2013>2007===
Coleman, Geordie and Youth reformed Killing Joke in 2002, and recorded their [[Killing Joke 2003 (album)|second self-titled album]] with producer [[Andy Gill (musician)|Andy Gill]], released to much acclaim in 2003 on the Zuma/Sony label - a powerful addition to ''Extremities'' and other visceral 1990s albums, and considered one of their finest recordings. The [[War on Terror]] and the [[invasion of Iraq]] were cited as major factors in their reforming, and this is reflected in the lyrical content of much of the album, based on themes of war, government control and [[Armageddon]].  The album, which almost reached the UK Top 40, was their heaviest to date and spawned two singles, "Loose Cannon" (a UK Top 25 hit) and "Seeing Red". The songs are all credited to Coleman/Walker/[[Martin Glover|Glover]]/Gill, although [[Paul Raven|Raven]]'s name is also on the list of musicians on the liner notes, marking his return to the band after more than a decade. It remains unclear who actually played bass on which tracks on the album, and in some interviews with Geordie, he hints that it may have been he who actually played bass on most of the songs, with occasional contributions from Youth. Raven played on the subsequent tour however, with Youth appearing to have retired from the band by this point.  [[Dave Grohl]] ([[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Foo Fighters (band)|Foo Fighters]], [[Probot (band)|Probot]]), a longtime fan of the band, occupied the drum stool for all tracks. The original plan had been to use many different drummers on the album, including Grohl, but he was so enthusiastic about the material that he persuaded the band to let him do the whole thing. The album was accompanied by a tour of the United States, Europe and Australia in 2003/2004, with ex-[[Prong (band)|Prong]] drummer [[Ted Parsons]] on board.

In February 2005, now with young Twin Zero and [[Sack Trick]] drummer [[Ben Calvert]], Killing Joke played two consecutive shows at London's [[Shepherds Bush Empire]] to commemorate their 25th anniversary. DVD and CD recordings from these concerts were released in on [[Cooking Vinyl]] in the fall of 2005 as ''[[XXV Gathering: The Band That Preys Together Stays Together]]''.

In June 2005, remastered and expanded editions of their two 1990s [[Butterfly Recordings]] albums, ''Pandemonium'' and ''Democracy'', were released by [[Cooking Vinyl]].  These were followed in July by their first four albums (''Killing Joke'' to ''Ha!'') on [[EMI]], who by then owned the [[E.G. Records]] catalogue.  (The second batch of EMI remasters would not appear until January 2008.)

In mid-2005, Frontman from Industrial band, INERTIA, Reza Udhin, joins the band on Keyboards and they supported the British leg of [[M<U+00F6>tley Cr<U+00FC>e]]'s world tour and then began work on their next album in [[Prague]]. It was at this time the contribution to the world of rock was recognised when they were awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2005 Kerrang Awards.

Opting for simplicity and raw energy, the band recorded the new album in the basement rehearsal space of Faust Studios, going for live takes with the minimum of overdubs.  The result was ''[[Hosannas from the Basements of Hell]]'', released in April 2006 on Cooking Vinyl, which made the UK Top 75. 

Killing Joke began a European tour in support of the album in April 2006. However, bass player [[Paul Raven]] abruptly departed after a few dates to tour with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and was temporarily replaced by [[Kneill Brown]].  The tour included an appearance headlining the [[MySpace]] stage of the Download Festival on 10 June 2006, which received four K's from ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine.  Other highlights of the summer included a memorable set in Japan at the Fuji Rock festival where there were joined on stage by [[The Orb|Orb]] frontman [[Alex Paterson]] (once a Killing Joke drum roadie) and headlining the Beautiful Days festival in the UK.  The band's momentum suffered another blow however, when health problems caused the autumn leg of the tour to be cancelled.

In October 2006, it was announced that Coleman had been chosen as [[artist in residence|Composer in Residence]] for the [[European Union]].  As Composer in Residence he will be commissioned to write music for special occasions.<ref name="decibelmagazine.com-Killing_Joke" /><ref name="Telegraph20071022-Paul_Raven" /> 

Early in 2007, Killing Joke released three archival collections via [[Candlelight Records]].  The first, ''Inside Extremities'', is a double CD of material taken from the band's preparations for the ''Extremities'' album: rehearsals, rare mixes, a previously unheard track, "The Fanatic," and a full live show from the ''Extremities'' tour.<ref>{{cite web

After the death of Raven, the original line up of Jaz, Youth, Geordie and Paul Ferguson announced they were to reunite. Coleman told Terrorizer magazine that: 

<blockquote>"Everything came together when we all met at...Raven's funeral. It was funny the unifying effect it had on all of us. It made us realise our mortality and how important Killing Joke is to all of us."<ref>Terrorizer May 2008 Issue 170</ref></blockquote>

Although Coleman claimed in the same interview that there would be a lecture tour, their first port of call was a tour where they played two nights per venue. The first nights were dedicated to their first two albums, ''[[Killing Joke (1980 album)|Killing Joke]]'' and ''[[What's THIS For...!]]'', while the second night featured large parts of '[[Pandemonium (Killing Joke album)|Pandemonium]]' plus some early singles released on Island records.
