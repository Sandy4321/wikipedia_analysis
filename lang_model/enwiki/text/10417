'''William Gray Purcell''' (July 2, 1880 &ndash; 1965) was a [[Prairie School]] [[architect]] in the [[Midwest]]ern [[United States]]. He partnered with [[George Grant Elmslie]]. The firm of Purcell and Elmslie produced designs for buildings in twenty two states, Australia, and China. The firm had offices in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and [[Portland, Oregon]].

==Early life and education==
Purcell was born in [[Wilmette, Illinois]] on July 2, 1880.<ref name=Ritz>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ritz |first= Richard Ellison |title= Purcell, William Gray |encyclopedia= Architects of Oregon: A Biographical Dictionary of Architects Deceased <U+2013> 19th and 20th Centuries |location= Portland, Oregon |publisher= Lair Hill Publishing |year= 2002 |pages=325<U+2013>326 |isbn=0-9726200-2-8}}</ref> His father was Charles A. Purcell, an important grain trader, and his grandfather, [[William Cunningham Gray]], was a writer of national reputation.<ref name=Ritz/> Purcell was raised by his grandparents in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], near the home of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].<ref name=Ritz/> He graduated from [[Cornell University]] with a degree in architecture in 1903.<ref name=Ritz/>

==Career==
After graduation, Purcell worked for a few months for [[Henry Ives Cobb]], and then for [[Louis Sullivan]] until the end of 1903.<ref name=Ritz/> In 1904 he traveled to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] to work for John G. Howard in [[Berkeley, California]] and for [[Charles H. Bebb]] and Leonard L. Mendell in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref name=Ritz/>

The architectural practice most widely known as [[Purcell & Elmslie]] consisted of three partnerships. The first, Purcell & Feick, was formed in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], in 1907 between Purcell and his Cornell classmate, George Feick, Jr. George Elmslie and Purcell had been friends since 1903, when Purcell worked for a short while in the office of Louis Sullivan, and Elmslie was an informal influence in the work of Purcell & Feick. In 1909, Elmslie joined the office in Minneapolis, and the name of the firm changed to Purcell, Feick, & Elmslie in 1910. Feick left the partnership in 1912, and the name of the practice became Purcell & Elmslie until being dissolved in 1921.

Over the course of the partnership, Purcell & Elmslie became one of the most commissioned firms among the Prairie School architects, second only to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. After his partnership with Elmslie ended, Purcell continued with his own practice in [[Portland, Oregon]], before tuberculosis forced him into bedrest in a sanatorium at [[Banning, California]], between 1931 and 1935. Following successful lung surgery, Purcell retired to an estate in the foothills of Southern California, near Pasadena. He continued to develop and support the cause of American architecture for another thirty years, mostly through publishing many essays, consulting with architectural historians, and other writing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Works==
[[File:Purcell-Cutts House.jpg|thumb|right|Purcell's second house, originally named "Lake Place"]]
There are two houses built by William Gray Purcell for his personal residence in Minneapolis. The second was built in 1913 and called "Lake Place" by the Purcell family. Known now as the [[William Gray Purcell House|Purcell-Cutts residence]], the house is maintained by the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]] and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. This residence is considered one of the finest achievements of any progressive firm in residential design.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}

His "Maryhill" in [[Edina, Minnesota]], is interesting because of the documentation of how it was created. It was designed by Purcell in correspondence with the future owners, Paul and Mary Carson, and the 600 pieces of their correspondence are in the University of Minnesota's Architectural Archives.

Not all of Purcell's work fits in the "Prairie School" category. Several of his houses in Portland's West Hills show how he adapted his ideas to fit a more urban setting. A feature shared by one of those houses and Maryhill is a sleeping loft, but the Portland example also features a wooden carving of [[The Wonderful Adventures of Nils|Nils on his goose]] flying out over the living room.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}
In the 1920's Purcell moved to the pacific Northwest where he designed a number of "cotswald" style homes. In the 1930;s he moved to Pasadena. In Pasadena, Purcell first built Moderne work. His only known surviving Moderne building is his own vacation home in Palm Springs. Purcell after WW2 seems to have fully embraced modernism and some five homes designed by him from 1945-1965 survive in Pasadena in various levels of modification. During the last part of this era the renounded California Architect Arthur Dyson was Purcell's apprentice.

==Achievements and publications==
Purcell was elected a [[Fellow of the American Institute of Architects|Fellow]] in the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1963.

Purcell is the author of the 1967 book, ''St. Croix Trail Country: Recollections of Wisconsin,'' a memoir of his youth spent in the Wisconsin lake country.
