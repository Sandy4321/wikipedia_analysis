'''Wilfred Rhodes''' (29 October 1877 <U+2013> 8 July 1973) was an English professional [[cricket]]er who played 58 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] for [[England cricket team|England]] between 1899 and 1930. In Tests, Rhodes took 127 [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wickets]] in and scored 2,325 [[Run (cricket)|runs]], becoming the first Englishman to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in Test matches. He holds the world records both for the most appearances made in [[first-class cricket]] (1,110 matches), and for the most wickets taken (4,204). He completed the [[Double (cricket)|double]] of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in an English cricket season a record 16 times. Rhodes played for [[Yorkshire CCC|Yorkshire]] and England into his fifties, and in his final Test in 1930 was, at 52 years and 165 days, the oldest player who has appeared in a Test match.

Beginning his career for [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] in 1898 as a [[Left-arm orthodox spin|slow left arm bowler]] who was a useful batsman, Rhodes quickly established a reputation as one of the best slow bowlers in the world. However, by the [[First World War]] he had developed  his batting skills to the extent that he was regarded as one of the leading batsmen in England. This improvement was accompanied by a temporary decline in his bowling performances, but the loss of key Yorkshire bowlers in the War resulted in Rhodes resuming his role as a front-line bowler. He played throughout the 1920s as an [[all-rounder]] before retiring after the 1930 cricket season. His first appearance for England was in 1899 and he played regularly in Tests until 1921. Famously recalled to the team in the final [[The Ashes|Ashes]] Test of 1926 aged 48, Rhodes played a significant part in winning the match for England who thus regained the Ashes for the first time since 1912.

As a bowler, Rhodes was noted for his great accuracy, variations in flight and, in his early days, sharp spin. Throughout his career he was particularly effective on [[Sticky wicket|wet, rain affected pitches]] where he could bowl sides out for very low scores. His batting was regarded as solid and dependable but unspectacular, and critics accused him of excessive caution at times. However, they also considered him to be an  astute cricket thinker. Following his retirement from playing cricket, he coached at Harrow School but was not a great success. His eyesight began to fail from around 1939 to the point where he was completely blind by 1952. He was given honorary membership of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (M.C.C.) in 1949 and remained a respected figure within the game until his death in 1973.

==Early life and career==
===Beginnings===
Rhodes was born in the village of [[Kirkheaton]], just outside [[Huddersfield]], in 1877. His family moved to a farm two miles away while he was very young.<ref>{{cite book|last = Rogerson|first = Sidney|title = Wilfred Rhodes|publisher = Hollis and Carter|year = 1960|location= London|page= 31}}</ref>
He went to school in nearby Hopton, and later to Spring Grove School in Huddersfield. His father, Alfred Rhodes, was captain of the Kirkheaton cricket team's Second XI and encouraged his son to play cricket, buying him equipment and having a pitch laid near their home for Wilfred to practice on.<ref>{{cite book|last = Thompson|first = A.A.|title = Hirst and Rhodes|publisher = The Sportsmans Book Club|year = 1960|location= London|page= 100}}</ref><ref>Rogerson, p. 31.</ref>
By the time Rhodes left school, aged 16, he had joined Kirkheaton Cricket Club and had begun to take a serious interest in the game, watching Yorkshire playing locally and having ambitions for a career as a professional cricketer. After briefly considering becoming a teacher, in around 1893 he began work in the railway engine sheds in [[Mirfield]], before progressing to a job in the railway storage department in 1894.<ref>Rogerson, p. 32.</ref> By now, Rhodes was playing regularly for Kirkheaton Second XI; his keenness to reach one game on time led him to ring the off-duty bell before the end of the shift. As a result he lost his job on the railways and began work on a local farm, which gave him more time for cricket. By 1895 he was playing for the Kirkheaton first team, and was recommended to [[Gala Cricket Club]], of [[Galashiels]], Scotland, as a professional.<ref>Rogerson, p. 34.</ref>

===Professional club cricketer===
Rhodes played for Gala Cricket Club in 1896 and 1897, as an all-rounder who opened the batting and bowled medium paced [[Seam bowling|seamers]].<ref>Thompson, p. 102.</ref> He took 92 wickets in his first season, and discovered that bowling an occasional slow ball brought him some success. He decided to change his bowling style to spin, and spent the winter of 1896<U+2013>97 practising on the family farm while also working again on the railway, this time as a [[Signalman (rail)|signalman]].<ref>Rogerson, pp. 34<U+2013>5.</ref> Over several months, Rhodes used his practice sessions at the family farm to develop control of spin and different types of delivery. Consequently, in his second season at Galashiels, now bowling slow left arm, he took fewer wickets but at a better average. At the end of the 1897 season, encouraged by a Scottish member of the M.C.C., he resigned from Gala to look for work in England.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 36<U+2013>37.</ref>

==First-class cricketer==
===Beginning as a bowler===
[[File:Lord Hawke - Vanity Fair-alt-edit-2-cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Lord Hawke, Yorkshire's captain when Rhodes made his debut. He remained captain of Yorkshire until 1911. |alt=A painting of a man sitting on a chair holding a cricket bat. He has a moustache and is wearing a yellow, orange and black striped cap and blazer, cream shirt and trousers and cricket pads.]]
In response to an advertisement, Rhodes applied to join the groundstaff of [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club]], but the club were unable to offer him an engagement for financial reasons.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 38<U+2013>39.</ref> At this time, Yorkshire were looking for a slow left arm spinner to replace [[Bobby Peel]], who had been sacked following a disciplinary lapse on the field in front of his captain [[Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke|Lord Hawke]] in August 1897. Rhodes successfully applied for a place in a Yorkshire Colts team to play against the County XI.<ref>{{Cite web  | url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/195/195141.html  |title = Yorkshire v Yorkshire Colts in 1897  | publisher = CricketArchive  | accessdate = 7 Nov 2009}}</ref> However, Rhodes admitted to having a poor match, while his rival for Peel's place in the side, Albert Cordingley, took nine wickets in the match.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 39<U+2013>40.</ref>

In early spring 1898, Rhodes was invited to the nets at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]], which led to him playing in some friendly matches (unofficial matches involving first-class teams). Rhodes went on to make his first-class debut for Yorkshire on 12 May 1898 against the M.C.C., taking six wickets in the match.<ref>Rogerson, p. 40.</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4951.html|title = Marylebone Cricket Club v Yorkshire in 1898| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2009-11-07}}</ref> In his second game, he made his [[County Championship]] debut on 16 May 1898 against Somerset, taking 13 wickets for 45 runs.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4955.html|title = Somerset v Yorkshire in 1898| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2009-11-07}}</ref> In the 1898 season, according to [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|''Wisden'' Cricketers' Almanack]] Rhodes "sprang at once into fame, bowling in match after match for Yorkshire with astounding success."<ref name="cricketerofyear">{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154845.html| title = ''Wisden'' <U+2013> Wilfred Rhodes| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  1899 <U+2013> online archive| publisher = EspnCricinfo| accessdate = 7 Nov 2009}}</ref> By the end of the season he had taken 154 wickets at an average of 14.60,<ref name="bowlingseasonbyseason">{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/241/f_Bowling_by_Season.html|title =First-class Bowling in Each Season by Wilfred Rhodes|publisher= CricketArchive|accessdate=16 Jan 2010}}</ref> and was named as one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|''Wisden'' Cricketers of the Year]] for 1899. ''Wisden'' said, "There can be no doubt as to the greatness of his achievements last summer&nbsp;...

In [[1899 English cricket season|1899]], Rhodes took 179 wickets at an average of 17.10 in a reasonably dry season which meant fewer pitches to suit his bowling. ''Wisden'' described him as "head and shoulders above his colleagues".<ref name="bowlingseasonbyseason"/><ref name=R54>Rogerson, p. 54.</ref> He made his Test debut in [[Australian cricket team in England in 1899|the five-match series against Australia]], playing in three of the five Tests; his first Test coincided with [[W. G. Grace]]'s last. As well as Grace, his team-mates included [[C. B. Fry]], [[K. S. Ranjitsinhji]], and [[George Hirst]]. Rhodes opened the English bowling and took four wickets for 58 in an Australian total of 252; his first Test wicket was [[Monty Noble]] (whose wicket he took again in the second innings). He was described by ''Wisden'' as bowling "steady and well" on the first day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150162.html| title = ''Wisden'' <U+2013> England v Australia 1899 (First Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  1900 <U+2013> online archive| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate = 9 November 2009}}</ref> Rhodes took three wickets in the second Test,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/5/5218.html| title = England v Australia in 1899 (First Test)| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 9 November 2009}}</ref> but the selectors omitted him from the third match a decision ''Wisden'' believed was mistaken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151880.html| title = ''Wisden'' <U+2013> England v Australia 1899 (Third Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  1900 <U+2013> online archive| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate = 9 November 2009}}</ref> He did not play again until the final Test, and he finished with 13 wickets in the series, equal with [[J.

G. Grace and C. B. Fry scored heavily against him.<ref>Thompson, p. 105.</ref>

Rhodes's most successful seasons in terms of wickets were the three seasons from 1900 to 1902. In these years, Rhodes took 725 wickets at an average of 14.07, taking five or more wickets in an innings 68 times and taking ten or more wickets in a match 21 times,<ref name="bowlingseasonbyseason"/> assisting Yorkshire to three consecutive [[County Championship]]s. In [[1900 English cricket season|1900]], Rhodes took 261 wickets as bad weather made pitches helpful to his bowling. In [[1901 English cricket season|1901]], the weather was much better, leading to pitches that were good for batting, but Rhodes still took 251 wickets, an achievement described by ''Wisden'' as astonishing.<ref name="bowlingseasonbyseason"/><ref>Rogerson, p. 62.</ref> Against M.C.C. that year, Rhodes scored his maiden first-class century, batting at number nine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/5/5816.html| title = Yorkshire v Marylebone Cricket Club in 1901| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 10 November 2009}}</ref> In [[1902 English cricket season|the 1902 season]], Rhodes took 213 wickets, fewer than 1901 despite a greater number of favourable pitches in a wet summer. This attracted unfavourable comment from some critics who had expected more.<ref>Thompson, pp. 111&ndash;12.</ref>

The main cricket event of 1902 was the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1902|Australian tour of England]]. Rhodes played in all five Tests, being England's leading wicket-taker with 22 wickets at an average of 15.27.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1902/t_England_Bowling.html| title = Test Bowling for England in Australia in England 1902| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 9 November 2009}}</ref> He took seven for 17 in the first innings of the first Test, out of an Australian total of 36, in conditions that the umpires considered reasonable. Rhodes, along with [[George Herbert Hirst|George Hirst]], was described in ''Wisden'' as bowling very well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150168.html

Fry believed that Hirst was more difficult to play and that while Rhodes bowled well, the Australian batsmen got themselves out as they "hurried to the other end and tried to hit Rhodes, without success".<ref>{{cite book|last = Fry|first = C.B.|title = Life Worth Living. Some Phases of an Englishman|publisher = The Pavilion Library|year = 1986|location= London|page= 231}}</ref> Rain meant the game was drawn and washed out most of the second match. In the third Test, which England lost, Rhodes took five for 63,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/5/5991.html|title = England v Australia 1902 (Third Test)|publisher= CricketArchive|accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref> including a spell of four wickets in nineteen balls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150170.html| title = ''Wisden'' <U+2013> England v Australia 1902 (Third Test)|publisher= ESPNCricinfo| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  1903 <U+2013> online archive| accessdate = 9 November 2009}}</ref> In the fourth Test, Rhodes took seven wickets in the match, taking three quick wickets in the first innings, but receiving some heavy punishment. He was batting at the end of the match, but was unable to prevent Australia from snatching victory to win by three runs and take the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150171.html| title = ''Wisden'' <U+2013> England v Australia 1902 (Fourth Test) |publisher= ESPNCricinfo| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  1903 <U+2013> online archive| accessdate = 9 November 2009}}</ref> The final Test, at [[The Oval]], was dominated by [[Gilbert Jessop]] and Hirst, but with England needing 263 to win in the final innings, the ninth wicket fell with 15 needed when Rhodes came in. It has been claimed that Hirst said to Rhodes, "We'll get 'em in singles",<ref>{{cite book  |last = Cardus  |first = Neville  |title = Autobiography  |publisher = Collins  |year = 1949  |location= London  |page= 147}}</ref> but neither batsman could remember those words being said and not all the runs came in singles.<ref>{{cite web| last = Thompson| first = A.A| url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152357.html| title = ''Wisden'' <U+2013> My favourite summer| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  1967 <U+2013> online archive| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate = 9 November 2009}}</ref> Whatever the story, England won by one wicket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/6/6056.html|title = England v Australia 1902 (Fifth Test)|publisher= CricketArchive|accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>

In [[1903 English cricket season|1903]], Rhodes scored over 1,000 runs in the season for the first time,<ref name="batting"/> completing his first [[double (cricket)|double]] of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets.<ref name="bowlingseasonbyseason"/> However, after bowling a large number of overs against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]], he had little success as a bowler for a spell of three weeks.<ref>Thompson, p. 113.</ref> [[Plum Warner|Pelham Warner]] noted that Rhodes was comparatively unsuccessful early in the summer but came back well to take 193 wickets in the season. Warner also wrote that Rhodes at this time was accused of being easy to play on a wicket which suited the batsmen, although Warner himself did not agree.<ref>{{cite book|last = Warner|first = P.F.|title = How we Recovered the Ashes.

Pelham Warner, who played for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club]], toured prolifically with cricket teams and was chosen to captain the first [[English cricket team in Australia in 1903<U+2013>04|M.C.C.-sponsored tour of Australia]] in the winter of 1903<U+2013>04. Warner was primarily responsible for the selection of players, and he selected Rhodes among his first choices for the team.<ref>Warner, pp. xxvii, 7.</ref> Before the tour, [[K. S.

Rhodes believed that the 1903<U+2013>04 tour was a turning point in his career as a bowler and that he was never the same after. Part of the reason was a change in his bowling style. He had noticed that it was necessary for him to bowl faster in Australia to be effective, and on his return to England he continued with this faster style up until the First World War.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 10, 72.</ref> Rhodes thought that another reason for his bowling decline was  increasing concentration on batting;  his biographer, Sidney Rogerson, cited reasons such as the strain on his fingers and wrist from bowling so much, and his development into a more robust, well-built figure in his mid-twenties. Rogerson also believed that Rhodes was affected by the break-up of the successful Yorkshire team which had peaked between 1900 and 1902. More batting responsibility was placed on his shoulders, and he received less support in the field as the team were less rehearsed, efficient and familiar. Consequently, while Rhodes scored more and more runs and moved further up the [[Batting order (cricket)|batting order]] after 1903, his bowling gradually declined until the war.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 63<U+2013>4, 74.</ref>

===Batting success in Australia===
In September 1911 Rhodes made his third visit to Australia, this time as the opening partner of Jack Hobbs.

==Career after the First World War==
===Leading bowler again===
When cricket resumed after the war in [[1919 English cricket season|1919]], no-one was sure how popular county cricket would be and so the County Championship matches were reduced to two days instead of three. However, this experiment was judged a failure.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151679.html| title = ''Wisden'' <U+2013> Notes by the Editor| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  1920 <U+2013> online archive| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate = 26 November 2009}}</ref> Rhodes believed that the long hours of play and the frequent travelling due to playing up to three games a week, and a lack of a suitable level of wage for these conditions, made the 1919 season chaotic for the players.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 119<U+2013>20.</ref> Yorkshire won the championship with a very different side from that which had played in 1914. Some good new players were emerging, such as batsmen [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] and [[Percy Holmes]], but the bowling attack had been weakened by the deaths of [[Major Booth]] in the war and [[Alonzo Drake]] in January 1919 due to illness. George Hirst was by now too old to be effective as a bowler.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 120<U+2013>1.</ref> In Rhodes' words, this "lack of bowlers ... led me to take seriously to bowling again."<ref name=r121>Rogerson, p. 121.</ref> With an increased amount of bowling, he took more wickets and regained his confidence. Although unable to spin or flight the ball as well as previously, Rhodes bowled a very accurate length and used his great experience effectively.<ref name=r121/>  The  success of Holmes and Sutcliffe as opening batsmen meant that, although Rhodes began the season opening the batting, he was able to move down the order and bat at number four.<ref name=r121/> He scored 1,237 runs,<ref name="batting"/> and by taking 164 wickets at an average of 14.42,<ref name="bowlingseasonbyseason"/> finished top of the national first-class bowling averages.<ref>Thompson, p. 148.</ref> Around this time, Rhodes was approached by [[Haslingden Cricket Club]] from the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]], to play cricket for them as a professional. Rhodes, not happy with the playing conditions for the counties in the 1919 season, seriously considered the offer but in the end declined.<ref>Rogerson, p. 120.</ref><ref>Thompson, p. 147.</ref> In the [[1920 English cricket season|following season]], county matches returned to three days and the wages of professional cricketers were increased. That season Rhodes scored 1,123 runs,<ref name="batting"/> took 161 at an average of 13.18,<ref name="bowlingseasonbyseason"/> and was chosen to go to Australia with the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1920<U+2013>21|1920<U+2013>21 M.C.C. touring team]].

===Australian tour, 1920<U+2013>21===
With England not fully recovered from the effects of the war,<ref>Rogerson, p. 128.</ref> weak in bowling and confronted by an Australian side that was far better than anyone had expected, the result of the Test series was a "disaster", according to ''Wisden'': Australia won all five matches, an unprecedented result.<ref name="Wisden20/21">{{cite web| url= http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155201.html| title = ''Wisden'' <U+2013> M.C.C.

In the Tests, Rhodes scored 238 runs at an average of 23.80, his highest score 73 in the fourth Test.<ref name="testbatting"/><ref>{{cite web| url= http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/10/10015.html| title = Australia v England in 1920/21 (Fourth Test)| publisher = CricketArchive

===Senior professional===
On his return to England for the [[1921 English cricket season|1921 season]], Rhodes faced several career turning points. The first was the visit of the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1921|Australians to England]]. The tourists, as ''Wisden'' reported, overwhelmed England, exposing many weaknesses in the team and reducing the English selectors to "catch[ing] at straws".<ref name=1922w/> 30 players were used in the five-match Test series, which England lost by three matches to none.<ref name=1922w>{{cite web| url= http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154193.html| title = ''Wisden'' <U+2013> Notes by the Editor, 1922| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  1922 <U+2013> online archive| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate = 2 December 2009}}</ref> Rhodes played in the first Test, scoring 19 and 10 and taking two wickets in a heavy defeat. Although his performances were no worse than those of others, he was dropped from the team for the rest of the series and did not play another Test for five years.<ref>Rogerson, p. 133.</ref> At the time, it was suggested his place was lost because the [[fast bowling]] of [[Jack Gregory]] and [[Ted McDonald]],<ref>Thompson, p. 151.</ref> who devastated and demoralised many English batting, troubled him.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154097.html

| accessdate = 2 December 2009}}</ref> 

This led to a second development in Rhodes's career. As a result of his problems with pace bowling Rhodes began to bat using what was called the "two-eyed stance", where instead of standing at right angles to the bowler the batsman's body was turned towards the bowler. Critics complained that this method was ugly; it restricted the shots that could be made, and led to some batsmen using their pads  as an extra form of defence to stop the ball hitting the wicket.<ref>Thompson, p. 153.</ref> According to his ''Wisden'' obituary, Rhodes was one of the first men to adopt this batting stance.<ref name="obituary"/> A further development for Rhodes was that, following the retirements of Hirst and Denton from Yorkshire, he became the county's senior professional. This position, while holding no official powers, was nevertheless significant because senior professionals  often had an important influence on tactics, strategy and morale. Rhodes held this post until his retirement.<ref>Rogerson, p. 125.</ref> 

In the 1921 season as a whole, Rhodes scored 1,474 runs at an average of 39.83, including his highest first-class score of 267 not out against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]].<ref name="batting"/> This was on the day that England, who had just dropped him, began the second Test.<ref>Thompson, pp. 151<U+2013>2.</ref> Rhodes took 141 wickets in the season, at an average of 13.27.<ref name="bowlingseasonbyseason"/> In the autumn Rhodes undertook the first of what became until 1927 an annual trip to India, coaching and playing for the [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Maharaja of Patiala]]'s private team, sometimes accompanied by other players. On five occasions in India he completed a 1,000 runs and 100 wickets double, although most of these games were not first-class.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 135<U+2013>7.</ref>

In the four seasons 1922 to 1925, Yorkshire won the County Championship. Rhodes scored over 1,000 runs each year, averaging over 30 except in 1924; in 1925 his average was 40.91, only the second time it exceeded 40 in an English cricket season.<ref name="batting"/> Rhodes was by now part of a very powerful county bowling attack, and was usually the fourth or fifth bowler used.<ref>Thompson, p. 155<U+2013>6.</ref> He took over 100 wickets in each of the 1922, 1923 and 1924 seasons, but took only 57 in 1925,<ref name="bowlingseasonbyseason"/> a very good year for batting.<ref>Thompson, p. 160</ref> As Yorkshire's senior professional Rhodes was very influential in this period,  encouraging a hostile attack, developing tactics and raising the standard of the fielding.<ref>Rogerson, p. 139.</ref> Stories eventually emerged that he was an "overmighty subject", setting field placings and making bowling changes without reference to his nominal captain.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 22<U+2013>3.</ref> Alan Hill wrote that Yorkshire captains (who were usually poor cricketers) generally deferred to Rhodes as senior professional; [[Arthur Lupton]], captain from 1925 to 1927, "very wisely left the cricket affairs to the joint supervision of Rhodes and [[Emmott Robinson]]."<ref name=h107>Hill, p. 107.</ref> However, all the captains to whom biographer Sidney Rogerson spoke mentioned their good relations with Rhodes, while at the same time agreeing that he could be difficult.<ref>Rogerson, p. 23.</ref>  [[Beverley Lyon]], who captained Gloucestershire 1929<U+2013>34, criticised Rhodes for instilling too serious an attitude to the game into his young professionals, thus promoting a no-risk attitude.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 17<U+2013>8.</ref>

===Recalled for the Oval===
[[Image:The Oval Pavilion.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A three tiered Victorian red-brick building with flags flying on the roof and a clock at the top. There are large numbers of spectators watching a cricket match.|The Pavilion at the Oval, the scene of Rhodes successes in 1902 and 1926. Although this is a modern picture, the pavilion is the same as it was when Rhodes played there.]]Reviewing the 1925 season, ''Wisden'' commented on Rhodes's age and reduced performance. "In the nature of things, Rhodes, approaching the completion of his 48th year, could not be expected to prove very deadly in a dry summer ... If less effective in bowling, he did fine work with the bat..."<ref name=r142>Rogerson, p. 142.</ref> However, in the [[1926 English cricket season|1926 season]], ''Wisden'' reported that while the other Yorkshire bowlers did not perform as well as they had in 1925, Rhodes "despite his 49 years, came out in wonderful form ... Rhodes's triumph delighted everybody ... He not only accomplished skilful work in bowling but made his thousand runs [in county matches] with an average of 40."<ref name=r142/> Rhodes doubled his previous season's wicket total, taking 115 at an average of 14.86.<ref name="bowlingseasonbyseason"/> In all first-class matches he scored 1,132 runs  (average 34.30), the final time he passed 1,000 runs in a season and completed his 16th and final double.<ref name="batting"/> 

In 1926 [[Australian cricket team in England in 1926|the Australians were in England]] for the first time since 1921. The English selectors had decided to add two professional cricketers to their committee, and chose Rhodes and Jack Hobbs.<ref name=r143>Rogerson, p. 143.</ref> With Rhodes in such good form, at the top of the bowling averages, the selectors tried to convince him to play for England on several occasions through the season but he refused, believing that younger men should have their chances.<ref>Rogerson, p. 3.</ref> The first four Tests were all drawn; England had won only one of the last 19 Test matches against Australia.<ref name=r143/>  The final Test of the series, at the Oval, would be played to a finish to provide a clear series winner.<ref name="oval26">{{cite web| url= http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151711.html| title = ''Wisden'' <U+2013> England v Australia 1926 (Fifth Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  1927 <U+2013> online archive| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate = 6 December 2009}}</ref> The selectors dropped the captain, [[Arthur Carr (cricketer)|Arthur Carr]], and replaced him with the inexperienced [[Percy Chapman]].<ref>Rogerson, pp. 2, 144.</ref> They also recalled Rhodes, aged nearly 49, having finally overcome his objections.<ref>Thomspon, pp. 162<U+2013>3.</ref> The selection of Rhodes, in the words of ''Wisden'', "naturally occasioned a good deal of surprise".<ref name="oval26"/> 

England batted first, but made a disappointing total of 280;<ref name="oval26"/> Rhodes, batting at number seven, scored 28.<ref name=Ovalscore>{{cite web| url= http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/12/12064.html| title = England v Australia in 1926 (Fifth Test)| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 6 December 2009}}</ref> In the Australian innings of 302 Rhodes bowled 25 overs and took two wickets for 35, helped by a worn area on the pitch which enabled him to spin the ball.<ref>Hill, p. 93.</ref> He later described feeling nervous when first bowling, but said that he was heartened by the warm welcome he received from the crowd.<ref name=Ovalscore/> After the start of England's second innings an overnight thunderstorm soaked the pitch, leaving it very difficult to bat on next day.

''Wisden's'' verdict was that Rhodes' selection "was crowned with complete success", his bowling  "proving no small factor in determining the issue of the struggle."<ref name="oval26"/>  Rhodes had shown himself still to be England's best bowler: Wisden called his triumph  "immensely popular."<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151706.html| title = ''Wisden'' <U+2013> Notes by the Editor| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  1927 <U+2013> online archive| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate = 6 December 2009}}</ref>

===Late career===
{{seealso|Yorkshire captaincy affair of 1927}}
Rhodes continued to play for Yorkshire until 1930, but averaged under 30 with the bat in each season and only scored one more hundred, in 1928. He failed to reach 1,000 runs in  a season again,<ref name="batting"/> but as a bowler he took 85 wickets in 1927, 115  in 1928 and 100  in 1929.<ref name="bowlingseasonbyseason"/> In 1927 Yorkshire opened a public testimonial for Rhodes, donating <U+00A3>250 themselves; eventually it raised <U+00A3>1,821,<ref name=r149>Rogerson, p. 149.</ref> worth more than <U+00A3>80,000 in 2010.<ref name=Measuringworth/> During the same season, he became the only cricketer to play in 1,000 first-class matches when Yorkshire's match against Nottinghamshire started on July 23.<ref name=o>{{cite web| title=Player Oracle W Rhodes|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=241&opponentmatch=exact&playername=Meckiff&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=&startscore=&team=&startseason= |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref>

Yorkshire were seeking to [[Yorkshire captaincy affair of 1927|appoint a more competent and permanent captain]], rather than continuing the succession of amateurs, and planned to ask Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional, to take the post. Frederick Toone encouraged Rhodes to offer his resignation as senior professional, possibly with a view to installing a new regime, but Rhodes declined.<ref>Rogerson, p. 151.</ref> Meanwhile the proposed appointment of Sutcliffe caused controversy, with some members of the county believing that Rhodes should be appointed. Rhodes maintained that he had not been offered the captaincy, his views had not been sought, and that Sutcliffe had been approached over his head. He felt unappreciated for not having been given first refusal on the captaincy. A poll of Yorkshire members also showed a marked preference for Rhodes over Sutcliffe as captain. Sutcliffe eventually declined the offer, and another amateur was appointed.<ref>Hill, pp. 111<U+2013>3.</ref>

In 1929<U+2013>30, Rhodes was chosen for an MCC tour of West Indies, one of several veterans<U+2014>he described it as an "old crocks" team. He was given a heavy workload with the ball;<ref name=r149/> on the tour he took 39 first-class wickets, averaging 24.28,<ref name="bowlingseasonbyseason"/> and scored 129 runs at an average of 25.80 with a top score 36.<ref name="batting"/> In the four "Representative Games" (later given the status of Test matches) Rhodes took ten wickets at an average of 45.30.<ref name="testbowling"/> On the last day of the final Test Rhodes was 52 years, 165 days, making him the oldest ever Test cricketer.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283722.html| title = Oldest players| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate = 6 December 2009}}</ref>

===Retirement===
During the [[1930 English cricket season|1930 season]], Rhodes announced his intention to retire from cricket at the end of the summer. He was finding it harder to take wickets, and the workload placed on him in the West Indies had  decreased his enthusiasm for the game. By this time, [[Hedley Verity]] and [[Bill Bowes]] had emerged to strengthen the Yorkshire bowling. Through an ex-captain of Yorkshire, [[Harrow School]] offered Rhodes the post of  professional cricket coach, which he accepted.<ref>Rogerson, p. 152</ref> Rhodes missed several matches towards the end of the 1930 season, before ending his career at the [[Scarborough Festival]]. His last match was for [[H. D. G.

==Style and personality==
A right-handed batsman with a good defensive technique, Rhodes was a strong driver of the ball who scored more quickly in the earlier part of his career. Analysts maintained that Rhodes had only two or three effective shots, though his technique was good.<ref name=W183>Woodhouse, p. 183.</ref><ref name=H72>Hodgson, p. 72.</ref> Cricket writer [[E. W. Swanton]] described Rhodes as a "craftsman rather than an artist".<ref>{{cite book|last = Swanton|first = EW|title = Cricketers of My Time|publisher = Andre Deutsch|year = 1999|location= London|page= 14}}</ref> Neville Cardus, in his obituary of Rhodes, said that the Yorkshireman "made himself into a batsman by practice and hard thinking", and that while often "dour and parsimonious", he was capable  of hitting out.<ref name="obituary"/> After changing to the two-eyed stance more of his runs came on the leg-side;<ref name=s14>Swanton, p. 14.</ref> in later years, Rhodes often used his [[pads]] rather than play a shot, a tactic generally regarded as negative.<ref name=H72/> A noted feature of his batting career was his successful opening partnership with Hobbs, particularly their enterprise in running between the wickets. Rhodes claimed that he preferred batting to bowling.<ref name=s14/> <ref>Rogerson, p. 75.</ref>

As a bowler, Rhodes was recognised as one of the greatest slow bowlers of all time, very effective at removing batsmen on difficult pitches and difficult to hit on a good batting surface. He could make the ball turn if the pitch offered even the slightest assistance, particularly if it had been [[Sticky wicket|affected by rain]].<ref name=W183/> Swanton described how Rhodes had "a beautifully controlled, economical and rhythmical action which ensured supreme accuracy of length and direction. He was a master of the stock left-hander's spin and could vary it with the ball that came on with the arm."<ref>Swanton, pp. 14<U+2013>5.</ref>  In his early years as a bowler, Rhodes was able to spin the ball very sharply,<ref>Rogerson, p. 62.</ref> and while this ability decreased in later years, he became expert at working out batsmens' weaknesses.<ref name="Swanton, p15">Swanton, p. 15.</ref> Critics considered him expert at flighting the ball; Neville Cardus wrote that "Flight was his secret. Flight and the curving line, now higher, now lower, tempting, inimical; every ball like every other ball, yet somehow unlike; each over in collusion with the others, part of a plot<U+2026>"<ref>{{Cite web|last = Menon|first = Suresh|url = http://www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/408886.html|title = All Rhodes|publisher = ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate = 13 Dec 2009}}</ref> As time passed, his accuracy increased to the extent that it seemed every ball landed in exactly the same place.<ref name=H72/>

When Rhodes was involved in matches, Cardus believed that "he was not a man given to affability",<ref name="obituary"/> showing annoyance on the field and being critical of the performances of others. According to historian Anthony Woodhouse, He was a "dour, methodical and calculating cricketer,"<ref name=W183/> not popular in the way that a player like Hirst was popular. "He commanded respect rather than plaudits" in the words of [[Bill Bowes]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Bowes|first = Bill|title = Express Deliveries|publisher = Stanley Paul|year = 1949|location= London|pages= 153<U+2013>4}}</ref> An introvert, he did not always get along with the more extrovert Hirst. However, Rhodes became more relaxed and approachable in later life, particularly after his eyesight failed.<ref name=W183/> Cardus was surprised, after meeting him in 1950, at how much more readily Rhodes engaged in conversation, commenting that "history comes from his mouth in rivers".<ref name=H72/>

==Personal life==
In October 1899, Rhodes, aged 22, married Sarah Elizabeth Stancliffe, who lived in Kirkheaton and was two years his senior. They lived in a farmhouse, shared with other people, at Bog Hall near Kirkheaton.<ref>Rogerson, p. 56.</ref> On 25 August 1902 his wife gave birth to a daughter.<ref name="Rogerson, p63">Rogerson, p. 63.</ref> Rhodes found Yorkshire's dealings with money to be ungenerous;<ref>Rogerson, p. 80.</ref> following his benefit in 1911 Yorkshire, as was their custom, paid only one-third of the money to Rhodes and kept back the rest to invest on his behalf, only paying out the interest. Rhodes considered this to be unfair; however, he was able to use the money to build a stone house at [[Marsh, Huddersfield]], which his family moved into in the autumn of 1912. He lived there until 1956.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 101<U+2013>2.</ref>

After his retirement from first-class cricket in 1930, Rhodes coached at Harrow School until 1936. Cricket was very important to the school, and they were following the lead of [[Eton College]] who had appointed George Hirst as their coach. However, Rhodes's Northern personality and generally critical nature did not communicate well with privileged schoolboys who were accustomed to getting their own way, and he was eventually replaced with the more genial and sympathetic Middlesex professional [[Patsy Hendren]].<ref name="Swanton, p15"/><ref>{{cite book|last = Tyreman|first = Christopher|title = A History of Harrow School|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2000|location= Oxford||isbn = 0-19-822796-5|page= 473}}</ref> 

From around 1936, Rhodes's sight began to fail, and on the outbreak of war in 1939 he was unable to take up a wartime job.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 168<U+2013>9.</ref> Eventually a specialist diagnosed glaucoma, but at that stage nothing could be done.<ref>Rogerson, p. 169.</ref> Rhodes was still able to see well enough to watch cricket and play golf, although by 1946 he was unable to read a newspaper. Another specialist was consulted in 1951 and an operation performed, but by 1952 Rhodes was completely blind. The build-up of pain led  to the removal of his left eyeball in 1958.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 170<U+2013>1.</ref> In 1950, Sarah Rhodes suffered a heart attack, which limited the help she could give to her husband; in 1954 she died a few months before her 80th birthday. Rhodes then sold his house at Marsh and moved in with his daughter and her husband, with whom he later moved to Bournemouth.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 170<U+2013>2.</ref> He continued to attend cricket matches where he was able to follow the play despite his blindness,<ref name="obituary"/> and was frequently sought out by cricketers and asked for his advice or opinion. Rhodes was given honorary life membership of Yorkshire in 1946, and of the M.C.C. in 1949.<ref>Rogerson, pp. 171<U+2013>2.</ref> When given membership of the M.C.C., along with other old professionals, Rhodes reacted characteristically; rather than showing pleasure, he responded, "I don't rightly know what it means yet."<ref name=H72/> He died in 1973, aged 95.<ref name="obituary"/>
