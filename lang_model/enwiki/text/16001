'''State Route 518''' is a [[state highway (US)|state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. It extends just under 3.5 miles (5.6&nbsp;km) from [[Burien, Washington|Burien]] in the west to [[Tukwila, Washington|Tukwila]] in the east.

==Route description==

Originating at [[State Route 509 (Washington)|State Route 509]], SR 518 runs east past [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]], just east of which is an interchange with [[State Route 99 (Washington)|State Route 99]] (International Boulevard). It intersects with [[Interstate 5 (Washington)|Interstate 5]] just northwest of [[Westfield Southcenter]] and continues eastward as [[Interstate 405 (Washington)|Interstate 405]].  It is a freeway its entire length.

A significant portion of Route 518's traffic is between the airport and the interstate.

The interchange between the SR 509 and SR 518 freeways currently is not a freeway to freeway junction. Traffic often backs up on the existing ramp from southbound SR 509 to get to SR 518. WSDOT has planned a project to improve the interchange by adding a [[flyover ramp]] to connect southbound SR 509 traffic to SR 518.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The entire route is in [[King County, WA|King County]].
