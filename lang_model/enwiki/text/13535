'''Flanders red ale''' is a style of sour [[ale]] usually brewed in [[Belgium]]. Although sharing a common ancestor with English porters of the 17th century<ref>Wheeler, G. & Roger Protz. ''Brew Your Own British Real Ale at Home'', CAMRA Books, 1996. ISBN 1-85249-138-8</ref>, the Flanders red ale has evolved along a different track: the beer is often [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] with organisms other than ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' being common to produce a sour character attributable to [[lactic acid]]; long periods of aging are employed, a year or more, often in [[oak]]en barrels, to impart an [[acetic acid]] character to the beer; special red [[malt]] is used to give the beer its unique color; and often the matured beer is blended with a younger batch before bottling to balance and round the character.

The beer appears deep red to brown in color, and should remain fairly clear in a glass. The aroma is a complex mixture of fruits: citrus, cherries, plum, raisin as well as some vanilla or chocolate undertones. The sourness of the beer can also be apparent in the aroma.

Flanders reds have a strong fruit flavor similar to the aroma, but more intense. Plum, prune, raisin and black cherry are the most common flavors, followed by orange and some spiciness. All Flanders red ales have an obvious sour or acidic taste, but this characteristic can range from moderate to strong. There is no hop bitterness, but [[tannins]] are common. Subsequently, Flanders red ales are often described as the most "wine-like" of all beers. However, this is also likely due to their distinctive red color.
