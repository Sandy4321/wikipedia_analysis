<!--Cause, pathophysiology and diagnosis -->
The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, [[stroke]], brain tumor, and drug and alcohol misuse. Genetic mutations are linked to a small proportion of the disease.<ref name="Longo 2012">{{cite book |last1=Longo |first1=Dan L |title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine |year=2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-174887-2 |page=3258 |edition=18th|chapter=369 Seizures and Epilepsy}}</ref> Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] nerve cell activity in the brain.<ref name=Fisher2005>{{cite journal| author = Fisher R, van Emde Boas W, Blume W, Elger C, Genton P, Lee P, Engel J| title = Epileptic seizures and epilepsy: definitions proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE)| journal = Epilepsia| volume = 46| issue = 4| pages = 470<U+2013>2| year = 2005| pmid = 15816939| url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0013-9580.2005.66104.x| doi = 10.1111/j.0013-9580.2005.66104.x}}</ref> The diagnosis typically involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]]. Additionally, making the diagnosis involves determining if any other cause of seizures is present such as [[alcohol withdrawal]] or [[electrolyte]] problems.<ref name="Longo 2012" /> This may be done by [[neuroimaging|imaging the brain]] and performing [[blood tests]].<ref name="Longo 2012"/> Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) but a normal test does not rule out the condition.<ref name="Longo 2012"/>

<!--Treatment  -->
Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases.<ref name=Ead2012>{{cite journal|last=Eadie|first=MJ|title=Shortcomings in the current treatment of epilepsy.|journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics|date=December 2012|volume=12|issue=12|pages=1419<U+2013>27|pmid=23237349|doi=10.1586/ern.12.129}}</ref> In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, [[surgery]], [[neurostimulation]] or dietary changes may be considered.

Epilepsy is characterized by a long-term risk of recurrent [[seizures]].<ref name=Adult2006>{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=JS|author2=Sander, JW|author3=Sisodiya, SM|author4=Walker, MC|title=Adult epilepsy.|journal=Lancet|date=1 April 2006|volume=367|issue=9516|pages=1087<U+2013>100|pmid=16581409|url=http://www.acutemed.co.uk/docs/Epilepsy,%20Lancet%204-06.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68477-8}}</ref> These seizures may present in several ways depending on the part of the brain involved and the person's age.<ref name=Adult2006/>{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|p=21<U+2013>28}}

===Seizures===
The most common type (60%) of seizures are [[convulsive]].{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=21<U+2013>28}} Of these, one-third begin as [[generalized seizure]]s from the start, affecting both hemispheres of the brain.{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=21<U+2013>28}} Two-thirds begin as [[partial seizure]]s (which affect one hemisphere of the brain) which may then progress to [[generalized seizure]]s.{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=21<U+2013>28}} The remaining 40% of seizures are non-convulsive. An example of this type is the [[absence seizure]], which presents as a decreased level of consciousness and usually lasts about 10 seconds.<ref name=Ham2010>{{cite book|last=Hammer|first=edited by Stephen J. McPhee, Gary D.|title=Pathophysiology of disease : an introduction to clinical medicine|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-162167-0|edition=6th ed.|chapter=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=JR|title=Absence seizures: a review of recent reports with new concepts.|journal=Epilepsy & behavior : E&B|date=August 2009|volume=15|issue=4|pages=404<U+2013>12|pmid=19632158|doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.06.007}}</ref>

<!--Partial  -->
[[Partial seizure]]s are often preceded by certain experiences, known as an [[Aura (symptom)|aura]].<ref name=EB06/> These may include sensory (visual, hearing or smell), psychic, autonomic, or motor phenomena.<ref name="Ham2010"/> Jerking activity may start in a specific muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups in which case it is known as a [[Jacksonian march]].<ref name=Brad2012>{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Walter G.|title=Bradley's neurology in clinical practice.|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4377-0434-1|edition=6th ed.|chapter=67}}</ref> [[Automatism (medicine)|Automatisms]] may occur; these are non-consciously generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick something up.<ref name=Brad2012/>

<!--Generalized  -->
There are six main types of generalized seizures: [[Tonic<U+2013>clonic seizure|tonic-clonic]], tonic, [[clonic seizure|clonic]], [[Myoclonus|myoclonic]], absence, and [[atonic seizure]]s.{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|p=119<U+2013>129}} They all involve loss of consciousness and typically happen without warning.<!-- <ref name=Neuro2012/> -->

Tonic-clonic seizures present with a contraction of the limbs followed by their extension along with arching of the back which lasts 10<U+2013>30&nbsp;seconds (the tonic phase).<!-- <ref name=Neuro2012/> --> A cry may be heard due to contraction of the chest muscles.<!-- <ref name=Neuro2012/> --> This is then followed by a shaking of the limbs in unison (clonic phase).<!-- <ref name=Neuro2012/> --> Tonic seizures produce constant contractions of the muscles.<!-- <ref name=Neuro2012/> --> A person often turns blue as breathing is stopped.<!-- <ref name=Neuro2012/> --> In clonic seizures there is shaking of the limbs in unison.<!-- <ref name=Neuro2012/> --> After the shaking has stopped it may take 10<U+2013>30&nbsp;minutes for the person to return to normal; this period is called the "[[postictal state]]" or "postictal phase".<!-- <ref name=Neuro2012/> --> Loss of bowel or bladder control may occur during a seizure.<ref name=WHO2012/> The tongue may be bitten at either the tip or on the sides during a seizure.<ref name=Engel2008pg2797/> In [[tonic-clonic seizure]], bites to the sides are more common.<ref name=Engel2008pg2797>{{cite book|last=Engel|first=Jerome|title=Epilepsy : a comprehensive textbook|year=2008|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-5777-5|page=2797|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=6Kq4Zt2KOpcC&pg=PA2797|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref> Tongue bites are also relatively common in [[psychogenic non-epileptic seizures]].<ref name=Engel2008pg2797/>

Myoclonic seizures involve spasms of muscles in either a few areas or all over.<ref name=Neuro2012/> Absence seizures can be subtle with only a slight turn of the head or eye blinking.<ref name=Ham2010/> The person does not fall over and returns to normal right after it ends.<ref name="Ham2010"/> Atonic seizures involve the loss of muscle activity for greater than one second.<ref name=Brad2012/> This typically occurs on both sides of the body.<ref name=Brad2012/>

<!--Triggers  -->
About 6% of those with epilepsy have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as [[reflex seizure]]s.<ref name=Reflex2008>{{cite book|title=Behavioral aspects of epilepsy : principles and practice|year=2008|publisher=Demos|location=New York|isbn=978-1-933864-04-4|page=125|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=a6Ygv5_RKKsC&pg=PA125|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|editor=Steven C.

===Postictal===
After the active portion of a seizure, there is typically a period of confusion referred to as the [[postictal]] period before a normal [[level of consciousness]] returns.<ref name=EB06/> This usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes<ref>{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Thomas R.|title=Handbook of epilepsy|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-7397-3|page=34|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=gLOv8XZ5u48C&pg=PA34|edition=4th ed.}}</ref> but may last for hours.<ref name=Post2010/> Other common symptoms include feeling tired, [[headache]], difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior.<ref name=Post2010>{{cite book|last=Panayiotopoulos|first=CP|title=A clinical guide to epileptic syndromes and their treatment based on the ILAE classifications and practice parameter guidelines|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=London|isbn=978-1-84628-644-5|page=445|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=yJQQzPTcbYIC&pg=PA445|edition=Rev. 2nd ed.}}</ref> [[Psychosis]] after a seizure is relatively common, occurring in 6<U+2013>10% of people.<ref>{{cite book|title=Advanced therapy in epilepsy|year=2009|publisher=People's Medical Pub.

===Psychosocial===
Epilepsy can have adverse effects on social and psychological well-being.{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=21<U+2013>28}} These effects may include social isolation, stigmatization, or disability.{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=21<U+2013>28}} They may result in lower educational achievement and worse employment outcomes.{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=21<U+2013>28}} Learning difficulties are common in those with the condition, and especially among [[epilepsy in children|children with epilepsy]].{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=21<U+2013>28}} The stigma of epilepsy can also affect the families of those with the disease.<ref name=WHO2012/>

== Causes ==
{{See also|Causes of seizures}}

== Pathophysiology ==
Normally brain electrical activity is non-synchronous.<ref name="Ham2010" /> Its activity is regulated by various factors both within the [[neuron]] and the cellular environment. Factors within the neuron include the type, number and distribution of [[ion channel]]s, changes to [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] and changes of [[gene expression]].<ref name=Intro2006/> Factors around the neuron include [[ion]] concentrations, [[synaptic plasticity]] and regulation of [[neurotransmitter|transmitter]] breakdown by [[Neuroglia|glial cell]]s.<ref name=Intro2006>{{cite book | title = An Introduction to Epilepsy | publisher = American Epilepsy Society | year = 2006 | last = Bromfield EB | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2510/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Cellular and Network Mechanisms of Spike-Wave Seizures | author = Blumenfeld, H | journal = Epilepsia | year = 2005 | volume = 46 | issue = Suppl.9 | pages = 21<U+2013>33 | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.00311.x | pmid = 16302873}}</ref>

In epilepsy the resistance of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased.<ref name=Ham2010/> This may occur due to changes in [[ion channel]]s or inhibitory neurons not functioning properly.<ref name=Ham2010/> This then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop, known as a "seizure focus".<ref name=Ham2010/> Another mechanism of epilepsy may be the up-regulation of excitatory circuits or down-regulation of inhibitory circuits following an injury to the brain.<ref name=Ham2010/><ref name=Gol2013/> These secondary epilepsies occur through processes known as [[epileptogenesis]].<ref name=Ham2010/><ref name=Gol2013>{{cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=EM|author2=Coulter, DA|title=Mechanisms of epileptogenesis: a convergence on neural circuit dysfunction.|journal=Nature reviews.

===Seizures===
There is evidence that [[epileptic seizure]] are usually not a random event. Seizures are often brought on by factors such as lack of sleep, stress or flickering light among others. The term [[seizure threshold]] is used to indicate the amount of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] necessary to bring about a seizure. Seizure threshold is lowered in epilepsy.<ref name = quyen2003/>

In epileptic seizures a group of neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive,{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|p = 21<U+2013>28}} and synchronized manner.<ref name="Ham2010" /> This results in a wave of depolarization known as a [[paroxysmal depolarizing shift]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Somjen|first=George G.|title=Ions in the Brain Normal Function, Seizures, and Stroke.|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-803459-9|page=167|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=WjSoQVt-taYC&pg=PA167}}</ref> Normally, after an [[excitatory neuron]] fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time.<ref name=Ham2010/> This is due in part to the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of [[adenosine]].<ref name=Ham2010/>

Partial seizures begin in one [[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere of the brain]] while generalized seizures begin in both hemispheres.{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=119<U+2013>129}} Some types of seizures may change brain structure, while others appear to have little effect.<ref name=Epi2008p483>{{cite book|title=Epilepsy : a comprehensive textbook|year=2008|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-5777-5|page=483|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=TwlXrOBkAS8C&pg=PA483|edition=2nd ed.|editor=Jerome Engel, Jr., Timothy A. Pedley}}</ref> [[Gliosis]], neuronal loss, and atrophy of specific areas of the brain are linked to epilepsy but it is unclear if epilepsy causes these changes or if these changes result in epilepsy.<ref name=Epi2008p483/>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:EEG Recording Cap.jpg|thumb|An [[electroencephalography|EEG]] can aid in locating the focus of the epileptic seizure.]]
The diagnosis of epilepsy is typically made based on the description of the seizure and the underlying cause.{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=21<U+2013>28}} An [[electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]] and [[neuroimaging]] are also usually part of the workup.{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=21<U+2013>28}} While figuring out a specific epileptic syndrome is often attempted, it is not always possible.{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=21<U+2013>28}} [[Long-term video-EEG monitoring|Video and EEG monitoring]] may be useful in difficult cases.{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|p=57<U+2013>83}}

===Definition===
Epilepsy is a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions:<ref name=Fisher2014/>
:{| cellpadding=5 style="border:1px solid #ccc"
|- bgcolor="#fafafa"
|
#At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring greater than 24 hours apart
#One unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years
#Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome
|}

Furthermore epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who had an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past the that age or those who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years.<ref name=Fisher2014/>

This 2014 definition of the [[International League Against Epilepsy]]<ref name=Fisher2014>{{cite journal |last=Fisher |first=Robert S |author2=Acevedo, C; Arzimanoglou, A; Bogacz, A; Cross, JH; Elger, CE; Engel J, Jr; Forsgren, L; French, JA; Glynn, M; Hesdorffer, DC; Lee, BI; Mathern, GW; Mosh<U+00E9>, SL; Perucca, E; Scheffer, IE; Tomson, T; Watanabe, M; Wiebe, S |title=ILAE Official Report: A practical clinical definition of epilepsy |journal=Epilepsia |date=April 2014 |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=475<U+2013>82 |pmid=24730690 |doi=10.1111/epi.12550 |url=http://www.ilae.org/Visitors/Centre/documents/Definition2014-RFisher.pdf}}</ref> is a refinement of their 2005 definition which was "a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The definition of epilepsy requires the occurrence of at least one epileptic seizure."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Robert S. Fisher, Walter van Emde Boas, Warren Blume, Christian Elger, Pierre Genton, Phillip Lee & Jerome Jr Engel | title = Epileptic seizures and epilepsy: definitions proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 470<U+2013>472 |date=April 2005 | doi = 10.1111/j.0013-9580.2005.66104.x | pmid = 15816939}}</ref><ref name=Pana2011>{{cite journal|last=Panayiotopoulos|first=CP|title=The new ILAE report on terminology and concepts for organization of epileptic seizures: a clinician's critical view and contribution.|journal=Epilepsia|date=December 2011|volume=52|issue=12|pages=2155<U+2013>60|pmid=22004554|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03288.x}}</ref>

It is therefore possible to outgrow epilepsy or to undergo treatment that causes the epilepsy to be resolved. Resolution of epilepsy unfortunately does not guarantee that it will not return. In the definition, epilepsy is now called a disease, rather than a disorder. This was a decision of the executive committee of the ILAE, taken because the word "disorder," while perhaps having less stigma than does "disease," also does not express the degree of seriousness that epilepsy deserves.<ref name=Fisher2014/>

The definition is practical in nature and is designed for clinical use. Researchers, statistically-minded epidemiologists and other specialized groups may choose to use the older definition or a definition of their own devising. The ILAE considers doing so is perfectly allowable, so long as it is clear what definition is being used.<ref name=Fisher2014/>

===Classification===
In contrast to the [[seizure types|classification of seizures]] which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis).{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=57<U+2013>83}} The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.

The [[International League Against Epilepsy]] (ILAE) provided a classification of the epilepsies and [[List of epilepsy syndromes|epileptic syndromes]] in 1989 as follows:<ref name="ILEA1989">{{cite journal | author = | title = Proposal for revised classification of epilepsies and epileptic syndromes.

===Syndromes===
{{Main|Epilepsy syndromes}}
Cases of epilepsy may be organized into [[epilepsy syndromes]] by the specific features that are present. These features include the age that seizure begin, the seizure types, [[electroencephalography|EEG]] findings, among others. Identifying an epilepsy syndrome is useful as it helps determine the underlying causes as well as what [[anticonvulsant|anti-seizure medication]] should be tried.<ref name = ileasyndromes2014>{{ cite web | title=Epilepsy syndromes | url = https://www.epilepsydiagnosis.org/syndrome/epilepsy-syndrome-groupoverview.html | publisher = International league against epilepsy | accessdate = 2014-10-06}}</ref>{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|p=119<U+2013>129}}

The ability to categorize a case of epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since the onset of seizures is commonly early.<ref name=Nel2012/> Less serious examples are [[benign rolandic epilepsy]] (2.8 per 100,000), [[childhood absence epilepsy]] (0.8 per 100,000) and [[juvenile myoclonic epilepsy]] (0.7 per 100,000).<ref name=Nel2012/> Severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused, at least partly, by some aspect of epilepsy, are also referred to as epileptic encephalopathies. These are associated with frequent [[seizures]] that are resistant to treatment and severe cognitive dysfunction, for instance [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]] and [[West syndrome]].<ref name=jcnnordli2012>{{cite journal | journal = J Clin Neurophysiol | year = 2012 | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 420<U+2013>4 | doi = 10.1097/WNP.0b013e31826bd961 | title = Epileptic encephalopathies in infants and children | author = Nordli DR jr | pmid = 23027099}}</ref> Genetics is believed to play an important role in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms.

Syndromes in which causes are not clearly identified are difficult to match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily.<ref name="2011rec"/> The ''idiopathic'' (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause.<ref name="2011rec"/> Some childhood epilepsy syndromes are included in the unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance [[benign rolandic epilepsy]]. Others are included in ''symptomatic'' despite a presumed genetic cause (in at least in some cases), for instance [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]].<ref name="2011rec"/> Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. [[Angelman syndrome]]) were categorized ''symptomatic'' but it was argued to include these within the category ''idiopathic''.<ref name="2011rec"/> Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.

===Tests===
<!--EEG Same as seizure  -->
An [[electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]] (EEG) can assist in showing brain activity suggestive of an increased risk of seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present.<!-- {{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=57<U+2013>83}} --> In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure.<!-- {{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=57<U+2013>83}} --> It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis, and may be falsely positive in those without the disease.<!-- {{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=57<U+2013>83}} --> In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.{{sfnp |National Clinical Guideline Centre|2012|pp=57<U+2013>83}}

<!--Imaging Same as seizure  -->

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had contradictory views of the disease. They thought of epilepsy as a form of spiritual possession, but also associated the condition with genius and the divine. One of the names they gave to it was the ''sacred disease''.<ref name=magiorkinis_2010/><ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://allcountries.org/health/epilepsy_historical_overview.html |title=Epilepsy: historical overview |work=World Health Organization|accessdate=2011-03-20}}</ref> Epilepsy appears within Greek mythology: it is associated with the Moon goddesses [[Selene]] and [[Artemis]], who afflicted those who upset them. The Greeks thought that important figures such as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Hercules]] had the disease.<ref name=magiorkinis_2010/> The notable exception to this divine and spiritual view was that of the school of [[Hippocrates]]. In the fifth century BC, Hippocrates rejected the idea that the disease was caused by spirits. In his landmark work ''[[On the Sacred Disease]]'', he proposed that epilepsy was not divine in origin and instead was a medically treatable problem originating in the brain.<ref name=magiorkinis_2010/><ref name="WHO_Atlas2005" /> He accused those of attributing a sacred cause to the disease of spreading ignorance through a belief in superstitious magic.<ref name=magiorkinis_2010/> Hippocrates proposed that [[heredity]] was important as a cause, described worse outcomes if the disease presents at an early age, and made note of the physical characteristics as well as the social shame associated with it.<ref name=magiorkinis_2010/>  Instead of referring to it as the ''sacred disease'', he used the term ''great disease'', giving rise to the modern term ''grand mal'', used for generalized seizures.<ref name=magiorkinis_2010/> Despite his work detailing the physical origins of the disease, his view was not accepted at the time.<ref name="WHO_Atlas2005" /> Evil spirits continued to be blamed until at least the 17th century.<ref name="WHO_Atlas2005" />
