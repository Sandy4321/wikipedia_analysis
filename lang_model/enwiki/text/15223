'''''Kirishima''''' {{nihongo||<U+9727><U+5CF6>||}} was a fast battleship of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. She was the third ship of [[Kongo class battlecruiser|her class]], and was designed by British naval engineer [[George Thurston]]. Laid down as a [[battlecruiser]] in 1912 at [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], ''Kirishima'' was formally commissioned in 1915 on the same day as her sister-ship [[Japanese battleship Haruna|''Haruna'']]; she was one of the four most powerful [[capital ship]]s in the Imperial Japanese Navy at the time. ''Kirishima'' saw minor patrolling duty during World War I, and helped with rescue efforts following the [[Great Kanto Earthquake]] of 1923.

''Kirishima'' underwent two major reconstructions during her maritime career. The first of these, started in 1927, rebuilt her as a battleship, strengthening her armour and improving her speed. The second, started in 1934, completely rebuilt her superstructure, upgraded her engine plant, and equipped her with floatplanes. Capable of the speeds necessary to accompany Japan's fast carrier fleet, she was reclassified as a [[fast battleship]] following her second reconstruction. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], ''Kirishima'' acted as a support vessel and troop transport, moving army troops to mainland China. On the eve of World War II, she sailed as part of Vice-Admiral [[Chuichi Nagumo]]'s Combined Fleet as an escort for the six fast carriers that [[attack on Pearl Harbour|attacked Pearl Harbour on 7 December 1941]]. 

As part of the Third Battleship Division, ''Kirishima'' participated in many of the Imperial Japanese Navy's early actions in 1942, providing support for the invasion of the Dutch East Indies and the Indian Ocean Raid of April 1942. During the [[Battle of Midway]], she provided escort to Nagumo's four fast carriers, before redeploying to the Solomon Islands during the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]]. She escorted Japanese carrier fleets during the battles of the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Eastern Solomons]] and [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Santa Cruz Islands]], before sailing as part of a bombardment force under Admiral [[Nobutake Kondo]] during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]. On the evening of 13 November 1942, ''Kirishima'' engaged American cruisers and destroyers alongside her sister ship ''Hiei''. On the night of 14/15 November, in one of two battleship duels of the Pacific theatre, ''Kirishima'' engaged (and heavily damaged) the [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|USS ''South Dakota'']] before being crippled in turn by the battleship [[USS Washington (BB-56)|USS ''Washington'']]. ''Kirishima'' capsized and sank in the early morning on 15 November 1942 in [[Ironbottom Sound]].

==Design and construction==
''Kirishima'' was the third of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s {{Sclass|Kong<U+014D>|battlecruiser|6}}s, a line of [[capital ship]]s designed by the British naval engineer [[George Thurston]].<ref name=kongoclass>{{cite web |url= http://combinedfleet.com/ship.php?q=kongo_c.htm|title= Combined Fleet - ''Kongo'' class battlecruiser|accessdate=2009-02-11 |work= Parshall, Jon; Bob Hackett, Sander Kingsepp, & Allyn Nevitt|publisher= |date= }}</ref>  The class was ordered in 1910 in the Japanese Emergency Naval Expansion Bill after the commissioning of {{HMS|Invincible|1907|6}} in 1908.<ref name=cfrecord>{{Cite web |url= http://combinedfleet.com/Kirishima.htm|title= Combined Fleet - tabular history of ''Kirishima''|accessdate=23 May 2010 |work= |publisher=Parshall, Jon; Bob Hackett, Sander Kingsepp, & Allyn Nevitt |date=}}</ref>  The four battlecruisers of the ''Kong<U+014D>'' class were designed to match the naval capabilities of the other major powers at the time; they have been called the battlecruiser version of the British (formerly Turkish) battleship {{HMS|Erin|1913|6}}.<ref name="Conway's">Gardiner and Gray (1980), p. 234</ref><ref name=jackson-07-27>Jackson (2007), p. 27</ref>  With their heavy armament and armor protection (which took up 23.3% of their approximately 30,000&nbsp;ton displacement),<ref name="Conway's"/> ''Kirishima'' and her sister ships were vastly superior to any other Japanese [[capital ship]] afloat at the time.<ref name=jackson-07-27/>

===Armament===
''Kirishima''{{'s}} main battery consisted of eight {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} heavy-caliber main guns in four twin turrets (two forward, two aft).<ref name=kongoclass/> The turrets were noted by the US Office of Naval Intelligence to be "similar to the British 15-inch turrets",<ref name=NW-14/> with improvements made in flash-tightness.

== Service ==
===1914-1927: Battlecruiser===

[[File:Kirishima Sasebo 1915.jpg|thumb|right|''Kirishima'' docked at Sasebo in December 1915]]

''Kirishima'' was formally commissioned on 19 April 1915, and along with [[Japanese battleship Haruna|''Haruna'']] was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the First Fleet.<ref name=cfrecord/> After seven months of trials, she was reassigned to the 3rd Battleship Division of the Second Fleet, with Captain Shima Takeshi in overall command of the ship. In April 1916, ''Kirishima'' and ''Haruna'' departed [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo Naval Base]] to patrol the [[East China Sea]] for ten days. She remained in Sasebo until April 1917, when she again deployed to the Chinese coast with her sister-ships ''Haruna'' and [[Japanese battleship Kongo|''Kongo'']]. Her last patrol operation of the First World War was off the Chinese and Korean coast in April 1918. In July 1918, ''Kirishima'' acted as the transport of [[Prince Arthur of Connaught]] for his extended cruise to Canada, before returning to Japan.<ref name=cfrecord/>

Following the end of the First World War, the Japanese Empire annexed the Korean Peninsula and gained control of former German possessions in the central Pacific per the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref>Willmott, p. 22</ref> Due to Japan's warm relations with the British Empire and the United States at the time, ''Kirishima'' and other Japanese warships became significantly less active than during the war. On 1 December 1920, she was reassigned to the Third Division of the Second Fleet. Other than a patrol alongside ''Kongo'' and [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] off the Chinese coast in August 1921, ''Kirishima'' remained in Sasebo.<ref name=cfrecord/> On 10 September 1922, she collided with the [[Japanese destroyer Fuji|destroyer ''Fuji'']] during fleet maneuvers, with both ships sustaining minor damage. Following the [[Great Kanto Earthquake]] of September 1923, the capital ships of the Japanese Navy assisted in rescue work until the end of the month. She was placed in reserve in December 1923.<ref name=cfrecord/>

With the conclusion of World War I and the signing of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], the size of the Imperial Japanese Navy was significantly lessened, with a ratio of 5:5:3 required between the capital ships of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan.<ref name=jackson-00-67>Jackson (2000), p. 67</ref>  The treaty also banned Japan from building any new capital ships until 1931, with no capital ship permitted to exceed 35,000&nbsp;tons.<ref name=jackson-00-68>Jackson (2000), p. 68</ref>  Provided that new additions did not exceed 3,000&nbsp;tons, existing capital ships were allowed to be upgraded with improved torpedo bulges and deck armour.<ref name=jackson-00-68/>  By the time the Washington Treaty had been fully implemented in Japan, only three classes of World War I-era capital ships&mdash;the [[Fus<U+014D> class battleship|''Yamashiro'']] and [[Ise class battleship|''Ise'' class]] battleships, and the ''Kong<U+014D>'' class battlecruisers&mdash;remained active.<ref>Jackson (2000), p. 69</ref>

===1927-1934: Reconstruction into Battleship===

[[File:Kirishima Beppu 1932.jpg|thumb|left|''Kirishima'' in 1932, following her first reconstruction]]

Stripped of the ability to construct new capital ships, the Japanese Navy instead opted to significantly upgrade and reconfigure their existing battleships and battlecruisers.<ref>Willmott, p. 45</ref> ''Kirishima'' was placed in Third Reserve in December 1926, before beginning her first reconstruction in early 1927. Horizontal armour over the ammunition magazines was strengthened, while she was also fitted with anti-torpedo bulges, as permitted by the Washington Treaty.<ref name=cfrecord/> To upgrade ''Kirishima''{{'s}} speed capabilities, the 36 coal-fired [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] boilers were removed and replaced with ten new mixed-firing Kampon boilers.<ref>Whitley, pp. 178, 180</ref> To allow for more equipment to be installed onboard, her forward superstructure was also reconstructed in the [[Pagoda mast]] style, facilitating the removal of one of her three funnels.<ref name=cfrecord/> The reconstruction of the ''Kong<U+014D>'' class battlecruisers added an additional 4,000 tons of armour to the ships, directly violating the terms of the Washington Treaty.<ref name=jackson-08-27>Jackson (2008), p. 27</ref> On 16 April 1930, the reconstruction was declared complete.{{#tag:ref|Sources disagree on the exact dates of the reconstruction. While ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships'' gives the beginning date of March 1927 and an end-date of 31 March 1930, ''Kirishima''{{'}}s ''Combined Fleet'' Tabular Record of Movement states that it was from May 1927 to 16 April 1930.<ref>Gardiner and Gray (1980), p. 234</ref><ref name=cfrecord/>|group=N}}

Six days after ''Kirishima''{{'s}} reconstruction was completed, Japan signed the [[London Naval Treaty]], which placed further bans on capital ship construction until 1937, and pledged to scrap several of Japan's remaining battleships.<ref name=jackson-00-72/> From August-October 1930, she was outfitted with the equipment necessary to equip reconnaissance seaplanes. In September 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, violating existing [[League of Nations]] protocols and international law.<ref name=jackson-00-72>Jackson (2000), p. 72</ref> ''Kirishima'' patrolled the coast of China near Shanghai in April 1932, before she was again placed in the Third Reserve.

On 25 February 1933, the League of Nations agreed that Japan had violated Chinese sovereignty in its invasion of Manchuria.<ref name=jackson-00-72/> Refusing to accept the organization's judgment, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations the same day.<ref name=jackson-00-72/>  Immediately following, Japan also withdrew from the Washington and London Naval Treaties, thus removing all restrictions on the number and size of her capital ships.<ref>Willmott (2002), p. 35</ref>

===1934-1941: Fast Battleship===
[[File:Kirishima and Akagi at Tsukumowan 1939.jpg|thumb|right|''Kirishima'' and the fast carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] off Tsukumowan, April 1939]]
On 18 November 1934, ''Kirishima'' was drydocked in Sasebo in preparation for her second reconstruction, which would enable her to function alongside Japan's growing fleet of fast carriers. Her stern was lengthened by 26 feet, while her superstructure was rebuilt to allow for new fire-control mechanisms to be added.<ref name=cfrecord/> Her boilers were removed and replaced with eight new oil-fired Kampon Boilers, and she received newer geared turbines.<ref name=jackson-08-27/> The elevation of her main and secondary battery was increased, and she was equipped with two [[Nakajima E8N|Nakajima E8N "Dave"]] and [[Kawanishi E7K|Kawanishi E7K "Alf"]] reconnaissance floatplanes. To this end, her catapults and launch-rails were also refitted.<ref name=cfrecord/> Her older 3-inch guns were removed and replaced with with eight 5-inch dual-purpose guns. She was also outfitted with twenty 25&nbsp;mm antiaircraft guns in twin turrets, while two of her 6&nbsp;inch guns and her remaining torpedo tubes were removed.<ref name=stille17>Stille, p. 17</ref>

''Kirishima''{{'s}} armour was also extensively upgraded. Her main belt was strengthened to a uniform thickness of 8 inches (as opposed to varying thicknesses of 6-8 inches before the upgrades), while diagonal bulkheads of a depth ranging from {{convert|5|to|8|in|mm|0}} reinforced the main armoured belt.<ref name=mccurtie185>McCurtie, p. 185</ref> The turret armour was strengthened to {{convert|10|in|mm|0}}, while {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} were added to portions of the deck armour.<ref name=mccurtie185/> The armour around her ammunition magazines was also strengthened over the course of the refit. The reconstruction was declared complete on 8 June 1936. Capable of speeds of up to {{convert|30.5|kn}}, ''Kirishima'' was reclassified as a fast battleship.<ref name=willmott35>Willmott, p. 35</ref>

In August 1936, ''Kirishima'' departed Sasebo alongside [[Japanese battleship Fuso|''Fuso'']] to patrol the Chinese coast off Amoy. From March 1937<U+2013>April 1939, she was frequently deployed as a support vessel and troop transport during Japanese operations as part of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. In November 1938, ''Kirishima'' was designated the command vessel of the Third Battleship Division, and was under the command of Rear Admiral [[Chuichi Nagumo]]. In November 1939, she was placed in reserve and fitted with additional armour on the front face of her turrets and barbettes.<ref name=cfrecord/>

On 11 November 1941, after a continual series of transfers between Japanese naval bases, ''Kirishima'' was outfitted in preparation for coming hostilities and assigned <U+2014> alongside her sister-ships <U+2014> to the Third Battleship Division. On 26 November, ''Kirishima'' departed Hitokappu Bay, [[Kurile Islands]] in the company of ''Hiei'' and six Japanese fast carriers of the First Air Fleet Striking Force (''Akagi'', [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|''Kaga'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Soryu|''Soryu'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryu|''Hiryu'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shokaku|''Shokaku'']], and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']]). On 7 December 1941, aircraft from these six carriers [[Attack on Pearl Harbour|attacked the United States Pacific Fleet]] at their home base of [[Pearl Harbour]], sinking four U.S. Navy battleships and numerous other vessels. Following the attack and the declaration of war by the United States, ''Kirishima'' returned to Japan.

===1942: Combat and Loss===

[[File:KondoKirishimaNov14.jpg|thumb|right|''Kirishima'' (center) and the cruiser ''Takao'' steaming for Guadalcanal, 14 November 1942]]

On 8 January 1942, ''Kirishima'' departed Japan for Truk Naval Base in the Caroline Islands alongside the Carrier strikeforce. She provided escort during the invasion of [[New Britain]] on 17 January before returning to Truk. She sortied again in response to American carrier raids in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands.<ref name=cfrecord/> In March 1942, while supporting fleet operations off of Java in the [[Dutch East Indies]], one of ''Kirishima''{{'s}} floatplanes bombed an enemy merchant vessel. South of Java, the Japanese fleet was surprised by the appearance of the destroyer [[USS Edsall (DD-219)|USS ''Edsall'']]. While ''Hiei'' and [[Japanese cruiser Chikuma|''Chikuma'']] initially opened fire on the ship, they failed to score any hits. After dive-bombers from three of Admiral Nagumo's carriers immobilized the destroyer, ''Kirishima'' and the other two ships resumed firing on the ''Edsall'' until she sank.<ref name=cfrecord/>

In April 1942, ''Kirishima'' and the Third Battleship division joined five fleet carriers and two cruisers in an [[Indian Ocean Raid|attack against British naval bases in the Indian Ocean]]. On 5 April <U+2014> Easter Sunday <U+2014> the Japanese fleet attacked the harbour  at [[Colombo]], while seaplanes from the [[Japanese cruiser Tone|''Tone'']] spotted two fleeing British cruisers, both of which were later sunk by aerial attack.<ref>Jackson (2000), p. 119</ref> A floatplane from ''Kirishima'' also strafed a withdrawing [[oil tanker]].<ref name=cfrecord/> On 8 April, Japanese carrier aircraft attacked the British base at [[Trincomalee]], only to find that all of Admiral [[James Somerville]]'s warships had withdrawn the previous night. Returning from the attack, a floatplane from ''Kirishima''{{'s}} sister ship ''Haruna'' spotted the aircraft carrier [[HMS Hermes (95)|HMS ''Hermes'']], which was quickly sunk by massive aerial attack.<ref>Jackson (2000), p. 120</ref> Upon returning to Japan, ''Kirishima'' was drydocked and her secondary armament configuration modified with the addition of 25&nbsp;mm antiaircraft guns in twin mounts.<ref name=cfrecord/><ref>Stille, p. 18</ref>

In June 1942, ''Kirishima'' sailed as part of the Carrier Strike force during the [[Battle of Midway]], providing escort for Admiral Nagumo's four fast carriers alongside ''Haruna''.<ref name=stille19>Stille, p. 19</ref> Following the disastrous battle - during which all four Japanese carriers were sunk - she took on survivors from the four scuttled flattops before returning to Japan.<ref name=cfrecord/> In August 1942, she departed Japan for the Solomon Islands in the company of ''Hiei'', three carriers, three cruisers and eleven destroyers, in response to the [[Battle of Guadalcanal|American invasion of Guadalcanal]]. She escorted Japanese carriers during the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]], during which the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>|light carrier ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'']] was sunk.<ref name=stille19/> Following the battle, the fleet returned to Truk Naval Base. During the [[Battle of Santa Cruz]], ''Kirishima'' was part of Rear Admiral [[Hiroaki Abe]]'s Vanguard Force, which provided distant cover to Nagumo's carrier groups.<ref name=stille19/> She was attacked by American dive-bombers on 26 October, yet remained undamaged.

On 10 November 1942, ''Kirishima'' departed Truk alongside ''Hiei'' and eleven destroyers in preparation to shell American positions on Guadalcanal in advance of a major transport convoy of Japanese troops. U.S. Navy reconnaissance aircraft spotted the Japanese fleet several days in advance, and deployed a force of two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers and eight destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral [[Daniel J. Callaghan]] in [[Ironbottom Sound]] to meet them.<ref>Hammel, pp. 99<U+2013>107</ref> At 01:24 on 13 November, the Japanese force was detected {{convert|28000|yd|km}} out by the light cruiser [[USS Helena (CL-50)|USS ''Helena'']]. In the ensuing [[First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], the American task force concentrated the majority of their firepower on the battleship ''Hiei''.<ref name=stille19/> This enabled ''Kirishima'' to score multiple hits on the heavy cruiser [[USS San Francisco (CA-38)|USS ''San Francisco'']] and ''Helena'', while ''Hiei'' crippled the light cruiser [[USS Atlanta (CL-51)|USS ''Atlanta'']], killing Rear Admiral [[Norman Scott]].<ref>Stille, pp. 19<U+2013>20</ref> Both ''Hiei'' and ''Kirishima'' then raked ''San Francisco'' with shellfire, killing Rear Admiral Callaghan.<ref>Morison, p. 247</ref> However, ''Hiei'' was in turn crippled by ''San Francisco'' and several American destroyers. With ''Hiei'' effectively out of the battle, ''Kirishima'' and the surviving destroyers withdrew to the north. On the morning of 13 November, she was ordered to tow ''Hiei'' to safety.<ref name=cfrecord/>. However, the heavily damaged battleship came under air attack, and was eventually abandoned and scuttled.<ref name=stille20>Stille, p. 20</ref><ref>Schom, p. 417</ref>

[[File:NavalGuadalcanalWashington.jpg|thumb|left|''Washington'' fires on ''Kirishima'' during the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 15 November 1942]]

On the evening of 13 November, ''Kirishima'' and her escorting destroyers were joined by the Fourth Cruiser Division and prepared to reenter Ironbottom Sound under the command of Admiral [[Nobutake Kondo]]. In the early morning of 14 November, three Japanese heavy cruisers bombarded Guadalcanal before withdrawing.<ref name=cfrecord/> Aware of the damage suffered by his ships the previous night, Admiral [[William Halsey]] reinforced the American naval units with the new battleships [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|''South Dakota'']] and [[USS Washington (BB-56)|''Washington'']].<ref name=stille20/> The two fleets made contact on 14 November at 23:01. The two forces exchanged gunfire and torpedoes, with four American destroyers disabled (three would later sink), while the [[Japanese destroyer Ayanami|Japanese destroyer ''Ayanami'']] was crippled by ''Washington and South Dakota''.<ref>Frank, p. 478</ref> At 23:40, ''South Dakota'' suffered a series of electrical failures, crippling her radar, radios and gun batteries.<ref name=schom424>Schom, p. 424</ref> ''Kirishima'' and the heavy cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Atago|''Atago'']] illuminated the battleship with searchlights, and the near entirety of Kondo's force opened fire.<ref name=schom424/> ''Kirishima'' managed to hit ''South Dakota'' with one salvo of 14-inch shells and numerous salvos from her secondary battery, which knocked out the battleship's fire control systems and communications. ''Washington'', undetected, managed to evade the Japanese fleet, and at midnight fired on ''Kirishima'' from {{convert|5800|yd|m}}.<ref name=schom424/><ref>Garzke and Dulin, p. 44</ref> ''Kirishima'' was hit by nine primary and forty secondary battery salvos, jamming her rear 14-inch turrets, steering, and causing the battleship to list 18 degrees to starboard. Initially, the light cruiser ''Nagara'' attempted to tow her out of Ironbottom Sound.<ref name=cfrecord/> ''Kirishima'' capsized at 03:25 on the morning of 15 November 1942, with 212 crewmen lost.<ref name=stille20/>
