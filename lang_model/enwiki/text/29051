'''Hellmuth Kolbe''' (28.8.1926 <U+2013> 15.7.2002) was a Swiss musician, audio recording and acoustics pioneer.

== Childhood and education, Zug (Switzerland) and Vienna (Austria) ==

Hellmuth Kolbe was the son of Austrian lawyer Walter Karl Kolbe, stationed in Berlin when son Hellmuth was born in 1926, and Editha Berta Ehrbar also of Viennese origin. The family of his mother was from the renowned Austrian piano manufacturer [[:de:Friedrich_Ehrbar|Friedrich Ehrbar]] (1827-1905), an Austrian <U+201C>k. u. k. Hof- und Kammer-Klavier-Fabrikant<U+201D> (Austrian Emperor's and King's Court and Chamber Piano Maker).<ref name = "Kolbe 2012"> Kolbe (2012) </ref> <ref name = "Brown 2002"> Brown (2002) </ref>
<!--- The company produced pianos in small numbers until the 1980<U+2019>s<ref>[[:de:Friedrich_Ehrbar]] </ref> and Kolbe<U+2019>s mother wished her son would later become instrumental in the family business. <ref name="Kolbe 2012" />  --->
The parents Edith and Walter separated when Kolbe was approximately five years old and his mother moved to Zug <ref> [[Zug]] </ref>, [[Switzerland]], where she remarried, and where Hellmuth Kolbe spent the remainder of his childhood. <ref name="Kolbe 2012" /> <ref name="Brown 2002" />
<!--- Kolbe<U+2019>s step-father was a Swiss bank owner who extended the family by a step-brother and step-sister.<ref name="Kolbe 2012" /> <ref name = "Leonhard 2012"> Leonhard (2012) </ref>  --->
Son Hellmuth completed 12 years of schooling in Zug (1933-1945), and, according to his later occupation, his main interests must have been music, electronics, physics and mathematics. Kolbe was very musical and played piano, double-bass and vibraphone. In 1945 he got a job as a pianist for a season at a hotel in [[Engelberg]], in the Swiss Alps,<ref name="Kolbe 2012" /> and worked during the day as a ski instructor. <ref name="Brown 2002" /> His fluency in English, French, and German was appreciated by his then employer; later he also learned Spanish and Italian. <ref name="Brown 2002" />

By the fall of 1946 he went to [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], and began extensive studies in music and musicology <U+2013> the main subject being orchestral conducting.
<!--- It is reported that one of the reasons he left Switzerland was to evade military service. --->
In 1953, he received his diploma from the [http://www.konservatorium-wien.ac.at/ Conservatory Vienna], Austria. Thereafter, he enrolled at the Vienna Academy of Music and Performing Arts as it was then designated, now the [[Vienna]] [[University of Music and Performing Arts]].<ref name="Kolbe 2012" /> <ref name="Brown 2002" /> Kolbe was a pupil of [[:de:Hans_Erich_Apostel|Hans Erich Apostel]] (1901-1972), who headed the Austrian section of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) from 1946-1948. <ref> http://www.classical-composers.org/comp/apostel </ref> <ref> http://www.schoenberglaw.com/exiles/apostel.html </ref> Apostel had also studied with Arnold Sch<U+00F6>nberg (1874-1951) and Alban Berg (1885-1935), two prominent members of the so-called Second Viennese School. <ref> [[Second Viennese School]] </ref>  From 1947 to 1950, Kolbe also worked as editor for the Universal Edition Vienna, revising the scores of, among other works, Berg's Wozzeck and Lulu. <ref> [[Wozzeck]] </ref> <ref> [[Lulu (opera)]] </ref>
<!--- Kolbe later said that he did not complete the degree at the Academy of Music because his chosen topic for a dissertation, <U+201C>The influence of Johann Sebastian Bach on Jazz<U+201D>, was not accepted.<ref name="Brown 2002" /> --->
According to Kolbe<U+2019>s letter to an unidentified colleague <U+201C>Franzi<U+201D> in Germany<ref name="Kolbe letter to Franzi 1950"> Kolbe letter to "Franzi" (1950) </ref>, Kolbe must have been quite laborious in Vienna: he was a member of the Austrian ''Hot Club Seven'' until they temporarily dissolved in early 1950. In this group, Kolbe played with widely known Austrian Jazz musicians, among them Fatty George (Franz Georg Pressler, 1927-1982). <ref> [[:de:Fatty_George]] </ref> Fatty<U+2019>s first successes occurred with this Viennese band and contemporary female Austrians vividly remember the Swiss vibraphone player and bandleader <U+201C>Hello<U+201D> Kolbe from that group <ref> http://seniorinnen.gruene.at/kunstkultur/artikel/lesen/43445/ </ref>. The ''Hot Club Seven'' mostly played for US military forces and in Austrian officer casinos of the [[Soviet Army]]. In 1950, Kolbe held lectures titled ''Introduction to Jazz Music'' at the <U+00D6>sterreichische Radio-Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft (Austrian radio transmission company (RAVAG) <ref> http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.encyclop.r/r223183.htm;internal&action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en </ref>, had his own Jazz program each week on Thursday and Friday night at RAVAG radio station Wien I, led several Jazz combos and wrote Jazz critics. <ref name="Kolbe letter to Franzi on critics 1950"> Kolbe letter to "Franzi" on critics (1950). In this letter, Kolbe writes: "Ich bin eben dabei, mir als Jazzkritiker hier einen Namen zu machen" ("I am just about to become known as Jazz critic here").  </ref>
In 1947, Kolbe approached the [[American Forces Network|American Armed Forces Radio]], looking for employment, and in 1948 started to work as independent producer/engineer for US forces radio station Rot-Weiss-Rot <ref> [[:de:/Rot-Wei%C3%9F-Rot_(Sender)]] German only </ref> (RWR), located in the American sector of Vienna. <ref name = "Nelson 1987"> Nelson (1987) </ref> <ref name = "Emmenegger 1972"> Emmenegger (1972) </ref> Soon after employment they sent him to the [http://www.musikverein.at Wiener Musikverein] with its great concert rooms to record the many famous orchestras that still perform there (Wiener Philhamoniker <U+2013> Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, <ref> http://www.wienerphilharmoniker.at </ref> Wiener Symphoniker <U+2013> Vienna Symphony Orchestra) <ref> http://www.wiener-symphoniker.at </ref> etc.), and a recording career that produced more than 1<U+2019>000 albums began. <ref name = "Brown 2002" />

Kolbe in a 1987 interview<ref name="Nelson 1987" />: <U+201C>We were two Americans, two Swiss and 17 Austrians and we were heard all over Europe. My department was Jazz and modern classical, together with being involved in the design of the studios. We also did a lot of live concerts including one a week from the large concert hall in Vienna, where we used just one microphone, a [http://www.shure.com/ Shure] modified with an [http://www.akg.com/ AKG] capsule [probably a C1, C2 or C12, author's remark <ref> http://www.micshop.com/AKG_History.pdf See under 1947 heading </ref>], and it sounded wonderful!<U+201D> At RWR, Kolbe was employed for the Sunday morning concerts <ref name="Emmenegger 1972" /> and so had the opportunity to record among others [[Wilhelm Furtwangler]] (1886-1954) and [[Bruno Walter]] (1876-1962). <ref name="Emmenegger 1972" /> Between 1951 and 1963, Kolbe operated his first recording studio, <U+201C>Mastertone<U+201D> in Vienna. <ref name = "Kolbe 2012" /> <ref name = "Brown 2002" /> <ref name = "Emmenegger 1972"> Emmenegger (1972) </ref> He had successes with US labels [[Vox Records|Vox]] and [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]] for which Kolbe recorded music in Austria that was then pressed as 10 or 12 inch vinyl long play [[LP]] discs, and finally distributed and sold to [[Vox Records|Vox]] and [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]] retailers worldwide. Kolbe <ref name="Nelson 1987" />: <U+201C>At that time the rate of exchange of the dollar to the Austrian Schilling was very favorable and American record companies soon found it well worthwhile to record in Vienna<U+201D>. In 1972 Kolbe pointed out <ref name="Emmenegger 1972" />, that at that time <U+201C>a lot was going on in Austria<U+201D>. Kolbe in the 1987 interview <ref name = "Nelson 1987" />: <U+201C>The autumn of 1953 saw us getting the first stereo [[Ampex]] [tape] recorder in Europe [an Ampex 350 <ref> http://reel2reeltexas.com/cat55Allied.html </ref>] and we immediately started recording in stereo <U+2013> which meant we aimed for proper stereo image rather than the <U+2018>ping-pong<U+2019> style that was popular in the early days <U+2013> everything on the left or the right and no middle<U+201D>. From the beginning, Kolbe was a strong advocator of 3-channel stereo. <ref name = "Leonhard 2012"> Leonhard (2012) </ref>

The electronic music composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] (1928-2007), who left Paris in March 1953, took up a position as assistant to [[Herbert Eimert]] (1897-1972) at the newly established Electronic Music Studio of [[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk]], NWDR in [[Cologne]] (since 1.1.1955 designated [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]], WDR) and in 1956 worked  with Hellmuth Kolbe as engineer.<ref> http://www.discogs.com/artist/Hellmuth+Kolbe Hellmuth Kolbe Discography </ref> Together they elaborated the first electronic music <U+201C>scores<U+201D> which consisted of frequency vs. time graphs. Kolbe in a 1987 interview <ref name = "Nelson 1987" />: <U+201C>There was no way you could use traditional notation<U+201D>. In 1965, the result of their collaboration culminated in recordings of Stockhausen<U+2019>s <U+201C>Klavierst<U+00FC>cke I-XI<U+201D> <ref> [[Klavierst<U+00FC>cke (Stockhausen)]]  </ref>, composed between 1952 and 1961, and <U+201C>Mikrophonie I/II<U+201D> <ref> [[Mikrophonie (Stockhausen)]] </ref>, composed 1964 and 1965, both with Hellmuth Kolbe engineering. <ref> http://www.discogs.com/artist/Hellmuth+Kolbe Hellmuth Kolbe Discography </ref>
From 1955 to1975, Kolbe worked as freelance chief recording engineer and producer for Columbia International (CBS Masterworks).<ref name = "Brown 2002" />  <ref name = "Kolbe Main Acoustic Activities"> Kolbe Main Acoustic Activities (no date) </ref> During that time, [[CBS]] (Columbia Broadcasting System) <ref> [[CBS]] </ref> employed Kolbe to record all their classical collections in Europe but the majority of his recordings were either not credited or credited to a passive <U+201C>supervising<U+201D> engineer.  <ref name = "Brown 2002" /> These jobs involved extensive travel to record on location, even to Israel right after the Six-Day War in early June 1967, or to record Mahler<U+2019>s 8th symphony with Leonard Bernstein and the London Symphony Orchestra in 3-track stereo (18-20 April 1966 at Walthamstow Assembly Hall, Waltham Forest, East London), after a televised performance in London <ref> http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2001/July01/MahlerBernstein.htm </ref>, with added reverberation from the Grossm<U+00FC>nster, Z<U+00FC>rich <ref name = "Leonhard 2012"> Leonhard (2012) </ref>, for which Kolbe received the recognition of nomination for the best engineered recording <U+2013> classical <U+2013> for awards period 1967 in 1968, or again in 1966 when Kolbe went to Paris for Columbia Masterworks to tape [[Alban Berg]]<U+2019>s <U+201C>[[Wozzeck]]<U+201D> with conductor [[Pierre Boulez]] (born 1925) and <U+201C>Orchestre et Ch<U+0153>rs de L'Opera<U+201D>, Paris (CBS Set -3003). For this, Kolbe received the <U+201C>grand prix du disque<U+201D>, an <U+201C>[[Acad<U+00E9>mie Charles Cros]] Diplome<U+201D>. <ref name = "Kolbe 2012" /> <ref> http://www.charlescros.org/portail.php </ref> Also in the mid 60ies Kolbe performed quadrophonic recording system research with Benjamin B.

<!--- During his remote recording career in the years from 1955 to1975, Kolbe developed techniques for carrying the large, vacuum-tube recording equipment of the 50s and 60s across borders, for making suitable recording venues in ancient cathedrals, and for dealing with bureaucracy at all levels. When a space was too reverberant, he filled church pews with nuns or choristers [2]. --->

== Back to Switzerland ==

In 1957 Kolbe returned to Switzerland and in 1960 founded the <U+201C>Phonag<U+201D> Record Company in [[Winterthur]], with the label <U+201C>Helvetia<U+201D><ref name = "Lamy documents"> Lamy documents (several dates) </ref> (used mainly for Swiss folklore records).
<!--- According to several sources [59], Mastertone Records, Vienna, continued to exist after Kolbe<U+2019>s departure until ca. 1959, although it is not known who operated it. --->
In [[Switzerland]], Kolbe recorded on several locations, in [[Winterthur]] primarily at Kirchgemeindehaus <ref name = "Kolbe 2012" /> <ref> http://www.liebestrasse.ch/ </ref>, which had a room with very good acoustics. Since ca. 1962, his second engineer was Robert Lattmann who was taught on the job by Kolbe. At first, Kolbe only had fairly basic recording equipment at his disposal <ref> Deduced from a photo showing Kolbe using three small portable microphone mixers without equalizers etc., dual meters and a ReVox tape recorder. Picture courtesy Ursula Kolbe. </ref> but in April 1966 he purchased a portable 3-channel tube mixing console, designed and manufactured by Hans Leonhard (Leonhard Electronics in Z<U+00FC>rich). This console, which had switchable equalizers co-designed by Kolbe, was used in his studios in [[Switzerland]] ([[Winterthur]] and Lindau <ref> http://www.lindau.ch/de/ German only </ref>) and on most on-location recordings for CBS/Phonag elsewhere.

On 29 June 1970, Kolbe on behalf of Phonag records AG, rented rooms in a hotel/restaurant building at Lindau <ref> http://www.lindau.ch/de/ German only </ref>, canton [[Z<U+00FC>rich]], [[Switzerland]], and built a recording studio there which existed until it was sold. The studio measured 11.5 by 14 meter and was 2 stories high (4-5 meter) and included a small stage used as storage area. The technical facilities were in a control room with double-glass window to the studio. Kolbe<U+2019>s first recording console was the modular portable Leonhard valve mixing desk already described, and he used [[Tannoy]] integrated concentric coaxial speakers and Studer <ref> http://www.studer.ch/ </ref> tape recorders. This valve desk was used on probably all his recording sessions, both in [[Winterthur]] and in Lindau, as well as on location during travel. In 1975, the studio was upgraded to a 16 track transistorized MCI <ref> [[Music Center Incorporated]] </ref> desk, and Studer A80 8-16 track recorders in addition to the Studer 2- and 4-tracks. <ref name = "Lamy documents" /> Between 1972 and 1975 Jimmy Duncombe <ref> http://www.duncombe.ch/ </ref>, later co-founder of Powerplay recording studio <ref> http://www.powerplaystudio.ch/ </ref> in Maur <ref> www.maur.ch/ </ref>, [[Switzerland]], was employed in the studio as studio manager and recording engineer. Duncombe, a musician, learnt recording studio craftsmanship under the auspices of Hellmuth Kolbe at that time.

The following two examples hint at Kolbes versatility and proficiency in two vastly different musical styles: In 1968 he was a listed member of the <U+201C>[[Krautrock]]<U+201D> band <U+201C>[[Brainticket]]<U+201D> (see insert below) and was playing keyboards, potentiometers, generators, and sound effects, together with performing more technical duties as producer, engineer, electronics, supervisor and <U+201C>generator<U+201D>. <ref> http://psychedelicobscurities.blogspot.ch/2008/01/brainticket-1971-cottonwoodhill.html </ref> The book <U+201C>Jazz in der Schweiz<U+201D> (<U+201C>Jazz in Switzerland<U+201D>) <ref name = "Sp<U+00F6>rri 2005"> Spoerri, Bruno (Hg.), Jazz in der Schweiz. Geschichte und Geschichten, Z<U+00FC>rich 2005, S. 153 f. </ref> explicitly honors Kolbe and his work for <U+201E>[[Brainticket]]<U+201D> as <U+201C>way ahead of its time<U+201C>, and Kolbe himself is reported as a <U+201C>good Jazz pianist<U+201D>, performing under the name Hello Kamm.

{{Border| <U+201C>[[Brainticket]]<U+201D> originally formed in 1968, consisted of members of [[Belgian]], [[Swiss]], [[Scottish]], and [[German]] descent. Although members came and went during their tenure, the most popular lineup consisted of the Belgian Joel Vandroogenbroeck <ref> [[:de:Jo%C3%ABl_Vandroogenbroeck]] </ref> (organ, flute), Ron Bryer (guitar), Werni Fr<U+00F6>hlich (bass), Cosimo Lampis (drums), Wolfgang Paap (tabla), Dawn Muir (vocals), Carole Muriel (vocals, zither), and Hellmuth Kolbe (keyboards, potentiometers, generators, and sound effects). Technical staff: Hellmuth Kolbe, producer, engineer, electronics, supervisor, generator. Kolbe probably contributed considerably to <U+201C>[[Brainticket]]<U+2019>s<U+201D> album <U+201C>[[Cottonwoodhill]]<U+201D> (released 1971) and made use of his experiences in radio broadcasting and electronic music. <U+201C>[[Cottonwoodhill]]<U+201D> is the debut album by <U+201C>[[Brainticket]]<U+201D> and is generally acknowledged as one of the more obscure <U+201C>[[Krautrock]]<U+201D> classics. It features the groove-based track "Black Sand", featuring Dawn Muir singing into a spring reverb unit. The LP's original inner sleeve warns: "After Listening to this Record, your friends may not know you anymore" and "Only listen to this once a day. Your brain might be destroyed<U+201D>. On this debut album, the group sat out to document an LSD trip as the Grateful Dead did on <U+201C>[[Anthem of the Sun]]<U+201D> and as [[Ash Ra Tempel]] would later do on <U+201C>Seven Up<U+201D> (1972). <ref> http://psychedelicobscurities.blogspot.ch/2008/01/brainticket-1971-cottonwoodhill.html </ref> For album cover consult http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fb/Brainticket.jpg

The second example is from 1973: Kolbe recorded the [[Schubert]] Piano Trios, in D-Minor, Op. 63, at the Victoria Hall in Geneva<ref> http://www.ville-ge.ch/culture/victoria_hall/ </ref>, [[Switzerland]]. Musicians were [[Arthur Rubinstein]] (piano), [[Henryk Szeryng]] (violin) and [[Pierre Fournier]] (cello). Kolbe was recording in quad-technology, but the final discs were released in 1974 in stereo on [[RCA]]<U+2019>s prestigious Red Seal label. <ref> [[RCA Red Seal Records]] </ref> For this recording, [[RCA]] had sent an engineer from [[America]] who arrived late and finally sat at the desk together with Kolbe. As usual, Kolbe had set-up the microphones, marked errors, insecurities and takes in the musical score lying in front of him and talked with the musicians about corrections and improvements. <ref> Authors own recollections from these recording sessions in Geneva </ref>

At the Lindau recording studio the two engineers/producers, Kolbe and Lattmann, were primarily booked by record companies, producers and musicians located in or around [[Switzerland]] and in particular performed many recordings for the Swiss [http://www.exlibris.ch/de/ Ex Libris], Helvetia.<ref> http://www.discogs.com/label/Helvetia </ref> and [http://www.turicaphon.ch/labels.cfm Turicaphon/Elite Special] labels. The rental contract between [http://www.phonag.ch/site/home.aspx Phonag AG] and the restaurant/hotel was terminated by 30 September 1980 and engineer Robert Lattmann entered into a new contract with the hotel as owner of the studio <ref name = "Rental contract 1980">  Rental contracts between Robert Lattmann and Arthur Lamy in Lamy documents </ref>. On 30 September 1990 this contract was extended for another five years <ref name = "Rental contract 1980" />. By 1980 Kolbe placed his focus exceedingly on his [[acoustics]] career, but was still working part-time at the studio in Lindau. According to a brochure of ca. 1980, the studio then offered 2/4/8/16 track facilities with Studer A80 as master recorder, the 16 track MCI <ref> [[Music Center Incorporated]] </ref> desk, and additional [[JBL]] loudspeakers <ref name = "Rental contract 1980" />

Throughout his lifetime Kolbe was open to new technologies and ideas and for example experimented with pressure zone microphones.<ref> [[Boundary microphone]] </ref> at a live performance with conductor [[Leonard Bernstein]] and the [[Orchestre National de France]] in 1975 to record [[Berlioz]]<U+2019>s Requiem <ref name = "Kolbe Main Acoustic Activities" />

== Acoustics career ==

In January 1973 [[Switzerland]] left the previously established [[Bretton Woods system]] (1944-1973) and adopted a floating currency system which considerably strengthened the [[Swiss franc]] in comparison to the since 1945 constantly declining [[US-Dollar]]. Kolbe was affected by this trend <ref> The author is thankful to Mr. Christian Kolbe who hinted at this important aspect for his father to look for alternatives to his career as recording engineer and producer </ref> and it certainly forced him to think of alternatives to his status as representative of the European residence of [[CBS]]. Already since 1970, Kolbe did acoustic consulting and designed recording studios, control rooms concert halls, theaters and multi-purpose halls etc. <ref name = "Kolbe Main Acoustic Activities" /> He primarily performed acoustics consultancy work, for instance in the early 1970ies with the Leonhard Electronics Company, to plan and construct an auditorium for [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Hoffman-La Roche Ltd.]], and another for the [[Bank for International Settlements]], both located in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. <ref name = "Leonhard References"> Leonhard References </ref> Kolbe in a 1987 interview <ref name = "Nelson 1987" />: <U+201C>By the time the 70<U+2019>s came around I was getting tired of living out of a suitcase and I wanted to spend more time with my family. In a way, everything came together: operas were starting to be recorded on 24 tracks and at this stage I felt that the technology was moving in and the music moving out! Also there was a general slump for classics so I was able to cut down on recording and move back to my first studies, which was acoustics. After all, I had recorded in the best <U+2013> and the worst <U+2013> halls in the world and had amassed considerable experience. Whenever I was able to, I measured the halls and began to compile a file on hall acoustics.<U+201D>

The introduction of the [[compact disc]] in 1982 caused Kolbe to change careers definitely. He believed the format had been rushed into production with <U+201C>not enough bits<U+201D> for his ears. <ref> The most crucial parts determining audio quality, the analog-to-digital converters, were still under development until the end of the 90ies and in 1982 did reach 14 bit resolution at best, equivalent to a signal-to-noise ratio of 80 to 84 db (see online URL http://www.whathifi.com/blog/the-cd-is-30-years-old-today) </ref> Although he continued to contribute to occasional recording projects, from then on his interests laid elsewhere. He studied acoustics and control room design and was soon designing studios, concert halls, churches, etc. <ref name = "Nelson 1987" />

Kolbe in a 1987 interview <ref name = "Nelson 1987" />: <U+201C>I started a consultancy service for concert halls, theaters, industrial buildings, domestic, etc. that dealt with all aspects of acoustics such as reverberation, isolation, and so on. I am convinced that in order for anyone to be an acoustics engineer in a musical environment, he has to be a musician. You have to understand the sort of environment that musicians require in a studio, control room or concert hall. Most of us have come across situations in theatres or halls where the orchestra can either hear everybody or each musician is straining to hear his neighbor just to stay in tune. It is the same situation with console manufacturers <U+2013> the best builders are also users because they know what is required out in the real world.<U+201D>

According to his own account, Kolbe was the first TDS/TEF (Time Delay Spectrometry/Time-Energy-Frequency) <ref> http://mixonline.com/TECnology-Hall-of-Fame/time-delay-spectrometry-090106/ </ref> user in Europe in 1980/81. <ref name = "Kolbe Main Acoustic Activities" /> For this, Hellmuth Kolbe had to study TDS, invented by Richard C. Heyser <ref> http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/jaes.obit/JAES_V35_5_PG413.pdf </ref> (1931-1987) and first published in the [[Journal of the Audio Engineering Society]] (JAES) 1976 issue. For Kolbe it was largely learning by listening, adjusting and doing.

[[File:P Kolbe-14 TEF-equipment 01.jpg|600 px|thumb|left|Hellmuth Kolbe and Hans Leonhard at the Ratsaal (parliament room) in [[Zug]], [[Switzerland]], in ca. 1980, with Kolbe<U+2019>s early TDS/TEF measuring equipment, performing acoustics measurements. Picture courtesy Hans Leonhard.]]

Kolbe in his 1987 Interview <ref name = "Nelson 1987" />: <U+201C>The development of TDS by the late Richard C. Heyser is, in my opinion, one of the greatest steps forward in acoustics since the work by [Wallace Clement] [[Wallace Clement Sabine|Sabine]](1968-1919). One of the important aspects of it is that you can now prove to a client that what you are doing actually works. Before, he [the client] had to take your word for it.  We are involved in studio construction all over the world and anywhere it is rare to be able to build a studio from the ground up <U+2013> but that<U+2019>s the challenge! For me the most important thing is to make the control room as big as possible <U+2013> you need space in order to be able to have an uncolored sound. With today<U+2019>s recoding techniques most of the music is done in the control room which means that you need space both for the instruments and the sound.<U+201D>

Since 1985, Kolbe performed research work on scale-model acoustic measurements (with TDS) and stage-acoustics <ref name = "Kolbe Main Acoustic Activities" /> and in 1986/1987 was involved in the development of the first head-related ear-recording system for acoustic measurement and recording purposes (a Syn-Aud-Con Tech <ref> http://www.synaudcon.com/site/ </ref> topic). Kolbe formed many long lasting friendships at Don and Carolyn Davis<U+2019>s Synergetic Audio Concepts (SynAudCon) <ref> http://www.synaudcon.com/site/ </ref> workshops where he heard lecturers such as Gerald Stanley <ref> http://www.crownaudio.com/press/pr251/ </ref>, Eugene Patronis <ref> https://www.physics.gatech.edu/user/eugene-t-patronis </ref>, Chips Davis <ref> http://www.chips-davis.com/ </ref>, and Richard C. Heyser <ref> http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/jaes.obit/JAES_V35_5_PG413.pdf </ref> (all of whom consider him their equal), and lectures at several of those workshops himself. <ref name = "Brown 2002" />

Kolbe in the 1987 interview <ref name = "Nelson 1987" />: <U+201C>Design criteria are always on the move and I have modified the LEDE concept [Live End-Dead End studio control room technique] to include the Reflection Free Zone (RFZ) <ref> http://realtraps.com/rfz.htm </ref> manner of design. This gives the most uncolored sound possible in a given situation and provides a natural sound that can be the reference point. Of course, some of the original LEDE principles are still very valid such as the asymmetrical outer shell and completely symmetrical inner shell. The goal is to achieve as natural a sound as possible so that things such as equalization [EQ] can be used as an effect, rather than as an attempt to compensate for coloration and/or bad acoustics. The moment you have a neutral reference point I find that EQ settings tend to become less drastic and are often of the order of several dB or so. [<U+2026>] As a studio designer I feel it is my duty to provide a neutral reference point; you then need a good engineer with good ears <U+2013> and one who listens!<U+201D>

Hellmuth Kolbe pioneered the use of quadratic residue diffusors [Manfred R. Schroeder, <ref> http://ease.afmg.eu/ </ref>], designed and built custom units into recording studios and concert halls. One innovative design used a low-frequency diffusor to control room modes in a tiny control room in [[Lucerne]], while another design turned a multipurpose space in [[Cham, Switzerland|Cham]] [[Switzerland]] into a fine concert hall (and provided excellent noise isolation in the process). <ref name = "Brown 2002" /> Kolbe in his 1987 interview <ref name = "Nelson 1987" />: <U+201C>You need mass to properly control the bass<U+201D>.

Since ca. 1990, Kolbe used scale models to test his designs and documented their performance with TDS. Later, he adopted Ahnert and Feistel<U+2019>s EASE (Enhanced Acoustic Simulator for Engineers), an industry standard for 3D electro-acoustic and room-acoustic modeling <ref> http://www.bksv.com/doc/BO0014.pdf </ref> as a modeling and auralization <ref> Auralization: An audio engineering discipline to assess the discrepancy between what the present playback methods deliver and what the human ear pinnae expect and require. Auralization is the process of generating or regenerating an imaginary or an existing acoustic sound field of an audible source in a defined space by mathematical modeling or direct recording and then making this field audible in such a way as to duplicate the binaural listening experience a listener would have had at a specific location in that original space. See article by Glasgal, Ralph, The Ear Pinna and Realism in Music Reproduction, The Stereo Times Magazine, April 1999, URL http://www.stereotimes.com/comm0499.shtml </ref> tool. Hellmuth Kolbe has always been very supportive of others who shared his enthusiasm for advancing the state of the art in audio, including Wolfgang Ahnert <ref> http://www.ada-amc.eu/218 </ref>, Sam Berkow <ref> http://siaacoustics.com/whoweare/ </ref>, Peter D<U+2019>Antonio <ref> http://mixonline.com/design/profiles/mix_interview_dr_peter_dantonio/ </ref>, Don and Carolyn Davis <ref> http://www.synaudcon.com/site/about/don-carolyn/ </ref>, Chips Davis <ref> http://www.chips-davis.com/ </ref>, Markus Erne <ref> http://ch.linkedin.com/pub/markus-erne/4a/4bb/596 </ref>, Kurt Graffy <ref> http://www.arup.com/About_us/A_people_business/People/Kurt_Graffy.aspx </ref>, Dirk Noy <ref> http://www.wsdg.com/dynamic.asp?id=company/team/europe/dirknoy </ref>, Ken Wahrenbrock <ref> http://www.crownaudio.com/kb/entry/302/ </ref>, and Jim Brown <ref> http://www.audiosystemsgroup.com/ </ref>. <ref name = "Brown 2002" />

On 15 July 2002, Hellmuth Kolbe died in [[Z<U+00FC>rich]], [[Switzerland]], at the age of 75 and posthumous, in 2005, he received the Richard C. Heyser TEF Award <U+201C>for his revolutionary work in the use of TDS in room acoustics and recording<U+201D>.<ref name = "Brown 2002" />

== More personal remarks ==

In 1960, Hellmuth Kolbe met Ursula Plischke-Delabro in [[Vienna]], where she was working in a recording studio, and they got married in 1966.
<!--- They got married in 1966, and had two children. An earlier marriage ended in divorce, and both his first wife and son from that marriage are deceased. [2] --->
Hellmuth Kolbe, in addition to classical music, loved jazz, especially the music of [[Lennie Tristano|Lennie Tristano]] (1919-1978). He had perfect pitch and arranged music, particularly for jazz combos. Acoustics designer Sam Berkow, founder of SIA Acoustics LLC<ref> http://siaacoustics.com/whoweare/ </ref>, tells of an informal excursion where Hellmuth picked out the individual frequencies of multi-note train horns, and many of his colleagues tell of finding it difficult to listen to some recordings, systems, or halls after Hellmuth pointed out their subtle faults. During a recording session, he would make extensive notes on the musical performance, including the mistakes; this speeded up editing the tapes. He was fluent in reading the most complex musical scores and always prepared himself carefully for a pending recording session. <ref name = "Kolbe 2012" />
<!--- Once, an orchestra performing the first of a <U+201C>vanity<U+201D> series of recordings of Mozart piano concerti rebelled at the poor conducting skills of a wealthy patron who had commissioned the sessions and had hired Kolbe to record them. <U+201C>Hellmuth,<U+201D> said a member the orchestra, <U+201C>either you conduct the rest of the series or we quit.<U+201D> He did, and completed the project [2].
Vacations were invariably spent skiing and mountaineering, occasionally by helicopter, and even at age 75. Visitors to his home in the 1980s were treated to a model train layout that ran both through his home (including tunnels built into walls) and through his garden [2]. His trips to the U.S. were punctuated by visits to jazz clubs and restaurants where he could enjoy spicy food from places such as Korea, Thailand, and China [2]. --->
Hellmuth Kolbe was modest to a fault, rarely speaking of his accomplishments unless prodded to do so. Don Davis wrote, <U+201C>We never knew him to ever be less than exact and his word on a matter was gold. [[Diogenes]], the man with the lantern searching the world for an honest man, would have stopped with Hellmuth had he met him.<U+201D> <ref name = "Brown 2002" />
