== Life and career ==
Cholodenko grew up in a [[Jewish]] family (immigrants from [[Ukraine]]), in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. She got her start in the film industry in New York in the early 1990s.<ref name = filmjournal>{{cite news | last = Toumarkine  | first = Doris | url = http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/movies/e3iee6a0d1f3ba0fce7e981ab1df6fc91f1 | title = Family dynamic: Lisa Cholodenko explores modern parenthood in 'The Kids Are All Right' | date = June 28, 2010 | work = [[Film Journal International]] | accessdate = June 29, 2010}}</ref> She landed positions as assistant editor on ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' and ''[[Used People]]''. She then enrolled at [[Columbia University School of the Arts]], earning an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in screenwriting and directing, where ''[[James Schamus]] ''was one of her professors at Columbia, who would later become the CEO of [[Focus Features]].<ref name = THR>http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/video/video-awards-watch-roundtable-directors-full-video-61705</ref>

===Film===
After writing and directing several acclaimed short films including ''Dinner Party'', Cholodenko made her feature film debut with ''[[High Art]]''. ''High Art'' won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] as well as the National Society of Film Critics award for [[Ally Sheedy]]'s performance.  Both ''High Art'' and her next film, ''[[Laurel Canyon (film)|Laurel Canyon]]'', premiered at Cannes [[Director's Fortnight]].  

After completing ''[[Laurel Canyon]]'', Cholodenko decided to move to LA permanently.  While in the process of trying to conceive a child via anonymous sperm donor, she met with screenwriter Stuart Blumberg, who was a sperm donor in college.<ref>http://www.avclub.com/articles/lisa-cholodenko,42786/</ref> Together, they decided to write a screenplay, which would eventually become ''[[The Kids Are All Right (film)|The Kids Are All Right]]''.  However, the project took five years to get to production.  Filmed in 23 days, Cholodenko directed the film on a 3 million dollar budget, a much smaller amount than her fellow 2011 Oscar nominees.<ref name = THR/>  ''The Kids Are All Right'' garnered an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] nomination, a [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay]] nomination, and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay]] nomination. The film won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture <U+2013> Musical or Comedy]]. The film was also named best screenplay by the New York Film Critics Circle and won the Independent Spirit Award for best screenplay.

In 2010, she was awarded the [[Women in Film Los Angeles|Women in Film]] [[Women_in_Film_Crystal_+_Lucy_Awards#THE_DOROTHY_ARZNER_DIRECTORS_AWARD|Dorothy Arzner Directors Award]].<ref>http://wif.org/past-recipients</ref>

===Television===
Cholodenko has also worked in television, with her adaptation of the novel ''[[Cavedweller]]'' for Showtime earning [[Independent Spirit Award]] nominations for [[Kyra Sedgwick]] and [[Aidan Quinn]]. She also directed episodes of ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[The L Word]]'' and "[[Hung]]."

==Themes==
Cholodenko has written all of three of her films, and there are some thematic similarities as a result.  Each of them are psychological character studies, revolving around a small cast of characters, and as the films progress the audience observes how the characters interact amongst each other.  Her films address the fluidity of human sexuality and desire, and Cholodenko's work has helped give the [[LGBTQ]] community visibility in mainstream culture.

==Directorial style==
[[Mark Ruffalo]] describes how working with Cholodenko was quite rewarding. <blockquote>It takes a special kind of director to trust an actor, and to open themselves up to having an actor bring something that maybe wasn't what they saw or thought. Lisa is a rare director that knows actors, by the time you've finished your first week of shooting, probably know the characters better than the writer or the director. She creates a safe environment, and she casts well. She knows what to bring out of people.

Because of that, you feel free to move and live between the lines. She lingers on a scene. She loves behavior. She's not afraid to explore. You're not getting, "Well, the line is actually... I really just want you to say the line like it is." It's not that formal. You get a chance to stretch yourself out. That's a fun way of working.<ref>http://www.ifc.com/news/2010/07/mark-ruffalo-is-doing-all-righ.php</ref></blockquote>

==Controversy==
Though ''[[The Kids Are All Right (film)|The Kids Are All Right]]'' was generally applauded by critics and audiences alike, the film received differing opinions from the [[LGBTQ]] community, particularly for the plot device of a homosexual woman engaging in a heterosexual extra-marital affair.  Some saw this as a trope used in mainstream Hollywood, citing films like ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]'' and ''[[Chasing Amy]]''.  However, many others defended Cholodenko's artistic choice, and found her approach realistic and well-handled.<ref>http://www.afterellen.com/movies/2010/sugarbutch-says-the-kids-are-all-right?page=0%2C1</ref>
