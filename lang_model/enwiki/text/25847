==Playing career==

===Club===

Kenny played his club [[hurling]] with his local [[Borrisoleigh GAA|Borrisoleigh]] club and enjoyed much success.  He won three senior [[Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship|county titles]] with the club in [[1949]], [[1950]] and [[1953]].

===Inter-county===

Kenny first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] minor hurling team in the mid-1940s.  He won a [[Munster Minor Hurling Championship|Munster]] medal in this grade in [[1945]], however, Tipp later lost the All-Ireland final to [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]].  In [[1946]] Kenny won a second Munster minor title, however, Dublin overcame Tipp in the championship decider for a second consecutive year.  In [[1947]] Kenny was captain of the Tipperary minor team.  That year he captured his third consecutive Munster medal before later leading his team out in [[Croke Park]] for the championship decider.  [[Galway GAA|Galway]] provided the opposition on that occasion, however, it was Tipp who won the game, giving Kenny a coveted [[All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]] minor medal.

Kenny later joined the Tipperary senior team.  He won his first [[Munster Senior Hurling Championship|Munster]] senior medal after coming on as a substitute in Tipp<U+2019>s [[1949]] provincial final victory over [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]].  Kenny later lined out in his first championship decider at [[Croke Park]] where [[Laois GAA|Laois]], the surprise winners of the Leinster championship, provided the opposition.  The game turned into a rout as Tipp trounced Laois on a score line of 3-11 to 0-3 giving Kenny his first senior [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]] medal.  In [[1950]] Kenny added a [[National Hurling League]] title to his collection before winning a second Munster title following a victory over arch-rivals [[Cork GAA|Cork]].  This victory allowed Tipp to advance to the All-Ireland final where [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] were the opponents.  It was Tipp, however, who won a close and uninteresting final on a score line of 1-9 to 1-8 giving Kenny his second All-Ireland medal.  [[1951]] saw Tipp aim to capture a third championship in-a-row.  The year began well with the Premier County getting the better of Cork in the Munster final.  That victory gave Kenny his third provincial title and allowed Tipp to play in their third consecutive championship decider.  [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] took on Tipp in that game, however, victory went to the Munstermen on a score line of 7-7 to 3-9.  Kenny had captured his third consecutive All-Ireland medal.  With the three-in-a-row under their belt the men from Tipperary launched an all out bid to capture a fourth championship in-a-row.  Things started well in [[1952]] with Kenny winning a second National League title.  Tipperary, however, were later beaten by Cork in a thrilling Munster final.  In [[1954]] Kenny won a third National League medal, however, Cork went on to defeat Tipp in a third consecutive Munster final.  Three years later in [[1957]] he won a fourth National League medal before retiring from inter-county activity following Tipp<U+2019>s exit fro the championship.

===Provincial===

Kenny also lined out with [[Munster GAA|Munster]] in the inter-provincial hurling championship.  He won four [[Railway Cup]] titles in 1951, 1952, [[1953]] and 1957.
