"Like Father, Like Clown" was written by the duo of [[Jay Kogen]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]].

The episode was carefully researched and two rabbis, Lavi Meier and [[Harold M. Schulweis]], were credited as "special technical consultants". It was co-directed by [[Jeffrey Lynch]] and [[Brad Bird]]; as it was Lynch's first credit as a director,  Bird was assigned to help him. Comedian [[Jackie Mason]], who had once been an ordained rabbi, provided the voice of Rabbi Krustofski. The rabbi later became an infrequently recurring character voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]. Mason later returned to voice the character in "[[Today I Am a Clown]]" in [[The Simpsons (season 15)|the fifteenth season]].

==Plot==
Although [[Krusty the Clown]] agrees to have dinner with the Simpson family as part of his repayment for [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s help in exonerating him in the episode "[[Krusty Gets Busted]]", Krusty keeps putting it off, much to Bart's disappointment. An upset Bart writes a letter to Krusty saying he is no longer his fan.  Krusty's secretary is so moved by the letter that she tells Krusty she will quit her job if he does not keep his promise to Bart. This persuades Krusty to have dinner at the Simpson house. When asked to say grace, he recites a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Berakhah|blessing]]. Realizing that Krusty is [[Judaism|Jewish]], Lisa speaks of his heritage, making Krusty cry. He tells the family his real name, Herschel Krustofski, and describes his upbringing in the Lower East Side of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. 

His father, [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Rabbi Hyman Krustofski|Hyman Krustofski]], was a rabbi and strongly opposed young Herschel's wish to become a [[clown]]; he wanted the boy to go to ''[[yeshiva]]'' instead. Krusty did attend the school, where he said he made the other students laugh by acting like his father. As a result, Krusty became a  [[slapstick]] comedian behind his father's back. One night, Krusty performed at a rabbi's convention and a rabbi squirted [[seltzer]] on him, washing off his clown makeup. Rabbi Krustofski, who was in the audience, was furious and disowned his son, and now it has been 25 years since they have seen or spoken to each other. 

In the weeks following this admission, Krusty thinks about his father and becomes depressed, breaking down on live television. Bart and Lisa decide to help reunite father and son, but the rabbi still refuses to accept Krusty's career choice, explaining that Krusty "turned his back on his traditions on his faith and on me". They decide to try to out-smart the rabbi. Lisa does research and finds [[Judaic]] teachings that urge forgiveness, but Rabbi Krustofski has answers for each of them. Finally, Bart  convinces the rabbi to reconcile with a quote from [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], a Jewish entertainer like Krusty, which finally convinces Rabbi Krustofski of his foolishness. A deeply depressed Krusty is glumly doing a live taping of his show, when Rabbi Krustofski appears. The two joyously hug and reconcile in front of the audience of children.

The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode, "a magnificent show, with Jackie Mason wonderfully over the top as Krusty's long-lost pa, and Lois Penny-candy giving Krusty a good talking to about Bart."<ref name="bbc"/> Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' listed "Like Father, Like Clown" as one of the ten episodes of ''The Simpsons'' that shows the "comic and emotional scope of the show."

The episode has become study material for sociology courses at [[University of California Berkeley]], where it is used to "examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show", and to figure out what it is "trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies." Some questions asked in the courses include: "What aspects of American society are being addressed in the episode? What aspects of them are used to make the points? How is the satire conveyed: through language? Drawing? Music? Is the behavior of each character consistent with his/her character as developed over the years? Can we identify elements of the historical/political context that the writers are satirizing? What is the difference between satire and parody?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/undergrads/syllabi/Soc190_1.pdf|publisher=University of California Berkeley|title=The Simpsons Global Mirror |year=2008|author=Thomas B.
