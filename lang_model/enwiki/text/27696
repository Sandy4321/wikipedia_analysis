'''''Monsters, Inc.''''' is the fourth [[animated feature]] produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]]. The film was released to theaters by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in the [[United States]] on [[November 2]] [[2001]], in [[Australia]] on [[December 26]], [[2001]] and in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[February 8]], [[2002]]. 

Bearing many similarities to the 1989 film ''[[Little Monsters]]'', the story for ''Monsters, Inc.'' was written by Robert L. Baird, Jill Culton, [[Peter Docter]], Ralph Eggleston, Dan Gerson, Jeff Pidgeon, Rhett Reese, [[Jonathan Roberts (writer)|Jonathan Roberts]] and [[Andrew Stanton]]. It was directed by [[Peter Docter]], [[Lee Unkrich]] and [[David Silverman]].

''Monsters, Inc.'' premiered in the United States on [[October 28]], [[2001]], and went into general release on [[November 2]], [[2001]] with the best opening ticket sales ever for an animated film and the sixth best of all time. 

==Plot==
The story is set in Monstropolis, a city inhabited by [[monsters]], some of whom are the ones who emerge from bedroom closets to scare children. This is used to collect the screams of kids, which power the city. The main power company in the city is called Monsters, Inc. The [[Chairman]] and [[Chief Executive Officer]] is a crab-like monster called [[Henry J. Waternoose]] (voiced by  the late [[James Coburn]]). 
The top scarer at Monsters, Inc. is [[James P. Sullivan]], aka "Sulley" (voiced by [[John Goodman]]), a blue-furred [[bear]]/[[gorilla]]like giant who is partnered with the green, one-eyed [[Mike Wazowski]] ([[Billy Crystal]]). Many of Sulley's physical traits closely resemble those of the [[Beast]] in Disney's hugely successful animated feature [[Beauty and the Beast]], such as small curved horns, long fur, a catlike nose, clawed paws, and a jutting lower lip{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. The two of them are best friends. Sulley is a gentle and easy-going creature, while Mike is obsessive and dreams of getting a raise and marrying his girlfriend, the [[medusa]]-like [[Celia Mae]] ([[Jennifer Tilly]].) Sulley's main rival as a scarer is the [[chameleon]]-like [[Randall Boggs]] ([[Steve Buscemi]]) who possesses the ability to change the color of his skin to match his surroundings. 

As the two train and head off to work, their discussion reveals that the city is suffering a scream shortage because children have become desensitised to fear by an over-exposure to television. After they arrive at Monsters, Inc. workfloor we are shown that monsters can call up and travel through any child's door, thus being able to sneak in to bedrooms around the world and collect screams.

In order to allow Mike to take out his girlfriend, Sulley agrees to turn in his paperwork. He finds a lone door on the workfloor, a violation of policy.  An investigation leads to a small girl coming through.  Sulley is frightened as it is believed all children are toxic to monsters (part of the skill involved in being a good "scarer" is in avoiding being touched). After several misadventures, he attempts to take the girl to Mike, who is enjoying a romantic dinner with his girlfriend at a sushi restaurant. The girl escapes, causes the alarm to be raised, and the two grab her and barely make it home.

The girl stays overnight and is soon named Boo. The two come to know she is not dangerous, as once thought, but they still plan to return her the next day.  She is disguised as a monster and they sneak her inside.  Mike wants to toss her in any old door, but Sulley wants to return her to her home. 

A mistake gets Mike kidnapped by Randall, who had intended to take Boo.  It is learned Randall has created a machine to extract screams straight from kidnapped kids.  Sulley and Mike tell everything to Waternoose.  However, it turns out that Waternoose is in on Randalls scheme.  Because of the decline in productivity, he fears for the company's future, and sees Randalls machine as the only way of ensuring Monsters Inc's survival.  Waternoose betrays them, banishing the two to the Himalayas. 

The two stay with the [[Abominable Snowman]] until Sulley learns of a village down below. After an argument with Mike, he sneaks back to his world that way.

Mike soon follows. They confront Randall and attempt to rescue Boo. In the end Mike and Sulley send Randall to a motor home in a [[Louisiana]] swamp, where he is beaten up by the family living inside (who mistake him for an alligator). Mike and Sulley destroy the door Randall went through, thus trapping him. 

Mike and Sulley trick Waternoose into exposing himself to the CDA, whose true leader is Roz, the scare floor secretary. Boo is sent home and her door is put through a grinder. 

Sulley comes to realize that laughter is more powerful than screams and the company is redefined. The monsters now enter the doors to entertain the kids as comedians, resulting in ample energy for the monster world. In secret, Mike also reassembles Boo's door. Sulley takes one more peek inside and Boo is heard but not seen.

==Awards==
*''Monsters, Inc.'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Song]] ([[Randy Newman]] for ''[[If I Didn't Have You]]''). It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], [[Academy Award for Sound|Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Best Music, Original Score]].
*This movie, along with ''[[Shrek]]'', is the first pair of CG animated movies to win an academy award of a different nomination of the same year (Monsters, Inc. for Best Song of 2001, and ''[[Shrek]]'' for Best Animated feature of 2001).

==References to other Pixar films==
* One of the backgrounds that Fungus pulls down for Randall in the first scaring scene is the wallpaper for Andy's room in [[Toy Story]].
*The first door that Needleman and Smitty shred has a Paul Bunyan poster in it; it is identical to the one in Sid's room in [[Toy Story]].
*At the very beginning of the film, there is a shot of a shelf in the mechanical child's bedroom. On the far left is the toy [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] that [[Buzz Lightyear]] rides on to prove to [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] that he can fly in a scene from ''[[Toy Story]]'', this aircraft also appears in [[Finding Nemo]] and [[Toy Story 2]]. 
*Some of the sets were previously used for [[Toy Story]] example: when Mike and Sulley come out of a straw house a cloud from toy story is visible in the sky. 
*In Harryhausen's, the wallpaper behind the octopus chef is a ''[[Finding Nemo]]''  wallpaper, making a debut appearance before the film is released.
*When Randall is jettisoned from Monstropolis, you can briefly see Nemo from ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' mounted on the wall as a fishing trophy.
*Randall is banished to the same motor home used in ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', and again includes the Pizza Planet truck from [[Toy Story]], also Sulley's body pattern was previously seen on a bug at the bug city in A Bug's Life.
*The scream heard by the first child that Sulley scares sounds just like the scream Dot emits when she falls off a cliff in [[A Bug's Life]].
*Near the film's ending, Boo excitedly shows Sulley her toys in her room, including Jessie from ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', Nemo from ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and the ball from ''[[Luxo Jr.]]''. 
*Vehicular versions of Mike, Sulley and the Abominable Snowman make cameo appearances during the ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' closing credits, in a drive-in movie.  Mike is an [[Isetta]], Sulley is a [[monster truck]] and Abominable is a [[snowplow]]. Boo is not shown, but is mentioned to be the "Boomobile".
*The names on the scream-totals board (with the exception of that of  Ricky Plesuski) are all Pixar employees' names.
*[[Lightning McQueen]] from ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' can be seen in Boo's room in two frames.
*Rex, the plastic dinosaur from [[Toy Story]] and [[Toy Story 2]], has a cameo appearance in the outtakes.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=June 2007}}
*Early in pre-production, ''Monsters, Inc.'' went by the code name '''Hidden City'''.  The Hidden City Cafe was a restaurant across the street from Pixar's original [[Point Richmond]] studio, and a popular hangout for Pixar staff.
*At the end of the credits, you can spot the sentence "No monsters were harmed in the making of this motion picture"
*[[Mary Gibbs]], the three-year-old daughter of writer Rob Gibbs, provided Boo's voice. They were unable to get her to sit still in the recording studio, so instead they followed her around with a boom-mic, and things she said while playing were cut into the movie.
*The restaurant Mike visits is named after stop-motion animator [[Ray Harryhausen]] and its logo and name are a play on the Fish and Chip franchise [[Harry Ramsdens]].
*The scene where Sulley fears Boo has been thrown in a garbage compressor is inspired by the [[1952]] [[Chuck Jones]] [[cartoon]] ''[[Feed the Kitty]]''.
*The garbage compressor (trash compactor) is labeled "XP-13". This is probably a reference to the low budget "chop-job" 1970 sci-fi horror film ''Horror of the Blood Monsters'', which carried the tag line: "You'll REALLY!! scream yourself into a state of shock!". In ''Horror of the Blood Monsters'' the space ship is named the "XP-13".
*Props seen earlier in the film make up the "scream extractor".
*The [[Abominable Snowman]] is based on the character "The Bumble" from the [[stop motion|stop-motion]] ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (television special)|Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer]]'' Christmas Special.
*When Mike enters the room of a child near the movie's ending, you can see early posters of [[Disneyland]] attractions and lands.
*In the scene where Boo is sitting on Sulley's bed refusing to sleep, she shows Sulley a picture of Randall. Very briefly, as she moves one of her other pictures to show Sulley the one of Randall, you can see that on one picture she has signed, "Mary," implying that Boo's real name is Mary.  The reason that the picture is signed "Mary" is because it was in fact a picture that Mary Gibbs, the voice of Boo, had drawn and was put into the film.
* Some speculate that this movie was inspired from the 1994 nickelodeon animated TV series ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]''.
* When Sulley asked about what kids live in the village when Sulley and Mike are banished, the Abominable Snowman says "Tough kids, sissy kids, kids who climb on rocks", which is a line from the 1980s commercial for Armour Hotdogs.
* [[Steve Buscemi]] also starred in ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'', another CGI Monster parody.
* There are a couple of easter eggs in the DVD of Monsters Inc. All of them are found in the Bonus Content DVD. One of them is found in the "Monsters Only" door. As soon as the door opens, you will see the character Celia talking on the phone. Press left on your remote and it will reveal a hidden easter egg in the eye of the Monsters Inc. Logo. It contains video clips that the actors just made without reason. Two easter eggs are found in the "Humans Only" room. Select the door labeled "Pixar", put your cursor on the Monsters, Inc. logo and press left on the remote, you will be treated to the first annual paper airplane flight contest held at Pixar Animation Studios. Another easter egg is in the production tour (Just keep pressing left at the menu with all the doors) and wait until it finishes (Or you can fast forward)and then the screen shows a number of doors that have hidden content in them, like a soundtrack for the short concept movie that you can find in the bonus features.
* This was the last film to include outtakes during the credits. As of [[Finding Nemo]], no outtakes are being seen.
* At one point, Sulley mentions ''Monstropolis's Most Wanted'', an obvious reference to ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''. An interesting note is that Sulley's real name, James P. Sullivan, is eerily similar to that of a [http://www.amw.com/captures/brief.cfm?id=24505 fugitive] the television show captured in 2002.

==Mistakes/Blips==
*Towards the end of the film, when Mike and Sulley meet the CDA "number 00001", several different CDA monsters have the same number, 00112 - the same texture had been used on several models to reduce modeling time.
*In the very first scene, in the kid's room simulator, one angle shows a floor mat with a ball and a toy train set on it. However, when the first monster falls down on the mat, the train is no longer there and in its place are the jacks he falls on. The soccer ball appears to move, too.
*In the international version of the video/DVD several instances of written English text have been replaced with universal symbols (see Alternate Versions). However on several occasions they switch back to the original appearance. For instance: The "Standby/Scare" sign in the factory, the "Contamination alert" on the video wall during the first 2319 and the joke on the video wall in the final scene.
*Sulley makes Boo giggle a few times when they play hide and seek in the restroom, but the power never spikes and no lights blow out. (According to the commentary on the DVD, the creators realized this but chose not to address it.)
*When Sulley is playing hide and seek with Boo in the men's bathroom, Sulley walks into the stall where he thinks that she is. When Sulley turns around to see her outside of the stall, we see Boo and Boo's reflection in the mirror, but not Sulley's reflection. All that the camera sees is an empty stall and toilet... minus Sulley.
*In the opening scene when the monster comes through the door, he closes the door most of the way, but when the instructor does a review of what the student did wrong, the door is left mostly open.
*The scoreboard on the video wall sometimes shows decreased values for some monsters, for instance when Waternoose talks to Jerry and just before the first 2319.
*When in the ice cave, Mike picks up the last snow cone. As he first picks it up the snow is yellow, then it goes white and then back to yellow.
*When Mike walks away after congratulating Celia (in the beginning of the film) he passes a marking in the floor. In the next shot, viewed from above, he is much nearer her than in the shot before, which can be seen by the floor markings.
*When the C.D.A are scanning Monsters, Inc., a co-scarer opens the door that doesn't seem to be there but are there when Mike and Sulley open the door.
*When Mike is talking to Roz about his paper work, Mike's lip crosses through the counter at one point.
*When we see Mike wake up Sulley in the beginning, we see Sulley's alarm clock on his right-hand night stand, but later when Boo jumps into Sulley's bed the alarm clock is not there.
*When Sulley goes to put Boo back in her room, the clock above the door of the scare floor clearly indicates 5:50; when he runs out of the room it indicates 6:50.
*Mostly towards the end, we learn that laughing creates much more energy than screaming does. Near the end of the movie, while Sulley, Mike, and Boo are riding the doors, Boo screams, and starts to power up the door that they are riding. When Sulley and Mike make Boo laugh very short after, it powers up every door in the large room they are in, or at least what we see of them, implying that laughter is hundreds, if not thousands of times more powerful than screaming. Yet right before the ending, after Mike gloats about how funny he is, Sulley says that laughing is only 10 times more powerful than screaming.

==Spin-offs==
*A [[manga]] version of ''Monsters, Inc.'' was made by [[Hiromi Yamafuji]] and distributed in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Comic Bon Bon]]'' magazine in [[Japan]]; the manga is published in [[English language|English]] by [[TOKYOPOP]].
*[[Feld Entertainment]] currently tours a ''Monsters, Inc.'' edition of their ''[[Disney on Ice]]'' skating tour.
*A series of [[video games]], and a multi-platform video game were created, based on the movie.
*A short was made by Pixar in 2002 named ''[[Mike's New Car]]''.
*In [[Cars (film)|Cars]], there is a part at the end when Mack is watching a few movies.  One is called "Monster Trucks Inc."

==Theme park attractions==
Monsters, Inc. has inspired three attractions at [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks across the globe]].

* In [[2006]], [[Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue!]] opened at [[Disney's California Adventure]] at the [[Disneyland Resort]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. The dark ride was developed to boost the theme park's lagging attendance, and was quite successful in doing so, at least for a period of time.
* In [[2007]], [[Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor]] will open at the [[Magic Kingdom]] at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] in [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida]]. The exact logistics of the attraction are currently unknown, but it is expected that it is an interactive show based on a comedy club.<ref>[http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2006/2006_0607_disneywheredreams.html The Walt Disney Company - Press Release - 7 June 2006]</ref>
* In [[2009]], [[Monsters, Inc: Ride And Go Seek]] will open at [[Tokyo Disneyland]] at the [[Tokyo Disney Resort]] in [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], [[Japan]]. Following the format of the Californian dark ride, Ride and Go Seek will simply be an extended version with enhanced effects.

==Attached short films==
===For the Birds===
''Main article'': [[For the Birds]]

The theatrical and Video/DVD release of the film included ''For the Birds'', a Pixar short made in 2000 , a year before this film was released.

===Mike's New Car===
''Main article'': [[Mike's New Car]]

The Video/DVD release also includes an additional  short called ''Mike's New Car'', starring the  characters  from the film.

==Trailers==
One Pixar tradition is to create trailers for their films that do not contain footage from the released film.  Trailers for this film include:

*Sulley and Mike stumble into the wrong bedroom.
*In a preview shown before [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|the first Harry Potter film]], Sulley is shown playing [[charades]] with Mike, but Mike is unable to guess the phrase '[[Harry Potter]]'. The clip never specifically mentions Harry Potter, but the end states that ''Monsters, Inc.'' is playing right next door.
