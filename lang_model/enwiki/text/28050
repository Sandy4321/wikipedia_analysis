The '''bridge''' of a [[ship]] is an area or room from which the ship can be commanded. When a [[ship]] is underway the bridge is manned by an [[OOW]] ([[Officer of the watch]]) aided usually by an [[Able Seaman (rank)|AB]] ([[Able seaman]]) acting as lookout.  During critical manoeuvres the [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] will be on the bridge supported, perhaps, by an [[OOW]] as an extra set of hands, an [[Able Seaman (rank)|AB]] on the wheel and sometimes a [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] if required.

'''[[Wheelhouse]]s''' are the small enclosed parts of a bridge which historically held the ship's steering wheel. Today, ship bridges do not have a separate wheelhouse.

==Evolution==
Traditionally, [[sailing ship]]s were commanded from the [[quarter deck]], right aft. With the arrival of [[paddle steamer]]s, engineers required a platform from which they could inspect the paddle wheels and where the [[Captain (nautical)|captain]]'s view would not be obstructed by the paddle houses. A raised walkway, literally a bridge, connecting the paddle houses was therefore provided. When the [[screw propeller]] superseded the paddle wheel, the bridge was retained.

Traditionally, commands would be passed from the senior officer on the bridge to stations dispersed throughout the ship, where physical control of the ship was exercised, as technology did not exist for the remote control of e.g. steering or machinery. [[Helm]] orders would be passed to an enclosed '''wheel house''', where the [[coxswain]] or [[helmsman]] operated the [[ship's wheel]]. Engine commands would be relayed to the [[engineering department|engineer]] in the [[engine room]] by an [[engine order telegraph]], which displayed the captain's orders on a dial. The engineer would ensure that the correct combination of steam pressure and engine revolutions were applied. The bridge was often open to the elements, therefore a weatherproof [[pilot house]] could be provided, from where a [[harbour pilot|pilot]] (traditionally, the pilot was the ship's navigating officer) could issue commands from shelter.

Notice the [[binnacle]] in the prominent position centrally and the voice pipes for relaying commands. The armoured wheelhouse and the coxswain would be directly underneath. The Royal Navy favoured the open bridge for the unique tactical view it gave the Captain, long after other navies enclosed the bridge.]]

[[Iron]], and later [[steel]], ships also required a '''compass platform'''. This was usually a tower, where a [[magnetic compass]] could be sited as far away from the [[ferrous metal|ferrous]] interference from the hulk of the ship. Depending upon the design and layout of a ship, all of these terms can be variously interchangeable. Many ships still have a [[flying bridge]], a platform atop the pilot house, open to weather, containing a [[binnacle]] and voice tubes to allow the conning officer to direct the ship from a higher position during fair weather conditions.

Larger ships, particularly [[warship]]s, often had a number of different bridges. A '''navigation bridge''' would be used for the actual conning of the ship. A separate '''Admiral's bridge''' could be provided in [[flagship]]s, where the [[Admiral]] could exercise strategic control over his fleet without interfering with the Captain's tactical command of the vessel. In older warships, a heavily-armoured [[conning tower]] was often provided, where the vital command staff could be located under protection to ensure that the ship could be commanded and fought under fire.

Modern advances in remote control equipment has seen progressive transfer of the actual control of the ship to the bridge. The wheel and [[throttle]]s can be operated directly from the bridge, directly controlling often-unmanned machinery spaces. Aboard modern warships it is common that actual commanding is carried out on the bridge while weapon systems are controlled from a room usually deep inside the vessel. This also enables a redundant setup in which the vessel is still able to fight in case one of the command instances has been hit or destroyed.
