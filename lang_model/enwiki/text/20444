'''Blackrock''' ({{lang-ga|An Charraig Dhubh}}) is a suburban town and district located south of the city of [[Dublin]], in [[Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown]] County, [[Ireland]], {{km to mi | 3 | abbr=yes | precision=1 }} northwest of [[D<U+00FA>n Laoghaire]].

==Location and access==
It covers a large area, rising from sea level on the coast to {{convert|90|m|ft}} at ''White's Cross'' on the [[N11 road (Ireland)|N11 national primary road]]. Blackrock is bordered by [[Booterstown]], [[Mount Merrion]], [[Stillorgan]], [[Deansgrange]] and [[Monkstown,_County_Dublin|Monkstown]]. The town has a range of industries, notably in the IT and service areas.

===Transport===
* Blackrock has a station on the [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) line, which is 15 minutes away from the city centre. The DART runs on the same track that was built in 1834 for the [[Dublin and Kingstown Railway|Dublin-Kingstown railway]]. 
[[Blackrock railway station]] opened on 17 December 1834.<ref>{{cite web | title=Blackrock station | work=Railscot - Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref> 
* [[Dublin Bus]] also serves the area with multiple bus routes. 
* More recently, in the 1980s, the Blackrock bypass, [[N31 road (Ireland)|part of the N31]] which joins the ferry port at D<U+00FA>n Laoghaire to the national Primary Route network was built.

==History==
[[Image:Talbot Lodge.jpg|thumb|Talbot Lodge before demolition]]
An outcropping of calp rock which turns black when wet, erratic amongst the prevailing local white granite, and now no longer visible beneath the present surface of the Park, we are told<ref> DLR History  http://www.dlrcoco.ie/</ref>, gave Blackrock its name. Rock Road, which forms the South Western boundary of the park, is said to be one of the oldest roads in the country, having been part of the ancient Slighe Chualann constructed by a King's order several centuries before St. Patrick, to connect Tara with South Dublin and East Wicklow. The road it appears facilitated the O'Tooles and the O'Byrne's to pay their unwelcome visits to the neighbourhood of Dublin. The Rock Road was once directly beside the sea, and the railway line was built about {{convert|50|m|yd|lk=out}} from the coast, giving the impression that the trains were running on water. However, the intervening area soon became marshland and the area between Williamstown and Blackrock became Blackrock Park.

In 1787, the Blackrock road was such a common place for highway robberies that in an attempt to put an end to these crimes, a local meeting was setup at Jennett's Tavern in Blackrock and chaired by the then [[Viscount Ranelagh|Lord Viscount Ranelagh]]. It was resolved that a reward of <U+00A3>20 be payed to anyone who would apprehend and prosecute to conviction, any persons guilty of robbery upon the Blackrock Road from Dublin to D<U+00FA>n Laoghaire and surrounding areas. In fact, in 1826, Rev. George Wogan the curate of Donnybrook, was murdered in his house in Spafield Place near Ballsbridge. Later that evening of his murder, two bandits were apprehended for a highway robbery on the Blackrock Road and confessed to the murder and were hanged. This illustrates the danger faced by travellers of the Blackrock road at one time in the past.<ref>Blacker, B.H (1860). "Brief sketches of the parishes of Booterstown and Donnybrook", 92, 175</ref>

There are many fine houses of historical and architectural significance in the area that are still existing today or have been sadly demolished. [[Frescati House]] built in 1739, was a fine example and was the childhood home of Lord Edward FitzGerald at one time. Frescati, after much local protest to save it, was demolished in 1983 and Frascati Shopping Centre now stands in its place. <ref>[http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&si=1668919&issue_id=14484 Roches sale puts reclusive retail dynasty in limelight for last time - National News, Frontpage - Independent.ie<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Also in 1983, the demolition of Rosefield, previously Belleville, made way for the Blackrock Clinic. Rosefield was one of the first seaside villas built on the Fitzwilliam estate around 1750. <ref>Pearson, P (2001). "Between the Mountains and the Sea"</ref>

The Cross Avenue was the site of the assassination of [[Kevin O'Higgins]], and was also where [[Eamon de Valera]] lived after his Presidential term ended. 

In 1975 President de Valera died in Talbot Lodge, which was demolished in December 1989. Talbot Lodge had formed part of Linden Convalescent Home, of which only one of the original buildings survives.

The writer [[James Joyce]] lived in a house known as Leoville on Carysfort Avenue for one year in the early 1890s. This house is still extant. The writer [[Flann O'Brien]] lived at 4 Avoca Terrace and later at 81 Merrion Avenue. Both houses are still extant.
