At one time, "'''[[Precambrian]] rabbits'''" or "'''[[fossil]] rabbits in the Precambrian'''" rock samples became popular [[imagery]] in debates about the validity of the [[theory of evolution]] and the scientific field of [[evolutionary biology]]. The images are reported to have been among responses given by the biologist, [[J. B. S. Haldane]], when he was asked what [[evidence]] could destroy his confidence in the theory and the field of study. Many of his statements about his scientific research were popularized in his lifetime. 

Some accounts use this response to rebut claims that the [[theory]] of evolution is [[Objections to evolution#Evolution is unfalsifiable|not falsifiable]] by any [[empirical evidence]]. This followed an assertion by philosopher, [[Karl Popper]], who had proposed that ''falsifiability'' is an essential feature of a scientific theory. Popper also expressed doubts about the scientific status of evolutionary theory, although he later concluded that the field of study was genuinely scientific. 

[[Rabbits]] are mammals. From the perspective of the [[philosophy of science]], it is doubtful whether the genuine discovery of [[mammal|mammalian]] fossils in Precambrian rocks would overthrow the theory of evolution instantly, although, if authentic, such a discovery would indicate serious errors in modern understanding about the evolutionary process. Mammals are a class of animals, whose emergence in the [[geologic timescale]] is dated to much later than any found in Precambrian strata. Geological records indicate that although the first true mammals appeared in the [[Triassic]] period, modern mammalian orders appeared in the [[Palaeocene]] and [[Eocene]] epochs of the Palaeogene period. Many, many millions of years separate this period from the Precambrian.  

==Origin of the phrases==

Several authors have written that J. B. S. Haldane (1892<U+2013>1964) said that the discovery of a [[fossil]] [[rabbit]] in [[Precambrian]] rocks would be enough to destroy his belief in [[evolution]].<ref name="Ridley2004Evolution">{{cite book

==Theoretical background==
The philosopher [[Karl Popper]] held that any scientific proposition must be ''[[falsifiability|falsifiable]]'', in other words it must at least be possible to [[thought experiment | imagine]] an experiment whose outcome would disprove the hypothesis.<ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper" /> Initially he thought that [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]] (often summarized as "the survival of the fittest"<ref name=OriginCh4>"This preservation of favourable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest." &mdash; {{Citation

Unfortunately some of the adjustments he proposed resembled [[Lamarckianism]] or [[saltationism]], evolutionary theories that were and still are considered obsolete, and evolutionary biologists therefore disregarded his criticisms.<ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper">{{cite journal

Further confusion arose in 1980<U+2013>1981, when there was a long debate in the pages of ''[[Nature (journal) | Nature]]'' about the scientific status of the theory of evolution. None of the parties seriously doubted that the theory was both scientific and, according to current scientific knowledge, true. Some participants objected to statements that appeared to present the theory of evolution as an absolute scientific dogma, however, rather than as a hypothesis that so far has performed very well, and both sides quoted Popper in support of their positions. Some [[Creationist]]s took this as an opportunity to declare that the theory of evolution was unscientific.<ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper" />

==Would anachronistic fossils disprove evolution?==
Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins said that the discovery of fossil mammals in Precambrian rocks would "completely blow evolution out of the water."<ref>{{citation 
| title=The Evolution Wars | author=Wallis, C. | newspaper=Time | date= August 07, 2005

}}</ref> Philosopher [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] doubted that a single set of [[anachronistic]] fossils, however, even rabbits in the Precambrian, would disprove the theory of evolution outright. The first question raised by the assertion of such a discovery would be whether the alleged "Precambrian rabbits" really were fossilized rabbits. Alternative interpretations might include incorrect identification of the "fossils", incorrect dating of the rocks, and a [[hoax]] such as the [[Piltdown Man]] was shown to be. Even if the "Precambrian rabbits" turned out to be genuine, they would not instantly refute the theory of evolution, because that theory is a large package of ideas, including: that life on Earth has evolved over billions of years; that this evolution is driven by certain mechanisms; and that these mechanisms have produced a specific "family tree" that defines the relationships among species and the order in which they appeared. Hence, "Precambrian rabbits" would prove that there were one or more serious errors somewhere in this package, and the next task would be to identify the error(s).<ref name="GodfreySmith2003TheoryAndReality" /> 

Benton pointed out that, in the short term, scientists often have to accept the existence of competing hypotheses, each of which explains large parts&mdash;but not all&mdash;of the observed relevant data.<ref name="BentonHitchin1996QualityOfFossilRecord" />
