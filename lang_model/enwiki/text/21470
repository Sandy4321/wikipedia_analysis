Following the release of ''Lotus'', it peaked at number 53 on the South Korea [[Gaon Single Chart|international singles chart]].

<blockquote>
Sia is one of them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, she just writes the most beautiful amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale with a lot of more [[dance music|dance]]-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.<ref name="Billboard Conference"/>

Only two of the disc<U+2019>s 11 tracks attempt a genuine expression of vulnerability. Just one, 'Blank Page,' finds her looking inside and taking some blame.

Writing on behalf of [[4Music]], Chris Younie wrote that although "Blank Page" is followed by "Sing for Me", another ballad, the former is "utterly brilliant" and is "ten times better" than the latter. The continued to describe "Blank Page" as being "elegant and confessional". He praised her raw vocal performance and thought that should it be released as a single, it would have no problem matching the success of "Beautiful".<ref name="Lotus4MusicReview"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] complimented the simplicity of the song, writing that Aguilera "seizes the spotlight" and is accompanied by a "spare" piano arrangement.<ref name="LotusAllmusicReview"/> [[PopCrush]] critic Michael Gallucci described the song as a "showstopper" and compared it to "Beautiful" due to its minimalist structure.
