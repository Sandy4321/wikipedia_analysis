''Syed Munawar Hasan''' ({{lang-ur|'''  <U+0633><U+06CC><U+062F> <U+0645><U+0646><U+0648><U+0631> <U+062D><U+0633><U+0646>  '''}}) is the [[Emir|Ameer]] (President) of [[Jamaat-e-Islami]] of [[Pakistan]], a hardline [[Islamist]] party. 

Syed Munawar Hasan is from a distinguished family, based at [[Delhi]] before the independence of [[Pakistan]]. He was born in August 1944 and as his family opted for Pakistan, migrated to [[Karachi]] in 1947. He obtained a [[Master's degree|Masters]] in [[Sociology]] (1963) and in [[Islamic Studies]] (1966) from the [[University of Karachi]].<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\03\29\story_29-3-2009_pg7_3 Munawar elected as new JI chief]</ref>

He has come under criticism for suggesting that raped women, that cannot provide four Muslim male witnesses to the act of forced penetration, remain silent rather than file criminal charges. He has also attacked his critics on this issue as non-Muslims.<ref>[http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/6709/the-jamat-e-islami-and-rape/]</ref>

Hassan has also alleged that the 'Women's Protection Bill', a law that makes rape a criminal offense under the Pakistan Penal Code (which means that four witnesses are not required) does not protect women. He claims that 'it is meant to promote vulgarity and obscenity in the society'. Journalists have alleged that Hassan and the Jamaat-e-Islami promote a 'rape culture'.<ref>http://www.dawn.com/2011/07/08/your-rape-culture-is-not-my-religion.html</ref>

Syed Munawar Hasan joined the [[National Students Federation]] (NSF) - a student body with leftist leaning - and was elected its President in 1959. The real change appeared in his life when he got a chance to come closer to the activists of [[Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba]] (IJT) Pakistan and studied the writings of [[Abul Ala Maududi|Mawlana Syed Abul Ala Maududi]]. As a result, he joined IJT in 1960, became its member and soon he was elected as President of its [[University of Karachi]] Unit, Karachi City Unit and member of the Central Executive Council. Later, he reached its top slot and became all-Pakistan President in 1964 and served in that capacity for three consecutive terms. During his tenure of the President, the Jamiat organized several campaigns mobilizing public opinion regarding education problems, system of education, women education etc. etc.

He joined the [[Islamic Research Academy]] (IRAK) and later [[Islamic Jerusalem Studies]], at Karachi as a Research Assistant in 1963 and raised to its Secretary Generalship in 1969. Under his supervision, the Academy published 70 scholarly books. He also rendered services as Managing Editor of the Monthly [[The Criterion (monthly)|The Criterion]] and [[The Universal Message]], [[Karachi]].

Syed Munawar Hasan became a member of [[Jamaat-e-Islami|Jama<U+2019>at-e-Islami Pakistan]] in 1967.  He served the Karachi unit as Assistant Secretary, Secretary, Deputy Ameer and Ameer of the city. He was also elected to the Central Shura and the Executive Council of the Jama<U+2019>at. He represented Jama<U+2019>at at several platforms, including [[United Democratic Front (Pakistan)|United Democratic Front]] (UDF) and the [[Pakistan National Alliance]] (PNA). Contesting National Assembly election in 1977, he secured the highest votes in Pakistan. He was Assistant Secretary General of [[Jamaat-e-Islami|Jama<U+2019>at-e-Islami Pakistan]] in 1992-93, and became Secretary General in 1993.

He took part in a number of international conferences and seminars and has visited [[United States|USA]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Canada]], [[Central Asia]], [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and many countries of the [[Southeast Asia]].
