"'''Fight Club'''" is the twentieth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]] of the [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 7, 2000. It was written by series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], directed by [[Paul Shapiro (director)|Paul Shapiro]], and featured a guest appearance by [[Kathy Griffin]]. The episode plot serves as a [[List of Monster-of-the-Week characters in The X-Files|"Monster-of-the-Week"]] story, which is unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "Fight Club" earned a Nielsen household rating of 6.9, being watched by 11.70 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mostly negative reviews from television critics.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully cross paths with a pair of doppelgangers whose close proximity yields unlimited mayhem. Splitting up in two, the agent tries to find out "why" and "what" they are doing.

"Fight Club" was inspired by a "long-lost nugget" of a story that series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] had thought up awhile back about "mis-matched twins that had an almost nuclear reaction when they were around each other." Steve Kiziak and Arlene Pileggi<U+2014>[[David Duchovny]]'s stunt double and [[Mitch Pileggi]]'s wife, respectively<U+2014>were chosen to play the Mulder and Scully look-alikes at the start of the episode. "Fight Club" contained several scenes of intense action that necessitated the use of various stunt doubles and extras.

==Plot==
In [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], two [[Mormon]] missionaries visit two women at two different homes in the same neighborhood that look exactly alike. The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents that look and sound remarkably similar to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton ([[Kathy Griffin]]). Betty claims to have never seen the other woman before. The other woman then passes her by in a car and the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after the gruesome mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed. Meanwhile, the other woman, Lulu Pfeiffer (Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get it because she has had 17 jobs in 17 states in the past three years and moves around too much. She becomes aggrevated and suddenly, all the copies become black. The other woman, Betty, goes to another job with the same name and same resume.

[[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) begin to investigate the case. Later, in a bar, a man by the name of Bert Zupanic ([[Randall "Tex" Cobb]]) comes across Betty. Moments later, Lulu walks into the bar and an earthquake occurs that breaks all the glass in the bar. Lulu then runs out. Mulder finds out through a man named Argyle Saperstein that Zupanic and one of the women are in a relationship and that Zupanic is a professional wrestler. Scully finds that for the past 12 years the women have followed each other across 17 states and left mayhem in their wake. Saperstein calls Zupanic and it is revealed that Zupanic owes Saperstein money. In addition, Betty and Bert have been in a relationship, but he has been having an affair with Betty. A second earthquake occurs as Lulu prepares to walk in on Zupanic and Saperstein exchanging money. After Betty emerges from the bathroom, the two see each other and the glass in the building begins breaking. Zupanic is knocked unconscious and Saperstein takes the money and leaves.

Mulder and Scully decided to split up and interrogate the Templeton twins. Betty tells Mulder that Lulu is causing all of the problems and forcing her to leave, but Lulu tells Scully the same thing. Later, the two Templetons pass each other and a sewer grate blows open, sucking Mulder into the storm drain and sealing him in for the day. Scully finds that the girls share the same father, a man by the name of Bob Damphouse, who is in prison. Damphouse is revealed to be mentally insane, and is always in a fit of rage. Eventually, Mulder finds his way out of the storm drain he was sucked into earlier. At the prison, Scully meets a man that looks exactly like Bert Zupanic. Lulu and Betty meet at the fight and everyone in the audience breaks into a fight. The other Bert Zupanic shows up and everyone stops fighting. The two Zupanic's see each other and a fight breaks out again. The episode ends with Mulder and Scully shown bruised and beaten.<ref name="plot"/>

===Writing===
The inspiration for "Fight Club" was a "long-lost nugget" that series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] had thought up awhile back. He explained, "I had this idea for a long time to do a story about mis-matched twins that had an almost nuclear reaction when they were around each other."<ref name="p253"/> Carter began to write the episode at the same time as the pilot for the ''X-Files'' spin-off, ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]''. Because of the "insanity" in juggling two scripts at once, many more "crazy" elements made it into "Fight Club". When executive producer [[Frank Spotnitz]] first looked at the script, the noted that "[the episode] had an odd tone. It felt like a wild show."<ref name="p253">Shapiro, p. 253</ref>
===Casting===
The casting for the episode was reportedly hectic. Rick Millikan, the show's casting director, cast noted boxer-turned-actor [[Randall "Tex" Cobb]] as Bert Zupanic and comedian [[Kathy Griffin]]<U+2014>who had previously starred in the [[NBC]] comedy ''[[Suddenly Susan]]''<U+2014>as the Templeton twins. Two real wrestlers, [[Gene LeBell]] and [[Rob Van Dam]], were hired to play the parts of the bartender and Zupanic's opponent, respectively. Near the beginning of the episode, two FBI agents who bear a striking resemblance, in both physical appearance and voice, to Mulder and Scully appear.<ref name="p253"/> These characters were played by Steve Kiziak and Arlene Pileggi. Kiziak had previously served as David Duchovny's stunt double since the [[The X-Files (season 3)|third season]] episode "[[2Shy]]".<ref name="p253"/><ref>Gradnitzer and Pittson, pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref> Pileggi is the wife of [[Mitch Pileggi]], who portrayed [[Walter Skinner]] on the show. Duchovny and Anderson later dubbed their voices for the lines that the two look-alike FBI agents say.<ref name="p253"/>

[[Jack McGee (actor)|Jack McGee]] was cast as Bob Damfuse<U+2014>referred to colloquially as "Angry Bob"<U+2014>the father of the Templeton twins with a severe anger issue.<ref name="plot"/> During rehearsals for his scene, McGee purposely kept his voice down to prevent a severe headache. He recalled, "I remember the director [Paul Shapiro], he wanted me to scream during rehearsal, and I was, like, 'Look, you don<U+2019>t understand: If I do this, I<U+2019>m gonna have a headache in 30 fucking seconds.'"<ref name=avyell/> The scenes were rehearsed about five or six times before the actual tape was filmed.<ref name=avyell>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Will|title=Common Law star Jack McGee on working with everyone from Vanilla Ice to Ron Howard|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/common-law-star-jack-mcgee-on-working-with-everyon,75331/2/|publisher=The A.V.

===Filming and effects===
First-time ''X-Files'' director Paul Shapiro was tasked with directing the episode. Many of the [[Stunt|physical effects]] in the episode were coordinated by Danny Weselis, who noted that the episode contained several scenes featuring extensive stunt work. He explained, "during the bar explosions we had a room full of stunt people showered with broken glass. And we used stunt people for much of the missionary and special agent fights."<ref name="p253"/> The final scene, featuring a stadium attacking each other after the Templeton's make an appearance, was filmed at the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium]] in Los Angeles. Several hundred extras were contacted via ads on the internet and in select publications. The scene took two days to completely film. The crowd supplemented sixteen stuntmen and over 200 cardboard cutouts to give the stadium a filled-out feel. In order to create a mock fight, staff members gave the several hundred extras soft props to hit each other with. Producer Harry Bring later noted, "a few of [the audience] members got carried away and we had to tell them to settle down."<ref name="p253"/> During the finished episode, a [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]] was inserted as a way to enhance the scene and allow the viewer to "focus on various angles of action".<ref name="p253"/>

Critical reception to "Fight Club" was largely negative. Tom Kessenich, in his book ''Examinations'', gave the episode a scathing review. He wrote "If it is indeed true that somewhere out in this vast world we all have an identical twin, I have but one wish for mine. I sincerely hope he was spared the hour of torture that 'Fight Club' imposed upon me."<ref name="kess">Kessenich, p. 136</ref> Christina Brzustoski from 11th Hour Magazine opined that "Just when you thought ''The X-Files'' couldn't get a more grating guest star than [[Victoria Jackson]], Chris Carter manages to top himself yet again with not one, but two, for the love of God, two Kathy Griffins in the Carter-penned episode 'Fight Club.' It's a safe bet this disjointed, lame episode will probably not be easily confused with the far superior [[David Fincher]] [[Fight Club (film)|movie of the same name]]. But then the current state of ''The X-Files'' makes ''[[Elmo in Grouchland]]'' look like an Oscar contender."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brzustoski|first=Christina|title=The X-Files "Fight Club"|journal=11 Hour Web Magazine|url=http://www.the11thhour.com/archives/052000/tvreviews/xf_fightclub.html|archivedate=17 May 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080517064957/http://www.the11thhour.com/archives/052000/tvreviews/xf_fightclub.html|date=May 2000|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> Kenneth Silber from [[Space.com]] was very negative towards the episode, saying, "This episode conveys a strong sense of a writer, director and actors merely going through the motions, collecting their sizable paychecks while running out the clock on the season and series. The plot is not compelling, the agents themselves seem not to take it seriously, and the doppelgangers around whom the action revolves are little more than ciphers."<ref>{{cite web|last=Silber|first=Kenneth|title=Doppelgangers Wreak Havoc in X-Files 'Fight Club'|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20011007051226/http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_720_000508.html|publisher=Space.com|date=8 May 2000|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> [[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen'', rated the episode one star out of five.<ref name="shear">Shearman and Pearson, p. 224-225</ref> The two wrote, "'Fight Club' is a marker for a series that seems to want to die now, please. [<U+2026>] it's tonally one of the most atypical episodes the series ever made, conceived in spite and self-loathing and sheer exhaustion."<ref name="shear"/> Paula Vitaris from ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four.<ref name=cinepaula>{{cite journal|last=Vitaris|first=Paula|title=The X-Files Season Seven Episode Guide|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=October 2000|volume=32|issue=3|accessdate=29 March 2012|page=18<U+2013>37}}</ref> Vitaris criticized the use of Kathy Griffin and asserted, "the guest cast is one of the worst ever. [<U+2026>] Griffin [<U+2026>] simply is not up to the task; she can not differentiate Betty and Lulu at all [<U+2026>] and she reads every line as if she were still on her cancelled sitcom."<ref name=cinepaula/>

Not all reviews were so negative. Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and noted that "There are some great visual moments in Fight Club, and Chris Carter reveals an almost Vince Gilligan-side to him with his comic writing here."<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosell|first=Rich|title=The X-Files: The Complete Seventh Season|url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=4807|publisher=DigitallyObsessed|date=27 July 2003|accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref>
