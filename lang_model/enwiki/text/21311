'''Gol Transportes A<U+00E9>reos Flight 1907''' ([[ICAO]]: '''GLO 1907''', [[IATA]]: '''G3 1907''') was a [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-8EH SFP]], registration PR-GTD, on a scheduled passenger flight from [[Manaus]], [[Brazil]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]]. On September 29, 2006, just before 17:00 [[UTC-3|BST]], it collided in mid-air with an [[Embraer Legacy]] business jet over the Brazilian state of [[Mato Grosso]]. All 154 passengers and crew aboard the Boeing 737 were killed as the aircraft crashed into an area of dense [[rainforest]], while the Embraer Legacy, despite sustaining serious damage to its left wing and tail, landed safely with its seven occupants uninjured.<ref name=final/><ref name=ntsb_final/><ref name=asn>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20060929-0|title=Gol 1907 accident record|accessdate=2009-06-11|publisher=[[Aviation Safety Network|ASN]]}}</ref>

The accident, which triggered a [[2006<U+2013>2007 Brazilian aviation crisis|crisis in Brazilian civil aviation]], was the deadliest in that country's aviation history at the time, surpassing [[VASP Flight 168]], which crashed in 1982 with 137 fatalities near [[Fortaleza]].<ref name=VP168>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19820608-0|title=VASP 168 accident record|accessdate=2009-06-11|publisher=[[Aviation Safety Network|ASN]]}}</ref> It was subsequently surpassed by [[TAM Airlines Flight 3054]], which crashed on July 17, 2007 with 199 fatalities.<ref name=asn_tam>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20070717-0|title=TAM 3054 accident record|publisher=[[Aviation Safety Network|ASN]]|accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref>

The accident was investigated by both the [[Brazilian Air Force]] ''[[Centro de Investiga<U+00E7><U+00E3>o e Preven<U+00E7><U+00E3>o de Acidentes Aeron<U+00E1>uticos]]'' (CENIPA) and the U.S. [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB), with a final report issued on December 10, 2008. CENIPA concluded that the accident was caused by errors committed both  by [[air traffic controller]]s and by the Embraer's pilots, while the NTSB determined that all pilots acted properly and were placed on a collision course by a variety of "individual and institutional" [[air traffic control]] errors.<ref name=final/><ref name=ntsb_final/><ref name=avweek/><ref name=nyt1/>

In an initial deposition, the Embraer flight crew testified that they were cleared to [[flight level]] 370, approximately 37,000 feet (11.2&nbsp;km) [[above mean sea level]], by Brasilia [[Air traffic control|ATC]], and were level at that assigned altitude when the collision occurred. They also asserted that at the time of the collision they had lost contact with Brasilia ATC, and their [[Traffic Collision Avoidance System|anti-collision system]] did not alert them to any oncoming traffic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u392030.shtml|title=Legacy estava sem contato com a torre de controle|trans_title=Legacy was without contact with air traffic controllers|date=October 3, 2006|language=Portuguese|work=[[Folha Online]]}}</ref>

The accident was investigated by the [[Brazilian Air Force]] [[CENIPA]] and the U.S. [[NTSB]]. The NTSB, in accordance with the provisions of ICAO Annex 13, participated in the investigation representing the state of manufacture of the Boeing, state of registry and operator of the Embraer, and state of manufacture of the [[Honeywell]] avionics equipment installed in both planes.<ref name=ntsb_final/>

Once the black boxes and communication transcripts were obtained, the investigators interviewed the Embraer's flight crew and the air traffic controllers, trying to piece together the scenario which allowed two modern jet aircraft, equipped with the latest anti-collision gear, to collide with each other while on [[IFR|instrument flights]] in [[Controlled airspace|positive control airspace]].

The Embraer's flight plan consisted of flying at FL370 up to Brasilia,{{#tag:ref|FL370 is ''[[Flight Level]] 370'', which is an altitude of approximately 37,000 feet [[Above mean sea level|Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL)]]|group=note}} on [[Airway (aviation)|airway]] UW2, followed by a planned descent at Brasilia to FL360, proceeding outbound from Brasilia northwest-bound along airway UZ6 to the Teres fix,{{#tag:ref|The Teres fix is located on airway UZ6 at coordinates 12<U+00B0>28.5'S, 51<U+00B0>22.1'W, see: [[:Image:H4-Teres.jpg|High Altitude Enroute chart]]|group=note}} an aeronautical [[waypoint]] located 282&nbsp;[[Nautical mile|nm]] (324&nbsp;mi, 522&nbsp;km) northwest of Brasilia, where a climb to FL380 was planned. According to the filed flight plan, the Embraer was scheduled to have been level at FL380, proceeding towards Manaus, while passing the eventual collision point, which was about {{convert|307|km|mi|0}} northwest of Teres. 

The Embraer's crew asserted in their depositions and subsequent interviews that they were cleared by [[air traffic control]] (ATC) to FL370 for the entire trip, all the way to Manaus.<ref name=final/> The actual transcript of the clearance given to the Embraer's crew prior to takeoff at S<U+00E3>o Jos<U+00E9> dos Campos at 14:41:57&nbsp;BST, as later released by CENIPA, was:<ref name=final/>
<blockquote>November Six Zero Zero X-ray Lima, ATC clearance to Eduardo Gomes, flight level three seven zero direct Po<U+00E7>os de Caldas, [[Transponder (aviation)|squawk transponder]] code four five seven four, after take-off perform Oren departure.</blockquote>

The Embraer's crew's altitude clearance to FL370 was further confirmed after their handoff to Brasilia, during which they had the following radio exchange with ATC at 15:51&nbsp;BST:<ref name=final/><ref name=last2way>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/mp3/ontheweb/0812-aircrash-excel.mp3|title=Embraer's CVR Audio|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=2009-06-11}} (last ATC two-way comm at 17:55 on MP3 clip)</ref>

=== Embraer flight and communication sequence ===

The Embraer took off from S<U+00E3>o Jos<U+00E9> dos Campos at 14:51, reaching FL370 at 15:33, 42 minutes later, where it remained until the collision.<ref name=final/>

ATC maintained normal two-way radio contact with the Embraer up until 15:51, when the last successful radio exchange with the Embraer was made on [[VHF]] frequency 125.05&nbsp;[[MHz]] with Brasilia [[Area Control Center|Center]].{{#tag:ref|Brasilia Area Control Center is designated as ''ACC BS''.|group=note}} At that point the Embraer was just approaching the Brasilia [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]].{{#tag:ref|The [[VHF omnidirectional range|VHF omnidirectional range (VOR)]] transmitter installation is a defined waypoint, underlying the airway.|group=note}} The Embraer overflew the Brasilia VOR at 15:55, four minutes later, and proceeded northwest-bound along UZ6. At 16:02, seven minutes after crossing the Brasilia VOR, [[secondary radar]] contact was lost with the Embraer, thus stopping the display of the Embraer's reported altitude ([[Transponder (aviation)#Mode A and Mode C|Mode C]]) on the controller's radar screen.{{#tag:ref|
*As it was later revealed in CENIPA's final report, the military controller's screen automatically reverted to displaying an unreliable altitude, normally used for air defense, derived from the primary radar detected range and the target's angle above the horizon.
*CENIPA hypothesizes in its final report that at this point the Embraer's captain inadvertently deactivated the transponder. The captain has denied this in depositions and interviews.<ref name=final/>|group=note}}

No attempt was made by either the Embraer or Brasilia Center to contact each other from 15:51 until 16:26 when, 24 minutes after the loss of secondary radar contact,{{#tag:ref|Loss of secondary radar indicates to a controller that the aircraft's transponder signal is not being received by ATC.|group=note}} Brasilia Center called the Embraer and received no reply.

Brasilia Center then unsuccessfully attempted to contact the Embraer six more times, between 16:30 and 16:34. At 16:30 the Embraer's primary radar target became intermittent, and disappeared completely from the radar screen by 16:38, eight minutes later. Brasilia Center unsuccessfully attempted to effect a handoff of the Embraer to Amazonic Center at 16:53, by calling the Embraer in the blind.{{#tag:ref|
*A ''handoff'' in aviation parlance refers to the transfer of responsibility for an aircraft under radar control from one controller to the next

The Embraer, on the other hand, started calling Brasilia Center,{{#tag:ref|According to CENIPA, the last transmission from ATC that was recorded on the Embraer's CVR was at 16:23:29 BST, approx. 25 minutes before the Embraer's first officer tried to call ATC.

While both planes were equipped with TCAS, it was later determined that the Embraer's [[transponder (aviation)|transponder]] had ceased operating almost an hour earlier, at 16:02, rendering both planes unable to automatically detect each other.<ref name=final/>

At 16:59:50, about three minutes after the collision, Amazonic Center started to receive the Embraer's secondary radar reply, with its correct altitude and last assigned code.{{#tag:ref|CENIPA hypothesizes in its final report that at this point, based on CVR and FDR evidence, the first officer, having just discovered the transponder had been inadvertently switched off, reactivated it.

The Embraer started calling on the emergency frequency, 121.5 MHz, immediately after the collision, but as it was later determined in the CENIPA report, the emergency [[transceiver]]s in the area were not operational and thus the crew was unable to reach ATC on that frequency.<ref name=final/><ref name=cvr_collision/>

At 17:01:06 the Embraer established contact on the emergency frequency with a [[Boeing 747-400|Boeing 747]] cargo aircraft, [[Polar Air Cargo|Polar]] 71, which attempted to relay to ATC their request for an emergency landing, and continued to provide relay and translation assistance to the Embraer until its eventual landing.<ref name=final/><ref name=cvr_collision/>

At 17:18:03 the Embraer contacted the Cachimbo air base (SBCC) tower directly to coordinate its emergency landing there, and landed safely at Cachimbo at 17:23:00.

===Gol 1907 flight and communication sequence===
Gol 1907 took off from Manaus at 15:35, flying southeast-bound along UZ6 and reaching FL370 at 15:58, 23 minutes later, where it remained until the collision. There were no radio or radar contact problems with the flight until its handoff to Brasilia Center.  There were no known attempts by ATC to warn Flight 1907 of the conflicting traffic.<ref name=final/>

===NTSB Safety Recommendation===
On May 2, 2007 the NTSB issued a Safety Recommendation document that included an interim summary of the investigation to date, as well as some immediate safety recommendations that the NTSB believes should be implemented by the U.S. [[FAA]] to enhance flight safety.<ref name=ntsbsr>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/recs/letters/2007/A07_35_37.pdf|title=NTSB Safety Recommendation|accessdate=December 18, 2008 |date=May 2, 2007|format=PDF|publisher=[[NTSB]]}}</ref> The NTSB reported that the Embraer apparently experienced a [[TCAS]] outage, unbeknownst to its flight crew prior to the collision, according to the [[Cockpit Voice Recorder|CVR]]:<blockquote>Preliminary findings in the ongoing investigation indicate that, for reasons yet to be determined, the collision avoidance system in the Legacy airplane was not functioning at the time of the accident, thereby disabling the system<U+2019>s ability to detect and be detected by conflicting traffic. In addition, CVR data indicate that the flight crew was unaware that the collision avoidance system was not functioning until after the accident.</blockquote>
The NTSB added that the design of the Embraer's avionics is such that the non-functioning of the TCAS that apparently occurred is annunciated by a small static white text message, which may not be noticeable by the flight crew. The NTSB noted:<blockquote>Using only static text messages to indicate a loss of collision avoidance system functionality is not a reliable means to capture pilots<U+2019> attention because these visual warnings can be easily overlooked if pilots<U+2019> attention is directed elsewhere in the flight environment.</blockquote>

Based on its observations, the NTSB recommended to the FAA that design changes be implemented to improve the noticeability of TCAS annunciation, and that the FAA advise pilots of all aircraft to become more familiar with the details of this accident, potential loss of transponder and/or TCAS function, and how to recognize them.<ref name=ntsb_final/>

On December 10, 2008, more than two years after the accident, [[CENIPA]] issued its final report, describing its investigation, findings, conclusions and recommendations.<ref name=final>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/Aviation/Brazil-CENIPA/Midair_Collision_Final_Report_1907_English_version.pdf|title=Final Report|accessdate=2009-06-11|publisher=[[Centro de Investiga<U+00E7><U+00E3>o e Preven<U+00E7><U+00E3>o de Acidentes Aeron<U+00E1>uticos|CENIPA]]|date=December 8, 2008|format=PDF}}</ref> The CENIPA report includes a "Conclusions" section that summarizes the known facts and lists a variety of contributing factors relating to both air traffic controllers and the Embraer's flight crew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agenciabrasil.gov.br/noticias/2008/12/10/materia.2008-12-10.0746284209/view|publisher=[[Ag<U+00EA>ncia Brasil|Agencia Brasil]]|title=Falhas de pilotos e controladores de v<U+00F4>o resultaram em acidente da Gol|trans_title=Gol accident caused by pilot and controller errors|language=Portuguese|date=December 10, 2008|accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref><ref name=sibaja>{{cite news|url=http://origin.foxnews.com/wires/2008Dec10/0,4670,LTBrazilPlaneCrash,00.html|title=Pilots and controllers blamed for Brazil crash|publisher=''[[Associated Press|AP]]'' on [[Fox News]]|date=December 10, 2008}}</ref> According to CENIPA, the air traffic controllers contributed to the accident by originally issuing an improper clearance to the Embraer, and not catching or correcting the mistake during the subsequent handoff to Brasilia Center or later on. CENIPA also found errors in the way the controllers handled the loss of radar and radio contact with the Embraer.<ref name=final/><ref name=sibaja/>

CENIPA concluded that the Embraer pilots also contributed to the accident with, among others, their failure to recognize that their transponder was inadvertently switched off, thereby disabling the collision avoidance system on both aircraft, as well as their overall insufficient training and preparation.<ref name=final/><ref name=sibaja/>

===NTSB===
The U.S. NTSB issued its own report on the accident, which was also appended to the CENIPA report with the following Probable Cause statement:<ref name=ntsb_final>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/Aviation/Brazil-CENIPA.htm|title=NTSB interim and final report links|publisher=[[NTSB]]|accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref>
<blockquote>The evidence collected during this investigation strongly supports the conclusion that this accident was caused by N600XL and GLO1907 following ATC clearances which directed them to operate in opposite directions on the same airway at the same altitude resulting in a midair collision. The loss of effective air traffic control was not the result of a single error, but of a combination of numerous individual and institutional ATC factors, which reflected systemic shortcomings in emphasis on positive air traffic control concepts.</blockquote>

The NTSB further added the following contributing factors:
<blockquote>Contributing to this accident was the undetected loss of functionality of the airborne collision
avoidance system technology as a result of the inadvertent inactivation of the transponder on board N600XL. Further contributing to the accident was inadequate communication between ATC and the N600XL flight crew.</blockquote>

===Conflicting CENIPA and NTSB conclusions===
While agreeing on most basic facts and findings, CENIPA and NTSB, which collaborated in the accident investigation, arrived at disagreeing interpretations and conclusions. The CENIPA report concludes the accident was caused by mistakes made both by air traffic controllers and by the Embraer pilots, whereas the NTSB focuses on the controllers and the ATC system, concluding that both flight crews acted properly but were placed on a collision course by the air traffic controllers.<ref name=ntsb_final/><ref name=avweek>{{cite news|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/SPAR12118.xml&headline=Brazil%20Air%20Force,%20NTSB%20Spar%20on%20Midair%20Causes&channel=busav|title=Brazil Air Force, NTSB Spar on Midair Causes|work=[[Aviation Week]]|date=December 11, 2008}}</ref><ref name=nyt1>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/world/americas/11brazil.html?_r=2&ref=world|title=Brazil Lays Some Blame on U.S. Pilots in Collision|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 10, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/ntsb-cenipa-at-odds-over-midair-accident-report/|work=AIN Online|title=NTSB, Cenipa at Odds over Midair Accident Report|date=December 11, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aero-news.net/news/commair.cfm?ContentBlockID=738e78f6-a93e-44bb-a7ef-08c9c99fed06&Dynamic=1|title=NTSB, Brazilian Officials Differ On Blame For 2006 Midair|date=December 11, 2008|work=Aero-News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2008494007_crash11.html|title=Turned-off warning device tied to 2006 U.S.-Brazil air disaster|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' on ''[[The Seattle Times]]''|date=December 11, 2008}}</ref>

In October 2006, as details surrounding the crash of Flight 1907 began to emerge, the investigation seemed to be at least partly focused on possible air traffic control errors. This led to increasing resentment by the controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto040420071734361103|title=Brazilian aviation in chaos|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=Apr 4, 2007}}</ref> The controllers complained about being overworked, underpaid, overstressed, and forced to work with outdated equipment.

Amid rising tensions, the air traffic controllers began staging a series of work actions, including slowdowns, walkouts, and even a [[hunger strike]]. This led to chaos in Brazil's aviation industry: major delays and disruptions in domestic and international air service, stranded passengers, canceled flights, and public demonstrations.

===Legal action===
On November 6, 2006, the families of ten of the deceased filed a lawsuit for negligence against ExcelAire and [[Honeywell]], alleging that the Embraer pilots were flying at an "incorrect altitude" and that the Honeywell transponder was not functioning at the time of the collision.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6123030.stm|title=US firms sued over Brazil crash|date=November 6, 2006|work=[[BBC]]}}</ref> Other suits were subsequently filed on behalf of other victims, with similar allegations against ExcelAire and Honeywell.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=900005552066|title=New Lawsuit Alleges Design Defect, Negligence in Brazil Crash|date=November 13, 2006|publisher=''[[Associated Press|AP]]'' on law.com}}</ref>
The attorney representing the Embraer crew, Miami-based Robert Torricella, responded to the allegation that the crew was flying at an "incorrect altitude" by stating that according to international regulations, clearances and directives issued by ATC supersede a previously filed flight plan, and in this case:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?ContentBlockID=ee81d271-d7e1-4c15-bf92-14c06ab16acb|title=ExcelAire: Lawsuits Regarding Gol Jet Accident Premature|date=November 9, 2006|publisher=aero-news.net}}</ref><blockquote>...&nbsp;the flight plan cleared by air traffic control at the time of departure required the Embraer to fly all the way to Manaus at 37,000 feet and, absent contrary directives from air traffic control, the Embraer was obligated to follow its cleared flight plan. As the findings of the investigation are made public, we are confident that ExcelAire's pilots will be exonerated.</blockquote>
A Honeywell spokesperson stated that "Honeywell is not aware of any evidence that indicates that its transponder on the Embraer Legacy was not functioning as designed or that Honeywell was responsible for the accident."<ref>{{cite news|url=|title=Lawsuit Blames Device Manufacturer, Airline for Brazil Crash|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=900005551961|publisher=''[[Associated Press|AP]]'' on law.com|date=November 7, 2006}}</ref>
