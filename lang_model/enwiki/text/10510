'''George Rap<U+00E9>e''' (1915<ref name=OEB>{{OEB|5|715}}</ref> <U+2013> April 1, 1999)<ref name=truscott/> was an American [[Contract bridge|bridge]] player. From 1942 to 1980 he was the most successful player in the [[American Contract Bridge League]] (ACBL) in its three most important {{gcb|team|teams-of-four}} tournaments, the Vanderbilt, Spingold, and Reisinger.<ref name=truscott/> He played on the American teams that won the first three [[Bermuda Bowl]]s, 1950 to 1953.

== Life ==

Rap<U+00E9>e was born and raised in New York City. His parents were from Hungary; his father Erno Rap<U+00E9>e was a concert pianist<ref name=ACBLhof/> and orchestra [[conducting |conductor]]. He earned bachelor's and law degrees at [[New York University]] and served in the [[US Army]] for three years during World War II.<ref name=truscott/> He was an attorney and real estate investor<ref name=OEB/> or, in the words of his obituary by [[Alan Truscott]], "a real estate lawyer&nbsp;... assembling properties for development".<ref name=truscott/>

He died at his home in [[Floral City, Florida]], age 83, survived by his wife Joellen Hall Rap<U+00E9>e, a daughter, and two grandsons.<ref name=truscott/>

== Bridge career ==

Rap<U+00E9>e is known as the man who invented the [[Stayman convention]] that is named for [[Sam Stayman]].<ref name=OEB/> (It was first published in 1945 under Stayman's name. One of the world's most popular bridge {{gcb|bidding}} conventions, generally as "Stayman", it was invented also and perhaps earlier by [[Jack Marx (bridge) |Jack Marx]], for whom it is named in the U.K.) According to Truscott, Rap<U+00E9>e had the idea {{circa|1940|lk=yes}} that a two clubs response to one notrump asks for a major suit; his long-time partner Stayman "enlarged and publicized the idea".<ref name=truscott/> 

Rap<U+00E9>e was 21 years old when he first won a national title in 1936<ref name=truscott1996/> (predating the ACBL, est. 1937, and not listed below). Sixty years later he "currently" entered all major American tournaments for open teams and he had been the oldest player to achieve several marks including a bronze medal as team captain and player in the 1990 [[Rosenblum Cup]] (off-year world championship).<ref name=truscott1996/> <!-- 179 entries; open to any 4some to 6some that pays the fee --> 

Rap<U+00E9>e and Stayman, as well as [[Johnny Crawford]] and [[Howard Schenken]], played on the teams that won the first three Bermuda Bowls, representing America against Europe. (The inaugural event, played 1950 in Bermuda, was a 3-way tournament with Great Britain and "Europe", followed for several years by long head-to-head matches with a European champion that might be Great Britain.) One or two others played on each team.<!--Goren, Silodor, Becker, Lightner--> Rap<U+00E9>e represented ACBL again in 1958 and 1969, on teams that placed second and third in the expanding tournament. He was on the third-place<!--bronze?--> USA team in the inaugural, 1960 [[World Team Olympiad]].

Rap<U+00E9>e was inducted by the [[ACBL Hall of Fame]] in 1997.<ref name=HOFby/> He was the only survivor from the American teams in the first three Bermuda Bowls and, during the preceding year, the ACBL had ranked him number five among American players all-time according to a rating of first and second-place finishes in major North American and world tournaments.<ref name=truscott1997/><ref name=ACBLhof/>

According to his ACBL citation, critical coverage of the [[Bermuda Bowl#1958 Como, Italy |1958 Bermuda Bowl]], by [[Edgar Kaplan]] in ''[[The Bridge World]]'', identified Rap<U+00E9>e as the outstanding American player in defeat by Italy.<!--4 in a row for Europe inclg 2 for Italy, maybe a watershed--> Quoting Kaplan, "Rap<U+00E9>e's performance was most impressive. He was the only American to play up to his potential, and his potential is considerable."<ref name=ACBLhof/> Also quoted in the Hall of Fame citation, [[Bobby Wolff]] and [[Sidney Lazard]] suggested that Rap<U+00E9>e may have been the best American player mid-century. Wolff called him "by far the most consistent" and Lazard "the best of the bunch, including John Crawford and Howard Schenken".<ref name=ACBLhof/>
