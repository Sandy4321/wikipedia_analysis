'''''Four Sheets to the Wind''''' is a 2007 independent drama film written and directed by [[Sterlin Harjo]].  It was Harjo's first feature film, and won several awards at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]] and [[American Indian Film Festival]].

==Plot==
The film tells the story of Cufe, a young [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma|Seminole]]/[[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Creek]] man who travels from his small Oklahoma home town to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] to visit his sister, Miri, after the suicide and funeral of their father.  While Miri struggles with her life in the city, Cufe becomes friendly, and then romantically involved, with Miri's neighbor, Francie, and he begins to perceive that his life has more possibilities than he had realized.<ref name="nyt">John Anderson, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/movies/27ande.html?pagewanted=all "This Time, the Indians Tell Their Own Story"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 27, 2006.</ref><ref name="Comedy">Andrew Horton, Joanna E.

==Production==
The script was developed with the support of the [[Sundance Institute]], and was filmed in [[Holdenville, Oklahoma]] (Harjo's hometown) and in Tulsa.<ref name="nyt"/><ref>[http://camerainthesun.com/?p=3391 "Camera Q&A: Sterlin Harjo on filming in Oklahoma"], ''Camera in the Sun'', November 26, 2010.</ref>  Harjo has commented that one of his purposes in writing the script was to react against expectations and stereotypes, for example by depicting Cufe "drinking a beer" while not making alcoholism a central issue, and showing him becoming involved with Francie without making the movie into a "an issue-driven interracial relationship story".<ref>Joshua Klein, [http://thislandpress.com/06/03/2010/sterlin-harjo-and-the-real-indian/?read=complete "Sterlin Harjo and the Real Indian"], ''[[This Land Press]]'', June 3, 2010.</ref>

==Reception==
The film premiered at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]], where it was nominated for the grand jury prize.  The film's co-star Tamara Podemski won a Sundance special jury prize for her performance as Miri,<ref>Jeff Vice, [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/655192019/Sundance-fest-winners-explore-our-global-society.html?pg=all "Sundance fest winners explore 'our global society'"], ''[[Deseret News]]'', January 28, 2007.</ref> and she was later nominated for best supporting actress at the [[23rd Independent Spirit Awards|2007 Independent Spirit Awards]].<ref name="Comedy"/> At the 2007 [[American Indian Film Festival]], Harjo was named best director, and Cody Lightning was named best actor for his performance as Cufe.<ref name="NMAI">[http://filmcatalog.nmai.si.edu/person/913/ Sterlin Harjo], [[National Museum of the American Indian]], March 2011 (updated April 2014).</ref>

The film received largely positive reviews from critics. [[The Hollywood Reporter|Hollywood Reporter]]/[[Associated Press]] reviewer Duane Byrge noted that it was a "captivating crowd-pleaser" at Sundance, praised the actors, and described it as "a personal story that transcends any specific heritage or geographic setting".<ref>Duane Byrge, [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/four-sheets-wind-159295 "Four Sheets to the Wind" (review)], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', January 24, 2007.</ref>''  [[Variety (newspaper)|Variety]]'''s Dennis Harvey commented that the film is "so low-key it risks making little impression", but ultimately wins "viewer sympathy and affection".<ref>Dennis Harvey, [http://variety.com/2007/film/reviews/four-sheets-to-the-wind-1200510738/ "Review: 'Four Sheets To The Wind'"], ''[[Variety (newspaper)|Variety]]'', January 30, 2007.</ref>  Zack Haddad of ''[[Film Threat]]'' compared the film to ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]'' and complimented its "wonderfuly oddball comedy" as well as its "heart-felt" message.<ref>Zack Haddad, [http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/9675/ "Four Sheets to the Wind" (review)], ''[[Film Threat]]'', January 24, 2007.</ref>
