"'''Walking on Air'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Katy Perry]] for her fourth studio album, ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013), included as its fourth track. It was released to digital retailers on September 30, 2013 by [[Capitol Records]], as the record's second [[Promotional recording|promotional single]], following the release of "[[Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)|Dark Horse]]". The song was part of a poll promoted by [[Pepsi]], along with "Dark Horse", where fans could vote for which song they wanted to become ''Prism''{{'}}s first promotional single. Inspired by [[CeCe Peniston]] and [[Crystal Waters]], "Walking on Air" is styled in [[Deep house|deep house]] and incorporates influences from [[1990s in music|90s]] [[Eurodance]].

Upon its release, "Walking on Air" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who highlighted its catchiness, but were ambivalent towards its musical composition. The track entered several charts with moderate digital downloads, including reaching number 34 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Internationally, it charted in the top 20 in various countries, including Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Perry promoted 'Walking on Air' with several live performances, including at the 2013 [[iTunes Festival]] and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

==Background and release==
"Walking on Air" was produced and programmed by Swedish record producers [[Klas <U+00C5>hlund]] and [[Max Martin]]. It was recorded and engineered at Apmamman and MXM Studios, located in [[Stockholm|Stockholm, Sweden]] and Conway Recording Studios in [[Hollywood, California]]. It was engineered by Michael Illbert, Peter Carlsson and Sam Holland, and assisted by Cory Bice. [[Serban Ghenea]] later mixed the song at MixStar Studios, in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]].

In a press release on August 20, 2013, [[PepsiCo]] announced a partnership with Perry to promote her fourth studio album ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'': the company announced a social "[[Twitter|tweet]]-to-unlock" voting program, where fans could unlock song titles and their respective lyrics, by tweeting the hashtag #KATYNOW. The chosen tracks for the campaign were "Walking on Air" and "[[Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)|Dark Horse]]". Once tweets voting for each song reached a certain number, their respective samples were unlocked and fans could start to vote for which one they wanted to have an early release on digital retailers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pepsi And MTV Team Up With Global Superstar Katy Perry For Special Finale Performance From Undisclosed Location In Brooklyn During The 2013 'MTV Video Music Awards'|url=http://www.pepsico.com/PressRelease/Pepsi-And-MTV-Team-Up-With-Global-Superstar-Katy-Perry-For-Special-Finale-Perfor08202013.html|publisher=[[PepsiCo]]|accessdate=December 17, 2013|date=August 20, 2013}}</ref> The winner was "Dark Horse", which was released on September 17, 2013 on the [[iTunes Store]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Lee, Christina|title=Katy Perry Will Drop "Dark Horse" (Featuring Juicy J) As Her Next 'Prism' Single|url=http://www.idolator.com/7480598/katy-perry-next-prism-single-dark-horse-juicy-j|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]].

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
Critical commentary of "Walking on Air" was mostly favorable: Sal Cinquemani from [[Slant Magazine]] was very positive of the song: he described it as "surprisingly soulful, throwback" to 90s deep house, although he noted that <U+00C5>hlund decided to give Perry a different sound from the Euro electro-pop he had produced for ''[[Body Talk (Robyn album)|Body Talk]]'' (2010).<ref>{{cite web|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|title=Katy Perry: Prism|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/katy-perry-prism|website=[[Slant Magazine]]|accessdate=December 17, 2013|date=October 17, 2013}}</ref> Greg Kot from ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' deemed the single a "catchy [[Pop music|pop]] tune",<ref>{{cite web|last=Kot|first=Greg|title=Katy Perry, 'Prism' album review|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-10-20/entertainment/chi-kate-perry-prism-review-20131020_1_katy-perry-russell-brand-album-review|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=December 17, 2013|date=October 20, 2013}}</ref> while Randall Roberts from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the song's "euphoria" was "infectious",<ref>{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Randall|title=Review: Hits pack Katy Perry's 'Prism'|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-katy-perry-prism-review-20131022,0,6156766.story#axzz2nUKoHxOv|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=December 17, 2013|date=October 22, 2013}}</ref> and Rob Harvilla from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' classified it as "delicious".<ref>{{cite web|last=Harvilla|first=Rob|title=Katy Perry Grows Up and Bums Us Out on Her Shrewd, Tepid 'Prism'|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/katy-perry-prism-capitol/|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=[[Spin Media]]|accessdate=December 17, 2013|date=October 22, 2013}}</ref> Also, Elysa Gardner from ''[[USA Today]]'' recommended readers to download "Walking on Air".<ref>{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Elysa|title=Review: Katy Perry's 'Prism' honors spirit and flesh|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/10/18/katy-perry-prism-album-review-listen-up/2978993/|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]], Inc.|accessdate=December 17, 2013|date=October 21, 2013}}</ref> 

Other reviews were mixed. Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Alexis Petridis criticized ''Prism'' for not having anything "sonically adventurous", noting that the album mainly had 90s pop-house in its songs, giving the example of the "jangling piano riff" present on "Walking on Air", but still found those melodies to be stronger than the ones found on [[Jessie J]]'s ''[[Alive (Jessie J album)|Alive]]'' (2013).<ref>{{cite web|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|title=Katy Perry: Prism <U+2013> review|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/17/katy-perry-prism-review|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=December 17, 2013|date=October 17, 2013}}</ref> In a mixed to positive review of the song, Will Hermes from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the song as "frothy".<ref name = "RollingStonesongreview">{{cite web|last=Hermes|first=Will|title=Katy Perry, Walking on Air|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/walking-on-air-20131010|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=December 17, 2013|date=October 10, 2013}}</ref> Marah Eakin from ''[[The A.V.
