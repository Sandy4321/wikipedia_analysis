'''Max Sieben Baucus''' (born December 11, 1941) is the senior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Montana]] and is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. Baucus is currently chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance]] and the seventh longest-serving current senator.

==Early life, education, and early career ==
Baucus was born in [[Helena, Montana]], and graduated from Helena High School in 1959.  He attended [[Carleton College]] in Minnesota for a year before transferring to [[Stanford University]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in economics 1964, and was a member of the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] frat. After graduating, he attended Stanford University's law school, receiving his degree in 1967. 

After finishing law school, Baucus spent three years as a lawyer at the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] in Washington, D.C. He moved back to Montana in 1971 to serve as the executive director of the state's Constitutional Convention, also opening a law office in [[Missoula, Montana]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_sleeper_of_the_senate |work=American Prospect |title=The Sleeper of the Senate |author=Ezra Klein |date=November 6, 2008}}</ref>

In November 1973, Baucus was elected to the [[Montana State Legislature]] as a state representative from Missoula.  In November 1974 he was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]], and was re-elected in 1976.

==United States Senate==
===Elections ===
Baucus was elected to the U.S. Senate on November 7, 1978 for the term beginning January 3, 1979, but was subsequently appointed to the seat by Montana's Democratic Governor [[Thomas Lee Judge]] on December 15, 1978 to fill the brief vacancy created by Senator [[Paul G. Hatfield]]'s resignation. He has served consecutively ever since.

The 2002 Montana elections got national attention when Baucus's opponent, [[Montana State Legislature|state senator]] Mike Taylor, accused Baucus of having implied that Taylor was [[homosexuality|gay]] in a campaign ad. However, the ad was paid for by the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]], not by the Baucus campaign. The ad, which alleged that Taylor had embezzled funds from the [[cosmetology]] school he once owned, showed footage from the early 1980s of Taylor massaging another man's face while wearing a tight suit with an open shirt.  Taylor dropped out of the race and Baucus won with 63 percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gransbery|first=Jim |url=http://www.billingsgazette.com/newdex.php?display=rednews/2002/10/10/build/local/50-taylor-bails.inc |title=Taylor quits Senate race in Montana |publisher=Billings Gazette|date=2002-10-10 |accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref>

===Political positions and actions===

Baucus is a [[moderate]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dscc.org/content?content_item_KEY=1448|title=Biography of Senator Max Baucus|publisher=Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee|accessdate=2009-05-11}}</ref> member of the Democratic Party, frequently breaking with them on the issues of taxes, the environment, and [[gun control]]. Most recently Baucus, as chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]], caused controversy when calling the first senate meeting of interested parties before the committee to discuss [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform]], which included representatives from pharmaceutical groups, insurance companies, and HMOs and hospital management companies, but did not include representatives from groups calling for [[single-payer health care]] which is the reform idea that has the most support amongst medical doctors, nurses, and the population at large. <ref name=schultz>http://www.edschultzshow.com/videoblog/details.asp?BID=111 MSNBC The Ed Show: Is Single payer on or off the table?</ref> Advocate groups disrupted the meeting to protest their exclusion and statements by Senator Baucus that "single payer was not an option on the table."<ref name=schultz/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://therealnews.com/t/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=3665Single-payer|title=Doctors Protest Exclusion of Single-Payer at Senate Finance Committee|date=2009-05-05|publisher=The Real News Network|accessdate=2009-05-11}}</ref> Baucus has coined the term "uniquely American health care system" to describe the end point of current health reform and has said that he believes America is not ready yet for any form of single payer health care. Others have pointed out that America already has a "uniquely American" single payer health care system, Medicare. Some have pointed out that Baucus is a big recipient of funding from the medical services and health insurance industry.<ref name=schultz/>

He voted for the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]]. He has usually voted against repealing portions of that bill and more recent tax cut bills that benefit upper income taxpayers.  In 1999, he was the only Democrat to vote against an amendment by [[Frank Lautenberg]] (D-[[New Jersey|NJ]]) that sought to "regulate the sale of firearms at gunshows." His environmental record is mixed. Baucus supports Democratic leadership in voting against oil and gas subsidies and [[ANWR]] drilling, as well as by voting in favor national standards to reduce oil consumption and spur the use of hydrogren automobiles. However, he has voted against the [[CAFE]] emission standards and on increasing federal funds for solar and wind power. 

In 2006, he voted for a constitutional amendment prohibiting the [[flag burning|physical desecration]] of the [[American flag]]. He supports the [[death penalty]]. On other issues, Baucus is more in the mainstream of his party. He opposes the [[United States embargo against Cuba]] and the restrictions on travel there. He was one of 26 senators to vote against the [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005]]. Despite opposing gay marriage, he voted against a proposed constitutional ban on it and has supported measures to curb job discrimination and hate crimes based on sexual orientation. Baucus also favored a bill that will require online [[pornography]] sites to have a [[.XXX]] domain, together with [[Mark Pryor]] (D-[[Arkansas|Ark.]]) Baucus is a strong supporter of [[Israel]]. In the Senate, he is one of the largest career recipients of pro-Israel Political Action Committee (PAC) contributions, receiving $319,348 as of 2006.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

Overall, Baucus has retained a populist image that has kept him consistently popular in his home state of Montana. He has frequently visited places of employment within the state and has personally participated in activities that he calls "Work Days." He has also hosted economic development conferences and can be frequently found hunting and fishing on public lands around Montana [http://baucus.senate.gov/about/values.cfm].

On February 26, 2009 Baucus and [[Robert Byrd]] were sole Democrats to vote against [[District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009]], which provides a voting seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] for the [[District of Columbia]] and adding a seat for [[Utah]]. The bill passed 61-27 with one Senator not voting<ref>http://senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00073</ref>.

Baucus had voted for the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002]], but has joined the Democrats in the Senate in demanding the phased withdrawal of the [http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/109/senate/2/votes/182/ Levin Amendment] (no firm deadline). He voted with a majority of Democrats against the [http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/109/senate/2/votes/181/ Kerry Amendment] (firm deadline for withdrawal).

It was reported on August 1 2006<ref>[http://www.sunherald.com/mld/sunherald/news/breaking_news/15173991.htm Sun Herald news report]</ref><ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14140498/ Montana senator<U+2019>s nephew dies in Iraq]</ref> that Baucus's nephew [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] Cpl. Phillip E. Baucus (September 24, 1977&ndash;July 29, 2006) was killed in combat in Al [[Anbar]] province, Iraq, on July 29. Phillip Baucus, a 28-year-old resident of [[Wolf Creek, Montana]], had been a member of the [[3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion]], [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], [[I Marine Expeditionary Force]]<ref>[http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=9799 DefenseLink: "DoD Identifies Marine Casualty"]</ref>.

On January 10, 2007, the day of Bush's presidential address on his [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|plan to increase troop levels]] in [[Iraq]], Baucus spoke against the increases and called for a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops.<ref>{{cite web

===2008 re-election campaign===
{{main|Montana United States Senate election, 2008}}
Baucus sought re-election in 2008 in Montana, a state that has been undergoing political change since 2004 when it elected Democratic Governor [[Brian Schweitzer]], and then Democratic Senator [[Jon Tester]] in 2006 by a slim margin. Montana was the only state in the U.S. to switch a chamber of its legislature to [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] control in 2006. The legislative chamber had a one-seat Democratic majority that switched to a one-seat Republican majority.

Baucus raised a record amount of money for his 2008 re-election bid, 91 percent of which has come from individuals living outside of Montana.<ref>[http://www.missoulian.com/articles/2007/12/03/news/local/news03.txt Missoulian: Baucus's campaign fills coffers with out-of-state funds<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  As a result of his significant fund raising advantage, in the week that he announced his intentions to run for re-election, he opened eight state offices <U+2013> one more than he has official offices in the state. He also announced that he had hired 35 full-time campaign staff members.

He successfully won re-election in 2008.

===Visiting UAE and Viet Nam===
Baucus visited the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Viet Nam]] from 13 to 20 December 2008 on a mission to reassure the world about the US economy. The trip took him to [[Dubai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Hanoi]], and [[Ho Chi Minh City]]. Baucus said he would be looking for opportunities to expand US commerce with both countries in meetings with government officials and civil society leaders.<ref>[http://www.nguoi-viet.com/absolutenm/anmviewer.asp?a=88140&z=4 Ngh<U+1ECB> s<U+0129> Max Baucus <U+0111>i Vi<U+1EC7>t Nam v<U+00E0> C<U+00E1>c Ti<U+1EC3>u v<U+01B0><U+01A1>ng qu<U+1ED1>c <U+1EA2> R<U+1EAD>p Th<U+1ED1>ng nh<U+1EA5>t] {{vi}}</ref>

"America needs to rebuild its economy and engage the world smartly on trade, in a way that creates good-paying jobs here at home," said Baucus, who was slated to give speeches at [[Zayed University]] in Dubai and at the [[Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam]].

Baucus said the United States must strive to understand "boom economies" like the UAE, that relations with Viet Nam must remain "strong," and that he hoped to ensure that Asian markets "are as open as they should be to American products like beef," a key export of his home state of [[Montana]].
