'''Frederick II''' ({{lang-de|links=no|Friedrich}}; 24 January 1712{{spaced ndash}}17 August 1786) reigned over the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] from 1740 until 1786.<ref>Frederick was the third and last "[[King in Prussia]]"; beginning in 1772 he used the title "King of Prussia".</ref> The third [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] king, Frederick is best known for his military victories, his reorganization of Prussian armies, his innovative drills and tactics, and his final success against great odds in the [[Seven Years' War]]. He became known as '''Frederick the Great''' (''Friedrich der Gro<U+00DF>e'') and was nicknamed ''Der Alte Fritz'' ("Old [[Fritz (disambiguation)|<!-- Intentional link to disambiguation page -->Fritz]]").

In his youth, Frederick was more interested in music and philosophy than the art of war. He defied his authoritarian father, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]], and sought to run away with his close friend [[Hans Hermann von Katte]]. They were caught and the king nearly executed his son for "desertion"; he did force Frederick to watch the execution of Hans. Upon ascending to the Prussian throne, he attacked [[Austria]] and claimed [[Silesia]] during the [[Silesian Wars]], winning military acclaim for himself and [[Prussia]]. Near the end of his life, Frederick physically connected most of his realm by conquering Polish territories in the [[First Partition of Poland]]. He was an influential military theorist whose analysis emerged from his extensive personal battlefield experience and covered issues of strategy, tactics, mobility and logistics.

Frederick was a proponent of [[enlightened absolutism]]. He modernized the Prussian bureaucracy and civil service and pursued religious policies throughout his realm that ranged from tolerance to oppression.<ref>Stanislaw Salmonowicz, "Was Frederick the Great an Enlightened Absolute Ruler?" ''Polish Western Affairs'' (1981) 22#1 pp 56-69</ref> He reformed the judicial system and made it possible for men not of noble stock to become judges and senior bureaucrats. Some critics however point out his oppressive measures against conquered Polish subjects.<ref name="William Langer 1968 p 193"/><ref>Conquest: How Societies Overwhelm Others by David Day Oxford University Press,page 212, 2008</ref> 
Frederick supported arts and philosophers he favored, but at the same enacted several laws censoring the press. Frederick is buried at his favorite residence, [[Sanssouci]] in [[Potsdam]]. Because he died childless, Frederick was succeeded by his nephew, [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]], son of his brother, [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia|Augustus William]].

Nearly all 19th century German historians made Frederick into a romantic model of a glorified warrior, praising his leadership, administrative efficiency, devotion to duty and success in building up Prussia to a leading role in Europe. Historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] was unstinting in his praise of Frederick's "Heroic life, inspired by great ideas, filled with feats of arms...immortalized by the raising of the Prussian state to the rank of a power." [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] was even more extolling.<ref>G. P. Gooch, ''Frederick the Great: The Ruler, the Writer, the Man'' (1947) p 343-76; quote p 346</ref> He remained an admired historical figure through the [[German Empire]]'s crushing defeat in [[World War I|First World War]], and the Nazis glorified him as great German leader pre-figuring Hitler, but his reputation became far less favorable after the fall of the Nazi regime in 1945 in both [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]].<ref name="J<U+00FC>rgen Angelow 2004 pp 136-151">J<U+00FC>rgen Angelow, "Kontexte ungleicher Deutung," ''Zeitschrift fuer Religions und Geistesgeschichte'' (2004) 56#2 pp 136-151.</ref>

==Youth==
Frederick, the son of [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] and his wife, [[Sophia Dorothea of Hanover]], was born in Berlin on 24 January 1712. Frederick William I, popularly dubbed as the soldier-king, had developed a strong army led by his famous Potsdam Grenadier Guards and encouraged centralized government, but he possessed a violent temper and ruled Brandenburg-Prussia with absolute authority. In contrast, Frederick<U+2019>s mother Sophia was polite, charismatic and learned. 
Her father, [[George I of Great Britain|George Louis of Brunswick-L<U+00FC>neburg]], succeeded to the British throne as King George I in 1714.

[[File:Baptism of Frederick.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Baptism of Frederick (''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's New Monthly Magazine]]'', Vol.&nbsp;40, 1870)]]
The birth of Frederick was welcomed by his grandfather, [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]], with more than usual pleasure, as two of his grandsons had already died at an early age. With the death of his father in 1713, Frederick William became King of Prussia, thus making young Frederick the crown prince. The new king wished for his sons and daughters be educated not as royalty, but as simple folk. He had been educated by a [[French people|Frenchwoman]], Madame de Montbail, who later became [[Madame de Rocoulle]], and he wished that she educate his children. Frederick was brought up by [[Huguenot]] [[governess]]es and [[tutor]]s and learned French and German simultaneously. In spite of his father's desire that his education be entirely religious and pragmatic, the young Frederick, with the help of his tutor [[Jacques Duhan de Jandun|Jacques Duhan]], procured for himself a three thousand volume secret library of poetry, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman|Roman]] classics, and French philosophy to supplement his official lessons.<ref>MacDonogh, p. 37</ref>

Although Frederick William I was raised a devout [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], he feared he was not of the [[Unconditional election|elect]]. To avoid the possibility of Frederick being motivated by the same concerns, the king ordered that his heir not be taught about [[predestination]]. Although he was largely irreligious, Frederick adopted this tenet of Calvinism, despite the king's efforts. Some scholars have speculated that the crown prince did this to spite his father.<ref name="Mac35">MacDonogh, p. 35</ref>

==Crown Prince==
In 1732, Queen Sophia Dorothea attempted to arrange a dual marriage of Frederick and his sister [[Wilhelmine of Bayreuth|Wilhelmina]] with [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Amelia]] and [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Frederick]], the children of her brother, King [[George II of Great Britain]]. Fearing an alliance between Prussia and Great Britain, Field Marshal von [[Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff|Seckendorff]], the Austrian ambassador in Berlin, bribed the Prussian Minister of War, Field Marshal von [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Grumbkow|Grumbkow]], and the Prussian ambassador in London, Benjamin Reichenbach. The pair slandered the British and Prussian courts in the eyes of the two kings. Angered by the idea of the effete Frederick's being so honored by Britain, Frederick William presented impossible demands to the British, such as Prussia's acquiring [[Duchy of J<U+00FC>lich|J<U+00FC>lich]] and [[Berg (state)|Berg]], which led to the collapse of the marriage proposal.<ref name="Reiners33">Reiners, p. 33</ref>

[[File:Antoine Pesne - Frederick the Great as Crown Prince - WGA17377.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Frederick as Crown Prince 1739]]
Frederick found an ally in his sister, Wilhelmina, with whom he remained close for life. At age 16, Frederick had formed an attachment to the king's 13-year-old page, Peter Karl Christoph Keith. Wilhelmina recorded that the two "soon became inseparable. Keith was intelligent, but without education. He served my brother from feelings of real devotion, and kept him informed of all the king's actions."<ref name="Crompton">Crompton</ref>

When he was 18, Frederick plotted to flee to England with [[Hans Hermann von Katte]] and other junior army officers. While the royal retinue was near [[Mannheim]] in the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Robert Keith, Peter's brother, had an attack of conscience when the conspirators were preparing to escape and begged Frederick William for forgiveness on 5 August 1730;<ref name="Mac63">MacDonogh, p. 63</ref> Frederick and Katte were subsequently arrested and imprisoned in [[K<U+00FC>strin]]. Because they were army officers who had tried to flee Prussia for [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], Frederick William leveled an accusation of treason against the pair. The king threatened the crown prince with the death penalty, then considered forcing Frederick to renounce the succession in favour of his brother, [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia|Augustus William]], although either option would have been difficult to justify to the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name="Reiners41">Reiners, p. 41</ref> The king forced Frederick to watch the [[decapitation]] of his confidant Katte at K<U+00FC>strin on 6 November, leaving the crown prince to faint away and suffer hallucinations for the following two days.<ref name="ReferenceA">N. Mitford, ''Frederick the Great'', New York, 1970</ref>

Frederick was granted a royal pardon and released from his cell on 18 November, although he remained stripped of his military rank.<ref name="Reiners52">Reiners, p. 52</ref> Instead of returning to Berlin, however, he was forced to remain in K<U+00FC>strin and began rigorous schooling in statecraft and administration for the War and Estates Departments on 20 November. Tensions eased slightly when Frederick William visited K<U+00FC>strin a year later, and Frederick was allowed to visit Berlin on the occasion of his sister [[Wilhelmine of Bayreuth|Wilhelmina's]] marriage to Margrave [[Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Frederick]] of [[Principality of Bayreuth|Bayreuth]] on 20 November 1731. The crown prince returned to Berlin after finally being released from his tutelage at K<U+00FC>strin on 26 February 1732.

Frederick William considered marrying Frederick to [[Anna Leopoldovna|Elisabeth of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], the niece of [[Anna of Russia|Empress Anna of Russia]], but this plan was ardently opposed by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]. Frederick himself proposed marrying [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] in return for renouncing the succession. Instead, Eugene persuaded Frederick William, through Seckendorff, that the crown prince marry [[Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Bevern]], a Protestant relative of the Austrian [[Habsburg]]s.<ref name="Reiners63">Reiners, p. 63</ref> Although Frederick wrote to his sister that, "There can be neither love nor friendship between us,"<ref name="Crompton" /> and he considered suicide, he went along with the wedding on 12 June 1733. He had little in common with his bride and resented the political marriage as an example of the Austrian interference which had plagued Prussia since 1701. Once Frederick secured the throne in 1740, he prevented Elisabeth from visiting his court in [[Potsdam]], granting her instead [[Sch<U+00F6>nhausen Palace]] and apartments at the [[Berliner Stadtschloss]]. Frederick bestowed the title of the heir to the throne, "Prince of Prussia", on his brother [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia|Augustus William]]; despite this, his wife remained devoted to him.<ref name="Reiners69">Reiners, p. 69</ref> In their early married life, the royal couple resided at the [[Kronprinzenpalais|Crown Prince's Palace in Berlin]].

Frederick was restored to the [[Prussian Army]] as Colonel of the Regiment von der Goltz, stationed near [[Nauen]] and [[Neuruppin]]. When Prussia provided a contingent of troops to aid Austria during the [[War of the Polish Succession]], Frederick studied under [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] during the campaign against France on the [[Rhine]].<ref name="Reiners71">Reiners, p. 71</ref> Frederick William, weakened by [[gout]] brought about by the campaign, granted Frederick [[Schloss Rheinsberg]] in [[Rheinsberg]], north of Neuruppin. In Rheinsberg, Frederick assembled a small number of musicians, actors and other artists. He spent his time reading, watching dramatic plays, making and listening to music, and regarded this time as one of the happiest of his life. Frederick formed the "[[Bayard Order]]" to discuss warfare with his friends; [[Heinrich August de la Motte Fouqu<U+00E9>]] was made the grand master of the gatherings.

The works of [[Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli]], such as ''[[The Prince]]'', were considered a guideline for the behavior of a king in Frederick's age. In 1739, Frederick finished his ''[[Anti-Machiavel]]'', an idealistic refutation of Machiavelli. It was published anonymously in 1740, but Voltaire distributed it in [[Amsterdam]] to great popularity.<ref name="Mac125">MacDonogh, p. 125</ref> Frederick's years dedicated to the arts instead of politics ended upon the 1740 death of Frederick William and his inheritance of the Kingdom of Prussia.

==Reign (1740<U+2013>1786)==
[[File:Acprussiamap2.gif|thumb|Growth of [[Brandenburg]]-[[Prussia]] (1600<U+2013>1795).]]

Prince Frederick was only twenty-eight years of age when his father [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] died and he acceded to the throne of Prussia.<ref>Jay Luvaas, ''Frederick the Great on the Art of War'' (Free Press: New York, 1966) p. 3.</ref> Before his accession, Frederick was told by [[Jean le Rond D'Alembert|D'Alembert]], "The philosophers and the men of letters in every land have long looked upon you, Sire, as their leader and model." Such devotion, however, had to be tempered by political realities. When Frederick ascended the throne as "[[King in Prussia]]" in 1740, Prussia consisted of scattered territories, including [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]], [[County of Mark|Mark]], and [[County of Ravensberg|Ravensberg]] in the west of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[Vorpommern|Hither Pomerania]], and [[Farther Pomerania]] in the east of the Empire; and the former [[Duchy of Prussia]], outside of the Empire bordering the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. He was titled ''King in Prussia'' because this was only part of historic Prussia; he was to declare himself ''King '''of''' Prussia'' after acquiring most of the rest in 1772.

===The Silesian Wars===
Frederick's goal was to modernize and unite his vulnerably disconnected lands; toward this end, he fought wars mainly against Austria, whose [[Habsburg]] dynasty reigned as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s almost continuously from the 15th century until 1806. Frederick established Prussia as the fifth and smallest European [[great power]] by using the resources his frugal father had cultivated.

[[File:Hohenfriedeberg - Attack of Prussian Infantry - 1745.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Hohenfriedberg]], ''Attack of the Prussian Infantry'', by [[Carl R<U+00F6>chling]].]]
Upon succeeding to the throne on 31 May 1740 upon the death of his father,<ref>Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Emigma'' (Ticknor & Fields: New York, 1986) p. 141.</ref> and desiring the prosperous Austrian province of [[Silesia]], Frederick declined to endorse the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], a legal mechanism to ensure the inheritance of the Habsburg domains by [[Maria Theresa of Austria]]. Thus, upon the death of [[Emperor Charles VI]] of the Holy Roman Empire on 29 October 1740,<ref>Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'' (Ticknor & Fields: New York, 1986) p. 154.</ref> Frederick disputed the succession of Charles VI's 23 year-old daughter, [[Maria Theresa]], as the new Empress of the Holy Roman Empire and in particular to the Province of Silesia. Accordingly, the [[War of Austrian Succession]] began on 16 December 1740, when Frederick invaded and quickly occupied Silesia.<ref name="Jay Luvaas p. 3">Jay Luvaas, ''Frederick the Great on the Art of War'' p. 3.</ref> Frederick was worried that, if he did not move to occupy Silesia, [[Augustus III]], [[King of Poland]] and Elector of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], would seek to connect his own disparate lands through Silesia. Therefore, the Prussian king struck pre-emptively and quickly occupied Silesia, using as justification an obscure treaty from 1537 between the Hohenzollern and the [[Piast dynasty]] of [[Brzeg|Brieg (Brzeg)]].

Frederick had occupied Silesia, except for three fortresses at [[Glogau]], [[Brzeg|Brieg]] and [[Breslau]],<ref>Jay Luvaas, ''Frederick the Great on the Art of War'', p. 136.</ref> in just seven weeks, despite poor roads and bad weather.<ref>Jay Luvaas, ''Frederick the Great on the Art of War'', p. 3.</ref> The fortress at [[Ohlau]] fell to Frederick almost immediately and became the winter quarters for Frederick's army.<ref name="Jay Luvaas p. 3"/> In late March 1741, Frederick set out on his campaign again, but was forced to fall back by a sudden surprise attack by the Austrians. The first real battle Frederick faced in Silesia was the [[Battle of Mollwitz]] on 10 April 1741.<ref>Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', pp. 196-203.</ref> Though Frederick had actually served under Prince Eugene of Savoy, this was the first time he would command an army. Believing that his army had been defeated by the Austrians, Frederick sought to avoid capture and galloped away<ref>Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', p. 203.</ref> leaving Field Marshal [[Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin|Kurt Schwerin]] in command of the army. In actual fact, the Prussians had won the battle at the very moment that Frederick had fled. Frederick would later admit to humiliation at this breach of discipline<ref name="Jay Luvaas p. 4">Jay Luvaas, ''Frederick the Great on the Art of War'', p. 4.</ref> and would later state: "Mollwitz was my school."<ref>Jay Luvaas, ''Frederick the Great on the Art of War'', p, 46.</ref>

In early September 1741, the French entered the war against Austria and together with their allies, the [[Electorate of Bavaria]], marched on [[Vienna]].<ref>Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', p. 220.</ref> With Vienna under threat, the Austrians pulled troops out of Silesia to defend Vienna, while the remaining forces countered against the Prussian army of Frederick the Great on 17 May 1742. However, the Prussian [[Cavalry]] proved to be a powerful force and ultimately Prussia claimed victory. The battle became known as the [[Battle of Chotusitz]].<ref name="Jay Luvaas p. 4"/> This was only the second real battle in which Frederick had led troops since becoming king. Dramatically winning the Battle of Chotusitz, Frederick forced the Austrians to seek peace with him in the [[First Silesian War]] (1740<U+2013>1742). Peace terms of the [[Treaty of Breslau]] between the Austrians and the Prussians negotiated in June 1742, gave Prussia all of Silesia and Glatz County<ref>Jay Luvaas, ''Frederick the Great on the Art of War'' p. 4.</ref> with the Austrians retaining only that portion of Upper Silesia called "[[Czech Silesia|Austrian or Czech Silesia]]." Prussian possession of Silesia gave the kingdom control over the navigable [[Oder River]].

Frederick strongly suspected that the Austrians would start another war in an attempt to recover Silesia. Accordingly, he quickly made another alliance with the French and preemptively invaded [[Bohemia]] in August 1744.<ref>Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', p. 279.</ref> By late August 1744, all of Frederick's columns had crossed the Bohemian frontier.<ref>Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', p. 289.</ref> Frederick marched straight for Prague and laid siege to the city.<ref>Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', p. 292.</ref> Thus the Second Silesian War (1744<U+2013>1745) began. Frederick's artillery arrived before Prague on 8 September 1744.<ref>Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', p. 293.</ref> On 11 September 1744, the Prussians began a three-day artillery bombardment of Prague, in which Prague fell a few days later.<ref name="Jay Luvaas p. 4"/> Three days after the fall of Prague,<ref>Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', p. 294.</ref> Frederick's troops were again on the march into the heart of central Bohemia.<ref name="Jay Luvaas p. 4"/>

On 4 June 1745, Frederick trapped a joint force of Saxons and Austrians that had crossed the mountains to invade Silesia. After allowing them to cross the mountains ("If you want to catch a mouse, leave the trap open," Frederick is quoted as saying at the time.), Frederick then pinned the enemy force down and defeated them at the [[Battle of Hohenfriedberg]].<ref>Jay Luvaas, ''Frederick the Great on the Art of War'', p. 5.</ref> Pursuing the Austrians into Bohemia, Frederick caught the enemy on 30 September 1745 and delivered a flanking attack on the Austrian right wing at the [[Battle of Soor]] which set the Austrians to flight.<ref>Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', p. 337.</ref> Austrian morale was so bad at several points during the battle that Austrian Field-Marshal, Prince of Lobkowitz, was prompted to shoot three officers for cowardice.<ref>Nancy Mitford, ''Frederick the Great'', p.104.</ref> This defeat at Soor cast a pall over the coronation ceremonies just a few days later, crowning Maria Theresa as the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', p. 339.</ref> The Silesian Wars were, after all, a mere part of the larger international conflict known as the "[[War of the Austrian Succession]]" (1740-1748).

Once again, Frederick's stunning victory on the battlefield caused his enemies to seek peace terms. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Dresden]], signed on 25 December 1745, Austria was forced to adhere to the terms of the Treaty of Breslau giving Silesia to Prussia.<ref>Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', p. 347.</ref>
[[File:Battle rossbach trap.gif|thumb|right|[[Battle of Rossbach]], a tactical victory for Frederick.]]

===The Seven Years War===
[[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[Austria]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[France]], traditional enemies, allied together in the [[Diplomatic Revolution]] of 1756 following the collapse of the [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance]]. Frederick swiftly [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|made an alliance]] with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the [[Convention of Westminster]]. As neighboring countries began conspiring against him, Frederick was determined to strike first. On 29 August 1756 his well-prepared army crossed the frontier and preemptively invaded [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], thus beginning the [[Seven Years' War]], which lasted until 1763. He faced widespread criticism for his attack on neutral Saxony and for his forcible incorporation of the Saxony forces into the Prussian army following the [[Siege of Pirna]] in October 1756.

Facing a coalition which included Austria, France, [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and several minor German states, and having only Great Britain, [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse]], [[Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb<U+00FC>ttel|Brunswick]], and [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] as his allies, Frederick narrowly kept Prussia in the war despite having his territories repeatedly invaded. Frederick was frequently at the last gasp. On 6 January 1762, he wrote to [[Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein]], "We ought now to think of preserving for my nephew, by way of negotiation, whatever fragments of my territory we can save from the avidity of my enemies", which means, that he was resolved to seek a soldier's death on the first opportunity.
[[File:Batalla-kunersforf.gif|thumb|left|Frederick narrowly avoids capture by Cossacks at [[Battle of Kunersdorf|Kunersdorf]], 1759]]

The sudden death of Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] in January 1762, led to the succession of the pro-Prussian [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]]. This "[[Miracle of the House of Brandenburg]]" led to the collapse of the anti-Prussian coalition. Although Frederick did not gain any territory in the ensuing [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], his ability to retain Silesia during the Silesian Wars made him and Prussia popular throughout many German-speaking territories.

Late in his life Frederick also involved Prussia in the low-scale [[War of the Bavarian Succession]] in 1778, in which he stifled Austrian attempts to exchange the [[Austrian Netherlands]] for [[Bavaria]]. When Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] tried the scheme again in 1784, Frederick created the ''[[F<U+00FC>rstenbund]]'', allowing himself to be seen as a defender of German liberties, in contrast to his earlier role of attacking the imperial Habsburgs.
[[File:Friedrich der Grosse vor der Schlacht bei Torgau.jpg|thumb|Frederick before the [[Battle of Torgau]], 1760]]

Frederick frequently led his military forces personally and had six horses shot from under him during battle. Frederick is often admired as one of the greatest [[Military tactics|tactical]] geniuses of all time, especially for his usage of the [[oblique order]] of battle, in which attack is focused on one flank of the opposing line, allowing a local advantage to a perhaps overall weaker force. Even more important were his operational successes, especially preventing the unification of numerically superior opposing armies and being at the right place at the right time to keep enemy armies out of Prussian core territory.

An example of the place that Frederick holds in history as a ruler is seen in [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who saw the Prussian king as the greatest tactical genius of all time;<ref name="Koch126">Koch, p. 126</ref> after Napoleon's victory of the [[Fourth Coalition]] in 1807, he visited Frederick's tomb in [[Potsdam]] and remarked to his officers, "Gentlemen, if this man was still alive I would not be here".<ref name="Koch160">Koch, p. 160</ref> Frederick and Napoleon are perhaps the most admiringly quoted military leaders in [[Clausewitz]]' ''[[On War]]''. More than Frederick's use of the oblique order, Clausewitz praised particularly the quick and skillful movement of his troops.<ref>Carl von Clausewitz, ''On War''; see for instance Book 7, Chapter 13.</ref>

Frederick the Great's most notable and decisive military victories on the battlefield were the Battles of [[Battle of Hohenfriedberg|Hohenfriedberg]], [[Battle of Rossbach|Rossbach]], and [[Battle of Leuthen|Leuthen]]. 

Fredrick the Great believed that creating alliances was necessary, as Prussia did not have the resources of places like France or Austria, but he felt that the strength of the country was a true power that they could rely on. After the Seven Years' War, the Prussian military had a reputation all over Europe.<ref>Walter Goerlitz, ''History of the German General Staff'' (Praeger, New York 1959) p. 5.</ref>

===Military theorist===
Frederick was an influential military theorist whose analysis emerged from his extensive personal battlefield experience and covered issues of strategy, tactics, mobility and logistics.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jay Luvaas|title=Frederick The Great On The Art Of War|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iS4vE33il3gC&pg=PA18|year=2009|publisher=Da Capo Press|pages=18<U+2013>22}}</ref> Austrian co-ruler Emperor Joseph II wrote:

===First Partition of Poland===

[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 1.png|thumb|right|300px|The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] after the First Partition (1772)]]

Frederick despised Polish people since his youth, and numerous statements are known in which he expressed anti-Polish prejudice,<ref>Polish Western Affairs, Volume 32 Instytut Zachodni 1991, page 114</ref> calling Polish society "stupid" and stating that "all these people with surnames ending with -ski, deserve only contempt"<ref>Przegl<U+0105>d humanistyczny, Tom 22,Wydania 3-6 Pa<U+0144>stwowe Wydawn.

Frederick sought to legitimize the seizure of Poland as an enlightened and civilizing mission.<ref>Hans-J<U+00FC>rgen B<U+00F6>melburg, ''Friedrich II. zwischen Deutschland und Polen: Ereignis- und Erinnerungsgeschichte'' (Stuttgart: Alfred Kr<U+00F6>ner Verlag, 2011) p 88</ref>{{qn|date=December 2013}} He prepared the ground for dismemberment of Poland-Lithuania in 1752 at the latest, hoping to gain territorial bridge between Pomerania, Brandenburg and East Prussian provinces.<ref>Karin Friedrich, ''The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569<U+2013>1772'' p. 189</ref> Frederick was himself partly responsible for the weakness of the Polish government by having for many years circulated fake currency after obtaining Polish coin dies during the conquest of Saxony.

Lewitter says "The conflict over the rights of religious dissenters [in Poland] had led to civil war and foreign intervention." Out of 11 to 12 million people in Poland, 200,000 were Protestants and 600,000 Eastern Orthodox. The Protestants dissidents were still free to practice their religion although their schools were shut down.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} All dissidents could own property, but Poland increasingly reduced their civic rights after a period of considerable religious and political freedoms.<ref>The Emergence of the Eastern Powers, 1756-1775 by H.

M. Scott, page 177</ref> Frederick exploited this conflict as means to keep Poland weak and divided.<ref>The Emergence of the Eastern Powers, 1756-1775 By H. M. Scott, page 177-178</ref>

According to Scott, Frederick was eager to exploit Poland economically as his wider aim of increasing Prussia's wealth. Scott views this as a continuation of his previous violations of Polish territory in 1759 and 1761 and raids within Greater Poland until 1765. After acquiring dyes from which the currency of Poland was struck he issued debased Polish coins which drove money out of Poland into Hohenzollern territory <U+2013> it is estimated that it gained him 25 million [[thaler]]s of profit, while causing considerable monetary problems for Poland.<ref name="HamishScott176">Hamish M. Scott, ''The emergence of the Eastern powers 1756<U+2013>1775'' Cambridge University Press 2001, page 176</ref>

Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]] was staunchly opposed to Prussia. At the same time Frederick opposed Russia, whose troops had been allowed to freely cross the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] during the Seven Years' War. Despite their personal hostility Frederick and Catherine signed a defensive alliance in 1764 which guaranteed Prussian control of Silesia in return for Prussian support for Russia against Austria or the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Catherine's candidate for the Polish throne, [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August Poniatowski]], was then elected King of Poland in September of that year, and she controlled Polish politics.

[[File:portraitoffrederickthegreat.jpg|thumb|left|King Frederick II by [[Anna Dorothea Therbusch]], 1772.]]
Frederick became concerned, however, after Russia gained significant influence over Poland in the [[Repnin Sejm]] of 1767, an act which also threatened Austria and the [[Ottoman Turks]]. In the ensuing [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768<U+2013>1774|Russo-Turkish War]] (1768<U+2013>1774), Frederick supported Catherine with a subsidy of 300,000 rubles with reluctance as he did not want Russia to become even stronger through the acquisitions of Ottoman territory. The Prussian king achieved a rapprochement with Emperor Joseph and the Austrian chancellor [[Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz|Kaunitz]].

After Russia had occupied the [[Danubian Principalities]], Frederick's representative in Saint Petersburg, his brother [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1726<U+2013>1802)|Prince Henry]], convinced Frederick and Maria Theresa that the balance of power would be maintained by a tripartite division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth instead of Russia taking land from the Ottomans. They agreed to the [[Partitions of Poland|First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, which took place without a war. Frederick claimed most of the Polish province of [[Royal Prussia]]. Prussia annexed {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} and 600,000 inhabitants, the least of the partitioning powers.<ref name="Reiners250">Reiners, p.250</ref> However, the newly created province of [[West Prussia]] connected [[East Prussia]] and [[Farther Pomerania]] and granted Prussia control of the mouth of the [[Vistula River]]. Although Maria Theresa had reluctantly agreed to the partition, Frederick commented, "she cries, but she takes".<ref name="Ritter192">Ritter, p. 192</ref>

Frederick invited German immigrants to the province<ref name="Koch136">Koch, p. 136</ref> also hoping they would displace the Poles.<ref>Norbert Finszch and Dietmar Schirmer. ''Identity and Intolerance: Nationalism, Racism, and Xenophobia in Germany and the United States'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006). ISBN 0-521-59158-9</ref>

Frederick himself tried further propaganda justifying the Partitions, portraying the acquired provinces as underdeveloped and improved by Prussian rule. According to [[Karin Friedrich]] these claims were accepted for a long time in German historiography and sometimes still reflected in modern works.<ref>The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569<U+2013>1772 Karin Friedrich, page 16</ref>{{verify source|date=February 2011}}. Frederick however did not justify his conquests on ethnic basis, unlike later, nationalist, 19th-century German historians.<ref name="Clark, p. 232, 233">Clark, p. 232, 233</ref> Dismissive of contemporary German culture, Frederic was instead pursuing an imperialist policy, acting on the security interests of his state.<ref name="Clark, p. 232, 233" /> Frederick II settled 300,000 colonists on territories he had conquered, and enforced Germanization.<ref>Duch Rzeczypospolitej Jerzy Surdykowski <U+2013> 2001 Wydawn. Nauk. PWN, 2001, page 153</ref>

After the first partition Frederick engaged in plunder of Polish property, confiscating Polish estates and monasteries to support German colonization, and in 1786 he ordered forced buy outs of Polish holdings.<ref>Polszczyzna Niemc<U+00F3>w Maria Brzezina Pa<U+0144>stwowe Wydawnictwo.

Frederick looked upon many of his new Polish citizens with scorn, but was careful to conceal it when actually dealing with them. Frederick's long term goal was to remove all Polish people from his territories, both peasants and nobility, by expelling the nobles through oppressive tax system and "other measures" and by eradicating Polish national character of rural population by mixing them with Germans invited by thousands by promise of free land; by such means, Frederick boasted he would "gradually...get rid of all Poles".<ref>Conquest: How Societies Overwhelm Others David Day,page 212 Oxford University Press 2012</ref><ref>The Holocaust as Colonial Genocide: Hitler's 'Indian Wars' in the 'Wild East' Carroll P. Kakel II, page 29, Palgrave Macmillan page 213</ref>

He wrote that Poland had "the worst government in Europe with the exception of [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]]".<ref name="Ritter192" /> In 1773 he claimed in a letter to Voltaire: 
:I have abolished serfdom, reformed the savage laws, opened a canal which joins up all the main rivers; I have rebuilt those villages razed to the ground after the plague in 1709; I have drained the marshes and established a police force where none existed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nancy Mitford|title=Frederick the Great|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DJFZAAAAYAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Dutton|page=277}}</ref>
But in a letter to Henry, Frederick admitted that the Polish provinces were in good state:
:It is a very good and advantageous acquisition, both from a financial and a political point of view. In order to excite less jealousy I tell everyone that on my travels I have seen just sand, pine trees, [[heath]] land and Jews. Despite that there is a lot of work to be done; there is no order, and no planning and the towns are in a lamentable condition."<ref name="Mac363">MacDonogh, p. 363</ref>

He also sent in Jesuits to open schools.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mitford|title=Frederick the Great|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DJFZAAAAYAAJ|year=1984||page=277}}</ref> Frederick did befriend [[Ignacy Krasicki]], whom he asked to consecrate [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]] in 1773. He also advised his successors to learn Polish, a policy followed by the Hohenzollern dynasty until [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] decided not to let [[William II, German Emperor|William II]] learn the language.<ref name="Koch136" />

Frederick compared the Polish peasants to American Indians.<ref name="Ritter192" /> Polish authors have argued that already during his early days Frederick detested Poles; thus referring to them in a letter from 1735 as "dirty" and "vile apes."<ref>Przegl<U+0105>d humanistyczny, Tom 22,Wydania 3<U+2013>6 Jan Zygmunt Jakubowski

===Modernization of Prussia===
Frederick helped transform Prussia from a European backwater to an economically strong and politically reformed state. His conquest of Silesia gave Prussia's fledgling industries access to raw materials. He protected industries with high tariffs and minimal restrictions on domestic trade.<ref>William Langer, ''Western Civilization'' (1968) pp 192-94</ref>

With the help of French experts, he organized a system of [[indirect taxation]], which provided the state with more revenue than direct taxation. Frederick the Great commissioned [[Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky]] to promote the trade and<U+2014>to take on the competition with France<U+2014>put a silk factory where soon 1,500 persons found employment. Frederick the Great followed his recommendations in the field of toll levies and import restrictions. In 1763 when Gotzkowsky went broke during a financial crisis, which started in Amsterdam, Frederick took over his porcelain factory, known as [[Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin|KPM]], but refused to buy more of his paintings.<ref>W.O. Henderson, ''Studies in the Economic Policy of Frederick the Great'' (1963) ch 3 [http://books.google.com/books?id=5U3-AQAAQBAJ&pg=PT68 online]</ref>

[[File:FrederickderGro<U+00DF>eKn<U+00F6>tel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Frederick the Great during the [[Seven Years' War]], painting by [[Richard Kn<U+00F6>tel]].]]
One of Frederick's greatest achievements included the control of grain prices, whereby government storehouses would enable the civilian population to survive in needy regions, where the harvest was poor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ritter|first=Gerhard|authorlink=Gerhard Ritter|title=Frederick the Great: A Historical Profile|year=1974|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-02775-2|page=178}}</ref>

During the reign of Frederick, the effects of the Seven Years' War and the gaining of Silesia greatly changed the economy. The circulation of depreciated money kept prices high. To revalue the [[Thaler]], the Mint Edict of May 1763 was proposed. This stabilized the rates of depreciated coins that would not be accepted and provided for the payments of taxes in currency of prewar value. This was replaced in northern Germany by the ''[[Reichsthaler]]'', worth one-fourth of a Conventionsthaler. Prussia used a Thaler containing one-fourteenth of a Cologne mark of silver. Many other rulers soon followed the steps of Frederick in reforming their own currencies<U+2014>this resulted in a shortage of ready money thus lowering prices.<ref>W. O. Henderson. ''Studies in the economic policy of Frederick the Great''. Cass. London, 1963.</ref>

In 1781 Frederick decided to make coffee a royal monopoly and disabled soldiers were employed to spy on citizens sniffing in search of illegally roasted coffee, much to the annoyance of general population<ref>Jews Welcome Coffee: Tradition and Innovation in Early Modern Germany Robert Liberles page 29</ref>

Frederick gave his state a modern bureaucracy whose mainstay until 1760 was the able War and Finance Minister Adam Ludwig von Blumenthal, succeeded in 1764 by his nephew Joachim who ran the ministry to the end of the reign and beyond. Prussia's education system was seen as one of the best in Europe. He modernized the Prussian bureaucracy and civil service and promoted religious tolerance throughout his realm. He reformed the judicial system and abolished most uses of judicial torture. He made it possible for men not of noble stock to become judges and senior bureaucrats. Langer finds that, "Prussian justice became the most prompt and efficient in Europe."<ref name="William Langer 1968 p 193">William Langer, ''Western Civilization'' (1968) p 193</ref>

Frederick began titling himself "King ''of'' Prussia" after the acquisition of [[Royal Prussia]] ([[West Prussia]]) in 1772; the phrasing "[[King in Prussia|King ''in'' Prussia]]" had been used prior to this, beginning with the coronation of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]] in [[K<U+00F6>nigsberg]] in 1701.

===Religious policies===
While Frederick tolerated all faiths in his realm, Protestantism became the favored religion, and Catholics were not chosen for higher state positions<ref>A History of Modern Germany: 1648-1840, Volume 1 Hajo Holborn, page 274</ref> 

Frederick retained [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] as teachers in Silesia, [[Warmia]], and the [[Netze District]] after their suppression by [[Pope Clement XIV]]. Just like Catherine II, Frederick recognized the educational skills the Jesuits had as an asset for the nation.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.de/books?id=t1pQ4YG-TDIC&pg=PA310&dq=frederick+II+religious+tolerance&hl=de&ei=QVNmTeLGIIWw8gPxsvTIDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=true |title=Encyclopedia Of The Enlightenment|author= Ellen Judy Wilson, Peter Hanns Reill |publisher=Books.google.de |date= |accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> He was interested in attracting a diversity of skills to his country, whether from Jesuit teachers, Huguenot citizens, or Jewish merchants and bankers, particularly from [[Enlightenment Spain|Spain]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} He wanted development throughout the country, specifically in areas that he judged as needing a particular kind of development. Thus, he accepted countless Protestant weavers from [[Bohemia]], who were fleeing from the devoutly Catholic rule of Maria Theresa. Frederick granted the weavers freedom from taxes and military service.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.de/books?id=3LylIwXu0xsC&pg=PA419&dq=friedrich+II+religious+tolerance&hl=de&ei=WVBmTfWaIsOs8APVqYnIDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=friedrich%20II%20religious%20tolerance&f=true |title=Maverick Guide to Berlin|first= Jay |last=Brunhouse|publisher=Books.google.de |date= |accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> As an example of Frederick's practical-minded but not fully unprejudiced tolerance, Frederick wrote in his ''Testament politique'' that:

<blockquote>We have too many Jews in the towns. They are needed on the Polish border because in these areas Hebrews alone perform trade. As soon as you get away from the frontier, the Jews become a disadvantage, they form cliques, they deal in contraband and get up to all manner of rascally tricks which are detrimental to Christian burghers and merchants. I have never persecuted anyone from this or any other sect; I think, however, it would be prudent to pay attention, so that their numbers do not increase.<ref name="Mac347">MacDonogh, p. 347</ref></blockquote>

Jews on the Polish border were therefore encouraged to perform all the trade they could and received all the protection and support from the king as any other Prussian citizen.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The success in integrating the Jews into those areas of society that Frederick encouraged them in can be seen by the role played by [[Gerson von Bleichr<U+00F6>der]] in financing Bismarck's efforts to reunite Germany.<ref name="Stern">Stern, p. 19</ref>

In territories he conquered from Poland, he engaged in persecution of Polish Roman Catholic churches engaging in confiscation of goods and property, strict control of churches and interfering in church administration<ref>Polacy i Niemcy wobec siebie: postawy, opinie, stereotypy (1697-1815) : pr<U+00F3>ba zarysu Stanis<U+0142>aw Salmonowicz O<U+015B>rodek Bada<U+0144> Nauk. im. Wojciecha K<U+0119>trzy<U+0144>skiego w Olsztynie, 1993 page 88</ref>

[[File:Potsdam - Schloss Sanssouci.jpg|350px|thumb|South, or garden facade and ''[[corps de logis]]'' of [[Sanssouci]]]]
As under Frederick much wasteland was made arable, Prussia was looking for new colonists. Frederick repeatedly emphasized that nationality and religion were of no concern to him. This encouragement of immigration allowed Prussia's population to recover very quickly from the considerable losses it suffered during Frederick's three wars.<ref>Gerhard Ritter ''Frederick the Great: a historical profile''. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], 1975; p. 180</ref>

Like many leading figures in the Age of Enlightenment, Frederick was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and his membership legitimized the group and protected it against charges of subversion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Arthur Edward Waite|title=A New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, Volume I|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cmCYyetzBxUC&pg=PA286|year= 2013|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|pages=287<U+2013>8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=James Van Horn Melton|title=The Rise of the Public in Enlightenment Europe|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QZovusQ1SjYC&pg=PA267|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=267}}</ref>

===Architecture===
Frederick had famous buildings constructed in his capital, Berlin, most of which still exist today, such as the [[Berlin State Opera]], the Royal Library (today the [[Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin|State Library Berlin]]), [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]], and Prince Henry's Palace (now the site of [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]]). However, the king preferred spending his time in his summer residence at Potsdam, where he built the palace of [[Sanssouci]], the most important work of Northern German [[rococo]]. Sanssouci, which translates from French as "carefree" or "without worry", was a refuge for Frederick. "[[Frederician Rococo]]" developed under [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]].

===Music, arts and learning===
[[File:Adolph Menzel - Fl<U+00F6>tenkonzert Friedrichs des Gro<U+00DF>en in Sanssouci - Google Art Project.jpg|350px|thumb|''The Flute Concert of Sanssouci'' by [[Adolph Menzel]], 1852, depicts Frederick playing the flute in his music room at [[Sanssouci]]. [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C. P. E. Bach]] accompanies him on the [[harpsichord]].]]

Frederick was a patron of music as well as a gifted musician who played the [[flute|transverse flute]].<ref>Michael O'Loghlin, ''Frederick the Great and his Musicians: The Viola da Gamba Music of the Berlin School'' (2008)</ref> He composed 100 [[sonata]]s for the flute as well as four [[symphony|symphonies]]. The ''[[Hohenfriedberger Marsch]]'', a [[March (music)|military march]], was supposedly written by Frederick to commemorate his victory in the [[Battle of Hohenfriedberg]] during the Second Silesian War. His court musicians included [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C. P. E. Bach]], [[Johann Joachim Quantz]], [[Carl Heinrich Graun]] and [[Franz Benda]]. A meeting with [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] in 1747 in [[Potsdam]] led to Bach's writing ''[[The Musical Offering]]''.

Frederick also aspired to be a [[Philosopher king|Platonic philosopher king]] like the [[Roman emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]]. The king joined the [[freemasonry|Freemasons]] in 1738 and stood close to the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], corresponding with some of its key figures, such as [[Voltaire]]. The personal friendship of Frederick and Voltaire came to an unpleasant end after Voltaire's visit to Berlin and Potsdam in 1750<U+2013>1753, although they reconciled from afar in later years.

In addition to his native language, German, Frederick spoke French, Italian, English, Spanish and Portuguese; he also understood Latin, ancient and modern Greek, and Hebrew. Preferring instead French culture, Frederick disliked the German language, literature, and culture, explaining that German authors "pile parenthesis upon parenthesis, and often you find only at the end of an entire page the verb on which depends the meaning of the whole sentence".<ref name="Mac370">MacDonogh, p. 370</ref> His criticism led many German writers to attempt to impress Frederick with their writings in the German language and thus prove its worthiness. Many statesmen, including [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein|Baron vom und zum Stein]], were also inspired by Frederick's statesmanship. [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] gave his opinion of Frederick during a visit to [[Strasbourg|Strasbourg (Strassburg)]] by writing:

<blockquote>Well, we had not much to say in favour of the constitution of the Reich; we admitted that it consisted entirely of lawful misuses, but it rose therefore the higher over the present French constitution which is operating in a maze of unlawful misuses, whose government displays its energies in the wrong places and therefore has to face the challenge that a thorough change in the state of affairs is widely prophesied. In contrast when we looked towards the north, from there shone Frederick, the Pole Star, around whom Germany, Europe, even the world seemed to turn ...<ref name="Koch138">Koch, p. 138</ref></blockquote>

===Environment and agriculture===
Frederick the Great was keenly interested in land use, especially draining swamps and opening new farmland for colonizers who would increase the kingdom's food supply. He called it "peopling Prussia" (''Peuplierungspolitik''). About a thousand new villages were founded in his reign that attracted 300,000 immigrants from outside Prussia. He told Voltaire, "Whoever improves the soil, cultivates land lying waste and drains swamps, is making conquests from barbarism".<ref>David Blackbourn, "Conquests from Barbarism: Taming Nature in Frederick the Great's Prussia," in Christof Mauch, ed., ''Nature in German History'' (2004) pp 10-30, [http://books.google.com/books?id=n3Fttkn89iwC quote p. 13]</ref> Using improved technology enabled him to create new farmland through a massive drainage program in the country's [[Oderbruch]] marsh-land. This program created roughly 150,000 acres of new farmland, but also eliminated vast swaths of natural habitat, destroyed the region's biodiversity, and displaced numerous native communities. Frederick saw as this project as the "taming" and "conquering" of nature, which, in its wild form, he regarded as "useless" and "barbarous" (an attitude that reflected his enlightenment-era, rationalist sensibilities).<ref>David Blackbourn, "Conquests from Barbarism: Taming Nature in Frederick the Great's Prussia,"; [http://www.oslo2000.uio.no/program/papers/s18/s18-blackbourn.pdf "Conquests from Barbarism: Interpreting Land Reclamation in 18th Century Prussia" earlier version online ]</ref> He presided over the construction of canals for bringing crops to market, and introduced new crops, especially the potato and the turnip, to the country.<ref>{{cite news|last=Niemann|first=Christoph|title=The Legend of the Potato King|url=http://niemann.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/the-legend-of-the-potato-king/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 October 2012}}</ref> [[File:Der K<U+00F6>nig <U+00FC>berall2.JPG|thumb|right|Frederick the Great inspects the potato harvest outside [[Neustettin]], Eastern Pomerania]]

The king founded the first veterinary school in Germany. Unusual for his time and aristocratic background, he criticized hunting as cruel, rough and uneducated. He loved dogs and his horse and wanted to be buried with his greyhounds. In 1752 he wrote to his sister that people indifferent to loyal animals would not be more grateful to other humans and that it was better to be too sensitive than too harsh. He was also close to nature and issued decrees to protect plants.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/unbekannte-seiten-friedrichs-des-grossen-friedrich-ist-der-begruender-der-tiermedizin-in-deutschland-1.1581993 | work=S<U+00FC>ddeutsche Zeitung | title=Friedrich ist der Begr<U+00FC>nder der Tiermedizin in Deutschland | date=24 January 2013}}</ref>

===Berlin Academy===
[[File:Frederick's first interview with Voltaire.JPG|thumb|Frederick's first interview with the philosopher [[Voltaire]]<ref>''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's New Monthly Magazine]]'', Vol.&nbsp;40, 1870</ref>]]

Aarsleff notes that before Frederick came to the throne in 1740, the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] (Berlin Academy) was overshadowed by similar bodies in London and Paris. Frederick made French the official language and speculative philosophy the most important topic of study. The membership was strong in mathematics and philosophy and included [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Jean D'Alembert]], [[Pierre-Louis de Maupertuis]], and [[Etienne de Condillac]]. However the Academy was in a crisis for two decades at mid-century, due to scandals and internal rivalries such as the debates between Newtonianism and Leibnizian views, and the personality conflict between Voltaire and Maupertuis. At a higher level Maupertuis, the director 1746<U+2013>59 and a monarchist, argued that the action of individuals was shaped by the character of the institution that contained them, and they worked for the glory of the state. By contrast d' Alembert took a republican rather than monarchical approach and emphasized the international [[Republic of Letters]] as the vehicle for scientific advance.<ref>Mary Terrall, "The Culture of Science in Frederick the Great's Berlin," ''History of Science,'' Dec 1990, Vol. 28 Issue 4, pp. 333<U+2013>364</ref> By 1789, however, the academy had gained an international repute while making major contributions to German culture and thought. Frederick invited [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] to succeed [[Leonhard Euler]] at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]]; both were world-class mathematicians. Other intellectuals attracted to the philosopher's kingdom were [[Francesco Algarotti]], [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens|d'Argens]], and [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]]. [[Immanuel Kant]] published religious writings in Berlin which would have been censored elsewhere in Europe.<ref>Hans Aarsleff, "The Berlin Academy under Frederick the Great," ''History of the Human Sciences,'' May 1989, Vol. 2 Issue 2, pp. 193<U+2013>206</ref>

===Sexuality===
Many historians have considered whether Frederick the Great was [[homosexual]] or [[bisexual]] (and perhaps possibly [[celibacy|celibate]]), and his relationship with [[Hans Hermann von Katte]] was widely speculated in the Prussian court to be romantic.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> After Katte's execution by Frederick's father, Frederick was forced to marry [[Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Bevern]], with whom he had no children. He immediately separated from his wife when Frederick William I died in 1740. In later years, Frederick would pay his wife formal visits only once a year.<ref>L. Reiners, ''Frederick the Great'', New York, 1960</ref>

Frederick spent much of his time at Sanssouci, his favourite residence in Potsdam. The grounds there included a Friendship Temple (built as a memorial to his favourite sister, [[Princess Wilhelmine of Prussia|Wilhelmine]]), and celebrating the homoerotic attachments of Greek Antiquity, decorated with portraits of [[Orestes]] and [[Pylades]], among others.<ref>J.D. Steakley, Sodomy in Enlightenment Prussia, ''Journal of Homosexuality'', 16, 1/2 (1988): 163<U+2013>175</ref> At Sanssouci Frederick entertained his most privileged guests, especially the French philosopher Voltaire, whom he asked in 1750 to come to live with him. The correspondence between Frederick and Voltaire, which spanned almost 50 years, was marked by mutual intellectual fascination. In person, however, their friendship was often contentious, as Voltaire abhorred Frederick's militarism. Voltaire's angry attack on Maupertuis, the President of Frederick's academy, provoked Frederick to burn the pamphlet publicly and put Voltaire under house arrest. Voltaire was accused by some of anonymously publishing ''The Private Life of the King of Prussia'', wittily claiming Frederick's homosexuality and parade of male lovers, after he had left Prussia. Frederick neither admitted nor denied the contents of the book, nor ever accused Voltaire of having written it. Some years later, Voltaire and Frederick resumed their correspondence and eventually aired their mutual recriminations, to end as friends once more.<ref>S. W. Henderson, "Frederick the Great of Prussia: a homophile perspective", ''Gai Saber''; 1,1 (1977): 46<U+2013>54.</ref>

Other historians disagree on the nature of Frederick's sexuality, saying that Frederick's writings indicate that he simply had greater priorities than women. In 2011, an unpublished erotic poem by Frederick was discovered amongst his letters; it was written, according to correspondence with Voltaire, in response to an Italian friend's contention that northern Europeans were not as passionate as southern Europeans.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14945573 | work=BBC News | title=Prussian King Frederick the Great's erotic poem found | date=16 September 2011}}</ref> Frederick's physician, Johann Georg Ritter von Zimmermann, claimed that the king let rumors of homosexuality appear to be true in order to avoid the public knowing that his genitalia were harmed by "a cruel surgical operation" to save his life from an unnamed venereal disease.<ref>Snyder, pp. 132<U+2013>136</ref> Historian [[Christopher Clark]] concludes Frederick "may well have abstained from sexual acts with anyone of either sex after his accession to the throne, and possibly even before. But if he did not do it, he certainly talked about it; the conversation of the inner court circle around him was peppered with homoerotic banter."<ref>Clark, p. 188</ref>

===Later years===
In 1785, Frederick II signed a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (Prussia<U+2013>United States)|Treaty of amity and commerce]] with the United States of America, recognizing the independence of the new nation. The agreement included a novel clause, whereby the two leaders of the executive branches of either country guaranteed a special and humane detention for [[prisoners of war]]<ref>[http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga1-860606.htm The text of the treaty]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] signed on behalf of the United States in Paris, [[Benjamin Franklin]] in [[Passy]], and [[John Adams]] in London; on behalf of the king of Prussia, [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Thulemeyer]] signed the agreement in [[Den Haag]].</ref>
Near the end of his life Frederick grew increasingly solitary. His circle of friends at Sanssouci gradually died off without replacements, and Frederick became increasingly critical and arbitrary, to the frustration of the civil service and officer corps. The populace of Berlin always cheered the king when he returned to the city from provincial tours or military reviews, but Frederick took no pleasure from his popularity with the common folk, preferring instead the company of his pet [[Italian greyhound]]s,<ref name="Ritter200">Ritter, p. 200</ref> whom he referred to as his '[[Madame de Pompadour|marquises de Pompadour]]' as a jibe at the French royal mistress.<ref name="Mac366">MacDonogh, p. 366</ref> Frederick died in an armchair in his study in the palace of Sanssouci on 17 August 1786.

[[File:Friedrich der grosse grab hg.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Frederick at [[Sanssouci]].]]

Frederick had wished to be buried next to his greyhounds on the vineyard terrace on the side of the corps de logis of Sanssouci. His nephew and successor [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] instead ordered the body to be entombed next to his father in the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Potsdam Garrison Church]]. Near the end of World War II, Hitler ordered Frederick's coffin to be hidden in a salt mine to protect it from destruction. The US Army relocated them to [[Burg Hohenzollern]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_9sImYb5e1AC&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Nazi Plunder: Great Treasure Stories of World War II|first= Kenneth D.|last= Alford|year= 2000|publisher= Da Capo Press| page= 102}}</ref> After German reunification, the body was entombed in the Kaiser Friedrich Mausoleum in Sanssouci's [[Church of Peace (Sanssouci)|Church of Peace]]. On the 205th anniversary of his death, on 17 August 1991, Frederick's casket lay in state in the court of honor of Sanssouci, covered by a Prussian flag and escorted by a [[Bundeswehr]] guard of honor. After nightfall, Frederick's body was finally laid to rest on the terrace of the vineyard of Sanssouci, without pomp, in accordance with his last will.

==Historiography and memory==
Frederick in German memory became a great national hero in 19th century Germany; many Germans said "he was the greatest monarch in modern history."<ref>G. P. Gooch, ''Frederick the Great: The Ruler, the Writer, the Man'' (1947) p 343</ref>

German historians often made him the romantic model of a glorified warrior, praising his leadership, administrative efficiency, devotion to duty and success in building up Prussia to a leading role in Europe. Historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] was unstinting in his praise of Frederick's "Heroic life, inspired by great ideas, filled with feats of arms...immortalized by the raising of the Prussian state to the rank of a power."<ref>G. P. Gooch, ''Frederick the Great'' (1947) p 346</ref> [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] was even more favorable. Historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] was a leading nationalist who presented Frederick as the greatest German in recent centuries. [[Onno Klopp]] was one of the few German historians of the 19th century who denigrated and ridiculed Frederick. The novelist [[Thomas Mann]] in 1914 also attacked Frederick, agreeing with Empress Maria Theresa that he was a wicked man with a bad heart who robbed Austria of Silesia and the alliance against him was his own fault. With Germany humiliated after the World War, Frederick's popularity remained high. 
In 1933-45 the Nazis glorified him as pre-figuring Hitler, and late in the war presented Frederick as holding out hope than another miracle would again save Germany at the last moment. The conservative nationalist [[Gerhard Ritter]] condemned the brutal seizure in the first partition of Poland, but praised the results as beneficial to the Polish people.<ref>Gooch, ''Frederick the Great'' (1947) pp 343-76</ref><ref>Ritter, ''Frederick the Great'' pp 191-93</ref> Ritter's biography of Frederick, published in 1936, was designed as a challenge to Nazi ideology which said there was a continuity between Frederick and Hitler. Dorpalen says "The book was indeed a very courageous indictment of Hitler's irrationalism and recklessness, his ideological fanaticism and insatiable lust for power."<ref>Andreas Dorpalen, "Historiography as History: The Work of Gerhard Ritter." ''Journal of Modern History'' (1962) (March, 1962), p 9</ref> Frederick's reputation was sharply downgraded after 1945 in both East and West Germany.<ref name="J<U+00FC>rgen Angelow 2004 pp 136-151"/>

His major place in British historiography was set by [[Thomas Carlyle]] in ''History of Frederick the Great'' (8 vol. 1858-65), emphasizing the power of one great "hero" to shape history.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Bentley|title=Companion to Historiography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9Aqvun1XojsC&pg=PA398|year=2002|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=398<U+2013>400, 414<U+2013>15}}</ref> In the 21st century his reputation as a warrior remains strong among military historians.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dennis Showalter|title=Frederick the Great: A Military History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WvpiFTmWnaQC&pg=PT42|year=2012|publisher=Casemate Publishers|page=Introduction}}</ref><ref>Elizabeth Krimmer and Patricia Anne Simpson, eds. ''Enlightened War: German Theories and Cultures of Warfare from Frederick the Great to Clausewitz'' (Rochester, N.Y.: Camden House, 2011)</ref>

In the technical historiography, historians continue to debate the issue of continuity versus innovation. How much of the king's achievement was based on developments already underway, and how much can be attribute to his initiative? How closely linked was he to [[The Enlightenment]]? Is the category of "Enlightened Absolutism" still useful for the scholar?<ref>T.C.W. Blanning, "Frederick the Great" in H.M. Scott, ed., ''Enlightened Absolutism'' (1990) pp 265-88</ref><ref>Peter Paret, "Frederick the Great: A Singular Life, Variably Reflected," ''Historically Speaking'' (Jan. 2012) 13#1 pp 29-33</ref>

In the 2004 German film ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Der Untergang]]'' (''Downfall''), [[Adolf Hitler]] is shown sitting in a dark room forlornly gazing at a painting of Frederick, possibly a reference to the dictator's fading hopes for another [[Miracle of the House of Brandenburg]]. This is based on an incident witnessed by [[Rochus Misch]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Schnoor, Stefan and Klinge, Boris|title=The Last Survivor of Hitler's Downfall <U+2013> The F<U+00FC>hrer's Bodyguard Gives Last Interview|work=Daily Express|date=15 May 2011|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/246754/The-last-survivor-of-Hitler-s-downfall-in-the-bunker|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref>

The 2012 German made-for-television film ''Friedrich <U+2013> ein deutscher K<U+00F6>nig'' ('''Frederick <U+2013> a German King'') starred the actresses Katharina Thalbach and her daughter Anna Thalbach in the title roles as the old and young king respectively.

===Portrayal in ''Barry Lyndon''===
Although Frederick is never seen on screen, he is mentioned several times in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1975 film ''[[Barry Lyndon]]''. In the film, he is referred to as "the great and illustrious Frederick" and his army is both praised and criticized, as in this quotation: "During the five years which the war had now lasted, the great and illustrious Frederick had so exhausted the males of his kingdom that he had to employ scores of recruiters who would hesitate at no crime, including kidnapping, to keep supplied those brilliant regiments of his with food for powder."

===Other===
Frederick has been included in the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' computer game series, the computer games ''[[Age of Empires III]]'', ''[[Empire Earth II]]'', ''[[Empire: Total War]]'', and the board games ''[[Friedrich (board game)|Friedrich]]''and Soldier Kings.<ref>[http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12891/friedrich "Frederick the Great"]. ''Board Games Geek''. Retrieved 4 June 2014.</ref>

Frederick is also depicted in the webcomic ''[[Axis Powers Hetalia]]'' as a dear friend of Gilbert Beilschmidt, the anthropomorphic personification of [[Prussia]].
