'''Severe Tropical Cyclone Vaianu''' (RSMC Nadi designation: '''12F''', JTWC designation: '''11P''') was the fourth named [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[2005<U+2013>06 South Pacific cyclone season]]. The system formed on February 11, and moved generally towards  the south throughout its life. Vaianu ultimately peaked with winds corresponding to Category 1 status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]], and passed between [[Fiji]] and [[Tonga]]. Moving into cooler waters, the storm dissipated on February 16. Although the cyclone avoided land for the most part, it caused heavy rainfall and gusty winds in portions of Tonga. Flooding hit the capital city of [[Nuku'alofa]], and on some islands, the storm destroyed crops.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Vaianu 2006 track.png}}
Late on February 9, the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre]] (RSMC) in [[Nadi, Fiji]] reported that Tropical Depression 12F had developed within a convergence zone which was located about 140&nbsp;km (90&nbsp;miles) to the northeast of [[Vanua Levu]].<ref name="GP"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mtarchive.geol.iastate.edu/2006/02/09/text/Severe/Severe_09.txt|title=Severe Weather Warnings issued on 2006-02-09|date=February 9, 2006|publisher=MT Archive|accessdate=January 30, 2010}}</ref> The depression tracked southeastward, although further development was initially inhibited by [[wind shear]]. During the next day, the depression turned towards the southeast and moved into a more favorable environment for intensification.<ref name="GP"/> It was then designated as Tropical Depression 11P at 1800 [[UTC]] by the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC).<ref name="JTWC">{{cite web|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|accessdate=January 27, 2010|title=JTWC Best Track for Cyclone Vaianu|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/best_tracks/2006/2006s-bsh/bsh112006.txt}}</ref> On February 11, the system significantly organized,<ref name="GP">{{cite web|author=Simon Clarke|publisher=Typhoon 2000|date=April 25, 2006|accessdate=January 27, 2010|title=Monthly Tropical Weather Summary for February 2006|url=http://www.typhoon2000.ph/garyp_mgtcs/feb06sum.htm}}</ref> and at 1200 UTC that day, RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the [[Tropical_cyclone_scales#Australia|Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale]]; it was assigned the name Vaianu.<ref name="TCR">{{cite web|author=|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service|date=September 8, 2007|accessdate=January 27, 2010|title=Tropical Cyclone Summary: 2005-2006 Season|url=http://www.met.gov.fj/documents/TC_Seasonal_Summary_05-061190690520.pdf|format=[[PDF]]}}</ref>

At the time of being upgraded to a cyclone, Vaianu was situated about {{convert|190|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northwest of [[Vava<U+02BB>u]], a [[Tonga]] island chain.<ref name="TCR"/> The storm turned southwestward under the steering currents of a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to the southeast.<ref name="GP"/> The JTWC recognized the system as a tropical storm on February 12, and upgraded it into a tropical cyclone shortly thereafter.<ref name="JTWC"/> Vaianu continued to strengthen, and passed west of Tonga.<ref name="GP"/> The JTWC reported that the cyclone peaked in intensity at 1200 UTC on February 13, with maximum sustained 1-minute winds of 140&nbsp;km/h (85&nbsp;mph).<ref name="JTWC"/> RSMC Nadi assessed the storm as having peaked slightly later, with 10-minute winds of 130&nbsp;km/h (80&nbsp;mph), which made it a Category&nbsp;3 severe tropical cyclone.<ref name="TCR"/>

The storm held its strength for some time as it moved southward between [[Ono-i-Lau]] and [[Tongatapu]]. Beginning to accelerate, Vaianu entered the area of responsibility of the [[Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre]] in [[Wellington|Wellington, New Zealand]].<ref name="TCR"/> It curved southeastward and slowly deteroirated due to increasing wind shear and colder sea surface temperatures.<ref name="GP"/> The JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm on February 15,<ref name="JTWC"/> and by the next day it was undergoing an [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical transition]].<ref name="GP"/> At 0600 UTC, the JTWC classified it as extratropical,<ref name="JTWC"/> but it remained a powerful storm system for several days as it tracked over the open ocean.<ref name="GP"/>

==Preparations and impact==
Early on February 10, RSMC Nadi placed [[Niuafo'ou]] and [[Niuatoputapu]] under a tropical cyclone alert, before early the next day extending the alert to the whole of Tonga.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mtarchive.geol.iastate.edu/2006/02/10/text/Severe/Severe_10.txt|title=Severe Weather Warnings issued on 2006-02-10|date=February 10, 2006|publisher=MT Archive|accessdate=January 27, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Ads11/02">{{cite web|url=http://mtarchive.geol.iastate.edu/2006/02/11/text/Severe/Severe_11.txt|title=Severe Weather Warnings issued on 2006-02-11|date=February 11, 2006|publisher=MT Archive|accessdate=January 27, 2010}}</ref> Later that day the [[Vavau]], [[Haapai]], and [[Nomuka]] islands were placed under a gale warning.<ref name="Ads11/02"/> The warnings stayed in force until late on February 12 when the gale warning was canceled, and concurrently, southern Tonga was placed under a tropical cyclone warning.<ref name="Ads11/02"/><ref name="Ads12/02">{{cite web|url=http://mtarchive.geol.iastate.edu/2006/02/12/text/Severe/Severe_12.txt|title=Severe Weather Warnings issued on 2006-02-12|date=February 12, 2006|publisher=MT Archive|accessdate=January 27, 2010}}</ref> These warnings were canceled on February 14.<ref name="Ads13/02">{{cite web|url=http://mtarchive.geol.iastate.edu/2006/02/13/text/Severe/Severe_13.txt|title=Severe Weather Warnings issued on 2006-02-13|date=February 13, 2006|publisher=MT Archive|accessdate=January 27, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Ads14/02">{{cite web|url=http://mtarchive.geol.iastate.edu/2006/02/14/text/Severe/Severe_14.txt|title=Severe Weather Warnings issued on 2006-02-14|date=February 14, 2006|publisher=MT Archive|accessdate=January 27, 2010}}</ref> During the cyclone, RSMC Nadi placed the [[Lau Islands]] under a strong wind warning, and a damaging swell warning was declared for [[Fiji]].<ref name="TCR"/> Businesses in [[Nuku'alofa]] closed as the storm passed by.<ref name="GP"/> 

At the Fua<U+02BB>amotu station, sustained winds blew at {{convert|68|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} during the worst of the storm, with gusts reaching {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.

Nonetheless, portions of Tongan experienced torrential rainfall and high winds. On Tongatapu and [[Eua (Tonga)|Eua]], the storm inflicted extensive crop damage, and it is estimated that 70% of the banana crop was destroyed. While little property damage took place, the storm caused power outages across its path that took up a week to fully restore.<ref name="GP"/>  In [[Nuku'alofa]], the capital of Tonga, flooding of low-lying areas reportedly shut down the city for two days.<ref name="GP"/> The high winds brought down trees and dispersed debris throughout the region, while schools were forced to close.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|title=Big clean-up for Tongan citizens after storm|date=February 15, 2006|publisher=''The New Zealand Herald''|accessdate=January 27, 2010|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10368363}}</ref>
