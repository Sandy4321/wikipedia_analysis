'''Zhang Nan''' (died 222), [[courtesy name]] '''Wenjin''', was a military general of the state of [[Shu Han]] in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.

==Life==
Zhang Nan was originally from [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]]. He served as a military officer under [[Liu Bei]], the founding emperor of the state of [[Shu Han]] in the Three Kingdoms era, and accompanied him to Yi Province (covering present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]) in the early 210s.<ref>(<U+6587><U+9032><U+540D><U+5357><U+FF0C><U+4EA6><U+81EA><U+834A><U+5DDE><U+96A8><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+5165><U+8700><U+FF0C><U+9818><U+5175><U+5F9E><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+5F81><U+5433><U+FF0C><U+8207><U+7FD2><U+4FF1><U+6B7B><U+3002>) Pei Songzhi's annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 45.</ref>

In 221, Liu Bei attacked his former ally, [[Sun Quan]] (the founding emperor of [[Eastern Wu]]), after the latter broke their alliance and seized his territories in Jing Province and executed his general [[Guan Yu]]. Zhang Nan participated in this campaign, which led to the [[Battle of Xiaoting]] (or Battle of Yiling) of 221<U+2013>222, and was appointed as the Vanguard (<U+524D><U+90E8><U+7763>) of the Shu army. In the summer of 222, Sun Quan's forces, led by [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]], suddenly launched a counter-attack after about six months of stalemate since the beginning of 222.<ref>(<U+6F22><U+4EBA><U+81EA><U+5DEB><U+5CFD><U+5EFA><U+5E73><U+9023><U+71DF><U+81F3><U+5937><U+9675><U+754C><U+FF0C><U+7ACB><U+6578><U+5341><U+5C6F><U+FF0C><U+4EE5><U+99AE><U+7FD2><U+70BA><U+5927><U+7763><U+FF0C><U+5F35><U+5357><U+70BA><U+524D><U+90E8><U+7763><U+FF0C><U+81EA><U+6B63><U+6708><U+8207><U+5433><U+76F8><U+62D2><U+FF0C><U+81F3><U+516D><U+6708><U+4E0D><U+6C7A><U+3002>) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref> Zhang Nan was killed in action.<ref>(<U+521D><U+FF0C><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+5FFF><U+5B6B><U+6B0A><U+4E4B><U+8972><U+95DC><U+7FBD><U+FF0C><U+5C07><U+6771><U+5F81><U+FF0C><U+79CB><U+4E03><U+6708><U+FF0C><U+9042><U+5E25><U+8AF8><U+8ECD><U+4F10><U+5433><U+3002> ... <U+5F8C><U+5341><U+9918><U+65E5><U+FF0C><U+9678><U+8B70><U+5927><U+7834><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+8ECD><U+65BC><U+7307><U+4EAD><U+FF0C><U+5C07><U+8ECD><U+99AE><U+7FD2><U+3001><U+5F35><U+5357><U+7B49><U+7686><U+6C92><U+3002>) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 32.</ref>
