'''Dark cabaret''' is a [[music genre]] that has influences from German [[cabaret]], [[burlesque]], [[vaudeville]], [[folk music|folk]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[deathrock]], [[gothic rock]] and [[darkwave]] music styles, as well as [[Film noir]].  

Dark cabaret is characterized by driving [[piano]] and by deep female or male vocals influenced by the style of [[Kurt Weill]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Cole Porter]], [[Danny Elfman]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[PJ Harvey]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Tom Lehrer]], [[Nick Cave]], and even [[Roxy Music]]/[[Brian Eno]].  Alternatively, the music may center around another instrument such as the [[cello]] or [[accordion]], or even the voice.  

==History==
Perhaps the earliest stage of the modern dark cabaret genre dates back to 1974, when Nico released her album, ''[[The End (Nico album)|The End]]''.  Her songs, "You Forgot To Answer" and "Secret Side"  were much ahead of the Dark Cabaret sound which was to come.  [[Marc Almond]] also was an early contributor to this direction. [[The Virgin Prunes]] bordered the sound at times, and [[Nina Hagen]]'s [[punk opera]] style closed in on it further; but it was [[Rozz Williams]], the former lead singer of [[Christian Death]], who took the style in a more fully cabaret and darker direction a decade later. His release with Gitane Demone, ''Dream Home Heartache'' in 1995 on Triple X Records (an allusion to a song by [[Roxy Music]]) was perhaps the foundation for a new sound in the [[goth]] movement. The songs "Christian Circus Joe" and the jazzier "Psychic Sarah" also appeared by the [[Sex Gang Children]] in 1997, demonstrating the cabaret-style infusion into a slowly evolving post-punk art goth sound.  [[Lydia Lunch]] also regularly produces work which falls into this category, most notably on her 1980 album, ''Queen of Siam''.

San Francisco-based chanteuse [[Jill Tracy]] released ''Diabolical Streak'' in 1999 which quickly garnered two California Music Award nominations, as well as the SIBL international Grand Prize for songwriting. ''Diabolical Streak'' was hailed by Canada's Shift Magazine as one of the ''"Top 10 Neo-Cabaret albums of all time."''

Nicki Jaine and Amoree Lovell are also striking examples of the genre.  [[Katzenjammer Kabarett]] once referred to themselves as "deathrock cabaret", to which [[Two Ton Boa]] might also belong, but have recently changed their self-description to "[[post-punk]] cabaret" in recognition of their wideley varying incorporations.

[[Danny Elfman]]'s dark cabaret influence is especially noted in his scores and character voices in the films ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', ''[[Chicago (2002 movie)|Chicago]]'', and ''[[Tim Burton's Corpse Bride]]''.

London cabaret act, the [[Tiger Lillies]], have implemented dark themes and imagery, but do not typically convey a dark sound. Nonetheless, ''A Gorey End'', their 2003 release featuring the [[Kronos Quartet]] and posthumous lyrical contributions from [[Edward Gorey]], helped to create a greater awareness of the uprising genre by earning a Grammy nomination.

The most recent act to surface and solidify this style are [[The Dresden Dolls]]. In September 2005, [[Projekt Records]] released a compilation called ''A Dark Cabaret'' [http://www.projekt.com/projekt/product.asp?sku=PRO00176] featuring 'Coin-Operated Boy' by [[The Dresden Dolls]], 'Evil Night Together' by [[Jill Tracy]] and 'Flowers' by the late [[Rozz Williams]].
