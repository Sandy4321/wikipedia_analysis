==History==
===Second World War===
In 1936, the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] selected the site as a base for [[Maritime patrol]] [[aircraft]]. The airbase had two parts, East Camp and West Camp. The West Camp was home to the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] while the East Camp was part of the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]]. At East camp, the Royal Air Force's No. 34 Operational Training Unit (OTU) was initially located at Yarmouth from April 1942 to June 1942, but was then relocated to [[RCAF Station Pennfield Ridge]], [[New Brunswick]] in June 1942. In November 1942 the [[Royal Navy]] established the No. 1 Naval Air Gunnery School (NAGS), flying the [[Fairey Swordfish]]. No. 1 NAGS ceased operations in March 1945.

In addition to the Naval Air Gunnery School, several individual squadrons and units called RCAF Yarmouth home at various times during the war, including:
*[[No. 5 Squadron RCAF]], from August 1944 to May 1945, flying the [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Consolidated Catalina Mk. 1]];
*[[No. 113 Squadron RCAF]], from February 1942 to May 1943, flying the [[Lockheed Hudson]]. A 113 Squadron Hudson flying from Yarmouth sank [[German submarine U-754|U-754]] on 31 July 1942, Eastern Air Command's first kill;
*[[No. 119 Squadron RCAF]], from July 1940 to January 1942, flying the [[Bristol Bolingbroke]];
*[[No. 160 Squadron RCAF]], from July 1943 to August 1944, flying the Consolidated Canso;
*[[No. 161 Squadron RCAF]], from November 1944 to May 1945, flying the Consolidated Canso;
*[[No. 162 Squadron RCAF]], from May 1942 (formation) to September 1943, flying the Consolidated Canso; and
*No. 6 (Canadian Artillery Corps) Detachment, from December 1941 to November 1943, flying the [[Westland Lysander]] in a coast artillery cooperation role.

In addition, [[No. 419 Squadron RCAF]] and [[No. 428 Squadron RCAF]] were both disbanded in Yarmouth in September 1945 after the [[Surrender of Japan]]. Both squadrons, flying the [[Avro Lancaster]], were to be trained and re-equipped for the Commonwealth [[Tiger Force (air)|Tiger Force]] in the Pacific Theatre.

===Post-war===
After the war, the airfield switched to public/commercial use when it was transferred to [[Transport Canada]]. Regular scheduled flights were started by Trans-Canada Airlines (TCA), which became [[Air Canada]] in 1965. Ownership of Yarmouth Airport was transferred from Transport Canada to the Yarmouth Airport Commission Association on October 1, 1997.<ref name="NAS">[http://www.tc.gc.ca/programs/Airports/Status/menu.htm Airport Divestiture Status Report]</ref> Air Canada flights into Yarmouth ceased in January 2003.<ref>[http://www.gov.ns.ca/news/details.asp?id=20020905007 Province to Meet with Yarmouth Airport Commission]</ref> Since then, several small operators have provided air service between [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and Yarmouth at various times. These include Sou'West Air, who covered the route in 2003, and Starlink Airlines, which flew between Halifax, Yarmouth and [[Portland, Maine]] in 2009.<ref>[http://www.novanewsnow.com/Fisheries/2009-02-09/article-608145/Yarmouth-passenger-air-service-returned-to-the-air-Monday-Updated-with-photos-325-pm-Monday/1 Yarmouth passenger air service returned to the air Monday (Feb 2009)]</ref> The latter lasted less than one year, despite a $2 million provincial government subsidy meant to carry the airline through the first few years of startup.<ref>[http://www.novanewsnow.com/Travel/2009-11-26/article-607600/Starlink-Aviation-suspends-air-service-in-and-out-of-Yarmouth-airport-as-of-Tuesday-Dec-1/1 Starlink Aviation suspends air service to Yarmouth]</ref> From March 15, 2010 to December 31, 2012, an American company, [[Twin Cities Air Service]], provided service between Yarmouth and Portland with scheduled flights several times a week.<ref>[http://www.thevanguard.ca/News/2010-02-28/article-836595/Air-service-between-Yarmouth-and-Portland-to-fly-again/1 Air service between Yarmouth and Portland to fly again]</ref><ref>[http://www.cjls.com/news.php?ID=2717 Twin-Cities To End Flight Service Between Yarmouth and USA]</ref>

==Facilities==
Yarmouth Airport facilities include a modern [[airport terminal]] building and combined services building which houses a maintenance garage and vehicles used for clearing [[runway]]s. The airport has two runways, two [[taxiway]]s and separate parking aprons for both [[Civil aviation|commercial]] and [[general aviation]]. In the summer of 2013, its Category I [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) was decommissioned, however, a [[VHF omnidirectional range]]/[[distance measuring equipment]] (VOR/DME) and [[non-directional beacon]] (NDB) remain active.<ref name="CFS"/> The airport property has {{convert|3.16|km2|abbr=on}} of easily accessible, industrial real estate.

The Yarmouth Airport is also home to the Tri-County Flying Association (informally known as the Yarmouth Flying Club). This non-profit flying club has a small clubhouse located on the field and operates a [[Cessna 172]] available for rental by its members.<ref>[http://www.tcfa.info/ Tri-County Flying Association]</ref>
