'''Steven Widi Ho''', (born March 9, 1973)  is a [[Chinese American]] [[martial artist]], [[entrepreneur]], [[stunt coordinator]], [[stuntman]], and member of the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]].  

Known as one of the first [[martial arts trickster]]s in open martial art competitions and early pioneers of non-traditional forms ([[NASKA]]), Ho helped to popularize the [[540 kick]] and the Hawkeye Kick in the mid-eighties. Many consider Ho's influence, particularly his [[540 kick]], to be the beginning of the [[tricking]] movement. 

Ho is also well regarded for his [[stunt]] work as [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'' (1991) and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III]]'' (1993), and his role as <U+201C>Chan<U+201D> in ''[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1995).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0387378/ IMDB Ninja Turtles 2,3]</ref><ref>[http://stevenhomartialarts.com/blog/?p=82#respond/ Official Blog]</ref>

Ho is a well known martial arts instructor and film fight trainer in [[Hollywood]] who has trained many notable stuntmen and actors, including [[Brad Pitt]], [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[James Franco]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Method Man]], [[Rachel Weisz]], [[Gisele B<U+00FC>ndchen]], [[Josh Charles]], [[Peter Krause]], [[Bar Refaeli]], [[Ellen Barkin]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0387378/ IMDB Student list]</ref>

Ho co-founded [[Plush Home]], Inc., an all-encompassing [[interior design]] firm and furniture line, in 2003 with his wife, [[Nina Petronzio]], an American Interior Designer and Furniture Designer known for her high end [[Transitional Style]] designs.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0387378/ IMDB Personal bio notes]</ref><ref name="Plush Home Bio">[http://plushhome.com/bio.php Plush Home Bio]</ref><ref name="plushhome.com">[http://www.plushhome.com/php/press_enlarge.php Angelino Magazine, Scene in LA, June 2004]</ref>

== Conan O'Brien ==
Ho was a regular and popular guest of ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]''. On the well-received segments, Ho would typically inflict apparent pain to [[Conan O'Brien]] while he aggressively taught the host the basics of stunt fighting. 

On the 8th episode that originally aired on June 10, 2009, Ho opened the show by sucker-punching Conan to <U+201C>give him a sense of what a real hit feels like<U+201D>.  The duo continued with a choreographed fight scene in which Conan portrayed the <U+201C>thug fighter<U+201D> and Ho the <U+201C>hero fighter<U+201D>. A [[theatrical property]] ("prop") fire extinguisher and shovel were incorporated into the [[fight choreography]] and the segment ended with Ho ratcheting Conan through a breakaway glass window.  [[Comedian]] [[Dane Cook]] was also a guest that night.<ref>[http://www.thetonightshowwithconanobrien.com The Tonight Show with Conan O'brien Official Website]</ref>  For the first time since his debut on The Tonight Show, Conan O<U+2019>Brien saw a rise in the ratings on this Wednesday night.  The Tonight Show on NBC scored a 3.2 rating, which is 10% higher than the previous night. The Late Show with David Letterman scored a 3.1, dropping slightly, fell behind Conan.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/turl-2ee368/ The Live Feed]</ref> 

Five weeks after his appearance, Ho was back for the 30th episode on July 17, 2009, making him the first returning guest of the show.  This time Ho taught Conan the basics of sword fighting and using breakaway props. When he did not evade Ho's strike fast enough, Conan was hit by Ho with a bamboo sword in the ribs. Ho then proceeded to break a handful of breakaway bottles over Conan's head, sending him comically running to hide behind [[Andy Richter]].  The segment ended with Ho dragging Conan backwards in a sitting position across the stage and through a picket fence, chicken coupe, breakaway mirror, and large scaled bowling pins. [[Seth Green]] was the second guest that night.<ref name="thetonightshowwithconanobrien.com">[http://www.thetonightshowwithconanobrien.com The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien Official Website]</ref> 

Ho made a third appearance on ''The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien'' for the 65th episode on September 14, 2009, the first night the show shared the evening with [[Jay Leno]]'s 10:00pm prime time show.<ref>[http://stevenhomartialarts.com/blog/ Steven Ho Official Website]</ref> Ho's segment ran for 13 minutes, 27 seconds. [[Charlize Thereon]] was also a guest that night and the [[Dave Mathews Band]] was the musical performance.<ref name="thetonightshowwithconanobrien.com"/> In terms of audience, ''The Tonight Show With Conan O'Brien'' jumped 22% to 4.3 million viewers that night, compared to the shows typical Monday average that summer of 3.5 million viewers. There were also nice gains in adults 18-49 and adults 25-54.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/09/leno-helps-conan-sort-of.html Los Angeles Times/Entertainment]</ref> This episode also re-ran on October 22, 2009.

Ho's third appearance on the show won an online poll for "Favorite Guest Moment" on ''The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien'''s main website.<ref name="thetonightshowwithconanobrien.com"/> 

All of Ho's appearances were included in the montage of the finale show of ''The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien'' on January 22, 2010.

After the announcement of the cancellation of ''The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien'', Ho was instrumental in supporting and rallying fans for the "I'M WITH COCO" movement spearheaded by artist Mike Mitchell through [[Facebook]].  At the January 18, 2010 rally held in Los Angeles in front of NBC studios, Ho portrayed [[Asian Conan]] in a popular sketch for the website [[Funny or Die]] in which "Asian Conan" fights "Asian Jay Leno" in a street fight. 

Funny or Die is in production on a follow-up "Asian Conan" comedy short, anticipated to be released as an exclusive on their website in April 2010.<ref name="Asian Conan Update">[http://stevenhomartialarts.com/blog/2010/03/27/asian-conan-update-sound-design/ Steven Ho Official Blog]</ref>

Ho returned as a guest on O'Brien's [[TBS (TV channel)|TBS]] show, ''[[Conan (TV series)|Conan]]'', on January 25, 2011.

== Early life and martial arts ==
Born in [[Bandung]], [[Indonesia]] to [[Chinese people|Chinese]] parents (son of research [[scientist]], Kie Liang Ho), Ho's family escaped to America in 1971 and immigrated to [[South Gate, California]] as [[political refugees]] with the aid of [[Church World Service]] (CWS). 

After eight years of intensive martial arts training with [[Sensei]] Richard King of the Karate Institute of America and winning local karate competitions in Los Angeles (particularly at [[Ed Parker]]<U+2019>s [[Long Beach International Karate Championships]] and various meets at the Culver City Civic Auditorium), Ho exploded on the National Karate Circuit (North American Sport Karate Association) and was responsible for the American Forms Division of which he was National Champion. Known for his jump kicking techniques and innovative style, Ho quickly established himself as one of the top experts in the United States.<ref>[http://www.otomix.com/mma/cards/28.html Martial Art Masters Trading Cards]</ref>

== Films ==

In 1989, Ho was recruited into the film business by action-icon [[Jet Li]] to work as his stunt double and <U+201C>heavy<U+201D> on a series of Hong Kong films. Jet Li, who was recuperating from injury, was at a National Karate tournament in Irvine, California when he hand-picked Ho to be his [[stunt double]] in the finale fight scene of ''Long zai tian ya'', aka ''Dragon Fight'' (1989), co-starring [[Stephen Chow]].  Ho also worked as a stunt fighter in the film Long xing tian xia, aka The Master (1989),<ref name="IMDB">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0387378/ IMDB]</ref>  which was Ho<U+2019>s second film as a stunt-actor with Li.  The Master was directed by famed [[Hong Kong New Wave]] director, [[Tsui Hark]].
[[Image:Steven ho about.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Ho is known to be one of the early pioneers of martial art trick kicks and helped introduce the 540 kick in competition in the late 80's.]] 
[[Roger Corman]] gave Ho his [[Screen Actors Guild]] card for his supporting roll in the sequel to ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]'', titled ''Rock & Roll High School Forever'', starring [[Corey Feldman]]. Ho was the bass player in the new music band, "The Eradicators" fronted by Feldman (the original cult film featured [[The Ramones]]). In the film he delivered the famous line, "''Hey, that's no my pee''". Corman recorded an original soundtrack for "The Eradicators", but the film was not a success and the band never made it further than the film.

Ho then made plans to relocate to [[Hong Kong]] to pursue a career as a [[stuntman]].  But in 1990, Ho caught the eye of [[stunt coordinator]], Pat Johnson, when he won his division at "The Battle of Atlanta National Karate Championships."  Johnson convinced Ho to remain in Los Angeles when he cast him as the staff-wielding action turtle, [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], in the hit films ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'' (1991) and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III]]'' (1993).<ref>[http://www.ninjaturtles.com/movies/movie3.htm  TMNT 3 Credits]</ref>  

Ho went on to work in many acclaimed film projects as an [[actor]], [[action choreographer]], fight trainer, [[stuntman]], [[Film director|director]], [[writer]], and [[Film producer|producer]] including his role as <U+201C>Chan<U+201D> in [[Mortal Kombat]] (1995).<ref>[http://mkk.mortalkombatonline.com/movies/mk/ Mortal Kombat Movie Credits]</ref> Through the mid-nineties, Ho guest-starred in many television series, highlighting his martial arts skills.  Among them were ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'', ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'', ''[[High Tide (TV series)|High Tide]]''.  Ho also suffered many stunt-related injuries during this time, including a crushed foot that took five surgeries and two years of rehabilitation to overcome.

In 1999, Ho completed his directorial & writing debut on the indie film and festival favorite, <U+201C>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134974/combined Soundman (on imdb)]<U+201D>.<ref>[http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/fall1998/prod_update.php Filmmaker Magazine, Production Updates, Fall 1998]</ref> The film featured Wayne Pere, [[Eliane Chappuis]], [[Nick Stahl]] and [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]]. For his directorial debut with "Soundman", former members of [[Guns N' Roses]] ([[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[Matt Sorum]], [[Duff McKagan]]) reunited for the first time in six years to collaborate to score a portion of the film's [[soundtrack]],<ref>[http://www.snakepit.org/news1.html Snakepit]</ref><ref>[http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12039592 Yahoo Music News, by Craig Rosen, 26 January 1999]</ref> as well as play at the film's opening party at Harry O<U+2019>s in Park City, Utah for the [[Slamdance Film Festival]].<ref>[http://archive.slamdance.com/sd99/festival/soundman.html Slamdance Film Festival Archives]</ref>  The event was covered by [[MTV]] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and is believed to be the beginning of what eventually evolved into the [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[hard rock]] [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]], [[Velvet Revolver]].
 
In 2008, Ho was part of the acclaimed stunt team for ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' that was nominated for a [[Screen Actors Guild]] award for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture.<ref>[http://www.sagawards.org/PR_080121c SAG Awards, 2008]</ref>  Ho stunt coordinated and choreographed the [[Linkin Park]] music video (directed by [[Joseph Hahn]]), [[Shadow of the Day]], which won a [[MTV Video Music Award]] for [[Best Rock Video]] that same year.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/272763/linkin-park-wins-best-rock-video.jhtml?id=1594255 MTV]</ref>

With his extensive background in martial arts and weapons, Ho has been a sought-after instructor and choreographer in Hollywood to stuntmen and actors aiming to get film-ready. Most Notably, Ho trained [[Brad Pitt]] in swordplay for six months prior to his production of ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'',<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20150144,00.html People Magazine, Show of Strength, May 24, 2004]</ref><ref>[http://splicedwire.com/04reviews/troy.html Splicedwire Movie Review, Rob Blackwelder]</ref> and prepped [[Tobey Maguire]] for 3 months prior to his transformational role as [[Peter Benjamin Parker|Peter Parker]] in ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002).<ref name="articles.latimes.com">[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/13/home/hm-homeworks13 Los Angeles Times, Homeworks, by Lisa Boon, May 13, 2004]</ref>  His students list includes [[Brad Pitt]], [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[James Franco]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Method Man]], [[Rachel Weisz]], [[Gisele B<U+00FC>ndchen]], [[Josh Charles]], [[Peter Krause]], [[Bar Refaeli]], [[Ellen Barkin]].<ref name="IMDB"/><ref name="IMDB"/>

== Stand-up Comedy ==

Ho performed his first stand-up comedy sketch at Comedy Zen to a sold out 220 seat audience at the [[The Downtown Independent]] in Downtown Los Angeles on December 3, 2010. He opened for veterans Jay Phillips and [[Joe Wong (comedian)]] in a successful 30 minute set that included material on his experiences as a Hollywood stuntman and having Italian in-laws. A highlight of the show was when Ho brought out the original head from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turltes II: The Secret of the Ooze, and incorporated that into his set.<ref>[http://audreymagazine.com/tag/carrie-ann-inaba/]</ref>

== Plush Home ==
[[Image:Plush Home showroom.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Plush Home]]'s flagship showroom is located on [[Melrose Avenue]] in [[West Hollywood, California]]]]

Ho dropped out of [[Business School]] at [[Pepperdine University]] just a few classes shy of earning his [[Bachelor's Degree]] so that he could pursue his stunt career with Li.  Shortly after meeting his wife, [[Nina Petronzio]] (an American interior designer and furniture designer), the couple established a boutique interior design firm in 2001.<ref>[http://www.plushhome.com/php/press_enlarge.php Good Housekeeping, Two People - One Style, December 2003]</ref>
