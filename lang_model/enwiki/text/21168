The episode follows [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] as she dates and falls in love with an inmate at the local prison, eventually ending up hiding him in the [[Griffin family]] home, and being sent to jail, returning a hardened criminal.

The episode was written by Alex Carter and [[Andrew Goldberg (TV writer)|Andrew Goldberg]], and directed by [[Cyndi Tang]]. It received mostly positive reviews for its storyline, and cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 6.21 million homes in its original airing.

==Plot==
[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] decides to enter the local rodeo competition, and trains using [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] in various ways. However, during the competition he quickly falls off his [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] bull, and ends up being [[rape]]d, offscreen, by the bull. While at the rodeo, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] meets the editor of ''[[People (magazine)|Teen People]]'', who gives him a job writing an article about the average American girl. When he starts following and spying on Meg with [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] for research, they discover that she has fallen in love with a man in jail named Luke, who she met through a school pen-pal project.

Brian reveals Meg's secret to Peter and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], who don't want her seeing Luke again. However, he soon breaks out of jail during a prison riot and tries to hide in the Griffins' house. Brian finds him just as Peter enters, who only knows what is happening when reading ''[[TV Guide]]'', which details the plot of the episode, and is the same reason he entered the rodeo. As Luke escapes out the window, Peter alerts [[Joe Swanson|Joe]], who apprehends Luke. Joe also arrests Meg for harboring a fugitive, and she is sent to prison.

Three months later, Meg returns home a hardened criminal, abusing her family, still doing things from prison, and beating up the kids who make fun of her at school, for which she is suspended. Wanting to start a new life away from home, Meg ambushes Brian in his car and forces him to drive to [[Mort Goldman|Mort's]] Pharmacy so she can rob him. Brian, however, shows her the article he wrote, in which he describes her "far sweeter and kinder" than the typical American girl. Meg is touched by this, so she changes her mind, and returns home.

The conservative [[Parents Television Council]], a frequent [[criticism of Family Guy|critic]] of ''Family Guy'' and other [[Seth McFarlane]]-produced shows, named "Dial Meg for Murder" its "Worst TV Show of the Week" for the week ending February 5, 2010, due to excessive violence in scenes featuring Meg as both the victim and the instigator. Also cited was the sequence where Peter unsuccessfully fights off an angry bull, and later is shown in a fetal position while the bull stands over him, calling it "sickening."<ref>{{cite web|title="Family Guy" on Fox|url=http://parentstv.org/PTC/publications/bw/2010/0205worst.asp|publisher=Parents Television Council|date=February 5, 2010|accessdate=February 5, 2010}}</ref>
