'''Hurricane Lenny''' was the second-strongest November [[Atlantic hurricane]] on record. It was the twelfth [[tropical storm]], eighth hurricane, and record-breaking fifth [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 4|Category 4&nbsp;hurricane]] in the [[1999 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Lenny formed on November&nbsp;13 in the western [[Caribbean Sea]] and maintained an unprecedented west-to-east track for its entire duration. It attained hurricane status south of [[Jamaica]] on November 15 and passed south of [[Hispaniola]] and [[Puerto Rico]] over the next few days. Lenny rapidly intensified over the northeastern Caribbean on November&nbsp;17, attaining peak winds of 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h) about {{convert|21|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Saint Croix]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands]]. It gradually weakened while moving through the [[Leeward Islands]], eventually dissipating on November&nbsp;23 over the open Atlantic Ocean.

Before moving through the Lesser Antilles, Lenny produced rough surf that killed two people in northern [[Colombia]]. Strong winds and rainfall resulted in heavy crop damage in southeastern Puerto Rico. Despite the hurricane's passage near Saint Croix at peak intensity, damage on the small island was only described as "moderate", although there was widespread flooding and erosion. Damage in the United States territories totaled about $330&nbsp;million. The highest precipitation total was {{convert|34.12|in|mm|abbr=on}} at Gendarmerie on the French side of [[Saint Martin]]. On the island, the hurricane destroyed more than 200&nbsp;properties and killed three people. In nearby [[Antigua and Barbuda]], the hurricane killed one person; torrential rainfall there contaminated the local water supply. Significant storm damage occurred as far south as [[Grenada]], where high surf isolated towns from the capital city.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Lenny 1999 track.png}}
Hurricane Lenny began as a [[low-pressure area]] that was first observed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November&nbsp;8. It developed an area of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] but remained poorly defined for the next few days. Thunderstorms spread across the region, producing heavy rainfall in portions of Mexico and Central America. On November&nbsp;13, the system became better organized; a [[Hurricane Hunters]] flight later that day discovered a surface circulation and [[Maximum sustained wind|winds]] of about 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h). The data indicated the [[tropical cyclogenesis|development]] of Tropical Depression Sixteen at 1800&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], about 175&nbsp;mi (280&nbsp;km) south of the [[Cayman Islands]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite report|author=John L.

Beginning on November&nbsp;16, Hurricane Lenny underwent a 24-hour period of [[rapid deepening]], reaching major hurricane status about 165&nbsp;mi (265&nbsp;km) south of the [[Mona Passage]].<ref name="tcr"/> It developed well-defined [[rainband|banding features]], good [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]], and a circular eye that was visible from the radar in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite report|author=Lixion Avila|date=1999-11-16|title=Hurricane Lenny Discussion Fourteen|accessdate=2011-07-29|publisher=National Hurricane Center|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/1999/dis/NAL1699.014.html}}</ref> The hurricane continued to become better organized, with an eye 29&nbsp;mi (46&nbsp;km) in diameter surrounded by a closed eyewall.<ref>{{cite report|author=Richard Pasch|date=1999-11-16|title=Hurricane Lenny Discussion Fifteen|accessdate=2011-07-29|publisher=National Hurricane Center|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/1999/dis/NAL1699.015.html}}</ref> Around 1200&nbsp;UTC on November&nbsp;17, Lenny intensified into a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane while approaching the islands of the northeastern Caribbean. It was the fifth storm of such intensity in the year, setting the record for most Category&nbsp;4 hurricanes in a season.<ref name="tcr"/> The hurricane then made its closest approach to Puerto Rico, passing about {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Maunabo, Puerto Rico|Maunabo]].<ref name="srh"/> Shortly thereafter, Lenny attained peak winds of 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h) while passing 21&nbsp;mi (33&nbsp;km) south of the island of [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands]].<ref name="tcr"/> This made it the second-strongest hurricane on record to form during the month of November.<ref>{{cite report|author=Michael Brennan|date=2009-01-26|title=Hurricane Paloma Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-07-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL172008_Paloma.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> At the time, Lenny was also one of only four November major hurricanes,<ref name="srh">{{cite report|publisher=San Juan, Puerto Rico National Weather Service Office|title=Preliminary Storm Report on Hurricane Lenny November 16<U+2013>19 1999|accessdate=2011-07-30|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/sju/?n=1999_lenny}}</ref> but it was later joined by [[Hurricane Michelle]] in 2001 and [[Hurricane Paloma]] in 2008.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Hurricane Hunters reported Lenny's peak winds in the southeastern portion of the hurricane; the group also reported a minimum [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] of 933&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]], a drop of 34&nbsp;mbar in 24&nbsp;hours. In addition, a [[dropsonde]] recorded winds of 210&nbsp;mph (339&nbsp;km/h) while descending to the surface, the highest dropsonde wind speed recording in a hurricane at the time.<ref name="tcr"/> 

Around the time it peaked in intensity, Lenny's forward speed decreased in response to light [[Tropical cyclone#Steering winds|steering currents]] between two ridges. Despite favorable conditions for strengthening, the hurricane weakened as it turned to an eastward drift, possibly due to the [[upwelling]] of cooler waters. Late on November&nbsp;18, Lenny's eye moved over [[Saint Martin]] with winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h). After continued weakening, the hurricane struck [[Anguilla]] and [[Saint Barth<U+00E9>lemy]] the next day.

A hurricane watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the [[Virgin Islands]] late on November&nbsp;15, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later.<ref name="tcr"/> By that time, Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico.<ref name="d12"/> After Lenny made its closest approach to the island, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November&nbsp;17, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the Virgin Islands.<ref name="tcr"/> In Puerto Rico, the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] [[National Weather Service]] office. Based on the coverage, the public was well informed of the hurricane's threat to the island. Before the storm and as a result of its impact, around 4,700&nbsp;people evacuated to 191&nbsp;shelters.

After passing southeast of Puerto Rico, Hurricane Lenny struck St. Croix in the [[United States Virgin Islands]], although its strongest winds remained southeast of the island. There, gusts reached 112&nbsp;mph (180&nbsp;km/h), while sustained winds officially peaked around 70&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h). Strong winds damaged the roofs of many houses in eastern St. Croix<ref name="tcr"/> and knocked down trees and power lines. The winds left severe damage to vegetation after fruits and vegetables were blown away. Rainfall peaked at {{convert|10.47|in|mm|abbr=on}},<ref name="hpc"/> which caused widespread flooding of many properties in the island's western portion. In [[Frederiksted, United States Virgin Islands|Frederiksted]], the hurricane produced a [[storm surge]] of 15&ndash;20&nbsp;ft (4.5&ndash;6&nbsp;m)<ref name="tcr"/> along with high waves that washed out roads and damaged coastal structures. There was also severe beach erosion in western St. Croix; high waves dumped 6.5&nbsp;ft (2&nbsp;m) of sand onto coastal roads about {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} inland,<ref name="srh"/> and also washed several boats ashore.<ref name="tcr"/> The National Weather Service described the damage as "moderate".<ref name="srh"/>
