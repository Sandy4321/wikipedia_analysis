==Playing career==
===Pre-NHL===

Emery started his junior hockey career in 1998 in Junior C with the Dunnville Terriers of the OJHL. <ref name="legends"> {{cite web | url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=20275 |title=Ray Emery | publisher=[http://www.legendsofhockey.net Legendsofhockey.net] | accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Despite only winning three games, Emery was named rookie of the year. <ref name="citizen"> {{cite web | url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/story.html?id=b44dfd3b-686d-47b4-9c7d-9e6d6ea970f9&k=33072&p=3 | title=The Apprenticeship of Ray Emery | publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]] | accessdate=2007-06-27 }}</ref> In 1999, Emery was drafted by [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL's]] [[Sault Ste Marie Greyhounds]] in the 5th round of the OHL draft. <ref name="citizen"/> Emery split the 1999<U+2013>2000 season between the Welland Cougars of the OHA and the Greyhounds in the OHL. <ref name="legends"/> In 2000<U+2013>2001 with the Greyhounds, Emery was involved in 4 on-ice fights. <ref name="Record>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/features/east/east_notebook032806.html |title=Sens on pace for record season | publisher=[[National Hockey League|NHL]] | accessdate=2007-07-09 }}</ref> In 2001, Emery was drafted 99th overall to the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] by the Ottawa Senators. <ref> {{cite web | url=http://www.hockeygoalies.org/bio/emery.html | title=Ray Emery |publisher=[http://www.hockeygoalies.org www.hockeygoalies.org] |accessdate=2007-06-26 }}</ref> Emery had his most successful OHL season in 2001<U+2013>2002. <ref name="citizen"/> In 2002<U+2013>2003, Emery moved on to the [[Binghamton Senators]] of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] for his first season as a professional. He again had a solid season, winning 27 of 50 games and being named the AHL's All-Rookie team for 2003. However, Emery was suspended twice for on-ice incidents, and his behavior continued into the 2003-2004 season.<ref> {{cite web| url=http://www.theahl.com/news/league/index.html?article_id=7466 | title=League News | publisher=[[American Hockey League|AHL]] | accessdate=2007-06-26 }} </ref> Emery's fighiting ways continued during the 2003-2004 season. He was suspended for 3 games for a stick swinging attack on [[Michel Ouellet]] of the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]]<ref name="citizen"/>, and he had an ugly altercation with [[Denis Hamel]] of the [[Rochester Americans]], after a racial slur was said. <ref name="citizen"/> He played one more full season in the AHL in 2004<U+2013>2005, while also playing 6 NHL games with the Ottawa Senators. <ref name="stats"/>

===NHL career===

Emery began his [[National Hockey League|NHL]] career by setting a record for wins to start a career in the 2005<U+2013>2006 season.  Emery won his first nine games, moving ahead of [[Bob Froese]], who started the [[1982-83 NHL season|1982<U+2013>83]] season with eight wins while playing for the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].  <ref name="citizen"/> In March of the same season, Emery won 12 games, tying legend [[Bernie Parent]]'s record for the most wins in a month which Parent set in 1974. <ref> {{cite web| url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/scores/recap/?id=6328 | title=Game Recap |publisher=[[TSN]] | accessdate=2007-06-26 }} </ref>

During the beginning of the 2005<U+2013>2006 season Emery had won nine straight games during the regular season, when he was being used as back-up for [[Dominik Ha<U+0161>ek]]<ref name="Emery"> {{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/features/spotlight/emery041406.html | title= Sens' Emery smoothed rough edges | publisher=[[National Hockey League|NHL]] | accessdate=2007-06-26 }} </ref>. However, when Ha<U+0161>ek injured his groin during the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], Emery became the starting goalie, with [[Mike Morrison]] to back him up, picked up off waivers from Edmonton.  Emery subsequently played for the Senators in the playoffs as well, losing to Buffalo in 5 games, but acquired his first playoff experience.

After the 2005<U+2013>2006 season the Senators decided not to bring back Ha<U+0161>ek, and instead to bring in [[Martin Gerber]] to battle Emery for the number 1 goaltending job<ref name="sunnybackup"/>. Gerber won the starting job to start the season<ref name="sunnybackup">{{cite web| url=http://ottsun.canoe.ca/Sports/Columnists/Nicks_Erin/2006/10/01/1929889.html | title=Backup Emery won't back down to Gerber |publisher=[[Ottawa Sun]] | accessdate=2007-06-28 }}</ref>, but due to Gerber's poor play, Emery regained the role of starter in mid-November.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sportsline.com/nhl/gamecenter/recap/NHL_20070214_FLA@OTT |title=Gerber Collects Shutout in Rare Start for the Senators|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> On Saturday, [[February 10]], [[2007]], Emery was suspended 3 games from the NHL for slashing [[Montreal Canadiens]] forward [[Maxim Lapierre]] after Lapierre crashed into Emery's net.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=195934&hubname|title=Sens' Emery suspended for three games|publisher=[[TSN]]|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref><ref name="Brawl"/>  

On [[February 22]], [[2007]], his first game after his 3 games suspension, Emery was involved in the melee between the Senators and the [[Buffalo Sabres]].  He and Sabres goalie [[Martin Biron]] each left their creases and fought each other.<ref name="fight"> {{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20062007/GS020908.HTM | title=Game Summary | publisher=[[NHL]] |accessdate=2007-06-26 }}</ref>  After that was broken up, Emery then fought Sabres enforcer [[Andrew Peters]]. <ref name="fight"/>  Both goaltenders received game misconducts, and Emery had the rare feat (for a goalie) of receiving two five-minute majors for fighting in the same incident; Emery received a total of 22 penalty minutes (two 5-minute majors for fighting, a 2-minute minor for leaving the crease, and the 10-minute game misconduct) for this altercation. <ref name="fight"/>  After the altercation, fans and media have dubbed him "Sugar Ray" in reference to retired boxer [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] and Emery's reputation as a fighter.<ref name="sugar"/> About the incident, Emery said, "It's my favourite part of the game. But my mom was there. She got mad at me. So I can't do it again for a while or my mom will be really mad." " <ref name="sugar"/>

Prior to the 2007 playoffs, Emery and the Senators pulled out a win in a 5-2 effort against the [[Montreal Canadiens]] on [[March 30]], [[2007]], which was his 100th NHL game. <ref name="100 Habs">{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Recap&gameNumber=1159&season=20062007&gameType=2 |title=Senators 5, Canadiens 2 |publisher=[[NHL]] | accessdate=2007-06-26 }}</ref> Emery's solid play in the season continued on in the playoffs, as the Senators defeated the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], [[New Jersey Devils]] and [[Buffalo Sabres]] each in 5 games en route to their first [[Stanley Cup Final]] appearance since the team returned to the NHL in 1992. <ref> {{cite web | url=http://blog.canoe.ca/drhockey/2007/05/25/sens_powering_poolies | title=Ray of Senshine | accessdate=2007-06-27 }}</ref>  But the Senators lost to the Anaheim Ducks in 5 games in the Stanley Cup Finals. <ref> {{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Recap&gameNumber=415&season=20062007&gameType=3 | title=Ducks prove to be mightiest of them all | publisher=[[NHL]] | accessdate=2007-06-27 }}</ref> Emery also picked up three shutouts along the way (one in each of the first three series). <ref name="stats">{{cite web| url=http://www.forecaster.ca/cbc/hockey/player.cgi?2514 | title=Ray Emery Bio |publisher=[[CBC]] |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

==Mask controversy==
On [[January 30]], [[2006]], Emery was the target of many critics as a result of a design which was painted on his goalie mask. Emery, who is an avid boxing fan, wore a mask with a picture of [[Mike Tyson]] painted on it (because he watched Tyson when he grew up). <ref name="Tyson">{{cite web| url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/News/2006/01/31/1420249-cp.html | title=Emery drops Tyson mask | publisher:SLAM!
