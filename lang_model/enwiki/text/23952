'''No. 1 Flying Training School''' (No. 1 FTS) was a flying training school of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF).  It was one of the Air Force's original units, dating back to the service's formation in 1921, when it was based at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria. The school underwent a number of reorganisations during its existence. In 1940 it was reformed as '''No.&nbsp;1 Service Flying Training School''' under the wartime [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]], disbanding in 1944. After World War&nbsp;II, it was re-established at Point Cook as No.&nbsp;1 FTS. It reformed again as '''No.&nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School''' (No.&nbsp;1 AFTS) in 1952, and relocated to [[RAAF Base Pearce]], Western Australia, in 1958. Meanwhile, in 1951, No.&nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School (No.&nbsp;1 BFTS) had been formed at [[Uranquinty]], New South Wales, moving to Point Cook in 1958. In 1969, No.&nbsp;1 AFTS reformed as [[No. 2 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Flying Training School]] and No.&nbsp;1 BFTS reformed as No.&nbsp;1 FTS. No.&nbsp;1 FTS was finally disbanded at Point Cook in 1993.

No. 1 Flying Training School (No.&nbsp;1 FTS) was the first unit to be formally established as part of the new [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australian Air Force]] on 31&nbsp;March 1921 (the prefix "Royal" was added in August that year).

Squadron Leader McNamara again assumed command of the school in 1930. By this time, it had been reorganised into three components: Training Squadron, operating [[Westland Wapiti]]s; Fighter Squadron, operating [[Bristol Bulldog]]s; and Seaplane Squadron, operating [[Supermarine Southampton]]s. The latter pair were, however, "really little more than [[Flight (military unit)|flights]]"; Fighter Squadron was dissolved in 1935 when its Bulldogs were transferred to [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Laverton]], while Seaplane Squadron was extant until 1939, when it was separated to form the basis of [[No. 10 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;10 Squadron]].<ref name="1FTS"/><ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 186&ndash;187, 127&ndash;128</ref> One of the school's leading [[Flight instructor|instructors]] at this time was Flight Lieutenant [[Frederick Scherger]], who was also a flight commander in Fighter Squadron.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 188&ndash;189, 202&ndash;203</ref> In 1932, No. 1 FTS began running two courses each year, the first commencing in January and the second in July.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 201</ref> Wing Commander [[Hippolyte De La Rue]] became commanding officer in 1933.<ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130682b.htm De La Rue, Hippolyte Ferdinand] at Australian Dictionary of Biography.

===World War II===

RAAF flying training was heavily reorganised soon after the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II, in response to Australia's participation in the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. A number of Elementary Flying Training Schools were formed, to provide basic flight instruction to cadets, while more advanced instruction was to take place at Service Flying Training Schools.<ref>Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/03.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', pp. 72&ndash;73]</ref><ref name="Gillison p.97">Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', p. 97]</ref> During April&ndash;May 1940, No.&nbsp;1 FTS was reformed at Point Cook as '''No.&nbsp;1 Service Flying Training School''' (No.&nbsp;1 SFTS),<ref name="1SFTS">RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 100&ndash;101</ref> while its Instructors' Training Squadron formed the nucleus of a reformed Central Flying School, which relocated to [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], New South Wales, in June.<ref name="Gillison p.97"/> The courses at the Service Flying Training Schools consisted of two streams, intermediate and advanced; the total duration varied during the war as demand for aircrew rose and fell. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.<ref>Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', p. 109]</ref>   

The initial complement of 52 aircraft at No.&nbsp;1 SFTS included Wapitis, Cadets, [[Avro Anson]]s, [[Hawker Demon]]s, and a [[De&nbsp;Havilland Tiger Moth]]. Group Captain [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]] served as commanding officer from October 1940 until July 1941, when he handed over to Wing Commander [[Evelyn King]], who went on to take charge of Station Headquarters Point Cook in October.<ref name="1SFTS"/><ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150028b.htm King, Elwyn Roy] at Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved on 16 February 2011.</ref> By this stage, No.&nbsp;1 SFTS had an establishment of 100 officers and over 2,000 airmen, operating more than 100 aircraft and training up to 300 cadets at any one time. The aircraft types now included [[De Havilland DH.60 Moth|De&nbsp;Havilland Gypsy Moths]] and [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide|DH.89 Dragon Rapide]]s, [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]], [[CAC Wirraway]]s and [[Airspeed Oxford]]s, the latter two being the mainstays. Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] held command of the school from October 1943 until its disbandment in September 1944, by which time almost 3,000 pilots had graduated from the school.<ref name="1SFTS"/> Among these were [[Nicky Barr]], who became one of Australia's leading [[Flying ace|fighter aces]], and [[Bill Newton]], awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for bombing raids in [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]] during 1943.<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_1077820.asp Wing Commander Andrew William Barr] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

In February 1946, the personnel and equipment of [[No. 5 Service Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;5 Service Flying Training School]], which had been reduced after the war to a care-and-maintenance unit at its base in [[Uranquinty]], New South Wales, were used to re-establish No.&nbsp;1 FTS.<ref>RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 107&ndash;108</ref> Its aircraft included one Anson, two Tiger Moths, and 55 Wirraways. By August 1947, the school had been transferred to Point Cook, where it was led by Wing Commander Read. Its No.&nbsp;1 Aircrew Course commenced in February 1948, graduating in August the following year, after which Read handed over to Squadron Leader Glen Cooper.<ref name="1FTS"/><ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 145&ndash;146</ref> In response to demands for more aircrew to fulfill Australia's commitments to the [[Korean War]] and [[Malayan Emergency]], flying training in the RAAF underwent major changes in 1951&ndash;52, with the syllabus at No.&nbsp;1 FTS being split among three separately located units.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 149</ref> No.&nbsp;1 Initial Flying Training School (No.&nbsp;1 IFTS) was raised at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received their flight grading during twelve hours on Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No.&nbsp;1 IFTS went on to the newly formed No.&nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School (No.&nbsp;1 BFTS) at Uranquinty, where they underwent a further 90 hours of aerial instruction that included instrument, formation and night flying, first on Tiger Moths and then on Wirraways. Successful students finally transferred to No.&nbsp;1 FTS, which was renamed '''No.&nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School''' (No.&nbsp;1 AFTS) in March 1952. There they undertook 100 flying hours of advanced weapons and combat training on Wirraways, before graduating as [[Sergeant|Sergeant Pilot]]s.<ref name="Stephens">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 199&ndash;200</ref> The Tiger Moths and Wirraways were later replaced by the locally designed [[CAC Winjeel]], first delivered in 1955.<ref name="Winjeel">[http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A85.htm Winjeel] at [[RAAF Museum]].

In May 1958, No.&nbsp;1 AFTS relocated to [[RAAF Base Pearce]], Western Australia, where it re-equipped with [[De Havilland Vampire]] jet trainers.
