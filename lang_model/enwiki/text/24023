'''<U+00C9>tienne d'Hastrel de Rivedoux''' was a general of the [[First French Empire]] who fought in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He was born 4 February 1766 at [[Pointe-aux-Trembles]] in [[Quebec]], which was then the British colony, [[Province of Quebec (1763<U+2013>1791)|Province of Qu<U+00E9>bec]], the son of an officer in the French military. His father had served in India during the [[Seven Years War]], and later in Quebec.

The son of rural nobility, he attended the Royal Military School in Paris as a gentleman-cadet. After his graduation, Hastrel occupied several junior positions. During the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, and its subsequent political and social upheavals, he affirmed his loyalty to France. Described by his colleagues as naturally talented, quickly moved into the ranks of the general staff, filling increasingly important positions in several French field armies, including the [[Army of the Rhine]], the [[Army of the Danube]], the [[Army of Helvetia]], and the [[Grand Arm<U+00E9>e]]. He also managed an autonomous division of engineers and sappers during the [[Peninsular War]].

After the [[Bourbon Restoration]], he retained his titles and honors. He was recalled from retirement in 1830, during the [[July Revolution]]. He died 19 September 1846 at [[Versailles]].

==Military career==

<U+00C9>tienne d'Hastrel was admitted to the Royal Military School in Paris as a gentleman-cadet, with the rank of [[sous-lieutenant]] on 11 September 1781. When he graduated on 8 May 1784, he joined the Artois Regiment&mdash;later the 48th Infantry Regiment&mdash;as a lieutenant.<ref name=Lievyns/> He was present at [[Rennes]] during the turmoil immediately following the Revolution, particularly divisive in the military. Some of soldiers, and indeed of some of the officers, suspected the loyalty of fellow officers remained with the old regime. Hastrel worried that the officers could no longer command the obedience of the troops, and recounted in his journal:

<blockquote>"The reception of the tri-color occasioned a scene of insubordination, which deprived us of several officers and served as a pretext to the revolutionaries to inspire defiance among the  soldiers. At the moment when the flag was blessed and given to the battalion, the commander gave the orders to leave the church, but the soldiers would not budge. Stirred up by the youths who had assisted with the ceremony, they declared that they would not leave the old flag to be hung from the church vaults.... We could not enforce our commands....Seeing his authority ignored, the commander left the church and was followed by six or seven other officers. Then ''Capitaine Sermizelles'', who had stayed, took the flag and gave it to the priest to be hung in the church.... [T]he battalion...returned to the barracks in order."<ref>Terry Crowdy. ''French revolutionary infantryman 1791&ndash;1802.'' Oxford: Osprey, 2003, ISBN 184176552X, p. 16.</ref></blockquote>

He was promoted to captain with the campaign of the [[Vosges]] on 13 April 1792. He participated in the engagements at [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Hochheim am Main|Hochheim]] and [[Siege of Mainz (1793)]], and a small engagement at [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]. Subsequently he was named adjutant staff major of the [[Army of the Rhine]] on 11 July 1793.<ref name=Lievyns/>

In 1799, he was appointed to [[Jean Baptiste Jourdan]]'s general staff of the [[Army of the Danube]], garrisoned initially in [[Strasbourg]]. After crossing the Rhine in early March, the Army engaged [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles']] Austrian troops at the battles of [[Battle of Ostrach|Ostrach]] and [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach]]. Following defeat at Ostrach, the army was reorganized with the [[Army of Helvetia]], under command of [[Andre Massena]]. Hastrel received a staff appointment in [[Milan]].

[[Fran<U+00E7>ois Antoine Louis Bourcier]] served with Hastrel in the Army of the Danube. In 1800, he described Hastrel to Francois Nicolas Fririon:
::<blockquote> "The talents he has received from nature have been expanded by a careful education. His activities and services as the deputy of the general staff should make him eligible for promotion to a superior rank."<ref>{{fr icon}} Arthur Chuquet. ''Wissembourg: 1793.'' Paris : L. Cerf, 1893, p. 214.</ref> </blockquote>

In 1804, Etienne Hastrel became a member of the [[Legion of Honor]].<ref name=Lievyns/> For the campaigns of 1805 against Austria, of 1806 against Prussia, and of 1807 against Poland, he served on the staffs of [[Antoine-Fran<U+00E7>ois Andr<U+00E9>ossy]]. While in Warsaw in 1807, he was promoted to general of brigade. Upon his return to Germany, Hastrel was appointed to the staff of the Prince of Ponte-Corvo, [[Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], on 20 August 1809 and, later, to the staff of [[Nicolas Oudinot]] in Holland. Etienne Hastrel also served as the military governor of Neumarkt, in [[Neumark|K<U+00FC>strin]], [[Pomerania]], 15 February 1807 to May 1807,<ref>Ben Cahoon, "French Military Governors of Pomerania." ''[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Ger_Pruss.html Provinces of Prussia].'' 2001. Accessed 18 May 2010.</ref> and in the military government of Hamburg.<ref name=Lievyns/> In 1809, Napoleon sent Etienne Hastrel to Spain, to command the engineer park attached to French army. This included three companies of miners, nine companies of sappers, a battalion of mariners, another of sailors, four companies of ''pontonniers'' (bridge builders), four companies of pioneers (engineers), two companies of artillery, and park's own medical detachment, close to 5,000 men.<ref name=Elting>John Elting, ''Swords around the throne.'' New York: Da Capo Press, 1997, ISBN 0306807572, p. 271.</ref> On June 1810, he was rewarded as Commander of the Legion of Honor.<ref name=Lievyns/>

As chief of general staff of the Provisional Army of Germany, and later major general (after 1811) he was appointed 13 March 1812 as director-general of military conscription, a position which he held until the peace of 1814.<ref name=Lievyns/>

==Bourbon restoration==

[[Louis XVIII]] named him a Knight of [[Order of Saint Louis]] upon the restoration and placed  him command of the military of the [[Vosges]] in October. During the [[Hundred Days]], Napoleon appointed him as director of the Ministry of War.<ref name=Lievyns/> 

In 1816, the King appointed him to various inspector generalships from 1816 to 1823, and he retired in 1825.<ref name=critique>{{fr icon}} Guilliuame de Bertioer de Sauvigny et Alfred Fierro. ''Bibliographie critique des memoires sur la Restauration.'' Geneve: 1988, p. 135.</ref> During the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, he was recalled to the general staff, but he retired permanently in 1832. He became a grand officer of the Legion of Honor on 8 May 1835.<ref name=Lievyns/> During his retirement, he wrote his ''memoires'', which were published in 1833.<ref name=critique/>

He died 19 September 1846 at his home in [[Versailles]] and is buried at Cemetery of Notre Dame, at Versailles.<ref name=Seynaeve/> Sixty-one of his letters, written between 1806 and 1841, are preserved at the Public Library of France, under the title ''Belgique, Les f<U+00E8>tes de Bruges''.<ref>Minist<U+00E8>re de l'<U+00E8>ducation nationale.
