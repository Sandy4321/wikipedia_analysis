It introduces the character, Liz Lemon, who is the [[head writer]] of the fictional [[sketch comedy]] show, ''[[30 Rock#TGS with Tracy Jordan|The Girlie Show]]''. It also introduces ''The Girlie Show''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s new network executive, [[Jack Donaghy]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]) as well as the shows writers, cast, writers assistant, and the [[NBC page]], [[Kenneth Parcell]] ([[Jack McBrayer]]). The episode focuses on Jack trying to get Liz to hire [[loose cannon]] [[film star]] [[Tracy Jordan]] ([[Tracy Morgan]]) as part of ''The Girlie Show''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s cast. It also highlights some of ''The Girlie Show'' crews reactions to the addition of Jordan.<ref name="plotreference">{{cite episode |title=Pilot |episodelink=Pilot (30 Rock) |series=30 Rock |serieslink=30 Rock |credits=Writer(s): [[Tina Fey]]; Director: [[Adam Bernstein]] |network=[[NBC Universal]] |station=[[NBC]] |airdate=2006-10-11 |season=1 |number=1}}</ref>
 
==Plot==
Liz Lemon, the head writer of the fictional [[television series]] ''The Girlie Show'', is getting a hot dog before work when a conflict with a fellow commuter leads her to buy [[$]]150 worth of hot dogs. When she arrives at work, Liz and the producer [[Pete Hornberger]] ([[Scott Adsit]]) meet with ''The Girlie Show''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> new network executive Jack Donaghy. Jack alerts her that he would like her to hire Tracy Jordan, star of the film ''Honkey Grandma Be Trippin''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, as part of the cast. Liz is sceptical due to Tracy's past record of various insane stunts.

Liz gives in and meets with Tracy at a restaurant, which they have to leave because they serve food which Tracy does not like. Tracy and Liz then travel to a southern fried chicken restaurant. After the meeting, Tracy offers to take Liz back to the studio but, he makes a detour to a strip club in the [[Bronx]]. While trying to get home, Liz learns that Pete was fired earlier that day by Jack. Tracy and Liz eventually arrive at the studio halfway through the live broadcast of the show. Liz tells Tracy to go out on stage and talk which he does. This is much to co-star [[Jenna Maroney]]'s ([[Jane Krakowski]]) shock.<ref name="futoncriticpressrelease" /><ref name="plotreference" />

==Continuity==
"Pilot" is the first episode of ''30 Rock'' to allude to ''[[Star Wars]]''. ''Star Wars'' is referenced many times throughout the series. The allusion in this episode is featured during a flashback sequence in which Tracy ran down a highway shouting, "I am a [[Jedi]], I am a Jedi!"<ref name="plotreference" /> During the opening scene, when Liz buys a box of hot dogs, a song is heard which features the characters Jenna and [[Josh Girard]]([[Lonny Ross]]) singing. Although this exact song is not heard again, various arrangements can be heard throughout the series. The music heard in ''30 Rock'' is composed by [[Jeff Richmond]]. When preparing to meet with Tracy, Liz visits ''The Girlie Show''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> costume department and the costume designer [[List of recurring characters on 30 Rock#Other characters|Lee]] ([[Tom Broecker]]) gives her an outfit which he described as "[[Laura Bush]]". This "Laura Bush" outfit is seen again in a [[List of 30 Rock episodes#Season 2: 2007-2008|season two]] episode.<ref name="episode210">{{cite episode |title=Episode 210 |episodelink=Episode 210 |series=30 Rock |serieslink=30 Rock |credits=Writer(s): [[Robert Carlock]] & [[Donald Glover]]; Director: [[Richard Shepard]] |network=[[NBC Universal]] |station=[[NBC]] |airdate=2008-01-10 |season=2 |number=10}}</ref>
