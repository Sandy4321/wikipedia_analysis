'''Hong Kong International Airport''' {{Airport codes|HKG|VHHH}} is the main airport in [[Hong Kong]], [[People's Republic of China]]. It is colloquially known as '''Chek Lap Kok Airport''' (<U+8D64><U+9C72><U+89D2><U+6A5F><U+5834>), because it was built on the [[Islands and peninsulas of Hong Kong#Islands|island]] of [[Chek Lap Kok]] by [[land reclamation]], and also to distinguish it from its predecessor, the closed [[Kai Tak Airport]].

The airport opened for commercial operations in 1998, replacing Kai Tak, and is an important regional trans-shipment centre, passenger hub and gateway for destinations in [[Mainland China]] and the rest of [[Asia]]. Despite a relatively short history, Hong Kong International Airport has won seven [[Skytrax]] World Airport Awards in just ten years.<ref>{{cite web|title = Airport Star Ranking - 5 Star Airports|publisher = Skytrax|date= 2007|url = http://www.airlinequality.com/AirportRanking/5-Star.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | title =International travelers have voted Hong Kong Best Airport in the World .. | publisher =[[Skytrax]] | date =2008-07-14 | url = http://www.worldairportawards.com/Awards_2008/Airport2008.htm | accessdate =2008-07-14}}</ref>

HKIA also operates one of the world's largest passenger terminal buildings and operates twenty-four hours a day. In 2008, Hong Kong International Airport was the [[World's busiest airports by cargo traffic|second busiest airport in the world]] in terms of cargo traffic, handling 3,660,901 tons of cargo.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Airports Council International|title=Cargo Traffic 2008 FINAL|work=Airports Council International|accessdate=2009-08-12|date=2009-07-28|url=http://www.aci.aero/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&cp=1-5-54-4819_666_2__}}</ref> It was also the [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|12th busiest airport worldwide]] in terms of passenger throughput, registering  47,857,746.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Airports Council International|title=Passenger Traffic 2008 FINAL|work=Airports Council International|accessdate=2009-08-12|date=2009-07-28|url=http://www.aci.aero/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&cp=1-5-54-55_666_2__}}</ref> HKIA is the primary hub for [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Dragonair]], [[Hong Kong Express Airways]], [[Hong Kong Airlines]], [[Air Hong Kong]] <small>(cargo)</small> and Asia Jet <small>(private)</small>.

==History==
{{see also|Aviation history of Hong Kong}}

[[File:Hkia from lantau.JPG|thumb|left|[[Ngong Ping Skyrail]], Lantau Island]]
Chek Lap Kok Airport was designed as a replacement for the [[Kai Tak International Airport|former Hong Kong International Airport]] (commonly known as Kai Tak Airport) originally built in 1925. Located in the densely built-up [[Kowloon City District]] with a single runway extending into [[Kowloon Bay]], Kai Tak had only limited room for expansion to cope with steadily increasing air traffic.  By the 1990s, Kai Tak had become one of the world's busiest airports <U+2013> it far exceeded its annual passenger and cargo design capacities, and one out of every three flights met delays, largely due to lack of space for aircraft, gates, and a second runway.<ref>{{cite book | last = Genzberger | first = Christine | title = Hong Kong Business: The Portable Encyclopedia for Doing Business with Hong Kong | publisher = World Trade Press | date = 1994 | pages = 239 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=jzTkeovg_-MC&pg=PA239 | isbn = 9780963186478}}</ref> In addition, noise mitigation measures restricted nighttime flights, as severe noise pollution (exceeding 105&nbsp;[[dB(A)]] in Kowloon City) was estimated to adversely affect at least 340,000 people.<ref>{{cite paper | author = [http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/boards/advisory_council/maincontent.html Hong Kong Advisory Council on the Environment] | title = Proposal to Optimise Kai Tak Capacity | date = 1995-07 | url = http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/textonly/english/boards/advisory_council/files/ace_paper9531.pdf | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | accessdate = 2006-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Dempsey | first = Paul | title = Airport Planning and Development Handbook: A Global Survey | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | date = 1999 | location = | pages = 106 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=DLi4-CEGl4YC&pg=PA106 | isbn = 9780071343169}}</ref>

A 1974 planning study by the Hong Kong Civil Aviation and Public Works department identified the small island of Chek Lap Kok, off [[Lantau Island]], as a possible airport replacement site. Away from the congested city centre, flight paths would be routed over the [[South China Sea]] rather than populous urban areas, enabling efficient round-the-clock operation of multiple runways. Construction of the new airport, however, did not begin until 1991. The construction period was very rushed in which specialists considered only a 10-20 year period was sufficient for the massive project. Another cause for this rush was due to the uncertain future of the airport construction after the [[Handover of Hong Kong|Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]] to Communist China. It was originally believed that China would stop all construction despite the need for the new airport. At last, the airport did not finish in time for the Handover. However, the [[Communist Party of China]] gave an additional one year's grace period to finish the project. It was finished just in time.<ref name=buildhkg>{{cite episode | title = Building Hong Kong's Airport | series = Extreme Engineering | serieslink = Extreme Engineering | airdate = 2003-05-14 | season = 1 | number = 7}}</ref>

Hong Kong International Airport was built on a large [[artificial island]], formed by leveling [[Chek Lap Kok]] and [[Lam Chau]] islands (3.02&nbsp;km<U+00B2> and 0.08&nbsp;km<U+00B2> respectively), and [[land reclamation|reclaiming]] 9.38&nbsp;km<U+00B2> of the adjacent seabed. The 12.48&nbsp;km<U+00B2> airport site added nearly 1% to Hong Kong's total surface area; it connects to the north side of Lantau Island near [[Tung Chung]] [[new town]].<ref name=site_prep>{{cite book | author=Plant, G.W.; Covil, C.S; Hughes, R.A.; Airport Authority Hong Kong | title=Site Preparation for the New Hong Kong International Airport | publisher=Thomas Telford | year=1998 | pages=1, 3-4, 43, 556 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NVlGrr9WOp4C&printsec=frontcover | isbn=9780727726964}}</ref>

Construction of the new airport was only part of the [[Airport Core Programme]], which also involved construction of new road and rail links to the airport, with associated bridges and tunnels, and major land reclamation projects on both [[Hong Kong Island]] and in [[Kowloon]]. The project is the most expensive airport project ever, according to [[Guinness Book of World Records|Guinness World Records]]. Construction of the new airport was voted as one of the Top 10 Construction Achievements of the 20th Century at the ConExpo conference in 1999.<ref>CONEXPO-CON/AGG '99 (1999). ''[http://www.tfhrc.gov/pubrds/julaug99/topten.htm Top 10 Construction Achievements of the 20th Century]''. ISBN 0-9530219-5-5. Retrieved 10 November 2005.</ref>

With one of the world's largest airport terminals, the ability to withstand an intense typhoon was a major concern. The sides of the terminals, predominantly glass, were designed to break during high speed winds, relieving pressure and allowing the terminal to remain standing.<ref name=buildhkg/>

Opened on 6 July 1998, a week later than the new [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]], it took six years and US$20 billion to build. On that day at 6:25 a.m., Cathay Pacific's CX889 was the first commercial flight to land at the airport, pipping the original CX292 from Rome which was the scheduled first arrival. The [[architect]]s were the world-famous [[Foster and Partners]]. However, on the first day of opening, the airport had already started to experience some technical difficulties. The [[flight information display system]] (FIDS) had suddenly shut down which caused long delays. Shortly afterwards, the cargo communication link with Kai Tak, where all the data was stored, went down. In the same period of time, someone had accidentally deleted a critical database for cargo services. This meant that cargo had to be manually stored. At one point, the airport had to turn away freight headed for Hong Kong while it sorted out the mess. HKIA simply could not keep up without an automated computer assisting.<ref name=buildhkg/> For three to five months after its opening, it suffered various severe organisational, mechanical, and technical problems that almost crippled the airport. Computer glitches were to blame for the crisis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E4D91F3EF93AA35754C0A96E958260 |title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Problems Continue to Mount at New Hong Kong Airport |author = New York Times |date=1998-07-09}}</ref> At one time, the government reopened the [[cargo terminal]] at Kai Tak Airport to handle freight traffic because of a breakdown at the new cargo terminal, named Super Terminal One (ST1).<ref>{{Cite web

</ref> However, after six months the airport started to operate normally.

Officially opened in June 2007, the second airport terminal, called T2, (check-in facility only) is linked with the Airport Express Line with a new platform. The terminal also features a new shopping mall, [[Hong Kong SkyCity|SkyPlaza]], providing a large variety of shops and restaurants, together with a few entertainment facilities. T2 also houses a 36-bay coach station for buses to and from mainland China and 56 airline check-in counters, as well as customs and immigration facilities.

Besides T2, the SkyCity Nine Eagles Golf Course has been opened in 2007 whereas the second airport hotel, the Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel; and a permanent cross-boundary ferry terminal, the SkyPier, are slated to begin operation in 2008 and 2009 repectively. Development around T2 also includes the AsiaWorld-Expo which has started operation in late 2005. <ref>[http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/aboutus/scbrochure.html Hong Kong International Airport - About AA - SkyCity Brochure<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

A study for the ''HKIA Master Plan 2030'' is underway to examine whether and how infrastructures at HKIA - including airport access, terminal and apron facilities and a new runway - should be developed to support the economic growth of Hong Kong and the region.

==Operations==
[[File:Hong Kong International Airport (526352478).jpg|thumb|left|The airport control tower and a taxiing Airbus aircraft]]
The [[airport]] is operated by the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong]], a statutory body wholly owned by the Government of Hong Kong [[Special Administrative Region]]. The [[Civil Aviation Department (Hong Kong)|Civil Aviation Department]] (CAD) is responsible for the provision of air traffic control services, certification of Hong Kong registered aircraft, monitoring of airlines on their compliance with bilateral [[Air Services Agreement]]s, and the regulation of general [[civil aviation]] activities.

The airport has two parallel runways, both of which are 3800 metres in length and 60 metres wide, enabling them to cater to the next generation of aircraft. The south runway has been given a [[Instrument Landing System|Category II Precision Approach]], while the north runway has the higher Category IIIA rating, which allows pilots to land in only 200 metre visibility. The two runways have an ultimate capacity of over 60 aircraft movements an hour. At present there are 49 frontal stands, 28 remote stands and 25 cargo stands. Five parking bays at the Northwest Concourse are already capable of accommodating the arrivals of the next generation of aircraft. A satellite concourse with 10 frontal stands for narrow body aircraft is under construction to the north of the main concourse for commissioning by the end of 2009, bringing the total number of frontal stands at the airport to 59.

The airport was the third [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|busiest airport for passenger traffic]] in [[Asia]] in 2008, and the world's second busiest airport for cargo traffic in 2008. In terms of international traffic, the airport is the third busiest for passenger traffic and the busiest for cargo since its operation in 1998. There are 85 international airlines providing about 800 scheduled passenger and all-cargo flights each day between Hong Kong and some 150 destinations worldwide. About 76 percent of these flights are operated with wide-bodied jets. There are also an average of approximately 31 non-scheduled passenger and cargo flights each week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/business/about-the-airport/welcome.html|title=Our Business - The Airport - Welcome to HKIA - Hong Kong International Airport|author = Airport Authority Hong Kong|date=}}</ref>

The operation of scheduled air services to and from Hong Kong is facilitated by air services agreements between Hong Kong and other countries. Since the opening of HKIA, the [[Hong Kong Government|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government]] has implemented a policy of progressive [[liberalisation]] of air services with the intention of promoting consumer choice and competition. Many [[low-cost airlines]] have started various regional routes to compete head-on with full-service carriers on trunk routes.

The airport's long term expansion opportunities are subject to variables. A proposal to build a third runway has been under feasibility study and consultation but would be very expensive as it would involve additional reclamation from deep waters, and the building cost of the third runway may be as high as the building cost of the entire airport. On the other hand, there exists only one airway between Hong Kong and mainland China, and this single route is often and easily backed up causing delays on both sides. In addition, China requires that aircraft flying the single air route between Hong Kong and the mainland must be at an altitude of least 15,000 feet. Talks are underway to persuade the Chinese military to relax its airspace restriction in view of worsening air traffic congestion at the airport. Other than that, Hong Kong Airport Authority is cooperating with other airports in the area to relieve air traffic and in the future, Shenzhen may act as a regional airport while Hong Kong receives all the international flights.

==Air traffic==
===Main airlines based at HKIA===
[[File:Concept Plan for Lantau.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing airport location (in yellow) on the north shore of [[Lantau Island]]]]
Several airlines are based at Hong Kong International Airport:
* [[Cathay Pacific]] is the [[flag carrier]] of Hong Kong. Cathay operates a mixed all-widebody fleet of Airbuses and Boeings, providing scheduled services to destinations in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania.
** [[Dragonair]] <small>(regional)</small> operates narrow and widebody Airbus aircraft providing scheduled passenger services to the rest of Southeast Asia, Japan as well as Mainland China. It also operates freighter services to Mainland China.
*** [[Air Hong Kong|Air Hong Kong Limited]] <small>(cargo)</small> operates scheduled all-cargo services between Hong Kong and destinations in Asia.
* [[Hong Kong Express]] operates a narrow-body fleet of Boeing 737-800s with scheduled services throughout Asia. Hong Kong Express also operates a helicopter service to the areas within the [[Pearl River Delta]] region.
** [[Hong Kong Airlines]] only operates scheduled passenger services to destinations within China and Vietnam.

Recreational flying in Hong Kong is catered for by the [[Hong Kong Aviation Club]], which undertakes flying training for private pilots and provides facilities for private owners.

The [[Government Flying Service (Hong Kong)|Government Flying Service]] provides short and long range search and rescue services, police support, medical evacuation and general purpose flights for the Government.

===Passenger facilities===
[[File:HKIA-ME3B.JPG|thumb|right|Terminal 1 Departures Hall entrance]]
The airport is one of the most accessible in operation today. Despite its size, the passenger terminal is designed for maximum convenience. A simple layout and effective signage, moving walkways and the automated people mover allow quick and easy movement throughout the building. The airport also features the [[Hong Kong International Airport Automated People Mover|HKIA Automated People Mover]], a driverless [[people mover]] system consisting of 3 stations to provide fast transportation from the check-in area to the gates (and vice versa). These trains travel at 62&nbsp;km/h and the service is provided for free to all passengers and crew.

The airport has a total of 70 boarding gates <ref>[http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/interactive-map.html Hong Kong International Airport - Interactive Map]</ref>, with 63 [[jet bridge]] gates and seven virtual gates which are used as assembly points for passengers, who are then ferried to the aircraft by apron buses. Of the 63 jet bridges, five are capable of handling the [[Airbus A380]].

====Terminal 1====
Terminal 1 of the HKIA is currently the third largest airport passenger terminal building in the world (570,000 m<U+00B2>), after [[Dubai International Airport]]'s Terminal 3 (over 1,500,000m<U+00B2>) and [[Beijing Capital International Airport]]'s Terminal 3 (986,000 m<U+00B2><ref>[http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/olympiccities/beijing/n214259388.shtml The 'dragon' unveiled: Beijing's T3 starts operations - The Official Website of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>).

At its opening, Terminal 1 was the largest airport passenger terminal building, with a total gross floor area of 550,000 m<U+00B2>. It briefly conceded the status to [[Bangkok]]'s [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]] (563,000 m<U+00B2>) when the latter opened on 15 September 2006, but reclaimed the title when the East Hall was expanded, bring its total area to the current 570,000 m<U+00B2>. (The East Hall expansion included a 39,000 m<U+00B2> expansion to SkyMart, a shopping mall.) Terminal 1's title as the world's largest was surrendered to [[Beijing Capital International Airport]]'s Terminal 3 on 29 February 2008.

====Terminal 2====
Terminal 2 of the Hong Kong International Airport, together with the Skyplaza, opened on 28 February 2007 along with the opening of the [[Airport (MTR)|Airport Station's]] Platform 3<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://mtr.com.hk/eng/corporate/file_rep/PR-07-012-E.pdf Press release of platform 3 opening]|89.1&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 91318 bytes -->}}</ref>. It is only a check-in and processing facility for departing passengers with no gates or arrival facilities. (Passengers are transported underground to gates at Terminal 1.) So far [[AirAsia]], [[Bangkok Airways]], [[Hong Kong Express]], [[Hong Kong Airlines]], [[Jetstar Asia Airways]], [[Jet Airways]], [[Royal Jordanian Airlines]], [[Philippine Airlines]], [[Siem Reap Airways]], [[South African Airways]], [[Thai Airways International]] and [[Uni Air]] have relocated their check-in operations to T2. The [[Hong Kong SkyCity|SkyPlaza]] is situated within Terminal 2.

====Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre====
The Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre (BAC) is located within the confines of the airport and has its own terminal and facilities separate from the public terminal. It provides a full range of services for executive aircraft and passengers, including passenger lounge, private rooms and showers, business centre facilities, ground handling, baggage handling, fuelling, security, customs and flight planning. Designated spaces and hangarage are also provided at the BAC for private aircraft. [http://www.AsiaJet.com Asia Jet] also utilises this facility.

===Intermodal transportation hub===
[[File:Hong Kong International Airport.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of Terminal 1 at night-time, Hong Kong International Airport.]]
In order to sustain the growth of passengers, the Airport Authority formulated a <U+201C>push and pull through<U+201D> strategy to expand its connections to new sources of passengers and cargo. This means adapting the network to the rapidly-growing markets in China and in particular to the [[Pearl River Delta]] region (PRD). In 2003, two major events improved connections to the PRD. One was the opening of a new Airport-Mainland Coach Station. The coach station features a 230 m<U+00B2> waiting lounge and sheltered bays for ten coaches. The dedicated coach terminal provides a comfortable environment for passengers travelling between HKIA and different cities in the PRD. A huge number of buses are operating per day to transport passengers between HKIA and major cities in the Mainland.<ref>[http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/cbt/cross.html Transport to Guangdong]</ref>

The Coach Station was relocated to Terminal 2 in 2007. The 36 bays at the new Coach Station allow cross-border coaches to make 320 trips a day carrying passengers between the airport and 90 cities and towns in the PRD. Local tour and hotel coaches also operate from T2.<ref>[http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/business/about-the-airport/welcome.html Our Business - The Airport - Welcome to HKIA - Hong Kong International Airport]</ref>

HKIA<U+2019>s network to China is also expanded by the opening of SkyPier in late September 2003, offering millions in the PRD direct access to the airport. Passengers coming to SkyPier by high-speed ferries can board buses for onward flights while arriving air passengers can board ferries at the pier for their journeys back to the PRD. Passengers travelling both directions can bypass custom and immigration formalities, which reduces transit time. Four ports <U+2013> [[Shekou]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Macau]] and [[Humen Town|Humen]] ([[Dongguan]]) <U+2013> were initially served. As of August 2007, SkyPier serves [[Shenzhen]]'s [[Shekou]] and [[Fuyong]], [[Dongguan]]'s [[Humen Town|Humen]], [[Macau]], [[Zhongshan]] and [[Zhuhai]]. Moreover, passengers travelling from [[Shekou]] and [[Macau]] piers can even complete airline check-in procedures with participating airlines before boarding the ferries and go straight to the boarding gate for the connecting flight at HKIA. The provision of cross boundary coach and ferry services has transformed HKIA into an inter-modal transportation hub combining air, sea and land transport.

===Baggage and cargo facilities===
Ramp handling services are provided by [[Hong Kong Airport Services Limited]] (HAS), [[Jardine Air Terminal Services Limited]], and Menzies Aviation Group. Their services include the handling of mail and passenger baggage, transportation of cargo, aerobridge operations and the operation of passenger stairways. The airport has an advanced baggage handling system (BHS), the main section of which is located in the basement level of the passenger terminal, and a separate remote transfer facility at the western end of the main concourse for handling of tight connection transfer bags.

HKIA currently handles well over three million tonnes of cargo annually.<ref>[http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/afacilities/index.html Air Cargo - HKIA]</ref> Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited operates one of the two air cargo terminals at the airport. Its headquarters, the 328,000 m<U+00B2> SuperTerminal 1<ref>[http://www.hactl.com/en/superterminal/default.htm SuperTerminal 1]</ref>, is the world<U+2019>s second largest stand-alone air cargo handling facility, after the opening of the West Cargo Handling Area of the [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]] in 26 Mar 2008. The designed capacity is 2.6 million tonnes of freight a year. The second air cargo terminal is operated by Asia Airfreight Terminal Company Limited, and currently has a capacity of 1.5 million tonnes a year.<ref>[http://www.aat.com.hk/our_terminal/ Asia Airfreight Terminal - Our Terminal]</ref> It is envisaged that HKIA<U+2019>s total air cargo capacity per annum will reach nine million tonnes ultimately.<ref>[http://www.gov.hk/en/about/abouthk/factsheets/docs/civil_aviation.pdf Hong Kong: The Facts - Civil Aviation]</ref>

===Aircraft maintenance services===
Both line and base maintenance services are undertaken by [[HAECO|Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company]] (HAECO), while China Aircraft Services Limited (CASL) and Pan Asia Pacific Aviation Services Limited carry out line maintenance. Line maintenance services include routine servicing of aircraft performed during normal turnaround periods and regularly scheduled layover periods. Base maintenance covers all airframe maintenance services and, for this, HAECO has a three-bay hangar, which can accommodate up to three Boeing B747-400 aircraft and two Airbus A320 aircraft, and an adjoining support workshop. HAECO also has the world's largest mobile hangar, weighing over 400 tons. It can be used to enclose half of a [[wide-body]] airplane, so that the whole facility can fully enclose four 747s when the mobile hangar is used. A new two-bay hangar that locates next to the current one will be in operation by the end of 2006.

On 29 May 2009, [[China Aircraft Services Limited]] (CASL), a ramp services provider at the airport, opened its first aircraft maintenance hangar in the maintenance area of the airport. The new hangar occupies an area of about 10,000 square meters to accommodate one wide-body and one [[narrow-body]] aircraft at the same time, the hangar also has about 10,000 square meters area in its annex building.<ref>[http://www.casl.com.hk/about_news.html | CASL Hangar Grand Opening Ceremony Press Release]</ref>

===Airport based ground services===
[[File:HKIA Apron1.JPG|thumb|right|Hong Kong International Airport - Outside]]
The Air Traffic Control Complex (ATCX), located at the centre of the airfield, is the nerve centre of the entire air traffic control system. Some 370 air traffic controllers and supporting staff work around the clock to provide air traffic control services for the safe and efficient flow of aircraft movements within the [[Hong Kong Flight Information Region]] (FIR). At the Air Traffic Control Tower, controllers provide 24-hour aerodrome control services to aircraft operating at the airport. A Backup Air Traffic Control Centre/Tower constructed to the north of the ATCX is available for operational use in the event normal services provided in the ATCX are disrupted by unforeseen circumstances. Apart from serving as an operational backup, the facilities are also used for air traffic control training.

The Airport Meteorological Office (AMO) of the [[Hong Kong Observatory]] (HKO) provides weather services for the aviation community The AMO makes routine and special weather observations and provides fixed-time aerodrome forecasts and landing forecasts for the HKIA. It issues aerodrome warnings on adverse weather for protection of aerodrome facilities and aircraft on the ground. It also issues significant weather information on thunderstorms, [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[turbulence]], icing, and other hazardous weather which may affect aviation safety in the area within which Hong Kong is responsible for the provision of air traffic services. To enhance the safety of aircraft landing and taking off from HKIA, the AMO issues alerts of low-level [[windshear]] and turbulence.

Rescue and fire fighting services within the airport are covered by the Airport Fire Contingent of the [[Hong Kong Fire Services Department]]. The contingent has a strength of 282 uniformed members, operating two fire stations and two rescue berths for 24-hour emergency calls. It is equipped with 14 fire appliances which can respond to incidents within two minutes in optimum conditions of visibility and surface conditions, satisfying the relevant recommendation of the [[International Civil Aviation Organisation]]. Two high capacity rescue boats, supported by eight speed boats, form the core of sea rescue operations.

==Ground transport==
[[File:Airport MTR Station, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|right|Airport Express - Airport Station]]
[[File:Hong Kong Airport Inside.JPG|thumb|right|Hong Kong International Airport - Level 6, Terminal 1]]
[[File:Hong Kong International Airport, Arrival Hall 6, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|right|Hong Kong International Airport - Arrival Hall, Level 5]]
The new Hong Kong International Airport was built with ground-transportation considerations in mind connected by the [[North Lantau Highway]] on [[Lantau Island]], providing a fast and scenic link to inner Hong Kong. Getting to and from Hong Kong International Airport is therefore easy, convenient and relatively inexpensive.

Terminal-to-terminal travel is also quick and simple. Operated by the Airport Authority and maintained by [[MTR Corporation]], there is a [[Hong Kong International Airport Automated People Mover|automated people mover]] connecting the East Hall to the West Hall and newly opened Terminal 2. There are further plans for this people mover to be extended to SkyPier.

===Rail===
{{main|Rail transport in Hong Kong}}

The airport can be reached by the [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]], a dedicated rail link provided by the [[MTR]]. It takes 24 minutes to reach the airport from [[Hong Kong (MTR)|Hong Kong station]], thus awarding it the fastest mode of transport to get to the airport.<ref>[http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/trip-planner/gethere-airport.html Hong Kong Airport Transportation Information]</ref> It offers local MTR line connections along the line. In addition, both [[Hong Kong (MTR)|Hong Kong]] and [[Kowloon (MTR)|Kowloon]] stations provide complimentary and exclusive in-town check-in services for major airlines.

Passengers may also consider take the 1-minute journey to [[AsiaWorld-Expo]], which is also located in [[Chek Lap Kok]]. This segment of the [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]] started operations on 20 December 2005 to facilitate the opening of the expo.

In the latest policy address by Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, the chief executive of the Special Administrative Region, the government is also studying the feasibility of building a railway connecting between Hong Kong International Airport and [[Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport]] to provide further convenience to business and leisure travellers.<ref>[http://news.gov.hk/en/category/ontherecord/090212/html/090212en11001.htm Infrastructure projects boost economy]</ref>

===Bus===
{{main|Buses in Hong Kong}}

[[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]], [[New Lantao Bus]], [[Long Win Bus]] and Discovery Bay Bus all together operate 25 bus routes to the airport from various parts of Hong Kong, available at the Airport Ground Transportation Centre and Cheong Tat Road. The bus companies also offer 10 overnight "N" services since the airport is open 24-hours a day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/transport/to-from-airport/bus.html|title=Public Buses|publisher=Airport Authority Hong Kong|year=2009|accessdate=2009-03-26}} Note that I have included Discovery Bay services as per the schedule at [http://www.hkri.com/icms2/template?series=101&article=1054]</ref>

Coach service is available to major cities and towns in [[Guangdong]], such as [[Shenzhen]], [[Dongguan]] and [[Guangzhou]].

===Ferry===
Direct ferry services are available from the airport to various destinations throughout the [[Pearl River Delta]]. Passengers using these services are treated as transit passengers and are not considered to have entered Hong Kong for immigration purposes. For this reason, access to the ferry terminal is before immigration in the airport for arriving passengers. Check-in services are available at these piers. Four ports <U+2013> [[Shekou]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Macau]] and [[Humen Town|Humen]] ([[Dongguan]]) <U+2013> were initially served, extending to [[Guangzhou]] and [[Zhongshan]] at the end of 2003. The [[Zhuhai]] service began on 10 July 2007.<ref>[http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/infrastructureandlogistics/070710/html/070710en06002.htm New HK-Zhuhai ferry service starts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Taxi===
{{main|Taxicabs of Hong Kong}}

The airport is served by all three different types of taxi, distinguished by their colour:

*{{fontcolor|red|'''Urban taxis'''}} connect the Airport with [[Hong Kong Island]], [[Kowloon]], and parts of the new towns of [[Tsuen Wan]], [[Sha Tin]] and [[Tseung Kwan O]]. (Urban taxis can go anywhere in Hong Kong except southern [[Lantau Island]]).
*{{fontcolor|green|'''New Territories taxis'''}} connect the airport with the [[New Territories]], except those parts of the Tsuen Wan, Sha Tin and Tseung Kwan O served by urban taxis.
*{{fontcolor|blue|'''Lantau taxis'''}} connect the airport with the rest of [[Lantau Island]].

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 22 August 1999, [[Mandarin Airlines Flight 642|China Airlines Flight 642]] (an [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]] operated by subsidiary Mandarin Airlines), which was landing in [[1999 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Sam (Luding)|Typhoon Sam]] at Hong Kong International Airport en route from Bangkok International Airport (now [[Bangkok]] [[Don Mueang International Airport]]) to Hong Kong, rolled over and caught fire, coming to rest upside down beside the runway. Three people onboard were killed.

* On 31 July 2000 a man, armed with a pistol, forced his way through a security checkpoint and held a woman [[hostage]] on a Cathay Pacific aircraft. The man surrendered after two and a half hours. {{PDFlink|[http://www.skyjack.co.il/pdf/Criminal_Acts_Against_Civil_Aviation_2000.pdf]|1.92&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 2018139 bytes -->}}

*On 8 July 2008, [[Air China]] Flight 103, a [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-300]] from [[Tianjin Binhai International Airport|Tianjin]] bumped into an engineering vehicle after landing. There were no injuries; however, the wing of the aircraft was slightly damaged after the collision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-07/08/content_8510176.htm|title=Plane runs into engineering vehicle in Hong Kong, no casualty reported|publisher=Xinhua News Corp|date=2008-07-08|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref>
