'''The Wilkinsons''' is a [[country music]] trio from [[Trenton, Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Founded in 1997, the group comprises lead singer [[Amanda Wilkinson]], her brother Tyler Wilkinson, and their father, Steve Wilkinson. The Wilkinsons achieved success late in 1998 with the hit single "[[26 Cents]]", a Number One on the Canadian country music charts and Top 5 hit on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. It was followed by "[[Fly (The Angel Song)]]", also a No.&nbsp;1 in Canada.

Although their U.S. success waned after "26 Cents", The Wilkinsons have continued to have singles in the charts in Canada. Lead singer Amanda Wilkinson has also created several solo recordings in addition to her career in The Wilkinsons.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Steve Wilkinson was born on August 18, 1955 in [[Belleville, Ontario]], [[Canada]].<ref>http://www.thewilkinsons.tv/bios.htm</ref> Before the country trio was formed, he was struggling to make ends meet after he lost his job at a nuclear power plant due to downsizing. He took menial jobs in order to provide for his family, but his real passion was [[music]]. Their success in the music world began in 1998 when The Wilkinsons moved to the heart of country music, [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Steve and his wife, Christine, along with their three children Amanda, Tyler and Kiaya arrived in Nashville with an old 1982 yellow [[Cadillac]] pulling a tent trailer and with $17,000 to their name.

They performed at an [[Atlanta]] club for an investor showcase where [[Mark Wills]] asked if he could perform "26 Cents". Steve turned down the offer made by Wills, though he regretted his decision during the four hour drive back to Nashville. However, Steve<U+2019>s regret was short lived when [[Reese Wilson]] invited the group to sing in Nashville<U+2019>s famous [[Broken Spoke]] nightclub. The Wilkinsons amazed the crowd and a record company bidding war commenced. They had been in Nashville for just ten days. While the war ensued, the group met and sang for [[Vince Gill]]. Gill was moved to tears by fifteen-year-old Amanda<U+2019>s powerful voice and surprised the trio by inviting them to sing on the stage of the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Gill accompanied The Wilkinsons with the song "I<U+2019>m So Lonesome I Could Cry". Shortly after, the group signed with [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]].

===Breakthrough===
The Wilkinsons' first album, ''[[Nothing But Love (album)|Nothing But Love]]'', reached No.&nbsp;16 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top Country Albums charts in 1998. The trio have been nominated for the [[Country Music Association]]'s Horizon Award and Vocal Group of the Year and for Single of the Year by the [[Academy of Country Music|Academy of Country Music Awards]]. Their second album, ''[[Here and Now (The Wilkinsons album)|Here and Now]]'', won the [[Canadian Country Music Association]] award for Best Album. The band has received nine Canadian Country Music Awards, one [[Juno Award]] and two [[Grammy]] nominations (both for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group).<ref>http://www.winspearcentre.com/content.asp?contentid=645&catid=20&rootid=6</ref>

===Move to BNA Records===
In 2001, after the release of their third album ''[[Shine (The Wilkinsons album)|Shine]]'', the singing family trio asked for and were given release by [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] when it closed its Nashville division. Shortly thereafter the trio was signed to [[BNA Records]]. Weeks before the release of their first single for BNA, the label's president wanted Amanda to record a solo album, which would ultimately disband the trio. The trio eventually left the label and signed with the independent Canadian label [[Open Road Records]] for their 2005 album, ''[[Highway (The Wilkinsons album)|Highway]]''.

===Solo work===
Amanda Wilkinson signed with [[Universal South Records]] and released her solo debut album, ''[[Amanda Wilkinson (album)|Amanda Wilkinson]]''. Amanda received four nominations at the 2006 [[Canadian Country Music Awards]] (Single of the Year, CMT Video of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, and Album of the Year).

Tyler started the [[alternative rock]] band Motion Picture Ending. The band is composed of [[drummer]] and long-time friend Justin Devries, [[bassist]] Curtis Weekes, [[guitarist]] Greg Bolton and lead singer and guitarist Tyler Wilkinson.

===''Greatest Hits<U+2026> and Then Some''===
In 2007, The Wilkinsons won Independent Group of the Year at the Canadian Country Music Awards.

''[[Greatest Hits<U+2026> and Then Some (The Wilkinsons album)|Greatest Hits<U+2026> and Then Some]]'', a [[greatest hits]] album, was released on October 7, 2008. The first single, "When I'm Old", was released in mid 2008.

===Small Town Pistols===
Amanda and Tyler Wilkinson have teamed up as a duo to be called Small Town Pistols and will release an album together in Canada in late 2012.

==Reality television==
{{main|The Wilkinsons (TV series)}}
The Wilkinsons were also the subject of a fictionalized [[reality television|"reality" television program]] on the [[CMT Canada]] network, ''The Wilkinsons''. The show follows the family as they move back to [[Quinte|The Quinte Area]], [[Ontario]], from [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. In 2006, the show was nominated for Country Music Program or Special of the Year at the Canadian Country Music Awards.
