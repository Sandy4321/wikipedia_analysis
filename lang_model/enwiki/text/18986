The '''Fabyan Windmill''' is an authentic, working [[Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[windmill]] dating from the 1850s located in [[Geneva, Illinois]]. The {{convert|68|ft|m}}, five-[[Storey|story]] [[wood]]en [[smock mill]] sits upon the onetime estate of Colonel [[George Fabyan]], but is now part of the [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane County]] [[Nature reserve|Forest Preserve]] District.

In 1979, the windmill was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The following year, the windmill was selected to be on a [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States|U.S. postage stamp]] as part of a series of five American windmills included in a stamp booklet called "WINDMILLS USA".<ref name="KCForestPreserve">{{cite web

==History==
During the mid-19th century, the Fabyan Windmill was constructed by [[Germans|German]] craftsmen, Louis Blackhaus,<ref name="KCForestPreserve"/> and his brother-in-law Freidrick Brockmann, on a site at Meyers Road near 16th Street in [[York Township, DuPage County, Illinois|York Township]] between [[Elmhurst, Illinois|Elmhurst]] and [[Oak Brook, Illinois]] (now [[Lombard, Illinois]]).<ref name="FabyanWindmillBrochure"/><ref name="FabyanLegacy">{{Cite book

By the early 20th century, the windmill had fallen into a state of disrepair. In 1914, George Fabyan purchased the disused windmill for approximately $8,000 from Mrs. Fred Runge. He then had it moved to its present location in Geneva just on the east side of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]], close to [[Illinois Route 25]] in July 1915. Fabyan spent an estimated $75,000 to have it moved, reconstructed, and restored.<ref name="FabyanWindmillBrochure"/><ref name="FabyanLegacy"/>

The Edgar E. Belding Company of [[West Chicago, Illinois|West Chicago]] was contracted by Fabyan to move the windmill from York Center. It was slowly dismantled piece by piece, with [[Roman numerals]] carved into the [[beam (structure)|beams]] and braces to facilitate correct reconstruction. Some of the largest beams had to be hauled by a team of [[mule]]s.<ref name="FabyanWindmillBrochure"/><ref name="FabyanLegacy"/>

The windmill was reassembled on its present site by a [[Danish people|Danish]] [[millwright]] named Rasmussen, with the assistance of John Johnson and six others from the Wilson Bros. Construction Co. After nineteen months, the relocation and reconstruction were completed.<ref name="FabyanWindmillBrochure"/><ref name="FabyanLegacy"/><ref name="KanePostcards"/><ref name="ILWindmills">{{cite web

The mill was a wonder in its day, because it is thought to be the only fully automatic wind-driven mill of its type.<ref name="FabyanLegacy"/>

George Fabyan died in 1936, and his wife died two years later. The estate was then sold by the executors of the will to the Kane County Forest Preserve District for $70,500.<ref name="ILWindmills"/>

==Structure==
{{for|an explanation of the machinery|mill machinery}}
The giant [[cypress]] wood beams, trimmed with [[Juglans nigra|black walnut]], are all hand [[Woodworking joints|joined]] and [[dowel]]ed with wood dowels.<ref name="KCForestPreserve"/><ref name="FabyanLegacy"/> In fact, there are no metal nails used inside the structure.<ref name="KanePostcards"/> Even the original [[gear]]ing was handmade of [[hickory]] and [[maple]], with all five floors containing different [[mill machinery|mechanisms]].<ref name="FabyanWindmillBrochure"/><ref name="FabyanLegacy"/><ref name="KanePostcards"/><ref name="ILWindmills"/>

The windmill was a functioning mill used by the Fabyans for grinding several types of [[grain]], including [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rye]], and [[oats]]. It also served as a grain mill for Fabyan's herd of prized [[Jersey cattle]].<ref name="FabyanLegacy"/>

At the mill's top, or cap, is a huge [[gear|cogged wheel]] called the brake wheel, which was turned by wind blowing against the [[Windmill sail|sails]]. The sails are covered with canvas sailcloths to help catch the wind. The sails had to be entirely reconstructed by Rasmussen and John Johnson, because they were missing when Fabyan bought the mill. The brake wheel, located in the cap, rotates an [[driveshaft|upright shaft]] running the height of the mill. This shaft supplied power to all of the mill's operations.<ref name="FabyanWindmillBrochure"/><ref name="FabyanLegacy"/>

There is a set of belt-driven [[grain elevator|elevators]], remarkable for its time, that moved the grains from [[Chute (gravity)|chute]]s to [[hopper]]s, and even from floor to floor, making the mill almost fully automatic. Most other mills required workers to hand shovel materials between operations.<ref name="FabyanWindmillBrochure"/><ref name="FabyanLegacy"/>

During its reconstruction, the Colonel had a new [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] poured, which created a [[basement]]. In the basement, he had ovens installed whose vents and chimney extended underground beneath Route 25 to a structure that once stood on the other side. In addition to the ovens, marble slabs and cooling racks were also installed.<ref name="FabyanLegacy"/> It is thought that at one time, the windmill basement was an operating [[bakery]]. During the flour [[Rationing#Civilian rationing|rationing]] of [[World War I]], the bakery supposedly produced bread for the Fabyan family and even for their two bears, Tom and Jerry.<ref name="GenevaPostcards"/><ref name="KCForestPreserve2">{{cite web

==Today==
Kane County considered the windmill's [[demolition]] as early as 1990 when it became structurally unsafe for public inspection. However, local citizens began fighting to keep the mill intact. In 1997, the Forest Preserve District contracted third-generation Dutch windmill maker [[Lucas Verbij]] to fully [[building restoration|restore]] the windmill for a cost of over $900,000. It made its public debut in June 2005.<ref name="KCForestPreserve"/><ref name="ILWindmills"/>

{{quote|The Fabyan Windmill is the best example of an authentic Dutch windmill in the United States, actually it's a treasure and would be the most popular windmill in the [[Netherlands]] (we currently have 1000 windmills).|Lucas Verbij<ref name="KCForestPreserve"/>}}

The grinding mechanisms to make flour have been restored and are in use today by mill volunteers who do demonstrations to the public.<ref name="KCForestPreserve"/> 

Even now, the [[varnish]] from 1915 is in near perfect condition because the climate inside the mill varies little from season to season due to its superior construction,<ref name="FabyanLegacy"/> and the Roman numeral markings carved into the beams used in original reconstruction are still visible.<ref name="KCForestPreserve"/>
