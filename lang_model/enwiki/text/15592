The '''K-152 ''Nerpa''''' ({{lang-ru|<U+041A>-152 <U+00AB><U+041D><U+0435><U+0440><U+043F><U+0430><U+00BB>}}) is a {{convert|8140|t|long ton|adj=on}} [[Project 971 Shchuka-B]] (NATO: [[Akula class submarine|Akula II]]) type [[Nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered]] [[attack submarine]].  Construction was started in 1993, but suspended due to lack of funding. ''K-152 Nerpa'' was launched in October 2008 and was planned to be leased to the [[Indian Navy]] in 2009 as the recommissioned '''INS ''Chakra'''''.

While ''K-152 Nerpa'' was undergoing sea trials in the [[Sea of Japan]] on 8 November 2008, an accident caused the deaths of some twenty sailors and injury to twenty-one others.  A fire suppression system discharged gas in the bow of the sub, suffocating civilian specialists and navy crew members.  

==Construction==
The ''Nerpa'' was laid down at the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]] shipyard in 1993, but its completion was delayed for nearly a decade due to a lack of funds caused by the economic crisis of the early 1990s.<ref name="KP">{{cite news|title=Twenty Persons Perished Aboard a Submarine Due to a Defective Fire-Extinguishing System| publisher=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]|date= 9 November 2008}}</ref>  The partly-constructed vessel was mothballed until 2004, when Rosprom (the Federal Agency for Industry) signed an agreement with the [[India]]n government to complete the submarine and lease it to the Indian Navy. The vessel was intended to be completed by 2007, but underwent further delays. In 2007, it was transferred to the Vostok shipyard in the [[closed city]] of [[Bolshoy Kamen]], [[Primorsky Krai]], for fitting-out. It was launched in October 2008 for sea trials, following which it was due to be handed over to the Russian Defence Ministry.<ref name="KP2">{{cite news|title=In Its First Trials the Submarine Nerpa Leaked at the Seams|publisher=Komsomolskaya Pravda|date= 9 November 2008}}</ref> Reports in the Indian media suggest that the resumption of construction was underwritten with Indian funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinelog.com/DOCS/NEWSMMVII/2008nov00090.html |title=Shipping, Shipbuilding And Offshore News |publisher=Marine Log |date= |accessdate=2008-11-11}}</ref> 

The standards of the vessel's construction were criticised by several commentators. Alexander Golts, defense editor of the ''[[The Other Russia|Yezhednevny Zhurnal]]'' newspaper, said that in the 1980s, the Amur shipyard turned out submarines "one after another, like pancakes,"<ref name="newsweek">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/168382 |title=Behind the Russian Sub Disaster.  |publisher=[[Newsweek]]|date= |accessdate=2008-11-11}}</ref> but from 1993 to 2008 had produced just one. "The old specialists had left, and the new ones lacked professionalism."<ref name="newsweek"/>  An unnamed worker at the Amur shipyard told ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' that there were "questions about the quality of the metal that was used in building the nuclear submarine", some of which had been bought from China, and alleged that "when the first trials of the submarine were carried out water was leaking in between the seams! So it is not surprising that the work dragged on."<ref name="KP2" />

==Pending lease to India==
{{As of|2008}}, Russia had an agreement pending with [[India]] worth US$2 billion for the lease of ''Nerpa'' and another Project 971 Shchuka-B class submarine.<ref name="AFP">{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hD_OJemR184COjKR32WI3G3He4cw|title=More than 20 killed in Russian nuclear sub accident: spokesman|publisher=[[AFP]]|date=2008-11-09|accessdate=2008-11-18}}</ref> Of this, ''K-152 Nerpa'' will be leased for 10 years to India at an estimated cost of US$650 million.

A Russian defense industry official denied that talks had been held with India on the delivery of the nuclear submarine.

General of the Army Nikolai Marakov stated that Russia would commission the ''Nerpa'' and that it would join seven other Akula class submarines in Russia's [[Pacific Ocean Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]]. "The sum of $650-780 million, which Rosoboronexport and the Amur Shipbuilding Plant had negotiated over a long period of time with the Indian Ministry of Defense, will now be found in Russia," he said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081118/118370554.html|title=Nerpa nuclear submarine to join Russian Navy - top brass|publisher=RIA Novosti|accessdate=2008-11-20|date-18 November 2008}}</ref>

==Previous Russian naval vessels named ''Nerpa''==
The ''K-152 Nerpa'' is the second Russian submarine to be commissioned with the name ''Nerpa''. The first ''Nerpa'' was a 645 ton [[Morzh class submarine|''Morzh'' class submarine]] which was laid down at [[Nikolayev]] on 25 June 1911, along with its sister submarines ''Morzh'' and ''Tyulen''. It commenced trials from Sevastopol in December 1914 and operated the first war patrol by a [[Imperial Russian Navy]] submarine between 5 and 8 March 1915. The ''Nerpa'' served two and a half years in the [[Black Sea]] during [[World War I]], operating off the [[Bosporus]] against [[Kaiserliche Marine|German]] and [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman Turkish]] naval forces.<ref name="polmar">{{cite book|author=Polmar, Norman; Noot, Jurrien. |title=Submarines of the Russian and Soviet Navies, 1718-1990|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1991|isbn= 0870215701}}</ref>

The ''Nerpa'' went into refit in 1917 at Nikolayev but was unable to return to sea until 1922 because of a shortage of essential parts. It was recommissioned on 3 June 1922 by the [[Soviet Navy]] under the name ''Politruk'' ("political instructor") and in 1923 it was designated No. 11. The vessel was decommissioned on 3 December 1930 and was sold for scrap in February 1931.<ref name="polmar" />
