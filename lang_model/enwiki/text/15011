==Biography==
Born in 1883 in [[Galeana, Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n]], Nava attended the state's teachers' training college and in 1900, became headmistress of the high school in [[Tula, Tamaulipas]]. In 1904, she helped establish La Sociedad Protectora de la Mujer, known for being [[Mexico City]]'s oldest feminist society.<ref name="Lavrin1978">{{cite book|last=Lavrin|first=Asunci<U+00F3>n|title=Latin American Women: Historical Perspectives|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZesYBntxhqgC&pg=PA295|year=1978|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-20309-1|pages=295<U+2013>}}</ref> In 1909, in Mexico City, she took part in activities opposing the government of [[Porfirio D<U+00ED>az]]. Together with [[Dolores Jim<U+00E9>nez y Muro|Dolores Jim<U+00E9>nez Muro]], she drafted anti-government articles in [[Cuautla]] and other cities in the state of [[Morelos]].<ref name=dde/> In 1910, she and Muro founded the Club Femenil Antirreeleccionista Hijas de Cuauht<U+00E9>moc (Anti-Reelectionist Women's Club: Daughters of Cuauht<U+00E9>moc). The arrest of her husband was hastened by the meetings that she organized at their house.<ref name=mitchell>{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=edited by Stephanie|last2=Schell|first2=Patience A.|title=The women's revolution in Mexico, 1910-1953|date=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=0742537315|pages=19<U+2013>23|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dIaVlXWO91cC&pg=PA23}}</ref> She contributed to opposition newspapers in Mexico City including ''Diario del Hogar''. In 1913, she fought against [[Victoriano Huerta]] earning the title of Veteran of the Revolution.<ref name=dde/> She was working as a teacher, but she was also distributing deditious pamphlets in the city that had been printed by [[Mar<U+00ED>a Arias Bernal]]. She and Muro also wrote a manifesto against Huerta, [[Aureliano Blanquet]] and [[F<U+00E9>lix D<U+00ED>az (politician)|F<U+00E9>lix D<U+00ED>az]]. Eventually, the two of them left the state capital to become [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatista]]s and to raise money for their cause. Muro was made a colonel whilst she was put in charge of communication with the forces in [[Teziutlan]]. They were both commissioned to carry out tasks by [[Emiliano Zapata]]<ref name=mitchell/> 

She is also remembered for founding the [[Centro Feminista Mexicano]], the country's first feminist association,<ref name=dde>{{cite book|title=Diccionario de escritores mexicanos, siglo XX: N-Q|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7MWFzOV4-fAC&pg=PA14|year=1988|publisher=UNAM|isbn=978-970-32-0509-7|pages=13<U+2013>}}</ref> and for being an organizer of the Club Femenil Antireeleccionista "Hijas de Cuauhtemoc", a group of revolutionary women opposed to the re-election of [[Bernardo Reyes]]. Because of her defense of the ''[[maderism]]'' movement and for her public condemnation of General [[Victoriano Huerta]], Nava was put in jail. Upon her release, she continued to oppose Huerta and continued to support the idea of a society led by workers.<ref name="Hern<U+00E1>ndez2014">{{cite book|last=Hern<U+00E1>ndez|first=Sonia|title=Working Women Into the Borderlands|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=poz0AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA85|date=18 February 2014|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|isbn=978-1-62349-040-9|pages=85<U+2013>}}</ref>

In 1922, together with [[Mar<U+00ED>a Penteria Meza]], she represented the Feminist Council at the Pan-American Women's Conference in [[Baltimore]] which was also attended by the Mexican delegates [[Elena Torres]], [[Eulalia Guzm<U+00E1>n]] and [[Luz Vera]].<ref>{{cite web|url=|title=M<U+00E1>s de un siglo de feminismo en M<U+00E9>xico |publisher=Mundana|author=Gabriela Cano|accessdate=19 March 2015 |language=Spanish}}</ref>

==Contribution to social work==
Nava founded Mexico's first educational institution for social work, the Escuela de Ense<U+00F1>anza Dom<U+00E9>stica (Domestic Education School). Preparatory work had started in 1926 but official recognition came only on 2 February 1933. In that year, the [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretariat of Public Education]] founded a social study program, and Nava taught it.<ref name="Sanders2011">{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=Nichole|title=Gender and Welfare in Mexico: The Consolidation of a Postrevolutionary State|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rxfTwWgFC9IC&pg=PA125|year=2011|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04887-5|pages=125<U+2013>}}</ref> The school was inspired by Nava's visit to the US where she had been in touch with schools for social workers. Thanks to the impetus of the school, the profession became recognized in Mexico as women began to take up employment as social workers in 1936.<ref name="Rosado2004">{{cite book|last=Rosado|first=Manuel S<U+00E1>nchez|title=Manual de trabajo social|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RYbuGh9wZywC&pg=PA28|date=30 March 2004|publisher=Plaza y Valdes|isbn=978-970-722-275-5|pages=28<U+2013>|language=Spanish}}</ref>
