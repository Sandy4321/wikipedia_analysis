The '''origin of language''' in the [[humans|human species]] has been the topic of scholarly discussions for several centuries.  In spite of this, there is no consensus on its ultimate origin or age. One problem that makes the topic difficult to study is the lack of direct evidence, since neither languages nor the ability to produce them fossilizes. Consequently, scholars wishing to study the origins of language must draw inferences from other kinds of evidence such as the [[human evolution|fossil record]] or from archaeological evidence, from contemporary language diversity, from studies of [[language acquisition]], and from comparisons between human [[language]] and systems of communication existing [[Animal communication|among other animals]], particularly [[Great ape language|other primates]]. It is generally agreed that the origins of language are closely tied to the origins of [[behavioral modernity|modern human behavior]], but there is little agreement about the implications and directionality of this connection.

This fact that [[empirical evidence]] is limited has led many scholars to regard the entire topic as unsuitable for serious study. In 1866, the [[Linguistic Society of Paris]] went so far as to ban debates on the subject, a prohibition which remained influential across much of the western world until late in the twentieth century.<ref>Stam, J. H. 1976. Inquiries into the origins of language.

==Approaches==
Approaches to the origin of language can be divided according to their underlying assumptions. 'Continuity theories' are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form: it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our primate ancestors. 'Discontinuity theories' are based on the opposite idea <U+2014> that language is a unique trait so it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and must therefore have appeared fairly suddenly during the course of human evolution. Another contrast is between theories that see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, and those that see it as a system that is mainly cultural <U+2014> that is, learned through social interaction.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ulbaek, Ib|year=1998|chapter=The Origin of Language and Cognition|title=''Approaches to the evolution of language''|editor=J. R. Hurford & C. Knight|pages=30<U+2013>43|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref>

[[Noam Chomsky]] is a prominent proponent of discontinuity theory.  He argues that a single chance mutation occurred in one individual on the order of 100,000 years ago, triggering the 'instantaneous' emergence of the language faculty (a component of the mind-brain) in 'perfect' or 'near-perfect' form. The philosophical argument runs, briefly, as follows: firstly, from what is known about evolution, any biological change in a species arises by a random genetic change in a single individual which spreads throughout its breeding group. Secondly, from a computational perspective on the theory of language: the only change that was needed was the cognitive ability to construct and process recursive data structures in the mind (the property of "[[recursion#Recursion_in_language|discrete infinity]]", which appears to be unique to the human mind). This genetic change, which endowed the human mind with the property of discrete infinity, Chomsky argues, essentially amounts to a jump from being able to count up to N, where N is a fixed number, to being able to count indefinitely (i.e. if N can be constructed then so can N+1).  It follows from these assertions that the evolution of the human language faculty is [[Saltation (biology)|saltational]] since, as a matter of logical fact, there is no way to gradually transition from a mind capable only of counting up to a fixed number, to a mind capable of counting indefinitely.  The picture then, by loose analogy, is that the formation of the language faculty in humans is akin to the formation of a crystal; discrete infinity was the seed crystal in a super-saturated primate brain, on the verge of blossoming into the human mind, by physical law, once a single small, but crucial, key stone was added by evolution.<ref>Chomsky, N.

Continuity based theories are currently held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Among those who see language as being mostly innate, some <U+2014> notably [[Steven Pinker]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pinker | first1 = S. | last2 = Bloom | first2 = P.  | year = 1990 | title = Natural language and natural selection | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 707<U+2013>84 }}</ref> <U+2014> avoid speculating about specific precursors in nonhuman primates, stressing simply that the language faculty must have evolved in the usual gradualistic way.<ref>Pinker, S.

Because the emergence of language is located so far back in human prehistory, the relevant developments have left no direct historical traces; nor can comparable processes be observed today. Despite this, the emergence of new sign languages in modern times <U+2014> [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], for example <U+2014> might potentially offer insights into the developmental stages and creative processes necessarily involved.<ref>Kegl, J., A.

Knight (eds), ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 62-92.</ref>

The time range for the evolution of language and/or its anatomical prerequisites extends, at least in principle, from the phylogenetic divergence of ''[[Homo]]'' (2.3 to 2.4 million years ago) from ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]'' (5 to 6 million years ago) to the emergence of full [[behavioral modernity]] some 150,000 - 50,000 years ago. Few dispute that ''Australopithecus'' probably lacked vocal communication significantly more sophisticated than that of [[great ape]]s in general,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Arcadi | first1 = A. C. | year = 2000 | title = Vocal responsiveness in male wild chimpanzees: implications for the evolution of language | url = | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 205<U+2013>223 }}</ref> but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as ''[[Homo habilis]]'', while others place the development of symbolic communication only with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million years ago) or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (0.6 million years ago) and the development of language proper with ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' less than 200,000 years ago.  

Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages today, [[Johanna Nichols]] <U+2014> a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley <U+2014> argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in our species at least 100,000 years ago.<ref>Johanna Nichols, 1998.

(Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences, 24.)

Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity. ''PLoS ONE'' 7(4): e35289. Doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035289.</ref> Estimates of this kind are independently supported by genetic, archaeological, palaeontological and much other evidence suggesting that language probably emerged somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa during the Middle Stone Age, roughly contemporaneous with the speciation of ''Homo sapiens.''<ref>Botha, R. and C. Knight (eds) 2009. ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>   

Linguists agree that, apart from such things as [[pidgin]]s, there are no "primitive" languages: all modern human populations speak languages of comparable expressive power,<ref>Pinker, S. (2003) Language as an adaptation to the cognitive niche, in M. H. Christiansen and S. Kirby (eds), ''Language Evolution''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 16-37.</ref> though much recent scholarship has explored how linguistic complexity varies between and within languages over historical time.<ref>Sampson, G., D.

==Language origin hypotheses==

===Early speculations===
{{quotation|I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man<U+2019>s own instinctive cries.|{{Citation|title=''Charles Darwin, 1871.''

London: Murray, p. 56.</ref>}}}}In 1861, historical linguist Max M<U+00FC>ller published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language:<ref>M<U+00FC>ller, F. M. 1996 [1861]. The theoretical stage, and the origin of language. Lecture 9 from Lectures on the Science of Language. Reprinted in R. Harris (ed.), ''The Origin of Language.'' Bristol: Thoemmes Press, pp. 7-41.</ref> 

* '''Bow-wow'''. The ''[[Bow-wow theory|bow-wow]]'' or ''cuckoo'' theory, which M<U+00FC>ller attributed to the German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], saw early words as imitations of the cries of beasts and birds.
* '''Pooh-pooh'''. The ''Pooh-Pooh'' theory saw the [[Interjectional theory|first words as emotional interjections and exclamations]] triggered by pain, pleasure, surprise and so on.
* '''Ding-dong'''. M<U+00FC>ller suggested what he called the ''Ding-Dong'' theory, which states that all things have a vibrating natural resonance, echoed somehow by man in his earliest words.
* '''Yo-he-ho'''. The ''yo-he-ho'' theory saw language emerging out of collective rhythmic labour, the attempt to synchronise muscular effort resulting in sounds such as ''heave'' alternating with sounds such as ''ho''.
* '''Ta-ta'''. This did not feature in Max M<U+00FC>ller's list, having been proposed in 1930 by Sir Richard Paget.<ref>Paget, R. 1930. ''Human speech: some observations, experimenrts, and conclusions as to the nature, origin, purpose and possible improvement of human speech.'' London: Routledge & Kegan Paul.</ref> According to the ''ta-ta'' theory, humans made the earliest words by tongue movements that mimicked manual gestures, rendering them audible.

Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong<U+2014>they occasionally offer peripheral insights<U+2014>as comically na<U+00EF>ve and irrelevant.<ref>Firth, J. R. 1964. ''The Tongues of Men and Speech.'' London: Oxford University Press, pp. 25-6.</ref><ref>Stam, J. H. 1976. ''Inquiries into the origins of language.'' New York: Harper and Row, p. 243-44.</ref> The problem with these theories is that they are so narrowly mechanistic. They assume that once our ancestors had stumbled upon the appropriate ingenious ''mechanism'' for linking sounds with meanings, language automatically evolved and changed.

===Problems of reliability and deception===
From the perspective of modern science, the main obstacle to the evolution of language-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is the fact that symbols <U+2014> arbitrary associations of sounds or other perceptible forms with corresponding meanings <U+2014> are unreliable and may well be false.<ref name="Zahavi, A 1993">{{cite journal | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | year = 1993 | title = The fallacy of conventional signalling | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 340 | issue = | pages = 227<U+2013>230 }}</ref> As the saying goes, 'words are cheap.'<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = J. | year = 1994 | title = Must reliable signals always be costly? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1115<U+2013>1120 }}</ref> The problem of reliability was not recognised at all by Darwin, M<U+00FC>ller or the other early evolutionist theorists.

Animal vocal signals are for the most part intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state. We can 'trust' the signal not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just can't fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable, but they remain reliable for the same reason <U+2014> because they are hard to fake.<ref>Goodall, J. 1986. ''The Chimpanzees of Gombe. Patterns of behavior.'' Cambridge, MA and London: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.</ref> Primate social intelligence is ''Machiavellian''<U+2014>self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples. Monkeys and apes often attempt to deceive one another, while at the same time remaining constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves.<ref>Byrne, R. and A. Whiten (eds) 1988. ''Machiavellian Intelligence. Social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.</ref> Paradoxically, it is precisely primates' resistance to deception that blocks the evolution of their signalling systems along language-like lines. Language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable. Words automatically fail this test.<ref>Knight, C. 1998b. Ritual/speech coevolution: a solution to the problem of deception. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert-Kennedy and C. Knight (eds), ''Approaches to the Evolution of Language: Social and cognitive bases.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 68-91.</ref>

Words are easy to fake. Should they turn out to be lies, listeners will adapt by ignoring them in favour of hard-to-fake indices or cues. For language to work, then, listeners must be confident that those with whom they are on speaking terms are generally likely to be honest.<ref>Power, C. 1998. Old wives<U+2019> tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C. Knight (eds), ''Approaches to the Evolution of Language: Social and Cognitive Bases.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 111 29.</ref> A peculiar feature of language is [[displacement (linguistics) | 'displaced reference']], which means reference to topics outside the currently perceptible situation. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate 'here' and 'now'. For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. A theory of the origins of language must therefore explain why humans could begin trusting cheap signals in ways that other animals apparently cannot (see [[signalling theory]]).

====The 'mother tongues' hypothesis====
The 'mother tongues' hypothesis was proposed in 2004 as a possible solution to this problem.<ref>Fitch, W. T. 2004. Kin Selection and ``Mother Tongues'': A Neglected Component in Language Evolution. In D. Kimbrough Oller and Ulrike Griebel (eds), ''Evolution of Communication Systems: A Comparative Approach'', pp. 275-296. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</ref> [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]] suggested that the Darwinian principle of 'kin selection'<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. D. | year = 1964 | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I, II | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1<U+2013>52 }}</ref> <U+2014> the convergence of genetic interests between relatives <U+2014> might be part of the answer. Fitch suggests that languages were originally 'mother tongues'. If language evolved initially for communication between mothers and their own biological offspring, extending later to include adult relatives as well, the interests of speakers and listeners would have tended to coincide. Fitch argues that shared genetic interests would have led to sufficient trust and cooperation for intrinsically unreliable signals <U+2014> words <U+2014> to become accepted as trustworthy and so begin evolving for the first time.

Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans. Ape mothers also share genes with their offspring, as do all animals, so why is it only humans who speak? Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that early humans restricted linguistic communication to genetic kin: the incest taboo must have forced men and women to interact and communicate with non-kin. So even if we accept Fitch's initial premises, the extension of the posited 'mother tongue' networks from relatives to non-relatives remains unexplained.<ref>Tallerman, M. In press. Kin selection, pedagogy and linguistic complexity: whence protolanguage. In R. Botha and M. Everaert (eds), ''The Evolutionary Emergence of Human Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>

====The 'obligatory reciprocal altruism' hypothesis====
Ib Ulb<U+00E6>k<ref>Ulb<U+00E6>k, I. 1998. The origin of language and cognition. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert-Kennedy and C. D. Knight (eds), ''Approaches to the evolution of language: social and cognitive bases.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 30-43.</ref> invokes another standard Darwinian principle <U+2014> 'reciprocal altruism'<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R. L. | year = 1971 | title = The evolution of reciprocal altruism | url = | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 35<U+2013>57 }}</ref> <U+2014> to explain the unusually high levels of intentional honesty necessary for language to evolve. 'Reciprocal altruism' can be expressed as the principle that ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.'' In linguistic terms, it would mean that ''if you speak truthfully to me, I'll speak truthfully to you.'' Ordinary Darwinian reciprocal altruism, Ulb<U+00E6>k points out, is a relationship established between frequently interacting individuals. For language to prevail across an entire community, however, the necessary reciprocity would have needed to be enforced universally instead of being left to individual choice. Ulb<U+00E6>k concludes that for language to evolve, early society as a whole must have been subject to moral regulation. 

Critics point out that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom 'obligatory reciprocal altruism' could possibly have been enforced. Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect.<ref>Knight, C. 2006. Language co-evolved with the rule of law. In A. Cangelosi, A. D. M. Smith and K. Smith (eds), ''The evolution of language. Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference (EVOLANG6).''  New Jersey & London: World Scientific Publishing, pp. 168-75.</ref> A further criticism is that language doesn't work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups don't withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to advertise to the world their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting it to anyone who will listen without thought of return.<ref>Dessalles, J.-L. 1998. Altruism, status and the origin of relevance. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert-Kennedy and C. Knight (eds), ''Approaches to the Evolution of Language. Social and cognitive bases.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 130-147.</ref>

====The gossip and grooming hypothesis====
Gossip, according to [[Robin Dunbar]], does for group-living humans what manual grooming does for other primates <U+2014> it allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances on the basis of the principle, ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.'' As humans began living in larger and larger social groups, the task of manually grooming all one's friends and acquaintances became so time-consuming as to be unaffordable. In response to this problem, humans invented 'a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming' <U+2014> ''vocal grooming.'' To keep your allies happy, you now needed only to 'groom' them with low-cost vocal sounds, servicing multiple allies simultaneously while keeping both hands free for other tasks. Vocal grooming then evolved gradually into vocal language <U+2014> initially in the form of 'gossip'.<ref>Dunbar, R. I. M. 1996. ''Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language.'' London: Faber and Faber.</ref> 

Critics of this theory point out that the very efficiency of 'vocal grooming' <U+2014> the fact that words are so cheap <U+2014> would have undermined its capacity to signal commitment of the kind conveyed by time-consuming and costly manual grooming.<ref>Power, C. 1998. Old wives<U+2019> tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C. Knight (eds), ''Approaches to the Evolution of Language: Social and Cognitive Bases.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 111-29.</ref> A further criticism is that the theory does nothing to explain the crucial transition from vocal grooming <U+2014> the production of pleasing but meaningless sounds <U+2014> to the cognitive complexities of syntactical speech.

====Ritual/speech coevolution====
The ritual/speech coevolution theory was originally proposed by the distinguished social anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]]<ref>Rappaport, R. A. 1999. ''Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> before being elaborated by anthropologists such as Chris Knight,<ref>Knight, C. 1998. Ritual/speech coevolution: a solution to the problem of deception.

These scholars argue that there can be no such thing as a 'theory of the origins of language'. This is because language is not a separate adaptation but an internal aspect of something much wider <U+2014> namely, human [[symbolic culture]] as a whole.<ref>Knight, C. 2010.

Can we imagine a historian attempting to explain the emergence of credit cards independently of the wider system of which they are a part? Using a credit card makes sense only if you have a bank account institutionally recognised within a certain kind of advanced capitalist society<U+2014>one where electronic communications technology and digital computers have already been invented and fraud can be detected and prevented. In much the same way, language would not work outside a specific array of social mechanisms and institutions. For example, it would not work for an ape communicating with other apes in the wild. Not even the cleverest ape could make language work under such conditions.

====Tower of Babel hypothesis====
It has been suggested that language might have evolved partly to block communication, to set one's own tribe aside from contamination from the others.<ref>[[Mark Pagel]], ''War of Words'', [[New Scientist]], number 2894, page 38, 08-Dec-2012.</ref> This is connected with the [[Code-talker paradox]], the [[Tower of Babel]] story, and is not inconsistent with the mother-tongue, grooming within the tribe, and incest avoidance hypotheses described above.

===Gestural theory===
The gestural theory states that human language developed from [[gesture]]s that were used for simple communication.

Two types of evidence support this theory.
# Gestural language and vocal language depend on similar neural systems. The regions on the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] that are responsible for mouth and hand movements border each other.
# Nonhuman [[primates]] can use gestures or symbols for at least primitive communication, and some of their gestures resemble those of humans, such as the "begging posture", with the hands stretched out, which humans share with chimpanzees.<ref>Premack, David & Premack, Ann James. ''The Mind of an Ape'', ISBN 0-393-01581-5.</ref>

Research has found strong support for the idea that [[oral communication|verbal language]] and sign language depend on similar neural structures. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-[[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] [[lesion]], showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Neuromotor Mechanisms in Human Communication |author=Kimura, Doreen |year=1993 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-505492-7}}</ref> Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=A Critical Period for Right Hemisphere Recruitment in American Sign Language Processing |author=Newman, A. J., et al. |year=2002 |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=5 |pages=76<U+2013>80 |doi=10.1038/nn775 |pmid=11753419 |issue=1}}</ref>

The important question for gestural theories is why there was a shift to vocalization. Various explanations have been proposed: 
# Our ancestors started to use more and more tools, meaning that their hands were occupied and could no longer be used for gesturing.<ref>Corballis, M. C. 2002. Did language evolve from manual gestures? In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 161-179.</ref>
# Manual gesturing requires that speakers and listeners be visible to one another. In many situations, they might need to communicate, even without visual contact<U+2014>for example after nightfall or when foliage obstructs visibility.
# A composite hypothesis holds that early language took the form of part gestural and part vocal [[mimesis]] (imitative 'song-and-dance'), combining modalities because all signals (like those of apes and monkeys) still needed to be costly in order to be intrinsically convincing. In that event, each multi-media display would have needed not just to disambiguate an intended meaning but also to inspire confidence in the signal's reliability. The suggestion is that only once community-wide contractual understandings had come into force<ref>Knight, C. 2008. [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/knight-springer-online-fulltext.pdf Language co-evolved with the rule of law.] ''Mind and Society'' 7(1)  109-128.</ref> could trust in communicative intentions be automatically assumed, at last allowing ''Homo sapiens'' to shift to a more efficient default format. Since vocal distinctive features (sound contrasts) are ideal for this purpose, it was only at this point <U+2014> when intrinsically persuasive body-language was no longer required to convey each message <U+2014> that the decisive shift from manual gesture to our current primary reliance on ''spoken'' language occurred.<ref>Knight, C. 1998.

Humans still use hand and facial gestures when they speak, especially when people meet who have no language in common.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology |author=Kolb, Bryan, and Ian Q. Whishaw |year=2003 |edition=5th |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-5300-1}}</ref> There are also, of course, a great number of [[sign languages]] still in existence, commonly associated with [[Deaf]] communities; it is important to note that these sign languages are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language<U+2014>the cognitive functions are similar and the parts of the brain used are similar. The main difference is that the "phonemes" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing.

Critics of gestural theory note that it is difficult to name serious reasons why the initial pitch-based [[vocal communication]] (which is present in primates) would be abandoned in favour of the much less effective non-vocal, gestural communication. However, Michael Corballis has pointed out that primate vocal communication (such as alarm calls) cannot be controlled consciously, unlike hand movement, and thus is not credible as precursor to human language; primate vocalisation is rather homologous to and continued in involuntary reflexes (connected with basic human emotions) such as screams or laughter (the fact that these can be faked does not disprove the fact that genuine involuntary responses to fear or surprise exist). Also, gesture is not generally less effective, and depending on the situation can even be advantageous, for example in a loud environment or where it is important to be silent, such as on a hunt. Other challenges to the "gesture-first" theory have been presented by researchers in [[psycholinguistics]], including [[David McNeill]].

===Mirror neurons and language origins===

In humans, functional MRI studies have reported finding areas homologous to the monkey mirror neuron system in the inferior frontal cortex, close to Broca's area, one of the hypothesized language regions of the brain. This has led to suggestions that human language evolved from a gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons. Mirror neurons have been said to have the potential to provide a mechanism for action-understanding, imitation-learning, and the simulation of other people's behaviour.<ref>[[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles, John R.]], ''Gesture, Language Origins, and Right Handedness'', Psycholoqy: 11,#24, 2000</ref> This hypothesis is supported by some [[Cytoarchitectonics|cytoarchitectonic]] homologies between monkey premotor area F5 and human Broca's area.<ref>Petrides, Michael, Cadoret, Genevieve, Mackey, Scott (2005). Orofacial somatomotor responses in the macaque monkey homologue of Broca's area, Nature: 435,#1235</ref> Rates of [[vocabulary]] expansion link to the ability of [[children]] to vocally mirror non-words and so to acquire the new word pronunciations. Such [[speech repetition]] occurs automatically, fast<ref name="Porter">{{Cite PMID|7421161}}</ref> and separately in the brain to [[speech perception]].<ref name="McCarthy">{{Cite PMID|6722512}}</ref><ref name="McCarthy2">{{Cite PMID|11239078}}</ref> Moreover such vocal imitation can occur without comprehension such as in [[speech shadowing]]<ref>{{Cite PMID|4621131}}</ref> and [[echolalia]].<ref>
{{Cite PMID|907878}}</ref>

Further evidence for this link comes from a recent study in which the brain activity of two participants was measured using fMRI while they were gesturing words to each other using hand gestures with a game of [[charades]] <U+2013> a modality that some have suggested might represent the evolutionary precursor of human language. Analysis of the data using [[Granger Causality]] revealed that the mirror-neuron system of the observer indeed reflects the pattern of activity of the activity in the motor system of the sender, supporting the idea that the motor concept associated with the words is indeed transmitted from one brain to another using the mirror system <ref name=Schippers>{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1001791107|last=Schippers |first=MB |last2=Roebroeck |first2=A |last3=Renken |first3=R |last4=Nanetti |first4=L |last5=Keysers |first5=C |title=Mapping the Information flow from one brain to another during gestural communication |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. |year=2010 |volume=107 |issue=20 |pages=9388<U+2013>93 |url=http://www.bcn-nic.nl/txt/people/publications/2010_SchippersKeysers_PNAS.pdf|pmid= 20439736|pmc=2889063}}</ref>

It must be noticed that the mirror neuron system seems to be inherently inadequate to play any role in [[syntax]], given that this definitory property of human languages which is implemented in hierarchical recursive structure is flattened into linear sequences of phonemes making the recursive structure not accessible to sensory detection<ref>{{cite book | url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=11488 | title=The Boundaries of Babel.

===Putting the baby down theory===
According to [[Dean Falk|Dean Falk's]] 'putting the baby down' theory, vocal interactions between early hominin mothers and infants sparked a sequence of events that led, eventually, to our ancestors' earliest words.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Falk | first1 = D. | year = 2004 | title = Prelinguistic evolution in early Hominins: Whence motherese? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 491<U+2013>503 }}</ref> The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their monkey and ape counterparts, couldn't move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed to be reassured that they were not being abandoned. Mothers responded by developing 'motherese' <U+2013> an infant-directed communicative system embracing facial expressions, body language, touching, patting, caressing, laughter, tickling and emotionally expressive contact calls. The argument is that language somehow developed out of all this.

Critics note that while this theory may explain a certain kind of infant-directed 'protolanguage' <U+2013> known today as 'motherese' <U+2013> it does little to solve the really difficult problem, which is the emergence among adults of syntactical speech.

However, in [[The Mental and Social Life of Babies]], psychologist [[Kenneth Kaye]] noted that no usable adult language could have evolved without interactive communication between very young children and adults. "No symbolic system could have survived from one generation to the next if it could not have been easily acquired by young children under their normal conditions of social life."<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaye|first=K.|title=The Mental and Social Life of Babies|year=1982|publisher=Univ. Chicago Press|isbn=0226428486|pages=186}}</ref>

===Grammaticalisation theory===
'[[Grammaticalization|Grammaticalisation]]' is a continuous historical process in which free-standing words develop into grammatical appendages, while these in turn become ever more specialised and grammatical. An initially 'incorrect' usage, in becoming accepted, leads to unforeseen consequences, triggering knock-on effects and extended sequences of change. Paradoxically, grammar evolves because, in the final analysis, humans care less about grammatical niceties than about making themselves understood.<ref>Sperber, D. and D. Wilson 1986. ''Relevance. Communication and cognition.'' Oxford: Blackwell.</ref> If this is how grammar evolves today, according to this school of thought, we can legitimately infer similar principles at work among our distant ancestors, when grammar itself was first being established.<ref>Deutscher, G. 2005. ''The Unfolding of Language. The evolution of mankind<U+2019>s greatest invention.'' London: Random House.</ref><ref>Hopper, P. J. 1998. Emergent grammar. In M. Tomasello (ed.), ''The New Psychology of Language.'' Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 155-175.</ref><ref>B. Heine and T. Kuteva, 2007. ''The Genesis of Grammar. A Reconstruction.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> 

In order to reconstruct the evolutionary transition from early language to languages with complex grammars, we need to know which hypothetical sequences are plausible and which are not. In order to convey abstract ideas, the first recourse of speakers is to fall back on immediately recognisable concrete imagery, very often deploying metaphors rooted in shared bodily experience.<ref name="Lakoff, G 1980">Lakoff, G. and M. Johnson 1980. ''Metaphors We Live By.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref> A familiar example is the use of concrete terms such as 'belly ' or 'back' to convey abstract meanings such as 'inside' or 'behind'. Equally metaphorical is the strategy of representing temporal patterns on the model of spatial ones. Hence in English we say 'It is going to rain', modelled on 'I am going to London'. We might abbreviate this colloquially to 'It's gonna rain'. Even when in a hurry, we don't say 'I'm gonna London' <U+2013> the contraction is restricted to the job of specifying tense. From such examples we can see why grammaticalisation is consistently unidirectional <U+2013> from concrete to abstract meaning, not the other way around. 

Grammaticalisation theorists picture early language as simple, perhaps consisting only of nouns.<ref>Heine, B. and Kuteva, T. 2007. ''The Genesis of Grammar: A Reconstruction.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 111.</ref> Even under that extreme theoretical assumption, however, it is difficult to imagine what cognitive inhibition would realistically have prevented people from using <U+2013> say <U+2013> 'spear' as if it were a verb, as we do in English ('Let's spear this pig!'). Irrespective of the niceties of grammar as professional linguists understand it, people in real life would surely have used their nouns as verbs or their verbs as nouns as occasion demanded. In short, while a noun-only language might seem theoretically possible, grammaticalisation theory indicates that it cannot have remained fixed in that state for any length of time. 

Creativity drives grammatical change.<ref>B. Heine and T. Kuteva, 2012. ''Grammaticalization theory as a tool for reconstructing language evolution.'' In M. Tallerman and K. R. Gibson (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp.512-527.</ref> This presupposes a certain attitude on the part of listeners. Instead of punishing deviations from accepted usage, listeners must prioritise imaginative mind-reading. We shouldn't take for granted that cognitive stance. Imaginative creativity <U+2013> emitting a leopard alarm when no leopard was present, for example <U+2013> is not the kind of behaviour which vervet monkeys would appreciate or reward.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheney | first1 = D. L. | last2 = Seyfarth | first2 = R. M.  | year = 2005 | title = Constraints and preadaptations in the earliest stages of language evolution | url = | journal = Linguistic Review | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 135<U+2013>59 }}</ref> Creativity and reliability are incompatible demands; for 'Machiavellian' primates as for animals generally, the overriding pressure is to demonstrate reliability.<ref>Maynard Smith, J. and D. Harper 2003. ''Animal Signals.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> If humans escape these constraints, it is because in our case, listeners are primarily interested in mental states.

To focus on mental states is to accept fictions <U+2013> inhabitants of the imagination <U+2013> as potentially informative and interesting. Take the use of metaphor. A metaphor is, literally, a false statement.<ref>Davidson, R. D. 1979. What metaphors mean. In S. Sacks (ed.), ''On Metaphor.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 29-45.</ref> Think of Romeo's declaration, 'Juliet is the sun!'. Juliet is a woman, not a ball of hot gases in the sky. But human listeners are not (or not usually) pedants insistent on point-by-point factual accuracy. They want to know what the speaker has in mind. Grammaticalisation is essentially based on metaphor. To outlaw its use would be to stop grammar from evolving and, by the same token, to exclude all possibility of expressing abstract thought.<ref name="Lakoff, G 1980"/><ref>Lakoff, G. and R. N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez  2000. ''Where mathematics comes from.'' New York: Basic Books.</ref> 

A criticism of all this is that while grammaticalisation theory might explain language change today, it doesn't satisfactorily address the really difficult challenge <U+2013> explaining the initial transition from primate-style communication to language as we know it. Rather, the theory assumes that language already exists. As Bernd Heine and Tania Kuteva acknowledge: 'Grammaticalization requires a linguistic system that is used regularly and frequently within a community of speakers and is passed on from one group of speakers to another'.<ref>B. Heine and T. Kuteva 2007. ''The Genesis of Grammar. A Reconstruction.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 164.</ref> Outside modern humans, such conditions don't prevail.

===Self-domesticated ape theory===
According to a study investigating the song differences between [[white-rumped Munia]]s and its domesticated counterpart ([[society finch|Bengalese finch]]), the wild munias use a highly stereotyped song sequence, whereas the domesticated ones sing a highly unconstrained song. In wild finches, song syntax is subject to female preference - sexual selection - and remains relatively fixed. However, in the Bengalese finch, natural selection is replaced by breeding, in this case for colorful plumage. Thus decoupled from selective pressures, stereotyped song syntax is allowed to drift. It is replaced, within 1000 generations, by a variable and learned sequence. Wild finches, moreover, are incapable of learning song sequences from other finches.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Soma, M., Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, M., & Okanoya, K.|year=2009|title=Early ontogenetic effects on song quality in the Bengalese finch (''Lonchura striata var. domestica''): laying order, sibling competition and song sintax. |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume= 63|pages=363<U+2013>370|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1085n85073j6174/fulltext.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0670-9|issue=3}}</ref> In the field of [[bird vocalization]], brains capable of producing only an innate song have very simple neural pathways: the primary forebrain motor center, called the robust nucleus of [[arcopallium]] (RA), connects to midbrain vocal outputs, which in turn project to brainstem motor nuclei. By contrast, in brains capable of learning songs, the RA receives input from numerous additional forebrain regions, including those involved in learning and social experience. Control over song generation has become less constrained, more distributed, and more flexible.

When compared with other primates, whose communication system is restricted to a highly stereotypic repertoire of hoots and calls, humans have very few prespecified vocalizations, extant examples being [[laughter]] and [[crying|sobbing]]. Moreover, these remaining innate vocalizations are generated by restricted neuronal pathways, whereas language is generated by a highly distributed system involving numerous regions of the human brain.

A salient feature of language is that while language competency is inherited, the languages themselves are transmitted via culture. Also transmitted via culture are understandings, such as technological ways of doing things, that are framed as language-based explanations. Hence one would expect a robust co-evolutionary trajectory between language competency and culture: proto-humans capable of the first, and presumably rudimentary, versions of protolanguage would have better access to cultural understandings, and cultural understandings, conveyed in protolanguages that children's brains could readily learn, were more likely to be transmitted, thereby conferring the benefits accrued.

Hence proto-humans indubitably engaged in, and continue to engage in, what is called [[niche construction]], creating cultural niches that provide understandings key to survival, and undergoing evolutionary changes that optimize their ability to flourish in such niches. Selection pressures that operated to sustain instincts important for survival in prior niches would be expected to relax as humans became increasingly dependent on their self-created cultural niches, while any innovations that facilitated cultural adaptation<U+2014>in this case, innovations in language competency<U+2014>would be expected to spread.

One useful way to think about human evolution is that we are self-domesticated apes. Just as domestication relaxed selection for stereotypic songs in the finches<U+2014>mate choice was supplanted by choices made by the aesthetic sensibilities of bird breeders and their customers<U+2014>so might our cultural domestication have relaxed selection on many of our primate behavioral traits, allowing old pathways to degenerate and reconfigure. Given the highly indeterminate way that mammalian brains develop<U+2014>they basically construct themselves "bottom up," with one set of neuronal interactions setting the stage for the next round of interactions<U+2014>degraded pathways would tend to seek out and find new opportunities for synaptic hookups. Such inherited de-differentiations of brain pathways might have contributed to the functional complexity that characterizes human language. And, as exemplified by the finches, such de-differentiations can occur in very rapid timeframes.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Graham Ritchie and Simon Kirby|year=2005|title=Selection, domestication, and the emergence of learned communication systems|journal=Second International Symposium on the Emergence and Evolution of Linguistic Communication|volume= |pages=|url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0237680/pubs/ritchie_05_selection.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author= Ursula Goodenough|newspaper= http://www.npr.org|date= February 5, 2010|url= http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2010/02/did_we_start_out_as_selfdomest.html}}.</ref>

==Communication, speech and language==
{{See also|Animal communication|Animal language}}
A distinction can be drawn between [[speech]] and [[language]]. Language is not necessarily spoken: it might alternatively be written or signed. Speech is one among a number of different methods of encoding and transmitting linguistic information, albeit arguably the most natural one.

Some scholars view language as initially a cognitive development, its 'externalisaton' to serve communicative purposes occurring later in human evolution. According to one such school of thought, the key feature distinguishing human language is [[recursion]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hauser|2002}}.</ref> <U+2013> in this context, the iterative embedding of phrases within phrases. Other scholars <U+2013> notably [[Daniel Everett]] <U+2013> deny that recursion is universal, citing certain languages (e.g. [[Pirah<U+00E3> language|Pirah<U+00E3>]]) which allegedly lack this feature.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=46|date=August<U+2013>October 2005|title=Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirah<U+00E3>: Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language|first=Daniel L. |last=Everett|page=634|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/psycho/pdf/Publications_2005_PDF/Commentary_on_D.Everett_05.pdf|issue=4|doi<U+2013> the First Question?]] The Origins of Human Choral Singing, Intelligence, Language and Speech | author = Joseph Jordania | isbn = 99940-31-81-3 |year = 2006 | publisher = Logos | location = Tbilisi}}</ref>

The ability to ask questions is considered by some to distinguish language from nonhuman systems of communication. Some captive primates (notably [[bonobos]] and [[chimpanzees]]), having learned to use rudimentary signing to communicate with their human trainers, proved able to respond correctly to complex questions and requests. Yet they failed to ask even the simplest questions themselves. Conversely, human children are able to ask their first questions (using only question [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]) at the babbling period of their development, long before they start using syntactic structures. Although babies from different cultures acquire native languages from their social environment, all languages of the world without exception <U+2013> tonal, non-tonal, intonational and accented <U+2013> use similar rising "question intonation" for [[yes-no questions]].<ref>Bolinger, Dwight L. (Editor) 1972. ''Intonation''. Selected Readings. Harmondsworth: Penguin, pg.314</ref><ref>Cruttenden, Alan. 1986. ''Intonation''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Pg.169-174</ref> This fact is a strong proof of the universality of [[question intonation]].

==Cognitive development and language==
One of the intriguing abilities that language users have is that of high-level [[reference]], or the ability to refer to things or states of being that are not in the immediate realm of the speaker. This ability is often related to theory of mind, or an awareness of the other as a being like the self with individual wants and intentions. According to Chomsky, Hauser and Fitch (2002), there are six main aspects of this high-level reference system:

* [[Theory of mind]]
* Capacity to acquire nonlinguistic conceptual representations, such as the object/kind distinction
* Referential vocal signals
* Imitation as a rational, intentional system
* Voluntary control over signal production as evidence of intentional communication
* [[Numerical cognition|Number representation]]

===Theory of mind===
[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] (1999) argues that theory of mind must have preceded language use, based on evidence of use of the following characteristics as much as 40,000 years ago: intentional communication, repairing failed communication, teaching, intentional persuasion, intentional deception, building shared plans and goals, intentional sharing of focus or topic, and pretending. Moreover, Baron-Cohen argues that many primates show some, but not all, of these abilities. Call and Tomasello<U+2019>s research on [[chimpanzees]] supports this, in that individual chimps seem to understand that other chimps have awareness, knowledge, and intention, but do not seem to understand false beliefs. Many primates show some tendencies toward a theory of mind, but not a full one as humans have.
Ultimately, there is some consensus within the field that a theory of mind is necessary for language use. Thus, the development of a full theory of mind in humans was a necessary precursor to full language use.

===Number representation===
In one particular study, rats and pigeons were required to press a button a certain number of times to get food: The animals showed very accurate distinction for numbers less than four, but as the numbers increased, the error rate increased (Chomsky, Hauser & Fitch, 2002). Matsuzawa (1985) attempted to teach chimpanzees Arabic numerals. The difference between primates and humans in this regard was very large, as it took the chimps thousands of trials to learn 1-9 with each number requiring a similar amount of training time; yet, after learning the meaning of 1, 2 and 3 (and sometimes 4), children easily comprehend the value of greater integers by using a successor function (i.e. 2 is 1 greater than 1, 3 is 1 greater than 2, 4 is 1 greater than 3; once 4 is reached it seems most children have an [[A-Ha! moment|"a-ha!" moment]] and understand that the value any integer ''n'' is 1 greater than the previous integer). Put simply, other primates learn the meaning of numbers one by one similar to their approach to other referential symbols while children first learn an arbitrary list of symbols (1,2,3,4...) and then later learn their precise meanings.<ref>S. Carey, ''Mind Lang.'' 16, 37 (2001)</ref> These results can be seen as evidence for the application of the "open-ended generative property" of language in human numeral cognition.<ref>Hauser, Chomsky, Fitch, ''Science'', Vol. 298, No. 5598 (Nov. 22, 2002), p. 1577</ref>

==Linguistic structures==

===Lexical-phonological principle===
Hockett (1966) details a list of features regarded as essential to describing human language. In the domain of the lexical-phonological principle, two features of this list are most important:

* Productivity: users can create and understand completely novel messages.
** New messages are freely coined by blending, analogizing from, or transforming old ones.
** Either new or old elements are freely assigned new semantic loads by circumstances and context. This says that in every language, new idioms constantly come into existence.
*Duality (of Patterning): a large number of meaningful elements are made up of a conveniently small number of independently meaningless yet message-differentiating elements.

The sound system of a language is composed of a finite set of simple phonological items. Under the specific [[phonotactic]] rules of a given language, these items can be recombined and concatenated, giving rise to [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and the open-ended lexicon. A key feature of language is that a simple, finite set of phonological items gives rise to an infinite lexical system wherein rules determine the form of each item, and meaning is inextricably linked with form. Phonological syntax, then, is a simple combination of pre-existing phonological units. Related to this is another essential feature of human language: lexical syntax, wherein pre-existing units are combined, giving rise to semantically novel or distinct lexical items.

Certain elements of the lexical-phonological principle are known to exist outside of humans. While all (or nearly all) have been documented in some form in the natural world, very few co-exist within the same species. Birdsong, singing apes, and the songs of whales all display phonological syntax, combining units of sound into larger structures devoid of enhanced or novel meaning. Certain species of primate do have simple phonological systems with units referring to entities in the world. However, in contrast to human systems, the units in these primates' systems normally occur in isolation, betraying a lack of lexical syntax. There is new evidence to suggest that Campbell's monkeys also display lexical syntax, combining two calls (a predator alarm call with a "boom", the combination of which denotes a lessened threat of danger), however it is still unclear whether this is a lexical or a morphological phenomenon.

===Pidgins and creoles===
{{Main|Creole language|pidgin}}
Pidgins are significantly simplified languages with only rudimentary grammar and a restricted vocabulary. In their early stage pidgins mainly consist of nouns, verbs, and adjectives with few or no articles, prepositions, conjunctions or auxiliary verbs. Often the grammar has no fixed [[word order]] and the words have no [[inflection]].<ref name="thirdchimpanzee"/>

If contact is maintained between the groups speaking the pidgin for long periods of time, the pidgins may become more complex over many generations. If the children of one generation adopt the pidgin as their native language it develops into a [[creole language]], which becomes fixed and acquires a more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding. The syntax and morphology of such languages may often have local innovations not obviously derived from any of the parent languages.

Studies of creole languages around the world have suggested that they display remarkable similarities in grammar and are developed uniformly from pidgins in a single generation. These similarities are apparent even when creoles do not share any common language origins. In addition, creoles share similarities despite being developed in isolation from each other. [[Language bioprogram theory|Syntactic similarities]] include [[subject<U+2013>verb<U+2013>object]] word order. Even when creoles are derived from languages with a different word order they often develop the SVO word order. Creoles tend to have similar usage patterns for definite and indefinite articles, and similar movement rules for phrase structures even when the parent languages do not.<ref name="thirdchimpanzee"/>

==Evolutionary timeline==

===Primate language===
Field primatologists can give us useful insights into [[great ape]] communication in the wild.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Arcadi | first1 = A. C. | year = 2000 | title = Vocal responsiveness in male wild chimpanzees: implications for the evolution of language | url = | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 205<U+2013>223 }}</ref>     The main finding is that non-human primates, including the great apes, produce calls that are graded, as opposed to categorically differentiated, with listeners striving to evaluate subtle gradations in signallers' emotional and bodily states. Apes find it extremely difficult to produce vocalisations in the absence of the corresponding emotional states.<ref>Goodall, J. 1986. The Chimpanzees of Gombe. Patterns of behavior. Cambridge, MA and London: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, p. 125.</ref> In captivity, apes have been taught rudimentary forms of sign language or have been persuaded to use [[lexigrams]]<U+2014>symbols that do not graphically resemble the corresponding words<U+2014>on computer keyboards. Some apes, such as [[Kanzi]], have been able to learn and use hundreds of lexigrams.<ref>S. Savage-Rumbaugh and R. Lewin (1994), ''Kanzi. The ape at the brink of the human mind.'' New York: Wily.</ref><ref>Savage-Rumbaugh S, Shanker G, Taylor T J (1998) ''Apes, Language and the Human Mind.'' Oxford University Press, Oxford.</ref>

The [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s in the primate brain are responsible for controlling the muscles of the face, tongue, mouth, and larynx, as well as recognizing sounds. Primates are known to make "vocal calls," and these calls are generated by circuits in the [[brainstem]] and [[limbic system]].<ref name=Freeman>Freeman, Scott; Jon C. Herron., ''Evolutionary Analysis'' (4th ed.), Pearson Education, Inc. (2007), ISBN 0-13-227584-8 pages 789-90</ref> However, modern brain scans of chattering chimpanzees prove that they use Brocas area to chatter <ref>Evolve (tv show): Communication</ref> and there is evidence that monkeys hearing monkey chatter use the same brain regions as humans hearing speech.<ref>RedOrbit: Primate and Human Language Use Same Brain Regions</ref>

In the wild, the communication of [[vervet monkey]]s has been the most extensively studied.<ref name="thirdchimpanzee">{{Cite book|last=Diamond |first=Jared |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal |location=New York |publisher=Harper Perennial |year=1992, 2006 |isbn=0-06-018307-1 |pages=141<U+2013>167}}</ref> They are known to make up to ten different vocalizations. Many of these are used to warn other members of the group about approaching predators. They include a "leopard call", a "snake call", and an "eagle call". Each call triggers a different defensive strategy in the monkeys that hear the call and scientists were able to elicit predictable responses from the monkeys using loudspeakers and prerecorded sounds. Other vocalizations may be used for identification. If an infant monkey calls, its mother turns toward it, but other vervet mothers turn instead toward that infant's mother to see what she will do.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/science/23lang.html |title=Nigerian Monkeys Drop Hints on Language Origin |author=Wade, Nicholas |date=2006-05-23 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>

Similarly, researchers have demonstrated that chimpanzees (in captivity) use different "words" in reference to different foods. They recorded vocalizations that chimps made in reference, for example, to grapes, and then other chimps pointed at pictures of grapes when they heard the recorded sound. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Early ''Homo''===
Regarding articulation, there is considerable speculation about the language capabilities of early ''[[Homo]]'' (2.5 to 0.8 million years ago). Anatomically, some scholars believe features of [[bipedalism]], which developed in [[australopithecine]]s around 3.5 million years ago, would have brought changes to the skull, allowing for a more L-shaped vocal tract. The shape of the tract and a larynx positioned relatively low in the neck are necessary prerequisites for many of the sounds humans make, particularly vowels.
Other scholars believe that, based on the position of the larynx, not even [[Neanderthals]] had the anatomy necessary to produce the full range of sounds modern humans make.<ref name="linguisticshandbook">{{Cite book|year=2001|title=The Handbook of Linguistics|editor-first=Mark |editor-last=Aronoff|editor2-first=Janie |editor2-last=Rees-Miller|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|pages=1<U+2013>18|isbn=1-4051-0252-7}}</ref><ref name="comparativereview">{{Cite web|url=http://www3.isrl.uiuc.edu/~junwang4/langev/localcopy/pdf/fitch00speech.pdf |title=The Evolution of Speech: A Comparative Review |author=Fitch, W.

The term ''proto-language'', as defined by linguist [[Derek Bickerton]], is a primitive form of communication lacking:
* a fully developed [[syntax]]
* tense, aspect, auxiliary verbs, etc.
* a closed-class (i.e. non-lexical) vocabulary
That is, a stage in the evolution of language somewhere between [[great ape language]] and fully developed modern human language. Bickerton (2009) places the first emergence of such a proto-language with the earliest appearance of ''Homo'', and associates its appearance with the pressure of behavioral adaptation to the [[niche construction]] of [[scavenging]] faced by ''Homo habilis''.<ref>Bickerton, ''Adam's Tongue'' (2009).</ref>

Anatomical features such as the L-shaped vocal tract have been continuously evolving, as opposed to appearing suddenly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mapping Human History |last=Olson |first=Steve |isbn=0-618-35210-4 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books |year=2002|quote=Any adaptations produced by evolution are useful only in the present, not in some vaguely defined future.

===Archaic Homo sapiens===
{{Further|Archaic Homo sapiens}}
[[Steven Mithen]] proposed the term ''Hmmmmm'' for the pre-linguistic system of communication used by archaic ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', beginning with ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' and reaching the highest sophistification in the [[Middle Pleistocene]] with ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' and ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]''. ''Hmmmmm'' is an acronym for ''h''olistic (non-compositional), ''m''anipulative (utterances are commands or suggestions, not descriptive statements), ''m''ulti-''m''odal (acoustic as well as gestural and mimetic), [[origin of music|''m''usical]], and ''m''emetic.<ref name="isbn0-674-02192-4">{{Cite book|author=Mithen, Steven J. |authorlink = Steven Mithen |title=The Singing Neanderthals: The Origins of Music, Language, Mind, and Body |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-674-02192-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

====Homo heidelbergensis====
{{See also|Homo_heidelbergensis#Language|l1=Homo heidelbergenis: Language}}
''H. heidelbergensis'' was a close relative (most probably a migratory descendant) of ''[[Homo ergaster]]''. ''H. ergaster'' some researchers believe this species to be the first hominid to make controlled vocalizations, possibly mimicking animal vocalizations,<ref>Mithen, Steven (2006). The Singing Neanderthals, ISBN 978-0-674-02559-8 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (8) does not correspond to calculated figure.}}</ref> and that as ''H. heidelbergensis'' developed more sophisticated culture proceeded from this point and possibly developed an early form of symbolic language.

====Homo neanderthalensis====
{{See also|Neanderthal_behavior#Language|l1=Neanderthal behavior: Language}}
The discovery in 2007 of a Neanderthal [[hyoid bone]] suggests that Neanderthals may have been anatomically capable of producing sounds similar to modern humans. The [[hypoglossal nerve]], which passes through the canal, controls the movements of the tongue and its size is said to reflect speech abilities. Hominids who lived earlier than 300,000 years ago had hypoglossal canals more akin to those of chimpanzees than of humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.baa.duke.edu/kay/site/riogallegos/PDFs/j74.pdf |title=Hypoglossal Canal Size in Living Hominoids and the Evolution of Human Speech |format=PDF |author=Jungers, William L. et al. |year=2003 |month=August |journal=Human Biology |volume=75 |pages=473<U+2013>484 |accessdate=2007-09-10 |doi=10.1353/hub.2003.0057 |issue=4 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070612035730/http://www.baa.duke.edu/kay/site/riogallegos/PDFs/j74.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-12 |pmid=14655872}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Hypoglossal Canal Size and Hominid Speech |author=DeGusta, David et al. |year=1999 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=96 |pages=1800<U+2013>1804| quote=Hypoglossal canal size has previously been used to date the origin of human-like speech capabilities to at least 400,000 years ago and to assign modern human vocal abilities to Neandertals.

However, although Neanderthals may have been anatomically able to speak, [[Richard G. Klein]] in 2004 doubted that they possessed a fully modern language. He largely bases his doubts on the fossil record of archaic humans and their stone tool kit. For 2 million years following the emergence of ''Homo habilis'', the stone tool technology of hominids changed very little. Klein, who has worked extensively on ancient stone tools, describes the crude stone tool kit of archaic humans as impossible to break down into categories based on their function, and reports that Neanderthals seem to have had little concern for the final form of their tools. Klein argues that the Neanderthal brain may have not reached the level of complexity required for modern speech, even if the physical apparatus for speech production was well-developed.<ref name="kleinbio">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/101/16/5705#SEC1 |title=Biography of Richard G.

===Homo sapiens===
{{See also|Anatomically modern humans|Behavioral modernity}}
Anatomically modern humans first [[Omo remains|appear in the fossil record]] 195,000 years ago in Ethiopia. But while they were modern anatomically, the archaeological evidence available leaves little indication that they behaved any differently from the earlier ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''. They retained the same [[Acheulean]] stone tools and hunted less efficiently than did modern humans of the [[Late Pleistocene]].<ref name="uwnews.org">Schwarz, J. http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleID=37362</ref> The transition to the more sophisticated [[Mousterian]] takes place only about 120,000 years ago, and is shared by both ''H. sapiens'' and ''H. neanderthalensis''.

The development of [[behavioral modernity|fully modern behavior]] in ''H. sapiens'', not shared by ''H. neanderthalensis'' or any other variety of ''Homo'', is dated to some 70,000 to 50,000 years ago.

The development of more sophisticated tools, for the first time constructed out of more than one material (e.g. bone or antler) and sortable into different categories of function (such as projectile points, engraving tools, knife blades, and drilling and piercing tools), is often taken as proof for the presence of fully developed language, assumed to be necessary for the teaching of the processes of manufacture to offspring.<ref name="kleinbio" /><ref name="wolpert2">{{Cite book| title=Six impossible things before breakfast, The evolutionary origins of belief|authorlink=Lewis Wolpert|last=Wolpert|first=Lewis|isbn=0-393-06449-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=HP35qPdfioAC&pg=PA81&dq=%22make+complex+tools+in+fact%22|page=81| year=2006| publisher=Norton| location=New York}}</ref>

The greatest step{{Dubious|date=April 2010}} in language evolution would have been the progression from primitive, [[pidgin]]-like communication to a [[Creole language|creole]]-like language with all the grammar and syntax of modern languages.<ref name="thirdchimpanzee" />

Some scholars believe that this step could only have been accomplished with some biological change to the brain, such as a mutation. It has been suggested that a gene such as [[FOXP2]] may have undergone a mutation allowing humans to communicate.{{Dubious|date=April 2010}} However, recent genetic studies have shown that Neanderthals shared the same FOXP2 allele with ''H. sapiens''.<ref name="Krause et al. 2007">{{cite journal|last=Krause|coauthors=et al.|journal=Current Biology|year=2007|volume=17|issue=21|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.008|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2807%2902065-9|pmid=17949978}}</ref> It hence does not have a mutation unique to ''H. sapiens''. Instead, it indicates this genetic change predates the Neanderthal - ''H. sapiens'' split.

There is still considerable debate as to whether language developed gradually over thousands of years or whether it appeared suddenly.

The Broca's and Wernicke's areas of the primate brain also appear in the human brain, the first area being involved in many cognitive and perceptual tasks, the latter lending to language skills. The same circuits discussed in the primates' brain stem and limbic system control non-verbal sounds in humans (laughing, crying, etc.), which suggests that the human language center is a modification of neural circuits common to all primates. This modification and its skill for linguistic communication seem to be unique to humans, which implies that the language organ derived after the human lineage split from the primate (chimps and bonobos) lineage.<ref name=Freeman/>

According to the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa hypothesis]], around 50,000 years ago<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=DA5114C2-E7F2-99DF-30BBDDD4415DED90 |title=Skulls Add to "Out of Africa" Theory of Human Origins: Pattern of skull variation bolsters the case that humans took over from earlier species |author=Minkel, J.

However, given the fact that [[Homo erectus]] managed to leave the continent much earlier (without extensive use of language, sophisticated tools, nor anatomical modernity), the reasons why anatomically modern humans remained in Africa for such a long period remain unclear.

==Biological scenarios for language evolution==
{{Further|Evolutionary linguistics}}
All human populations possess language. This includes populations, such as the [[Tasmanian Aborigines|Tasmanians]] and the [[Andamanese]], who may have been isolated from the Old World continents for as long as 40,000 years. 

Linguistic [[monogenesis (linguistics)|monogenesis]] is the hypothesis that there was a single proto-language, sometimes called [[Proto-Human language|Proto-Human]], from which all other vocal languages spoken by humans descend. (This does not apply to [[sign language]]s, which are known to arise independently rather frequently.) 

The [[multiregional hypothesis]] would entail that modern language evolved independently on all the continents, a proposition considered implausible by proponents of monogenesis.<ref name="wadenyt">{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E0DF173CF936A25754C0A9659C8B63&sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=1 |title=Early Voices: The Leap to Language |author=Wade, Nicholas |date=2003-07-15 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2007-09-10 |authorlink=Nicholas Wade}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arthist.lu.se/kultsem/pro/SverkerJohansson-sem.pdf |format=PDF |title=Origins of Language&nbsp;<U+2014> Constraints on Hypotheses |author=Sverker, Johansson |accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref>

==Biological foundations for human speech==
The [[Larynx#Descended larynx|descended larynx]] was formerly viewed as a structure unique to the human [[vocal tract]] and essential to the development of speech and language. However, it has been found in other [[species]], including some aquatic mammals and large deer (e.g. [[Red Deer]]), and the larynx has been observed to descend during vocalizations in [[dogs]], [[goats]], and [[alligators]]. In humans, the descended larynx extends the length of the vocal tract and expands the variety of sounds humans can produce. Some scholars claim that the ubiquity of nonverbal communication in humans stands as evidence of the non-essentiality of the descended larynx to the development of language.

The descended larynx has non-linguistic functions as well, possibly exaggerating the apparent size of an animal (through vocalizations with lower than expected pitch). Thus, although it plays an important role in speech production, expanding the variety of sounds humans can produce, it may not have evolved specifically for this purpose, as has been suggested by [[Jeffrey Laitman]], and as per Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch (2002), could be an example of [[preadaptation]].

==History==

===In religion and mythology===
{{Main|Mythical origins of language}}
{{See also|Divine language|Adamic language}}
The search for the origin of language has a long history rooted in [[mythology]]. Most mythologies do not credit humans with the invention of language but speak of a [[divine language]] predating human language. Mystical languages used to communicate with animals or spirits, such as the [[language of the birds]], are also common, and were of particular interest during the [[Renaissance]].

===Historical experiments===
{{main|Language deprivation experiments}}
History contains a number of anecdotes about people who attempted to discover the origin of language by experiment. The first such tale was told by [[Herodotus]] (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 2.2). He relates that  Pharaoh Psammetichus (probably [[Psammetichus I]], 7th century BC) had two children raised by a shepherd, with the instructions that no one should speak to them, but that the shepherd should feed and care for them while listening to determine their first words. When one of the children cried "bekos" with outstretched arms the shepherd concluded that the word was Phrygian because that was the sound of the  [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] word for ''bread''. From this Psammetichus concluded that the first language was Phrygian. King [[James V of Scotland]] is said to have tried a similar experiment: his children were supposed to have spoken [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>{{Cite book

{{Main|Evolutionary linguistics}}
Late 18th to early 19th century European scholarship assumed that the languages of the world reflected various stages in the development from primitive to advanced speech, culminating in the [[Indo-European languages]], seen as the most advanced.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} 

Modern linguistics does not begin until the late 18th century, and the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[animism#Philosophy|animist]] theses of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Johann Christoph Adelung]] remained influential well into the 19th century. The question of language origins seemed inaccessible to methodical approaches, and in 1866 the [[Linguistic Society of Paris]] famously banned all discussion of the origin of language, deeming it to be an unanswerable problem. An increasingly systematic approach to [[historical linguistics]] developed in the course of the 19th century, reaching its culmination in the [[Neogrammarian]] school of [[Karl Brugmann]] and others. 

However, scholarly interest in the question of the origin of language has only gradually been rekindled from the 1950s on (and then controversially) with ideas such as [[universal grammar]], [[mass comparison]] and [[glottochronology]]. 

The "origin of language" as a subject in its own right emerged out of studies in [[neurolinguistics]], [[psycholinguistics]] and [[human evolution]]. The ''[[Linguistic Bibliography]]'' introduced "Origin of language" as a separate heading in 1988, as a sub-topic of psycholinguistics. Dedicated research institutes of [[evolutionary linguistics]] are a recent phenomenon, emerging only in the 1990s.

===Genesis of Nicaraguan Sign Language===
{{Main|Nicaraguan Sign Language}}
Beginning in 1979, the recently installed [[Nicaragua]]n government initiated the country's first widespread effort to educate deaf children. Prior to this there was no [[deaf community]] in the country. A center for special education established a program initially attended by 50 young deaf children. By 1983 the center had 400 students. The center did not have access to teaching facilities of any of the sign languages that are used around the world; consequently, the children were not taught any sign language. The language program instead emphasized spoken Spanish and lipreading, and the use of signs by teachers limited to fingerspelling (using simple signs to sign the alphabet). The program achieved little success, with most students failing to grasp the concept of Spanish words.

The first children who arrived at the center came with only a few crude gestural signs developed within their own families. However, when the children were placed together for the first time they began to build on one another's signs. As more and younger children joined, the language became more complex. The children's teachers, who were having limited success at communicating with their students, watched in awe as the children began communicating amongst themselves.

Later the Nicaraguan government solicited help from [[Judy Kegl]], an American sign-language expert at [[Northeastern University]]. As Kegl and other researchers began to analyze the language, they noticed that the younger children had taken the pidgin-like form of the older children to a higher level of complexity, with verb agreement and other conventions of grammar.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/19991024mag-sign-language.html | work=The New York Times | title=A Linguistic Big Bang}}</ref>
