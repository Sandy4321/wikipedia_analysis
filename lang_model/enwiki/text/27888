It was the 12th final of the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] since it was first organised in 1990 to celebrate the centenary of the [[Scottish Football League]].

Both teams progressed through four knock-out rounds to reach the final. The match was Brechin City's first national cup final in its 96-year history whilst it was Queen of the South's second appearance in the final of the tournament having lost in [[1997 Scottish Challenge Cup Final|1997]]. The tournament was contested by clubs below the Scottish Premier League; Queen of the South from the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] and Brechin City from the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]].

Queen of the South dominated most of the game with [[John O'Neill (Scottish footballer)|John O'Neill]] scoring the first goal in the 33rd minute. Two minutes into the second half, [[Derek Lyle]] scored a [[Glossary of association football terms#H|header]] to take a 2<U+2013>0 lead. Brechin City had few chances to score and Queen of the South held on to win the tournament and a national cup competition for the first time.

Brechin scored twelve goals and conceded seven compared with Queen of the South's ten goals scored and only three conceded. Queen of the South kept a [[clean sheet]] in the first three rounds<ref name="Soccerbase_2002/03">[http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=609 Scottish League Challenge Cup 2002/03], ''soccerbase.com'', Retrieved 15 June 2013.</ref> and were favourites to win the match being the higher ranked club as a competitor in the First Division, one tier above Brechin who were in the Second Division. At the time of the final Queen of the South were in bad league form, ranking second-last in the First Division with only two wins and eight points from 10 games.<ref name="Div1_Table_19_Oct">[http://www.statto.com/football/teams/queen-of-the-south/2002-2003/table/2002-10-19 Queen of the South 2002<U+2013>2003 : Scottish Division One Table on 19.10.2002], ''statto.com'', Retrieved 15 June 2013.</ref> Brechin were in slightly better form, ranking 6th in the Second Division with four wins and 13 points from nine games before the cup final.<ref name="Div2_Table_19_Oct">[http://www.statto.com/football/teams/brechin-city/2002-2003/table/2002-10-19 Brechin City 2002<U+2013>2003 : Scottish Division Two Table on 19.10.2002], ''statto.com'', Retrieved 15 June 2013.</ref>
