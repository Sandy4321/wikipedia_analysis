'''Mona Simpson''' is a recurring fictional character in the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. She has been voiced by several actresses, including [[Maggie Roswell]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and most prominently, [[Glenn Close]]. Mona is the estranged wife of [[Abraham Simpson|Abe Simpson]] and the mother of [[Homer Simpson]]. Homer believed that his mother was dead, a lie his father Abe told him when in reality she was on the run from the law. Mona first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|second season]] in a flashback in "[[Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?]]". She returned in the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]] for her first main appearance in "[[Mother Simpson]]" and also had large role in "[[My Mother the Carjacker]]". The character appeared again in [[The Simpsons (season 19)|Season 19]]'s "[[Mona Leaves-a]]", but passed away during the episode.

Mona is named after writer [[Richard Appel]]'s wife but the inspiration for the character came from [[Bernardine Dohrn]] of the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]]. Glenn Close's performances as Mona have been well-received by critics and she was named one of the top 25 guest stars on the show by [[IGN]].

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
[[Image:Homer and Mona.png|left|200px|thumb|Homer and Mona in the '60s]]
Many of the details of Mona's life are unknown, but various pieces of her story have been revealed. Mona was first mentioned in [[The Simpsons (season 1)|season one]] and made two brief flashback appearances, but her first major appearance was in "[[Mother Simpson]]".<ref name="IGN"/> In the episode, it is revealed that in the [[1960s]], Mona was a housewife who lived with her husband [[Abraham Simpson]] and Homer, who at the time was still a small child. She became caught up in the [[hippie|hippie movement]] after her beliefs were ignited by seeing [[Joe Namath]]'s long hair during [[Super Bowl III]].<ref name=MotherSimpson>{{cite episode|title=Mother Simpson|episodelink=Mother Simpson|series=The Simpsons|credits=[[Rich Appel|Appel, Rich]]; [[David Silverman|Silverman, David]]|network=Fox|airdate=1995-11-19|season=07|number=08}}</ref> Mona participated in various acts of political activism. In one of these acts, Mona and a group of other activists protesting germ research entered [[Montgomery Burns]]'s laboratory and destroyed all the [[biological warfare]] experiments. As the gang escaped, she stayed behind to help a fallen Burns, who in turn threatened her. Since that night, Mona was forced to leave her family. Seeking to comfort his son, Abe lied and said Mona had died while Homer was at the movies. He continued the lie by claiming [[Walt Whitman]]'s gravestone was actually Mona's.<ref name=MotherSimpson/> For 27 years Homer presumed that his mother was dead. He was accidentally reunited with Mona after he faked his death to get a day off of work and Mona visited his supposed gravesite. Overjoyed at their reunion, he brings Mona home to meet his family. At first, Mona does not reveal her whereabouts and spends some [[quality time]] catching up with her family, but is forced to reveal her past. She later travels to the post office with Homer, where Mr. Burns recognizes her face and tracks her down with [[FBI]] assistance. Mona is forced to go on the run again, she tells Homer she loves him and escapes to the underground.<ref name=MotherSimpson/> 

In "[[D'oh-in in the Wind]]", it is revealed that at some point, Mona started hanging out at a commune with two hippies Seth and Munchie after life with Abraham became unbearable. The exact timeframe of this is unknown, but it is possible that it was before she went on the run from the law because she brought Homer and Abraham along with her to the [[Woodstock Festival]]. It is also strongly implied that she was unfaithful to Abraham.<ref name=Wind>{{cite episode|title=D'oh-in in the Wind|episodelink=D'oh-in in the Wind|series=The Simpsons|credits=[[Donick Cary|Cary, Donick]]; [[Mark Kirkland|Kirkland, Mark]]; [[Matthew Nastuk|Nastuk, Matthew]]|network=Fox|airdate=1998-11-15|season=10|number=06}}</ref>

In "[[My Mother the Carjacker]]", Homer discovers a secret message left for him in a newspaper that tells him to go to a location. Homer does, and finds Mona, who explains that she had to return after she saw a macaroni pencil holder Homer had made for her when he was five. Still on the run from the law, she is captured by the police and forced to go on trial for the crime she committed. Due to Homer's heartfelt testimony she is [[acquitted]]. Mr. Burns is angered by this and has her imprisoned for the minor charge of signing into a national park under a false name. As she is being transported to jail, Homer attempts to break her free from the prison bus, but the chase ends in what appears to be her death when the bus drives off a cliff and lands in the water, where it explodes, and sets off a rock avalanche which buries it. In truth, she narrowly escaped before the bus went off the cliff, and is still on the run.<ref name=Carjacker>{{cite episode|title=My Mother the Carjacker|episodelink=My Mother the Carjacker|series=The Simpsons|credits=[[Michael Price (writer)|Price, Michael]]; [[Nancy Kruse|Kruse, Nancy]]|network=Fox|airdate=2003-11-09|season=15|number=02}}</ref>

Mona returned in "[[Mona Leaves-a]]" to try to make up for lost time with Homer, but he angrily refuses, saying that she will just end up abandoning him again. That night, Mona arrives for one last apology, and says that by trying to fix the world, she learned she was destroying her own. After Homer still says no, Mona, understanding that their relationship needs time, leaves the room. Homer feels guilty about being mad at her and tries to make up with her only to find she has passed away. She is cremated and according to her will, Homer is supposed to throw her ashes out on a mountain where they disrupt a missile guidance system which would have devastated the [[Amazon Rainforest]] once again plotted by Burns. Although disappointed that the last thing his mother asked him to do was  "another hippie protest", Homer successfully stops the launch. The episode ends with a flashback of the time Mona spent with Homer.<ref name=Leaves>{{cite episode|title=Mona Leaves-a|episodelink=Mona Leaves-a|series=The Simpsons|credits=[[Joel H.

==Character==
===Creation===
[[Image:Mona Simpson - first appearance.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Mona in her first appearance in "[[Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?]]"]]
Mona Simpson is first mentioned in [[The Simpsons (season 1)|season one]]'s "[[There's No Disgrace Like Home]]", where Homer recalls his mother telling him that he's a "big disappointment". She later made two brief flashback appearances, the first being [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]]'s "[[Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?]]" and the second being [[The Simpsons (season 6)|season six]]'s "[[Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy]]", and in both cases she was voiced by [[Maggie Roswell]].<ref name="IGN"/> Mona's first major appearance was in [[The Simpsons (season 7)|the seventh season]] episode "[[Mother Simpson]]". The episode was pitched by [[Richard Appel]], who had been desperately trying to think of a story idea and decided to do something about Homer's mother.<ref name="Appel">Appel, Richard (2005). Commentary for "Mother Simpson", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Many of the writers were surprised that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced.<ref name="Oakley"/> The writers used the episode as an opportunity to solve several puzzles about the show, such as where [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]'s intelligence came from.<ref name="Appel"/> The character is named after Richard Appel's wife, who is the novelist [[Mona Simpson]].<ref name="Appel"/>  The inspiration for the character comes from [[Bernardine Dohrn]] of the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]], although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description.<ref name="Oakley"/> Her crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because she came back to help Mr. Burns.<ref name="Oakley"/>

Mona Simpson was designed in a way so that she has a little bit of Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose.<ref name="Silverman">Silverman, David (2005). Commentary for "Mother Simpson", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be "Simpson-esque".<ref name="Silverman"/>

===Voice===
[[Image:Glenn Close.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Glenn Close]] has voiced Mona in three episodes]]
[[Glenn Close]] was convinced to voice the character in "Mother Simpson" partially because of [[James L. Brooks]].<ref name="Groening">Groening, Matt (2005). Commentary for "Mother Simpson", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> She was directed in her first performance by Josh Weinstein.<ref name="Oakley">Oakley, Bill (2005). Commentary for "Mother Simpson", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> When Mona gets in the van, her voice is done by [[Pamela Hayden]] because Glenn Close could not say "[[D'oh!|d'oh!]]" properly<ref name="Oakley"/> and thus they used the original [[temp track]] recorded by Hayden.<ref name="Appel"/>

Glenn Close would record original material for two other episodes, [[The Simpsons (season 15)|season 15]]'s "[[My Mother the Carjacker]]" and [[The Simpsons (season 19)|season 19]]'s "[[Mona Leaves-a]]".<ref name=Sweeps>{{cite news|title=Fox unleashes a May sweeps to remember|publisher=FoxFlash|date=[[2008-04-15]]|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z1z25z1z8&ID=4087|accessdate=2008-04-15}}</ref> A deleted scene featuring Mona from "Mother Simpson" would appear in [[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]]'s "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]". The character would also have a speaking appearance in [[The Simpsons (season 10)|season ten]]'s "[[D'oh-in in the Wind]]", this time voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].

"Mother Simpson" is one of [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]]'s favorite episodes as they feel it is a perfect combination of real emotion, good jokes and an interesting story<ref name="Weinstein">Weinstein, Josh (2005). Commentary for "Mother Simpson", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> and they have expressed regret about not submitting it for the [[Emmy Award]] in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)]] category.<ref name="Oakley"/> "My Mother the Carjacker" received a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nomination in 2004 in the animation category.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/WGA_Announces_Screenplay_Noms/1740296|title=WGA Annouces Screenplay Noms|accessdate=2008-11-17|publisher=Hollywood.com}}</ref> "Mona Leaves-a" received mixed reviews from critics. Robert Canning described it as "clunky and forced and wasn't all that funny" but still gave it a 7/10.<ref name=IGNLeaves/> Richard Keller called it a decent episode, but despised Mona's brief appearance.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keller|first=Richard|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/05/12/the-simpsons-mona-leaves-a/|title=The Simpsons:Mona Leaves-a VIDEO|publisher=[[TV Squad]]|date=[[2008-05-12]]|accessdate=2008-11-17}}</ref>
