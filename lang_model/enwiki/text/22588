'''Alfredo Stroessner Matiauda''' ([[November 3]], [[1912]]&ndash;[[August 16]], [[2006]]) was a politician and general from [[Paraguay]] who served as president of that country from 1954 to 1989.

==Early life==
Stroessner was born in [[Encarnaci<U+00F3>n, Paraguay|Encarnaci<U+00F3>n]]; his father, Hugo, was an accountant for a brewery who emigrated from [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]; his mother, Heriberta Matiauda, the daughter of a wealthy local family, was a Paraguayan [[Nationality|national]] of [[Guaran<U+00ED>]] descent. His name is spelled either Stroessner, Str<U+00F6>ssner or Str<U+00F6><U+00DF>ner. At the age of 17, Stroessner joined the [[Paraguayan army]] and became a lieutenant two years later. He fought in the [[Chaco War]] against [[Bolivia]] in 1932. Over the subsequent years he rose steadily in rank. In 1948, he attained the rank of [[brigadier general]] and became the youngest [[general officer]] in [[South America]].

Stroessner became overcommandant of the army and, in 1954, he was appointed to Divisions general and later forced [[Federico Ch<U+00E1>vez]] out of office in the [[military coup]] of 4 May 1954. Stroessner became president and then was re-elected to 8 consecutive terms (in 1958, 1963, 1968, 1973, 1978, 1983, 1988). In many of these elections, he was either the sole candidate, or the fairness of the election was heavily disputed. He stayed in power for 35 years, with only [[Fidel Castro]] having a longer tenure among 20th century Latin American leaders.

==Politics==
Stroessner was a very energetic leader and reportedly started his working days at 4 a.m. by giving orders from his bed and going to work in the government palace no later than 6 a.m.; although he took a three-hour break at mid-day, Stroessner reportedly worked until 1 a.m.  He never took a vacation while president.

Stroessner despised [[communism]] and his regime thus found itself friendly to [[Foreign relations of the United States|United States]] interests. During Stroessner's rule, no communist nations had [[embassies]] in Paraguay, with the sole exception of [[Yugoslavia]]. He was also respected for the financial discipline of his policy of re-paying loans granted to the Paraguayan government by the [[World Bank]] and other institutions and thus keeping the currency stable. The friendship with the U.S. continued for many years until the [[Carter Administration]] and then the [[Reagan Administration]] began to boycott his regime and country.

As a statesman, Stroessner made numerous state visits, including to [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] of [[Foreign relations of Japan|Japan]], President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] of the United States, President [[Charles de Gaulle]] of [[Foreign relations of France|France]] and several visits to [[West Germany]], although over the years his relations with West Germany soured. Since he had always been known as pro-German, this worsening of relations, combined with his feeling that the U.S. had abandoned him, were regarded as personal blows to Stroessner.

Although Stroessner was a very strict [[autocrat]], he did become more tolerant of political opposition over the course of time. However, it is estimated by some that his regime, which took part in [[Operation Condor]] with [[Augusto Pinochet]] and [[Jorge Rafael Videla]], cost the lives of between 400 and 3,000 people due to strong-arm tactics during his 35-year rule. His regime is also blamed for [[torture]], [[kidnappings]] and widespread [[political corruption|corruption]], of which the "[[terror archives]]", discovered in 1992 in [[Lambar<U+00E9>]] suburb of [[Asunci<U+00F3>n]], gave proof; he has not disputed charges of corruption at some levels in his government. 

Stroessner also had very poor relations with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and is blamed for numerous actions against the church; some maintain that the Catholic Church is the only reason Stroessner did not have absolute control over the country. After the destruction of [[Asuncion]] University in 1972 by police, the [[Archbishop]] of Paraguay excommunicated the minister of the interior and the chief of police, and proscribed the celebration of [[mass]] in a sign of protest against the Stroessner regime. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Paraguay in 1988, his visit energized Paraguayan dissidents, and bolstered what was already a robust anti-Stroessner movement within the country.

Stroessner showed definite sympathies to [[ex-Nazis]], some of whom were in the approximately 200,000 Germans who came to Paraguay after the [[World War II]], a group that included the infamous Dr. [[Josef Mengele]], whom Stroessner repeatedly denied [[extradition]] requests to [[Israel]]. After twice denying [[extradition]] requests for Mengele, Stroessner was heavily criticized by the world media. His regime also lost foreign support after the [[genocidal]] acts it committed against the [[Ach<U+00E9>]] by [[New Tribes Mission]]. Some of the Ach<U+00E9> were tortured in the infamous [[Tecnica]] torture center as well.

Stroessner was, however, known for several positive economic policies, including the building of the [[Itaipu|largest hydroelectric power plant in the world]], with which he exported electricity to other countries, developing [[Economy of Paraguay|Paraguay's economy]]. He was also known for many infrastructure projects that improved the country's highway system. Another program that Stroessner supported was the granting of twenty hectares of arable lands for a nominal price to any soldier who completed military service, provided that the soldier would use the land for farming purposes. Over 10,000 soldiers took up this offer.

==Downfall==
{{current-section}}
On 3 February 1989, after almost exactly 34 years and 9 months in power, Stroessner was ousted by a [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] led by General [[Andr<U+00E9>s Rodr<U+00ED>guez]], and he fled to [[Brazil]], where he lived in exile for the next seventeen and a half years.

The eastern city [[Puerto Flor de Lis]] was renamed [[Puerto Presidente Stroessner]] in his honour, but in 1989 was then again renamed [[Ciudad del Este]].

Paraguayans remain divided on Stroessner and his controversial legacy. Many feel a strong sense of distaste toward him, perceiving him as a widely corrupt, authoritarian dictator. However, those who defend his legacy cite the political stability and economic progress that prevailed under his rule. 
Stroessner died of a lung complication on [[16 August]] [[2006]], in [[Bras<U+00ED>lia]], at the age of 93. The immediate cause of death was a [[stroke]]. He had been suffering from [[pneumonia]] after undergoing an earlier [[hernia]] operation.

President [[Nicanor Duarte]] has preemptively dismissed any suggestions for honoring the late dictator within Paraguay.
