'''''Jack and the Beanstalk''''' is an [[England|English]] [[fairy tale]], closely associated with the tale of ''[[Jack the Giant Killer]]''. It is known under a number of versions.  [[Benjamin Tabart]]'s moralized version of 1807<ref>Tabart, ''The History of Jack and the Bean-Stalk'' (1807) introduces a new character, a [[fairy]] who explains the moral of the tale to Jack (M.O. Grenby, "Tame Fairies Make Good Teachers: The Popularity of Early British Fairy Tales", ''The Lion and the contuvial'' '''30'''.1, (January 2006:1-24).</ref> is the first appearance in print, but [[Joseph Jacobs]] popularized it in ''English Fairy Tales'' (1890).<ref>Joseph Jacobs, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/jackbeanstalk/index.html Jack and the Beanstalk]", ''English Fairy Tales''</ref>  Jacobs's version is most commonly reprinted today and is believed to more closely adhere to the oral versions than Tabart's, because it lacks the moralizing of that version.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 132, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', ISBN 0-393-05163-3</ref> The story was made into a play by [[Charles Ludlam]]. 

== Plot summary ==
The story tells of a boy named [[Jack (hero)|Jack]] who was sent to the market one day by his mother to sell their cow. As Jack proceeded to the market he met a stranger who offered to trade five "magic beans" for the cow. Jack accepted the trade and returned back home with the beans in his pocket. Jack's mother was angered that he had not obeyed her instructions to sell the cow and threw the beans out of the window.
As Jack slept, the beans germinated into the soil and a gigantic beanstalk grew in their place by morning.  When Jack saw the huge beanstalk, he immediately decided to climb up it. He arrived in a land high up in the clouds that happened to be the home of a [[giant (mythology)|giant]]. When he broke into the giant's castle, the giant quickly sensed a human was near:

:''[[Fee-fi-fo-fum]]!''
:''I smell the blood of an Englishman.''
:''Be he 'live, or be he dead,''
:''I'll grind his bones to make my bread.''

However, Jack was saved by the giant's wife and as he escaped from the palace, he took a bag of gold coins with him.  Jack desired to seek out more treasures from the castle in the clouds and climbed once more up the beanstalk.
This time he stole a [[hen that lays golden eggs|hen which laid golden eggs]]. Again he was saved from harm by the giant's wife.

Jack disregarded being nearly discovered by the giant twice and decided to go up the beanstalk a [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] time. This time, he stole a magical [[harp]] that played by itself. The instrument did not appreciate being stolen and called out to the giant for help. The giant chased Jack down the beanstalk, but Jack managed to get to the ground before the giant did. Jack, seeing an axe on the ground beside him, immediately chopped the beanstalk down. The giant fell to earth, hitting the ground so hard that it split, pulling the beanstalk down with him.That was the end of the giant and the beanstalk.

==Origin==
[[Image:Walter Crane19.jpg|thumb|right|In [[Walter Crane]]'s woodcut the harp reaches out to cling to the vine]]
The origin of ''Jack and the Beanstalk'' is unknown, although the author was almost certainly [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[Germany|German]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}} The earliest printed edition which has survived is the 1807 book ''The History of Jack and the Bean Stalk'', printed by [[Benjamin Tabart]], although the story was already in existence sometime before this, as a [[Burlesque (genre)|burlesque]] of the story entitled ''The Story of Jack Spriggins and the Enchanted Bean'' was included in the 1734 second edition of ''Round About Our Coal-Fire''.

In the usual version of the tale, the giant is unnamed, but many plays based on the story name him as '''Blunderbore'''; a giant of that name also appears in ''[[Jack the Giant-Killer]]''.

The beanstalk is reminiscent of the ancient English belief in a [[World tree]] connecting earth to heaven.

The giant's "Fee! Fie! Foe! Fum!" was included in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]''.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 136, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', ISBN 0-393-05163-3</ref>

==Variants==
Other tales of this type include the Italian ''[[Thirteenth (fairy tale)|Thirteenth]]'' and the French ''[[How the Dragon was Tricked]]''.

The [[Brothers Grimm]] drew analogies between this tale and the German ''[[The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs]]'', where the devil's mother or grandmother acted much like the wife in this tale:  a female figure protecting the child from the evil male figure.<ref>Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Grimm's Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/grimms/29devilgoldhairs.html "The Devil With the Three Golden Tooth"]</ref>

The tale is unusual in that the hero, although grown, does not marry at the end of it but returns to his mother; this is found in few other tales, although some, such as some variants of ''[[Vasilissa the Beautiful]]'', do feature it.<ref>Maria Tatar, ''Off with Their Heads!'' p. 199 ISBN 0-691-06943-3</ref>

One of the many retellings of the tale appears in ''[[A Book of Giants]]'' and ''[[A Choice of Magic]]'' by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]].

==Controversies==
The story portrays a hero unscrupulously hiding in a man's house, playing on his wife's sympathies in order to rob and finally murder the owner of the house. In Tabart's version, a fairy woman explains to Jack that the giant had robbed and killed his father, thus transforming the acts into justice.<ref>Maria Tatar, ''Off with Their Heads!'' p. 198 ISBN 0-691-06943-3</ref>

Jacobs dropped the justification on the grounds that it had not been in the version he had heard as a child, and because children knew that robbery and murder were wrong without being told so by a fairy tale.<ref>Joseph Jacobs, ''English Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/english/jackbeanstalk.html Notes to "Jack and the Beanstalk"]</ref>

Many modern interpretations have followed Tabart and painted the giant as a villain, terrorizing smaller folk and often stealing items of value, so that Jack becomes a legitimate protagonist. For example, the [[Jack and the Beanstalk (1952 film)|1952 film]] starring [[Abbott and Costello]] blames the giant for Jack's ill fortunes and impoverishment, as he has been stealing food and wealth from the smaller folk of the lands below his home, including the hen that lays golden eggs, which in this version originally belonged to Jack's family. In other versions it is implied that the giant had stolen the hen and the harp from Jack's father. And since Jack's father neither appears in the story nor is he mentioned, it is often speculated that the giant murdered him. And thus, Jack's killing the giant is not only self-defense, but also an act of divine vengeance{{Who|date=March 2009}}. However, [[Brian Henson]]'s 2001 TV miniseries [[Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story]] is an alternative version of the tale which abandons Tabart's additions and significantly vilifies Jack, due to Henson's disgust with Jack's morally questionable actions in the original story.<ref>Joe Nazzaro, Back to the Beanstalk, Starlog Fantasy Worlds (magazine), February 2002, pages 56-59,</ref>

==Film adaptations==

[[Walt Disney]] made a short of the same name in 1922, and a separate adaptation entitled ''[[Mickey and the Beanstalk]]'' in 1947 as part of ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]].''  This adaptation of the story put [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]] in the role of Jack.  Mickey, Donald and Goofy live in a place called "Happy Valley" which is plagued by a severe drought, and they have nothing to eat except one loaf of bread.  Mickey trades in the cow (which Donald was going to kill for food) for the magic beans.  Donald throws the beans out the window in a fit of rage, and the beanstalk sprouts.  In the magical kingdom, Mickey, Donald and Goofy help themselves to a sumptuous feast.  This rouses the ire of the giant (named "Willy" in this version), who captures Donald and Goofy and locks them in a box with a singing golden [[harp]], and it's up to Mickey to find the keys to unlock the box and rescue them.  The story villainizes the giant by blaming Happy Valley's hard times on Willy's theft of the magic harp, whose song kept the land prosperous; unlike the harp of the original tale, this magic harp ''wants'' to be rescued from the giant, and the hapless heroes return her to her rightful place and Happy Valley to its former glory. This version of the fairy tale was narrated by [[Edgar Bergen]].

[[Warner Bros.]] adapted the story into three [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoons. [[Friz Freleng]] directed ''[[Jack-Wabbit and the Beanstalk]]'' (1943), [[Chuck Jones]] directed ''[[Beanstalk Bunny]]'' (1955), and Freleng directed  ''[[Tweety and the Beanstalk]]'' (1957). In 1966 [[Hanna-Barbera]] produced a [[Live-action/animated film|live action version]] of ''Jack and the Beanstalk'', with [[Gene Kelly]] that won an [[Emmy Award]].<ref name="BarberaAutoBio">{{cite book|last=Barbera|first=Joseph|title=My Life in "Toons": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|year=1994|publisher=[[Turner Publishing]]|location=Atlanta, GA|isbn= 1-57036-042-1| pages=162-165}}</ref> 

[[Gisaburo Sugii]] directed a feature-length [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] telling of the story of Jack and the Beanstalk in 1974, titled ''Jack to Mame no Ki''.  The film, a musical, was produced by [[Group TAC]] and released by [[Nippon Herald]].  The writers introduced a few new characters, including Jack's comic-relief dog, Crosby, and Margaret, a beautiful princess engaged to be married to the giant (named "Tulip" in this version) due to a spell being cast over her by the giant's mother (an evil witch).  Jack, however, develops a crush on Margaret, and one of his aims in returning to the magic kingdom is to rescue her.  The film was dubbed into English, with legendary voice talent [[Billie Lou Watt]] voicing Jack, and received a very limited run in U.S. theaters in 1976.  It was later released on VHS (now out of print) and aired several times on [[HBO]] in the 1980s.  However, it is now available on DVD with both English and Japanese dialogue.

[[Michael Davis (director)|Michael Davis]] directed the 1994 adaptation entitled ''Beanstalk'', starring J.D. Davis as Jack and [[Stuart Pankin]] as the Giant. The film was released by [[Full Moon Features|Full Moon Entertainment]], a subsidiary of [[Paramount Pictures]].

The newest film adaptation was [[Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story]] (2001), directed by [[Brian Henson]].

==Other media==
{{Trivia|date=December 2008}}
In [[Edward Eager]]'s book [[Knight's Castle]], through the use of magic a modern boy named Jack is able to enter a [[toy]] [[castle]] with his sister and cousins.  When he encounters the inhabitants (his toy knight figurine and the girls' dolls who have come to life), upon learning his name they draw back in terror and ask "Not the Giant Killer?"

The story is the basis of the similarly titled traditional British [[Pantomime]], wherein the Giant is certainly a villain, Jack's mother the Dame and Jack the Principal Boy.

Jack of Jack and the Beanstalk is the protagonist of the [[comic book]] ''[[Jack of Fables]]'', a spin-off of ''[[Fables (comic)|Fables]]'' which also features other elements from the story such as giant beanstalks and giants living in the clouds.

DI Jack Spratt of the Nursery Crimes Division from the book ''[[The Big Over Easy]]'' by [[Jasper Fforde]] feels a strange impulse to climb the giant beanstalk that was grown in his mother's yard after she threw out the magic beans he had traded for her [[George Stubbs|Stubbs]] painting of a cow.  He is also thought to be a giant killer though out of the four only one was technically a giant, the others were just very tall.  All the killings were in self-defense.

The [[Man Man]] song, Engrish Bwudd, features the chorus "Fee Fi Fo Fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman."

[[Roald Dahl]] rewrote the story in a more modern and gruesome way in his book [[Revolting Rhymes]] (1982).  The story of Jack and the Beanstalk is also featured in Dahl's [[The BFG]], in which the evil giants are all afraid of the "giant-killer" Jack, who is said to kill giants with his fearsome beanstalk.

In the [[Crash Tag Team Racing]] game, a track is named " Track and the Beanstalk ".

[[Peter Combe]] rewrote the story in an upbeat song ('80s '90s?)

An episode of the [[BBC]] television series ''[[The Big Knights]]'' retold the story with the show's human protagonists as the "giants" to a race of tiny people living in their garden.

[[Spyro: Year of The Dragon]] features "Jack and the Beanstalk" on the level "Charmed Ridge". The two magic beans grow two different plants which Spyro and Jack use to get higher up the [[mountain]] where Jack wants to find the legendary Golden Goose.

An episode of ''The Super Mario Bros. Super Show'', titled "[[Mario and the Beanstalk]]", does a retelling with [[Bowser]] as the giant (no explanation as to how he becomes a giant).

''[[Garfield and Friends]]'' parodied the story with a ''[[U.S. Acres]]'' segment titled "Jack II: The Rest of the Story". After Orson reads the original story to them, Booker, Sheldon, Roy, and Wade write up a satirical sequel patching up plot holes they noticed and villainizing Jack (who ends up in prision).

In the ''[[The Magic School Bus]]'' episode "Gets Planted", the class put on a school production of ''Jack and the Beanstalk'', Phoebe starring as the beanstalk after [[Ms. Frizzle]] turned her into a bean plant.

An episode of ''[[The Goodies]]'', entitled "[[The Goodies and the Beanstalk]]" is a retelling of the tale, containing a spoof of the game show ''[[It's a Knockout]]'' and Tim, Graeme and Bill's own rendition of the song ''"Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?"'' There are also geese and hens that lay gold eggs and even gold bars, and the giant turns out to be only the same size as the Goodies!

[[Stephen Sondheim]]'s musical [[Into the Woods]] features Jack along with several other fairy-tale characters. In the second half of the musical, the Giant's Wife climbs down the stalk to exact revenge for her husband's death, furious at Jack's betrayal of her hospitality.  She is eventually killed as well.

The chorus from the song CRUA CHAN of the Argentinian rock Band [[Sumo (band)|Sumo]] says "Fee fi fo fum,I smell the blood of an Englishman"

In an episode of [[Rocko's Modern Life]], Rocko & Heffer take turns telling an amalgamated fairy tale to a flu-ridden Filbert.  At one point in the story, Hansel & "Debbie" (represented by Heffer & Rocko, respectively) scale the beanstalk where they encounter the giant (Filbert) who exclaimes, "Fee, fie, foe, fum... something stinks!

In the game, [[Harvest Moon (SNES)]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], if your farmer (named Jack in other versions of the game) sells a full-grown, happy cow in fall, a peddler will come and trade her for a bean (this makes the live-stock merchant angry, but he forgives you).  Plant the bean in the spring (non-rainy day) at the top of the mountain, and it will sprout.  Leave the mountain top, then return.  The sprout will have become a beanstalk.  Climb the beanstalk, and you'll find a castle in the clouds.  In the castle is a golden chicken.  Talk to the golden chicken, and she'll give you a golden egg.  The next scene has you selling the gold egg to the peddler in the town market for a whopping 60,000 gold!

On Dunce Upon A Time an episode on [[Happy Tree Friends]] Is a parody of jack and the beanstalk
when [[Giggles]] is jack on this episode [[Lumpy]] is the giant and there are 11 deaths. And then [[Nutty]] grew a tree in his mouth and the house raised up in the sky and to the giants castle.

In the game [http://www.wurb.com/if/game/1 Adventure] written by William Crowther & Donald Woods, there is a section of the cave which is themed after the giant: The player has to climb a beanstalk which is growing out of a bottom of a pit to get to a hole in the ceiling, which leads to a room called, appropriately, "the giant room" where there is a nest of golden eggs, and "fee fie foe foo[sic]" written on the wall.

In an episode of the popular BBC sitcom Bottom, the television is taken back to [[Rumbelow's]], and Richie blames Eddie for falling behind with the rent as he had apparently bought five magic beans from a strange and wizened old man which cost exactly the <U+00A3>86.23 they owed in back rent, which is an obvious reference to the story.

The SUPER WHY! PBS series focuses on the adventures of four fairytale friends - The main character, Whyatt Beanstalk, is Jack's younger brother, Red of "Little Red Riding Hood" fame, Littlest Pig from "The Three Little Pigs" and Princess Pea of the classic "The Princess and the Pea."
