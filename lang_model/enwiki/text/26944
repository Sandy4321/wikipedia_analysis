'''Textbooks in Israel''' refers to school textbooks published in [[Israel]] by the [[Ministry of Education of Israel]] and other educational institutions.

The [[Ministry of Education of Israel]] defines the [[curriculum]] of schools in Israel and is in charge of the recruitment and training of teachers. Until recently, the Ministry of Education issued an approved list of schoolbooks, but this practice has been stopped on the grounds that Israel is a modern country and does not engage in censorship. The Ministry may disqualify textbooks containing prejudices and stereotypes in response to complaints from the public, a method described as  "far more effective than censorship exerted by a civil servant".<ref name=CMIP_rpt2000>[http://www.teachkidspeace.org/reports/IsraeliTextbooks2000.pdf Arabs and Palestinians in Israeli Textbooks, September 2000 Report] by [[Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace]] (also available at [http://www.edume.org]), p.10</ref>

==History==
The Compulsory Education Law<ref>CMIP 2000 report, p.9: "The Compulsory Education Law adopted in 1949, extended in 1968, 1979 and 1999"</ref>, provides free and compulsory education for all children between the ages of 5 to 18, from the last year of kindergarten up to 12th grade<ref>http://www.haaretz.com/news/knesset-extends-compulsory-education-law-to-12th-grade-1.235897</ref>. 

==Analysis of Israeli textbooks==
An analysis of Israeli textbooks in 2000 by the [[Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace]] (CMIP) found that legitimacy of the State of Israel as independent Jewish state on the territory of the Land of Israel and the immigration of Jews to the country was never questioned. There was no indoctrination against the Arabs as a nation, nor a negative presentation of Islam. Islam, Arab culture and the Arabs' contribution to human civilization were presented in a positive light. No book called for violence or war. Many books express the yearning for peace between Israel and the Arab countries.<ref>[http://www.ecomtrade.co.il/eMall/shops/1559/imgbank/Israeli%20Report%20-%20September%202000.pdf CMIP 2000 report, p.6 Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace report]</ref>

In textbooks for state-run schools, there was an effort to remove stereotypes and educate towards tolerance. In some textbooks for the Orthodox Jewish community, the researchers found derogatory adjectives, prejudices, patronizing expressions and disrespect toward Arabs. The Arab leadership was portrayed as motivated by an eternal hatred independent of historical circumstances. In textbooks for every age, Israel's wars are described as justified wars of defense, and the Arabs held responsible for them.<ref>CMIP 2000 report, p.76</ref>The [[Palestinian exodus]] is attributed to the fact that the Arabs fled from their homes. Only few textbooks stated that some refugees were expelled by Israel or were forced to flee through threats. Some do not mention  the Palesinian exodus at all.<ref>[CMIP 2000 report, p.78 CMIP 2000 report]</ref>

[[Islam]] is described with respect in both the general the religious state-run educational streams. Many books elaborate in detail how [[Muhammad]] established Islam and explain its basic fundamentals in a factual, objective manner. Many books highlight positive aspects in Islam. The language is factual and devoid of offensive terms and stereotypes. Sites holy to both Jews and Muslims are not presented as exclusively Jewish and the Arabs' attachment to these sites is taught. The students are even taught about the Muslims affinity to Jerusalem, although, the focus is on the religious, rather than the political dimension.<ref name="CMIP 2000 report, p.7">CMIP 2000 report, p.7</ref>The CIMP report found that it was only in the ultra-orthodox stream that textbooks contained  prejudice, patronizing expressions and disrespect to Arabs.<ref name=CMIP_rpt2000/>

The report further stated that in textbooks of both the general state-run network and the religious state-run network, there was a genuine effort to remove stereotypes and to build a foundation for coexistence and mutual respect between the two peoples. There are many stories that describe friendships between Jews and Arabs in Islamic countries and in Israel even in times of war. There are stories of Jews helping Arabs in daily life and in war as well as stories of Arabs rescuing Jews from physical harm and helping Jews to maintain their religion and identity. In many literary anthologies there are stories about the daily life of Arabs written by Arab authors. Some stories deal with the tensions created by the transition from a traditional society with its values and customs, to a modern western society.<ref name="CMIP 2000 report, p.7"/>In some books in the ultra-orthodox network relations between Arabs and Jews were portrayed in negative terms.<ref name=CMIP_rpt2000/>

==2001 update==
Despite the deterioration in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians since September 2000, no negative changes were noted in the new textbooks with regard to the image of the Arabs, the description of the conflict, the presentation of Islam, questions of war and peace and education to tolerance and conciliation. On the contrary, the positive trends noted in the earlier report were strengthened.<ref name=CMIP_rpt2001>[http://www.teachkidspeace.org/reports/IsraeliTextbooks2002.pdf 2002 Update by CMIP]</ref>The textbooks of the ultra-Orthodox schools continued to use language conveying an air of superiority. 

Maps of Israel included all the territory between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan. Many textbooks showed maps of the Middle East on which only Israel's name appeared, with the territories of the surrounding Arab countries left blank.<ref name=CMIP_rpt2001/>

==Conflicting findings==
In his 2004 article "The Arab Image in Hebrew School Textbooks," Dan Bar-Tal of [[Tel Aviv University]] studied 124 textbooks used in Israeli schools. He concluded that generations of Israeli Jews have been taught a negative and often delegitimizing view of Arabs. He claims Arabs are portrayed in these textbooks as primitive, inferior in comparison to Jews, violent, untrustworthy, fanatic, treacherous and aggressive. While history books in the elementary schools hardly mentioned Arabs, the high school textbooks that covered the Arab-Jewish conflict, stereotyped Arabs negatively, as intransigent and uncompromising.<ref>[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/21480/format/html/displaystory.html Reports on Palestinian kids<U+2019> hatred grossly exaggerated]</ref>

==Nakba terminology==
Israel prohibits the use of the word [[Nakba]] in Israeli Arab textbooks. Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] justified the ban by saying that the term was "propaganda against Israel."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLM2389 |title=Israel bans "catastrophe" term from Arab schools |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2009-07-22}}</ref>
