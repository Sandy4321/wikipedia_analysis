'''Byron Antron Leftwich''' (born January 14, 1980 in [[Washington, D.C.]]) is an [[American football]] [[quarterback]]  in the [[National Football League]] who currently plays for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. He was drafted by the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] seventh overall in the [[2003 NFL Draft]]. He played [[college football]] at [[Marshall Thundering Herd football|Marshall]].

Leftwich has also played for the [[Atlanta Falcons]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. He earned a [[Super Bowl ring]] with the Steelers in [[Super Bowl XLIII]].

==Early years==
Leftwich attended H.D. Woodson High School in Washington, D.C. and was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. He garnered an honorable mention on the Washington Post's All-Met football team in 1997 as a senior. He was also first team All-[[DCIAA]] East in basketball his senior year.

==College career==
Leftwich starred at [[Marshall University]] in [[West Virginia]]. He gained recognition after quarterbacking a 64&ndash;61 overtime victory over [[East Carolina University]] in the 2001 [[GMAC Bowl]] (in which he took on future teammate [[David Garrard]]). He is also remembered for being carried by linemen [[Steve Sciullo]] and Steve Perretta, after breaking his shin and returning to the game, down the field on multiple series as he rallied his team to a 17 point comeback against [[Akron University|Akron]] in November 2002 (although still lost 34-20.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/features/the100?index=100 ESPN.com - NCAA College Football - The 100]</ref> Leftwich, along with fellow Marshall alumni [[Chad Pennington]] and [[Randy Moss]] is also credited for helping the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC) gain more national attention (Marshall has since joined [[Conference USA]]).

He was the MVP of the [[2000 Motor City Bowl]].

Leftwich, for his career at Marshall completed 939 of 1,442 passes (65.1 percent) for 11,903 yards, 89 touchdowns and only 28 interceptions. He amassed 12,090 yards of total offense on 1,632 plays, ranking second on the school<U+2019>s all-time record lists behind Chad Pennington.

==Professional career==
===2003 NFL Draft===
At the [[2003 NFL Draft]], the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Baltimore Ravens]] agreed to a trade to move the Ravens into position to take Leftwich with Minnesota's seventh overall selection. However, one of the teams had second thoughts at the last minute and the Vikings missed the allotted time for their pick. As a result, they defaulted the selection and were dropped to ninth. The Jaguars, originally supposed to draft eighth, moved up and took Leftwich with the seventh overall pick.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===
Leftwich took over as the Jaguars starting quarterback in game four of his rookie year after [[Mark Brunell]] was injured in the previous week's matchup against the [[Indianapolis Colts]].

For the first 11 games of the 2005 regular season, Leftwich was developing into the quarterback the Jaguars believed he would become when they picked him in the first round of the 2003 NFL Draft. He obtained a passer rating of 89.3, ninth-best in the NFL, and a 3:1 touchdown:interception ratio (15:5).

However in the regular season against the [[Arizona Cardinals]], Leftwich suffered a broken ankle after being sacked by Cardinals' safety [[Adrian Wilson (American football)|Adrian Wilson]] on the first play of the game. Leftwich missed the remaining five games of the regular season. He returned against the [[New England Patriots]] in the AFC Wild Card round of the playoffs. The Patriots won 28<U+2013>3.

Leftwich entered his fourth NFL season as the Jaguars starting quarterback, but without veteran wide receiver [[Jimmy Smith (football)|Jimmy Smith]], who suddenly retired in May 2006. Leftwich led the Jaguars to victories on national television in consecutive weeks against the favored [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] to begin the 2006 season. Leftwich suffered an [[ankle]] injury in a week 4 loss to the [[Washington Redskins]].  Following a week 6 loss to the [[Houston Texans]], Leftwich had surgery to repair the ankle, which effectively ended his season.

[[David Garrard]] replaced Leftwich for the remainder of the season. In his first seven games as Leftwich's replacement, Garrard led the Jaguars to five wins and two losses and an 8<U+2013>5 record through thirteen games in the season. Garrard's and the team's success in Leftwich's absence led to speculation that the Jaguars might seek to replace Leftwich permanently with Garrard. However, the Jaguars lost the three final games of the season, preventing the team from making the playoffs. Garrard struggled during the final three games. He threw three interceptions and fumbled once in a 24&ndash;17 loss to the [[Tennessee Titans]], whose offense had struggled throughout the game mustering only 98 total yards of offense to the Jaguars' 396. Three of the turnovers were returned for touchdowns, accounting for 21 of the Titans' 24 points.<ref>http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter?game_id=29078&displayPage=tab_gamecenter&season=2006&week=REG15</ref> The Jaguars lost their following two games against the [[New England Patriots]] and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. In the final game of the season, Garrard's ineffectiveness prompted Jaguars head coach Jack Del Rio to replace Garrard with backup [[Quinn Gray]].
 
In February 2007, Del Rio publicly reaffirmed his commitment to Leftwich, formally naming him as the team's starter over Garrard and Gray. If the team had been favoring Garrard after the first seven games of the season, his unfavorable performance in the final three games almost certainly led to reaffirmation of Leftwich.

After observing Leftwich's and Garrard's performances throughout the 2007 preseason, in the week preceding the first regular season game of 2007 Del Rio named Garrard the team's starter and declared that Leftwich would be either cut or traded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jaguars.com/News/Article.aspx?id=6273|title=Jags trying to move Leftwich|first=Vic|last=Ketchman|publisher=[[Jacksonville Jaguars]]|date=2007-08-31|accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref> The Jaguars cut Leftwich on September 1, 2007.

===Atlanta Falcons===
On September 17, 2007, Leftwich was flown out to [[Atlanta]] to meet with [[Atlanta Falcons]] officials, citing a possible signing with the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jaguars.com/News/Article.aspx?id=6280|title=Jaguars Trim Roster to 53|publisher=[[Jacksonville Jaguars]]|date=2007-09-01|accessdate=2007-09-02}}</ref> On September 18, Leftwich signed a two year deal with the Falcons with incentives attached that could make the deal worth up to $7 million.

Leftwich entered the season as a backup to starter [[Joey Harrington]]. After replacing Harrington late in Week 5, Leftwich got the start in Week 7 and played very well, before having to leave the game with an ankle sprain. He got the start again in Week 11 after returning from his injury. Harrington regained his starting position and Leftwich did not play again. On February 15, 2008, he was released by the Falcons. He worked out for the [[Tennessee Titans]] in July.

===First stint with Steelers===
On August 10, 2008, Leftwich was signed by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] to a one-year deal after Pittsburgh's backup [[Charlie Batch]] was injured in a pre-season game.<ref>{{cite news |title= Steelers sign Leftwich, Culpepper as QB fill-ins |url= http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=444019|work= NFL|publisher= [[Sporting News]]|date= 2008-08-09|accessdate=2008-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Steelers looking at QB Leftwich|url= http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=txsteelersleftwich&prov=st&type=lgns|work= NFL|publisher= [[Yahoo!

"I'm the guy sitting in the bullpen," he stated prior to the first game of the 2008 season, "if something were to happen, I have to go out there."<ref>{{cite news |first= Ed|last= Bouchette|title= Leftwich embraces new role as Steelers' No. 2 quarterback|url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08246/908702-66.stm|publisher= [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date= 2008-09-02|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> Leftwich performed well throughout the season when called upon, appearing in 5 games. During the 2008 season, he completed 21 of 36 attempts for 303 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions for a 104.3 passer rating, in addition to rushing for 1 touchdown. Leftwich earned a Super Bowl ring as the Steelers' backup when the Steelers defeated the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in [[Super Bowl XLIII]]<ref>[http://news.steelers.com/article/102487/ My Super Bowl Journey:Byron Leftwich]</ref>.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Leftwich agreed to terms on a two-year contract with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] on April 12, 2009.

On August 29, Buccaneers head coach Raheem Morris named Leftwich the team's starter for the 2009 regular season.

On September 28, Buccaneers benched Leftwich after a disappointing loss to the New York Giants and an 0-3 start to the season. [[Josh Johnson (American football)|Josh Johnson]] was named the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' new starting QB, while Leftwich moved down to 3rd string behind [[Josh Freeman]]. After spending several games inactive due to an elbow injury, on November 24, Leftwich was placed on injured reserve, ending his 2009 season.

===Second stint with Steelers===
Leftwich was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for a 2010 seventh-round draft pick on April 20, 2010. He was expected to be the starter while [[Ben Roethlisberger]] served his four game suspension<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5121614</ref>, but suffered a knee injury during the preseason finale against the Carolina Panthers. Leftwich was cut from the Steelers on September 18, 2010 in a temporary move to make room for defensive lineman [[Steve McLendon]], who was signed due to an injury to [[Casey Hampton]]. However, on September 19, Steelers quarterback Dennis Dixon was injured in a win over the [[Tennessee Titans]] and Leftwich was resigned on the morning of September 20.
