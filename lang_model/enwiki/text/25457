'''''Mind Meld: Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime''''' is a 2001 [[documentary film]] in which [[William Shatner]] and [[Leonard Nimoy]] discuss ''[[Star Trek]]'' and its effects on their lives. The two portrayed [[James T. Kirk]] and [[Spock]] respectively in the 1960s [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' and [[Star Trek (film franchise)|the subsequent film franchise]]. Among the topics discussed are the difficult relationships they had with [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of ''Star Trek'', and with several of the other cast members in the series who disliked Shatner. It was in ''Mind Meld'' that Nimoy first publicly revealed that he had struggled with [[alcoholism]] while he was acting in ''Star Trek: The Original Series''. Shatner talks about the death of his third wife, [[Nerine Kidd]], who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999 after having struggled with alcoholism.

''Mind Meld'' was produced as a way of advertising Shatner's personal website: williamshatner.com. Filming took place on September 5, 2001, at Nimoy's home, and narration was provided by veteran [[Voice acting|voice actor]] [[Billy West]]. The title of the film refers to a fictional practice in ''Star Trek'', a mind meld being a [[Telepathy|telepathic]] link a [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] is able to create with other organisms. The film was released for sale on Shatner's website on November 6, 2001, coinciding with the release of the [[director's cut]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. Adam Buckman, in his review in the ''[[New York Post]]'', alleged that a sound that occurs in the film is Shatner flatulating. This scene became a popular subject of [[flatulence humor]] among [[Star Trek fandom|''Star Trek'' fans]] and on [[morning zoo]] radio programs. In multiple interviews, Shatner denied this allegation.

Scott Brown of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an "F", and stated that the only people likely to watch the film other than extreme ''Star Trek'' fans are people who heard that the film includes the sound of Shatner flatulating. Laurence Lerman of ''Video Business'' praised the film for not "rehash[ing] anecdotes that have long been staples of Star Trek conventions and behind-the-scenes memoirs," but rather dealing with such topics as alcoholism, career difficulties, and conflicts on the set of ''Star Trek''. Writer Jim Dawson devoted an entire chapter of his book ''Blame It on the Dog: A Modern History of the Fart'' to what he argues to be Shatner's failed attempt to flatulate discreetly in the film.

Both men talk about family problems they encountered as a result of the pressures that accompanied acting in ''Star Trek''.<ref name=Guardian/> Shatner guides the course of the conversation more than Nimoy, and encourages him to talk about various aspects of his life during the production of the television series, including his fears regarding the legitimacy of consistently portraying an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] and other struggles with his acting career at the time.<ref name=Talk/> He says, "It took me a while, but I got rid of all that anger when I realized that I never had to worry about work ever since ''Star Trek'' went on the air."<ref name=Buckman/> It was in ''Mind Meld'' that Nimoy first publicly revealed that he had struggled with [[alcoholism]] during the 1960s ''Star Trek'' series, and he talks about his related experiences and subsequent recovery. He says that he developed "a major drinking habit, probably during the second or third year of" the series, and that he had his secretary bring him alcohol in paper cups at the end of each day of filming. Nimoy suggests that he became dependent on alcohol because of the deterioration of his marriage to [[Sandra Zober]], his first wife. He says that, after divorcing Zober in 1987 and marrying actress [[Susan Bay]] in 1988, he has been a [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]].<ref name=Mirror/>

Shatner says that ''Star Trek'' was the reason for his divorce from Gloria Rand, his first wife,<ref name=Mirror>{{Cite news|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|title=Bar Trek: Search for Spock|author=Mackenzie, Drew|page=4|date=October 11, 2001}}</ref> and he talks about his subsequent succession of [[sexual partner]]s,<ref name=Talk/> some of whom were ''Star Trek'' actresses.<ref name=Mirror/> He also talks about the death of his father, Joseph Shatner,<ref name=Edmonton/> and of his third wife, [[Nerine Kidd]], who accidentally drowned in a pool<ref name=Province/> in 1999<ref name=Record>{{Cite news|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|title=Jim Beam Me Up Scotty: Spock Tells of Booze Battle|date=October 31, 2001|page=20}}</ref> after struggling with alcoholism.<ref name=Video>{{Cite news|work=Video Business|title=Hailing Frequencies are Open|author=Lerman, Laurence|volume=21|issue=42|date=October 15, 2001|page=18}}</ref> Shatner recalls that Nimoy had expressed concern about Kidd's alcoholism and warned Shatner about marrying her.<ref name=Record/> Shatner says that he is conscious of his own mortality. Another topic is Nimoy's [[fine-art photography]], which deals with spirituality and sensuality. Both Shatner and Nimoy say that, while they are glad that ''Star Trek'' became a successful franchise, they wish that their subsequent fame hadn't encroached on their privacy.<ref name=Province/> They also discuss their discontent with having been [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a result of their roles in ''Star Trek'', and some of the repercussions this had on their acting careers.<ref name=Guardian/> Shatner recounts his initial surprise that, at [[science fiction convention]]s, the fans seem to like each other more than they like the science fiction actors.<ref name=Province/> The initial setting of the film is Nimoy's backyard, where they sit on patio chairs<ref name=Buckman/> before moving into Nimoy's library, which is filled with souvenirs.<ref name=Dawson79/> The entire runtime of the film is taken up by Shatner's and Nimoy's conversation.<ref name=Province/> The film concludes with Nimoy putting his arm around Shatner's shoulder and saying, "You're my best friend."<ref name=Buckman/>

The following night,<ref name=Dawson80/> when Shatner appeared on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' in another effort to promote ''Iron Chef USA'', [[Conan O'Brien]] raised the issue of the supposed flatulence in ''Mind Meld''. Shatner said that it was "outrageous" that Buckman would assume that Shatner was the source of the flatulation rather than Nimoy, and O'Brien responded, "You're the captain! You outrank him! It's your responsibility!" When O'Brien pressed Shatner further about the origin of the sound, Shatner suggested that it may have been a dog bark or a bird vocalization.<ref name=York/> His website declared the sounds to be squeaks produced by a [[Jib (camera)|jib]] operated by [[film crew]] member Greg Acosta.<ref name=Talk/> Jaysen said that Shatner was not to blame for the sound, and that the likeliest cause was cables rubbing against each other during a camera move.<ref name=New/>

Sarah Sloboda of [[The New York Times]] wrote that ''Mind Meld'' "provides a genuine glimpse of the lives of the stars shadowed by the roles that defined their public personas, and the mutual experience that binds them as friends."<ref name=Times/> G. Noel Gross of [[DVD Talk]] praised the [[video quality]], but criticized the DVD functionality and features. He also wrote that "even in the heavier parts of this conversation, there's a warmth and comradery there that's rife with good humor."<ref name=Talk/> Scott Brown of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an F, saying that the only people likely to watch the film other than extreme ''Star Trek'' fans are people who heard that the film includes the sound of Shatner flatulating, which Brown said can be clearly heard. He called the film "seemingly interminable" and said the discussion between Shatner and Nimoy shows that they "rival black holes in sheer self-absorption."<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Brown, Scott|title=Space Oddity|date=November 9, 2001|issue=624|page=88}}</ref> Vern Perry of the ''[[Orange County Register]]'' called the film fascinating because of its combination of humor and seriousness, and wrote that the only reason that Shatner's ego did not overwhelm the film is that both Shatner and Nimoy were willing to speak vulnerably about their personal lives. Perry said that the most moving portion of the film is Nimoy's discussion of his struggle with alcoholism.<ref name=Orange>{{Cite news|work=[[Orange County Register]]|author=Perry, Vern|page=E8|date=April 27, 2002|title=Japan's 'Rashomon' a Classic}}</ref> Greg Stacy of ''[[OC Weekly]]'' wrote that he was "thoroughly charmed" by the film and that "the affection between [Shatner and Nimoy] is obvious and touching."<ref name=Weekly/>

Laurence Lerman of ''Video Business'' praised the film for not "rehash[ing] anecdotes that have long been staples of Star Trek conventions and behind-the-scenes memoirs," but instead dealing with such topics as alcoholism, career difficulties, and conflicts on the set of ''Star Trek''.<ref name=Video/> Mike Clark of ''[[USA Today]]'' praised Shatner's interviewing abilities and wrote that the film was engaging. Clark called Shatner's and Nimoy's conversation "surprisingly frank", but added that Shatner was "full of himself".<ref name=Today>{{Cite news|work=[[USA Today]]|title=Home Movies|author=Clark, Mike|date=November 16, 2001|page=6E}}</ref> Writer Jim Dawson devoted an entire chapter of his book ''Blame It on the Dog: A Modern History of the Fart'' to what he argues to be Shatner's failed attempt to flatulate discreetly in the film. Dawson jokes that the sound was like that of someone stepping on a [[tribble]].<ref name=Dawson79/> Gross compared the excitement over Shatner's alleged flatulence to that evinced by adolescents watching ''[[Girls Gone Wild (franchise)|Girls Gone Wild]]'', and suggested that the level of scrutiny that has been devoted to the scene is similar to that received by the scene of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] in the [[Zapruder film]].<ref name=Talk/> A review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' summarized ''Mind Meld'' as "a couple of gents sitting around talking".<ref name=Guardian>{{Cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Still on Warp Speed After All These Years|date=November 23, 2001|page=C12}}</ref> John Henzell of ''[[The Press]]'' called the trailer for ''Mind Meld'' hilarious because of its seriousness.<ref name=Press/>
