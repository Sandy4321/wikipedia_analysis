The Auckland urban area (as defined by [[Statistics New Zealand]]) ranges to [[Waiwera]] in the north, [[Kumeu]] in the northwest, and Runciman in the south. It is not contiguous; the section from Waiwera to [[Whangaparaoa Peninsula]] is separate from its nearest neighbouring suburb of [[Long Bay, New Zealand|Long Bay]]. Auckland lies between the [[Hauraki Gulf]] of the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the east, the low [[Hunua Ranges]] to the south-east, the [[Manukau Harbour]] to the south-west, and the [[Waitakere Ranges]] and smaller ranges to the west and north-west. The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow [[List of isthmuses|isthmus]] between the Manukau Harbour on the [[Tasman Sea]] and the [[Waitemata Harbour]] on the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is one of the few cities in the world to have two harbours on two separate major bodies of water.

The 2011 [[Mercer Quality of Living Survey]] ranked Auckland 3rd place in the world on its list,<ref>http://www.mercer.com/qualityoflivingpr#city-rankings | "Mercer Quality of Living Survey - Worldwide Rankings, 2011"</ref> while the ''[[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist's]]'' [[World's most livable cities]] index of 2011 ranked Auckland in 9th place.
In 2010, Auckland was classified as a [[Global city|Beta World City]] in the World Cities Study Group<U+2019>s inventory by [[Loughborough University]].<ref>http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html | "The World According to GaWC 2008"</ref>

==History==
:''Main article [[History of Auckland]]''
[[File:Lower Queen Street.jpg|thumb|Lower Queen Street in 1919]]

===Early M<U+0101>ori and Europeans===
The isthmus was settled by [[M<U+0101>ori people|M<U+0101>ori]] around 1350 and was valued for its rich and fertile land. Many ''[[P<U+0101> (M<U+0101>ori)|p<U+0101>]]'' (fortified villages) were created, mainly on the volcanic peaks. M<U+0101>ori population in the area is estimated at about 20,000 people before the arrival of Europeans.<ref>{{Cite book|title= New Zealand|author=[[Ferdinand von Hochstetter]]|year=1867|page=243 |url=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document/1867_-_von_Hochstetter%2C_Ferdinand._New_Zealand/CHAPTER_XI%3A_The_Isthmus_of_Auckland}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkeologi.uu.se/afr/projects/BOOK/Bulmer/bulmer.pdf|title=''City without a state?

As a result, the region had relatively low numbers of M<U+0101>ori when European settlement of New Zealand began. There is, however, nothing to suggest that this was the result of a deliberate European policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/NgatiWhatua/3/en|title=Ng<U+0101>ti Wh<U+0101>tua - European contact|work=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=3 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Penguin History of New Zealand|author=[[Michael King]]|isbn=0-14-301867-1|year=2003|page=135|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Auckland, N.Z.}}</ref> On 27 January 1832, Joseph Brooks Weller, eldest of the [[Weller brothers]] of [[Otago]] and [[Sydney]] bought land including the sites of the modern cities of Auckland and North Shore and part of Rodney District, for "one large cask of powder" from "Cohi Rangatira".<ref>George Weller<U+2019>s Claim to lands in the Hauraki Gulf - transcript of original in National Archives, ms-0439/03 (A-H) HC.</ref>

After the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in February 1840, the new Governor of New Zealand, [[William Hobson]], chose the area as his new capital, and named it after [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|George Eden, Earl of Auckland]], then [[Viceroy of India]].<ref name="DOING">''[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFD6123BF936A15752C1A966958260&scp=31&sq=auckland&st=nyt What's Doing In; Auckland]'' - ''[[The New York Times]]'', 25 November 1990</ref> The land that Auckland was established on was given to the Governor by local Maori [[iwi]] [[Ng<U+0101>ti Wh<U+0101>tua]], as a sign of goodwill and in the hope that the building of a city would attract commercial and political opportunities for the iwi. Auckland was officially declared New Zealand's capital in 1841,<ref>{{Cite book |title=From Tamaki-Makau-Rau to Auckland |author=[[Russell Stone]] |publisher=University of Auckland Press |year=2002 |ISBN=1-86940-259-6}}</ref> and the transfer of the administration from Russell (now [[Okiato|Old Russell]]) in the Bay of Islands was completed in 1842. However, even in 1840 [[Port Nicholson]] (later [[Wellington]]) was seen as a better choice for an administrative capital because of its proximity to the [[South Island]] and Wellington became the capital in 1865. After losing its status as capital, Auckland remained the principal city of the [[Auckland Province]] until the provincial system was abolished in 1876.

===Growth up to today===
[[File:Map of the Auckland urban area, 2009, cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The urbanised extent of Auckland (red), as of 2009]]

In response to the ongoing rebellion by Hone Heke in the mid-1840s the government encouraged retired but fit British soldiers and their families to migrate to Auckland to form a defense line around the port settlement as garrison soldiers. Amongst the first settlers were some [[Catholicism|Catholics]] and in 1841 they established [[St Peter's College, Auckland#The original schools|Auckland's first school]] of any sort which held its first class on 27 September 1841.<ref>A. G Butchers, ''Young New Zealand'', Coulls Somerville Wilkie Ltd, Dunedin, 1929, pp. 124 - 126.</ref><ref>"Auckland's First Catholic School - And its Latest", ''Zealandia'', Thursday, 26 January 1939, p. 5</ref><ref>E.R. Simmons, ''In Cruce Salus, A History of the Diocese of Auckland 1848 - 1980'', Catholic Publication Centre, Auckland 1982, pp. 53 and 54.</ref> By the time the first Fencibles arrived in 1848, the rebels in the north had been defeated, so the outlying defensive towns were constructed to the south stretching in a line from the port village of Onehunga in the West, to Howick in the east. Each of the 4 settlements had about 800 settlers, the men being fully armed in case of emergency but spent nearly all their time breaking in the land and establishing roads. In the early 1860s, Auckland became a base against the [[M<U+0101>ori King Movement]]. This, and continued road building towards the south into the [[Waikato region|Waikato]], enabled [[P<U+0101>keh<U+0101>]] (European New Zealanders) influence to spread from Auckland. Its population grew fairly rapidly, from 1,500 in 1841 to 12,423 by 1864. The growth occurred similarly to other [[Commerce|mercantile]]-dominated cities, mainly around the port and with problems of overcrowding and pollution. Auckland had a far greater population of ex soldiers than other settlements, many of whom were Irish. About 50% of the population was Irish which contrasted heavily with the majority English settlers in Wellington, Christchurch or New Plymouth. Most of the Irish, though not all, were from Protestant Ulster. The majority of settlers in the early period were assisted by receiving a cheap passage to NZ.

Trams and railway lines shaped Auckland's rapid expansion in the early first half of the 20th century, but soon afterward the dominance of the motor vehicle emerged and has not abated since; arterial roads and motorways have become both defining and geographically dividing features of the urban landscape. They also allowed further massive expansion that resulted in the growth of associated urban areas like the [[North Shore, New Zealand|North Shore]] (especially after the construction of the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]]), and [[Manukau City]] in the south. According to the 1961 census data, M<U+0101>ori and Pacific Islanders composed 5% of Auckland<U+2019>s population; Asians less than 1%.<ref>"[http://auckland.royalcommission.govt.nz/web/part2/2_auckland_now.html Auckland Now]". Royal Commission on Auckland Governance.</ref>

A large percentage of Auckland is dominated by a [[suburban]] style of building, giving the city a low [[population density]] characteristic of most [[New World|new world]] cities. However, due to a history of strong population growth and the city's location on a constrained isthmus, Auckland has among the highest population density of any urban area in [[Australasia]].

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Rangitoto from Achilles Point.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rangitoto Island]] (in the background) from [[Achilles Point]]]]

===Volcanoes===
Auckland straddles the [[Auckland volcanic field]], which has produced about 50 volcanoes. These take the form of cones, lakes, lagoons, islands and depressions, and several have produced extensive lava flows. Some of the cones have been partly or completely [[quarry|quarried]] away. The individual volcanoes are all considered extinct, although the volcanic field itself is merely [[dormant volcano|dormant]]. Auckland has at least 14 large lava tube caves which run from the volcanoes down towards the sea.

Auckland's volcanoes are fuelled entirely by [[basalt]]ic [[magma]], unlike the explosive [[subduction]]-driven [[volcanism]] in the central North Island, such as at [[Mount Ruapehu]] and [[Lake Taupo]].<ref name="Smith and Allen">Ian E.M. Smith and Sharon R. Allen. ''[http://gns.cri.nz/Home/Learning/Science-Topics/Volcanoes/New-Zealand-Volcanoes/Volcano-Geology-and-Hazards/Auckland-Volcanic-Field-Geology Auckland volcanic field geology]''. Volcanic Hazards Working Group, Civil Defence Scientific Advisory Committee. Retrieved 30 March 2013. Also published in print as ''Volcanic hazards at the Auckland volcanic field''. 1993.</ref> The most recent and by far the largest volcano, [[Rangitoto Island]], was formed within the last 1000 years, and its eruptions destroyed the M<U+0101>ori settlements on neighbouring [[Motutapu Island]] some 700 years ago. Rangitoto's size, its symmetry, its position guarding the entrance to [[Waitemata Harbour]] and its visibility from many parts of the Auckland region make it Auckland's most iconic natural feature. Few birds and insects inhabit the island because of the rich acidic soil and the type of flora growing out of the rocky soil.

[[File:Auckland20061016222837.jpg|thumb|right|Auckland and the inner [[Hauraki Gulf]] from space]]

===Harbours, gulf and rivers===
Auckland lies on and around an [[isthmus]], less than two kilometres wide at its narrowest point, between [[Mangere Inlet]] and the [[Tamaki River]]. There are two harbours in the Auckland urban area surrounding this isthmus: [[Waitemata Harbour]] to the north, which opens east to the [[Hauraki Gulf]], and [[Manukau Harbour]] to the south, which opens west to the [[Tasman Sea]]. The total coastline of Auckland is 3,702&nbsp;km in length.<ref name=DRAFTLTP2012Page12>{{cite book|title=Draft Long-term Plan 2012-2022|author=Auckland Council|page=13|year=2012}}</ref>

Bridges span parts of both harbours, notably the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] crossing the Waitemata Harbour west of the [[Auckland CBD|Auckland Central Business District]] (CBD). The [[Mangere Bridge (bridges)|Mangere Bridge]] and the [[Upper Harbour Bridge]] span the upper reaches of the Manukau and Waitemata Harbours, respectively. In earlier times, [[portage]] paths crossed the narrowest sections of the isthmus.

Several islands of the [[Hauraki Gulf]] are administered as part of Auckland, though they are not part of the Auckland metropolitan area. Parts of [[Waiheke Island]] effectively function as [[Suburbs of Auckland|Auckland suburbs]], while various smaller islands near Auckland are mostly zoned 'recreational open space' or are nature sanctuaries.

Auckland also has a total length of approximately 21,000&nbsp;km of rivers and streams, about 8% of these in urban areas.<ref name=DRAFTLTP2012Page12/>

===Climate===
[[File:Auckland cbd view.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Auckland CBD]]]]
Auckland has a [[temperate climate]], with warm, humid summers and mild, damp winters. Under [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification|K<U+00F6>ppen's climate classification]], the city has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb&#x202f;''). It is the warmest main centre of New Zealand and is also one of the sunniest, with an average of 2060 sunshine hours per annum.<ref name="NIWA">{{cite web|url=http://www.niwa.co.nz/education-and-training/schools/resources/climate|title=Climate Summary for 1971-2000|publisher=[[National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research]]}}</ref> The average daily maximum temperature is 23.7 [[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] (74.7<U+00B0>F) in February and 14.5<U+00B0>C (58.1<U+00B0>F) in July.

The early morning calm on the isthmus during settled weather, before the sea breeze rises, was described as early as 1853: "In all seasons, the beauty of the day is in the early morning. At that time, generally, a solemn stillness holds, and a perfect calm prevails...".<ref name=1853_morning>''Auckland, the Capital of New Zealand'' - [[William Swainson (lawyer)|Swainson, William]], Smith Elder, 1853</ref> Many Aucklanders use this time of day to walk and run in parks.

Auckland occasionally suffers from [[air pollution]] due to [[Atmospheric particulate matter|fine particle]] emissions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.govt.nz/albany/index.cfm?6901EAA9-14C2-3D2D-B939-BF1991A4D1E7|title=Air pollutants - Fine particles (PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>)|publisher=[[Auckland Regional Council]]|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> There are also occasional breaches of guideline levels of [[carbon monoxide]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.govt.nz/environment/air-quality/air-pollutants/carbon-monoxide.cfm|title=Air pollutants - Carbon monoxide (CO)|publisher=[[Auckland Regional Council]]|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> While maritime winds normally disperse the pollution relatively quickly it can sometimes become visible as [[smog]], especially on calm winter days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.govt.nz/environment/air-quality/aucklands-air-quality/aucklands-air-quality_home.cfm|title=Auckland's air quality|publisher=[[Auckland Regional Council]]|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> Precipitation is relatively abundant all year round, but is higher in winter.

Auckland is home to many cultures. The majority of inhabitants claim [[New Zealand European|European]] - predominantly [[British people|British]] and/or [[Irish people|Irish]] - descent, but substantial [[M<U+0101>ori people|M<U+0101>ori]], [[Pacific Islander]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] communities exist as well. Auckland has the largest [[Polynesia]]n population of any city in the world and a higher proportion of people of Asian origin than the rest of New Zealand. Ethnic groups from all corners of the world have a presence in Auckland, making it by far the country's most [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] city.

===Demographics===
{{Main|Demographics of Auckland}}
At the time of the 2006 Census, Auckland had 32.4% of New Zealand's population.<ref name=DRAFTLTP2012Page12/> The proportion of Asians and other Non-European immigrants has increased during the last decades due to immigration,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/7F0D2AFF-54F4-4CE9-BE7C-974597403FCB/0/Auckland.pdf|format=PDF|title=New Zealand - A Regional Profile - Auckland|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|accessdate=3 October 2007|year=1999|pages=19<U+2013>20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071025142501/http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/7F0D2AFF-54F4-4CE9-BE7C-974597403FCB/0/Auckland.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 25 October 2007}}</ref> and the [[Immigration to New Zealand|removal of restrictions directly or indirectly based on race]]. Immigration to New Zealand is heavily concentrated towards Auckland (partly for job market reasons). This strong focus on Auckland has led the immigration services to award extra points towards immigration visa requirements for people intending to move to other parts of New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/4DAD508D-CC26-425A-A57B-D2AF557C8510/0/1003.pdf Residence in New Zealand] ([[PDF]]) (Page 8, from the [[Immigration New Zealand]] website. Retrieved 20 May 2011.)</ref>

The following table shows the ethnic profile of Auckland's population, as recorded in the 2001 and 2006 [[New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings|New Zealand Census]]. The percentages add up to more than 100%, as some people counted themselves as belonging to more than one ethnic group. Figures for 2006 refer to the whole Auckland Region, not just the urban area. The substantial percentage drop of 'Europeans' was mainly caused by the increasing numbers of people from this group choosing to define themselves as 'New Zealanders' - even though this was not one of the groups listed on the census form.

The 2006 Census also provides information about the [[multilingual]]ity of the region. 867,825 people in the Auckland Region spoke one language only, 274,863 spoke two, and 57,051 three or more.<ref name="2006 Census"/>

===Religion===
[[File:St Mark's Anglican Church.jpg|thumb|[[Anglican]] church in [[Remuera]]]]
Similar to the rest of the country, over half of Aucklanders profess [[Christianity]], but fewer than 10% regularly attend church and almost 40% profess no religious affiliation (2006 census figures). The main denominations are [[Roman Catholic]], [[Anglican]] and [[Presbyterian]]. [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] and [[charismatic Movement|charismatic]] churches are the fastest growing. A small community of [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Christians]] is also present.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/Africans/2/ENZ-Resources/Standard/4/en Pope Shenouda III visits New Zealand] (from [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]].

Recent immigration from Asia has added to the religious diversity of the city, and about 10% of the population follow such beliefs as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]] and [[Sikhism]], although there are no figures on religious attendance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/D5B067F9-7A06-483D-A6B9-D438E81ABAC2/0/AucklandCity.pdf|title=What we look like locally|page=7|publisher=Statistics New Zealand}}</ref> There is also a small, long-established [[Judaism|Jewish]] community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahc.org.nz/intro.php|title=Auckland Hebrew Community ~ Introduction page|accessdate=18 September 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080526162039/http://www.ahc.org.nz/intro.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 26 May 2008}}</ref>

==Lifestyle==
[[File:Vulcan Lane, Auckland, 2012.jpg|thumb|Pedestrians on Vulcan Lane]]
Auckland's lifestyle is influenced by the fact that while it is 70% rural in land area, 90% of Aucklanders live in urban areas<ref name=HISTORYMAKING>{{cite news|title=Auckland Council - History In The Making|date=March 2011|accessdate=30 August 2011|newspaper=Our Auckland|agency=Auckland Council|page=5}}</ref> - though large parts of these areas have a more [[suburban]] character than many cities in Europe and Asia.

Positive aspects of Auckland life are its mild climate, plentiful employment and educational opportunities, as well as numerous leisure facilities. Meanwhile, traffic problems, the lack of good public transport, and increasing housing costs have been cited by many Aucklanders as among the strongest negative factors of living there,<ref name=criticisms>[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/transport/ctc/theproject.asp Central Transit Corridor Project] ([[Auckland City]] website, includes mention of effects of transport on public satisfaction)</ref> together with crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/introduction/safer/crimesafety/police.asp|title=Crime and safety profile - 2003|publisher=[[Auckland City Council]]|accessdate=8 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070626092351/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/introduction/safer/crimesafety/police.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 26 June 2007}}</ref> Nonetheless, Auckland ranks 4th in a survey of the [[Mercer Quality of Living Survey|quality of life]] of 215 major cities of the world (2009 data).<ref>[http://www.citymayors.com/features/quality_survey.html City Mayors: Best cities in the world (Mercer)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=top_cities>[http://www.mercer.com/referencecontent.htm?idContent=1173105 Quality of Living global city rankings 2009] ([[Mercer Management Consulting]].

In 2011, Auckland is ranked by the [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] consulting firm as 149 of 214 centres for affordability, i.e. making it one of the most affordable cities world-wide to live in, with living expense of $20000 per year., based on the comparative cost of 200 aspects of life including housing, transport, food, clothing, household goods.<ref name="AFFORD">{{cite news|title=Auckland, Wellington, among 'best value' cities in the world|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10655269|accessdate=9 July 2010|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=29 June 2010|first=Susie|last=Nordqvist}}</ref>

===Leisure===
[[File:Takapuna, North Shore City, Auckland, New Zealand.jpg|right|thumb|[[Takapuna]] Beach located in [[North Shore City]]]]

One of Auckland's nicknames, the "City of Sails", is derived from the popularity of sailing in the region. 135,000 [[yacht]]s and [[Launch (boat)|launches]] are registered in Auckland, and around 60,500 of the country's 149,900 registered yachtsmen are from Auckland,<ref>''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10405832 Punters love City of Sails]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Saturday 14 October 2006</ref><ref name="Heraldyacht"/> with about one in three Auckland households owning a boat.<ref name="LIVINGGULF">{{cite news|page=4|title=The Hauraki Gulf Marine Park, Part 2|newspaper=Inset to [[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=2 March 2010}}</ref> The [[Viaduct Basin]], on the western edge of the CBD, hosted two [[America's Cup]] challenges ([[2000 America's Cup|2000 Cup]] and [[2003 America's Cup|2003 Cup]]).

The west coast has popular surf spots such as [[Piha]], [[Muriwai]] and [[Bethells Beach]]. The [[Whangaparaoa Peninsula]], [[Orewa]], [[Omaha, New Zealand|Omaha]] and [[Pakiri]], to the north of the main urban area, are also popular . Many Auckland beaches are patrolled by [[surf lifesaving]] clubs, which are part of the [[Surf Life Saving Northern Region]].

[[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]], [[Britomart Transport Centre|Britomart]], [[Ponsonby, New Zealand|Ponsonby Road]], [[Karangahape Road]], [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]] and [[Parnell, New Zealand|Parnell]] are popular retail areas, whilst the [[Otara]] and [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]] [[fleamarket]]s offer an alternative shopping experience on weekend mornings. Most [[shopping malls]] are located in the middle- and outer-suburbs, with [[Sylvia Park]] and [[Westfield Albany]] being the largest.

===Arts and Culture===
[[File:Auckland Art Gallery - Extension.jpg|thumb|The modern section of the [[Auckland Art Gallery]], completed in 2011]]

A number of arts events are held in Auckland, including the [[Auckland Festival]], the Auckland Triennial, the [[New Zealand International Comedy Festival]], and the [[New Zealand International Film Festival]]. The [[Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra]] is the city and region's resident full-time symphony orchestra, performing its own series of concerts and accompanying opera and ballet. Events celebrating the city's cultural diversity include the [[Pasifika Festival]], Polyfest, and the [[Lantern Festival|Auckland Lantern Festival]], all of which are the largest of their kind in New Zealand. Additionally, Auckland regularly hosts the [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Royal New Zealand Ballet]].

Important institutions include the [[Auckland Art Gallery]], [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]], [[Voyager New Zealand Maritime Museum]], [[Torpedo Bay Navy Museum|National Museum of the Royal New Zealand Navy]], and the [[Museum of Transport and Technology]]/. The Auckland Art Gallery is considered the home of the visual arts in New Zealand with a collection of over 15,000 artworks, including prominent New Zealand and Pacific Island artists, as well as international painting, sculpture and print collections ranging in date from 1376 to the present day. In 2009 the Gallery was promised a gift <ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.aucklandartgallery.com/the-collection/collections-bequests-and-donations/julian-and-josie-robertson-collection |title=Julian and Josie Robertson Collection |publisher=Auckland Art Gallery |date= |accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> of fifteen works of art by New York art collectors and philanthropists Julian and Josie Robertson &mdash; including well-known paintings by Paul C<U+00E9>zanne, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Paul Gauguin and Piet Mondrian. This is the largest gift ever made to an art museum in Australasia.

===Parks and nature===
[[File:Albert Park, Auckland, NZ.jpg|thumb|right|[[Albert Park, Auckland]], located in downtown Auckland]]
[[File:View of Aukland from outside city.JPG|thumb|right|View from the top of [[Mount Eden]]/''Maungawhau'']]

[[Auckland Domain]] is one of the largest parks in the city, close to the [[Auckland CBD]] and having a good view of the [[Hauraki Gulf]] and [[Rangitoto Island]]. Smaller parks close to the city centre are [[Albert Park, Auckland|Albert Park]], [[Myers Park, Auckland|Myers Park]], [[Western Park, Auckland|Western Park]] and [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]].

While most volcanic cones in the [[Auckland volcanic field]] have been affected by quarrying, many of the remaining cones are now within parks, and retain a more natural character than the surrounding city. Prehistoric earthworks and historic fortifications are in several of these parks, including [[Mount Eden]], [[North Head, New Zealand|North Head]] and [[One Tree Hill, New Zealand|One Tree Hill]] (Maungakiekie).

Other parks around the city are in [[Western Springs]], which has a large park bordering the [[MOTAT]] museum and the [[Auckland Zoo]]. The [[Auckland Botanic Gardens]] are further south, in [[Manurewa]].

Ferries provide transport to parks and nature reserves at [[Devonport, New Zealand|Devonport]], [[Waiheke Island]], [[Rangitoto Island]] and [[Tiritiri Matangi]]. The [[Waitakere Ranges]] Regional Park to the west of Auckland offers beautiful and relatively unspoiled [[The Bush#New Zealand|bush]] territory, as do the [[Hunua Ranges]] to the south.

===Sport===
;Locations

Annual sporting events include:
* The [[Heineken Open (tennis)|Heineken Open]] and [[ASB Classic]] men's and women's Tennis events, held annually in January.
* The [[Auckland Marathon]] (and half-marathon), an annual marathon which draws thousands of competitors.

It is New Zealand's largest ocean swim.<ref>[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/whatson/events/harbour/default.asp Harbour Crossing] (from the [[Auckland City Council]] website. Retrieved 24 October 2007.)</ref>
* The 'Round the Bays' [[road running|fun-run]], starting in the city and going {{convert|8.4|km|mi}} along the waterfront to the suburb of [[Saint Heliers|St Heliers]].

==Economy==
{{Wide image|AucklandPano MC.jpg|1280px|Auckland skyline (CBD)}}

[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|[[Britomart Transport Centre]] looking northeast]]

Most major international corporations have an Auckland office, as the city is the economic capital of the nation. The most expensive office space is around lower [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]] and the [[Viaduct Basin]] in the [[Auckland CBD]], where many financial and business services are located, which make up a large percentage of the CBD economy.<ref name="GLANCE">[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/glance.asp Auckland's CBD at a glance] (CBD website of the [[Auckland City Council]])</ref> A large proportion of the technical and trades workforce is based in the industrial zones of [[South Auckland]].

The largest commercial and industrial areas of Greater Auckland are in the southeast of Auckland City and the western parts of Manukau City, mostly bordering the [[Manukau Harbour]] and the [[Tamaki River]] estuary.

The sub-national GDP of the Auckland region was estimated at US$47.6 billion in 2003, 36% of New Zealand's national GDP, 15% greater than the entire South Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/reports/analytical-reports/regional-gross-domestic-product.aspx|title=Regional Gross Domestic Product|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|year=2007|accessdate=18 February 2010}}</ref>

Auckland's status as the largest commercial centre of the country reflects in the high median personal income (per working person, per year) which was [[NZ$]]44,304 (approx. [[US$]]33,000) for the region in 2005, with jobs in the Auckland CBD often earning more.<ref name="income1">[http://www.labourmarket.co.nz/regionalprofile_ak.htm Auckland Regional Profile] (from labourmarket.co.nz, composed from various sources)</ref> The median personal income (for all persons older than 15 years of age, per year) was NZ$22,300 (2001),<ref name="income2">[http://www.emigratenz.org/nz-cities-compared.html Comparison of New Zealand's cities] (from ENZ emigration consulting)</ref> behind only [[North Shore City]] (also part of the Greater Auckland area) and [[Wellington]]. While office workers still account for a large part of Auckland's commuters, large office developments in other parts of the city, for example in [[Takapuna]] or [[Albany, New Zealand|Albany]], both on the North Shore, are slowly becoming more common, reducing concentration on the Auckland CBD somewhat.

==Education==

===Primary and Secondary===
{{see also|List of schools in the Auckland Region}}

The Auckland urban area has 340 primary schools, 80 secondary schools, and 29 composite (primary/secondary combined) schools as of February 2012, catering for nearly quarter of a million students. The majority are state schools, but 63 schools are state-integrated and 39 are private.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/__data/assets/excel_doc/0004/62572/Directory-Schools-Current.xls |title= Directory of Schools - as at 01 February 2012 |publisher= Ministry of Education New Zealand |accessdate= 7 March 2011}}</ref>

The city is home to some of the largest schools in New Zealand, including [[Rangitoto College]] in the East Coast Bays area, the largest school in New Zealand with just over 3000 students.

===Tertiary===
[[File:University of Auckland Clock Tower.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[University of Auckland]] clock tower building is a 'Category I' historic place, completed in 1926.<ref>[http://www.historic.org.nz/aboutus/AucklandBranch/auckland_places2visit_city.html#27 Heritage Sites to Visit: Auckland City]. [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust]]. Retrieved 6 November 2008.</ref>]]
Auckland has a number of important educational institutions, including some of the largest universities in the country. Auckland is a major centre of overseas language education, with large numbers of foreign students (particularly East Asians) coming to the city for several months or years to learn English or study at universities - although numbers New Zealand-wide have dropped substantially since peaking in 2003.<ref>[http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/4c2567ef00247c6a4c2567be0008d2f8/4c2567ef00247c6acc2571b900127ca3?OpenDocument Survey of English Language Providers - Year ended March 2006] (from [[Statistics New Zealand]]. Auckland is assumed to follow national pattern)</ref> As of 2007, there are around 50 [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority]] (NZQA) certified schools and institutes teaching English in the Auckland area.<ref>[http://www.englishnewzealand.ac.nz/All%20Schools/AUCKLAND.html English Language Schools in New Zealand - Auckland] (list linked from the [[Immigration New Zealand]] website)</ref>

Amongst the more important tertiary educational institutes are the [[University of Auckland]], [[Auckland University of Technology]], [[Massey University]], [[Manukau Institute of Technology]] and [[Unitec New Zealand]].

==Housing==
Housing varies considerably between some suburbs having [[state housing|state owned housing]] in the lower income neighbourhoods, to palatial waterfront estates, especially on the Waitemata. Traditionally, the most common residence of Aucklanders was a bungalow on a '[[quarter acre]]' (1,000 m<U+00B2>).<ref name="ARCGRO"/> However, subdividing such properties with 'infill housing', has long been the norm. Aucklanders' housing preferences resulting from a lack of apartments and poor public transport has resulted in a large [[urban sprawl]] and reliance on motor vehicles. This will probably continue, as the vast majority of Aucklanders live in low-density housing, which is expected to remain at up to 70% of the total share even in 2050.<ref name="ARCGRO"/>

In some areas, the Victorian [[villa]]s are being increasingly torn down to make way for large mansions with tennis courts and swimming pools. The demolition of the older properties is being combated by the Auckland City Council passing laws that cover heritage suburbs or streets. Auckland has been described as having 'the most extensive range of timbered housing with its classical details and mouldings in the world', many of them Victorian-Edwardian style houses.<ref>[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/documents/district/Part07a.pdf Section 7.6.1.2 - Strategy] ([[PDF]]) (from the [[Auckland City Council]] District Plan - Isthmus Section)</ref>

==Government==

===Local===
{{See also|Auckland Region|Auckland Council}}
[[File:Aucklandtownhallnight.jpg|thumb|[[Auckland Town Hall]]]]
The [[Auckland Council]] is the [[Regions of New Zealand|local authority]] with jurisdiction over the city of Auckland, along with surrounding rural areas, parkland, and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf.

From 1989 to 2010 Auckland was governed by several separate city and district councils. In the late 2000s (decade), New Zealand's central government and parts of Auckland's society felt that this large number of councils, and the lack of strong regional government (with the [[Auckland Regional Council]] having only limited powers) were hindering Auckland's progress. A [[Royal Commission on Auckland Governance]] was set up in 2007,<ref>''[http://www.stuff.co.nz/0a11.html4147429a11.html Auckland governance inquiry welcomed]'' - [[NZPA]], via 'stuff.co.nz', Tuesday 31 July 2007.

Retrieved 29 October 2007</ref> and in 2009 recommended a unified local governance structure for Auckland, amalgamating the councils.<ref>''[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0903/S00405.htm Minister Releases Report Of Royal Commission]'' - ''[[Scoop.co.nz]]'', Friday 27 March 2009</ref> Government subsequently announced that a "super city" would be set up with a single mayor by the time of New Zealand's local body elections in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10565528|title='Super city' to be in place next year, Maori seats axed|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|first=Edward|last=Gay|date=7 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://media.nzherald.co.nz/webcontent/document/pdf/Making%20Ak%20Greater%20final%20media.pdf|title=Making Auckland Greater|format=PDF|date=7 April 2009|work=The New Zealand Herald}}</ref>
Many aspects of the reorganisation [[Auckland Council#Establishment|were or are still controversial]], from matters such as the form of representation for Maori, the inclusion or exclusion of rural council areas in the city, to the role of [[council-controlled organisation]]s that are intended to place much of the day to day business of council services at arms length from the elected Council.

In October 2010, [[Manukau City]] mayor [[Len Brown]] was elected the mayor of the amalgamated [[Auckland Council]].

Between 1842 and 1865, Auckland was the capital city of New Zealand. Parliament met in what is now [[Old Government House, Auckland|Old Government House]] on the [[University of Auckland]]'s City campus. The capital was moved to the more centrally located [[Wellington]] in 1865.

Auckland, because of its large population, is covered by 21 general electorates and three Maori electorates, each returning one member to the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]]. In addition, there are a varying number of Auckland-based List MPs, who are elected via party lists. As of 2012, there are twelve list MPs in the House who contested Auckland-based electorates at the {{NZ election link|2011}}.

Bus services in Auckland are mostly radial, with few [[Beltway|ring]]-routes, due to Auckland being on an [[isthmus]]. Late-night services (i.e. past midnight) are limited, even on weekends.

Regular trains operating along four lines travel between the CBD and the west, south and south-east of Auckland, with longer-distance options scarce. In 2007 approximately NZ$5.3 billion worth of large-scale projects were underway or planned (and budgeted for) in the Auckland area to improve rail and public transport patronage over the next decade, 31% of the transport budget.<ref name="WIKI">References provided in [[Transport in Auckland]] and [[Public transport in Auckland]]</ref><ref>[http://www.arta.co.nz/xxarta/news/media_releasexx.cfm?entryID=B202280C-BCD4-1A24-99B5-C64E69961830 Auckland Transport Plan landmark for transport sector] (from the [[Auckland Regional Transport Authority]] website, 11 August 2007)</ref> However, policy changes in early 2009 by the incoming National government have meant a shift in emphasis to more highway construction, and have removed the provision of a regional fuel tax that was to pay for [[Auckland Regional Transport Authority|ARTA's]] public transport upgrades.<ref>''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10562220 Hopes of electric trains for cup fade]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Wednesday 18 March 2009</ref> While the government has promised to fund the [[Auckland railway electrification|rail electrification]], the process and associated tenders were delayed by approximately one year, and some rail station upgrades and the funding of the [[integrated ticketing]] upgrade were in doubt.

;Other modes
[[Ports of Auckland|Auckland's ports]] are the second largest of the country, behind the [[Port of Tauranga]],<ref>"http://www.taurikobusinessestate.co.nz/about_tauranga.php"</ref> and a large part of both inbound and outbound New Zealand commerce travels through them, mostly via the facilities northeast of Auckland CBD. Freight usually arrives at or is distributed from the port via road, though the port facilities also have rail access. Auckland is a major cruise ship stopover point, with the ships usually tying up at [[Princes Wharf]]. Auckland CBD is connected to coastal suburbs, to the North Shore and to outlying islands by ferry.

[[File:Auckland airport international terminal.jpg|thumb|left|The International Terminal at [[Auckland International Airport]]]]
;Air
Auckland has various small regional airports and [[Auckland Airport]], the busiest of the country. Auckland Airport, New Zealand's largest, is in the southern suburb of Mangere on the shores of the Manukau Harbour. There are frequent services to Australia, and to other New Zealand destinations. There are also direct connections to many locations in the South Pacific, to the United States, Asia and to Santiago in South America.<ref>Auckland Airport, http://www.aucklandairport.co.nz/</ref>

;Policies
Research at [[Griffith University]] has indicated that in the last 50 years, Auckland has engaged in some of the most pro-automobile transport policies anywhere in the world.<ref name="GRIFF">''[http://www.griffith.edu.au/centre/urp/urp_publications/Issues_Papers/URP_IP5_MeesDodsonAucklandTransport_April, 2006.pdf Backtracking Auckland: Bureaucratic rationality and public preferences in transport planning]'' - Mees, Paul; Dodson, Jago; Urban Research Program Issues Paper 5, [[Griffith University]], April 2006</ref> With public transport declining heavily during the second half of the 20th century (a trend mirrored in most Western countries such as the US),<ref>[http://www.publicpurpose.com/ut-usptshare45.htm US Urban Personal Vehicle & Public Transport Market Share from 1900] (from publicpurpose.com, a website of the [[Wendell Cox]] Consultancy)</ref> and increased spending on roads and cars, New Zealand (and specifically Auckland) now has the second-highest vehicle ownership rate in the world, with around 578 vehicles per 1000 people.<ref name=vehicle_ownership>[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/ Sustainable Transport] North Shore City Council website</ref> Auckland has also been called a very pedestrian- and cyclist-unfriendly city, though some efforts are being made to change this.<ref name="Big steps to change City of Cars">''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10539171 Big steps to change City of Cars]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Friday 24 October 2008</ref> At the same, high-profile gaps in the network, such as the inability for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the Waitemata Harbour, will probably remain for the foreseeable future, with councils generally not considering the costs involved as sensible expense.<ref>''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10530271 Cycleway for bridge could prove too pricey]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Wednesday 3 September 2008</ref>

===Infrastructure===
The [[New Zealand State Highway network|State Highway network]] connects the cities in the Auckland urban area through the Northern, Southern, Northwestern and Southwestern Motorways.

The [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] (Northern Motorway) is the main connection to the North Shore, and also a major traffic bottleneck. The Harbour Bridge does not provide access for rail, pedestrians or cyclists, which has repeatedly (most recently in 2008) led to campaigns for and investigations into retrofitting the structure.

The [[Central Motorway Junction]], also called 'Spaghetti Junction' for its complexity, is the intersection between the two major motorways of Auckland (State Highway 1 and State Highway 16).

Two of the longest arterial roads within Greater Auckland are [[Great North Road, New Zealand|Great North Road]] and [[Great South Road, New Zealand|Great South Road]] - the main connections in those directions before the construction of the State Highway network.

Auckland has three main railway lines, serving the general western, southern, and central eastern directions from the [[Britomart Transport Centre]] in downtown Auckland. It is the terminal station for all lines, and connects them to ferry and bus services.

==Electricity==
Auckland is New Zealand's largest electricity consumer, and uses around 20% of the country's total electricity each year. Vector, which operates the majority of Auckland's local distribution system, measured maximum demand to be 1722&nbsp;MW in 2011, with 8679&nbsp;GWh delivered.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vector.co.nz/sites/vector.co.nz/files/Vector%20-%20Electricity%20AMP.pdf |title= Electricity Asset Management Plan 2012 <U+2013> 2022 |publisher= Vector Limited |date= April 2012 |accessdate= 12 September 2012}}</ref>

There are two major electricity generation stations located within the city, both of which are [[natural gas]]-fired [[combined cycle]] [[gas turbine]] stations. [[Otahuhu Power Station|Otahuhu B]] is owned by [[Contact Energy]] and generates 380&nbsp;MW, while [[Southdown Power Station|Southdown]] is owned by [[Mighty River Power]] and generates 175&nbsp;MW.

Since there is not enough generation in Auckland to meet the demand, and there is very little generation north of Auckland, most of the electricity for Auckland and Northland must be transmitted from power stations in the south, mainly from [[Huntly Power Station]] and the [[Waikato River]] hydroelectric stations.

[[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]] owns the [[National Grid (New Zealand)|national grid]] and is responsible for the high voltage transmission lines into and across Auckland. As at March 2012, the existing grid has six major 220&nbsp;kV transmission circuits bringing power into Auckland from the south. These six circuits are carried on four main transmission lines, and all terminate at Otahuhu substation. A low capacity 110&nbsp;kV transmission line also brings power from the south, but makes only a minor contribution to meeting the demand.

The sub-transmission and distribution network in the Auckland region is mostly owned by [[Vector Limited|Vector]]. The network south of central Papakura is owned by Counties Power.

There have been several notable power outages in Auckland. The five-week long [[1998 Auckland power crisis]] blacked out much of the CBD after a cascade failure occurred on four underground cables in Mercury Energy's sub-transmission network. The [[2006 Auckland Blackout]] interrupted supply to the CBD and many inner suburbs after an earth wire shackle at Transpower's Otahuhu substation broke and short-circuited the lines supplying the inner city. In 2009, much of the northern and western suburbs, as well as all of Northland, experienced a blackout when a forklift accidentally came in contact with the only major line supplying the region.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/forklift-sparks-blackout-thousands-3102479 |title= Forklift sparks blackout for thousands - tvnz.co.nz |publisher= Television New Zealand |date= 30 October 2009 |accessdate= 25 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110615153906/http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/forklift-sparks-blackout-thousands-3102479| archivedate= 15 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

These outages have shown that the transmission and distribution systems are in need of enhancement. Transpower is currently spending $1.25 billion upgrading transmission into Auckland and Northland, to relieve supply constraints and to improve security. The largest single project is the [[Whakamaru to Brownhill Road transmission line]] being built from the south Waikato to a new switching station at Brownhill Road near Whitford in south-east Auckland. From Brownhill Road, underground cables operating at 220&nbsp;kV connect the new line to Pakuranga substation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gridnewzealand.co.nz/nigup-home |title= North Island Grid Upgrade - Grid New Zealand |publisher= Transpower New Zealand Limited |accessdate= 25 July 2011}}</ref> This project significantly increases transmission capacity into the Auckland region, and provides diversity by reducing the dependence on Otahuhu substation. A further 37&nbsp;km of 220&nbsp;kV underground cable is being installed as part of the [[North Auckland and Northland grid upgrade project]] from Pakuranga to Penrose, and then via the CBD across the Waitemata Harbour to Albany. This project creates an alternative transmission route to the north of Auckland.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gridnewzealand.co.nz/naan-home |title= North Auckland and Northland Grid Upgrade Project - Grid New Zealand |publisher= Transpower New Zealand Limited |accessdate= 25 July 2011}}</ref>

==Future growth==

[[File:StatNZ Population of Auckland Region projection.jpg|thumb|right|Projection of the Auckland Region's population growth to 2031.]]
Auckland is expecting substantial population growth via immigration and natural population increases (which contribute to growth at about one-third and two-thirds, respectively),<ref>[http://www.arc.govt.nz/arc/auckland-region/growth/can-we-stop-growth.cfm Can We Stop growth?] (from the [[Auckland Regional Council|ARC]] website)</ref> and is set to grow to an estimated 1.9 million inhabitants by 2031.<ref name="ARCGRO">[http://www.arc.govt.nz/albany/fms/main/Documents/Auckland/Aucklands%20growth/Auckland%20regional%20growth%20strategy.pdf Executive Summary] ([[PDF]]) (from the Auckland Regional Growth Strategy document, [[Auckland Regional Council|ARC]], November 1999. Retrieved 14 October 2007.)</ref><ref name="STATSNZPOP">[http://www.stats.govt.nz/Publications/PopulationStatistics/mapping-trends-in-the-auckland-region/population-change.aspx Mapping Trends in the Auckland Region] [[Statistics New Zealand]], 2010. Retrieved 2010)</ref> This substantial increase in population will have a major impact on transport, housing and other infrastructure that is in many cases already considered under pressure. It is also feared by some organisations, such as the [[Auckland Regional Council]], that [[urban sprawl]] will result from the growth and, as a result, that it is necessary to address this proactively in planning policy.

A 'Regional Growth Strategy' has been adopted that sees limits on further subdivision and intensification of existing use as its main [[sustainability]] measures.<ref>''[http://portal.jarbury.net/thesis.pdf From Urban Sprawl to Compact City: an analysis of Auckland's Urban Growth Management Strategies]'' - Arbury, Joshua - MA Thesis, University of Auckland</ref> This policy is contentious, as it naturally limits the uses of private land, especially the subdivision of urban fringe properties,<ref name="GREEN">''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=139&objectid=10436540 Green belt under siege]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Saturday 28 April 2007</ref> by setting 'Metropolitan Urban Limits' in planning documents like the [[District Plan]].<ref>[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/documents/growthstrategy/docs/Glossary.pdf Growth Strategy: Glossary and References] ([[PDF]]) (from the [[Auckland City Council]])</ref>

According to the 2006 Census projections, the medium-variant scenario shows that the population is projected to continue growing, to reach 1.93 million by 2031. The high-variant scenario shows the region's population growing to over two million by 2031.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Publications/PopulationStatistics/mapping-trends-in-the-auckland-region/population-change.aspx|title=Mapping Trends in the Auckland Region|work=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref>
