'''William Thomas Dartnell''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] ([[6 April]] [[1885]] &ndash; [[3 September]] [[1915]]) (enlisted as '''Wilbur Taylor Dartnell''') was an [[Australia]]n [[posthumous]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces. Dartnell was born in Melbourne, Australia. After marrying Elizabeth Smyth, he moved to South Africa, where he was living at the outbreak of World War One. He enlisted in the [[Royal Fusiliers]] and was shipped to [[British East Africa]]. On [[3 September]] [[1915]], whilst his company were being evacuated, stayed behind in an attempt to save the lives of the wounded. 

==Early life==
William Dartnell was born on [[6 April]] [[1885]] at [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Melbourne]], to Henry Dartnell, an English-born fruiterer, and his Australian wife Rose Ann, n<U+00E9>e Hanley. He was brought up in Melbourne and after leaving school, he became an actor. He married Elizabeth Edith Smyth on [[15 April]] [[1907]], at Queen Street, Melbourne. Soon after, they settled at [[Fitzroy]].<ref name=ADNB>{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080235b.htm |title=Dartnell, William Thomas (1885 &ndash; 1915) |publisher=Australian Dictionary of National Biography |accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref> 

==World War One==
At the age of 27 Dartnell settled in [[South Africa]]. When World War One started, he volunteered for service and sailed for England. [[12 February]] [[1915]], using the name '''Wilbur Taylor Dartnell''', joined the [[25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers]]. He was promoted to temporary [[Lieutenant]] on [[25 July]] [[1915]].<ref name=Army>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mod.uk/fusiliers/battalions/1st_battalion/victoria_cross/royal/lt_dartnell_wilbur_taylor_.htm |title= Lt DARTNELL, Wilbur Taylor  |publisher=Royal Fusiliers |accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref> The regimental history notes, this battalion "included men of various ages and with strange experience from all quarters of the globe".<ref>Kelleher, J.P,</ref> Raised especially for use against German troops in [[British East Africa]], it was the only British unit sent on active service during the war without preliminary training. The Fusiliers reached Mombasa on 4 May and went at once to their military post on the Uganda railway: their main task was to protect the railway from enemy raiding parties. In June, Dartnell retrieved the Imperial Ensign from the local headquarters at [[Bukoba]], the German base for attacks on the [[Uganda]] frontier. The regiment were subsequently awarded battle honours for "Bukoba".<ref name=Army/>

===Victoria Cross===
Shortly after the victory at Bukoba, the battalion moved to Voi in preparation for an allied advance towards [[German East Africa]]. Two companies were dispatched by rail to Maktau, a small village in the lee of the Taita Hills; thirty-five miles from Voi, it was the railhead of the military railway then under construction towards Taveta. On [[3 September]] [[1915]] his mounted infantry patrol was ambushed.

<blockquote>"On 3 September 1915, near Maktau, Kenya, during a mounted infantry engagement, the enemy were so close that it was impossible to get the more severely wounded away. Lieutenant Dartnell, who was himself being carried away wounded in the leg, seeing the situation, and knowing that the enemy's black troops murdered the wounded, insisted on being left behind, in the hope of being able to save the lives of other wounded men. He gave his own life in a gallant attempt to save others."(Gazetted, [[21 December]] [[1915]]<ref name=Gazette>{{LondonGazette |issue=29414 |date=21 December 1915 |startpage=12797 |supp=yes |accessdate=2007-01-16}}</ref>)</blockquote>

==Memorial==
Dartnell is buried in the township of [[Voi]], 100&nbsp;miles inland from the port of [[Mombassa]] on the East African coast. His headstone lies in a [[Commonwealth War Grave]] Cemetery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=125299 |title=CWGC: Casualty Details |publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref> His Victoria Cross is displayed at the [[Australian War Memorial]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/virtualtour/valour.htm |title=Hall of Valour |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref>
