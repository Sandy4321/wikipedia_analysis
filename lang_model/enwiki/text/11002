'''Marcus Wareing''' (born 1970), is an English [[celebrity chef|celebrity]] [[chef]], currently Chef Patron of [[Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley]] in [[Knightsbridge]], and formerly [[P<U+00E9>trus (restaurant)|P<U+00E9>trus]] in the same location. He also oversees [[The Gilbert Scott]] at the [[St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel]] and has lent a menu to the [[Aalto (restaurant)|Aalto]] at the [[Hotel La Tour]] in [[Birmingham]]. Wareing has previously been head chef at [[L<U+2019>Oranger]] and the Grill Room at the [[Savoy Hotel]].

He has had a long standing partnership and rivalry with [[Gordon Ramsay]]; the pair first met at [[Le Gavroche]] under [[Albert Roux]]. The partnership would dissolve during publicised disagreement in 1998 when the Berkeley Hotel decided to work directly with Wareing rather than through Ramsay's holding company and the following legal arrangement resulted in Ramsay retaining the rights to the P<U+00E9>trus name while Wareing went on to open his restaurant in the location. Waring won the dessert course of the 2006 series of the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Great British Menu]]'', and would appear as a judge in later series of the show, although his first television appearance was in the the Ramsay based show [[Boiling Point (1998 miniseries)|''Boiling Point'']].

His return to the UK was also to be his first head chef role, of new restaurant [[L<U+2019>Oranger]], which was owned by A-Z Restaurants, who had also owned Aubergine, and with stakes held by both Wareing and Ramsay.<ref name=caterersearch100 /> At the age of 25, he earned his first Michelin star as head chef whilst at L<U+2019>Oranger.<ref name=ftfoodies>{{cite news|last=Englehart|first=Katie|title=FT Foodies: Marcus Wareing|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/7370569a-d41f-11e0-9afc-00144feab49a.html#axzz21N1KbExa|accessdate=22 July 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=2 September 2011}}</ref> He gave [[Angela Hartnett]] her first job in a restaurant.<ref name=melbatoast />

The restaurant was moved into the [[Berkeley Hotel]] in 2003 where it replaced [[Pierre Koffmann]]'s [[La Tante Claire]],<ref name=melbatoast /> in the same year that Wareing became Chef Patron of the Grill Room at the Savoy Hotel,<ref name=caterersearch100 /> and he was named Chef of the Year by ''[[Caterer and Hotelkeeper]]'''s [[The Catey Awards|Catey Awards]].<ref name=catererdotcom/> The return to the Savoy meant that he was competing against Anton Edelmann, his former boss from the River Room at the hotel. Rather than serve a menu similar to the [[French cuisine|French]] driven P<U+00E9>trus, Wareing chose to continue to serve the [[British cuisine]] that the Grill Room was known for, including his take on previous menu items such as [[Steak and kidney pudding|steak and kidney pudding]] and [[Potted shrimps|potted shrimps]].<ref name=melbatoast /> P<U+00E9>trus went on to be awarded two [[Michelin star]]s and five [[AA Rosette]]s, while the Savoy Grill achieved its first Michelin star in the hotel's history in 2004.<ref name=caterersearch100 /> He also opened his take on an [[American diner]] at The Savoy called Banquette, and converted the previous P<U+00E9>trus location into [[La Fleur]].<ref name=onehundred2011 /> He was voted Restaurateur of the Year at the ''[[Tatler]]'' Restaurant Awards in 2004, and ''[[Harden's]]'' [[restaurant guide]] selected him as the fourth best chef in London,<ref name=caterersearch100 /> although La Fleur closed due to problems with the lease for the site.<ref name=onehundred2011 /> 

Following several months of rumours regarding the restaurant, the Berkeley Hotel confirmed in May 2008 that it was going to work with Wareing to launch its his only solo restaurant, and he would take on P<U+00E9>trus' lease from 19 September 2008 onwards.<ref name=Caterersearch.com>{{cite news| url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/2008/05/27/321025/marcus-wareing-leaves-ramsay-to-work-directly-with-berkeley-hotel.html | title=Marcus Wareing leaves Ramsay to work directly with Berkeley hotel | date=27 May 2008 | accessdate=27 May 2008 | newspaper=Caterer and Hotelkeeper | first=Amanda |last=Afiya }}</ref> Wareing had previously complained of interference in the kitchen by GRH,<ref name=fuedglorious/> and wanted to come out from under Ramsay's shadow,<ref name=failure/> but later admitted that he had engineered the situation so that he could go out on his own.<ref name=onehundred2011 /> The split with Ramsay and GRH resulted in a public legal battle and fued between the three parties,<ref name=failure>{{cite news|last=Walden|first=Celia|title=Marcus Wareing: 'wanting to be like Gordon Ramsay would make me a failure'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/6248027/Marcus-Wareing-wanting-to-be-like-Gordon-Ramsay-would-make-me-a-failure.html|accessdate=22 July 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=1 October 2009}}</ref> which when resolved resulted in Wareing stating in an interview for [[Waitrose]] Food Illustrated magazine that Ramsay left him bitter and conflicted; "half of me thinks he<U+2019>s a sad bastard and the other half still adores him."<ref name=savaged/> He went on to describe Ramsay as a [[celebrity chef]] who wasn't involved in the industry anymore.<ref name=savaged>{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Anita|title=Gordon Ramsay savaged by fellow chef Marcus Wareing|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/2465749/Gordon-Ramsay-savaged-by-fellow-chef-Marcus-Wareing.html|accessdate=22 July 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 July 2008}}</ref> The legal dispute was resolved with Ramsay gaining the rights to the P<U+00E9>trus name, and Wareing signing a [[gag order]] regarding the situation but continuing to open his restaurant [[Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley]].<ref name=fuedglorious/><ref name=famefortune>{{cite news|last=Anstead|first=Mark|title=Fame & Fortune: Chef Marcus Wareing|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/6544713/Fame-and-Fortune-Chef-Marcus-Wareing.html|accessdate=22 July 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=12 November 2009}}</ref> Wareing remarked of the situation, "If I never speak to that guy again for the rest of my life, it wouldn't bother me one bit."<ref name=failure/> Ramsay later responded regarding the feud that he wishes Wareing "all the best".<ref name=ramsaypsycho/> Wareing's self named restaurant won the Best Restaurant in London Award by Harden's guide in 2008 and 2009,<ref name=ldnbest2009>{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Amy|title=Marcus Wareing may have fallen out with Gordon Ramsay, but he now runs London's best restaurant|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/oct/01/food-and-drink-marcus-wareing|accessdate=22 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 October 2009}}</ref> was awarded two Michelin stars in 2009,<ref name=onehundred2011 /> and was named [[Time Out (magazine)|''Time Out'']]'s restaurant of the year in 2010.<ref name=ramsaypsycho>{{cite news|last=Garfield|first=Simon|title=Gordon Ramsay: 'I was a crazy psycho'|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/14/gordon-ramsay-petrus-interview|accessdate=22 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 March 2010}}</ref> The new P<U+00E9>trus was opened around the corner from the Berkeley Hotel at 1 Kinnerton Street, Knightsbridge.

At [[10 Downing Street]] in 2012, Wareing met Ramsay for the first time in five years.

===Television and other media===
Wareing was first featured on television in the [[Channel 4]] 1998 documentary series ''[[Boiling Point (1998 miniseries)|Boiling Point]]'', documenting his time as Gordon Ramsay's sous chef, his move to P<U+00E9>trus and the award of his first Michelin star.<ref name=melbatoast>{{cite news|last=Grigg|first=Casilda|title=Goodbye, Melba toast|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/restaurants/3303887/Goodbye-Melba-toast.html|accessdate=22 July 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 April 2003}}</ref> He was also selected as one of thirteen chefs chosen to recreate [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' in 2003.

Wareing beat the Manchester-based chef to go on to the final round. In the final the public chose for him to cook his dessert of [[egg custard tart]] with [[Garibaldi biscuit]]s for the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]]'s 80th birthday banquet which was on 17 June 2006.<ref name=caterersearch100 /><ref name=ftfoodies />

He has continued to be a judge for later seasons for the ''Great British Menu'', something which has occasionally brought him into conflict with other chefs such as [[Johnnie Mountain]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Manzoori-Stamford|first=Janie|title=Great British Menu 2012: Marcus Wareing vs Johnnie Mountain|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/blogs/satellite-dishes/2012/05/great-british-menu-2012-marcus-wareing-vs-johnnie-mountain.html|accessdate=22 July 2012|newspaper=Caterer and Hotelkeeper|date=9 May 2012}}</ref> He has critisized some shows in the past such as [[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]], saying that it has inspired young chefs to chase fame on television and be lazy in the kitchen,<ref>{{cite news|title=Marcus Wareing: Lazy young chefs only want fame|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/marcus-wareing-lazy-young-chefs-only-want-fame-7737104.html|accessdate=22 July 2012|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=11 May 2012}}</ref> although he has appeared on MasterChef, [[MasterChef: The Professionals]] and [[Celebrity MasterChef]] in the past.
