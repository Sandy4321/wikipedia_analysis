The {{nihongo|'''Soga clan'''|<U+8607><U+6211><U+6C0F>|Soga no uji}} was one of the most powerful clans in [[Yamato period|Yamato]] [[Japan]]. For many generations, in the 6th and 7th centuries, the Soga monopolized the position of [[Great Minister (Japan)|Great Royal Chieftain]] (&#332;-omi) and was the first of many families to dominate the Imperial House, influencing the order of succession, and policy both domestic and foreign.

[[Soga no Iname]] served as Great Minister from [[536]] until his death in [[570]], and was the first of the Soga to carry to extreme lengths the domination of the Throne by the nobility. One of the chief ways he exerted his influence was through marital connections with the Imperial family; Iname married one of his daughters to [[Emperor Kimmei]]. In an ironic way, the Soga unified and strengthened the country by expanding the power of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] as a symbol and spiritual leader, even as they, a line of non-imperial nobles, took control of secular matters.

When [[Buddhism]] was first introduced, many opposed it, disliking foreign ideas and resisting its spread. The Soga family, however, supported the introduction of [[Buddhism]], placing a holy image of the [[Buddha]] in a major [[Shinto]] shrine; [[Soga no Iname]] claimed that [[Buddhism]] brought with it a new form of government that would subvert the independence of the clans, unifying the Japanese people under the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]]. After fifty years of ideological war, Buddhism, defended and protected by the Soga, began to take hold in Japan.

However, by [[644]], the heads of the Soga clan were no longer satisfied to act behind the scenes. [[Soga no Emishi]] and his son [[Soga no Iruka|Iruka]] began to build more and more elaborate palaces and tombs for themselves, styling themselves sovereigns. There seems little doubt that they intended to do away with the reigning dynasty, making themselves the new imperial line. But the leader of the [[Nakatomi clan]], [[Nakatomi no Kamatari]], conspired with [[Soga no Kurayamada|Soga no Kurayamada no Ishikawa no Maro]] and [[Emperor Tenji|Prince Naka no <U+014C>e]], and arranged for [[Soga no Iruka|Iruka's]] assassination. Emishi's followers dispersed, and many were subsequently killed. The Soga clan's hold over the imperial family was broken once and for all. Two years later, [[Emperor Kotoku|Emperor K<U+014D>toku]] enacted the [[Taika Reforms]], further unifying Japan, and returning power to the Throne, especially power over the nobility.
