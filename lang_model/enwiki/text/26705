It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 21 October 1992.<ref name=qhr>{{cite QHR|15125|Windsor War Memorial Park|600350|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref>

== History ==
The Windsor War Memorial was was erected on behalf of the citizens of the [[Town of Windsor]] to commemorate local residents who had served in the [[First World War]]. It was unveiled on [[Anzac Day]], 25 April 1925 by [[Charles Taylor (Queensland politician)|Charles Taylor]], the [[Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly]] for [[electoral district of Windsor (Queensland)|Windsor]]. [[William Jolly]], [[Mayor of Brisbane]], and Henry Bond, mayor of the Town of Windsor were also in attendance.<ref name=qhr/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article20895923 |title=WINDSOR MEMORIAL. |newspaper=[[Courier-Mail|The Brisbane Courier (Qld. : 1864 - 1933)]] |location=Qld. |date=27 April 1925 |accessdate=14 December 2014 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Costing around <U+00A3>1,300, the memorial was based on an initial concept by ex-alderman McDonald.  It was constructed by contractor Peter Frew to a design prepared by honorary architects [[Francis Richard Hall]] and WA Devereux.<ref name=qhr/>

The octagonal pavilion is rare among Queensland's First World War memorials.  [[Yeronga War Memorial]] (1921) is its closest [[Brisbane]] equivalent.<ref name=qhr/>

The surrounding park existed prior to the construction of the memorial.  It was the site of the former [[Windsor State School|Bowen Bridge State School]] from 1865 until the latter burnt down about 1914, after which the school reserve was ceded unofficially to the [[Town of Windsor|Windsor Town Council]] for park use.  Despite landscaping, erection of the memorial, and public recognition of the Windsor Memorial Park, it was not declared a park reserve until 1930.<ref name=qhr/>

== Description ==
The Windsor War Memorial stands on the highest point of a park situated between Lutwyche Road and Roblane Street, Windsor.<ref name=qhr/>

The memorial is an octagonal, pavilion-type structure and is constructed of brown [[Helidon, Queensland|Helidon]] sandstone.  It rests on a wide [[podium]] of locally quarried porphyry ([[Brisbane tuff]]), with steps at each face.<ref name=qhr/>

The memorial has arches on four sides, and on the external corner panels are inscribed the names, originally gilt, of those who died in the war.  Inscribed lettering forms a [[frieze]] around the [[entablature]], and the whole is surmounted by a [[cupola]] and a bronze lantern with a red electric light.<ref name=qhr/>

Inside, the concrete floor is painted red and blue, and features a leaded marble commemorative plaque in the centre.  The circular ceiling is ornamented with a moulded [[laurel wreath]].<ref name=qhr/>

The area immediately surrounding the memorial has been asphalted, but the remainder of the park is grassed and planted with large, mature trees and shrubs.  Pink [[oleanders]] form a hedge along Lutwyche Road, above stone retaining walls.<ref name=qhr/>

Apart from the removal of an inter-war timber bandstand, both park and memorial remain substantially intact.  They retain a prominent position in the Windsor townscape, standing on a principal arterial entry to the city and adjacent to the former [[Windsor Town Council Chambers]] (1896-97).<ref name=qhr/>
