== Cronulla riots fallout ==

In [[December 2005]], following the [[2005 Cronulla riots|Cronulla race-riots]] and subsequent rumours that the mosque would be attacked, a mostly Middle-Eastern group assembled at the premises with the aim of protecting them, amidst a heavy police presence. After calls for calm by Muslim leaders present at the mosque, the crowd dispersed. It was reported that some Muslim men gathered at the mosque were preparing to travel to Maroubra Beach to fight with the "Bra Boys".
