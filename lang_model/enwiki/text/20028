The '''Phoenix RoadRunners''' are an [[ECHL]] hockey team that began play in the 2005-2006 season in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. The team is owned by the same group as the [[Phoenix Suns]] and the [[Phoenix Mercury]] and also plays in the [[US Airways Center]] in downtown Phoenix. The team president is [[Claude Lemieux]]. 

==Minor League Hockey History in Arizona==
The Phoenix Roadrunners were the first professional sports team in the history of [[Arizona]]. The team initially existed from 1967-1979 in the [[World Hockey Association]] and again from 1989-1997 in the [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|International Hockey League]]. The Roadrunners of the IHL folded after the 1997 season, bringing on the [[West Coast Hockey League]]'s [[Phoenix Mustangs]], who played in Phoenix from 1997-2001, their high point being a Taylor Cup Championship in 2000. Unfortunately, a deal was unable to be reached with the city of Phoenix on usage of the [[Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum]], so the Mustangs folded in 2001. The current team and management will attempt to preserve some of the traditions and history of the old teams.

==Season Recaps==

===Inaugural Season===
In 2005, after 4 years without a minor league hockey team, the Roadrunners were revived as an [[ECHL]] franchise by [[Phoenix Suns]] owner Robert Sarver and former [[Phoenix Coyotes]] star Claude Lemieux. In their first season, the 2005-2006 season, the RoadRunners began the season well but dropped throughout the year because of injuries and finished with the league's worst record.

===Second Season===
In the offseason, the Roadrunners cemented an affiliation deal with the [[Phoenix Coyotes]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. In there second season, the Roadrunners once again started very well, staying above .500 for a good portion of the year. The team climbed up the National Division, topping out at fifth place. However, due to several trades which were lackluster to say the least, the team ended up with a 27-40 record. Furthermore, with 8 games left in the regular season, Head Coach [[Ron Filion]] and General Manager [[Ray Delia]] resigned, Filion being replaced by assistant coach [[Brad Church]].[http://www.phxroadrunners.com/news/recentheadlines/index.html?article_id=441] One bright spot to the season was that the Roadrunners qualified for their first trip to the [[ECHL]]'s Kelly Cup Playoffs. This was the first time since the 1995-1996 team lost in the conference quarter finals that the Roadrunners had made it to the Playoffs. However in the first round, the team was swept 4-0 against there rivals, the [[Las Vegas Wranglers]].

===Third Season===
After the season ended, the Roadrunners decided to keep Church on, and also extend to him a managerial roll as well. His duties include, but are not limited to: Contract preparation, immigration, and other administrative duties.[http://www.phxroadrunners.com/news/recentheadlines/index.html?article_id=475].Also taking place during the offseason, the Roadrunners lost a powerful ally. The [[Phoenix Coyotes]] chose not to renew there affiliation agreement for the 2007-2008 season. The Coyotes chose instead to go with the other minor league hockey team in [[Arizona]], the [[Arizona Sundogs]]. Furthermore, the [[San Antonio Rampage]], the [[AHL]] partner of the Roadrunners, also became an affiliate with the [[Arizona Sundogs]]. The team currently is looking for an affiliate to catch on with for the 2007-2008 season.

==Battle of the Desert==
During the 2006-2007 offseason, the [[Arizona Sundogs]] of the [[CHL]] and the [[Phoenix Roadrunners]] came to an agreement on a two game pre-season hockey contest. The games will showcase the talent of [[Arizona]]'s two minor league hockey teams, and help the two teams evaluate there current talent and who will and will not make the upcoming season's roster. The winner, considering there isn't a tie, will get the "Glass Cactus".[http://www.phxroadrunners.com/news/recentheadlines/index.html?article_id=512]

==Rocky Roadrunner==
Rocky Roadrunner is the [[mascot]] of the Roadrunners. Rocky, who has been with the team for decades, is a mainstay from the early years in the desert. His service dates back all the way to 1967.[http://phoenix.about.com/od/sportsandrecreation/ss/mascots_9.htm] The recent [[ECHL]] move brought a major change of the entire costume, most notably the skin, which has turned a bright yellow compared to a shade of brown in previous years. [http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.mascotstalker.com/rocky/rocky.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.mascotstalker.com/rocky/&h=435&w=326&sz=66&hl=en&start=5&um=1&tbnid=0eLUfAMmfxx6pM:&tbnh=126&tbnw=94&prev=/images%3Fq%3Drocky%2Broadrunner%26ndsp%3D20%26svnum%3D10%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN] Furthermore, rather than continuing the more lifelike version of previous years, the [[ECHL]]'s version chose to make a more cartoonish version of Rocky.
