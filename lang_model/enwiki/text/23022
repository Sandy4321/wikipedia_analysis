'''Charles II''' (29 May 1630 [[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]] <U+2013> 6 February 1685 OS) was monarch of the three kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]].

Charles II's father [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] [[Regicide#The regicide of Charles I of England|was executed]] at [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] on 30 January 1649, at the climax of the [[English Civil War]]. Although the [[Parliament of Scotland]] proclaimed Charles II King of Great Britain and Ireland in [[Edinburgh]] on 6 February 1649, the [[English Parliament]] instead passed [[An Act prohibiting the proclaiming any person to be King of England or Ireland, or the Dominions thereof|a statute]] that made any such proclamation in England and Ireland unlawful. England entered the period known to history as the [[English Interregnum]] or the [[English Commonwealth]] and the country was a ''[[de facto]]'' [[republic]], led by [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Cromwell defeated Charles at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651, and Charles fled to mainland Europe. Cromwell became virtual dictator of England, Scotland and Ireland. Charles spent the next nine years in exile in [[France]], the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and the [[Spanish Netherlands]].

A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of the monarchy, and Charles was invited to return to Britain. On 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday, he was received in London to public acclaim. After 1660, all legal documents were dated as if Charles had succeeded his father as king in 1649.

[[Cavalier Parliament|Charles's English parliament]] enacted laws known as the [[Penal law#Clarendon Code|Clarendon Code]], designed to shore up the position of the re-[[Established Church|established]] [[Church of England]]. Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he himself favoured a policy of religious tolerance. The major foreign policy issue of Charles's early reign was the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. In 1670, Charles entered into the [[secret treaty of Dover]], an alliance with his first cousin King [[Louis XIV of France]]. Louis agreed to aid Charles in the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] and pay Charles a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to [[Roman Catholicism]] at an unspecified future date. Charles attempted to introduce [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]], but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it. In 1679, [[Titus Oates]]'s revelations of a supposed "[[Popish Plot]]" sparked the [[Exclusion Crisis]] when it was revealed that Charles's brother and heir ([[James II of England|James, Duke of York]]) was a Roman Catholic. The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion [[British Whig Party|Whig]] and anti-exclusion [[Tory]] parties. Charles sided with the Tories, and, following the discovery of the [[Rye House Plot]] to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were killed or forced into exile. Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681, and ruled alone until his death on 6 February 1685. He converted to Roman Catholicism on his deathbed.

Charles was popularly known as the ''Merrie Monarch'', in reference to both the liveliness and [[hedonism]] of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the [[Puritans]]. Charles's wife, [[Catherine of Braganza]], bore no children, but Charles acknowledged at least 12 [[legitimacy (law)|illegitimate]] children by various mistresses. As illegitimate children were excluded from the succession, he was succeeded by his brother James.

== Early life ==

Charles was born in [[St. James's Palace]] on 29 May 1630 (8 June 1630 [[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]]). His parents were King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], who ruled the three kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], and Queen [[Henrietta Maria]], the sister of King [[Louis XIII of France]]. Charles was their second son and child, but their first son, who was born about a year before Charles, had died aged less than a day.<ref name="weir"/> England, Scotland and Ireland were [[Christianity|Christian]] countries, but worship was divided between different denominations such as [[Catholicism]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Presbyterianism]], and [[Puritan]]ism. Charles was baptised in the [[Chapel Royal]] on 27 June by the Anglican [[Bishop of London]] [[William Laud]] and brought up in the care of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Mary Sackville, Countess of Dorset|Countess of Dorset]], though his godparents included his mother's Catholic relations, Louis XIII and [[Marie de' Medici]].<ref>Fraser, p.13 and Hutton, pp.1<U+2013>4</ref> At birth, Charles automatically became [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]], along with several other associated titles. At or around his eighth birthday, he was designated [[Prince of Wales]], though he was never formally invested with the [[Honours of the Principality of Wales]].<ref name="weir">{{citation|last=Weir|first=Alison|authorlink=Alison Weir (historian)|title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy, Revised edition|publisher=Random House|year=1996|isbn=0712674489|pages=255<U+2013>257}}</ref>

During the 1640s, when Charles was still young, his father fought [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] and [[Puritan]] forces in the [[English Civil War]]. Charles accompanied his father during the [[Battle of Edgehill]] and, at the age of fourteen, participated in the campaigns of 1645, when he was made titular commander of the English forces in the [[West Country]].<ref>Fraser, p.32 and Hutton, pp.6<U+2013>7</ref> By Spring 1646, his father was losing the war, and Charles left England due to fears for his safety, going first to the [[Isles of Scilly]], then to [[Jersey]], and finally to France, where his mother was already living in exile and his first cousin, eight-year-old [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], was king.<ref>Fraser, pp.38<U+2013>45 and Miller, ''Charles II'' p.6</ref>

In 1648, during the [[Second English Civil War]], Charles moved to [[The Hague]], where his sister [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary]] and his brother-in-law [[William II, Prince of Orange]], seemed more likely to provide substantial aid to the [[Cavalier|royalist]] cause than the Queen's French relations.<ref>Fraser, pp.55<U+2013>56</ref> However, the royalist fleet that came under Charles's control was not used to any advantage, and did not reach Scotland in time to join up with the royalist [[Engagers]] army of the [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]], before it was defeated at the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]] by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Fraser, pp.57<U+2013>60</ref>

At The Hague, Charles had a brief affair with [[Lucy Walter]], who later falsely claimed that they had secretly married.<ref>Fraser, pp.65<U+2013>66, 155, Hutton, p.26, and Miller, ''Charles II'' p.5</ref> Her son, [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|James Crofts]] (afterwards [[Duke of Monmouth]] and [[Duke of Buccleuch]]), was one of Charles's many acknowledged illegitimate children who became prominent in British political life and society.

Charles I was captured in 1647. He escaped and was recaptured in 1648. Despite his son's diplomatic efforts to save him, Charles I was beheaded in 1649, and England became a [[republic]]. On 6 February, the [[Covenanter]] [[Parliament of Scotland]] proclaimed Charles II as King of Great Britain in succession to his father, but refused to allow him to enter Scotland unless he accepted [[Presbyterianism]] throughout the British Isles. When negotiations stalled, Charles authorised [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|General Montrose]] to land in the [[Orkney Islands]] with a small army to threaten the Scots with invasion, in the hope of forcing an agreement more to his liking. Montrose feared that Charles would accept a compromise, and so chose to invade mainland Scotland anyway. He was captured and executed. Charles was reluctantly induced to make promises that he would abide by the terms of a [[Treaty of Breda (1650)|treaty agreed between him and the Scots Parliament]] at [[Breda]], and support the [[Covenanter|Solemn League and Covenant]], which authorized [[Presbyterian church governance]] across Britain. Upon his arrival in Scotland on 23 June 1650, Charles formally agreed to the Covenant; his abandonment of [[Episcopy|Episcopal]] church governance, although winning him support in Scotland, left him unpopular in England. Charles himself soon came to despise the "villainy" and "hypocrisy" of the [[Covenanters]].<ref>Fraser, p.97 and Hutton, p.53</ref>

On 3 September 1650, the Covenanters were defeated at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]] by a much smaller force led by [[Oliver Cromwell]]. The Scots forces were divided into royalist Engagers and Presbyterian Covenanters, who even fought each other. Disillusioned by the Covenanters, in October Charles attempted to escape from them and rode north to join with an Engager force, an event which became known as "the Start", but within two days the Presbyterians had caught up with and recovered him.<ref>Fraser, pp.96<U+2013>97 and Hutton, pp.56<U+2013>57</ref> Nevertheless, the Scots remained Charles's best hope of restoration, and he was crowned King of Scotland at [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]] on 1 January 1651. With Cromwell's forces threatening Charles's position in Scotland, it was decided to mount an attack on England. With many of the Scots (including [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll|Lord Argyll]] and other leading Covenanters) refusing to participate, and with few English royalists joining the force as it moved south into England, the invasion ended in defeat at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651, after which Charles eluded capture by hiding in the [[Royal Oak (tree)|Royal Oak]] at [[Boscobel House]]. Through six weeks of narrow escapes [[Escape of Charles II|Charles managed to flee England]] in disguise, landing in [[Normandy]] on 16 October, despite a reward of [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]1,000 on his head, risk of death for anyone caught helping him and the difficulty in disguising Charles, who was unusually tall at over 6&nbsp;feet (185&nbsp;cm) high.<ref>Fraser, pp.98<U+2013>128 and Hutton, pp.53<U+2013>69</ref><ref>One thousand pounds was a vast sum at the time, greater than an average workman's lifetime earnings (Fraser, p.117).</ref>

Cromwell was appointed [[Lord Protector#Cromwellian Commonwealth|Lord Protector]] of England, Scotland and Ireland, effectively placing the British Isles under military rule. Impoverished, Charles could not obtain sufficient support to mount a serious challenge to Cromwell's government. Despite the Stuart family connections through Henrietta Maria and the Princess of Orange, France and the [[Dutch Republic]] allied themselves with Cromwell's government from 1654, forcing Charles to turn for aid to Spain, which at that time ruled the [[Southern Netherlands]]. He attempted to raise an army, but failed for lack of finance.<ref>Hutton, pp.74<U+2013>112</ref>

== Restoration ==
{{Further|[[Restoration (England)]]|[[Restoration (Scotland)]]|[[Restoration (Ireland)]]|[[Restoration (Colonies)]]}}
After the death of Cromwell in 1658, Charles's chances of regaining the Crown at first seemed slim as Cromwell was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son, [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]]. However, the new Lord Protector, with no power base in either Parliament or the [[New Model Army]], was forced to abdicate in 1659 and the Protectorate was abolished. During the civil and military unrest which followed, [[George Monck]], the Governor of Scotland, was concerned that the nation would descend into anarchy.<ref>Fraser, pp.160<U+2013>165</ref> Monck and his army marched into the [[City of London]] and forced the [[Rump Parliament]] to re-admit members of the [[Long Parliament]] excluded in December 1648 during [[Pride's Purge]]. The Long Parliament dissolved itself and for the first time in almost 20 years, there was a [[general election]].<ref>Diary of [[Samuel Pepys]], 16 March 1660</ref> The outgoing Parliament designed the electoral qualifications so as to ensure, as they thought, the return of a Presbyterian majority.<ref name="elect">Miller, ''Charles II'' pp.24<U+2013>25</ref>

The restrictions against royalist candidates and voters were widely ignored, and the elections resulted in a [[Parliament of England|House of Commons]] which was fairly evenly divided on political grounds between Royalists and Parliamentarians and on religious grounds between Anglicans and Presbyterians.<ref name="elect"/> The new so-called [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]] assembled on 25 April 1660, and soon afterwards received news of the [[Declaration of Breda]], in which Charles agreed, amongst other things, to pardon many of his father's enemies. The English Parliament resolved to proclaim Charles king and invite him to return, a message that reached Charles at Breda on 8 May 1660.<ref>Hutton, p.131</ref> In Ireland, a [[Irish Convention (1660)|convention]] had been called earlier in the year, and on 14 May it declared for Charles as King.<ref name="dnb">Seaward, Paul (September 2004; online edn, January 2008) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5144 "Charles II (1630<U+2013>1685)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, [[doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/5144]], retrieved 19 April 2010 (Subscription required)</ref>

Painting by [[Lieve Verschuier]].]]
Charles set out for England, arrived in [[Dover]] on 25 May 1660 and reached London on 29 May, his 30th birthday. Although Charles and Parliament granted [[amnesty]] to Cromwell's supporters in the [[Act of Indemnity and Oblivion]], 50 people were specifically excluded.<ref>Fraser, p.190</ref> In the end nine of the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] were executed:<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/TheStuarts/CharlesII.aspx|title=Charles II (r. 1660<U+2013>1685)|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy|accessdate=19 April 2010}}</ref> they were [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]; others were given life imprisonment or simply excluded from office for life. The bodies of [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]] and [[John Bradshaw (Judge)|John Bradshaw]] were subjected to the indignity of [[posthumous execution|posthumous decapitations]].<ref>Fraser, p.185</ref>

Charles agreed to give up [[Feudalism|feudal]] dues that had been revived by his father; in return, the English Parliament granted him an annual income to run the government of <U+00A3>1.2 million, generated largely from [[HM Customs and Excise|customs and excise]] duties. The grant, however, proved to be insufficient for most of Charles's reign. The sum was only an indication of the maximum the King was allowed to withdraw from the Treasury each year; for the most part, the actual revenue was much lower, which led to mounting debts, and further attempts to raise money through [[poll tax]]es, [[Land value tax|land taxes]] and [[Chimney money|hearth taxes]].

== Early reign ==
In the later half of 1660, Charles's joy at the Restoration was tempered by the deaths of his youngest brother, [[Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester|Henry]], and sister, [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary]], of [[smallpox]]. At around the same time, [[Anne Hyde]], the daughter of the [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], revealed that she was pregnant by Charles's brother, [[James II of England|James]], whom she had secretly married. Edward Hyde, who had not known of either the marriage or the pregnancy, was created [[Earl of Clarendon]] and his position as Charles's favourite minister was strengthened.<ref>Fraser, pp.210<U+2013>202, Hutton, pp.155<U+2013>156 and Miller, ''Charles II'' pp.43<U+2013>44</ref>
[[File:Charles II of England in Coronation robes.jpg|thumb|right|Charles in his Coronation robes.<br />Painted by [[John Michael Wright]], circa 1661|alt=Charles wearing a crown and ermine-lined cape]]
The Convention Parliament was dissolved in December 1660, and Charles's coronation took place at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 23 April 1661. Charles was the last sovereign to make the traditional procession from the [[Tower of London]] to Westminster Abbey the day before the coronation.<ref>{{citation|last=Keay|first=A.|year=2002|title=The Crown Jewels|publisher=Historic Royal Palaces|isbn=1 873993 20 X}}</ref> Shortly after the coronation, the second English Parliament of the reign assembled. Dubbed the [[Cavalier Parliament]], it was overwhelmingly Royalist and Anglican. It sought to discourage [[non-conformist|non-conformity]] to the [[Church of England]], and passed several acts to secure Anglican dominance. The [[Corporation Act 1661]] required municipal officeholders to swear allegiance;<ref>Hutton, p.169</ref> the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]] made the use of the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]] compulsory; the [[Conventicle Act 1664]] prohibited religious assemblies of more than five people, except under the auspices of the Church of England; and the [[Five Mile Act 1665]] prohibited clergymen from coming within five&nbsp;miles (8&nbsp;km) of a parish from which they had been banished. The Conventicle and Five Mile Acts remained in effect for the remainder of Charles's reign. The Acts became known as the "Clarendon Code", after Lord Clarendon, even though he was not directly responsible for them and even spoke against the Five Mile Act.<ref>Hutton, p.229</ref>

The Restoration was accompanied by social change. [[Puritan]]ism lost its momentum. Theatres reopened after having been closed during the [[English Interregnum|protectorship]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]], and bawdy "[[Restoration comedy]]" became a recognizable genre. Theatre licenses granted by Charles were the first in England to permit women to play female roles on stage (they were previously played by boys),<ref>Hutton, p.185</ref> and [[Restoration literature]] celebrated or reacted to the restored court, which included [[libertine]]s like [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]]. Of Charles II, Wilmot supposedly said:
:We have a pretty witty King,
:And whose word no man relies on;
:He never said a foolish thing,
:And never did a wise one.<ref>Papers of [[Thomas Hearne]] (17 November 1706) quoted in Doble, C. E. (editor) (1885) ''Remarks and Collections of Thomas Hearne Volume 1'', Oxford: Clarendon Press for the Oxford Historical Society, p. 308</ref>
To which Charles is reputed to have replied "that the matter was easily accounted for: For that his discourse was his own, his actions were the ministry's."<ref>[[David Hume|Hume, David]] (1778) ''The History of England from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688'' Volume VIII, London: printed for T. Cadell, p. 212</ref>

=== Great Plague and Fire ===
In 1665, Charles was faced with a great health crisis: the [[Great Plague of London]]. The death toll at one point reached a peak of 7,000 in the week of 17 September.<ref>Fraser, p.238</ref> Charles, along with his family and court, fled London in July to [[Salisbury]]; Parliament met in [[Oxford]].<ref>Miller, ''Charles II'' p.120</ref> Various attempts at containing the disease by London public health officials all fell in vain and the disease continued to spread rapidly.<ref>{{citation|author=Defoe, Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Defoe|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17221|title=History of the Plague in England|year=1894|publisher=American Book Company|location=New York}}</ref>

Adding to London's woes, but marking the end of the plague, was what later became known as the [[Great Fire of London]], which started on 2 September 1666. The fire consumed about 13,200 houses and 87 churches, including [[St. Paul's Cathedral]].<ref name=porter>{{citation|last=Porter|first=Stephen|title=The great fire of London|journal =Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=January 2007|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/themes/95/95647.html|accessdate=19 April 2010}} (Subscription required)</ref> Charles, and his brother James, joined and directed the fire-fighting effort. The public blamed Roman Catholic conspirators for the fire,<ref>Fraser, pp.243<U+2013>247 and Miller, ''Charles II'' pp.121<U+2013>122</ref> although it had actually started in a bakehouse in [[Pudding Lane]].<ref name=porter />

== Foreign and colonial policy ==
Since 1640, Portugal had been fighting a [[Portuguese Restoration War|war against Spain]] to restore its independence after a dynastic union of 60 years between the crowns of Spain and Portugal. Portugal had been helped by France, but in the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659 Portugal was abandoned by its French ally. Upon Charles's restoration, [[Luisa of Medina-Sidonia|Queen Lu<U+00ED>sa of Portugal]], acting as regent, opened negotiations with England that resulted in an alliance. On 23 June 1661, a marriage treaty was signed, and in May 1662, Charles married [[Catherine of Braganza]] in the [[Domus Dei|parish of St Thomas <U+00E0> Becket]], [[Portsmouth]].<ref name="weir"/> Catherine's dowry brought the territories of [[Tangier]] and [[Seven islands of Bombay|Bombay]] to British control. The latter had a major influence on the development of the [[British Empire]] in India. In an unpopular move the same year, Charles sold [[Dunkirk]] to his first cousin King [[Louis XIV of France]] for about <U+00A3>375,000.<ref>Miller, ''Charles II'' pp.93, 99</ref> The channel port, although a valuable strategic outpost, was a drain on Charles's limited finances.<ref>It cost the Treasury <U+00A3>321,000 per year (Hutton, p.184).</ref>

[[File:CharlesII1667Medal.jpg|thumb|left|Charles II in profile on a medal struck in 1667 by [[John Roettier]] to commemorate the [[Second Dutch War]]|alt=Obverse of medal]]
Before Charles's restoration, the [[Navigation Acts]] of 1650 had hurt [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] trade by giving English vessels a monopoly, and had started the [[First Dutch War]] (1652<U+2013>1654). The [[Second Dutch War]] (1665<U+2013>1667) was started by English attempts to muscle in on Dutch possessions in Africa and North America. The conflict began well for the English, with the capture of [[New Amsterdam]] (renamed New York in honour of Charles's brother James, Duke of York) and a victory at the [[Battle of Lowestoft]], but in 1667 the Dutch launched a surprise attack on the English (the [[Raid on the Medway]]) when they sailed up the [[River Thames]] to where a major part of the English fleet was docked. Almost all of the ships were sunk except for the flagship, the [[HMS Royal Charles (1655)|''Royal Charles'']], which was taken back to the Netherlands as a trophy.<ref>The ship's transom is on display at the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]].</ref> The Second Dutch War ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)]].

As a result of the Second Dutch War, Charles dismissed [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]], whom he used as a scapegoat for the war.<ref>Hutton, pp.250<U+2013>251</ref> Clarendon fled to France when impeached for [[high treason]] (which carried the penalty of death). Power passed to five politicians known collectively by a whimsical<!--Macaulay, (1849) ''The History of England from the Accession of James II'', p.152--> [[acronym]] as the [[Cabal]]<U+2014>[[Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford|Clifford]], [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Arlington]], [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]], [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Ashley (afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury)]] and [[John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale|Lauderdale]]. In fact, the Cabal rarely acted in concert, and the court was often divided between two factions led by Arlington and Buckingham, with Arlington the more successful.<ref>Hutton, p.254 and Miller, ''Charles II'' p.175<U+2013>176</ref>

In 1668, England allied itself with Sweden, and with its former enemy the Netherlands, in order to oppose Louis XIV in the [[War of Devolution]]. Louis made peace with the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]], but he continued to maintain his aggressive intentions towards the Netherlands. In 1670, Charles, seeking to solve his financial troubles, agreed to the [[Treaty of Dover]], under which Louis XIV would pay him <U+00A3>160,000 each year. In exchange, Charles agreed to supply Louis with troops and to announce his conversion to Roman Catholicism "as soon as the welfare of his kingdom will permit".<ref>Fraser, p.275</ref> Louis was to provide him with 6,000 troops to suppress those who opposed the conversion. Charles endeavoured to ensure that the Treaty<U+2014>especially the conversion clause<U+2014>remained secret.<ref>Fraser, p.275<U+2013>276 and Miller, ''Charles II'' p.180</ref> It remains unclear if Charles ever seriously intended to convert.<ref name="dnb"/>

Meanwhile, by a series of five charters, Charles granted the [[British East India Company]] the rights to autonomous territorial acquisitions, to mint money, to command fortresses and troops, to form alliances, to make war and peace, and to exercise both civil and [[criminal jurisdiction]] over the acquired areas in India.<ref>"East India Company" (1911). [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]], Volume 8, p.835</ref> Earlier in 1668 he leased the islands of [[Bombay]] for a nominal sum of <U+00A3>10 paid in [[gold]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/trading/bombay/history.html|title=Bombay: History of a City|publisher=The British Library Board|accessdate=19 April 2010}}</ref> The Portuguese territories that Catherine brought with her as dowry had proved too expensive to maintain; Tangier was abandoned.<ref>Hutton, p.426</ref> 

In 1670, Charles granted control of the entire [[Hudson Bay]] drainage basin to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] by royal charter, and named the territory [[Rupert's Land]], after his cousin [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], the company's first Governor.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/collections/archival/charter/|title=The Royal Charter of the Hudson's Bay Company|publisher=[[Hudson's Bay Company]]|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref>

== Conflict with Parliament ==
Although previously favourable to the Crown, the Cavalier Parliament was alienated by the king's wars and religious policies during the 1670s. In 1672, Charles issued the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]], in which he purported to suspend all [[penal law]]s against Roman Catholics and other religious dissenters. In the same year, he openly supported Catholic France and started the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]].<ref>Fraser, pp.305<U+2013>308 and Hutton, pp.284<U+2013>285</ref>

The Cavalier Parliament opposed the Declaration of Indulgence on constitutional grounds by claiming that the King had no right to arbitrarily suspend laws passed by Parliament. Charles withdrew the Declaration, and also agreed to the [[Test Act]], which not only required public officials to receive the [[Eucharist|sacrament]] under the forms prescribed by the Church of England,<ref>{{citation|author=Raithby, John (ed.)|title=Charles II, 1672: An Act for preventing Dangers which may happen from Popish Recusants|journal=Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628<U+2013>80|year=1819|pages=782<U+2013>785|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47451|accessdate=19 April 2010}}</ref> but also later forced them to denounce certain teachings of the Roman Catholic Church as "[[superstition|superstitious]] and [[idolatry|idolatrous]]".<ref>{{citation|author=Raithby, John (ed.)|title=Charles II, 1678: (Stat. 2.)

By 1674 England had gained nothing from the Anglo-Dutch War, and the Cavalier Parliament refused to provide further funds, forcing Charles to make peace. The power of the Cabal waned and that of Clifford's replacement, [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Lord Danby]], grew.

Charles's wife Queen Catherine was unable to produce an heir; her four pregnancies had ended in [[miscarriage]]s and [[stillbirth]]s in 1662, February 1666, May 1668 and June 1669.<ref name="weir"/> Charles's heir-presumptive was therefore his unpopular Roman Catholic brother, James, Duke of York. Partly in order to assuage public fears that the royal family was too Catholic, Charles agreed that James's daughter, [[Mary II of England|Mary]], should marry the Protestant [[William III of England|William of Orange]].<ref>Fraser, pp.347<U+2013>348 and Hutton, pp.345<U+2013>346</ref> In 1678, [[Titus Oates]], who had been alternately an Anglican and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, falsely warned of a "[[Popish Plot]]" to assassinate the King, even accusing the Queen of complicity. Charles did not believe the allegations, but ordered his chief minister Lord Danby to investigate. While Lord Danby seems to have been rightly sceptical about Oates's claims, the Cavalier Parliament took them seriously.<ref>Hutton, pp.359<U+2013>362</ref> The people were seized with an anti-Catholic hysteria;<ref>Fraser, p.360</ref> judges and juries across the land condemned the supposed conspirators; numerous innocent individuals were executed.<ref>Fraser, p.375</ref>

Later in 1678, Lord Danby was impeached by the House of Commons on the charge of [[high treason]]. Although much of the nation had sought war with Catholic France, Charles had secretly negotiated with [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], trying to reach an agreement under which England would remain neutral in return for money. Lord Danby had publicly professed that he was hostile to France, but had reservedly agreed to abide by Charles's wishes. Unfortunately for him, the House of Commons failed to view him as a reluctant participant in the scandal, instead believing that he was the author of the policy. To save Lord Danby from the impeachment trial, Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679.<ref>Miller, ''Charles II'' pp.278, 301<U+2013>304</ref>

The new English Parliament, which met in March of the same year, was quite hostile to Charles. Having lost the support of Parliament, Lord Danby resigned his post of [[Lord High Treasurer]], but received a pardon from the King. In defiance of the royal will, the House of Commons declared that the dissolution of Parliament did not interrupt impeachment proceedings, and that the pardon was therefore invalid. When the [[House of Lords]] attempted to impose the punishment of exile<U+2014>which the Commons thought too mild<U+2014>the impeachment became stalled between the two Houses. As he had been required to do so many times during his reign, Charles bowed to the wishes of his opponents, committing Lord Danby to the [[Tower of London]]. Lord Danby would be held there for another five years.<ref>Hutton, pp.367<U+2013>374 and Miller, ''Charles II'' pp.306<U+2013>309</ref>

== Later years ==
Charles faced a political storm over the succession to the Throne. The prospect of a Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]] (previously Baron Ashley and a member of the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the [[Exclusion Bill]], which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the [[Succession to the British Throne|line of succession]]. Some even sought to confer the Crown to the Protestant [[Duke of Monmouth]], the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children. The ''Abhorrers''<U+2014>those who thought the Exclusion Bill was abhorrent<U+2014>were named [[Tory|Tories]] (after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits), while the ''Petitioners''<U+2014>those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the Exclusion Bill<U+2014>became called [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).<ref>Hutton, pp. 373, 377, 391 and Miller, ''Charles II'' pp.310<U+2013>320</ref>

[[File:charles2coin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Half crown (British coin)|Half crown]] of Charles II, 1683. The inscription reads CAROLUS II DEI GRATIA (Charles II by the Grace of God).|alt=Silver coin]]
Fearing that the Exclusion Bill would be passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the continuing Plot trials, which seemed to him to indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, for a second time that year, in the summer of 1679. Charles's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled, within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days.<ref>Hutton, pp.376<U+2013>401 and Miller ''Charles II'' pp.314<U+2013>345</ref> During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty, for many of his subjects felt that Parliament had been too assertive. Lord Shaftesbury was charged with treason and fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.<ref>Hutton, pp.430<U+2013>441</ref>

Charles's opposition to the Exclusion Bill angered some Protestants. Protestant conspirators formulated the [[Rye House Plot]], a plan to murder the King and the Duke of York as they returned to London after horse races in [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]]. A great fire, however, destroyed Charles's lodgings at Newmarket, which forced him to leave the races early thus, inadvertently, avoiding the planned attack. News of the failed plot was leaked.<ref>Fraser, p.426</ref> Protestant politicians such as [[Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex]], [[Algernon Sydney]], [[William Russell, Lord Russell|Lord William Russell]] and the Duke of Monmouth were implicated in the plot. Lord Essex slit his own throat while imprisoned in the Tower of London; Sydney and Russell were executed for high treason on very flimsy evidence; and the Duke of Monmouth went into exile at the court of William of Orange. Lord Danby and the surviving Catholic lords held in the Tower were released and the King's Catholic brother, James, acquired greater influence at court.<ref>Hutton, pp.420<U+2013>423 and Miller ''Charles II'' pp.366<U+2013>368</ref> Titus Oates was convicted and imprisoned for defamation.<ref>Fraser, p.437</ref>

Charles suffered a sudden [[apoplexy|apoplectic fit]] on the morning of 2 February 1685, and died aged 54 at 11:45 a.m. four days later at [[Whitehall Palace]]. The symptoms of his final illness are similar to those of [[uremia|uraemia]] (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction).<ref>Fraser, p.450 and Hutton, p.443</ref> On his deathbed Charles asked his brother, James, to look after his mistresses: "be well to [[Louise de K<U+00E9>rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth|Portsmouth]], and let not poor [[Nell Gwyn|Nelly]] starve",<ref>Fraser, p.456</ref><!--This is a paraphrase used by Fraser--> and told his courtiers: "I am sorry, gentlemen, for being such a time a-dying."<ref name="bryant">Bryant, Mark (2001). ''Private Lives''. London: Cassell. ISBN 0-304-35758-8 p.73</ref> On the last evening of his life he was received into the [[Roman Catholic Church]], though the extent to which he was fully conscious or committed, and with whom the idea originated, is unclear.<ref>Hutton, pp.443 and 456</ref> He was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] "without any manner of pomp"<ref name="bryant"/> on 14 February<ref>Fraser, p.459</ref> and was succeeded by his brother who became [[James II of England]] and Ireland and James VII of Scotland.

== Posterity and legacy ==
[[File:Rhc-charles2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1676 statue of Charles II in ancient Roman dress by [[Grinling Gibbons]] has stood in the Figure Court of the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] since 1692.|alt=Gilt statue]]
Charles had no legitimate children, but acknowledged a dozen by seven mistresses,<ref>Fraser, p.411</ref> including five by the notorious [[Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland|Barbara Villiers, Lady Castlemaine]], for whom the [[Duke of Cleveland|Dukedom of Cleveland]] was created. His other mistresses included [[Moll Davis]], [[Nell Gwyn]], [[Elizabeth Killigrew, Viscountess Shannon|Elizabeth Killigrew]], [[Catherine Pegge]], [[Lucy Walter]], and [[Louise de K<U+00E9>rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth]]. The public resented paying taxes that were spent on them and their children,<ref>Hutton, p.338</ref> many of whom received dukedoms or earldoms. The present [[Duke of Buccleuch|Dukes of Buccleuch]], [[Duke of Richmond|Richmond]], [[Duke of Grafton|Grafton]] and [[Duke of St Albans|St Albans]] descend from Charles in direct male line.<ref>Fraser, p.413</ref> [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], was descended from two of Charles's illegitimate sons: the [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton|Dukes of Grafton]] and [[Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond|Richmond]]. Diana's son, [[Prince William of Wales]], second in line to the British Throne, is likely to be the first monarch descended from Charles II.

Charles's eldest son, the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], led a rebellion against James II, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]] on 6 July 1685, captured and executed. James was eventually dethroned in 1688, in the course of the [[Glorious Revolution]]. He was the last Catholic monarch to rule Britain.

Looking back on Charles's reign, Tories tended to view it as a time of benevolent monarchy whereas Whigs perceived it as a terrible [[despotism]]. Today it is possible to assess Charles without the taint of partisanship, and he is seen as more of a [[lovable rogue]]<U+2014>in the words of his contemporary [[John Evelyn]]: "a prince of many virtues and many great imperfections, debonair, easy of access, not bloody or cruel".<ref>Miller, ''Charles II'' pp.382<U+2013>383</ref> [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]], wrote more lewdly of Charles:
{{quote|<center>Restless he rolls from whore to whore<br />A merry monarch, scandalous and poor.<ref>Quoted in Miller, ''Charles II'' p.95</ref></center>}}

Charles, a patron of the arts and sciences, founded the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] and supported the [[Royal Society]], a scientific group whose early members included [[Robert Hooke]], [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]]. Charles was the personal patron of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]], the architect who helped rebuild London after the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] and who constructed the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], which Charles founded as a home for retired soldiers in 1682.

The anniversary of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] (which was also Charles's birthday)<U+2014>29 May<U+2014>was recognized in England until the mid-nineteenth century as [[Oak Apple Day]], after the Royal Oak in which Charles hid during his escape from the forces of Oliver Cromwell. Traditional celebrations involved the wearing of oak leaves but these have now died out.<ref>Fraser, p.118</ref> Charles II is commemorated by statues in London's [[Soho Square]],<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41027|title=Soho Square Area: Portland Estate: Soho Square Garden|journal=Survey of London|year=1966|pages=Volumes 33 and 34, pp.51<U+2013>53|accessdate=19 April 2010|nopp=true}}</ref> in Edinburgh and near the south portal of [[Lichfield Cathedral]], and is [[Cultural depictions of Charles II of England|depicted extensively in literature and other media]].
