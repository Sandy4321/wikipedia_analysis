He is currently a research fellow at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hoover Institution]].

==Biography==
===Early career===
Conquest was born in [[Great Malvern]], [[Worcestershire]], to an American of independent means and an English mother. His father served in an American Ambulance Service unit with the [[French Army]] in [[World War I]], being awarded the [[Croix de Guerre|Croix de Guerre, with Silver Star]] in 1916.<ref>Supplement to the ''Alumni Register'' (October 1920), "Pennsylvania; A Record of the University's Men in the Great War", University of Pennsylvania General Alumni Society, 1920, page 40.</ref>

Conquest was educated at [[Winchester College]], the [[University of Grenoble]], and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he was an [[exhibitioner]] in modern history and took his bachelor's and master's degrees in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]], and his doctorate in Soviet history. In 1937, after studying at the University of Grenoble, Conquest went up to Oxford, joining both the Carlton Club and, as an "open" member, the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. Fellow members included [[Denis Healey]] and [[Philip Toynbee]]. When [[World War II]] broke out, Conquest joined the [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry]]. In 1942, he married Joan Watkins, with whom he had two sons. In 1943, he was posted to the [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]], where he studied [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] for four months. {{cn|date=September 2013}}

In 1944, Conquest was posted to [[Bulgaria]] as a [[liaison officer]] to the Bulgarian forces fighting under Soviet command, attached to the Third Ukrainian Front, and then to the [[Allied Control Commission]]. There, he met Tatiana Mihailova, who later became his second wife. At the end of the war, he joined the [[Foreign Office]], returning to the British Legation in [[Sofia]]. Witnessing first-hand the communist takeover in Bulgaria, he became completely disillusioned with communist ideas. He left Bulgaria in 1948, helping Tatiana escape the new regime. Back in [[London]], he divorced his first wife and married Tatiana. In 1951, Tatiana Conquest was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], and after many years, in 1962 the couple divorced. {{cn|date=September 2013}}

Conquest joined the Foreign Office's [[Information Research Department]] (IRD), a unit created by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government to "collect and summarize reliable information about Soviet and communist misdoings, to disseminate it to friendly journalists, politicians, and trade unionists, and to support, financially and otherwise, anticommunist publications."<ref>Timothy Garton Ash. "Orwell's List" (review), ''New York Review of Books'', 23 September 2003.</ref>

In 1950 he served briefly as First Secretary in the British Delegation to the United Nations. In 1956, Conquest left the IRD, later becoming a freelance writer and historian. During the 1960s, Conquest edited eight volumes of work produced by the IRD, published in London by [[the Bodley Head]] as the Soviet Studies Series; and in the United States republished as The Contemporary Soviet Union Series by [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Frederick Praeger]], whose U.S. company published, in addition to works by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Milovan <U+0110>ilas]], [[Howard Fast]], and [[Charles Patrick Fitzgerald]], a number of books on communism.<ref>Richard D. Lyons. "Frederick A. Praeger Dies at 78; Published Books on Communism", ''New York Times'', 5 June 1994. </ref>

In 1962<U+2013>63, Conquest was literary editor of ''[[The Spectator (1828)|The Spectator]]'', but resigned when he found it interfered with his historical writing. His first books on the Soviet Union were ''Common Sense About Russia'' (1960), ''The Soviet Deportation of Nationalities'' (1960) and ''Power and Policy in the USSR'' (1961). His other early works on the Soviet Union included ''Courage of Genius: The Pasternak Affair'' (1961) and ''Russia After Khrushchev'' (1965). {{cn|date=September 2013}}

===The Great Terror===
{{Main|The Great Terror}}
In 1968, Conquest published what became his best-known work, ''The Great Terror: Stalin's Purge of the Thirties'', the first comprehensive research of the [[Great Purge]], which took place in the Soviet Union between 1934 and 1939. The book was based mainly on information which had been made public, either officially or by individuals, during the so-called "[[Khrushchev Thaw]]" in the period 1956<U+2013>64. It also drew on accounts by Russian and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[<U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>]]s and [[exile]]s dating back to the 1930s, and on an analysis of official Soviet documents such as the [[Soviet census]]. {{cn|date=September 2013}}

The most important aspect of the book was that it widened the understanding of the purges beyond the previous narrow focus on the "[[Moscow trials]]" of disgraced [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] leaders such as [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]], who were executed after summary show trials. The question of why these leaders had pleaded guilty and confessed to various crimes at the trials had become a topic of discussion for a number of [[Western culture|western]] writers, and had underlain books such as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[Darkness at Noon]]''.
Conquest argued that the trials and executions of these former Communist leaders were a minor detail of the purges. By his estimates, Stalinist famines and purges had led to the deaths of 20 million people. He later stated that the  total number of deaths could "hardly be lower than some thirteen to fifteen million."<ref>Robert Conquest, Preface, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment: 40th Anniversary Edition'', Oxford University Press, USA, 2007. p. xviii</ref>

Conquest criticized western [[intellectual]]s for "blindness" with respect to the [[Soviet Union]], and argued that [[Stalinism]] was a logical consequence of [[Marxism-Leninism]], rather than an aberration from "true" [[communism]]. Conquest did not accept the assertion made by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], and supported by many Western leftists, that [[Joseph Stalin]] and his purges were an aberration from the ideals of the "revolution" and were contrary to the principles of [[Leninism]]. Conquest argued that [[Stalinism]] was a natural consequence of the system established by [[Vladimir Lenin]], although he conceded that the personal character traits of Stalin had brought about the particular horrors of the late 1930s.

Conquest sharply criticized Western intellectuals such as [[Beatrice Webb|Beatrice]] and [[Sidney Webb]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Walter Duranty]], [[Bernard Pares|Sir Bernard Pares]], [[Harold Laski]], [[D. N. Pritt]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Bertold Brecht]]  and [[Romain Rolland]]  for being dupes of Stalin and apologists for his regime, citing various comments they had made denying, excusing, or justifying various aspects of the purges.<ref>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment'', Oxford University Press (1990) ISBN 0-19-507132-8, pp. 466-475.</ref>

After the opening up of the Soviet archives in 1991, detailed information was released that Conquest argued supported his conclusions. When Conquest's publisher asked him to expand and revise ''The Great Terror'', Conquest is famously said to have suggested the new version of the book be titled ''I Told You So, You Fucking Fools.''<ref>Conquest, Robert.
[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2007/apr/12/kingsley-amis-and-the-great-terror "Letter to the Editors"], ''The New York Review of Books'', 12 April 2007.</ref> In fact, the mock title was jokingly proposed by Conquest's old friend, Sir [[Kingsley Amis]]. The new version was published in 1990 as ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment''; ISBN 0-19-507132-8.

Some critics claim that examinations of archives following the USSR's collapse in 1991 challenge many of Conquest's statements. <ref>J. Arch Getty; G<U+00E1>bor T. Rittersporn; Viktor N. Zemskov (Oct 1994). 'Victims of the Soviet Penal System in the Pre-War Years: A First Approach on the Basis of Archival Evidence'. ''The American Historical Review'' 98 (4): 1017<U+2013>1049.</ref> Although some aspects of his work continue to be disputed by those on the left, {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} according to poet Czeslaw Milosz he has been vindicated by history.<ref>"Czeslaw Milosz: 'The Poet Who Was Right'", ''National Review'', 17 August 1992. </ref> [[Michael Ignatieff]] wrote "One of the few unalloyed pleasures of old age is living long enough to see yourself vindicated. Robert Conquest is currently enjoying this pleasure."<ref>Michael Ignatieff. "The Man Who Was Right", ''New York Review of Books'', Vol. 47, No. 5 (23 March 2000).</ref>

===Later works===
In 1986, Conquest published ''The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivisation and the Terror-Famine'', dealing with the collectivization of agriculture in [[Ukraine]] and elsewhere in the USSR, under Stalin's direction in 1929<U+2013>31, and the resulting famine, in which millions of peasants died due to [[starvation]], [[deportation]] to [[labor camp]]s, and execution. In this book, Conquest was even more critical of western left-wing intellectuals than he had been in ''The Great Terror''. He accused them of denying the full scale of the famine, attacking their views as "an intellectual and moral disgrace on a massive scale." He later wrote that the western world had been faced with two different stories about the famine in the 1930s, and accused many intellectuals of believing the false one: "Why did an intellectual stratum overwhelmingly choose to believe the false one? None of this can be accounted for in intellectual terms. To accept information about a matter on which totally contradictory evidence exists, and in which investigation of major disputes on the matter is prevented, is not a rational act." Conquest supported the view that the famine was a planned act of genocide. However, information that became available later convinced Conquest that was wrong and he dismissed his concept of a terror-famine.{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}<ref name=Kulchytskyi>{{cite book|title=Holodomor and Gorta M<U+00F3>r: Histories, Memories and Representations of Famine in Ukraine and Ireland|chapter=Holodomor in Ukraine 1932-1933: An Interpretation of Facts|publisher=Anthem Press|location=New York|year=2012 |pages=21<U+2013>22 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RuP-2C1tDlYC|isbn=978-0-85728-557-7}}</ref>

===Poetry===
In addition to his scholarly work, Conquest is a well-regarded poet<ref>David Yezzi, ''Yale Review'', Volume 98, Issue 2 (April 2010), p. 183 ff.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> whose poems have been published in various periodicals from 1937. In 1945 he was awarded the PEN Brazil Prize for his war poem "For the Death of a Poet"&nbsp;<U+2014> about an army friend, the poet Drummond Allison, killed in Italy <U+2014> and, in 1951, he received a Festival of Britain verse prize.<ref>[http://waywiser-press.com/conquest.html Note on Robert Conquest ].</ref> Since then he has brought out seven volumes of poetry and one of literary criticism.

A major figure in a prominent British literary circle known as [[The Movement (literature)|"The Movement"]] <U+2014> which also included [[Philip Larkin]] and Sir [[Kingsley Amis]] <U+2014> Conquest edited, in 1956 and 1962, the influential ''New Lines'' anthologies, introducing works by them, as well as [[Thom Gunn]], [[Dennis Enright]], and others, to a wider public.<ref>Zachary Leader, ed., ''The Movement Reconsidered'', Oxford University Press, 2009.</ref> He spent 1959-60 as visiting poet at the [[University of Buffalo]]. Several of his poems were published in ''The New Oxford Book of Light Verse'' (1978; compiled by Amis), under the pseudonyms "Stuart Howard-Jones", "Victor Gray" and "Ted Pauker".<ref>John Whitworth. "The Extraordinary Robert Conquest", ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'', October 2009, pp. 121-23.</ref>

Soon after expulsion from the Soviet Union, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn met with Conquest, asking him to translate a <U+2018>little<U+2019> poem of his into English verse. This was "Prussian Nights" <U+2014> nearly two thousand lines in ballad metre <U+2014> published in 1977.<ref>Robert Conquest, 'Solzhenitsyn, A Genius with a Blindspot', ''Sunday Times'', 10 August 2008; p. A15</ref> Conquest has published two novels: one of science fiction, ''A World of Difference'' (1955),  and, co-authored with Amis, ''The Egyptologists'' (1965). {{cn|date=September 2013}}

===Later life===
In 1964, he married Caroleen MacFarlane; this marriage was dissolved in 1978. In 1979, he married Elizabeth Neece Wingate, a lecturer in English and the daughter of a [[United States Air Force]] colonel. In 1981, Conquest moved to [[California]] to take up a post as Senior Research Fellow and Scholar-Curator of the Russian and Commonwealth of Independent States Collection at Stanford University<U+2019>s Hoover Institution, where he remains a Fellow. He has numerous grandchildren from his sons and stepdaughter.

Conquest has been a fellow of the [[Columbia University]]'s Russian Institute, and of the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]; a distinguished visiting scholar at the [[Heritage Foundation]]; a research associate of [[Harvard University]]'s Ukrainian Research Institute; and the presenter of [[Granada Television]]'s seven-part mini-series documentary on the Soviet Union, ''Red Empire'' (1990). {{cn|date=September 2013}}
