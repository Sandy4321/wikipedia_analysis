==Political approach==
''Al Jazirah'' is considered to be very conservative as well as pro-Islamic.<ref name=adl>{{cite web|title=Arab media review. Anti-semitism and other trends|url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/arab/arab-media-review-July-December2010.pdf|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=16 May 2012|date=July-December 2010}}</ref><ref name=censor>{{cite web|title=Censorship in Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.englishessays.org.uk/resources/english-essays/censorship-in-saudi-arabia.php|publisher=English Essays|accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> The paper is also described as pro-government.<ref name=cable>{{cite web|title=The Saudi Press: Profiles of individual papers|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=91RIYADH3320|publisher=Wikileaks|accessdate=17 May 2012|date=6 April 1991}}</ref>

==Circulation==
The paper is said to have a limited circulation and is not widespread in contrast to the other Saudi papers.<ref name=adl/> On the other hand, its owner company, Al Jazirah Company, declares its readership as more than 250,000. The confirmed circulation of the paper is reported to be more than 131,000 copies (June 2008 figures).<ref name=com/> 

Its circulation is given as 93,000 by Western media observers in 2002.<ref name=pr>{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.pressreference.com/Sa-Sw/Saudi-Arabia.html|publisher=Press References|accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref> Its 2007 circulation figure is given to be 110,000 by [[World Association of Newspapers]].<ref name=wan>{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia.

It should also be mentioned that ''Al Jazirah'' is the first Saudi newspaper to announce its circulation figures quoting The National Distribution Company, a third party company owned equally by Saudi newspapers.<ref name=com/> The paper underwent its first circulation audit in November 2009.<ref name=DPC>{{cite web|title=Arab Media Outlook 2009-2013|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/arabmedia.pdf|publisher=Dubai Press Club|accessdate=19 May 2012|year=2010}}</ref> 

In regard to distribution, despite the claim given below that ''Al Jazirah'' is not widespread in comparison to other Saudi dailies, it is widely distributed in [[Saudi Arabia]] and in other [[Arab countries|Arab]] and [[European countries]].<ref name=bbc2006/> [[Global Investment House]] reported the market share of the paper as around 6.0% in November 2009.<ref name=gih>{{cite web|title=Saudi Research and Marketing Group|url=http://mec.biz/term/uploads/SRMG_03112009.pdf|publisher=Global Investment House|accessdate=28 May 2012|date=November 2009}}</ref>

==Influence==
It is argued that ''Al Jazirah'' is one of four leading Saudi daily newspapers. The others are ''[[Al-Watan (Saudi Arabia)|Al Watan]]'', ''[[Al Riyadh (newspaper)|Al Riyadh]]'' and ''[[Al Madina]]''.<ref name=adl/> At the beginning of the 1990s, ''Al Jazirah'' and ''Al Riyadh'' competed against each other to be more influential than the other.<ref name=cable/>

==Content ==
''Al Jazirah'' usually publishes reports and interviews concerning national, Arab and international issues. The paper is mostly  known for its daily supplements on different topics such as economy, sports, culture, computers, medicine and science. It also carries cartoons.<ref name=doingbusiness/><ref name=bbc2006/><ref name=APN/> It also publishes weekly cultural and advertising supplements.<ref name=cityscape>{{cite web|title=Al Jazeera|url=http://www.cityscapeabudhabi.com/_Admin/2012-Exhibitor-List/Al-Jazeera/|publisher=Cityscape|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref> 

The Arab Press Network states that the paper extensively covers the activities of [[House of Saud|the ruling Saudi family]] and involves an uncritical approach towards the government's policies on most of its 60 daily pages. It is further discussed that its columnists and the debate they initiate are both weak.<ref name=APN>{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/newspaysv2.php?id=129|publisher=The Arab Press Network|accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> However, then minister of health [[Ghazi Abdul Rahman Al Gosaibi|Ghazi Al Gosaibi]]'s poem written for King Fahd, entitled <U+201C>A Pen Bought and Sold<U+201D>, was published on the front page of the paper in 1984.<ref name=qantara>{{cite news|last=Labont<U+00E9>|first=Hanna|title=Saudi Man of Letters and Cautious Reformer|url=http://en.qantara.de/Saudi-Man-of-Letters-and-Cautious-Reformer/8370c162/index.html|accessdate=4 September 2012|newspaper=Qantara|date=23 August 2010}}</ref> In the poem, Al Gosaibi indirectly accused the ruling elites, including [[Sultan bin Abdul Aziz|Prince Sultan]], then Minister of Defence, of corruption and Saudi Oger of improper tender activities regarding the public hospitals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abir|first=Mordechai|title=The Consolidation of the Ruling Class and the New Elites in Saudi Arabia|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=April 1987|volume=23|issue=2|pages=150<U+2013>171|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4283169|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=btimes3010/> King Fahd fired him after reading the poem.<ref name=btimes3010>{{cite news|title=Saudi reformer courted the king's attention with a poem|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/obituaries/saudi-reformer-courted-the-kings-attention-with-a-poem-20100829-13xia.html|accessdate=4 September 2012|newspaper=Brisbane Times|date=30 August 2010}}</ref>

On 3 and 10 January 2002, a commentary by Dr. Muhammad bin Sa<U+2018>d al Shuway<U+2018>ir was published in the paper. The commentary was entitled <U+201C>Why Pork Is Forbidden?<U+201D>. The author said that the transformation of [[Jews|the Jews]] into [[apes]] and [[pigs]] was a punishment <U+201C>because monkeys and pigs were considered among the lowliest of animals, in nature and manners.<U+201D> He further stated that Jews always represent the human lowness, as expressed in [[Quran]].<ref name=roth>{{cite web|title=Arab countries 2003-4|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2003-4/arab.htm|publisher=Stephen Roth Institute|accessdate=16 May 2012|year=2003}}</ref> Jasser Abdulaziz al Jasser, a columnist of ''Al Jazirah'', criticised [[Russia]], especially [[Sergey Lavrov]], for supporting Assad regime's [[Alawite]] minority rule over a [[Sunni]] majority in [[Syria]] on 24 March 2012. Al Jasser argued that the same tactics used by Russia to oppress Muslim majority in [[Chechnya]] and the [[Caucasus]] were employed by Assad to oppress Sunni majority in Syria.<ref name=memriapr12>{{cite web|last=Varulkar|first=H.|title=Rising Tensions between Saudi Arabia, Russia on Backdrop of Syrian Crisis|url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/189/0/6246.htm|publisher=MEMRI|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=Inquiry and Analysis Series Report No.820|date=4 April 2012}}</ref> ''Al Jazirah'''s front page on 17 June 2012 was entirely in black and white, showing photographs of [[King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] and [[Crown Prince Nayef]] who died in [[Geneva]] on 16 June 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=McDowall|first=Angus|title=Saudi king to bury Crown Prince, find successor|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/17/us-saudi-crownprince-idUSBRE85F05Z20120617|accessdate=17 June 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=17 June 2012}}</ref>

==Controversy==
In September 2008, a reporter of the paper, Fahd al Jukhaidib, wrote an article in which he described frequent power cuts in [[Qubba]] in northern Saudi Arabia. The article also informed the readers about a protest in front of the government-owned electricity company as a result of power cuts experienced. Upon publication of his article, he was  sentenced in October 2008 to two months in prison and 50 lashes for inciting the public to protest against a series of electric power reductions. He was free on appeal in 2009.<ref name=cpj2011>{{cite web|title=Attacks on the Press 2010: Middle East and North Africa Developments|url=http://cpj.org/2011/02/attacks-on-the-press-2010-middle-east-north-africa-developments.php|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists (CPR)|accessdate=19 May 2012|date=February 2011}}</ref>

==Innovation==
''Al Jazirah'' seems not to be conservative in terms of using technology to provide advanced technological platforms to its readers. It is the first daily paper in [[the Middle East]] to lunch mobile phone application. It is also the first Saudi daily in launching online web site that was formed in 1996.<ref name=com/> In addition to these technological innovations, ''Al Jazirah'' is also innovative in launching first online women<U+2019>s daily covering female achievements in [[Saudi Arabia]], latest developments and other topics related to women.<ref name=emir>{{cite news|title=Saudi Arabia to have first online 'women' daily|url=http://www.emirates247.com/news/region/saudi-arabia-to-have-first-online-women-daily-2011-09-27-1.420806|accessdate=16 May 2012|newspaper=Emirates 7/24|date=27 September 2011}}</ref>
