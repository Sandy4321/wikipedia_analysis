'''Canadian heraldry''' is the cultural tradition and style of [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] and other [[Heraldry|heraldic]] achievements in modern and historic [[Canada]], including national, provincial, and civic arms, [[nobility|noble]] and personal arms, [[ecclesiastical heraldry]], heraldic displays as corporate [[logo]]s, and Canadian [[Blazon|heraldic descriptions]].

Derived mainly from heraldic traditions in [[French heraldry|France]] and the [[Heraldry#Gallo-British heraldry|United Kingdom]], Canadian heraldry also incorporates distinctly [[National symbols of Canada|Canadian symbols]], especially native flora and fauna, references to the [[First Nations]] and other [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] peoples of Canada, and uniquely Canadian elements such as the [[Canadian pale]], derived from the [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]]. A unique system of [[cadency]] is used for daughters inheriting arms, and a special symbol for [[United Empire Loyalist]]s. 

In 1988, governance of both personal and corporate heraldry in Canada was patriated from the heraldic authorities in [[College of Arms|England]] and [[Court of the Lord Lyon|Scotland]] with the formation of the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]], which now has exclusive jurisdiction over granting awards of arms in Canada. Coats of arms are used throughout Canada by all levels of government, in many cases including royal insignia as a mark of authority, as in the recently granted arms of the House of Commons and the Senate, and of Parliament as a combined body. Use of armorial bearings is not limited to governmental bodies; all citizens of Canada have the right to petition for an award of arms, as do other entities including businesses and religious institutions.

The history of heraldry in Canada began with the raising of the [[Coat of Arms of France|Royal Arms of France]] by French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1534, when he landed on Canadian soil at what is now known as the [[Gasp<U+00E9> Peninsula]].<ref name="Royal Heraldry Society of Canada History">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldry.ca/top_en/top_historyHer.htm|publisher=Royal Heraldry Society of Canada|title=The History of Heraldry in Canada|date=28 April 2004|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> From the beginning of the [[History of Canada|settlement]] of Canada until the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, armorial bearings were largely either brought from France or awarded by the [[List of French monarchs|French crown]].

Before the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the [[United Kingdom]]: either the [[College of Arms]] in [[London]] or, if of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent, the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] in [[Edinburgh]].<ref name="Canadian Heraldic Authority-Creation"/> This process was quite lengthy<U+2014>and costly.

The use of armorial bearings among [[:Category:Canadian municipal coats of arms|Canadian cities]] is inconsistent, because many of them have been assumed and brought into force by local governmental authorities, rather than granted from the Crown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldry.ca/top_en/top_misconceptions.htm|publisher=Royal Heraldry Society of Canada|title=Common Misconceptions|accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> Many municipal coats of arms either awarded or confirmed by the Canadian Heraldic Authority may be found within the [[Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada|Public Register of Arms]], though the online version of the Register is not complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/faq_e.asp |title=The Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada - Heraldry |publisher=Governor General of Canada |date=2007-03-26 |accessdate=2010-10-28}}</ref>

== Unique Canadian elements and practices ==
=== Aboriginal and First Nations symbolism ===
Due to the history of Canada, heraldry in the country has incorporated aboriginal and [[First Nations]] symbols and elements.<ref name="Canadian Heraldic Authorityteach">{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/visitus/pdf/Heraldry-Kit-EN.pdf|page= 20|title=Canadian Heraldic Authority - Teacher's Kit (Heraldry in Canada)|publisher=Canadian Heraldic Authority|accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> The [[Coat of Arms of Nunavut]],<ref name="Nunavutsymbols"/> for example, includes elements such as an [[inukshuk]], a [[qulliq]], and an [[igloo]], all of which are references to the [[Inuit]] peoples who live in the area,<ref name="nunavut1">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.nu.ca/en/Flag.aspx|title=Facts about Nunavut|publisher=Government of Nunavut|accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref><ref name="ggnunavut1">{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/heraldry/emb/02/index_e.asp|title=Creation of the Coat of Arms and Flag of Nunavut|date=2005-12-06 |publisher=Governor-General of Canada|accessdate=2008-10-01|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080616212224/http://www.gg.ca/heraldry/emb/02/index_e.asp |archivedate = June 16, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> while the arms of the Canadian Heraldic Authority include [[raven]]s, a First Nations symbol of creation and transformation.<ref name="Canadian Heraldic Authority-Process" />

=== Cadency ===
{{Main|Cadency}}

In most systems of heraldry, each unique coat of arms is restricted to a single person. To differentiate identical arms, a system known as cadency was developed, possibly by [[John Writhe]] in 1500<ref name="ukcollege1">{{cite web|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/About/12.htm|title=The Law of Arms: The descent of arms|date=2004-04-10|publisher=College of Arms|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref> (though other sources argue that systems of cadency were in use as much as two centuries prior<ref>{{cite web|last=Humphery-Smith|first=Cecil R.|url=http://www.britishancestry.org/articles.php?year=2003&month=8&id=12 |title=Articles |publisher=British Ancestry |date=2003-08-27 |accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref>) which adds a mark known as a ''brisure'' to the plain coat of arms<ref name="glosscadency">{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=James|last2=Gough|first2=Henry|title=A Glossary of Terms Used in Heraldry|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/aglossarytermsu08parkgoog#page/n117/mode/1up|accessdate=2010-10-30|year=1894|publisher=James Parker & Co.|location=Oxford and London|page=85}}</ref>. Most nations have cadences defined (either officially or through convention) only for male children who inherit otherwise identical arms; Canada has a unique series of cadences for use by female children who inherit arms. As in other heraldic systems, these cadency marks are not always used,<ref name="Royal Heraldry Society of Canada-Cadency">{{cite web|url=http://education.heraldry.ca/course_canadian.htm|publisher=Royal Heraldry Society of Canada|title=Heraldry Examination|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref> though when they are used, the cadences of the heir (in Canada, the first child, whether male or female, according to strict [[primogeniture]]) are removed once the holder dies and the plain coat of arms is inherited.<ref name="hersocscot">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldry-scotland.co.uk/beginners.html |title=Beginners Heraldry, The Heraldry Society of Scotland - UK Heraldry |publisher=The Heraldry Society of Scotland |date=2005-04-17 |accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref>

=== Charges, ordinaries, and divisions of the field ===
The Canadian [[Pale (heraldry)|pale]], a pale division amounting to half the entire field, derived from the [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]], is widely used in Canadian heraldry, while the Canadian [[fess]], a similar horizontal division, has been used once.<ref name="RHSC-def-C">{{cite web|url=http://education.heraldry.ca/dictionary/c/c.htm |title=Royal Heraldry Society of Canada Canadian Heraldic Dictionary: C-index |publisher=Royal Heraldry Society of Canada |date=2008-11-18|accessdate=2010-10-02}}</ref><ref name="heraldry1">{{cite web|author=ICE: Webmaster |url=http://education.heraldry.ca/course_innovations.htm |title=RHSC Heraldry Examination |publisher=Royal Heraldry Society of Canada |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref> The term ''<U+00E9>rabl<U+00E9>'', referring to maple leaves, is often used in Canadian arms.

== Obtaining arms ==
{{see also|Canadian Heraldic Authority#Grant process|l1=Grant Process}}

All citizens of Canada, as well as corporate bodies, may petition the Crown for an award of arms.<ref name="Canadian Heraldic Authority-Process" /> The process for non-armigerous people to obtain arms is relatively simple. For an individual to obtain a grant of arms, a petition must be sent to the [[Chief Herald of Canada|Chief Herald]], providing a biography, references, and completed application forms. If the grant is approved, the individual then consults with heralds from the Authority to work out the design of their award. Upon completion of this process, the grant documents, in the form of letters patent, are created and provided to the grantee. The entire process is subject to certain fees required by the [[Government of Canada]] to cover costs of research and artwork; the fees are not to purchase the grant of arms. For [[corporation]]s and institutions the process is similar.<ref name="Canadian Heraldic Authority-Process" />

Those individuals and institutions who are already armigerous through recognised heraldic authorities worldwide may apply to the Canadian Heraldic Authority to have their arms registered. There is no cost associated with application for registration, and it takes less time, approximately three months,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gg.ca/document.aspx?id=84 |title=The Governor General of Canada - FAQ |publisher=Governor General of Canada |date= |accessdate=2010-10-28}}</ref> than application for a new award of arms, which takes approximately twelve to fourteen months.<ref name="Canadian Heraldic Authority-Process" />
