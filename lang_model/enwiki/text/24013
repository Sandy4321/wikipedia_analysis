'''''Meerkat Manor''''' is a British [[television program]]me produced by [[Oxford Scientific Films]] for [[Animal Planet|Animal Planet International]] that premiered in September 2005 and ran for four series until its cancellation in August 2008. Blending more traditional animal [[documentary film|documentary]] style footage with [[Dramatic programming|dramatic]] narration, the series told the story of the Whiskers, one of more than a dozen families of [[meerkat]]s in the [[Kalahari Desert]] being studied as part of the [[Kalahari Meerkat Project]], a long-term [[field study]] into the ecological causes and evolutionary consequences of the cooperative nature of meerkats. The original programme was narrated by [[Bill Nighy]], with the narration redubbed by [[Mike Goldman]] for the Australian airings and [[Sean Astin]] for the American broadcasts. The fourth series, subtitled ''The Next Generation'', saw [[Stockard Channing]] replacing Astin as the narrator in the American dubbing.<ref name="TNG">{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/04212008/tv/heres_a_stock_tip_107486.htm |title=Starr Report |first=Michael |last=Starr |publisher=[[New York Post]] |date=21 April 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2008 }}</ref>

''Meerkat Manor'' premiered in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2005, and the first 13-episode series concluded on 24 October 2005. With the success of the programme in the United Kingdom, Animal Planet started broadcasting it on its national channels in Australia, Canada, and the US. It has since been rebroadcast in more than 160 other countries.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Primetime Emmy Nominations for Meerkat Manor |publisher=Southern Star |date=21 August 2007 |url=http://www.oxfordscientificfilms.tv/NewsDetails.aspx?niid=1580&d=2|accessdate=31 October 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070830052224/http://www.oxfordscientificfilms.tv/NewsDetails.aspx?niid=1580&d=2 |archivedate=August 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The fourth, and final, series aired initially in the United States from 6 June 2008 to 22 August 2008; it aired in the United Kingdom in April 2009.<ref name="TNG" /><ref name="APListings">{{cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/tv-schedules/series.html?paid=15.14587.122407.34316.x |title=TV Listings: Meerkat Manor |publisher=[[Animal Planet]] |accessdate=6 June 2008 }}</ref><ref name="APListings4">{{cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/tv-schedules/series.html?paid=15.15570.122407.29078.x&start=20 |title=TV Listings: Meerkat Manor |publisher=[[Animal Planet]] |accessdate=5 August 2008 }}</ref> In August 2009, it was reported that the programme had been cancelled.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09219/989070-238.stm |title=TV Q&A with Rob Owen |first=Rob |last=Owen |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |publisher=[[PG Publishing]] |date=7 August 2009 |accessdate=7 August 2009 }}</ref>

Although the show faced criticism from viewers for not intervening when a meerkat was injured and faced death, as a whole ''Meerkat Manor'' enjoyed considerable success and was Animal Planet's top series in October 2007, both on the cable channel and through its video-on-demand service. The show's experimental format broke new ground in animal documentary filming techniques and allowed viewers a long term, intimate look into the lives of its meerkat stars, breaking the traditional wall between viewer and subject found with most documentaries. In 2007, ''Meerkat Manor'' was nominated for two [[Primetime Emmy Awards]]. It has won three awards at the 2006 Omni Awards, and at the 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals Award Galas. The first three series of the programme have been released to DVD in both [[Region 1]] and [[Region 2]]. In 2007, a book entitled ''Meerkat Manor <U+2013> The Story of Flower of the Kalahari'' was released in the UK, detailing the life of Flower and the Whiskers before the series filming began. A television film, ''[[Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins]]'' documenting Flower's birth and rise to matriarch of the Whiskers aired on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008.

== Production details ==
''Meerkat Manor'' was created by Caroline Hawkins, executive producer and series editor at Oxford Scientific Films, and commissioned for [[Animal Planet|Animal Planet International]] by executive producer and commissioning editor Mark Wild.<ref name="OSFKeyPersonnel">{{cite web|title=Key Personnel - Southern Star Group |publisher=Southern Star |url=http://www.oxfordscientificfilms.tv/productionhome.aspx?cid=26 |accessdate=11 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070830045509/http://www.oxfordscientificfilms.tv/productionhome.aspx?cid=26 |archivedate = August 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Animal Planet Begins Production on Third Season of Meerkat Manor |publisher=World Screen |date=12 March 2007 |url=http://www.worldscreen.com/articles/display/10639 |accessdate=7 November 2007 }}</ref> Filming for a 13-episode series took seven to eight months, and was limited to the Kalahari spring and summer seasons, as meerkats are less active during winter.<ref name="AllInfo">{{cite web |title=''Meerkat Manor'' Season 3 |publisher=All Info About Family Screen Scene |url=http://www.allinfoaboutfamilyscreenscene.com/Animals_and_Nature/Meerkat_Manor.html |accessdate=10 December 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071212005342/http://www.allinfoaboutfamilyscreenscene.com/Animals_and_Nature/Meerkat_Manor.html |archivedate = December 12, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref name="WashingtonPostChat" /> Series three was filmed from November 2006 through April 2007, and Series four began filming in October 2007.<ref name="APLiveChat">{{cite web |title=Transcript from September 28's Live Chat with Mick Kaczorowski the senior executive producer of the US version of ''Meerkat Manor'' |publisher=Discovery Channel | work=Meerkat Manor Fan Site |url=http://animal.discovery.com/fansites/meerkat/flower/transcript.html |accessdate=10 December 2007 }}</ref> Most scenes were filmed on location at the Kuruman River Reserve, where the [[Kalahari Meerkat Project]] that the meerkats are a part of is based. However, the meerkats seen in commercials and on the show's website were not the same animals portrayed in ''Meerkat Manor''. Instead, tamer rescued meerkats from the Fellow Earthlings Wildlife Center were filmed against a [[Chroma key|green screen]].<ref name="FellowEarthlings">{{cite web |title=Paw Prints, Newsletter, July 2007 edition |publisher=The Voice of Fellow Earthlings' Wildlife Center |author=Denise A.

[[Image:Filming Meerkat Manor.jpg|thumb|left|Robin Smith finds himself surrounded by foraging meerkats while filming them]]

The show was primarily filmed using [[Sony]] DSR570 cameras, although special equipment was needed for some unique footage. For scenes inside the animals' [[burrow]]s, mini [[fiber-optic|fibre-optic]] [[infra-red]] cameras were employed; wide-angle shots were filmed with a seven-metre crane and a remote-controlled camera platform.<ref name="FilmingMM" /><ref name="APFilming" /> An off-camera wireless microphone was also used to record many meerkat vocalizations, only partially audible to cameras' on-board systems.<ref name="FilmingMM" /> Most filming was done by a single cameraman and a single sound engineer; researchers have required a minimal human presence to avoid stressing the animals.<ref name="WashingtonPostChat" /> Eye-level shots were difficult to achieve at times, due to the meerkats' small size and the limited height of even the smallest tripods.<ref name="FilmingMM">{{cite web |title=Filming Meerkat Manor |publisher=The International Association of Wildlife Film-Makers |url=http://www.iawf.org.uk/index.aspx?page=2&articleid=1005 |author=John Brown | date=3 June 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2007 }}</ref> 

For tracking purposes by the researchers, the dominant female of each group is fitted with a radio collar, as are some dominant and roaming males. The meerkats <U+2013> especially younger animals <U+2013> are marked with dye to differentiate them.<ref name="WashingtonPostChat" /> As the meerkats are habituated, they would tend to ignore the camera crew as long as their "personal space" was respected.<ref name="FilmingMM" /> 

=== National variations ===
The UK and US versions of the show have the same content for most episodes; however, the latter was sometimes edited for length to allow for more commercial breaks. Content was also sometimes altered; mating scenes in particular were often removed. Animal Planet US occasionally changed the names of meerkats and episode titles.<ref name="WashingtonPostChat" /> Two of Flower's pups were renamed from Ren and Stumpy to Len and Squiggy; the title of the episode was also changed.<ref name="APUKEpGuide">{{cite web |url=http://www.animalplanet.co.uk/meerkat_manor/html/episode/index.shtml |title=''Meerkat Manor'' Episode Guide |publisher=Animal Planet UK |accessdate=13 November 2008}}</ref><ref name="APUSEpGuide" /><ref name="KC Interview" /> De la Soul (named for the [[De La Soul|rap group]] of the same name), one of the sisters who started the Starsky group, was renamed Whoopi in the US as a tribute to actress [[Whoopi Goldberg]], an early fan of the series.<ref name="APUKEpGuide" /><ref name="APUSEpGuide">{{cite web| url=http://animal.discovery.com/fansites/meerkat/episode/episode.html |title=''Meerkat Manor'' Episode Guide|publisher=Animal Planet US |accessdate=30 December 2007}}</ref> Animal Planet US has also renamed some of Flower's pups born in season three to honour two other famous fans of the show, [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Denis Leary]].<ref name="WashingtonPostChat" /> Several episodes were renamed: the title of the final episode of the second series was changed from "The Killing Fields" to "The Quiet Fields".<ref name="APUSEpGuide" /><ref name="APUKEpGuide" /> During the third series, the third episode's title was changed from "Something's Got to Give" to "Sister Act" (another Goldberg [[Sister Act|reference]]), while the sixth episode's title changed from "The House of Zappa" to "Sibling Rivalry".<ref name="APUSEpGuide" /><ref name="APUKEpGuide" />

Animals in neighbouring groups were highlighted in each series as well.<ref name="WashingtonPostChat" /> In the first series, a group called the Lazuli were shown frequently in competition with the Whiskers family, and the opening credits referred to them as the "neighbours from hell".<ref name="Ep01" /> Although their dominant male [[List of Meerkat Manor meerkats#Big Si|Big Si]] died between series, the Lazuli appeared in the second series, mostly as a source of roving males.<ref name="Ep2.1">{{cite episode |title=Cold Comfort |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |seriesno=2 |number=2.1 }}</ref><ref name="Ep2.3" /> Another group called the Commandoes, led by a one-eyed male named Hannibal, introduced themselves by attacking the Lazuli burrow, killing a pup and badly wounding the babysitting adult.

While the show portrays real events among the Kalahari Meerkats, it also removes repetitive elements of the animals' lives. Because many days are filled with behaviour related to grooming and foraging, these routines were often left out of the show in favour of more unusual events.<ref name="KMPFAQ">{{cite web| title=KMP meerkats FAQ | date=11 November 2007 |publisher=Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project |url=http://friends.kalahari-meerkats.com/index.php?id=faq_kmp-meerkats | accessdate=21 December 2007}}</ref>

The meerkats are all named by Kalahari Meerkat volunteers; the individual who first sees a new litter emerge from the burrow is awarded naming rights. This has produced a variety of names, frequently drawn from volunteers' favourite books, movies, musical groups, family and friends, historical figures and geographical locations.<ref name="KMPFAQ" /> Animal Planet sometimes renamed the meerkats for narration, arguing that researchers' names  were too limited, often relating to spices and food condiments.<ref name="WashingtonPostChat" /><ref name="KC Interview" /> Because of these changes, fans of the series who seek information on the Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project website sometimes have trouble locating particular animals. The project has created a list of alterations to help viewers connect the animals on the show to their real-life counterparts, and to match episodes to the monthly KMP Life History reports. The list, however, is only available to paying members of their website.<ref>{{cite web | title=Meerkat Manor - Backstage | date=23 November 2007 |publisher=Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project |url=http://friends.kalahari-meerkats.com/index.php?id=mm_background | accessdate=21 December 2007}}</ref><ref name="KMPFAQ" />

Two of the major Whiskers family rivals were composites, created with footage and blended stories from multiple groups. For example, the Commandoes group on the show uses some of events from the real Commandoes group, but was primarily shown with footage from the Vivian research group <U+2013> including its dominant couple.<ref name="KalahariFP" /> Similarly, the show's Zappa group was mostly presented using footage from a group called the "The Young Ones" (named after the [[The Young Ones (TV series)|British television show]]); however, the actual story and dominant couple were from the real Zappa Group.<ref name="KalahariFP">{{cite web | title=Friends packages | date=14 October 2007 | url=http://friends.kalahari-meerkats.com/index.php?id=105 |publisher=Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project | accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref><ref name="CurrentGroups" /> Axel, the abandoned pup from series three, has a research number that indicates he was probably a Young Ones pup, rather than being a Zappa as the show claims.<ref name="ListOfNames">{{cite web |title=List of Meerkat Names for 2007 |publisher=Kalahari Meerkat Project |url=http://friends.kalahari-meerkats.com/fileadmin/files/LH_reports/List_Meerkat_names_2007.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=10 December 2007 }}</ref>

== Reception ==
''Meerkat Manor'' has been well received by viewers and critics alike. In October 2007, it was Animal Planet's top series, with an audience of more than four million in the United States alone.<ref name="NewYorkTimes">{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/arts/television/10bell.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title='The Desert Has Lost Its Favorite Rose': Death Comes to the Whiskers Family |accessdate=28 October 2007 |last=Bellafante |first=Ginia |authorlink=Ginia Bellafante |date=10 October 2007 |publisher=The New York Times }}</ref> In the United States, its first episode was viewed by one million viewers, and the second and third series premieres were watched by approximately 800,000 viewers each. The fourth series premiere did not fare as well, with fewer than 500,000 viewers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/10/AR2008061003312.html |title=There Were Those Who Dunk and Those Who Stunk |first=Lisa |last=de Moraes |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=11 June 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2008 }}</ref> The viewership of the [[on-demand]] video offerings for ''Meerkat Manor'' grew 20% in September 2007, when Discovery offered each third series episode, video capsules of series one and two, top ten moments from the show, and a memorial sequence for Flower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6499382.html?industryid=47200 |title=Short-Form Content Drives Discovery VOD Gains |accessdate=21 November 2007 |last=Reynolds |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Reynolds |date=9 November 2007 |publisher=The New York Multichannel News}}</ref> Building on the success of ''Meerkat Manor's'' unique format, Animal Planet commissioned two similarly formatted programmes: ''[[Orangutan Island]]'', which focuses on a group of orphaned [[orangutan]]s at the Nyaru Menteng Orangutan Rescue and Rehabilitation Center, and ''[[Lemur Street]]'', which looks at the lives of two rival gangs of [[ring-tailed lemur]]s in [[Madagascar]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Orangutan Island: About the Show |publisher=Animal Planet |url=http://animal.discovery.com/tv/orangutan-island/about/about.html |accessdate=10 December 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Production Programmes |publisher=Oxford Scientific Films |url=http://www.oxfordscientificfilms.tv/DynamicPage.aspx?cid=27&d=8 |accessdate=10 December 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070830045708/http://www.oxfordscientificfilms.tv/DynamicPage.aspx?cid=27&d=8 |archivedate = August 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Some fans have criticized the show for its non-interference policy with regard to the meerkats, asking why the film crew and researchers do not give [[anti-venom]] to snake-bitten meerkats, or [[Animal euthanasia|euthanize]] those dying and suffering.<ref name="NewYorkTimes" /> US Executive Producer Mick Kaczorowski pointed out that ''Meerkat Manor'' was a show about the real lives and deaths of the meerkats. The research group has a policy against film crews interceding in natural events "because they don't want to have an effect on the gene pool by saving a weaker meerkat [or] affecting the outcome of what's natural in the Kalahari."<ref name="APLiveChat" /> As the research project is monitoring "...the breeding success and survival of individuals and ... the factors that effect reproduction and survival" interfering in the natural processes would render the research results invalid.<ref name="KMPFAQ" /> There is one exception to this rule: researchers will euthanize meerkats that contract [[tuberculosis]], to prevent outbreaks that would threaten both the meerkat population and nearby cattle.<ref name="APLiveChat" /><ref name="KMPFAQ" />

=== Awards ===
''Meerkat Manor'' was nominated for a 2005 Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival Award in the "Animal Behaviour" category, and in 2007 for "Best Original Score".<ref name="OSFAwards" /> At the 2006 [[Wildscreen Festival]], the series was a finalist in three categories: "Animal Behaviour", "Innovation", and "Popular Broadcast".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildscreenfestival.org/index.php?pageid=223&parentid=2 |title=Wildscreen 2006 Finalist Films |publisher=Wildscreen Festival |accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref><ref name="OSFAwards" /> The series won Gold Statues in "Natural History" and "Cinematography", and a Silver Statue for "Writing", at the 2006 Omni Awards.<ref name="OSFAwards" /> The eight episode of series three, "Journey's End" which depicts the death of Whiskers matriarch Flower, was awarded the 2008 Wildscreen Festival Panda Award in the "Five Award for Popular Broadcast Programme" category.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildscreenfestival.org/index.php?pageid=308&parentid=256 |title=2008 Winners |publisher=Wildscreen Festival |accessdate=3 February 2009 }}</ref> ''Meerkat Manor'' was a two-time Gold Medal winner in the "Nature & Wildlife" category at the New York Festivals Award Gala, in 2006 for series one, and again in 2007 for series one and two.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkfestivals.com/main.taf?p=3,3,2 |title=TV Programming & Promotion Showcase |publisher=International Awards Group |work=New York Festivals |accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref><ref name="OSFAwards">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordscientificfilms.tv/DynamicPage.aspx?cid=28&d=8 |title=OSF Award Winning Productions |publisher=Southern Star Group |accessdate=13 January 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070830050444/http://www.oxfordscientificfilms.tv/DynamicPage.aspx?cid=28&d=8 |archivedate = August 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The series was nominated for two [[59th Primetime Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 2007: one for "Outstanding Cinematography for Nonfiction Programming" and one for "Outstanding Picture Editing for Nonfiction Programming".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.tv/awards/2007pt/59pte_nomsummary.php |title=The 59th Primetime Emmy Awards Nominations Summary |publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences |accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref><ref name="OSFAwards" /> In 2009 the series was awarded the Grand Award at the [[New York Festivals]] International Television Programming and Promotion Awards in the "Family Programmes" category.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkfestivals.com/res/pdf/2009TVWINNERS.pdf |format=pdf |title=2009 Teelvision Programming and Promotion Awards Winners Credits |publisher=[[New York Festivals]] |accessdate=5 February 2009}}</ref>

=== Impact on the genre ===
''Meerkat Manor's'' innovative new methods of filming allowed the Kalahari Project scientists a chance to uncover aspects of meerkat life never before seen, including life within the burrows. The film crew was also the first to capture meerkat [[Infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]] on film.<ref name="APFilming">{{cite web |title=''Meerkat Manor'' - The Cast and Crew |publisher=Animal Planet |url=http://www.animalplanet.co.uk/meerkat_manor/html/cast_crew/thecrew.shtml |accessdate=10 December 2007 }}</ref> 

While many documentaries maintain an emotional distance from their subjects, ''Meerkat Manor'' <U+2013> due to its extended length, soap opera like narration, romanticization of the animals' lives, and close-up filming techniques, provides a closer, more personal view of the meerkats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/tv/336878_tv26.html?source=rss |title=Why is 'Meerkat' tragedy so tough to take? It's personal |accessdate=28 October 2007 |last=McFarland |first=Melanie |date=25 October 2007 |publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref> Viewers describe being emotionally involved in the animals' lives, sometimes forgetting they are watching a documentary. The meerkats' frequently short lives and brutal deaths become surprising and disturbing to some audiences. This experimental format was seen as expanding the boundaries of both the nature [[Documentary film|documentary]] genre and the nature of reality TV.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/10022007/life05.html |title=Tributes to the passing of a meerkat matriarch |accessdate=28 October 2007 |last=Smith

{{quote|Like the meerkats, ''Manor'' is an odd beast. The crew is forbidden to intervene, and the producers don't sugarcoat the animals' less cuddly habits (infidelity, abandonment of young, occasional cannibalism). But the meerkats are named and given human traits ("courageous," "caring," "bully[ing]"), and their antics and tragedies take place over a sound track. Manor is both brutal and melodramatic and thus more devastating than most documentary or scripted drama.|James Poniewozik|''[[Time Magazine]]'', 2 November 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1680162,00.html |title=Looks like Meerkat Love |accessdate=21 November 2007 |last=Poniewozik |first=James |date=2 November 2007 |publisher=Time Magazine}}</ref> }}

The film included re-edited footage and a new musical score. The Whiskers story was simplified, with the [[List of Meerkat Manor meerkats#Lazuli|Lazuli]] being the only rival group to appear in the film. Unlike with the ''Meerkat Manor'' series, the film does not actually depict any of the real Whiskers meerkats. Untrained "meerkats actors" play the role of Flower and her family, with the camera crew searching out appropriately aged meerkats, then following them until the meerkats acted in a way that was needed for the film. Flower herself was depicted by approximately eight female meerkats.<ref name="KC Interview">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovery.com/meerkat_manor/ |title=Get Ready for More Desert Drama (Official Discovery Blogs interview) |first=Sarah |last=Grace McCandless |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |work=Kalahari Confidential |date=22 May 2008 |accessdate=25 May 2008 }}</ref>
