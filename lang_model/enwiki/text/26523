'''Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n''' was an independent country situated in the northwest region of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It was founded in 910 AD when the Christian princes of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] along the [[Bay of Biscay|northern coast of the peninsula]] shifted their main seat from [[Oviedo]] to the city of [[Le<U+00F3>n, Spain|Le<U+00F3>n]]. The Atlantic provinces became the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] in 1139, and the eastern, inland part of the kingdom was joined to the [[Kingdom of Castile]] by 1230.

From 1296 to 1301, the Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n was again independent and after the union with Castile kept as a Kingdom until 1833, latterly as part of united [[Spain]]. By the R.D. of 30 November 1833, the Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n was considered one of the Spanish regions and divided into the provinces of [[province of Le<U+00F3>n|Le<U+00F3>n]], [[province of Zamora|Zamora]] and [[province of Salamanca|Salamanca]]. In 1978, the Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n was included with six provinces from the Old Castile in the Autonomous Community of Castile and Le<U+00F3>n.

== Background ==
The city of [[Le<U+00F3>n, Spain|Le<U+00F3>n]] was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Seventh [[Roman Legion|Legion]] (usually written as [[Legio VII Gemina|Legio Septima Gemina]] ("twin seventh legion"). It was the headquarters of that legion in the [[Roman empire|late empire]] and was a centre for trade in [[gold]], which was mined at Las M<U+00E9>dulas nearby. In 540, the city was conquered by the [[Arianism|Arian]] [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Liuvigild]], who did not harass the already well-established [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] population. In 717 AD, Le<U+00F3>n fell again, this time to the [[Moors]]. However, Le<U+00F3>n was one of the first cities retaken during the Christian [[Reconquista|reconquest]] of the Iberian peninsula, and became part of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] in 742 AD.

Le<U+00F3>n was a small town during this time, but one of the few former Roman cities in the Kingdom of Asturias which still held significance (the surviving Roman walls bear the medieval walling upon them). During Visigothic times, the city had served as a [[Diocese|bishopric]], and incorporating the city into Asturias brought legitimacy to the Asturian monarchs who sought to lead a unified Iberian church, during a time when most of the Iberian Peninsula was governed by [[Muslim]] powers.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
Le<U+00F3>n was created as a separate kingdom when the Asturian king, [[Alfonso the Great]], divided his realm among his three sons. Le<U+00F3>n was inherited by [[Garc<U+00ED>a I of Le<U+00F3>n|Garc<U+00ED>a I]] (911<U+2013>914). His successor was [[Ordo<U+00F1>o II of Le<U+00F3>n]] (914<U+2013>924), who moved the capital of the kingdom of Astures to Le<U+00F3>n.

Ordo<U+00F1>o II of Le<U+00F3>n was also a military leader who brought military expeditions from Le<U+00F3>n south to [[Seville]], [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Spain|C<U+00F3>rdoba]], and [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]], in the heart of the Muslim territory.

After a few years of civil wars during the reign of [[Fruela II]], [[Alfonso Froilaz]] and [[Alfonso IV of Leon|Alfonso IV]], [[Ramiro II of Leon|Ramiro II]] (931<U+2013>951) assumed the throne and brought stability to the kingdom. A brave military chief who defeated the Muslim armies in their own territory, Ramiro's expeditions turned the Valley of the Douro into a no-man's land that separated the Christian kingdoms of the north from the Muslim territories of Iberia. Ramiro II, nicknamed "The Devil" by the Muslims because of his military skill, led Leonese troops in the conquest of [[Madrid]], and the province of [[Toledo (province)|Toledo]], in the middle of the [[Caliphate of C<U+00F3>rdoba]].

[[File:791px-Hispania4c.jpg|left|thumb|right|170px|Spanish Christian kingdoms ''c.''925 AD <U+2013> 929 AD; Note that Castile at that time was still a Leonese county rather than an independent kingdom, and Galicia and Portugal were dependent kingdoms.]]

Parallel to the advance of the Leonese troops there took place the process called ''[[repoblaci<U+00F3>n]]'', which consisted of repopulating the ''Meseta'', with people coming from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and especially from Asturias and Le<U+00F3>n. This migration of Leonese peoples greatly influenced the [[Leonese language]]. During the ''repoblaci<U+00F3>n'' period, there arose a distinct form of art known as [[Mozarabic]] art. Mozarabic art is a mixing of Visigoth, [[Celtic art|Celtic]], Muslim, and [[Byzantine]] elements. Notable examples of the Mozarabic style are the Leonese churches of [[San Miguel of Escalada]] and [[Santiago de Pe<U+00F1>alba]].

During the early 10th century, Le<U+00F3>n expanded to the south and east, securing territory that would be known as the County of [[Burgos]]. Fortified with numerous [[castle]]s, Burgos remained within Leon until the 930s, at which time Count [[Ferdinand II of Castile]] began a campaign to expand Burgos and make it independent and hereditary. He took for himself the title Earl of Castile, in reference to the many castles of the territory (around Burgos), and continued expanding his area at the expense of Le<U+00F3>n by allying with the [[Caliphate of C<U+00F3>rdoba]], until 966 AD, when he was defeated by [[Sancho I of Le<U+00F3>n]].

=== Peak ===
The Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n continued to be the most important of all those of the Iberian Peninsula. However, [[Sancho III of Navarre]] (1004<U+2013>1035) absorbed Castile in the 1020s, and added Le<U+00F3>n in the last year of his life, leaving [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] to temporary independence. In the division of lands which followed his death, his son Fernando succeeded to the county of Castile. Two years later, in 1037, he conquered Le<U+00F3>n and Galicia. For nearly 30 years, until his death in 1065, he ruled over a combined kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n-Castile as [[Ferdinand I of Le<U+00F3>n]]. In these clashes in an impoverished and isolated culture, where [[edible salt|salt]]-making and a [[blacksmith]]'s forge counted as industries, the armies that decided the fate of the kingdoms numbered in the hundreds of fighting men.

Early in its existence, Le<U+00F3>n lay directly to the north of the wealthy, sophisticated, and powerful Caliphate of C<U+00F3>rdoba. When internal dissensions divided [[Andalusia]]n loyalties in the 11th century, leading to an age of smaller [[Taifa]] successor states of the Caliphate, the impoverished Christian kingdoms who had been sending tribute to the Caliphate found themselves in a position to demand payments (''[[parias]]'') instead, in return for favours to particular factions or as simple [[extortion]].

Thus, though scarcely influenced by the culture of the successor territories of the former Caliphate, Ferdinand I followed the example of the counts of [[Barcelona]] and the kings of [[Aragon]] and he became hugely wealthy from the ''parias'' of the Taifas. When he died in 1065, his territories and the ''parias'' were split among his three sons, of whom Garc<U+00ED>a emerged the victor in the classic fratricidal strife common to feudal successions.

Few in Europe would have known of this immense new wealth in a kingdom so isolated that its bishops had virtually no contact with [[Rome]], except that Ferdinand and his heirs (the kings of Le<U+00F3>n and Castile) became the greatest benefactors of the [[Cluny|Abbey of Cluny]], where Abbot Hugh (died 1109) undertook construction of the huge third abbey church, the [[wiktionary:cynosure|cynosure]] of every eye. The [[Way of Saint James]] called pilgrims from Western Europe to the supposed tomb of [[Saint James the Great]] in [[Santiago de Compostela]], and the large hostels and churches along the route encouraged building in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style.

Alfonso VI was one of the most important kings of Le<U+00F3>n of the [[Middle Ages]]. He assumed control of first Le<U+00F3>n, and later Castile and Galicia, when his brother died attacking the Leonese city of [[Zamora]]. He was crowned Emperor of Spain and received the honoring of all the kings of the Iberian Peninsula.

=== Le<U+00F3>n and Castile ===
The taking of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the old Visigoth capital, in 1085 by [[Alfonso VI of Le<U+00F3>n]] was a turning point in the development of Le<U+00F3>n and Castile and the first major milestone in the ''[[Reconquista]]''. Christian [[Mozarab]]s from [[Al-Andalus]] had come north to populate the deserted [[marches|frontier]] lands, and the traditional view of Spanish history has been that they brought with them the remains of Visigothic and Classical culture, and a new ideology of ''Reconquista'', a [[crusade]] against the Moors. Modern historians see the fall of Toledo as marking a basic change in relations with the Moorish south, turning from the simple extortion of annual tribute to outright territorial expansion. Alfonso VI was drawn into local politics by strife within Toledo and inherited the political alliances of the city-state. He found himself faced with problems unfamiliar to him, such as appointing and dealing with a Catholic [[bishop]] in Toledo and the settling of garrisons in the small Muslim strongholds, the ''[[taifa]]s'', which were dependent on Toledo and which often bought the king's favour with gold from their trade with [[Al-Andalus]] and the [[Maghreb]]. Alfonso VI thus found his role as a Catholic king redefined as he governed large cities with sophisticated urban, Muslim subjects and growing Christian populations.

The two kingdoms of Le<U+00F3>n and Castile were split in 1157, when a major defeat for [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] weakened the authority of Castile.

[[File:Castilla 1210.png|right|thumb|right|170px|A map of the Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n in 1210.]]

The last two kings of an independent Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n (1157&ndash;1230) were [[Ferdinand II of Le<U+00F3>n|Ferdinand II]] and [[Alfonso IX of Le<U+00F3>n|Alfonso VIII]]. Fernando II led Le<U+00F3>n's conquest of  [[M<U+00E9>rida, Spain|M<U+00E9>rida]], a city dating from Roman times. [[Alfonso IX]], besides conquering the whole of [[Extremadura]] (including the cities of [[C<U+00E1>ceres]] and [[Badajoz]]), was the most modern king of his time, founding the [[University of Salamanca]] in 1212 and summoning in 1188 the first [[parliament]] with representation of the citizenry ever seen in Western Europe, the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes of Le<U+00F3>n]].

The last king of an independent Le<U+00F3>n, Alfonso VIII, did not want his kingdom to disappear upon his death and designated his heirs as Sancha and Dulce, the daughters of his first wife. When Alfonso VIII died in 1230, his son by [[Berenguela of Castile]], [[Ferdinand III of Castile]], invaded Le<U+00F3>n and assumed the crown. He thus became the first joint sovereign of both kingdoms since the death of [[Alfonso VII of Le<U+00F3>n|Alfonso VII]] in 1157. The Atlantic coastal province separated as the independent [[History of Portugal (1112<U+2013>1279)|Kingdom of Portugal]].

The union between Le<U+00F3>n and Castile was never accepted by Leonese people. King Ferdinand III needed 2 years to suffocate the independentist revolts in the Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n. So, his son Alfonso X returned the independence of the Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n, but it was not respected by Sancho IV. His brother John waited until 1196, when Sancho was dead, to be crowned as John I, King of Le<U+00F3>n, Galicia and Sevilla. In 1301 he abdicated and the king of Castile assumed the Crown of Le<U+00F3>n, joining both kingdoms.

Though the kings of Castile and Le<U+00F3>n initially continued to take the title King of Le<U+00F3>n as the superior title, and to use a [[lion]] as part of their [[Flag of Spain|standard]], power in fact became centralized in Castile, as exemplified by the [[Leonese language]]'s replacement by Spanish. The Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n and the Kingdom of Castile kept different Parliaments, different flags, different coin and different laws until the Modern Era, when Spain, like other European states, centralized governmental power.

==Modern era==
The Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n coexisted as a [[personal union]] under the [[Crown of Castile]], with Le<U+00F3>n possessing separate institutions, such as its own ''cortes'', the ''[[Adelantado|Real Adelantamiento]]'' of the Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n, the ''Merino mayor'' of Le<U+00F3>n, among others, many of which lasted until the 19th century. The Castilian monarchs, however, soon began a process of unifying the laws of the two kingdoms, as exemplified by the [[Siete Partidas]]. By the 16th century, Le<U+00F3>n became a [[captaincy|captaincy-general]], and all the Kings of Spain were crowned as "King of Le<U+00F3>n" in public ceremonies.

== 19th century ==
In the 19th century, the Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n declared war, together with Galicia and Asturias, against [[France]], and organised the ''Junta General del Reino de Le<U+00F3>n'' as its own government. The modern region of the Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n was established in 1833<ref>Real Decreto de 30 de noviembre de 1833</ref> and was divided into Le<U+00F3>n, Zamora, and Salamanca provinces.

== Present ==
[[File:Cartel festival celta.jpg|thumb|International Celtic Festival "Kngdom of Le<U+00F3>n"]]The present Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n, composed by the provinces of [[Province of Le<U+00F3>n|Le<U+00F3>n]], [[Province of Zamora|Zamora]], and [[Province of Salamanca|Salamanca]] are now part of the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Castile and Le<U+00F3>n]]. 

There have been initiatives, approvated by few Leonese city councils, that claimed for a NUTS-2 (European Statistical Region) for the Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n.
 
There is a modern Leonese regionalist and nationalist movement (''leonesismo'') that supports the creation of an autonomous community separate from Castile. Leonesist parties got the 13.60% of votes in the Le<U+00F3>n province in 2007.
