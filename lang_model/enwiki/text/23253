'''Alma Lucy Reville, Lady Hitchcock''' (14 August 1899 <U+2013> 6 July 1982) was an English [[assistant director]], screenwriter, and [[Film Editor|editor]]. She is best known for her work with [[Alfred Hitchcock]], whom she married in 1926.

==Life and work==
She was born in Nottinghamshire, England, the second daughter of Matthew Edward and Lucy Reville (n<U+00E9>e Owen).

She is best known as the wife and collaborator of Sir [[Alfred Hitchcock]], whom she met while they were working together at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous Players-Lasky studio]] in London, during the early 1920s. A talented editor, Alma worked on British films with directors such as [[Berthold Viertel]] and [[Maurice Elvey]], though her main focus was her husband<U+2019>s work. Cinema was the couple<U+2019>s passion. She converted to Roman Catholicism from Protestantism before their marriage.<ref name="Adair">Adair, Gene. ''Alfred Hitchcock: Filming Our Fears.'' Oxford University Press, 2002. ISBN 0-19-511967-3</ref> Alma was one day younger than her husband. 

They married on 2 December 1926 at [[Brompton Oratory]] in London; their daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] was born on 7 July 1928. Alma became Hitchcock's collaborator and sounding board, with a keen ear for dialogue and an editor's sharp eye for scrutinising a film's final version for continuity flaws so minor they escaped Hitchcock's own notice and that of his crew. It was Reville who noticed [[Janet Leigh]] inadvertently breathing after her character's fatal encounter with Norman Bates' mother in ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), necessitating an alteration to the negative. She was particularly good at revising dialogue and spotting inconsistencies in his plots.

Alma Reville died of natural causes at the age of 82, two years after Hitchcock's death. She had suffered from breast cancer some years before her death, but made a full recovery from the illness. She is buried in Los Angeles, California.

She was played by [[Imelda Staunton]] in ''[[The Girl (2012 HBO film)|The Girl]]'' (2012), the [[BBC]]/ HBO film about the relationship between Sir [[Alfred Hitchcock]] ([[Toby Jones]]) and [[Tippi Hedren]] ([[Sienna Miller]]) and by [[Helen Mirren]] in [[Sacha Gervasi]]'s  ''[[Hitchcock (film) |''Hitchcock'']]'' (2012), about the production of ''Psycho''.
