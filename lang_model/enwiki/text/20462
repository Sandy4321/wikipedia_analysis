'''Lawrence Horne "Larry H." Miller''' (April 26, 1944 <U+2013> February 20, 2009) was a [[Utah]] [[businessman]] and [[philanthropist]] who was well known as the owner of the [[NBA]]'s [[Utah Jazz]] and the of [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] baseball team, the [[Salt Lake Bees]], 41 automotive dealerships throughout the Western United States <ref>[http://www.lhm.com/auto.asp Larry H. Miller Dealerships]</ref>, and a variety of other business ventures including [[Prestige Financial]], Jordan Commons, [[Megaplex Theatres]], [[KJZZ-TV]], [[Miller Motorsports Park]], the [[FANZZ]] chain of sports apparel stores, the advertising agency [[Saxton Horne]] - named after Miller's wife's maiden name and his middle-name, and the [[EnergySolutions Arena]] (formerly the "Delta Center"), all of which are still owned by the family's Larry H. Miller Group of Companies.

==Biography==
Miller was born as Lawrence Horne West to Mary Lorille Horne and Howard Hanley West. His parents divorced in 1946, and in June 1948 his mother married Frank Soren Miller. Larry was legally adopted by his stepfather in September 1949, and his last name was changed to Miller.

Following his graduation from West High School, Miller was employed in [[construction]] by his uncle William Reid Horne until 1964, when he went to work for American Auto Parts. [[Softball]] and [[drag racing]], two of his interests, helped launch his careers in sports and automobiles. From 1963 to 1970, Miller raced cars, and from 1962 to 1985 he was an outstanding fast-pitch softball player, pitching in the Salt Lake City Metro League and the Denver Metro League.

In 1966, he became a parts manager and later manager of the parts and service departments for a Utah auto dealer. In 1970, he moved to [[Denver]] to play softball and work as a parts manager for two Denver [[Toyota]] dealerships. In 1978, he was promoted to operations manager over five Toyota stores.

Larry H. Miller was a life-long member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], whose for-profit arm manages the company's TV station today.

Miller married his high school sweetheart, Karen Gail Saxton, on March 25, 1965. Their [[marriage]] produced five children: Gregory Scott, Roger Lawrence, Karen Rebecca, Stephen Frank and Bryan Joseph.  He was the grandfather of twenty-six grandchildren.

==Business accomplishments==
Miller formed a business partnership with Horne to purchase a Toyota dealership in the [[Salt Lake City]] [[suburb]] of [[Murray, Utah]]. It opened on May 1, 1979 as Larry H. Miller Toyota. In October 1981, Miller bought out his uncle's share in the business. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, he acquired a number of automobile dealerships in [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]], and [[New Mexico]], creating the Larry H. Miller Automotive Group. In 2007, [[Selling Power]] listed him as the tenth largest U.S. automotive dealer, with forty-two dealerships and sales of $2,327,000,000.

After a failed attempt to start a [[television]] outlet on the last remaining [[VHF]] frequency in the Utah market, Miller purchased Salt Lake City independent station KXIV in February 1993. He later changed the call letters to [[KJZZ-TV]] as a reference to the Jazz.

Miller also owned the Larry H. Miller Megaplex, Prestige Financial, Miller Motorsports Park (opened in 2006), Fanzz (a chain of sports clothing & memorabilia outlets), and the successful Jordan Commons cinema/[[restaurant]] complexes along the Wasatch Front. There are five [[Megaplex Theaters]] located in shopping centers along the Wasatch Front; the [[Gateway District|Gateway Mall]] in downtown Salt Lake City, at the aforementioned Jordan Commons in [[Sandy, Utah|Sandy]], at The District in [[South Jordan, Utah|South Jordan]], at The Junction in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], and at [[Thanksgiving Point]] in [[Lehi, Utah|Lehi]]. Together the theaters total 70 screens.  In late 2010 another theatre location in Centerville, Utah was announced.  In 2010 the Megaplex at Thanksgiving Point started showing large format movies on the Mammoth Screen.

==Sports involvement==
Miller became a co-owner of the Utah Jazz when he purchased a 50% interest in the team on April 11, 1985 for $9.5 million. On June 16, 1986, he purchased the remaining 50% from Sam Battistone for $17.3 million.

Miller built the [[EnergySolutions Arena]] (formerly the Delta Center) in downtown [[Salt Lake City]] to house the Jazz NBA team.

Miller was an unpaid consultant in the project to construct [[Spring Mobile Ballpark]], now the home of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]]'s AAA affiliate [[Salt Lake Bees]]. He purchased the team in 2005, changing the name from the [[Salt Lake Stingers]] to the Bees.

He also owned the [[Salt Lake Golden Eagles]] [[ice hockey]] team, which he purchased in September 1989.

Miller was also the owner of the [[Utah Starzz]] WNBA team (Starzz referencing a former successful ABA team, the [[Utah Stars]] and the double-z in Jazz). Miller sold the team in 2002 to [[San Antonio Spurs]] owner [[Peter Holt]] who moved the team to San Antonio and renamed them the [[San Antonio Silver Stars]].

Miller also owned a racetrack in Utah, [[Miller Motorsports Park]] and a [[road racing]] course.

The Larry H. Miller [[Tour of Utah]] presented by Zions Bank is an annual professional [[road bicycle racing]] [[stage race]].

==Declining health and death==
Miller had been in declining health for several years. In June 2008, Miller suffered a severe heart attack, and was hospitalized for 59 days with complications that included kidney failure and gastrointestinal bleeding, which required a blood transfusion. In October, he developed a bone infection and diabetic ulcers on one foot that required outpatient surgery. On January 23, 2009, Miller underwent surgery to amputate both legs six inches below the knee, a result of complications from [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2]] [[diabetes]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Jazz owner has both legs amputated |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/HomeMainStories/2009/01/23/8129701-ap.html |date=16 February 2009|work=Slam! Sports |accessdate=2009-02-16}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On February 20, 2009, surrounded by family at his home, Miller died of complications from type II diabetes.<ref>http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,705286421,00.html deseretnews.com, February 20, 2009</ref>
<ref>http://origin.nba.com/jazz/news/0809_larry_h_miller022009.html  Utah Jazz Statement, February 20, 2009</ref>  On the day of his death, at a news conference attended by his family and physician, it was revealed that his diabetes was compounded by a rare and incurable disease known as [[calciphylaxis]], which he was diagnosed with just one week prior to his death.

Utah Governor Jon Huntsman issued the following statement on February 20, 2009 regarding the passing of Larry H. Miller:

"Every citizen in our state feels a little empty today. Larry was Utah and Utah was Larry. He inspired many and served countless. We all have been made better by his extraordinary life. Mary Kaye and I wish to express our deepest love and sympathies to his wonderful wife, Gail,
and their entire family and wish them a sense of deep condolences at this difficult time."

Governor Huntsman had appointed Miller to chair the Governor's Commission on Strengthening Utah's Democracy in January; a replacement is to be named at a later time.

NBA Commissioner David Stern issued a statement on the passing of Mr. Miller: <U+201C>It is with great sadness that I offer condolences to Gail and the Miller family on behalf of the entire NBA family. Larry's legacy extends beyond the NBA as he touched many lives in the Salt Lake City region through his business ventures and charitable endeavors. The NBA lost a great leader, colleague and friend today. We will miss him.<U+201D>

On February 21, 2009, the Utah Jazz played in Miller's name against the [[New Orleans Hornets]], honoring him with a special ceremony and giving their condolences, and the game ball, to his wife, winning the game 102<U+2013>88. They also wore a pin depicting the Jazz' first Utah logo for the remainder of the season.

==Public service==
Miller contributed to a variety of causes and organizations, including a $21 million dollar training center for law enforcement and corrections officers,<ref>Pat Reavy, [http://www.post.utah.gov/pdf/miller.pdf Miller building police training center.], ''Deseret News'', July 14, 2005.</ref> as well as a significant investment towards a campus for [[Salt Lake Community College]], which are both named in his honor.

In November 1995, he formed Larry H. Miller Charities, whose mission statement is, "We give back to our communities by focusing our united service and corporate giving on youth and children with an emphasis on health and education." Since its inception, the foundation has raised more than $1 million, distributing those funds to charitable organizations in the communities where the Larry H. Miller Group does business.

His public service was recognized by numerous awards, including the Utah [[Minutemen|Minuteman]] Award from the Utah [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] in 1990, an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the [[University of Utah]] in 1991, and the Tourist Achievement Award from the Salt Lake Convention and Visitors Bureau in 1992.

==Controversies==
===Brokeback Mountain===
On January 6, 2006, the film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' was pulled from Miller's Megaplex 17 theater at the last minute after Miller learned from a radio reporter that the film featured a [[homosexual|gay]] romance.  Other [[R-rated]] films, such as the comedy ''[[Grandma's Boy (2006 film)|Grandma's Boy]]'' and the violent horror film ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' were still allowed to be shown. As a result, the businessman was accused of exhibiting [[homophobia|bias]] against homosexuality.

The cancellation brought international attention to the theater.  The [[Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Community Center of Utah]] and other [[gay rights]] groups urged its members to avoid patronizing Miller's various businesses.  [[Jay Leno]] joked about the incident on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.

Miller later explained the cancellation, saying that he was concerned about "getting away from the [[nuclear family|traditional families]]", what he called "a very dangerous thing." Miller noted that several individuals purchased automobiles from his dealerships as a form of support for the decision. He also expressed regret for any feelings that were hurt as a result.<ref>[http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_3673663 Salt Lake Tribune - Miller explains why he chose to pull 'Brokeback']{{Dead link|date=April 2008}}</ref>

[[John Amaechi]], a retired [[center (basketball)|center]] who finished his career with Miller's Utah Jazz in 2003, [[Coming out|publicly announced his homosexuality]] on February 7, 2007. Miller issued a statement the following day, conceding that he had made a bad decision in pulling ''Brokeback Mountain''.  He described it as a "knee-jerk reaction" and said that he would probably allow the film to be shown if faced with the same decision again; however he said he was still unsure how he would react to an openly gay player on his basketball team.<ref>Lya Wodraska, [http://www.sltrib.com/sports/ci_5182227 Miller says he now thinks 'Brokeback' ban was wrong], ''Salt Lake Tribune'', February 8, 2007.</ref>
