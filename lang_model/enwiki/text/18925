Hyslop's interest in psychic investigation increased after sessions with the medium [[Leonora Piper]]. He believed that through her he had received messages from his father, his wife, and other members of his family, about which he reported in the ''Journal of the Society for Psychical Research'' (London, 1901).<ref name="biodict">Helene Pleasants (1964) Biographical Dictionary of Parapsychology with Directory and Glossary 1946-1996 NY: Garrett Publications</ref>
