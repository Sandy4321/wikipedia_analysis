On 12 September 1941, Scherf enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force for service during the Second World War.<ref name="Nom">{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&VeteranID=1062703|title=Scherf, Charles Curnow|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=25 February 2009|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}</ref> Posted for flight training at No. 10 Empire Flight Training School, [[Temora, New South Wales|Temora]] and later No. 6 Service Flying Training School, [[Mallala, South Australia|Mallala]], he graduated as a pilot with an "above average" rating on 2 July 1942.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="ServRec"/> [[Officer (armed forces)|Commissioned]] as a [[pilot officer]] on 17 September, Scherf embarked from [[Sydney]] bound for the [[United Kingdom]] the following month. Following a six-week voyage, he disembarked on 27 November and was attached to [[Royal Air Force]] training units for "advanced flying and operational training". He was promoted to [[flying officer]] during this time.

During August 1943, Scherf commenced flying operational sorties against [[Axis powers|Axis]] airfields in [[France]]. On 15 September, he flew as an escort to a group of eight [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] bombers during a low level attack on the [[Dortmund-Ems Canal]], [[Germany]].<ref name="ADB"/> He was promoted to acting [[flight lieutenant]] on 29 December.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="ServRec"/> During this time, Scherf took part in several night operations and was credited with damaging a variety of targets as well as shooting down four German aircraft at night. Praised for his "exceptional keenness and&nbsp;... courage", Scherf was subsequently awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his night time exploits. The announcement and accompanying citation for the award was published in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 4 April 1944.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=36453|date=4 April 1944|startpage=1552|supp=yes|accessdaymonth=25 February|accessyear=2009}}</ref>

During late February 1944, Scherf took part in a sortie over Axis occupied territory with Squadron Leader Howie Clevelend; Scherf flew the leading aircraft of the two. The pair attacked an Axis airfield at St Yan, France, and successfully destroyed three aircraft on the ground. Soon after, the two pilots spotted a [[Heinkel He 111]]Z twin-fuselage glider tug towing two [[Gotha Go 242]] gliders. Scherf and Clevelend attacked the party, with Clevelend firing first and destroying one of the gliders. Scherf then destroyed the second glider, before the pair assaulted the Heinkel. In the first pass, Scherf set the starboard engine ablaze while Clevelend hit the starboard side. Scherf made a second firing pass, before the Heinkel spiralled to the ground with three of its five engines on fire. This action was Scherf's final sortie of his tour.<ref name="Thomas">{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Andrew|authorlink=|title=Mosquito Aces of World War 2|year=2005|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1841768782|page=64&ndash;65}}</ref> The pair were consequently credited with shooting down three aircraft for their efforts in the operation, with an additional three others damaged or destroyed on the ground.<ref name="Bar">{{LondonGazette|issue=36511|date=12 May 1944|startpage=2185|supp=yes|accessdaymonth=25 February|accessyear=2009}}</ref> 

On 13 March 1944, Scherf was promoted to acting [[squadron leader]] and, with his operation tour at an end, was posted to Headquarters Air Defence Great Britain as a controller of [[Bombing of Peenem<U+00FC>nde in World War II#Operation Whitebait|Intruder operations]].<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="ServRec"/><ref name="Thomas"/> By the time of this posting, Scherf had destroyed seven airborne or grounded German aircraft, with an additional shared victory.

{{quote|''Air Ministry, 12th May, 1944''

The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the following awards in recognition of gallantry displayed in flying operations against the enemy <U+2014>

''Bar to Distinguished Flying Cross''

Acting Flight Lieutenant Charles Curnow SCHERF, DFC (Aus 413671), Royal Australian Air Force, No 418 (RCAF) Squadron.

Since being awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, this officer has taken part in numerous sorties and has continued to display the highest qualities of gallantry and skill. Towards the end of February, 1944, he flew the leading aircraft of two detailed for a sortie far in enemy occupied territory. During the operation three enemy aircraft were shot down, and three others damaged on the ground. During another sortie over Northern France in April, 1944, Flight Lieutenant Scherf destroyed two enemy aircraft in the air and damaged three others on the ground at an airfield. These 2 sorties were a fitting climax to an outstanding tour. This officer has destroyed at least 9 enemy aircraft, successes which pay an excellent tribute to his great fighting qualities and resolution.}}

On 2 and 16 May 1944, Scherf took part in two daylight sorties with No. 418 Squadron into "well-defended areas far into Germany".<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="DSO">{{LondonGazette|issue=36584|date=27 June 1944|startpage=3041|supp=yes|accessdaymonth=25 February|accessyear=2009}}</ref> Leading a section of Mosquito aircraft, Scherf was credited with shooting down six aircraft in aerial combat, and damaging an additional three on the ground over the two operations.

The notification and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in a supplement to the ''London Gazette'' on 27 June 1944.<ref name="DSO"/>

On 10 July 1944, Scherf embarked from the United Kingdom in order to return to Australia. Arriving in [[Brisbane]] two months later, he was briefly posted to [[RAAF Station Sandgate]]. During October, Scherf was posted to [[No. 5 Operational Training Unit RAAF]], [[RAAF Base Williamtown|Williamtown]], as chief flying instructor. He served in this position until late December, when he was posted for duties with [[RAAF Base Richmond]] and later [[RAAF Bradfield Park]]. On 11 April 1945, Scherf transferred to Royal Australian Air Force Reserve and returned to his home in Emmaville; thus ending his wartime service. By this time, Scherf had been officially credited with shooting down 14<U+00BD> Axis aircraft in aerial combat, as well as nine aircraft destroyed on the ground and a further seven damaged from a total of 38 operational sorties.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="ServRec"/>

==Later life==
On 16 February 1946, Scherf attended an investiture ceremony at [[Government House, Sydney]], where he was presented with his Distinguished Service Order, Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar by the [[Governor-General of Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00310/003100005.pdf|title=Recommendation for Charles Curnow Scherf to be awarded a Distinguished Service Order|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=25 February 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00310/003100006.pdf|title=Recommendation for Charles Curnow Scherf to be awarded a Bar to Distinguished Flying Cross|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=25 February 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00310/003100007.pdf|title=Recommendation for Charles Curnow Scherf to be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=25 February 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> Scherf was discharged from the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve on 1 July 1947.<ref name="Nom"/>

Scherf found it difficult to re-adjust to civilian life, and began to have [[nightmare]]s about the Germans he had shot down and killed during the war. This consequently led him to drink heavily. On 13 July 1949, Scherf was driving his car along the Inverell road approximately {{convert|3|km|mi}} from Emmaville when he struck a tree and the vehicle overturned; he died later that day from his injuries sustained during the crash. Survived by his wife, their three daughters and son, Scherf was buried in the local cemetery.<ref name="ADB"/>
