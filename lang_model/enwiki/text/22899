'''Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela''' ({{IPA-xh|xo<U+02C8>li<U+02D0><U+026C>a<U+026C>a man<U+02C8>de<U+02D0>la|[[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] pronunciation:}}; born 18 July 1918) is a South African [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-apartheid revolutionary]] and politician who served as [[President of South Africa]] from 1994 to 1999. He was the first black South African to hold the office, and the first elected in a [[universal suffrage|fully representative]], multiracial election. His [[Presidency of Nelson Mandela|government]] focused on dismantling the legacy of [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] through tackling institutionalised racism, poverty and inequality, and fostering racial reconciliation. Politically a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]], he served as the [[History of the African National Congress|President of the African National Congress]] (ANC) from 1991 to 1997. Internationally, Mandela was the [[Non-Aligned Movement|Secretary General of the Non-Aligned Movement]] from 1998 to 1999.

A [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] born to the [[Thembu]] royal family, Mandela attended [[Fort Hare University]] and the [[University of Witwatersrand]], where he studied law. Living in [[Johannesburg]], he became involved in anti-colonial politics, joining the ANC and becoming a founding member of its [[African National Congress Youth League|Youth League]]. After the [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner nationalists]] of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] came to power in 1948 and began implementing the policy of apartheid, he rose to prominence in the ANC's 1952 [[Defiance Campaign]], was elected President of the Transvaal ANC Branch and oversaw the 1955 [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]]. Working as a lawyer, he was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and, with the ANC leadership, was prosecuted in the [[Treason Trial]] from 1956 to 1961 but was found not guilty. Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the [[South African Communist Party]] he co-founded the militant [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK) in 1961, leading a bombing campaign against government targets. In 1962 he was arrested, convicted of [[sabotage]] and conspiracy to overthrow the government, and sentenced to life imprisonment in the [[Rivonia Trial]]. 

Mandela served 27 years in prison, first on [[Robben Island]], and later in [[Pollsmoor Prison]] and [[Drakenstein Correctional Centre|Victor Verster Prison]]. An international campaign lobbied for his release, which was granted in 1990. Becoming ANC President, Mandela published [[Long Walk to Freedom|his autobiography]] and led negotiations with President [[F.W. de Klerk]] to abolish apartheid and establish [[South African general election, 1994|multi-racial elections in 1994]], in which he led the ANC to victory. He was elected [[President of South Africa|President]] and formed a [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|Government of National Unity]]. As President, he established a [[Constitution of South Africa|new constitution]] and initiated the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to investigate past human rights abuses, while introducing policies to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator between Libya and the United Kingdom in the [[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial]], and oversaw [[Southern African Development Community intervention in Lesotho|military intervention in Lesotho]]. He declined to run for a second term, and was succeeded by his deputy [[Thabo Mbeki]], subsequently becoming an elder statesman, focusing on charitable work in combating poverty and [[HIV/AIDS]] through the Nelson Mandela Foundation.

Controversial for much of his life, right-wing critics denounced Mandela as a terrorist and communist sympathiser. He has nevertheless received international acclaim for his anti-colonial and anti-apartheid stance, having received [[List of Nelson Mandela awards and honours|over 250 awards]], including the 1993 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], the US [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the Soviet [[Order of Lenin]]. He is held in deep respect within South Africa as the "Father of the Nation" and is often known under his [[Xhosa clan name]] of '''''Madiba'''''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22052593 |title=Nelson Mandela discharged from South Africa hospital |date=6 April 2013 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 April 2013 |archivedate=9 April 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Fl4RyNbI |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/31/nelson-mandela-what-follows |title=South Africans pray for Nelson Mandela, but dismiss fears his death will mean chaos |author=David Smith |date=30 March 2013 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=9 April 2013 |archivedate=9 April 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Fl4aC2Gz |deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Early life==

His mother took Mandela to the "Great Place" palace at Mqhekezweni, where he was entrusted under the [[legal guardian|guardianship]] of Thembu [[Regency (government)|regent]], Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo. Raised by Jongintaba and his wife Noengland alongside their son Justice and daughter Nomafu, Mandela felt that they treated him as their son, but would not see his mother for many years.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=22<U+2013>25}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=7<U+2013>9}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|pp=26<U+2013>27}}.</ref> As Mandela attended church services every Sunday with his guardians, Christianity became a significant part of his life.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=27<U+2013>29}}.</ref> He attended a Methodist mission school located next to the palace, studying English, Xhosa, history and geography.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|p=27}}.</ref> He developed a love of African history, listening to the tales told by elderly visitors to the palace, and becoming influenced by the anti-imperialist rhetoric of Chief Joyi;<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=31<U+2013>34}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|p=18}}.</ref> he nevertheless considered the European colonialists as benefactors, not oppressors.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|p=43}}.</ref> Aged 16, he, Justice and several other boys travelled to Tyhalarha to undergo the [[circumcision]] ritual that symbolically marked their transition from boys to men; the rite over, he was given the name "Dalibunga".<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=36<U+2013>42}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|pp=29<U+2013>31}}.</ref>

[[File:Young Mandela.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Mandela, circa 1937]]
Intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, Mandela began his secondary education at Clarkebury Boarding Institute in [[Engcobo]], a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in [[Thembuland]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=45<U+2013>47}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|p=31}}.</ref> Made to socialise with other students on an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his "stuck up" attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=48<U+2013>50}}.</ref> Completing his [[Junior Certificate]] in two years,<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=17}}.</ref> in 1937 he moved to [[Healdtown Comprehensive School|Healdtown]], the Methodist college in [[Fort Beaufort]] attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|p=52}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=17<U+2013>18}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|pp=31<U+2013>32}}.</ref> The headmaster emphasised the superiority of English culture and government, but Mandela became increasingly interested in native African culture, making his first non-Xhosa friend, a [[Sotho language]]-speaker, and coming under the influence of one of his favourite teachers, a Xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a Sotho.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=53<U+2013>54}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=18<U+2013>21}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|p=32}}.</ref> Spending much of his spare time long-distance running and boxing, in his second year Mandela became a [[prefect]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|p=56}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|p=32}}.</ref>

With Jongintaba's backing, Mandela began work on a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree at the [[University of Fort Hare]], an elite black institution in [[Alice, Eastern Cape]] with around 150 students. There he studied English, [[anthropology]], politics, native administration and [[Roman Dutch law]] in his first year, desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=62<U+2013>65}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=21, 25}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|pp=33<U+2013>34}}.</ref> Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory, befriending [[Oliver Tambo]] and his own kinsman, [[Kaiser Matanzima|K.D.

===Arriving in Johannesburg: 1941<U+2013>1943===
Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that Jongintaba had [[arranged marriage]]s for him and Justice; dismayed, they fled to [[Johannesburg]] via [[Queenstown, Eastern Cape|Queenstown]], arriving in April 1941.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=73<U+2013>76}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=27<U+2013>28}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|pp=36<U+2013>39}}.</ref> Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his "first sight of South African capitalism in action", but was fired when the ''induna'' (headman) discovered he was a runaway.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=89<U+2013>94}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=29<U+2013>30}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|p=40}}.</ref> Staying with a cousin in [[George Goch Township]], Mandela was introduced to the realtor and ANC activist [[Walter Sisulu]], who secured him a job as an [[articled clerk]] at law firm Witkin, Sidelsky and Edelman, run by a liberal Jew, Lazar Sidelsky, who took a keen interest in the education of indigenous Africans.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=96<U+2013>101}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=30<U+2013>31}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|p=41}}.</ref> At night Mandela worked on his BA through a [[University of South Africa]] correspondence course.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|p=100}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=34}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|p=44}}.</ref> Living off a small wage, he rented a room in the house of the Xhoma family in the [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra]] township; rife with poverty, crime and pollution, Alexandra "occupie[d] a treasured place in [his] heart".<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=99, 108<U+2013>110}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|pp=44<U+2013>45}}.</ref> Although embarrassed by his poverty, he briefly courted a [[Swazi people|Swazi]] woman, Ellen Nkabinde, before unsuccessfully pursuing Didi Xhoma, his landlord's daughter.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=113<U+2013>116}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|pp=45<U+2013>46}}.</ref>

However, he stated later that he did not join the Party because its atheism conflicted with his Christian faith, and because he saw the South African struggle as being racially based rather than [[class conflict|class warfare]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|p=106}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|pp=48<U+2013>49}}.</ref> Redebe encouraged Mandela to join the ANC, and in August 1943 Mandela marched in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=122<U+2013>123}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=37}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|p=48}}.</ref> Finding the rent cheaper, Mandela moved into the compound of the [[Witwatersrand Native Labour Association]]; living among miners of various tribes, he met the Queen Regent of [[Basutoland]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|pp=118<U+2013>119}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=34}}.</ref> In late 1941, Jongintaba visited, forgiving Mandela for running away.

At Sisulu's house, Mandela met [[Evelyn Mase]], an ANC activist and nurse from [[Engcobo]], [[Transkei]].

In the [[South African general election, 1948]], in which only whites were permitted to vote, the Afrikaner-dominated [[Herenigde Nasionale Party]] under [[Daniel Fran<U+00E7>ois Malan]] took power, soon uniting with the [[Afrikaner Party]] to form the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]].

In 1952, the ANC began preparation for a joint [[Defiance Campaign]] against apartheid with Indian and communist groups, founding a National Voluntary Board to recruit volunteers.

Based on the responses, a Freedom Charter was drafted by [[Rusty Bernstein]], calling for the creation of a democratic, non-racialist state with the [[nationalisation]] of major industry.

On 5 December 1956, Mandela was arrested alongside most of the ANC Executive for "high treason" against the state.

On 11 July 1963, police raided Liliesleaf Farm, arresting those they found there and uncovering paperwork documenting MK's activities, some of which mentioned Mandela. The subsequent [[Rivonia Trial]] began at [[Supreme Court of South Africa|Pretoria Supreme Court]] on 9 October, with Mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government. Their chief prosecutor was [[Percy Yutar]], who called for them to receive the death penalty.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|2004|pp=27<U+2013>32}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=183<U+2013>186}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|pp=292<U+2013>295}}.</ref> Judge [[Quartus de Wet]] soon threw out the prosecution's case for insufficient evidence, but Yutar reformulated the charges, presenting his new case from December until February 1964, calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs to the trial.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|2004|pp=33<U+2013>42}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=186<U+2013>190}}.</ref> 

With the exception of [[James Kantor]], who was innocent of all charges, Mandela and the accused admitted sabotage but denied that they had ever agreed to initiate guerilla war against the government. They used the trial to highlight their political cause; one of Mandela's speeches <U+2013> inspired by Castro's "[[History Will Absolve Me]]" speech <U+2013> was widely reported in the press despite official censorship.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|2004|pp=42<U+2013>57}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=190<U+2013>194}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|pp=300<U+2013>302}}.</ref> The trial gained international attention, with global calls for the release of the accused from such institutions as the United Nations and [[World Peace Council]].

By the late 1960s, Mandela's fame had been eclipsed by [[Steve Biko]] and the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] (BCM).

===Pollsmoor Prison: 1982<U+2013>1988===

In April 1982 Mandela was transferred to [[Pollsmoor Prison]] in [[Tokai, Cape Town]] along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, [[Ahmed Kathrada]] and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=324<U+2013>325}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=340}}.</ref> Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=324<U+2013>325}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=346<U+2013>347}}.</ref> Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a [[roof garden]],<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=326}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=347}}.</ref> also reading voraciously and corresponding widely, now permitted 52 letters a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=329}}.</ref> He was appointed patron of the multi-racial [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African President [[P.W.

Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments which would have control over education, health, and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system; like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=335<U+2013>336}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=341<U+2013>346}}.</ref>

Violence across the country escalated, with many fearing civil war.

Mandela proceeded on an African tour, meeting supporters and politicians in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Libya and Algeria, continuing to Sweden where he was reunited with Tambo, and then London, where he appeared at the [[Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa]] concert in Wembley Stadium.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=412<U+2013>414}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=409<U+2013>410}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//ITN/1990/04/16/CR2216/?s |title=ITN Source website: "...Mandela onto stage..." |publisher=Itnsource.com |date=16 April 1990 |accessdate=2012-12-27 |archivedate=14 February 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EQZu7LIZ |deadurl=no}}</ref> Encouraging foreign countries to support sanctions against the apartheid government, in France he was welcomed by President [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Mitterrand]], in the Vatican City by [[Pope John Paul II]], and in England he met Thatcher.

In May 1990, Mandela led a multiracial ANC delegation into preliminary negotiations with a government delegation of 11 Afrikaner males. Mandela impressed them with his discussions of Afrikaner history, and the negotiations led to the Groot Schuur Minute, in which the government lifted the state of emergency. In August Mandela <U+2013> recognising the ANC's severe military disadvantage <U+2013> offered a ceasefire, the Pretoria Minute, for which he was widely criticised by MK activists.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=424<U+2013>427}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=412<U+2013>413}}.</ref> He spent much time trying to unify and build the ANC, appearing at a Johannesburg conference in December attended by 1600 delegates, many of whom found him more moderate than expected.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=428<U+2013>429}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=439}}.</ref> At the ANC's July 1991 national conference in Durban, Mandela admitted the party's faults and announced his aim in building a "strong and well-oiled task force" for securing majority rule. At the conference, he was elected ANC President, replacing the ailing Tambo, while a 50-strong multiracial, multi-gendered national executive was elected.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=429<U+2013>430}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=439<U+2013>440}}.</ref>

Mandela was given an office in the newly purchased ANC headquarters at [[Luthuli House|Shell House]], central Johannesburg, while moving with Winnie to her large Soweto home.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=431, 448}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=409}}.</ref> Their marriage was increasingly strained as he learned of her [[adultery|affair]] with [[Dali Mpofu]], but he supported her during her trial for kidnap and assault. He gained funding for her defence from [[International Defence and Aid]] and from Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]], but in June 1991 she was found guilty and sentenced to six years, reduced to two on appeal. On 13 April 1992, Mandela publicly announced his separation from Winnie, while the ANC forced her to step down from the national executive for misappropriating ANC funds; Mandela moved into the white-dominated Johannesburg suburb [[Houghton Estate|Houghton]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=431, 448}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=429<U+2013>436, 435<U+2013>460}}.</ref> Mandela's reputation was further damaged by the increase in "black-on-black" violence, particularly between ANC and Inkatha supporters in [[KwaZulu-Natal]], in which thousands died. Mandela met with Inkatha leader Buthelezi, but the ANC prevented further negotiations on the issue. Mandela recognised that there was a "[[Third Force (South Africa)|third force]]" within the state intelligence services fuelling the "slaughter of the people" and openly blamed de Klerk <U+2013> whom he increasingly distrusted <U+2013> for the [[Sebokeng|Sebokeng massacre]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=436<U+2013>442}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=418<U+2013>424}}.</ref> In September 1991 a national peace conference was held in Johannesburg in which Mandela, Buthelezi and de Klerk signed a peace accord, though the violence continued.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=444}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=425<U+2013>426}}.</ref>

===The CODESA talks: 1991<U+2013>1992===
The [[Convention for a Democratic South Africa]] (CODESA) began in December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade Center, attended by 228 delegates from 19 political parties. Although [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] led the ANC's delegation, Mandela remained a key figure, and after de Klerk used the closing speech to condemn the ANC's violence, he took to the stage to denounce him as "head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime". Dominated by the National Party and ANC, little negotiation was achieved.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=456<U+2013>459}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=443<U+2013>446}}.</ref> CODESA 2 was held in May 1992, in which de Klerk insisted that post-apartheid South Africa must use a [[federalism|federal system]] with a rotating presidency to ensure the protection of ethnic minorities; Mandela opposed this, demanding a [[unitary state|unitary system]] governed by majority rule.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=460}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=448, 452}}.</ref> Following the [[Boipatong massacre]] of ANC activists by government-aided Inkatha militants, Mandela called off the negotiations, before attending a meeting of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] in Senegal, at which he called for a special session of the UN Security Council and proposed that a [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN peacekeeping force]] be stationed in South Africa to prevent "[[state terrorism]]". The UN subsequently sent special envoy [[Cyrus Vance]] to the country to aid negotiations.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=461<U+2013>462}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=462<U+2013>463}}.</ref> Calling for domestic mass action, in August the ANC organised the largest-ever strike in South African history, while supporters marched on Pretoria.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=462<U+2013>463}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=466<U+2013>467}}.</ref>

Following the [[Bisho massacre]], in which 28 ANC supporters and one soldier were shot dead by the [[Ciskei Defence Force]] during a protest march, Mandela realised that mass action was leading to further violence and resumed negotiations in September. He agreed to do so on the conditions that all political prisoners be released, that Zulu traditional weapons be banned, and that Zulu hostels would be fenced off, the latter two measures to prevent further Inkatha attacks; under increasing pressure, de Klerk reluctantly agreed. The negotiations agreed that a multiracial general election would be held, resulting in a five-year [[National unity government|coalition government of national unity]] and a constitutional assembly that gave the National Party continuing influence. The ANC also conceded to safeguarding the jobs of white civil servants; such concessions brought fierce internal criticism.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=463<U+2013>467}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=467<U+2013>471}}.</ref> The duo agreed on [[South African Constitution of 1993|an interim constitution]], guaranteeing separation of powers, creating a constitutional court, and including a US-style [[bill of rights]]; it also divided the country into nine provinces, each with its own premier and civil service, a concession between de Klerk's desire for [[federalism]] and Mandela's for unitary government.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=472}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=489<U+2013>491}}.</ref>

The democratic process was threatened by the Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG), an alliance of far-right Afrikaner parties and black ethnic-secessionist groups like Inkatha; in June 1993 the white supremacist [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] (AWB) [[Storming of Kempton Park World Trade Centre|attacked the Kempton Park World Trade Centre]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=466, 470<U+2013>471}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=449<U+2013>450, 488}}.</ref> Following the murder of ANC leader [[Chris Hani]], Mandela made a publicised speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral in Soweto for Tambo, who had died from a stroke.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=468<U+2013>469}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=476<U+2013>480}}.</ref> In July 1993, both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US, independently meeting President [[Bill Clinton]] and each receiving the [[Liberty Medal]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=471}}.</ref> Soon after, they were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=474}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=494}}.</ref> Influenced by young ANC leader [[Thabo Mbeki]], Mandela began meeting with big business figures, and played down his support for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away much-needed foreign investment. Although criticised by socialist ANC members, he was encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 [[World Economic Forum]] in Switzerland.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=434<U+2013>445, 473}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=497}}.</ref> Mandela also made a cameo appearance as a schoolteacher reciting one of [[Malcom X]]'s speeches in the final scene of the 1992 film ''[[Malcolm X (film)|Malcolm X]]''.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/jun/03/features.matthewcunningham |title=Creme cameos |last=Cunningham |first=Matthew |date=3 June 2004 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=26 October 2008 | location=London |archivedate=14 February 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EQYHaQvk |deadurl=no}}</ref>

===General election: 1994===

[[File:VoteMural-enh.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Cape Town mural of the 1994 election]]
With the election set for 27 April 1994, the ANC began campaigning, opening 100 election offices and hiring advisor [[Stanley Greenberg]]. Greenberg orchestrated the foundation of People's Forums across the country, at which Mandela could appear; though a poor public speaker, he was a popular figure with great status among black South Africans.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=467<U+2013>477}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=495}}.</ref> The ANC campaigned on a [[Reconstruction and Development Programme]] (RDP) to build a million houses in five years, introduce universal free education and extend access to water and electricity.

Concerned that COSAG would undermine the election, particularly in the wake of the [[Battle of Bop]] and [[Shell House Massacre]] <U+2013> incidents of violence involving the AWB and Inkatha, respectively <U+2013> Mandela met with Afrikaner politicians and generals, including P.W. Botha, [[Pik Botha]] and [[Constand Viljoen]], persuading many to work within the democratic system, and with de Klerk convinced Inkatha's Buthelezi to enter the elections rather than launch a war of secession.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=480<U+2013>489}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=488<U+2013>489; 504<U+2013>510}}.</ref> As leaders of the two major parties, de Klerk and Mandela appeared on a televised debate; although de Klerk was widely considered the better speaker at the event, Mandela's offer to shake his hand surprised him, leading some commentators to consider it a victory for Mandela.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=488}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=500<U+2013>501}}.</ref> The election went ahead with little violence, although an AWB cell killed 20 with car bombs.

==Presidency of South Africa: 1994<U+2013>1999==
{{main|Presidency of Nelson Mandela}}
Mandela's inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994, televised to a billion viewers globally. The event was attended by 4000 guests, including world leaders from disparate backgrounds.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=492<U+2013>493}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=514}}.</ref> South Africa's first black [[President of South Africa|President]], Mandela became head of a [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|Government of National Unity]] dominated by the ANC <U+2013> which alone had no experience of governance <U+2013> but containing representatives from the National Party and Inkatha.

[[File:Detuynhuys.jpg|thumb|left|Mandela moved into the Presidential Office of Tuynhuys, Cape Town.]]
Aged 76, he faced various ailments, and although exhibiting continued energy, he felt isolated and lonely.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=497<U+2013>499, 510}}.</ref> He often entertained celebrities, such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], and the [[Spice Girls]], and befriended a number of ultra-rich businessman, like [[Harry Oppenheimer]] of [[Anglo American plc|Anglo-American]], as well as British monarch [[Elizabeth II]] on her March 1995 [[state visit]] to South Africa, resulting in strong criticism from ANC anti-capitalists.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=501, 504}}.</ref> Despite his opulent surroundings, Mandela lived simply, donating a third of his 552,000 rand annual income to the [[Nelson Mandela Children's Fund]], which he had founded in 1995.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=517}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=543}}.</ref> Although speaking out in favour of [[freedom of the press]] and befriending many journalists, Mandela was critical of much of the country's media, noting that it was overwhelmingly owned and run by middle-class whites and believing that it focused too much on scaremongering around crime.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=525<U+2013>527}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=547<U+2013>548}}.</ref> Changing clothes several times a day, after assuming the presidency, one of Mandela's trademarks was his use of [[Batik]] shirts, known as "[[Madiba shirt]]s", even on formal occasions.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=503}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=495}}; {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3532916.stm|title=How Mandela changed SA fashion|last=Khumalo |first=Fred|date=5 August 2004|publisher=BBC  |accessdate=28 October 2008|archivedate=25 February 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EhlMxe4g |deadurl=no}}</ref>

In December 1994, Mandela's autobiography, ''[[Long Walk to Freedom]]'', was finally published.<ref>{{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=517}}</ref> In late 1994 he attended the 49th conference of the ANC in [[Bloemfontein]], at which a more militant National Executive was elected, among them Winnie Mandela; although she expressed an interest in reconciling, Nelson initiated divorce proceedings in August 1995.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=500, 507}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=539<U+2013>542}}.</ref> By 1995 he had entered into a relationship with [[Gra<U+00E7>a Machel]], a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president [[Samora Machel]].

=== National reconciliation ===
Presiding over the transition from apartheid minority rule to a multicultural democracy, Mandela saw national reconciliation as the primary task of his presidency.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=524}}.</ref> Having seen other post-colonial African economies damaged by the departure of white elites, Mandela worked to reassure South Africa's white population that they were protected and represented in "[[Rainbow Nation|the Rainbow Nation]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=495<U+2013>496}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=517}}.</ref> Mandela attempted to create the broadest possible coalition in his cabinet, with de Klerk as first Deputy President while other National Party officials became ministers for Agriculture, Energy, Environment, and Minerals and Energy, and Buthelezi was named Minister for Home Affairs.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=507<U+2013>511}}.</ref> The other cabinet positions were taken by ANC members, many of whom <U+2013> like [[Joe Modise]], [[Alfred Nzo]], Joe Slovo, [[Mac Maharaj]] and [[Dullah Omar]] <U+2013> had long been comrades, although others, such as [[Tito Mboweni]] and [[Jeff Radebe]], were much younger.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=508}}</ref> Mandela's relationship with de Klerk was strained; Mandela thought that de Klerk was intentionally provocative, while de Klerk felt that he was being intentionally humiliated by the president. In January 1995, Mandela heavily chastised him for awarding amnesty to 3,500 police just before the election, and later criticised him for defending former Minister of Defence [[Magnus Malan]] when the latter was charged with murder.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=511, 534}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=528}}.</ref> 

[[Image:Flag of South Africa.svg|thumb|140px|right|Flag of South Africa, adopted April 1994]]

Mandela personally met with senior figures of the apartheid regime, including [[Hendrik Verwoerd]]'s widow Betsie Schoombie and the lawyer Percy Yutar; emphasising personal forgiveness and reconciliation, he announced that "courageous people do not fear forgiving, for the sake of peace."<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=520, 522<U+2013>523}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=523<U+2013>524}}.</ref> He encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the [[South African national rugby union team|Springboks]], as South Africa hosted the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]]. After the Springboks won an epic final over New Zealand, Mandela presented the trophy to captain [[Francois Pienaar]], an Afrikaner, wearing a Springbok shirt with Pienaar's own number 6 on the back. This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as de Klerk later put it, "Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans."<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=524}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=525<U+2013>527}}; {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/team_pages/south_africa/3167692.stm|title=Mandela rallies Springboks|date=6 October 2003|publisher=BBC Sport  |accessdate=28 October 2008|archivedate=25 February 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EhlM6rLh |deadurl=no}}; {{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/portal/2007/10/19/ftmandela119.xml|title=How Nelson Mandela won the rugby World Cup |date=19 October 2007|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=28 October 2008  | first=John | last=Carlin|archivedate=25 February 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EhlMWoPg |deadurl=no}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=516}}</ref> Mandela's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites, but also drew criticism from more militant blacks.

More controversially, Mandela oversaw the formation of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the ANC, appointing Desmond Tutu as its chair. To prevent the creation of martyrs, the Commission granted individual amnesties in exchange for testimony of crimes committed during the apartheid era. Dedicated in February 1996, it held two years of hearings detailing rapes, torture, bombings, and assassinations, before issuing its final report in October 1998. Both de Klerk and Mbeki appealed to have parts of the report suppressed, though only de Klerk's appeal was successful.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=528<U+2013>532}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=527, 551<U+2013>564}}.</ref> Mandela praised the Commission's work, stating that it "had helped us move away from the past to concentrate on the present and the future".<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=532}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=563}}.</ref>

=== Domestic programs ===
Mandela's administration inherited a country with a huge disparity in wealth and services between white and black communities.

Many domestic problems however remained.

=== Foreign affairs ===
[[File:Bill-Clinton-with-Nelson-Mandela.jpg|thumb|right|Mandela with US President [[Bill Clinton]].

Following the South African example, Mandela encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=555}}.</ref> He echoed Mbeki's calls for an "[[African Renaissance]]", and was greatly concerned with issues on the continent; he took a [[soft power|soft diplomatic]] approach to removing [[Sani Abacha]]'s military junta in Nigeria but later became a leading figure in calling for sanctions when Abacha's regime increased human rights violations.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=556<U+2013>557}}.</ref> In 1996 he was appointed Chairman of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) and initiated unsuccessful negotiations to end the [[First Congo War]] in [[Zaire]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=558}}.</ref> In [[South African intervention in Lesotho|South Africa's first post-apartheid military operation]], Mandela ordered troops into Lesotho in September 1998 to protect the government of Prime Minister [[Pakalitha Mosisili]] after a disputed election prompted opposition uprisings.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=558<U+2013>559}};{{cite web | url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Newsletters/lsno8.html | title=Lesotho to hold re-elections within 15 to 18 months | publisher=Lesotho News Online | author=Thai, Bethuel | date=4 October 1998 | accessdate=26 May 2008 |archivedate=26 February 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EiCUruGw |deadurl=no}}</ref>

In September 1998, Mandela was appointed Secretary-General of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], who held their annual conference in Durban. He used the event to criticise the "narrow, chauvinistic interests" of the Israeli government in stalling negotiations to end the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] and urged India and Pakistan to negotiate to end the [[Kashmir conflict]], for which he was criticised by both Israel and India.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=559}}.</ref> Inspired by the region's economic boom, Mandela sought greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia, although this was scuppered by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=560<U+2013>561}}.</ref> He attracted controversy for his close relationship with Indonesian President Suharto, whose regime was responsible for mass human rights abuses, although privately urged him to withdraw from the occupation of East Timor.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=560}}.</ref>

Mandela faced similar criticism from the west for his personal friendships with Fidel Castro and Muammar Gaddafi. Castro visited in 1998, to widespread popular acclaim, while Mandela met Gaddafi in Libya to award him the [[Order of Good Hope]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=562<U+2013>563}}.</ref> When western governments and media criticised these visits, Mandela lambasted the criticisms as having racist undertones.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=564}}.</ref> Mandela hoped to resolve the long-running dispute between Libya and the US and Britain over bringing to trial the two Libyans, [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]] and [[Lamin Khalifah Fhimah]], who were indicted in November 1991 and accused of sabotaging [[Pan Am Flight 103]]. Mandela proposed that they be tried in a third country, which was agreed to by all parties; governed by [[Scots law]], the trial was held at [[Camp Zeist, Netherlands|Camp Zeist]] in the Netherlands in April 1999, and found one of the two men guilty.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=563<U+2013>564}}; {{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/1144147.stm | title=Analysis: Lockerbie's long road |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=26 May 2008 | date=31 January 2001 |archivedate=25 February 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ehl149mt |deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Withdrawing from politics===
The new [[Constitution of South Africa]] was agreed upon by parliament in May 1996, enshrining a series of institutions to check political and administrative authority within a constitutional democracy.<ref>{{harvnb|Muthien|Khose|Magubane|2000|p=366}}.</ref> De Klerk however opposed the implementation of this constitution, withdrawing from the coalition government in protest.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=534}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=529<U+2013>530}}.</ref> The ANC took over the cabinet positions formerly held by the National Party, with Mbeki becoming sole Deputy President.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=535}}.</ref> When both Mandela and Mbkei were out of the country in one occasion, Buthelezi was appointed "Acting President", marking an improvement in his relationship with Mandela.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=536}}.</ref> 

Mandela stepped down as ANC President at the December 1997 conference, and although hoping that Ramaphosa would replace him, the ANC elected Mbeki to the position; Mandela admitted that by then, Mbeki had become "''de facto'' President of the country". Replacing Mbeki as Deputy President, Mandela and the Executive supported the candidacy of [[Jacob Zuma]], a Zulu who had been imprisoned on Robben Island, but he was challenged by Winnie, whose populist rhetoric had gained her a strong following within the party; Zuma defeated her in a landslide victory vote at the election.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=537<U+2013>543}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=568}}.</ref>

Mandela's relationship with Machel had intensified; in February 1998 he publicly stated that "I'm in love with a remarkable lady", and under pressure from his friend Desmond Tutu, who urged him to set an example for young people, he set a wedding for his 80th birthday, in July.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=549<U+2013>551}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=576}}.</ref> The following day he held a grand party with many foreign dignitaries.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=551<U+2013>552}}.</ref> Mandela had never planned on standing for a second term in office, and gave his farewell speech on 29 March 1999, after which he retired.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=578}}.</ref>

Across the world, Mandela came to be seen as "a moral authority" with a great "concern for truth".<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=582}}.</ref> Considered friendly and welcoming, Mandela exhibited a "relaxed charm" when talking to others, including his opponents.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=411, 498}}.</ref> Although often befriending millionaires and dignitaries, he enjoyed talking with their staff when at official functions.<ref>{{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=482<U+2013>483}}.</ref> In later life, he was known for looking for the best in everyone, even defending political opponents to his allies, though some thought him too trusting of others.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=431, 582}}.</ref> He was renowned for his stubbornness and loyalty,<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=583}}.</ref> and exhibited a "hot temper" which could flare up in anger in certain situations, also being "moody and dejected" away from the public eye.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=431, 498}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2010|p=80}}</ref> He also had a mischievous sense of humour.<ref>{{harvnb|Battersby|2011|p=599}}</ref>

Very conscious of his image, throughout his life he sought fine quality clothes, carrying himself in a "regal style" stemming from his childhood in the Thembu royal house, and during his presidency was often compared to a [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=432, 554}}.</ref> Considered a "master of imagery and performance", he excelled at presenting himself well in press photographs and producing soundbites.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=582<U+2013>583}}.</ref>

===Political ideology===
Mandela was an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]], an ideological position he held since joining the ANC,<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=37, 584}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|p=541}}.</ref> also being "a democrat, and a socialist".<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2010|p=231}}.</ref> Although he presented himself in an autocratic manner in several speeches, Mandela was a devout believer in democracy and would abide by majority decisions even when deeply disagreeing with them.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=433}}.</ref> He held a conviction that "inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech" were the fundamentals of democracy,<ref>{{harvnb|Battersby|2011|p=605}}</ref> and was driven by a belief in [[natural and legal rights|natural]] and human rights.<ref>{{harvnb|Kalumba|1995|p=162}}</ref>

A [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]], Mandela was "openly opposed to capitalism, private land-ownership and the power of big money."<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=298}}.</ref> Influenced by [[Marxism]], during the revolution Mandela advocated [[scientific socialism]],<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=282}}.</ref> although he denied being a communist during the Treason Trial.<ref>{{harvnb|Mandela|1994|p=365}}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=135<U+2013>138}}.</ref> Biographer David James Smith thought this untrue, stating that Mandela "embraced communism and communists" in the late 1950s and early 1960s, though was a "[[Fellow traveler|fellow traveller]]" rather than a party member.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2010|pp=217<U+2013>218}}.</ref> In the 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela had helped create, it called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines, and land, believing it necessary to ensure equal distribution of wealth.<ref>{{harvnb|Kalumba|1995|pp=164<U+2013>165}}</ref> Despite these beliefs, Mandela nationalised nothing during his presidency, fearing that this would scare away foreign investors. This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the [[socialist states]] in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the early 1990s.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=433<U+2013>435}}.</ref>
