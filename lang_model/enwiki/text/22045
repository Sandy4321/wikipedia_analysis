'''Hurricane Eloise''' was the most destructive [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[1975 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The fifth tropical storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, Eloise formed as a tropical depression on September 13 to the east of the [[Virgin Islands]]. The depression tracked westward as it intensified into a tropical storm and after passing to the north of [[Puerto Rico]], Eloise briefly attained hurricane intensity. However, the storm made landfall on [[Hispaniola]], causing it to weaken back into a tropical storm. A weak and disorganized cyclone, Eloise emerged into open waters of the northern Caribbean Sea, and upon striking the northern [[Yucatan Peninsula]], it turned north and began to re-intensify. In the Gulf of Mexico, the system quickly developed and became a Category 3 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] on September 23. Eloise made landfall along the [[Florida Panhandle]] west of [[Panama City, Florida|Panama City]] before moving inland across [[Alabama]] and eventually dissipating on September 24.

The storm produced torrential rainfall throughout Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, causing extensive flooding, over 40 deaths, and severe damage. Thousands in these areas were left homeless. As Eloise progressed westward, it affected Cuba to a lesser extent. In advance of the storm, about 100,000 residents evacuated from the Gulf Coast region. Upon making landfall in Florida, Eloise generated winds reportedly gusting to {{convert|155|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, which caused extreme damage throughout the area. Hundreds of buildings were demolished by the powerful winds and strong storm surge. Across the United States, damage amounted to approximately $560 million. The storm killed 80 people along its track, and due to the severe damage, the name "Eloise" was [[Tropical cyclone naming#Retirement|retired]] from the list of Atlantic tropical cyclone names.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Eloise 1975 track.png}}
The origins of Hurricane Eloise trace back to a [[tropical wave]] that emerged from the western coast of Africa on September 6, 1975. Satellite imagery indicated that the system was initially disjointed and poorly developed, although there was evidence of a low-level circulation. The disturbance tracked westward for several days as it slowly matured. On September 13, a ship called the ''Gulf Hansa'' recorded winds of around {{convert|25|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} seas in association with the system. Shortly thereafter, a [[reconnaissance aircraft]] found a center of circulation {{convert|575|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the [[Virgin Islands]], and it is estimated that the storm became a tropical depression at 0600 UTC.<ref name="PRELIM">{{cite journal|author=Herbert, Paul|title=Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1975|date=April 1976|pages=458<U+2013>462|volume=104|journal=Monthly Weather Review|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=November 10, 2009|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1975.pdf}}</ref><ref name="HURDAT">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Specialists Unit|publisher=National Hurricane Center|year=2009|accessdate=November 8, 2009|title=Atlantic Best Tracks, 1851 to 2008|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/tracks1851to2008_atl_reanal.html}}</ref>

The depression continued moving towards the west as it gradually strengthened. On September 16, the system attained tropical storm status and was designated Eloise;<ref name="HURDAT"/> accordingly, the first advisory on the system was issued by the San Juan Weather Bureau office. While in the vicinity of a strengthening [[anticyclone]] aloft, Eloise became better organized, and the storm rapidly intensified and reached Category 1 hurricane status 18 hours after being named.  The cyclone soon made landfall on the [[Dominican Republic]], inhibiting further development.<ref name="PRELIM"/> Although initially predicted to remain north of land, the storm moved across northern Hispaniola and then tracked across southeastern [[Cuba]]. After 36 hours with much of its circulation over mountainous terrain, Eloise deteriorated to a tropical storm on September 17.<ref name="PRELIM"/> 

The cyclone emerged over the open waters of the northern Caribbean on September 19, passing [[Jamaica]] to the north as it moved away from Cuba. Despite favorable upper-level conditions, its interaction with land<U+2014>combined with the weakening of a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to the north<U+2014>left the storm's center distorted. Eloise remained a fairly disorganized tropical storm until September 20, when it approached the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] and began to re-intensify. The storm crossed over the northern tip of the peninsula as it began to turn northward in response to an approaching [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. Between September 17 and September 21, however, reports on the storm were scarce, leading to uncertainty in its exact location and strength. Upon entering the [[Gulf of Mexico]], Eloise quickly organized. The trough enhanced the wind divergence over the storm's center,<ref name="PRELIM"/> allowing it to strengthen once again to reach hurricane force about {{convert|345|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].<ref name="HURDAT"/>
[[Image:Eloise1975filledrainprblk.gif|right|250px|thumb|Rainfall totals in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands]]

On September 22, the cyclone intensified to attain Category 2 strength, and became a major hurricane of Category 3 status shortly thereafter as it turned towards the northeast.<ref name="HURDAT"/> Several ships penetrated the storm's center during its passage through the gulf. The hurricane also moved over two experimental buoys which recorded data on the storm, aiding meteorologists in their forecasts.<ref name="PRELIM"/> Hurricane Eloise continued to strengthen until it reached its peak winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum [[barometric pressure]] of about 955 mbar (hPa; 28.2 inHg).<ref name="HURDAT"/> It moved ashore along the [[Florida Panhandle]] near [[Panama City, Florida|Panama City]] on September 23. Shortly after making landfall, the hurricane rapidly degenerated. Just six hours later, it had weakened into a tropical storm, while situated over eastern [[Alabama]].<ref name="PRELIM"/> It further weakened into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 24. The depression transitioned into an [[extratropical storm]] over [[Virginia]], and became indistinguishable by later that same day. The remnant moisture, however, merged with a [[weather front]] to produce widespread and heavy precipitation.<ref name="PRELIM"/><ref name="HURDAT"/>

==Preparations==
In advance of Hurricane Eloise, warnings for heavy rainfall and potential flooding were issued for [[Puerto Rico]] and the Virgin Islands. A [[hurricane warning]] was declared for parts of the Dominican Republic about 12 hours before landfall.<ref name="PRELIM"/> A "hurricane emergency" was put into effect for the [[Oriente (province)|Oriente Province]] of Cuba, while a "state of alert" was issued for the [[Camag<U+00FC>ey Province]]. [[Cubana de Aviaci<U+00F3>n]] suspended all flights to Oriente.<ref>{{cite news|author=Associated Press|title=Hurricane Eloise Heading For Cuba|date=September 18, 1975|publisher=''Ocala Star-Banner''|accessdate=November 10, 2009|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=33hPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lAUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4598,3293080}}</ref>

On and before September 15, there was still uncertainty as to whether Eloise would impact the United States. However, officials in Florida began taking precautionary measures.<ref>{{cite web|author=Associated Press|title=In The Nation|date=September 15, 1975|publisher=''The Ledger''|accessdate=November 10, 2009|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aDETAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EPsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3819,4549454}}</ref> When the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico, forecasters suggested that the storm would continue northward and strike the area near [[Mobile Bay]]. Contrary to predictions, by late on September 22, the storm had turned northeast, and some residents of Florida were still unaware of the storm's threat despite the issuance of hurricane warnings 24 hours in advance.<ref name="Barnes 2007">Barnes, pp. 240<U+2013>241</ref>  As a result, evacuations were delayed to an extent.<ref name="PRELIM"/> During the morning hours of September 23, civil preparedness workers drove through coastal towns with loudspeakers advising people to seek shelter. Due of the intensity of the approaching hurricane, evacuations along the coast were ultimately thorough, despite the initial delay. It was reported that 99% of [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] residents along the beach had left their homes, and overall, 100,000 people evacuated from areas in Louisiana through Florida.<ref name="Barnes 2007"/>

A statement issued by the [[National Weather Service]] urged people in nine Florida counties to complete preparations for the hurricane. Residents were told to secure loose objects and move watercraft to safe harbors.<ref>{{cite web|author=Masters, Kay|title=Eloise Aims At Pensacola|date=September 22, 1975|publisher=''The Evening Independent''|accessdate=November 10, 2009|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cv4LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GlgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6451,1417839}}</ref> Homes along the coast were boarded up by their owners,<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|title=Hurricane Eloise Heads for Mobile and Pensacola|date=September 22, 1975|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|accessdate=November 10, 2009|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/679446592.html?dids=679446592:679446592&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Sep+22%2C+1975&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Hurricane+Eloise+Heads+for+Mobile+and+Pensacola&pqatl=google}}</ref> while offshore, workers were removed from oil platforms.

As a weak tropical depression, the storm brought {{convert|5|to|10|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rainfall to portions of the [[Leeward Islands]], including [[St. Kitts]] and [[St. Martin]]. Lighter precipitation fell on the more northern islands. Winds were light in these areas.<ref name="PRELIM"/>

Despite being only a tropical storm while passing by Puerto Rico, Eloise produced extreme amounts of rainfall on the island, peaking at {{convert|33.29|in|mm}} in Dos Bocas. Other totals of {{convert|10|to|20|in|mm|abbr=on}} were common.<ref name="HPC"/> The heavy rains resulted in severe flash flooding which killed 34 people, mostly from drownings, and left $60 million in damages.<ref name="Barnes3">Barnes, pp. 239<U+2013>240</ref> Several hundred people were injured, and the storm forced over 6,000 residents from their homes. Dozens of towns and villages were flooded, though [[Utuado, Puerto Rico|Utuado]], with a population of 35,000 at the time, was hit the hardest. The situation in that town was described as a "total disaster"; four housing developments were under water, and dozens of vehicles were washed away.<ref>{{cite web|author=Associated Press|title=Hurricane Eloise Storm Kills 25 In Puerto Rico; Slams Dominican Republic|date=September 17, 1975|publisher=''The Evening Independent''|accessdate=November 10, 2009|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bv4LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GlgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5307,239172}}</ref> The flood waters submerged thousands of miles of roads and put several bridges out-of-service.<ref name="newspaper2"/>

As the storm proceeded westward, it dropped heavy rainfall throughout eastern and southern Hispaniola. Widespread flooding impacted Haiti and the Dominican Republic, leaving a total of 25 people dead. Although the most intense winds remained offshore, a gust of {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} was recorded at [[Cape Enga<U+00F1>o (Dominican Republic)|Cape Enga<U+00F1>o]].<ref name="PRELIM"/> [[San Felipe de Puerto Plata|Puerto Plata]] on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic was also battered by high winds and heavy rain.

Rain and wind from the storm affected the southern [[Bahamas]], Cuba, [[Jamaica]], the [[Cayman Islands]], and the northern Yucatan Peninsula. Since the storm was primarily weak while passing by these areas, no significant damage was reported.<ref name="PRELIM"/> Eloise brought torrential rainfall and winds of {{convert|20|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in southeastern Cuba, inflicting $65,000 in damage. Personnel on the base were moved to designated hurricane shelters in advance of the storm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pomfret, John|title=The History of Guantanamo Bay, Vol. II 1964 - 1982|date=|publisher=Naval Station Guantanamo Bay|accessdate=June 23, 2011|url=https://cnic.navy.mil/Guantanamo/AboutGTMO/gtmohistgeneral/gtmohistmurphy/gtmohistmurphyvol2/gtmohistmurphyvol2ch2/gtmohistmurphyvol2ch2}}</ref>

===Florida===
Eloise came ashore along the coast of northern Florida as a Category 3 storm producing winds of {{convert|90|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} with gusts that reached {{convert|155|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name="PRELIM"/> Sustained winds were likely higher, but due to the sparsity of recording stations, few official records exist. The winds in the area were reportedly the strongest of the century.<ref name="Barnes 2007"/> Hurricane-force winds occurred from [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida|Fort Walton Beach]] through Panama City. Along the coast, tides ran {{convert|12|to|16|ft|m|abbr=on}} above normal, peaking at {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Hurricane Eloise spawned several tornadoes as it pressed inland.<ref name="PRELIM"/> In general, rainfall ranged from {{convert|4|to|8|in|mm|abbr=on}}; at the [[Eglin Air Force Base]] near [[Valparaiso, Florida|Valparaiso]], however, the hurricane dropped {{convert|14.9|in|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation.<ref name="HPC"/> The heaviest rainfall was usually confined to northwest of the storm's track, and a number of locations to the east of Eloise's center picked up less than {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain.<ref name="PRELIM"/>

Damage from the hurricane was widespread. Fort Walton Beach, where hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed, was hit particularly hard. In some areas, the storm surge washed away buildings demolished by the strong winds. The winds cleared certain locations of trees and buried properties and roads under sand. Throughout northwest Florida, an estimated 8,000 people suffered storm-related losses, and 500 businesses were completely destroyed. An article in the ''[[Tallahassee Democrat]]'' reported that "Cottages, motels, restaurants, convenience stores and other beach businesses were strewn across the highway in a tangle of down power poles, lines and busted mains."<ref name="Barnes 2007"/> A {{convert|2100|acre|km2|adj=on}} shrimp farm at Panama City, the first of its kind, was effectively lost. The storm destroyed the farm's prospective initial harvest, {{convert|1500000|lb|kg}} of shrimp enclosed in a system of nets and enclosures. The president of the company described the subsequent events as six months of extreme turmoil in an effort to recover, followed by a quick and steady rebound. By the spring of 1976, the company became confident in financial success and full recovery.<ref name="Barnes3"/><ref>{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|title=Shrimp farm rebounding|date=April 5, 1976|publisher=''St. Petersburg Times''|accessdate=June 21, 2011|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tqVjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TF0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6464,4038672&dq=hurricane-eloise+disaster&hl=en}}</ref>
[[File:Hurricane Eloise Florida damage.jpg|right|360px|thumb|Aerial view of the Florida Panhandle damage]]

The storm caused severe [[beach erosion]] in [[Bay County, Florida|Bay County]]; approximately {{convert|801000|cuyd|m3|link=on}} of sand was removed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Beaches and Shores Resource Center|date=July 1996|title=Coastal Construction Control Line Review and Reestablishment Study for Bay County|publisher=Florida State University|accessdate=November 10, 2009|url=http://beach10.beaches.fsu.edu/download/cccl/baycccl.pdf}}</ref> Storm-related changes in the coastal topography resulted in extensive structural damage in the [[Panama City Beach, Florida|Panama City Beach]] area. The most severe damage was concentrated in a {{convert|22|mi|km|abbr=on}} area of the shore east of the hurricane's eye, and storm surge peaked in intensity for no more than a half hour according to preliminary estimates. Much of the resultant damage came as a result of foundation undermining, which was compared to that of the [[New England hurricane of 1938]]. Although Eloise was not abnormally strong, the geographicy setting and building standards in the area were blamed for the destruction of many homes and businesses.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Morton, Robert A.|title=Effects of Hurricane Eloise on beach and coastal structures, Florida Panhandle|year=1976|volume=4|issue=5|pages=277<U+2013>280|journal=Geology|doi=10.1130/0091-7613|publisher=Geological Society of America}}</ref> Monetary losses from property damage in Panama City Beach alone totaled about $50 million.<ref name="swash"/>

===Elsewhere in the United States===
As the hurricane progressed inland, it passed over eastern Alabama, generating strong winds. A gust of {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} was recorded northeast of [[Ozark, Alabama|Ozark]]. Winds elsewhere in the state ranged from around {{convert|35|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|88|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Precipitation in Alabama peaked at {{convert|5.54|in|mm|abbr=on}}.
