The '''Intentona de Yauco''' a.k.a. the "Attempted Coup of Yauco" of 1897, was the second and last major revolt against Spanish colonial rule in Puerto Rico, staged by Puerto Rico's pro-independence movement.

The first major revolt against Spanish rule in the island was in 1868 and is known as [[El Grito de Lares]]. After the failure of the short lived rebellion many of the local leaders and participants were arrested and some were executed. Those who survived their prison terms were later released and some went into exile. Shortly after the revolt Spain gave the island many liberal reforms. It extended to Puerto Rico some of the liberal constitution that it had allowed it's previous colonies in South America. Puerto Rico received provincial status and Spanish Citizenship was granted to the criollos. Some political reforms granted were allowing Puerto Ricans to participate in special elections and to organize themselves into officially recognized political parties.<ref>[http://www.elboricua.com/lares.html El Boricua]</ref> During the years that followed there were minor protests against Spanish rule in various towns of the island which were quickly subdued by the Spanish authorities.

Leaders of "El Grito de Lares", who were in exile in [[New York City]], joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, founded in December 8, 1895, and continued their quest for Puerto Rican independence. There, with the aid of the local leaders of the independence movement of the town of Yauco, they organized another uprising. The 1897 uprising or coup, which became known as the "Intentona de Yauco". The local conservative political factions, which believed that such an attempt would be a threat to their struggle for autonomy, opposed such an action. Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule.<ref name="HMPR">"Historia militar de Puerto Rico"; by [[Hector Andres Negroni]] (Author); Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Language: Spanish; ISBN-10: 8478441387; ISBN-13: 978-8478441389</ref>            
==Prelude==
On September 23, 1868, the first major uprising against Spanish colonial rule in Puerto Rico occurred in the town of [[Lares]]. The uprising, which was planned by Puerto Rican patriots, Dr. [[Ram<U+00F3>n Emeterio Betances]] and [[Segundo Ruiz Belvis]], was carried out by several revolutionary cells in the island led by [[Manuel Rojas]], [[Mathias Brugman]], [[Mariana Bracetti]], [[Juan Rius Rivera]], Juan de Mata Terreforte and Aurelio M<U+00E9>ndez Martinez among others. They took control of Lares and then departed to take over the next town, [[San Sebastian, Puerto Rico|San Sebasti<U+00E1>n del Pepino]]. The Spanish militia, however, surprised the group with strong resistance, causing great confusion among the armed rebels who, led by Manuel Rojas, retreated back to Lares. Upon an order from the governor, Juli<U+00E1>n Pav<U+00ED>a, the Spanish militia soon rounded up the rebels and quickly brought the insurrection to an end. 

Some 475 rebels, among them Manuel Rojas, Mariana Bracetti and Juan Rius Rivera were imprisoned in the local prison of the city [[Arecibo]]. On November 17, a military court imposed the death penalty, for treason and sedition, on all the prisoners. Meanwhile, in Madrid, Eugenio Mar<U+00ED>a de Hostos and other prominent Puerto Ricans were successful in interceding with President Francisco Serrano, who had himself just led a revolution against the monarchy in Spain. In an effort to appease the already tense atmosphere on the island, the incoming governor, Jos<U+00E9> Laureano Sanz, dictated a general amnesty early in 1869 and all prisoners were released. Betances, Rojas, Rius Rivera, Terreforte, M<U+00E9>ndez Martinez, and many more were sent into exile.<ref>Peres Moris, Jos<U+00E9>, [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/lhbpr.02727 Historia de la Insurrecci<U+00F3>n de Lares, 1871]</ref>

The Spanish Crown feared losing the only two colonies which it had left in the [[Western Hemisphere]], Puerto Rico and [[Cuba]] to independence insurgents. As a result of the Lares uprising Spain granted Puerto Rico provincial status and it's native Spanish Citizenship. Puerto Ricans were also allowed to participate in special elections and to organize officially recognized political parties.<ref>Moscoso, Francisco, ''La Revoluci<U+00F3>n Puertorrique<U+00F1>a de 1868: El Grito de Lares,'' Instituto de Cultura Puertorrique<U+00F1>a, 2003</ref>

During the years immediately following the Grito, there were minor pro-independence protests and skirmishes with the Spanish authorities in [[Las Mar<U+00ED>as, Puerto Rico|Las Mar<U+00ED>as]], [[Adjuntas]], [[Utuado]], [[Vieques]], [[Bayam<U+00F3>n]], [[Ciales, Puerto Rico|Ciales]] and [[Toa Baja]] (Palo Seco).<ref>Moscoso, Francisco, as quoted by Collado Schwarz, <U+00C1>ngel, ''Voces de la Cultura,'' Fundaci<U+00F3>n La Voz del Centro, San Juan, Puerto Rico, 2005</ref>

On July 1971, a group of people attacked Spanish soldiers and members of the local militia in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], Puerto Rico's capital. Lieutenant General Gabriel Baldrich, the Spanish appointed governor declared martial law.<ref name="HMPR">"Historia militar de Puerto Rico"; by [[Hector Andres Negroni]] (Author); Page: 301; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Language: Spanish; ISBN-10: 8478441387; ISBN-13: 978-8478441389</ref> Some of the protests were between the liberal and conservative political factions of the island and were not pro-independence intended. Among these were the "Motin de Yabucoa" of 1871, "La Estrella" and the "Sucesos de Camuy" of 1873.<ref name="HMPR">"Historia militar de Puerto Rico"; by [[Hector Andres Negroni]] (Author); Pages: 303-04; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Language: Spanish; ISBN-10: 8478441387; ISBN-13: 978-8478441389</ref> 

On December 8, 1895, the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee was founded in New York City. This group promoted the ideal of Puerto Rican independence from Spain and included participants of "El Grito de Lares" who were exiled, such as Ramon Emiterio Betances, Juan Rius Rivera, Juan de Mata Terreforte and Aurelio M<U+00E9>ndez Martinez among it's members. Terreforte was named by the committee it's the Vice-President.<ref name="EPR">[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/print_version.cfm?ref=06101303 Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico]</ref> In 1892, Terreforte and the members of the Revolutionary committee adopted the design (which is the current design) of a flag similar to the Cuban Flag, but with it's colors inverted as the flag to represent the Republic of Puerto Rico.<ref name="EPR"/>

==Intentona de Yauco==
[[File:Antonio Mattei Lluberas.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Antonio Mattei Lluberas]]
In 1896, a group of "Yaucanos" (as the natives of Yauco are known) who believed in full independence of Puerto Rico joined forces and met in ''Barrio Balinas'' of Yauco where they made plans to overthrow the government. The group was led by Mateo Mercado and Antonio Mattei Lluberas, a wealthy coffee plantation owner. On December of that year, the local Civil Guard discovered their plans and proceeded to arrest all those involved who, besides Mercado and Mattei Lluveras, included Dario and Carlos Franchesi and  Emiliano Lavergue, however they were soon released and returned to their respective homes.<ref name="HMPR">"Historia militar de Puerto Rico"; by [[Hector Andres Negroni]] (Author); Pages: 305-06; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Language: Spanish; ISBN-10: 8478441387; ISBN-13: 978-8478441389</ref>

In 1897, Mattei Lluveras visited the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. There he met with Ramon Emiterio Betances, Juan de Mata Terreforte and Aurelio M<U+00E9>ndez Martinez and together they proceeded to plan a major coup. The uprising was to be directed by Betances, organized by Mendez Mercado and the armed forces were to be commanded by General Rius Rivera. At the time Rius Rivera, who joined [[Jose Marti]]'s struggle for Cuban independence as a member of the Cuban Liberation Army, was the Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army of the West.<ref>[http://solidaridad_cuba.tripod.com/id50.html ''Noticias de la XVII Brigada Juan Rius Rivera en Cuba'']</ref>
[[Image:Casona C<U+00E9>sari .gif|left|thumb|House of Antonio Mattei Lluberas, known as "Casa Mattei Lluberas"]]
In accordance to the plan, Mattei Lluberas purchased 30,000 which were to be distributed amongst the rebels. Mattei Lluberas returned to Puerto Rico with a [[Flag of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican flag]] and began to proceed with the plans of the revolt with his group. The Budet Rivera brothers established an insurgent training camp in the farm of Gullermo Velazco. Fellow rebels, Gerardo Forest Velez and Agustin F. Morales (himself a general in the Army of [[Dominican Republic]], were in charge of propaganda and traveled throughout the island seeking public support for their cause. Cuban revolutionist Tomas Estrada Palma, offered a contribution of 500 rifles with half a million rounds of ammunition and his comrade offered a steamship with an invading force of 200 men under the command of General Agustin F. Morales. The revolution was set for the beginning of the month of December 1897.<ref name="MHPR">"Historia militar de Puerto Rico"; by [[Hector Andres Negroni]] (Author); Pages: 307; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Language: Spanish; ISBN-10: 8478441387; ISBN-13: 978-8478441389</ref>

The political situation at the time in Puerto Rico was different then the one in 1868, when "El Grito de Lares" occurred. [[Luis Mu<U+00F1>oz Rivera]] and his Autonomist party had signed a pact with Praxedes Mateo Sagasta, the leader of the Spanish Liberal Party, which stated that if he and the liberals assumed power in Spain, he would grant Puerto Rico autonomy. Thus, the political leaders of Puerto Rico believed that any attempt by the separatist movement to seek full independence for the island would be a threat to what they were trying to accomplish and instead of being granted more autonomy, the island would be dealt with harshly by the Spanish authorities.<ref>[http://www.lasculturas.com/aa/bio/bioMunozRivera.htm Resident Commissioner Unionist of Puerto Rico]</ref> Therefore, when the Mayor of Yauco, Francisco Lluch Barreras heard the rumors of the planned uprising, he immediately notified General Sabas Mar<U+00ED>n Gonz<U+00E1>lez the governor of the island.
[[File:Intentona de Yauco.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Flag flown by Fidel V<U+00E9>lez and his men during the "Intentona de Yauco" revolt]]
Fidel Velez, a native of [[Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico|Sabana Grande]] and one of the separatist leaders, found out that the Spanish authorities knew about their plans and immediately held a meeting with Mattei Lluberas and the other leaders. Fearing that they all would soon be arrested, he demanded that the insurrection start immediately and not in December. In the discussion that followed, the other leaders did not agree with him, fearing that such a haste action would lead to the same disastrous results of ''El Grito de Lares''.<ref name="MHPR"/>

On March 24, 1897, Fidel Velez and his men met at Susua Arriba, just outside of Yauco. They unfurled the Puerto Rican flag for the first time in Puerto Rican soil.<ref>[http://joseosvaldo.freeyellow.com/Sabiausted.htm Sabia Usted?] {{es icon}}, Sabana Grande, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009</ref><ref>[http://flagspot.net/flags/pr.html#f The Flag], Flags of the World, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009</ref> and marched towards the town. They planned to attack the barracks of Spanish Civil Guard with the aim of gaining control of the arms and ammunition which were stored there. The plan did not suceed because when they arrived they were ambushed by the Spanish forces who had set up positions and were waiting. A firefight ensued upon the arrival of the group and the rebels quickly retreated. On March 26, another group headed by Jose Nicolas Quinnoes Torres and Ramon Torres attempted to fight the Spaniards in a barrio called "Quebradas" of Yauco, however said revolt also failed.<ref name="MHPR"/> Over 150 rebels were arrested, accussed of various crimes against the state and sent to prison in the city of [[Ponce]]. Velez fleed to [[St. Thomas]] were he lived in exile, while Mattei Lluberas went into exile in New York City and joined a group known as the "Puerto Rican Commission".<ref>[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Enciclopedia_Ilustrada/Documentos_historicos/Protagonistas/P12.htm Projecto Salon Hogar]</ref>

==Aftermath==

Sagasta's party won the elections in Spain and on November 25, 1897, Spain granted Puerto Rico autonomy. Mu<U+00F1>oz Rivera served as Secretary of Grace, Justice and Government and Chief of the Cabinet for the independent Government of Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mar<U+00ED>n|first=Ram<U+00F3>n|title=Las fiestas populares de Ponce|publisher=Editorial UPR|date=1994|pages=37|isbn=0847701891|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rzyA0BhHHCIC&pg=PA36&dq=luis+munoz+rivera+Cepeda&as_brr=3#PPA37,M1|accessdate=2009-03-11|language=Spanish}}</ref> In December 1897, those who participated in the ''Intentona de Yauco'' were granted clemency and released from jail.

Following the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)#Sinking|sinking of the battleship ''Maine'']] in Havana harbor, Cuba, the United States forwarded an ultimatum to Spain to withdraw from Cuba. In response, Spain broke off diplomatic relations with the United States, and on April 23, 1898, Spain [[Declaration of war|declared war]]. On April 25, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] declared that a state of war between the United States and Spain had existed since April 20.<ref name=Hakim_p144-149> {{harvnb|Hakim|1994|pp=144-149}}</ref> One of the United States' principal objectives in the Spanish-American War was to take control of Spanish possessions in the Atlantic &mdash; Puerto Rico and Cuba.<ref name=World1898>

Mattei Lluveras and the Puerto Rican Commission in New York had been trying to convince President [[William McKinley]] to invade Puerto Rico for sometime. After Cuba was taken, President McKinley approved the land invasion of Puerto Rico. A convoy of ships left [[Tampa, Florida]] and on July 21 another convoy departed from [[Guant<U+00E1>namo]] for a 4 day journey to Puerto Rico.<ref name="AAMPR">
