'''Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia''' (later '''Duchess of Edinburgh''' and '''Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha'''; [[17 October]] [[1853]] <U+2013> [[24 October]] [[1920]]) was a daughter of [[Alexander II of Russia]] and [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Empress Maria Alexandrovna]]. Maria became the wife of [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]], the second son of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. 

From 1893 until her death, she had the distinction of being a Russian Grand Duchess (by birth), a British Royal Duchess (by marriage), and the consort (and later widow) of a German Sovereign Duke.

==Early life==
The Duchess was born at [[Tsarskoye Selo]], Russia, the second daughter of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II, Emperor of Russia]] (who was assassinated in 1881) and his wife [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine]], legal daughter of [[Ludwig II, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine]], yet it was openly rumoured her father was actually [[August von Senarclens de Grancy|Baron Augustus de Senarclens]], her mother's chamberlain. She was the aunt of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]]  who was murdered in 1918. Her brother, [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia]]  was assassinated in [[Moscow]] in 1905, and another brother, [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia]]  was shot in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1919.

==Marriage== 
On [[23 January]], [[1874]] at the [[Winter Palace]], [[St. Petersburg]], the Grand Duchess Marie married His Royal Highness [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|The Duke of Edinburgh]], the second son of [[Queen Victoria]]. To commemorate the occasion, a small English bakery made the now-internationally popular [[Marie biscuit]], with the Duchess' name imprinted on the its top.<ref>{{Citation | last=La Tienda| title=2-Pack Maria Cookies by Cuetera| url=http://www.tienda.com/food/products/co-01-2.html| accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref> The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh made their public entry into [[London]] on [[12 March]]. 

The marriage, however, was not to become a happy one, and the bride was thought haughty by London Society. Furthermore, Tsar Alexander II's insistence that his daughter be styled "Her Imperial Highness" and have precedence over the [[Alexandra of Denmark|then Princess of Wales]] infuriated Queen Victoria. The Queen insisted that the style "[[Royal Highness|Her Royal Highness]]" Marie Alexandrovna acquired upon marriage, should always precede the style "Her Imperial Highness," which was hers by birth. For her part, the new Duchess of Edinburgh apparently resented the fact that the Princess of Wales, who was the daughter of [[Christian IX of Denmark|The ''King'' of Denmark]], took precedence over her, the daughter of The ''Emperor'' of Russia. After the marriage, Marie was varyingly referred to as ''Her Royal Highness'', ''Her Royal & Imperial Highness'', and ''Her Imperial & Royal Highness''.

Queen Victoria granted her precedence immediately after the Princess of Wales. Her father gave her the then staggering sum of <U+00A3>100,000 as a dowry, plus an annual allowance of <U+00A3>28,000.

==Saxe-Coburg and Gotha==
On the death of his uncle, [[Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], on [[22 August]] [[1893]], the vacant Duchy fell to the Duke of Edinburgh, since his elder brother the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] had renounced his right to the succession. He surrendered his British allowance of <U+00A3>15,000 a year and his seats in the [[House of Lords]] and the [[Privy Council]], but retained the <U+00A3>10,000 granted on his marriage in order to maintain [[Clarence House]] as his London residence. Upon her husband's ascension to the Ducal throne, the Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna became Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, in addition to being Duchess of Edinburgh. As the consort of a Sovereign German Duke, she technically outranked her sisters-in-law at Queen Victoria's [[Diamond Jubilee#Diamond Jubilee for Queen Victoria|Diamond Jubilee]] celebrations. 

The couple's only son, [[Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Hereditary Prince Alfred]], became involved in a scandal involving his mistress and shot himself in January 1899, in the midst of his parents' twenty-fifth wedding anniversary celebrations. He survived, but his embarrassed parents sent him off to [[Meran]] to recover, where he died two weeks later, on 6 February. The Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha died of throat cancer on [[30 July]] [[1900]] at Rosenau Castle in [[Coburg (district)|Coburg]]. The Ducal throne passed to his nephew, [[Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Albany]]. The Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha continued to reside in Coburg.

}}

==Later life==
She died in October 1920 in [[Z<U+00FC>rich]], [[Switzerland]] apparently after receiving a telegram addressed to her as "Frau Coburg"; {{Fact|date=December 2008}} she was buried in the Ducal Family's cemetery outside Coburg. Of her four daughters, the Queen of Romania was forbidden to attend or to travel to Germany due to the recent war, in which Germany and Romania had fought on opposite sides.

Trivia 

Marie's sisters-in-law were Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom (Princess Alexandra of Denmark) and Empress Marie Feodorovna (Princess Dagmar of Denmark).  Her father's niece, her cousin Olga, married George I King of the Hellenes.  Alexandra, Dagmar, and George were sisters and brother.  Her brother-in-law Edward VII by marriage married her sister-in-law.  Her husband Prince Alfred Duke of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.
