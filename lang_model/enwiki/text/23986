'''Kieran Edward Richardson''' (born 21 October 1984) is an [[England|English]] [[Association football|footballer]] currently playing for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. He is a left-sided [[midfielder]] who is also comfortable playing in central midfield. He has also played at [[Defender (association football)#Full back|left back]] on occasion. He often captained Sunderland when former captain [[Dean Whitehead]] did not start the match.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Richardson was schooled at the private and non-selective Riverston Independent Day School in [[Lee, London]]. He began playing football at Parkwood Primary School and his talent was very apparent at this young age, he was made captain of his school team and was invited to train with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].

He then moved to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] where he would begin training professionally. However, before he made his debut for the Londoners, he was signed by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 2001. He is the cousin of ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' contestant [[Charley Uchea]].

==Manchester United==
During his first season at Manchester United, Richardson established his place as a regular on [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|United's reserve team]]. He was given squad number 42 for the first team, but he failed to make his debut with them.

===2002<U+2013>03 season===
During summer 2002, Richardson was fully involved with the first team during their pre-season. Subsequently he made his first appearance for Manchester United on 23 October 2002 when coming on as a late substitute in a match against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. He then scored his first goal in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] on 5 November 2002 against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Beckham denies bold Leicester|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2390931.stm|work=[[BBC]]|date=5 November 2002|accessdate=24 August 2009}}</ref> although he had yet to make his Premiership debut for the club at that time. Richardson enjoyed his first breakthrough during the [[2002<U+2013>03 in English football|2002<U+2013>03 season]] appearing nine times and scoring a goal for the first team. He also played a significant role in Manchester United's youth team's win of the 2003 [[FA Youth Cup]].

===2003<U+2013>04 season===
At the start of [[2003<U+2013>04 in English football|2003<U+2013>04 season]], he was given squad number 23. This suggested that he may be more involved with the first team than during the previous season. However, during this season he failed to stake his claim for the first team. He only appeared three times, all of them in League Cup and [[FA Cup]].

===2004<U+2013>05 season===
During the [[2004<U+2013>05 in English football|2004<U+2013>05 season]], he started to become more involved with the first team. He had already made nine appearances and scored one goal during the first half of the season. However during the January [[transfer window]], [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] decided to loan him out in order for him to gain more first team experience.

Richardson was linked with a loan move to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], but Ferguson said there was no chance as other players had gone on loan.<ref>{{cite news|title=Richardson Canaries loan denied|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/4194659.stm|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=21 January 2005|accessdate=14 June 2007}}</ref> However, when former Manchester United captain [[Bryan Robson]], manager of [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], enquired about loaning Richardson, the deal was done straight away.<ref>{{cite news|title=Man Utd winger signs for Baggies|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/4218725.stm|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=29 January 2005|accessdate=14 June 2007}}</ref> Under Robson, Richardson made an instant impact on West Brom's quest to escape relegation. He was a regular in West Brom's first eleven, playing in central midfield. He scored three goals from 12 appearances as West Bromwich successfully avoided relegation, despite starting the final day of the season on the bottom of the table. Despite this his confrontational demeanor won him no respect with opposing fans, particularly at Norwich, where he received a pastie thrown from row Q (impressive in itself) to the face after taunting them.<ref>{{cite news|title=West Brom pay price for leaving back door open|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2354961/West-Brom-pay-price-for-leaving-back-door-open.html|work=Telegraph.co.uk|publisher=Telegraph|date=7 February 2005|accessdate=6 December 2009 | location=London | first=Duncan | last=White}}</ref>.

===2005<U+2013>06 season===
At the start of [[2005<U+2013>06 in English football|2005<U+2013>06 season]], Richardson declined a further loan spell at West Brom in an attempt to win a regular place at Old Trafford.<ref>{{cite news|title=Richardson opts for Man Utd stay|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/4675927.stm|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=3 August 2005|accessdate=14 June 2007}}</ref> He made his break in Manchester United's first eleven in September 2005, when he appeared as an emergency left back, in place of the injured [[Gabriel Heinze]]. He soon returned to midfield however, where he made several good performances. In October, Richardson celebrated his 21st birthday by signing a new four-year contract with United.<ref>{{cite news|title=Richardson signs new Man Utd deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/4364082.stm|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=21 October 2005|accessdate=14 June 2007}}</ref> He went on to appear 36 times and score six goals that season.

===2006<U+2013>07 season===
During the [[2006<U+2013>07 in English football|2006<U+2013>07 season]], Richardson's chances to prove his mettle mainly came in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and the [[FA Cup]]. However, Richardson felt Sir Alex Ferguson's wrath as the youngster shouldered some of the blame for United's below-par performance against [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] in the League Cup. Ferguson publicly declared that Richardson and others would benefit from spending some time in United's reserve team. He scored one of United's goals in the 4<U+2013>1 FA Cup semi-final win over [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], that put them in the final at the new [[Wembley Stadium]]. Richardson was disliked by many United fans on and off the field for his lazy and arrogant attitude and was nicknamed 'Lord Snooty' by United fanzine [[Red Issue]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Lord Snooty Put In His Place|url=http://www.redissue.co.uk/news/loadnews.asp?cid=TMNW&id=305664|work=Red Issue|date=27 October 2006|accessdate=23 October 2007}}</ref>

==Sunderland==
On 16 July 2007, [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] paid Manchester United an undisclosed fee, reported to be in the region of <U+00A3>5.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sunderland sign winger Richardson|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/6901589.stm|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=16 July 2007|accessdate=16 July 2007}}</ref> Richardson signed a four-year deal with the Black Cats,<ref>{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Coppack|title=Sunderland sign Richardson|url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&newsid=444848|work=[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]|publisher=Manchester United|date=16 July 2007|accessdate=16 July 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Alexander|title=Keane signs Richardson|url=http://www.safc.com/news/?page_id=12670|date=16 July 2007|accessdate=16 July 2007|publisher=[[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]}}</ref> and linked up with former United captain Roy Keane.

====2007<U+2013>08 season====
After an indifferent start, it was discovered that he had a [[stress fracture]] of the spine. This led to his being out of action for almost four months.<ref>{{cite news|title=Richardson blow for Black Cats|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/article.html?in_article_id=65813&in_page_id=43|work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]|date=12 September 2007|accessdate=7 September 2009}}</ref> He scored his first goal for Sunderland on 29 December 2007 against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sunderland vs Bolton match report|url=http://www.safc.com/match/?page_id=13879&fixture=2848103&t=6|publisher=Sunderland|date=29 December 2007|accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref> Richardson scored two goals in the 2<U+2013>0 win against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] at the [[Stadium of Light]] on 13 January 2008, also striking the bar to miss out on his [[hat-trick]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sunderland vs Portsmouth match report|url=http://www.safc.com/match/?page_id=13964&fixture=2924211|publisher=Sunderland|date=13 January 2008|accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref> Since then he suffered a hamstring injury in training then this injury recurred in Sunderland's 3<U+2013>0 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield. 

====2008<U+2013>09 season====
On 23 August 2008, Kieran scored against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the 56th minute, in a 2<U+2013>1 win at [[White Hart Lane]]. On 25 October 2008, Richardson scored the winning goal in the [[Tyne<U+2013>Wear derby]], with a free kick. A week earlier away at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], Richardson's free kick hit the post three times and he had a later free kick disallowed as [[Pascal Chimbonda]] was adjudged to be pushing in the wall. Richardson attracted interest from both [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and rivals [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the 2009 January transfer window, but manager [[Ricky Sbragia]] insisted he is not for sale. 

====2009<U+2013>10 season====
Richardson scored his first goal of the 2009<U+2013>10 season with an equaliser against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] at home, which ended 2<U+2013>2. Kieran has been used in several positions this season, whilst predominantly featuring in central midfield he also enjoyed a run of form at left-back <U+2013> his performances there led to many touting him as a surprise [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] inclusion. <ref> http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_6098403,00.html </ref>

====2010<U+2013>11 season====

In the build up to the new season Kieran Richardson signed a new three year deal at the Stadium of Light, keeping him at the club for another 3 years. He is expected to be the clubs first choice leftback for the new season, a role he has adapted to under Bruce's management. Richardson replaced George McCartney as number 3 on the eve of the opening day.

==International career==
During his stay at West Brom, he won his first cap for the [[England national under-21 football team|England U21]] team on 8 February 2005 in a friendly match against [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands U21]] team. After a series of convincing performances for West Brom, he won a late call-up for [[England national football team|England]]'s trip to the [[United States]] at the end of the [[2004<U+2013>05 in English football|2004<U+2013>05 season]]. He started the match against the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]] and scored twice on his England debut, including one directly from a free kick. He earned praise from England manager [[Sven-G<U+00F6>ran Eriksson]], who described Richardson's debut as "fantastic".<ref>{{cite news|title=Eriksson joy at Richardson debut|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4570057.stm|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=29 May 2005|accessdate=14 June 2007}}</ref> He also appeared as a substitute on England's second match in the United States against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]].

After earning senior caps, Richardson also returned to the Under-21 squad, playing in both legs of the England U21s' crucial [[2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|European Championship]] qualification play-off against [[France national under-21 football team|France U21]]s, which they lost 3<U+2013>2 on [[Playoff format#Total points series (aggregate)|aggregate]]. The decisive goal came in the 85th minute of the second leg, when Richardson brought down [[Lassana Diarra]] in the box and the resulting penalty was converted.

He then made two further substitute appearances during England's [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualification]] against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in [[Cardiff]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]] in [[Old Trafford]]. The latter was his home England debut. However, he was not selected by [[Sven-G<U+00F6>ran Eriksson]] in England's [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] squad.

In [[2006<U+2013>07 in English football|2006<U+2013>07]], he continued to be selected by newly appointed England manager [[Steve McClaren]] and made several substitute appearances. He went on to make further appearances for the England U21 squad, for whom he was eligible to play until the end of the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]], where he made three appearances. However, he has neither started nor scored for the England senior team since his debut.
