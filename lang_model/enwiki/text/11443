The '''Mole Harbor Shelter Lookout/Cabin''' is a historic backcountry shelter in the [[Admiralty Island National Monument]], part of the [[Tongass National Forest]] in [[Southeast Alaska]].  It is one of a number of such facilities built by [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) on the Admiralty Island Canoe Route between 1933 and 1937.  This cabin, a three-sided Adirondack-style log structure with shake walls and roof, was built in 1936.  The cabin, situated overlooking a tidal flat near the head of Mole Harbor on the east side of the island, continues to be maintained by the Forest Service.  It is accessible via water, or by a trail from Lake Alexander.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/95001297.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for Mole Harbor Shelter Cabin|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-08-26}}</ref>
