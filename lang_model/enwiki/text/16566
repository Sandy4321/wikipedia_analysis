The '''Phaeophyceae''' or '''brown algae''' (singular: ''alga''), is a large group of mostly [[Ocean|marine]] multicellular [[algae]], including many [[seaweed]]s of colder [[Northern Hemisphere]] waters. They play an important role in marine environments both as food, and for the habitats they form. For instance ''[[Macrocystis]]'', a member of the [[Laminariales]] or [[kelp]]s, may reach 60&nbsp;m in length, and forms prominent underwater [[kelp forest|forests]]. Another example is ''[[Sargassum]]'', which creates unique habitats in the tropical waters of the [[Sargasso Sea]]. Many brown algae such as members of the order [[Fucales]] are commonly found along rocky seashores. Some members of the class are used as food for humans.

Worldwide there are about 1500-2000 [[species]] of brown algae.<ref name="Hoek">{{cite book

Brown algae belong to a very large group, the [[Heterokont]]ophyta, a [[eukaryotic]] group of organisms distinguished most prominently by having [[chloroplasts]] surrounded by four membranes, suggesting an origin from a symbiotic relationship between a basal eukaryote and another eukaryotic organism. Most brown algae contain the pigment [[fucoxanthin]], which is responsible for the distinctive greenish-brown color that gives them their name. Brown algae are unique among heterokonts in developing into multicellular forms with [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated]] [[Biological tissue|tissues]], but they reproduce by means of [[Flagellum|flagellate]] [[spore]]s and [[gamete]]s, which closely resemble other heterokont cells. Genetic studies show their closest relatives to be the [[yellow-green algae]].

==Morphology==

Brown algae exist in a wide range of sizes and forms.  The smallest members of the group grow as tiny, feathery tufts of threadlike [[Cell (biology)|cells]] no more than a few centimeters long.<ref name="Connor1989">{{cite book | last=Connor | first=J. | coauthor=Baxter, C. | year=1989 | title=Kelp Forests | publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium | isbn=1878244019 }}</ref>  Some species even have a stage in their life cycle that consists of only a few cells, making the entire alga microscopic.  Other groups of brown algae grow to much larger sizes.  The leathery [[kelp]]s and [[rockweed]]s are often the most conspicuous algae in their habitats.<ref name="Dittmer1964">{{cite book | last=Dittmer | first=Howard J. | year=1964 | title=Phylogeny and Form in the Plant Kingdom | pages=115<U+2013>137 | location=Princeton, NJ | publisher=D.

In form, the brown algae range from small crusts or cushions<ref name="Jones62">{{cite journal | last=Jones | first=W. E. | year=1962 | title=A key to the genera of the British seaweeds | journal=Field Studies | volume=1 | issue=4 | pages=1-32 }}</ref> to leafy free-floating mats formed by species of ''[[Sargassum]]''.  They may consist of delicate felt-like strands of cells, as in ''[[Ectocarpus]]'', or of foot-long flattened branches resembling a fan, as in ''[[Padina (alga)|Padina]]''.  

Reagrdless of size or form, two visible features set the Phaeophyceae apart from all other algae.  First, members of the group possess a characteristic color that ranges from an [[Chartreuse (color)#Olive drab|olive green]] to various shades of [[brown]].  The particular shade depends on the amount of [[fucoxanthin]] present in the alga.<ref name="Bold1987"/>  Second, all brown algae are [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]].  There are no known species that exist as single cells or as colonies of cells<ref name="Bold1987"/>, and the brown algae are the only major group of [[seaweed]]s that does not include such forms.  However, this may be the result of classification rather than evolutionary, as all the groups hypothesized to be the closest relatives of the browns include single-celled or colonial forms.

===Specialized structures===
[[File:Laminaria hyperborea.jpg|thumb|240px|Two specimens of ''[[Laminaria hyperborea]]'', each showing the rootlike '''holdfast''' at lower left, a divided '''blade''' at upper right, and a stemlike '''stipe''' connecting the blade to the holdfast.]]
{{Further|[[Thallus]]|[[Holdfast]]|[[Stipe (botany)]]|[[Lamina (algae)]]|[[Pneumatocyst]]}}

Whatever their form, the body of all brown algae is termed a ''[[thallus]]'', indicating that it lacks the complex [[xylem]] and [[phloem]] of [[vascular plant]]s.  This does not mean that brown algae completely lack specialized structures.  But, because some botanists define "true" stems, leaves, and roots by the presence of these tissues, their absence in the brown algae means that the stem-like and leaf-like structures found in some groups of brown algae must be described using different terminology.<ref name="Raven2005">{{cite book | last=Raven | first=P. H. | coauthors=Evert, R. F.; Eichhorn, S. E. | year=2005 | title=Biology of Plants | edition=7th | location=New York | publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company | pages 316-321, 347 | isbn=0716710072 }}</ref>  Although not all brown algae are structurally complex, those that are typically possess one or more characteristic parts.

A ''[[holdfast]]'' is a rootlike structure present at the base of the alga.  Like a root system in plants, a holdfast serves to anchor the alga in place on the ''substrate'' where it grows, and thus prevents the alga from being carried away by the current.  Unlike a root system, the holdfast generally does not serve as the primary organ for water uptake, nor does it take in nutrients from the substrate.  The overall physical appearance of the holdfast differs among various brown algae and among various substrates.  It may be heavily branched, or it may be cup-like in appearance.  A single alga typically has just one holdfast, although some species have more than one stipe growing from their holdfast.  

A ''[[stipe]]'' is a stalk or stemlike structure present in an alga.  It may grow as a short structure near the base of the alga (as in ''[[Laminaria]]''), or it may develop into a large, complex structure running throughout the algal body (as in ''[[Sargassum]]'' or ''[[Macrocystis]]'').  In the most structurally differentiated brown algae (such as ''[[Fucus]]''), the tissues within the stipe are divided into three distinct layers or regions.  These regions include a central pith, a surrounding cortex, and an outer epidermis, each of which has an analog in the stem of a vascular plant.  In some brown algae, the pith region includes a core of elongated cells that resemble the [[phloem]] of vascular plants both in structure and function.  In others (such as ''[[Nereocystis]]''), the center of the stipe is hollow and filled with gas that serves to keep that part of the alga buoyant.  The stipe may be relatively flexible and elastic in species like ''[[Macrocystis pyrifera]]'' that grow in strong currents, or may be more rigid in species like ''[[Postelsia palmaeformis]]'' that are exposed to the atmosphere at low tide.

Many algae have a flattened portion that may resemble a leaf, and this is termed a ''blade'', ''[[Lamina (algae)|lamina]]'', or ''frond''.  The name ''blade'' is most often applied to a single undivided structure, while ''frond'' may be applied to all or most of an algal body that is flattened, but this distinction is not universally applied.  The name ''lamina'' refers to that portion of a structurally differentiated alga that is flattened.  It may be a single or a divided structure, and may be spread over a substantial portion of the alga.  In [[Fucus|rockweeds]], for example, the lamina is a broad wing of tissue that runs continuously along both sides of a branched ''midrib''.  The midrib and lamina together constitute almost all of a rockweed, so that the lamina is spread throughout the alga rather than existing as a localized portion of it.

[[File:Bladder Wrack (Fucus vesiculosus) - geograph.org.uk - 224125.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Species like ''[[Fucus vesiculosus]]'' produce numerous gas-filled '''pneumatocysts''' (air bladders) to increase buoyancy.]]
In some brown algae, there is a single lamina or blade, while in others there may be many separate blades.  Even in those species that initially produce a single blade, the structure may tear with rough currents or as part of maturation to form additional blades.  These blades may be attached directly to the stipe, to a holdfast with no stipe present, or there may be an air bladder between the stipe and blade.  The surface of the lamina or blade may be smooth or wrinkled; its tissues may be thin and flexible or thick and leathery.  In species like ''[[Egregia menziesii]]'', this characteristic may change depending upon the turbulence of the waters in which it grows.<ref name="Connor1989" />  In other species, the surface of the blade is coated with slime to discourage the attachment of [[epiphyte]]s or to deter [[herbivore]]s.  Blades are also often the parts of the alga that bear the reproductive structures.

Gas-filled floats called ''[[pneumatocyst]]s'' provide [[buoyancy]] in many [[kelp]]s and members of the [[Fucales]].  These bladder-like structures occur in or near the ''lamina'', so that it is held nearer the water surface and thus receives more light for photosynthesis.  Pneumatocysts are most often spherical or [[ellipsoid]]al, but can vary in shape among different species.  Species such as ''[[Nereocystis|Nereocystis luetkeana]]'' and ''[[Pelagophycus|Pelagophycus porra]]'' bear a single large pneumatocyst between the top of the stipe and the base of the blades.  In contrast, the giant kelp ''Macrocystis pyrifera'' bears many blades along its stipe, with a pneumatocyst at the base of each blade where it attaches to the main stipe.  Species of ''[[Sargassum]]'' also bear many blades and pneumatocysts, but both kinds of structures are attached separately to the stipe by short stalks.  In species of ''[[Fucus]]'', the pneumatocysts develop within the lamina itself, either as discrete spherical bladders or as elongated gas-filled regions that take the outline of the lamina in which they develop.

==Evolutionary history==

Genetic and ultrastructural evidence place the Phaeophyceae among the [[heterokont]]s (Stramenopiles)<ref name="pmid16248873">{{cite journal |author=Adl SM, Simpson AG, Farmer MA, ''et al.'' |title=The new higher level classification of eukaryotes with emphasis on the taxonomy of protists |journal=J.

==Life cycle==
The life cycle shows great variability from one group  to another. However the life cycle of ''[[Laminaria]]'' consists of the [[diploid]] generation, that is the large kelp well known to most people, producing sporangia from specialised microscopic structures, which divide [[meiosis|meiotically]] before they are released. As they are [[haploid]] there are equal numbers of male and female spores.<ref name="Thomas2002" >{{cite book | last=Thomas | first=D.N. | year=2002 | title=Seaweeds | location=London | publisher=The Natural History Museum | isbn=0565091751 }}</ref> With the exception of the Fucales all brown algae have a life cycle which consists of an [[alternation of generations|alternation]] between haploid and diploid forms.

== Ecology ==
Brown algae have  adapted to a wide variety of marine ecological niches including the tidal splash zone, rock pools, the whole intertidal zone and relatively deep near shore waters. They are an important constituent of some brackish water ecosystems, and four species are restricted to life in fresh water.<ref name=Lee2008/> A large number of Phaeophyceae are intertidal or upper littoral,<ref name=Lee2008/> and they are predominantly cool and cold water organisms that benefit from  nutrients in up welling cold water currents and inflows from land; ''[[Sargassum]]'' being a prominent exception to this generalisation.

Brown algae growing in brackish waters are almost solely asexual.<ref name=Lee2008/>

They have Cellulose walls with alginic acid; fucoidin also important in amorphous section of cell walls. A few species (of ''Padina'') calcify with aragonite needles.<ref name=Lee2008/>

Brown algae produce a specific type of tannin, called [[phlorotannin]]s.
