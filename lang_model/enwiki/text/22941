'''Fucking Machines''' (also known as '''Fuckingmachines.com''' and '''fuckingmachines''') is a [[pornographic website]] founded in 2000 that features video and photographs of women engaged in [[autoerotic]] [[sexual stimulation]] with penetrative [[sex-machine]]s and [[sex toys]]. The site is based in [[San Francisco, California]], and is operated by [[Kink.com]]. Web entrepreneur [[Peter Acworth]] launched Fucking Machines on September 25, 2000, as his company's second website after Kink.com. Devices shown on the site were created with the intent to bring women authentic [[orgasm]]s. Performers were instructed to allow themselves to be recorded experiencing pleasure.

After the site applied in 2005 to trademark the phrase "fuckingmachines", the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) denied the application and ruled that the mark was [[obscene]]. [[Freedom of speech|Free speech]] lawyer [[Marc Randazza]] represented the site and appealed the decision. ''[[Orlando Weekly]]'' called his legal brief, "one of the most entertaining legal documents you're likely to come across."<ref name="billman" /> The appeal was denied in April 2008 and the case was terminated. Randazza's argument in the case became known as ''The Fuck Brief''.

The website has received analysis from journalists and academics studying sexuality. Writer [[Regina Lynn]] highlighted the site's emphasis on communication, and [[Annalee Newitz]] of ''[[AlterNet]]'' classed it as part of [[Porn 2.0]]. Violet Blue wrote in ''The Adventurous Couple's Guide to Sex Toys'' that it helped popularize the idea of machines aiding in sex acts. The 2008 edition of ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History'' described the aesthetic of the devices as disturbing. Jessica Roy wrote for ''[[The New York Observer]]'' that Fucking Machines' examples of orgasms were a form of [[transhumanism]]. Sarah Schaschek devoted a chapter to the phenomenon in ''Screening the Dark Side of Love: From Euro-Horror to American Cinema'', titled "Fucking Machines: High-Tech Bodies in Pornography". She observed, "Strictly speaking, the women in these videos are both the controllers and the controlled."<ref name="schaschek" />

===Trademark appeal===
Fucking Machines filed a request in July 2005 to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) to secure its [[intellectual property]] rights for the mark "fuckingmachines", having met the first standard that the word was not in use by any other entity.<ref name="billman" /><ref name="xenijardin">{{cite news|url=http://boingboing.net/2007/06/11/altporn-site-cant-tr.html|accessdate=May 8, 2013|work=[[Boing Boing]]|title=Alt-porn site can't trademark name, patent office says it's obscene|date=June 11, 2007|first=Xeni|last=Jardin|authorlink=Xeni Jardin}}</ref> The site became involved in a [[trademark]] dispute when the USPTO refused to grant a trademark for the name of the site, asserting that it was obscene.<ref name="billman">{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/features/story.asp?id=11596|title=Law & Jurisprudence: The F Bomb: A local lawyer teams up with a California porn king to fight for your right to trademark dirty   |first=Jeffrey C. |last=Billman|date=June 7, 2007|work=[[Orlando Weekly]]|accessdate=May 8, 2013}}</ref> The case for Fucking Machines' use of the mark was handled by [[free speech]] attorney [[Marc Randazza]].<ref name="billman" />

The decision of the U.S. government was determined by lawyer Michael Engel, who ruled: "Registration is refused because the proposed mark consists of or comprises immoral or scandalous matter.

In response to the USPTO decision in the case, Randazza stated, "The trademark office has gone off the deep end with 2(a) rejections."<ref name="billman" /><ref name="annewinter" /> Section 2(a), 15 USC <U+00A7>1052(a) disallows requests for marks that have "immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter".<ref name="billman" /><ref name="davidsullivan" />

Cybernet Entertainment, LLC, filed an "amendment and response to office action" of the USPTO decision in August 2006.<ref name="billman" /> Randazza introduced his brief with: "The Applicant respectfully challenges this characterization of the word 'fucking' and its allegedly 'offensive and vulgar' root: 'fuck'."<ref name="billman" /> ''[[Orlando Weekly]]'' commented on Randazza's brief in the case: "Randazza&nbsp;... is frequently involved in free-speech cases <U+2013> is fighting the federal government for your right to trademark any dirty word you please. And his filing in the case is one of the most entertaining legal documents you're likely to come across."<ref name="billman" /> Randazza's argument in the case came to be known as [[s:The Fuck Brief|''The Fuck Brief'']].<ref name="bitterlawyer">{{cite news|url=http://www.bitterlawyer.com/marc-randazza-his-profane-pornographic-anti-glenn-beck-world/|work=[[Bitter Lawyer]]|title=Marc Randazza: His Profane, Pornographic, Anti-Glenn Beck World|publisher=www.bitterlawyer.com|date=December 7, 2009|accessdate=November 14, 2013|author=Bitter Success}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sequenceinc.com/fraudfiles/2012/03/marc-randazza-first-amendment-lawyer/|title=Marc Randazza, First Amendment Lawyer|date=March 23, 2012|accessdate=November 14, 2013|first=Tracy|last=Coenen|work=The Fraud Files Blog|publisher=www.sequenceinc.com}}</ref>

Randazza argued: 
<blockquote>"[T]his much maligned four-letter word has no intrinsic meaning. Fuck [can] play a role as a figurative term, for example, 'to fuck' can also mean 'to deceive.' It is a word of force that can assist us in our expressions of joy when used as an infix, as in 'abso-fucking-lutely'. 'Fuck' helps us express rage when we scream 'fuck you' at a football referee, or at a motorist who has just cut us off in traffic. 'Fuck' can help us express pain, as it is quite frequently the first thing out of most men's mouths when they strike their thumb (accidentally) with a hammer. 'Fuck' is a vehicle for our disappointment, when we see that our report card is not as good as we had hoped, or when our significant other is late for dinner, or leaves us altogether. 'Fuck' is an old friend, who can always make us laugh."<ref name="billman" /><ref name="annewinter" /></blockquote>

Randazza explained to ''Orlando Weekly'' that he used the word "fuck" routinely throughout his brief as part of his argument that the term is used in a variety of ways.<ref name="billman" /><ref name="davidsullivan" /> He cited related terms, including "[[Fuck-me shoes|fuck-me boots]]", and frequent use of the word "fuck" in films including ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'', ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', and ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]''.<ref name="billman" />

The reply by Engel for the USPTO acknowledged the routine use of the word, and simultaneously asserted its scandalous nature: "Although the word is frequently used, it still is considered shocking in most formal or polite situations. For example, the word is bleeped out on basic cable, and broadcasters can be fined by the FCC for letting the word go out on the airwaves."<ref name="billman" /> He argued that the word was restricted in the workplace and by government regulations.<ref name="billman" />

Randazza filed an appeal on June 5, 2007, and the matter was scheduled for a hearing before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.<ref name="billman" /><ref name="davidsullivan" /> Acworth told ''Orlando Weekly'' he considered ceasing appeals when the mark had initially been rejected by the USPTO.<ref name="billman" /> He said he was not intending to be the adult industry's representative for First Amendment rights.<ref name="annewinter" /> Acworth stated to ''Orlando Weekly'', "Marc talked me into it. I'm not normally this sort of person. Marc thought he had a pretty good shot at it. I'm really going on his advice.&nbsp;... I have no real agenda with it."<ref name="billman" />

Adult entertainment attorney Robert Apgood stated he agreed with the actions of Acworth and Randazza.<ref name="annewinter" /> Apgood pointed out he had observed a significant increase in applications to the USPTO that were rejected because their potential trademarks were deemed "scandalous" by the government.<ref name="annewinter" /> He stated, "It's really quite unfortunate that the executive branch is now reaching deep into the machinations of government to further its 'legislation of morality' agenda. It is truly encouraging to see the likes of Acworth and Randazza take up this sorely needed fight."<ref name="annewinter" /> The appeal was denied in April 2008 and the case was terminated.<ref name="usptosummary">{{cite news|url=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?qt=adv&procstatus=All&pno=&propno=&qs=&propnameop=&propname=fuckingmachines&pop=&pn=&pop2=&pn2=&cop=&cn=|publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|work=Exparte Appeal|title=Mark: FUCKINGMACHINES|date=April 15, 2008}}</ref> The application status was last listed as "abandoned" for failure to respond by the appealing party.<ref name="usptosummary" />

In a 2012 article for ''[[The New York Observer]]'', journalist Jessica Roy characterized Fucking Machines' examples of orgasms as a form of [[transhumanism]].<ref name="jessicaroy">{{cite news|first=Jessica|last=Roy|work=[[The New York Observer]]|title=Regular Orgasms Are for Mortals; All the Cool Kids Are Having 'Longevity Orgasms'|date=November 8, 2012|url=http://betabeat.com/2012/11/regular-orgasms-are-for-mortals-all-the-cool-kids-are-having-longevity-orgasms/|accessdate=May 8, 2013}}</ref>{{efn|[[Transhumanism]] refers to a movement supporting use of technology to enhance human abilities.<ref>{{cite book|pages=1<U+2013>4|title=Transhumanism and Society: The Social Debate over Human Enhancement|first=Stephen |last=Lilley|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-9400749801}}</ref>}} In the book ''Screening the Dark Side of Love: From Euro-Horror to American Cinema'' (2012), Sarah Schaschek devoted a chapter to the phenomenon, titled "Fucking Machines: High-Tech Bodies in Pornography".<ref name="schaschek">{{cite book|first=Sarah|last=Schaschek|editor1-first=Karen A.|editor1-last= Ritzenhoff|editor2-first= Karen|editor2-last= Randell|title=Screening the Dark Side of Love: From Euro-Horror to American Cinema|chapter=Chapter 15: Fucking Machines: High-Tech Bodies in Pornography|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2012|isbn=978-0-230-34154-8|pages=211<U+2013>225}}</ref> Schaschek concluded, "While antipornography feminists usually criticize that female performers are visually and practically degraded by men in heterosexual pornography, it is hard to uphold such an impression in the FuckingMachines videos. Given that all pornography eroticizes difference, and given that sexual fantasies usually require clearly drawn roles of dominance and submission, the women of FuckingMachines seem to resist at least a few of these categories.&nbsp;... Strictly speaking, the women in these videos are both the controllers and the controlled."<ref name="schaschek" />
