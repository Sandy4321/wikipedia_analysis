<!--Definition and classification-->
'''Traumatic brain injury''' (TBI, also called  '''intracranial injury''') occurs when [[physical trauma]] injures the [[brain]].  TBI is one of two subsets of [[acquired brain injury]] ([[brain damage]] that is not [[congenital]]); the other subset is ''non-traumatic brain injury'', which does not involve external mechanical force (e.g. [[stroke]], [[meningitis]] and [[Hypoxia (medical)|insufficient oxygen]]). TBI can be classified by severity (mild, moderate, or severe), mechanism of injury  (closed or [[penetrating head injury]]) and other features of the injury (e.g. focal, occurring in a specific location, or diffuse, occurring over a more widespread area).  ''[[Head injury]]'' usually refers to TBI, but is a broader category because it can involve damage to structures other than the brain, such as the scalp and skull.  

TBI is a [[list of causes of death by rate|major cause of death and disability worldwide]], especially in young people. Major causes of TBI include falls, vehicle accidents, and violence. Prevention includes using [[seat belt]]s and helmets when riding bicycles or motorcycles and during some sports.  

In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, brain trauma causes ''secondary injury'', a variety of events that take place in the brain in the minutes and days following the injury. Secondary injury processes, which include alterations in [[cerebral blood flow]] and the [[intracranial pressure|pressure within the skull]], contribute substantially to the damage from the initial injury.  This presents the opportunity to discover new treatments that limit damage by interfering with these cascades.  

Imaging techniques such as [[computed tomography]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] are used for confirmation of brain injury. In mild cases, TBI may require little treatment or, in severe cases, medications and emergency surgery may be required to lower the pressure within the skull. [[Physical therapy]], [[speech therapy]], and [[occupational therapy]] may be employed for rehabilitation.  TBI can cause a host of physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral effects; these complications are more likely in more severe injuries.  Outcome can range from complete recovery to permanent [[disability]] or death.

==Classification==
Traumatic brain injury is defined as damage to the brain resulting from external mechanical force, such as rapid acceleration or deceleration, impact, [[blast injury|blast]] waves, or penetration by a projectile.<ref name="Maas08"/>  Impairment of brain function without physical damage may also be included in the definition of TBI, and trauma that takes place during birth is excluded from the definition.<ref name="ComperBisschop">{{cite journal |author=Comper P, Bisschop SM, Carnide N, ''et al.'' <!--Comper P, Bisschop SM, Carnide N, Tricco A--> |title=A systematic review of treatments for mild traumatic brain injury |journal=Brain Injury |volume=19 |issue=11 |pages=863<U+2013>880 |year=2005 |pmid=16296570 |doi=10.1080-0269050400025042 |issn=0269-9052}}</ref> All traumatic brain injuries are head injuries, but the latter term may also refer to injury to other parts of the head.<ref name="Blissitt06">{{ cite journal |author=Blissitt PA |title=Care of the critically ill patient with penetrating head injury |journal=Crit Care Nurs Clin North Am |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=321<U+2013>32 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16962454 |doi=10.1016/j.ccell.2006.05.006 }}</ref><ref name="Howieson04"/><!--p.158-->  However, the terms ''head injury'' and ''brain injury'' may be used synonymously.<ref name="Howieson04"/><!--p.158--> Similarly, all brain injuries are types of [[central nervous system]] (CNS) injuries.  

TBI is classified based on severity, location, [[mechanism of injury]], and other injury characteristics.  Mechanism-related classification divides TBI into closed and [[penetrating head injury]].<ref name="Maas08"/> A closed (also called nonpenetrating, or blunt)<ref name="Blissitt06"/> injury occurs when the brain is not exposed.<ref name="Howieson04"/><!--p.158--> A penetrating, or open head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the [[dura mater]], the heavy, outermost [[meninges|membrane surrounding the brain]].<ref name="Howieson04"/><!--p.158-->  Bone fragments may cause penetrating injuries when the [[skull fracture|skull is fractured]].<ref name="Blissitt06"/>  A depressed skull fracture occurs when pieces of the broken skull press into the tissue of the brain.

Head injuries can be subdivided into mild, moderate, and severe. The [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] is a universal system for classifying TBI severity.<ref name="Maas08"/>  It is generally agreed that a TBI with Glasgow Coma Score of 13 or above is mild, 9<U+2013>12 is moderate, and 8 or below is severe.<!--i.e. using gcs alone is more common than with pta and loc--><ref name="Valadka04"/> One common classification system determines severity based on the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) after resuscitation as well as the duration of [[post-traumatic amnesia]] (PTA) and [[loss of consciousness]] (LOC) according to the table at right.<ref name="RaoLyketsos"/> In a similar system, the criteria are the same as listed in the table, except that trauma is only severe if unconsciousness and post-traumatic amnesia last for over a week.<ref name="Arlinghaus05">

CONTUSION
--> One type of focal injury is [[cerebral contusion]] (bruising of brain tissue),<ref name="Hardman02"/> where blood is mixed among brain tissue.<ref name="Valadka04"/>

<!--
HEMORRHAGE
-->Another type of focal injury, [[intracranial hemorrhage]], involves bleeding in the skull that is not mixed with tissue.<ref name="Hardman02"/>  Hemorrhage, due to rupture of a [[blood vessel]] in the head, can be extra-axial, (occurring within the skull but outside of the brain) or intra-axial (occurring within the brain tissue).  Intra-axial bleeds are further divided into intraparenchymal hemorrhage, also called [[intracerebral hemorrhage]], which occurs within the brain tissue itself, and [[intraventricular hemorrhage]], in which bleeding occurs in the [[ventricular system]].  Extra-axial hemorrhages are divided into [[subdural hematoma]], [[epidural hematoma]], and [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]].  Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the [[dura mater]]. In subdural hematoma, the most common traumatic mass lesion, bleeding occurs between the dura and the [[arachnoid mater]].<ref name="Valadka04"/> Subarachnoid hemorrhage, which involves bleeding into the space between the arachnoid membrane and the [[pia mater]], is common after head trauma.<ref name="Valadka04"/> Subarachnoid hemorrhage does not cause a [[Mass effect (medicine)|mass effect]] because the blood is able to spread out; however it can cause blood vessels to spasm and potentially constrict enough to deny the brain sufficient blood flow.<ref name="Valadka04"/>

[[Image:Anizokoria.JPG|left|thumb|Unequal pupil size is a sign of a serious brain injury.<ref name="Ghajar00"/>]]
A person with a moderate or severe TBI may show symptoms found in mild TBI, but may also have a headache that gets worse or does not go away, repeated vomiting or nausea, convulsions or seizures, an inability to awaken from sleep, [[pupil dilation|dilation]] of one or both pupils of the eyes, slurred speech, weakness or numbness in the limbs, loss of coordination, and increased confusion, restlessness, or agitation.<ref name="nindsinfo"/>

When the pressure within the skull ([[intracranial pressure]], abbreviated ICP) rises too high, it can be deadly.<ref name="Salomone04"/>  Signs of increased ICP include decreasing [[level of consciousness]], paralysis or weakness on one side of the body, [[Cushing's triad|Cushing's phenomena]] (slow heart rate with increasing systolic blood pressure), and a [[blown pupil]], one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so.<ref name="Salomone04"/> Pupils that are unequal in size ([[anisocoria]]) is another sign of serious TBI.<ref name="Ghajar00"/> [[Abnormal posturing]], a characteristic positioning of the limbs in response to pain by an unconscious person, is an ominous sign of severe brain injury.

Small children with moderate to severe TBI may have some of these symptoms but may have difficulty communicating about them.<ref name="cdcsymptoms">{{cite web| url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/tbi/Signs_and_Symptoms.htm|title=Signs and Symptoms  |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control |date=2007-07-07 |accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref>  Other signs seen in young children include persistent crying, inability to be consoled, listlessness, and refusal to nurse or eat.<ref name="cdcsymptoms"/>

</ref>  Tensile stress, stretching caused by forces pulling in opposite directions along an axis of a structure, may also contribute to TBI; for example blood vessels that bridge between the brain and surrounding structures may be damaged when they are pulled as the brain accelerates at a different rate from the skull.<ref name="Hunt04"/> Shear stress, opposing forces pushing in opposite directions perpendicular to the axis of a structure, can cause injuries such as [[contusion]]s or [[laceration]]s of the [[brain stem]].<ref name="Hunt04"/> Even in the absence of an impact, significant acceleration or deceleration of the head can cause TBI; however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame.<ref name="Hardman02"/> When the head is struck by or strikes something, or is rapidly accelerated or decelerated, the force from the impact sends [[shock wave]]s through the skull and brain, resulting in tissue damage.<ref name="Hardman02"/>  Shock waves can also destroy a great deal of tissue along the path of a rapidly moving projectile in [[Penetrating injury|penetrating injuries]] through a [[cavitation]] injury mechanism.<ref name="Valadka04"/>  [[Pressure wave]]s propagate through the tissue, forcing it out of the way and creating a temporary cavity; the tissue quickly moves back into place, but it is damaged. 

Damage may occur in the part of the brain directly under the site of impact, or it may occur on the side opposite the impact ([[coup contrecoup injury|coup and contrecoup injury]], respectively).<ref name="Shaw02"/> The mechanism, especially for contrecoup injuries, is a subject of much debate; potential mechanisms include the effects of inertia on the brain within the skull, movement of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] that surrounds the brain,<ref name="Shaw02">

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of TBI is made based on the [[medical history]] and presence of symptoms such as loss of consciousness and amnesia, and using techniques like [[neuroimaging]].<ref name="Maas08"/>  In addition, medical personnel perform a [[neurological examination]], for example checking whether the pupils constrict normally in response to light and using the Glasgow Coma Scale.<ref name="Valadka04"/>  

[[Image:Epidural hematoma.png|left|thumb|CT scan showing epidural hematoma in the upper left]]
Imaging tests help in determining the diagnosis and prognosis and in deciding what treatments to give.<ref name="Zink01"/>  The gold standard radiologic imaging test for TBI is a [[computed tomography]] (CT) scan, which creates a series of cross-sectional X-ray images of the head.<ref name="Valadka04"/> CT [[angiography]] may be used to detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved.<ref name="Maas08"/> Followup CT scans may be performed to determine whether the injury has progressed.<ref name="Maas08"/>  Patients with mild to moderate injuries may receive skull [[X-ray]]s to check for [[bone fracture|fracture]]s, but due to the greater sensitivity of CT these are less commonly used nowadays.<ref name="Maas08"/>  [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), which can show more detail than X-rays or CT, can add information about expected outcome in the long-term treatment of TBI.<ref name="Valadka04"/> However, MRI is not used in the emergency setting; reasons for this include the relative inefficacy in detecting bleeds and bone fractures on MRI, the length of time it takes to obtain images, the inaccessibility of the patient in the magnet, and the metal items used in emergency care that cannot be around the strong magnet.<ref name="Valadka04"/> MRI is more useful than CT for detecting characteristics of diffuse axonal injury in the subacute and chronic time frames.<ref name="Maas08"/> 

CT and MRI are standard in TBI diagnosis, but other imaging and diagnostic techniques that may be used to confirm a particular diagnosis include [[cerebral angiography]], [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[transcranial Doppler ultrasound]], and [[single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT). [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) can show the neurocognitive or neurophysiologic effects of TBI.  PET can show changes in [[cerebral blood flow]] and the amount of glucose used by the brain.<ref name="Zink01"/>

[[Neuropsychological test]]s and [[neuropsychological assessment]] can be performed to demonstrate the cognitive effects of the injury and to aid in recovery and rehabilitation.  Tests used to determine neurological outcome include those that measure memory and amnesia, learning, motor abilities, language, attention, and ability to form concepts.<ref name="Zink01"/>

===Intracranial pressure===
Medical personnel measure [[intracranial pressure]] by placing a [[catheter]] into a [[ventricular system|ventricle of the brain]].<ref name="Ghajar00"/> Treatment of high ICP may be as simple as straightening the head to allow blood to exit the head through the jugular vein or raising the head of the bed slightly, or it may require [[ventriculostomy]], a procedure that drains [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) from the ventricles to bring the pressure down.<ref name="Valadka04"/> Other measures to decrease dangerously high ICP include use of [[sedative]], [[paralytic agent]]s, [[osmotherapy]] (creation of a [[diffusion|chemical gradient]] to maintain therapeutic [[concentration]]s of chemicals in tissues), and mild hyperventilation.<ref name="Salomone04"/> [[Hyperventilation]], ventilating the patient more than normal, causes blood vessels to constrict in response to the lowered carbon dioxide levels, decreasing blood flow to the brain.<ref name="Ghajar00"/>  Hyperventilation thus reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia, and it worsens outcome if used for a long time.<ref name="Ghajar00"/> Thus it is not indicated as a protective measure against high ICP.<ref name="Salomone04"/>  

[[Hyperosmolar]] agents create an osmolar gradient, to normalize ICP; for example [[hypertonic]] saline improves ICP.<ref name="Maas08"/> However, osmotherapy has the potential to cause [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] such as [[electrolyte]] imbalances and [[heart failure]].<ref name="Maas08"/>  [[Mannitol]], an [[osmosis|osmotic]] [[diuretic]], moves water across the blood<U+2013>brain barrier and improves [[cerebral blood flow]] to the injured area.<ref name="Maas08"/>  However it appears likely that studies suggesting that mannitol was of use<ref>Cruz J, Minoja G, Okuchi K.

[[Barbiturate]]s can also be used to decrease ICP. [[Diuretic]]s, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures (those above 25&nbsp;mm Hg), but carry the potential side effect of causing [[hypovolemia]], insufficient blood volume.<ref name="Ghajar00"/>

===Surgery===

[[Mass lesion]]s such as contusions or subdural, epidural, or intracerebral hematomas may need to be surgically removed.<ref name="Ghajar00"/>  Contusions or hematomas that are causing a significant mass effect (shift of intracranial structures by more than 5&nbsp;mm) are medical emergencies and need to be treated surgically.<ref name="Valadka04"/>  [[Craniotomy]] (removal of part of the skull) is required in about a third of severe TBIs.<ref name="Ghajar00"/>  Hemorrhaging vessels are located and the bleeding is controlled.<ref name="Valadka04"/> For intracranial hematomas, the collected blood may be removed using suction or special forceps or it may be floated off by irrigating with water.<ref name="Valadka04"/> In penetrating brain injury, damaged tissue is surgically [[debridement|debrided]] and the [[dura mater]] [[suturing|sutured]] shut.  [[Decompressive craniectomy]] (DC) is a last-resort surgical procedure in which part of the skull is removed in an attempt to reduce severely high ICP.<ref name="Aarabi">{{cite journal |author=Aarabi B, Hesdorffer DC, Ahn ES, Aresco C, Scalea TM, Eisenberg HM |title=Outcome following decompressive craniectomy for malignant swelling due to severe head injury |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery |volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=469<U+2013>79 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16619648 |doi=10.3171/jns.2006.104.4.469 |url=}}</ref>  A controversial procedure under ongoing study, it has not been shown to improve outcome in all trials and may be associated with severe side effects.<ref name="Maas08"/>  On the other hand, DC performed in the very short period following TBI is practiced routinely during operations to treat hematomas, and is relatively uncontroversial.<ref name="Bhardwaj08">{{cite book|title=Acute Brain and Spinal Cord Injury: Evolving Paradigms and Management |editor= Bhardwaj A, Ellegala DB, Kirsch JR| publisher=Informa Health Care |year = 2008 |isbn= 1420047949 |pages= 1<U+2013>2|author=Dunn IF, Ellegala DB |chapter=Decompressive hemicraniectomy in the management of severe traumatic brain injury }} </ref> In this procedure, termed "primary DC", part of the skull is removed during surgery to treat a hematoma, and the scalp is then closed with the bone flap temporarily not replaced.<ref name="Bhardwaj08"/> When the procedure is performed hours or days after TBI in order to control high intracranial pressures, it is termed secondary DC.<ref name="Bhardwaj08"/> The procedure has not been studied thoroughly and little evidence exists to recommend for or against secondary DC performed within six to eight hours of injury.<ref name="Bhardwaj08"/> 

===Rehabilitation===
During the acute stage of rehabilitation, moderately to severely injured people may receive treatment in an [[intensive care unit]] of a hospital followed by movement to a step-down unit or a [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] ward.<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>  Once medically stable, they may be transferred to a [[subacute]] nursing unit of the medical center or to an independent [[rehabilitation hospital]].<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>   
Decisions regarding when and where an individual should be treated depend on factors including the level to which the person can participate in rehabilitation.  Moderately to severely injured patients may receive [[physical therapy]], [[occupational therapy]], [[Speech and language pathology|speech and language therapy]], [[physiatry]] ([[physical medicine and rehabilitation]]), [[psychology]], [[psychiatry]], and [[social work]].<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>  The goal of rehabilitation is to improve the patient's ability to function independently at home and in society.<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>  Therapists help patients adapt to disabilities or change their living conditions to accommodate impairments.<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>  After discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation treatment unit, the care may be given on an [[Outpatient#Outpatient vs Inpatient|outpatient]] basis. [[Respite care]], including day centers and leisure facilities for the disabled, offers time off for caregivers and activities for people with TBI.<ref name="Wood00">{{cite book |author=McMillan TM, Oddy M |editor= Wood RL, McMillan TM |chapter= Service provision for social disability and handicap after acquired brain injury |title=Neurobehavioural Disability and Social Handicap Following Traumatic Brain Injury |publisher=Psychology Press |location=East Sussex |year=2000 |pages=267&ndash;68 |isbn=0-86377-889-5 }}</ref>  People with TBI who cannot live independently or with family may be cared for in supported living facilities such as group homes.<ref name="Wood00"/>  People who cannot return to regular employment may be given vocational rehabilitation; this supportive employment matches job demands to the worker's abilities and can allow people to return to work even when they had previously tried and failed to do so.<ref name="Wood00"/>

Patients may need medication for psychiatric and physical problems resulting from the TBI.<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>  Those who show psychiatric or behavioral problems may be helped with medication and psychotherapy, but the effectiveness of psychotherapy may be limited by the residual neurocognitive impairment.

==Prognosis==

Prognosis worsens with the severity of injury, but mild TBI is more poorly defined and prognosis is not as clear with it.<ref name="RaoLyketsos"/>  Most TBIs (by some estimates, almost 90%) are mild and do not cause permanent or long-term disability; however, all severity levels of TBI have the potential to cause significant, long-lasting disability.<ref name="Brown08">{{ cite journal |author=Brown AW, Elovic EP, Kothari S, Flanagan SR, Kwasnica C |title=Congenital and acquired brain injury. 1.

</ref>  Permanent disability is thought to occur in 10% of mild injuries, 66% of moderate injuries, and 100% of severe injuries.<ref name="Frey03"/>   Most mild TBI is completely resolved within three&nbsp;weeks, and almost all people with mild TBI are able to live independently and return to the jobs they had before the injury, although a portion have mild cognitive and social impairments.<ref name="Crooks07"/> [[Post-concussion syndrome]], a set of lasting symptoms experienced after mild and other forms of TBI, can include physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral problems such as headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and depression.  A young person who receives a second concussion before symptoms from another one have healed may be at risk for developing a very rare but deadly condition called [[second-impact syndrome]], in which the brain swells catastrophically after even a mild blow.  Over 90% of people with moderate TBI are able to live independently, although a portion require assistance in areas such as physical abilities, employment, and financial managing.<ref name="Crooks07"/>  Most people with severe closed head injury either die or recover enough to live independently; middle ground is less common.<ref name="Maas08"/> 

Factors thought to worsen the prognosis include [[substance abuse|abuse of substances]] including [[illicit drug]]s and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and age over sixty or under two years (in children, younger age at time of injury may be associated with a slower recovery of some abilities).<ref name="Zink01"/>  [[Glasgow Coma Score]] at the time of resuscitation after the injury is an important factor in eventual outcome: the lower the score, the worse the outcome, and when the score is 3 (the lowest score), the prognosis is usually dismal.<ref name="Zink01"/> The most important predictor of the three categories is the motor score, but low score in any of the categories is significantly correlated with poor outcome.<ref name="Zink01"/> People with TBI who have GCS higher than nine, no lesions visible on CT scan, and no evidence of alcohol intoxication, low blood oxygen, or [[shock (medicine)|shock]] are tentatively expected to have a good outcome.<ref name="Zink01"/>  [[Hypotension]] (low blood pressure) and [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (low [[blood oxygen saturation]]) are strongly correlated with poor outcome.<ref name="Maas08"/>  Lower [[cerebral perfusion pressure]]s and longer times spent with high intracranial pressures (above 20&nbsp;mm Hg) are also associated with worse outcomes.<ref name="Zink01"/> Scores greater than 40 on the [[Injury Severity Scale]], abnormal pupil response to light and excessive [[mydriasis|pupil dilation]] are also significantly correlated with a worse outcome.<ref name="Zink01"/>  Subdural hematoma is associated with worse neurological outcome and increased mortality, while people with epidural hematoma are expected to make a good outcome if they receive surgery quickly.<ref name="Zink01"/>  

About 85% of recovery takes place within six&nbsp;months of injury.<ref name="Maas08"/>

==Complications==

Health complications are distinct medical problems that may arise as a result of the TBI. The risk of complications increases with the severity of the trauma;<ref name="TBI:HTR"/> however even mild traumatic brain injury can result in disabilities that interfere with social interactions, employment, and everyday living.<ref name="Kushner98"/>  The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; it can cause a variety of problems including physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. 

===Effects on consciousness===
Generally, there are six abnormal [[level of consciousness|states of consciousness]] that can result from a TBI: 
*'''[[Stupor]]''' is a state of partial or near complete unconsciousness in which the patient is lethargic, immobile, and has a reduced response to stimuli.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000101649|Stupor}}.</ref>
*'''[[Coma]]''' is a state in which the patient is totally unconscious and cannot be aroused even with strong stimuli.<ref name="DorlandsComa">{{DorlandsDict|two/000023055|Coma}}.</ref> 
*'''[[Persistent vegetative state]]''' is a condition in which awake patients are unconscious and unaware of their surroundings and the cerebral cortex is not functioning.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000100437|Persistent vegetative state}}.</ref>  A vegetative state can result from diffuse injury to the cerebral hemispheres of the brain without damage to the lower brain and brainstem.
*A '''[[minimally conscious state]]''' is a condition in which patients have a reduced level of arousal and may appear, on the surface, to be in a persistent vegetative state but are capable of demonstrating the ability to actively process information.  
*'''[[Locked-in syndrome]]''' is a condition in which a patient is aware and awake, but cannot move or communicate due to complete paralysis of the body.<ref name="DorlandsLocked">{{DorlandsDict|nine/000954380|Locked-in syndrome}}.</ref>  Voluntary control of eye movements or blinking may be spared, permitting the detection of conscious awareness and enabling the establishment of functional communication.<ref name="DorlandsLocked"/>

===Cognitive deficits===
Cognitive deficits that can follow TBI include impaired attention; disrupted insight, judgement, and thought; reduced processing speed; distractibility; and deficits in executive functions such as abstract reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking.<ref name="Arlinghaus05"/>  Most patients with severe TBI who recover consciousness suffer from [[cognitive disabilities]], including the loss of many higher-level mental skills. [[Memory loss]], the most common cognitive impairment among head-injured patients, occurs in 20<U+2013>79% of people with closed head trauma, depending on severity.<ref name="Hall05">

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, [[neurodegenerative disease]] characterized by [[dementia]], memory loss, and deteriorating cognitive abilities. Research suggests an association between head injury in early adulthood and the development of AD later in life; the more severe the head injury, the greater the risk of developing AD.<ref name="TBI:HTR"/> Some evidence indicates that a head injury may interact with other factors to trigger the disease and may hasten the onset of the disease in individuals already at risk. For example, head-injured people who have a particular form of the protein [[apolipoprotein E]] (apoE4, a naturally occurring protein that helps transport cholesterol through the bloodstream) fall into this increased risk category.<ref name="TBI:HTR"/> 

Patients with moderate to severe TBI have more problems with cognitive deficits than do those with mild TBI, but a history of several mild TBIs may have an additive effect. About one in five carreer boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI), which causes cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments.<ref name="Jordan00">

===Communication problems===
Language and communication problems are common disabilities in TBI patients. Some may experience [[aphasia]], difficulty with understanding and producing spoken and written language; or they may have difficulty with the more subtle aspects of communication, such as body language and emotional, non-verbal signals. Some may have problems with intonation or inflection, called [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] dysfunction. Problems with spoken language may occur if the part of the brain that controls speech muscles is damaged. In this disorder, called [[dysarthria]], the patient can think of the appropriate language, but cannot easily speak the words because they are unable to use the muscles needed to form the words and produce the sounds. Speech is often slow, slurred, and garbled.<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>   

===Sensory deficits===
TBI patients may have sensory problems, especially problems with [[Visual perception|vision]]; they may not be able to register what they are seeing or may be slow to recognize objects. Also, TBI patients often have difficulty with hand-eye coordination, causing them to seem clumsy or unsteady. Other sensory deficits include problems with [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[Olfaction|smell]], [[taste]], or [[somatosensory system|touch]]. [[Tinnitus]], a ringing or roaring in the ears, may occur. A person with damage to the part of the brain that processes taste or smell may perceive a persistent bitter taste or noxious smell. Damage to the part of the brain that controls the sense of touch may cause a TBI patient to develop persistent skin tingling, itching, or pain. These conditions are rare and difficult to treat.<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>  

===Emotional and behavioral problems===
TBI may cause emotional or behavioral problems and changes in personality.<ref name="Zink01"/>  Emotional symptoms that can follow TBI include emotional instability, [[depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, [[hypomania]], [[mania]], apathy, irritability, and anger.<ref name="Arlinghaus05"/>  TBI appears to predispose a person to psychiatric disorders including [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], alcohol or [[substance abuse]] or [[substance dependence]], [[dysthymia]], [[clinical depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[phobias]], [[panic disorder]], and [[schizophrenia]].<ref name="Arlinghaus051"/> About one quarter of people with TBI suffer from clinical depression, and about 9% suffer [[mania]].<ref name="RaoLyketsos"/> The prevalence of all psychiatric illnesses is 49% in moderate to severe TBI and 34% in mild TBI within a year of injury, compared with 18% of [[control group|controls]].<ref name="Jorge05">

Behavioral symptoms that can follow TBI include disinhibition, inability to control anger, impulsiveness, lack of initiative, inappropriate sexual activity, and changes in personality.<ref name="Arlinghaus05"/>  Different behavioral problems are characteristic of the location of injury; for instance, [[frontal lobe]] injuries often result in disinhibition and inappropriate or childish behavior, and [[temporal lobe]] injuries often cause irritability and [[aggression]].<ref name="Folzer01">

[[Parkinson's disease]] and other motor problems as a result of TBI are rare but can occur. Parkinson's disease, a chronic and progressive disorder, may develop years after TBI as a result of damage to the [[basal ganglia]]. Other movement disorders that may develop after TBI include tremor, [[ataxia]] (uncoordinated muscle movements), and [[myoclonus]] (shock-like contractions of muscles).<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>

[[Skull fracture]]s can tear the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain, leading to leaks of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  A tear between the dura and the arachnoid membranes, called a CSF [[fistula]], can cause CSF to leak out of the [[subarachnoid space]] into the [[subdural space]]; this is called a [[subdural hygroma]].<!--<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>--> CSF can also leak from the nose and the ear. These tears can also allow bacteria into the cavity, potentially causing infections such as [[meningitis]].<!--<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>--> [[Pneumocephalus]] occurs when air enters the [[intracranial cavity]] and becomes trapped in the subarachnoid space.<!--<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>--> Infections within the intracranial cavity are a dangerous complication of TBI. They may occur outside of the dura mater, below the dura, below the arachnoid (meningitis), or within the brain itself ([[abscess]]).<!--<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>--> Most of these injuries develop within a few weeks of the initial trauma and result from skull fractures or penetrating injuries.<!--<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>--> Standard treatment involves [[antibiotics]] and sometimes surgery to remove the infected tissue.<ref name="TBI:HTR"/> 

[[Hydrocephalus]], post-traumatic [[brain ventricle|ventricular]] enlargement, occurs when CSF accumulates in the brain, resulting in dilation of the cerebral ventricles and an increase in ICP. This condition can develop during the acute stage of TBI or may not appear until later. Generally it occurs within the first year of the injury and is characterized by worsening neurological outcome, impaired consciousness, behavioral changes, ataxia (lack of coordination or balance), [[incontinence]], or signs of elevated ICP.<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>

Any damage to the head or brain usually results in some damage to the [[vascular system]], which provides blood to the cells of the brain. The body can repair small blood vessels, but damage to larger ones can result in serious complications. Damage to one of the major arteries leading to the brain can cause a [[stroke]], either through bleeding from the artery or through the formation of a blood clot at the site of injury, blocking blood flow to the brain. Blood clots also can develop in other parts of the head. Other types of vascular complications include [[vasospasm]], in which blood vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, and the formation of [[aneurysm]]s, in which the side of a blood vessel weakens and balloons out.<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>

Fluid and hormonal imbalances can also complicate treatment. Hormonal problems can result from dysfunction of the [[pituitary]], the [[thyroid]], and other glands throughout the body. Two common hormonal complications of TBI are [[syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone]] and [[hypothyroidism]].<ref name="TBI:HTR"/>
