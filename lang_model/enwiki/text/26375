<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. DO NOT REMOVE THIS NOTICE -->
As [[Lord Voldemort]] retrieves the [[Elder Wand]] from [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s grave, [[Severus Snape]] has become [[Hogwarts]] headmaster. After burying [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|Dobby]], [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] asks the help of goblin [[Griphook]], [[Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] to break into [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]'s vault at [[Gringotts]] bank, suspecting a [[Horcrux]] may be there. Griphook agrees, in exchange for the [[Sword of Gryffindor]]. Harry asks wandmaker [[Ollivander]] to identify two wands taken from [[Malfoy Manor]]. Ollivander says they belonged to Bellatrix and to [[Draco Malfoy]], but Malfoy's has changed its allegiance to Harry.<!-- The elder wand was disclosed as being taken in the Part 1 plot summary -->

In Bellatrix's vault, Harry discovers the Horcrux is [[Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup. He retrieves it, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons the trio, leaving them cornered by the alerted security. The three release the dragon guardian and flee on its back. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort killing goblins, including Griphook, and learns Voldemort is aware of the theft. Harry also realises that there is a Horcrux at [[Hogwarts]] somehow connected to [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]. The trio [[apparate]] into [[Hogsmeade]], and set off Caterwauling alarms. They are rescued by [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], who instructs the [[Portrait (Harry Potter)|portrait]] of his younger sister, [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], to fetch [[Neville Longbottom]], who leads the trio through a secret passageway into Hogwarts.

Snape hears of Harry's return and warns staff and students of the severe punishment for aiding Harry. Harry confronts Snape, who flees after [[Minerva McGonagall]] challenges him to a duel. McGonagall gathers the community of Hogwarts to prepare for battle. At [[Luna Lovegood]]'s insistence, Harry speaks to [[Helena Ravenclaw]]'s ghost, who reveals that Voldemort performed "dark magic" on her mother's diadem, which is in the [[Room of Requirement]]. Ron and Hermione go to the [[Chamber of Secrets]], where Hermione destroys the Horcrux cup with a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|Basilisk]] fang. In the Room of Requirement, Draco, [[Gregory Goyle]] and [[Blaise Zabini]] attack Harry, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts a [[Fiendfyre]] curse and is unable to control it, and is burned to death while Harry and his friends save Malfoy and Zabini. Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement, where it is destroyed. As Voldemort's forces attack the school, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] is the final Horcrux. After entering the boathouse, the trio witness Voldemort telling Snape that  the Elder Wand cannot serve him until Snape dies; he then orders Nagini to kill Snape. Before dying, Snape tells Harry to take his memories to the [[Pensieve]]. In the chaos at Hogwarts, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], [[Remus Lupin|Lupin]], and [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] are killed.

Harry learns from Snape's memories that Snape loved Harry's mother, [[Lily Potter|Lily]], but despised his father, [[James Potter|James]], who had bullied him. Following her death, Snape worked secretly with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort because of his love for Lily. Harry also learns that Dumbledore's death at Snape's hands was planned between them. Harry discovers that he became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry goes to die at the hands of Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in [[limbo]], where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's own curse. Harry decides to return to his body to defeat Voldemort once and for all.

Voldemort announces Harry's apparent death to everyone at Hogwarts, and says that anyone who defies him will be killed. As Neville gives a defiant response, Harry reveals he is alive. Neville draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the [[Sorting Hat]], and as Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, Neville decapitates Nagini, leaving Voldemort mortal. [[Molly Weasley]] kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall. The final stand of Harry and Voldemort's fight is Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and obliterating him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand had recognised him as its master because he had disarmed Draco who earlier had disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore. Harry snaps the Elder Wand, rejecting its power.

Nineteen years later, Harry and Ginny Potter, with Ron and Hermione Weasley and Draco, proudly watch their children leaving for Hogwarts from [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]].

===Sets===
In an interview with ''Architectural Digest'', production designer [[Stuart Craig]] remarked on creating sets for ''Part&nbsp;2''. Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, "our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That was part of the fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble." About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, "We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metalised them to be shiny gold and silver. [[John Richardson (special effects designer)|John Richardson]], the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/resources/features/2011/07/harry-potter-set-design-slideshow |title=Inside Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Production designer Stuart Craig gives AD an exclusive look at the sets of the upcoming film |first=Elizabeth |last=Stamp |work=Architectural Digest |accessdate=23 June 2011}}</ref>

Craig spoke about the Battle of Hogwarts to ''Art Insights Magazine'', saying that "the great challenge is the destruction of Hogwarts. The sun rising behind the smoke ... the massive remains of destroyed walls, the entrance hall, the entrance of the Great Hall, part of the roof of the Great Hall completely gone, so yeah. A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really <U+2013> maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely." When asked about the King's Cross scene near the end of the film, Craig said, "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white <U+2013> so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.artinsightsmagazine.com/ArtInsights_magazine/Stuart_Craig_Interview.html |title=Stuart Craig Interview Transcript |work=Art Insights Magazine |accessdate=23 June 2011}}</ref>

===Visual effects===
Visual Effects Supervisor Tim Burke said that "It was such a major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, and we had to do it in different stages of production. We had shots with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. So, we took the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative." He went on to say that "It's taken two years <U+2013> getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/785760/harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_making_the_hogwarts_battle.html |title=Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2: making the Hogwarts battle |publisher=Den of Greek |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2011}}</ref>

On the quality of 3-D in film, Burke told ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "I think it's good, actually. I think people are going to be really pleased. I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3-D these days, but the work has been done very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3-D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really impressed with it, actually." Producer [[David Heyman]] spoke to ''SFX'' magazine about the 3-D conversion, saying that "The way David Yates is approaching 3-D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3-D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2011/05/26/why-harry-potter%e2%80%99s-3d-will-be-different/ |title=Deathly Hallows producer David Heyman explains why the 3D for the final Potter movie is more than just a gimmick |publisher=SFX |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2011/06/28/harry-potter-visual-effects-wizard-tim-burke-says-3-d-is-very-very-good-in-final-film/ |title='Harry Potter': Visual effects wizard Tim Burke says 3-D is 'very, very good' in final film |work=Los Angeles Times |date=28 June 2011 |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref>

The first review of the film was released on 5 July 2011 by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film {{frac|3|1|2}} out of 4 stars and said that "The finale conjures up enough awe and solemnity to serve as an appropriate finale and a dramatic contrast to the lighthearted (relative) innocence of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone]]'' all those magical years ago."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110713/REVIEWS/110719994 |title=Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |date=13 July 2011|accessdate=9 December 2012|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}</ref> [[Mark Kermode]] from the BBC said that the film is a "pretty solid and ambitious adaptation of a very complex book", but he criticised the post-converted 3D.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/markkermode/2011/07/wild_about_harry.html |title=Wild About Harry |publisher=BBC |first=Mark |last=Kermode |authorlink=Mark Kermode |date=15 July 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> [[Christy Lemire]] of the [[Associated Press]] gave the film {{frac|3|1|2}} out of 4 stars and said "While ''Deathly Hallows: Part 2'' offers long-promised answers, it also dares to pose some eternal questions, and it'll stay with you after the final chapter has closed."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2011/07/11/review_final_potter_film_is_sad_and_satisfying/ |title=Review: Final 'Potter' Film Is Sad and Satisfying |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |date=21 July 2011 |accessdate=21 July 2011 |first=Christy |last=Lemire |authorlink = Christy Lemire |agency = [[Associated Press]] }}</ref> [[Richard Roeper]], also from the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', gave the film an A+ rating and said that "this is a masterful and worthy final chapter in one of the best franchises ever put to film."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardroeper.com/reviews/harrypotterandthedeathlyhallowspart2.aspx |title=Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 Review |publisher=RichardRoeper.com |accessdate=24 July 2011 | authorlink = Richard Roeper }}</ref>

In one of the few negative reviews, Brian Gibson of ''[[Vue Weekly]]'' described the movie as "deadly dull" and a "visual overstatement".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vueweekly.com/film/story/harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_pt._ii/ |title=Harry Potter and the deathly hallows Pt.

It's HALF a film&nbsp;... it's going to feel somewhat emotionless." Other critics wrote of the film's runtime; Alonso Duralde from ''The Wrap'' said, "If there's one substantial flaw to the film, it's that this cavalcade of people and places and objects can barely fit in the 130-minute running time."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/harry-potter/8637555/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-Part-2-round-up-of-reviews.html |title=Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2: round-up of reviews |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref> Rebecca Gillie from ''The Oxford Student'' gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, "at the end of [the film] there is nothing that stays with you once you've left the cinema."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://oxfordstudent.com/2011/07/11/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2-all-of-the-spectacle-none-of-the-magic/ |title=All of the spectacle, none of the magic |work=Rebecca Gillie, The Oxford Student |accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>
