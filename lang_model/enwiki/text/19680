==Biography==
===Early years===
Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland. He is the son of journalists Anna and [[Nils Torvalds]],<ref>TORVALDS, 2001</ref> and the grandson of poet [[Ole Torvalds]]. Both of his parents were campus radicals at the [[University of Helsinki]] in the 1960s.  His family belongs to the [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking minority]] (5.5%) of Finland's population. Torvalds was named after [[Linus Pauling]], the American [[Nobel Prize]]-winning chemist, although in the book ''Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution'', Torvalds is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally for [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]] the [[Peanuts]] cartoon character", noting that this makes him half "Nobel-prize-winning chemist" and half "blanket-carrying cartoon character".<ref name="moody">{{Cite book|last=Moody|first=Glyn|title=Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution|publisher=Perseus Books Group|year=2002|page=336|url=http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/perseus/book_detail_redirect.do?imprintCid=BA&isbn=0738206709|isbn=0738206709}}</ref>

Torvalds attended the [[University of Helsinki]] from 1988 to 1996, graduating with a master's degree in [[computer science]] from NODES research group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/nodes/ |title=NODES research group |publisher=Cs.helsinki.fi |date=2008-10-16 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> His academic career was interrupted after his first year of study when he joined the [[Finnish Army]], selecting the 11-month officer training program to fulfill the [[Conscription in Finland|mandatory military service]] of Finland. In the army he holds the rank of [[Second Lieutenant|second lieutenant]], with the role of a ballistic calculation officer.<ref>Torvalds, 2001, page 29</ref> In 1990, he resumed his university studies, and was exposed to [[UNIX]] for the first time, in the form of a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[MicroVAX]] running [[ULTRIX]].<ref>Torvalds, 2001, page 53</ref>  His M.Sc. thesis was titled ''[[Linux]]: A Portable Operating System''.

His interest in computers began with a [[Commodore VIC-20]].<ref>TORVALDS, 2001, pages 6-7</ref> After the VIC-20 he purchased a [[Sinclair QL]], which he modified extensively, especially its operating system. He programmed an [[assembly language]] and a [[text editor]] for the QL, as well as a few games.<ref>TORVALDS, 2001, pages 41-46</ref> He is known to have written a ''[[Pac-Man]]'' clone named ''Cool Man''.

===Later years===
After a visit to [[Transmeta]] in late 1996,<ref name="linuxonlinebio" /> Torvalds accepted a position at the company in California, where he would work from February 1997 through June 2003. He then moved to the [[Open Source Development Labs]], which has since merged with the [[Free Standards Group]] to become the [[Linux Foundation]], under whose auspices he continues to work. In June 2004, Torvalds and his family moved to [[Portland, Oregon]], to be closer to the OSDL's [[Beaverton, Oregon]]<U+2013>based headquarters.

From 1997 to 1999 he was involved in [[Executable and Linkable Format#86open|86open]] helping to choose the standard binary format for Linux and [[Unix]].

[[Red Hat]] and [[VA Linux]], both leading developers of Linux-based software, presented Torvalds with [[stock option]]s in gratitude for his creation.<ref>{{Cite news

His personal mascot is a [[penguin]] nicknamed [[Tux]],<ref>[http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9605/0855.html Re: Linux Logo prototype.], a Thu, 9 May 1996 message from Linus Torvalds (torvalds@cs.helsinki.fi)</ref> which has been widely adopted by the Linux community as the mascot of the Linux kernel.<ref>[http://www.linux.org/info/penguin.html Why a Penguin?]  from Linux Online</ref>

Although Torvalds believes "[[open source]] is the only right way to do software", he also has said that he uses the "best tool for the job", even if that includes [[proprietary software]].<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8 Linus Torvalds at Google, on Git], 9:50-10:00</ref> He was criticized for his use and alleged advocacy of the proprietary [[BitKeeper]] software for version control in the Linux kernel. However, Torvalds subsequently wrote a free-software replacement for BitKeeper called [[Git (software)|Git]]. Torvalds has commented on official [[GNOME]] developmental mailing lists that, in terms of [[desktop environment]]s, he encourages users to switch to [[KDE]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mail.gnome.org/archives/usability/2005-December/msg00021.html |title=Printing dialog and GNOME |publisher=Mail.gnome.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS8745257437.html |title=Linus versus GNOME |publisher=Desktoplinux.com |date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> However, Torvalds thought [[KDE4|KDE 4.0]] was a "disaster" because of its lack of maturity, so he switched to [[GNOME]].<ref>"it was a half-baked release (...) I'll revisit it when I reinstall the next machine"[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=Software&articleId=9126619&taxonomyId=18&pageNumber=5 Q&A: Linux founder Linus Torvalds talks about open-source identity]</ref>

==The Linus/Linux connection==
{{Main|History of Linux}}
Initially Torvalds wanted to call the kernel he developed ''Freax'' (a combination of "free", "freak", and the letter X to indicate that it is a Unix-like system), but his friend [[Ari Lemmke]], who administered the [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] [[server (computing)|server]] where the kernel was first hosted for downloading, named Torvalds' directory ''linux''.

==Authority and trademark==
About 2% of the Linux kernel as of 2006 was written by Torvalds himself.<ref name="unauthbio"/> Since Linux has had thousands of contributors, such a percentage represents a significant personal contribution to the overall amount of code. Torvalds remains the ultimate authority on what new code is incorporated into the standard Linux kernel.<ref name="Open Life">Henrik Ingo. Open Life: The Philosophy of Open Source. Ingram, 2005. 42-45. [http://openlife.cc/files/OpenLife-aa.pdf Online version]</ref>

Torvalds owns the "Linux" [[trademark]], and monitors<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/linux/00/01/19/0828245.shtml |title=Linus Explains Linux Trademark Issues |publisher=Slashdot.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> use of it chiefly through the [[Linux Mark Institute]].

==Personal life==
Linus Torvalds is married to Tove Torvalds ([[n<U+00E9>e]] Monni)&nbsp;<U+2014> a six-time Finnish national [[karate]] champion&nbsp;<U+2014> whom he first met in the autumn of 1993.<ref>TORVALDS, 2001, page 123</ref><!-- this page/book confirms the date, her name, and the karate champ info --> Torvalds was running introductory computer laboratory exercises for students and instructed the course attendants to send him an [[e-mail]] as a test, to which Tove responded with an e-mail asking for a date.<ref name="moody" /> Tove and Linus were later married and have three daughters, Patricia, Daniela, and Celeste,<ref name="nndbbio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/444/000022378/ |title=Torvalds' bio on |publisher=Nndb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> two of whom were born in the United States.<ref name="oreg100914"/>

Torvalds describes himself as "completely a-religious&nbsp;<U+2014> atheist", adding that "I find that people seem to think religion brings morals and appreciation of nature. I actually think it detracts from both. It gives people the excuse to say, 'Oh, nature was just created,' and so the act of creation is seen to be something miraculous. I appreciate the fact that, 'Wow, it's incredible that something like this could have happened in the first place.'" He later added that while in Europe religion is mostly a personal issue, in America it has become very politicized.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Interview: Linus Torvalds | first=Marjorie | last=Richardson | work=[[Linux Journal]] | url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3655 | date=November 1, 1999 | accessdate=15 November 2009}}</ref>

Torvalds has [[Voter registration#United States|registered to vote in the United States]]; he is unaffiliated with any U.S. political party, saying he has "way too much personal pride to want to be associated with any of them, quite frankly."<ref name="oreg100914"/>

==Recognition==
;Academics
In 1997, Torvalds received his Master degree (Laudatur Grade) from Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki.  Two years later he received honorary doctor status at [[Stockholm University]], and in 2000 he received the same honor from his ''alma mater''.<ref>Torvalds, 2001, page 28</ref>

In August 2005, Torvalds received the [[Howard Vollum|Vollum Award]] from [[Reed College]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2005-2006/082205LinuxCreator.html |title=Linux creator Linus Torvalds honored with Reed College's Vollum Award |publisher=Web.reed.edu |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref>
