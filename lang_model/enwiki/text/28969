The '''Cumberland Road''' ('''National Road''') was the first major improved highway in the [[United States]] to be built by the [[Federal Government of the United States|federal government]]. The approximately {{convert|620|mi|adj=on}} long National Road provided a connection between the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[Ohio River]]s and a gateway to the [[Western United States|West]] for thousands of settlers. When rebuilt in the 1830s, the '''Cumberland Road''' became the first road in the U.S. to use the new [[macadam]] road surfacing.<ref name=ElectricScotland>{{citation |title=John Loudon MacAdam |work=Significant Scots |publisher=ElectricScotland.com |url= http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/macadam_john.htm |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>

Construction began heading west in 1811 at [[Cumberland, Maryland]], on the [[Potomac River]]. It crossed the [[Allegheny Mountains]] and southwestern [[Pennsylvania]], reaching [[Wheeling, Virginia]] (now [[West Virginia]]), on the [[Ohio River]] in 1818. Plans were made to continue through [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], at confluence of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Missouri River]]s, and to [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]] upstream on the Missouri. Following the [[panic of 1837]], however, funding ran dry and construction was stopped at [[Vandalia, Illinois]], after crossing the states of [[Ohio]] and [[Indiana]].

Beyond the National Road's eastern terminus at Cumberland and toward the Atlantic coast, a series of private [[Toll road|turnpikes]] were completed in 1824, connecting the National Road (Pike) with [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and its port on [[Chesapeake Bay]]; these feeder routes formed what is referred to as an eastern extension of the National Road.   In 1835, the road east of Wheeling was turned over to the states for operation as a turnpike. The road's route between Baltimore and Cumberland continues to use the name National Pike or Baltimore National Pike today, with various portions now signed as [[U.S. Route 40]], [[U.S. Route 40 Alternate|Alternate U.S. 40]], or [[Maryland Route 144|Maryland 144]].  A spur between [[Frederick, Maryland]], and [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], now [[Maryland Route 355]], bears various local names but is sometimes referred to as the Washington National Pike;{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  it is now paralleled by [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]] between the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway (I-495)]] and Frederick.

Today, much of the alignment is followed by [[U.S. Route 40|U.S. 40]], with various portions bearing the [[U.S. Route 40 Alternate|Alternate U.S. 40]] designation, or various state-road numbers. The full road, including extensions east to Baltimore and west to St. Louis, was designated "The '''Historic National Road''', an [[All-American Road]]" in 2002.<ref>[http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pressroom/fhwa0227.htm U.S. Transportation Secretary Mineta Names 36 New National Scenic Byways, All-American Roads (6/13/02)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Alt US 40 Cumberland Narrows.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|The [[Cumberland Narrows]] west of Cumberland, Maryland, the water gap along [[Wills Creek (North Branch Potomac River)|Wills Creek]] through which the National Road crosses between [[Haystack Mountain (Maryland)|Haystack Mountain]] (left) and [[Wills Mountain]] (right).  This easy passage through the rugged [[Wills Mountain Anticline]] is now used by the [[Western Maryland Scenic Railroad]] (left), Alternate U.S. 40 (center, left of the creek), and the [[CSX Transportation|CSX Railroad]] (right).]]

===Braddock Road===
The [[Braddock Road (Route 40)|Braddock Road]] had been opened by the [[Ohio Company]] in 1751 between [[Cumberland, Maryland]], the limit of navigation on the [[Potomac River]], and the French [[Fort Duquesne]] at the forks of the [[Ohio River]], a site that would later become [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. It received its name during the [[French and Indian War]] when it was used by [[Edward Braddock|General Edward Braddock]] and [[George Washington]] in the [[Braddock expedition]], an attempt to assault Fort Duquesne.

===Cumberland Road===
[[File:Cumberland-national-road-marker-riverside-park2012.jpg|thumb|Start of the Cumberland National Road marker]]
Construction of the Cumberland Road (which later became part of the National Road) was authorized on March 29, 1806, by President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. The Cumberland Road would replace the Braddock Road for travel between the Potomac and Ohio Rivers, following roughly the same alignment until just east of [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]]. From there, where the Braddock Road turned north to Pittsburgh, the Cumberland Road would continue west to [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] (then part of [[Virginia]]), also on the Ohio River.

The contract for the construction of the first section was awarded to Henry McKinley on May 8, 1811,<ref>http://www.cumberlandroadproject.com/federal/cumberland-road-contracts1.php</ref> and construction began later that year, with the road reaching Wheeling on August 1, 1818. For more than 100 years, a simple granite stone was the only marker of the Road's beginning in Cumberland, MD In June, 2012, a monument and plaza were built in Riverside Park (Cumberland), adjoining the starting place.

===Westward extension===
[[File:Wheeling Suspension Bridge west approach Wheeling Island West Virginia.jpg|thumb|240 px|left|The Wheeling Suspension Bridge across the Ohio River, completed in 1849 and still in use by local traffic.]]
On May 15, 1820, Congress authorized an extension to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], on the [[Mississippi River]], and on March 3, 1825, across the Mississippi to [[Jefferson City, Missouri]]. Work on the extension between Wheeling and [[Zanesville, Ohio]], utilized the pre-existing [[Zane's Trace]], and was completed in 1833 to [[Columbus, Ohio]], and in 1838 to [[Springfield, Ohio]].

At Wheeling, the National Road crossed the [[Ohio River]] on the [[Wheeling Suspension Bridge]], designed by [[Charles Ellet Jr.]] and completed in 1849, then the world's longest bridge span at {{convert|1010|ft|m}} from tower to tower.

===Transfer to States===
Maintenance costs on the Cumberland Road were becoming more than Congress was willing to bear. In agreement with Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania, the Road was to be rebuilt, resurfaced and the section that ran over Haystack Mountain, just West of Cumberland, Maryland, was abandoned and the new Road was built through the Narrows. 
On April 1, 1835, the section east of Wheeling, to Cumberland, was transferred to Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia (West Virginia). The last Congressional [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]] was made May 25, 1838, and in 1840 Congress voted against completing the unfinished portion of the road, with the deciding vote cast by [[Henry Clay]]. By that time, [[railroad]]s were proving a better method of long distance transportation, and the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] was being built west from Baltimore to Cumberland, mostly along the [[Potomac River]], then by a more direct route than the National Road across the [[Allegheny Plateau]] of West Virginia (then Virginia) to Wheeling. Construction of the National Road stopped in 1839, and much of the road through Indiana and Illinois remained unfinished, and was later transferred to the states.

===Subsequent events===
[[Image:Madonna-of-the-Trail-Illino.jpg|thumb|right|[[Madonna of the Trail]] monument along the Old National Road in Vandalia, Illinois]]
In 1912, the Cumberland National Road was chosen to become part of the [[National Old Trails Road]], which would extend further east to [[New York City]] and west to [[San Francisco, California]]. Five [[Madonna of the Trail]] monuments, donated by the Daughters of the American Revolution, were erected along the old National Road.

In 1927, the National Road was designated as the eastern part of [[U.S. Highway 40]], which still generally follows the National Road's alignment with occasional bypasses, realignments, and newer bridges. The mostly parallel [[Interstate 70]] now provides a faster route for through travel without the many sharp curves, steep grades, and narrow bridges of U.S. 40 and other segments of the National Road.  However, between [[Hancock, Maryland|Hancock]] in western [[Maryland]] and [[Washington, Pennsylvania]], I-70 takes a more northerly path to follow the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] (also designated as [[Interstate 76|I-76]]) across the mountains between [[Breezewood, Pennsylvania|Breezewood]] and [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania|New Stanton]], where I-70 turns west to rejoin the National Road's route (and U.S 40) near Washington, Pennsylvania.

The more recently constructed [[Interstate 68]] parallels the old road from Hancock through Cumberland west to [[Keyser's Ridge, Maryland]], where the National Road and U.S. 40 turn northwest into Pennsylvania, but I-68 continues directly west to meet [[Interstate 79]] near [[Morgantown, West Virginia]].  The portion of I-68 in Maryland is designated as the National Freeway.

===Historical structures===
[[File:Casselman River Bridge 1933.jpg|thumb|250 px|left|The Casselman River Bridge in western Maryland in 1933]]
[[File:AUT 0345.JPG|thumb|right|Mile marker along the National Road in Columbus, Ohio.]]
Many of the National Road's original stone [[arch bridge]]s also remain on former alignments. Notable among these is the [[Casselman Bridge, National Road|Casselman River Bridge]] near [[Grantsville, Maryland]]; built in 1813-1814, it was the longest single-span stone arch bridge in the world at the time.

The [[Wheeling Suspension Bridge]] across the Ohio River, opened in 1849, is the oldest vehicular suspension bridge in the United States still in use.  A newer bridge carries I-70 and the realigned U.S. 40 across the river nearby.  The original bridge is listed as both a [[National Historic Landmark]] and [[Historic Civil Engineering Landmark]].

One of the road's original [[toll house]]s is preserved in [[La Vale, Maryland]], and two others are located in [[Addison, Pennsylvania]], and near [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]].

Many [[mile marker]]s can still be found along the National Road, some well-maintained, others deteriorating, and yet others represented by modern replacements.

Various sections of [[brick]] pavement, built in the early twentieth century, are still in use on little-traveled alignments, particularly in eastern Ohio.

[[File:S Bridge by Old Washington.jpg|thumb|right|The S Bridge on the National Road east of Old Washington, Ohio]]
The western terminus of the National Road at its greatest extent was at the [[Kaskaskia River]] in [[Vandalia, Illinois]], near the intersection of modern [[US 51 (IL)|U.S. 51]] and [[US 40 (IL)|U.S. 40]]. The road proceeded east along modern U.S. 40 through south central Illinois. The National Road continued into Indiana along modern U.S. 40, passing by the cities of Terre Haute and Indianapolis. Within Indianapolis, the National Road used the original alignment of U.S. 40 along West Washington and East [[Washington Street (Indianapolis)|Washington street]]s (modern U.S. 40 is now routed along [[I-465]]). East of Indianapolis, the road went through the city of Richmond before entering the state of Ohio. In Ohio, the road continued along modern U.S. 40 and passed through the northern suburbs of Dayton, Springfield, and the city of Columbus. West of [[Zanesville, Ohio]], despite U.S. 40's predominantly following the original route, many segments of the original road can still be found. Between Old Washington and Morristown, the original roadbed has been overlaid by [[I-70]]. The road then continued east across the [[Ohio River]] into Wheeling in West Virginia, the original western end of the National Road when it was first paved. After running {{convert|15|mi|km}} in West Virginia, the National Road then entered Pennsylvania. The road cut across southwestern Pennsylvania, heading southeast for about {{convert|90|mi|km}} before entering Maryland. East of Keyser's Ridge, the road used modern Alternate U.S. 40 to the city of Cumberland (modern U.S. 40 is now routed along [[I-68]]). Cumberland was the original eastern terminus of the road. In the mid-19th century, a turnpike extension to Baltimore <U+2013> along what is now Maryland Route 144 from Cumberland to Hancock, U.S. 40 from Hancock to Hagerstown, Alternate U.S. 40 from Hagerstown to Frederick, and Maryland Route 144 from Frederick to Baltimore <U+2013> was approved. The approval process was a hotly debated subject because of the removal of the original macadam construction that made this road famous.
