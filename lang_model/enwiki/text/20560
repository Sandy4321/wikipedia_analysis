The '''Berwyn Heights mayor's residence drug raid''' was a controversial action taken by the [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] [[Prince George's County Sheriff's Office|Sheriff's Office]] and [[Prince George's County Police Department|Police Department]] at the home of [[Berwyn Heights, Maryland|Berwyn Heights]] mayor [[Cheye Calvo]] on July 29, 2008.  The raid was the culmination of an investigation that began in [[Arizona]], where a package containing 32 lbs of [[marijuana]] was found addressed to the mayor's residence.  Once the package arrived at the house, police raided and took the mayor and his mother-in-law into custody, killing his two dogs in the process.

The event gained national and international media attention.  While the Calvos were cleared of wrongdoing, the police were accused by the Calvos and [[civil rights]] groups of lacking a proper [[search warrant]], [[excessive force]], and failure to conduct a proper background investigation of the home being raided.  Despite the criticisms, no action has been taken against the officers or their respective police departments.

==Raid==
On July 29, 2008, a [[SWAT]] team from the Sheriff's Office, agents of the State of Maryland, executing a [[search warrant]] and assisting the separate [[Prince George's County Police|County Police]], conducted a raid on the home of [[Berwyn Heights, Maryland|Berwyn Heights]] Mayor [[Cheye Calvo]]. The raid was initiated after the Mayor brought a package delivered by the SWAT team into his home. A drug-sniffing dog in Arizona had determined that the package<U+2014>addressed to the Mayor's wife<U+2014>contained 32 pounds of [[marijuana]]. While taking control of the residence, Sheriff's deputies shot Calvo's two pet [[Labrador retriever]]s, including one who was cited by Calvo to be running away from officers.<ref>{{cite news | last = [[Associated Press]]| title = SWAT team raids Md. mayor's home, kills 2 dogs  | publisher = [[USA Today]] | date = [[2008-07-31]] | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-07-31-mayor-raid_N.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-21}}</ref> Calvo and his mother-in-law were handcuffed and questioned for several hours, with Calvo wearing just underwear.<ref name="Editorial-WashPost-7Aug2008">{{cite news | title = Editorials: Shoot First, Ask Later; In Prince George's, a drug bust goes awry | pages = page A20 | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] | date = [[2008-08-07]] | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/06/AR2008080602795.html | accessdate = 2008-08-21}}</ref>

In a press conference on the same day as High's exoneration, Sheriff [[Michael A. Jackson (sheriff)|Michael A. Jackson]] defended the conduct of the deputies who conducted the raid.  However, an internal investigation was launched as with any incident involving the discharge of a deputy's weapon.<ref name="Davis-WashPost-9Aug2008"/>  The results of the investigation, released on September 4, 2008, concluded the conduct of the deputies was appropriate and no wrongdoing was committed.<ref name="Helderman-WashPost-5Sept2008">{{cite news | last = Helderman | first = Rosalind S. | coauthors= Aaron C.

==Criticism of police actions==
===Improper search warrant===
During the interrogation, Calvo repeatedly requested to see the search warrant, but his lawyer stated no copy was provided until three days later. A County Police spokesman initially stated that a [[no-knock warrant]] had been issued for Calvo's home. However, after Calvo's lawyer challenged that statement and media published copies of the warrant, the commander of the county's narcotics enforcement division stated that no-knock warrants do not exist in the county.<ref>{{cite news | last = Helderman | first = Rosalind S. | coauthors = Aaron C.

===Lack of a background investigation===
During interrogation, Calvo stated that officers did not believe he was the Mayor and for a time refused his request that they contact the Berwyn Heights Police Department (which was unaware of the raid) to confirm his identity.<ref>{{cite web | title = Mayor describes raid | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = [[2008-08-08]] | url = http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/crime/2008/08/08/am.intv.mayor.calvo.drug.raid.cnn?iref=videosearch | accessdate = 2008-08-21}}</ref>  Police Chief High stated his department did not know the home was owned by the mayor and his wife.<ref name="Davis-WashPost-9Aug2008"/>

Patrick Murphy, chief of police for the Berwyn Heights Police Department, was especially critical of the county police.<ref name="David-WashPost-31Jul2008"/>  Murphy argued that the raid could have been prevented if his department had handled the situation, stating "you can't tell me the chief of police of a municipality wouldn't have been able to knock on the door of the mayor of that municipality, gain his confidence and enter the residence".  Furthermore, according to Mayor Calvo, a [[memorandum of understanding]] between the county and the city requires county police to inform the city if an operation is being conducted within their jurisdiction.<ref name="CalvoBalkoChrist-Cato-Policy-Forum">{{cite news | last = Calvo | first = Cheye | coauthors= Radley Balko, Peter Christ| title = Should No-Knock Police Raids Be Rare or Routine? | pages = 9-11 |work = Cato Policy Report | publisher = [[Cato Institute]] | date = [[2008-09-11]] | url = http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v30n6/cpr30n6.pdf | accessdate = 2009-01-06}}</ref>

===Accusations of excessive force===
In an editorial a week after the shooting, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' criticized the actions of police officers as "a [[Keystone Cops]] operation from start to finish", alluding to the lack of proper execution by the sheriff's department's SWAT team.<ref name="Editorial-WashPost-7Aug2008"/>  Additionally, libertarian groups such as the [[Cato Institute]] were critical of the operation and used it as an example of the dangers of the [[War on Drugs]] and the militarization of local police departments in the United States.<ref name="CalvoBalkoChrist-Cato-Policy-Forum"/><ref name="Firey-Cato@Liberty-2Aug2008>{{cite web | last = Firey | first = Thomas | title = Another Police Raid; More Dead Dogs |work = Cato @ Liberty Official Blog | publisher = [[Cato Institute]] | date = [[2008-08-02]] | url = http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2008/08/02/another-police-raid-more-dead-dogs/ | accessdate = 2009-01-06}}</ref>  Marc Fisher of the ''Post'' also related this incident to the growing prevalence of SWAT units, even in small jurisdictions, noting a massive increase in the amount of SWAT deployments since the mid-1980s.<ref name="Fisher-WashPost-14Sept2008"/>

Further criticism was leveled against the sheriff's department's deputies for the shooting of Calvo's two dogs.  Contrary to the official internal investigations conducted by the sheriff's department and the county, Calvo stated his dogs were not a threat to the deputies.  To support his claims, Calvo paid for a [[necropsy]] to be conducted on each dog by the Maryland Department of Agriculture.  According to the results, one dog was shot four times, including twice in the head and chest.  The other dog was shot twice, including once in the back of the leg which, according to Calvo, bolstered his argument that the dog was fleeing and that the force used was "unbelievably excessive".<ref name="Helderman-WashPost-5Sept2008"/>

==Later arrests==
Prince George's County Police later arrested two men in a drug trafficking plan involving the shipment of large parcels of marijuana to addresses of uninvolved residents. After each parcel was delivered outside the addressee's home, another individual would retrieve the drugs. Police seized six packages containing
417 pounds of marijuana.<ref name="baltimoresun.com">{{cite news  | last = Donovan | first = Doug  | title = Prince George's raid prompts call for probe: Berwyn Heights mayor denounces police tactics | publisher = [[The Baltimore Sun]] | date = [[2008-08-07]] | url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-mayor0807,0,4563211.story | accessdate = 2008-08-21}}</ref>
