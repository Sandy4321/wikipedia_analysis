'''''Something the Lord Made''''' is a 2004 film about the black cardiac pioneer [[Vivien Thomas]] and his complex and volatile partnership with white surgeon [[Alfred Blalock]], the world famous "Blue Baby doctor" who pioneered modern heart surgery. Based on the [[National Magazine Award]]-winning ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' magazine article "Like Something the Lord Made" by [[Katie McCabe]],<ref name=McCabe>{{cite news|last1=McCabe|first1=Katie|title=Like Something the Lord Made|url=http://reprints.longform.org/something-the-lord-made-mccabe|accessdate=8 November 2014|publisher=The Washingtonian|date=August 1989}}</ref> the film was directed by [[Joseph Sargent]] and written by Peter Silverman and Robert Caswell.

==Plot summary==
''Something the Lord Made'' tells the story of the 34-year partnership that begins in Depression Era [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1930 when Blalock ([[Alan Rickman]]) hires Thomas ([[Mos Def]]) as an assistant in his [[Vanderbilt University]] lab, expecting him to perform janitorial work. But Thomas' remarkable manual dexterity and intellectual acumen confound Blalock's expectations, and Thomas rapidly becomes indispensable as a research partner to Blalock in his forays into heart surgery.

The film traces the two men's work when they move in 1941 from Vanderbilt to [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]], an institution where the only black employees are janitors and where Thomas must enter by the back door. Together, they attack the congenital heart defect of [[Tetralogy of Fallot]], also known as [[Blue Baby Syndrome]], and in so doing they open the field of heart surgery.

Helen Taussig ([[Mary Stuart Masterson]]), the pediatrician/cardiologist at Johns Hopkins, challenges Blalock to come up with a surgical solution for her Blue Babies. She needs a new {{lang|la|''[[ductus]]''}} for them to oxygenate their blood.

The duo is seen experimenting on the dogs, deliberately giving the dogs the heart defect and trying to solve it. The outcome looks good and they are excited to operate on the baby, but in a dream, Thomas sees the baby grown up and crying because she's dying. Thomas asks why she's dying in the dream and she says it's because she has a baby heart. Blalock interprets it as the fact that their sewing technique didn't work because the sutures didn't grow with the heart, and worked on a new version that would work.

The film dramatizes Blalock's and Thomas' fight to save the dying Blue Babies. Blalock praises Thomas' surgical skill as being "like something the Lord made", and insists that Thomas coach him through the first Blue Baby surgery over the protests of Hopkins administrators. Yet outside the lab, they are separated by the prevailing racism of the time. Blalock makes a mistake once by accidentally cutting an artery at the wrong place, but eventually, alongside with Thomas, succeeds.  Thomas attends Blalock's parties as a bartender, moonlighting for extra income, and when Blalock is honored for the Blue Baby work at the segregated Belvedere Hotel, Thomas is not among the invited guests. Instead, he watches from behind a potted palm at the rear of the ballroom. The next day, Thomas reveals that he saw the ceremony, and quits from his lab. However, Thomas quickly comes back to Blalock, seeing that Thomas underwent difficulties in the outside world.

One day before Blalock dies, he sees Thomas, now a professional surgeon and trainer in the open heart surgery wing. After Blalock's death, Thomas continued his work at Johns Hopkins training surgeons. At the end of the film, in a formal ceremony, Hopkins recognized Thomas' work and awarded him an honorary doctorate. A portrait of Thomas was placed on the walls of Johns Hopkins next to Blalock's portrait, which had been hung there years earlier.

==Film background==

A man who in life avoided the limelight, Thomas remained virtually unknown outside the circle of Hopkins surgeons he trained. Thomas' story was first brought to public attention by Washington writer Katie McCabe, who learned of his work with Blalock on the day of his death in a 1985 interview with a prominent Washington, D.C. surgeon who described Thomas as "an absolute legend." McCabe's 1989 ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' magazine article on Thomas, "Like Something the Lord Made",<ref name=McCabe/> generated widespread interest in the story and inspired the making of a 2003 public television documentary on Thomas and Blalock, "Partners of the Heart."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/dome/0301/close_up.cfm|title=Almost A Miracle|work=Dome|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University|author=Mary Ann Ayd|date=February 2003|volume=54|number=1}}</ref>  A Washington, D.C. dentist, Dr. Irving Sorkin, discovered McCabe's article and brought it to Hollywood, where it was developed into the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/10/AR2007111001586.html|title=Dentist Had Hankering for Show Business|work=The Washington Post|author=Matt Schudel|date=November 11, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/25/local/me-sorkin25|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Irving Sorkin, 88; dentist saw Hollywood dream come true as award-winning producer|author=Dennis McLellan|date=October 25, 2007}}</ref>

The film was nominated for nine [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]] Awards (including acting nominations for both principals) and won three, for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie|Outstanding Made for Television Movie]], Outstanding Cinematography for a Miniseries or Movie (Don Morgan) and Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special (Michael Brown). It also received two [[Golden Globe]] nominations, [[Black Reel Awards]] for [[Black Reel Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[Black Reel Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] ([[Clayton LeBouef]], in the role of Thomas' activist brother Harold), an [[NAACP Image Award]], a [[Peabody Award]],<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/something-the-lord-made 64th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2005.</ref> a [[Directors Guild of America]] Award for Sargent, and a [[Writers Guild of America]] Award for Silverman and Caswell. The [[American Film Institute]], which named ''Something the Lord Made'' the Best Television Movie of the Year for 2004, called it "a revelation...a bittersweet story [that] is an important tool for America as it continues to search for a public vocabulary to discuss issues of race."{{Full citation|date=April 2014}}
