Oh attended [[Kyunggi High School]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. He had been a pitcher since he began baseball, but he switched to the outfield after getting serious arm injuries in 1999. He joined the [[Korea Baseball Organization|2001 KBO Draft]] at the end of his last high school season, but, despite intriguing some [[MLB]] scouts, went undrafted, and Oh elected to attend college instead. 

After graduation from high school, Oh played college baseball at [[Dankook University]], but he missed the entire 2001 and 2002 seasons after undergoing [[Tommy John surgery]] in 2001. 

In 2003, he came back to the mound, pitching limited innings as a [[relief pitcher]]. 

In 2004, his senior year at [[Dankook University]], he swept most college baseball awards as a pitcher. On June, he made his first appearance for the [[South Korea national baseball team]], and competed as a [[closer]] in the [[World University Baseball Championship|2nd World University Baseball Championship]] held in [[Tainan City|Tainan]], [[Taiwan]], winning a bronze medal.
