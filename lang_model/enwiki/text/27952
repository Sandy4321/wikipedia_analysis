According to the 2010 Census Bureau figures, the population of the city is 6,928, an increase of 3.4% from the 2000 census.<ref>http://www.stateplanning.delaware.gov/census_data_center/</ref> It the principal city of the Seaford [[Seaford micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which is the largest [[United States micropolitan area|micropolitan area]] in the United States and includes all of Sussex County.

It is the largest city fully within Sussex County and was voted the 28th Best Small Town in America.<ref>Crampton, N. (1996). The 100 Best Small Towns in America.

==History==
===Name origin===
Seaford is named after [[Seaford, East Sussex]] in [[England]].<ref>Katy Rice, 'Across the Pond', in ''Sussex Society'', September 2011, p. 28</ref>

===Once in Maryland===

All land in current western and southern Sussex County was first settled as part of Maryland. Seaford, along with Bridgeville, Greenwood, Middleford, and others, were all part of Dorchester County in the Province of Maryland. Blades, Laurel, and Concord areas, on the other hand, were part of Somerset County. It is reported that an error in a map coordinate resulted in the east-west line of Delaware being from current Delmar to Fenwick. The original agreement had the eastwest line at the Cape Henlopen, not at the false cape. If the line had survived, Seaford would now be in Maryland. After many years in the courts of London, the boundary lines are as the surveyors Mason and Dixon defined in 1763.

===Governor [[William H. H. Ross|Ross]] and the Civil War===

Only {{convert|20|acre|m2}} of land remain from the plantations original size of {{convert|1400|acre|km2}}. There are many notable buildings on this property, you can find a granary, stable, smokehouse, corn cribs, and Delaware's only documented surviving slave quarters.

===Downtown renovations===

Seaford is one of seven [[Main street#Preservation and Main Street|Main Street]] communities that participated in the Delaware Main Street Program, part of the national Main Street plan to revitalize commercial districts. The program was developed in the 1970s by the National Trust Main Street Center,<ref>[http://www.mainstreet.org National Trust Main Street Center]</ref> which was in turn a program of the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]. In 1999-2000 Seaford's historic downtown area along High Street underwent major renovations, preserving the city's old fashioned charm with $1.5 million of landscaping, street paving, sidewalks, lamp posts, street lights, and utility upgrades.
