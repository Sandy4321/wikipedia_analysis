The '''UNIOP-INUSOP affair''' was a Belgian [[political scandal]] of the [[1990s|early 1990s]], in which it was alleged that [[Minister (government)|government ministers]] from the Socialist Party overpaid for political studies in the late 1980s. 

The affair is named after the polling institute UNIOP (''Universitair Instituut voor Opiniepeilingen'') - INUSOP (''Institut Universitaire de Sondage d'Opinion''), which was closely related to the  [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] and [[Universit<U+00E9> Libre de Bruxelles]].

Among those whom prosecutors sought to charge in 1994 were foreign minister [[Willy Claes]],  former Brussels region Premier [[Philippe Moureaux]] and former defense minister [[Guy Co<U+00EB>me]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Veteran foreign minister faces probe over government contracts | publisher =  Agence France Presse | date = July 02, 1994}}</ref> A parliamentary panel judged, however, that sufficient evidence was available to charge only Co<U+00EB>me.
