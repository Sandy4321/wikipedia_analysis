[[Image:DFB Pokal.jpg|thumb|The trophy]]

The '''DFB-Pokal''' ([[German Football Association|Deutscher Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bund-Pokal]] or German Football-Federation Cup) is an elimination [[football (soccer)|football]] tournament held annually. It is the second most important national title in German football after the [[Bundesliga (football)|Bundesliga]] championship.

==Format==

The competition format has varied considerably since the inception of the Tschammer-Pokal in 1935.

=== Participation ===

The DFB-Pokal begins with a round of 64 teams. The 36 teams of the [[Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] and [[2. Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bundesliga|2nd Bundesliga]], along with the top four finishers of the [[3rd Liga]] are automatically qualified for the tournament. Of the remaining slots 21 are given to the cup winners of the regional football associations. The three remaining slots are given to three the regional associations with the most men's teams. They may assign the slot as they see fit but usually give it to the runner up in the association cup. As every team is entitled to participate in local tournaments which qualify for the association cups every team can in principle compete in the DFB-Pokal. Backup teams are not allowed in the competition, though.<ref name=rules>{{cite web | title = DFB Cup Men - Mode | publisher = DFB | date = [[2008]] | accessdate = 2008-10-09 | url = http://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=460546}}</ref>

=== Seeding ===

The pairings for the DFB-Pokal are not entirely random as the teams are split into two pots of 32 teams each. One pot contains all the amateur teams including teams from the [[3rd Liga]] and the teams just being promoted to the [[2. Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bundesliga|2nd Bundesliga]]. The other pot contains the teams from the Bundesliga and the teams of the 2nd Bundesliga, which are not just being promoted. Therefore in the first round of the cup each professional team plays an amateur team. Since [[DFB Cup 1982-83|1982]] the amateur generally plays at home when facing a professional team.

For the second round the teams are again divided into two pots according to the same principles. This time the pots don't have to be of equal size though, depending on the results of the first round. Amateur teams get paired with professional teams until one pot is empty. The remaining teams are then drawn from the nonempty pot with the team first drawn playing at home.

For the remaining rounds other than the final the teams are drawn from one pot. Since [[DFB Cup 1984-85|1985]] the final is every year held in the [[Olympic Stadium, Berlin|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Berlin]].<ref name=rules />

=== Match Rules ===

All cup games have a regular time of two times 45 minutes with the winner advancing to the next round. In case of a draw the game gets extended by two times 15 minutes. If the score is still level after 120 minutes the winner is determined by a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]].<ref name=rules />

=== History ===

Historically the number of participants in the main tournament has varied between four from [[DFB Cup 1955-56|1956]] until [[DFB Cup 1959-60|1960]] and 128 from [[DFB Cup 1973-74|1973]] through [[DFB Cup 1981-82|1982]] resulting in tournaments of two to seven rounds. Since the inception of the [[Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] in 1963 all clubs from the Bundesliga are automatically qualified for the DFB-Pokal as are all clubs from the [[2. Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bundesliga|2nd Bundesliga]] since its inception in [[Second Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bundesliga 1974-75|1974]]. Backup teams have for most of the time been allowed to participate in the DFB-Pokal but are excluded since [[DFB Cup 2008-09|2008]].

The final is since [[DFB Cup 1984-85|1985]] every year held in the [[Olympic Stadium, Berlin|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Berlin]]. Before 1985 the host of the final was determined on short notice. The [[DFB]] hereby took into consideration the ease with which supporters of both finalists could reach the site.

Originally the cup games were held over two times 45 minutes with two times 15 minutes extra time in case of a draw. If the score was still level after 120 minutes the game was replayed with the home field right reversed. In the Tschammer-Pokal 1939 the semi-final between [[SV Waldhof Mannheim]] and [[Wacker Wien]] was a draw three times before the game was decided by lot. The [[DFB]] decided to hold a penalty shootout if the replay was a another draw after a similar situation arose in the [[DFB Cup 1969-70|1970 cup]], when the match between [[Alemannia Aachen]] and [[SV Werder Bremen]] had to be decided by lot after two draws.

In [[DFB Cup 1971-72|1971-72]] and [[DFB Cup 1972-73|1972-73]] the matches were held over two legs. The second leg was extended by two times 15 minutes if the aggregate was a draw after both legs. In case the extension brought no decision a penalty shooutout was held.

When in [[DFB Cup 1976-77|1977]] the final [[1. FC K<U+00F6>ln]] vs. [[Hertha BSC]] had to be replayed this led to great logistic difficulties. In the aftermath the DFB decided not to let cup finals to be replayed in the future instead holding a penalty shootout after extra time. Eventually this change was extended to all cup games in [[DFB Cup 1991-92|1991]].

==History==

The first German cup was held in 1935. It was then called ''von Tschammer und Osten Pokal'', or short ''Tschammerpokal'', named after ''Reichssportf<U+00FC>hrer'' (Sports Chief of the Reich) [[Hans von Tschammer und Osten]]. The first final was contested between the two most successful clubs of that era, the [[1. FC Nuremberg]] and [[Schalke 04]], with Nuremberg winning 2 &ndash; 0.<ref>{{cite web | title = Wie alles begann... | publisher = fussballdaten.de | date = [[September 8]] [[2006]] | accessdate = 2008-10-10 | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/news/2157/ | language = German}}</ref> After the last Tschammerpokal was held in 1943 the cup was not held for almost 20 years, being re-introduced by the [[DFB]] in [[DFB Cup 1952-53|1952]] under its current name DFB-Pokal. In [[DFB Cup 1964-65|1965]] the original trophy, ''Goldfasanen-Pokal'', was substituted by the trophy which is still awarded today, because the original reminded DFB-president [[Peco Bauwens]] of the Nazi-era.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Trophy | publisher = DFB | date = ? | accessdate = 2008-10-10 | url = http://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=460545}}</ref>

Having won now 14 titles [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] has been the most successful team in the cup since they won their fourth title in [[DFB Cup 1968-69|1969]]. They are also the most recent champion.

It   was introduced in 1949 and awarded annually until 1991 after [[German reunification]] in 1990 led to the merger of the football leagues of the two Germanys.

== Women's German Cup ==
