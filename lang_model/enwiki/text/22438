On 23 March 2011, he was elected Major Archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church to replace the retired [[Lubomyr Husar]]. This decision was confirmed by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on 25 March 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://risu.org.ua/en/index/all_news/catholics/ugcc/41423/ |title=Argentinian Bishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk became new head of Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church |author=RISU |accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/27096.php?index=27096&lang=en |title=Conferma all'elezione dell'Arcivescovo Maggiore di Kyiv-Halyc (Ucraina) |work=Holy See Press Office |accessdate=25 March 2011}}</ref> He was enthroned on 27 March 2011.

==Major Archepiscopate==
On 29 March 2011, Major Archbishop Shevchuk said "''I'm departing with my bishops and all of the metropolitans of our church to Rome, because it's our duty to make a courtesy visit to the Holy Father (i.e., the Pope),''" he said a press conference in Kyiv. The [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|UGCC]] leader said that the UGCC Synod of Bishops had prepared a number of proposals for the Pope. "''We're really going to tell of how our church is developing and that each developing church [becomes] a [[patriarch]]ate, because a patriarchate is a period in the completion of the development of a church,''" he said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/64649/ |title=Major Archbishop Sviatoslav to ask Pope to grant Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church status of patriarchate <U+2013> Ukrainian news.

Instead, [[Pope Paul VI]] responded by devising the rank of "[[Major Archbishop]]", which grants all the prerogatives of an Eastern patriarch to the head of a self-governing church in [[full communion]], just without the title itself. On 12 June 2012 Major Archbishop Shevchuk was appointed a member of the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]].<ref>http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/29334.php?index=29334&lang=en</ref>

On Sunday, 9 September 2012, after the participants took an oath the previous day, Major Archbishop Shevchuk celebrated the [[Divine Liturgy]] to open a worldwide Ukrainian Catholic Synod of Bishops at [[Saints Volodymyr and Olha Cathedral]] in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cnsblog.wordpress.com/2012/09/08/ukrainian-catholic-leader-shares-favorites-faith-in-winnipeg/ |title=Ukrainian Catholic leader shares favorites, faith in Winnipeg &#124; CNS Blog |publisher=Cnsblog.wordpress.com |date=2012-09-09 |accessdate=2013-03-03}}</ref> He also visited Miller Comprehensive High School and stopped at St. Basils Ukrainian Catholic Church and St. Athanasius Ukrainian Catholic Church, on 21 September 2012 in Regina Saskatchewan. He stopped in Vancouver to mark the 100th anniversary of the first Canadian visit of a Ukrainian Catholic bishop.<ref>[http://www.leaderpost.com/life/Head+Ukrainian+Catholic+Church+visiting+Regina/7257022/story.html#ixzz270qTbxqo ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

===Interview===
In April 2011, Shevchuk said while visiting Rome to meet [[Pope Benedict XVI]], that he believes he was elected "despite my age". Ukrainian bishops from around the world, who met in a synod in late March to elect a new major archbishop for their church, were looking for a leader who could "unite the church in Ukraine and outside Ukraine," who could "promote the unity of Christians in Ukraine and establish some sort of dialogue with the new Ukrainian government". He continued, saying "The No. 1 priority for each head of a church is evangelization, preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ in today's world". "Of course, our church is growing, is developing its structures ... but we are conscious that the decision about the patriarchate belongs to the Holy Father and we would never press him. We respect his freedom." Major Archbishop Shevchuk also said his age is not really so shocking when one considers that the average age of his priests is about 35. "In our tradition, we do have a married clergy, but a married clergy is not the main reason we have so many young priests," he said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1101281.htm |title=Ukrainian archbishop says he was chosen 'despite age' to promote unity |publisher=Catholicnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-03}}</ref> On 22 June 2011 Major Archbishop Shevchuk was appointed a member of the [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]] to a five-year term. It may be renewed every five years until his 80th birthday.

===Patriarch Kirill meeting===
When asked in April 2011 whether he would wish to meet the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] [[Patriarch Kirill]], Shevchuk said that "I would like very much to visit him and hold a personal meeting with him. I am convinced that in peacefully and openly communicating with each other, we can relieve any tension". He continued saying that "I think that today, we should heal the wounds rather than irritate and deepen them. One can heal the wounds of our memory only with mutual forgiveness. Therefore, as for any our brethren or neighbors who wounded us or were wounded by us, the best way to communicate is to be open in a brotherly dialogue, be open to the purification of our memory, to ask for forgiveness and to forgive,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://risu.org.ua/en/index/all_news/confessional/interchurch_relations/41567/ |title=Head of UGCC would like to meet with Patriarch Kirill to relieve tension |publisher=Risu.org.ua |date=15 June 2012 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>
