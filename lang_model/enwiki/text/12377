'''The Rashtrakuta Dynasty''' ([[Sanskrit]]: <U+0930><U+093E><U+0937><U+094D><U+091F><U+094D><U+0930><U+0915><U+0942><U+091F> ''r<U+0101><U+1E63><U+1E6D>rak<U+016B><U+1E6D>a'', [[Kannada language|Kannada]]: <U+0CB0><U+0CBE><U+0CB7><U+0CCD><U+0C9F><U+0CCD><U+0CB0><U+0C95><U+0CC2><U+0C9F>) was a royal Indian dynasty ruling large parts of southern, central and northern India between the sixth and the thirteenth centuries. During this period they ruled as several closely related, but individual clans. The earliest known Rashtrakuta [[Indian inscriptions|inscription]] is a seventh century [[copper plate grant]] that mentions  their rule from Manpur in the [[Malwa]] region of modern [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Other ruling Rashtrakuta clans from the same period mentioned in inscriptions were the kings of Achalapur which is modern Elichpur in [[Maharashtra]] and the rulers of [[Kannauj]]. Several controversies exist regarding the origin of these early Rashtrakutas, their native home and their language. 

The clan that ruled from Elichpur was a feudatory of the [[Badami Chalukyas]] and during the rule of [[Dantidurga]], it overthrew Chalukya [[Kirtivarman II]] and went on to build an impressive empire with the [[Gulbarga]] region in modern [[Karnataka]] as its base. This clan came to be known as the Rashtrakutas of [[Manyakheta]], rising to power in South India in 753. At the same time the [[Pala Dynasty]] of Bengal and the [[Prathihara]] dynasty of Gujarat were gaining force in eastern and northwestern India respectively. 

This period, between the eight and the tenth centuries, saw a tripartite struggle for the resources of the rich [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Gangetic plains]], each of these three empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for short periods of time. At their peak the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ruled a vast empire stretching from the [[Ganges|Ganga River]] and [[Yamuna River]]  [[doab]] in the north to [[Cape Comorin]] in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions. The early kings of this dynasty were Hindu but the later kings were strongly influenced by Jainism.

During their rule, [[Jain]] mathematicians and scholars contributed important works in [[Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit]]. [[Amoghavarsha I]] was the most famous king of this dynasty and wrote ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'', a landmark literary work in the Kannada language. Architecture reached a milestone in the [[Indian architecture#Hindu architecture|Dravidian]] style, the finest examples of which are seen in the  [[Kailash Temple|Kailasanath Temple]] at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] and the sculptures of [[Elephanta Caves]] in modern [[Maharashtra]] as well as in the Kashivishvanatha temple and  the Jain Narayana temple at [[Pattadakal]] in modern [[Karnataka]], all of which are [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].

The origin of Rashtrakuta dynasty has been a controversial topic. These issues pertain to the origins of the earliest ancestors of the Rashtrakutas during the time of Emperor [[Ashoka]] in the second century [[Common Era|BCE]],<ref name="arattas">Reu (1933), pp1-5</ref> and the connection between the several Rashtrakuta dynasties that ruled small kingdoms in northern and central India and the Deccan between the sixth and seventh centuries. The relationship of these medieval Rashtrakutas to the most famous later dynasty, the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta (present day Malkhed in the [[Gulbarga district]], Karnataka state), who ruled between the eighth and tenth centuries has also been debated.<ref name="connect">Altekar (1934), pp1-32</ref><ref name="connect1">Reu (1933), pp6-9, pp47-53</ref><ref name="study1"/>

The heart of the Rashtrakutas empire included nearly all of Karnataka, Maharashtra and parts of [[Andhra Pradesh]], an area which the Rastrakutas ruled for over two centuries. The Samangadh [[copper plate grant]] (753) confirms that the feudatory King Dantidurga, who probably ruled from Achalapura in Berar (modern Elichpur in Maharashtra), defeated the great Karnatic army (referring to the army of the Badami Chalukyas) of Kirtivarman II of Badami in 753 and took control of the northern regions of the Chalukya empire.<ref name="karnatik">Reu (1933), p54</ref><ref name="karnata">From Rashtrakuta inscriptions call the Badami Chalukya army ''Karnatabala'' (power of ''Karnata'') (Kamath 2001, p57,p65)</ref><ref name="achala">Altekar in Kamath (2001), p72</ref> He then helped his father-in-law, [[Pallava]] King Nandivarman regain Kanchi from the Chalukyas and defeated the Gurjaras of [[Malwa]], and the kings of Kalinga, Kosala and [[Srisailam]].<ref name="srisila">Sastri (1955), p141</ref><ref name="Gulbarga">Thapar (2003), p333</ref>

The successor of Govinda III, Amoghavarsha I made Manyakheta his capital and ruled a large empire.

During the rule of [[Khottiga Amoghavarsha]], the [[Paramara]] King Siyaka Harsha attacked the empire and plundered Manyakheta, the capital of Rastrakutas. This seriously undermined the reputation of the Rastrakuta Empire and consequently led to its downfall.<ref name="Amoghavarsha IV">{{cite web|title=Amoghavarsha IV|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050671/Manyakheta|publisher=2007 Encyclopedia Brittanica|work=|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref> The final decline was sudden as [[Tailapa II]], a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta ruling from Tardavadi province in modern [[Bijapur district]], declared himself independent by taking advantage of this defeat.<ref name="Tailapa">The province of Tardavadi in the very heart of the Rashtrakuta empire was given to Tailapa II as a ''fief'' (provincial grant) by Rashtrakuta [[Krishna III]] for services rendered in war (Sastri 1955, p162)</ref><ref name="tailapa1">Kamath (2001), p101</ref> Indra IV, the last king, committed [[Sallekhana]] (fasting unto death practised by Jain monks) at [[Shravanabelagola]]. With the fall of the Rashtrakutas, their feudatories and related clans in the Deccan and northern India declared independence. The Western Chalukyas annexed Manyakheta and made it their capital until 1015 and built an impressive empire in the Rashtrakuta heartland during the eleventh century. The focus of dominance shifted to the [[Krishna River]] - [[Godavari River]] doab called [[Vengi]]. The former feudatories of the Rashtrakutas in western Deccan were brought under control of the Chalukyas and the hitherto suppressed Cholas of Tanjore became their arch enemies in the south.<ref name="yadgir">Kamath (2001), pp100-103</ref>

In conclusion, the rise of Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta had a great impact on India, even on India's north. Sulaiman (851), Al Masudi (944) and Ibn Khurdadba (912) wrote that their empire was the largest in contemporary India and Sulaiman further called it one among the four great contemporary empires of the world.<ref name="contemp">Reu (1933), p39-41</ref><ref name="bal">Keay (2000), p200</ref><ref name="Imperial">Kamath (2001), p94</ref> Some historians have called these times an "Age of Imperial Kannauj". Since the Rashtrakutas successfully captured Kannauj, levied tribute on its rulers and presented themselves as masters of North India,  the era could also be called the "Age of Imperial Karnataka".<ref name="Imperial"/>  During their political expansion into central and northern India in the eighth  to the tenth centuries, the Rashtrakutas or their relatives created several kingdoms that either ruled during the reign of the parent empire or continued to rule for centuries after the its fall or came to power much later. Well known among these were the Rashtrakutas of [[Gujarat]] (757-888),<ref name="guj">Reu (1933), p93</ref> the Rattas of [[Saundatti]] (875-1230) in modern Karnataka,<ref name="kar">Reu (1933), p100</ref> the Gahadavalas of Kannauj (1068-1223),<ref name="gaha">Reu (1933), p113</ref> the Rashtrakutas of [[Rajasthan]] (known as Rajputana) and ruling from Hastikundi or Hathundi (893-996),<ref name="has">Reu (1933), p110</ref> Dahal (near [[Jabalpur]]),<ref name="Dah">Jain (2001), pp67-75</ref> Mandore (near [[Jodhpur]]), the [[Rathore]]s of Dhanop,<ref name="dhan">Reu (1933), p112</ref> Rashtraudha dynasty of Mayuragiri in modern Maharashtra<ref name="mayur">De Bruyne (1968)</ref> and Rashtrakutas of Kannauj.<ref name="kannau">Majumdar (1966), pp50-51</ref>

==Administration==
{{Rashtrakuta Manyakheta Kings Infobox}}
Inscriptions and other literary records show the Rashtrakutas  selected the crown prince based on heredity. The crown did not always pass on to the eldest son. Abilities were considered more important than age and chronology of birth, as exemplified by the crowning of Govinda III who was the third son of king Dhruva Dharavarsha. The most important position under the king was the Chief Minister (''Mahasandhivigrahi'') whose position came with five insignia commensurate with his position namely, a flag, a conch, a fan, a white umbrella, a large drum and five musical instruments called ''Panchamahashabdas''. Under him was the commander (''Dandanayaka''), the foreign minister (''Mahakshapataladhikrita'') and a prime minister (''Mahamatya'' or ''Purnamathya''), all of whom were usually associated with one of the feudatory kings and must have held a position in government equivalent to a premier.<ref name="archive">whose main responsibility was to draft and maintain inscriptions or ''Shasanas'' as would an archivist. (Altekar in Kamath (2001), p85</ref> A ''Mahasamantha'' was a feudatory or   higher ranking regal officer. All cabinet ministers were well versed in political science (''Rajneeti'') and possessed military training. There were cases where woman supervised significant areas as when Revakanimaddi, daughter of Amoghavarsha I, administered Edathore ''Vishaya''.

The kingdom was divided into ''Mandala'' or ''Rashtras'' (provinces). A ''Rashtra'' was ruled by a Rashtrapathi who on occasion  was the emperor himself. Amoghavarsha I's empire had sixteen ''Rashtras''. Under a ''Rashtra'' was a ''Vishaya'' (district) overseen by a Vishayapathi. Trusted ministers sometimes ruled more than a ''Rashtra''. For example, Bankesha, a commander of Amoghavarsha I  headed [[Banavasi]]-12000, Belvola-300, Puligere-300, Kunduru-500 and Kundarge-70, the suffix designating the number of villages in that territory. Below the ''Vishaya'' was the  ''Nadu'' looked after by the Nadugowda or Nadugavunda; sometimes there were two such officials, one assuming the position through heredity and another appointed centrally. The lowest division was a ''Grama'' or village administered by a ''Gramapathi'' or ''Prabhu Gavunda''.<ref name="mandala">Kamath (2001), p86</ref> 

The Rashtrakuta army consisted of a large infantry, numerous horseman, and many elephants. A standing army was always ready for war in a cantonment (''Sthirabhuta Kataka'') in the regal capital of Manyakheta. Large armies were also maintained by the feudatory kings who were expected to contribute to the defense of the empire in case of war. Chieftains and all the officials also served as commanders whose postings were transferable if the need arose.<ref name="army">From the notes of Al Masudi (Kamath 2001, p88)</ref>

The Rashtrakutas issued coins (minted in an ''Akkashale'') such as ''Suvarna'', ''Drammas'' in silver and gold weighing 65&nbsp;[[Grain (measure)|grains]], ''Kalanju'' weighing 48&nbsp;grains, ''Gadyanaka'' weighing 96&nbsp;grains, ''Kasu'' weighing 15&nbsp;grains, ''Manjati'' with 2.5&nbsp;grains and ''Akkam'' of 1.25&nbsp;grain.<ref name="coins">Kamath (2001), p88</ref>

The Rashtrakuta economy was sustained by  its natural and agricultural produce, its manufacturing revenues and moneys gained from its conquests. Cotton was the chief crop of the regions of southern Gujarat, [[Khandesh]] and Berar. Minnagar, Gujarat, [[Ujjain]], [[Paithan]] and Tagara  were important centres of textile industry. [[Muslin]] cloth were manufactured in Paithan and [[Warangal]]. The cotton yarn and cloth was exported from [[Bharuch|Bharoch]].  White [[Calico (textile)|calicos]] were manufactured in Burhanpur and Berar and exported to Persia, Turkey, Polland, Arabia and Cairo.<ref name="trade">Altekar (1934), p356</ref> The Konkan region, ruled by the feudatory Silharas, produced large quantities of [[betel]] leaves, coconut and rice while the lush forests of Mysore, ruled by the feudatory [[Gangas]], produced such woods as sandal, timber, teak and ebony. Incense and perfumes were exported from the ports of [[Thane|Thana]] and Saimur.<ref name="trade1"/> 

The Deccan soil, though not as fertile as that of the Gangetic plains, was rich in minerals. The copper mines of [[Cudappah]], [[Bellary]], Chanda, Buldhana, Narsingpur, [[Ahmadnagar]], Bijapur and [[Dharwar]] were an important source of income and played an important role in the economy.<ref name="trade2">Altekar (1934), p355</ref> Diamonds were mined in Cudappah, Bellary, [[Kurnool]] and [[Golconda]]; the capital Manyakheta and Devagiri were important diamond and jewellery trading centres.  The leather industry and tanning flourished in Gujarat and some regions of northern Maharashtra. Mysore with its vast elephant herds was important for the ivory industry.<ref name="trade3">From notes of Periplus, Al Idrisi and Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p357)</ref> 

The Rashtrakuta empire controlled  most of the western sea board of the subcontinent which facilitated its maritime trade.<ref name="trade1">Altekar (1934), p354</ref> The Gujarat branch of the empire earned a significant income from the port of Bharoch, one of the most prominent ports in the world at that time.<ref name="trade4">Altekar (1934), p358</ref> The empire's chief exports were cotton yarn, cotton cloth, muslins, hides, mats, indigo, incense, perfumes, [[betel nut]]s, coconuts, sandal, teak, timber, sesame oil and ivory. Its major imports were pearls, gold, dates from Arabia, slaves, [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] wines, tin, lead, [[topaz]], [[storax]], sweet clover, flint glass, [[antimony]], gold and silver coins, singing boys and girls (for the entertainment of the royalty) from other lands. Trading in horses was an important and profitable business, monopolised  the Arabs and some local merchants.<ref name="trade5">Altekar (1934), p358-359</ref> The Rashtrakuta government levied a shipping tax of one golden ''Gadyanaka'' on all foreign vessels embarking to any other ports and a fee of one silver ''Ctharna'' ( a coin) on  vessels travelling locally.<ref name="trade21">Altekar (1934), p230</ref> 

Artists and craftsman operated as corporations (guilds) rather than as individual busineses. Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A [[Saundatti]] inscription refers to an assemblage of all the people of a district headed by the guilds of the region.<ref name="trade7">Altekar (1934), p368</ref> Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.<ref name="trade9">Altekar (1934), p370-371</ref> 

The government's income came from five principle sources: regular taxes, occasional taxes, fines, income taxes, miscellaneous taxes and tributes from feudatories.<ref name="trade10">Altekar (1934), p223</ref> An emergency tax was imposed occasionally and were applicable when the kingdom was under duress, such as when it  faced natural calamities, or  was preparing for war  or overcoming war's ravages. Income tax included taxes on [[crown land]], wasteland, specific types of trees considered valuable to economy, mines, salt, treasures unearthed by prospectors.<ref name="trade11">Altekar (1934), p213</ref> Additionally, customary presents  were give to the king or royal officers on such  festive occasions as marriage or the birth of a son.<ref name="trade23">From the Davangere inscription of Santivarma of Banavasi-12000 province (Altekar 1934, p234</ref> 

The king determined the tax levels based on need and circumstances in the kingdom while ensuring that an undue burden was not placed on the peasants.<ref name="trade14">From the writings of Chandesvara (Altekar 1934, p216)</ref> The land owner or tenant payed a variety of taxes, including land taxes, produce taxes and payment of the overhead for maintenance of the Gavunda (village head). Land taxes were varied, based on type of land, its produce and situation and ranged from 8% to 16%.  A Banavasi inscription of 941 mentions reassessment of land tax due to the drying up of an old irrigation canal in the region.<ref name="trade15"/> The land tax may have been as high as 20% to pay for expenses of a military frequently at war.<ref name="trade16">From the notes of Al Idrisi (Altekar (1934), p223</ref> In most of the kingdom, land taxes were paid in goods and services and rarely was cash accepted.<ref name="trade18">From the Begumra plates of Krishna II (Altekar 1934, p227</ref> A portion of all taxes earned by the government (usually 15%) was returned to the villages for maintenance.<ref name="trade15">Altekar (1934), p222</ref>

Taxes were levied on artisans such as potters, sheep herders, weavers, oilmen, shopkeepers, stall owners, brewers and gardeners. Taxes on perishable items such as fish, meat, honey, medicine, fruits and essentials like fuel was as high as 16%.<ref name="trade21">Altekar (1934), p230</ref> Taxes on salt and minerals were mandatory although the empire did not claim sole ownership of mines, implying that private  mineral prospecting and  the quarrying business may have been active.<ref name="trade26">Altekar (1934), p242</ref> The state claimed all such properties whose deceased legal owner had no immediate family to make an inheritance claim.<ref name="trade27"> From the writings of Somadeva (Altekar 1934, p244)</ref> Under miscellaneous taxes were ferry and house taxes. Only Brahmins and their temple institutions were taxed at a lower rate.<ref name="trade22">From the Hebbal inscriptions and Torkhede inscriptions of Govinda III (Altekar 1934, p232</ref>

===Religion===
The Rashtrakutas kings supported the popular religions of the day in the traditional spirit of religious tolerance.<ref name="tole">"Wide and sympathetic tolerance" in general characterised the Rashtrakuta rule (Altekar in Kamath 2001, p92)</ref> Scholars have offered various arguments regarding which specific religion  the Rashtrakutas favoured, basing their evidence on [[Indian inscriptions|inscriptions]], coins and contemporary literature. Some claim the Rashtrakutas were inclined towards [[Jainism]] since many of the scholars who flourished in their courts and wrote in [[Sanskrit]], [[Kannada]] and a few in [[Apabhramsha]] and [[Prakrit]] were Jains.<ref name="writer">Kamath (2001), p92</ref> The Rashtrakutas built well known Jain temples   at locations such as Lokapura in [[Bagalkot district]] and their loyal feudatory, the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]], built Jain monuments at [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Kambadahalli]]. Scholars have suggested that Jainism was a principal religion at the very heart of the empire, modern Karnataka, accounting for a more than 30% of the population and dominating the culture of the region.<ref name="population">Altekar in Kamath (2001), p92</ref> King Amoghavarsha I was a disciple of the Jain [[acharya]] [[Jinasena]] and wrote in his religious writing, ''Prashnottara Ratnamalika'', "having bowed to Varaddhamana ([[Mahavira]]), I write Prashnottara Ratnamalika". The mathematician [[Mahavira (mathematician)|Mahaviracharya]] wrote in his ''Ganita Sarasangraha'', "The subjects under Amoghavarsha are happy and the land yields plenty of grain. May the kingdom of King Nripatunga Amoghavarsha, follower of Jainism ever increase far and wide." Amoghavarsha may have taken up Jainsim in his old age.<ref name="grain">Reu (1933), p36</ref><ref name="grain1">The Vaishnava Rashtrakutas patronised Jainsim (Kamath 2001, p92)</ref>  

However, most evidence shows the Rashtrakuta kings were ardent [[Hindu]]s, followers of the [[Shaivism|Shaiva]], [[Vaishnava]] and [[Shaktism|Shakta]] faiths. Almost all of their inscriptions begin with an invocation of [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]]. The [[Sanjan (Gujarat)|Sanjan]] inscriptions tell of King Amoghavarsha I sacrificing a finger from his left hand at the [[Lakshmi]] temple at [[Kolhapur]] to avert a calamity in his kingdom. King Dantidurga performed the ''Hiranyagarbha'' (horse sacrifice) and the Sanjan and [[Khambhat|Cambay]] plates of King [[Govinda IV]] mention [[Brahmin]]s performing such rituals as ''Rajasuya'', ''Vajapeya'' and ''Agnishtoma''.<ref name="ritual">Kamath (2001), p91</ref> An early [[copper plate grant]] of King Dantidurga (753) shows an image of Lord Shiva and the coins of his successor, King Krishna I (768), bear the legend ''Parama Maheshwara'' (another name for Shiva). The kings' titles such as ''Veeranarayana'' showed their Vaishnava leanings. Their flag had the sign  of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, perhaps copied from the Badami Chalukyas.<ref name="ganga">Reu (1933), p34</ref> The famous Kailasnatha temple at Ellora and other rock-cut caves attributed to them show that the Hinduism was flourishing.<ref name="rock">Kamath  (2001), p91</ref> Their family deity was a goddess by name ''Latana'' (also known as ''Rashtrashyena'' , ''Manasa'' ''Vindyavasini'') who took the form of a falcon to save the kingdom.<ref name="falcon'>Reu (1933, p34</ref> They built temples with iconification and ornamentation that satisfied the needs of different faiths. The temple at Salotgi was meant for followers of Shiva and Vishnu and the temple at Kargudri was meant for worshipers of Shankara, Vishnu and Bhaskara ([[Surya]], the sun God).<ref name="sun">Kamath (2001), p92</ref> 

In short, the Rashtrakuta rule was tolerant to multiple popular religions, [[Jainism]], [[Vaishnava]]ism and [[Shaivism]]. [[Buddhism]] too found support and was popular in places such as [[Dambal]] and [[Balligavi]], although it had declined significantly by this time.<ref name="buddha">The Rise and Decline of Buddhism in India, K.L. Hazara, Munshiram Manoharlal, 1995, pp288-294</ref> The decline of [[Buddhism]] in South India began in the 8th century with the spread of [[Adi Shankara]]'s [[Advaita]] philosophy.<ref name="decrease">A 16th century Buddhist work by Lama Taranatha speaks disparagingly of Shankaracharya as close parallels in some beliefs of Shankaracharya with Buddhist philosophy was not viewed favourably by Buddhist writers (Thapar 2003, pp 349-350, 397)</ref> [[Islamic]] contact with South India began as early as the 7th century, a result of trade between the Southern kingdoms and  [[Arab]] lands. [[Jumma]] [[Masjid]]s existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century<ref name="jumma">From the notes of 10th century Arab writer Al-Ishtakhri (Sastri 1955, p396)</ref> and many Muslims lived and mosques flourished on the  coasts, specifically in towns such as [[Kayalpattanam]] and [[Nagore]]. Muslim settlers married local women; their children were known as [[Mappila]]s (''Moplahs'') and were actively involved in horse trading and manning shipping fleets.<ref name="jumma1">From the notes of Masudi (916) (Sastri 1955, p396)</ref>

Chronicles mention more [[caste]]s than the four commonly known castes in the Hindu social system, some as many as seven castes.<ref name="caste">From the notes of Magasthenesis and Strabo from Greece and Ibn Khurdadba and Al Idrisi from Arabia (Altekar 1934, p317)</ref> One traveller's account mentions sixteen castes including the four basic castes of [[Brahmins]], [[Kshatriya]], [[Vaishya]] and [[Untouchable|Chandalas]].<ref name="caste1">From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p317)</ref> The ''Zakaya'' or ''Lahud'' caste consisted of communities specialising in dance and acrobatics.<ref name="caste3">Altekar (1934), p318</ref>  People in the professions of sailing, hunting, weaving, cobblery, basket making and fishing belonged to  specific castes or subcastes. The ''Antyajas'' caste  provided many menial services to the wealthy. Brahmins  enjoyed the highest status in Rashtrakuta society; only those Kshatriyas in the ''Sat-Kshatriya'' sub-caste (noble Kshatriyas) were higher in status.<ref name="caste4">From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p324)</ref><ref name="caste10">From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, pp330-331)</ref>

The careers of Brahmins usually  related to education, the judiciary, astrology, mathematics, poetry and philosophy<ref name="caste6">From the notes of Alberuni, Altekar (1934) p325</ref>  or the occupation of hereditary administrative posts.<ref name="caste7">From the notes of Abuzaid (Altekar 1934, p325)</ref> Also Brahmins increasingly practiced  non-Brahminical professions (agriculture, trade in betel nuts and martial posts).<ref name="caste8">From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p326)</ref> Capital punishment, although widespread, was not given to the royal Kshatriya sub-castes or to Brahmins found guilty of heinous crimes as the killing of a Brahmin in medieval Hindu India was itself considered a heinous crime. As an alternate punishment to enforce the law a Brahmin's right hand and left foot was severed, leaving that person disabled.<ref name="caste9">Altekar (1934), p329</ref> 

By the ninth century, kings from all the four castes had occupied the highest seat in the monarchical system in Hindu India.<ref name="caste11">From the notes of Yuan Chwang , Altekar (1934), p331</ref> Admitting Kshatriyas to [[Vedic]] schools along with Brahmins was customary, but  the children of the Vaishya and [[Shudra]] castes were not allowed.  Landownership by people of all castes is recorded in inscriptions<ref name="caste12">From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p332, p334)</ref> Intercaste marriages in the higher castes were only between highly placed Kshatriya girls and Brahmin boys,<ref name="caste15">From the notes of Ibn Khurdadba (Altekar 1934, p337)</ref> but was relatively frequent among other castes.<ref name="caste16">From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p337)</ref> Intercaste functions were rare and dining together between people of various castes was avoided.<ref name="caste17">From the notes of Al Masudi and Al Idrisi (Altekar 1934, p339)</ref>

Among Brahmins, boys married at or below 16 years of age and  the brides chosen for them were 12 or younger.  This age policy was not strictly followed by other castes.<ref name="caste20">From the notes of Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p342)</ref>  [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] (a custom in which a dead man's widow tended to [[Self-immolation|immolate]] herself on her husband<U+2019>s funeral [[pyre]]) was practiced but  the few examples noted in inscriptions  were mostly in the royal families.<ref name="caste22">From the notes of Sulaiman and Alberuni (Altekar 1934, p343)</ref> The system of shaving the heads of widows was infrequent as epigraphs note that widows were allowed to grow their hair but decorating it was discouraged.<ref name="caste23">Altekar (1934), p345</ref> The remarriage of a widow was rare among the upper castes and more accepted among the lower castes.<ref name="caste24">From the notes of Ibn Khurdadba (Altekar 1934, p346)</ref>

In the general population men wore two simple pieces of cloth, a loose garment on top and a garment worn like a ''[[dhoti]]'' for the lower part of the body. Only kings could wear [[turban]]s, a practice that spread to the masses much later.<ref name="caste26">Altekar (1934), p349</ref> Dancing was a popular entertainment and inscriptions speak of royal women being charmed by dancers, both male and female, in the king's palace. [[Devadasi]]s (girls were "married" to a deity or temple) were often present in temples.<ref name="caste27">Altekar (1934), p350</ref> Other recreational activities included attending animal fights of the same or  different species.

[[Kannada language|Kannada]] became more prominent as a literary language during the Rashtrakuta rule with its script and literature showing remarkable growth, dignity and productivity.<ref name="Jaina_literature"/><ref name="language2"/><ref name="Kannada2">{{cite web|title=The Rashrakutas|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm|author=Arthikaje, Mangalore|publisher=1998-00 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2006-12-20}}</ref><ref name="Jaina_literature2"/> This period effectively marked the end of the classical Prakrit and Sanskrit era. Court poets and royalty created eminent works in Kannada and Sanskrit that spanned such literary forms as prose, poetry, rhetoric, Hindu epics and life history of Jain tirthankaras. Famous scholars wrote on secular subjects such as mathematics. 

''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' (850) by King Amoghavarsha I is the earliest available book on rhetoric and poetics in Kannada,<ref name="rhetoric">Kamath (2001), p90</ref><ref name="rhetoric1">Reu (1933), p38</ref> though it is evident from this book that other styles of Kannada literature and poetry had already existed in previous centuries.<ref name="amog">The ''Bedande'' and ''Chattana'' type of composition (Narasimhacharya 1988, p12)</ref> ''Kavirajamarga'' is a guide to poets (''Kavishiksha'') that aims to standardize these various styles.

[[Adikavi Pampa]], widely regarded as one of the greatest Kannada writers, became famous for ''[[Adipurana]]'' (941). Written in champu (mixed prose-verse style) style, it is the life history of the first [[Jain]] [[tirthankara]] [[Lord Rishabha|Rishabhadeva]]. Pampa's other notable work was ''Vikramarjuna Vijaya'' (941), the author's version of the Hindu epic, [[Mahabharata]], with [[Arjuna]] as the hero.<ref name="bharata">Sastri (1955), p356</ref> Also called ''Pampa Bharata'', it  praises the writer's patron, King Chalukya Arikeseri of [[Vemulavada]] (a Rashtrakuta feudatory), comparing the king's virtues favorably to those of Arjuna. Pampa demonstrates such a command of classical Kannada that scholars over the centuries have written many interpretations of his work.<ref name="earlyprose2"/> 

Another great writer in Kannada was [[Sri Ponna]], patronised by King Krishna III and famed for  his description of the life of the 16th Jain tirthankara Shantinatha entitled ''Santipurana''.  He earned the title ''Ubhaya Kavichakravathi'' (supreme poet in two languages) for his command over both Kannada and Sanskrit. His other writings in Kannada were ''Bhuvanaika-karamabhyudaya'', ''Jinaksaramale'' and ''Gatapratiagata''.<ref name="ubhaya">Narasimhacharya (1988, p18</ref><ref name="rhetoric"/> Adikavi Pampa, Sri Ponna are called "gems of Kannada literature".<ref name="bharata"/> 

Prose works in [[Sanskrit]] was prolific during this era as well.<ref name="Jaina_literature"/> Important mathematical theories and axioms were postulated by [[Mahavira (mathematician)|Mahaviracharya]], a native of [[Gulbarga]], who belonged to the Karnataka mathematical tradition and was patronised by King Amoghavarsha I.<ref name="maths">Kamath (2001), p89</ref> His greatest contribution was ''Ganitasarasangraha'', a writing in 9 chapters. Somadevasuri of 950 wrote in the court of Arikesari II, a feudatory of Rashtrakuta [[Krishna III]] in [[Vemulavada]]. He was the author of ''Yasastilaka champu'', ''Nitivakyamrita'' and other writings. The main aim of the ''champu'' writing was to propagate Jain tenets and ethics. The second writing reviews the subject matter of ''Arthasastra'' from the standpoint of Jain morals in a clear and pithy manner.<ref name="artha">Sastri (1955), p314</ref>

Trivikrama was a noted scholar in the court of King Indra III. His classics were ''Nalachampu'' (915), the earliest in champu style in Sanskrit, ''Damayanti Katha'', ''Madalasachampu'' and Begumra plates. Legend has it that Goddess [[Saraswati]] helped him in his effort to compete with a rival in the kings court.<ref name="tri">Sastri (1955), p314</ref> [[Jinasena]] was the spiritual preceptor and [[guru]] of [[Amoghavarsha I]]. A theologian, his contributions are ''Dhavala'' and ''Jayadhavala'' (written with another theologian [[Virasena]]).

The Rashtrakutas contributed much to the architectural heritage  of the Deccan. 
The Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, located in present day Maharashtra. The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the sixth century in rocky areas also occupied by Jains monks whose structural details show [[Pandyan]] influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus only became feasible later.<ref name="rockcut">{{cite book

===Language===
With the ending of the [[Gupta Dynasty]] in northern India in the early sixth century, major changes began taking place in the Deccan south of the Vindyas and in the southern regions of India. These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural. The royal courts of  peninsular India (outside of [[Tamilakam]]) interfaced between the increasing use of the local Kannada language  and the expanding Sanskritic culture. Inscriptions, including those that were bilingual, demonstrate the use of Kannada as the administrative language in conjunction with Sanskrit. Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land.<ref name="grant">Thapar (2002), pp393-4</ref> The local language formed the ''desi'' (popular) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more ''marga'' (formal). Educational institutions and places of higher learning (''ghatikas'') taught in Sanskrit, the language of the learned Brahmins, while Kannada increasingly became the speech of personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity. The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the [[devotional movements]] of later centuries.<ref name="rich">Thapar (2002), p396</ref>

Contemporaneous literature and inscriptions show that Kannada was not only popular in the modern Karnataka region but the linguistic change had spread further north into present day southern Maharashtra and to the northern Deccan by the eighth century.<ref name="change">Vaidya (1924), p170</ref>  Kavirajamarga, the work on poetics, refers to the entire region between the Kaveri River and the Godavari River as "Kannada country".<ref name="country">Sastri (1955), p355</ref> Higher education in Sanskrit included the subjects of [[Veda]], ''Vyakarana'' (grammar), ''Jyotisha'' (astronomy and astrology), ''Sahitya'' (literature), ''Mimansa'' (Exegesis), ''Dharmashastra'' (law), ''Puranas'' (ritual), and ''Nyaya'' (logic). An examination of inscriptions from this period shows that the ''Kavya'' (classical) style of writing was popular. The awareness of the merits and defects in inscriptions by the archivists indicates that even they , though mediocre poets, had studied standard classical literature in Sanskrit.<ref name="defect">Altekar (1934), p404</ref> An inscription in Kannada by King [[Krishna III]], written in a poetic Kanda metre, has been found as far away as [[Jabalpur]] in modern [[Madhya Pradesh]].<ref name ="kanda">Kamath (2001), p73</ref> Kavirajamarga, a work on poetics in Kannada by Amoghavarsha I, shows that the study of poetry was popular in the Deccan during this time. Trivikrama's Sanskrit writing, ''Nalachampu'', is perhaps the earliest in the ''champu'' style from the Deccan.<ref name="vikram">Altekar (1934), p408</ref>
