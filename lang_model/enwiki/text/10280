'''Herman Bernstein''' (September 21, 1876 <U+2013> August 31, 1935) was an [[United States|American]] journalist, poet, novelist, playwright, translator, Jewish activist, and diplomat.

Herman Bernstein was born in [[Kudirkos Naumiestis|Vladislavov]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: <U+0412><U+043B><U+0430><U+0434><U+0438><U+0441><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432><U+043E><U+0432>, [[German language|German]]: Neustadt-Schirwindt, [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]: Naishtot), at that time on the [[Russia|Russo]]-[[Germany|German]] border, (today in [[Lithuania]]) to David and Marie Bernstein. In 1893, he emigrated to the United States, where he completed his education and married Sophie Friedman on December 31, 1901.

== Family history and emigration ==
Herman's parents were David and Marie Elsohn Bernstein.  His brother was a writer, Hillel, or Harry Bernstein.  When he was 6 years old, his parents moved to [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10915-moghilef-mohilev Mohilev], on the [[Dnieper river]] in present day [[Belarus]].<ref>"Herman Bernstein Dies in Berkshires", New York Times, Sept. 1, 1935</ref>
Herman emigrated to the United States in 1893 first arriving in Chicago. He married Sophie Friedman in 1901.  They had four children together, Violet Bernstein Willheim, Hilda Bernstein Gitlin, Dorothy Bernstein Nash, and David Bernstein.<ref>"Biographical Note," Papers of Herman Bernstein at the Center for Jewish History, NY (http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=109125)</ref>

== Journalism ==
Bernstein was prolific as a journalist throughout his life, with his first stories published in 1900. He contributed, among others, to the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'', and ''[[Ainslee's Magazine]]''. He was the founder and editor of ''[[The New London Day]]'' and an editor of the ''[[The Jewish Tribune]]'' and of the ''[[Jewish Daily Bulletin]]''. As a correspondent of the ''[[New York Times]]'', Bernstein regularly travelled to Europe. In 1915, he went to Europe to document the situation of Jews in the war zones. 

Bernstein covered the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917 for the ''[[New York Herald]]'', which led him to both [[Siberia]] and [[Japan]] with the [[American Expeditionary Forces]]. He covered the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919 for the same newspaper.

Victoria Woeste writes: 
:Bernstein, a novelist and poet of some repute, won acclaim for his accomplishments in investigative journalsim in the 1910s. He was driven 'to lay bare the operations of Russian totalitarianism, whether Czarist or Bolshevist, especially in so far as it affected the fate of Russian Jews.' His reporting revealed 'the involvement of the Russian secret police in the case of Mendel Beilis, the Jew wrongfully accused of the ritual murder of a gentile boy' in 1911, and he also documented social and political conditions in Russia before and after the Communist Revolution.<ref>Victoria Woeste, ''Henry Ford's War on Jews and the Legal Battle Against Hate Speech (Stanford University Press, 2012), pp.113-14</ref>

Bernstein later translated Beilis's ''Story of My Sufferings'' (see translations, below).  In the 1920s Bernstein wrote for the [[New York American]] and the [[Brooklyn Eagle]], often reporting from Europe and writing frequently about Russia.<ref>"Biographical Note," Papers of Herman Bernstein at the Center for Jewish History, NY (http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=109125#ser6sub16)</ref>

== Secret Correspondence Between the Kaiser and the Tsar ==
In 1918, Bernstein revealed a secret correspondence  between [[Tsar Nicholas II]] and [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] and published it in a book, ''[[The Willy-Nicky Correspondence]],'' published by Knopf with a foreword by [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Bernstein summarized the contents as follows:

:During my recent stay in Russia I learned that shortly after the Tsar had been deposed, a series of intimate, secret telegrams were discovered in the secret archives of Nicholas Romanoff at Tsarskoye Selo. . . The complete correspondence, consisting of sixty-five telegrams exchanged between the Emperors during the years 1904, 1905, 1906 and 1907, forms an amazing picture of international diplomacy of duplicity and violence, painted by the men responsible for the greatest war in the world's history. The documents, not intended for the eyes of even the Secretaries of State of the two Emperors, constitute the most remarkable indictment of the system of governments headed by these imperial correspondents.<ref>[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/William_II_German_Emperor_The_Willy_Nicky_correspo?id=sa8ZAAAAYAAJ&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImJvb2stc2E4WkFBQUFZQUFKIl0. The Willy-Nicky Correspondence at Google Play]</ref> 

He remarked that "the Kaiser is exposed as a master intriguer and Mephistophelian plotter for German domination of the world. The former Tsar is revealed as a capricious weakling, a characterless, colourless nonentity." The two, Bernstein wrote, <U+201C>both talked for peace and plotted against it.<U+201D>

== Interviews ==
Bernstein interviewed many of the most eminent people of his time, including [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Bernard Shaw]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Pope Benedict XV]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], [[Havelock Ellis]], [[Romain Rolland]], [[Albert Einstein]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]]. These interviews were gathered in several books, including ''With Master Minds: Interviews by Herman Bernstein'' and ''Celebrities of Our Times''.<ref>Herman Bernstein, ''With Master Minds: Interviews by Herman Bernstein'' (New York: Universal Series Publishing, 1913. Herman Bernstein, ''Celebrities of Our Time'' (New York: Joseph Lawren, 1924)</ref>

== Translations, Poetry, Plays, Short Stories ==
Bernstein translated a number of important literary works, by figures such as [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Leonid Andreyev]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[Ivan Turgenev]], from Russian to English.<ref>Such as Leonid Andreyev, ''Satan's Diary,'' trans. Herman Bernstein (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1920); Maxim Gorky, ''The Man Who Was Afraid (Foma Gordyeef),'' trans. Herman Bernstein (New York: 1905)</ref> His own plays ''The Mandarin''<ref>[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/9775/The-Mandarin Playbill at Playbill Vault]</ref> and ''The Right to Kill'',<ref>[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/12027/The-Right-to-Kill Playbill at Playbill Vault]</ref> were presented on Broadway. In addition, he published poems (including those collected in ''The Flight of Time and Other Poems''<ref>[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Herman_Bernstein_The_flight_of_time_and_other_poem?id=_to_AAAAYAAJ&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImJvb2stX3RvX0FBQUFZQUFKIl0. Text at Google Play]</ref> [1899]), short stories (including those collected in ''In the Gates of Israel: Stories of the Jews''<ref>[https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1_1OAAAAYAAJ&rdid=book-1_1OAAAAYAAJ&rdot=1 Text at Google Play]</ref> [1902]), and a novel (''Contrite Hearts'',<ref>[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Herman_Bernstein_Contrite_hearts?id=GdEOAAAAIAAJ&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImJvb2stR2RFT0FBQUFJQUFKIl0. Text at Google Play]</ref> 1903).

In 1915, Bernstein published a book, ''La Rekta Gibulo'', in the so-called universal language [[Esperanto]]. No one knows what it is about.

== Politics and Diplomacy ==
In the early 1910s, Bernstein advocated liberal immigration policies and was a member of the Democratic National Committee, working to elect Woodrow Wilson in 1912. 

Bernstein met [[Herbert Hoover]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] and supported his bid for the presidency in 1928. Soon thereafter, Bernstein published ''Herbert Hoover: The Man Who Brought America to The World''. In 1930 Hoover appointed Bernstein as the United States minister to [[Albania]], a position he held until 1933. During this appointment, he helped put into place several treaties between the U.S. and Albania, and received an award from [[King Zog]] for his service to Albania, the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of Skanderbeg]].<ref>"Biographical Note," Papers of Herman Bernstein at the Center for Jewish History, NY (http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=109125#ser6sub16)</ref>

== Refutation of the ''Protocols'' and Lawsuit Against Henry Ford ==
In 1921, responding to [[Henry Ford]]'s printing of 500,000 copies of the notorious anti-Semitic forgery [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] as well as a series of anti-Semitic articles under the title [[The International Jew]] in Ford's newspaper [[The Dearborn Independent]], Bernstein published the book [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/19200 History of a Lie], a demonstration of ''The Protocols''' spurious origins. 

:At the same time Ford was being lauded as an anti-Semite hero in Europe, he was confronted with another lawsuit in America. This one came from Herman Bernstein, the same man who had helped to expose ''The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion'' as a forgery. In the August 20, 1921 issue of the ''Independent'', Bernstein had been identified as the source . . . who revealed to Ford the supposed worldwide Jewish conspiracy. "He told me most of the things that I have printed," Ford claimed in the article, which labeled Bernstein "the messenger boy of international Jewry."<ref>''New York Times'', 19 August 1923, 2.</ref> An outraged Bernstein denied the allegations and, in 1923, sued Ford for $200,000. He told the press that he was doing a public service by allowing the American people to get a "true picture" of Ford's "diseased imagination."<ref>''New York Times'', 19 July 1923, 17.</ref><ref>Quotation is from Jonathan Logsdon, "Power, Ignorance, and Anti-Semitism: Henry Ford and His War on Jews," Hanover Review, 1999</ref>

Bernstein was represented by [[Samuel Untermeyer]]. The suit languished because Bernstein and his representatives were never able to serve Ford with a subpoena; Ford had many allies among the political and law enforcement officials of Michigan and elsewhere, as well as a large private security force. Bernstein and Untermeyer did, however, succeed in getting New York state officials to agree to impound any copies of ''The Independent'' that entered the state. The extent to which this was enforced is not clear.<ref>Victoria Woestke, ''Henry Ford's War on Jews and the Legal Battle Against Hate Speech,'' pp. 114-18</ref> 

Other libel suits against Ford were pursued by [[Louis Marshall]] and [[Aaron Sapiro]], though there was tension among these figures over which suit was most viable. In response to the suits, as well as the fear that the negative publicity was hurting automobile sales, Ford issued an 'Apology to Jews,' the sincerity of which is a matter of controversy.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,730744,00.html Time Magazine, July 18, 1927]</ref> These cases are significant in the history of the jurisprudence pertaining to [[group libel]] and [[hate speech]].<ref>[http://www.americanbarfoundation.org/news/345 Review at the American Bar Foundation]</ref>

In 1935, the year of Bernstein's death, as the Nazi Party consolidated power in Germany and revived ''The Protocols'' yet again - for example, requiring all German schoolchildren to read it - Bernstein published another and more elaborate refutation, ''The Truth About the 'Protocols of Zion' - A Complete Exposure.''<ref>Herman Bernstein, ''The Truth About the 'Protocols of Zion' - A Complete Exposure'' (New York: Covici Friede, 1935)</ref>

== Jewish Activism ==
Bernstein worked with organizations such as [[ORT]], the [[Central Relief Committee]], the [[American Jewish Relief Committee]], and the Joint Distribution Committee to improve conditions for Jews in Europe. He also served as secretary of the [[American Jewish Committee]], and as an officer of the [[Zionist Organization of America]]. Bernstein advocated the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine and wrote about the politics of the Middle East and the settlement of Palestine.<ref>Biographical Note, Papers of Herman Bernstein, Center for Jewish History, NY (http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=109125#ser6sub16)</ref>

== Correspondence ==
Herman Bernstein's correspondence, housed at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research at the Center for Jewish History in New York,<ref>http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=109125#ser1sub4</ref> includes letters to and from many of the most eminent people of that period in various walks of life, including [[Samuel Clemons]] ([[Mark Twain]]), [[Sholem Aleichem]], [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[William Howard Taft]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Max Nordau]], [[Louis Brandeis]], [[John D. Rockefeller]], [[Louis Marshall]], [[Israel Zangwill]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Arthur Brisbane]], [[Mordecai Kaplan]], [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]], [[Gifford Pinchot]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Franz Oppenheimer]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Warren G. Harding]], [[William Randolph Hearst]], [[Herbert Hoover]], [[Constantin Stanislavski]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Arthur Balfour]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Henry Ford]], [[Arthur Goldberg]], [[Adolph Ochs]], [[Romain Rolland]], [[Julius Rosenwald]], [[Benjamin Cardozo]],  [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], and [[Franklin Roosevelt]].
