The Russian [[battleship]] '''''Poltava''''' ({{lang-ru|<U+041F><U+043E><U+043B><U+0442><U+0430><U+0432><U+0430>}}) was one of three [[Petropavlovsk class battleship|''Petropavlovsk''-class]] [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the 1890s. The ship was transferred to the [[Russian Pacific Fleet|Pacific Squadron]] shortly after completion and based at [[L<U+00FC>shunkou District|Port Arthur]] from 1901. During the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904<U+2013>05, she participated in the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] and was heavily damaged during the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]]. She was sunk by Japanese artillery during the subsequent [[Siege of Port Arthur]] in December 1904, but was [[Marine salvage|raised]] by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] after the war and renamed ''Tango'' (<U+4E39><U+5F8C>).

During World War I, she bombarded German fortifications during the [[Siege of Tsingtao]]. The Japanese government sold ''Tango'' back to the Russians at their request in 1916. She was renamed ''Chesma'' (<U+0427><U+0435><U+0441><U+043C><U+0430>) as her former name had been given to a new ship. En route to the [[White Sea]], she joined an [[Allies of World War I|Allied force]] that [[Noemvriana|persuaded the Greek government to disarm their ships]]. Her crew declared for the [[Bolshevik]]s in October 1917, but made no effort to resist when the British decided to [[North Russia Intervention|intervene in the Russian Civil War]] in early 1918. In bad shape, the ship was used as a [[prison hulk]]. Abandoned by the British when they withdrew in 1919 and recaptured by the Bolsheviks, she was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1924.

== Description ==
''Poltava'' was {{convert|376|ft|m|1}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|70|ft|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|28|ft|3|in|m|1}}. Designed to displace {{convert|10960|LT|t|lk=in}}, she was over {{convert|500|LT|t}} overweight and displaced {{convert|11500|LT|t}} when completed. The ship was powered by two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]], built by the British firm of [[Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes]], each driving one shaft, using steam generated by 14 cylindrical [[fire-tube boiler]]s. The engines were rated at {{convert|10600|ihp|lk=in}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|16|kn|lk=in}}, but ''Poltava'' actually reached a speed of {{convert|16.29|kn}} from {{convert|11213|ihp}} during her [[sea trial]]s. She carried a maximum of {{convert|1050|LT|t}} of coal which allowed her to steam for {{convert|3750|lk=in|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. Her crew consisted of 26<U+2013>27 officers and 605<U+2013>625 enlisted men.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|pp=84<U+2013>85, 90}}

The ship's [[main battery]] consisted of four {{convert|12|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns mounted in two twin-[[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. Designed to fire one round per 90 seconds, the actual rate of fire was half that. The [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] consisted of twelve [[Canet guns|Canet]] {{convert|6|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF) gun]]s. Eight of these were mounted in four twin-gun [[wing turret]]s and the remaining guns were positioned in unprotected [[embrasure]]s on the sides of the hull [[amidships]]. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. These included a dozen QF {{convert|47|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s and twenty-eight {{convert|37|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} guns. She was also armed with six [[torpedo tube]]s, four {{convert|15|in|adj=on|0}} tubes above water and two {{convert|18|in|adj=on|0}} submerged tubes, all mounted on the [[broadside]]. She carried 50 [[Naval mine|mines]] to be used to protect her anchorage.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|pp=84, 88<U+2013>89}}

''Poltava'' was the first Russian battleship to use [[Krupp cemented armor]], from Germany. Her [[waterline]] [[belt armor|armor belt]] was {{convert|10|-|14.5|in|0}} thick. The Krupp armor of her main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of {{convert|10|in|mm|0}} and her secondary gun turrets were protected by {{convert|5|in|0}} of armor. The nickel steel armor of her protective [[deck (ship)|deck]]s ranged from {{convert|2|to|3|in|0}} in thickness and the sides of her [[conning tower]] were {{convert|9|in|0}} thick.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|pp=84<U+2013>85, 89<U+2013>90}}

== Construction and service ==
''Poltava'' was named for the victory at the 1709 [[Battle of Poltava]] when [[Peter the Great]] defeated King [[Charles XII of Sweden]].{{sfn|Silverstone|page=382}} Delayed by shortages of skilled workmen, design changes and late delivery of the main armament, the ship was [[Keel|laid down]] on 19 May 1892 at the [[Admiralty Shipyard|Galernii Island shipyard]] and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 6 November 1894. Her trials lasted from 1898 to 1899 and she was then briefly assigned to the [[Baltic Fleet]].{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|pp=84, 86, 90}} Together with her [[sister ship]] [[Russian battleship Sevastopol (1895)|''Sevastopol'']], ''Poltava'' had a radio installed in September 1900, the first ships in the Imperial Russian Navy to get such equipment. On 15 October the sisters set sail for Port Arthur and later had to unload much of their ammunition, coal and other stores to reduce their drafts enough to pass through the [[Suez Canal]]. ''Poltava'' arrived at Port Arthur on 12 April 1901, the day before her sister.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2008|p=53}}

===Battle of Port Arthur===
{{main|Battle of Port Arthur}}
[[File:Russian Battleship Poltava sunk in Port Arthur.jpg|thumb|left|A Japanese postcard showing ''Poltava'' partially submerged at Port Arthur]]
After the Japanese victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894<U+2013>95, both Russia and Japan had ambitions to control [[Manchuria]] and Korea which naturally caused problems between them. A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903 as promised. Japan had begun negotiations to reduce the tensions in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted this as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These caused the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable.{{sfn|Westwood|pages=15<U+2013>21}} The Pacific Squadron began [[wikt:moor|mooring]] in the outer harbor at night as tensions with Japan increased, in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|p=160}}

On the night of 8/9 February 1904, the IJN launched a [[Battle of Port Arthur|surprise attack]] on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur. ''Poltava'' was not hit by the initial attack by torpedo boats and [[sortie]]d the following morning when the [[Combined Fleet]], commanded by [[Vice Admiral]] [[T<U+014D>g<U+014D> Heihachir<U+014D>]], attacked. T<U+014D>g<U+014D> had expected the surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|Russian cruiser|Boyarin|1901|2}}, which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defenses. T<U+014D>g<U+014D> chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on|spell=in}} and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect.{{sfn|Forczyk|pages=41<U+2013>43}} ''Poltava'' was hit several times with little effect and only three men wounded. She fired 12 twelve-inch and 55 six-inch shells during the battle.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2008|p=53}}

''Poltava'' participated in the action of 13 April, when T<U+014D>g<U+014D> successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice Admiral [[Stepan Makarov]]'s [[flagship]], her sister {{ship|Russian battleship|Petropavlovsk|1897|2}}. When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships, he turned back for Port Arthur and his flagship struck a [[minefield]] laid by the Japanese the previous night. The ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. Emboldened by his success, T<U+014D>g<U+014D> resumed long-range bombardment missions, prompting the Russians to lay more minefields, which sank two of his battleships the following month.{{sfn|Forczyk|pages=45<U+2013>46}}

Rear Admiral [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]] became the new commander of the First Pacific Squadron and led a half-hearted attempt to reach [[Vladivostok]] on 23 June; intercepted by the Combined Fleet, he returned to Port Arthur without engaging the Japanese ships. ''Poltava'', together with cruisers and destroyers, sortied to bombard Japanese coast defense positions on 9 July and briefly engaged Japanese ships that intercepted her.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2008|p=54}} During the summer, the ship landed many of her 47&nbsp;mm and 37&nbsp;mm guns to reinforce the defenses of the port.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|p=163}}

===Battle of the Yellow Sea===
{{main|Battle of the Yellow Sea}}
On 10 August the Imperial Japanese Army, which had been slowly pushing south to Port Arthur, began an assault on the city's outer defenses. With their base now directly under attack, the First Pacific Squadron sortied in the morning, around 07:00, in an attempt to escape to Vladivostok. The Japanese fleet intercepted the Russian ships at 12:55 in what became the Battle of the Yellow Sea.{{sfn|Watts|p=21}}

''Poltava'' was sixth in the column of Russian ships when the Japanese engaged them, and from her position started to bombard {{ship|Japanese battleship|Asahi||2}} at around 14:45. The battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}}, the Japanese flagship, then fired several shots that hit ''Poltava'', causing the Russian squadron to drop back to support her. The Russians scored several hits on ''Mikasa'', including two by ''Poltava''. She also scored one hit on the [[armored cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Nisshin||2}}. Owing to the damage ''Mikasa'' had sustained, the Japanese fleet broke off the attack at around 15:20 and turned to starboard, opening the range. By 17:35 the Japanese were again closing on the Russian rear. ''Mikasa'' and three other battleships opened fire on ''Poltava'' and three armored cruisers, but problems with their turrets forced the Japanese battleships to break off the engagement. They returned at 18:30, with {{ship|Japanese battleship|Shikishima||2}} and ''Asahi'' firing on ''Poltava''. As the Russian fleet began to slip away, two 12-inch shells from ''Asahi'' penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}}, killing Vitgeft and the helmsman, severely wounding the [[captain (nautical)|captain]], and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn. Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft, the Russian line started to execute the same turn, causing all of the ships directly behind ''Tsesarevich'', including ''Poltava'', to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship. [[Rear Admiral]] Prince [[Pavel Ukhtomsky]], second in command of the squadron, signaled the other Russian ships to steam back to Port Arthur. The signal flags were only gradually recognized by ''Pobeda'', ''Sevastopol'', ''Pallada'' and ''Poltava'' and the other vessels took some time to re-form for the return voyage.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|p=163}}{{sfn|Forczyk|pp=49<U+2013>52}} ''Poltava'' was hit by 12 to 14 large-caliber shells during the battle that knocked out five of her 6-inch guns, as well as killing 12 crewmen and wounding 43.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2008|p=54}} ''Poltava'', along with ''Tsesarevich'' and [[Russian battleship Peresvet|''Peresvet'']], sustained hits at the waterline that crippled their maneuverability,  preventing the Russian squadron from fleeing to Vladivostok.{{sfn|Wilmott|p=90}}

===Siege of Port Arthur===
{{main|Siege of Port Arthur}}
Returning to Port Arthur on 11 August, the Russian squadron found the city still under siege by the [[Japanese Third Army]] led by [[Baron]] [[Nogi Maresuke]]. ''Poltava'' was hit on 18 August by four {{convert|4.7|in|adj=on}} shells, fired by a battery, that wounded six men.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2008|p=54}} The new squadron commander, Rear Admiral [[Robert N. Viren]], believed in reinforcing the landward defenses of the port and continued to strip guns, and sailors to man them, from his ships. By September ''Poltava'' had lost a total of three 6-inch, four 47&nbsp;mm and twenty-six 37&nbsp;mm guns.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|p=163}} That same month, she began bombarding Japanese positions; through November she fired one hundred ten 12-inch shells and an unknown number of 6-inch shells.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2008|p=54}}

In October the advancing Third Army began to bombard the harbor with 28-centimeter (11&nbsp;in) siege howitzers, firing at random. They hit Poltava twice on 7 October, though the shells only started fires.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2008|p=54}} On 5 December the Japanese captured [[203 Hill|203 Meter Hill]], a crucial position that overlooked the harbor and allowed them to direct their artillery at the Russian ships. ''Poltava'' was hit that same day by five shells, three of which penetrated the deck. One hit a torpedo room, and another burst in the aft 47&nbsp;mm magazine. That started a fire that could not be put out because the flooding system had been previously damaged and eventually ignited propellant charges in the adjacent 12-inch magazine. About a half hour after the hit, the magazine exploded and blew a hole in the ship's bottom that caused her to sink 45 minutes later in the shallow water.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|p=164}}<ref name=antiaircraft>{{cite journal|title=Effects of High-Angle Fire on Russian Ships at Port Arthur|journal=Journal of the United States Artillery|year=1906|volume=26|page=138|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dWkmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA133}}</ref>

=== Japanese career ===
[[File:Tango1908-1909.jpg|thumb|left|''Tango'' at anchor around 1909]]
Following the capitulation of Port Arthur in January 1905, Japanese engineers refloated ''Poltava'' on 22 July, and commissioned her as ''Tango'' a month later,{{sfn|Lengerer|p=52}} taking her name from the [[old provinces of Japan|ancient Japanese province]] of [[Tango Province|Tango]], now a part of [[Kyoto Prefecture]].{{sfn|Silverstone|p=337}} Classified as a 1st class battleship, she departed for [[Maizuru Naval Arsenal]] two days later and arrived on 29 August. Except for participating in the review of captured ships on 23 October 1905, she remained there under repair until November 1907. ''Tango'' then sailed to [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] to complete fitting out.{{sfn|Lengerer|p=52}}

The IJN made a number of changes to the ship as she was repaired. Her [[fighting top]] was removed{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|p=451}} and her boilers were replaced by 16 Miyabara [[water-tube boiler]]s. She retained her main guns, but their [[breech-loading weapon|breech]]es were replaced by Japanese-built ones.{{sfn|Lengerer|p=50}} Her secondary armament was replaced by Japanese-built guns;{{sfn|Jentschura, Jung & Mickel|p=19}} her light armament was revised to ten [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|QF 12-pounder 12 cwt]]<ref group=Note>"Cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> and four 37&nbsp;mm guns. Four [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] above water torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament. Her crew now numbered 668 officers and crewmen.{{sfn|Lengerer|p=52}}

''Tango'' joined the fleet in 1911{{sfn|Lengerer|p=52}} and was re-classified as a 1st class coast defense ship in 1912.{{sfn|Taras|p=24}} In 1913 she participated in the annual fleet maneuvers as part of the "enemy" force.{{sfn|Lengerer|p=52}} She was assigned to the 2nd Squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral [[Kato Sadakichi]], shortly after [[World War I]] began. The squadron was tasked to blockade the German-owned port of [[Tsingtao]], China, and to cooperate with the Imperial Japanese Army in capturing the city. ''Tango'' and the other ships of the squadron bombarded German fortifications throughout the siege until the Germans surrendered on 7 November.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2008|pp=54<U+2013>55}}

=== Return to Russia ===
[[File:Poltava-Chesma1921.jpg|left|thumb|''Chesma'' at anchor in the [[White Sea]], 1921]]
In 1916 the Russian government decided to reinforce its naval strength outside the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea]]s.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2008|p=55}} As Japan and Russia were allies during the war, the Japanese government sold ''Tango'' and some other ex-Russian warships back to Russia in March. The battleship arrived at Vladivostok on 2 April and was turned over to the Russians on either 3 or 4 April. Her former name had been given to the new [[dreadnought battleship]] [[Russian battleship Poltava (1911)|''Poltava'']], so ''Tango'' was renamed ''Chesma'',{{sfn|Lengerer|p=52}}{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|p=91}} after the 1770 [[Battle of Chesma]].{{sfn|Silverstone|p=374}} She departed Vladivostok on 2 July and arrived at [[Port Said]], Egypt, on 19 September.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|p=91}}

''Chesma'' joined the Allied fleet off [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] demanding the disarmament of the Greek fleet later that month and departed after the Greeks agreed to meet the Allied demands. Her machinery was overhauled at [[Birkenhead]] by [[Cammell Laird]], beginning on 5 December, and her main deck six-inch and 12-pounder guns were removed. In exchange she received four [[anti-aircraft gun]]s mounted on her superstructure. She arrived at [[Alexandrovsk, Murmansk Oblast|Aleksandrovsk]], a port in the [[Murmansk Oblast]], on 16 January 1917 and the political situation became very confused with the [[February Revolution]] shortly after her arrival.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2008|pp=55<U+2013>56}} She was assigned to the [[White Sea Fleet]] on 3 February.{{sfn|Lengerer|p=52}} Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October of the same year,{{sfn|Taras|p=24}} but made no effort to interfere with the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied landing]] at [[Murmansk]] in March 1918.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2008|p=56}} Although deemed "aground and unseaworthy" by the British shortly afterwards, they seized the ship and used her as a floating prison in April 1919 to house 40 Bolshevik prisoners. After the British withdrew, the abandoned ship was captured by the Red Army in March 1920 and incorporated into the Bolshevik White Sea Military Flotilla on 24 April. No longer of any military value, she was turned over to the port of [[Archangelsk]] on 16 June 1921 and stricken from the [[navy list|list of naval vessels]] on 3 July 1924, after which she was scrapped.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|p=91}}
