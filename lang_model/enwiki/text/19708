Solicitor James Lord is in love with Nellie. She tells him she is going away for a week with her friend May to Portsea where there are lots of nice boys. Nellie gets the dates wrong and goes a day early. When James finds out he worries she is cheating on him. His client Rouse comes in and says he is convinced his wife is cheating on him a man called Dane. They hire three private eyes, Hall, Ratchet and Moon, to keep an eye on women.

The bungling of these private investigators provides the film's slight humor. In the end, both men realize their wives are faithful and all's well that ends well.

Peter Fitzpatrick, biographer of F.W. Thring, later wrote that the film was "heavy-going":
<blockquote>The lack of action in many of its dialogue scenes is exacerbated by the static single-take camera work, and by an excessive concern with circumstantial realism that produces 'book-ends' of extended hellos and goodbyes in many scenes, and excruciatingly prolonged telephone calls in which phone numbers are always carefully enunciated and there are long pauses while the caller listens patiently to someone whom we cannot see or hear. And a lot of the conversation is stagey and stilted. Still... the film... [has] at least a period charm.<ref>Fitzpatrick p 146</ref></blockquote>
Fitzpatrick though the movie was partly redeemed by making fun of the absurdity of its male characters and use of external locations.<ref>Fitzpatrick p 148</ref>
