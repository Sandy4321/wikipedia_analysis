'''Edward Walter Solly''' ([[7 May]] [[1882]] - [[12 February]] [[1966]]) was an [[England|English]] [[cricketer]] who played eight [[first-class cricket|first-class]] games for [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] as a professional between 1903 and 1907.

Born in [[Eastry]], [[Kent]], Solly made his debut against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]] in early June 1903, taking a single wicket, that of [[Leonard Harper]]. That was his only appearance that season; the following summer he again played once, this time against [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]], taking two wickets and hitting his highest score, 43, from number ten in the order.

In 1905 Solly played two [[County Championship]] games with reasonable success: he took seven wickets [[bowling average|at 25.28]], including a career best of 3-25 against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]]. He played a single match the following year (against Oxford) and in 1907 appeared twice more in the Championship, claiming 3-66 in what proved to be his last innings' bowling, against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]].

He died in [[Wales]] at the age of 83, in [[Cefn Mably]], [[Glamorgan]].
