'''Kiev''', also spelled '''Kyiv''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: {{Audio|Kyiv.ogg|<U+041A><U+0438><U+0457><U+0432>}}, ''Kyyiv'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[<U+02C8>k<U+026A>jiw]}}; [[Russian language|Russian]]: {{Audio|ru-Kiev.ogg|<U+041A><U+0438><U+0301><U+0435><U+0432>}}, ''Kiyev''; see also [[Names of European cities in different languages: I-L#K|Cities' alternative names]]), is the [[capital city|capital]] and the largest city of [[Ukraine]], located in the north central part of the country on the [[Dnieper]] river. As of April, 2007 Kiev had about 2.7 million inhabitants by official estimates while some much higher unofficial estimates are often published.<ref name=population>The last to date [[Ukrainian census]] conducted on December 5, 2001, gave the population of Kiev as 2611.3 thousand ([http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/regions/reg_mkyiv/ Ukrcensus.gov.ua - Kyiv city] URL accessed on August 4, 2007), the last estimate by the municipal authorities dated April 2007 gives 2.7 million. Estimates based on the amount of bakery products sold in the city (thus including temporary visitors and commuters) give a minimum of 3.5 million.

Kiev is an important industrial, scientific, educational and cultural center of [[Eastern Europe]]. It is home to many high-tech industries, [[higher education]] institutions and world-famous historical landmarks. The city has an extensive infrastructure and highly developed system of [[public transport]], including the [[Kiev Metro]].

The name Kiev is said to derive from the name of [[Kyi]], one of four legendary founders of the city (brothers Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv and sister Lybid'). During [[History of Kiev|its history]], Kiev, one of the oldest cities in [[Eastern Europe]], passed through several stages of great prominence and relative obscurity. The city is believed to have been founded in the 5th century as a trading post in the land of [[Early East Slavs]]. It gradually acquired eminence as the center of the [[Rus' (people)|East Slavic civilization]], becoming in the tenth to twelfth centuries a political and cultural capital of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']], a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] East Slavic state. Completely destroyed during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]] in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. It was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbors: first the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], followed by [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom|Poland]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. The city prospered again during the Russian [[industrial revolution]] in the late 19th century. After the [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|turbulent period]] following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], from 1921 onwards Kiev was an important city of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], and, since 1934, its capital. During [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], the city again suffered significant damage, but quickly recovered in the post-war years remaining the third largest city of [[USSR]]. Following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Ukrainian independence]] of 1991, Kiev remained the capital of [[Ukraine]].

== Environment ==
=== Geography ===
[[Image:Kiev L7 20010914.jpg|thumb|left|[[Landsat 7]] image of Kiev and the Dnieper River]]
Kiev is located on both sides of the [[Dnieper River]], which flows south through the city towards the [[Black Sea]]. Its [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinates]] are {{coor dms |50|27|00|N|30|31|24|E|type:city(2600000)_scale:300000_region:ua}}. Geographically, Kiev belongs to the [[Polesia]] ecological zone (a part of the European mixed woods). However, the city's unique landscape distinguishes it from the surrounding region. The older right-bank (''western'') part of Kiev is represented by numerous woody hills, ravines and small rivers. It is a part of the larger Prydniprovska (''near-Dnieper'') upland adjoining the western bank of the Dnieper. The city expanded to the Dnieper's left-bank (''to the east'') only in the twentieth century. Significant areas of the Dnieper valley were artificially sand-deposited, and are protected by [[dam]]s.

The Dnieper River forms a branching system of [[tributary|tributaries]], isles, and harbors within the city limits. The city is adjoined by the mouth of the [[Desna River]] and the [[Kiev Reservoir]] in the north, and the [[Kaniv Reservoir]] in the south. Both the Dnieper and Desna rivers are [[navigation|navigable]] at Kiev, although regulated by the reservoir shipping locks and limited by winter freeze-over.

=== Climate ===

Kiev has a [[continental climate|continental humid]] [[climate]]<!---, although the area has become affected by the [[global warming|global climate change]] during recent decades{{fact}}--->. The warmest months are June, July, and August, with mean temperatures of 13.8 to 24.8 <U+00B0>C (56.9 to 76.7 <U+00B0>F). The coldest are December, January, and February, with mean temperatures of <U+2212>4.6 to -1.1 <U+00B0>C (23.7 to 30.0 <U+00B0>F). The highest ever temperature recorded in the city was 39.4 <U+00B0>C (103.0 <U+00B0>F) on [[31 July]] [[1936]]. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was -32.2 <U+00B0>C (-26.0 <U+00B0>F) on 7 & [[9 February]] [[1929]]. Snow cover usually lies from mid-November to the end of March, with the frost-free period lasting 180 days on average, but surpassing 200 days in recent years.<ref name="Beijing">[http://www.ebeijing.gov.cn/ying/t95212.htm Beijing official website] URL accessed on July 28, 2006</ref>

== History ==
{{main|History of Kiev}}

Kiev is one of the oldest and most important cities of [[Eastern Europe]] and has played a pivotal role in the development of the medieval [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] civilization as well as in the modern [[Ukraine|Ukrainian nation]]. 

Human settlement at the site of the present day city may have occurred as early as the fifth or the sixth century AD.<ref name=foundation> There are no known historical records as to the founding dates of the city. [http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-229526 Kiev] article in [[Encyclopedia Britannica]] states: "The village that became the modern city may have been founded as early as the 6th century AD." The [[Columbia Encyclopedia]] in [http://www.bartelby.com/65/ki/Kiev.html  Kiev] states: "It probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th cent."</ref> With the exact time of city foundation being hard to determine, May 1982 was chosen to celebrate the city's 1,500th anniversary. 

During the eighth and ninth centuries, Kiev was an outpost of the [[Khazar]] empire. Starting in the late ninth century Kiev was ruled by the [[Varangian]] nobility and became the nucleus of the [[Etymology of Rus and derivatives|Rus']] polity, whose [[Golden Age]] (eleventh to early twelfth centuries) has from the nineteenth century become referred to as [[Kievan Rus']]. In 1240 the [[Mongol invasion of Rus]] led by [[Batu Khan]] completely destroyed Kiev, an event that had a profound effect on the future of the city and the [[Culture of Ancient Rus|East Slavic civilization]]. At the time of the Mongol destruction, Kiev was reputed as one of the largest cities in the world, with a population exceeding one hundred thousand.

From 1362, the greatly diminished city and surrounding area, [[Battle on the Irpen' River|was conquered]] by [[Gediminas]] for the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. From 1569 the city was controlled by the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], as a capital of [[Kij<U+00F3>w Voivodeship]], transferred by then to the [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom|Polish Crown]]. In the 17th century, Kiev was transferred under rule of [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]]. In the [[Russian Empire]] Kiev was a primary Christian center, attracting pilgrims and the cradle of many of the empire's most important religious figures, but until the 19th century the city's commercial importance remained marginal.

[[Image:Ruined Kiev in WWII.jpg|thumb|Kiev, as seen during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]].]]
Kiev prospered again during the in the late nineteenth century [[industrial revolution]] in the [[Russian Empire]] when it became the third most important city of the Empire, the major center of commerce of its southwest. In the [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|turbulent period]] following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|1917 Russian Revolution]], Kiev became the capital of several [[Ukrainian People's Republic|short-lived Ukrainian states]] and was caught in the middle of several conflicts: [[World War I]], the [[Russian Civil War]], and the [[Polish-Soviet War]]. 

From 1921 the city was a part of [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], a founding republic of [[Soviet Union]]. Kiev was greatly affected by all the major processes that took place in Soviet Ukraine during the [[interbellum|interwar period]]: the 1920s [[Ukrainization]] as well as the migration of the rural [[Ukrainophone]] population made the recently [[Russophone]] city partly Ukrainian-speaking and propped up the development of the [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian cultural life]] in the city; the [[Industrialization in the USSR|Soviet Industrialization]] that started in end-1920s turned the city, a former center of commerce and religion, into a major industrial, technological and scientific center, the [[Holodomor|1932-1933 Great Famine]] devastated the part of the migrant population not registered for the ration cards, and the [[Stalin]]'s 1930s [[Great Purge]] almost eliminated the city's [[intelligentsia]] 

In 1934 Kiev became the capital of [[Ukrainian SSR|Soviet Ukraine]]. The city boomed again during the years of the Soviet industrialization as it population grew rapidly and many industrial giants were created. Some of which exist to this day.

In [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], the city again suffered significant damage, but quickly recovered in the post-war years, becoming once again the third most important city of the Soviet Union. The [[Chernobyl disaster|catastrophic accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] occurred only 100 km north of city. However the prevailing northward winds blew the most substantial radioactive debris away from the city. 

In the wake of the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]] was proclaimed in the city by the [[Ukrainian parliament]] on August 24, 1991. Kiev is the capital of independent [[Ukraine]].

== Government ==
{{main|Legal status and local government of Kiev}}
[[Image:Kievsovet.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kiev City Council]] building at the [[Khreshchatyk]] street.]]

The [[municipality]] of the city of Kiev has a unique legal status within Ukraine compared to the other [[subdivisions of Ukraine|administrative subdivisions of the country]]. The most significant difference is that the city is subordinated directly to the national-level branches of the [[Government of Ukraine]], skipping the [[oblast|provincial level authorities]] of [[Kiev Oblast]]. Additionally, the leading governmental position is held by a locally elected, rather than appointed, figure, the [[Mayor of Kiev]], and municipal institutions have a higher level of self governance than elsewhere in Ukraine.
[[Image:Kiev map english.png|thumb|The ten [[Subdivisions of Kiev|Formal raions of Kiev]].]]
=== Subdivisions ===
{{Main|Subdivisions of Kiev}}

  
Administratively, the city is divided into "[[raion]]s" ("districts"), which have their own locally elected governments with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. Presently, there are 10 raions. 

The Dnieper river naturally divides the city into the Right Bank and the [[Left Bank (Kiev)|Left Bank]] regions . The Right Bank, located on the west side of the river, contains the older portions of the city.

Kiev is further informally divided into historical or territorial neighborhoods, each housing from about 5,000 to 100,000 inhabitants.

As of the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|All-Ukrainian Census]] conducted on [[December 5]], [[2001]], the population of Kiev is 2,611,300.<ref name=population/> The historic changes in population is shown in the side table. According to the census, men accounted for 1,219,000 persons, or 46.7%, and women <U+2013> 1,393,000 persons, or 53.3%. Comparing the results with the previous census (1989) shows the trend of [[population aging]] which, while prevalent throughout the country, is partly offset in Kiev by the inflow of working age migrants.

According to the census data, more than 130 nationalities and ethnic groups reside within the territory of Kiev. Ukrainians constitute the largest ethnic group in Kiev, and they account for 2,110,800 people, or 82.2% of the population. [[Russians]] comprise 337,300 (13.1%), [[Jew]]s - 17,900 (0.7%), [[Belarusians]] - 16,500 (0.6%), [[Poles]] - 6,900 (0.3%), [[Armenians]] - 4,900 (0.2%), [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] - 2,600 (0.1%), [[Tatars]] - 2,500 (0.1%), [[Georgian people|Georgians]] - 2,400 (0.1%), [[Moldovans]] - 1,900 (0.1%).

Both [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] are commonly spoken in the city, with  Russian being more widely used despite the fact that Ukrainian is claimed as their native tongue by almost three times as many residents as those who claim Russian.<ref name=CensusKiev>According to the official [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 census]] data [http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/results/general/nationality/city_kyiv/][http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/results/general/language/city_kyiv/] approximately 75% of Kiev's population responded 'Ukrainian' to the native language (ridna mova) census question, and roughly 25% responded 'Russian'. On the other hand, when the question 'What language do you use in everyday life?' was asked in the 2003 sociological survey, the Kievans' answers were distributed as follows: 'mostly Russian': 52%, 'both Russian and Ukrainian in equal measure': 32%, 'mostly Ukrainian': 14%, 'exclusively Ukrainian': 4.3%.<br>{{cite news|first= |last= |author= |url= http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20032/72|title=What language is spoken in Ukraine?|work= |publisher=Welcome to Ukraine|pages= |page= |date= 2003/2|accessdate= }}.</ref> According to a 2006 survey, Ukrainian is used at home by 23% of Kievans, as 52% use Russian and 24% switch between both.<ref name=ZerkaloKiev>"Kiev: the city, its residents, problems of today, wishes for tomorrow.", ''[[Zerkalo Nedeli]]'', April 29 - May 12, 2006.

Some 1,069,700 people have higher or completed secondary education, a significant increase of  21.7% since 1989.

The latest (April, 2007) municipal estimate of the city population is of 2.7 million residents.<ref name=population/> Other much higher estimates are often published. For instance, the amount of bakery products sold in the city (thus including temporary visitors and commuters) gives a minimum of 3.5 million people (June, 2007).<ref name=population/>

== Modern Kiev ==
[[Image:Kiev night view.jpg|thumb|[[Bird's-eye view]] of the Kiev center at night.]]
[[Image:Ukrainian National Theater.jpg|thumb|View of the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] from the Instytutska street.]]

Modern Kiev is a mix of the old and the new, seen in everything from the architecture to the stores and to the people themselves. Experiencing great population growth between the 1970s and the mid-[[1990s|'90s]], the city has continued its consistent growth after the turn of the millennium. As a result, Kiev's ''"downtown"'' is a dotted contrast of new, modern buildings amongst the pale yellows, blues and grays of older apartments. Urban sprawl has gradually reduced, while population densities of suburbs has increased. The most expensive properties are located in the [[Pechersk]], and [[Khreschatyk]] areas. It is also prestigious to own a property in newly constructed buildings in the [[Kharkivskyi neighborhood, Kiev|Kharkivskyi Raion]] or [[Obolon Raion|Obolon]] along the Dnieper.

Ukrainian independence at the turn of the millennium has heralded other changes. Western-style residential complexes, hip [[nightclub]]s, classy restaurants and prestigious hotels opened in the center. Music from [[Europe]] and [[North America]] started appearing on Ukrainian music charts. And most importantly, with the easing of the visa rules in 2005,<ref>[http://www.workpermit.com/news/2005_08_10/europe/ukraine.htm Workpermit.com] ULR accessed on July 30, 2006</ref> Ukraine is positioning itself as a prime tourist attraction, with Kiev, among the other large cities, looking to profit from new opportunities. The center of Kiev has been cleaned up and buildings have been restored and redecorated, especially the [[Khreschatyk]] street and the [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Independence Square]]. Many historic areas of Kiev, such as [[Andriyivskyy Descent]], have become popular street vendor locations, where one can find traditional [[Art of Ukraine|Ukrainian art]], religious items, books, game sets (most commonly [[chess]]) as well as [[jewelry]] for sale.<ref>[http://www.kiev.info/shopping/andrey_sp.htm ''Kiev.info''] URL accessed on June 20, 2006</ref>

=== Culture ===
A historic cultural center of the [[East Slavic]] civilization and a major cradle of [[Baptism of Kiev|Christianization]] for what became the [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] nations, Kiev retained through centuries its cultural importance and even at times of relative decay, it remained the center of the [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] of the primary importance. Its holy sites, of which the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] (the Monastery of the Caves) and the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]] are probably the most famous, attracted pilgrims for centuries and now recognized as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] remain the primary religious centers as well as the major tourist attraction.

An important part of Kiev's culture is the many theatres in the city, which include: [[Kiev Opera|Kiev Opera House]], [[Ivan Franko National Academic Drama Theater]], [[Lesya Ukrainka National Academic Theater of Russian Drama]], the [[Kiev Puppet Theater]], [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]], [[National Philharmonic Society of Ukraine|National Philharmonic of Ukraine]] and many others.  

Other cultural items include the [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]], and the [[Kiev Circus]]. The most important of the [[:Category:Museums in Kiev|city's many museums]] are the Kiev State Historical Museum, [[Museum of the Great Patriotic War, Kiev|Museum of the Great Patriotic War]], the [[National Art Museum of Ukraine|National Art Museum]], the [[Museum of Western and Oriental Art]] and the [[National Museum of Russian art]].

==== Sports ====
[[Football (soccer)]] is the most popular spectator sport in Kiev, followed by [[basketball]] and [[ice hockey]]. Kiev has many professional and amateur soccer clubs, including the [[FC Arsenal Kyiv|Arsenal]] and [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo]], which both play in the [[Vyscha Liha|top division]] of the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. Other less prominent sport clubs in the city include: the [[FC Obolon Kyiv]] soccer club, the [[HC Sokil Kyiv]] hockey club and [[BC Kyiv]] basketball club.
[[Image:Kiev stadium 1980.jpg|thumb|The Olympic Stadium in 1980 following the reconstruction for the [[1980 Summer Olympics]]]]

During the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] held in the [[Soviet Union]], Kiev held the preliminary matches and the quarter-finals of the football tournament at its [[Olimpiysky Sport Complex|Olympic Stadium]], reconstructed for the event. The stadium is the largest of Ukrainian stadiums, as well as among Kiev's 15 stadiums/sport complexes. Initially constructed for audience of 100,000, following the installation of individual seats it can now accommodate 83,053 spectators.<ref name="Beijing">[http://www.ebeijing.gov.cn/ying/t95212.htm Beijing official website] URL accessed on July 28, 2006</ref> Other notable sport stadiums/sport complexes in Kiev include the [[Lobanovsky Dynamo Stadium]], the [[Palace of Sports (Kiev)|Palace of Sports]], among many others.

Kiev does not only host field games and indoor sports, but also aquatic sports, which take place on the [[Kiev Reservoir]] at [[Vyshhorod]], and on [[Trukhaniv Island]] in the Dnieper river, opposite the city center, where there are many fine beaches and recreational facilities.<ref name="Beijing">[http://www.ebeijing.gov.cn/ying/t95212.htm Beijing official website] URL accessed on July 28, 2006</ref> In addition to that, cross country bicycling is another favorite sport, also taking place on the Trukhaniv Island.

Together with a few other cities of [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]], Kiev will house the [[2012 UEFA European Football Championship]]. Three group matches, a quarter final and the final are scheduled to be played at Kiev [[NSK Olimpiyskyi]] stadium.

==== Architecture ====
Probably, Kiev's most famous historical architecture complexes are [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|St. Sophia Cathedral]] and [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] (Monastery of the Caves), which are [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s.

Noteworthy historical architectural landmarks also include the [[Mariyinsky Palace]] (designed and constructed from 1745 to 1752, then reconstructed in 1870), several Orthodox churches such as [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery|St. Michael's Cathedral]], [[St Andrew's Church of Kiev|St. Andrew's]], [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral|St. Vladimir's]], the reconstructed [[Golden Gate (Kiev)|Golden Gate]] and others.

One of Kiev's widely recognized modern landmarks is the highly visible giant [[Mother Motherland]] statue standing at the [[Museum of the Great Patriotic War, Kiev|Museum of the Great Patriotic War]] on the Right bank of the [[Dnieper River]]. Other notable sites is the cylindrical Salut hotel, located across from Glory Square and the [[eternal flame]] at the World War Two memorial [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]].
 
Among Kiev's best-known monuments are [[Mikhail Mikeshin|Mikeshin]]'s statue of [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] astride his horse located near [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|St. Sophia Cathedral]], the venerated [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir the Great]] (St. Vladimir), the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|baptizer of Rus']], overlooking the river above [[Podil]], the monument to [[Kyi, Schek and Khoryv]] and Lybid, the legendary founders of the city located at the Dnieper embankment. On [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Independence Square]] in the city center, two tall columns elevate two modern monuments of the city protectors; the historic protector of Kiev [[Michael (archangel)|Michael Archangel]] and a modern invention, the goddess-protector [[Berehynia]].

== Transportation ==
=== Local transportation ===
[[Image:Dnepr4.jpg|thumb|[[Dnipro (Kiev Metro)|Dnipro]] station of the [[Kiev Metro]]]]

Public transportation in Kiev includes the metro (subway), [[bus]]es, [[trolleybus]]es and [[tram]]s. The publicly owned and operated [[Kiev Metro]] system is the fastest, the most convenient and affordable network that covers most, but not all, of the city. The metro is continuously expanding towards the city limits to meet growing demand, while the other kinds of public transport are not that well maintained. In particular, the public [[bus]] service has an unreliable schedule. Public electric trolleybus and tram lines are more reliable, but have aged equipment and are underfunded. The historic [[Kiev tram|tram system]], which once was a well  maintained and widely used method of transport, is now gradually being phased out in favor of buses and trolleys.

One unique mode of public transportation Kiev has is the [[Kiev funicular|funicular]], that climbs up the steep right bank of the [[Dnieper River]]. It transports 10,000-15,000 passengers daily.

All public road transport in Kiev is operated by the united ''Kyivpastrans''<ref>See also: [http://www.kpt.kiev.ua/ ''Kyivpastrans'' official website] URL accessed on July 28, 2006</ref> [[Municipality|municipal]] company. It is heavily subsidized by the city as large groups of passengers (pensioners, etc.) are granted free service on its lines.

[[Image:Trolleybus kiev.jpg|thumb|Trolleybuses in front of the [[St. Sophia Cathedral]].]]

The Kiev public transport system uses a simple tariff system regardless of distance travelled: tickets for ground transportation must be purchased each time a vehicle boarded. Discount passes are available for scholars and students. Pensioners use public transportation free. Monthly passes, which are sold at the price of 60 rides, are also available in all combinations of public transportation: metro, bus, trolley, tram. 

Recently, privately owned minibuses, ''[[marshrutka]]s'', have appeared on Kiev streets. They provide good coverage of smaller residential streets and have convenient routes. Minibuses take fewer passengers, run faster, stop on demand and are more available, although with an increased frequency of accidents. Ticket price and itinerary of private minibuses are regulated by the city government, and the cost of one ride, while higher than on public buses, is still far lower than in Western Europe.

The [[Taxicab|taxi]] market in Kiev is expansive but not adequately regulated. In particular, the taxi fare per kilometer is not regulated. There is strong competition between private taxi companies. Many allow scheduling a pick-up by phone. Also, it is quite common for a local with a car (or even people from other parts of Ukraine) to provide taxi service on the ''ad hoc'' basis. [[Traffic jam]]s and lack of parking space are growing problems for taxi services in Kiev. Current regulations allow for parking on pavements, which pedestrians may find inconvenient.

[[Image:Tram_Kiev.jpg|thumb|[[Kiev tram|Trams in Kiev's]] [[Kontraktova Square]]. The [[St Andrew's Church of Kiev|St. Andrew Church]] is visible in the background]]

=== Suburban transportation ===
Suburban transportation is provided by buses and short-range trains (''[[elektrichka]]s''). There are a few bus stations inside the city providing suburban transportations. Private minibuses (''marshrutkas'') provide faster and more frequent suburban service, currently winning the competition against large buses.

''Elektrichkas'' are serviced by the publicly owned [[Ukrzaliznytsia]] company. The suburban train service is fast, and unbeatingly safe in terms of traffic accidents. But the trains are not reliable, as they may fail significantly behind schedule, may not be safe in terms of crime, and the ''elektrichka'' cars are poorly maintained and are overcrowded in [[rush hour]]s.

There are 5 ''elektrichka'' directions from Kiev:
* [[Nizhyn]] (north-eastern)
* [[Hrebinka]] (south-eastern)
* [[Myronivka]] (southern)
* [[Fastiv]] (south-western)
* [[Korosten]] (western)

[[Image:Road to Kiev Vokzal.jpeg|thumb|The avenue to the [[Kiev Passenger Railway Station|Kiev's Railway Terminal]]]]

More than a dozen of ''elektrichka'' stops are located within the city allowing residents of different neighborhoods to use the suburban trains.

The previously extensive [[Kiev River Port|riverboat]] service along the Dnieper featuring the Meteor and Raketa hydrofoil ships is no longer available, limiting Kiev's river transport to cargo and tour boats and private pleasure craft.

=== Railways ===
[[Ukrzaliznytsia|Railways]] are Kiev<U+2019>s main mode of intracity transportation. The city has a developed railroad infrastructure including a long-distance passenger station, 6 cargo stations, depots, and repairing facilities. However, this system still fails to meet the demand for passenger service. Particularly, the [[Kiev Passenger Railway Station]] is the city's only long-distance passenger terminal (''vokzal''). Construction is underway for a new [[Darnytsia Railway Station]] on the left-bank part of Kiev, which may ease traffic at the central station.<ref>{{ru icon}} [http://www.archunion.com.ua/proekt-new-006.shtml Archunion.com.ua] URL accessed on June 20, 2006</ref> [[Kiev bridges|Bridges over the Dnieper River]] are another problem restricting the development of city<U+2019>s railway system. Presently, only one rail bridge out of two is available for intense train traffic. A new combined rail-auto bridge is under construction, as a part of Darnytsia project.

=== Air transport ===
[[Image:Boryspil Terminal B inside.jpg|thumb|The expanded ''Terminal B'' within the [[Boryspil Airport|Boryspil International Airport]]]]

Air passengers arrive in Kiev through one of two airports: the [[Boryspil Airport]] which is served by many international airlines, and the smaller [[Kyiv-Zhulyany Airport|Zhulyany Airport]], serving mostly domestic flights and limited flights to nearby countries. The international passenger terminal at Boryspil is small, yet modern.  Its international terminal was expanded in 2006. There is a separate terminal for domestic flights within walking distance. Passengers flying to other countries from Ukraine usually travel through Boryspil, as other airports in Ukraine such as Donetsk, Simferopol, Odessa, provide very limited international connections. There is also [[Gostomel Airport|Gostomel cargo airport]] in Kiev's north-western suburb of [[Hostomel]]. 

Kiev is notable in the world of aviation industry as the headquarters for [[Antonov|Antonov aircraft manufacturing company]].

=== Attractions in Kiev ===
It is said that one can walk from one end of Kiev to the other in the summertime without leaving the shade of its many trees. Most characteristic are the [[Common Horse-chestnut|horse-chestnut]]s ({{lang-uk|<U+043A><U+0430><U+0448><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438>, ''kashtany''}}).

Kiev is known as a green city with [[Kiev Botanical Garden|two botanical gardens]] and numerous large and small parks. The green nature of the city is probably most notable by the green  hills of the right bank along the Dnieper river that have been relatively untouched by development. The [[Museum of the Great Patriotic War, Kiev|World War II Museum]] is located here, which offers both indoor and outdoor displays of military history and equipment surrounded by verdant hills overlooking the Dnieper river.

Among the numerous islands, Venetsianskyi (or [[Hidropark]]) is the most developed. It is accessible by metro or by car, and includes an amusement park, swimming beaches, boat rentals, and night clubs. The Victory Park (''Park Peremohy'') located near Darnytsia subway station is a popular destination for strollers, joggers, and cyclists.

Boating, fishing, and water sports are popular pastimes in Kiev. The area lakes and rivers freeze over in the winter and ice fishermen are a frequent sight, as are children with their ice skates. However, the peak of summer draws out a greater mass of people to the shores for swimming or sunbathing, with daytime high temperatures sometimes reaching 30 to 34 [[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]].

The center of Kiev (Independence Square and Khreschatyk Street) becomes a large outdoor party place at night during summer months, with thousands of people having a good time in nearby restaurants, clubs and outdoor cafes. The central streets are closed for auto traffic on weekends and holidays.

A wide variety of farm produce is available in many of Kiev's farmer markets with the [[Besarabsky Market]] located in the very center of the city being most famous. Each residential region has its own market, or ''rynok''. Here one will find table after table of individuals hawking everything imaginable: vegetables, fresh and smoked meats, fish, cheese, honey, dairy products such as milk and home-made ''smetana'' (sour cream), [[caviar]], cut flowers, housewares, tools and hardware, and clothing. Each of the markets has its own unique mix of products with some markets devoted solely to specific wares such as automobiles, car parts, pets, clothing, flowers, etc.. There is also a popular book market by the [[Petrivka (Kiev Metro)|Petrivka metro station]]. 

At the city's southern outskirts, near the historic [[Pyrohiv (Kiev)|Pyrohiv]] village, there is an [[Open air museum|outdoor museum]], officially called the [[Pyrohiv (Kiev)|Museum of Folk Architecture and Life of Ukraine]] It has an area of {{convert|1.5|sqkm|sqmi|0}}. This territory houses several "mini-villages" that represent by region the traditional rural architecture of Ukraine.

Kiev also has numerous recreational attractions like bowling alleys, go-cart tracks, paintball venues, billiard halls and even shooting ranges.

== Economy ==
[[Image:ParusKyivDone.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Parus Business Centre]], one of the new office constructions built throughout Kiev.]]

Kiev, as the capital of Ukraine, is a major administrative center housing amongst others ministries responsible for the economy of the country. Factories in Kiev are found in all parts of the city, with a major concentration of industrial organizations to the west of the city center and on the left bank of the Dnieper River.
:''See also: [[:Category:Economy of Kiev city|Economy of Kiev]], [[Economy of Ukraine]]''

=== Industrial organizations ===
The Kiev engineering plants manufacture their equipment utilizing metal from the iron and steel areas of [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast#Economy|Dnipropetrovshchyna]] and the [[Donets Basin|Donbas]] coalfield. These plants in Kiev make equipment for chemical plants, such as conveyor lines for [[vulcanized rubber]], [[linoleum]], [[fertilizer]] factories, and also metal-cutting machines. Other engineering products of Kiev area include aircraft ''(see: [[Antonov]])'', hydraulic elevators, electrical instruments, armatures, river-and-sea crafts, motorcycles, and cinematography equipment.

Another important sector is the chemical industry, which produces resin products, fertilizers, plastics, and chemical fibers, made at the [[Darnytsia|Darnytsky Raion]] [[viscose]] plant on the left bank of Kiev. Lumber milling and the production of bricks and reinforced concrete items are another well developed industry. Consumer manufactured goods include cameras ''(see: [[Kiev-Arsenal (photo camera)]]'', thermos flasks, knitwear, footwear, a range of foodstuffs, and hand watches. Kiev is also a large publishing centre.

=== Power production ===
Kiev is supplied by electricity primary from the [[Kiev Hydroelectric Power Station]], completed in 1968, just upstream of the city at [[Vyshhorod]], on the [[Kiev Reservoir]], and from [[Trypillia]] thermal electric station. Nowadays, all but a few regions of Ukraine are interconnected by the Ukrainian electric power grid. Following the [[Chernobyl accident]] the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] located 100 km north of Kiev has been closed. Kiev also receives its power supply in the form of natural gas, piped from [[Urengoy]]-Pomary-[[Uzhhorod]] pipeline.

== Education ==

== City name evolution ==
[[Image:Kiou1562.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A fragment of ''Russiae, Moscoviae et Tartariae'' map by Anthony Jenkinson (London 1562) published by [[Ortelius]] in 1570.]]
[[Image:Kiev_on_1804_map.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A fragment from a 1804 [[John Cary]]'s "New map of Europe, from the latest authorities" published in "Cary's new universal atlas", London, 1808.]]

Currently, ''Kiev'' is the traditional and most commonly used [[English language|English]] name for the city, but the [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainianized]] version ''Kyiv'' is gaining usage. 

As a prominent city with a long history, its English name was subject to gradual evolution. The early English spelling was derived from [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]] form ''Kijev<U+044A>'' ([[Cyrillic]]: <U+041A><U+0456><U+0454><U+0432><U+044A>), derived from [[Kyi]] ([[Cyrillic]]:  <U+041A><U+0438><U+0439>, alt. ''Kiy''), the [[Kyi, Schek and Khoryv|legendary founder of the city]].

Early on the city was mentioned in published sources as ''Kiou'', ''Kiow'', ''Kiew'', ''Kiovia''. On one of the oldest English maps of the region ''Russiae, Moscoviae et Tartariae'' published by [[Ortelius]] (London, 1570) the city is spelled as ''Kiou''. On the map by Guillaume de Beauplan (1650) the name of the city was given as ''Kiiow'', and the region was named as ''K<U+00FF>owia''. In English traveler Joseph Marshall's book ''Travels'' (London, 1772) the city is referred as ''Kiovia''. <ref name=Marshall>{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=Joseph, fl.1770 |title= Travels through Germany, Russia, and Poland in the years 1769 and 1770. |origyear=1772 |year=1971 |publisher=Arno Press |location=New York |language= |isbn=040502763X |oclc= |doi= |id={{LCCN|77||135821}} }} Originally published: London, J. Almon, 1773, {{LCCN|03||005435}}.</ref> While the choice of these spellings have likely been influenced by the [[Polish name|Polish]] name of the city ({{lang-pl|Kij<U+00F3>w}}) as until mid-seventeenth century the city was controlled by [[Polish Crown|Poland]], the name ''Kiev'' {{IPA |[<U+02C8>kijef]}} that started to take hold at later times, likely originates on the basis of [[Russian language|Russian]] orthography and pronunciation {{IPA |[<U+02C8>kijef]}}, during a time when Kiev was a city in a [[Russian Empire]], since 1708 a center of the [[Governorate]].

In English, ''Kiev'' was used in print as early as in 1804 in the [[John Cary]]'s "New map of Europe, from the latest authorities" in "Cary's new universal atlas" published in [[London]]. The English travelogue titled ''New Russia: Journey from Riga to the Crimea by way of Kiev'', by Mary Holderness was published in 1823.<ref name=Holderness>{{cite book |last=Holderness |first=Mary |authorlink=Mary Holderness |title=Journey from Riga to the Crimea, with some account of the manners and customs of the colonists of new Russia. |origyear=1823 |publisher=Sherwood, Jones and co. |location=London |oclc=5073195 |doi= |id={{LCCN|04||024846}} |pages=316 }}</ref> By 1883, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] included ''Kiev'' in a quotation. While Kiev remained a prevailing English usage, ''Kyiv'' ({{IPA|[<U+02C8>k<U+026A>jiw]}}), [[romanized]] version of the name of the city used in modern [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] since early-twentieth century,<ref name=Burst/> has been used in English-language publications of the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] and in some academic publications concerning Ukraine during much of the twentieth century. 

Newly-independent Ukraine declared Ukrainian the only [[official language]] after 1991, and introduced a national Latin-alphabet standard for geographic names in 1995, establishing the use of the spelling ''Kyiv'' in all official documents issued by the governmental authorities since October 1995. The spelling is used by the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], some foreign [[diplomatic mission]]s and a number of media organizations, notably in [[Canada]]. On [[October 3]], [[2006]], the United States federal government changed its official spelling of the city name to Kyiv.<ref>Harry Dunphy, [http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/wireStory?id=2588280 U.S. Alters Its Spelling of Ukraine City], ''[[The Associated Press]]'', October 19, 2006</ref> The alternate romanizations ''Kyyiv'' (BGN/PCGN transliteration) and ''Kyjiv'' (scholarly) are also in use alongside ''Kiev'' in English-language atlases. Most major English-language news sources, however, such as [[CNN]], [[BBC]], and the [[Associated Press]], continue to use ''Kiev''.

In the Ukrainian language itself, the name of the city was pronounced Kiev until only about 100 years ago.<ref name=Burst>Edward Burstynsky, former head of the [[Linguistics]] department at the [[University of Toronto]], cited by Andrew Gregorovich in [http://www.infoukes.com/faq/kyiv-2/ Kiev or Kyiv?], ''FORUM Ukrainian Review'', No. 92, Spring 1995</ref>
