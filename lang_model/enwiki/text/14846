==Legislation==

Legislation to extend unemployment benefits has been blocked from coming to a vote on the floor of the Senate through minority [[filibuster]] or holds).  This began in February 2010 with a blockage of a unemployment benefit funding bill vote (for already authorized and granted unemployment checks for those who'd not exhausted their benefits) by a single Senator, [[Jim Bunning]] (R-KY):<ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0210/33566.html Politico], Sen. Jim Bunning holds floor, Politico</ref>

<blockquote>Senate Democrats spent Thursday night hammering away at Sen. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) for single-handedly holding up action in the upper chamber <U+2013> but he blurted out a message to one of them on the Senate floor: "Tough s<U+2014>t."  In an unusual display in the normally sleepy chamber, Bunning <U+2013> without the support of GOP leadership <U+2013> has blocked efforts to quickly approve a series of extensions to measures that would otherwise expire Sunday, including unemployment insurance and the Cobra program that allows people who lose their health benefits to continue getting coverage.</blockquote>

Following that [[precedent]], Senate floor votes on unemployment have systematically required a [[supermajority]] of sixty votes to bring the bills to the floor.  Bunning's position was that he wanted the bill paid for out of previously allocated funds from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. Senators who did not initially support Bunning's position have since used that argument to block or delay votes on unemployment extensions that could not achieve a supermajority to reach the floor for a vote.<ref>[http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/111057-unemployment-extension-should-have-been-paid-for-sen-mike-johanns The Hill], Unemployment extension should have been paid for (Sen. Mike Johanns) The Hill</ref>

Economists have cited that unemployment should not have the requirement of being paid for out of an existing stimulus package because it is stimulative and, therefore, to take away allocated funds from other projects would have a self-canceling effect.<ref name='cbpp'>[http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=863 Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ], The Four Pieces of Effective Fiscal Stimulus  Unemployment Insurance, State Relief, Food Stamps, and Tax Refunds, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</ref>

<blockquote>Temporary increases in unemployment insurance (UI) benefits are particularly effective as stimulus:  the benefits go to workers who have lost their jobs, so the added income is likely to be spent quickly.  As CBO director Orszag recently told the House Budget Committee, <U+201C>research has shown that the unemployment insurance system is among the most effective dollar-for-dollar economic stabilizers that we have in terms of counterbalancing periods of economic weakness.<U+201D><br/>

Accordingly, a stimulus package should include a temporary measure to provide additional weeks of federally funded UI benefits for workers who exhaust their regular UI benefits before they can find work, as Congress has done in every recent recession.  The need will be especially great if a new recession sets in, given the large share of unemployed workers who have remained without a job for longer than 26 weeks (the normal duration of UI benefits). </blockquote>

The passage of the bill to fund eligible (non-exhausted) unemployment benefits required a special appointment of a replacement senator, [[Carte Goodwin]], by [[West Virginia]] Governor [[Joe Manchin]], after the death of Senator [[Robert Byrd]] (D-WV), whose vote was needed for the supermajority.  This gave the Senate its 60th vote for the legislation and the funds were released to the states to pay unemployment compensation to those who were eligible and who had not yet exhausted benefits as of July 2010.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100722/ap_on_bi_ge/us_unemployment_benefits Associated Press], Checks are coming: Obama signs unemployment bill, AP</ref>

<blockquote>Wrangling over the larger measure consumed about four months. The jobless benefits portion picked up enough GOP support in the Senate<U+2014>Maine moderates Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe<U+2014>only after it was broken off as a stand-alone bill. It would have passed last month were it not for the death of Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.; Byrd's replacement, Democrat Carte Goodwin, cast the key 60th vote Tuesday to defeat a GOP filibuster.</blockquote>

The passage of the bill did not provide for those who have exhausted their benefits (99ers).

On August 4, 2010, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Debbie Stabenow]] (D-MI) introduced a bill (S.3706) to extend unemployment past 99 weeks.  The bill was referred to the [[Senate Finance Committee]] prior to the Senate breaking for their summer vacation:

'''The Americans Want to Work Act (S.3706)'''<br />
A Senate bill introduced by Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) on August 4, 2010 will, if passed, benefit those who have exhausted all of their benefits by providing an additional 20 weeks of unemployment benefits under a Tier 5. The bill has an unemployment rate threshold of 7.5% which requires states to have an unemployment rate at 7.5% or higher to qualify.  The bill was announced by Senator Stabenow on [[MSNBC]]'s ''The [[Ed Schultz]] Show'' [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/38584698#38565782 (video)]<ref name="ed">[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/38584698#38565782 The Ed Shultz Show], MSNBC News, Senator Stabenow Announces 99er Bill</ref>.  The bill is co-sponsored by Senators [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY), [[Harry Reid]] (D-NV), [[Dick Durbin]] (D-IL), [[Carl Levin]] (D-MI), [[Bob Casey, Jr.]] (D-PA), [[Christopher Dodd]] (D-CT), [[Sherrod Brown]] (D-OH), [[Jack Reed]] (D-RI), and [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] (D-RI).<ref name="S.3706 Senator Stabenow Offical Press Release">[http://stabenow.senate.gov/press/2010/080410Americanswanttoworkact.htm S.3706 Senator Stabenow Press Release], S.3706 Senator Stabenow Press Release</ref>

The proposed bill is designed to help 99ers by:<br />
* Creating an additional tier of benefits for those who have exhausted their unemployment insurance.
* Extends the HIRE Act payroll tax exemption through the end of 2011.
* Doubles the general business tax credit to encourage businesses to hire the hardest hit Americans.

Tier 5 Unemployment Insurance (Under S.3706 Bill):  What it does: Provides 20 weeks of additional unemployment insurance for states with 7.5% or higher unemployment. This tier will benefit the people who have exhausted all of their benefits.

Retroactive Eligibility: Would apply retroactively to everyone who has exhausted all of their previous tiers in recent months. However, benefits would not be paid retroactively. (Example: a claimant who exhausted his or her benefits three months ago would be eligible to begin Tier 5 at the date of enactment. He or she would not, however, be paid out for the three months in which no benefits were received. If a claimant is going to exhaust benefits in two weeks, he or she will move right onto Tier 5 and receive 20 weeks of benefits.)

Requirements: People who are unemployed still need to meet current UI law requirements such as job searches.

On August 10, 2010, Representative [[Shelley Berkley]] (D-NV) introduced a House bill (H.R. 6901) to extend benefits for another 20 additional weeks for states whose unemployment rate exceeds 10 percent:

'''The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act (H.R. 6091)'''<br />
A House bill introduced by Representative [[Shelley Berkley]] (D-NV-1) on August 10, 2010 will, if passed, benefit those who have exhausted all of their benefits by providing an additional 20 weeks of unemployment benefits under a Tier 5.

News reports and interviews have been presented by various media outlets that include the ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[Washington Post]]'' and [[PBS]]'s ''NewsHour''.

Excerpts from the ''New York Times'' and [[PBS NewsHour]]:

<blockquote>'''99 Weeks Later, Jobless Have Only Desperation'''

In June, with long-term unemployment at record levels, about 1.4&nbsp;million people were out of work for 99 weeks or more, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Not all of them received unemployment benefits, but for many of those who did, the modest payments were a lifeline that enabled them to maintain at least a veneer of normalcy, keeping a roof over their heads, putting gas in their cars, paying electric and phone bills.

Without the checks, many like Ms. Jarrin, who lost her job as director of client services at a small technology company in March 2008, are beginning to tumble over the economic cliff. The last vestiges of their former working-class or middle-class lives are gone; it is inescapable now that they are indigent.<ref name="99ers10">[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/us/03unemployed.html NY Times], NY Times Article on "99ers"</ref> </blockquote>

<blockquote>
'''Long-Term Joblessness Takes Emotional, Spiritual Toll on '99ers'''

July's jobs reading came as bad news for job seekers and the U.S. economy. The Labor Department reports that 6.6&nbsp;million people have been unemployed for 27 weeks or longer. Paul Solman talks to people who have been out of work for 99 weeks or longer as part of his ongoing series on making sense of financial news.<ref name="99ers11">[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec10/99ers_08-06.html PBS NewsHour], PBS Video on "99ers"</ref> </blockquote>

Sixteen notable economists and historians have joined in a consensus statement for The Daily Beast demanding urgent action on unemployment and the faltering recovery. Joseph Stiglitz, Alan Blinder, Robert Reich, Richard Parker, Derek Shearer, Laura Tyson, Sir Harold Evans, and other thought leaders have produced a manifesto calling for more government stimulus and tax credits to put America back to work. <br/>
<br/>
Fourteen million unemployed represents a gigantic waste of human capital, an irrecoverable loss of wealth and spending power, and an affront to the ideals of America. Some 6.8&nbsp;million have been out of work for 27 weeks or more. Members of Congress went home to celebrate July 4 having failed to extend unemployment benefits.<br/>
<br/>
We recognize the necessity of a program to cut the mid- and long-term federal deficit but the imperative requirement now, and the surest course to balance the budget over time, is to restore a full measure of economic activity. As in the 1930s, the economy is suffering a sharp decline in aggregate demand and loss of business confidence. Long experience shows that monetary policy may not be enough, particularly in deep slumps, as Keynes noted.</blockquote>

On August 15, 2010, The [[Cleveland]] [[Plain Dealer]] published an article entitled "''They're Known as 'the 99ers,' and their numbers are growing in Ohio and nationwide''."<ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2010/08/theyre_known_as_the_99ers_and.html The Cleveland Plain Dealer], They're known as 'the 99ers,' and their numbers are growing in Ohio and nationwide, The Plain Dealer</ref>

<blockquote>They're known as "the 99ers." After two years or more without jobs, they say they're losing a critical safety net at a time when finding work is still agonizingly difficult.  The result: a growing legion of people -- many of them older, many once middle class -- who are exhausting their benefits. It's a wave that threatens to besiege social services and leave the government grasping for answers.</blockquote>

The U.K.'s [[The Observer]] published "''Jobless millions signal death of the American dream for many''."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/15/jobless-millions-death-american-dream The Observer], Jobless millions signal death of the American dream for many, The Observer</ref>

<blockquote>There are now more than a million 99ers and the number gets bigger each week.  But who are they? Despite Republican attempts to paint them as feckless or job-shy, they are usually anything but. The 99ers are people like Anne Strauss, 58, who spent 35 years working as a PR professional on Long Island. Despite spending every day hunting for work, she has not had a job since June 2008. She and her husband are now living on credit cards watching debts mount as they stare into the abyss. "Looking for a job is the hardest I have ever worked," she said with a smile that conveyed no humour or happiness, only the deep stress that is common to many 99ers.</blockquote>

==Controversy==

Republican legislators have insisted that additional unemployment benefits be paid for out of existing funds. This is a departure from how unemployment benefits have been funded in the past, as unemployment is stimulative and, therefore, such funding would cancel out stimulus projects that would then lose their funding, thereby negating the stimulative effect.<ref name="cbpp"/>

Democratic supporters of additional unemployment extensions have pointed out that Republicans who are calling for unemployment benefits to be paid for out of existing funds are, in some cases, the same legislators who insist the [[Bush tax cuts]] be renewed without funding.  Republicans have countered the Bush tax cuts are stimulative and therefore do not require funding.<ref name="gma">[http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2010/07/bachmann-pay-for-unemployment-benefits-not-tax-cuts.html ABC News], Bachmann: Pay for Unemployment Benefits, Not Tax Cuts, ABC News</ref>

<blockquote>[[President Obama]] had made a campaign pledge of allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire. During a Monday-morning Rose Garden speech, President Obama again chided Republicans for blocking efforts to pass an extension of jobless benefits while working overtime to extend tax cuts for the rich.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/2010/07/20/bush-tax-cuts-to-extend-or-not-to-extend.html Newsweek], Bush Tax Cuts, Newsweek</ref> </blockquote>

Economists who support the non-funding of stimulus (i.e unemployment) have rebutted the Republican claims that the Bush tax cuts for the top two percent are stimulative or that they pay for themselves, insisting instead that they add to the deficit without creating jobs or adding to the economy in a significant way.<ref>[http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=165 Center on Budget and Policy Priorities], Claim That Tax Cuts Pay For Themselves Is Too Good To Be True, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</ref>

The requirement of a supermajority to bring bills to the floor imposed by the minority on unemployment legislation has led to heated and controversial comments, with this exchange between Senators [[Jim Bunning]] (R-KY) and [[Jeff Merkley]] (D-OR):<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/26/jim-bunning-repeatedly-bl_n_477910.html Huffington Post, Politico], Jim Bunning Repeatedly Blocks Unemployment Benefits Extension, Huffington Post, Politico</ref>

<blockquote>As Democratic senators asked again and again for unanimous consent for a vote on a 30-day extension Thursday night, Bunning refused to go along. And when Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) begged him to drop his objection, Politico reports, Bunning replied: "Tough shit." <br/><br/>
And at one point during the debate, which dragged on till nearly midnight, Bunning complained of missing a basketball game. "I have missed the Kentucky-South Carolina game that started at 9:00," he said, "and it's the only redeeming chance we had to beat South Carolina since they're the only team that has beat Kentucky this year.</blockquote>

Some politicians and lawmakers have criticized 99ers as lazy or unwilling to work<ref name="wm">[http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2010_06/024378.php Washington Monthly], Washington Monthly: "Republicans Don't Like the Unemployed"</ref>:

<blockquote>'''Republicans Don't Like the Unemployed'''. The evidence continues to pile up to suggest [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] lawmakers and candidates actively dislike -- on a personal level -- those who've lost their jobs in the recession.  It's been remarkable to watch this unfold of late. One GOP congressman recently compared the unemployed to "[[hobo]]s." Several Republicans have blocked extended benefits for the unemployed. In the House, GOP lawmakers tried to eliminate a successful jobs program. Sen. [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-Utah) actually started pushing a measure to require the unemployed to take mandatory drug tests in exchange for benefits.  And now Republican Senate candidate [[Rand Paul]], in his infinite wisdom, wants the jobless to quit their bellyaching and "get back to work."<ref name="wm"/></blockquote>

Several controversial statements have been made about the unemployed and the poor:

* [[Sharron Angle]]: "That's what's happened to us is that we have put in so much entitlement into our government that we really have spoiled our citizenry and said you don't want the jobs that are available."<ref name="maddow8-4"/>

* Senator [[Jon Kyle]] (R-AZ): "Continuing to pay people unemployment compensation is a disincentive for them to seek new work."<ref name="maddow8-4"/>

* Rep. [[Dean Heller]] (R-NV): "Is the government now creating Hobos?" [by extending unemployment benefits].<ref name="maddow8-4"/>

* [[Lieutenant Governor]] [[Andre Bauer]] (R-SC): "My grandmother was not a highly educated woman but she told me, as a small child, to quit feeding stray animals.  You know why?

And so, what you've got to do is you've go to curtail that type of behavior.  They don't know any better."<ref name="maddow8-4"/>

On May 24, 2010, [[Cynthia Tucker]] of the [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], published: ''Unemployment benefits make people lazy? Not so'', where she reported how the economist [[Mark Zandi]] cited the lack of available jobs<ref name="epi"/> in response to a statement by Senator [[Judd Gregg]] (R-NH) that unemployment benefits discouraged the unemployed from looking for work<ref name="ajc">[http://blogs.ajc.com/cynthia-tucker/2010/05/24/unemployment-benefits-make-people-lazy-not-so The Atlanta Journal-Constitution], Unemployment benefits make people lazy? Not so, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</ref>

<blockquote>A favorite conservative talking point is the notion that giving people who lose their jobs unemployment benefits makes them lazy and unlikely to look for work. Republican Senator Judd Gregg repeated that assertion on CNBC this morning. Happily, the well-respected economist Mark Zandi was on the air with him and tactfully disagreed ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FneJm_0sfc Video]).</blockquote>

From the [[CNBC]] interview:

<blockquote>Senator Judd Gregg (R-NH): "You're out of the recession, you're starting to see growth, and you're clearly going to dampen that growth if you keep an economy that basically encourages people to, rather than go out and look for work, to stay on unemployment."<br/><br/>
Economist [[Mark Zandi]] countered Senator Gregg's statement: "In this environment, because the job market is so bad, it's still premature to give up on those emergency benefits. I mean, just the statistics, for every job opening, there's five people that are looking for work.  I mean, that is incredibly unusual, I think.  Therefore, it is incredibly premature to give up on those emergency benefits."<ref name="ajc"/></blockquote>

99ers have responded to these and similar statements with their own stories of repeated and unsuccessful job hunting efforts where the number of applicants have far exceeded the available positions.<ref name="99ers11"/>

The Economic Policy Institute's data supports the 99ers' and Mark Zandi's position in their March 2010 report of an average of five applicants for each opening<ref name="epi">[http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/job_openings_improve_but_still_more_than_5_unemployed_workers_per_avai/ Economic Policy Institute], EPI 5 applicants for each job stats</ref>.

==Hiring==

Proponents of benefits extension point out that corporations are sitting on approximately 1.8&nbsp;trillion in cash while not hiring<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/hoarding-hiring-corporations-stockpile-mountain-cash/story?id=10250559 ABC News Report], Hoarding, Not Hiring <U+2013> Corporations Stockpile Mountain of Cash - ABC News</ref>:

<blockquote>'''Hoarding, Not Hiring <U+2013> Corporations Stockpile Mountain of Cash'''. Reluctant to Spend or Expand, U.S. Companies Are Sitting on a Record $1.6&nbsp;Trillion.  One piece of economic data that has caught the attention of Byrnes, and others in his predicament, is a fairly staggering figure that comes out of the Bureau of Economic Analysis: Despite widespread unemployment, the BEA reports that U.S. corporations, reluctant to expand in an uncertain economy, are sitting on $1.6&nbsp;trillion in cash reserves, a record amount, according to BEA economist Greg Key. Even looking at the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index of blue chips -- and stripping out financials, which are required by regulators to keep large cash reserves in order to cushion against risk -- the cash on hand number is still rather monstrous: $1.1&nbsp;trillion. To put that in perspective, as a percentage of companies' total market capitalization, that $1.1&nbsp;trillion is more than double the ratio seen before the crisis.

[[MSNBC]] reported in June 2010, that, for 99ers, a job can feel like a mirage:<ref>[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37404685/ns/business-economy_at_a_crossroads/ MSNBC News], MSNBC News, For 99ers, a job can seem like a mirage</ref>

They have lost many things: homes, cars, valuables, relationships, health insurance, even the cell phones and computers that provide the lifeline to the one thing they need most<U+2014>a job.</blockquote>

The Economic Policy Institute's March 2010 report cites an average of five applicants for each job opening<ref name="epi"/>.

<blockquote>By the end of 2009, the jobless rate stood at 10.0 percent and the number of unemployed persons at 15.3&nbsp;million.

==Impact of age==

The Bureau of Labor Statistic's report cites that, while more younger workers were unemployed, the [[Ageism#Employment|older worker]] was the most impacted by long-term unemployment<ref name="bls"/>.

<blockquote>Older workers also experienced an average duration spell of 29.5 weeks of unemployment, the longest among the groups.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As I approached the rally in front of the Federal Steps and the New York Stock Exchange, I saw hundreds of people assembled together chanting and holding signs.  Their chants were in line with the messages on their signs, <U+201C>Where are the jobs? We want jobs now! We are 99ers and we want to work!<U+201D>  Different speakers addressed the crowd. They spoke of the tough times and pleaded for help. Help to get them back to work so they can feed their families, pay their bills and once again live the American dream. They called on Congress to help them with additional benefits until the jobs return." John Noyes, NY Department of Labor, August 12, 2010<ref name="nydol"/></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Today on Wall Street, people who have been out of work for nearly two years rallied to ask: where's the recovery for the Middle Class? Today, I attended a rally of professional Americans who have been displaced by corporate greed and out-of-touch politicians; a passionate crowd of 99ers rallied at the Federal Hall, here in New York, in the shadow of Wall Street.  They had one basic question:  Where are the jobs? I'd like to tell these people that Washington is listening, but the reality is that members of Congress are back home trying to save their own jobs.  You can see the passion in the eyes of the 99ers today.  They just want a chance to work.  That's it." Ed Schultz, MSNBC's ''The Ed Show'' - [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/38683246#38683246 Video].<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/38683246#38683246 MSNBC],'' The Ed Show'' (Video)</ref></blockquote>
