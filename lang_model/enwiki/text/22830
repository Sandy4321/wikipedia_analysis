"'''Lisa the Vegetarian'''" is the fifth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''{{'}} [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 15, 1995. In the episode, the [[Simpson family]] takes a trip to a local [[petting zoo]], that convinces [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] to give up on meat and become a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. Giving up meat turns out to be a controversial decision, since everyone around her, especially [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], seems to support the eating of flesh. With help from [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]] and [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Linda McCartney]], however, she makes an effort to stick to her new vegetarian belief.

[[David X. Cohen|David S. Cohen]] wrote the episode, and [[Mark Kirkland]] directed it. Cohen came up with the idea when he was working on a script for another episode of ''The Simpsons''. He then pitched the idea to [[David Mirkin]], the [[show runner]] at the time. Mirkin felt he could not say no to the episode because he had just become a vegetarian himself. Paul McCartney and his then-wife Linda McCartney guest star in the episode. McCartney's condition for appearing was that Lisa would remain a vegetarian for the rest of the series.

The episode features cultural reference to [[The Beatles]] and McCartney's [[Paul McCartney (solo)|solo career]]. Linda rephrases a line from the Beatles' song "[[Octopus's Garden]]" in the episode, and Apu refers to himself as the "[[fifth Beatle]]". McCartney's song "[[Maybe I'm Amazed]]" plays during the the [[closing credits]], and if played backwards, McCartney can be heard reciting a recipe for lentil soup.

"Lisa the Vegetarian" finished 47th in the ratings for the week of October 9 to October 15, 1995, with a 9.0 [[Nielsen Ratings|Nielsen rating]]. It was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. It received generally positive reviews from television critics. The episode has won two awards, an [[Environmental Media Awards|Environmental Media Award]] and a [[Genesis Awards|Genesis Award]], for bringing up environmental and animal issues on the show.

==Plot==
The [[Simpson family]] visits a [[petting zoo]], where Lisa is enraptured by a cute little lamb. That night, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] serves [[meat chop|lamb chops]] for dinner, but Lisa cannot eat it. She makes the connection between the lamb chop and its living counterpart, and she rejects the food. At school, her newfound vegetarianism becomes a problem, and the students are forced to watch a [[propaganda film]], starring [[Troy McClure]], that depicts meat-eating in a positive light. Reaction at home is no better; she is razzed mercilessly by Homer and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] for rejecting meat, particularly since Homer is ready to host a barbecue complete with roast pig. Lisa brings [[gazpacho]], a meat-free Spanish dish, to her dad's shindig, but the party goers laugh in her face. Enraged, she climbs aboard a riding mower and drives away with the roast pig in tow. Homer and Bart chase after her, but she pushes the pig off a slope, and they are too late. The pig rolls through bushes, into a river, and is shot into the air by a [[dam]] [[spillway]]'s suction.

At home, Homer scolds Lisa for ruining his party, and she rebukes him for serving meat. They fight and she leaves the house. As Lisa walks along, she finds the pressures to conform to an [[omnivore|omnivorous]] society too great, prompting her to grab a hot dog from the grill at the [[Kwik-E-Mart]] and take a bite. However, Apu, himself a [[Veganism|vegan]], reveals that she has eaten a [[tofu]] dog. Apu takes Lisa through a secret passageway to the Kwik-E-Mart roof to meet Paul and Linda McCartney. One brief heart-to-heart later, Lisa is committed once more to vegetarianism, but she is now also endowed with Apu's belief that one should not go pushing one's own views on everyone else. Inspired, Lisa begins to walk back home and finds Homer frantically searching for her. She apologizes to Homer, admitting she had no right to ruin his cookout; he forgives her and offers her a ride home.

===Writing===
[[Image:Davidcohen.jpg|thumb|This was the first full length episode [[David X. Cohen|David S. Cohen]] wrote.]]The episode was written by [[David X. Cohen|David S. Cohen]].<ref name="BBC"/> It was the first full length episode he wrote on ''The Simpsons''.<ref name="Cohen">{{cite video | people=Cohen, David|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Vegetarian"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Cohen had just recently joined the staff, and before he wrote this episode he had only written the ''Nightmare Cafeteria'' segment in the [[The Simpsons (season 6)|season six]] episode "[[Treehouse of Horror V]]".<ref name="BBC2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season6/page6.shtml|title=Treehouse of Horror V|accessdate=2007-03-21|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref><ref name="Mirkin"/> Cohen was working on a script for another episode of ''The Simpsons'' when he came up with the idea that Lisa should become a vegetarian.<ref name="Cohen"/> Cohen was not paying attention to the script he was supposed to write because he was waiting for lunch, and on the back of the script he scribbled "Lisa becomes a vegetarian?". Cohen then showed that note to ''The Simpsons'' writer [[Brent Forrester]], who liked the idea.<ref name="Cohen"/> Then-show runner [[David Mirkin]], who at that point had recently become a vegetarian, quickly approved the idea when Cohen pitched it to him.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Mirkin felt he was very personally invested in the story, and several of Lisa's experiences in the episode are based on what Mirkin went through when he became a vegetarian.<ref name="Mirkin"/>

Cohen thinks the advantage of writing episodes about Lisa is that when she cares about something, the audience can really believe in her.<ref name="Cohen"/> Mirkin said she is the perfect kind of character for these kinds of stories, and that they use other characters for other types of stories. Every time they do a story that involves thinking about the way the world is, "it is often through her eyes," he said.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Mirkin added that he really enjoyed working on the episode because Lisa protests against the school for teaching children that it is okay to hurt animals. He claimed that some schools in the United States let children at a young age [[dissection|dissect]] animals, and that the schools think it is okay, so he likes that the episode shows that Lisa has a different opinion.<ref name="Mirkin"/> When Lisa protests in class, her teacher presses an "independent thought alarm" button behind her desk, which triggers an alarm in the principal's office. Mirkin said it was the writers' point of view of schools, and he claimed that his school was not very welcoming to independent thought.<ref name="Mirkin"/>

Mirkin thought the use of Apu in the episode was great. He said that no matter what belief you have, tolerance is an important part of it, and that is what this episode is trying to tell.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Lisa feels that because she is different from everyone else, they are being intolerant to her, but in fact, she is also being intolerant to them when she ruins Homer's barbecue party, for example. The writers wanted to point out with the episode that the way to get people to change is through tolerance and understanding, which Mirkin felt Apu, as well as Paul and Linda, work out perfectly in the story.<ref name="Mirkin"/> To make fun of Lisa's new belief, Homer tells Lisa that you do not win friends with salad. He, Bart, and Marge (who tells Lisa she got caught in the rhythm) form a [[conga line]] and begin to dance around in the living room while singing "you don't win friends with salad!" repeatedly. Homer's line was in Cohen's original draft, but the dancing and the singing were added later.<ref name="Cohen"/> The creator of ''The Simpsons'', [[Matt Groening]], thinks the joke is one of the high-points of the show.<ref name="Groening"/>

Former ''Simpsons'' show runner and writer [[Bill Oakley]] came up with the barbecue part of the plot in the episode.<ref name="Cohen"/> Cohen's first draft contained a more philosophical argument between Lisa and Homer about eating meat, but Oakley said: "I think you need something more specific to base the key point of their argument around, like a barbecue".<ref name="Cohen"/> [[George Meyer]], a writer on ''The Simpsons'', came up with the idea of the barbecue pig getting stuck in the spillway and getting shot into the air. Mirkin thinks Meyer comes up with very bizarre physical jokes that "really are the oddest thing. They're not normal, and you've sort of never seen them before".<ref name="Mirkin"/>

===Voice acting===
[[Image:Paullindasimpsons.png|thumb|200px|[[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Linda McCartney]] as depicted in the episode. McCartney was the only surviving [[The Beatles|Beatles]] member the ''Simpsons'' staff had not been able to get on the show.]]The staff wanted all of the surviving [[The Beatles|Beatles]] members to appear on ''The Simpsons''.<ref name="Mirkin"/> [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] had previously guest starred on the show, so Paul McCartney was the only one they had never been able to get.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Mirkin knew that this story would be attractive to McCartney, who is a vegetarian; McCartney agreed to appear on the show, under the condition that Lisa would remain a vegetarian for the rest of the series and would not revert back the next week.<ref name="Mirkin"/><ref name="erin"/> The trait stayed and is one of the few permanent character changes made in the show.<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Vegetarian"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Cohen said that he thinks this episode is one of the most memorable because of the very fact that Lisa's vegetarianism stayed permanent and that it has been referred to many times in later episodes.<ref name="Cohen"/>

In Cohen's original script, it was only Apu who turned Lisa's opinion over at the end. Mirkin then managed to get McCartney to appear in the episode, but at the same time he kept Cohen's thoughts on Apu and his garden in it, which Cohen praised Mirkin for.<ref name="Cohen"/> Mirkin also got McCartney's then-wife, Linda McCartney, to appear in the episode.<ref name="BBC"/> She said it was a chance for them "to spread the vegetarian word to a wider audience".<ref name="erin">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,297441,00.html|title=The third Beatle debuts on ''The Simpsons''|last=Richter|first=Erin|date=June 2, 1995|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref>

Mirkin said that recording with McCartney and Linda was one of the most amazing experiences of his life.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Mirkin flew to London, where he went to McCartney's recording studio to meet the couple. Groening was supposed to come with Mirkin to London, but he arrived too late at the airport, and Mirkin had already boarded the plane.<ref name="Groening"/> Mirkin met McCartney and Linda at the recording studio, which was about ninety minutes outside of London, where he spent "the most amazing days" of his life. It took about an hour for the couple to record their parts in the recording studio<U+2014>the same studio in which The Beatles reunited.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Mirkin said the couple was really in love and sweet to each other when he was there.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Following Linda McCartney's death in 1998, the episode "[[Trash of the Titans]]" was dedicated to her memory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season9/page22.shtml|title=Trash of the Titans|accessdate=2007-03-02|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>

===Directing and animation===
The episode was directed by [[Mark Kirkland]].<ref name="BBC"/> He thought it would be fun to direct an episode about vegetarianism because he did not remember seeing the topic covered in television, even though it is a huge belief in the world.<ref name="Kirkland"/> Mirkin agreed with Kirkland and said that he thinks the topic has only grown and gotten bigger on television.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Kirkland later said it was one of his favorite episodes he directed on the show.<ref name="Kirkland">{{cite video | people=Kirkland, Mark|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Vegetarian"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

In one scene in the episode, Homer fills the grill with two bottles of [[Charcoal lighter fluid|lighter fluid]] and prepares to grill, giving the idea that there will be a big explosion when Homer throws a [[match]] on it. When he does throw a match on it, however, it barely catches on fire. The joke originated from an older episode of ''The Simpsons'', "[[Treehouse of Horror]]", and Mirkin liked it so much that he decided to reuse it in this episode.<ref name="Mirkin"/> The same animation from the older episode was used, but they doubled the amount of lighter fluid Homer used to make the joke "even funnier".<ref name="Kirkland">{{cite video | people=Kirkland, Mark|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Vegetarian"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Linda's pupils are colored blue in the episode, which is quite unusual on ''The Simpsons'', as most of the characters have black pupils.<ref name="Kirkland"/> Kirkland decided to give her blue pupils because he thought Linda's blue eyes, which she had in real life, were beautiful.<ref name="Kirkland"/> Kirkland also decided to give McCartney brown pupils.<ref name="Kirkland"/>

==Cultural references==
The episode features several references to The Beatles and McCartney's [[Paul McCartney (solo)|solo career]]. For instance, McCartney tells Lisa that playing his song "[[Maybe I'm Amazed]]" backwards will reveal a secret recipe for lentil soup.<ref name="BBC"/> The song plays over the closing credits of the episode, and when played backwards, you can hear McCartney reciting the recipe in the song. Mirkin had McCartney record that for him, because it does not actually appear in the original song.<ref name="Mirkin"/> One of the backwards snippets says: "Oh, and by the way, I'm alive," which is a reference to the [[Paul is dead]] theory.<ref name="Mirkin"/><ref name="BBC"/> "Maybe I'm Amazed" is also played in the final scene of the episode, when Homer finds Lisa and apologizes to her.<ref name="Groening"/>

Apu tells Lisa: "I learned long ago to tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them. You know, you can influence people without badgering them always. It's like Paul's song, 'Live and Let Live'." Paul corrects Apu and says the song's title is actually "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]", to which Apu replies: "Well, whatever, whatever. It had a good rhythm."<ref name="book"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5937935/springfield_rock_city/print|title=Springfield, Rock City |last=Nawrocki|first=Tom |date=November 28, 2002|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2008-12-07}}</ref> Apu also refers to himself as the "[[fifth Beatle]]".<ref name="matthew"/> Linda rephrases the line "In an octopus's garden in the shade" from the Beatles' song "[[Octopus's Garden]]" when she appears in Apu's secret garden.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season7/page5.shtml|title=Lisa The Vegetarian|accessdate=2008-11-30|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref><ref name="blender"/>

Matthew Singer of the ''Ventura County Reporter'' said: "Some ''Simpsons'' nerds criticize the episode for its perceived preachiness, but it is overflowing with great individual scenes [...]" He went on to say that the Meat Council propaganda video "may be the funniest isolated segment in the history of the show". Singer added that he felt the Paul and Linda McCartney cameo was very shoehorned in, "but it's worth it to hear Apu refer to himself as the fifth Beatle."<ref name="matthew">{{cite web|url=http://www.vcreporter.com/cms/story/detail/?id=4967&IssueNum=134|title=The 5 most cromulent Simpsons episodes|last=Singer|first=Matthew|work=Ventura County Reporter|accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> John Serba of the ''[[Grand Rapids Press]]'' named "Lisa the Vegetarian" his favorite episode, "because the tale of Lisa's conversion to vegetarianism has more humorous scenes per square inch than any other episode".<ref>{{cite news|title='Simpsons' fans can watch, cheer for and quote 'em with the best|last=Serba|first=John|date=November 3, 2002 |work=[[Grand Rapids Press]]|page=F2|accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> Phil Dzikiy of the ''[[Niagara Gazette]]'' said the episode is his favorite of the show, and described it as "hilarious", "touching", and "satirical".

Dzikiy also thought that the propaganda film, "Meat and You: Partners in Freedom", is Troy McClure's "second-finest hour" on ''The Simpsons''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://niagara-gazette.com/nightandday/local_story_269095839.html|title=20 years - A 'Simpsons' extravaganza|last=Dzikiy|first=Paul|coauthors=Lane, Paul|date=September 25, 2008|work=[[Niagara Gazette]]|accessdate=2008-12-02}}</ref> The ''[[Daily Bruin]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Dan Crossen named the episode his favorite of the show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dailybruin.com/archives/id/21898/|title=Shift away from origins doesn<U+2019>t bode well for Tomorrow<U+2019>s Parties|last=Crossen|first=Dan|date=January 13, 2003|work=[[Daily Bruin]]|accessdate=2008-12-02}}</ref>

Jake Coyle of ''[[USA Today]]'' compared the episode to ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' and said that Homer's love for the pig [[List of animals in The Simpsons#Plopper|Plopper]] in the film is not his only "go-around" with a pig on the show. "Fans will recall his 'pig-de-la-resistance' in 'Lisa the Vegetarian', the excellent 1995 episode in which vegetarianism is tackled more successfully than pollution is in [the film]," he said.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2007-07-26-2252042673_x.htm|title='The Simpsons Movie' not exxxxxcellent|last=Coyle|first=Jake|date=July 26, 2007|work=USA Today|accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> Todd Gilchrist of [[IGN]] said in a review of the seventh season that he thinks the key to the show's longevity is its "sentimental but not gooey" approach to storytelling and character development, "more even than its inventive humor". He took "Lisa the Vegetarian" as an example, and said: "Lisa sabotages Homer's barbecue, which results in an unceremonious death for his prize pig. But rather than simply punctuating the episode with an iconic image of the porker soaring through the air, the writers actually develop a story into which the joke fits. The comedic effect is actually intensified because we care about the characters, are invested in the story, and primed for a great gag."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/676/676342p1.html|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season|last=Gilchrist |first=Todd|date=December 15, 2005|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref>
