'''''Coatit''''' was a [[protected cruiser]] of the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' built in the late 1890s. She was the second and final member of the {{sclass-|Agordat|cruiser|4}}. The ship, which was armed with twelve {{convert|76|mm|abbr=on}} guns and two {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes, was too slow and short-ranged to be able to scout effectively for the fleet, so her career was limited. She saw action during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in 1911&ndash;12, where she provided gunfire support to Italian troops in North Africa. She also caused a minor diplomatic incident from an attack on retreating Ottoman soldiers in [[Anatolia]]. ''Coatit'' was part of an international fleet sent to [[Constantinople]] when the city appeared to be at risk of falling to the [[Bulgarian Army]] during the [[First Balkan War]]. In 1919, she was converted into a [[minelayer]] and was sold for scrap in 1920.

==Design==
{{main|Agordat-class cruiser}}

''Coatit'' was {{convert|91.6|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|9.32|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|3.54|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced up to {{convert|1292|MT|sp=us}} at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of horizontal [[triple-expansion engine|triple-expansion]] [[steam engine]]s each driving a single [[screw propeller]], with steam supplied by eight [[Blechynden boiler|Blechynden]] [[water-tube boiler]]s. Her engines were rated at {{convert|8215|ihp|lk=in}} and produced a top speed of {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}}. The ship had a cruising radius of about {{convert|300|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. She had a crew of between 153&ndash;185.<ref name=G348/>

''Coatit'' was armed with a main battery of twelve {{convert|76|mm|abbr=on}} L/40 guns mounted singly. She was also equipped with two {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s. The ship was only lightly armored, with a {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} thick deck.<ref name=G348/>

==Service history==
The keel for ''Coatit'' was laid down at the [[Castellammare shipyard]] on 8 April 1897 and her completed hull was launched on 15 November 1899. After completing [[fitting-out]] work, the new cruiser was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 1 October 1900.<ref name=G348>Gardiner, p. 348</ref> She proved to be too slow and short-legged to be useful as a fleet scout, which limited her active duty career.<ref name=G348/> She served in the main fleet in 1903&ndash;1904, during which time the fleet was kept in a state of readiness for seven months. For the remaining five months, the ships had reduced crews.<ref>Garbett, p. 1069</ref> In 1904, the ship was transferred to the [[Red Sea]] and stationed in Italy's colony in [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] along with three other small vessels.<ref>"Naval Notes", p. 1429</ref> ''Coatit'' was assigned to the hostile force that was tasked with simulating an attempt to land troops on [[Sicily]] during the 1908 fleet maneuvers.<ref>Brassey, pp. 76&ndash;78</ref>

At the outbreak of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in September 1911, ''Coatit'' was stationed in the 4th Division of the 2nd Squadron, under Rear Admiral [[Paolo Thaon di Revel]], the commander of the division.<ref>Beehler, p. 9</ref> ''Coatit'' protected several [[battleship]]s and [[armored cruiser]]s while they bombarded the defenses of [[Tripoli]] on 3&ndash;4 October. ''Coatit'', the armored cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Varese||2}}, and sixteen [[destroyer]]s were tasked with patrolling the flanks of the bombardment force to prevent a surprise attack by the [[Ottoman Navy]], which did not materialize.<ref>Beehler, p. 19</ref> On 15 October, ''Coatit'' and her sister joined the battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Napoli||2}}, the armored cruisers {{ship|Italian cruiser|Pisa||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Amalfi||2}}, and {{ship|Italian cruiser|San Marco||2}}, three destroyers, and several troop transports for an attack on the port of [[Derna, Libya|Derna]]. Negotiators were sent ashore to attempt to secure the surrender of the garrison, which was refused. ''Napoli'' and the armored cruisers bombarded the Ottoman positions throughout the day, and on 18 October the Ottomans withdrew, allowing the Italian troops to come ashore and take possession of the port. The fleet remained offshore and helped to repel Ottoman counterattacks over the following two weeks.<ref>Beehler, p. 30</ref> On 3 October 1912, ''Coatit'' bombarded the port of [[Kalkan]]. She thereafter shelled an Ottoman infantry battalion in the area, which fled; she nevertheless continued to fire on the retreating troops, expending around 200&nbsp;rounds during the attack. The French cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Bruix||2}} was nearby and witnessed the attack, which her commander protested as a breach of international law.<ref>Beehler, pp. 94&ndash;95</ref>

''Coatit'' was among an international force that entered the Ottoman capital city, [[Constantinople]], during the [[First Balkan War]] in November 1912, less than a month after the end of the Italo-Turkish War. She and the battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Emanuele Filiberto||2}} entered the straits on 11 November, along with the French armored cruisers {{ship|French cruiser|Victor Hugo||2}} and {{ship|French cruiser|L<U+00E9>on Gambetta||2}}, where they joined a pair of British cruisers. Warships from Germany, including the [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben||2}}, Russia&mdash;the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Rostislav||2}}&mdash;and Spain arrived thereafter. The ships put a force of about 3,000 men ashore to protect their nationals, though by the end of the month, the Bulgarian advance on the city [[First Battle of <U+00C7>atalca|had been halted]]. The international fleet nevertheless remained in the [[Sea of Marmara]] for a time until it was withdrawn to the island of [[Crete]] and subsequently dispersed.<ref>Willmott, p. 181</ref> ''Coatit'' was converted into a [[minelayer]] in 1919. Eight of the 76&nbsp;mm guns and her torpedo tubes were removed and a pair of {{convert|12|cm|abbr=on}} L/40 guns were installed. She served only briefly in this role and she was sold to [[ship breaking|ship breakers]] on 11 June 1920.<ref name=G348/>
