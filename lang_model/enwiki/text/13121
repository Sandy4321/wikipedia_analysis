Bebb is a former [[Plaid Cymru]] activist and was chair of the party in [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarfon]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Times Guide to the House of Commons 2010, p87</ref> He defected to the Conservatives because of his [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] views.

Bebb first stood for the Conservatives in 2002 when he contested the safe Labour seat of [[Ogmore (UK Parliament constituency)|Ogmore]] in [[Ogmore by-election, 2002|2002 by-election]] caused by the death of the veteran MP [[Ray Powell (politician)|Sir Raymond Powell]].

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] he stood again in [[Conwy (UK Parliament constituency)|Conwy]], this time coming second behind Labour. 
In the 2010 general election, boundary changes led to the creation of a new constituency called Aberconwy, based on the former Conwy.
