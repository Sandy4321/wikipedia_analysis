'''Joe Johnson''' (born [[29 July]], [[1952]]) is an [[England|English]] former professional [[snooker]] player. He is most well known as the surprise winner of the [[World Snooker Championship 1986|1986]] [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]].

He reached the final of the World Amateur Snooker Championship in 1978, losing to [[Cliff Wilson]]. After becoming a professional in 1979, his most notable early achievement was to reach the final of the untelevised 1983 [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Professional Players Tournament]], which he lost 9-8 to [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]].

In 1986, Johnson arrived at the World Championship having never won a match at the [[Crucible Theatre]] and as a 150-1 outsider. He beat [[Terry Griffiths]] 13-12 in the quarter-finals after trailing 12-9, and then Knowles in the semi-finals. In the final he met world number 1 [[Steve Davis]] - then at the peak of his ability - and defied all odds to win 18-12, although Davis scored more points in total [http://www.thesnookerforum.com/board/showthread.php?t=6763]. A passionate fan of [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] football club, he wore a t-shirt with the slogan "Bradford's Bouncing Back" (a reference to the [[Bradford fire]] a year earlier) whenever he was not playing during the tournament.

Johnson's best showing during his season as world champion was a solitary semi-final, but he defied expectations at the [[World Snooker Championship 1987|1987 World Championship]] and reached his second final, again meeting Davis but this time losing 18-14. He reached number 5 in the world rankings in the [[Snooker world rankings 1987/1988|1987-88 season]], largely as a result of his success at the Crucible.

Johnson won the [[Scottish Masters (snooker)|Langs Scottish Masters]] in 1987, beating Terry Griffiths 9-7 in the final and taking his only other major snooker title. He rarely came close to repeating his successes, and rapidly descended the rankings, dropping out of the top 16 by [[Snooker world rankings 1990/1991|1991]] and the top 32 by the mid-1990s. His last appearance at the World Championship came in 1991. He suffered heart and eye problems during the 1990s, and retired from professional snooker at the end of the 2003/2004 season.

Johnson remains the player who came closest to beating the "[[Crucible Curse]]", in which no first-time world champion has ever successfully defended the title. Johnson's defence saw him both reach the final and come within 4 frames of victory. [[Ken Doherty]] also reached the final in 1998,a year after his first win at the crucible, but lost by a greater margin to [[John Higgins (snooker)|John Higgins]]. No other first-time champion has reached the final.

Johnson also won the Seniors [[Pot Black]] Trophy in 1997, beating Terry Griffiths in the final. He was also an early influence and friend of the snooker player [[Paul Hunter]]. He is now a commentator for Eurosport.
