'''Huntington's disease''', also known as '''Huntington's chorea''', is an incurable [[neurodegenerative disease|neurodegenerative]] [[genetic disorder]] that typically manifests itself first in middle age.  HD is the most common genetic cause of abnormal repetitive movements called [[Choreia (disease)|chorea]]. The first physical symptoms are usually noticed in patients between 35 and 44 years of age, but can begin at any age. The rare occasions when the disease begins before the age of 20 are classified as '''juvenile HD''' (also known as '''akinetic-rigid HD''' or '''Westphal variant HD'''), which progresses faster with slightly different symptoms. The disease is caused by a [[mutation]] in the [[Huntingtin]] gene, which normally provides the [[genetic code]] for a protein that is also called "huntingtin". The mutation results in a different form of the protein, which gradually damages specific areas of the brain, although the exact way it does this is not fully understood. HD is much less common in people of Asian or African descent than in people from Western Europe. [[Genetic testing]] for HD has been possible since the discovery of the gene that causes the disease. The genetic test can be performed before the onset of symptoms and on embryos, raising heated ethical debates. [[Genetic counseling]] has developed to aid individuals address these issues and has become a model for other genetically [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] diseases.

Because HD is inherited dominantly, an affected parent has a 50% chance of passing it to each child and the disease runs strongly in families, often affecting several generations. The exact way HD affects an individual varies, even between family members, but its symptoms progress similarly for most individuals. The earliest symptoms are a general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent, along with a decline in mental abilities and behavioral and [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] problems. Physical abilities are gradually impeded until coordinated movement becomes very difficult, and mental abilities generally decline into [[dementia]]. Although the disorder itself is not fatal, complications such as [[pneumonia]], [[heart disease]], and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy to around twenty years after symptoms begin. There is no cure for HD, and full-time care is often required in the later stages of the disease, but there are emerging treatments to relieve some of its symptoms.

[[support group|Self-help support]] organizations, first founded in the 1960s and increasing in number, have been working to increase public awareness, to provide support for individuals and their families, and to promote research. These organizations were instrumental in finding the gene in 1993. Since that time there have been important discoveries every few years and understanding of the disease is improving. Current research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the disease, improving [[animal models]] to expedite research, clinical trials of pharmaceuticals to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease, and studying procedures such as [[Stem cell treatments|stem cell therapy]] with the goal of repairing damage caused by the disease.

==Genetics==
<!-- Please note that although the disorder is spelt Huntington, the associated gene and protein are correctly spelt Huntingtin -->
All humans have the [[Huntingtin]] gene (''HTT''), which provides the genetic code to produce the [[protein]] [[Huntingtin#Protein|huntingtin]] (HTT). Part of this gene is a repeated section called a [[trinucleotide repeat disorder|trinucleotide repeat]], which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant, because either of a person's HTT genes being mutated causes the disease. It is not inherited according to gender, but the length of the repeated section of the gene, and hence its severity, can be influenced by the gender of the affected parent.<ref name="lancet221">{{cite journal |author=Walker FO |title=Huntington's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |page=221 |year=2007 |pmid=17240289 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1 }}</ref>

===Genetic mutation===
HD is one of several [[trinucleotide repeat disorder]]s which are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range.<ref name="lancet220">{{cite journal |author=Walker FO |title=Huntington's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |page=220 |year=2007 |pmid=17240289 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1 }}</ref> The ''HTT'' gene is located on the [[Locus (genetics)|short arm]] of [[chromosome 4 (human)|chromosome 4]].<ref name="lancet220"/> ''HTT''  contains a sequence of three [[DNA base]]s<U+2014>cytosine-adenine-guanine ([[Codon|CAG]])<U+2014>repeated multiple times (i.e. ...CAGCAGCAG...), known as a trinucleotide repeat.<ref name="lancet220"/> CAG is the [[genetic code]] for the [[amino acid]] [[glutamine]], so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a [[polyglutamine tract]] (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the ''PolyQ region''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Katsuno M, Banno H, Suzuki K, ''et al.'' |title=Molecular genetics and biomarkers of polyglutamine diseases |journal=Curr.

Generally, people have fewer than 36 repeated glutamines in the polyQ region which results in production of the [[cytoplasmic]] protein Huntingtin.<ref name="lancet220"/> However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results in the production of a protein which has different characteristics.<ref name="lancet220"/> This altered form, called mHTT (mutant HTT), increases the decay rate of certain types of [[medium spiny neurons|neuron]]. Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these type of neurons, and are affected accordingly.<ref name="lancet219"/> Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of the age at onset and the rate of progression of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD.<ref name="lancet220"/> 36<U+2013>40 repeats result in a reduced-[[penetrance]] form of the disease, with much later onset and slower progression of symptoms, which in some cases may not even appear.<ref name="lancet222">{{cite journal |author=Walker FO |title=Huntington's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |page=222 |year=2007 |pmid=17240289 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1 }}</ref> With very large repeat counts, HD has full penetrance and can occur under the age of 20, when it is then referred to as juvenile HD, akinetic-rigid, or Westphal variant HD.

===Inheritance===
[[Image:Autosomal Dominant Pedigree Chart2.svg|thumb|270px|right|alt=Diagram showing an father carrying the gene and an unaffected mother leading to some of their offspring being affected, those affected are also shown with some affected offspring, whilst those unaffected having no affected offspring|Huntington's disease is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion. The probability of offspring  inheriting an affected gene is 50% independent of gender, and the gene does not skip generations.]]

Huntington's disease has [[autosomal dominant]] inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits a copy of the gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant [[allele]]) from an affected parent.<ref name="lancet218"/> In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.<ref>{{cite book | last=Passarge | first=E | title=Color Atlas of Genetics | publisher=Thieme | edition=2nd | year=2001 | page=142 | isbn=0-86577-958-9 }}</ref>

Trinucleotide CAG repeats over 28 are unstable during [[DNA replication|replication]] and this instability increases with the number of repeats present.<ref name="lancet222"/> This usually leads to new expansions as generations pass ([[dynamic mutation]]s) instead of reproducing an exact copy of the trinucleotide repeat.<ref name="lancet220"/> This causes the number of repeats to change in successive generations, such that an unaffected parent with an "intermediate" number of repeats (28<U+2013>35), or "reduced penetrance" (36<U+2013>40), may pass on a copy of the gene with an increase in the number of repeats that produces fully penetrant HD.<ref name="lancet220"/> Such increases in the number of repeats (and hence earlier [[age of onset]] and severity of disease) in successive generations is known as genetic [[anticipation (genetics)|anticipation]].<ref name="lancet220"/> Instability is greater in [[spermatogenesis]] than [[oogenesis]],<ref name="lancet220"/> so maternally inherited alleles are usually of a similar repeat length, whereas paternally inherited ones have a higher chance of increasing in length and can exhibit the [[anticipation phenomenon]].<ref name="lancet220"/><ref>{{cite journal| author=Ridley RM, Frith CD, Crow TJ, Conneally PM| title=Anticipation in Huntington's disease is inherited through the male line but may originate in the female| journal=Journal of Medical Genetics| year=1988| volume=25| pages=589<U+2013>595| url=http://jmg.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/25/9/589| pmid=2972838| doi=10.1136/jmg.25.9.589}}</ref>  It is rare for Huntington's disease to be caused by a [[de novo mutation|new mutation]], where neither parent have over 36 CAG repeats.<ref name="pmid16965319">{{cite journal |author=Semaka A, Creighton S, Warby S, Hayden MR |title=Predictive testing for Huntington disease: interpretation and significance of intermediate alleles |journal=Clin.

The HTT protein interacts with over 100 other proteins, and appears to have multiple biological functions.<ref name="pmid15383276">{{cite journal |author=Goehler H, Lalowski M, Stelzl U, ''et al.'' |title=A protein interaction network links GIT1, an enhancer of huntingtin aggregation, to Huntington's disease |journal=Mol.

Damage mainly occurs in the [[striatum]], but as the disease progresses, other areas of the brain are also significantly affected. As the damage accumulates, symptoms associated with the functions of these brain areas appear. Planning and modulating movement are the main functions of the striatum, and difficulties with these are initial symptoms.<ref name="lancet221"/>

===HTT function===

It also acts as an [[Apoptosis|anti-apoptotic]] agent preventing [[programmed cell death]] and controls the production of [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]], a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during [[neurogenesis]]. HTT also facilitates [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicular]] transport and [[synapsis|synaptic transmission]] and controls neuronal [[Transcription (genetics)|gene transcription]].<ref name="HTTfunction"/> If HTT [[gene expression|expression]] is increased, [[brain cell]] survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when HTT expression is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT.<ref name="HTTfunction"/> In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease.<ref name="lancet221"/> It is currently concluded that the disease is not caused by [[haploinsufficiency|inadequate production]] of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.<ref name="lancet221"/>

HD affects specific areas of the brain.

The basal ganglia<U+2014>the part of the brain most prominently affected by HD<U+2014>play a key role in movement and behavior control.  Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are part of the cognitive [[executive function|executive system]]<ref name="pmid16496032"/> and the motor circuit.<ref name="pmid10923984"/> The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended  completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD.<ref name="pmid10923984">{{cite journal |author=Crossman AR |title=Functional anatomy of movement disorders |journal=J.

== Diagnosis ==
With the appearance of symptoms HD can be diagnosed clinically.<ref name="lancet218"/> Genetic testing can confirm if an individual carries an expanded copy of the gene, even before onset of symptoms, and can also be used for [[embryo]]nic testing. [[Genetic counseling]] is provided to advise and to guide an individual throughout the testing procedure and also in the consideration of the implications of having a confirmed diagnosis, on his or her pyschology and career, in family planning decisions, and on friends and family. Although the initial motivation of individuals at risk of inheriting HD for having a [[wiktionary:pre-symptomatic|pre-symptomatic]] test is strong, upon consideration, only a minority choose to do so.<ref name="lancet221"/>

A [[physical examination]], sometimes combined with a [[psychological examination]], can determine whether onset of the disease has begun.<ref name="lancet218"/> Excessive unintentional movements of any part of the body are often the reason for seeking medical consultation. If these are abrupt and have random timing and distribution, they suggest a diagnosis of HD. Cognitive or psychiatric symptoms are rarely the first diagnosed; they are usually only recognized in hindsight or when they develop further.

===Genetic===
{{See also|Genetic testing}}
Because a child of a parent with HD has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition, there is a strong motivation to resolve the uncertainty.

Because of the late age of symptom onset, Huntington's disease does not usually affect reproduction.<ref name="lancet221"/>  The [[prevalence]] is similar for men and women, but varies greatly geographically as a result of ethnicity, local migration and past immigration patterns.

Waters described 'a form of chorea, vulgarly called magrums', including accurate descriptions of the chorea, its progression, and the strong heredity of the disease.<ref name="OxfordMonographHistory">{{cite book |author=Harper P|chapter=Huntington's disease: a historical background |editor=Bates G, Harper P, and Jones L| title=Huntington's Disease - Third Edition| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=Oxford| year=2002| isbn=0-19-851060-8|pages= 3<U+2013>24}}</ref> In 1846 [[Charles Gorman(physician)|Charles Gorman]] observed how prevalence seemed to occur in localized regions.<ref name="OxfordMonographHistory"/> Both Gorman and Waters were students of Dungison at [[Jefferson Medical College]].<ref name="Wexler2008">{{cite book |title=The Woman Who Walked Into the Sea.

As [[Mendelian inheritance]] was being rediscovered at the turn of the century, HD was used tentatively as an example of autosomal dominant inheritance.<ref name="OxfordMonographHistory"/> In 1911 [[Charles Davenport]] made major contributions to understanding of the disease, proving that it was indeed autosomal dominant, and proceeding to document most of the inheritance variabilities like age of onset. He also described the range of psychiatric and physical symptoms, providing much of the framework for following research.<ref name="OxfordMonographHistory"/>
Davenport's interest was roused by his college friend [[Smith Ely Jelliffe]]'s own interest in HD's strong inheritance pattern.<ref name="Wexler2008"/> Jellife collected information from across [[New York State]] and published several articles regarding the genealogy of HD in [[New England]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jelliffe SE, Muncey EB, Davenport CB |title=Huntington's Chorea: A Study in Heredity |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=40|issue=12 |page=796 |year=1913|doi= |url=http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=info:s7u8s5gzl6oJ:scholar.google.com/&output=viewport&pg=1 }}</ref> This work was expanded upon in 1932 by [[P.

Research into the disorder continued progressively, and was given a major boost in 1983 when the US<U+2013>[[Venezuela]] [[Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project]] discovered the approximate location of a causal gene.<ref name="dnamark"/> This was the result of an extensive study begun in 1979, focusing on the populations of isolated Venezuelan villages of Barranquitas and Lagunetas, where there was an unusually high prevalence of the disease.

A [[transgenic]] mouse that could be made to exhibit HD was developed in 1996, this model is called the [[R6 line]].

Huntington's disease has tested society's ethics in various ways.
