{{For|the racehorse|Starcraft (horse)}}
'''''StarCraft''''' (SC) is a [[real-time strategy]] [[computer game]] by [[Blizzard Entertainment]]. Introduced in [[1998]], it was the best-selling computer game in that year and won the [[Origins Award]] for Best Strategy Computer Game of 1998. Blizzard estimated in 2005 that 9 million copies of ''StarCraft'' and its expansion pack, ''[[StarCraft: Brood War]]'' had been sold since its release [http://www.blizzard.com/press/051805-e3ghost.shtml ], and it has achieved an international cult-like status in the computer gaming world, especially in its online multiplayer form.

Although in a [[science fiction]] setting, ''StarCraft'' is broadly similar to Blizzard's popular game ''[[Warcraft II]].'' Developers tried greatly to steer the game away from being known as "[[Warcraft Universe|Warcraft]] in Space," eventually rewriting the entire [[game engine]]. The game's main storyline follows a war amongst three [[galaxy|galactic]] species: the human [[Terran (StarCraft)|Terrans]], the [[hive mind]]-sharing [[insect]]oid [[Zerg]], and the [[psychic]] [[humanoid]] [[Protoss]] warriors. It was initially released as a hybrid for Apple and PC platforms and later ported to the [[Nintendo 64]].

Though a best-seller all over the world, the game is especially popular in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], with nationally recognized tournaments, training groups, professional players, and televised cable-access competitions that often broadcast live tournaments.

==Basic gameplay==
<!-- Please keep this section as brief as possible. Only very important information directly related to basic gameplay should be added. Any other information may be added to the ''StarCraft'' Game play article in the first instance. -->

:''Main article: [[Gameplay of StarCraft]]'' 
Gameplay centers on acquisition and control of resources, which are necessary to construct combat units and buildings. It features two kinds of resources: [[Minerals (StarCraft)|minerals]] (required for nearly all units) and [[Vespene gas]] (required for non-basic units and [[upgrade]]s). Minerals appear as blue crystalline formations protruding from the ground and are 'harvested' or 'mined' by worker units ([[Space Construction Vehicle (StarCraft)|SCV]] for Terran, Drone for Zerg, Probe for Protoss) while Vespene gas appears as a geyser with green clouds erupting from it, and a certain structure (Refinery for Terrans, Extractor for Zerg, Assimilator for Protoss) must be constructed above it before SCVs/Drones/Probes can harvest Vespene Gas from it. In addition, players can create only a limited number of units (with the exception of the Zerg Overlord which is counted as a building for "supply/support" purposes): each unit has a "supply/support" rating roughly correlated with that unit's combat strength, and players must maintain enough unit-supporters (Supply Depots for Terrans, Pylons for the Protoss and Overlords for the Zerg) to support their forces. 

[[Image:Zergbase.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A Zerg base with three Hatcheries, and a Lair in its center.]]
Players construct a variety of unit types and buildings that provide specialized upgrades to defeat their computer or human opponents. Management of resources, expansion to control resource locations, and effective application of offensive and defensive combat tactics are the keys to victory. The unit types available to each race define its racial identity. The Protoss can field powerful and expensive warriors and machinery, while the Zerg rely on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm their opponents. The Terrans are the versatile and flexible alternative to both races, providing a compromise between specialization and [[combined arms]]. However, each race is very balanced, and a player using a different race than his or her opponent does not necessarily have an advantage over them.

{{seealso|StarCraft units and structures}}

==Basic gameplay improvements==
''StarCraft'' significantly improved upon ''[[Warcraft II]]'', an earlier Blizzard production, which was criticized for its two similar races: Warcraft II's races, like those of its predecessor Warcraft, had only minor differences in spells and upgrade costs. ''StarCraft'' rectified this by implementing decisive asymmetries in the game races, a concept pioneered by the [[Strategic Simulations, Inc.|Strategic Simulations]] game ''[[War Wind]]''.

Though the game's three races ([[Protoss]], [[Terran (StarCraft)|Terran]], and [[Zerg (StarCraft)|Zerg]]) were slightly imbalanced when the game was first released, the expansion pack and twenty [[Patch (computing)|patches]]<ref>''StarCraft'' versions are numbered 1.00 through 1.13f, including 1.12b, 1.11b, 1.09b and 1.08b. Information on changes introduced with each patch can be found on the Battle.net support site. [http://www.blizzard.com/support/?id=msc0411p#patch_information Patch Information site]</ref> (of which four affected the gameplay) have balanced the three races to most players' satisfaction. The ''Brood War'' expansion released by Blizzard in 1998 provided several new units for each race (which dramatically changed the gameplay) and a new campaign for each race, continuing the original ''StarCraft'' story (see [[StarCraft storyline]]). Some of the ''Brood War'' units such as Dark Templar were available in ''StarCraft'' at the beginning of single-player missions, but could not be produced. Many exclusive upgrades to each race's units were also created in Brood War.

==Multiplayer==
The game also includes [[Multiplayer game|multiplayer]] gaming on Blizzard's own [[Internet]] gaming service [[Battle.net]]. One can play against opponents, free of charge, beyond the original purchase of the game and local Internet access fees. Many fans enjoy playing in groups against computer-controlled opponents in skirmish games (this type of games is sometimes called  "comp[uter] stomp"). While more experienced players generally do not find the [[Game AI|AI]] challenging, decent early game performance can make it an enjoyable opponent for more casual players. Fans have also created maps that are advantageous to the computer and can be extremely hard to win.

For cooperative play, several people can play the same team (controlling the same units), or different teams that are "allied" so they do not harm each other. Up to eight spots can be filled in a game, either by players or computers.

[[StarCraft Clans|Clans]] are groups of people, who would play under accounts labelled with a "tag", usually two to three letters separated from their name by a dash or within brackets. The involvement in a clan ranges from casual friendship to mandatory meetings and tournaments.

In multiplayer gameplay, some players use modified, or "hacked" versions of the StarCraft [[client (computing)|client]] to gain an unfair advantage. Blizzard commonly bans "hackers" in all their games, and several third-party "anti-hack" programs are under constant development to prevent these techniques.

===Battle.net===
Most recreational, low-skill gaming takes place on Battle.net. This is also where the vast majority of "money maps", UMS ("[[Use Map Settings]]" - custom scenario maps) and "hackers" reside. Because the Battle.net Ladder tournament is considered to be corrupted by "hackers" beyond salvation, very little, if any competitive gaming takes place there. Instead, Battle.net is usually a practice place for the new or average player trying to get better. Sometimes, very experienced players called "smurfs" prey on newbies by making a new account that would be able to participate in a "noob game." Accounts are created in large numbers as a result of many players having multiple accounts administered to themselves.

===Private ladders===
Most competitive, high-level gaming takes place on "private" ladders such as "PGTour" or "WGTour". These ladders use a specific set of maps, mostly taken from Korean pro leagues like MSL and OSL, hack-preventing third-party programs, a team of administrators and sometimes even a private [[Server (computing)|server]] (such as the PGTour's Bnet-X) to try to enforce fair play. Private ladders usually do not allow "money maps", which puts them into stark contrast with Battle.net. Also, the players' average skill is better than in Blizzard's Battle.net.

==Single-player storyline==
{{main|StarCraft storyline}}
{{spoiler}}
<!-- Please keep it short. No mission-by-mission history, just an outline! -->
The plot of the original ''StarCraft'' game revolves around the [[Terran (StarCraft)|Terran]] civilization in the [[StarCraft universe#Koprulu Sector|Koprulu Sector]], which was founded by former prisoners exiled from Earth. The most powerful Terran faction is the [[Terran Confederacy]]. It is opposed by other factions, such as the terrorist organization "[[Sons of Korhal]]". The arrival of the [[Zerg]], led by the [[Zerg Overmind|Overmind]] and its [[Zerg Cerebrate|Cerebrates]], greatly complicates matters for the Terrans. The Zerg Swarm is itself closely followed by a [[Protoss]] fleet, led by [[High Templar]] Executor [[Tassadar]], which burns all worlds the Zerg infest.

After the Protoss destroy the [[Terran Confederacy|Confederate]] colony on [[Chau Sara]], the Zerg are used by the rebel organization Sons of Korhal, whose leader [[Arcturus Mengsk]] lures them to a number of Confederate installations using [[Psionic technology (StarCraft)|psi-emitter]]s to further his own goals. Mengsk acquires the services of General Edmund Duke, a Confederate general, and sacrifices his right-hand woman, the psychic [[Sarah Kerrigan]], to the Zerg after she begins to object to his morals and tactics. This action alienates another of his followers, [[Jim Raynor]], who, along with the unnamed commander played by the player, flees from Mengsk with a small number of soldiers.

After the Confederacy's fall, Arcturus Mengsk reorganizes the Terran worlds he controls into the [[Sons of Korhal#Terran Dominion|Terran Dominion]], crowning himself Emperor. Meanwhile, the Zerg flee to the planet [[Char (StarCraft)|Char]] with their prize, Kerrigan, who is in the process of becoming a Zerg in a cocoon under the protection of a Cerebrate under player control.

Tassadar discovers that he can disrupt the Overmind's control over the Swarm by eliminating its Cerebrate servants with the help of the [[Dark Templar]], a group of Protoss who have forsaken their ancestral psionic powers and the religion of the [[Khala]]. While on Char, [[Tassadar]] encounters one of the Overmind's newest servants, the recently infested [[Sarah Kerrigan#Rebirth|Kerrigan]], a powerful psychic. The involvement of the fallen Dark Templar will prove to be fateful; indeed, while slaying the Cerebrate [[List of minor characters in the StarCraft universe#Zasz|Zasz]], the Dark Templar leader [[Zeratul]] briefly comes in psychic contact with the Overmind, which is then informed of the Protoss home-world [[Aiur]]'s location and directs its Swarm towards the Protoss world. This contact also gives [[Zeratul]] knowledge of the origin of the Zerg.

The Zerg inflict a number of heavy defeats upon the Protoss, who fight back bitterly, but are simultaneously involved in a civil war between the Protoss high authority, the [[Protoss Conclave|Conclave]], and the alliance between [[Tassadar]] and the [[Dark Templar]], with whom the player's character is aligned. In a desperate attempt to put an end to the Zerg's destructive rampage, Tassadar, Zeratul, and the remaining Protoss unite their strengths with [[Terran (StarCraft)|Terran]] forces and attack the Overmind itself. They manage to crush its outer shell, and Tassadar sacrifices himself and rams the ship into the vulnerable form of the Overmind, thereby killing it and himself in the process.

===Influences===
While it has many similarities with its conceptual predecessor ''Warcraft II'', ''StarCraft'' also draws heavily from characters and scenarios taken from many [[science fiction]] works, most notably popular movies, and the [[Warhammer 40,000]] table-top gaming series from [[Games Workshop]]. For example, many characteristic elements of the Terran race in ''StarCraft'' are reminiscent of James Cameron's ''[[Aliens (1986 film)|Aliens]]'' movie, however many elements such as the Terran Marines and Firebats appear nearly identical in appearance to Warhammer 40,000's [[Space Marines]]. Terran buildings much resemble the installations of the Hadley's Hope colony in ''Aliens''; the resemblance is especially obvious in ''StarCraft's'' cutscenes (see cutscene ''The Amerigo''). Terran Marines were also clearly inspired by ''Aliens'' [[United States Colonial Marines|USCM]] Marines; both the Terran Marine and the Terran Dropship units in ''StarCraft'' directly quote characters from the movie. The Gauss Rifle used by the Terran Marines has an LED digital ammo display much like the [[M41A pulse rifle]] from ''Aliens''. The Zerg and their infestation process are also reminiscent of Aliens' ''[[Xenomorph (Alien)|Xenomorphs]]'' and [[Warhammer]]'s [[Tyranids]]. The game also displays many elements from the novel ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' by Robert Heinlein, as well as some general themes of [[military science fiction]] and [[space opera]]. There are also noticeable similarities between the "brain bug" of ''Starship Troopers'', the norn queen and hivemind of the Tyranids and the Zerg Overmind. The [[Xel'Naga]], a key race in the [[StarCraft Universe]], are also very reminiscent of the "Creators" in the [[Guyver]] series. The Creators, like the Xel'naga, created and experimented with races of powerful warriors for their own selfish reasons. They were also eventually overcome by their own powerful creations just as the Zerg did with the Xel'Naga.

Because of its vast popularity, ''StarCraft'' has become extremely influential in the computer and video gaming fields. In the years immediately following its release, it came to be considered by some "the standard by which all [[real-time strategy]] games were judged". <ref>{{note_label|Gamespot|2|a}}Gamespot. [http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-5.html The Greatest Games of All Time]</ref>

In July 2005 the game ''StarCraft'' was quoted by a French study published in the CIEAEM 57 's proceedings (International Commission for the Study and Improvement of Mathematics Education) as a game that could be used to promote the learning of mathematics (Aberkane I. J. "d<U+00E9>tournement du jeu vid<U+00E9>o <U+00E0> des fins p<U+00E9>dagogiques, l'affect, l'acquisition de r<U+00E8>gles et la compr<U+00E9>hension d'un syst<U+00E8>me de r<U+00E8>gles", proceedings of the CIEAEM 57, 144-153 ).

==Culture==
===Popularity in South Korea===

Even as of 2004, StarCraft is still one of the most popular online games in the world. The game itself has its own culture, similar to Slashdot's and other Massive Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG) communities.

In the early 2000s, the game received an explosive popularity among South Korean online gamers, to the point of being (only somewhat exaggeratedly) referred to as the national sport of South Korea by some avid gamers. Most active StarCraft players now come from South Korea.

In South Korea, StarCraft professional gamers, such as SlayerS_`BoxeR`, Iloveoov, Reach [NC]...YellOw, [9]eVERLAST and Nal_rA are celebrities: their games are broadcast over several television channels such as MBC Game, Ongamenet, and iTV. While a select few have become reasonably wealthy through this (for example, one highly successful player, known in-game as SlayerS_`BoxeR`, signed a 1 year, ~$200,000 contract in 2004), and some can earn a decent to good living from TV-contracts, sponsoring and tournament prizes, the lower-echelon pro players tend to subsist on relatively small wages. However, there are many pros from the online channels like isLuforever who are progamers in their own right. These online players often have a more diverse level of gameplay, as they're constantly playing different people, and evolving their strategies. People flock from all over to play these players. Many pro gamers play StarCraft pretty much every waking hour in order to maintain preparation for the highly competitive leagues. Superior StarCraft and Warcraft III players are called gosu, a Korean word meaning "highly skilled". South Korea is an example of how e-sports can have a social status similar to physical sports.

Also of note is the semi-infamous Operation CWAL (Can't Wait Any Longer). More than just a simple cheat to decrease unit build time, Operation CWAL formed in 1997, as a writers group, in the StarCraft Suggestions Forum in an attempt to "liberate" a final copy of StarCraft, which appeared obviously completed despite numerous delays on the part of Blizzard Entertainment. Blizzard Entertainment has gone as far as to give special thanks to this group in the manual for StarCraft, as well as including their name as a cheat code in the game.

While not incredibly active today, Operation CWAL remains as one of Blizzard Entertainment's older and more loyal fan groups. Many CWALers are waiting for release information regarding another RTS in the StarCraft universe.

===Novels and eBooks===
StarCraft even became an inspiration for the creation of official novels and [[ebook|eBook]]s. Four novels were officially authorized by Blizzard Entertainment, and two more will follow:
* ''[[StarCraft: Uprising]]'' (2000) ISBN B00005AS12 (eBook only)
* ''[[StarCraft: Liberty's Crusade]]'' (2001) ISBN 0671041487
* ''[[StarCraft: Shadow of the Xel'Naga]]'' (2001) ISBN 0671041495
* ''[[StarCraft: Speed of Darkness]]'' (2002) ISBN 0671041509
* ''[[StarCraft: Queen of Blades]] ISBN 0743471334
* ''[[StarCraft Ghost: Nova]] (to be released December 2006)'' ISBN 0743471342

In addition, Blizzard Entertainment authorized two short stories in [[Amazing Stories]] magazine, entitled [[StarCraft: Hybrid]] and [[StarCraft: Revelations]].

Blizzard also licensed [[Wizards of the Coast]] to publish ''[[StarCraft Adventures]]'', a supplement for the [[role-playing game]] ''[[Alternity]]'' set in the StarCraft universe.

Numerous [[fan fiction]] works also take place in the ''StarCraft'' universe.

===Custom scenarios===
[[Image:Staredit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''StarEdit'']]
The game is packaged with a campaign and map editor called ''StarCraft Campaign Editor'' (also known as StarEdit). The Campaign Editor has many features, including a trigger system that allows users to make radical changes to the way a map works, readily giving gamers the ability to create custom map scenarios. Thousands of custom scenarios are available, giving the game a refreshing variety. The ''StarCraft'' map-making community has also constructed additional editors or functionalities that grant the user even more power to modify the game.

====Melee Maps====
Scenarios are generally one of two types- melee or [[Use Map Settings]] (UMS). Melee games start all players at a random location with only their main base building (command center, hatchery, or nexus) and four mining units. This is the most popular type of game and is generally the only type used in tournaments. Ladder games also use this start scheme. 
Most melee games are played on maps called "BGH" maps, BGH being an acronym for "Big Game Hunters". In these maps, initial mineral and gas deposits are set to the 50,000 unit cap (or, in user-edited maps, sometimes higher) in order to obviate the need to take expansion sites and gain map control. There is a widespread perception that "BGH" and other so-called "money maps" fail to challenge development of build order and expansion-taking skills, and that these maps are therefore favorites of weaker players. Defenders of money maps claim that the game remains strategic and skill-based even without the need to expand. 

Some optimized versions of BGH such as "Fastest Possible Map Ever" and "StarCraft Dream" have similar placment of bases but are hacked so that 30 to 40 minerals (or in the case of "Fastest Possible Map Ever", 50,000) are placed directly next to the base. This greatly decreases the time needed to mine minerals and changes the game dynamic as once the default base is destroyed it cannot be rebuilt in the same place.

Zero Clutter (ZC, 0clut) maps are a slightly different version of optimized maps, they are organized in two groups of 2 or 3 bases in the north and south. Players tell each other where they are located as the game starts and ally players that are adjacent to them. Often there is an agreement between players that no side will attack the other before a set time limit or before "map max" (MM) (1650 units) a point at which the game cannot place any more units into play. There is then no other option but to attack.

====Use Map Stettings====
[[Use Map Settings|UMS]] games are less structured and often incorporate liberal use of specialized triggers and setups to change gameplay. UMS scenarios with sets of rules, objectives, and units entirely different from those of "regular" ''Melee'' games have been created. 

Some custom scenarios are named after television shows (''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]''), real-world events ([[Napoleonic Wars]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], the [[American Civil War]]), current events (Bomb [[Iraq]], [[World Trade Center]] Defense, [[Tsunami]] Run!), scenes from books and movies (''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Dawn of the Dead]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]], [[Starship Troopers]]''), or even other games ([[Diablo II]], [[The Sims]], [[Resident Evil]], [[Warcraft]], [[The Thing]], [[Risk (game)|Risk]], [[Russian Roulette]].)

There are also many 'genres' that have surfaced. This includes Defence maps, ''[[StarCraft Diplomacy]]'', RPG's and many others. Though varying in popularity, each one has its own unique set of characteristics.

The popularity of custom maps is not limited to only custom maps played online. StarEdit allows the mapmaker to "link" several maps, single player "campaigns" (long scenarios played out over several maps, hence the name) have become prominent in the community. Following the revolutionary [[Antioch Chronicles]]' lead, many campaigns include [[StarCraft mod|modifications]] to the game that add new "heroes" (i.e. the mapmakers create new art files to be imported in to StarCraft, thus creating completely new units and characters - something which can't be done using StarEdit). Popular campaigns include Campaign Creations' ''Legacy of the Confederation'', ''Life of a Marine'', and StarCraft.org's official campaigns: ''The Shifters'' and ''Fields of Ash''.

More powerful, third-party alternatives to the editor StarCraft is sold with, including the ''StarCraft X-tra Editor,'' ''Staredit,'' ''StarForge,'' and ''SCMDraft'' allow users to "stack" multiple mineral fields and buildings on top each other, change player colors, use hidden AI scripts, protect maps from common theft, run sizeless sounds directly from the ''StarCraft'' disc, change the color of text, compress their map, and in more advanced areas, place raw [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], sprite-units and disabled units, among other things.

Some of these custom maps and campaigns are released commercially via third parties, two of which are ''StarCraft: Insurrection'' and ''StarCraft: Retribution''. These third party add-ons did not fare well and were criticized for poor mission designs.

===Replays, audio commentaries, and VODs===
[[Image:StarcraftScreenshot.png|right|232px|thumbnail|Replay-Screenshot Zerg vs. Terran StarCraft: Brood War]]
From version 1.08 ''StarCraft'' enables the player to record a game and save it as a ''replay'', which can then be viewed with any other copy of ''StarCraft'', displaying the entire course of the game. As of 2006, there are many websites that host replays of players with different skill levels, though pro-level replays are relatively rarely released, for reasons of team secrecy and because the policies of pro leagues forbid it in some cases. Many applications, such as [[BWChart]] and Lasgo's Observer Pack<ref>Team Liquid. 2003. [http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=9999 Lasgo's Observer Pack]</ref>, have been developed by fans to analyze replays in detail, and compute statistics such as the number of actions per minute ([[Actions per minute|APM]]).

One of the most useful features of replays is the ability for people to snoop in on tactics of good players.

Replays are sometimes accompanied by an audio commentary recorded by the player or an experienced observer during the game, or after the fact, as they were watching the replay. This can be particularly interesting for people new to the game, who can learn from more experienced players pointing out things about a replay they would not have seen on their own, or simply for entertainment. The audio files can be produced and played separately from the replays using third-party audio recording and playback tools, in which case the viewer has to manually synchronize the audio track with the replay, which is read from the StarCraft application. Alternatively, auxiliary applications such as RWA can be used to ensure synchronization. The RWAtools<ref>BWChart.com. 2003. [http://www.bwchart.com/us/rwa.php RWAtools]</ref> are a set of freeware tools, that create valid replay files, additionally containing an [[Ogg]] audio stream. During replays, the commentary is kept in sync with the game.

'''VODs''' (from "Video On Demand") are videos that show the screen of a commentator (or sometimes player) during a (usually) pro-level game. They are (legally or not) available from a variety of websites, and are ripped from Korean television or Internet streams. They usually come in the [[Advanced Streaming Format|ASF]] video file format for [[Windows Media Player]] or in the [[Windows Media Video|WMV]] format. Because they are compressed with an [[MPEG-4]] codec and the file size needs to be small, there is a significant quality loss in comparison to watching a replay. VODs are usually accompanied by enthusiastic announcing from the Korean commentators, and the occasional crowd shot.

===Trivia===
*On [[10 August]] [[2005]], it was reported that a 28-year-old man named [[Lee Seung Seop|Lee]](screenname b0f1000) from Taegu, South Korea died from exhaustion after playing a 49-hour marathon session of StarCraft in an internet cafe. His friends had visited him in the cafe after his mother reported him missing. Lee told them that he would finish the game and go home. He died a few minutes later. Lee had also previously been fired from a job for playing games at work. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1729573,00.html] <!-- Other links to the story [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4137782.stm], [http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/theworld/2005/August/theworld_August295.xml&section=theworld&col=], [http://www.kplctv.com/Global/story.asp?S=3703646] -->

*When [[NASA]]'s shuttle mission, [[STS-96]], blasted off in May of 1999, Mission Specialist and StarCraft fan, [[Daniel T. Barry]], brought along a copy of StarCraft. The game CD, along with autographed images of the crew and mission, now resides at Blizzard's home office after having orbited the Earth 153 times and traveling 3.5 million nautical miles [http://www.blizzard.com/starcraft/sis/].

*For reasons the game's story does not say, the greater part of the Terran units have heavy country accents and confederate, rebel stereotyped personalities as evidenced by such dialogue as the Marines entreaty to "Gimme sum'in ta shoot," as with other cutscenes such as: (after running over a strange alien) "Looks lahke you mashed sum pore feller's dawg, Sarge." "It's a zerglin', Lester, smallah tahyp o' the Zerg". In other scenes, the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] battle flag (the "[[stars and bars]]") is seen on various Terran vehicles and structures, including a Battlecruiser.

*Many units, such as the Zerg Lurker, have different abilities and traits in the official guide than what they are actually played as.

*Several StarCraft maps, especially those showcased in the shareware version, include a vault with a "13" painted on the doors. This is a reference to the computer game [[Fallout]].

*There are 7 Starcraft action figures.  The orignal figures were a hydralisk, marine, and zealot.  The second set of figures were a firebat, hydralisk (new model), and a dark templar (Tassadar).  The seventh figure was a rare promotional send away red colored marine that has been named "warpig." 

[[image:Starcraftboxes.jpg|right|thumb|Starcraft had three released boxes.]]
*The PC version of the game was released with three different boxes.  The Protoss box was common, with a T rating.  The Zerg and Terran boxes were rare and both stamped with M ratings.

==StarCraft 64==
[[Image:Starcraft64.jpg|thumb|right|''StarCraft 64'' box.]]
On [[June 16]], [[1998]], ''StarCraft 64'' was released for the [[Nintendo 64]]. The game featured all of the maps from the original game and the ''Brood War'' expansion, as well as some exclusive missions (two different tutorials and [[StarCraft Secret Missions#Resurrection IV|StarCraft Resurrection IV]] [http://www.gamespot.com/n64/strategy/starcraft64/review.html]). 

The cursor movement was controlled by the analog stick on the center of the controller, but the game was not as popular as the PC version, perhaps because of a greater difficulty in controlling the cursor compared to the use of a mouse, and the lack of online multiplayer (split-screen was available, however). Also, speech was not present during mission briefings.

==Sequel==
Fans impatiently await the creation of ''[[StarCraft II]]''. Blizzard has announced that they are interested in making a sequel to their popular game, and there is some evidence that they are doing so. This includes posts by Blizzard officials on the [[Battle.net]] forums asking for suggestions for such a game, the lack of other projects for Blizzard after ''[[World of Warcraft]]'s'' completion, and an [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] unlocked after completing ''[[Warcraft III]]'' on the most difficult setting, as well as a leak about a 2007 release from [[HanbitSoft]], the Korean publisher of ''StarCraft''. Job advertisements on Blizzard.com looking for a "Game Balance Designer" with experience in StarCraft and Warcraft 3[http://www.blizzard.com/jobopp/designer-game-balance.shtml] also suggest that Blizzard is working on another RTS, most likely StarCraft 2 (though possibly Warcraft 4 or a new franchise). However, development of a sequel has not yet been officially announced.

Blizzard had been working on a [[first-person shooter]]/[[third-person shooter]], ''[[StarCraft: Ghost]]'' to be released in 2006. It was originally planned on being released in late 2003 but the company that was given the license was scrapped; the change in genre for the franchise from [[real-time strategy]] to [[third-person shooter]] and absence of a PC version aroused considerable protests among many of the ''StarCraft'' faithful, though others eagerly anticipate the game. In March of 2006 ''StarCraft: Ghost'' development was put on hold indefinitely[http://xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/starcraft-ghost/698419p1.html], leaving the future of the franchise unknown.
