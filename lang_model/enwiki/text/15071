'''''The Bends''''', released on [[13 March]] [[1995]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and on [[4 April]] [[1995]] in the [[United States]], is the second studio [[album]] released by the [[England|English]] [[Rock music|rock]] [[Musical ensemble|band]] [[Radiohead]]. The album was dedicated to the late comedian [[Bill Hicks]].<ref name="BILLHICKSDEDICATION">The 100 Greatest Albums Of All Time - Channel 4 (E4) 27th October 2007</ref>  The album contains singles "[[High and Dry]]", "[[Fake Plastic Trees]]", "[[Just (song)|Just]]", "[[My Iron Lung]]", and "[[Street Spirit (Fade Out)]]".

==Musical style==
While Radiohead's debut, ''[[Pablo Honey]]'', was a more traditional [[post-grunge]], upbeat rock album, ''The Bends'' showed some movement toward the [[art rock]] that was soon to be explored (though this went largely unnoticed at the time).  ''The Bends'' balances such hard-rocking songs as "[[Just (song)|Just]]" and "[[My Iron Lung]]" with slow and atmospheric ballads such as "[[Street Spirit (Fade Out)]]" and "[[High and Dry]]".  Meanwhile, songs like "Planet Telex" showed increased experimentation with [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] textures. That song also led the band to commission their first remixes, which appeared as b-sides. In contrast, "My Iron Lung" displayed heavily distorted screamed vocals and [[guitar solo]]ing, but with a multi-part song structure, tempo changes and loud-to-soft dynamics, all of which marked a change from their previous rock sound. ''The Bends'' also brought the group a wider audience with [[single (music)|singles]] like "High and Dry", "[[Fake Plastic Trees]]" and the hypnotic "Street Spirit (Fade Out)", the latter a surprise hit which earned Radiohead's highest UK chart placement to that date.

The band credited producer [[John Leckie]] ([[The Stone Roses]], [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], [[Pink Floyd]]) with allowing them the freedom to do things their own way on ''The Bends''. Trying to follow-up the success of their 1992 single "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]" with further hits, the band also developed their style in more subtle directions after the over-the-top sound of their debut ''[[Pablo Honey]]''. Lead guitarist [[Jonny Greenwood]] said, "We did what we wanted for our second album, and we ignored all advice, unlike the first record."<ref name="GREENWOOD">Jonny Greenwood interview. Jan 29 1998 [http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=1998&cutting=54]</ref> Key influences cited by the band during the recording were [[Jeff Buckley]], [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]], [[Morrissey]], [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]] and the [[Pixies]]. The band also [[cover version|covered]] songs by [[Carly Simon]] and [[Tim Buckley]] during this period.

==Reception==
Radiohead were already on their way to stardom thanks to the huge success of the single "Creep" from their first LP ''[[Pablo Honey]]'', especially in the [[United States]]. ''The Bends'' met with much stronger acclaim from critics, appearing on many end-of-year lists in 1995. Within the UK, it assured Radiohead's role as a standard-bearer of "indie" Brit-rock bands.<ref>Guardian, 1997. [http://www.geocities.com/sulkygirl_23/rh_files/okc/ok_guardian.html]</ref> The album came out during the height of the '90s [[Britpop]] movement, benefiting from renewed press attention to British guitar music. However, in the band's home country, Radiohead's music was rarely grouped with [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] and other so-called "Britpop" acts, instead receiving some acclaim for diverging from the fashionable aspects of the scene.

While it was only an under-the-radar [[alternative rock|alternative]] success in America, where none of its singles caught on (the album eventually reached #88 on the [[Billboard 200|Billboard]] charts in 1996, the band's lowest ever showing), in the UK ''The Bends'' remains a bestseller.  In summer 1995, Radiohead toured as an opening act for [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]] playing songs from ''The Bends'' and extending their popularity with a mass audience.

The band commissioned surreal music videos (including an award-winning clip for "Just") which received airplay worldwide. Among the videos released to promote the album was an enigmatic clip for "Just", directed by filmmaker [[Jamie Thraves]], which remains one of the most talked about rock videos of the 1990s. [[Jonathan Glazer]], who would go on to work with the band on "[[Karma Police]]", created a dreamlike and award-winning black-and-white video for "Street Spirit". The band also worked with [[Jake Scott (director)|Jake Scott]] on "Fake Plastic Trees", a video that depicts the band being pushed around a neon supermarket. These, along with a ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''-inspired video for "High and Dry", were released later on the home video and DVD ''[[7 Television Commercials]]'', along with several taken from ''[[OK Computer]]''.

''The Bends'' had an influence on the subsequent generation of British pop bands. In 2006, ''[[The Observer]]'' listed it as one of "the 50 albums that changed music", saying, "Radiohead's Thom Yorke popularised the angst-laden falsetto, a thoughtful opposite to the chest-beating lad-rock personified by Oasis's [[Liam Gallagher]]. Singing in a higher octave-range and falsetto voice to a backdrop of churning guitars became a much-copied idea, however, one which eventually coalesced into an entire decade of sound. Without this, [[Coldplay]] would not exist, nor [[Keane (band)|Keane]], nor [[James Blunt]]".<ref>"The 50 albums that changed music." The Observer, July 16, 2006. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1821230,00.html]</ref> Radiohead members said they later distanced themselves from their mid '90s sound partly because they felt little affinity for those that adopted the sound.

''The Bends'' took second place behind Radiohead's ''OK Computer'' in both 1998 and 2006 reader polls of ''[[Q magazine]]'' for the best album of all time. {{RS500|110}} Rolling Stone initially gave the album an average rating. In 2006 ''The Bends'' was placed at number 22 in [[Channel 4]]'s listener-voted list of the all-time best albums.

==Themes==
According to the band, ''The Bends'' also marked the start of a gradual turn in [[Thom Yorke]]'s songwriting from personal angst to the more cryptic lyrics and social and global themes which would come to dominate the band's later work. Although most of the album was seen to continue the lyrical concerns of ''Pablo Honey'', albeit in more mature fashion, the songs "Fake Plastic Trees" and in particular "Street Spirit" (together with that single's popular, more experimental [[b-side]] "Talk Show Host"), are often seen as a precursor to their next album ''[[OK Computer]]''.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

The album's title, which refers to [[decompression sickness]], is one of many references to physical illness and brokenness on the album, but has also been seen to tie into the band's own career trajectory. According to one biography, "For their second album, Radiohead chose an extremely symbolic title... Radiohead rose too soon (due to the success of 'Creep', which they were hardly prepared for) and had to suffer the unpleasant consequences (critical backlash, record company pressure, general confusion and dismay about how to continue meaningfully)."<ref>Randall, Mac. ''Exit Music: The Radiohead Story'' Omnibus Press, 2000.</ref>

''The Bends'''s lyrics, particularly those of "My Iron Lung", were cited in the British music press as an example of Thom Yorke's alleged [[Clinical depression|depression]]. ''[[Melody Maker]]'' ran an article during ''The Bends'' period suggesting Thom would be the next "rock 'n roll martyr" or suicide, a la [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Richey James]].<ref>"Headcases." ''Melody Maker'', June 1995. [http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=1995&cutting=27]</ref>

Jonny Greenwood said, <blockquote>It's funny, on one side ['Creep'] sped things up for us, because... we never felt that Radiohead was successful, we felt 'Creep' was successful, but it got our name put about, so that sped things up for us. But at the same time it meant that we recorded our second album about a year late, ''The Bends'', most of it was written within months of recording our first record, and we had to tour and tour and we couldn't stop to record. So that slowed things down for us.<ref name="GREENWOOD"/></blockquote>

==Production and artwork==
''The Bends'' was the first Radiohead album to include production assistance from engineer [[Nigel Godrich]], though its main producer was [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]] veteran [[John Leckie]]. It was also the first of the band's full length records with artwork by [[Stanley Donwood]], in collaboration with Thom Yorke, who went under the name "The White Chocolate Farm" (later shortened to Tchock). Originally Yorke had wanted to use an image of an [[iron lung]] as the cover, but he lost it.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The eventual album cover was created at the last minute by morphing a Donwood photograph of a medical dummy with Yorke's own face. It is also the last Radiohead album whose liner notes and artwork include pictures of the band members. ''The Bends'' is one of a minority of the band's albums to be recorded mostly in a traditional recording studio.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=April 2008}}
* "Planet Telex" was recorded when [[Thom Yorke|Thom]] was drunk after they had all gone out to a restaurant because the catering staff at RAK [studios] were having a day off. Thom was said to be slumping on the floor and a microphone was placed near his mouth. This also was the only song written in the [[recording studio]]. The song's title was originally going to be "Planet [[Xerox]]", but this was changed to avoid legal issues.
* "High and Dry" was originally played by Thom's band at [[Exeter University]], the [[Headless Chickens (UK band)|Headless Chickens]]. However, the Radiohead version came to being after drummer [[Phil Selway]] was testing his new bass drum. The song was demo-recorded before ''Pablo Honey'' came out, and the band had no plans to release it on their next album until receiving record label pressure. In 2006, Thom Yorke said it was the only time he had had his "arm twisted", to "put it anywhere". In 1998, Jonny Greenwood said, "Seems like there's always a song or two on every album, which is kind of a dead end, and isn't going anywhere... I always felt that 'High and Dry' on The Bends was a good pop song, and is alright, but it felt like it was the end of something, like we'd finished that kind of thing."<ref name="GREENWOOD"/>
* The Bends was first performed in February 1993. This could mean that the song was actually a candidate to be included in "[[Pablo Honey]]".{{Fact|date=January 2008}}
* For "Fake Plastic Trees" producer Paul Kolderie missed a cue during the final verse (the distorted guitars were meant to come in at the beginning of the bar), but the result was so pleasing that the mistake was left on the final mix. The song also was partly inspired by the commercial development of [[Canary Wharf]].
* The lead vocal take of "Fake Plastic Trees" was recorded immediately after the band had seen [[Jeff Buckley]] playing upstairs at The Garage in London. Thom went straight to the studio after the concert and recorded the vocal in two takes.
* "My Iron Lung" was the band's response to the popularity of its song "Creep". 
* The second of screaming feedback that can be heard in the second chorus of "Black Star" (at the 2:00 minute mark) was actually a mistake made during recording, but was kept due to Thom and Jonny's insistence.
* "Sulk" was written as a response to the [[Hungerford massacre]].
* According to Thom Yorke, "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" was inspired by the book ''[[The Famished Road]]'' by [[Ben Okri]]. (Though Thom has said he was merely a catalyst for the song's writing. That it would eventually have itself be written by someone if not him.)
