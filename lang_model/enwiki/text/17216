'''''Sliders''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[science fiction]] [[television program|television series]] that ran for five seasons from [[1995 in television|1995]] to [[2000 in television|2000]]. The series focuses on a group of travelers who "slide" between [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel worlds]] by use of a [[wormhole]] referred to as an "[[Sliders#Vortex|Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky bridge]]."

The first three seasons of ''Sliders'' were shown by the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]]. It was originally canceled after the first season, which was broadcast from March 22, 1995 to May 17, 1995, but was brought back for a second season after much fan protest, from March 1, 1996 to July 12, 1996. A third season was broadcast from September 20, 1996 to May 16, 1997. The [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]] produced the fourth season (June 8, 1998<U+2014>April 23, 1999) and fifth season (from June 11, 1999<U+2014>February 4, 2000), but announced in July 1999 that ''Sliders'' had been canceled, and that there would not be a sixth season. The last new episode first aired on December 29, 1999 in the [[United Kingdom]] and finally aired on the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]] on February 4, 2000.

The show was produced by [[Robert K. Weiss]] and [[Tracy Torm<U+00E9>]], son of singer [[Mel Torm<U+00E9>]] (Mel Torm<U+00E9> appeared in an episode as an alternate version of himself).

The series was filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] in its first two seasons. The filming of the show moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] for the last three seasons.

== Changing themes ==
The nature of the show changed throughout the seasons. The first two seasons focused on [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate histories]] and social norms, with the consensus amongst the creative team maintaining these two seasons to be largely superior to what would come later on during the series' third season.<ref name=Finch>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.earth62.net/articles/articles97.htm#sciuni97| first=Amanda| last= Finch| title=The Universe Interview: Tracy Torme| journal=Sci-Fi Universe| month=May| year=1997| pages=20-23| accessdate=2008-03-19| issue=24}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.earth62.net/articles/articles98.htm#cult31| last=Bassom| first=David| title=Slide Away| journal=Cult Times| month=April| year=1998| pages=40-41| issue=31}}</ref> These stories explored what would have happened, for example, if America had been conquered by the [[Soviet Union]], if [[British Empire|Britain]] had won the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], if [[penicillin]] had not been invented, or if [[Matriarchy|men were subservient to women]].

The third season introduced the first significant changes to the premise of ''Sliders''. As a result of increased [[Fox Network]] oversight (and the network-enforced, unwilling relinquishment of day-to-day creative control by creator [[Tracy Torm<U+00E9>]]), episodes became far more action-oriented, even going so far as to devolve into riffs on major genre feature films (including ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]'', ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'', ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', and ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996 film)|The Island of Dr. Moreau]]''). Another noticeable change was that the emotional connection between Quinn and Wade that developed throughout the first two series and beginning of the third was abruptly replaced by frequent "love at first sight" interactions with others for both. An example that stands out is [[List of Sliders episodes|Exodus]], an episode described by Torm<U+00E9> as "''one of the worst pieces of television ever produced, and the low point of the entire series''", where Quinn succumbs to advances from the wife of a disabled man who is helping the sliders[http://earthprime.com/articles/slide-rules.html].

For the original series' creators, this was the beginning of a downward creative trend, culminating with the firing of [[John Rhys-Davies]] by the network,<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.earth62.net/articles/articles98.htm#sciunioct98| last=Boutillier| first=Jim| title=Star Slider| journal=Sci-Fi Universe| month=October| year=1998| pages=54-57, 68-69}}</ref> and Tracy Torm<U+00E9> deciding not to contractually continue with the series he himself created, in light of the massive creative interference he was receiving from the network executives.<ref name=Finch/>

The fourth and fifth seasons saw the series moved to the [[Sci-Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]], and a restoration of the series creators' original "alternate history" premise; the other major storyline (begun at the end of the second season, but de-emphasized during Season Three) involved the growing war against the [[Kromaggs]].

== Plot ==
{{Main|List of Sliders episodes}}

[[Image:Sliders2.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The original Sliders. From left to right: Wade Welles, Rembrandt Brown, Professor Arturo and Quinn Mallory]]

=== Season one ===
''Episodes 1 - 10''

[[Quinn Mallory]], a graduate student of physics specializing in [[string theory]] from [[San Francisco]], creates a device capable of opening [[vortices]] to [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universes]]. He develops the [[technology]] to the extent that not only can he send items through the [[gateway]] he created, but also, with the use of a [[timer]]-a kind of time space tv remote control, return them to their point of origin. He uses himself as his first living "guinea pig." After his initial slide, he returns to find a double from another universe has caused him a bit of trouble but also helped him solve the final 'missing piece' in the equation for sliding (which includes a solution to the [[unified field theory]]).

His best friend [[Wade Welles]] and his professor/mentor [[Maximillian Arturo]] join him on his second test. However, the wormhole grows unstable and spirals out of control. Singer [[Rembrandt Brown|Rembrandt "Cryin' Man" Brown]], driving by Quinn's house, is accidentally sucked through with them.

When faced with a life-or-death situation, the timer is activated ahead of time - more than four hours before it was scheduled to - and is damaged and original coordinates lost. Thus the Sliders cannot return home. This leaves them unable to control when the vortices open, or which universe they leap to, literally having to wait around in a different world for hours, days or even months before they can move on. The Sliders continue moving from universe to universe, hoping they'll find their way back home.

Common themes during this season include the exploration of political issues, and the appearances of recurring characters' alternate selves, showing how their situations had changed in various realities.

=== Season two ===
''Episodes 11 <U+2013> 23''

The group actually arrives on their homeworld at the end of the second-season premiere episode "Into the Mystic," but only has seconds to decide whether or not to stay. Quinn's gate that had always squeaked does not squeak, so they leave, not knowing that his family's gardener just recently fixed it. Other than this two-minute visit to their original world [[Earth Prime (Sliders)|Earth Prime]], the Sliders are still no closer to returning home. The Sliders encounter the [[Kromagg]]s for the very first time, in the episode "[[Invasion (Sliders)|Invasion]]." Their presence is short-lived, but they become part of the main plot of the series in later seasons.

=== Season three ===
''Episodes 24 <U+2013> 48''

The third season features a series of one-off episodes. Additionally, the production of the series was moved from [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]] to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] (due to an increased desire for oversight by Fox Network executives), necessitating a creative adjustment in the climatology of future stories. Whereas Vancouver was very green and "lush," the Los Angeles filming environments brought a much "brighter" color palette to the series, including (for the first time) desert location-shooting.

Early in the season, Quinn meets a woman named Logan St. Clair, who is working on sliding technology herself, and decides to help her. It is later discovered that she is not only a female double of Quinn himself, but also one with nefarious purposes. As a result of their interaction, a key part of the timer, which normally ensures that characters slide within a two-mile radius, has been replaced with a version that causes them to slide anywhere within 400 miles. Before this, their slides took them to alternate versions of [[San Francisco]]. Afterwards, they could arrive in many varied locations, but most episodes take place in alternate versions of Los Angeles.

In the middle of the season, the Sliders do not slide when their timer reaches zero, which means the timer cannot open a vortex for another 29 years. However, they later find a replacement timer, and are able to continue sliding.<ref>Episode: "Slide Like an Egyptian"</ref> A little bit later in the season, Quinn mentions that his timer has a 500-mile radius, which presumably could be the radius of the new timer.<ref>Episode: [[The Exodus (Sliders)|"The Exodus", Part 1]]</ref> However, later in Season Four, Maggie says that the timer has a 400-mile radius.<ref>Episode: "World Killer"</ref>

[[Image:Sliders3.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The Season 3 cast. From left to right: Rembrandt Brown, Maggie Beckett, Quinn Mallory and Wade Welles]]

During a slide to a world that is soon to be destroyed by fragments of a [[pulsar]], the Sliders are pulled into a military operation commanded by [[Gulf War]] veteran [[Recurring characters of Sliders#Angus Rickman|Colonel Angus Rickman]] and [[Maggie Beckett|Captain Maggie Beckett]]. The goal of this operation is to develop sliding technology in order to evacuate the best and brightest to a new homeworld. While helping the operation to succeed, Quinn amazingly finds what he believes to be [[Earth Prime (Sliders)|Earth Prime]]; but Quinn also discovers that Maggie is unable to breathe there. Meanwhile, the other Sliders uncover that Rickman is murdering the evacuees in order to obtain donor tissue necessary to stave off a strange brain disease Rickman contracted during the war. To protect his secret and himself, Rickman kills Professor Arturo and Dr. Stephen Jensen (Maggie's husband) before escaping with the only timer that contains the coordinates for Earth Prime.

A new mission is born <U+2014> the search for Rickman. Maggie wants revenge on Rickman for killing her husband, and the other Sliders want to stop Rickman from harming anyone else; but moreso, the Sliders want Rickman's timer and the chance it offers to finally send them home.   Maggie joins the Sliders, and they continue to chase Rickman until he meets his demise in the season finale. With Rickman's timer in hand, the episode ends with Quinn shoving Wade and Rembrandt into the vortex that may finally take them home, but Quinn makes a last second decision to stay behind with Maggie who fears she can not survive on Quinn's home world. Refusing to give up, Quinn convinces Maggie to take a chance and slide with him using the remaining timer, but the duo finds that apparent damage to the timer has caused a malfunction. Quinn and Maggie have not followed their friends; they have instead landed on an unknown parallel earth.

While filming the episode "Desert Storm", actor [[Ken Steadman]] (Cutter) was killed in a dune buggy accident.[http://www.kensteadman.com/]

[[Image:Sliders4.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The Season 4 cast. From left to right: Rembrandt Brown, Quinn Mallory, Colin Mallory, and Maggie Beckett]]

=== Season four ===
''Episodes 49 <U+2013> 70''

After three months and ten worlds, Quinn and Maggie finally follow the trail of their friends; but the world believed to be home has changed since Quinn and Maggie's last visit. Now conquered by the Kromagg Dynasty, this world found Rembrandt sent to the horrors of a Kromagg prison and Wade sent to a Kromagg breeder-camp on an alternate Earth. Soon captured himself, Quinn finds his imprisoned mother who tells him that he is, in fact, her adopted son, and is actually from another, parallel world <U+2014> [[Kromagg Prime|the Earth on which the Kromaggs originated]]. With the help of the local resistance, Quinn, Maggie and Rembrandt escape with the goal of finding Quinn's long lost brother who holds the key to locating the Kromagg homeworld and the weapon that can free [[Earth Prime (Sliders)|Earth Prime]].

They find Quinn's brother Colin on another world, their parents having sent them to different worlds for their protection after their home was attacked by Kromaggs, which was no longer safe. Colin becomes the sixth Slider, and they try to track down their birth-parents, hoping they have the answers they seek, and the means to defeat the Kromaggs. This war with the Kromaggs is the primary theme throughout the season.

[[Image:Sliders5.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The Season 5 cast. From left to right: Maggie Beckett, Rembrandt Brown, Dr. Diana Davis and Mallory]]

=== Season five ===
''Episodes 71 <U+2013> 88''

With Jerry and Charlie O'Connell stricken from the cast list, the writers decided to simply lose Colin in the vortex, and fuse Quinn with his counterpart on the new world, who is the only duplicate to not look anything like Quinn (other than Logan St. Clair, the female double of Quinn, in a season three episode, "[[Double Cross (Sliders)|Double Cross]]"). Mallory has the combined personality of himself and the original Slider Quinn. He stays with the group throughout the season. While Mallory showed initial signs of acting like Quinn, this largely took a backseat to his own personality traits; the dual-identity crisis was reduced immensely until its resolution in "Eye of the Storm".

In the same episode ("The Unstuck Man"), scientist Doctor Diana Davis becomes the final Slider, feeling responsible for what happened to Mallory. They discover that the weapon created by Quinn's father, Michael Mallory, to defeat the Kromaggs on Kromagg Prime had the [[unintended consequence]] of destroying that planet's ecosystem, making its use on [[Earth Prime (Sliders)|Earth Prime]] impractical.

In the middle of the fifth season, Wade telepathically communicates with Rembrandt, and is able to transport him and the other Sliders to the world that the Kromaggs are keeping her on. Wade was being used as an experiment by the Kromaggs in an attempt to liberate their homeworld. Rembrandt is unable to save Wade, but Wade is able to sabotage the experiment. Rembrandt reveals that he senses that Wade is gone.

The series concludes on a world where the sliders are the subjects of a fanatical religion called Slidology, founded by a man with psychic powers who has mentally followed them on their interdimensional adventures. Rembrandt (the only surviving original Slider) injects a virus that kills Kromaggs into his blood and slides alone to fight the Kromaggs on his homeworld. The cliff-hanger ending apparently anticipated a sixth season.

=== Episodes aired out-of-order ===
The original filmed order for Season 1 episodes is as follows:

# "Sliders" (two-hour pilot episode)
# "Summer of Love"
# "Prince of Wails"
# "Fever"
# "Last Days"
# "The Weaker Sex"
# "Eggheads"
# "The King is Back"
# "Luck of the Draw"

The Fox Network aired the episodes in a different order to best capitalize on potential ratings-winning episodes, thus causing some continuity errors. For instance, the timer is first set to count down not in the pilot episode, but in "Summer of Love" &mdash; since Fox aired "Fever" right  '''after''' the pilot episode, though, many viewers were left confused as to why the Sliders suddenly had to leave within a very specific period of time. Similarly, the cliffhanger at the end of "Summer of Love" leads directly into the opening of "Prince of Wails" &mdash; which Fox had actually aired a week earlier.<ref name="Sliders-The-Classic-Episodes"/>

For Season Two, Fox did not want to resolve the cliffhanger at the end of "Luck of the Draw," preferring to focus instead on brand-new storylines. Thus, in "Time Again and World" (the first episode filmed for Season Two), Arturo makes a brief passing reference to the events of "Luck of the Draw." Tracy Torm<U+00E9> successfully petitioned for a chance to resolve the cliffhanger, though, which is briefly dealt with in the opening minutes of "Into the Mystic" (the third episode filmed, but the first to air that season). "Time Again and World" ended up airing sixth in the rotation.<ref name="Sliders-The-Classic-Episodes"/>

"Double Cross" was filmed as the premiere for Season Three. In this episode, the audience learns why the Sliders will now be able to slide anywhere between San Francisco and L.A. However, Fox opted to air "Rules of the Game" first, since it was a more action-oriented episode.<ref name="Sliders-The-Classic-Episodes"/>

"The Last of Eden" was filmed before John Rhys-Davies (Prof. Arturo) left the show. However, Fox chose to air the episode for the first time on March 28, a full month '''after''' Arturo had been written off the show, requiring a new opening scene be added to frame the story as a flashback.<ref name="Sliders-The-Classic-Episodes">"[[Sliders: The Classic Episodes]]", Brad Linaweaver (1999)</ref>

When the show began airing in reruns on the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]],<!--U.S.? U.K.? Other?--> Sci-Fi restored the original filmed order for Season One. However, when the DVDs were released, Universal used the aired order for Season One and the subsequent seasons.

=== Changing cast ===
[[Cleavant Derricks (actor)|Cleavant Derricks]] ([[Rembrandt Brown]]) is the only cast member to stay with the series throughout its entire run, while Derricks and [[Linda Henning]] (Mrs. Mallory) are the only actors to appear in both the first and last episodes of the series.

When [[Sabrina Lloyd]] ([[Wade Welles]]) left at the end of season three a spokesperson for her agency said "no comment at this time" and stated that it was her decision not to return. A source{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} came forward claiming Lloyd was fired as she was jealous of [[Kari W<U+00FC>hrer]] ([[Maggie Beckett]]). Universal and Lloyd's agent both refused to comment and the rumour spread. Much later it was revealed that due to a "decline in the family atmosphere after John Rhys-Davies' firing" it was decided Lloyd was no longer required.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} As a result of public pressure to elaborate on what happened to Wade after she disappeared, the producers asked Lloyd to guest star in one season five episode that was to focus entirely on Wade (without the rest of the cast).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Lloyd requested $40,000 to appear{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and the idea was scrapped. However, the episode she was to appear in, ''[[Requiem (Sliders)|Requiem]] S5e11'', was "fine tuned" to answer this question without her.

Jerry and Charlie O'Connell leaving the show disaffected many fans and Tracy Torm<U+00E9> was asked what could be done.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} This resulted in the producers negotiating with previously recurring characters [[John Novak]] (Ross J. Kelly, the ambulance-chasing lawyer), [[Alex Bruhanski]] (Pavel Kurlienko, the taxi driver) and [[Lester Barrie]] (Elston Diggs the waiter at the Chancellor Hotel) for their return in season five. [[Zoe McClellan]] (Logan St. Clair) was scheduled to appear again and [[Jason Gaffney]] (Conrad Bennish, Jr) from season one was confirmed for four episodes including the season finale.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} None of these guest stars eventuated and why Bennish didn't appear in the fifth season is one of the biggest behind-the-scenes mysteries of the show.

=== Changing staff ===
The series co-creator, [[Tracy Torm<U+00E9>]], has often been critical of the direction the series took in the third season.<ref> http://www.earth62.net/transcripts/torme27jun97.htm Accessed: October 18, 2006</ref> [[David Peckinpah]] was brought onto the series in the third season (around the time when Tracy Torm<U+00E9> started to criticize the show). Peckinpah has been criticized by fans of the show, who argue that his involvement caused the show to "[[jump the shark]]."<ref>[http://www.jumptheshark.com/topic/sliders-general-comments/1808 Sliders in Jump The Shark<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Seasons four and five have their fanbases; some{{Who|date=July 2009}} even said season four improved on three (largely due to new executive producer [[Marc Scott Zicree]]'s decision to restore Tracy Torm<U+00E9>'s original "alternate history" premise for the series). {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

== Show concepts ==
=== Timer ===
[[Image:Sliders - Timer.jpg|thumb|The original timer.]]
The timer is a [[handheld device]] that resembles a [[mobile phone]] or [[remote control]]. The Sliders have a finite amount of time to stay in each world, a time which is beyond their control, and is revealed on the timer's display upon arriving on the parallel Earth. The only time they are able to leave a parallel Earth is when the timer hits "zero." If they do not slide at that time, they will not have another opportunity to slide for another 29.7 years. In the episode "Rules of the Game" (et al.), it is first stated that the Sliders must wait 29 years for the next slide, if they miss it when the timer hits zero. The timer has frequently been lost, stolen, or damaged during the slides. However, it is almost always recovered, repaired, or replaced before they are scheduled to slide.

Different timers have different countdown times.  If the Sliders miss the window on one timer, they can still slide out with another, at least on those rare occasions when they have access to another timer, such as the second-season episode "Into the Mystic".

In the first two seasons, the prop of the timer is a rebuilt Motorola cellular phone, after missing a slide in season three, the timer they find that enables them to continue sliding is a modified RCA RCU4GLW universal remote.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

=== Doubles ===
One of the concepts of the show is the concept of doubles. On many parallel Earths, there will be alternate versions of the same person. The Sliders frequently encounter alternate versions of themselves. Sometimes, the doubles of the Sliders had similar personality traits and interests (for example, many doubles of Quinn Mallory had invented sliding, or were in the process of inventing sliding). Sometimes, however, the personality traits of the Sliders are entirely different. Gender and appearance of doubles is also somewhat fluid, although this is only seen in a few cases.

Some of the doubles the Sliders encounter are doubles of people they know from [[Earth Prime (Sliders)|Earth Prime]], such as Quinn's classmate Conrad Bennish, Jr. In the episodes "Dragonslide" and "The Prince of Slides", Rembrandt meets doubles of girlfriends from Earth Prime, and in the episode "Eggheads", Arturo meets a double of his late wife. Sometimes doubles of the family members of the Sliders are found during sliding; Quinn often encounters doubles of his parents, and in the episode "Season's Greedings", Wade meets doubles of her father and sister.

On some of the alternate Earths that the Sliders visit, there are alternate versions of celebrities and politicians of Earth Prime. However, celebrities on these alternate Earths sometimes have different levels of fame than their Earth Prime counterparts. In addition, some of the alternate versions of Earth Prime politicians hold different offices. For example, the Sliders find alternate Earths where [[Oliver North]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Jocelyn Elders]], and even B-movie filmmaker [[Ed Wood]]<ref>[[Oliver North]] is [[President of the United States|president]] in "Summer of Love"; [[Hillary Clinton]] is president in "The Weaker Sex"; [[Jocelyn Elders]] is president in "Luck of the Draw"; [[Ed Wood]] was president in "Into The Mystic".</ref> were at one time in their respective worlds, [[president of the United States]]. In the pilot episode, the former cast of ''[[The People's Court]]'' guest starred as their own doubles in a [[Soviet]]-styled parody of the show.

[[Cleavant Derricks (actor)|Cleavant Derricks]]'s identical [[twin]] brother, [[Clinton Derricks-Carroll]], occasionally appeared on the show, in the episodes "The King Is Back", "Greatfellas", and "The Prince of Slides", when there was a need for Rembrandt and his double to interact.

=== Vortex ===
[[Image:Sliders - Vortex.jpg|thumb|The Sliders vortex (ERP bridge)]]
The vortex, a [[wormhole]] opened by the timer that the Sliders carry around, is the means by which the Sliders travel from one parallel universe to another. In the pilot and several other episodes, Quinn refers to the vortex as an "Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky bridge," a fictitious term that may have arisen out of a confusion between the actual term [[Wormhole#Schwarzschild wormholes|Einstein-Rosen bridge]] (a type of wormhole in physics) and the [[EPR paradox|Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox]] (a famous thought-experiment in [[quantum mechanics]], which is unrelated to wormholes). 

The look of the vortex changes throughout the series. From the first to third season, the vortex is a bluish whirlpool, and is somewhat transparent. In the third season the vortex is a clear water-like whirlpool with random flashes of blue. The first time the sliders use their newly acquired timer in the episode "Slide like an Egyptian" the vortex appears gold in color but in subsequent episodes it returns to the colorless version.  The episode "Gillian of the Spirits" also introduced an opaque red vortex existing on the [[astral plane]]. Later, Logan St Clair's timer produces a transparent red vortex in the real world. In the double episode "The Exodus", this worlds own slider technology produces an opaque red vortex with lightning at the centre that is also noticably angular compared to the expected smooth curves previously seen. The sliders own timer then produces the same red vortex although the only change made to it has been the installation of a program that now gives it the ability to record the coordinates of the worlds they travel to. In the fourth and fifth seasons, the sliders vortex appears as a mostly-blue whirlpool with some blue-green, and is entirely opaque.

In "Gillian of the Spirits", Arturo says the vortex will close itself automatically after being open for sixty seconds. However, in several episodes the vortex is open well beyond sixty seconds &mdash; including "Gillian of the Spirits" &mdash; where it remained open for more than two minutes. In the episode "Slide like an Egyptian" they open the vortex to slide but then debate staying. A few seconds after making the decision to stay the vortex closes after being open for only 20 seconds. As a rule the vortex merely acts as a plot device, staying open until the last person jumps through then closing several seconds later regardless of how long it has been open. This is especially evident in the double episode of season three where a large number of jumps are made culminating in the vortex closing after only 13 seconds, just in time to prevent the capture of Rickman.

=== Hotel ===
The Sliders will often stay at the same hotel on different worlds, and in a recurring plot device, would usually stay in the same room. In Season One, this is Room 12 at the Motel 12 in San Francisco except in episode 15 "el Sid" when they first refer to it as the Dominion Hotel. In Season Two, it is the Dominion Hotel in San Francisco (this may just have been a different name for the Motel 12, as they are often both managed by the same person, [[Recurring_characters_of_Sliders#Gomez_Calhoun|Gomez Calhoun]]). In Season Three, they stay at the Chancellor Hotel in Los Angeles; however, the real-life Chancellor Hotel in San Francisco objected to the use of the name, so in Seasons Four and Five, they stay at the Chandler Hotel, in Los Angeles.

== Intro ==
The beginning credits started by watching a spiral of earths and a monologue describing the premise of the show:
* '''Season One:''' ''"What if you could find brand new worlds right here on Earth, where anything is possible: same planet, different dimension?  I found the gateway!"''<ref name=theme>{{cite web| work=Slidecage| url=http://www.slidecage.com/2007/08/09/theme-song-lyrics-pdf/| title=Sliders | Theme Song Lyrics| date=2007-08-09| accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref>
* '''Season Two:''' ''"What if you could travel to parallel worlds?  The same year, the same Earth, only different dimensions?  A world where the [[Russia]]ns ruled [[United States|America]]? Or where your dreams of being a [[celebrity|superstar]] came true?  Or where San Francisco was a maximum security [[prison]]?  My friends and I found the gateway. Now, the problem is: finding a way back home."''<ref name=theme/>
* '''Seasons Three, Four, and Five:''' ''"What if you found a portal to a parallel universe?  What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds - where it's the same year, and you're the same person, but everything else is different?  And what if you can't find your way home?"''<ref name=theme/>

In the first through fourth seasons, Quinn spoke the monologue.<ref name=theme/>  Rembrandt spoke the monologue in the fifth season, after Quinn had left the show.<ref name=theme/>  The monologue was followed by music, without lyrics. The first and second seasons had music that were unique to each season, and the third to fifth seasons had roughly the same music.
