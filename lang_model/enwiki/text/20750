'''''Pinoy Big Brother''''' is the [[Philippines|Philippine]] version of the [[reality television show]] '''''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]''''' (the word ''[[Pinoy]]'' is a colloquial term for ''[[Filipino people|Filipino]]''). It follows the same premise as its many foreign counterparts around the world: twelve Philippine residents are forced to live with each other inside a house for about 100 days (extended to another 12 days for the first season due to inefficient scheduling of nomination and eviction of housemates in the first week). It is shown on [[ABS-CBN]] Channel 2 and its international [[affiliate]], [[The Filipino Channel]], with snippets shown on local affiliate [[Studio 23]]. The uncut [[24/7]] version of the series can also be seen on the [[internet]] through [[streaming media|streaming video]] and a special cable channel provided by ABS-CBN-owned [[Cable television|cable TV]] provider, [[SkyCable]].

The elimination process in the show is the reverse of the original Dutch format. At the start of the elimination process, the "housemates" (as the contestants are referred to) vote for which two (sometimes  more if there are ties) fellow housemates they should eliminate. Once these nominations are chosen, the viewer votes come into play. For a week viewers are asked to vote, via [[Short message service|SMS]] or voice messaging through [[PLDT]]'s hotline, for whoever they wanted to stay longer in the house. The housemate with the least viewer votes is eliminated. In the final week, the one with the most viewer votes will win the grand prize package worth six million [[Philippine peso|pesos]] (approx. [[US Dollar|$]]111,000) all-in-all, including the one-million peso cash prize (about $18,000), a house and lot of his/her own, a  [[Nissan Frontier]], an entertainment component system, a [[Yamaha Motor Company Ltd.|Yamaha motorcycle]], and a livelihood showcase just for the first season alone. The second season adds an overseas tour package to the list of prizes.

Other essential elements of the Big Brother franchise are present, such as weekly and daily challenges, the confessional room, and the voice known only as "Big Brother."

The first series started with a grand entrance party on [[August 21]], [[2005]], with the first primetime episode airing the next night. The finale was held [[December 10]] of the same year, 111 days after. The second series has begun its run on [[February 25]], [[2007]], and is scheduled to run for 126 days, two weeks longer than the first season.

==Overview==

"Kuya" means "eldest brother" in Tagalog. 

Don't change it unless it is proven otherwise.

[[Image:Big_bro_hosts.JPG|left|thumb|From left to right, Mariel Rodriguez, Willie Revillame, and Toni Gonzaga, the original hosts of Pinoy Big Brother. As of the Teen Edition, only Rodriguez remains as a host.]]
[[Television host]] and [[comedian]] Willie Revillame hosted the show, together with TV personalities [[Toni Gonzaga]] and [[Mariel Rodriguez]]. Toni hosts the [[primetime]] telecast which chronicles the events of the day before (unless an episode is telecast live). Mariel, on the other hand, hosts the [[late night]] edition called ''Pinoy Big Brother: Up Late'', which updates anything viewers missed in the primetime telecast, as well as what to look forward in the next one. Willie hosts the live telecast of the eviction and the public revelation of the nomination for evictees.

[[Asia Agcaoili]] spearheaded the show for the viewers of Studio 23. Her show, called ''Pinoy Big Brother: Si Kuya, KaBarkada Mo'' (English: ''Pinoy Big Brother: Eldest Brother Is Your Buddy''), not only featured snippets from the primetime telecast the night before, but also featured opinion polls both from the man on the street and those sending [[SMS]], [[Parody|spoof]] segments, unaired videos, and feed from inside the house (either live feed or footage taped earlier).

Talk show host [[Boy Abunda]] hosted the post-season documentaries. It featured issues and controversies about the housemates.

The show also had its theme song called "Pinoy Ako" (English: I'm a Filipino) by [[Orange and Lemons]]. This song is also the basis for much of the background music used in the show.

[[Luis Manzano]] took over Willie's place for the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition|Celebrity Edition]]. The theme song in that edition was ''Sikat ang Pinoy'' by season 1 contestant Sam Milby and host Toni Gonzaga.

On its Teen Edition, [[Bianca Gonzalez]] (a TV host and a former housemate of the Celebrity Edition) took over Mariel Rodriguez for  the Teen Edition Update and UpLate, while the latter became the main host, replacing Toni Gonzaga. The theme song is "''Kabataang Pinoy''" (Filipino Youth) by [[Itchyworms]]. The house was renovated for the preparation for the Teen Edition by the students of the Philippine School of Interior Design.

==Primers==
<!--

"Kuya" means "eldest brother" in Tagalog. 

Don't change it unless it is proven otherwise.

-->
To prepare the viewers for the program's run, two primers were aired. The first was ''Eto na si Kuya!'' (''Here Comes Eldest Brother''), which talked about the essentials of the franchise and its success around the world.

In the second primer, entitled ''Ang Bahay ni Kuya'' (''<nowiki>Eldest Brother's</nowiki> House''), Mariel and Toni indirectly gave the viewers a tour of the Big Brother house and its rooms, along with the control center and the confession booth. It also featured highlights a dry run where 12 of the network's talents stayed in the house for 24 hours and experienced the challenges and tests the housemates would experience at the start of the actual run.

==The house==

[[Image:Bahay1.JPG|thumb|right|The facade of the Big Brother house]]
The house is actually located in front of the ABS-CBN studios in [[Quezon City]]. The clips, therefore, that show the housemates boarding vehicles to go to the ABS-CBN studios for interviews while not technically evicted are a [[hoax]].

The car was used to transfer the evicted housemate from the Big Brother house to the main building of ABS-CBN. Due to the number of people gathered outside to watch the eviction, it would be rather unsafe for the housemate to walk to the nearby building. Of course, the car can't go inside the building.

It is designed with walls painted with [[pastel]] colors. It also has a garden and swimming pool. It also boasts of a multi-faith altar in one wall of the house (one which has a [[Bible]], a [[Koran]], and twelve [[rosary|rosaries]]), making the house the only Big Brother house that has a room set aside for religious purposes (although it is said that the Arab Big Brother house had prayer rooms). And although any form of communication from the outside world is banned inside the house, there is a large flat-screen [[television|television set]] in the living room, used for only 2 purposes: 
* To show any [[video]] Big Brother wants to show to any or all housemates, especially that of the TV [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] every Sunday (contrary to reports early in the first season that a [[priest]] would visit them; later on, a priest unseen by viewers visits them), and
* To announce the names of nominees for eviction directly to the housemates and the person evicted from the house. (The housemates see either host Willie Revillame (prior to the Teen Edition) Mariel Rodriguez or Toni Gonzaga (prior to the Teen Edition) Bianca Gonzalez talk to them during nomination and eviction nights.)

To complete the set up, 26 surveillance [[camera]]s are positioned all over the house to watch the housemates' every move, including the bathroom. For modesty's sake, however, images from the bathroom will be shown if the bathroom is used for any purpose other than bathing (such as gossiping).

The set up of the house, especially when shown on television, makes the illusion that it is a one-story house. But anybody who passes by it can easily notice that its [[facade]] is that of a two-story house. That is because the second story houses parts of the control room. The actual front doors to the house area are actually further inside.

==The housemates==
===Season 1===
[[Image:Pbb_new_logo.JPG|right|150px]]{{main|Pinoy Big Brother (season 1)}}
[[Nene Tamayo]] of [[Romblon]] emerged as Pinoy Big Brother's first ever Big Winner, besting the other 12 housemates. Her win was declared on December 10, 2005, at [[Clark Air Base|Clark Expo, Angeles City, Pampanga]]. Nene garnered the highest number of votes (557,000+) among the "big four" contestants.<ref>http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=24473</ref>

===Celebrity Edition===
{{main|Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition}}[[image:Pbb celebrity edition.JPG|150px|right]]
A 56-day celebrity version was started on February 5, 2006, known as ''Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition''.

The celebrity version is not confined only to showbiz idols. Celebrities who auditioned include athletes, stand-up comedians, ramp and commercial models, musicians, and TV personalities. Of these, fourteen were chosen for the edition's first run.

On [[April 1]], [[2006]] at the facade of Central Post Office Building in Manila, starlet [[Keanna Reeves]] was declared the winner of Celebrity Edition, garnering the highest number of votes among the "Big 4" finalists. Reeves surpassed Tamayo's vote total during the first season. <ref>http://celeb1.pinoybigbrother.com/Default.aspx?tabid=134&articleType=ArticleView&articleId=391</ref>

===Teen Edition===
{{main|Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition}}[[Image:PBBT ABSCBN.jpg|150px|right]]
A teen version of ''Pinoy Big Brother'', ''Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition'', was shown in the Philippine "summer months" of April and May, when children and teenagers take their vacation from school. This edition premiered on [[April 23]], roughly three weeks after the end of the Celebrity Edition and ran for six weeks. It featured teenagers aged from 16 to 18 years old as housemates.

Auditions in [[Cebu City]], [[Davao City]], and [[Metro Manila]] were held and according to ABS-CBN, 30,000 teens answered the audition call. <ref>http://www.you.inq7.net/vid_vibe/04202006/vid8-1.htm</ref> Of these, twelve are selected; eight come from the Manila auditions while the remaining four represent the [[Visayas]]-[[Mindanao]] area.

On [[June 3]], [[2006]] at the Aliw Theater, [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] Complex in [[Pasay City]], [[Kim Chiu]] of [[Cebu Province|Cebu]], was declared the winner of ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition]]'', besting 13 other housemates. Kim garnered 626,562 votes, or 41.4% of the total votes, the highest number of votes ever received by a winner in ''Pinoy Big Brother''.

===Season 2===
[[Image:PBB S2 Tarp.jpg|thumb|200px|A billboard advertising the second season.]]
{{main|Pinoy Big Brother (season 2)}}
ABS-CBN held auditions stretching from May to June 2006 in various cities in the Philippines, as well as overseas auditions in [[Sydney]], [[Milan]], [[Tokyo]], [[Dubai]], and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], for the show's second season, which started airing on February 25 (originally scheduled for March), 2007. These same auditions were also held for another reality show, ''[[Pinoy Dream Academy]]'', also a franchise from [[Endemol]]. The new season of ''Pinoy Big Brother'' promises a bigger house, more housemates (fourteen to be exact), and a stricter Big Brother. 

The "bigger house" concept stems from the fact that the house area was expanded and used in ''Pinoy Dream Academy''. The house has been expanded with larger living and dining areas, larger bedrooms, separate restrooms, and more. The number of cameras have been increased from 27 to 42 and the front doors of the house have been moved from the facade to the auditorium built next door (also used in ''Pinoy Dream Academy'').

''Pinoy Ako'' has also been rehashed, this time sung by the band CeBaLo (Yvan Lambatan, Panky Trinidad, Eman Abatayo, and Davey Langit of ''Pinoy Dream Academy'').

==Spinoffs==
===''Pinoy Big Brother: Yes or No''===
Due to the show's popularity, a [[game show]] segment is launched called ''Pinoy Big Brother: Yes or No''. It is one which uses the [[board game]] format and uses questions related to the show as well as ABS-CBN's other primetime [[soap opera]]s. The show is hosted by [[Mariel Rodriguez]] and it promises to give a daily studio contestant up to [[Philippine peso|PhP]]25,000. After a week as a segment of the show, it became a separate early afternoon game show on [[October 24]], [[2005]]. This show was terminated after the first season ended.

===''Pinoy Big Brother Buzz''===
The popularity of the show and its former housemates spawned another show called ''Pinoy Big Brother Buzz'', hosted by actress Anne Curtis, gossip reporter AJ Dee, and comedienne Pokwang. Like its parent show ''[[The Buzz]]'', the show tackles events and goings-on inside the house, controversy surrounding the show, and the latest gossip about the housemates who were already evicted. This spin-off was cancelled during the run of the Celebrity Edition.

===''What's the Word? Thats the Word!''===
It was launched during the first season of ''Pinoy Big Brother''. It is a raffle hosted by Mariel Rodriguez and airs during commercial breaks at primetime telecast. At first, it started as a trivia game show for Pinoy Big Brother, and then later, it is extended as a trivia game show for the whole Primetime Bida. It still continued even after Pinoy Big Brother's first year run ended.

===''Pinoy Big Brother UpLate''===
Pinoy Big Brother Up-late is a spin-off of the reality show. Starting May 6, 2006, this was hosted by [[Bianca Gonzalez]]. This airs late at night to early morning, Monday to Friday, after the News & Public Affairs programs; and shows some updates, live feeds, and interviews.

===''Pinoy Big Brother Update''===
This are short-segment updates shown 3 times a day, Monday to Friday, that shows daily happenings in the Big Brother house, and introduces what will be shown in the primetime telecast.

===''Pinoy Big Brother, the Big Reunion''===
On [[June 4]], [[2006]], a night after the finale of the Teen Edition, a live musical special was held at the Aliw Theather (in the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines|CCP]] Grounds, Manila), with all the housemates for the first season, the Celebrity Edition, and the Teen Edition gathered in one spot. The show showcased and celebrated the success of the show, especially its greatest moments and accomplishments. This was done to cap off the show's first year on the air.

==Criticisms==
On its first week alone, the show was already given a stern warning by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB), the Philippine [[censorship|censoring]] body for [[film|cinema]] and [[television]], saying that the show airs content that is definitely not suitable for children, such as talk on [[contraceptive]]s and very "intimate scenes". ABS-CBN is reported to have acknowledged this and had promised to make an "improved" show more suitable for younger audiences in the coming weeks.<ref>http://news.inq7.net/entertainment/index.php?index=1&story_id=48294</ref> As a result, as scenes like these are unavoidable at times without interference, each episode begins with a warning reminding viewers that some scenes in the show that are not suitable for young audiences.

In spite of this, though, the scenes that were deemed to be way beyond the [[parental guidance]] rating given by the Board were still shown. In this light, MTRCB ordered the program suspended for one episode. As compliance, the program was not aired on [[September 25]], [[2005]], the day after the 2nd eviction night. <ref>http://www.pinoybigbrother.com/Default.aspx?tabid=52&articleType=ArticleView&articleId=85</ref>

:''See: MTRCB's suspension order:'' <ref>http://www.pinoybigbrother.com/Portals/0/News/mtrcb1.jpg</ref> <ref>http://www.pinoybigbrother.com/Portals/0/News/mtrcb2.jpg</ref>

Columnist Nestor U. Torre of the [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] has also given a doubtful but [[optimism|optimistic]] stance on the show, saying that while the scenes are chaotic and challenges in the first week were way too mundane and cheesy, he is hopeful that more compelling tasks would be given to the housemates in the future and the housemates' personalities will become clearly defined.<sup>[http://news.inq7.net/entertainment/index.php?index=2&story_id=48302&col=26]</sup>

However, Torre wrote in a later article that in the first week alone, the show emphasizes more on creating controversy (such as sex) rather than exploiting the potential [[psychology|psychological]] factors and showcasing human nature.<ref>http://news.inq7.net/express/html_output/20050903-49024.xml.html</ref>

Despite this negative [[publicity]], ABS-CBN itself has reported that the show is so well liked that it extended its run to all seven days a week. In fact, not only its on-air talents have defended it, but viewers themselves (as shown on ABS-CBN programs) can attest to it. It also inspired the creation of [[fansites]].

Other criticisms against the show, such as allegations of voyeurism and proliferation of vices, are also common in other versions of the ''Big Brother'' franchise.

===Theme song conflict===
: ''See also: [[Orange and Lemons#Plagiarism accusations|Orange and Lemons]]''

There have been allegations saying that the melody of "Pinoy Ako" (included in the album [[Pinoy Ako|with the same name]]) has been [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] from the song "Chandeliers" by [[1980s|80s]] British band [[Care (band)|Care]]. [[Orange and Lemons]] and the song's composer Jonathan Manalo claim that while Orange and Lemons may have been influenced by [[British rock]], they stressed that the two songs are completely different from each other and assured that ''Pinoy Ako'' is a completely original one.<ref>http://www.mb.com.ph/MOBILE/ENTR2005100545993.htm</ref>

However, musical correspondent Giselle Roque (who has connections to Care) claims in a separate article that Orange and Lemons and Manalo were "pressured" to come up with a theme song for the show within a week, hence the creation of "Pinoy Ako" which is very similar to "Chandeliers."

BMG Music (now [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]]) that owns the rights to [[Care (band)|The Care]]'s "Diamonds And Emeralds" album from which "Chandeliers" came from is yet to issue a statement or take legal actions if it so warrants.<ref>http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2005/10/16/ENTR2005101646835.html</ref>

===Casting allegations===
There are also rumors circulating through e-mail claiming that Uma, Cass, and Sam were just hired by ''Pinoy Big Brother'' and did not audition for it at all. To prove these rumors wrong, the show actually aired some footage to show that the three indeed auditioned for the show.<ref>http://www.pinoybigbrother.com/Default.aspx?tabid=52&articleType=ArticleView&articleId=183</ref> Although Uma and Cass made it to the final four (or "Big 4" as they were called), they ended up as also-rans. As for the Youth Alliance of the Philippines, the group that is said to author the original e-mail, its existence is still being determined.

===Labor violations===
A Philippine Daily Inquirer article published in early [[2006]] said that both Uma Barum Khouny and Sam Milby were reportedly fined by the [[Department of Labor and Employment]] for failing to get an ''Alien Employment Permit'', a special permit permitting non-resident foreigners to work in the Philippines, before actually participating in the show.  Uma and Sam (Israeli and American nationals, respectively) were reportedly fined (ten thousand [[Philippine peso]]s for Uma and forty thousand pesos for Sam) each for failing to get permits.  However, the article said that Uma applied for his permit after the end of the first season.

==='15 Minutes of Fame'===
Many have criticized ABS-CBN for giving ''all'' the Big Brother housemates management contracts and television projects, even before exiting the Big Brother house. This is without auditioning or the standard workshops in which ABS-CBN talents must go through to obtain said projects and contracts.  Since the debut of "Pinoy Big Brother," many of ABS-CBN's programs have featured former Big Brother contestants in roles, denying the chance for the dozens of ABS-CBN's existing talents from attaining television projects.  Many of the Big Brother contestants have proved to be unexperienced; however, ABS-CBN insists on its plan to flood the airwaves with Big Brother contestants taking part in almost all ABS-CBN programs.
