'''Charles Alton Ellis''' (1876<U+2013>1949) was a professor, structural engineer and mathematician who was chiefly responsible for the structural design of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Because of a dispute with [[Joseph Strauss (engineer)|Joseph Strauss]], he was not recognized for his work when the bridge opened in 1937.
 	
Ellis was born in [[Parkman, Maine]] in 1876 and earned a degree in mathematics from [[Wesleyan University]] and a graduate certificate in [[engineering]] (C.E.) from the [[University of Illinois]].<ref>[[#Morris2004|Morris (2004)]], p.&nbsp;4.</ref><ref>[[#GoldenGateBridge2004|"Golden Gate Bridge" (2004)]].</ref> During his career, he was a professor at the [[University of Michigan]], the [[University of Illinois]], and [[Purdue University]].<ref>[[#Morris2004|Morris (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;4<U+2013>5.</ref>

A dispute over the time it was taking to complete the design led Strauss to accuse Ellis of wasting time and money, and to dismiss him from the project.<ref>[[#Daniels2004|Daniels (2004)]].</ref> The copy of the engineering drawings for the Golden Gate Bridge on file at the [[Library of Congress]] is signed by Ellis,<ref>[[#Morris2004|Morris (2004)]], p.13.</ref> but the plaque placed on the bridge in 1937 did not give him any credit.<ref>[[#Morris2004|Morris (2004)]], p.5.</ref> 

As of May 10, 2007, Ellis was officially given recognition for his part in the designing process of the Golden Gate Bridge.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-05-11/news/17242781_1_golden-gate-bridge-bridge-district-famous-bridge | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Carl | last=Nolte | title=Golden Gate Bridge engineer finally gets recognition | date=May 11, 2007}}</ref>
