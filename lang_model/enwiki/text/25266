'''Convair''' was an American aircraft manufacturing company which later expanded into rockets and spacecraft. The company was formed in 1943 by the merger of [[Consolidated Aircraft]] and [[Vultee Aircraft]], and went on to produce a number of pioneering aircraft such as the [[Convair B-36]] bomber, the [[F-102 Delta Dagger]] and the [[F-106 Delta Dart]]. It also manufactured the first [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas]] rockets, including the rockets that were used for the pioneering manned orbital flights of [[Project Mercury]]. The company's subsequent [[Atlas-Centaur]] design continued this success and derivatives of the design remain in use as of 2010. In 1994 most of the company's divisions were sold by then-owners [[General Dynamics]] to [[McDonnell Douglas Corporation|McDonnell Douglas]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], with the remaining components deactivated in 1996.

== Origins ==
The '''Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation''', whose name was in the course of time changed to '''Convair''', was an American aircraft, rocket, and spacecraft company for the design, development, and manufacturing of [[aerospace]] products. It existed as a company from 1943 until 1994, although the [[Consolidated Aircraft]] company had existed before that, and had produced aircraft that were important in the early years of [[World War II]], especially the B-24 Liberator heavy bomber and the [[PBY Catalina]] for the [[U.S. Navy]], the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], the British flying forces, and some others. The Catalina remained in production through May 1945, and a total of over 4,000 of them were built. What was soon to be called "Convair" (first unofficially, and then officially), was created in 1943 by the merger of the [[Consolidated Aircraft]] Company and the [[Vultee Aircraft]] Company. This merger produced a large [[aircraft manufacturer|airplane company]], ranked fourth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts, higher than the giants like [[Douglas Aircraft]], [[Boeing]], and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]].<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619</ref> Convair always had most of its research, design, and manufacturing operations in [[San Diego County]] of [[Southern California]], and nearby counties, though other locations were involved, as well.

== Jet Age, Cold War, and Space Age ==
In March 1953, all of the Convair company was bought by the [[General Dynamics Corporation]], a conglomerate of military and high-technology companies, and it became officially the '''Convair Division''' within General Dynamics.<ref name=cent>{{cite web | url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/generaldynamics/Aero35.htm | title=General Dynamics Corporation | work=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission | accessdate=2006-03-31 }}</ref>

After the beginning of the [[Jet Age]] of military fighters and bombers, Convair was a pioneer of the delta-winged aircraft design, along with the French [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]] aircraft company, which designed and built the [[Dassault Mirage|Mirage fighter plane]]s.

One of Convair's most famous products was the ten-engined [[Convair B-36]] strategic bomber, burning four [[turbojets]] and turning six pusher propellers driven by [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360]] Wasp Major radial piston engines. The [[Convair B-36]] was the largest landbased piston engined bomber in the world. The [[Atlas missile]], the [[F-102 Delta Dagger]] and [[F-106 Delta Dart]] delta-winged interceptors, and the delta-winged [[B-58 Hustler]] supersonic intercontinental nuclear bomber were all Convair products. For a period of time in the 1960s, Convair manufactured its own line of jet commercial airliners, the [[Convair 880]] and [[Convair 990]], but this did not turn out to be a profitable business. However, Convair found that it was profitable to become an aviation subcontractor and to manufacture large subsections of airliners, such as fuselages for the larger airliner companies, [[McDonnell Douglas]], [[Boeing]], and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]. The Convair Division produced its own airplane designs, such as several airliners, until 1965, when it shifted from these to [[airframe]]/[[aerostructure]] subcontracting projects for other companies.

In the 1950s Convair shifted money and effort into its missile and rocket projects, producing the [[Terrier missile]] ship-launched surface-to-air system for the U.S. Navy during the 1960s and 1970s. Convair's [[Atlas rocket]] was originally developed in 1957 as an [[ICBM]] for the [[U.S. Air Force]]. It was replaced in 1962 by the room-temperature liquid-fueled [[Titan II missile]] and the solid-fueled [[Minuteman missile]]. The Atlas rocket transitioned into a civilian launch vehicle and was used for the first orbital manned U.S. space flights during [[Project Mercury]] in 1962 and 1963.

The [[Atlas rocket]] became a very reliable booster for launching of satellites and continued to evolve, remaining in use into the 21st century, when combined with the [[Centaur (rocket)|Centaur]] upper stage to form the [[Atlas-Centaur]] rocket for launching geosynchronous [[communication satellite]]s and space probes. The Centaur rocket was also designed, developed, and produced by Convair, and it was the first widely used outer space rocket to use the all-[[cryogenic]] fuel-oxidizer combination of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The use of this liquid hydrogen <U+2013> liquid oxygen combination in the Centaur was an important direct precursor to the use of the same fuel-oxidizer combination in the Saturn [[S-II]] second stage and the Saturn [[S-IVB]] third stage of the gigantic [[Saturn V]] moon rocket of the [[Apollo project]]. The S-IVB had earlier also been used as the second stage of the smaller [[Saturn IB]] rocket, such as the one which was used to launch [[Apollo 7]]. The Centaur upper stage was first designed and developed for launching the [[Surveyor Program|Surveyor]] lunar landers, beginning in 1966, to augment the delta-V of the Atlas rockets and give them enough payload capability to deliver the required mass of the Surveyors to the Moon.  

More than 100 Convair-produced Atlas-Centaur rockets (including those with their successor designations) were used to successfully launch over 100 satellites, and among their many other outer-space missions, they launched the [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11]] space probes, the first two to be launched on trajectories that carried them out of the [[Solar System]].

In addition to aircraft, missiles and space vehicles, Convair developed the large [[Charactron]] vacuum tubes, which were the precursors of modern [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) computer displays,<ref>{{cite web|title=Charactron Tube |publisher=Computing at Chilton, of [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]], [[Chilton, Oxfordshire|Chilton]] |date=2006-08-05 |url=http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acl/technology/sc4020/p002.htm |accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> and to give an example of a minor product, the [[CORDIC]] algorithms, which is widely used today to calculate [[trigonometric function]]s in [[calculator]]s, [[field-programmable gate array]]s, and other small electronic systems.

== Dissolution ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2011}} 
In 1994, the General Dynamics Corporation split and sold the original Convair Division, along with other General Dynamics aerospace units that had been swept into it over the decades. The [[airframe]]/[[aerostructure]]s manufacturing company and the space boosters company (both mostly in California) were sold to the [[McDonnell Douglas Corporation]]. The [[Fort Worth, Texas]] factory and its associated engineering locations and laboratories <U+2013> which had been previously used for the manufacture of hundreds of General Dynamics [[F-111 Aardvark]] fighter-bombers and [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] fighters for the U.S. Air Force, along with dozens of smaller projects <U+2013> were sold, along with all intellectual property and the legal rights to the products that were being designed and built within, to the [[Lockheed Corporation]]. In 1996, General Dynamics deactivated all of the remaining legal entities of the Convair Division.

Note: U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy aircraft designations that begin with "X" are merely experimental models of aircraft made only in small numbers. Military aircraft designations that begin with "Y" are developmental models made in small batches, which may or may not have subsequently entered large-scale production.

In the former designation system that the Navy and the Marine Corps used, a final letter of "Y" identified a Convair or a Consolidated product, such as the PBY-5 flying boat.
