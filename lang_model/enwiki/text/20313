'''KZWB''' (97.9 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) is an [[radio station]] broadcasting from [[Green River, Wyoming]]. The station signed on June 1, 2005. KZWB is owned by Wagonwheel Communications Corporation, who also owns [[KUGR]] and KZWB's two sister stations [[KYCS]] and [[KFRZ]]. <ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=KZWB |title=KZWB Facility Record |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.arbitron.com/sip/displaySip.do?surveyID=SU08&band=fm&callLetter=KZWB|title=KZWB Station Information Profile|publisher=[[Arbitron]]}}</ref>

KZWB specializes in a [[classic hits]] music format that plays music from primarily the 1960s, and 1970s, but occasionally plays music from the 1980s.

==Signal==
KZWB, like its sister stations, broadcasts from [[Wilkins Peak]] just outside of [[Rock Springs, Wyoming]] in [[Sweetwater County]]. The station shares tower space with KFRZ but does not broadcast at 100,000 [[watt]]s. Instead, carrying a 10,500 [[watt]] signal to protect a [[KBZN|station]] in Utah, the signal reaches the majority of Sweetwater County, and begins to weaken near [[Rawlins, Wyoming|Rawlins]] to the east, and [[Mountain View, Wyoming|Mountain View]] to the west. The signal reaches into parts of northeastern [[Utah]], and as far north as [[Pinedale, Wyoming|Pinedale]].<ref>[http://www.radio-locator.com/pats/KZWB_FM_LU.gif KZWB Coverage Map]</ref> KZWB and KFRZ are both at {{convert|7646|ft|m|0}} above sea level on Wilkins Peak.

==Translator==
In addition to the main station, KZWB is relayed by an additional translator to widen its broadcast area. The translator broadcasts from Wilkins Peak as well.
