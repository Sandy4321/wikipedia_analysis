'''Giltspur Street''' is a street in [[Smithfield]], [[London]], running north-south from the junction of Newgate Street, Holborn Viaduct, and [[Old Bailey]] up to West Smithfield, and it is bounded to the east by [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] (Bart's).

In [[1381]] [[King Richard II]] met the leaders of the [[Peasants' Revolt]] here on [[15 June]], promising to agree to the rebels' demands, which included a repeal of the Statute of Labourers that prevented workers changing jobs for better pay.  However, during the negotiations [[William Walworth]], the [[Lord Mayor of London]], lured [[Wat Tyler]] away and stabbed him, and when Tyler took refuge in St Bartholemew's church he was dragged out and beheaded.  The Revolt later subsided.

Located on the junction of Giltspur Street and Cock Lane is The Golden Boy of Pye Corner, a cherub which is a symbol of [[gluttony]], the sin which supposedly led to divine retribution in the form of the [[Great Fire of London]].  The inscription reads:

:"The Boy at Pye Corner was erected to commemorate the staying of the Great Fire which beginning at Pudding Lane was ascribed to the sin of gluttony when not attributed to the Papists as on the Monument, and the Boy was made prodigiously fat to enforce the moral." 

He was originally built into the front of a [[public house]] called The Fortune of War which used to occupy this site and was pulled down in 1910.
The Fortune of War was the chief house of call north of the river for [[resurrectionists]] in body snatching days years ago. The landlord used to show the room whereon benches round the walls were placed with the snatchers' names waiting till the surgeons at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] could run round and appraise them.

The street also gave its name to the [[Giltspur Street Compter]], a small [[prison]] located on the street from 1791 to 1855.
