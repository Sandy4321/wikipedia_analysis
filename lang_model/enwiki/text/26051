This is well into autumn in that part of the world and although the winds can be favourable, the chances are that the first part of the course, to Cape Finisterre across the Bay of Biscay, will be sailed upwind. The chances are also strong that the fleet will encounter gale and storm force headwinds crossing the Bay of Biscay. Three races ago (1992-93) the first few days of the race took a terrible toll on the fleet and Nigel Burgess was lost overboard from his boat.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DB1F39F934A15752C1A964958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/B/Boats%20and%20Boating|title=YACHT RACING; Solo Sailor in Global Race Found Dead Off Spain's Coast|publisher=New York Times|quote=Burgess's death came one day after the Coast Guard ended its search for Mike Plant, who disappeared while en route to the start of this race, called the Vendee Globe Challenge... ...Burgess was a close friend of Plant's, and their relationship might have inspired Burgess, an experienced sailor who had crossed the Atlantic three times, to enter the Vendee Globe race.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nigel Burgess Obituary|publisher=The Times |city=London|date=December 17 1992|quote=The rarified milieu of the super-rich that surrounds the harbors of Cannes, Antibes and Monte Carlo was 'the office' for Burgess.
