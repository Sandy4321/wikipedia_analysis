The '''SS ''Kamloops''''' was a [[lake freighter]] that was part of the fleet of [[Canada Steamship Lines]] from its launching in 1924 until it sank with all hands off [[Isle Royale]] in [[Lake Superior]] on or about 7 December 1927.

==The ''canaller''==
Steamship ''Kamloops'' was built by Furness Shipbuilding Co. Ltd.<ref name="Kamloops"/> in [[Haverton Hill]] within [[Stockton-on-Tees]] in the northeast of [[England]] for Steamships Ltd of [[Montreal, Quebec]].<ref name = "underwater">{{cite | title = Submerged Cultural Resources Study: Isle Royale National Park | author1 = Daniel Lenihan | author2 = Toni Carrell | author3 = Thom Holden | author4 = C. Patrick Labadie | author5 = Larry Murphy | author6 = Ken Vrana | editor = Daniel Lenihan | year = 1987 | publisher = Southwest Cultural Resources Center | pages = 187-209, 326-334 | url = http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/isro/isro.pdf}}</ref>  With a length of only 250 feet (75 m) and rated at 2,402 gross tons,<ref name = "underwater"/> the ''Kamloops'' was a relatively small vessel for the Great Lakes in the 1920s.<ref name="Kamloops"/>  She was built to fit inside the locks of the [[Welland Canal]] and other Canadian-operated canals of the lower Great Lakes and [[St. Lawrence River]] during the years prior to the construction of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]].<ref name="Kamloops"/>  The ship had two rigged masts, and a 1000HP triple expansion steam engine with [[Scotch boiler]]s.<ref name = "underwater"/>

''Kamloops'' completed its sea testing on July 5, 1924, then shipped to [[Copenhagen, Denmark]] to pick up freight, then on to Montreal and [[Houghton, Michigan]].<ref name = "underwater"/> As a ''canaller'', the ''Kamloops'' carried diversified "package" freight from Canadian port to port.  Her chief duty was carrying manufactured goods from [[Montreal]] up the lakes to [[Thunder Bay]].<ref name="Kamloops"/>  During the 1920s, Canada was part of the [[British Empire]]; economically fast-growing areas within the Empire, such as the [[Prairie Provinces]], bought most of their manufactured goods from the home country, England.  Canada's freshwater fleet, including the ''Kamloops'', was an essential link in this vein of imperial commerce.<ref name="Boyer">{{cite book | year = 1968 | author = [[Dwight Boyer]] | title = Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes | publisher = Dodd, Mead & Company | location = New York City, N.Y. | id = LOC #68-23094  }}</ref>

It is the custom of Great Lakes shipping to try to move as much freight as possible before winter and associated [[ice]] conditions bring boat movements to a halt.  The owners operated the ship as late into the season as possible: in 1924 it was one of the last vessels to pass through the [[Sault Ste. Marie Canal]], and in 1926 it ended the season stuck in the ice in the [[St. Mary's River]].<ref name = "underwater"/> The ''Kamloops'' remained under British registry until 1926, when it was nominally purchased by new owners, Canada Steamship Lines, and re-registered in Canada.<ref name = "underwater"/> 

==December 1927==
The ''Kamloops'' was dispatched up the lakes in late November 1927, carrying a mixed cargo of [[papermaking]] [[machinery]], coiled [[wire]] for range [[agricultural fencing|fencing]], [[shoe]]s, [[pipe (material)|piping]], and [[tar paper]].<ref name="Kamloops"/> On 1 December, the steamer called at [[Courtright, Ontario]], to top off its cargo with some bagged [[salt]].<ref name = "underwater"/>  It then steamed up [[Lake Huron]], passed through the Sault Ste. Marie Canal on 4 December, and faced the challenge of Lake Superior.

Unfortunately for the ''Kamloops'' and other vessels assigned to Lake Superior runs, a massive storm began hammering the lake on 5 December.  The ''Kamloops'', heavily coated with ice, was last seen steaming towards the southeastern shore of Isle Royale at dusk on the following day, 6 December.<ref name = "underwater"/>  A search for the vessel began on 12 December, concentrating on the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] and Isle Royale; the search continued until 22 December.<ref name = "underwater"/>  However, the ship and the 22 men and women aboard were never again seen alive.<ref name="Boyer"/> 

When the 1928 navigation season opened in April, a further search was made for wreckage from the ''Kamloops''.<ref name = "underwater"/>  In May, fishermen discovered the remains of several crewmembers at Twelve O'Clock Point on Isle Royale (erroneously reported to be on the nearby [[Amygdaloid Island]])<ref name = "underwater"/><ref name="Kamloops">{{cite web | title = The History of the ''Kamloops'' | publisher = Superior Trips LLC| location = Fridley, Minn| date = (no date) | url = http://www.superiortrips.com/Kamloops_Shipwreck.htm | accessdate =  13 August 2007}}</ref>  In addition, wreckage from the ship was discoverd ashore.<ref name = "underwater"/>  In June, more bodies were discovered, and a more comprehensive search for the wreck and crewmembers was undertaken, but nothing was found.<ref name = "underwater"/>

==The ''Kamloops'' today==
For fifty years, the ''Kamloops'' was one of the ''Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes'', having sunk without a trace.  However, on August 21, 1977,<ref name = "underwater"/> her wreck was discovered northwest of Isle Royale, near what is now known as ''Kamloops Point'', by a group of sport divers carrying out a systematic search for the ship.<ref name = "underwater"/> The wreck was discovered sitting on the lake bottom under more than 270 feet (80 m) of water.<ref name = "irnp">{{cite web | title = Scuba Diving | publisher = Isle Royal National Park, National Park Service | url = http://www.nps.gov/isro/planyourvisit/scuba-diving.htm | accessdate = December 10, 2010}}</ref> The ship is lying on its starboard side at the bottom of an underwater cliff.<ref name="Kamloops"/>  Cargo is strewn near the ship on the lake floor and the holds still contain wire fencing, high-top shoes, candy life-savers, and crates of Honey Bee Molasses.<ref name="Kamloops"/>  There are still human remains aboard the ship.<ref name="Kamloops"/>  Approximately 50 dives  were made to the ''Kamloops'' in 2009 out of 1062 dives made to wrecks in the [[Isle Royale National Park]].<ref name = "green">{{cite | title = A Diver<U+2019>s Experience | author = Pete Sweger | periodical = The Greenstone 2010 | date = 2010 | page = 9 | url = http://www.nps.gov/isro/planyourvisit/upload/Greenstone_2010.pdf}}</ref>  The cause of her sinking remained a mystery as of 2007.<ref name="Kamloops"/>
