'''Judith Marjorie Collins''' (born [[May 1]], [[1939]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[folk singer|folk]] and [[pop standards|standards]] [[singer]] and [[songwriter]], known for the stunning purity of her [[soprano]]; for her eclectic tastes in the material she records (which has included folk, [[showtunes]], pop, and [[rock and roll]]); and for her [[social activism]].

==Biography==

As a child Collins studied [[classical music|classical]] [[piano]] with Antonia Brico, making her public debut at age 13 performing [[Mozart]]'s ''Concerto for Two Pianos''. 

However, it was the music of [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Pete Seeger]], and the [[traditional music|traditional]] songs of the [[folk revival]] of the early [[1960s]], that piqued Collins' interest and awoke in her a love of [[lyrics]]. Three years after her debut as a piano [[Child prodigy|prodigy]], she was playing [[guitar]]. She eventually made her way to [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City]], where she [[busking|busked]] and played in clubs until she signed with [[Elektra Records]], a record label with which she was associated for 35 years. In 1961, Collins released her first album, ''[[A Maid of Constant Sorrow]]'', at the age of 22. 

At first, she sang traditional folk songs, or songs written by others, in particular the social [[poetry|poets]] of the time, such as [[Tom Paxton]], [[Phil Ochs]], and [[Bob Dylan]]. She recorded her own versions of seminal songs of the period, such as Dylan's "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" and [[Pete Seeger]]'s "[[Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is A Season)|Turn, Turn, Turn]]". Collins was also instrumental in bringing little known [[musician]]s to a wider public (in much the same way [[Joan Baez]] brought [[Bob Dylan]] into the public eye). For example, Collins recorded songs by [[Canada|Canadian]] poet [[Leonard Cohen]], who would become a close friend over the years.  She would also go on to record songs by [[singer-songwriters]] like [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Randy Newman]], and [[Richard Farina]], long before they gained the national acclaim they would later achieve.

While Collins' first few albums comprised straightforward guitar-based folk songs, with [[1966 in music|1966]]'s ''In My Life'', she began branching out and including work from such diverse sources as [[The Beatles]], Cohen, [[Jacques Brel]] and [[Kurt Weill]].  [[Joshua Rifkin]] produced and arranged the album, adding lush [[orchestration]] to many of the numbers.  The album was regarded as a major departure for a folk artist, and set the course for Collins' subsequent work over the next decade.

With her [[1967 in music|1967]] album ''[[Wildflowers (1967 album)|Wildflowers]]'', also produced and arranged by Rifkin, Collins began to record her own compositions, the first of which was entitled "Since You've Asked".  The album also provided Collins with a major hit, and a [[Grammy award]], in Mitchell's "[[Both Sides Now (song)|Both Sides Now]]", which reached #8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].

Collins' [[1968 in music|1968]] album, ''[[Who Knows Where the Time Goes]]'', was produced by [[David Anderle]] and featured back-up guitar by [[Steven Stills]] (of [[Crosby, Stills & Nash (and Young)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]), with whom she was romantically involved at the time. (She was the inspiration for two notable songs by Stills: the [[Buffalo Springfield]]'s haunting "Bluebird", and the CSN classic, "[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]"). ''Time Goes'' had a mellow [[country music|country]] sound, and included [[Ian Tyson]]'s "[[Someday Soon]]" and the [[title track]], a [[Sandy Denny]] song which has since been covered by several artists. The album also featured Collins' composition, "My Father," and one of the first covers of Leonard Cohen's "Bird on a Wire."

By the [[1970s]], Collins had a solid reputation as an [[art song]] singer and folksinger, and had begun to stand out for her own compositions. She was also known for her broad range of material: her songs from this period include the traditional [[Christian]] [[hymn]] "[[Amazing Grace]]", the [[Stephen Sondheim]] Broadway [[ballad]] "[[Send in the Clowns]]" (both of which were top 20 hits as singles), a recording of [[Joan Baez]]' "A Song For David," and her own compositions, such as "[[Born to the Breed]]".

In 1979, Collins posed nude for the album "Hard Times For Lovers".

Collins later admitted suffering from the eating disorder [[bulimia]] after she quit smoking in the 1970s. "I went straight from the cigarettes into an eating disorder," she told [[People Magazine]] in 1992. "I started throwing up. I didn't know anything about bulimia, certainly not that it is an addiction or that it would get worse. My feelings about myself, even though I had been able to give up smoking and lose 20 lbs., were of increasing despair."

In more recent years Collins has taken to writing, producing a memoir, "Trust Your Heart" in 1987, as well as a novel, "Shameless". A more recent memoir, "Sanity and Grace" tells the story of her son, Clark, and his death from suicide in January 1992. Though her record sales are not what they once were, she still records and tours in the U.S., Europe, Australia and New Zealand.  She performed at [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Bill Clinton]]'s first inauguration in 1993, singing "[[Amazing Grace]]" and "[[Chelsea Morning]]". (The Clintons have stated that their daughter Chelsea was named after Collins' recording of the song.)

==Activism==
Like many other folk singers of her generation, Collins was drawn to social activism. She is a representative for [[UNICEF]] and campaigns on behalf of the abolition of [[land mine|landmines]]. Following the 1992 death of her son, Clark Taylor, at age 33, after a long bout with depression and substance abuse, she has also become a strong advocate of [[suicide]] prevention. Her 2003 book,  ''Sanity & Grace'', chronicles her recovery from her son's suicide and attempts to provide some comfort and guidance to other families dealing with the loss of a loved one to suicide. She describes the "Seven T's" as a means for going through this process of recovery:  Truth, Therapy, Trust, Try, Treat, Treasure, and Thrive. The Truth is that there should be no guilt in suicide; Therapy helps people express their emotions and seek grief counseling; Trust is the effort to believe that one can make it through the loss and keep a belief in life and in the future; Try means to stay away from drugs and alcohol or any excess--including overeating--as a means to deal with the loss and pain; Treat means to take care of the mind, body, and spirit with exercise and meditation; Treasure means to keep the memory of the moments to be treasured, and for this Collins recommends writing and keeping a journal; and Thrive means to be positive, hopeful, open to love and others, and continuing to know that you can rebuild your life on a basis of hope.
