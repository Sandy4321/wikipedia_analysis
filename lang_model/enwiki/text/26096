'''HMS ''Vigilant''''' was a [[merchantman]] converted into a warship during the [[American Revolution]]. After serving as a transport in North American waters from 1775, she was purchased by the [[Royal Navy]] (RN) and modified for [[shore bombardment]] duties in 1777. She was instrumental in the eventual British success during the [[siege of Fort Mifflin]] that same year and supported British operations in Georgia and South Carolina in 1779<U+2013>80. Her heavy armament proved to be more than ''Vigilant'' was designed to handle and she was condemned and disposed of in 1780.

==Service and description==
Built at [[Whitby]] in 1774, the ship was named the ''Grand Duchess of Russia'' and she was chartered by the [[Navy Board]] to serve as a transport at the beginning of 1775. While being modified at [[Deptford Dockyard]] in February, the ship was surveyed and found to be [[barque]]-rigged and just over 308 tons [[Builder's Old Measurement|burthen]] in size. A survey in New York two years later gave her length as {{convert|120|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}, measured at the ([[keel]]), with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}.{{#tag:ref|Syrett comments that the RN used a special system to determine tonnage for chartered transports, but refers the reader to his book, "Shipping and the Atlantic War, 1775<U+2013>1783" for details.<ref name=s7/>|group=Note}} Naval historian Rif Winfield quotes her tonnage as 684 <small>{{fraction|14|94}}</small> burthen with a length at the [[gundeck]] of {{convert|122|ft|6|in|m|1}} and beam of {{convert|34|ft|10|in|m|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=w9>Winfield, p. 359</ref>

''Grand Duchess of Russia'' departed for [[Boston]], Massachusetts carrying 150 marines on 30 March 1775 and she remained in North American waters for the next two years. [[Vice Admiral]] [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], commander of the [[North American Station]], informed the [[Admiralty]] on 23 April that he had purchased the ''Grand Duchess of Russia'' and commissioned her as HMS ''Vigilant'' to bombard targets ashore.<ref name=s7>Syrett, p. 57</ref>{{#tag:ref|Winfield says that she was "taken up' on 23 April and not purchased until 6 September 1777. She was commissioned as a [[sixth rate]] in November 1777.<ref name=w9/>|group=Note}} The ship received fourteen 24-pounder guns from the 50-gun ship {{HMS|Centurion|1774|2}} and two 9-pounder and four 6-pounder guns from the [[hospital ship|hospital]] [[prison ship|(prison) ship]] {{HMS|Jersey|1736|2}}. Additional [[Glossary of nautical terms#G|gun ports]] were cut in ''Vigilant''{{'}}s side to allow two guns to be switched from one side to give her a [[broadside]] of nine guns. The 150 men of her crew were made up from the crews of Howe's [[flagship]], the [[third rate]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|2}}, ''Centurion'', and the [[fourth rate]] {{HMS|Preston|1757|2}} while her 30 [[Royal Marines|marines]] were drawn from the marine [[brigade]] at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]].<ref>Syrett, pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref> 

Her conversion was completed by the end of June and her first task was to cover the evacuation of British troops from [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey]] on 29 July. The following month, ''Vigilant'' served as Howe's flagship when he landed British troops at [[Elkton, Maryland]], at the northern end of [[Chesapeake Bay]], during the [[Philadelphia Campaign]]. In October, the ship sailed for the mouth of the [[Delaware River]] to attack the American fortifications defending [[Philadelphia]]. During this voyage, she rolled so badly during heavy weather that the [[round shot]] fell out of her guns and it was later decided that she should not put to sea with her guns mounted except during the summer months. ''Vigilant'' was not designed to carry such heavy weights as the {{convert|2200|lb|adj=on}} 24 pounders up high in the ship and cutting gun ports in her sides further weakened her structure.<ref>Syrett, pp. 58, 61</ref>

The first attack on [[Fort Mifflin]] on 22<U+2013>23 October had been a disaster with two British ships run aground and burnt. For the second attack three weeks later, ''Vigilant''{{'}}s crew was reinforced with an extra 50 men to work the guns and 24 riflemen to suppress the defenders of the fort during the attack. The ship's sides were reinforced and two guns were transferred to the starboard side of the ship. Her trim was maintained by placing casks of water on the port side. While other ships bombarded the fort from the main channel, ''Vigilant'' and a smaller ship worked their way up a secondary channel to the rear of the fort. They were able to silence the fort's guns by 6 p.m., and the Americans evacuated five hours later, despite the ship's [[grapeshot]] and small arms fire. During the attack ''Vigilant'' only lost three men killed and five wounded; her hull had only been hit several times, but her [[rigging]] was shot to pieces. In recognition of the ship's success, her commander, [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] John Henry, was promoted to the command of the frigate {{HMS|Fowey|1749|2}}.<ref>Syrett, pp. 58<U+2013>59</ref>

''Vigilant'' was generally inactive while the British occupied Philadelphia, but she sailed to [[New York City]] when the British evacuated the city in June 1778. She joined the small British squadron there upon the approach of a French squadron under the command of the [[Comte d'Estaing]] in July, but the French declined to engage the British ships. The ship accompanied the British squadron to [[Newport, Rhode Island]] as it attempted to lift the [[Battle of Rhode Island|Franco-American siege]], but ''Vigilant'' was badly damaged when a storm interrupted the planned battle on 13 August. Despite the damage, she supported British troops on 29<U+2013>30 August as they pursued the retreating Americans who had abandoned the siege after the French ships sailed to Boston for repairs. A few days later, on 4 September, the ship collided with the [[sloop-of-war]] [[HMS Vesuvius (1771)|''Raven'']] during the [[Grey's raid|British raid]] on [[New London, Connecticut]] and had her bow stove in by the other ship. ''Vigilant'' was quickly repaired in New York and participated in the [[Battle of Chestnut Neck|attack on Little Egg Harbor River]] in October.<ref>Syrett, pp. 59<U+2013>60</ref>

At the beginning of December, the ship sailed from New York to [[Savannah, Georgia]] to assist in the [[Capture of Savannah|attack]] on that city. Despite dismounting her main armament, the ship had to keep one or more pumps running continuously during the voyage to prevent her from sinking. She arrived at Savannah on 28 December, after the British had secured the city.<ref name=s1/> Her nine-pounder guns were ordered removed when she was reclassified as an 20-gun armed transport on 22 December.<ref name=w9/> Throughout 1779, ''Vigilant'' supported British operations along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, despite running aground several times. Lacking substantial repairs during this time, the ship's condition deteriorated until her crew refused to take her to sea from [[Beaufort, South Carolina]] on 28 February 1780 to support the planned [[siege of Charleston]]. She was then surveyed and condemned as "utterly unfit for sea"<ref name=s1>Syrett, p. 61</ref> and decommissioned on 9 April.{{#tag:ref|Winfield give a decommissioning date of 17 August after which she was burnt.<ref name=w9/>|group=Note}} Her crew and armament were loaded aboard the transport ''Margaret & Martha'' and taken to Charleston where they were transferred to the transport ''Margery'',{{#tag:ref|Colledge gives this ship's name as ''Majority''.<ref>Colledge, p. 309</ref>|group=Note}} which had been purchased and renamed {{HMS|Sandwich|1780|2}} to serve as ''Vigilant''{{'}}s replacement.<ref>Syrett, pp. 60<U+2013>61</ref> The ship was burnt at Beaufort sometime later that year.<ref>Colledge, p. 374</ref>
