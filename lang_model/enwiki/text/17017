'''''Nocturne''''' is a live double-album by [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], released in 1983 and [[remastered]] in 2009, which features performances recorded at two shows at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on September 30 and October 1, 1983, featuring [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] (of [[The Cure]]) on guitar.
Most of the songs are from  ''[[Juju (Siouxsie & the Banshees album)|Juju]]'' and ''[[A Kiss in the Dreamhouse]]'', with a couple of non-LP tracks ("Pulled to Bits" and "Eve White/Eve Black").  Also included is a live version of [[The Beatles]]' "Dear Prudence," a studio version of which the Banshees recorded earlier that year and released as a single.

Its video version was released on [[DVD]] in 2006. Bonus features included the "Play At Home" TV special from 1983, "Dear Prudence" music video, and performances from [[The Old Grey Whistle Test]].

The music used at the introduction of "Israel" is "[[The Rite of Spring]]", composed by [[Igor Stravinsky]].

==Background==
[[File:Siouxsie and the banshees 1979 with robert smith.jpg|right|260px|thumb|Siouxsie and the Banshees with Robert Smith and the Cure outside Morgan Studios, London in September 1979, left to right: Robert Smith, Laurence Tolhurst, Michael Dempsey, Budgie, Steven Severin and Siouxsie]]
The Banshees had already performed live with Robert Smith on guitar in September and October 1979: Robert Smith and his band The Cure were then the support band of the Banshees. A friendship had started at the time between the members of The Cure and The Banshees. In late 1982, when guitarist [[John McGeoch]] left the band prior to the ''[[A Kiss in the Dreamhouse]]'' tour, Steven Severin asked Robert Smith to join the band for the tour. In September 1983, Robert Smith became an official member of the Banshees at the release of the "[[Dear_Prudence#Cover_versions|Dear Prudence]]" single: a few weeks later, they recorded this live album ''Nocturne'' in London.
