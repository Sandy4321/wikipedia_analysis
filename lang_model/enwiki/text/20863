"'''Special Education'''" is the ninth episode of the [[Glee (season 2)|second season]] of the American musical television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and the 31st episode overall. It was written by series creator [[Brad Falchuk]], directed by [[Paris Barclay]], and aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox]] in the United States on November&nbsp;30, 2010. In "Special Education", the McKinley High School [[glee club]] New Directions competes in the Sectionals round of [[show choir]] competition against the Hipsters and the Dalton Academy Warblers, while dealing with internal feuding that threatens to rip the club apart.

The episode shows the former member of New Directions, [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]), at his new school Dalton Academy, where he joins the rival Warblers. With his departure, New Directions must find a new twelfth member to remain eligible for the competition. Club director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) decides to feature overlooked performers from the group for Sectionals, to the consternation of the usual lead singers, [[Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]) and [[Finn Hudson]] ([[Cory Monteith]]). The episode received a wide range of reviews, with a small majority commenting favorably; some viewed it as a lesser version of the first season's Sectionals episode. By contrast, the six songs covered during the show received generally favorable reviews, with the most praise going to "Dog Days Are Over" and "Valerie" as performed by New Directions, and "Hey, Soul Sister" as sung by the Warblers.

Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 11.68&nbsp;million American viewers and garnered a 4.6/13 [[Nielsen ratings#Ratings/share and total viewers|Nielsen rating/share]] in the [[Nielsen ratings#Demographics|18<U+2013>49 demographic]], up significantly from the previous episode, "[[Furt]]".

The show choir [[Sectionals]] competition is imminent,<ref group=note>The first Sectionals event was seen in the [[Glee (season 1)|season one]] episode entitled "[[Sectionals]]".</ref> and the New Directions glee club is one below the required minimum of twelve members now that [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]) has transferred to Dalton Academy, home of Sectionals rivals the Warblers. At club director [[Will Schuester]]'s ([[Matthew Morrison]]) behest, [[Puck (Glee)|Puck]] ([[Mark Salling]]) attempts to recruit from his football teammates, but they lock him in a [[portable toilet|port-a-potty]]. He is rescued the next day by AV Club president and wrestler [[Lauren Zizes]] ([[Ashley Fink]]), and she agrees to join New Directions, though he has to bribe her first.

Will invites school guidance counselor [[Emma Pillsbury]] ([[Jayma Mays]]) to accompany him to Sectionals. She accepts, and suggests he consider featuring other club members instead of his usual choices, co-captains [[Finn Hudson]] ([[Cory Monteith]]) and [[Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]). Will gives the lead vocals for one song to duets competition winners [[Quinn Fabray]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) and [[Sam Evans]] ([[Chord Overstreet]]),<ref group=note>The duets competition occurred in the [[Glee (season 2)|season two]] episode entitled "[[Duets]]".</ref> which upsets Rachel and Finn, while [[Brittany Pierce]] ([[Heather Morris (actress)|Heather Morris]]) and [[Mike Chang]] ([[Harry Shum, Jr.]]) are given lead dancing roles on another number. When Brittany admits she is nervous about performing, her boyfriend [[Artie Abrams]] ([[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]) gives her a "magic comb" to boost her confidence. She and Mike commence time-consuming rehearsals for their dance routine, and Mike's girlfriend [[Tina Cohen-Chang]] ([[Jenna Ushkowitz]]) suspects that they are having an affair; when Artie confronts Brittany about it, she confesses that she has been avoiding him because she lost his comb. Artie admits that the comb was never magical, and tells Brittany that she is magic.

Kurt attends his first meeting with the Dalton Academy Warblers. He learns that the [[setlist]] for Sectionals is selected by a council of upperclassmen, and is offered a chance to audition for a solo at Sectionals. He visits Rachel for advice, and at her recommendation sings "[[Don't Cry for Me Argentina]]" from the musical ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]''. Kurt is not given a solo, and his friend [[Blaine Anderson|Blaine]] ([[Darren Criss]]) suggests that he try to fit in rather than stand out.

[[Santana Lopez|Santana]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) tells Rachel that she and Finn had sex the previous spring, and Rachel is furious that Finn's claim to be a virgin was a lie. Emma counsels them, and then realizes that she should not attend Sectionals with Will since her boyfriend [[Carl Howell|Carl]] ([[John Stamos]]) would be hurt; she and Carl fly to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] for the weekend.

At sectionals, the Hipsters and the Warblers perform first, the latter singing [[Train (band)|Train]]'s "[[Hey, Soul Sister]]" with Blaine on lead. Despite much backstage drama, the New Directions set goes smoothly, with Quinn and Sam performing "[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life]]" and Santana singing lead on [[Amy Winehouse]]'s cover of [[The Zutons]]' "[[Valerie (The Zutons song)|Valerie]]"; Brittany and Mike receive several bursts of applause for their dancing. New Directions and the Warblers tie for first place, which means that both groups will advance to the Regionals competition. 

Emma tells Will that she married Carl in Las Vegas, and despite his shock, Will says he is happy for her. Finn breaks up with Rachel after she confesses that she made out with Puck to get back at him over Santana. New Directions performs [[Florence and the Machine]]'s "[[Dog Days Are Over]]" to celebrate the club's competition survival, with Tina and [[Mercedes Jones|Mercedes]] ([[Amber Riley]]) singing lead.

===Critical reception===
"Special Education" received a wide range of reviews from television critics, though there seemed to be more positive than negative responses. The most enthusiastic reviewers were from ''[[The Atlantic]]'', where both Kevin Fallon and Patrick Burns declared it the "best episode of ''Glee'' all season", and Meghan Brown suggested that the show should "just do competition episodes from now on".<ref name="ATL">{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/12/glee-sectionals-bring-out-the-best-in-everyone/67198/|title='Glee': Sectionals Bring Out the Best in Everyone|first=Patrick|last=Burns|coauthors=Fallon, Kevin; Brown, Meghan|work=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media Company]]|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}</ref> Aly Semigran of ''[[MTV]]'' was similarly laudatory, and said that the show was "back in top form"; she added that the episode "felt very reminiscent of the magic the first season provided".<ref name="Aly">{{Cite web|url=http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2010/12/01/glee-recap-special-education/|title={{-'}}Glee' Recap: 'Special Education{{'-}}|date=December 1, 2010|first=Aly|last=Semigran|work=Hollywood Crush|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref>

Others were more tempered in their praise. James Poniewozik of ''[[Time]]'' said the episode was "grounded" and "solid-if-not-spectacular", and highlighted how ''Glee'' "has developed into a broad ensemble, where any of several characters is capable of taking the spotlight, even an originally comic-relief character like Brittany."<ref name="Time">{{Cite news|url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2010/12/01/glee-watch-sharing-the-spotlight/|title=Glee Watch: Sharing the Spotlight|date=December 1, 2010|first=James|last=Poniewozik|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref> Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V.

He also stated, "The fact that the Warblers and New Directions tied, while probably necessary for whatever reason, is ridiculously anticlimactic and keeps this episode from an A- pretty much singlehandedly."<ref name="VDW"/>

Amy Reiter of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was disappointed with almost everything, and said the episode "felt more like a long, slow letdown after a season of gleeful highs". She added, "New Directions' sectionals performance wasn't a total fumble, but it wasn't the touchdown you might've hoped for either", and of the long-awaited opportunity to see other members featured in competition: "the anticipated shining moment turned out to be so dull." Reiter was one of a very few critics to note the absence of cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester in the episode, and only when she lamented the "relative lack of humor".<ref name="LAT">{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/12/glee-recap-switching-it-up-at-sectionals.html|title={{'-}}Glee' recap: Switching it up at sectionals|date=December 1, 2010|first=Amy|last=Reiter|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref> Futterman merely remarked on Sue's non-appearance in passing; she came to the conclusion that "we got a spazzy, unfocused hour at the expense of emotional investment", and though Anthony Benigno of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' complimented the "solid acting", he also wrote that "this is the first time the show's started to feel genuinely boring as opposed to, you know, gleeful."<ref name="RS"/><ref name="DailyNews">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/12/01/2010-12-01_glee_recap_special_education_has_rachel_and_finn_breaking_up_emma_getting_marrie.html|title={{-'}}Glee' recap: 'Special Education' has Rachel and Finn breaking up, Emma getting married|date=December 1, 2010|first=Anthony|last=Benigno|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]]|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref> He made a general complaint as well: "This show is starting to suffer in a big way from making the music secondary to the plot."<ref name="DailyNews"/> Robert Canning of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating.

A few reviewers remarked on how the Hipsters seemed to be a reflection of the New Directions crew in fifty years, with Futterman getting into specifics: "We see future Rachel start the number with a cane and future Mercedes break through to finish the song off with a riff, and it's hard not to be endeared to them."<ref name="RS"/> Poniewozik wrote that Rachel's "silent reminder to Kurt to smile on stage was a perfect, sweet little moment", a sentiment shared by Tim Stack of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.<ref name="Time"/><ref name="EW">{{Cite web|url=http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/glee-season-2-episode-9/|title={{-'}}Glee' recap: Performance Anxiety|date=December 1, 2010|first=Tim|last=Stack|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref> Poniewozik also noted that "Lea Michele had some of her strongest non-singing moments of the season by showing not just how Rachel dealt with her problems with Finn but with being on the periphery of the group."<ref name="Time"/> The storyline that featured the disintegration of the Rachel<U+2013>Finn relationship, when commented on at all, was viewed unfavorably; VanDerWerff called it a "stupid twist".<ref name="VDW"/>

Brown praised the addition of Fink as Lauren to New Directions, and declared, "I hope she's on the team for keeps", while Poniewozik was pleased that "the episode used Lauren for comedy without simply making her the butt of jokes".<ref name="ATL"/><ref name="Time"/> Brown also wrote, "Kurt's arc was subtler this week, and thereby about 50 times more interesting. I [<U+2026>] am impressed that ''Glee''{{'s}} handling his acclimation to Dalton so truthfully."<ref name="ATL"/> Canning was similarly impressed, and called Kurt at Dalton "the most solid story" of the episode.<ref name="IGN"/> There was little approval among reviewers for the "canary in a cage" metaphor in the scene between Kurt and Blaine at the end of the episode, with Kurt the "canary" in his new Dalton cage; Hankinson characterized it as "super ham-fisted", and others were nearly as harsh.<ref name="HC"/><ref name="Time"/>

===Music and performances===
[[File:Naya Rivera by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The solo by Santana (Rivera, ''pictured''), her first on the show, garnered rave reviews.]]
The musical performances in this episode were mostly praised by critics, though there was little said about the quality of the abbreviated performance by the Hipsters in competition. There was near-universal approval for the first song heard, "Don't Cry For Me Argentina", which Stack called "totally beautiful" and gave an "A-"; he, like Burns, who said it was "fantastic", loved having "Rachel and Kurt get a chance to sing together".<ref name="EW"/><ref name="ATL"/> Jen Harper of ''[[BuddyTV]]'' echoed Kurt's words in the episode; she said "Rachel really is as talented as she is irritating", but wished she "didn't always look like she's crying while she's singing", and added that she was "really digging Kurt in a lower register".<ref name="Buddy">{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/glee/glee-recap-a-shocking-breakup-38767.aspx|title={{-'}}Glee' Recap: A Shocking Breakup and a Surprise Wedding|date=November 30, 2010|first=Jen|last=Harper|publisher=[[BuddyTV]]|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref> Futterman noted that Rachel, as is usual with her "power ballads", "uses the time to grapple with the latest obstacle to her future stardom, while we see Kurt deliver a clear, restrained take.<ref name="RS"/> Benigno called Michele's voice "astounding", and added that her solo alternated "with Kurt's audition with the Warblers, which is predictably outstanding", and gave the song a "B+".<ref name="DailyNews"/> Even those who disliked the song or the composer were won over by the performance: Berk gave it three stars out of five, and Burns thought it was "fantastic"; both liked the song's tag-team presentation.<ref name="VF">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2010/12/the-gay-guide-to-glee-season-2-episode-9-special-education.html|title=The Gay Guide to ''Glee'': Season 2 Episode 9, "Special Education{{"-}}|date=December 1, 2010|first=Brett|last=Berk|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications]]|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref><ref name="ATL"/>

The performance of Train's "Hey, Soul Sister" by the Dalton Academy Warblers received even more praise than "Don't Cry For Me Argentina". Benigno called it flawless, and gave it an "A++", and Hanh Nguyen of ''[[Zap2it]]'' gave it her "top prize" of the night.<ref name="DailyNews"/><ref name="Zap">{{Cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/11/glee-which-song-was-best-dog-days-are-over-time-of-my-life-hey-soul-sister-and-more.html|title={{-'}}Glee': Which song was best?

I thought they did an amazing job."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Trains-Lead-Singer-1027147.aspx|title=Train's Lead Singer Gets Animated|date=December 27, 2010|first=Megan|last=Walsh-Boyle|work=[[TV Guide]]|publisher=[[Lions Gate Entertainment]]|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref>

The praise was more tepid for Sam and Quinn's "(I've Had) the Time of My Life". Benigno called it "solid", but added "overkill knocks it down to a solid B."<ref name="DailyNews"/> Both Futterman and Stack said the number "fell a little flat", though Stack said the duo had "great physical chemistry".<ref name="RS"/><ref name="EW"/> Fallon characterized it as an "adorable duet".<ref name="ATL"/> Berk gave it five stars of five, his best grade for the episode, and called it "oozy, curdling perfection", while Reiter was the least impressed, and wrote that their "voices (and romantic interplay) seemed wan and thin."<ref name="VF"/><ref name="LAT"/>

The New Directions closing number at Sectionals, "Valerie", received the most commentary, with Santana's solo given enthusiastic praise, though Brittany and Mike's dancing was also lauded. Hankinson, who had tepidly called songs "nice" up to this point, shifted gears and said, "Then Santana burns the roof down with a rendition of Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie'. It was awesome."<ref name="HC"/> Raymund Flandez of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' echoed that fervor: "But then Santana came on and killed. With an on-spot rendition of Mark Ronson/Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie,' and wearing a Snooki bun, Santana was electrifying behind the mic, in an energizing display that revved up the audience", and added, "Brittany and Mike's pas de deux rocked".<ref name="WSJ"/> Benigno opined that "Brittany and Mike Chang handle the moves (extraordinarily well), but the vocals here are what steal it. Naya Rivera (Santana) is completely outstanding on lead vocals, and I can't understand why she hasn't gotten a solo before this"; he gave it an "A".<ref name="DailyNews"/> Stack was slightly less generous with an "A-", and wrote that it was a "great song choice for Santana"; he gave "bonus points for the phenomenal Mike/Brittany choreography", while Harper said that their dancing "totally made the song".<ref name="EW"/><ref name="Buddy"/> Nguyen liked the dancing, but she was critical of how the song sounded, as she felt "it lacked something and didn't really feel worthy of the standing O", while Futterman said "Santana's sassy vocals are a perfect echo of Winehouse's, but the rest of the song feels a bit like a circus".<ref name="Zap"/><ref name="RS"/> Reiter felt the entire song "seemed kind of tacked on", both the dancing and Santana's solo.<ref name="LAT"/>

"Dog Days Are Over" was the favorite song of several reviewers, including Hankinson, who said "it was the exact brand of high-energy jubilation that I love the most."<ref name="HC"/> Harper was also enthusiastic: "This performance for me represents what I like about New Directions<U+2014>and why Kurt needs to come back asap. Everyone got to do their own individual thing, yet they still work really well as a group. I give it best song of the night."<ref name="Buddy"/> In Semigran's view, "From the cute choreographed claps to the unconventional (but oddly fitting) choice to have Tina and Mercedes sing the tune, I wish they'd save this one for regionals. It was a winner", while VanDerWerff wrote, " 'Dog Days Are Over' is right in this show's wheelhouse, so, naturally, it hits the song out of the park."<ref name="Aly"/><ref name="VDW"/> Benigno gave the song a "B+", and Berk awarded three stars out of five, while Stack gave it an "A", and said series creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] "chose the perfect gals to pull off this cover."<ref name="DailyNews"/><ref name="VF"/><ref name="EW"/>
