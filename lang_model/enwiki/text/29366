'''''I Am Not a Human Being II''''' is the tenth studio album by American rapper [[Lil Wayne]], released on March 26, 2013, by [[Young Money Entertainment]], [[Cash Money Records]], and [[Republic Records]]. It serves as the sequel to his eighth album, ''[[I Am Not a Human Being]]'' (2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1697850/lil-wayne-tha-carter-v-last-album-mtv-first.jhtml|title=Lil Wayne: Tha Carter V Is 'My Last Album'|publisher=MTV}}</ref> Its music incorporates [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] styles. As [[executive producer]]s, Wayne, [[Ronald "Slim" Williams]], and [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] enlisted a wide variety of producers, including [[Cool & Dre]], [[David Banner]], [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]], [[Juicy J]], [[Mike Will Made It]], [[Streetrunner]], and [[T-Minus (producer)|T-Minus]].

''I Am Not a Human Being II'' was included in multiple "Most Anticipated Albums of 2013" lists. However, upon its release, the album received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who criticized its production and panned Wayne's lyrics. Four singles have been released from the album thus far. "[[My Homies Still]]", "[[No Worries (Lil Wayne song)|No Worries]]", "[[Love Me (Lil Wayne song)|Love Me]]" and "[[Rich As Fuck]]" peaked at numbers 38, 29, 9, and 45 respectively, on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].  The album debuted at #2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 217,000 copies sold in its first week. As of July 9, 2013 the album has sold 510,000 copies in the United States.

==Background==
In January 2012, [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] confirmed that production was underway for the sequel to Lil Wayne's eighth studio album, ''[[I Am Not a Human Being]]'' (2010), titled ''I Am Not a Human Being II''. Wayne later announced to [[MTV]] that he had completed the album, and put greater attention on quality control than its predecessor; he said he had "rushed" to finish the original before serving his jail sentence for illegal possession of a weapon.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1688952/lil-wayne-album-birdman.jhtml/ Lil Wayne Didn't Rush The Music For I Am Not A Human Being 2].</ref>

In November 2012, Lil Wayne announced that instead of [[Kanye West]] being featured on the album as a musician, as previously reported, he would be designing everything from the cover art to the album packaging. According to Wayne, Kanye had approached him about doing it because he "wanted to package a Wayne album."<ref>[http://rapfix.mtv.com/2012/11/26/kanye-west-designing-lil-wayne-human-being-ii-album/ Kanye West Is Designing Lil Wayne<U+2019>s Human Being II: What Will It Look Like?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On January 30, 2013, the DONDA-designed cover was released. It features a red moth spread across a black background.<ref>[http://www.complex.com/music/2013/01/lil-waynes-donda-designed-i-am-not-a-human-being-ii-artwork-has-arrived Lil Wayne's DONDA-Designed "I Am Not A Human Being II" Artwork Has Arrived | Complex<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On February 1, Lil Wayne explained the cover saying, "he chose the moth butterfly thing because it has so many different stages of life, and it goes through so many forms and changes, and no one can figure it out, and it's always beautiful."<ref>[http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/lil-wayne-explains-moth-inspired-album-cover Lil Wayne Explains Moth-Inspired Album Cover | Complex<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On the day of the albums release DONDA, released an animated version of the album cover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/03/check-out-lil-waynes-i-am-not-a-human-being-ii-animated-cover |title=Check Out Lil Wayne's "I Am Not a Human Being II" Animated Cover |publisher=Complex |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}</ref>

==Music and lyrics==
Much in the vein of Lil Wayne's earlier works, ''I Am Not a Human Being II'' addresses themes of drugs and sex.

Jon Caramanica of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the album "less manic, less experimental, less unpredictable and, oddly, less consistent" than "drug-era Lil Wayne".<ref name="NewYorkTimesReview">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/arts/music/lil-waynes-new-album-is-i-am-not-a-human-being-ii.html?adxnnl=1&ref=music&adxnnlx=1364299428-iP+bwLe4OLHlqznJdKpDIw</ref> Al Horner of ''[[NME]]'' said that "the chilling growl and imaginative [[Auto-Tune]] of hits like '[[Got Money]]' replaced by tired punchlines and lazy [[hook (music)|hooks]]."<ref name="NMEreview">{{cite journal|last=Horner|first=Al|date=April 12, 2013|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/lil-wayne--2/14325|title=Lil Wayne - ' I Am Not A Human Being II'|journal=[[NME]]|location=London|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''{{'}}s Brandon Soderberg felt that the album was a continuation of "Wayne's steady creative decline", adding that "you're better off soaking in the good choices here and resigning yourself to enduring the bad ones."<ref name="SpinReview"/> Dean Van Nguyen of [[PopMatters]] found the beats "dispensable" and said that they "mirror his own boredom with the project."<ref name="PMreview">{{cite web|last=Nguyen|first=Dean Van|date=March 27, 2013|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/169726-lil-wayne-i-am-not-a-human-being-ii/|title=Lil Wayne: I Am Not a Human Being II|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> Ken Capobianco of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' said that, apart from the "potent" "Gunwalk" and "No Worries", the album is "both numbingly haphazard and inconsequential."<ref>{{cite news|last=Capobianco|first=Ken|date=April 2, 2013|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2013/04/01/album-review-lil-wayne-not-human-being/q7JSnbTDS2RPDZT0Sl76CN/story.html|title=Album Review: Lil Wayne, 'I Am Not a Human Being II'|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=April 9, 2013}}</ref>

In a positive review, David Jeffries of [[Allmusic]] said that the album is an "indulgent jumble of a sideline release, but that doesn't mean Wayne isn't in fine form", and observed "stunning talent, true wit, and a [[John Holmes (pornographic actor)|John Holmes]] level of cocksure" from him.<ref name="AllmusicReview"/> ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Steve Jones found it "solid" and "often entertaining in the crass, lewd and rude way that's uniquely Wayne."<ref name="USATodayReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/03/25/lil-wayne-not-a-human-being-2-review/2019473/|title=Lil Wayne is only 'Human,' but an entertaining one|author=Steve Jones|publisher=USA Today|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> [[MSN Music]]'s [[Robert Christgau]] called it "progress" than most of the songs "deploy the P-word" sexually rather than pejoratively and felt that it suggests that, "unlike most rappers and related pop lifeforms who brag about sex, Weezy really seems to savor it ...
