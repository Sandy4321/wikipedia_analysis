'''''Phaeacius''''' is a [[spider]] [[genus (biology)|genus]] of the family Salticidae ([[jumping spider]]s), found in sub-tropical [[China]] and between [[India]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]], including [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sumatra]] and the [[Philippines]]. Although other spiders can jump, salticids including ''Phaeacius'' have significantly better vision than other spiders, and their main eyes are more acute in daylight than a [[cat]]'s and 10 times more acute than a [[dragonfly]]'s. The main eyes focus accurately on an object at distances from approximately {{convert|2|cm|in}} to infinity, and in practice can see up to about {{convert|75|cm|in}}.

While most jumping spiders are active hunters, ''Phaeacius'' is unusually sedentary, generally resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, pieces of wood or any other solid surface, where it is very well [[camouflage]]d. Its preferred prey is [[moth]]s and other [[insect]]s, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive ''Phaeacius'', or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, ''Phaeacius'' lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes ''Phaeacius'' takes a more active approach, especially if without prey for a week or more. ''Phaeacius'' does not enter webs voluntary, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.

The closest relatives of ''Phaeacius'' are in the [[genus]] ''[[Holcolaetis]]'', and the next closest genera are ''[[Portia (spider)|Portia]]'' and ''[[Spartaeus]]''.

Spiders are [[chelicerate]]s, which differ from other arthropods in that the usual body [[segmentation (biology)|segments]] are fused into only two [[Tagma (biology)|tagmata]], the [[cephalothorax]] and [[abdomen]].<ref name="RFB2004CheliGen" /> Jumping spiders have a distinctive rectangular [[carapace]].{{r|Forster1977SaltHunting|page1=51}} All spiders' abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into [[Spinneret (spider)|spinnerets]] that extrude [[spider silk|silk]] from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen. The cephalothorax and abdomen are joined by a small, cylindrical [[Pedicel (spider)|pedicel]], which allows the abdomen to move while spinning [[silk]].{{r|RFB2004Spiders|page1=571<U+2013>574|}} While most jumping spiders do not build webs to catch prey, they use [[spider silk|silk]] for other purposes,<ref name=Hillyard2007Private /> including [[moult]]ing and laying eggs.{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=495}}

The whole body of ''Phaeacius'' is {{convert|7.5|to|11.5|mm|in}} long, and notably flattened, including the [[carapace]],<ref name=BarrionLitsinger1995Riceland /> while the carapaces of some other groups are raised.{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=495}}<ref name=BarrionLitsinger1995Riceland /> The cepholothorax of ''Phaeacius''<U+2032> is relatively long, and the highest point is a little behind the last pair of eyes.{{r|Wanless1981RevPhae|page1=204, 206-208}} ''Phaeacius'' is very well [[camouflage]]d;<ref name=BarrionLitsinger1995Riceland /> for example, ''P. malayensis'' has a body with dull grey and brown markings that resemble the surface of tree trunks in the rainforest.<ref name=Li2000PreyPref /><ref name=Jackson1990PhaeBehav />

Jumping spiders generally have large forelegs and short, powerful back legs,<ref name=Hogue1993LaAm /> and can leap up to 50&nbsp;times their own length by powerfully extending the third or fourth pairs of legs.{{r|RFB2004Spiders|page1=578}}{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=495}} In spiders and other [[chelicerate]]s, there is only one pair of [[appendage]]s before the mouth,<ref name=RFB2004CheliGen /> and in spiders these are modified into fangs that inject poison into the prey.<ref name=RFB2004Spiders /> Behind the mouth is a pair of [[pedipalp]]s ("palps" for short),<ref name=RFB2004CheliGen /> and those of male spiders are quite large and are used for displaying and mating.<ref name=RFB2004Spiders />

==Senses==
[[File:Jumping_spider_eyes_layout_2.png|thumb|upright=0.32|Eye pattern of jumping spiders on "squared-off" cephalothorax]]
Jumping spiders have eight eyes, the two large ones in the centre-and-front position (the anterior-median eyes, also called "principal eyes"{{r|Forster1977SaltHunting|page1=51}}) providing acute vision and housed in tubes in the head. The other six are secondary eyes, positioned along the sides of the carapace and acting mainly as movement detectors.<ref name=HarlandJackson2000Cats />{{r|Hill2010Loc|page1=16}} While the middle pair of secondary eyes in most jumping spiders are small, those of ''Phaeacius'' and other members of the sub-family [[Spartaeinae]] are almost as large as the other secondary eyes.<ref name=ZhangLi2005New /> Although other spiders can jump, salticids including ''Phaeacius'' have significantly better vision than other spiders,{{r|JarmanJackson1986Taieria|page1=521}} and their main eyes are more acute in daylight than a [[cat]]'s and 10 times more acute than a [[dragonfly]]'s.<ref name=HarlandJackson2000Cats /> The main eyes focus accurately on an object at distances from approximately {{convert|2|cm|in}} to infinity,{{r|Forster1977SaltHunting|page1=51}} and in practice can see up to about {{convert|75|cm|in}}.{{r|Forster1977SaltHunting|page1=53}}

Spiders, like other [[arthropod]]s, have sensors, often modified [[seta]]e (bristles), protruding through their [[cuticle]] ("skin") for smell, taste, touch and vibration.{{r|RFB2004ArthroSens|page1=532<U+2013>533}} Unlike [[insect]]s, spiders and other chelicerates do not have [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].<ref name="RFB2004CheliGen" /><ref name="RFB2004ArachGen" />

==Movement and being undetected==
While most jumping spiders walk quickly, in a stop-go gait and jumping over obstacles, the movements of ''Phaeacius'' are very unusual. ''Phaeacius'' usually uses a "flattened posture" head-down on a vertical surface, with the body, legs and [[pedipalp|palps]] pressed against the surface, the hindmost legs upwards and the other legs downwards,{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=496<U+2013>497}} and its markings and flattened body make it easily [[crypsis|hidden]] against the bark of a tree trunk. Its habit of walking with its body and legs flattened against a surface helps ''Phaeacius'' to be unobtrusive.<ref name=Jackson1990PhaeBehav />

==Feeding and defence==
While almost all jumping spiders are [[predator]]s, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods,<ref name=HoeflerEtc2006Biocontrol /> ''Phaeacius'' does not use the usual hunting tactics.{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=502}} Most jumping spiders walk through out the day, so that they maximise their chances of a catch,<ref name=Forster1977Feed /> and jump on their prey and then bite it.<ref name=Richman2008Ency /> Unlike most jumping spiders, ''Phaeacius'' and other [[Spartaeinae|spartaeines]] do not leap on prey, but lunge from about half the predator's body length away.<ref name=Jackson1990PhaeBehav />

''Phaeacius'' is unusually sedentary for a jumping spider, generally resting in the flattened pose for hours or days on logs, pieces of wood or any other solid surface,{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=502}} and captures particular types of prey more often when the predator matches this background.<ref name=Li2000PreyPref /> Insects can usually move around an inactive ''Phaeacius'', or even over its body or legs. However, if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, ''Phaeacius'' lunges extremely quickly, driving its body upward {{convert|2|to|3|mm|in}} and forward about half the length of its body. The lunge ends with the spider's fangs in the prey and often with the foremost two pairs of legs forming a basket over the prey. When the prey stops struggling, ''Phaeacius'' resumes the flattened pose and then feeds.{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=502}}

However, ''Phaeacius'' can adopt other, more active approaches, with different gaits for each. If an insect remains almost stationary while ''Phaeacius'' is in the flattened pose and facing the insect, the spider may step slowly forward to its prey, rocking and keeping its flattened pose. To rock, ''Phaeacius'' moves about half a body length forward then, without pausing, smoothly back almost to the previous position. It performs about 10&nbsp;cycles of those movements, progressing by {{convert|1|to|2|mm|in}} per cycle, and then rests.{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=502<U+2013>504}} This rocking motion may disguise ''Phaeacius'' as shadows on the tree trunk.{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=514<U+2013>515}} The insect occasionally keeps stationary until ''Phaeacius'' reaches within about half a body length and then lunges.{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=502<U+2013>504}}

When hunting other jumping spiders and when the background matches its coloration,<ref name=NelsonJackson2011Flex /> ''Phaeacius'' uses "insinuation", in which it waits, sometimes up to an hour, while a jumping spider moves around nearby, and then ''Phaeacius'' suddenly turns up to 180<U+00B0> toward the prey and then resumes the flattened pose. ''Phaeacius'' then moves a few millimetres toward the prey and resumes the flattened pose. If the prey moves away, ''Phaeacius'' continues the insinuation manoeuvre, but if the prey moves toward it, ''Phaeacius'' lunges.<ref name=Jackson1990PhaeBehav /> Other jumping spiders show no awareness of a flattened ''Phaeacius'' on a matching background, and apparently survive by luck.{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=502<U+2013>504}} When the background does not matches ''Phaeacius''<U+2032> coloration, other jumping spiders recognise ''Phaeacius'' as a threat.<ref name=Jackson1990PhaeBehav />

Sometimes, especially if without prey for a week or more, ''Phaeacius'' may approach insects faster, from {{convert|50|to|100|mm|in}} away, and if necessary turning round to face the prey. Often ''Phaeacius'' then adopts the flattened pose after the turn, but sometimes it walks faster than usual and, without pausing, lunges from about half its body length. {{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=502<U+2013>504}}

In a test on a background matching its own coloration, ''Phaeacius'' was most successful against other salticids and then against moths, and was also successful against flies and hunting spiders. On a non-matching background, ''Phaeacius'' was most successful against moths.<ref name=Jackson1990PhaeBehav />

''Phaeacius'' does not try to eat other spiders' eggs, does not enter webs voluntarily, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=502}} This behaviour is quite different from that of its close relative, ''[[Portia (spider)|Portia]]'', which hunts actively and can enter any type of web to catch spiders and their eggs.<ref name=HarlandJackson2000Cats />{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=491}}

When disturbed, some jumping spiders<!-- Cyrba, Brettus --> usually run away quickly and leap if chased. ''Phaeacius'' stays in its flattened posture unless harassed, when it runs quickly for about {{convert|100|to|300|mm|in}} and then adopts the flattened posture, and finally walks away about 10&nbsp;minutes later.{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=499<U+2013>500}}

==Reproduction==
Before [[courtship]], male spiders spin a small web and [[ejaculate]] on to it, and then store the [[semen]] in reservoirs on his [[pedipalp]]s,{{r|RFB2004Spiders|page1=581<U+2013>583}} which are larger than those of females.{{r|RFB2004Spiders|page1=572<U+2013>573}} ''Phaeacius'' spins a flimsy [[spider silk|silken]], horizontal or vertical platform, about twice the spider's length in diameter, to [[moult]] and lay eggs, but not at other times. After the moult, ''Phaeacius'' leaves the discarded [[exuvia]] hanging from the platform.<ref name=Jackson1990PhaeBehav /> A female's egg sac is placed in a shallow cavity on the surface of a log.{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=495}}

==Taxonomy and distribution==
''Phaeacius'' is a spider [[genus]] of the Salticidae family ([[jumping spider]]s). ''Phaeacius'' is in the subfamily [[Spartaeinae]],<ref name=BarrionLitsinger1995Riceland /> which is thought to be [[Primitive (phylogenetics) | primitive]].{{r|JacksonHallas1986SpartVersa|page1=491}} [[Molecular phylogeny]], a technique that compares the [[DNA]] of organisms to reconstruct the [[Tree_of_life#Science | tree of life]], indicates that ''Phaeacius'' is a member of the [[clade]] Spartaeinae, that Spartaeinae is basal (quite similar to the ancestors of all jumping spiders), and that ''Phaeacius''<U+2032>s closest relative is the genus ''[[Holcolaetis]]'', and that the next closest are ''[[Portia (spider) | Portia]]'' and ''[[Spartaeus]]''.{{r|MaddisonEtc2008SaltPhylRev|page1=53}}

The genus is found in sub-tropical China<ref name=ZhangLi2005New /> and between India and [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]],<ref name=BarrionLitsinger1995Riceland /> including [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sumatra]] and the [[Philippines]].<ref name=Wijesinghe1991SriSumPhi /> The genus was first described by [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Simon]] in 1900, and includes 12 formally described species {{as of|May 2011|lc=y}} <U+2013> ''P. alabangensis'', ''P. biramosus'', ''P. canalis '', ''P. fimbriatus'', ''P. lancearius'', ''P. leytensis'', ''P. mainitensis'', ''P. malayensis '', ''P. saxicola'', ''P. wanlessi '', ''P. yixin'' and ''P. yunnanensis''.<ref name=PlatnickEtcCatalPhaeac /><!-- Also ''P. arzakinae'' - http://arthropodaselecta.britishspiders.org.uk/articles/19_3_153_188_Proszynski.pdf - See whether it's confirmed. --> The type species is ''P. fimbriatus''.{{r|Wanless1981RevPhae|page1=199}}
