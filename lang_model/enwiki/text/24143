'''Minnesota''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[<U+02CC>m<U+026A>n<U+0259><U+02C8>so<U+028A>t<U+0259>]}}) ({{audio|en-us-Minnesota.ogg|Audio (US)}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Midwestern United States|''Midwestern'']] region of the [[United States]]. It is the 12<sup>th</sup> largest state in the U.S., and the 21<sup>st</sup> most populous, with over five million residents. Minnesota was carved out of the eastern half of the [[Minnesota Territory]] and admitted to the Union as the 32<sup>nd</sup> state in 1858.  While the state's residents have been primarily [[caucasian race|white]], [[Northern European]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], substantial influxes of [[African]], [[Asian]], and [[Hispanic]] immigrants have joined the descendants of [[Europe|European]] immigrants and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] descendants of its original inhabitants.

Nearly three out of five Minnesota residents live in the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]] [[metropolitan area]], which is the center of transportation, business, and industry, and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state, often referred to as [[Greater Minnesota]], consists of western [[prairie]]s now given over to intensive agriculture; eastern [[Deciduous|deciduous forests]], also heavily farmed and settled; and the less-populated northern [[Taiga|boreal forest]].  The state is known as the "Land of 10,000 Lakes", and those lakes and the other waters for which the state is named, together with state and national forests and parks, offer residents and tourists a vigorous outdoor lifestyle.

The extremes of the climate contrast with the moderation of Minnesota<U+2019>s people.  The state is known for its moderate-to-progressive politics and social policies, its civic involvement, and high voter turnout.  It ranks among the healthiest states by a number of measures, and has one of the most highly educated and literate populations.

==Origin of the name==
The word ''Minnesota'' comes from the [[Sioux language|Dakota]] name for the [[Minnesota River]], ''mnisota''. ''Mni'' (sometimes ''mini'', or ''minne'') can be translated as "water". ''Mnisota'' is then translated as ''sky-tinted water'' or ''somewhat clouded water''.<ref name = mnhs-name>{{cite web | title = Minnesota State  | publisher = Minnesota Historical Society  | url = http://mnplaces.mnhs.org/upham/otheritem.cfm?PlaceNameID=2007&BookCodeID=67&County=0&SendingPage=Results.cfm | accessdate = 2006-06-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Minnesota definition | publisher = Dictionary.com | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Minnesota | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref> Native Americans demonstrated the name to early settlers by dropping milk into water and calling it ''mnisota''.<ref name = mnhs-name /> The names of many locations in the state contain the Dakota word for water, such as [[Minnehaha Falls]] ("waterfall", not "laughing waters" as is commonly thought), [[Minneiska, Minnesota|Minneiska]] ("white water"), [[Lake Minnetonka|Minnetonka]] ("big water"), [[Minnetrista]] ("crooked water"), and [[Minneapolis]], which is a combination of ''mni'' and ''polis'', the Greek word for "city".<ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:National-atlas-minnesota.png|thumb|right|Minnesota, showing roads and major bodies of water]]
Minnesota is the northernmost state except for [[Alaska]]; its [[Northwest Angle]] is the only part of the 48 [[Continental United States|contiguous states]] lying north of the [[49th parallel north|49<sup>th</sup> Parallel]]. Minnesota is in the U.S. region known as the ''[[Upper Midwest]]''. The state shares a [[Lake Superior]] water border with [[Michigan]] on the northeast; the remainder of the eastern border is with [[Wisconsin]]. [[Iowa]] is to the south, [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]] are west, and the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[province]]s of [[Ontario]] and [[Manitoba]] are north. With 87,014&nbsp;square miles (225,365&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), or approximately 2.25% of the United States,<ref>

These seas began the flattening of Minnesota which continued with glaciation beginning 600,000 years ago. Massive glaciers at least one [[kilometer]] thick ravaged the landscape of Minnesota and created its current terrain.<ref name = MNGeog /> The last of four major glaciations, the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], left Minnesota 12,000 years ago.<ref name = MNGeog /> The extent of these glaciers reached all of Minnesota except the far southeast and southwest.

The glaciers left their remains across the entire state as they retreated, with most areas having 50&nbsp;feet (15&nbsp;m) or more of [[glacial till]]. As the last glaciers retreated, gigantic [[Lake Agassiz]] formed in the northwest; the lake's outflow carved the valley of the [[Minnesota River]], and its bottom created the fertile lands of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] valley.<ref name = MNGeog /> Minnesota is geologically quiet today; it experiences [[earthquake]]s infrequently, and most of them are minor. The strongest earthquake in the last century occurred near [[Morris, Minnesota|Morris]] in 1975, and rated between 4.6 and 4.8 in [[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude]] on the Richter scale.<ref>{{cite web | title = Table Showing Minnesota Earthquakes | publisher = University of Minnesota, Morris | date = http://www.mrs.umn.edu/earthquakes/MNeqchart.html | accessdate = 2006-11-26 }}</ref>
 
[[Image:Lake Superior North Shore.jpg|thumb|right|Cliffs on the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]] of [[Lake Superior]].]] 
The state's high point is [[Eagle Mountain (Minnesota)|Eagle Mountain]] at 2,301&nbsp;ft (701&nbsp;m), which is only 13 miles away from the low of 602&nbsp;ft (183&nbsp;m) at the shore of [[Lake Superior]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Minnesota Map Collection - State, City, Road, County, River, Lake | publisher = geology.com | url = http://geology.com/state-map/minnesota.shtml#Elevation-Map | accessdate = 2006-11-26 }}</ref><ref name="Compass"/> These elevation differences, however, do not suggest the gently rolling hills and [[peneplain]] seen across the state. 

Two [[continental divide]]s meet in the northeastern part of Minnesota, forming three [[watershed]]s.

==History==
{{main|History of Minnesota}}
[[Image:Minnesotaterritory.PNG|thumb|left|Map of [[Minnesota Territory]] 1849&ndash;1858]]
Before European settlement, Minnesota was populated by the [[Anishinaabe]], the [[Sioux]], and other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The first [[Europe|European]]s were [[French people|French]] [[fur trade]]rs who arrived in the 1600s. Late in the century, the [[Ojibwe]] Indians migrated westward to Minnesota, causing tensions with the Sioux.<ref name="timepieces">{{cite web | title = TimePieces | url = http://events.mnhs.org/TimePieces/timeline.cfm | publisher = Minnesota Historical Society | accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref>  Explorers such as [[Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut]], Father [[Louis Hennepin]], [[Jonathan Carver]], [[Henry Schoolcraft]], and [[Joseph Nicollet]], among others, mapped out the state.

In 1805, [[Zebulon Pike]] acquired land at the [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] of the [[Minnesota River|Minnesota]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers. The construction of [[Fort Snelling]] followed, between 1819 and 1825.<ref name="Gilman">{{cite book | title = The Story of Minnesota's Past | last = Gilman | first = Rhoda R. | publisher = Minnesota Historical Society Press | location = St. Paul, Minnesota | date = 1991-7-01 | id = ISBN 0-8735-1267-7  }}</ref>  

The soldiers built a [[grist mill]] and a [[sawmill]] at [[Saint Anthony Falls]], and as industry later sprung up around the falls, the city of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] grew up around it.  Meanwhile, squatters, government officials, and tourists had settled in the vicinity of the fort. In 1839, the Army forced them to move downriver, and they settled in the area that became [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]].<ref name="hfs">{{cite web | url = http://www.mnhs.org/places/sites/hfs/history.html | title = Historic Fort Snelling | publisher = Minnesota Historical Society Press | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref>  [[Minnesota Territory]] was formed on [[March 3]], [[1849]].  By 1858, thousands of people had come to build [[farm]]s and cut [[timber]], and Minnesota became the [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|32nd U.S. state]] on [[May 11]], [[1858]].

Treaties between whites and the Sioux and Ojibwe gradually forced the natives off their lands and onto smaller reservations.  As conditions deteriorated for the Sioux, tensions rose, leading to the [[Sioux Uprising]] of 1862.  The result of the six-week war was the execution of 38 Indians<U+2014>the largest mass execution in United States history<U+2014>and the exile of most of the rest of the Sioux to the [[Crow Creek Reservation]] in [[Nebraska]].<ref name="Lass">{{cite book | last = Lass | first = William E. | title = Minnesota: A History | edition = 2nd | publisher = W.W.

[[Image:Fort Snelling Round Tower.JPG|thumb|right|[[Fort Snelling]] played a pivotal role in Minnesota's history and in the development of the cities of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]].]]

Logging and farming were mainstays of Minnesota's early economy. The sawmills at Saint Anthony Falls, and logging centers like [[Marine on St. Croix, Minnesota|Marine on St. Croix]], [[Stillwater, Minnesota|Stillwater]], and [[Winona, Minnesota|Winona]], processed high volumes of lumber.  These cities were situated on rivers that were ideal for transportation.<ref name="Lass"/>  Later, Saint Anthony Falls was tapped to provide power for [[gristmill|flour mills]].  Innovations by Minneapolis millers led to the production of Minnesota "patent" flour, widely regarded as the finest bread flour of its time.  By 1900, Minnesota mills, led by [[Pillsbury Bakery|Pillsbury]] and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of [[General Mills]]), were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Danbom, David B. | year = 2003 | month = Spring | title = Flour Power: The Significance of Flour Milling at the Falls | journal = [http://shop.mnhs.org/moreinfo.cfm?Product_ID=66&bhcp=1 Minnesota History] | volume = 58 | issue = 5 | pages = 271-285 | accessdate = }}</ref>

The state's [[iron]]-mining industry was established with the discovery of iron in the [[Vermilion Range (Minnesota)|Vermilion Range]] and the [[Mesabi Range]] in the 1880s, then in the [[Cuyuna Range]] in the early 1900s.  The iron was shipped by rail to [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]] and [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], then loaded onto ships and transported eastward over the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name="Lass"/>

Industrial development and the rise of manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 1900s.  Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent throughout the state.  During the [[Great Depression]], Minnesota's economy was hard-hit, resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among iron miners, and labor unrest.  Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by [[drought]] from 1931 to 1935.  [[New Deal]] programs provided some economic turnaround.  The [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and other programs around the state established jobs for Indians on their reservations.  The [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934 provided a mechanism of self-government for the Indian tribes.  This provided natives a greater voice within the state, and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and native languages were no longer suppressed.<ref name="Gilman"/>

After [[World War II]], industrial development quickened.  New technology increased productivity on farms, through automation of [[feedlot]]s for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings.  Planting became more specialized with [[hybrid|hybridization]] of corn and wheat, and the use of farm machinery such as [[tractor]]s and [[Combine harvester|combines]] became the norm.  University of Minnesota professor [[Norman Borlaug]] contributed to these developments as part of the [[Green Revolution]].<ref name="Gilman"/>  During this time, [[suburb|suburban]] development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.<ref name="Gilman"/>

Minnesota became a center of technology after the war.  [[Engineering Research Associates]] was formed in 1946 to develop computers for the [[United States Navy]].  It later merged with [[Remington Rand]], and then became [[Sperry Rand]].  [[William Norris]] left Sperry in 1957 to form [[Control Data Corporation]] (CDC).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hagley.lib.de.us/2015.htm | title = Engineering Research Associates Records 1946-1959 | publisher = Hagley Museum and Library | accessdate = 2006-11-26}}</ref>  [[Cray|Cray Research]] was formed when [[Seymour Cray]] left CDC to form his own company.  Medical device maker [[Medtronic]] also started business in the Twin Cities in 1949.

Fourteen percent of respondents answered "no religion" on the survey, and 6% refused to answer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm | title=American Religious Identification Survey | work=Exhibit 15 | publisher = The Graduate Center, City University of New York | accessdate = 2006-11-24}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Minnesota}}
[[Image:Phelpsmill ottertailcounty.jpg|thumb|right|Phelps Mill in Otter Tail County]]
Once primarily a producer of raw materials, Minnesota's economy has transformed in the last 200 years to emphasize finished products and services.  Perhaps the most significant characteristic of the economy is its diversity; the relative outputs of its business sectors closely match the United States as a whole.<ref>{{cite web | title = Environmental Information Report, App. D Socioeconomic Information | date = 2003-05-30

===Industry and commerce===
[[Image:IDS reflecting Wells Fargo.jpg|left|thumb|The [[IDS Tower]], designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and Minnesota's tallest building, reflecting [[C<U+00E9>sar Pelli|C<U+00E9>sar Pelli's]] [[Art Deco]]-style [[Wells Fargo Center (Minneapolis)|Wells Fargo Center]].]] Minnesota's earliest industries were fur trading and agriculture; the city of Minneapolis grew around the [[gristmill|flour mills]] clumped around [[St. Anthony Falls]].  Agriculture is still a major part of the economy, even though less than 1% of the population are employed in the farming industry.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=04000US27&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_DP3&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-_lang=en&-_sse=on | title=Minnesota - DP-3.

Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore iron mines, which produced a significant portion of the world's [[iron ore]] for over a century.  Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, [[taconite]] mining remains viable, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004, the state produced 75% of the country's usable iron ore.<ref name=resources /> The mining boom created the port of [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], and it continues to be an important shipping port for ore, coal, and agricultural products. The manufacturing sector now includes technology and [[biomedical]] firms, in addition to the older food processors and heavy industry.  The nation's first indoor [[shopping mall]] was [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina's]] [[Southdale Center]] and its largest, the [[Mall of America]], is located in [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]].

===Energy use and production===
The state produces [[ethanol fuel]], and a 10% mix of ethanol ([[E10 fuel|E10]]) has been mandated since 1997, making Minnesota the first state with such a mandate.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ethanolproducer.com/article.jsp?article_id=1905 | publisher = Ethanol Producer Magazine | title= Ethanol Producer Magazine|accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref> A 20% ethanol mix (E20) will be mandated in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.minnesotavotes.org/2005-SF-4 |title= 2005 Senate Bill 4 (Ethanol Mandate Increase) | publisher = Minnesota Votes | accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref> Minnesota has nearly 300 gas stations supplying [[E85]] fuel.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.state.mn.us/portal/mn/jsp/content.do?subchannel=-536881511&programid=536907776&sc3=null&sc2=-536888997&id=-536881350&agency=Commerce |title= The complete list of Minnesota E85 fuel Sites | publisher = Minnesota Department of Commerce | accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref>  A 2% [[biodiesel]] blend has also been required in [[diesel fuel]] since 2005. [[Electricity]]-producing [[wind turbine]]s have become popular, particularly in the windy southwest region on the [[Buffalo Ridge]]. As of November 2006, the state is the country's fourth-largest producer of [[wind power]], with 812&nbsp;[[megawatt]]s  installed and another 82&nbsp;megawatts planned.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.awea.org/projects |title= Wind Energy Projects Throughout the United States of America| publisher = [http://www.awea.org/ The American Wind Energy Association] | accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref>

===State taxes===
Minnesota has a slightly [[progressive income tax]] structure; the three brackets of state [[income tax]] rates are 5.35%, 7.05% and 7.85%.<ref>{{cite web | title = Minnesota income tax rates for 2005/2006 | publisher = Minnesota Department of Revenue | url = http://www.taxes.state.mn.us/individ/residency_and_filing_status/filing_requirments_for_individuals/inctxrates.shtml | accessdate = 2006-11-26}}</ref> The [[sales tax]] in Minnesota is 6.5%, but there is no sales tax on [[clothing]], [[prescription]] [[medications]], some [[service]]s, or [[food]] items for home consumption.<ref>{{cite web | title = Sales tax fact sheets | publisher = Minnesota Department of Revenue | url = http://taxes.state.mn.us/taxes/sales/publications/fact_sheets_by_name/sales_fact_sheet_by_name.shtml | accessdate = 2006-11-26 }}</ref> The [[Minnesota Legislature|state legislature]] may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5% supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://taxes.state.mn.us/taxes/sales/publications/fact_sheets_by_name/content/BAT_1100111.pdf|title= Local Sales Tax and Use|accessdate=2006-11-26 |format= PDF}}</ref> The cities of St. Paul, Rochester, Duluth and St. Cloud have similar taxes. [[Excise|Excise taxes]] are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel.  The state imposes a [[use tax]] on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of [[real property]] in Minnesota pay [[property tax]] to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.

==Culture==
===Fine and performing arts===
[[Image:Mpls arts.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]] north facade, designed by [[McKim, Mead, and White]].]] The Twin Cities area is considered the artistic capital of the ''Upper Midwest''. Its major [[fine art]] museums include the [[Weisman Art Museum]], the [[Walker Art Center]], and the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]]. The [[Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra]] and the [[Minnesota Orchestra]] are full-time professional [[musical ensemble]]s that perform concerts and offer educational programs to the community.  Attendance at [[theatre|theatrical]], [[music]]al, and [[comedy]] events in the area is strong, which may be attributed to the cold winters, the large population of post-secondary students, and a generally vibrant economy. The [[Guthrie Theater]] moved into a new building in 2006, boasting three stages and overlooking the Mississippi River. In the U.S., the Twin Cities' number of theater seats per capita ranks behind only [[New York City]]; in 2000, 2.3&nbsp;million theater tickets were sold.<ref>{{cite web| title=Gopher Express|work=Coffman Info Desk|publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota|date=2006-10-12| url=http://www.skyway.umn.edu/gopherexpresswest/explore.php?PHPSESSID=f65d1b639e4cae622e89d4f98605c590| accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref>  The Minneapolis [[Fringe theatre|Fringe Festival]] is an annual celebration of [[theatre]], [[dance]], [[improvisation]], [[puppetry]], kids' shows, [[visual art]], and musicals. The summer festival consists of over 800 performances in 11&nbsp;days, and is the largest non-juried performing arts festival in the United States.<ref>{{cite web| title = How to fringe| work = Fresh Art Delivered Daily| publisher = Minnesota Fringe Festival| date = 2006 | url = http://www.fringefestival.org/new.cfm| accessdate = 2006-11-22}}</ref>

===Literature===
The rigors and rewards of pioneer life on the [[prairie]] were the subject of ''Giants in the Earth'' by [[Ole Rolvaag]] and of the [[Little House|''Little House'']] series of children's books by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]]. Small-town life was savaged by [[Sinclair Lewis]] in the novel  [[Main Street (novel)|''Main Street'']], and more gently and affectionately satirized by [[Garrison Keillor]] in his tales of [[Lake Wobegon]]. St. Paul native [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] wrote of the the social insecurities and aspirations of the young city in stories such as ''[[Winter Dreams]]'' and ''The Ice Palace'' (published in ''[[Flappers and Philosophers]]'').

===Entertainment===
[[Image:First Avenue nightclub.jpg|thumb|left|[[First Avenue]] nightclub, the heart of Minnesota's music community.<ref name=Compass>Page 190</ref>]]
{{main|Music of Minnesota}}
Minnesotan musicians of many genres have been popular over the years, including harmony singers [[The Andrews Sisters]], folk musician [[Bob Dylan]], pop songwriters [[Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis]], rock star [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Semisonic]], an alternative rock group. Minnesota has also produced the cult favorites [[H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>]], [[The Replacements]], and [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]].<ref name=Compass>Page 190</ref>
 
Minnesota and Wisconsin have contributed significantly to comedy in its different forms.  [[Ole and Lena]] jokes can't be fully appreciated unless delivered in the accent of [[Scandinavia]]n Americans. [[Garrison Keillor]] is known around the country for resurrecting the old-style [[radio comedy]] with ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'', which has aired since the 1970s.<ref name=Compass>Page 21</ref>  Local [[television]] had the [[satire|satirical]] show ''The Bedtime Nooz'' in the 1960s, while area natives [[Lizz Winstead]] and [[Craig Kilborn]] helped create the increasingly influential ''[[The Daily Show|Daily Show]]'' decades later. [[Joel and Ethan Coen]] have produced many [[film]]s featuring [[dark comedy]], and others brought the offbeat [[cult television|cult shows]] ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' and ''[[Let's Bowl]]'' to national [[cable television|cable]] from the Twin Cities.

===Popular culture===
[[Image:MNfiddles.jpg|thumb|right|A youth [[fiddle]] performance at the [[Minnesota State Fair]].]] [[Stereotype|Stereotypical]] Minnesotan traits include manners known as [[Minnesota nice|"Minnesota nice"]], [[Lutheranism]], a strong sense of community and shared culture, and a distinctive [[American English regional differences#Midwest|''Upper Midwestern'' accent]] sprinkled with Scandinavian-sounding words such as ''[[uff da]]''. [[Potluck]]s, usually with a variety of [[hotdish]] casseroles, are popular at community functions, especially church activities. Minnesota's Norwegian and Scandinavian heritage makes [[lutefisk]] a traditional holiday dish. The [[radio show]] ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' and the book ''[[How to Talk Minnesotan]]'' lampoon Minnesotan culture, speech and mannerisms. 

The [[Minnesota State Fair]], advertised as ''The Great Minnesota Get-Together'', is an icon of state culture. In a state of 5.1 million people, there were nearly 1.7 million visitors to the fair in 2006.<ref>{{cite web| title=Minnesota State Fair| publisher = Minnesota State Fair|url = http://www.mnstatefair.org/| accessdate = 2006-11-22}}</ref>  Although the fair covers a wide swath of culture, including [[fine art]], [[science]], [[agriculture]], food preparation, [[4H]] displays, music, [[midway (fair)|the midway]], and corporate merchandising, it is known for its displays of [[seed art]], [[butter]] sculptures of [[Princess Kay of the Milky Way|dairy princesses]], the birthing barn, and dozens of varieties of food on a stick (such as [[Hot Dog on a Stick]]).  On a smaller scale, these same attractions are offered at Minnesota's numerous county fairs.

Other large annual festivals include the [[Saint Paul Winter Carnival]], Minneapolis' [[Aquatennial]] and Mill City Music Festival, and [[Detroit Lakes, Minnesota|Detroit Lakes']] 10,000 Lakes Music Festival and WE Fest.

[[Image:Duluth canal.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Aerial Lift Bridge]] at [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]]]
Transportation in Minnesota is overseen by the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]].  Principal transportation corridors radiate from the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] metropolitan area and Duluth.   The major [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]] are [[Interstate 35|I-35]], [[Interstate 90|I-90]], and [[Interstate 94|I-94]], with I-35 and I-94 passing through the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, and I-90 going east-west along the southern edge of the state.  In 2006, a [[constitutional amendment]] was passed that required sales and use taxes on motor vehicles to fund transportation, with at least 40% dedicated to [[public transit]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Transportation amendment update| publisher = Minnesota Department of Transportation| date = 2006| url = http://www.dot.state.mn.us/information/mvst/index.html| accessdate = 2006-11-24}}</ref> There are nearly two dozen [[rail transport|rail]] corridors in Minnesota, most of which go through Minneapolis-St. Paul or Duluth. There is water transportation along the [[Mississippi River]] system and from the ports of [[Lake Superior]].

[[Image:Hiawatha LRV.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Hiawatha Line]] vehicle in Minneapolis]]
Minnesota's principal airport is [[Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport]] (MSP), the headquarters and major passenger and freight hub for [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[Sun Country Airlines]]. The airport is served by most other domestic carriers. Large commercial jet service is provided at Duluth and Rochester, with scheduled commuter service to six smaller cities via [[Eagan, Minnesota|Eagan]]-based [[Mesaba Airlines]].

==Law and government==
As with the federal government of the United States, power in Minnesota is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.<ref>{{cite web | title = Minnesota Government | url = http://www.state.mn.us/portal/mn/jsp/content.do?id=-8494&agency=NorthStar | accessdate =  2006-10-20 }} </ref>

===Executive===
The executive branch is headed by the [[Governor of Minnesota|governor]]. The current Governor is [[Tim Pawlenty]], a [[Republican Party of Minnesota|Republican]] whose first term began [[6 January]], [[2003]], and who was narrowly re-elected in 2006. The current [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Minnesota|Lieutenant Governor]] of Minnesota is [[Carol Molnau]], who is also the head of the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]]. The offices of governor and lieutenant governor have four-year terms. The governor has a [[cabinet]] consisting of the leaders of various state government agencies, called commissioners. The other constitutional offices are [[List of secretaries of state of Minnesota|secretary of state]], [[Minnesota Attorney General|attorney general]] and [[Minnesota State Auditor|state auditor]].

===Legislative===
The [[Minnesota Legislature]] is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of the [[Minnesota Senate|Senate]] and the [[Minnesota House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The state has 67 districts, each covering about 60,000 people. Each district has one senator and two representatives (each district being divided into ''A'' and ''B'' sections). Senators serve for four years and representatives for two years. In the November 2006 election, the [[Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] (DFL) gained 19 house seats, giving them control of the House of Representatives by 85<U+2013>49. The Senate is also controlled by the DFL, who in 2006 gained 6 seats to expand their majority to 44<U+2013>23.

===Judicial===
Minnesota's court system has three levels. Most cases start in the [[district court]]s, which are courts of general jurisdiction.  There are 272 district court judges in ten judicial districts.  Appeals from the trial courts and challenges to certain governmental decisions are heard by the Minnesota [[Court of Appeals]], consisting of sixteen judges who typically sit in three-judge panels. The seven-justice [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] hears all appeals from the Tax Court, the Worker's Compensation Court, first-degree murder convictions, and [[Certiorari#State courts|discretionary appeals]] from the Court of Appeals; it also has [[original jurisdiction]] over election disputes.<ref>{{cite web | title = Explanation of Minnesota court system | url = http://www.courts.state.mn.us/documents/CIO/otherResources/SupremeCourt.doc | accessdate =  2006-10-19 }} </ref>

Two specialized courts within administrative agencies have been established: the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals, and the Tax Court, which deals with non-criminal tax cases.

===Regional===
Below the city and county levels of government found in the United States, Minnesota has other entities that provide governmental oversight and planning. Some actions in the Twin Cities metropolitan area are coordinated by the [[Metropolitan Council]], and many lakes and rivers are overseen by [[watershed district]]s and [[soil and water conservation district]]s.

There are seven [[Anishinaabe]] reservations and four [[Santee Sioux|Dakota]] communities in Minnesota. These communities are self-governing.<ref>{{cite web | title = Tribal Government | publisher = Minnesota North Star | url = http://www.state.mn.us/portal/mn/jsp/content.do?subchannel=-536888182&id=-8494&agency=NorthStar | accessdate = 2006-10-20 }} </ref>

===Federal===
Minnesota's two [[United States senator]]s are [[Norm Coleman]] and [[Mark Dayton]].  The state has eight [[Minnesota Congressional Districts|congressional districts]]; they are represented by [[Gil Gutknecht]] ([[Minnesota's 1st congressional district|1st district]]), [[John Kline]] ([[Minnesota's 2nd congressional district|2nd]]), [[Jim Ramstad]] ([[Minnesota's 3rd congressional district|3rd]]), [[Betty McCollum]] ([[Minnesota's 4th congressional district|4th]]), [[Martin Sabo]] ([[Minnesota's 5th congressional district|5th]]), [[Mark Kennedy]] ([[Minnesota's 6th congressional district|6th]]), [[Collin Peterson]] ([[Minnesota's 7th congressional district|7th]]), and [[James Oberstar]] ([[Minnesota's 8th congressional district|8th]]). 

Federal court cases are heard in the [[United States District Court for the District of Minnesota]], which holds court in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth, and [[Fergus Falls]]. Appeals are heard by the [[Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals]] based in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and St. Paul.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Minnesota}}[[Image:H Humphrey.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hubert Humphrey]]]]
Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and [[populism]] has been a longstanding force among the state's [[political party|political parties]].  Minnesota has a consistently high [[voter turnout]], due in part to its liberal [[voter registration]] laws. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]], 77.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted<U+2014>the most of any U.S. state<U+2014>versus the national average of 60.93%.<ref>{{cite web | title = United States Elections Project | url = http://elections.gmu.edu/Voter_Turnout_2004.htm | accessdate = 2006-06-22 }}</ref> Previously unregistered voters can register on [[Election Day (United States)|election day]] at their [[Polling place|polls]] with evidence of residency. 

[[Hubert Humphrey]] brought national attention to the state following his address at the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]]. [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s anti-war stance and popularity prior to the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] likely convinced [[Lyndon Johnson]] to drop out of the [[United States presidential election, 1968|presidential race]].  Minnesotans have voted for Democratic presidential candidates consistently since 1976, longer than any other state. In the [[108th United States Congress|108<sup>th</sup>]] and [[109th United States Congress|109<sup>th</sup>]] Congresses, however, Minnesota's congressional delegation was split, with four Democratic and four Republican members of Congress. The state's senate seats have generally also been split since the early 1990s.  See [[United States Congressional Delegations from Minnesota]].

In the 2006 mid-term election, Democrats were elected to all state offices except for governor and lieutenant governor, where Republicans Tim Pawlenty and Carol Molnau narrowly won re-election.  The DFL also posted double-digit gains in both houses of the legislature, elected DFL member [[Amy Klobuchar]] to the U.S. Senate, and increased the Democratic U.S. House caucus by one.

The state has had active third party movements. The [[Reform Party of the United States|Reform Party]] was able to elect the former mayor of [[Brooklyn Park, Minnesota|Brooklyn Park]] and [[professional wrestler]], [[Jesse Ventura]], to the [[Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1998|governorship in 1998]]. The state's [[Green Party of Minnesota|Green Party]] has elected city council members and other local office-holders in Duluth, Minneapolis and Winona, and has made strong runs for state legislature in the past two elections. In 2000, Green Party candidate [[Ralph Nader]] received just over 5% of the presidential votes cast, gaining major party status for the Green Party of Minnesota.  The [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]] has also received sufficient support to earn major party status.

The Twin Cities metro area has the state's two largest newspapers: the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' in Minneapolis and the ''[[Saint Paul Pioneer Press]]''. Other weekly and monthly publications (most of which are fully supported by [[advertising]]) are also available.  The most prominent of these is the [[alternative weekly]] ''[[City Pages]]'', with competitor ''[[The Rake]]'' offering a free monthly.

Two of the largest [[public radio]] networks,  [[Minnesota Public Radio]] (MPR) and [[Public Radio International]] (PRI), are based in the state. MPR has the largest audience of any regional public radio network in the nation, broadcasting on 37 radio stations, while PRI provides more than 400 hours of programming each week to affiliates across the nation.<ref>{{cite web | title = PRI factsheet | url = http://www.pri.org/InPRI_FactSheet.html | accessdate =  2006-08-17 }} </ref><ref>{{cite web | title = About MPR | publisher = Minnesota Public Radio | url = http://minnesota.publicradio.org/about/mpr/ | accessdate =  2006-08-17 }} </ref>

[[Minor league baseball]] is represented both by major league-sponsored teams and independent teams such as the popular [[St. Paul Saints]].

Professional women's sports include the [[Minnesota Lynx]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association]], the [[Minnesota Vixen]] of the [[Women's Professional Football League]], and the [[Minnesota Whitecaps]] of the [[National Women's Hockey League]]. 

The [[United States Hockey Hall of Fame|U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame]] is located in [[Eveleth, Minnesota|Eveleth]], on the Iron Range.  The United States won the [[Winter Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[gold medal]] for [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|ice hockey in 1980]], coached by Minnesota native [[Herb Brooks]].

===Outdoor recreation===
[[Image:Lake Calhoun MN.jpg|thumb|right|Fishing in [[Lake Calhoun]] in Minneapolis.]]
Minnesotans participate in high levels of physical activity,<ref>{{cite web | title = Statemaster Health Statistics Physical Exercise by State | publisher = Statemaster | date = 2002 | url = http://www.statemaster.com/graph/hea_phy_exe-health-physical-exercise | accessdate = 2006-08-16}}</ref> and many of these activites are outdoors.  The strong interest of Minnesotans in [[environmentalism]] has been attributed to the popularity of these pursuits.<ref>{{cite web | title = Green Hunters: Minnesota DNR | publisher = Fish & Wildlife Today | url = http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fwt/back_issues/september97/message.html | accessdate = 2006-10-25 }}</ref>

In the warmer months these activities often involve water. Weekend and longer trips to family [[cottage|cabin]]s on Minnesota's numerous lakes are a way of life for many residents. Activities include [[water sports]] such as [[water skiing]], which originated in the state,<ref>{{cite web| title = Water Skiing History| work = ABC of Skiing| publisher = MaxLifestyle.net "Go Skiing like Max!" | date = 2006| url = http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/water-skiing/history.asp| accessdate = 2006-11-29}}</ref> [[boating]], [[canoeing]], and [[fishing]]. More than 36% of Minnesotans fish, a statistic second only to Alaska.<ref>{{cite web | title = Managing for Results | publisher = Minnesota DNR | url = http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/aboutdnr/budget/budgetpres0303.pdf | accessdate = 2006-06-26 }}</ref>

Fishing does not cease when the lakes freeze; [[ice fishing]] has been around since the arrival of early [[Scandinavian]] immigrants.  Faced with a long, harsh winter, Minnesotans have learned to embrace it, by [[Ice skating|ice skating]], [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country skiing]], [[Snowshoe|snowshoeing]], and [[Snowmobile|snowmobiling]].

State and national [[forest|forests]] and the [[List of Minnesota state parks|71 state parks]] are used year-round for [[hunting]], [[camping]], and [[hiking]].  There are almost 20,000 miles of snowmobile trails statewide.<ref>{{cite web| title = Snowmobiling Minnesota| publisher = Minnesota Department of Tourism | url =  http://www.exploreminnesota.com/snowmobiling.html| accessdate = 2006-12-02}}</ref>  Minnesota has more miles of [[bike trail|bike trails]] than any other state,<ref>{{cite web| title = Take to the Trails!

==State symbols==
{{main|Lists of U.S. state insignia}}
[[Image:Great_northern_diver.jpg|thumb|right|The Common Loon]]
Minnesota's state symbols represent its history, diverse landscapes, and its people's love of the outdoors. The [[Common Loon]], as state bird, is Minnesota's best-known symbol. Its distinctive cry is heard during the summer months in the northern part of the state, and on occasion the loon can  be found as far south as the lakes of Minneapolis.<ref>{{cite web | title = All About Birds | publisher = Cornell Lab of Ornithology | date = [[2003]] | url = http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Common_Loon_dtl.html | accessdate = 2006-10-24 }}</ref>
