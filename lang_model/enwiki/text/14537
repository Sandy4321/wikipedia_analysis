This differs from other forms of indirect defense in that the fungi live within the plant cells and directly alter their physiology. In contrast, other biotic defenses such as predators or parasites of the herbivores consuming a plant are normally attracted by [[volatile organic compounds]] (known as [[semiochemicals]]) released following damage or by food rewards and shelter produced by the plant.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thaler | first1 = J.S. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1999 | title = Jasmonate-inducible plant defences cause increased parasitism of herbivores | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 399 | issue = 6737| pages = 686<U+2013>688 | doi = 10.1038/21420 }}</ref> These defenders vary in the time spent with the plant: from long enough to oviposit to remaining there for numerous generations, as in the ant-acacia [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Janzen | first1 = D.

== Mechanisms of defense ==
=== Secondary metabolite production ===

Some chemical defenses once thought to be produced by the plant have since been shown to be synthesized by endophytic fungi. The chemical basis of insect resistance in endophyte-plant defense mutualisms has been most extensively studied in the perennial [[ryegrass]] and three major classes of secondary metabolites are found: indole diterpenes, [[Ergot alkaloid|ergot alkaloids]] and peramine.<ref>Betina, V.

=== Altered nutrient content ===

Due to the inherently nutrient-exchange based economy of the plant-endophyte association, it is not surprising that infection by fungi directly alters the chemical composition of plants, with corresponding impacts on their herbivores. Endophytes frequently increase [[Apoplast|apoplastic]] [[carbohydrate]] concentration, altering the C:N ratio of leaves and making them a less efficient source of protein.<ref name="Richardson">Richardson, M.D. (2000).

ISBN 0-8247-8831-1</ref> This effect can be compounded when the fungus also uses plant [[nitrogen]] to form N-based secondary metabolites such as alkaloids. For example, the thistle gall fly (''Urophora cardui'') experiences reduced performance on plants infected with endophytic fungi due to the decrease in N-content  and ability to produce large quantities of high-quality [[Gall|gall tissue]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gange | first1 = A.C. | last2 = Nice | first2 = H.E. | year = 1997 | title = Performance of the thistle gall fly, ''Urophora cardui'', in relation to host plant nitrogen and mycorrhizal colonization | url = | journal = New Phytologist | volume = 137 | issue = 2| pages = 335<U+2013>343 | doi = 10.1046/j.1469-8137.1997.00813.x }}</ref> Additionally, increased availability of limiting nutrients to plants improves overall performance and health, potentially increasing the ability of infected plants to defend themselves.<ref name="Gosling2006">{{cite journal | last1 = Gosling | first1 = P. | last2 = Hodge | first2 = A. | last3 = Goodlass | first3 = G. | last4 = Bending | first4 = G.D. | year = 2006 | title = Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and organic farming | url = | journal = Agric.
