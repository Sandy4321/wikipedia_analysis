(''NOTE: Henceforth in this article '''Swamiji''' will refer to '''Swami Krishn<U+0101>shram''''')

== Taking Charge ==
Swami ''Krishn<U+0101>shram'' was born Param<U+0113>shwar N<U+0101>gar<ref>{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of Cascading Grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=89|publishers=Shri Chitrapur Math Publication|year=2002|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM}}</ref> in the tiny hamlet of Vitthal in Karnataka. He took charge of the affairs of the community after his [[guru]] [[Vamanashram|Swami V<U+0101>man<U+0101>shram]] attained ''Mah<U+0101>-Sam<U+0101>dhi''(passed away) on the 9th day of the month of [[Kartik]] in [[1839]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of Cascading Grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=92|publishers=Shri Chitrapur Math Publication|year=2002|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM}}</ref>. Thus he became the seventh in the ''[[Chitrapur Guru Parampara|Guru Parampara]]''.

He was a learned [[Sanskrit]] scholar<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm|title=H. H. Shrimat Krishnashram Swami (Shirali)|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> who had gained mastery over the scriptures while under his guru. Devotees flocked from different parts of the country to hear the ''<U+0100>shirvachans''(Spiritual Discourses) of Swamiji. He was able to bring around many devotees from their [[Dvaita]] [[Vaishnava]] practises<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm|title=H. H. Shrimat Krishnashram Swami (Shirali)|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>. 

After Swami V<U+0101>man<U+0101>shram gave up the administration of the ''matha'' over to his ''Shukla Bhat'' managers(See [[Vamanashram#Ty<U+0101>ga: The Sacrifice|Relinquishing responsibilities]]), the affairs of the matha were in disarray<ref>{{cite book|title=Guruparampara Charita Saramrita(Devanagari)|year=2002|publishers=Shri Chitrapur Math Publication|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM}}</ref>.The administration of the ''matha'' was taken care of Swamiji who was an able administrator. With the help of his trusted assistant Lajmi Venkatar<U+0101>manayya, the affairs of the ''matha'' were set right<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm|title=H. H. Shrimat Krishnashram Swami (Shirali)|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>. Many reforms regarding the collection of ''Vantiga''(Donations), the allocation of funds for developmental projects etc were introduced<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm|title=H. H. Shrimat Krishnashram Swami (Shirali)|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>.  

== Infrastructural Development ==
Swamiji was keenly interested in establishing temples and [[mathas]] and renovating already existing ones. Under his leadership, the Shri Subramanyeshwar Temple at Nilekani(Sirsi) and the Shri Anant<U+0113>shwar Temple at Vitthal were some of the temples that were renovated<ref>{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of Cascading Grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=96-98|publishers=Shri Chitrapur Math Publication|year=2002|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM}}</ref>.

The Um<U+0101>-Maheshwar Temple at [[Mulki]] was constructed after the residents of that [[panchayat]] requested Swamiji for a temple. Swamiji himself installed the ''Um<U+0101>-Maheshwar'' diety in the temple<ref>{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of Cascading Grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=98|publishers=Shri Chitrapur Math Publication|year=2002|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM}}</ref>.

== Rath<U+014D>tsav("Car Festival") ==
''See [[Chitrapur_Math#Rathotsav|Rathotsav]]''

<big><ref>{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of Cascading Grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=98|publishers=Shri Chitrapur Math Publication|year=2002|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM}}</ref></big>

Under Swamiji's auspices, the Charriot or Car festival known as ''Rath<U+014D>tsav'' was introduced. The first ''Rath<U+014D>tsav'' was introduced in [[1862]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/rathotsava/teru.htm|title=Shirali Teru|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>. In this week-long festival, Lord ''Bhavanishankar'' adorns the ''ratha''(Charriot) which hundreds of devotees pull around the entire village. The ''Math<U+0101>dhipati''(Head of the community or Guru) sits on the ''ratha''. An integral part of the festival is the ''P<U+0101>lki Utsav''([[Palanquin]] festival) where the Lord ''Bhav<U+0101>nishankara'' adorns the ''p<U+0101>lki''(palanquin) and travels a different route every day to "visit" his devotees. Devotees offer their prayers and seek blessings from the Lord on these days. Each day, the Lord takes a different route. The route taken is always marked by glowing lights and crackers to welcome the Lord. 

This festivity is marked by chanting of'[[Vedas|Vedic]] ''mantr<U+0101>s''(hymns) along with ''Bhajans''(devotional songs). ''[[Prasad|Pras<U+0101>d]] bhojan''(food served as [[prasad]]) is served to each and every devotee. This food is prepared by the voluntary work of the devotees, including the cutting and chopping of vegetable to the serving of the food. Any small work done towards the betterment of the festival is considered as ''Seva''([[Selfless Service]]) to Lord ''Bhavanishankara''. The ''Rath<U+014D>tsav'' is the time when the entire community unites to take part in the festivity. 

== Miracles ==
There are famous stories about miracles that Swami Krishn<U+0101>shram has been attributed to. 

=== Un-earthing Um<U+0101>-Maheshwar ===
<big><ref>{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of Cascading Grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=103|publishers=Shri Chitrapur Math Publication|year=2002|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM}}</ref></big>

Once Swamiji had a dream in which the Lord Bhav<U+0101>nishankar guided him to the jungles of Gersappe in [[Shivamogga District|Shim<U+014D>ga]]. There he was shown an idol of ''Um<U+0101>-Maheshwar'' hidden in the deep jungle. Swamiji guided his followers to the place as shown in his dream. At the exact same location as in the dream, an exquisite sculpture of Um<U+0101>-Maheshwar was unearthed.

In the traditional way, this idol was installed near the shrine(''Sam<U+0101>dhi'') of [[Parijnanashram I|<U+0100>di Parij<U+00F1><U+0101>n<U+0101>shram Swamiji]] at the Bhandikeri Math(<U+0100>di Matha) in [[Gokarn]].

=== Fire at Shirali ===
<big><ref>{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of Cascading Grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=98|publishers=Shri Chitrapur Math Publication|year=2002|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM}}</ref></big>

One year during the ''P<U+0101>liki Utsav''(Palanquin festival: ''See [[Chitrapur_Math#Rathotsav|P<U+0101>lki Utsav]]'') in the month of [[Kartik|K<U+0101>rtik]] at [[Shirali]], the people ignored the festival. They did not light lamps nor offer flowers and ''[[Aarti|<U+0100>rtis]]'' to the Lord. They shunned and turned their backs onto Lord ''Bhav<U+0101>nishankara''. 

Swamiji wanted the people to believe that whatever they offer to the Lord was not theirs but belonged to the Lord in the first place. The good life that people enjoyed were because of the grace of the Lord and selfishness and ignorance does not play any role in success. So that night, as if by divine will, a devastating fire swept across Shirali that resulted in wanton destruction. How much ever the people tried, the fire would not extinguish. The people realized their folly and seeked forgiveness at the Swamiji's feet. As if by divine intervention, the fire was extinguished and further losses were prevented.

== Shishya Sweek<U+0101>r ==
The devotees of Swamiji asked him to accept a ''shishya''(Disciple) so as to continue the holy ''[[Chitrapur Guru Parampara|Guru Parampara]]''. Swamiji graciously accepted. So the search was on to find a suitable successor to Swamiji.

The successor was found in '''K<U+0101>lappa Sh<U+0101>ntapayya''', a smart and intelligent boy from [[Mangalore]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of Cascading Grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=104|publishers=Shri Chitrapur Math Publication|year=2002|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM}}</ref>. So on the auspicious ''Shuddha Poornima'' day(15th day) of the month of [[Kartik|K<U+0101>rtik]] in [[1857]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of Cascading Grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=104|publishers=Shri Chitrapur Math Publication|year=2002|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM}}</ref>, Swami Krishn<U+0101>shram ordained his ''shishya'' and named him '''[[Pandurangashram|P<U+0101>ndurang<U+0101>shram]]'''. Thus another link was added to the [[Chitrapur Guru Parampara|Guru Parampara]]. ''P<U+0101>ndurang<U+0101>shram'' would go on to learn under his [[guru]] for a period of 6 years.

== Mah<U+0101>-Sam<U+0101>dhi ==
Swami Krishn<U+0101>shram fell ill in 1863. On the ''Ashtami''(eighth day) of the month of ''M<U+0101>rghash<U+012B>rsha'' that year<ref>{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of Cascading Grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=117|publishers=Shri Chitrapur Math Publication|year=2002|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM}}</ref>, His Holiness Swami Krishn<U+0101>shram attained ''Mah<U+0101>-sam<U+0101>dhi''(passed away). After being at the helm of the community for a dynamic period of 24 years where the community faced a lot of changes, the mortal remains of Swamiji bid adieu to the world. His ''shishya'' ''Pandurang<U+0101>shram'' succeeded him as the next [[guru]] of the community. The ''sam<U+0101>dhi''(Shrine) of Swami Krishn<U+0101>shram is located at the [[Chitrapur Math]] in [[Shirali]] between the ''sam<U+0101>dhis'' of [[Parijnanashram II|Swami Parijnanashram II]] and [[Keshavashram|Swami Keshavashram]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm|title=H.
