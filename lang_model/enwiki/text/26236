== Personal life ==
Daniels is openly [[gay]] <U+2013> he has remarked "Out? I've never been in"<ref name="ES"/> <U+2013> and lives with stage actor Ian Gelder.<ref>A 2004 article about Daniels states that Ian Gelder was aged 55 years and that they had been partners for more than a decade: {{citation|author=Nick Curtis|title=Cutting it on stage|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/article-11498329-details/Cutting+it+on+stage/article.do|publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk, ''[[Evening Standard]]''|date=17 June 2004|accessdate=28 December 2007}}.</ref> They began seeing each other during a production of [[Joe Orton]]'s ''[[Entertaining Mr Sloane]]''. Daniels was already sure of his sexuality in his teens, although he did not discuss the matter with his parents because they did not have a very close emotional relationship. He was "cautious about mentioning it when I left drama school, because [[AIDS|Aids]] was terrifying everyone and there was a huge, [[Homophobia|homophobic]] backlash." He decided to be open about being gay at the age of 24 years, while appearing in an all-star benefit performance of [[Martin Sherman]]'s ''[[Bent]]''. Daniels has said:

{{quote|Homophobia is still shockingly prevalent in film and TV. I know I've lost work because of being gay, and it is always an issue. Even on a serious [[BBC Two|BBC2]] drama there will be some suit in some office going, "Hmmm, isn't he a poof?" I don't consider myself politically gay, but whenever I catch a whiff of that now, I'm on it like a ton of bricks.<ref name="ES"/>}}

In 2007, Daniels was ranked number 79 in the annual Pink List of 100 influential gay and lesbian people in Britain published by ''[[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]'',<ref>{{citation|title=The Pink List 2007: The ''IoS'' annual celebration of the great and the gay|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2516664.ece|newspaper=[[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]|date=6 May 2007}}.</ref> down from number 47 in 2006.<ref>{{citation|author=Marc Shoffman|title=Ian McKellen ranked most influential gay man|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-1863.html|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=3 July 2006|accessdate=28 December 2007}}.</ref>
