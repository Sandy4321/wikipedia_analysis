The '''Mercury Lounge''' is a club/music venue, in the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]] section, of [[New York City]]. The structure, at 217 [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|East Houston Street]], housed the servants to the [[Astor family|Astor]] Mansion, connected to it by an underground [[labyrinth]] of tunnels. Garfein's Restaurant occupied the space in the early part of the twentieth century and from 1933 to 1993 the storefront housed a seller of [[tombstone]]s.

In 1993, it was converted into a music venue. It has a capacity of 250 people.<ref>http://gothamist.com/2007/08/14/new_venue_alert.php</ref>
