The '''philosophy of probability''' presents problems chiefly in matters of [[epistemology]] and the uneasy interface between [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and ordinary language as it is used by non-mathematicians.  
[[Probability theory]] is an established field of study in mathematics.  It has its origins in correspondence discussing the mathematics of [[games of chance]] between [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in the seventeenth century, and was formalized and rendered [[axiom]]atic as a distinct branch of mathematics by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] in the twentieth century.  In its axiomatic form, mathematical statements about probability theory carry the same sort of epistemological confidence shared by other mathematical statements in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].<ref>Laszlo E. Szabo, ''[http://philosophy.elte.hu/colloquium/2001/October/Szabo/angol011008/angol011008.html A Physicalist Interpretation of Probability]'' (Talk presented on the Philosophy of Science Seminar, E<U+00F6>tv<U+00F6>s, Budapest, 8 October 2001.)</ref> <ref>Laszlo E. Szabo, Objective probability-like things with and without  objective indeterminism, Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics 38 (2007) 626<U+2013>634 (''[http://philosophy.elte.hu/leszabo/Preprints/lesz_no_probability_preprint.pdf Preprint]'')</ref>

The mathematical analysis originated in observations of the behaviour of game equipment such as [[playing card]]s and [[dice]], which are designed specifically to introduce random and equalized elements; in mathematical terms, they are subjects of [[indifference]].  This is not the only way probabilistic statements are used in ordinary human language: when people say that "''it will probably rain''", they typically do not mean that the outcome of rain versus not-rain is a random factor that the odds currently favor; instead, such statements are perhaps better understood as qualifying their expectation of rain with a degree of confidence.  Likewise, when it is written that "the most probable explanation" of the name of [[Ludlow, Massachusetts]] "is that it was named after [[Roger Ludlow]]", what is meant here is not that Roger Ludlow is favored by a random factor, but rather that this is the most plausible explanation of the evidence, which admits other, less likely explanations.  

[[Thomas Bayes]] attempted to provide a [[logic]] that could handle varying degrees of confidence; as such, [[Bayesian probability]] is an attempt to recast the representation of probabilistic statements as an expression of the degree of confidence by which the beliefs they express are held.  

Though probability initially may have had lowly motivations, its modern influence and use is wide-spread ranging from [[Evidence based medicine|medicine]], through [[Six sigma|practical pursuits]], all the way to the [[Probabilistically checkable proof|higher-order]] and the [[String theory landscape|sublime]]. 

==Philosophy of statistics==
{{main|Philosophy of statistics}}
Considerations regarding the meaning and justification for deductions of propositions regarding the probability of [[observations]], [[data]], and results of [[testing]] [[hypotheses]] is the subject of the [[philosophy of statistics]].

==Degrees of certainty==
[[Rudolph Carnap]] and others tried to formulate a mathematical framework for evaluating objective [[degrees of certainty]] of propostions, with properties of probability, but  differing from probability as used in statistical inference, and differing from the subjective quality of [[Bayesian inference]].  

==Bayesian analysis==
Bayesian Analysis produces a probability-like number which measures the subjective degree of belief in a proposition (including conjunctions of propositions).
 
==Quantum physics==
Aspects of [[probability]] as it relates to [[determinism]] and the structure of the [[physical world]], were discussed in [[quantum physics]].  The discussion came to the attention of the general public with [[Einstein]]<U+2019>s quote <U+201C>[[God does not play dice]]<U+201D> (paraphrase).<ref>[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein]</ref>

==Shuffling and random number generation==
[[Persi Diaconis]] has debated the possibility of [[randomness]] in the [[macroscopic]] (non-quantum) world, as well as in [[random number generation]].{{Fact|date=February 2009}}
