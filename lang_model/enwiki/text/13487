"'''Beautiful Day'''" is the lead single from [[U2]]'s 2000 album, ''[[All That You Can't Leave Behind]]''. It was a huge commercial success, helping to launch the album to [[multi-platinum]] status and is currently the most successful single. The song won the band three [[Grammys]] in [[Grammy Awards of 2001|2001]]: [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].

==Composition==
According to [[Bono]], "Beautiful Day" is about "a man who has lost everything, but finds joy in what he still has."{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

The song is an optimistic anthem that opens with a drum machine and a rhythm sequencer. The verses are relatively quiet before [[The Edge]]'s guitar and the song's signature riff join in for the choruses. The Edge recorded this song on his [[Gibson Les Paul]] Standard and plays the song live with his [[Gibson Explorer]], which helps add the distinctive shimmering, chiming sound that made the band unique when they first debuted in the early 1980s.

In an episode of the [[Sundance Channel]]'s ''Iconoclast'', [[Michael Stipe]] said "I love that song. I wish I'd written it. It makes me dance."

"Beautiful Day" won the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]] in 2000 .

==Live history==
Ever since its tour debut at the first date of the [[Elevation Tour]] on [[March 24]], [[2001]] in [[Miami]], "Beautiful Day" has been played at every single full tour concert, as well as a number of promotional appearances and concerts not connected with a tour. On the Elevation Tour, "Beautiful Day" was normally the second song played, though it did open one show and was played late in the setlist at two concerts. During the [[Vertigo Tour]], it has appeared in the first half of the main set. It is featured on the live films ''[[Elevation: Live From Boston]]'', ''[[U2 Go Home: Live From Slane Castle]]'', and ''[[Vertigo: Live From Chicago]]''.  The song was also performed on stage, along with "[[Vertigo (song)|Vertigo]]" and "[[One (U2 song)|One]]", at [[Hyde Park]] in [[London]] for the [[Live 8]] concerts.  It was performed live in [[New Orleans]] for [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] and for the [[New Orleans Saints]] first game in New Orleans since [[Hurricane Katrina]].

==Music video==
The song's video showed the band walking around in [[Paris]]' [[Charles de Gaulle International Airport]], with scenes of the band playing on a runway interspliced with large jets taking off and landing overhead.

An alternative video for the song, shot in [[<U+00C8>ze]], [[France]], was featured on the ''[[The Best of 1990-2000]]'' [[The Best of 1990-2000#Bonus disc|bonus disc]] and the [[U218 Videos]] DVD.
