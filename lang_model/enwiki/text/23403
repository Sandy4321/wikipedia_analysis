'''V<U+00ED>mara Peres, Count of Portugal''' ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], circa [[820]] &mdash; [[Guimar<U+00E3>es]], [[873]])<ref>From V<U+00ED>mara (Weimar or Guimar) and the [[patronymic]] [[Peres]] (son of [[Pedro]] - [[Peter (name)|Peter]]).</ref> was a [[Christian]] [[warlord]] of the [[9th century]] in west [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]]. He was a vassal of the King of [[List of Asturian monarchs|Asturias]],  [[List of Leonese monarchs|L<U+00E9>on]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], [[Alfonso III of Le<U+00F3>n|Alfonso III]], and was sent to [[Reconquista|reconquer]] and secure from the [[Moors]] ([[Arab]]s and [[Berber people|Berbers]] who had invaded [[Visigoth]]ic [[Hispania]]), in the west coastal fringe of [[Gallaecia]], the area from the [[Minho River]] to the [[Douro River]], including the city of ''Portus Cale'', later [[Porto]], from were the name and political entity of [[Portugal]] emerged.

In [[868]] [[Count]] V<U+00ED>mara Peres established the [[First County of Portugal]] ({{lang-pt|Condado de Portucale}}), after the reconquest of the region north of the [[Douro]] river. 

He was able to expel the Moors and founded a fortified town under his own name ''Vimaranis'' (of Vimar) which later became ''Guimaranis'', present day [[Guimar<U+00E3>es]] (the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] call it "The Cradle City").

V<U+00ED>mara Peres died in 873 in Guimar<U+00E3>es. His son, [[Luc<U+00ED>dio Vimaranes]] (Luc<U+00ED>dio, son of V<U+00ED>mara), took control of the county. The dynasty of his House lasted until [[1071]] when Count [[Nuno Mendes]] was defeated by King [[Garcia II of Galicia and Portugal]] in the [[Battle of Pedroso]].

Note that in [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Iberia, [[Count]] was a title and position equivalent to that of [[Duke]].
