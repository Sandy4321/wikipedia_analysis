{{nihongo|'''''Shin Megami Tensei IV'''''|<U+771F><U+30FB><U+5973><U+795E><U+8EE2><U+751F>IV||extra=literally "True Goddess Reincarnation IV"|lead=yes}} is a Japanese role-playing video game developed by [[Atlus]] for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. It is the sixth entry in the ''Shin Megami Tensei'' series, a spin-off from the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise, though no direct story connection exists to previous entries. It was released in May and July 2013 for Japan and North America respectively. It was released digitally in Europe in October 2014. The gameplay is reminiscent of previous ''Shin Megami Tensei'' games, carrying over the turn-based Press Turn battle system, where players and enemies fight and exploit weaknesses, gaining or losing turns depending on whether or not they strike weaknesses.

The story focuses on Flynn, a Samurai who protects the medieval Kingdom of Mikado from attacks by hostile demons. When the disguised demon Lilith begins attacking the population, Flynn and his companions follow Lilith underground, they come across the futuristic city of Tokyo, controlled by powerful demons. Flynn ends up at the center of a struggle for power between the demons of Tokyo and the controlling powers of Mikado.

Development began after the completion of ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey]]'', with the team deciding to make a fourth numbered entry in the series based on fan requests. The team intended to evoke the style and feeling of the original ''[[Shin Megami Tensei]]''. The original story was written by series designer [[Kazuma Kaneko]]. The main characters and some demons were designed by Masayuki Doi, previously known for his work on the ''[[Trauma Center (series)|Trauma Center]]'' series. It debuted to strong sales in Japan and was one of the better-selling games of the year. Reception of the game has been generally positive in both Japan and the west.

==Gameplay==

''Shin Megami Tensei IV'' puts players in control of the Samurai Flynn. Navigation takes place both in the third-person perspective with 3D-rendered environments and a 2D overhead worldmap.<ref name="GSpot"/><ref name= "Eurogamer"/> On the overworld map, icons represent the player party and enemy demons.<ref name="IGN"/> Battles take place from a first-person perspective, with the enemy visible on the upper screen and party status and commands on the lower screen.<ref name="GSpot"/> As with other role-playing video games, the character grows stronger and advanced by completing quests: the two types present are those relating to the main story and side quests, featuring optional objectives.<ref name= "Gem2"/> Should a player die, they can return to the game using macca, the in-game currency earned by completing quests, finding in-game collectables and other in-game activities. Nintendo Play Coins can also be used to resurrect the player. Dying enough makes an easier difficulty setting available.<ref name= "Eurogamer"/>

In battle, the player controls Flynn and three assigned demons, with one AI-controlled human support character. Players can either attack preemptively (granting them an advantage) or be attacked first (granting the advantage to the enemy).<ref name= "GameInform"/> During battle, both player and enemy actions are governed by the turn-based Press Turn System, a battle system carried over from previous entries in the series. The system revolves around exploiting physical or elemental weaknesses: if a character strikes another character's weak point or deal a critical hit, the party gains an extra turn, while if the attack is absorbed or blocked, they lose their turn.<ref name= "Gem1"/> If a character strikes a weakness enough times, they "Smirk": Smirking temporarily increases a character's strength and they lose their weakness, making them harder to attack.<ref name= "Gem1">{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2013/02/shin-megami-tensei-iv-battles-grinning-difficulty-and-revival|title=Shin Megami Tensei IV: battles, grinning, difficulty, and revival|author=Slayton, Olivia|publisher=Gematsu|date=11 February 2013|accessdate=20 October 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131011073405/http://gematsu.com/2013/02/shin-megami-tensei-iv-battles-grinning-difficulty-and-revival|archivedate=11 October 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> In Easy mode, the player can flee from battle.<ref name="GSpot"/>

Carried over from previous entries in the series are the Demon Recruitment and Fusion systems. To recruit demons, the player talks with a demon instead of fighting them, and must negotiate for their services: these negotiations can involve flattery, bribery or threats. Up to 400 demons are available for recruitment.<ref name= "Eurogamer"/> Demon Fusions allow the player to choose two demons and fuse them into a new form, granting new abilities.<ref name="IGN"/> During fusion, players can choose which skills are retained and which are discarded.

==Plot==
===Setting and characters===
''Shin Megami Tensei IV'' takes place in a world separate from the rest of the ''Shin Megami Tensei'' games, even though reference through recurring demons and abilities are present.<ref name= "Silicon1"/> The two main locations are the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado, a feudal society inspired by Medieval Europe, and [[Tokyo]], a futuristic city enclosed in a rock dome and controlled by demons.<ref name= "GIinsight"/> Hundreds of years before, when angels and demons were at war, Tokyo became a demon stronghold and was threatened with destruction. A member of Tokyo's Counter-Demon Force tamed the demon {{nihongo|Masakado|<U+30DE><U+30B5><U+30AB><U+30C9>|}}, then fused with him to create the protective dome over Tokyo.

Players control a Samurai whose task is to defend Mikado from demon attacks and the reincarnation of Tokyo's savior. His default name is {{nihongo|Flynn|<U+30D5><U+30EA><U+30F3>|Furin}}: as with previous ''Megami Tensei'' player characters, he is a silent protagonist, with his actions and attitudes determined by the player.<ref name= "SMTIVstaff"/><ref name= "USGinterview"/> Three other characters accompany Flynn on his journey, representing the game's three main morale alignments. They are {{nihongo|Jonathan|<U+30E8><U+30CA><U+30BF><U+30F3>|Yonatan}}, representing Law: {{nihongo|Walter|<U+30EF><U+30EB><U+30BF><U+30FC>|Warut<U+0101>}}, representing Chaos: and {{nihongo|Isabeau|<U+30A4><U+30B6><U+30DC><U+30FC>|Izab<U+014D>}}, representing the Neutral route. Other important characters include {{nihongo|Burroughs|<U+30D0><U+30ED><U+30A6><U+30BA>|Barouzu}}, Flynn's AI assistant: {{nihongo|Lilith|<U+30EA><U+30EA><U+30B9>|Ririsu}}, a powerful demon from Tokyo: and {{nihongo|Issachar|<U+30A4><U+30B5><U+30AB><U+30EB>|Isakaru}}, a former friend of Flynn's.

===Story===
Most of ''Shin Megami Tensei IV''{{'}}s storyline is dictated by the player beyond some set events, with choices made leading to one of the possible endings.<ref name= "DengInterview"/> The story begins with Flynn and Issachar traveling to the castle of Mikado to undergo a test as to whether they are worthy of becoming Samurai: while Issachar fails, Flynn succeeds and is promptly initiated, along with fellow candidates Walter, Jonathan and Isabeau. During his test and initiation, he receives a gauntlet containing the AI Burroughs, who acts as his support throughout the game. The group's role as Samurai is to protect the kingdom from malevolent demons: on an early mission, the group is sent to Flynn's home village after its population is corrupted by demon arts held in cursed books. The culprit is Lilith, who works under the guise of the "Black Samurai". One of those affected by Lilith's power is Issachar, who is transformed into a monster than Flynn is forced to kill. Sent by Mikado to capture the Black Samurai, the group end up chasing her to the underground city of Tokyo. In Tokyo the samurai meet the leader of Tokyo, who blackmails them into killing Yuriko, leader of the rebel "Head of Gaia" cult. They are later also tasked with freeing three mysterious masked men from the leader's tower by Gabby, a member of the Mikado church. The party succeeds in confronting Yuriko, who is revealed to Lilith, and she persuades Walter into changing the world's current state by disabling the Yamato reactor that provides Tokyo's power, which would "open the gates to hell".

Whichever Flynn chooses to support, both objectives are successful, while Isabaeu remains behind. The three are sent to two different timelines showing the outcomes of a world governed by Law and Chaos before being confronted by "the White", a group of beings produced by human thoughts who ask Flynn to put an end to the world. If Flynn refuses and the White are fought, Walter remains in Tokyo while Jonathan returns to Mikado. In Tokyo, Walter sacrifices himself to bring the demon Lucifer back to full power, and Lucifer begins plotting to destroy Mikado. In Mikado, the country has been undergoing a regime change as the "new leaders", the three masked men the samurai had previously freed, began a religious purge of the country, which included eliminating the class system, deposing and exiling the king and executing anyone who still reads the books distributed by Lilith. The three men, along with Gabby, are the four archangels, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael and Michael. Gabriel convinces Jonathan to sacrifice himself to them so that the four archangels are able to combine into Merkabah, a being powerful enough to fight Lucifer.

There are four possible endings. The first available ending is if Flynn agrees to the Whites' command and creates a black hole, destroying the world. If he refuses their request, Flynn's alignment is decided by his answers to the White when they question his moral goals. Should Flynn side with Law, he and Merkabah defeat Lucifer. In order to prevent further corruption of the people of Mikado, they destroy Tokyo, killing themselves in the process. If Flynn sides with Chaos, he and Lucifer defeat Merkabah. After destroying Mikado, the two begin the war against God. In the law and chaos routes, Isabeau returns to stop Flynn, but after he defeats her, she commits suicide. In the Neutral route, Flynn and Isabaeu decide to join forces against Merkabah and Lucifer, enlisting Masakado's help against them. After Merkebah's defeat, Isabeau evacuates Mikado's population to Tokyo. After Lucifer is defeated, Masakado uses his power to destroy the dome covering Tokyo, keeping the city intact while Mikado is destroyed.

==Development==
Development of ''Shin Megami Tensei IV'' began in 2009, after development had finished on ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]]. After listening to fan demand, Atlus decided to make a fourth numbered entry in the ''Shin Megami Tensei'' subseries, something not seen in Japan since the release of ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne|Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne]]'' in 2003. The concept of the game was inspired by the [[Punk subculture|punk]] feeling the original ''[[Shin Megami Tensei]]'' was emulating when it released. [[Kazuma Kaneko]], a character designer and scenario writer for the series, came up with the original scenario. Kaneko came up with the original concept for the medieval Mikado and modern-day Tokyo: the main reason for this was to present a contrast of values between the demon-hunting inhabitants of Mikado and the people of Tokyo, who live under the demons' control.<ref name= "Polygon">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/24/4260254/shin-megami-tensei-ivs-director-talks-about-the-series-and-its-punk|title=Shin Megami Tensei 4's director talks about the series and its 'punk' ethos|author=Gifford, Kevin|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=19 October 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130710170722/http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/24/4260254/shin-megami-tensei-ivs-director-talks-about-the-series-and-its-punk|archivedate=10 July 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> It was planned from an early stage for ''Shin Megami Tensei IV'' to be on a portable platform for reasons of player convenience. The Press Turn battle system, first introduced in ''Nocturne'', was also given an overhaul.
