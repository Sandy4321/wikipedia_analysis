The '''Prudhoe Lions''' are a pair of [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian]] red [[granite]] [[monumental sculpture]]s dating from the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]], around 1370 BC, now in the [[British Museum]].<ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/r/red_granite_lion.aspx British Museum page on one of the lions]</ref>

The lions originally stood as guardian figures at the [[Temple of Soleb]] in [[Nubia]], which was built by the [[pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep III]].  
Unsurprisingly for such magnificent statues, the lions carry many inscriptions which record their re-use by various rulers. The original inscriptions relate to Amenhotep III.  The renewal of the temple by [[Tutankhamun]] is also recorded: "he who renewed the monument of (or 'for') his father, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands, Nebmare, image of Re, Son of Re, Amenophis, Ruler of Thebes"<ref>H. W. Fairman, "Tutankhamun and the end of the 18th Dynasty" ''Antiquity'' 1972.</ref> Another inscription indicates that they were moved by [[Ay]], Tutankhamun's successor.  In the 3rd century BC the lions were moved to [[Jebel Barkal]], a city to the south of the country by [[Amanislo]], a [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushite]] king of [[Mero<U+00EB>]]. Following tradition, Amanislo also had his names engraved on the lions.<ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/r/red_granite_lion.aspx British Museum page on one of the lions]</ref>

In the early nineteenth century AD the lions were collected at Jebel Barkal by [[Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland|Lord Prudhoe]], who gave them to the British Museum in 1835. The pair share the registration number EA 2.<ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/r/red_granite_lion.aspx British Museum page on one of the lions]</ref>

The lions measure c.1.20m high and c 2.20m long. They are in a relaxed, naturalistic pose, lying on their sides with their heads turned to the side and their front paws crossed, rather than in the stiffer traditional pose of the sphinx or lion, with its head facing forwards and  paws extended to the front.<ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/r/red_granite_lion.aspx British Museum page on one of the lions]</ref>
