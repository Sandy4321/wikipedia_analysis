'''Ronald George Douglas''' (born December 10, 1938) is an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]], best known for his work on [[operator algebras]].

Douglas was born in [[Osgood, Indiana]].  He was an undergraduate at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], and received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1962 from [[Louisiana State University]] as a student of Pasquale Porcelli.  He was at the [[University of Michigan]] until 1969, when he moved to the [[Stony Brook University|State University of New York at Stony Brook]].  Beginning in 1986 he moved into university administration, eventually becoming Vice Provost at Stony Brook in 1990, and Provost at [[Texas A&M University]] from 1996 until 2002.  Currently he is a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Texas A&M.  He has three children, including [[Michael R. Douglas]], a noted [[string theory|string theorist]].

Among his best-known contributions to science is a 1977 paper with Lawrence G. Brown and Peter A. Fillmore, which introduced techniques from [[algebraic topology]] into the theory of operator algebras.  This work was an important precursor to [[noncommutative geometry]] as later developed by [[Alain Connes]] among others.
