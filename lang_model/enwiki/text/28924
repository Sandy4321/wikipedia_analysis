'''Lewis Fry Richardson''' ([[October 11]], [[1881]] - [[September 30]], [[1953]]) was an innovative [[mathematician]], [[physicist]] and [[psychologist]]. 

==Family background==
One of seven children, he was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]], into a well-off, merchant [[Quaker]] family, and was the son of Catherine Fry and David Richardson. He was the uncle of the actor Sir [[Ralph Richardson]]{{Fact|date=October 2007}}.

==Education and early working life==
He entered [[Bootham School]] in [[York]] in [[1894]] and fell under the dual influences of pacifist Quaker beliefs and, under master J. Edmund Clark, science, in particular, [[meteorology]]. In [[1898]] he attended Durham College of Science, to study [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[zoology]] and [[botany]], before graduating from [[King's College, Cambridge]] with a first-class degree in the Natural Science Tripos in [[1903]].

Richardson's working life reflected his eclectic interests:

*[[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] (1903-1904, 1907-1909)
*[[University of Wales, Aberystwyth|University College Aberystwyth]] (1905-1906)
*National Peat Industries (1906-1907) - as a [[chemist]]
*Sunbeam Lamp Company (1909-1912] - as manager of the physical and chemical laboratory
*[[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology|Manchester College of Technology]] (1912-1913)
*[[Met Office|Meteorological Office]] (1913-1916) - as superintendent of [[Eskdalemuir Observatory]]
* Friends Ambulance Unit in France between 1916 and 1919
* Works at the Meteorological Office at Benson, [[Oxfordshire]] between 1919 and 1920. 
* In 1920 is made Head of the [[Physics]] Department at Westminster Training College. 
* Between [[1929]] and [[1940]] is principal of the [[Paisley]] Technical College, now the [[University of Paisley]].

==Pacifism==
Richardson's Quaker beliefs entailed an ardent [[pacifism]] that exempted him from military service during [[World War I]] as a [[conscientious objector]] though this subsequently disqualified him from holding any academic post. Richardson worked from 1916 to 1919 for the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]] attached to the [[16th French Infantry Division]]. After the war, he rejoined the Meteorological Office but was compelled to resign on grounds of conscience when it was amalgamated into the [[Air Ministry]] in 1920. He subsequently pursued a career on the fringes of the academic world before retiring in 1940 to research his own ideas. His pacifism had direct consequences on his research interests. According to [[Thomas K<U+00F6>rner|Korner]] (see ref), the discovery that his meteorological work was of value to chemical weapons designers led him to abandon all his efforts in this field, and destroy findings that he had yet to publish.

==Weather forecasting==
Richardson's interest in meteorology led him to propose a scheme for [[weather forecasting]] by solution of [[differential equation]]s, the method used today, though, when he published ''Weather Prediction by Numerical Process'' in 1922, suitable fast computing was unavailable. He described his ideas thus :-

<U+201C>After so much hard reasoning, may one play with a fantasy? Imagine a large hall like a theatre, except that the circles and galleries go right round through the space usually occupied by the stage. The walls of this chamber are painted to form a map of the globe. The ceiling represents the north polar regions, England is in the gallery, the tropics in the upper circle, Australia on the dress circle and the Antarctic in the pit.

A myriad computers are at work upon the weather of the part of the map where each sits, but each computer attends only to one equation or part of an equation. The work of each region is coordinated by an official of higher rank. Numerous little "night signs" display the instantaneous values so that neighbouring computers can read them. Each number is thus displayed in three adjacent zones so as to maintain communication to the North and South on the map.

From the floor of the pit a tall pillar rises to half the height of the hall. It carries a large pulpit on its top. In this sits the man in charge of the whole theatre; he is surrounded by several assistants and messengers. One of his duties is to maintain a uniform speed of progress in all parts of the globe. In this respect he is like the conductor of an orchestra in which the instruments are slide-rules and calculating machines. But instead of waving a baton he turns a beam of rosy light upon any region that is running ahead of the rest, and a beam of blue light upon those who are behindhand.

Four senior clerks in the central pulpit are collecting the future weather as fast as it is being computed, and despatching it by pneumatic carrier to a quiet room. There it will be coded and telephoned to the radio transmitting station. Messengers carry piles of used computing forms down to a storehouse in the cellar.

In a neighbouring building there is a research department, where they invent improvements. But these is much experimenting on a small scale before any change is made in the complex routine of the computing theatre. In a basement an enthusiast is observing eddies in the liquid lining of a huge spinning bowl, but so far the arithmetic proves the better way. In another building are all the usual financial, correspondence and administrative offices. Outside are playing fields, houses, mountains and lakes, for it was thought that those who compute the weather should breathe of it freely.<U+201D> (Richardson 1922)

(Note that the word computers is used here in its original sense - people who did computations, not machines. Calculator also referred to people at this time.)
He was also interested in [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[turbulence]] and performed many terrestrial experiments. The [[Richardson number]], a [[dimensionless parameter]] in the theory of turbulence is named after him. He famously summarised the field in rhyming verse in ''Weather Prediction by Numerical Process'' (p 66):

:''Big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity,''
:''and little whirls have lesser whirls and so on to viscosity.''
[A play on Jonathan Swift's "Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em, And little fleas have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum." (1733)].

===Richardson's attempt at numerical forecast===
One of Richardson's most celebrated achievements is his attempt in hind sight to forecast the weather on a single day &mdash; 20 May 1910 &mdash; by direct computation. At the time, meteorologists carried out forecasts principally by looking for similar weather patterns from past records, and then extrapolating forward. Richardson attempted to use a mathematical model of the principal features of the atmosphere, and calculate the next day's weather [[ab initio]] from data taken at a specific time (7 am). As Lynch makes clear (see references), Richardson's forecast failed dramatically, predicting a huge 145 mbar rise in pressure over 6 hrs when the pressure actually stayed more or less static. However, detailed analysis by Lynch has shown that the cause was a failure to apply smoothing techniques to the data, which rule out unphysical surges in pressure. When these are applied, Richardson's forecast turns out to be essentially accurate &mdash; a remarkable achievement considering the calculations were done by hand, and while Richardson was serving with the Quaker ambulance unit in northern France.

== Mathematical analysis of war ==
Richardson also applied his mathematical skills in the service of his pacifist principles, in particular in understanding the roots of international conflict.  For this reason, today he is considered the founder, or co-founder (with [[Quincy Wright]] and [[Pitirim Sorokin]]), of the scientific analysis of conflict; an interdisciplinary field of quantitative and mathematical social science dedicated to systematic investigation of the causes of war and conditions of peace. As he had done with weather, he analyzed war using mainly differential equations and probability theory.  Considering the armament of two nations, Richardson posited an idealized system of equations whereby the rate of a nation's armament build-up is directly proportional to the amount of arms its rival has and also to the grievances felt toward the rival, and negatively proportional to the amount of arms it already has itself.  Solution of this system of equations allows insightful conclusions to be drawn regarding the nature, and the stability or instability, of various hypothetical conditions which might obtain between nations.

He also originated the theory that the propensity for war between two nations was a function of the length of their common border.  And in ''Arms and Insecurity'' ([[1949]]), and ''Statistics of Deadly Quarrels'' ([[1950]]), he sought to statistically analyze the causes of war.  Factors he assessed included economics, language, and religion.  In the preface of the latter, he wrote: "There is in the world a great deal of brilliant, witty political discussion which leads to no settled convictions.  My aim has been different: namely to examine a few notions by quantitative techniques in the hope of reaching a reliable answer."

== Research on the length of coastlines and borders ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Coast]] -->
While studying the causes of [[war]] between two countries, Richardson decided to search for a relation between the [[probability]] of two countries going to war and the length of their common border. While collecting data, he realised that there was considerable variation in the various gazetted lengths of international borders. For example, that between [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] was variously quoted as 987 or 1214 [[kilometre|km]] while that between [[The Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] as 380 or 449 km.

As part of his research, Richardson investigated how the measured length of a border changes as the unit of measurement is changed. He published empirical statistics which led to a conjectured relationship. This research was quoted by mathematician [[Beno<U+00EE>t Mandelbrot]] in his [[1967]] paper [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|How Long Is the Coast of Britain?]]

Suppose the coast of Britain is measured using a 200 km ruler, specifying that both ends of the ruler must touch the coast.  Now cut the ruler in half and repeat the measurement, then repeat again:

[[Image:britain-fractal-coastline-200km.png|150px|]]
[[Image:britain-fractal-coastline-100km.png|150px|]]
[[Image:britain-fractal-coastline-50km.png|150px|]]

Notice that the smaller the ruler, the bigger the result. It might be supposed that these values would converge to a [[finite set|finite]] number representing the "true" length of the coastline. However, Richardson demonstrated that the measured length of coastlines and other natural features appears to increase without limit as the unit of measurement is made smaller. Today this is known as the '''Richardson effect'''.

Note that Richardson's results do ''not'' mean that the coastline of Britain is actually infinitely long. This would require the ability to measure with infinitesimally small rulers, something which [[quantum physics]] says cannot be done, as there is a lower limit to the smallness of a measurement, the [[Planck length]]. What Richardson's results do show is that natural geographic features, when considered over a wide range of scales, do not behave in the same way as the objects of Euclidean geometry.

At the time, Richardson's research was ignored by the scientific community. Today, it is seen as one element in the birth of the modern study of [[fractal]]s.

Richardson died in [[Kilmun]], [[Argyllshire|Argyll]], [[Scotland]].
