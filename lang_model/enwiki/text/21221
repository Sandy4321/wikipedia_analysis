'''''Erick Onasis''''' is the third [[studio album]] from [[United States|American]] [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artist [[Erick Sermon]] (under the moniker Erick Onasis), released June 27, 2000 on [[DreamWorks Records]].

The album peaked at number fifty-three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and is notable for the recording debut of rapper [[Rick Ross]] who went by his original name Teflon Da Don.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Burgess|first1=Omar|title=Rick Ross Recalls Drawing Inspiration From EPMD|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.15174/title.rick-ross-recalls-drawing-inspiration-from-epmd|website=www.hiphopdx.com|publisher=Cheri Media Group|accessdate=2014-12-08}}</ref>


==Album title significance==
In regards to the album's title, it was also an alias that Sermon briefly adopted at the time for this particular album. In regards to the meaning, he stated:

<blockquote>"The name is something I came up with when I was watching the [coverage of the] death of [[JFK Jr.]] They [were] talking about him and his family and his mom came up, and then [[Aristotle Onassis|Aristotle]] came up. Then I read something on him, about four or five pages. And it was interesting to me, about how he was, how spiritual he was, how he was just coming up in the game until he mastered his field and became who he became. So I took that name."<ref>http://new.music.yahoo.com/erick-sermon/news/erick-sermon-explains-erick-onasis-name--12055748</ref></blockquote>

Another reason for the album's title was due to contractual issues stemming from Sermon's previous label [[Def Jam Recordings]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Burgess|first1=Omar|title=Rick Ross Recalls Drawing Inspiration From EPMD|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.15174/title.rick-ross-recalls-drawing-inspiration-from-epmd|website=www.hiphopdx.com|publisher=Cheri Media Group|accessdate=2014-12-08}}</ref> Because of the issue, ''Def Squad Presents Erick Onasis'' was promoted as a compilation album, despite Sermon's appearance and production on most of the songs.
