A '''nanophotonic resonator''' or '''nanocavity''' is an [[optical cavity]] which is on the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers in size. Optical cavities are a major component of all [[lasers]], they are responsible for providing [[amplification]] of a light source via [[positive feedback]], a process known as [[amplified spontaneous emission]] or ASE. Nanophotonic resonators offer inherently higher light energy confinement than ordinary cavities, which means stronger light-material interactions, and therefore lower [[lasing threshold]] provided the quality factor of the resonator is high.<ref>Akahane, Y., Asano, T., 5, B. S., & Noda, S. (2003). High-Q photonic nanocavity in a two-dimensional photonic crystal. Nature, 425(6961), 944-947.</ref>. Nanophotonic resonators can be made with photonic crystals, silicon, diamond, or metals such as gold. 

For a laser in a nanocavity, [[spontaneous emission]] (SE) from the [[gain medium]] is enhanced by the [[Purcell effect]]<ref>Altug, H., Englund, D., & Vu<U+010D>kovi<U+0107>, J. (2006). Ultrafast photonic crystal nanocavity laser. Nature Physics, 2(7), 484-488.</ref><ref>Purcell, E. Spontaneous emission probabilities at radio frequencies. Phys. Rev. 69, 681 (1946).</ref>, equal to the [[quality factor]] or Q-factor of the cavity divided by the effective mode field volume, F = Q/V<sub>mode</sub>. Therefore, reducing the the volume of an optical cavity can dramatically increase this factor, which can have the effect of decreasing the input power threshold for lasing <ref>Painter, O. et al. Two-dimensional photonic band-gap defect mode laser. Science 284, 1819<U+2013>1821 (1999).</ref><ref>Loncar, M., Yoshie, T., Scherer, A., Gogna, P. & Qiu, Y. Low-threshold photonic crystal laser. Appl. Phys. Lett. 81, 2680<U+2013>2682 (2002).</ref>. This also means that the response time of [[spontaneous emission]] from a [[gain medium]] in a nanocavity also decreases, the result being that the laser may reach lasing steady state picoseconds after it starts being pumped. A laser formed in a nanocavity therefore may be modulated via its pump source at very high speeds. Spontaneous emission rate increases of over 70 times modern semiconductor laser devices have been demonstrated, with theoretical laser modulation speeds exceeding 100 GHz, an order of magnitude higher than modern semiconductor lasers, and higher than most digital oscilloscopes <ref>Altug, H., Englund, D., & Vu<U+010D>kovi<U+0107>, J.

==Differences From Classical Cavities==

For cavities much larger than the [[wavelength]] of the light they contain, cavities with very high [[Q-factors]] have already been realized (~125,000,000) <ref>Armani, D. K., Kippenberg, T. J., Spillane, S. M. & Vahala, K. J. Ultra-high-Q toroid microcavity on a chip. Nature 421, 925<U+2013>928 (2003).</ref>. However, high Q cavities on the order of the same size as the optical wavelength have been difficult to produce due to the inverse relationship between radiation losses and cavity size <ref>Akahane, Y., Asano, T., 5, B. S., & Noda, S. (2003). High-Q photonic nanocavity in a two-dimensional photonic crystal. Nature, 425(6961), 944-947.</ref>. When dealing with a cavity much larger than the optical wavelength, it is simple to design interfaces such that light ray paths fulfill [[total internal reflection]] conditions or [[Bragg reflection]] conditions. For light confined within much smaller cavities near the size of the optical wavelength, deviations from [[ray optics]] approximations become severe and it becomes infeasible, if not impossible to design a cavity which fulfills optimum reflection conditions for all three spatial components of the propagating light wave vectors <ref>Akahane, Y., Asano, T., 5, B. S., & Noda, S. (2003). High-Q photonic nanocavity in a two-dimensional photonic crystal. Nature, 425(6961), 944-947.</ref><ref>Bayn, I., & Salzman, J. (2008). Ultra high-Q photonic crystal nanocavity design: The effect of a low-<U+03B5> slab material. Optics express, 16(7), 4972-4980.
</ref>. 

In a laser, the [[gain medium]] emits light randomly in all directions. With a classical cavity, the number of photons which are coupled into a single cavity mode relative to the total number of photons spontaneously emitted photons is relatively low because of the geometric inefficiency of the cavity, described by the [[Purcell factor]] Q/Vmode <ref>Coldren, L. A. & Corzine, S. W. Diode Lasers and Photonic Integrated Circuits (Wiley, New York, 1995).
</ref>. The rate at which lasing in such a cavity can be modulated depends on the relaxation frequency of the resonator described by equation 1.

R<sub>2</sub> = (av<sub>g</sub>P<sub>0</sub>)/<U+03C4><sub>p</sub> + <U+03B2>/(<U+03C4><sub>p</sub><U+03C4><sub>r0</sub>/F) + (<U+03B2>N<sub>0</sub>)/((<U+03C4><sub>r0</sub>/F)P<sub>0</sub>)(1/<U+03C4><sub>total</sub> - 1/(<U+03C4><sub>r0</sub>/F))      (1)

Where <U+03C4><sub>r0</sub> is the intrinsic carrier radiative lifetime of the bulk material, a is the differential gain, v<sub>g</sub> is the group velocity, <U+03C4><sub>p</sub> = Q/<U+03C9><sub>L</sub> is the photon lifetime, <U+03C9><sub>L</sub> is the lasing frequency, <U+03B2> is the spontaneous emission coupling factor which is enhanced by the Purcell effect, and 1 /<U+03C4><sub>total</sub> = F/<U+03C4><sub>r0</sub> +1/<U+03C4><sub>nr</sub> where <U+03C4><sub>nr</sub> is the non-radiative lifetime. In the case of minimal Purcell effect in a classical cavity with small F = Q/V<sub>mode</sub>, only the first term of equation 1 is considered, and the only way to increase modulation frequency is to increase photon density P<sub>0</sub> by increasing the pumping power. However, thermal effects practically limit the modulation frequency to around 20 GHz, making this approach is inefficient <ref>Altug, H., Englund, D., & Vu<U+010D>kovi<U+0107>, J. (2006). Ultrafast photonic crystal nanocavity laser. Nature Physics, 2(7), 484-488.</ref><ref>Lear, K. L. et al.

In nanoscale photonic resonators with high Q, the effective mode volume V<sub>mode</sub> is inherently very small resulting in high F and <U+03B2>, and terms 2 and 3 in equation 1 are no longer negligible. Consequently nanocavities are fundamentally better suited to efficiently produce spontaneous emission and amplified spontaneous emission light modulated at frequencies much higher than 20 GHz without negative thermal effects <ref>Altug, H., Englund, D., & Vu<U+010D>kovi<U+0107>, J.

==Resonator Materials and Designs==

[[File:Photonic Crystal Nanocavity.png|thumb|A nanocavity can be created by introducing a defect in a photonic crystal lattice structure]]

Nanocavities made from [[photonic crystals]] are typically implemented in a photonic crystal slab structure. Such a slab will generally have a periodic lattice structure of physical holes in the material. For light propagating within the slab, a reflective interface is formed at these holes due to the periodic differences in [[refractive index]] in the structure. 
	
A common photonic crystal nanocavity design shown is essentially a photonic crystal with an intentional defect (holes missing). This structure having periodic changes in refractive index on the order of the length of the optical wavelength satisfies [[Bragg reflection]] conditions in the y and z directions for a particular wavelength range, and the slab boundaries in the x direction create another reflective boundary due to oblique reflection at dielectric boundaries. This results in theoretically perfect wave confinement in the y and z directions along the axis of a lattice row, and good confinement along the x direction <ref>Noda, S., Chutinan, A. & Imada, M. Trapping and emission of photons by a single defect in a photonic bandgap structure. Nature 407, 608<U+2013>610 (2000).</ref><ref>Song, B. S., Noda, S. & Asano, T. Photonic devices based on in-plane hetero photonic crystals. Science 300, 1537 (2003).</ref>. Since this confinement effect along the y and z directions (directions of the crystal lattice) is only for a range of frequencies, it has been referred to as a [[photonic bandgap]], since there is a discrete set of [[photon energies]] which cannot propagate in the lattice directions in the material <ref>Noda, S., Chutinan, A. & Imada, M. Trapping and emission of photons by a single defect in a photonic bandgap structure. Nature 407, 608<U+2013>610 (2000).</ref>. However, because of the diffraction of waves propagating inside this structure, radiation energy does escape the cavity within the photonic crystal slab plane. The lattice spacing can be tuned to produce optimal boundary conditions of the standing wave inside the cavity to produce minimal loss and highest Q <ref>Akahane, Y., Asano, T., 5, B. S., & Noda, S. (2003). High-Q photonic nanocavity in a two-dimensional photonic crystal. Nature, 425(6961), 944-947.</ref>. 

Metals can also be an effective way to confine light in structures equal to or smaller than the optical wavelength. This effect is emergent from the confined [[surface plasmon]] resonance induced by the resonating light, which, when confined to the surface of a nanostructure such as a gold channel or nanorod, induces [[electromagnetic resonance]] <ref>Falkovsky, L. A. (2008, October). Optical properties of graphene. In Journal of Physics: Conference Series (Vol. 129, No. 1, p. 012004). IOP Publishing.</ref>. Surface plasmon effects are strong in the visible range because the [[permittivity]] of a metal is very large and negative at visible frequencies <ref>Kerman, A. J., Dauler, E. A., Keicher, W. E., Yang, J. K., Berggren, K. K., Gol<U+2019>Tsman, G., & Voronov, B. (2006). Kinetic-inductance-limited reset time of superconducting nanowire photon counters. Applied physics letters, 88(11), 111116.</ref><ref>Okumura, M., Nakamura, S., Tsubota, S., Nakamura, T., Azuma, M., & Haruta, M. (1998). Chemical vapor deposition of gold on Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 for the oxidation of CO and of H2. Catalysis Letters, 51(1-2), 53-58.</ref>. At frequencies higher than the visible range, the permittivity of a metal is closer to zero, and the metal stops being useful for focussing electric and magnetic fields <ref>Okumura, M., Nakamura, S., Tsubota, S., Nakamura, T., Azuma, M., & Haruta, M. (1998). Chemical vapor deposition of gold on Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 for the oxidation of CO and of H2. Catalysis Letters, 51(1-2), 53-58.</ref>. This effect was originally observed in radio and microwave engineering, where metal antennas and waveguides may be hundreds of times smaller than the free-space wavelength. In the same way, visible light can be constricted to the nano level with metal structures which form channels, tips, gaps, etc. Gold is also a convenient choice for nanofabrication because of its unreactivity and ease of use with chemical vapour deposition <ref>Gagliardi, R. M., & Karp, S. (1976). Optical communications. New York, Wiley-Interscience, 1976. 445 p., 1.</ref>. 

[[File:Planar Nanocavity.png|thumb|A thin film on top of a reflective substrate traps light inside]]

A planar nanocavity consists of an absorptive semiconductive film no more than a few nanometers thick over a metal film also a few nanometers thick <ref>Song, B. S., Noda, S. & Asano, T. Photonic devices based on in-plane hetero photonic crystals. Science 300, 1537 (2003).</ref>.  Incident light is absorbed and reflected off of both layers, the absorbed light then resonates between the two interfaces, transmitting some light back at after each cycle. Germanium is commonly used for the absorptive layer, while gold, aluminum, and aluminum oxide are used as alternatives as well <ref>Song, B. S., Noda, S. & Asano, T. Photonic devices based on in-plane hetero photonic crystals. Science 300, 1537 (2003).</ref>.  Planar nanocavities are commonly used for thin film interference, which occurs when incident light waves reflected by the upper and lower boundaries of a thin film interfere with one another forming a new wave. An example of this is the colorful patterns produced by thin layers of oil on a surface. The difference in colors is due to minute differences in the distance reflected light travels whether it reflects from the top or bottom boundary of the oil layer. This difference is called the optical path difference, the difference in distance between the top and bottom reflection paths, which can be calculated with equation 2: 

OPD = 2nd cos(<U+03B8>)     (2)

OPD = m<U+03BB>      (3)

Where n is the [[refractive index]] of the absorptive material, d is the thickness of the absorptive film, and theta is the angle of reflection.  As expressed in the equation 3, the optical path length difference (OPD) can be related to wavelengths which constructively interfere in the thin film. As a result, light which enters the film at different angles interferes with itself varying amounts, produces an intensity gradient for narrowband light, and a spectrum gradient for white light.   

==Examples/Applications==
	
Nanophotonic circuit designs are similar in appearance to microwave and radio circuits, minimized by a factor of 100,000 or more. Researchers have made nano-optical antennas which emulate the design and functionality of radio antennas <ref>Falkovsky, L. A. (2008, October). Optical properties of graphene. In Journal of Physics: Conference Series (Vol. 129, No. 1, p. 012004). IOP Publishing.</ref>. There are a number of important differences between nanophotonics and scaled down microwave circuits. At optical frequency, metals behave much less like ideal conductors, and also exhibit plasmon-related effects like [[kinetic inductance]] and [[surface plasmon resonance]] <ref>Kotter, D. K., Novack, S. D., Slafer, W. D., & Pinhero, P. (2008, January). Solar nantenna electromagnetic collectors. In ASME 2008 2nd International Conference on Energy Sustainability collocated with the Heat Transfer, Fluids Engineering, and 3rd Energy Nanotechnology Conferences (pp. 409-415). American Society of Mechanical Engineers.</ref>. A nantenna is a nanoscopic rectifying antenna, a technology being developed to convert light into electric power. The concept is based on the rectenna which is used in wireless power transmission. A rectenna functions like a specialized radio antenna which is used to convert radio waves into direct current electricity. Light is composed of electromagnetic waves like radio waves, but of a much smaller wavelength. A nantenna, an application of a nanophotonic resonator, is a nanoscale rectenna on the order of the optical wavelength size, which acts as an "antenna" for light, converting light into electricity. Arrays of nantennas could be an efficient means of converting sunlight into electric power, producing solar energy more efficiently than semiconductor bandgap [[solar cells]] <ref>Kotter, D. K., Novack, S. D., Slafer, W. D., & Pinhero, P. (2008, January). Solar nantenna electromagnetic collectors.

It has been suggested that nanophotonic resonators be used on multi core chips to both decrease size and boost efficiency<ref>Zhou, Linjie; Djordjevic, Stevan S.; Proietti, Roberto; Ding, Dan; Yoo, S. J.; Amirtharajah, Rajeevan;  et al.(2009). Design and evaluation of an arbitration-free passive optical crossbar for on-chip interconnection networks. Applied Physics A: Materials Science & Processing, 95(4), pp 1111-1118.</ref>.  This is done by creating arrays of nanophotonic [[ring resonators]] that can transmit specific wavelengths of light between each other. Another use of nanophotonic resonators in computers is in optical RAM (O-RAM).  O-Ram uses photonic crystal slab structure with properties such as strong confinement of photons and carriers to replace the functions of electrical circuits. The use of optical signals versus electrical signals is a 300% decrease in power consumption <ref>Nozaki, Kengo, Akihiko Shinya, Shinji Matsuo, Yasumasa Suzaki, Toru Segawa, Tomonari Sato, Yoshihiro Kawaguchi, Ryo Takahashi, and Masaya Notomi. "Ultralow-power all-optical RAM based on nanocavities." Nature Photonics 6, no. 4 (2012): 248-252.</ref>. Researchers have developed planar nanocavities that can reach 90% peak absorption using interference effects.  This result is useful in that there are numerous applications that can benefit from these findings, specifically in energy conversion <ref>Song, B. S., Noda, S. & Asano, T. Photonic devices based on in-plane hetero photonic crystals. Science 300, 1537 (2003).</ref>
