"'''Over the Hills and Far Away'''" is the third track from [[England|English]] [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Led Zeppelin]]'s 1973 album ''[[Houses of the Holy]]''.

==Overview==
[[Jimmy Page]] and [[Robert Plant]] originally constructed the song in 1970 at [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], a small cottage in [[Wales]] where they stayed after completing a gruelling [[concert tour]] of the [[United States]].<ref name="Sutcliffe_Q">Phil Sutcliffe, "Back to Nature", ''Q Magazine'' Special Led Zeppelin edition, 2003, p. 34.</ref> 

Page plays a six-string [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic]] guitar introduction with a melody reminiscent of "[[White Summer]]". Page repeats the theme with 12-string acoustic guitar in unison. In an interview published in ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine's November 1993 issue, Page commented on the construction of the song:

{{cquote|GW: There<U+2019>s an acoustic guitar running throughout the song.  Did you play a main acoustic and then overdub an electric?

Page: No, we played it through entirely as you know it, but I was playing electric.

GW: So you simply edited out of the beginning?

Page: Yeah, that<U+2019>s right.  <U+201C>Presumably<U+201D>.  It sounds that way.  It sounds like the acoustic is going straight through.}}

Plant's vocals enter on the next repetition.  He tenderly offers himself to the "lady" who's "got the love [he] need[s]."  The acoustic guitars build in a crescendo toward the abrupt infusion of Page's [[electric guitar]]s along with drummer [[John Bonham]]'s and bass guitarist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]]' rhythm accompaniment.

Through the pre-verse interludes and instrumental bridge, "Over the Hills and Far Away" stands out as an example of Jones and Bonham's tight interplay.  Following the final verse, the rhythm section fades out, gradually replaced by the echo returns from Page's electric guitar and a few chords played by Jones on [[harpsichord]].<ref>Tolinski, Brad and di Benedetto, Greg (January 1998). "Light and Shade: A Historic Look at the Entire Led Zeppelin Catalogue Through the Eyes of Guitarist/Producer/Mastermind Jimmy Page". Guitar World</ref>  In the final 8 bars, Page executes a linearly descending/ascending sequence and then concludes with the idiomatic V-I tag on [[pedal steel guitar]].

The song was released as ''Houses of the Holy's'' first U.S. single, reaching #51 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart, later becoming a staple of the [[Classic rock]] radio format.

Set lists from [[Led Zeppelin concerts]] frequently contained "Over the Hills and Far Away", the song being one that the band introduced on stage well ahead of its studio release.<ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.</ref> The group first played it during their [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1972|1972 concert tour of the United States]] and retained it consistently through 1979, before omitting it from their final [[Tour Over Europe 1980|tour of Europe in 1980]]. In singing the song live, Plant commonly followed the words "pocket-full of gold" with "[[Acapulco gold|Acapulco Gold]]" (a type of marijuana), as can be heard on the live album ''[[How the West Was Won (Led Zeppelin album)|How the West Was Won]].'' Also, at concerts guitarist Jimmy Page performed an extended guitar solo, which essentially consisted of the rhythm and lead guitar parts of the album version split into two separate pieces.  This extended solo made the live renditions last almost or more than seven minutes.

Archive footage of this track being performed live at [[Seattle]] in 1977 and at [[Knebworth Festival 1979|Knebworth in 1979]] was used for an officially distributed video of the song, used to promote the 1990 ''[[Led Zeppelin Remasters]]'' release.<ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.</ref>
