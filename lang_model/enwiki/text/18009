The '''flag of the Republic of Maldives''' is red with a large [[green]] rectangle in the center bearing a vertical [[white]] [[crescent]]; the closed side of the crescent is on the hoist side of the flag. 

It is the official and most commonly used symbol of the [[Maldives]] and was adopted on [[July 25]] [[1965]].<br><br>
==History==
The very first Maldivian flag was predominantly red in color and was used by the [[Sultans]] until the beginning of the [[20th Century]]. It had a practical design to augment visibility when set against the blue background of the [[Ocean|seas]]. It featured a [[black]] and white [[hoist]] called the ''Dhandimathi'' ([[Dhivehi]]: <U+078B><U+07A6><U+0782><U+0791><U+07A8><U+0789><U+07A6><U+078C><U+07A8>) which was an extension of the flagpole. This was presumably because old flagpoles were painted white with a black strip spiralling upwards. This historic flag has been mistakenly associated with the idea of [[communism]], however since the flag predates communism this assumption is not generally accepted.

As a result of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s successful campaigns to promote the crescent as an [[Islamic symbolism|Islamic symbol]] (which was in fact an ancient symbol of their great city of [[Constantinople]]) throughout the [[19th Century]], [[Prime Minister]] Amir Abdul Majid Didi inserted the crescent with its horns pointing towards the hoist, on a newly introduced green rectangle centered inside the original flag. This erroneous version (compared to [[byzantine Empire|byzantine]] standards) lasted until [[1947]] when it was corrected and the new flag with the crescent towards the fly was introduced.

When Mohamed Jameel wrote the lyrics for the [[Gaumii salaam|National Anthem]] in [[1948]], he had overlooked to acknowledge the color black in the flag perhaps because people had started to see it as an anomaly rather than an integral part. Thus the hoist was removed and the new flag which we see today adopted on [[July 25]] [[1965]]. In the same year [[Muhammad Fareed Didi]] adopted a five-point star (located between the horns of the crescent) to exclusively represent the Sultan. This flag is still used today by the [[President]] as his [[ensign]].

==Symbolism==

The [[red]] color in the outermost rectangle represents the boldness of the nation's heroes, in the past, future and present, who were not (and will bot be) hesitant to sacrifice up to his very last drop of [[blood]] defending their nation. The green rectangle in the center represents the innumerable amount of [[coconut palm]] trees in the [[islands]], a historic life source still used for various purposes today. And the white crescent [[moon]] symbolizes a state of unified [[Islamic]] faith.
