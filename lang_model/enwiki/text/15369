==Structure==

The nave is the oldest part of the church dating from 1430 and is built from [[limestone]].  The tower and chancel were built some 40 years later in [[sandstone]].  The church is entirely [[Perpendicular Period|perpendicular]] in style.<ref name="richards"/> The plan of the church consists of a tower at the west end, a wide three-bay nave without aisles, a south porch and a chancel divided from the nave by a screen.<ref name="salter">{{citation  | last =Salter | first =Mark | title =The Old Parish Churches of Cheshire | publisher =Folly Publications | date =1995 | location =Malvern  | page =38 | isbn =1871731232 }}</ref>  The tower has angular [[buttress]]es with [[niche]]s which used to contain statues, [[gargoyle]]s, [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of Cheshire families and [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] badges. The porch also has niches over the doorway.<ref name="richards"/> The nave is embattled and has [[pinnacle]]s.<ref name=pev/>

==Fittings and furniture==

The [[rafter|rafter beam]] ceiling of the nave dates from the 15th century and the [[camber beam]] chancel ceiling, which is panelled, dates from slightly later.<ref>{{citation  | last =Morant | first =Roland W. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Cheshire Churches |edition= | publisher =Countyvise | date =1989 | location =Birkenhead | page =133 |  isbn =0 907768 18 0 }}</ref>  The chancel screen is dated 1894.

In the 19th century most of the old stained glass was removed, although fragments remain in the chancel windows.<ref name="richards"/><ref>{{citation  |url=http://merlin.cch.kcl.ac.uk:8080/cvma/servlet/site?countyCode=CH&place=%C2%A0&site=%20St%20James&LocationID=637&-querytype=2&county=Cheshire |title=Gawsworth, St James |accessdate= 11&nbsp;May 2009|publisher=Corpus Vitrearum Medii Aevi (stained glass)}}</ref>  The stained glass in the east window is by [[William Wailes]].<ref name=pev/>

In the chancel are four tombs of members of the Fitton (Fytton) family.  The oldest is an altar tomb to Francis Fytton dated 1608.  On the top of the tomb is his recumbent bearded [[effigy]] and beneath him is a skeleton.  Opposite is the monument to Dame Alice Fitton who died around 1626.  In front of her seated effigy are effigies of her two sons kneeling and behind her are figures of her two daughters, also kneeling.  Adjacent is the tomb of Sir Edward Fitton, 1st baronet, and his wife Anne who died in 1619 and 1644 respectively.  In front of the tomb are the keeling figures of their three sons and seven daughters.  One of the daughters was [[Mary Fitton|Mary]], a [[Maid of honor#United Kingdom|maid of honour]] to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] and a candidate for the "Dark Lady" of [[Shakespeare's sonnets]].  The fourth tomb is to the memory of Sir Edward Fitton, 2nd baronet, who died in 1643, and his first wife Jane.<ref name="richards"/> 

The two-[[manual (music)|manual]] organ was built by Nicholson & Lord of Walsall in 1895, obscuring the southwest window.  In 1917 it was enlarged by Hayter & Son of Letchworth, obscuring the west window.  In 1961 the organ was rebuilt and divided by Cyril Wood of Ashton-under-Lyne to reveal the west window.<ref>{{citation  |url= http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N02477 |title= Gawsworth St. James |accessdate=10&nbsp;August 2008 |publisher= [[British Institute of Organ Studies]] }}</ref>  The communion plate includes a cup and paten dating from the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] or [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and a [[chalice (cup)|chalice]] dated 1762&ndash;63.<ref name=pev/> The [[ring of bells|ring]] consists of eight bells.
