'''Ashland''' is a city in [[Jackson County, Oregon|Jackson County]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]], near [[Interstate 5]] and the California border, and located in the south end of the [[Rogue Valley]]. It was named after [[Ashland County, Ohio]], point of origin of [[Abel Helman]] and other founders, and secondarily for [[Ashland, Kentucky]], where other founders had family connections. It officially became a town with the name Ashland Mills in 1855. As of July 1, 2011, the city had a total population of 20,255.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pdx.edu/prc/population-estimates-0|title=2011 Certified Population Estimates|publisher=Portland State University|accessdate=December 29, 2011}}</ref> It is the home of [[Southern Oregon University]] (SOU) and the [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]] (OSF).

== History ==
Prior to the arrival of settlers in mid-19th century, [[Shasta (tribe)|Shasta]] Indians lived in the valley along the creek approximately where Ashland is located.<ref name="Davidson 137">Davidson, p. 137</ref> Early [[Hudson's Bay Company]] hunters and trappers, following the [[Siskiyou Trail]], passed through the site in the 1820s.  In the late 1840s, settlers (mostly American) following the [[Applegate Trail]] began passing through the area. By the early 1850s, the [[Donation Land Claim Act of 1850|Donation Land Act]] brought many white settlers into the [[Rogue Valley]] and in conflict with its native people. These often violent clashes continued until 1856.<ref name="Davidson 137"/>

In 1851, gold was discovered at Rich Gulch, a tributary of Jackson Creek, and a tent city developed on its banks, the area later known as [[Jacksonville, Oregon|Jacksonville]].<ref name="History of Ashland">{{cite web|title=History of Ashland|publisher=City of Ashland|url=http://www.move2ashland.com/ashland/history_of_ashland.htm|accessdate=July 14, 2010|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100801194357/http://www.move2ashland.com/ashland/history_of_ashland.htm| archivedate=August 1, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Settlers arrived in the Ashland area in January 1852, including Robert B. Hargadine, Sylvester Pease, Abel D Helman, Eber Emery, and others.<ref name="Dickinson 138-41">Dickinson, p. 138</ref> Helman and Hargadine filed the first donation land claims in Ashland.<ref name="Dickinson 138-41"/> Helman and Emery built a sawmill along what they called Mill Creek (later renamed [[Ashland Creek]]) to turn timber into lumber for settlers.<ref name="Dickinson 138-41"/> 

Joined by M. B. Morris, in 1854, the two men built a second mill, Ashland Flouring Mills, to grind local wheat into flour. The community around the mill became known as ''Ashland Mills''. A post office was established in Ashland Mills in 1855 with Helman as postmaster.<ref name="Dickinson 138-41"/>

During the 1860s and 1870s the community grew, establishing a school, churches, businesses, and a large employer, Ashland Woolen Mills, which produced clothing and blankets from local wool. In 1871, the Post Office dropped "Mills" from Ashland's name. In 1872 Reverend J. H. Skidmore opened a college, Ashland Academy, a predecessor of [[Southern Oregon University]].<ref name="Dickinson 138-41"/>

In 1887, [[Portland, Oregon]], and [[San Francisco, California]], were joined by rail at Ashland. Until 1926, when most rail service began taking a different route (east through [[Klamath Falls, Oregon|Klamath Falls]] to avoid the steep grade through the [[Siskiyou Mountains]]), Ashland thrived on rail trade of local products, including pears, peaches, and apples.<ref name="History of Ashland"/> 

In 1908, the Women's Civic Improvement Club petitioned for the creation of a park<U+2014>Ashland Canyon Park<U+2014>along Ashland Creek. The discovery of [[Lithium|lithia]] water near Emigrant Lake around the same time led to a plan to establish a mineral spa at the park. Voters approved bonds to pay for the project, which included piping the mineral water from its source to Ashland. The town engaged [[John McLaren (horticulturist)|John McLaren]], landscape architect of San Francisco's [[Golden Gate Park]], to design the park, renamed Lithia Springs Park, later shortened to [[Lithia Park]]. Although the park was popular, the mineral spa plans proved too expensive for local taxpayers and were abandoned in 1916. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs took to bottling and selling mineral waters from the area's springs.<ref>Davidson, pp. 35&ndash;45</ref>

During the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] celebration in 1935, [[Angus L. Bowmer]] arranged the first performances of what would become the [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]] (OSF). The festival grew during the 20th&nbsp;century, and has become an award-winning and internationally-known regional theater company.<ref>Peterson, p. 93</ref>

Many of Ashland's historic buildings have been preserved and restored. The city has 48 individual structures and 2 historic districts (the Ashland Railroad Addition District and the Downtown District) on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="NPS Intro">{{cite web|title=Ashland Oregon: From Stage Coach to Center Stage: Introduction|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/ashland/intro.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}</ref> The structures include the Enders Building (home of the Columbia Hotel), which from 1910 to 1928 contained the largest mercantile establishment between Sacramento and Portland.<ref name=>{{cite web|title=Ashland, Oregon: From Stage Coach to Center Stage: Enders Building|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/ashland/end.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 9, 2013}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Ashland is located in the foothills of the Siskiyou and [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] ranges, about 15 miles (24&nbsp;km) north of the [[California]] border on [[Interstate 5]].

The city is {{convert|350|mi|km}} north of San Francisco and {{convert|285|mi|km}} south of Portland in an area once proposed to become the [[Jefferson (Pacific state)|State of Jefferson]].  It is {{convert|90|mi|km}} from [[Crater Lake National Park]] and [[Oregon Caves National Monument]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.59|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.<ref name ="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher={{URL|1=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau|2=United States Census Bureau}}|accessdate=2012-12-21}}</ref>
