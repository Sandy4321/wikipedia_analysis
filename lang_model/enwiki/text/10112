'''Quilt''' is a software utility for managing a series of changes to the [[source code]] of any [[computer program]]. Such changes are often referred to as "patches" or "patch sets", and essentially Quilt takes N patches and turns them into a single patch. In doing so, quilt makes it easier for other programmers to test and evaluate the different changes before they are permanently inserted into the source code. This type of tool is very important for distributed [[software development]] where many programmers are collaborating to test and build a single large codebase. It's heavily used, for example, by the maintainers of the [[Linux kernel]].

Quilt evolved from a set of patch-management scripts originally written by [[Linux kernel]] developer [[Andrew_Morton_%28computer_programmer%29|Andrew Morton]], and was developed by Andreas Gr<U+00FC>nbacher for maintaining Linux kernel customizations for [[SuSE Linux]].<ref>{{cite paper |author=Gr<U+00FC>nbacher, Andreas |title=How To Survive With Many Patches, or Introduction to Quilt |date=2005-06-12 |url=http://www.suse.de/~agruen/quilt.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2008-04-25}}</ref> It is now being developed as a community effort, hosted at the [[GNU Savannah]] project repository and distributed as [[free software]] (the exact license is [[GNU General Public License]] v2 or later).

The name originated from [[patchwork quilt]].
