"'''Bootylicious'''" is a song by American [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] group [[Destiny's Child]]. It was written and produced by [[Rob Fusari]], Falonte Moore, and band member [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] for the band's third studio album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' (2001), and contains a prominent [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from the 1981 recording "[[Edge of Seventeen (song)|Edge of Seventeen]],"<ref>[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x26m1b_stevie-nicks-edge-of-seventeen_music "Edge of Seventeen", Stevie Nicks]</ref> as written and performed by [[Stevie Nicks]].

The track was released as the album's second [[single (music)|single]] from the album in 2001 and became the band's fourth U.S. non-consecutive number-one single. It also reached the top-five in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

==The song and its success==
The song "Bootylicious" is about a confident woman taunting a man, suggesting that he is not ready because her body is "too bootylicious". Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles has stated in her ''[[I Am... Yours]]'' concert that she was inspired to write the song on a flight to Japan as she was listening to the guitar riff of the [[Stevie Nicks]] song "[[Edge of Seventeen (song)|Edge of Seventeen]]", which reminded her of a "voluptuous woman." Platinum music producers [[Rob Fusari]] and Falonte Moore produced this record and featured a sample from the Stevie Nicks song, and Stevie herself appears in the beginning of the video. It is also one of the few times that [[Kelly Rowland]] takes the lead, having two verses to [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]]' one, though Knowles still ad libs.  Despite Rowland's lead in the song, [[Kelly Rowland]] has mentioned that "Bootylicious" is the most irritating [[Destiny's Child]] song for her since she has heard it too many times.<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/rowland%20cant%20stand%20bootylicious_1057096 ContactMusic.com 2008]</ref>

==Questions about Authorship==
In the February 27, 2010 edition of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, [[Rob Fusari]] is interviewed about his career and briefly discusses the song and its genesis. In the article he states that he alone had the idea for the song and had originally intended to use another guitar riff but after not being able to find it he happened to come across the Stevie Nicks CD instead. He goes on to say that he was so upset when he saw Beyonc<U+00E9> claim credit for the song in an interview with [[Barbara Walters]] that he telephoned [[Mathew Knowles]]. According to Fusari, Mr Knowles told him "People don't want to hear about [[Rob Fusari]], producer from Livingstone, NJ... that's not what sells records".

==Chart performance==
"Bootylicious" debuted at #66 on the Hot 100 on June 9, 2001 and climbed to its peak position nine weeks later, and remained on the chart for a relatively short nineteen weeks. The song became Destiny's Child's fifth consecutive No.1 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart, despite [[Mariah Carey]]'s "[[Loverboy (Mariah Carey song)|Loverboy]]" keeping it from topping the Hot 100 Singles Sales.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], "Bootylicious" was released on July 23, 2001 and debuted at #2 on the singles chart behind the [[Atomic Kitten]] cover single "[[Eternal Flame (song)|Eternal Flame]]". It sold over 169,000 copies and propelled ''Survivor'' back to the top of The Official UK Albums Chart.

==Remixes==
A [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-styled [[remix]] (the "Rockwilder Remix") was produced by [[Rockwilder]], Knowles, and [[Missy Elliott]]. This version was issued to [[urban contemporary|urban]] markets, and had a [[Hip hop culture|hip-hop]] culture-based [[music video]] to accompany it, in which [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles|Beyonc<U+00E9>]] wears a belt that has the word "Bootylicious" misspelled as "Bootyliciuos", as pointed out by [[Carson Daly]] on an episode of ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]''.

A combination of the [[R&B]] vocals from this song and the [[grunge rock]] music of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]"<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrpB4VOUuc8 YouTube: "Nirvana Vs Destiny's Child"]</ref> is one of the best-known examples of the "[[bastard pop]]" or "mashup" genre, where elements from seemingly incompatible songs are mixed together. A later mashup used the music of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]" with the "Bootylicious" vocals.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSZ2hyjEAoM YouTube: "Destiny's Child vs Stevie Wonder - Bootystition"]</ref>

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for "Bootylicious", directed by [[Matthew Rolston]], showed Destiny's Child performing dance steps from [[Michael Jackson]]'s famous "[[Billie Jean]]" performance from the special ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]''. During the video, moves from several other Michael Jackson videos can be seen such as parts of the choreograpy from "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]", "[[Beat it]]", "[[Bad (song)|Bad]]" and "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]". Dance moves that were used by Jackson during live performances of "[[They Don't Care About Us]]" can be seen as well.

As the group is dancing, the members appear in several different costumes. These scenes are interloped with the group dancing in front of a dance troupe made of all boys. [[Stevie Nicks]] makes an appearance in the beginning of the song's video. [[Solange Knowles]], Beyonc<U+00E9>'s sister, also makes a brief cameo in the video.

The music clip is featured on the DualDisc edition of the album ''[[Number 1's (Destiny's Child album)|#1's]]'' and as an enhanced video on the UK and French editions of the Single. The video for the "[[Rockwilder]] Remix" featuring [[Missy Elliott]] is available on the Single "Emotion Bootylicious Survivor - The Urban Remixes"<ref>http://www.recordrunnerusa.com/destinys-child-emotion-bootylicious-survivor-urban-remixes-smash-singles-wbootylicious-video-p-14065.html?osCsid=ar8gfnaghmn8nrlb1vtr4nsp37</ref>.

==Live performances==
Destiny's child opened the 1st Annual [[BET Awards]] with a performance of bootylicious.<ref>http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=217</ref>
They performed it on both [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special]] concerts. According with Kelly Rowland, he liked this song so much, and when he saw them for the first time, he started to sing it, and they got very surprised.

==Cultural significance==
The song created moderate controversy, in a time when late '90s [[teen pop]] was pushing the boundaries of female sexuality. [[Destiny's Child]] was claiming "G-rated fun" and confidence in body image though the lyrics yet the music video suggested much more with the group wearing lots of make-up, form-fitting clothes, performing sexually suggestive dancing, and the video featuring close-ups on several dancers buttocks<ref>[http://www.cpyu.org/Page_p.aspx?id=76738 The Center for Parent/Youth Understanding - Destiny's Child: Pop Music Pied Pipers]</ref>.

The group later performed the song in front of Jackson for his thirtieth Anniversary concert, complete with their rendition of his dance moves. Before the premiere of the video on MTV's Making the Video, the girls dedicated the video to Michael Jackson.

The song popularised the portmanteau term 'bootylicious', a combination of the words [[booty]] and [[delicious]]. The success of the song came after the rise in media visibility of voluptuous 'non-skinny' personalities like [[Jennifer Lopez]] and later [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles|Beyonc<U+00E9>]]. There was a media perception that the appearance of these women corresponded to an appreciation of the supposedly neglected larger hips and thighs common in the figures of African-American, Hispanic and some Middle-Eastern women. The approving neologism 'bootylicious' has entered the mainstream English language<ref>[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA475536.html  bootylicious accepted by Oxford English Dictionary]</ref> as part of the 'crossover' of African-American popular culture, fashion and sexual politics.
