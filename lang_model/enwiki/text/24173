While Santiago initially made an impression with his offensive statistics, he soon became known for his defensive prowess, most notably for his strong throwing arm.<ref name="Mavbe They Ought To Call Him 'Shotgun' Santiago">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sjQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA41&dq=benito+santiago+baseball+digest&hl=en#v=onepage&q=benito%20santiago%20baseball%20digest&f=false |title=Mavbe They Ought To Call Him 'Shotgun' Santiago |author=Reinman, T.R. |publisher=Books.Google.com |date=December 1988 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=19 October 2011 }}</ref> Santiago was known for his ability to throw out would be [[Stolen base|base stealers]] from a kneeling position.<ref name="Mavbe They Ought To Call Him 'Shotgun' Santiago"/> In [[1988 San Diego Padres season|1988]], he led National League catchers in [[Assist (baseball)|assists]] and in baserunners [[caught stealing]] with a 45% average when the league average was 30%.<ref name="Mavbe They Ought To Call Him 'Shotgun' Santiago"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1988-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1988 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=19 October 2011 }}</ref> Although he still led the league's catchers with 12 errors, it was an improvement over the 22 he had committed the previous season.
