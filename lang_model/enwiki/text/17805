'''Mary Howitt''' (12 March 1799 <U+2013> 30 January 1888) was an English [[English poetry|poet]], and author of the famous poem ''[[The Spider and the Fly (poem)|The Spider and the Fly]]''. She was born '''Mary Botham''' at [[Coleford, Gloucestershire|Coleford]], in [[Gloucestershire]], the temporary residence of her parents, while her father, Samuel Botham, a prosperous [[Quaker]] of [[Uttoxeter]], Staffordshire, was looking after some mining property. Samuel had married his wife Ann in [[South Wales]] in 1796 when he was 38 and she was 32. They had four children Anna, Mary, Emma and Charles. Their [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]] house is now known as Howitt Place.<ref name=how/>

Mary Botham was educated at home, and read widely; she commenced writing verses at a very early age.<ref name=dnb/> Together with her husband she wrote over 180 books.<ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040490b.htm William Howitts entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography] accessed 4 October 2007</ref>

==Marriage==
On 16 April 1821 she was married in to William Howitt, and began a career of joint authorship with her husband. They lived initially in [[Heanor]] in Derbyshire where William was a pharmacist.<ref name=how>[http://www.maryhowitt.co.uk/profile.htm Mary Howitt site] accessed [[3 October 2007]]</ref> It was not until 1823, when they were living in [[Nottingham]], that William decided to give up his business with his brother [[Richard Howitt (poet)|Richard]] and concentrate with Mary on writing.<ref name=how/> Their literary productions at first consisted chiefly of poetical and other contributions to annuals and periodicals, of which a selection was published in 1827 under the title of ''The Desolation of [[Eyam]] and other Poems''.  

William and Mary mixed with many of the important literary figures of the day including [[Charles Dickens]], [[Elizabeth Gaskell]] and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]. In 1837 they went on a tour of the north and stayed with [[William Wordsworth|William and Dorothy Wordsworth]].<ref name=how/> Their work was well regarded, as can be seen from the minister [[George Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford|George Byng]]'s present in 1839 from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. She gave him a copy of Mary's book ''Hymns and Fireside Verses''.<ref name=how/> In the same year, her brother-in-law [[Godfrey Howitt]] set out with his wife and her family to emigrate to Australia, arriving at [[Port Phillip]] in April 1840.<ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040609b.htm Godfrey Howitt in Aust. Dict. of biography] accessed 3 October 2007</ref> The life of Mary Howitt was completely bound up with that of her husband; she was separated only from him during the period of his Australian journey (1851<U+2013>54). On removing to [[Esher]] in 1837 she commenced writing her well-known tales for children, a long series of books which met with signal success.<ref name=dnb/> They moved to London in 1843, and following a second move in 1844 they counted [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]] amongst their neighbours.<ref name=how/>

==Scandinavia==
While residing at [[Heidelberg]] in 1840, her attention was directed to [[Scandinavian literature]], and in company with her friend [[Madame Schoultz]], she set herself to learn [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]]. She afterward translated and introduced [[Fredrika Bremer]]'s novels (1842<U+2013>1863, 18 vols) to English readers. Howitt also translated many of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s tales, such as<ref name=dnb/> 
* Only a Fiddler (1845)
* The Improvisators (1845, 1847) {{Internet Archive|22503412.1462.emory.edu|1900 edition}}
* Wonderful Stories for Children (1846)
* The True Story of every Life (1847).<ref name=dnb/>

Among her original works were ''The Heir of West Way Ian'' (1847). She edited for three years the ''Drawing-room Scrap Book'', writing (among other articles included) "Biographical Sketches of the Queens of England". She edited the ''Pictorial Calendar of the Seasons'', translated Ennemoser's ''History of Magic'', and took the chief share in ''The Literature and Romance of Northern Europe'' (1852). She also produced a ''Popular History of the United States'' (2 vols. 1859), and a [[three-volume novel]] called ''The Cost of Caergwyn'' (1864).<ref name=dnb/>

In June 1852, the three male members of the family, accompanied by [[Edward La Trobe Bateman]], sailed for Australia in the hope of finding a fortune. William would be reunited with his brother [[Godfrey Howitt]], while Mary and her two daughters, the elder, Margaret, who had just returned from a year in Munich with Kaulbach (this adventure was later published as a book) moved into ''the Hermitage'', Mr Bateman's cottage in Highgate. This had previously been occupied by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]].<ref>[http://www.schulers.com/books/ge/l/Little_Memoirs_of_the_Nineteenth_Century/Little_Memoirs_of_the_Nineteenth_Century50.htm Little Memoirs of the Nineteenth Century ] accessed 3 October 2007</ref> However, they returned a number of years later. William wrote several books describing the [[Flora of Australia|flora]] and [[fauna of Australia]].<ref name=how/> Her son, [[Alfred William Howitt]], was to be renowned as an Australian explorer, [[anthropologist]] and [[naturalist]] and the discoverer of the remains of the explorers [[Burke and Wills]], which he brought to [[Melbourne]] for burial.

Other children included: Herbert Charlton Howitt, who was drowned while engineering a road in New Zealand; [[Anna Mary Howitt]], wife of Alfred Alaric Watts, the biographer of her father and author of ''An Art-Student in Munich'', who died on a visit to her mother in [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] in 1884;<ref>Anna Mary Howitt's ODNB entry: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/63040 Retrieved 9 July 2011]. Subscription required.</ref> and [[Margaret Howitt]], the writer of the ''Life of [[Fredrika Bremer]]'' and of the memoir of her own mother.<ref>William Howitt in the [[Dictionary of National Biography]]</ref>

Mary Howitt's name was attached as author, translator or editor to upwards of 110 works. She received a silver medal from the [[Literary Academy of Stockholm]], and on 21 April 1879 was awarded a civil list pension of [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]100. a year. In her declining years she joined the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and was one of an English deputation received by [[Pope Leo XIII]] on 10 January 1888. Her ''Reminiscences of my Later Life'' were printed in ''Good Words'' in 1886.  ''[[The Times]]'' says, speaking of the Howitts: 

<blockquote>Their friends used jokingly to call them William and Mary, and to maintain that they had been crowned together like their royal prototypes. Nothing that either of them wrote will live, but they were so industrious, so disinterested, so amiable, so devoted to the work of spreading good and innocent literature, that their names ought not to disappear unmourned.</blockquote>

Mary Howitt was away from her residence in [[Meran]] in Tyrol spending the winter in Rome when she died of [[bronchitis]] on 30 January 1888.<ref name=dnb/>

==The Spider and the Fly==
{{main|The Spider and the Fly (poem)}}

Mary Howitt's poem the "Spider and the Fly" was originally published in 1829. When [[Lewis Carroll]] was readying ''[[Alice's Adventures Under Ground]]'' for publication, he replaced a parody he had made of a negro minstrel song<ref>Gardner, Martin., The Annotated Alice, 1998</ref> with a parody of Mary's poem. The [[Lobster Quadrille]], which is an important part of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', is a parody of Mary's poem concerning a spider and a fly.<ref>[http://www.alice-in-wonderland.net/alice7a.html#5 Lewis Carroll's parody of Mary's poem] accessed 3 October 2007</ref>

The poem was a [[Caldecott Medal|Caldecott Honor Book]] in October 2003.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E3D91239F93BA15752C0A9659C8B63 Childrens Book awards announced. New York Times 6 October 2007] accessed 8 October 2007</ref>
