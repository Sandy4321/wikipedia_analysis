'''Group I catalytic introns''' are large self-splicing [[ribozymes]]. They catalyse their own excision from [[mRNA]], [[tRNA]] and [[rRNA]] precursors in a wide range of organisms.  The core [[secondary structure]] consists of 9 paired regions (P1-P9).  These fold to essentially two [[Protein domains|domain]]s - the P4-P6 domain (formed from the stacking of P5, P4, P6 and P6a helices) and the P3-P9 domain (formed from the P8, P3, P7 and P9 helices). The secondary structure mark-up for this family represents only this conserved core. Group I catalytic [[introns]] often have long [[open reading frame | ORFs]] inserted in [[Stem-loop|loop regions]]. 
==Catalysis==
[[Splicing (genetics)|Splicing]] of '''group I introns''' is processed by two sequential ester-transfer reactions. The exogenous guanosine or guanosine nucleotide (exoG) first docks onto the active G-binding site located in P7, and its 3'-OH is aligned to attack the phosphorester bond at the 5' splice site located in P1, resulting in a free 3'-OH group at the upstream exon and the exoG being attached to the 5' end of the intron. Then the terminal G (omega G) of the intron swaps the exoG and occupy the G-binding site to organize the second ester-transfer reaction, the 3' OH group of the upstream exon in P1 is aligned to attacks the 3' splice site in P10, leading to the ligation the adjacent upstream and downstream exons and free of the catalytic intron.

Two-metal-ion mechanism seen in protein [[polymerases]] and [[phosphatases]] was proposed to be used by group I and [[group II intron]]s to process the phosphoryl transfer reactions,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Steitz | first = TA | coauthors = Steitz JA | year = 1993 | title = A general two-metal-ion mechanism for catalytic RNA | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 90 | pages = 6498&ndash;6502 | id = PMID 8341661}}</ref> which was unambiguously proven by a recently resolved high-resolution structure of the Azoarcus group I intron.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Stahley | first = MR | coauthors = Strobel SA | year = 2006 | title = RNA splicing: group I intron crystal structures reveal the basis of splice site selection and metal ion catalysis | journal = Curr Opin Struct Biol | volume = 16 | pages = 319&ndash;326 | id = PMID 16697179}}</ref> 

==Intron Folding==
Since early 1990s, the community started to study how group I intron achieves its native structure in vitro, and some mechanisms of RNA [[Folding (chemistry)|folding]] has been appreciated thus far. It is agreed that the tertiary structure is folded after the formation of the secondary structure. During [[Folding (chemistry)|folding]], RNA molecules are rapidly populated into different folding intermediates, the intermediates containing native interactions are further folded into the native structure through a fast folding pathway, while those containing non-native interactions are trapped metastable or stable non-native conformations, and the process of conversion to the native structure occurs very slowly. It is evident that group I introns differing in the set of peripheral element display different potentials in entering the fast folding pathway. Meanwhile, cooperative assembly of the tertiary structure is important for folding of the native structure. Nevertheless, folding of group I introns in vitro encounters both thermodynamic and kinetic challenges. A few RNA binding proteins and chaperones have been shown to promote the folding of group I introns in vitro and in bacteria by stabilizing the native intermediates or structure, and by destabilizing the non-native structures, respectively.

==Distribution, Phylogeny and Mobility==
'''Group I introns''' are distributed in [[bacteria]], lower [[eukaryotes]] and higher 
[[plants]]. However, their occurrence in [[bacteria]] seems to be more sporadic than in lower 
[[eukaryotes]], and they have become prevalent in higher [[plants]]. The genes that group I 
introns interrupt differ significantly: They interrupt [[rRNA]], [[mRNA]] and [[tRNA]]
genes in [[bacteria]]l genomes, as well as in [[mitochondria]]l and [[chloroplast]]
genomes of lower [[eukaryotes]], but only invade [[rRNA]] genes in the nuclear genome of
lower [[eukaryotes]]. In higher [[plants]], these introns seem to be restricted to a few
[[tRNA]] and [[mRNA]] genes of the [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondria]]. Both intron-early
and intron-late theories have found evidences in explaining the origin of group I introns. 
Some group I introns encode [[Homing endonuclease#Homing endonuclease genes|homing 
endonuclease]] (HEG), which catalyzes intron mobility. It is proposed that HEGs move the 
intron from one location to another, from one organism to another and thus account for the
wide spreading of the selfish group I introns. No biological role has been
identified for group I introns thus far except for splicing of themselves from the precursor
to prevent the death of the host that they live by. A small number of group I introns are 
also found to encode a class of proteins called maturases that facilitate the intron 
splicing.
