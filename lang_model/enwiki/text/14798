[[FRP]] (Fiberglass Reinforced Plastics, also known as [[GRP]], or Glass Reinforced Plastics) is a modern [[composite]] material of construction for chemical plant equipment like tanks and vessels. Chemical equipment that range in size from less then a [[meter]] to 20 meters <ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VMX-4HKMRXD-11&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=a7ed112a4d299759cf2bbc8f717f2238]</ref> are fabricated using FRP as material of construction.

FRP Chemical Equipments are manufactured mainly by [[Glass-reinforced plastic#Fiberglass hand lay-up operation|Hand Lay-up]] and [[filament winding]] processes. [[BS4994]] still remains a key standard for this class of items.

===Dual Laminate=== 
Due to the [[corrosion]] resistant nature of FRP, the tank can be made entirely from the composite, or a second liner can be used. In either case, the inner liner is made using different material [[properties]] then the structural portion (Hence the name dual (meaning two) and laminate (a word commonly used for a layer of a composite material))

The liner, if made of FRP is usually resin rich and utilizes a different type of [[fiberglass|glass]], called "C-Glass", while the structural portion uses "E-Glass". The thermoplastic liner is usually 2.3 [[mm]] thick (100 [[mils]]). This thermoplastic liner is not considered to contribute mechanical strength. The FRP liner is usually cured before winding or lay-up continues, by using either a [[BPA]]/[[DMO]] system, or using an [[MEKP]] catalyst with [[cobalt]] in the [[resin]].

If the liner is not made of FRP, there are multiple choices for a thermoplastic liner. The [[engineer]] will need to design the tank based on the chemical corrosion requirement of the equipment. [[PP]], [[PVC]], [[PTFE]], [[ECTFE]], [[ETFE]], [[FEP]], [[CPVC]], [[PVDF]] are used as common thermoplastic liners.

Due to FRP's weakness to [[buckling]], but immense strength against [[tensile]] forces and its resistance to corrosion, a [[hydrostatic]] [[storage tank|tank]] is a logical application for the composite. The tank is designed to withstand the hydrostatic forces required by orienting the [[fiber]]s in the tangential direction.  This increases the [[hoop stress|hoop strength]], making the tanks [[anisotropic]]ally stronger then steel (pound per pound).

FRP which is constructed over the liner provides the structural strength requirements to withstand design conditions such as internal [[pressure]] or [[vacuum]], hydrostatic loads, [[seismic]] loads (including fluid sloshing), [[wind]] loads, [[regeneration]] hydrostatic loads, and even [[snow]] loads.

===Applications=== 
FRP tanks and vessels are widely used in the chemical industry in the following sectors: chlor-alkali manufacturers, fertilizer, wood pulp and paper, metal extraction, [[refining]], [[electroplating]], [[brine]], [[vinegar]], [[food processing]], and in air pollution control equipment, especially at [[municipal]] [[waste water treatment plants]] and [[water treatment|water treatment plants]].

===Types===
{{off-topic|Scrubber}}

FRP Vessels and Tanks are used in multiple applications, requiring a strong, corrosion resistant environment.

====Scrubbers====
FRP [[Scrubbers]] are used for scrubbing [[fluids]].  In air pollution control technology, scrubbers come in three varieties, Dry Media, Wet Media, and Biological.

=====Dry Media=====
Dry media typically involved [[activated carbon]], or [[aluminum oxide]].  These scrubbers control the [[concentration]] of a [[pollutant]] in the incoming gas via [[adsorption]] and [[absorption]].  The vessel needs to be designed to unload and reload the media constantly, and typically a [[redundant]] vessel is needed for this process.  The media can sometimes be [[regenerated]] and used again, either in a [[factory]] outside the vessel, or internally, using a water (or other fluid) wash down.  Due to the scrubbing capacity of the media being limited by the volume of the media, these vessels are mostly used for low pollutant concentration situations - especially as a [[polish]]er after a higher capacity stage.  However, dry media vessels have been used for [[emergency]] high concentration situations as a single use vessel (such as a monitoring system in a chemical storage warehouse to prevent [[toxic]] gasses from leaking to the environment - the moment a toxic gas is detected, a ventilation system turns on and pulls the toxic gas into the scrubber).

Dry media systems typically require a [[demister]] to remove incoming water [[droplets]] that may foul the media.  The vessel must be designed to remove this condensate, or else the vessel will [[flood]].

=====Wet Media=====
Wet media scrubbers typically douse the polluted fluid in a [[scrubbing]] solution.  These vessels must be designed to withstand the highly corrosive effects of both the polluted fluid and the scrubbing solution.  They usually have spray nozzles, internal support beams, and demisters and must be designed to withstand these relevant loads.  Also, located at the base of the vessel is enough room for a [[reservoir]] of scrubbing fluid, to allow for a recirculating pump to [[recycle]] the scrubbing solution.

In some cases, the scrubbing fluid can simply be water - the water will remove the pollutant from the air stream.  With enough water, the pollutant is simply [[dilute]]d to trace concentrations, and can be processed using other methods.

In the case of a ''decarbonator'', used in [[reverse osmosis]] systems to limit the concentration of gases in the water, the air is the scrubbing fluid and the sprayed liquid is the polluted stream.  As the water is sprayed out of the scrubber, the air strips the aqueous gasses out of the water, to be treated in another vessel.

=====Biological=====
Biological scrubbers are structurally identical to the wet media scrubbers, but vary in their design.  The vessel is designed to be larger, so the air moves slower through the vessel.  The media is designed to encourage biological growth, and the water that sprays through the vessel is filled with [[nutrients]] to encourage [[bacteria]] to grow.  In such scrubbers, the bacteria scrub the pollutant.  (See [[biofilter]] for similar technology that is usually preformed outside of an FRP vessel.)  

====Tanks====
A typical storage tank made of FRP has an inlet, an outlet, a vent, an [[manway|access port]], a drain, and an overflow nozzle.  However, there are other features that can be included in the tank.  [[Ladders]] on the outside allow for easy access to the roof for loading.  The vessel must be designed to withstand the load of someone standing on these ladders, and even withstand a person standing on the roof.  Sloped bottoms allow for easier draining.  [[Level]] [[gauges]] allow someone to accurately read the liquid level in the tank.  The vessel must be resistant to the corrosive nature of the fluid it contains.  Typically, these vessels have a secondary containment structure, in case the vessel bursts.

===Size=== 
The size of FRP Vessels is rarely limited by [[manufacturing]] technology, but rather by [[economics]].  Tanks smaller than 7,500 [[liter]]s (2,000 [[gallons]]) are easily manufactured out of cheaper materials, such as [[HDPE]] or PVC.  Tanks larger than four meters are generally limited by [[shipping]] constraints, and the economics suggest a [[concrete]] or [[steel]] tank fabricated at the tank's [[wiktionary:location|location]].

For [[chemical]] [[storage]] and [[air pollution control]], the choice is to make multiple tanks of smaller [[diameters]].  For example, one of the largest odor control projects in [[California]], the [[Orange County, CA|Orange County]] Sanitation District will utilize 24<ref>[http://www.cdm.com/NR/rdonlyres/BEDCE6CF-A0A6-4911-9FEA-952BF972BEF5/0/TheOrangeCountySanitationDistrictGoesforHighRateBiotowersinaBigWay.pdf] Page 12, Plant 2 Headworks Facility</ref> vessels total to treat 188,300 [[cfm]] (86,200 L/s) of odorous air, with a design of up to 50 [[ppm]] of [[hydrogen sulfide]]<ref>Carollo Engineers, Orange County Sanitation District Plant No. 2 Headworks Replacement (Job No. P2-66) Specification 11395D.1.3.A.3</ref>.  For an equivalent single vessel to perform as well as the 13 headworks [[trickling filter]]s, the single vessel would have to be over 36 feet in diameter.<ref>Since area must be maintained to keep velocity reduced, (Sqrt(13*(Pi/4)*10^2)/(Pi/4))=36.055 ft</ref>  This would be impractical due to the high shipping requirements, internal supports, [[spray nozzle]]s and other internals.  Plus this single vessel would not incorporate [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] for [[preventive maintenance]].

===Limitations=== 
Typical FRP [[temperature]] limits are almost entirely based on the resin.  The thermoplastic resin will suffer from [[creep (deformation)|creep]] at elevated temperatures and ultimately fail.  However, new [[chemistry]] has produced resins that claim to be able to achieve even higher temperatures, which expand this field immensely.  The typical maximum is 110 degrees [[celsius]].

===Design Standards=== 
GRP Tanks fall under regulation of several groups.

*[[Bs4994]]-87 is the [[British Standards]] Standard for FRP Tanks and Vessels
*[[ASME]] RTP-1 (Reinforced Thermoset Plastic Corrosion Resistant Equipment) is the standard for FRP tanks and vessels held within the [[United States]] under 15 [[psig]] and located partially or fully [[wiktionary:above|above]] [[ground]].  Typical [[design]] parameters and specifications will require either compliance with ASME RTP-1 or accreditation from ASME.
*[[ASTM]] 3299 governs the filament winding process for tanks.

====Bs4994==== 
It is to avoid the uncertainty associated with specifying the thickness alone, that BS4994 introduced the concept of "unit properties". It is property per unit width, per unit mass of reinforcement. For example, UNIT STRENGTH is defined as load in Newton per millimeter (of laminate width) for a layer consisting of 1 kg of glass per square meter. i.e. the unit is N/mm per Kg/m2 glass

====ASME RTP-1====
In RTP-1 specifications, the primary concerns relate [[stress]] and [[strain]], such as hoop stress, [[axial stress]], and breaking stress to the physical properties of the material, such as [[Young's modulus]] (which may require an anisotropic analysis due to the filament winding process).  These are related to the loads of the design, such as the internal [[pressure]] and [[strain]].
