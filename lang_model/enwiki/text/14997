This mechanism was invented by [[Chris Reeve]], and is called the Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L).<ref name ="SD1">{{Citation  | last = Dick  | first = Steven  | title = The Chris Reeve Sebenza Folding Hunter  | journal = National Knife Magazine  | volume =   | issue =   | pages = 16<U+2013>18  | publisher =   | location =   | date = 09/01/1993  | postscript = . }}</ref>  It is also commonly referred to as the Framelock, and is one of the most widely implemented locking systems in the folding knife industry, where lock strength and reliability is a product requirement.<ref>{{Citation |last=Delavigne|first=Kenneth|title=Spyderco Story: The New Shape of Sharp (Hardcover)|year= 2004|publisher=Paladin Press |location=Colorado |isbn=1-58160-060-7 |pages=312}}</ref>  The name '''Sebenza''' is derived from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word meaning "Work," a tribute to Mr. Reeve's South African origins.<ref name ="Covert"/>

== Design and history ==
[[File:Constrictor-Releasing.jpg|thumb|right|A small Sebenza cutting a knot]]

There are currently five models of the Sebenza:
* Small Regular - 2.94" blade (now only available as limited edition models)
* Large Regular - 3.625" blade (now only available as limited edition models)
* Small Classic - 2.94" blade (slightly updated version now called 21)
* Large Classic - 3.625" blade (slightly updated version now called 21)
* 25 - 3.625" blade

First introduced in 1990, the basic model has a sand-blasted titanium handle and a stonewashed finish [[CPM S30V steel]] blade.<ref name = "Gardner">

There are numerous options for the embellishment of the Sebenza's titanium handles, such as computer-generated graphics, custom (unique) graphics, or inlays such as exotic wood, micarta, or mammoth ivory.
Originally the Chris Reeve Sebenza was available with a blade of ATS-34 steel.<ref name ="Covert">{{Citation  | last = Covert  | first = Patrick  | title = Points Of Perfection  | journal = American Handgunner Magazine  | volume = 24  | issue = 5  | pages = 130  | date = Sept<U+2013>October 1999}}</ref>  
In 1996, the blade material was changed to BG-42 blade steel, and later in 2001, the Sebenza blade material transitioned to CPM S30V steel.  CPM S30V was developed by Crucible Steel with the collaboration of Chris Reeve.<ref name = "Gardner"/>  [[Damascus steel]] blades are also available as an option on the Sebenza. Since 2012, all Chris Reeve knives have transitioned to CPM S35VN steel.
A feature of the Sebenza that is highly praised by users is the ease of maintenance, as CRK actually encourages the customer to disassemble and maintain the knife by including a hex driver. Another feature of the Sebenza is the use of a bushing system around the blade's pivot that keeps the blade at a constant tight fit which is always centered.
This bushing allows the user to tighten the pivot screw completely without having to manually adjust the pivot tension.

As of May 2008, the two production models<U+2014>the Regular and Classic Sebenza models<U+2014>were discontinued and replaced by the 'Sebenza 21' (named so as to commemorate the 21st year of the Sebenza's production).  The Sebenza 21 is based upon the previous Classic's design, and differs from the Classic only in small details.

At the 2012 Blade Show the 'Sebenza 25' (named so as to commemorate the 25th year of the Sebenza's production) was introduced.  Significant changes include a more scuplted handle, the introduction of a ceramic ball lockup/detent system and the use of 'Large Hollow Grind Technology" on the blade grind.  The 21 model continues in production as well.
