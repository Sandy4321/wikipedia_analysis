"'''Closure'''" is the eleventh episode of the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]] of the [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[The X-Files]]'', and the 150th episode overall. The episode first aired in the United States and Canada on February 3, 2000 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]], and subsequently aired in the United Kingdom. It was written by executive producers [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] and [[Frank Spotnitz]], and directed by [[Kim Manners]]. The episode is the end of a two-parter and continues from the episode "[[Sein und Zeit (The X-Files)|Sein und Zeit]]". "Closure" earned a high Nielsen household rating of 9.1, being watched by 15.35 million people in its initial broadcast, and received mixed to positive reviews from critics.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In this episode, after Mulder is forced to accept that his mother<U+2019>s death was by her own hand, he is led by a man whose son disappeared years earlier to another truth<U+2014>that his sister may be among the souls taken by <U+2018>walk-ins<U+2019>, saving the souls of children doomed to live unhappy lives. Together, they embark on a journey that will reveal to Mulder the truth about his sister<U+2019>s disappearance.

"Closure" was a story milestone for the series, giving the final revelation of what really happened to [[Fox Mulder]]'s sister, [[Samantha Mulder|Samantha]]. The episode was written as a sequel to the previous episode, "Sein und Zeit," but branched off into different territory. Although a majority of the episode was filmed on a soundstage, several scenes were shot on locations, such as the scenes at Norton Air Force Base in [[San Bernardino, California]].

== Plot ==
Agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) aid the [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] Police in the investigation of a brutal murder committed by Scruloff, the owner of the Santa Village. As the remains of more children are discovered, he admits killing twenty-four children, but denies murdering Amber. Mulder is approached by [[psychic]] Harold Piller, who tells Mulder that he has helped law enforcement across the world, and has proved in various cases that children had been taken by "[[walk-ins]]". Piller believes that walk-ins save children who suffer terrible fates.

Scully becomes worried about Piller's influence over Mulder. The agents return to [[Washington, D.C.]], where Mulder keeps searching for evidence in the case. Meanwhile, Piller gets another vision of [[Samantha Mulder]], leading Mulder to April Air Force Base. Scully finds evidence that Samantha's disappearance is linked to the [[The Smoking Man]] ([[William B. Davis]]); when she returns to her apartment, she finds him waiting for her. He tells her that he had called off the search for Mulder's sister when she vanished because he knew she was dead.

When Mulder returns to April Air Force Base, he uncovers proof that Samantha lived with the Smoking Man along with his son, [[Jeffrey Spender]], and that she was forced to undergo painful tests. Scully finds a 1979 [[Report|police report]] of a girl matching Samantha's description, and learns that she was taken to a hospital emergency room. She and Mulder find the nurse who treated her, and the nurse describes how Samantha disappeared the same way as Amber<U+2014>without a trace. Mulder later walks through the forest and receives a vision of Samantha along with the spirits of other children. Upon telling Scully and Pillar (who reacts badly upon hearing that his son is dead) of his vision, Mulder accepts that his sister is dead and in a better place. When Scully comforts Mulder and asks if he is all right, he responds with a choked "I'm fine. I'm free."<ref name="plot"/>

===Writing===
"Closure," written by series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] and executive producer [[Frank Spotnitz]], brought an end to Mulder's quest for his sister, Samantha, who had been abducted when he was a child. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the shows producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Spotnitz explained that, "I think [series star, David Duchovny] grew tired of playing the man who is missing his sister. [...] I told him, 'This is going to be the last time you're going to have to play [that part].'"<ref name="s139"/> Paul Rabwin noted that, "It's been seven years. I don't think any of us are going to miss Samantha Mulder. That device and motivation were very strong strong in the early years of the show. But as the years have gone by, the speculation kind of melted away."<ref name="s139">Shapiro, p. 139</ref>

"Closure" continued the story of the previous episode "[[Sein und Zeit (The X-Files)|Sein und Zeit]]" and branched off into different territory. Carter later explained that, "emotionally, it was heavy stuff for everybody, but necessarily so. These episodes involved two very personal cases, the search for a serial killer [in 'Sein und Zeit'] and the search for Mulder's sister [in 'Closure']."<ref name="s139"/> Marc Shapiro, in his book ''All Things: The Office Guide to The X-Files, Vol. 6'' noted that, in addition to bring an end to the Samantha story arc, the episode was "very much a [Smoking Man] episode" in that it explored his involvement in Samantha's abduction and revealed to the audience that he was seriously ill. The episode's tagline was changed from the usual "The Truth is Out There" to "Believe to Understand".<ref name="s139"/>

===Filming===
''[[The X-Files]]'' crew had built two permanent stages, when shooting [[The X-Files (season 7)|season seven]] of the show. The stages were five and six at [[20th Century Fox]], and they used stage eight as their "swing set". The first scene was shot in [[Griffith Park]], above the playground. The first scene with the [[Walk-ins]] rising up from their grave was "tricky," according to director [[Kim Manners]].<ref name="Commentary"/> The children wouldn't cooperate if the crew told them to lay themselves in their "graves," so instead the crew called the holes in the ground "forts."<ref name="Commentary">{{cite video |people=[[Kim Manners|Manners, Kim]] |date=2000 |title=Audio Commentary for "Closure" |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

The scene at April Air Force Base was shot in [[San Bernardino, California]] at a closed [[airfield]], the former Norton Air Force Base. On the airbase was a large abandoned house complex built and used by the [[United States military]]. Originally, the producers wanted to name the fictitious air force March Force Base. However, the presence of an actual air force base with the same name necessitated a change to April Air Force Base. One of the shots in the April Air Force Base was filmed at a sound stage in [[Los Angeles]]. The scene at the [[restaurant]] was shot in a location on [[Sepulveda Boulevard]], at a [[hotel]] that had been standing there for 30 to 40 years.<ref name="Commentary"/>

"[[My Weakness]]", a song by [[Moby (musician)|Moby]] from his album, ''[[Play (Moby album)|Play]]'', is used in this episode, during the first scene when the FBI discover the mass grave and near the end when Mulder encounters his sister's spirit. Carter never told the series' resident composer [[Mark Snow]] about the decision to use someone else's music, although Snow has since said that his reaction to the use of the song was more positive than negative and that the song was a "perfect" fit for the scenes in which it can be heard.<ref name="I_Want_to_Believe">{{cite news|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/37203|title=ScoreKeeper With Composer Mark Snow About THE X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE, The Creation Of The Series' Theme, And Much More!! |publisher=Ain't It Cool |date=24 June 2008 ]|accessdate=1 August 2009}}</ref>

The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Kenneth Silber from [[Space.com]] was pleased with the episode, and wrote, "'Closure' is a satisfying episode, one that puts to bed the now-tiresome search for Mulder's sister Samantha."<ref>{{cite web|last=Silber|first=Kenneth|title=The X-Files - 'Closure'|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050207164359/http://space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_711_000214.html|publisher=Space.com|date=1 September 2000|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> Jeremy Conrad from [[IGN]] referred to the episode as "excellent" and noted that a large portion of ''The X-Files'' mythology ended with the resolution of Samantha's abduction, saying, "['Closure' is] a final, and concrete, answer to the single thing that was driving Mulder for the entire run of the series. In some ways, when he got that answer a major part of ''The X-Files'' story ended."<ref>{{cite web|last=Conrad|first=Jeremy|title=The X-Files: The Complete Seventh Season|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/401/401085p1.html|publisher=IGN|date=13 May 2003|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref> However, Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 3 out of 5 stars and wrote that "The payoff is just never quite as good as the buildup, and in this second of two parts, Chris Carter turns Mulder's search for the answers to his sister's disappearance into an ultimately hokey resolution that conveniently never really answers ALL the questions I had. Carter might call it closure, but I just call it anti-climactic."<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosell|first=Rich|title=The X-Files: The Complete Seventh Season|url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=4807|publisher=DigitallyObsessed|date=27 July 2003|accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref> Paula Vitaris from ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four.<ref name=cinepaula>{{cite journal|last=Vitaris|first=Paula|title=The X-Files Season Seven Episode Guide|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=October 2000|volume=32|issue=3|accessdate=29 March 2012|page=18-37}}</ref> She wrote, "Instead of a grand, breath-taking, heart-breaking finale that should be the climax of Mulder's search for Samantha, the story expires limply with some nonsense about Samantha being of the starlight children."<ref name=cinepaula/>
