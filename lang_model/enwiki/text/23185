{{Mafia}}

The '''Colombo crime family''' is the youngest of the "[[Five Families]]" that controls [[organized crime]] activities in [[New York City]], [[United States]], within the nationwide criminal phenomenon known as the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] (or Cosa Nostra). The family formerly known as the ''"Profaci crime family"'' was originally formed in 1928 by [[Joseph Profaci|Joseph "The Olive Oil King" Profaci]].<ref name ="Critchley, David">Critchley, David.

The ''first war'' took place during the late 1950s when [[Joe Gallo|Crazy Joe Gallo]] began revolting against his boss Joe Profaci for demanding too much tribute. The war began to lose momentum in the early 1960s, when Crazy Joe was arrested and boss Joe Profaci died of cancer. The family came together under [[Joseph Colombo|Joseph "Joe C." Colombo]]'s command. After some years the ''second family'' war began immediately after the release of Crazy Joe from prison he ordered the shooting of Colombo in 1971. The Colombo supporters led by [[Carmine Persico]] won the war when his side murdered Crazy Joe Gallo in a [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]] restaurant in 1972.

After two decades of peace the third and bloodiest war erupted in 1991 when [[Victor Orena]] undermined the imprisoned boss Carmine Persico. The family then split into two separate faction's one loyal to the boss Persico and others to Orena. The ''Persico faction'' attacked soldiers and capos who were supporting Orena and vice versa. In 1993 with twelve family members dead and Orena imprisoned the war was finally over. Since then, the family has been hit again and again by prosecutions, informants and convictions due to the third war. Recently the family turned to a resident of [[Massachusetts]], Ralph DeLeo, to run the family for Persico.

==History==
===Origins===
In September 1921, [[Joseph Profaci]] arrived in [[New York City]]. Months before he had decided to make the voyage to America, leaving behind his small town of [[Villabate]], [[Sicily]].<ref name ="Critchley, David" /> After some time of struggling in [[Chicago]] with his businesses he moved back to [[Brooklyn]] in 1925, becoming a well known olive oil importer. Profaci obtained his American citizenship on September 27, 1927.<ref name ="Critchley, David" /> With his olive oil importing business doing well he made deals with friends from his old town in Sicily and one of his largest buyers was [[Tampa]] mobster [[Trafficante crime family|Ignazio Italiano]]. He controlled his small gang of criminals that operated mainly in the borough of Brooklyn. The most dominate Cosa Nostra groups active in Brooklyn were led by [[Salvatore D'Aquila]], [[Frankie Yale]], [[Giuseppe Masseria]] and [[Bonanno crime family #Castellammarese War|Nicola Schiro]] (leader of the [[Bonanno crime family|Castellammarese Clan]]).

On July 1, 1928 Brooklyn mobster [[Frankie Yale]] was murdered by [[Chicago Outfit]]'s boss [[Al Capone]] hit-men.<ref name="Newton pg.408">Newton, Michael. "The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes." [http://books.google.com/books?id=gijG7fSwvjAC&pg=PA408&dq=al+capone+under+the+murder+of+Yale&hl=en&ei=g3zUTNXeOIKKlwfuhLGwBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=yale&f=false (pg.408)]</ref> Yale was murdered because he did not want to give Al Capone the control over the [[Unione Siciliana]].<ref name="Newton pg.408" /><ref>Nash, Jay Robert.

Months later on October 10, 1928 the ''[[capo di tutti capi]]'' [[Salvatore D'Aquila|Salvatore "Toto" D'Aquila]] was murder resulting in a dispute over who would take over D'Aquila's family.<ref name ="Critchley, David" /> In order to prevent a long and violent war in Brooklyn a mafia meeting was called. The meeting took place on December 5, 1928 in the [[Statler Hotel#List of hotels|Statler Hotel]] in Cleveland. The hotel was chosen in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] because it was under the [[Porrello crime family]] control and protection. The main topic discussed was the dividing of D'Aquila's territory.<ref name ="Critchley, David" /> At the meeting the mobster representing Brooklyn were Joseph Profaci, Joseph Magliocco (Profaci's second ), Vincent Mangano (who reported to disputable D'Aqulia family boss [[Alfred Mineo|Alfred "Al Mineo" Manfredi]]), [[Joseph Bonanno]] (represented [[Salvatore Maranzano]]), Chicago mobsters [[Joseph Guinta]], [[Pasquale Lolordo]] and Tampa mobster [[Trafficante crime family|Ignazio Italiano]] arrived to make a peace resolution.<ref name ="Critchley, David" /> As a result of Profaci's connections present at the meeting he received a fraction of D'Aqulia's Brooklyn territory.

===The Castellammarese War===
{{Main|Castellammarese War}}
Months after the D'Aquila murder, Joe Masseria began a campaign to become [[Capo di tutti capi]] (''Boss of Bosses'') in the United States demanding tribute from the remaining three mafia groups in New York City which included the [[Lucchese crime family|Reina family]], the [[Bonanno crime family|Castellammarese Clan]] and the ''Profaci family''. <ref name="Raab"> Raab, Selwyn. The Five Families: The Rise, Decline & Resurgence of America's Most Powerful Mafia Empire. New York: St. Martins Press, 2005.</ref> Masseria already had the support of the new D'Aquila family boss Alfred Manfredi. On February 26, 1930 Masseria ordered the murder of [[Gaetano Reina]] to make a point. This started the Castellammarese War, Masseria, and his allies Alfred Manfredi and new appointed Reina family boss [[Joseph Pinzolo]] fought Salvatore Maranzano and Joseph Profaci.<ref name="Raab"/>  The war would come to an end when [[Lucky Luciano|Charles "Lucky" Luciano]] a lieutenant for Masseria betrayed him and worked with Maranzano. The secret alliance between the two had Masseria killed on April 15, 1931.<ref name="Raab"/>  Maranzano then became the new Capo di tutti capi in the United States. Five months later on September 10, 1931 Luciano had Maranzano killed and created the [[The Commission (mafia)|Mafia Commission]]. Now there would be five independent Cosa Nostra families in New York City and twenty one additional families across the United States.<ref name="Raab"/>

===Gallo-Profaci War {1960-1964}===
Joseph Profaci had become a wealthy mafia boss and was known as "the olive-oil and tomato paste king of America".<ref name="New York Magazine">Cage, Nicholas. ''Part II The Mafia at War''. New York Magazine. July 17, 1972 [http://books.google.com/books?id=yuYCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27&dq=Joseph+Magliocco+kidnapped&hl=en&ei=FU8FTfeuAYKr8AbH07XpAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Joseph%20Magliocco%20kidnapped&f=false (pg.27-36)]</ref> One of Profaci's most unpopular demands was a $25 due from every soldier in his family. A powerful capo [[Frank Abbatemarco|Frank "Frankie Shots" Abbatemarco]] began refusing to pay Profaci's excessive demands for money. Frankie controlled a lucrative ''[[numbers game|policy game]]'' and Italian gangs (the ''Gallo brothers'' and the ''[[Garfield Boys]]'') operating in [[Red Hook, Brooklyn]].<ref name="New York Magazine" /> In 1959, Joseph Profaci ordered [[Joe Gallo]] to murder Frankie Abbatemarco, in return the Gallo's would take over the policy game.<ref name="Raab pg.321-324"> Raab, Selwyn.

On February 27, 1961 the Gallo's kidnapped four of Profaci's top men underboss [[Joseph Magliocco]], consigilere Frank Profaci (Joe Profaci's brother), capo Salvatore Mussachia and soldier John Scimone.<ref name="New York Magazine" /> While holding the hostages Joe Gallo was sent to [[California]] and his gang released the hostages peacefully. On August 20, 1961 Joseph Profaci ordered the murder of Gallo members, Joe Jelly (was murdered) the second target Larry Gallo survived his attack from Carmine Persico and Salvatore "Sally" D<U+2019>Ambrosio. The Gallo's then began calling Carmine ''"The Snake"'', he had betrayed them, the war continued on resulting in nine murders and three disappearances.<ref name="Raab pg.321-324" /> The war lost momentum when Crazy Joe Gallo was sentenced to seven-to-fourteen years for murder in late 1961.

A year later Joe Profaci passed away from cancer, leaving Joe Magliocco as the boss. The war continued on, Magliocco allied himself with [[Joseph Bonanno]] together they planned to murder bosses [[Carlo Gambino]], [[Tommy Lucchese]], [[Stefano Magaddino]] and [[Frank DeSimone]].<ref name="Life Magazine 1967">''The Mob: How Joe Bonanno Schemed to kill <U+2013> and lost''.

In 1964, Colombo acquired the help of the [[Patriarca crime family|New England family]] boss [[Raymond Patriarca]] who helped end the war.<ref name="New York Magazine" />

===The Colombo era===
{{More footnotes|date=April 2010}}
[[Image:Josephcolombo.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Joseph Colombo]] in police photo]]
With Gambino's blessing, Colombo became the new family boss. Gambino wanted to reward Colombo's loyalty and also figured that he could easily control him. To remove any association with the despised Profaci, the Profaci family was rechristened the Colombo family.

Colombo soon proved to be less pliable than Gambino expected. Following the arrest of his son on charges of debasing the currency, Colombo set up the [[Italian-American Civil Rights League]]. His stated aim was to  defend Italian Americans from "prejudice" at the hands of the law enforcement authorities. Because of the League, Colombo frequently appeared on television and met with the press. In an organization that prided itself on secrecy and keeping a low profile, Colombo's peers did not appreciate his publicity seeking activities.

In February 1971, Joey Gallo was released from prison and the Colombo family again descended into chaos. On June 28, 1971, at a League rally in Manhattan's [[Columbus Circle]], Colombo was shot as he pushed through the crowd to get to the stage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The shooter, a young African-American man called Jerome Johnson, was killed immediately by Colombo's entourage. Colombo survived the shooting, but was left in a [[vegetative state]]. Gallo was suspected of organizing the hit due to his ties with the African-American criminal fraternity of Harlem. Gallo believed an alliance with the Harlem group would present the mob with new opportunities, but few others in the families shared this belief. With Colombo permanently disabled, [[Vincenzo Aloi|Vincenzo "Vinny" Aloi]] became "acting boss" until [[Carmine Persico|Carmine "Junior" Persico]] was released from prison.

On April 7, 1972, Colombo shooters shot and killed Joey Gallo at Umberto's Clam House in Little Italy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The Gallo wars were finally over.

===The family under Persico===
Following the high-profile media exposure of Joseph Colombo and the murderous excesses of Joe Gallo, the Colombo family entered a period of comparative calm and stability. With Colombo in a coma, the family leadership went to Thomas DiBella, a man adept at evading the authorities since his sole bootlegging conviction in 1932. However, DiBella was unable to prevent the Gambino family from chipping away at Colombo rackets, and the Colombos declined in power.<ref name="mafianj.com">[http://www.mafianj.com/sci89/colombo.shtml "The Colombo/Persico/Orena Family"] La Cosa Nostra <U+2013> State of New Jersey Commission of Investigation 1989 Report</ref> Poor health forced DiBella to retire in 1977, and Colombo died in 1978. The Colombo family was facing another power vacuum.

During the 1970s, [[Carmine Persico]] had grown in stature within the family and was considered to be the clear successor as boss. However, Persico had spent much of this time in prison, and it was unclear if he could effectively rule the family from prison. Nevertheless, Persico took control, designating [[Gennaro Langella|Gennaro "Jerry Lang" Langella]] as his street boss. In 1986, both men were convicted on massive [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) charges and were sentenced to 100 years. In 1988, Persico named [[Victor Orena]] as the new acting boss.

===Third Colombo war===
Orena, an ambitious capo from [[Cedarhurst]] was not content with being acting boss to Persico. In 1990, using his strong ties to Gambino boss [[John Gotti]], Orena petitioned the Mafia Commission to declare him the official boss of the Colombo family. Unwilling to cause more conflict, the Commission refused. On June 21, 1991, an enraged Persico sent gunmen under the leadership of [[Carmine Sessa]] to murder Orena at his house. However, Orena managed to escape before the gunmen could strike. The third Colombo war had begun.<ref name="mafianj.com"/>

While both sides appealed to the Commission for help, the war continued. On November 1991, [[Gregory Scarpa Sr.]], a Persico loyalist, was driving his daughter and granddaughter home when several Orena gunmen ambushed them. Scarpa and his relatives managed to escape. The war continued until 1992, when law enforcement imprisoned Orena and most of his loyalists.

Twelve people, including three innocent bystanders, died in this gang war.<ref>[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/colombo/7.html "The Colombo Family: Junior's War"] By Anthony Bruno TruTV Crime Library</ref> More than 80 made members and associates from both sides of the Colombo family were convicted, jailed or indicted. These included Persico's brother [[Theodore Persico|Theodore "Teddy" Persico]] and his son Alphonse Persico, DeRoss, and Orena's two sons, Victor Jr. Orena and John Orena.

While the Colombo war raged, the Commission refused to allow any Colombo member to sit on the Commission{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} and considered dissolving the family and splitting its manpower and resources among the remaining families.<ref>Destefano, Anthony.

===Current leadership===
[[File:Alphonse Persico.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Carmine Persico's son, Alphonse.]]
[[Carmine Persico|Carmine "Junior" Persico]], at age 76, allegedly remains boss of the much-weakened Colombo family. He is serving a life sentence in a federal prison in [[North Carolina]]. Persico had designated his son [[Alphonse Persico|Alphonse "Little Allie Boy" Persico]] as his successor. However, in December 2007, Alphonse Persico and [[Underboss]] [[John DeRoss|John "Jackie" DeRoss]] were convicted of ordering the 1999 killing of [[William Cutolo]] and were sentenced to life in prison.

[[John Franzese|John "Sonny" Franzese]], 92 years old and a bitter Persico enemy, is allegedly underboss. Franzese has spent much of his life in prison and is under tight parole restrictions, but has still assumed a top spot in the family. In May 2007, Franzese was arrested on parole violation charges stemming from meetings with Colombo caporegimes and high ranking members of other crime families. Franzese was released from jail in 2008.

[[Andrew Russo (mobster)|Andrew "Andy Mush" Russo]], longtime capo and former street boss, assumed the role of acting boss after the 2008 arrest of Thomas Gioeli.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/nyregion/19indict.html?_r=1&scp=3&sq=Thomas%20Gioeli&st=cse "11 Years After Officer<U+2019>s Slaying, Reputed Mob Figures Are Indicted"] By MICHAEL WILSON and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM New York Times December 18, 2008</ref> [[Vincenzo Aloi|Vincenzo "Vinny" Aloi]] is said to be the current Colombo [[Consigliere]]. He is currently living in Florida and considered to be semi-retired.

In June 2008, acting boss [[Thomas Gioeli|Thomas "Tommy Shots" Gioeli]], underboss [[John Franzese|John "Sonny" Franzese]], former consigliere [[Joel Cacace|Joel "Joe Waverly" Cacace]], captain Dino Calabro, mob soldier Dino Saracino and several members and associates were indicted on multiple [[racketeering]] charges. These charges included drug trafficking, loan sharking, extortion and three murders dating back to the Colombo Wars. As of October 2010, Gioeli is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. If convicted, he faces life in prison. On December 24, 2008, Franzese was released from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. However he is still under indictment and is scheduled to go on trial sometime in 2009 along with Gioeli and Calabro.<ref>[http://newyork.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel08/organizedcrime060408.htm "COLOMBO ORGANIZED CRIME FAMILY ACTING BOSS, UNDERBOSS, AND TEN OTHER MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES INDICTED"] Department of Justice Press Release</ref> If convicted, they are all facing [[life sentence]]s.

On December 17, 2009, the FBI charged members of the Colombo family with allegedly engaging in drug trafficking, extortion and loansharking. The crew was operating in Massachusetts, Arkansas, Rhode Island, New York and Florida. The leader of the crew is the current "Street Boss", Ralph F. DeLeo. He grabbed a piece of territory in Boston for the family. As the new street boss, DeLeo is not a New York City based mobster. He met Alphonse Persico in prison in the early 1990s and when he was released he became a made member in the family. DeLeo became street boss after the Gioeli arrest in 2008.<ref name="boston.com">[http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2009/12/four_charged_wi.html "Four charged with membership in Mafia-connected crew"] Boston.com December 17, 2009</ref><ref>[http://crimefamily.info/colombo-family-street-boss-indicted "Colombo Family Street Boss Indicted"] Crime Family - Boston.com December 19, 2009</ref><ref name="Marzulli 2009">[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2009/12/18/2009-12-18_new_colombo_brass_is_from_mass.html "Colombo crime family boss Ralph DeLeo indicted on racketeering charges"] BY John Marzulli New York Daily News December 18, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/17/fbi_alleges_crime_boss_deleo_ran_crew_in_greater_boston/ "FBI alleges <U+2018>crime boss<U+2019> DeLeo ran crew in Greater Boston"] By Shelley Murphy Boston.com Globe January 17, 2010</ref>
