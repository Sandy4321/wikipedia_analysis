The '''City and County of San Francisco''' is the fourth most populous city in [[California]] and the [[List of United States cities by population|fourteenth-most populous]] in the [[United States]], with a 2005 population of 739,426.<ref name="SFQuickFacts">[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/06075.html State & County QuickFacts: San Francisco County, California.] U.S. Census Bureau.

In 1776, the Spanish [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|settled]] the tip of the San Francisco peninsula, establishing a [[Presidio of San Francisco|fort]] at the [[Golden Gate]] and a [[Mission San Francisco de As<U+00ED>s|mission]] named for [[Francis of Assisi]]. The [[California Gold Rush]] in 1848, propelled the city into a period of rapid growth. After being devastated by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake and fire]], San Francisco was quickly rebuilt.

San Francisco is renowned for its often chilly summer fog, steep rolling hills, an eclectic mix of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[modern architecture]], and its peninsular location surrounded on three sides by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[San Francisco Bay]]. Famous hallmarks and landmarks include the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], [[Alcatraz Island]], the [[San Francisco cable car system|cable car]]s, the [[Transamerica Pyramid]], [[Coit Tower]], and [[Chinatown, San Francisco, California|Chinatown]].

[[Entrepreneur]]s sought to capitalize on the wealth generated by the Gold Rush. Early winners were the [[banking]] industry, which saw the founding of [[Wells Fargo]] in 1852, and the [[railroad]] industry, as the [[business magnate|magnate]]s of [[the Big Four]], led by [[Leland Stanford]], collaborated in the building of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The development of the [[Port of San Francisco]] established the city as a center of [[trade]]. Catering to the needs and tastes of the growing population, [[Levi Strauss]] opened a dry goods business and [[Domingo Ghirardelli]] began manufacturing [[chocolate]]. Immigrant laborers made the city a polyglot culture, with [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] railroad workers creating the city's [[Chinatown, San Francisco, California|Chinatown]] quarter. The first [[San Francisco cable car system|cable cars]] carried San Franciscans up [[Clay Street Hill Railroad|Clay Street]] in 1873. The city's sea of [[Victorian house]]s began to take shape, and civic leaders campaigned for a spacious public park, resulting in plans for [[Golden Gate Park]].

The 1989 [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] caused destruction and loss of life throughout the Bay Area.

San Francisco is located on the [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] of the U.S. at the tip of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] and includes significant stretches of the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[San Francisco Bay]] within its boundaries. Several [[islands of San Francisco Bay|islands]] are part of the city, notably [[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]], [[Treasure Island, California|Treasure Island]], and the adjacent [[Yerba Buena Island]]. Also included are the uninhabited [[Farallon Islands]], 27 [[mile]]s (43&nbsp;km) offshore in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The land within the city limits roughly forms a seven by seven mile square, which has become a colloquialism referring to the city's shape. 

[[Image:San Francisco Landsat7 (Lg).jpg|265px|right|thumb|The San Francisco Peninsula: San Francisco and, below it, northern [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]]]]
San Francisco is famous for its hills, which are defined as elevations over 100 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] (30&nbsp;m). There are a total of [[List of San Francisco, California Hills|43 hills]] within city limits.<ref>{{cite book

[[Image:Lombardst.jpeg|thumb|left|Cars negotiate [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]] to descend [[Russian Hill, San Francisco, California|Russian Hill]]]]
Near the geographic center of the city, southwest of the downtown area, are a series of less densely populated hills. Dominating this area is [[Mount Sutro]], the site of [[Sutro Tower]], a large red and white radio and television transmission tower. Nearby is [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco)|Twin Peaks]], a pair of hills resting at one of the city's highest points and a popular overlook spot for tour groups. San Francisco's tallest hill, [[Mount Davidson]], is 925 feet (282&nbsp;m) high, and is capped with a 103 feet (31.4&nbsp;m) tall cross built in 1934.

The [[San Andreas Fault|San Andreas]] and [[Hayward Fault|Hayward]] Faults are responsible for much [[earthquake]] activity, even though neither passes through the city itself. It was the San Andreas Fault which slipped and caused the earthquakes in 1906 and 1989. Minor [[earthquakes]] occur on a regular basis. The threat of major earthquakes plays a large role in the city's infrastructure development. New buildings must meet high structural standards, and older buildings and bridges must be retrofitted to comply with new building codes. 

San Francisco's shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits. Entire neighborhoods such as the [[Marina District, San Francisco, California|Marina]] and [[Hunters Point]], as well as large sections of the [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]] sit on areas of [[landfill]]. [[Treasure Island, California|Treasure Island]] was constructed from material dredged from the bay as well as material resulting from tunneling through Yerba Buena Island during the construction of the Bay Bridge. Such land tends to be unstable during earthquakes; the resultant [[liquefaction]] causes extensive damage to property built upon it, as was evidenced in the Marina district during the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake.

The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighborhoods, in late spring, and during September and October, which are the warmest months of the year.

[[Image:SF_Chinatown_CA.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Chinatown, San Francisco, California|Chinatown]]]]
{{main|Neighborhoods in San Francisco, California}}
The historic center of San Francisco is the northeast quadrant of the city bordered by [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] to the south. It is here that the [[Financial District, San Francisco, California|Financial District]] is centered, with [[Union Square (San Francisco)|Union Square]], the principal shopping and hotel district, nearby. [[Cable car (railway)|Cable car]]s carry residents and tourists alike up steep inclines to the summit of [[Nob Hill]], once the home of the city's business tycoons, and down to [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, California|Fisherman's Wharf]], a tourist playground featuring [[Dungeness crab]] from a still-active fishing industry. Also in this quadrant are [[Russian Hill, San Francisco, California|Russian Hill]], a residential neighborhood with the famously crooked [[Lombard Street, San Francisco|Lombard Street]], [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]], the city's version of [[Little Italy]], and [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]], which features [[Coit Tower]], a landmark dedicated to San Francisco's firefighters. Nearby is San Francisco's [[Chinatown, San Francisco, California|Chinatown]], established in the 1860s. The [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] is often portrayed as the crime-infested underbelly of the city.

The [[Mission District, San Francisco, California|Mission District]] is predominantly working-class and populated by immigrants from [[Mexican American|Mexico]] and Central America, but is also gentrifying.  [[Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco, California|Haight-Ashbury]], though heavily gentrified, still has some [[bohemian]] character. The [[The Castro, San Francisco, California|Castro]] is the center of gay life in the city.

[[Image:Balmy Alley Mission SF2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A [[mural]] in the [[Mission District, San Francisco, California|Mission District]]]]The city's [[Japantown, San Francisco, California|Japantown]] district suffered when its [[Japanese American|residents]] were [[Japanese American internment|forcibly removed]] during the second world war, while the nearby [[Western Addition, San Francisco, California|Western Addition]] became established with a large [[African American]] population at the same time. The "[[Painted Ladies]]", a row of well-restored [[Victorian house|Victorian]] homes, stand alongside [[Alamo Square]], and the mansions built by the San Francisco business elite in the wake of the [[1906 San Francisco Earthquake|1906 earthquake]] can be found in [[Pacific Heights, San Francisco, California|Pacific Heights]]. The [[Marina District, San Francisco, California|Marina]] to the north is a lively area with many young urban professionals.
The [[Richmond District, San Francisco, California|Richmond]], the vast region north of Golden Gate Park that extends to the Pacific Ocean, today has a portion called "New Chinatown", but also attracts immigrants from other parts of Asia and [[Russian people|Russia]]. South of Golden Gate Park lies the [[Sunset District, San Francisco, California|Sunset]] with an Asian majority population.<ref>Chow, Andrew (March 22, 2002). [http://www.asianweek.com/2002_03_22/bay_redistricting.html Dismal APA Turnout at First Redistricting Meetings] ''Asian Week''. Accessed September 3, 2006.</ref> The Richmond and the Sunset are largely middle class and, together, are known as [[Neighborhoods of San Francisco|The Avenues]].  [[Bayview-Hunter's Point]] in the southeast section of the city is one of the poorest neighborhoods and suffers from a high rate of crime, though the area has been the focus of plans for urban renewal.  The other southern neighborhoods of the city are ethnically diverse and populated primarily with students and working-class San Franciscans.

The [[South of Market]], once filled with decaying remnants of San Francisco's industrial past, has seen significant redevelopment. The locus of the [[dot-com boom]] during the late 1990s, [[List of tallest buildings in San Francisco|by 2004 South of Market began to see]] [[skyscrapers]] and [[condominium]]s [[Manhattanization|dot the area]]. Following the success of nearby [[South Beach, San Francisco, California|South Beach]], another neighborhood, [[Mission Bay, San Francisco, California|Mission Bay]], underwent redevelopment, anchored by a second campus of [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]].

{{main|Parks in San Francisco, California}}
[[Ocean Beach (San Francisco)|Ocean Beach]] runs along the Pacific Ocean shoreline, but is not suitable for swimming because the waters off the coast are cold and have deadly [[rip currents]].  [[Baker Beach]] occupies a picturesque setting just west of the Golden Gate Bridge and is where one of the only existing colonies of ''[[Hesperolinon congestum]]'', the threatened Marin Dwarf Flax, can be found.  The biggest and most well-known park is [[Golden Gate Park]], stretching from the center of the city to the [[Pacific Ocean]].  Once covered only in grass and sand dunes, the park is planted with thousands of non-native trees and plants and is rich with attractions including the [[Conservatory of Flowers]], the [[Japanese tea garden at Golden Gate Park|Japanese Tea Garden]], and [[Strybing Arboretum]]. [[Presidio of San Francisco|The Presidio]], a former military base, and its [[Crissy Field]] section, restored to its natural salt marsh condition, are part of the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]], which includes Alcatraz, and other regional parks. [[Buena Vista Park]] is the city's oldest, established in 1867. [[Lake Merced]] is a [[fresh-water]] lake surrounded by parkland.

{{seealso|Government of San Francisco}}
The City and County of San Francisco is a [[consolidated city-county]], a status it has had since 1856. It is the only such consolidation in California. The [[Mayor of San Francisco|mayor]] is also the county executive and the county [[board of supervisors]] acts as the [[city council]]. Because of its unique status, it exercises jurisdiction over property that would otherwise be located outside of its corporation limit. [[San Francisco International Airport]], though located in [[San Mateo County]], is owned and operated by the City and County of San Francisco. San Francisco was also granted a perpetual leasehold over the [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]] and [[drainage basin|watershed]] in [[Yosemite National Park]] by the [[Raker Act]] in 1913.

[[Image:Sfcityhall.jpeg|thumb|left|280px|[[San Francisco City Hall]]]]

Under the city charter, the government of San Francisco is constituted of two co-equal branches. The executive branch is headed by the mayor and includes other city-wide elected and appointed officials, and the civil service. The 11-member [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors|Board of Supervisors]], the legislative branch, is headed by a President ([[Aaron Peskin]], as of 2006) and is responsible for passing laws and budgets, though San Franciscans also make use of [[Initiative|direct ballot initiatives]] to pass legislation. The members of the Board of Supervisors are elected as representatives of specific districts within the city.<ref name="SF_Gov_Supervisor_Districts">{{cite web | title=Board of Supervisors District Information | url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/bdsupvrs_index.asp?id=4385 | publisher = City and County of San Francisco, Board of Supervisors | accessmonthday=January 29 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> If the mayor dies or resigns, the President of the Board of Supervisors assumes the office, as [[Dianne Feinstein]] did after the assassination of [[George Moscone]] in 1978.

The federal government utilizes San Francisco as the regional hub for many arms of the federal bureaucracy, including the [[Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]], the [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|Federal Reserve Bank]], and the [[United States Mint]]. Until decommissioning in the early 1990s, the city had three major military installations - the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]], [[Treasure Island, California|Treasure Island]], and [[San Francisco Naval Shipyard|Hunters Point]] - a legacy still reflected in the annual celebration of ''[[Fleet Week]]''. The State of California uses San Francisco as the home of the state [[Supreme Court of California|Supreme Court]] and other state agencies. Foreign governments have located in excess of thirty foreign [[consulate]]s in San Francisco.<ref>[http://www.yellowpages.com/sp/yellowpages/ypresults.jsp?t=0&v=3&s=2&p=1&q=Consulates&ci=san+francisco&st=CA&q=Consulates Search for consulates in San Francisco, CA] Yellowpages.com, Accessed August 27, 2006.</ref>

===Roads and highways===

Because of its unique geography &mdash; making [[beltway]]s somewhat impractical &mdash; and the results of the [[freeway revolt]]s of the late 1950s, San Francisco is one of the few cities in the U.S. that has opted for European-style [[arterial thoroughfares]] instead of a large network of [[freeways]]. City residents continued this trend following the 1989 [[Loma Prieta Earthquake]], choosing to demolish the [[Embarcadero Freeway]] and a portion of the [[Central Freeway]] and convert them into street-level boulevards.

[[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]] begins at the approach to the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] and is the only direct automobile link to the East Bay. [[U.S. Highway 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] extends Interstate 80 to the south along the San Francisco Bay toward [[Silicon Valley]]. Northbound, 101 uses arterial streets [[List of streets in San Francisco|Van Ness Avenue]] and [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]] to the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], the only direct road access from San Francisco to [[Marin County]] and points north. [[California State Route 1|Highway 1]] also enters San Francisco at the Golden Gate Bridge, but diverts away from 101, bisecting the west side of the city as the [[List of streets in San Francisco|19th Avenue]] arterial thoroughfare, and joining with [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]] at the city's southern border. Interstate 280 continues this route along the central portion of the Peninsula south to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. Northbound, 280 turns north and east and terminates in the South of Market area. [[California State Route 35|Highway 35]], which traverses the majority of the Peninsula along the ridge of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], enters the city from the south as [[Skyline Boulevard]], following city streets until it terminates at its intersection with Highway 1.  Major east-west thoroughfares include [[Geary Boulevard]], the [[List of streets in San Francisco|Lincoln Way]]/[[List of streets in San Francisco|Fell Street]] corridor, and [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]]/[[List of streets in San Francisco|Portola Drive]].

[[Image:Cable Car.jpg|thumb|225px|left|A [[San Francisco cable car system|cable car]] descending [[Nob Hill]]]][[Public transit]] solely within the city of San Francisco is provided predominantly by the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] (Muni). The city-owned system operates both a combined light rail/subway system (the [[Muni Metro]]) and a bus network that includes both [[trolleybus]]es and standard diesel buses. Additionally, Muni runs the [[F Market|F Market historic streetcar line]] and the iconic [[San Francisco cable car system]].

Commuter rail is provided by two complementary agencies. [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BART) is the regional rapid transit system which connects San Francisco with the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] through the [[Transbay Tube]]. It also extends south of the city through northern [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]], to the [[San Francisco International Airport]], and [[Millbrae, California|Millbrae]].  The [[Caltrain]] rail system runs from San Francisco along the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] down to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

The [[Transbay Terminal]] serves as the terminus for long range bus service (such as [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]]) and as a hub for regional bus systems [[AC Transit]] (to [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]]), [[SamTrans]] (San Mateo County), and [[Golden Gate Transit]] (Marin and [[Sonoma County|Sonoma Counties]]). [[Amtrak]] also runs a shuttle bus from San Francisco to its rail station in [[Emeryville (Amtrak station)|Emeryville]].

A small fleet of commuter and tourist [[ferries]] operate from the [[Ferry Building]] and [[Pier 39]] to points in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], and north to [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] in [[Solano County, California|Solano County]].

{{main|Port of San Francisco}}
The [[Port of San Francisco]] was once the largest and busiest seaport on the west coast. It featured rows of [[piers]] perpendicular to the shore, where cargo from the moored ships was handled by cranes and manual labor and transported to nearby warehouses. The port handled cargo to and from trans-Pacific and Atlantic destinations, and was the west coast center of the [[West coast lumber trade|lumber trade]]. The [[1934 West Coast Longshore Strike]], an important episode in the history of the [[Labor unions in the United States|American labor movement]], brought the port to a standstill. The advent of [[container shipping]] made pier-based ports obsolete and most commercial berths moved to the [[Port of Oakland]].

Many piers remained derelict for years until the demolition of the [[Embarcadero Freeway]] reopened the downtown waterfront, allowing for redevelopment. The centerpiece of the port, the [[Ferry Building]], while still receiving [[ferry|commuter ferry]] traffic, has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace. The port's other activities now focus on developing waterside assets to support recreation and tourism.
