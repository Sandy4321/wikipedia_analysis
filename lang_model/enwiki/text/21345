'''Sydney Rovers Football Club'''<ref>"http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/113959,sydney-rovers--official.aspx" Sydney Rovers...Its Official!</ref> was a proposed professional [[association football|football (soccer)]] club based in Western [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] and the 12th official franchise in the [[A-League]].<ref>"http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/113724,western-sydney-club-for-2011.aspx" FFA Okay West Sydney For 2011</ref><ref>"http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/113733,all-there-is-to-know-on-the-new-sydney-side.aspx" All There Is To Know On The New Sydney Side</ref> The club was supposed to kick off in the 2011-2012 season.<ref> http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/183077,lowy-set-to-ditch-rovers.aspx Lowy Set To Ditch Rovers</ref><ref>http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/snubbed-a-league-syndicate-ready-to-save-ffa/story-e6frg7mf-1225925053805 Snubbed A-League syndicate ready to 'save' FFA </ref> 

Led by businessman Ian Rowden, the bid for a new Sydney team in the A-League received the rights for the league's 12th licence in September 2009. Rowden's group was awarded the license to join the A-League's 2011-12 season on 29 September 2009. After many months of delays and scruntiny, the Sydney Rovers bid was declined entry into the 2011-12 A-league season, making way for a more financial and technically sound bid.<ref> http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/191086,sydney-rovers-scrapped.aspx Sydney Rovers Scrapped </ref>

==Badge and colours==
The club badge features a traditional shield-like design divided vertically into three bars of red, white and black. Three white stars outlined in black form a triangle in the chief of the shield, with the top star lying partly outside it. These stars are said to represent the north, west and south of [[Sydney]]. 

Underneath these are written the word ''Sydney'' in black. Below this, a banner across the centre of the shield has the word ''Rovers''. In the base of the shield is written ''FC'' in red, directly underneath which is a traditional black and white football. The Rovers' colour scheme, based on the club's badge, is to be red, white and black.

==Kit==
The club's prototype kit was announced on February 19. It is a tri colour, consisting of red white and black thirds - similar to the club's badge, and the [[St Kilda Football Club]] in the [[Australian Football League|AFL]].<ref>http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/122883,sydney-rovers-the-kits.aspx</ref>

==Stadium==
It was undecided where the club would play home games but [[Parramatta Stadium]] and [[Penrith Stadium]] were the main grounds the club was looking at, with Parramatta being the favoured choice of fans. The club also suggested that home games be alternated between Parramatta and Penrith to appeal to a wide range of fans across [[Western Sydney]]. 

On 5 July 2010 it was confirmed that [[Parramatta Stadium]], [[Sydney Showground Stadium]], [[CUA Stadium]] and [[Campbelltown Stadium]] were bidding to be Sydney Rovers' home ground for the inaugural season in 2011-2012 with [[ANZ Stadium]] confirming they are only bidding for a handful or marquee games. <ref>http://parramatta-advertiser.whereilive.com.au/sport/story/parramatta-stadium-bid-for-sydney-rovers-a-league-team/</ref>
