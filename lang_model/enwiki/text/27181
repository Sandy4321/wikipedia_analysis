'''Pallywood''', a [[portmanteau]] of "[[Palestinian]]" and "[[Hollywood]]", is a [[neologism]] that, according to the [[Jerusalem Post]], is used by pro-Israel media-watchdog advocates<ref name="jp071012">[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1191257284722&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter 'Caught in the Mohammad al-Dura crossfire], by Calev Ben-David, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', [[October 12]] [[2007]]:<br/>: ''But pro-Israel media-watchdog advocates have gone further, arguing that the footage is a prime example of what has been dubbed "Pallywood" - media manipulation, distortion and outright fraud by the Palestinians (and other Arabs, such as the Reuters photographer caught faking photos during the Second Lebanon War), designed to win the public relations war against Israel.''</ref> to describe "media manipulation, distortion and outright fraud by the Palestinians and other Arabs ... designed to win the public relations war against Israel."<ref name="jp071012" /> Among the claimed incidents are the [[Muhammad al-Durrah]] tapes and the [[2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies]] (dubbed 'Hezbollywood').<ref name="jp071012" />

The term has been publicized in part by [[Boston University]] professor [[Richard Landes]], as a result of an online documentary video he produced called ''Pallywood: According to Palestinian Sources'', highlighting specific instances of alleged media manipulation.<ref name=Cambanis>Cambanis, Thanassis.

In 2005, Professor Richard Landes of Boston University produced an 18-minute online documentary video called ''Pallywood: According to Palestinian Sources''.<ref name=Carvajal>Carvajal, Doreen. [http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/02/07/video07_ed3_.php "The mysteries and passions of an iconic video frame"], ''International Herald Tribune'', Monday, [[February 7]] [[2005]].</ref> Landes and other pro-Israel advocates argue that the Israeli government is insufficiently robust in countering Palestinian accounts of events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<ref name="jp071012" />

In his video, Landes shows Arab-Israeli conflict-related footage that was taken mostly by freelance Palestinian video journalists. He  argues that systematic media manipulation (which he dubs "Pallywood") dates back to at least the [[1982 Lebanon War]], and argues that broadcasters are too uncritical of the veracity of Palestinian freelance footage.<ref name=history>Landes, Richard. [http://www.seconddraft.org/history_pallywood.php "Pallywood: History"], SecondDraft.org.</ref> He focuses in particular on the case of [[Muhammad al-Durrah]], a 12-year-old Palestinian who was widely reported to have been killed by Israeli gunfire in the [[Gaza Strip]] on [[September 30]] [[2000]] at the beginning of the [[Second Intifada]]. The shooting was filmed by a Palestinian freelance cameraman and aired on the [[France 2]] television channel with narration by the veteran French-Israeli journalist [[Charles Enderlin]], who was not present at the incident. It made worldwide headlines and the conduct of the [[Israel Defence Forces]] was heavily criticized internationally, severely damaging Israel's public standing on the world stage.<ref name="jp071012" /> Landes questions the authenticity of the footage and disputes whether al-Durrah was killed at all, arguing that the entire incident was staged by the Palestinians.<ref name=SecondDraftDura>[http://www.seconddraft.org/aldurah.php "Al-Durah: What happened?"], SecondDraft.org</ref> He asserts that the incident shows that "Palestinian cameramen, especially when there are no Westerners around, engage in the systematic staging of action scenes."<ref name=Carvajal />

==Wider use of the term==
Journalist [[Ruthie Blum]], writing in the ''Jerusalem Post'', describes "Pallywood" as a term coined by [[Richard Landes]] to refer to "productions staged by the Palestinians, in front of (and often with cooperation from) Western camera crews, for the purpose of promoting anti-Israel propaganda by disguising it as news." Landes himself describes Pallywood as "a term I coined...  to describe staged material disguised as news." Besides al-Durrah, Landes cites the [[Gaza beach blast]] and [[Hamas]]'s alleged exploitation of electricity shortages during the [[2007<U+2013>2008 Israel-Gaza conflict]], as incidents of Pallywood. According to Blum, Landes's "pretty harsh claims" have earned him a reputation in certain circles as a right-wing conspiracy theorist. <ref>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1206446110850&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull One on One: Framing the debate | Jerusalem Post<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Dr. Anat Berko, a Research Fellow with the [[International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism]], and Dr. Edna Erez, head of the Criminal Justice department of the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], assert that "the phenomenon of manufacturing documentation about the conflict has been referred to as "Pallywood" (Palestinian Authority Hollywood)".<ref>Berko, Anat and Erez, Edna, "Martyrs of murderers?

The term has been applied beyond the Muhammad al-Durrah case in a number of publications,<ref>[http://www.frontpagemag.com/GoPostal/commentdetail.aspx?GUID=2735c1d2-d46c-43d9-916b-da252d43574b&commentID=8539c371-a2c6-4559-a35a-dd133d251b0c FrontPage Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.americanthinker.com/2006/08/the_fog_of_peace.html American Thinker: The Fog of Peace<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>"Palestinian PR Stunt Fails As Israel Allows Gaza Protest, By Joel Leyden, Israel News Agency, August 23, 2008</ref>

Canadian columnist Paul Schneidereit has written, "[...] we've seen cases where the bodies of Palestinian martyrs carried on stretchers are inadvertently dropped, then, of their own volition, climb back on again. We<U+2019>ve seen reports of massacres, as in Jenin in 2002, that turned out, after independent investigation, to have been greatly exaggerated. Needless to say, such episodes don<U+2019>t instil an abiding trust in subsequent Palestinian claims, at least until they<U+2019>re verified."<ref>
