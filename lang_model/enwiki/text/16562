'''North Reef Light''' is an active [[lighthouse]] located on North Reef, a {{convert|5.6|km2}} [[planar reef]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://data.aims.gov.au/reefpage2/reefpage.jsp?fullReefID=23045A |title=AIMS Research - Reef Monitoring |work=data.aims.gov.au  |accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> about {{convert|120|km}} northeast of [[Gladstone, Queensland|Gladstone]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. The lighthouse was constructed on a migratory patch of sand inside a fringing coral reef, which over the years disappeared and reappeared, as sand was washed away and accumulated, and is now a vegetated sandy island. Its construction is unique, having a hollow concrete base that both gives it resistance to the shifting nature of the sandbar and serves as a fresh water tank.{{sfn|Lighthouses of Australia Inc}} As such, it is considered one of the major achievement in Australian lighthouse construction.{{sfn|AHD16455}} It is also notable in that due to the harsh conditions, only bachelors were allowed to serve as lighthouse keepers.{{sfn|Lighthouses of Australia Inc}} At {{convert|24|m}} it is also the tallest of Queensland's timber framed iron clad lighthouses.{{sfn|Marquis-Kyle|2009|p=4}}

==History==
[[File:North Reef Lighthouse - Section and Elevation, 1877.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of the lighthouse, 1876]]
The recommendation to establish a lighthouse on North Reef was made by a select parliamentary committee in 1864. The site was then a small sandbank on a coral reef. The proposal called for a [[cast iron]] cylindrical tower, {{convert|12|m}} in diameter and {{convert|15|m}} tall, which would rest on the coral, penetrating the sand. A hollow base would be formed by pouring concrete into the cylinder, which would also serve as a fresh water tank, and the residence will surround it.{{sfn|AHD16455}} Tenders were called in January 1876, and the winning offer was for <U+00A3>7,964 by Walker and Company of [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]]. Construction was to be completed in by July 1877 but delays, first in approval of the money and then in construction, delayed the completion until November 1878.{{sfn|AHD16455}}

The base of the tower, {{convert|13|m}} in diameter and {{convert|4.6|m}} high, was constructed of [[Bolted joint|bolted]] cast iron segments.{{sfn|Marquis-Kyle|2009|p=4}} Both the tower and the dwellings were constructed of timber frame, clad in [[galvanized iron]].{{sfn|AHD16455}} The original optical apparatus was a second order lens.{{sfn|Marquis-Kyle|2009|p=4}}

Conditions at the lighthouse were harsh. The location is remote, the quarters were cramped, and the shifting sands sometimes left the lighthouse surrounded by water. The [[lighthouse keeper]]s chosen were therefore only single, unmarried men.{{sfn|Lighthouses of Australia Inc}}{{sfn|Marquis-Kyle|2009|p=4}}

The light source was upgraded twice, in 1923 and in 1929.{{sfn|AHD16455}} In 1977 the light was converted to electricity{{sfn|AHD16455}} and it was demanned in January 1978.{{sfn|AN376-01}} The final upgrade was on 28 September 1987 when the light was converted to [[solar power]]{{sfn|AN376-01}} and six [[solar panel]]s were installed on the roof of the quarters, facing north.{{sfn|AHD16455}}

==Current display==
The current [[light characteristic]] is two white flashes, separated by five seconds, every 15 seconds (Fl.(2)W. 15s), visible for {{convert|17|nmi}}. A [[racon]] on the tower transmits [[morse code]] "Q" (<U+2013> <U+2013> <U+2022> <U+2013>).<ref>''List of Lights''</ref> 
The apparatus is a [[VRB-25]], rotating at 2&nbsp;[[rounds per minute|rpm]], and the light source is a 12&nbsp;[[Volt]] 35&nbsp;[[Watt]] [[Halogen lamp]] with an intensity of 35,050&nbsp;[[candela|cd]].{{sfn|AN376-01}}

==Structure==
[[File:Lighthouse, North Reef - Floor plans, 1876.jpg|thumb|left|floor plans, note the plan of the keepers' residence]]
[[File:North Reef Lighthouse 1949.jpg|A 1949 photo of the lighthouse|thumb|right|upright]]
As mentioned above, the lighthouse base is made of bolted cast iron segments, {{convert|13|m}} in diameter and {{convert|4.6|m}} high.{{sfn|Marquis-Kyle|2009|p=4}} The tower is {{convert|18|m}} from the base to the lantern,{{sfn|AN376-01}} conical in shape, with four intermediate floor levels.{{sfn|Marquis-Kyle|2009|p=4}} It is built of an internal timber frame, [[cladding (construction)|clad]] with [[galvanised iron|galvanised]] [[wrought iron]] plates,{{sfn|Marquis-Kyle|2009|pp=1,4}} painted white.{{sfn|Rowlett}} On top of the tower is a [[Chance Brothers]] {{convert|10|ft|9|in}} diameter lantern, housing the VRB-25 beacon.{{sfn|AN376-01}} The dome of the lantern is painted red.{{sfn|Rowlett}}

The [[lighthouse keeper]]s' residence surrounds the base of the tower. They comprise a ring of eight rooms, three bed rooms, 
two sitting rooms, two kitchens, and a store room. They are constructed of a timber frame with galvanised iron roof. The external walls are covered with corrugated galvanised iron sheets.{{sfn|Marquis-Kyle|2009|p=4}}

==Site operation and visiting==
The site and the light are operated by the [[Australian Maritime Safety Authority]]. The island is accessible by boat, but both the site and the light are closed to the public.{{sfn|Rowlett}}
