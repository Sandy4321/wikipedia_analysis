'''Golden Dawn''' ({{lang-el|<U+03A7><U+03C1><U+03C5><U+03C3><U+03AE> <U+0391><U+03C5><U+03B3><U+03AE>}}, ''Chrysi Avyi'') is a [[Greece|Greek]] [[Nationalism|Nationalist]] political organization led by [[Nikolaos Michaloliakos]] in Greece. Golden Dawn opposes [[democracy]], [[immigration]], [[multiculturalism]], [[Marxism]], [[globalization]], [[liberalism]], [[anti-militarism]] and [[anarchism]]. Its ideology has its roots in the [[Ancient Sparta]]n society of [[Lycurgus]] and [[Leonidas]]. It is also in favor of mass deportations of all immigrants who reside in the country. Members of the party have been many times accused for racist attacks.

''Chrysi Avyi'' is also the name of a newspaper and a magazine published by the organization.

Golden Dawn ceased political operations in 2005, and it was absorbed by the [[Patriotic Alliance]], which ceased operations after Michaloliakos withdrew support. In March 2007, Golden Dawn held its sixth congress, where Party officials announced the resumption of their political activism. At [[Greek local elections, 2010|local elections]] on November 7, 2010 Golden Dawn got 5,3% of the vote in the municipality of Athens, wining a seat at the City Council. In some neighbourhoods with big immigrant communities it even reached 20%.<ref name="NYCtimes">Kitsantonis, Niki.

In December 1980, [[Nikolaos Michaloliakos]], and a group of his supporters launched ''Chrysi Avyi'' magazine. Michaloliakos (a mathematician and former commando) had been active in [[far right]] politics for many years, and he had been arrested several times for politically-motivated offences.<ref name="IosHist">[http://www.hri.org/E/1998/98-07-02.dir/keimena/greece/greece2.htm <U+0393><U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03C6><U+03B5><U+03B9> <U+03BF> I<U+039F><U+03A3>] [[Eleftherotypia]] 2/07/1998 (in Greek)</ref><ref name="Vima">[http://www.tovima.gr/default.asp?pid=2&ct=75&artid=168197&dt=11/09/2005 <U+03A4><U+03BF> <U+03BA><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03B2><U+03B9><U+03BF> <U+00AB><U+03B1><U+03B2><U+03B3><U+03CC> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+03C6><U+03B9> <U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+00BB> (The rotten "egg of the snake")] [[To Vima]] 11/9/2005</ref><ref name="Michaloliakos">[http://www.ethniko.net/ironyouth/michaloliakos.htm Article about Michaloliakos] published on Golden Dawn's website.</ref> While he was in prison, Michaloliakos met the leaders of the [[Greek military junta of 1967<U+2013>1974]], and he laid the foundations of the Hrisi Avgi party.<ref name="Vima"/> The characteristics of the magazine and the organisation were clearly [[Nazism|National Socialist]].<ref name="IosHist"/> ''Chrysi Avyi'' magazine stopped being published in April 1984, when Michaloliakos joined the [[National Political Union]] and took over the leadership of its youth section.<ref name="Vima"/> In January 1985, he broke away from the National Political Union and founded the Popular National Movement <U+2013> Chrysi Avyi, which was officially recognised as a political party in 1993.<ref name="Vima"/>

A few Golden Dawn members participated in the [[Bosnian War]] in the [[Greek Volunteer Guard]] (GVG), which was part of the [[Drina Corps]] of the [[Army of Republika Srpska]].

Golden Dawn continued to hold rallies and marches, and it ran in the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (Greece)|1999 European Parliament election]] in an alliance with the [[Front Line (political party)|Front Line]] party, gaining 48,532 votes nationwide; 0.75% of the votes cast.<ref name="IosHist"/><ref name="HAelections">[http://www.hri.org/MPA/gr/other/elections99/other_parties.html "Ta alla Kommata"], [[Macedonian Press Agency]] information on the 1999 elections.</ref> Eleftherotypia criticicized Chrysi Avyi in 2005 after party members distributed [[Homophobia|homophobic]] fliers during an Athens [[gay pride parade]].<ref name="gayParade2006">[http://www.enet.gr/online/online_text?c=112&id=61462048 27/06/2005 article] in [[Eleftherotypia]] {{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref>

===2005 and later===

The party created the ''Epitropi Ethnikis Mnimis'' (''Committee of National Memory''), to organise demonstrations commemorating the anniversaries of certain Greek national events. Since 1996, ''Epitropi Ethnikis Mninis'' organizes an annual march usually on January 31 in [[Athens]], in memory of three Greek officers who died during the [[Imia/Kardak|Imia military crisis]].

===Football hooliganism===
In 2000, Golden Dawn members formed the [[hooligan firm]] ''Galazia Stratia'' (Greek for "Blue Army"), which has described itself as a "fan club of the Greek national teams." It has been reported that following Golden Dawn's official disbandment in 2005, many former party members have put most of their energy into promoting ''Galazia Stratia''.<ref name="Mundohooligans">[http://www.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,id=95908980 <U+039C><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03BF>-<U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03BC><U+03CC><U+03C2>] Eleftherotypia 10/9/2006 (in Greek)</ref> ''Galazia Stratia'' is closely linked to Golden Dawn, and the two groups shared the same street address.<ref name="NaziHooligan">[http://www.iospress.gr/mikro2001/mikro20011201.htm Nazis dressed up as fans], ''Eleftherotypia 1/12/2001''</ref> Golden Dawn made no attempt to deny the connections, openly praising the actions of ''Galazia Stratia'' in its newspaper, and accepting praise in return from the firm.<ref name="GSthanksHA">[http://www.meandros.net/galazia-stratia/pages/syndesmos.htm Galazia Stratia thanking Chrysi Avyi for the support].

===The ''Periandros'' case===
Antonios Androutsopoulos (better known as ''Periandros''),  a prominent member of Golden Dawn, was on the run from 1998 to September 14, 2005 after being accused of the June 16, 1998 attempted murder of three left-wing students <U+2014> including Dimitris Kousouris, who was heavily injured.<ref name="TaNea">[http://ta-nea.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=A&f=17916&m=N23&aa=1 17/04/2004 article] in [[Ta Nea]] (in Greek) {{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref name="Kathimerini">[http://archive.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100019_14/09/2005_60740 In Brief] [[Kathimerini]]. 14/09/2005</ref><ref name="Eleftherotypia">[http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text?c=112&id=34783000 <U+039F> <U+00AB><U+03A0><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2><U+00BB> <U+03AC><U+03B4><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B5> <U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03BD> <U+0395><U+039B>.<U+0391><U+03A3>.] [[Eleftherotypia]] 14/09/2005  (in Greek)</ref> Androutsopoulos had been sentenced [[in absentia]] to four years of prison for illegal weapon possession while the attempted murder charges against him were still standing.<ref name="Kathimerini2">[http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_786829_27/04/2004_101892 27/04/2004 article] in [[Kathimerini]] (in Greek) {{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref>

The authorities' failure to apprehend Androutsopoulos for seven years raised criticisms by the Greek media. A ''[[Ta Nea]]'' article claimed that Periandros remained in Greece and evaded arrest due to connections with the police.<ref name="TaNea"/> In a 2004 interview, [[Michalis Chrisochoidis]], the former minister of public order of [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]], claimed that such accusations were unfounded, and he blamed the inefficiency of the Greek police. Some allege that Androutsopoulos had evaded arrest because he had been residing in [[Venezuela]] until he turned himself in 2005.<ref name="Kathimerini3">[http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_280400_14/09/2005_156652 <U+03A0><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03B4><U+03CC><U+03B8><U+03B7><U+03BA><U+03B5> <U+03BF> <U+00AB>X<U+03C1><U+03C5><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2><U+00BB>] [[Kathimerini]] 14/09/2005 (in Greek)</ref> His trial began on September 20, 2006, and he was convicted to 21 years in prison on September 25, 2006.<ref name="PeriConvElefth">[http://www.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,id=84914692 <U+0391><U+03BC><U+03B5><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03CC><U+03B7><U+03C4><U+03B7> <U+0391><U+03C5><U+03B3><U+03AE> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+03C6><U+03B9><U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03CD>] Eleftherotypia 29/09/06 (in Greek)</ref><ref name="PeriConv06">[http://news.in.gr/greece/article/?aid=741411&lngDtrID=244 <U+0395><U+03AF><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C3><U+03B9> <U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03B1> <U+03C7><U+03C1><U+03CC><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03B1> <U+03BA><U+03AC><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03C1><U+03BE><U+03B7> <U+03C7><U+03C9><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03C2> <U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03AE> <U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03BD> <U+00AB><U+03A0><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+00BB> <U+03B3><U+03B9><U+03B1> <U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03BD> <U+03B5><U+03C0><U+03AF><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03C3><U+03B7> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03AC> <U+03C6><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C4><U+03CE><U+03BD>] in.gr 25/09/06 (in Greek)</ref> Hrisi Avgi members were present in his trial, shouting nationalist slogans.<ref name="PeriConvElefth"/>

===Imia 2008===
On February 2, 2008, Golden Dawn planned to hold the annual march for the twelfth anniversary of the Imia military crisis. Leftist and anti-fascist groups organised a protest in order to cancel the march, as a response to racist attacks, supposedly caused by Golden Dawn members. Golden Dawn members occupied the square in which the march was to take place, and when anti-fascists showed up, clashes occurred. During the riots that followed, Golden Dawn members were seen attacking the anti-fascists with riot police doing nothing to stop them and actually letting them pass through their lines. This led to two people being wounded by knife and another two wounded by rocks. Anti-fascists claimed that Chrysi Avyi members even carried police equipment with them and that Golden Dawn's equipment was carried inside a police van.<ref>[http://athens.indymedia.org/front.php3?lang=el&article_id=823380 Athens Indymedia] 2008/02/03</ref><ref>[http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,id=72703688,94637512,80585800,7746952,15637256,90684776 <U+0394><U+0395><U+03A3><U+039C><U+039F><U+0399> <U+0391><U+0399><U+039C><U+0391><U+03A4><U+039F><U+03A3>] Eleftherotypia  2008/02/04 (In Greek)</ref> The march was canceled and Golden Dawn issued a statement, responding to accusations of cooperation with the [[Greek Police]], claiming that it was actually the anti-fascists who were collaborating with the police, since it was the anarchists and anti-Fascists that originally attacked the square where the Golden Dawn members were present, without anyone trying to stop them and in the night riots that followed, no arrest was made despite the damage caused by anarchists and anti-fascists.<ref>[http://xryshaygh.wordpress.com/2008/02/03/apantisi/#more-127 <U+0397> <U+03A7><U+03C1><U+03C5><U+03C3><U+03AE> <U+0391><U+03C5><U+03B3><U+03AE> <U+0391><U+03C0><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03AC>] Chrysi Avyi press release. 2008/02/03</ref>
Also it is claimed that police turned on the anarchists in the end, after anarchists threw rocks at the police, hence why Golden Dawn followed the police from behind towards the anarchists.

===Bombing of their Athens office===

On March 19, 2010, a bomb described by the police as of "moderate power," was detonated in the fifth floor office of Golden Dawn, in downtown Athens.  Twenty-five minutes prior to the blast, an unidentified caller contacted a local newspaper in order to announce the attack, thus leading to the evacuation of the targeted building and the surrounding area.  The explosion caused substantial damage to property, but didn't inflict any casualties. The office was reopened on April 10, 2010. <ref>[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=24&art_id=nw20100319092955696C888964 Neo-Nazi offices in Greece bombed] [[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]], March 19th, 2010, retrieved March 27, 2010</ref>

==Allegations of connections to the Greek Police==

In a 1998 interview with the left wing newspaper ''[[Eleftherotypia]]'', [[Georgios Romaios]] (the then [[PASOK]]-[[Minister for Public Order (Greece)|Minister for Public Order]]) alleged the existence of "fascist elements in the [[Greek police]]", and vowed to suppress them.<ref name="Romaios">[http://www.hri.org/news/grpapers/typos/1998/98-06-29.typos.html Athens News Agency: Press Review in Greek, 98-06-29]. Hri.org (1998-06-29). Retrieved on 2011-06-27.</ref> In a TV interview that same year, Romaios again claimed that there was a pro-fascist group within the police force although he said it was not organized, and was only involved in isolated incidents.<ref name="Ios98_3">[http://www.iospress.gr/ios1998/ios19980927c.htm Eleftherotypia's article] part 3 (in Greek)</ref> The same year, Eleftherotypia published a lengthy article called "The lower limbs of the police", which outlined connections between the police and [[neo-fascism]].<ref name="Ios98_1">[http://www.iospress.gr/ios1998/ios19980927c.htm Eleftherotypia article] part 1 (in Greek)</ref> Dimitris Reppas, the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] [[Minister for the Press and the Media (Greece)|government spokesman]], strongly denied such connections. However, the article quoted a speech by [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] [[Hellenic Parliament|Member of Parliament]] Paraskevas Paraskevopoulos about a riot caused by [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] extremists, in which he said:
<blockquote>
''In Thessaloniki it is widely discussed that far-right organisations are active in the security forces. Members of such organisations were the planners and chief executioners of the riot and nobody was arrested. A Special Forces officer, speaking at a briefing of Special Forces policemen that where to be on duty that day, told the policemen not to arrest anyone because the rioters were not enemies and threatened that should this be overlooked there would be penalties.''
<ref name="Ios98_3"/></blockquote>

Before the surrender of Androutsopoulos, an article by the left leaning newspaper [[Ta Nea]] claimed that the Golden Dawn had close relationships with some parts of the Greek police force.<ref name="TaNea"/> In relation to the Periandros case, the article quoted an unidentified police officer who said that "half the force wanted Periandros arrested and the other half didn't". The article claimed that there was a confidential internal police investigation which concluded that:
#Golden Dawn had very good relations and contacts with officers of the force, on and off duty, as well as with common policemen.
#The police provided the group with [[Club (weapon)|baton]]s and radio communications equipment during mass demonstrations, mainly during celebrations of the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] and during rallies by left-wing and anarchist groups, in order to provoke riots.
#The connections of the group with the force, as well as connections with Periandros, largely delayed his arrest.
#The brother of "Periandros", also a member of Golden Dawn, was a security escort of an unnamed [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] MP.
#Many Golden Dawn members were illegally carrying various kinds of weapons.

The newspaper published a photograph of a typewritten paragraph with no identifiable insignia as evidence of the secret investigation.<ref name="TaNeaGif">[http://ta-nea.dolnet.gr/data/D2004/D0417/1el23c.gif Image from the article] of [[Ta Nea]]</ref> In the article, the Minister for Public Order, [[Michalis Chrysochoidis]], responded that he did not recollect such a probe. Chrysochoidis also denied accusations that far right connections within the police force delayed the arrest of Periandros. He said that leftist groups, including the ultra left terrorist group [[Revolutionary Organization 17 November|17 November]], responsible for several murders, had similarly evaded the police for decades. In both cases, he attributed the failures to "stupidity and incompetence" on behalf of the force.<ref name="TaNea"/>

Golden Dawn stated that rumours about the organisation having connections to the Greek police and the government are untrue, and that the police had intervened in Golden Dawn's rallies and had arrested members of the Party several times while the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party was in power (for example, during a rally in Thessaloniki in June 2006, and at a rally for the anniversary of the [[Greek genocide]], in Athens, also in 2006).<ref name="XApress"/> Also, on January 2, 2005, [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] and [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] groups invaded Golden Dawn's headquarters in Thesaloniki, under heavy police surveillance. Although riot police units were near the entrance of the building alongside the intruders, they did not attempt to stop their actions.<ref>[http://athens.indymedia.org/front.php3?lang=el&article_id=314801 Indymedia Athens].
