'''''Thespis''', or The Gods Grown Old'', is an [[opera]]tic [[extravaganza]] that was the first collaboration between dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] and composer [[Arthur Sullivan]]. It was never published, and most of the music is now lost. However, [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] would go on to become one of the most famous and successful partnerships in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, creating a string of [[comic opera]] hits, including ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'', that continue to be popular throughout the English-speaking world. 

''Thespis'' premi<U+00E8>red in [[London]] at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] on [[December 26]] [[1871]]. Like many productions at that theatre, it was written in a broad, [[burlesque (genre)|burlesque]] style, considerably different from Gilbert and Sullivan's later works. It was a modest success<U+2014>for a Christmas entertainment of the time<U+2014>and closed on [[March 8]] [[1872]], after a run of 63 performances.<ref>The length of the run is given as 64 performances in some sources. According to Rees (p. 78, n. 7), that is because they fail to take into account that there was no performance of ''Thespis'' on [[Ash Wednesday]].</ref>  

The story follows an acting troupe headed by [[Thespis]], the legendary Greek father of the [[drama]], who temporarily trade places with the now elderly [[Greek mythology|gods]] on [[Mount Olympus]]. The actors turn out to be comically inept rulers. Having seen the ensuing mayhem down below, the angry gods return, sending the actors back to Earth as "eminent tragedians, whom no one ever goes to see." Gilbert would return to this theme twenty-five years later in his last opera with Sullivan, ''[[The Grand Duke]]'', in which a theatre company temporarily replace the ruler of a small country and decide to "revive the classic memories of Athens at its best."

Seasonal works like ''Thespis'' were not normally expected to endure, and aside from a [[benefit performance]] shortly after the original staging, ''Thespis'' was not performed again during its creators' lifetimes.  A renewed interest in the piece began in the 1950s, and numerous productions have been performed since, either with music taken from Sullivan's other works, or with original music.

==Synopsis==
===Act I===
[[Image:Thespis - I do not know you.png|200px|thumb|right|Thespis meets the gods - detail from a larger engraving.]]
''Scene: A Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus''

On Mount Olympus, the aged deities lament their waning influence. Mercury complains that the gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him. Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it. The gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain, and withdraw to observe them from a distance.

Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis. Daphne, Sparkeion's former fianc<U+00E9>e, annoys Nicemis by flirting with him. In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with Thespis. Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof, or he will lose his influence.

Jupiter, Mars, and Apollo enter. All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis. Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods. Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive, and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to judge for themselves why people do not take them seriously. They agree that Thespis and his acting company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods' absence. Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter. Mercury stays behind to offer any advice the actors may need.

===Act II===
[[Image:Thespis - You're Diana I'm Apollo.png|thumb|left|250px|Thespis rules on whether Sparkeion is married to the woman that suits his mythological role, or the one he actually married.]]
''The Same Scene, with the Ruins Restored''

Under Thespis's direction, Olympus has been restored to its former splendour. However, Mercury says that the substitute gods are incompetent, and their experiments have wreaked havoc in the world below. For instance, the replacement for Mars is a pacifist, the replacement for [[Hymenaios|Hymen]] refuses to marry anyone, and the substitute [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] is a [[teetotaller]]. The ersatz [[Phoebus]], the god of day, goes out at night, and the substitute Venus decrees that babies are to be born full-grown. The actors also find that the romantic entanglements of the gods they've replaced conflict with their attachments in real life. Venus, played by Pretteia, is supposed to be married to Mars, but the actor playing Mars is her father. A possible solution is discovered in Venus having actually married [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], but Vulcan is her grandfather. Daphne has become the muse [[Calliope]], and claims, based on a [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]] edition of the [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]], that Calliope was married to Apollo. However, Sparkeion, who took on the role of Apollo, is already married to Nicemis. Thespis is asked to rule on these issues, and, while he puts off judging Pretteia's case, he decides that Sparkeion is married to Daphne while they are gods, but his marriage to Nicemis will resume when they are mortals once again.

When the gods return they are furious at the disarray that Thespis's company have created. They watch incognito as Mercury presents to Thespis all of the complaints from earth that have accumulated while the gods have been gone. After listening to a long list of grievances, the gods shed their disguises and banish the actors from Olympus. As punishment for their folly, Jupiter sends them back to earth as "eminent [[tragedian]]s, whom no one ever goes to see."

==Background==
===Genesis===
[[Image:Hollingshead.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[John Hollingshead]] had a lot of balls in the air: This engraving shows him juggling [[ballet]], [[op<U+00E9>ra bouffe]], and [[drama]].]][[Impresario]] and author [[John Hollingshead]], the lessee of London's [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] since 1868, had produced a number of successful musical [[burlesque (genre)|burlesques]] and [[operettas]] there. Indeed, Hollingshead "boasted that he kept alight 'the sacred lamp of burlesque.'"<ref>Dark & Grey, p. 63.</ref> Gilbert and Sullivan were each well acquainted with the Gaiety and its house artistes. Gilbert's ''Robert the Devil'' (a [[burlesque (genre)|burlesque]] of the opera ''[[Robert le Diable (opera)|Robert le Diable]]'') had been on the programme on the theatre's opening night on [[21 December]] [[1868]], with [[Nellie Farren]] in the title role. Constance Loseby and Annie Tremaine (both of whom had roles in ''Thespis'') were also in the cast, and Arthur Sullivan was in the audience.<ref>Ainger, p. 80.</ref> It was a great success, "received with a storm of approbation."<ref>Ainger, p. 80, quoting a review in the ''Times'' of [[24 December]] [[1868]].</ref> Less successfully, Gilbert had also written a play for the theatre in 1869 called ''An Old Score''.<ref>Stedman, pp. 73<U+2013>74.</ref> Hollingshead would later say that the piece was "too true to nature."<ref>Ainger, p. 82, quoting Hollingshead, ''Good Old Gaiety'', p. 16.</ref> By late September or early October of 1871, Gaiety programmes announced that "The Christmas Operatic Extravaganza will be written by W. S. Gilbert, with original music by Arthur Sullivan."<ref>Rees, p. 10.</ref> There would be prominent roles for the popular comedian [[J. L. Toole]], as well as Farren, the theatre's star "principal boy" in all of its burlesques.

How and when the pair came to collaborate on ''Thespis'' is uncertain. Gilbert was a logical choice for the assignment. With seven operas and plays premi<U+00E8>ring that year and over a dozen other burlesques, farces and extravaganzas under his belt, he was well known to London theatregoers as a comic [[dramatist]].<ref>Goldberg, p. 144.</ref> Sullivan, however, was at this point mainly known for his serious music. His completed music that year included the choral [[cantata]] ''[[On Shore and Sea]]'', a suite of [[incidental music]] for Shakespeare's ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and numerous hymns, including "[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]." He did have two comic operas to his credit, ''[[Cox and Box]]'' (1866) and ''[[The Contrabandista]]'' (1867), but the latter was four years in the past and had been unsuccessful. In September 1871, Sullivan had been engaged to [[conducting|conduct]] at The Royal National Opera, but it failed abruptly, leaving him unexpectedly without commitments.<ref>Rees, p. 11.</ref> Hollingshead's offer of a role to his brother, [[Fred Sullivan]], may have encouraged him to write the music for ''Thespis''.<ref name=Ainger93>Ainger, p. 93.</ref>

The production "aroused a great deal of interest and speculation."<ref>Rees, p. 26.</ref> Ironically, it had "probably the largest audience" of any Gilbert and Sullivan premi<U+00E8>re, as the Gaiety was the largest of the five London theatres at which their joint works premi<U+00E8>red.<ref>Allen, p. 1.</ref>

===Composition===
Gilbert had a busy autumn. His play ''On Guard'' had an unsuccessful run at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]], opening on [[28 October]] [[1871]],<ref>Ainger, p. 92.</ref> while his most successful play to date, ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea]]'', opened on [[9 December]], only a few days before rehearsals for ''Thespis'' were to begin.<ref name=Ainger93/> Sullivan, however, had more time on his hands after a [[Manchester]] production of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', for which he supplied incidental music, had its premi<U+00E8>re on [[9 September]].<ref>Ainger, p. 91.</ref>

[[Image:Pygmalion and Galatea.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''[[Pygmalion and Galatea]]'', 1871]]Both Gilbert and Sullivan recalled that ''Thespis'' was written in some haste. Sullivan recalled, simply, that "...both music and ''libretto'' were very hurriedly written."<ref>Lawrence, p. 85.</ref> In his 1883 autobiography, Gilbert wrote:
{{cquote2|Soon after the production of ''Pygmalion and Galatea'' I wrote the first of many libretti, in collaboration with Mr Arthur Sullivan. This was called ''Thespis; or, the Gods Grown Old.'' It was put together in less than three weeks, and was produced at the Gaiety theatre after a week's rehearsal. It ran eighty nights, but it was a crude and ineffective work, as might be expected, taking into consideration the circumstances of its rapid composition.<ref>Gilbert, William Schwenck.  'William Schwenck Gilbert: an Autobiography' in ''The Theatre: A Monthly Review of the Drama, Music, and the Fine Arts'', vol. 1 (2 April 1883), pp. 217-24, reprinted in ''Gilbert and Sullivan: Interviews and Recollections'', ed. Harold Orel, Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1994, p. 8.</ref>}}

By 1902, Gilbert's recollection of the time frame had expanded to five weeks:
 
{{cquote2|I may state that "Thespis" was in no sense a failure although it achieved no considerable success. I believe it ran about seven[ty] nights<U+2014>a fair run in those days.<ref>The reference to ''seven nights'' in the original quote is almost certainly a misprint for ''seventy''. See J. G. Birkby, "'Thespis' and its London Run," in ''The Gilbert & Sullivan Journal'', Vol. V, No. 5 (March 1938), p. 65.</ref> The piece was produced under stress of tremendous hurry. It was invented, written, composed, rehearsed, and produced within five weeks.<ref name=Searle>Townley Searle, ''A Bibliography of Sir William Schwenck Gilbert with Bibliographical Adventures in the Gilbert & Sullivan Operas'', New York: Burt Franklin (1968), p. 6, quoting a 1902 letter from Gilbert to Percy Strzelecki.</ref>}}

Gilbert's five-week estimate is "in conflict with other apparently incontrovertible facts."<ref>Rees, pp. 23<U+2013>24. See also Allen, p. 2, who concludes that "these four or five weeks of ''Thespis'' preparation were not consecutive."</ref>  Sullivan's nephew, [[Herbert Sullivan]], wrote that the libretto was already in existence before his uncle became involved in the project: "Gilbert showed [Hollingshead] the libretto of an operatic Extravaganza ''Thespis'', and Hollingshead forthwith sent it to Sullivan to set."<ref>Sullivan & Flower, p. 68. Also, Goldberg, p. 143.</ref> But Rees observes that Gilbert generally did not write a libretto until he had a firm commitment to produce it,<ref name=Rees25/> and Allen concludes that the libretto was "published and circulated" during the pre-Christmas period,<ref name=Allen2>Allen, p. 2.</ref> which is consistent with the date of [[14 December]], when Gilbert first read it to the cast.<ref name=Rees24>Rees, p. 24.</ref> 

At the very least, a "rough draft of the plot"<ref name=Rees25>Rees, p. 25</ref> must have existed by [[30 October]], in light of a letter on that date from Gilbert's agent to R. M. Field of the Boston Museum Theatre, which reads:
{{cquote2|At Xmas will be produced at the Gaiety Theatre, a new and original Opera Bouffe in English, by W. S. Gilbert, Esq., & Arthur Sullivan, Esq. does the new music. It is expected to be a ''Big Thing''<U+2014>and the purport of my present letter to you is<U+2014>first<U+2014>to send you (this day) rough sketch of the piece ''for your own reading'', and secondly to ask you<U+2014>if you care and will cause the piece to be rightly protected<U+2014>with a view to sale in all places possible in the United States.... Messrs. G. & S. are now hard at work on said piece."<ref name=Allen2/>}} Gilbert did, in fact, conclude an agreement with Field, and the first published libretto advised: "Caution to American Pirates.<U+2014>The Copyright of the Dialogue and Music of this Piece, for the United States and Canada, has been assigned to Mr. Field, of the Boston Museum, by agreement, dated 7th December, 1871."<ref name=Allen2/> If Field mounted the work, however, the production has not been traced. Gilbert's concern about American pirates foreshadowed the difficulties he and Sullivan would later encounter with unauthorized "pirated" productions of ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Mikado]]'' and their other popular works.

===Production===
[[Image:JLToole1874.jpg|left|frame|Toole, about 1874]]With the piece set to open on [[26 December]],<ref name=Stedman94>Stedman, p. 94.</ref> Gilbert first read the libretto to the cast on [[14 December]],<ref name=Rees24/> but Toole, who was playing the central role of Thespis, did not return from a tour of the British provinces until [[18 December]]. He then appeared in nine performances at the Gaiety in the six days immediately after his return, and other actors had similar commitments. In addition, Hollingshead had committed the company to perform a [[pantomime]] at [[The Crystal Palace]] on [[21 December]], which included many of the performers who would be in ''Thespis''. Lastly, ''Thespis'' was to play as the [[afterpiece]] to an [[H. J. Byron]] comedy, ''Dearer than Life'', which shared many of its actors, including Toole and Fred Sullivan, and had to be rehearsed at the same time.<ref>Rees, pp. 19-21</ref>

Despite the short time available for rehearsals, Sullivan recalled that Gilbert insisted that the chorus play a major role, as it would do in their later [[Savoy operas]]:
{{cquote2|Until Gilbert took the matter in hand choruses were dummy concerns, and were practically nothing more than a part of the stage setting. It was in 'Thespis' that Gilbert began to carry out his expressed determination to get the chorus to play its proper part in the performance. At this moment it seems difficult to realise that the idea of the chorus being anything more than a sort of stage audience was, at that time, a tremendous novelty. In consequence of this innovation, some of the incidents at the rehearsal of 'Thespis' were rather amusing. I remember that, on one occasion, one of the principals became quite indignant and said, 'Really, Mr. Gilbert, why should I stand here? I am not a chorus-girl!' to which Gilbert replied curtly, 'No, madam, your voice is not strong enough, or no doubt you would be.'<ref>Lawrence, pp. 85<U+2013>86.</ref>}}

==Reception==
===Opening night===
The premi<U+00E8>re was under rehearsed, as several critics noted, and the work was also evidently in need of cutting: Gaiety management had advised that carriages should be called for 11:00 p.m., but ''Thespis'' was still playing past midnight.<ref>Allen, pp. 4<U+2013>5.</ref>  ''The Orchestra'' reported that "scarcely one player... was more than 'rough perfect' in his part." ''[[The Observer]]'' commented that "the acting as well as the business, will want working up before it can be fairly criticized."  The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' suggested that "It is more satisfactory for many reasons to look upon the performance last evening as a full dress rehearsal.... When ''Thespis'' ends at the orthodox Gaiety closing hour, and the opera has been energetically rehearsed, few happier entertainments will be found."<ref>Rees, p. 76.</ref> Some critics could not see past the production's state of disarray. The ''Hornet'' captioned its review, "Thespis; or, the Gods Grown Old and <small>WEARISOME</small>!"<ref name=Stedman94/>  The ''[[Morning Advertiser]]'' found it "a dreary, tedious two-act rigmarole of a plot... grotesque without wit, and the music thin without liveliness... however, not entirely devoid of melody.... The curtain falls before a yawning and weary audience."<ref name=Allen5>Allen, p. 5.</ref>  But others found much to admire in the work, despite the poor opening performance. The ''Illustrated Times'' wrote:

{{cquote2|It is terribly severe on Mr. W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, the joint authors of ''Thespis'', that their work was produced in such a crude and unsatisfactory state. ''Thespis'' on its own merits<U+2014>merits of literary worth, merits of fun, merits of song writing deserves to succeed; but the management has crippled a good play by insufficiency of rehearsals and a want of that requisite polish and ''aplomb'' without which these merry operas are useless. I must state, however, that ''Thespis'' is well worth seeing; and when it has been corrected and attracts the proper Gaiety audience, it will hold its own bravely. It is a pity, indeed, that such a play, so rich in humour and so delicate in music, was produced for the edification of a Boxing-Night audience. Anything would have done for such an occasion.... Unless I am very much mistaken, and despite the hisses of Boxing-Night... the ballads and wit of Mr. Gilbert [and] the pretty strains of Mr. Arthur Sullivan... will carry Thespis through and make it<U+2014>as it deserves to be<U+2014>the most praiseworthy piece of the Christmas season.<ref>Rees, p. 75.</ref>}}

[[Clement Scott]], writing in the ''Daily Telegraph'', had a mostly favourable reaction:
{{cquote2|Possibly a holiday audience is disinclined to dive into the mysteries of heathen mythology, and does not care to exercise the requisite intellect to unravel an amusing, and by no means intricate, plot.... Certain it is, however, that the greeting which awaited ''Thespis, or The Gods Grown Old'', was not so cordial as might have been expected. The story, written by Mr. W. S. Gilbert in his liveliest manner, is so original, and the music contributed by Mr. Arthur Sullivan so pretty and fascinating, that we are inclined to be disappointed when we find the applause fitful, the laughter scarcely spontaneous, and the curtain falling not without sounds of disapprobation. Such a fate as this was certainly not deserved, and the verdict of last evening cannot be taken as final. ''Thespis'' is too good to be put on one side and cold-shouldered in this fashion: and we anticipate that judicious curtailment and constant rehearsal will enable us shortly to tell a very different tale.<ref name=Allen5/>}}

===Subsequent performances===
Many writers in the early 20th century perpetuated a myth that ''Thespis'' ran only a month and was considered a failure.<ref>Wyndham, p. 119; Walbrook, p. 35; Dark & Grey, p. 63; Dunhill, p. 45; Fitz-Gerald, p. 2; Sullivan & Flower, p. 68; Pearson, p. 89.</ref> In fact, it remained open until [[8 March]]. Of the nine London pantomimes that appeared during the 1871<U+2013>72 holiday season, five closed before ''Thespis'' did. By its nature, the genre did not lend itself to long runs, and all nine had closed by the end of March.<ref name=Rees78>Rees, p. 78.</ref>

[[Image:Sparkion.jpg|frame|right|Mlle. Clary, the original Sparkeion, for whose benefit the last performance of ''Thespis'' with the original music was given.]]As they would do with all their operas, Gilbert and Sullivan made cuts and alterations after the first performance. Two days after the opening, Sullivan wrote to his mother, "I have rarely seen anything so beautiful put upon the stage. The first night I had a great reception, but the music went badly, and the singer sang half a tone sharp, so that the enthusiasm of the audience did not sustain itself towards me. Last night I cut out the song, the music went very well, and consequently I had a hearty call before the curtain at the end of Act II."<ref>Sullivan & Flower, pp. 68<U+2013>69.</ref>  The piece eventually settled into a respectable state, and later critics were much more enthusiastic than those on opening night. 

By the third night, the ''London Figaro'' could report: "I must say that not a single hitch in the performance is now to be perceived, and that the applause and evident delight of the audience from beginning to end, the piece occupying a space of time within two hours."<ref name=Rees78/> On [[6 January]] [[1872]], the ''[[Penny Illustrated Paper]]'' commented that "Mr. Gilbert's Gaiety extravaganza grows in public favour and deservedly so...." On [[9 January]], the ''Daily Telegraph'' reported a visit by His Royal Highness, the [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Edinburgh]]. By [[27 January]], the ''Illustrated Times'' noted that "a chance playgoer will certainly not find a seat at the Gaiety.... ''Thespis'' can, after all, boast the success which was predicted...." ''Land and Water'' reported on [[3 February]] that "Thespis is now in capital working order."<ref>Rees, p. 79.</ref> 

Performances of ''Thespis'' were interrupted on [[14 February]] [[1872]], [[Ash Wednesday]], since London theatres refrained from presenting costumed performances out of respect for the religious holiday. Instead, a "miscellaneous entertainment" was given at the Gaiety, consisting of ventriloquists, performing dogs and, coincidentally, a sketch parodying a penny reading by the young [[George Grossmith]], who, several years later, became Gilbert and Sullivan's principal comedian.<ref name=Moss>{{cite web |url=http://www.c20th.com/GSarchive.htm |title=Gilbert & Sullivan: A Selling Exhibition of Memorabilia |author=Moss, Simon |accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref>

On [[17 February]], [[Henry Sutherland Edwards]] wrote in the ''Musical World'': "In almost all conjunctions of music and words, there is a sacrifice of one to the other; but in ''Thespis''... Sufficient opportunities have been given for music; and the music serves only to adorn the piece."<ref name=Stedman94/> Similar reports continued to appear through early March, when ''Thespis'' closed. The final performance during the authors' lifetimes was given less than two months later, on [[27 April]], at a matin<U+00E9>e for the benefit of Mlle. Clary, the original Sparkeion. On such an occasion, a performer would mormally choose a piece likely to sell well, as the beneficiary was entitled to the income (after expenses), and tickets were generally offered at "inflated prices."<ref>Rees, pp. 81<U+2013>82.</ref> The actress was a Gaiety favourite, "not only in respect of her voice but also her delicious French accent and, of course, her figure."<ref>Rees, p. 14.</ref> Others recalled "the charm of Mlle. Clary, with her pretty face and piquant broken English."<ref>Walbrook, p. 34.</ref>  She had been particularly successful as Sparkeion,<ref>Allen, p. 5; Walbrook, chapter II</ref> and her song in Act II, "Little Maid of Arcadee," was the only one chosen for publication.

===Aftermath===
After the production of ''Thespis'', Gilbert and Sullivan went their separate ways, reuniting three years later, with [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] as their manager, to produce ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' in 1875. When that work was a surprise success, there were discussions of quickly reviving ''Thespis'' for the 1875 Christmas season. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan:
{{cquote2|They seem very anxious to have it and wanted me to name definite terms. Of course I couldn't answer for ''you'', but they pressed me so much to give them an idea of what our terms would be likely to be that I suggested that possibly we might be disposed to accept two [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] a night ''each'' with a guarantee of 100 nights minimum. Does this meet your views, & if so, could you get it done in time. I am going to re-write a considerable portion of the dialogue.<ref>Ainger, p. 113, quoting a letter from Gilbert to Sullivan, [[October 28]] [[1875]].</ref>}} The proposed revival was mentioned in several more letters throughout the fall of 1875, until on [[23 November]] Gilbert wrote, "I have heard no more about ''Thespis''. It is astonishing how quickly these capitalists dry up under the magic influence of the words 'cash down'."<ref>Ainger, p. 114.</ref> In 1895, with Richard D'Oyly Carte struggling to rediscover success at the Savoy, he once again proposed a revival of ''Thespis'', but the idea was not pursued.<ref name=Stedman95>Stedman, p. 95.</ref>

The reasons why ''Thespis'' went unrevived are not known. Some commentators assert that Sullivan used the music in his other operas.<ref>Walbrook, p. 27; Fitz-Gerald, p. 2; Dunhill, p. 45; Allen, p. 6.</ref> If this was true, then "for this reason alone a revival would have become impossible."<ref name=Rees88>Rees, p. 88.</ref> However, evidence that Sullivan did so has eluded discovery.<ref>Tillett & Spencer, p. 3; Stedman, pp. 95<U+2013>96.</ref> Another possible explanation is that they came to regard ''Thespis'', with its "brazen girls in tights and short skirts,"<ref name=Jacobs73/> and broad burlesque-style humour, as "the kind of work they wished to avoid."<ref name=Rees88/>

In 1879, Sullivan, Gilbert and Carte were in the midst of a legal battle with the former directors of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|Comedy Opera Company]], which had produced ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]''. Sullivan wrote to Hollingshead, saying: "You once settled a precedent for me which may just at present be of great importance to me. I asked you for the band parts of the ''Merry Wives of Windsor''... and [you] said, 'They are yours, as our run is over....' Now will you please let me have them, and the parts of ''Thespis'' also at once. I am detaining the parts of ''Pinafore'', so that the directors shall not take them away from the [[Opera Comique|Comique]] tomorrow, and I base my claim on the precedent ''you'' set."<ref>Rees, p. 89.</ref>

===Modern productions=== 
After its last performance at the Gaiety in 1872, ''Thespis'' appears to have remained unperformed until 1953, although an attempted reconstruction from the 1940s has been discovered.<ref>Tillett & Spencer, p. 4.</ref> Tillett and Spencer, who discovered the ballet music, identified twenty separate reconstructions of ''Thespis'' between 1953 and 2002. About half of these use music adapted from Sullivan's other works; the others use new music for all but the surviving songs, or, in a few cases, re-compose those as well.<ref>Tillett & Spencer, p. 6.</ref> No version has become predominant in recent productions.   
   
Theatre historian [[Terence Rees]] developed a version of the libretto that attempts to correct the many errors noted in the surviving libretto.<ref>Rees, p. 101-45</ref> Rees also prepared a performance version, based on the libretto, which included a few interpolated lyrics from Gilbert's non-Sullivan operas in an attempt to replace the missing songs. A score was supplied by Garth Morton, based on music from lesser-known Sullivan operas, and this version was recorded.<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/thespis/thespis.pdf Annotated libretto to ''Thespis'', prepared by Ian Bond, noting Rees' additions for the performance version.] The interpolated songs do not appear in Rees' ''Thespis, a Gilbert and Sullivan Enigma''.</ref>

==Assessment==
===More than the usual burlesque===
''Thespis'' was an advance on the types of burlesques to which Gaiety audiences were accustomed.  [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Cellier]] recalled much later:
{{cquote2|I retain a dim recollection of witnessing the piece and being impressed with the freshness of Gilbert's libretto, especially as regards the lyrics, which were, indeed, a treat to read after the vapid, futile jingle of rhymes without reason which had hitherto passed muster on those degenerate days. To all play-goers it was a new "sensation" in musical plays. As for Arthur Sullivan's music, need I say how every number charmed and charmed again?<ref>Cellier & Bridgeman, p. 16.</ref>}}

Several critics suggested that the piece may have been too sophisticated for its audience<U+2014>or at least, the audience that greeted its first performance on [[Boxing Day|Boxing Night]]. The ''Times'' wrote: "The dialogue throughout is superior in ability and point to that with which ordinary burlesque and extravaganza have familiarized us; so much so, in fact, that it was a daring experiment to produce such a piece on such a night. It met, however, with an excellent reception, and on any other occasion than Boxing Night the numerous merits of the piece cannot fail to secure for it in the public estimation a high place among the novelties of the season."<ref>Allen, p. 4.</ref> Other reviews of the first night took up a similar theme: ''[[Sporting Life (newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'' suggested that "It may be that they looked for something less polished than Mr. Gilbert's verse, and went for something broader and coarser than that delightful author's humour. It may be, too, that ''Thespis'' was a little<U+2014>I only say, just a little<U+2014>'over their heads'."<ref name=Rees77>Rees, p. 77.</ref> ''The Orchestra'' carried a similar sentiment: "In fact, both music and idea were somewhat over the heads of the audience.<ref name=Rees77/>

===Libretto===
[[Image:First Comic Mythologist - W. S. Gilbert.png|thumb|right|300px|The first of Gilbert's "Comic Mythologist" articles in the illustrated magazine ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]''.]]
The plot of Thespis, with its elderly gods tired of their life in Olympus, is similar to some of Offenbach's operas, notably ''[[Orph<U+00E9>e aux Enfers]]'' (''Orpheus in the Underworld''). In ''Orph<U+00E9>e aux Enfers'', like ''Thespis'', classical mythology, particularly the Olympian gods, are ruthlessly parodied. In ''Thespis'', the gods swap places with the actors and descend to Earth; in ''Orph<U+00E9>e aux Enfers'', the gods head to hell for a pleasant holiday away from too much boring perfection. Offenbach's plot <U+2013> for although [[Hector-Jonathan Cr<U+00E9>mieux|Cr<U+00E9>mieux]] and [[Ludovic Hal<U+00E9>vy|Hal<U+00E9>vy]] wrote the libretto, the idea was Offenbach's <U+2013> places [[Orpheus]], the great musician, in the centre; however, Gilbert's plot focuses on Thespis, the Father of the Drama. While this may be a coincidence, it could also be seen as a response to Offenbach, as his plot places music at the centre of his operetta, but Gilbert's elevates the dramatist.<ref>Crowther (2000) p. 71<U+2013>72</ref> 

The libretto has been praised by several biographers and historians. One said that "The dialogue contains many an authentic Gilbertian touch."<ref>Walbrook, p. 31.</ref> Another found it "a gay, sparkling libretto."<ref>Goldberg, p. 152.</ref> Sidney Dark and Rowland Gray wrote that "the book of ''Thespis'' is genuine Gilbert, the Gilbert whom nowadays all the world loves.... ''Thespis'' once more emphasizes the fact that Gilbert's artistry was hardly affected with the passing of the years. Many of its songs might well have appeared in the later operas." They point out Mercury's "I'm the celestial drudge," which anticipates Giuseppe's "Rising early in the morning" in ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', and find the "real brand of Gilbertian topsy-turvydom" in the song about the former head of a railway company, "I once knew a chap who discharged a function."<ref>Dark & Gray, p. 65.</ref>   Isaac Goldberg thought that "''Thespis'' looks forward far more often than it glances backward. It forecasts the characteristic methods, and now and then a character, of the later series. Its dialogue is comical, and, if anything, somewhat above the heads of the Gaiety audiences of 1871."<ref>Goldberg, p. 148.</ref> 

Goldberg wrote in 1929 that the libretto "seems to have no specific ancestry.... neither in his burlesques nor in his ballads... had Gilbert played with the gods and goddesses of Greek mythology."<ref>Goldberg, p. 146.</ref> However, Gilbert did write a series of humorous sketches parodying the Greek myths, mainly the heroes of the ''[[Iliad]]'', for the illustrated magazine ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' in 1864,<ref>Stedman, p. 23; See also Gilbert, W. S., (1864): ''[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/short_stories/comic_mythologist.htm The Comic Mythologist]'' from ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'', 5 November 1864.</ref> and ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea]]'', which he produced just before ''Thespis'', was a more serious treatment of Greek mythology. Jane W. Stedman points out that ''Thespis'' "looks backward to French ''op<U+00E9>ra bouffe''," but it is "fundamentally a Gilbertian invasion plot in which outsiders penetrate and affect a given society, often for the worse." She compares the theatrical company in ''Thespis'' to the politicians that remodel fairyland in Gilbert's 1873 play ''[[The Happy Land]]'' and the Englishmen who reform the island nation of Utopia in ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893).<ref name=Stedman95/> Elements of ''Thespis'' also appear in Gilbert and Sullivan's last opera together, ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896).<ref>Crowther (2000), p. 165</Ref>

===The music===
Sullivan's score generally came in for praise, though critics carped<U+2014>as they would throughout his life<U+2014>that theatrical scores were beneath his ability. In the ''Standard'', A. E. T. Watson wrote:
{{cquote2|"Mr. John Hollingshead... has judiciously called on Mr. W. S. Gilbert to furnish him with an original opera-extravaganza, and entrusted its musical setting to Mr. Arthur Sullivan. From the association of these two names the most pleasing result has for some weeks past been anticipated, which the success of last evening fully justified.... Mr. Gilbert in 'Thespis' has happily provided the composer with everything he could desire, mastering the character of opera-extravaganza, which precludes the exercise of the highest flights of genius of which a musician is capable and sets a limit to the exercise of his talents.<ref>Fitz-Gerald, pp. 6<U+2013>7.</ref>}}

Clement Scott in the ''Daily Telegraph'' found the opera "not marred by ambitious music." But he added, "Tuneful throughout, always pretty, frequently suggestive, the songs and dances are quite in character with the author's design.... Some of the numbers will certainly live, and the impression caused by the music as a whole is that it will have far more than a passing interest."<ref name=Allen5/>

Many critics praised the originality of the title character's song in the first act about the head of a railway company, which may have been a joke about the [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 3rd Duke of Sutherland|Duke of Sutherland]], "who was fond of running railway engines."<ref>Goldberg, p. 150.</ref>  Scott called the song a "ludicrous ballad," but "quite in the spirit of the well-known compositions of 'Bab,' and, as it has been fitted with a lively tune and a rattling chorus, a hearty encore was inevitable. Though the ditty was long, the audience would have been well content to hear it all over again."<ref name=Allen5/> The ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' found the orchestration "very novel, including, as it does, the employment of a railway bell, a railway whistle, and some new instrument of music imitating the agreeable sound of a train in motion."<ref name=Jacobs73>Jacobs, p. 73.</ref> Similarly ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' noted, "The entire company join in the chorus, the music of which admirably expresses the whirl and thunder of a railway train at express speed."<ref name=Rees64>Rees, p. 64.</ref> ''The Era'' called it "a screaming, whistling and shouting chorus [that] fairly brings down the house."<ref name=Rees64/>

The similarity to French models was much commented upon. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine, historical)|Vanity Fair]]'' thought that "the music in the piece itself is charming throughout, and promises for the first time a rival to Offenbach.... ''Thespis'' is quite as good as ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld|Orph<U+00E9>e aux Enfers]].''"<ref>Rees, p. 58.</ref> Another wrote:
{{cquote2|Mr. W. S. Gilbert and Mr. Arthur Sullivan have attempted, with not a little success, to imitate French comic opera, concerning which we have heard so much for the last half-dozen years.... In these days<U+2014>when the French critics are savagely turning round on us, and calling us pickpockets<U+2014>it is not disagreeable to find that we have authors and musicians quite as talented as our neighbours.... Mr. Sullivan has certainly persuaded us of one thing<U+2014>that a musician can write to any metre.<ref>Lawrence, p. 88.</ref>}}

The ''Morning Advertiser'' thought that "There is an evident attempt to copy the creations of a foreign composer who is so popular at the present time, and who has written some charming music for the gods and goddesses ''en bouffes.''"<ref name=Rees59>Rees, p. 59.</ref> Others accused Sullivan of blatant copying. The ''[[Athenaeum (magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' wrote that the music "was arranged and composed by Mr A. S. Sullivan (the first verb was not in the bills as it ought to have been)...."<ref name=Rees59/> One critic thought that the duet for Sparkeion and Nicemis, "Here far away from all the world," was one of the "single best items of the piece."<ref name=TillettSpencer14>Tillett & Spencer, p. 14.</ref> In 1873, the arranger Joseph Rummell (who had arranged Sullivan's ''Merchant of Venice'' score for the piano) wrote to Sullivan, asking about the song, with a view to publication. The composer replied, "''Thespis'' is not published but if you like I will send you the Full Score of the Duet in question,"<ref>Allen & D'Luhy, p. 67</ref> but nothing came of it.<ref name=TillettSpencer14/>

==Surviving music==
Only three musical passages from ''Thespis'' are known to survive: the ballad "Little maid of Arcadee," the chorus "Climbing over rocky mountain," and the ballet music. The fate of Sullivan's score has long been a subject for speculation. In 1978, [[Isaac Asimov]] wrote a time travel story, "Fair Exchange?" which focused on a character travelling back to 1871 to rescue the score to ''Thespis'' before Sullivan could destroy it.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Asimov | first=Isaac | title=Fair Exchange? | journal=Asimov's Science Fiction Adventure Magazine | pages=56<U+2013>65 | publisher=Davis Publications, Inc | date=Fall 1978}} Also in {{cite book|last=Asimov | first=Isaac | title=Three by Asimov | location=New York | publisher=Targ Editions | date=1981}}  Also in {{cite book|last=Asimov | first=Isaac | title=The Winds of Change and Other Stories  | location=New York | publisher=Doubleday | date =1983 | isbn=0385180993}}</ref> But Sullivan is not known to have destroyed it, and the ballet, at least, was still available to be reused in 1897.<ref>Tillett & Spencer, p. 3.</ref>

===Little maid of Arcadee===
[[Image:Lmaidofarcadee.jpg|left|220px]]Sparkeion's song in Act II, "Little maid of [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadee]]," was the only number from the opera to achieve contemporaneous publication. It was one of four numbers to be encored on the first night. The ''Daily Telegraph'' wrote: "With the public no doubt the musical gem will be a ballad called 'Cousin Robin'<U+2014>pathetic and tender words, with a dreamy and somewhat [[Gounod]]ish air. So sweetly was this sung by Mdlle. Clary that another encore was inevitable."<ref name=Allen5/>  The song enjoyed long-standing popularity. Wyndham writes, "Little maid of Arcadee" was "popular for a quarter of a century,"<ref>Wyndham, p. 119.</ref> while Goldberg notes that it has "long been known as a separate ditty."<ref name=Goldberg151>Goldberg, p. 151.</ref> Sullivan's first biographer suggested that "''Thespis'' will be best remembered by the exquisite musical setting to the simple little Gilbertian ballad, "The Little Maid of Arcadee."<ref>Lawrence, p. 88.</ref>

Several later commentators write favourably of the song. Walbrook finds it "one of the neatest of Gilbert's ditties, packed with cynicism and slyness, expressed in terms of sentimental tenderness."<ref>Walbrook, p. 33.</ref> Goldberg says that it is "dainty, simple and quite in the vein of Gilbert's words, to which, as in almost every later instance, Sullivan's setting provides an original rhythmic piquancy."<ref name=Goldberg151/> Fitz-Gerald considers it "quite a forerunner of Gilbert at his easiest,"<ref>Fitz-Gerald, p. 4.</ref> while Dark and Gray call it "a typically dainty Gilbertian love-song worthy to be compared to the best that he ever wrote."<ref>Dark & Gray, p. 65.</ref> Jacobs dissents: "As music it is as trivial as Sullivan ever wrote."<ref name=Jacobs73/>

The separately published version had several significant wording differences from the theatrical version, owing to "the contrast between the Gaiety Theatre's suggestiveness and the prudery expected in the [[drawing room]]."<ref name=Jacobs73/> In the drawing room version, the song's little maid sat ''by'' Cousin Robin's knee, not ''on'' it. Rather than ''weary of his lover's play'', he became ''fickle as the month of May''. And rather than ''Cousin Richard came to woo'', it was ''till another came to woo.''

===Climbing over rocky mountain===
[[Image:Drawing of Act I Finale.jpg|300px|thumb|"Climbing over rocky mountain" was reused in Gilbert and Sullivan's fifth opera together, ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''.]]
"Climbing over rocky mountain" is the best known piece from ''Thespis'', as it was transplanted in 1879 into one of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s most successful operas, ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''. In 1902, Gilbert told a correspondent that this had happened accidentally. He and Sullivan had arrived in New York to produce the new opera, but the composer discovered that he had left his sketches behind in England. Fortunately, the entrance chorus from ''Thespis'' fitted the situation almost exactly, so it was substituted instead.<ref name=Searle/>

Several scholars have doubted that explanation. In Sullivan's autograph score for the later work, the first part of "Climbing over rocky mountain" is actually taken from a ''Thespis'' copyist score, with the ''Thespis'' words cancelled and the new words written in, which raises the question of why Sullivan had a ''Thespis'' score to hand, if not for that purpose.<ref>Jerry March, "Part of Thespis Score Discovered," ''The Savoyard'', Vol. XX, No. 1 (March 1981), p. 25. Also cited in Stedman, p. 95, n. 52.</ref>

Some suggest that other music from ''Thespis'' could have been used in ''Pirates''. Goldberg suggests that "It is reasonable to believe that Sullivan made generous use of his ''Thespis'' music in other operettas: perhaps owing to the circumstances under which ''The Pirates of Penzance'' was written, it contains more than one unacknowledged borrowing from the unlucky firstling of the lucky pair."<ref name=Goldberg151/> Reginald Allen says that "it seems certain" from its "rhythmic structure," that part of the Act I finale of ''Thespis'', "Here's a pretty tale for future [[Iliad]]s and [[Odyssey]]s" became the original Act II finale in ''Pirates'', "At length we are provided with unusual felicity" (which was later deleted).<ref name=Allen6>Allen, p. 6</ref> Tillett and Spencer propose that most of Act I of ''Pirates'' was taken from ''Thespis''.<ref>Tillett & Spencer (2002).</ref> However, there is only [[circumstantial evidence]] for these suggestions. Except for "Climbing over rocky mountain," neither author admitted to borrowing from ''Thespis'' for later works.<ref>Stedman, pp. 95<U+2013>96.</ref>

===Ballet===
[[Image:Thespis - An Undress Rehearsal.png|An engraving from ''The Graphic'' used by Spencer and Tillett to help identify the missing movements of the ballet.|left|thumb|400px]]A five-movement ballet occurred somewhere in Act II. A heading in the libretto, "Chorus and Ballet", attaches it to the last section of the finale but does not indicate how it figured in the plot. Most press accounts placed it at about this point, although some placed it slightly earlier in the act. At some performances, the ballet was performed in Act I,<ref>[http://www.library.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=4181&Print=18&image=00-3124a.jpg January 1872 programme states "In Act First, A Grand Ballet."]</ref> but it was certainly in Act II on opening night, and it seems finally to have settled there.<ref>Rees, pp. 68-70</ref>

In 1990, Roderick Spencer and Selwyn Tillett discovered the ballet from Act II of ''Thespis''. Two of the of five movements, in the same hand that had copied the score of "Climbing over rocky mountain", were found together with the surviving performance materials for Sullivan's 1864 ballet, ''[[L'<U+00CE>le Enchant<U+00E9>e]]''. Another section was found in the material for his 1897 ballet, ''[[Victoria and Merrie England]]''. The page numbering of the surviving three sections gave approximate lengths for the missing pieces, and a contemporary engraving, seen at left, along with other circumstantial evidence, allowed plausible identifications of the two remaining movements: A dragon costume, used nowhere in the libretto, is presumably from the ballet, and the [[harp]] visible in the orchestra pit was an unusual instrument for the Gaiety's orchestra. Movements of appropriate length that made sense of these oddities were found in Sullivan's other ballets,<ref>Tillett 1998, pp. 28<U+2013>34.</ref> and the reconstructed ballet has been recorded twice on CD.

Sullivan tended to re-use his ballet music. Of the five movements that Tillett and Spencer identified, only one (the Waltz, No. 3) is not known to have been used in any other work. Three of the movements had previously been used in ''L'<U+00CE>le Enchant<U+00E9>e''. Two of those, and one other, were eventually re-used in ''Victoria and Merrie England''. One was also used in his incidental music to ''[[Macbeth]]''.<ref>Tillett 1998, p. 34.</ref> Sullivan was asked in 1889 to supply a ballet for a French-language production of ''[[The Mikado]]'' in Brussels, which he duly did. Tillett suggests that the ''Thespis'' ballet was almost certainly the music that Sullivan provided, given that it was the only ballet that he wrote for use in an opera, and that three weeks after producing ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' he is unlikely to have written something original.<ref>Tillett 1998, pp. 35<U+2013>37.</ref>

==Text==
[[Image:Thespis - He's you're brother.png|thumb|200px|Even the version of the libretto printed in 1911 is not free of sloppy editing. Note the line "He's you're brother."]]
The surviving libretto is not the version heard by audiences at the Gaiety Theatre. There are numerous discrepancies between the original libretto and what was described as happening on stage, and reviewers repeatedly quoted dialogue that has no equivalent in the published libretto. At least one song is missing,<ref>Rees, pp. 67-68</ref> and an entire character, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], is mentioned in at least five reviews as stout, elderly, and heavily made-up, but does not appear in either the programme or the libretto.<ref name=ReesVenus>Rees, pp. 42-43.</ref> Stage directions in the original are slip-shod: characters reappear without an entrance being noted,<ref>Rees, p. 46</ref> or enter twice in quick succession, without having exited.<ref>Rees, pp. 56-57</ref>  In addition, Sullivan told his mother that at least one song was cut after opening night, and there must certainly have been other cuts, given the undue length of the first performance. But the text of the libretto, as published, remained "virtually unchanged" between December 1871 and March 1872.<ref name=Allen26>Allen, p. 26.</ref>

In a letter to Percy Strzelecki on [[April 23]] [[1890]], Gilbert apologized for the condition of the libretto. He wrote, "I was in the United States when it was published & I had no opportunity of correcting proofs. This will explain the presence of innumerable typographical & other errors."<ref name=Allen26/> But several scholars conclude that Gilbert must have been remembering a trip the following year, as in the fall of 1871 it "would have been impossible for Gilbert to travel to America and back in time for rehearsals of ''Thespis''."<ref>Ainger, p. 93; see also Allen, p. 26; Rees, pp. 90<U+2013>91.</ref> Even after the first printing, there does not seem to have been any effort to correct the errors: There were four separate issues of the libretto between December and March, but no corrections were made.<ref name=Allen26/>

Gilbert's final disposition of the libretto came in 1911, when it was included in the fourth volume of his ''Original Plays''.<ref>W. S. Gilbert, ''Original Plays, Fourth Series'', London: Chatto & Windus (1911), pp. 443<U+2013>75.</ref> However, Gilbert died before he could correct proofs for that edition, and so it reprinted the 1871 text, correcting only a few spelling mistakes.<ref>Rees, pp. 90<U+2013>94.</ref>

==Musical numbers==
:''This is the order in which the musical numbers appear in the libretto. The music is known to survive for numbers shown in '''bold'''; a ballet also survives, but its location is uncertain. Reviews of the opera hint at three additional numbers not in the libretto, but as their names and exact locations are unknown, they are not listed.''<ref>Rees, pp. 67-69.</ref></center>
