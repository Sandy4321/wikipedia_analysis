==Outline==
The "Tale of the Eight Hundred and Eight Tanuki Matsuyama Disturbance," was based on the historical record "Iyo Nagusa" (<U+4F0A><U+4E88><U+540D><U+8349>) that told of the [[O-Ie S<U+014D>d<U+014D>]], which occurred during the [[Great Gy<U+014D>h<U+014D> Famine]] in 1805 or Bunka 2, and in the Edo period, and according to the [[K<U+014D>dan|k<U+014D>shaku]] storyteller Nanryuu Tanabe, it was a ghost story that added elements of tanuki and yokai to it, and became known through [[k<U+014D>dan]]. For this reason, there are several variations depending on the which particular k<U+014D>dan storyteller told it,<ref name="<U+6751><U+4E0A>2011">{{Harvnb|<U+6751><U+4E0A>|2011|pp=141<U+2013>144}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081216041750/http://home.e-catv.ne.jp/kaori/tanukikai/osode/osode1.htm |title=<U+677E><U+5C71><U+9A12><U+52D5><U+516B><U+767E><U+516B><U+72F8><U+7269><U+8A9E>|publisher=[http://home.e-catv.ne.jp/kaori/tanukikai/tanukikai1.htm <U+4F0A><U+4E88><U+305F><U+306C><U+304D><U+5B66><U+4F1A> <U+3044><U+3088><U+72F8><U+30B5><U+30ED><U+30F3>] |accessdate=2013-01-06}}<U+FF08>[[<U+30A4><U+30F3><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30CD><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+30FB><U+30A2><U+30FC><U+30AB><U+30A4><U+30D6>]]<U+306B><U+3088><U+308B><U+8A18><U+9332><U+FF09></ref> but the story mainly went as follows.

In [[Shikoku]], there are many folk tales and legends about tanuki, but the tanuki of Matsuyama in particular has a history of them that goes back to the beginning of history in the ages of [[Emperor Tenji]], and as a result of tanuki giving birth to tanuki, there were 808 of them. Its leader was Inugami Gyoubu. Inugami Gyoubu lived in an old cave in [[Kumak<U+014D>gen, Ehime|Kumayama]], and was the bake-danuki that continued to protect the [[Matsuyama Castle (Iyo)|Matsuyama Castle]], and from his household of 808 tanuki, was also called "Eight Hundred and Eight Tanuki (<U+516B><U+767E><U+516B><U+72F8>, Happyakuya-tanuki)."<ref name="<U+6751><U+4E0A>2008">{{Harvnb|<U+6751><U+4E0A>|2008|p=15}}</ref> He was said to have the greatest divine power in Shikoku.<ref name="akari">{{Cite web|date=March 2002|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080221185455/http://www.akari.ne.jp/yon1/02-03/special/main.html|title=<U+56DB><U+56FD><U+306E><U+72F8><U+8A71>|work=[http://www.yonden.co.jp/corporate/ad/l&l/ <U+56DB><U+56FD><U+96FB><U+529B><U+5E83><U+5831><U+8A8C><U+300E><U+30E9><U+30A4><U+30C8>&<U+30E9><U+30A4><U+30D5><U+300F>]|publisher=[[<U+56DB><U+56FD><U+96FB><U+529B>]] |accessdate=2011-09-02 }}<U+FF08><U+30A4><U+30F3><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30CD><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+30FB><U+30A2><U+30FC><U+30AB><U+30A4><U+30D6><U+306B><U+3088><U+308B><U+8A18><U+9332><U+FF09></ref>

His name "[[Ministry of Justice (pre-modern)|Gyoubu]]" was a titled awarded from the preceding lords of the Matsuyama Castle, and he received faith from the vassals of the castle, and had a deep connection to the local people.<ref name="<U+963F><U+90E8>">{{Harvnb|<U+963F><U+90E8>|1968|pp=127<U+2013>132}}</ref> In the era of Matsuyama Oki no Kami (<U+677E><U+5C71><U+96A0><U+5C90><U+5B88>), the O-Ie S<U+014D>d<U+014D> occurred, and Inugami Gyoubu was used by the rebel side, and he gave commands to his follower tanuki to cause strange occurrences to support the insurrection.

However, in the ghost story [[In<U+014D>mono no Roku]], the feudal warrior Budayuu (<U+7A32><U+751F><U+6B66><U+592A><U+592B>) punished Inugami Gyoubu with a divine rod that he received from [[Usa jing<U+016B>|Usa Hachiman<U+3000>Daibosatsu]], and as a result, Inugami Gyoubu and the 808 of his household was sealed in Kumayama.<ref name="<U+5C71><U+7530><U+7DE8>1964">{{Harvnb|<U+5C71><U+7530><U+7DE8>|1964|pp=64<U+2013>67}}</ref><ref name="<U+5C71><U+7530><U+7DE8>1973">{{Harvnb|<U+5C71><U+7530><U+66F8><U+9662><U+7DE8>|1973|pp=103<U+2013>104}}</ref> The cave remains even today in Kutaninagumi (<U+4E45><U+8C37><U+4E2D><U+7D44>), Matsuyama city, and is known as Yamaguchi Reishin (<U+5C71><U+53E3><U+970A><U+795E>).<ref name="<U+6751><U+4E0A>2008" /><ref name="akari" />

==Variation==
As stated previously, the "Tale of the Eight Hundred and Eight Tanuki Matsuyama Disturbance" has several variations, and due to the fact that Inugami Gyoubu, who was supposed to have been the protector of the castle, supported the O-Ie S<U+014D>d<U+014D>, there are various tales about the particulars of how Inugami Gyoubu was defeated by Budayuu.
*As a result of the attempt by young samurai Kotou Kogenda Shoushin (<U+5F8C><U+85E4><U+5C0F><U+6E90><U+592A><U+6B63><U+4FE1>) who was on the rebel side, to slay Inugami Gyoubu who he believed was getting in the way, they made a non-aggression pact that "as long as Inugami Gyoubu lends a hand to Kogenda's crises from then on, Kogenda will not kill Inugami Gyoubu," so when the rebels started to make their moves, Inugami Gyoubu had no choice but to causes strange disturbances in order to fulfill the pact.<ref name="<U+5C71><U+7530><U+7DE8>1964" /> When Budayuu appeared below the castle, Inugami Gyoubu became fearful of Budayuu's divine rod, because when although he wanted to avoid confronting Budayuu as an enemy and transformed him, Budayuu became angry that he was transformed in this way, and made an enemy of the rebels.<ref name="<U+5C71><U+7530><U+7DE8>1964" /><ref name="<U+5C71><U+7530><U+7DE8>1973" />
*Inugami Gyoubu, who didn't think pleasantly of the castle lord at that time who was neglecting the traditions, became close to Kogenda and formed an alliance with him, and began to act to crush the castle's lord.<ref name="<U+963F><U+90E8>" /> Budayuu, who was given a request to defeated the rebellion, entered Matsuyama and headed towards Inugami Gyoubu to make nogotiations, found out that he was working for the rebel side, and defeated him.<ref name="<U+963F><U+90E8>" />
*The rebel side deceived Inugami Gyoubu and treated him as an ally, but it was actually a trap, and when Inugami Gyoubu started his secret maneuvers, and since it was told to the castle lord that all the bad occurrences in the castle Inugami Gyoubu's deeds, he was made out to be a bad guy, and Budayuu, who was called ot help, defeated him.<ref name="<U+6751><U+4E0A>2011" />
*Budayuu did not use a divine rod, but rather a wooden mallet that he received from the head yokai, [[Sanmoto Gorouzaemon]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=[[<U+6751><U+4E0A><U+5065><U+53F8>]]|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061222001738/http://page.freett.com/sekihantaki/tanuf/tanuden/shikoku.html |title=<U+65E5><U+672C><U+300C><U+72F8><U+30FB><U+72E2><U+300D><U+4F1D><U+8AAC><U+4E00><U+89A7> <U+56DB><U+56FD>|work=[http://page.freett.com/sekihantaki/daimoku.html <U+5996><U+602A><U+65B0><U+5929><U+5730>]|publisher=[http://www32.ocn.ne.jp/~kakurezato/index.html <U+5996><U+602A><U+611B><U+597D><U+4F1A><U+96A0><U+308C><U+91CC>]<U+FF08><U+6751><U+4E0A><U+5065><U+53F8><U+4E3B><U+50AC><U+FF09> |accessdate=2011-09-02 }}<U+FF08><U+30A4><U+30F3><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30CD><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+30FB><U+30A2><U+30FC><U+30AB><U+30A4><U+30D6><U+306B><U+3088><U+308B><U+8A18><U+9332><U+3002><U+30DD><U+30C3><U+30D7><U+30A2><U+30C3><U+30D7><U+6CE8><U+610F><U+FF09></ref>
Just the opposite of Inugami Gyoubu being defeated by Budayuu, there are also stories where Inugami Gyoubu stood with the righteous side, but since he was not able to make a dent to the forces of the rebel side, he called Budayuu for help.<ref name="<U+963F><U+90E8>" /> There are also other variations, including stories where Budayuu does not play a part.<ref>{{Cite book|author=<U+6751><U+4E0A><U+5065><U+53F8><U+7DE8><U+8457>|title=<U+65E5><U+672C><U+5996><U+602A><U+5927><U+4E8B><U+5178>|year=2005|publisher=[[<U+89D2><U+5DDD><U+66F8><U+5E97>]]|series=Kwai books|isbn=978-4-04-883926-6|page=38}}</ref>
