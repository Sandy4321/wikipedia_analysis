'''SMS ''K<U+00F6>nig''''' ("His Majesty's ship ''King''") was the first of four [[K<U+00F6>nig class battleship|''K<U+00F6>nig'' class]] [[dreadnought battleship]]s of the [[German Imperial Navy]] (''Kaiserliche Marine'') during [[World War I]]. She was named in honor of [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of [[German Empire|Germany]], who was the king of [[Prussia]] as well as the [[German Emperor]]. Laid down in October 1911, the ship was launched on 1 March 1913. Construction on ''K<U+00F6>nig'' finished shortly after the outbreak of World War I; she was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 9 August 1914.

Along with her three [[sister ship]]s, {{SMS|Grosser Kurf<U+00FC>rst|1913|2}} (or ''Gro<U+00DF>er''<ref group=Note>This is the German "sharp S"; see [[<U+00DF>]].</ref> ''Kurf<U+00FC>rst''), {{SMS|Markgraf||2}}, and {{SMS|Kronprinz|1914|2}}, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' took part in most of the fleet actions during the war. As the leading ship in the German [[line of battle|line]] on 31 May 1916 in the [[Battle of Jutland]], ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was heavily engaged by several British battleships and suffered ten large-caliber shell hits. In October 1917, she forced the Russian [[pre-dreadnought]] battleship [[Russian battleship Slava|''Slava'']] to scuttle itself during [[Operation Albion]].

''K<U+00F6>nig'' was interned, along with the majority of the High Seas Fleet, in [[Scapa Flow]] in November 1918 following the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]] gave the order to scuttle the fleet while the British guard ships were out of the harbor on exercises. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' slipped beneath the waters of Scapa Flow at 14:00. Unlike most of the other scuttled ships, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still sitting on the bottom of the bay.

==Construction and design==
{{main|K<U+00F6>nig class battleship}}
''K<U+00F6>nig'' was ordered under the provisional name "S" and built at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven|Kaiserliche Werft]] dockyards in [[Wilhelmshaven]], under construction number 33.<ref name="Groner27">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 27</ref><ref group=Note>German warships were ordered under provisional names. For new additions to the fleet, they were given a single letter; for those ships intended to replace older or lost vessels, they were ordered as "Ersatz (name of the ship to be replaced)"</ref> Her keel was laid in October 1911 and she was launched on 1 March 1913. [[Fitting-out]] work was completed by 9 August 1914, the day she was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet.<ref name="Groner28">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 28</ref> She had cost the Imperial German Government 45 million [[German gold mark|''Goldmarks'']].<ref name="Groner27"/><ref group=Note>At the time, 1 ''Goldmark'' was the equivalent of US$0.288; this amounted to $12,960,000. Adjusted for inflation, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' cost $295,395,429 in 2009 dollars. See: Herwig "Abbreviations and Conversions" section</ref> The first of what were eventually four ships in her class, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' would later be joined in service by ''Grosser Kurf<U+00FC>rst'', ''Markgraf'', and ''Kronprinz''.<ref group=Note>''Kronprinz'' was later renamed ''Kronprinz Wilhelm''.</ref>

''K<U+00F6>nig'' displaced {{convert|25796|t|ST|abbr=on}} as built and {{convert|28600|t|ST|abbr=on}} fully loaded, with a length of {{convert|175.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a beam of {{convert|19.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a draft of {{convert|9.19|m|ft|abbr=on}}. She was powered by three Parsons [[steam turbines]], which developed a total of 43,300&nbsp;hp (32.3&nbsp;MW) and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|21|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Groner27"/>

She was armed with ten [[30.5 cm SK L/50 gun|30.5&nbsp;cm guns]] arranged in five twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets each fore and aft and one turret amidships between the two funnels.<ref name="Groner28"/> ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was the first German battleship to mount all of her main battery artillery on the centerline. Like the earlier {{sclass|Kaiser|battleship|6}}s, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' could bring all of her main guns to bear on either side, but the newer vessel enjoyed a wider arc of fire due to the all-centerline arrangement.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 147</ref> Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;in) guns, six {{convert|8.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns and five {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam.<ref name="Groner28"/>

Directly after commissioning, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' conducted [[sea trial]]s, which were completed by 23 November 1914.<ref name=S29>Staff, p. 29</ref> Her crew consisted of 41 officers and 1,095 enlisted men.<ref name="Groner28"/> Afterward, the ship was attached to the V Division of the III&nbsp;Battle Squadron of the German High Seas Fleet, where she would later be joined by her sister ships.<ref name="Tarrant, p. 286">Tarrant, p. 286</ref> On 9 December, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' ran aground in the Wilhelmshaven [[roadstead]]. Her sister ship ''Grosser Kurf<U+00FC>rst'', following right behind, rammed her stern and caused some minor damage. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was then freed from the bottom and taken back to Wilhelmshaven; repair work lasted until 2 January 1915.<ref name=S29/>

===Operations in the North Sea===
''K<U+00F6>nig'' took part in several fleet sorties in support of Rear Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]]'s battlecruisers of the [[I Scouting Group]]; however, due to her grounding outside Wilhelmshaven,<ref name=S29/> the ship missed the first operation of these battlecruisers on the night of 15<U+2013>16 December 1914, when they were tasked with bombarding the English coast to lure out a portion of the British [[Grand Fleet]] to the waiting German fleet.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 31<U+2013>33</ref> On 22 January 1915, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' and the rest of III&nbsp;Squadron were detached from the fleet to conduct maneuver, gunnery, and torpedo training in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. They returned to the North Sea on 11 February, too late to assist the I&nbsp;Scouting Group at the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]].<ref name=S29/>

''K<U+00F6>nig'' then took part in several sorties into the North Sea. On 29 March, the ship led the fleet out to [[Terschelling]]. Three weeks later, on 17<U+2013>18 April, she supported an operation in which the [[light cruiser]]s of the II&nbsp;Scouting Group laid [[naval mine|mines]] off the [[Swarte Bank]]. Another fleet advance occurred on 22 April, again with ''K<U+00F6>nig'' in the lead. On 23 April, III&nbsp;Squadron returned to the Baltic for another round of exercises lasting until 10 May. Another minelaying operation was conducted by the II&nbsp;Scouting Group on 17 May, with the battleship again in support.<ref name=S29/>

''K<U+00F6>nig'' participated in a fleet advance into the North Sea which ended without combat from 29 until 31 May. She was then briefly assigned to [[picket duty]] in the German defensive belt. The ship again ran aground on 6 July, though damage was minimal. The ship supported a minelaying operation on 11<U+2013>12 September off [[Texel]]. Another fleet advance followed on 23<U+2013>24 October; after returning, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' went into drydock for maintenance, rejoining the fleet by 4 November.<ref name=S29/> The ship was then sent back to the Baltic for more training on 5<U+2013>20 December. On the return voyage, she was slightly damaged after grounding in the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]] during a snow storm.<ref>Staff, pp. 29<U+2013>30</ref> ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was in the Baltic on 17 January 1916 for further training, then on 24 January returned to the North Sea. Two fleet advances followed on 5<U+2013>6 March and 21<U+2013>22 April.<ref name=S30>Staff, p. 30</ref>

''K<U+00F6>nig'' was available on 24 April 1916 to support [[Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft|a raid on the English coast]], again as support for the German battlecruiser force in the I&nbsp;Scouting Group. The battlecruisers left the Jade Estuary at 10:55, and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13:40. The battlecruiser {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}} struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw.<ref>Tarrant, p. 53</ref> The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the [[Harwich Force]]. A short artillery duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of the I&nbsp;Scouting Group. At this point, Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.<ref>Tarrant, p. 54</ref> ''K<U+00F6>nig'' then went to the Baltic for another round of exercises, including torpedo drills off [[Mecklenburg]].<ref name=S30/>

===Battle of Jutland===
{{Main|Battle of Jutland}}
[[File:Jutland1916.jpg|thumb|350px|Maps showing the maneuvers of the British (blue) and German (red) fleets on 31 May <U+2013> 1 June 1916; [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Jutland1916.jpg click] for a larger view.]]
''K<U+00F6>nig'' was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of [[Jutland]] which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. ''K<U+00F6>nig'', followed by her sisters ''Grosser Kurf<U+00FC>rst'', ''Markgraf'', and ''Kronprinz'', made up the V&nbsp;Division of the III&nbsp;Battle Squadron, and they were the [[wikt:vanguard|vanguard]] of the fleet. The III&nbsp;Battle Squadron was the first of three battleship units; directly astern were the {{Sclass|Kaiser|battleship|1}}s of the VI&nbsp;Division, III&nbsp;Battle Squadron. Directly astern of the ''Kaiser'' class ships were the {{sclass|Helgoland|battleship|5}} and {{sclass|Nassau|battleship|5}} classes of the II&nbsp;Battle Squadron; in the [[rear guard]] were the obsolescent {{sclass|Deutschland|battleship|5}} class pre-dreadnoughts of the I&nbsp;Battle Squadron.<ref name="Tarrant, p. 286"/>

Shortly before 16:00&nbsp;[[Central European Time|CET]],<ref group=Note>The times mentioned in this section are in [[Central European Time|CET]], which is congruent with the German perspective. This is one hour ahead of [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], the time zone commonly used in British works.</ref> the battlecruisers of [[I Scouting Group]] encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|2}}, shortly after 17:00,<ref>Tarrant, pp. 94<U+2013>95</ref> and {{HMS|Queen Mary||2}}, less than half an hour later.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 100<U+2013>101</ref> By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, ''K<U+00F6>nig''{{'}}s crew spotted both the I&nbsp;Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a [[Boxing the compass|two-point]] turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later at 17:46, the order to open fire was given.<ref>Tarrant, p. 110</ref><ref group=Note>The compass can be divided into 32 points, each corresponding to 11.25 degrees. A two-point turn to port would alter the ships' course by 22.5 degrees.</ref>

''K<U+00F6>nig'', ''Grosser Kurf<U+00FC>rst'', and ''Markgraf'' were the first to reach effective gunnery range; they engaged the battlecruisers {{HMS|Lion||2}}, {{HMS|Princess Royal||2}}, and {{HMS|Tiger||2}}, respectively, at a range of 21,000&nbsp;yards.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 110<U+2013>111</ref> ''K<U+00F6>nig''{{'}}s first salvos fell short of her target, and so she shifted her fire to the nearer ''Tiger''. Simultaneously, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' and her sisters began firing on the destroyers {{HMS|Nestor|1915|2}} and {{HMS|Nicator||2}} with their secondary battery.<ref>Tarrant, p. 111</ref> The two destroyers closed in on the German line, and after having endured a hail of gunfire, maneuvered into a good firing position. Each ship launched two torpedoes apiece at ''K<U+00F6>nig'' and ''Grosser Kurf<U+00FC>rst'', although all four weapons missed. In return, a secondary battery shell from one of the battleships hit ''Nestor'' and wrecked her engine room. The ship, along with the destroyer {{HMS|Nomad||2}}, was crippled and lying directly in the path of the advancing German line. Both of the destroyers were sunk, and German torpedo boats stopped to pick up survivors.<ref>Tarrant, p. 114</ref> At around 18:00, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' and her three sister ships shifted their fire to the approaching {{sclass|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|6}}s of the V&nbsp;Battle Squadron. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' initially engaged {{HMS|Barham|04|2}} until that ship was out of range, then shifted to {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}}. However, the faster British battleships were able to move out of effective gunnery range quickly.<ref>Tarrant, p. 116</ref>

Shortly after 19:00, the German cruiser {{SMS|Wiesbaden||2}} had become disabled by a shell from the British battlecruiser {{HMS|Invincible|1908|2}}; Rear Admiral [[Paul Behncke]] in ''K<U+00F6>nig'' attempted to maneuver his four ships to cover the stricken cruiser.<ref>Tarrant, p. 137</ref> Simultaneously, the British III and IV&nbsp;Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered ''Wiesbaden'' with fire from their main guns. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' and her sisters fired heavily on the British cruisers, but even sustained fire from the battleships' main guns failed to drive off the British cruisers.<ref>Tarrant, p. 138</ref> In the ensuing melee, the British armored cruiser {{HMS|Defence|1907|2}} was struck by several heavy caliber shells from the German dreadnoughts. One salvo penetrated the ship's ammunition magazines and, in a massive explosion, destroyed the cruiser.<ref>Tarrant, p. 140</ref>

Shortly after 19:20, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' again entered gunnery range of the battleship {{HMS|Warspite|03|2}} and opened fire on her target. She was joined by the dreadnoughts {{SMS|Friedrich der Grosse|1911|2}}, {{SMS|Ostfriesland||2}}, {{SMS|Helgoland||2}}, and {{SMS|Th<U+00FC>ringen||2}}. However, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' rapidly lost sight of ''Warspite'', as she had been in the process of turning east-northeast.<ref>Tarrant, p. 142<U+2013>143</ref> Nearly simultaneously, British light cruisers and destroyers attempted to make a torpedo attack against the leading ships of the German line, including ''K<U+00F6>nig''. Shortly thereafter, the main British line came into range of the German fleet; at 19:30 the British battleships opened fire on both the German battlecruiser force and the ''K<U+00F6>nig'' class ships. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' came under especially heavy fire during this period. In the span of 5 minutes, {{HMS|Iron Duke||2}} fired 9 salvos at ''K<U+00F6>nig'' from a range of 12,000&nbsp;yards; only one shell hit the ship. The 13.5-inch shell struck the forward conning tower but instead of penetrating, the shell ricocheted off and detonated some 50&nbsp;yards past the ship. Rear Admiral Behncke was injured, though he remained in command of the ship. The ship was then obscured by smoke that granted a temporary reprieve.<ref>Tarrant, p. 145</ref>

By 20:00, the German line was ordered to turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet. ''K<U+00F6>nig'', at the head, completed her turn and then reduced speed to allow the vessels behind her to return to formation. Shortly thereafter, four British light cruisers resumed the attacks on the crippled ''Wiesbaden''; the leading German battleships, including ''K<U+00F6>nig'', opened fire on the cruisers in an attempt to drive them off.<ref>Tarrant, p. 169</ref> The pursuing British battleships had by this time turned further south and nearly managed to [[Crossing the T|"cross the T"]] of the German line. To rectify this situation, Admiral Scheer ordered a 16-point turn south and sent Hipper's battlecruisers on a charge toward the British fleet.<ref>Tarrant, p. 173</ref> During the turn, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was struck by a 13.5-inch shell from ''Iron Duke''; the shell hit the ship just aft of the rearmost gun turret. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' suffered significant structural damage, and several rooms were filled with smoke. During the turn to starboard, Vice Admiral Schmidt, the commander of the I&nbsp;Battle Squadron, decided to turn his ships immediately, instead of following the leading ships in succession. This caused a great deal of confusion, and nearly resulted in several collisions. As a result, many of the German battleships were forced to drastically reduce speed, which put the entire fleet in great danger.<ref>Tarrant, p. 175</ref> In an attempt to mitigate the predicament, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' turned to port and laid a smokescreen between the German and British lines.<ref>Tarrant, p. 177</ref>

During the battle, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' suffered significant damage. A heavy shell penetrated the main armored deck toward the bow. Another shell hit one of the armored plates in the main belt, and shoved it back five feet. Shell splinters penetrated several of the casemates that held the 15&nbsp;cm secondary guns, two of which were disabled. The ammunition stores for these two guns were set on fire and the magazines had to be flooded to prevent an explosion. Other areas of the ship had to be counter-flooded to maintain stability; 1,600&nbsp;tons of water entered the ship, either as a result of battle damage or counter-flooding efforts.<ref>Tarrant, p. 188</ref> The flooding rendered the battleship sufficiently low in the water to prevent the ship from being able to cross the [[Amrun Bank]] until 09:30 on 1 June.<ref>Halpern, p. 327</ref> ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was taken to Kiel for initial repairs, as that was the only location that had a floating dry dock large enough to fit the ship. Repairs were conducted there from 4 June to 18 June, at which point the ship was transferred to the [[Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft|Howaldtswerke]] shipyard. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was again ready to join the fleet by 21 July.<ref>Campbell, p. 336</ref>

===Subsequent operations===
Following completion of repairs, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was again detached to the Baltic for training, from the end of July until early August. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was back in the North Sea on 5 August. A major fleet sortie occurred on 18<U+2013>20 August, with ''K<U+00F6>nig'' again in the lead.<ref name=S30/> The I&nbsp;Scouting Group was to bombard the coastal town of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. However, as {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}} and {{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}} were the only battlecruisers in fighting condition, the new battleship {{SMS|Bayern|1915|2}} and two of ''K<U+00F6>nig''{{'}}s sisters, ''Markgraf'' and ''Grosser Kurf<U+00FC>rst'', were temporarily assigned to the I&nbsp;Scouting Group. Admiral Scheer and the rest of the High Seas Fleet would trail behind providing cover.<ref>Massie, p. 682</ref> The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11&nbsp;weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.<ref>Massie, p. 683</ref>

''K<U+00F6>nig'' remained in port until 21 October, when the ship was again sent to the Baltic for training. The ship returned to the fleet on 3 November. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' and the rest of III&nbsp;Squadron then steamed out to [[Horns Reef]] on 5<U+2013>6 November. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was then assigned various tasks, including guard duty in the [[German Bight]] and convoy escort in the Baltic. 1917 saw several training missions in the Baltic during 22 February <U+2013> 4 March, 14 March <U+2013> 22 March and 17 May <U+2013> 9 June. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' then went into Wilhelmshaven for maintenance on 16 June. The installation of a new heavy foremast and other work lasted until 21 July. On 10 September, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' again went into the Baltic for training maneuvers.<ref name=S30/>

===Operation Albion===
{{Main|Operation Albion}}

In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of [[Riga]], the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the [[Gulf of Riga]]. The ''Admiralstab'' (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of [[Saaremaa|<U+00D6>sel]], and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the [[S<U+00F5>rve Peninsula|Sworbe Peninsula]].<ref>Halpern, p. 213</ref> On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture <U+00D6>sel and [[Muhu|Moon]] Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the [[flagship]], ''Moltke'', along with the III&nbsp;Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. The V&nbsp;Division included the four ''K<U+00F6>nig'' class ships, and was by this time augmented with the new battleship ''Bayern''. The VI&nbsp;Division consisted of the five ''Kaiser'' class battleships. Along with 9 light cruisers, 3 torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of [[naval mine|mine]] warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and 6 zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men.<ref>Halpern, pp. 214<U+2013>215</ref> Opposing the Germans were the old Russian [[pre-dreadnought]]s [[Russian battleship Slava|''Slava'']] and [[Russian battleship Tsesarevich|''Tsarevitch'']], the [[armored cruiser]]s ''Bayan'', ''Admiral Makarov'', and ''Diana'', 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on <U+00D6>sel numbered some 14,000 men.<ref name="Halpern215">Halpern, p. 215</ref>

''K<U+00F6>nig'' departed Kiel on 23 September for [[Putziger Wiek]], where the ship remained until 10 October.<ref name=S30/> The operation began on 12 October; at 03:00 ''K<U+00F6>nig'' anchored off <U+00D6>sel in Tagga Bay and disembarked soldiers. By 05:50, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' opened fire on Russian coastal artillery emplacements,<ref name=S31>Staff, p. 31</ref> joined by ''Moltke'', ''Bayern'', and the other three ''K<U+00F6>nig'' class ships. Simultaneously, the ''Kaiser'' class ships engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula; the objective was to secure the channel between Moon and [[Hiiumaa|Dag<U+00F6>]] islands, which would block the only escape route of the Russian ships in the Gulf. Both ''Grosser Kurf<U+00FC>rst'' and ''Bayern'' struck mines while maneuvering into their bombardment positions, with minimal damage to the former.   ''Bayern'' was severely wounded, and had to be withdrawn to [[Kiel]] for repairs.<ref name="Halpern215"/> At 17:30, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' departed the area to refuel; she returned to the Irben Strait on 15 October.<ref name=S31/>

On 16 October, it was decided to detach a portion of the invasion flotilla to clear the Russian naval forces in Moon Sound; these included the two Russian pre-dreadnoughts. To this end, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' and ''Kronprinz'', along with the cruisers {{SMS|Strassburg||2}} and {{SMS|Kolberg||2}} and a number of smaller vessels, were sent to engage the Russian battleships. They arrived by the morning of 17 October, but a deep Russian minefield thwarted their progress.  The Germans were surprised to discover that the 30.5&nbsp;cm guns of the Russian battleships out-ranged their own 30.5&nbsp;cm guns.<ref group=Note>The Russian ships had had their main battery turrets modified to allow elevation of the guns to 30<U+00B0>. This was much greater than the elevation of the German guns. See: Halpern, p. 218</ref> The Russian ships managed to keep the distance wide enough to prevent the German battleships from being able to return fire, while still firing effectively on the German ships, and the Germans had to take several evasive maneuvers to avoid the Russian shells. However, by 10:00, the minesweepers had cleared a path through the minefield, and ''K<U+00F6>nig'' and ''Kronprinz'' dashed into the bay. By 10:13, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was in range of ''Slava'' and quickly opened fire. Meanwhile, ''Kronprinz'' fired on both ''Slava'' and the cruiser ''Bayan''. The Russian vessels were hit dozens of times, until at 10:30 the Russian naval commander, [[Mikhail Bakhirev|Admiral Bakhirev]], ordered their withdrawal.<ref name=H218>Halpern, p. 218</ref> ''K<U+00F6>nig'' had hit ''Slava'' seven times; the damage inflicted prevented her from escaping to the north.<ref name=S31/> Instead, she was scuttled and her crew was evacuated on a destroyer.<ref name=H218/> In the course of the engagement, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' struck the cruiser ''Bayan'' once. Following the engagement, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' fired on shore batteries on Woi and Werder.<ref name=S31/>

On 20 October, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was towed by mine sweepers into the Kuiwast roadstead.<ref name=H219/> ''K<U+00F6>nig'' transferred soldiers to the island of Schildaum which was then occupied.<ref name=S31/> By that time, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, <U+00D6>sel, and Dag<U+00F6> were in German possession. The previous day, the ''Admiralstab'' had ordered the cessation of naval actions and the return of the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible.<ref name=H219>Halpern, p. 219</ref> On the return voyage, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' struck bottom in a heavy swell. The ship was repaired in Kiel; the work lasted until 17 November.<ref name=S31/>

===Final operations===
Following ''K<U+00F6>nig''{{'}}s return from the Baltic, the ship was tasked with guard duties in the North Sea and with providing support for minesweepers. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' returned to the Baltic on 22 December for further training, which lasted until 8 January 1918. Another round of exercises was conducted from 23 February to 11 March. On 20 April ''K<U+00F6>nig'' steamed out to assist a German patrol that was engaged with British forces. The ship was part of the force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23<U+2013>25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser ''Moltke'' suffered mechanical damage. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' was briefly grounded in the northern harbor of the island of [[Helgoland]] on 30 May. Two months later, on 31 July, ''K<U+00F6>nig'' and the rest of III&nbsp;Squadron covered a minesweeping unit in the North Sea. The ship then went to the Baltic for training on 7<U+2013>18 August, after which ''K<U+00F6>nig'' returned to the North Sea. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' conducted her last exercise in the Baltic starting on 28 September; the maneuvers lasted until 1 October.<ref name=S31/>

''K<U+00F6>nig'' was to have taken part in a final fleet action days before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|Armistice]], an operation which envisioned the bulk of the High Seas Fleet sortieing from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet. To retain a better bargaining position for Germany, Admirals Hipper and Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, whatever the cost to the fleet.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 280<U+2013>281</ref> On 29 October 1918, the order was given to depart from Wilhelmshaven to consolidate the fleet in the [[Jade Estuary|Jade]] roadstead, with the intention of departing the following morning. However, starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on {{SMS|Th<U+00FC>ringen||2}} mutinied.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 281<U+2013>282</ref> [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|The unrest spread]] to other battleships, including ''K<U+00F6>nig''.<ref name=S31/> The operation was ultimately canceled; in an attempt to suppress the mutiny, Admiral Scheer ordered the fleet be dispersed.<ref>Tarrant, p. 282</ref> ''K<U+00F6>nig'' and the rest of III&nbsp;Squadron were sent to Kiel. During the subsequent mutiny, ''K<U+00F6>nig''{{'}}s captain was wounded three times, and both her first officer and adjutant were killed.<ref name=S31/>

===Fate===
[[File:Internment at Scapa Flow.svg|thumb|400px|Map of the scuttled ships showing ''K<U+00F6>nig'' (#7); [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/92/Internment_at_Scapa_Flow.svg click] for a larger view|alt=A map designating the locations where the German ships were sunk.]]
Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]], were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow.<ref>Tarrant, p. 282</ref> Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral [[Adolf von Trotha]] made clear to von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions.<ref name=H256>Herwig, p. 256</ref> The fleet rendezvoused with the British [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Cardiff||2}}, which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships.<ref>Herwig, pp. 254<U+2013>255</ref> Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks.<ref>Herwig, p. 255</ref>

The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the [[Versailles Treaty]]. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|ordered the ships to be sunk]]. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.<ref name=H256/> ''K<U+00F6>nig'' sank at 14:00; the ship was never raised for scrapping, unlike most of the other capital ships that were scuttled. The rights to future salvage operations on the wreck were sold to Britain in 1962.<ref name="Groner28"/>
