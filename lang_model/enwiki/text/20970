"'''Running Back'''" is the debut single by Australian [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] recording artist [[Jessica Mauboy]], which features American rapper [[Flo Rida]]. It was written by Mauboy, [[Audius Mtawarira]], and [[Snob Scrilla|Sean Ray Mullins]], and was produced by Audius. "Running Back" was released for [[music download|digital download]] on 19 September 2008, as the [[lead single]] from Mauboy's debut studio album, ''[[Been Waiting]]''.

The song peaked at number&nbsp;three on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Singles Chart]] and was certified double Platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA), for shipments of 140,000 units.
