[[Image:Morrell.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Captain Benjamin Morrell, who claimed to have sighted New South Greenland]]
'''New South Greenland''', sometimes known as '''Morrell's Land''', was an [[phantom island|appearance of land]] recorded by the American  captain Benjamin Morrell of the [[schooner]] ''Wasp'' in March 1823, during a [[seal hunting|sealing]] and exploration voyage in the [[Weddell Sea]] area of [[Antarctica]].  In his book ''A Narrative of Four Voyages'', written nine years later, Morrell gives precise coordinates and a rough description of a coastline which he claimed to have sailed along for more than {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=2}}.

At the time of Morrell's voyage, the geography of the then unnamed Weddell Sea and its surrounding coasts was almost entirely unknown, making his claimed sighting plausible.  However, Morrell had the reputation of a fabulist, and there were clear errors in his voyage account which damaged his credibility and created doubts about his various claims. Because the Weddell Sea area was so little visited, and hard to navigate due to ice conditions, the alleged land was never properly investigated before its existence was emphatically disproved during Antarctic expeditions in the early 20th century.   In June 1912 the German explorer [[Wilhelm Filchner]] searched for but found no traces of land, after his ship ''Deutschland'' became icebound in the Weddell Sea and drifted into the locality of Morrell's observation. A [[sounding line|sounding]] of the sea bottom revealed more than {{convert|5000|ft|m|sigfig=2}} of water, indicating no land in near proximity. Three years later, trapped in the same waters with his ship [[Endurance (1912 ship)|''Endurance'']], [[Ernest Shackleton]] was able by similar means to confirm the land's non-existence.

Various possible explanations for Morrell's  error have been suggested, including intentional deception. However, Morrell describes his find briefly and prosaically, evidently seeking no personal credit or glory from the discovery. In his narrative he assigns the honour to his fellow sealing captain, Robert Johnson, for finding and naming the land two years earlier. Morrell may have been honestly mistaken, through miscalculation of his ship's position or by misremembering detail when writing the account after nine years. Alternatively, he may have made the common error of confusing distant icebergs with land, or been misled by the distorting effects of Antarctic mirage.  In 1843 the distinguished British naval explorer [[James Clark Ross]] reported possible land in a position close to Morrell's; this land, too, would eventually be proven not to exist.

At 2 pm next day, 15 March, as ''Wasp'' cruised north-east in the sea that would later bear Weddell's name, Morrell records: "land was seen from the masthead, bearing west, distance 3 leagues" (about nine miles, 14&nbsp;km).<ref name= Morrell69>{{cite web|last= Morrell|first= Benjamin|title= A Narrative of Four Voyages...etc|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&id=g0AGAAAAMAAJ&dq=Benjamin+Morrell&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=3Ez1sGL5po&sig=zqd1JhQsQYWWGhaITYuv3cDPghE&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result|publisher= J & J Harper, New York|date= 1832|accessyear= 2009|accessdaymonth= 17 December}} (pp. 69&ndash;70)</ref> His account continues: "At half past 4 pm we were close on with the body of land to which Captain Johnson had given the name of New South Greenland".<ref name= Morrell69/><ref>{{cite web|last= Simpson-Housley|first= Paul|title= Antarctica:Exploration, Perception and Metaphor|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M1ql3mx8xYgC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=New+South+Greenland+Antarctic&source=web&ots=LPFkfBi31s&sig=EyMxRrj2KQJciUtj0CsFW0QaSZw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result|publisher= Routledge, New York|date= 1992|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 17 December}}(Map, p. 52)</ref> Robert Johnson, a former captain of the ''Wasp'', had made an exploratory voyage along the western coast of the [[Antarctic peninsula]] in 1821, calling it "New South Greenland".<ref name= WJM/><ref>Johnson's name for this land was never adopted; in 1831 it was named [[Graham Land]] H R Mill, pp. 161&ndash;62.</ref> Morrell's casual reference to Johnson indicates that he assumed the land he was now seeing was the east coast of the peninsula, the geographical character and dimensions of which were not then known (his actual position was about 14<U+00B0> east of the peninsula).<ref>H R Mill, p. 109</ref>  Morrell describes seal hunting activities continuing along this putative coast during the remainder of the day. On the following morning  sealing resumed as the ship moved slowly southward, and continued until Morrell called a halt "because of shortage of water and season far advanced".<ref name= Morrell69/> Mountains of snow, he observed, could be discerned about {{convert|75|mi|km|sigfig=2}} further south.<ref name= Morrell69/>

Morrell turned north from a position he calculated as 67<U+00B0>52'S, 48<U+00B0>11W. Three days later, on 19 March, the ship passed what he took to be the northern cape of the land, at 62<U+00B0>41'S, 47<U+00B0>21'W. "This land abounds with oceanic birds of every description", wrote Morrell.<ref name= Morrell69/>  He also records seeing 3,000 [[elephant seals|sea elephants]]. At 10 o'clock ''Wasp'' "bade farewell to the cheerless shores of New South Greenland";<ref name= Morrell69/> there is no further mention of it in the long voyage account. ''Wasp'' sailed for [[Tierra del Fuego]], then through the [[Magellan Strait]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]], finally reaching  [[Valparaiso]], Chile, where the first of the four voyages ended on 26 July 1823.<ref name= Morrell69/>

From the first navigations of the Southern Ocean in the 16th century, lands which subsequently proved to be nonexistent were  from time to time reported in these waters.<ref>See list of reported lands and islands in: {{cite web|title= Non-existent islands (in Summary of Peri-Antarctic Islands)|url= http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/resources/infosheets/19.html|publisher= Scott Polar Research Institute|date= 1996|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 17 December}}</ref> Polar historian Robert Headland of the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] has suggested various reasons for these false sightings, ranging from "too much rum" to deliberate hoaxes designed to lure rival ships away from good sealing grounds.

It is also possible that some of these lands existed, but later became submerged after volcanic eruptions.

[[Image:1894 map of Antactica.jpg|thumb|left|1894 maps of Antarctic regions showing the limited knowledge of Antarctic geography 70 years after Morrell. The lower map marks Ross's Appearance, but not New South Greenland]]
Doubt was cast over the existence of New South Greenland when, in 1838, the French explorer [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] sailed over the position of Morrell's "north cape", but saw no indication of land.<ref name = Gould266>Gould, pp. 266&ndash;67</ref> This evidence, and the general nature of Morrell's account&mdash;its obvious errors, and his reputation as a braggart "as great [...] as any hero of autobiographical romance" in the words of British geographer [[Hugh Robert Mill]], led many geographers thereafter to ignore his claims.<ref>H R Mill, pp. 104&ndash;05</ref> This scepticism remained even after Sir James Clark Ross reported an appearance of land in 1843, not far from Morrell's alleged observation: Ross's sighting was occasionally proffered as supportive of Morrell's claim.<ref name= Gould266/><ref>{{cite web|title= History of SANAE: chronological exploration|url= http://www.sanap.org.za/history.html|publisher= South African National Antarctic Programme|date= 2007|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 17 December}}</ref> There was no further penetration of the Weddell Sea until 1903, when [[William Speirs Bruce]] took ''Scotia'' to 74<U+00B0>1'S, but in a sector of the sea which did not bring him close to Morrell's or Ross's sightings.<ref>Speak, p. 92.

The first determined search for New South Greenland came during the [[Second German Antarctic Expedition]], 1911&ndash;13, under Wilhelm Filchner. The expedition's ship, ''Deutschland'', had become trapped in heavy sea ice while attempting to establish a shore base at [[Vahsel Bay]]. Her subsequent north-westerly drift had, by mid-June 1912, brought her to a position {{convert|37|mi|km}} east of Morrell's recorded sighting.<ref name= Filch>{{cite web|title= Wilhelm Filchner 1877&ndash;1957|publisher= South-pole.com|url= http://www.south-pole.com/p0000103.htm|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 18 December}}</ref> Filchner left the ship on 23 June and, with two companions and sufficient provisions for three weeks, sledged westward across the sea ice in search of Morrell's land. Daylight was limited to two or three hours a day, and temperatures fell to -31 <U+00B0>F (-35 <U+00B0>C),  making travel difficult. In these conditions the group covered {{convert|31|mi|km}}, taking frequent sightings.<ref name= Filch/> They found no signs of land; a lead weight dropped through the ice reached a depth of {{convert|5248|ft|m}} before the line snapped, a depth which confirmed there was no land in the vicinity. Filchner concluded that what Morrell had seen had been a mirage.<ref name= Filch/>

On  17 August 1915 Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship ''Endurance'', trapped in the ice like ''Deutschland'' three years earlier, drifted to a point 10&nbsp;miles west of Morrell's charted position. Here, a depth sounding recorded 1,676&nbsp;fathoms (10,000&nbsp;feet, 3,000&nbsp;m), leading Shackleton to write: "I decided that Morrell Land must be added to the long list of Antarctic islands and continental coasts that have resolved themselves into icebergs".<ref name= Shack/> On 25 August a further sounding of 1,900&nbsp;fathoms (11,400&nbsp;feet, 3,500&nbsp;m) gave Shackleton additional evidence of the non-existence of New South Greenland.<ref name = Shack>Shackleton, pp. 60&ndash;61</ref>

==Opinions and theories==
[[Image: Weddell Sea Iceberg.jpg|thumb|Weddell Sea iceberg in the region of "New South Greenland", ''Endurance '' expedition August 1915. Shackleton observed how land appearances frequently resolved into icebergs.]]
According to W.J. Mills, Morrell had the reputation among his contemporaries as "the biggest liar in the Southern Ocean".<ref name= WJM/> Mills calls the westward journey from Morrell's  claimed farthest east position "impossible [...] unbelievably fast, quite apart from lying south of the coastline for much of the way".<ref name= WJM/> In search of an explanation Mills suggests that since Morrell's account was written nine years after the voyage he may not have had access to the ship's log, and hence may "have felt constrained to invent details that appeared plausible" in order to sustain his narrative.<ref name= WJM/>  This would explain the profusion of positional and date errors.<ref name= WJM/>

Hugh Robert Mill, writing in 1905 before the non-existence of New South Greenland had been proved conclusively, refers to the sheer absurdity of some of the incidents described in Morrell's account, and concludes that because of Morrell's blunders, and his habit of incorporating the experiences of others into his story, all his claims must be treated as not proven.<ref>H R Mill, p. 111</ref> Nevertheless he concedes that "a man may be ignorant, boastful and obscure, and yet have done a solid piece of work".<ref>H R Mill, p. 105</ref> Canadian geographer Paul Simpson-Housley adopts a more sympathetic approach. Although dubious about much of Morrell's account, Simpson-Housley suggests that the speeds claimed for the western journey, though fast, are not impossible.<ref name= Housley57>{{cite web|last= Simpson-Housley|first= Paul|title= Antarctica:Exploration, Perception and Metaphor|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M1ql3mx8xYgC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=New+South+Greenland+Antarctic&source=web&ots=LPFkfBi31s&sig=EyMxRrj2KQJciUtj0CsFW0QaSZw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result|publisher= Routledge, New York|date= 1992|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 17 December}}(pp. 57&ndash;690</ref>  He believes that the claimed farthest south in the Weddell Sea, queried by Mill,<ref>H R Mill, p. 109. Mill is particularly sceptical about the water and air temperatures reported by Morrell at the 70<U+00B0>S latitude, which are 10 to 15 degrees higher than what would be expected so far south at that time of year.</ref>   is entirely plausible, given that James Weddell had sailed four degrees further south just a month earlier.<ref name= Housley57/>

Another inclined to defend Morrell's integrity is the writer Rupert Gould, who included a lengthy essay on New South Greenland in his collection ''Enigmas'', published in 1929.<ref>See Sources for full publication details</ref> The assumption that the New South Greenland sighting was simply invented by Morrell is dismissed, primarily on the grounds of the very little weight given to the discovery in Morrell's 500-page account. Gould writes: "If Morrell wished to gain an undeserved reputation as an Antarctic explorer, one would think he could have gone a better way about it than to bury his ''pi<U+00E8>ces justificatives'', after he had forged them, in an undistinguished  corner of so bulky a book."<ref>Gould, p.268</ref> In the relatively few pages devoted to the Antarctic, Morrell's account of his discovery is brief and entirely matter-of-fact, crediting it to Captain Johnson two years earlier rather than to himself.<ref name= Housley57/>
[[Image:Approaching the Larsen Ice Shelf.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Larsen Ice Shelf]], on the eastern coast of the Antartic peninsula]]
Gould also discusses the possibility that what Morrell sighted was indeed the eastern coast of Graham Land, the so-called "Foyn coast",<ref>Gould uses the term "Foyn coast" to describe the whole east coast of Graham Land. The Foyn coast is actually only a short stretch of this coast, approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} long, separated from the Weddell Sea by the [[Larsen Ice Shelf]]. See Stonehouse, p. 107</ref> despite its being 14<U+00B0> further west from position of the New South Greenland sighting. In support, Gould asserts that the peninsula's eastern coast corresponds very closely with the stretch of coastline described by Morrell.<ref>Gould, pp. 277&ndash;78</ref> This theory supposes that Morrell miscalculated the ship's position, perhaps because he lacked the chronometer necessary for proper navigational observation. In his account Morrell writes that he was "destitute of the various nautical and mathematical instruments",<ref>{{cite web|last= Morrell|first= Benjamin|title= A Narrative of Four Voyages...etc|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&id=g0AGAAAAMAAJ&dq=Benjamin+Morrell&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=3Ez1sGL5po&sig=zqd1JhQsQYWWGhaITYuv3cDPghE&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result|publisher= J & J Harper, New York|date= 1832|accessyear= 2009|accessdaymonth= 27 December}}(p. 67)</ref> but other parts of his narrative make it clear that the occasional [[dead reckoning]] calculation was the exception to the norm.<ref>Gould, p. 276</ref> In any circumstances a longitudinal error of 14<U+00B0> is very large, and the additional distance of about {{convert|350|mi|km}} to the Foyn coast seems too great to have been covered within the ten-day voyage from the South Sandwich Islands, where the ship's position is recorded accurately.<ref name= Housley57/> Even so, Gould maintains that a "balance of evidence" shows that what Morrell saw was the Foyn coast.<ref>Gould, pp. 280&ndash;81</ref>

Filchner's view that the supposed sighting of New South Greenland could be explained by a mirage is echoed by Simpson-Housley. He suggests that Morrell and his crew saw a [[Mirage#Superior Mirage|superior mirage]].<ref name= Housley57/> One form of superior mirage, sometimes described as a [[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana]], distorts distant flat coastlines or ice edges both vertically and horizontally, so they can appear to have tall cliffs and other features such as high mountain peaks and valleys.<ref>{{cite web|title= Arctic Climatology and Meteorology &ndash; Superior Mirage|url= http://nsidc.org/arcticmet/basics/phenomena/superior_mirage.html|publisher= National Snow and Ice Data Center|accessyear= 2008|accessdaymonth= 19 December}}</ref> In his expedition account ''South'', Shackleton gives a description of a Fata Morgana observed on 20 August 1915, coincidentally as his ship ''Endurance'' drifted close to the recorded position of New South Greenland: "The distant pack is thrown up into towering barrier-like cliffs, which are reflected in blue lakes and lanes of water at their base. Great white and golden cities of Oriental appearance at close intervals along these cliff-tops indicate distant bergs [...] The lines rise and fall, tremble, dissipate, and reappear in an endless transformation scene".<ref>Shackleton, pp. 60&ndash;61</ref>

Morrell's four voyages finally ended on 21 August 1831, with his return to New York.<ref>{{cite web|last= Morrell|first= Benjamin|title= A Narrative of Four Voyages...etc|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&id=g0AGAAAAMAAJ&dq=Benjamin+Morrell&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=3Ez1sGL5po&sig=zqd1JhQsQYWWGhaITYuv3cDPghE&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result|publisher= J & J Harper, New York|date= 1832|accessyear= 2009|accessdaymonth= 17 December}} (p. 492)</ref><ref>''Wasp'' was replaced after the first voyage, ''Tartar'' was used in te second voyage, ''Antarctic'' in the third and fourth.</ref> He then wrote his ''Narrative of Four Voyages'', which was published the following year.
