'''George Wilcken Romney''' (July 8, 1907{{ndash}} July 26, 1995) was an [[United States|American]] [[businessman]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] [[politician]]. He was chairman and president of [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] from 1954 to 1962, the [[List of Governors of Michigan|43rd]] [[Governor of Michigan]] from 1963 to 1969, and the [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] from 1969 to 1973.  He is the father of former [[Governor of Massachusetts]] [[Mitt Romney]] and the husband of former Michigan U.S. Senate candidate [[Lenore Romney]].

Romney was born to American parents living in the [[Mormon colonies in Mexico]]; events during the [[Mexican Revolution]] forced his family to flee back to the United States when he was a child.  The family lived in several states and ended up in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], where they struggled during the [[Great Depression]].  Romney worked in a number of jobs, served as a [[Mormon missionary]] in [[England]] and [[Scotland]], and attended two universities in the U.S. but did not graduate from either.  In 1939 he moved to [[Detroit]] and joined the [[Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers|American Automobile Manufacturers Association]], where he served as the chief spokesperson for the automobile industry during [[World War II]] and headed a cooperative arrangement in which companies could share production improvements.  He joined [[Nash-Kelvinator Corporation|Nash-Kelvinator]] in 1948, and became the chief executive of its successor, [[American Motors Corporation]], in 1954.  There he turned around the struggling firm by focusing all efforts on the compact [[Rambler (automobile)#1958-1969|Rambler]] car.  Romney mocked the products of the "[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)#United States and Canada|Big Three]]" automakers as "gas-guzzling dinosaurs" and became one of the first high-profile, media-savvy business executives.  Devoutly religious, Romney presided over the [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|Detroit Stake]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

Romney entered politics by participating in a state [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] to rewrite the [[Michigan Constitution]] during 1961<U+2013>1962.  He was elected Governor of Michigan in 1962 and was re-elected by increasingly large margins in 1964 and 1966.  Romney worked to overhaul the state's financial and revenue structure, culminating in Michigan's first [[state income tax]], and greatly expanded the size of state government.  Romney was a strong supporter of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]].  He briefly represented moderate Republicans against conservative Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] during the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964&nbsp;U.S. presidential election]].  He requested the intervention of federal troops during the [[1967 Detroit riot]].

Romney was [[George Romney presidential campaign, 1968|a candidate for the Republican nomination]] for President of the United States in 1968.  While initially a front-runner, he proved an ineffective campaigner, and fell behind [[Richard Nixon]] in polls.  Following a mid-1967 remark that his earlier support for the [[Vietnam War]] had been due to a "brainwashing" by U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Vietnam, his campaign faltered even more, and he withdrew from the contest in early 1968.  Once elected president, Nixon appointed Romney Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.  Romney's ambitious plans for housing production increases for the poor, and for open housing to desegregate suburbs, were modestly successful but often thwarted by Nixon.  Romney left the administration at the start of Nixon's second term in 1973.  Returning to private life, Romney advocated volunteerism and public service, and served as a [[regional representative of the Twelve]] within his church.

In 1913, the family moved to [[Oakley, Idaho]], and bought a farm, where they grew and subsisted largely on [[Idaho potato]]es.<ref name="mahoney-64">Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 63<U+2013>65.</ref><ref>Harris, ''Romney's Way'', p. 46.</ref>  The farm was not on good land and failed when potato prices fell.<ref name="mahoney-64"/> The family moved to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], in 1916, where Gaskell Romney resumed construction work, but the family remained generally poor.<ref name="mahoney-64"/>  In 1917, they moved to [[Rexburg, Idaho]], where Gaskell became a successful home and commercial builder in an area growing due to high [[World War I]] commodities prices.<ref name="mahoney-66">Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 65<U+2013>67.</ref>

==Missionary work==
After becoming an [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]], Romney earned enough money working to fund himself as a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|Mormon missionary]].<ref name="mahoney-76"/>  In October 1926, he sailed to Great Britain and was first assigned to preach in a [[Glasgow]], Scotland, slum.<ref name="mahoney-76">Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 73<U+2013>76.</ref> The abject poverty and hopelessness he saw there affected him greatly,<ref name="gwr-ssps"/> but he was ineffective in gaining converts and temporarily suffered a [[crisis of faith]].<ref>Harris, ''Romney's Way'', pp. 76<U+2013>77.</ref>

In February 1927, he was shifted to [[Edinburgh]] and in February 1928 to London,<ref name="mahoney-79">Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 77<U+2013>81.</ref> where he kept track of mission finances.<ref name="harris-78">Harris, ''Romney's Way'', pp. 78, 81.</ref> He worked under renowned [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] intellectuals [[James E.

In August 1928, Romney became president of the Scottish missionary district.<ref name="mahoney-83"/>  Operating in a [[whisky]]-centric region was difficult, and he developed a new "task force" approach of sending more missionaries to a single location at a time; this successfully drew local press attention and several hundred new recruits.<ref name="harris-78"/><ref name="mahoney-83"/> Romney's frequent public proselytizing&nbsp;<U+2013> from [[The Mound|Edinburgh's Mound]] and in London from soap boxes at [[Speakers' Corner]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and from a platform at [[Trafalgar Square]]&nbsp;<U+2013> developed his gifts for debate and sales, which he would use the rest of his career.<ref name="cby-367"/><ref name="nyt-course"/><ref name="mahoney-79"/> Three decades later, Romney said that his missionary time had meant more to him in developing his career than any other experience.<ref name="mahoney-76"/>

==Early career==
Romney returned to the U.S. in late 1928 and studied briefly at the [[University of Utah]] and [[LDS Business College]].<ref name="mahoney-89">Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 89<U+2013>94.</ref>  He followed LaFount to [[Washington, D.C.]], in fall 1929, after her father had accepted an appointment by President [[Calvin Coolidge]] to serve on the [[Federal Radio Commission]].<ref name="nyt-course"/><ref name="bg-series-1"/><ref name="mahoney-89"/>  He worked for [[Massachusetts]] Democratic [[U.S. Senator]] [[David I.

With one of his brothers, Romney opened a [[Milk bar#Similar establishments|dairy bar]] in nearby [[Virginia]] during this time.

In the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964&nbsp;U.S. presidential election]], Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] quickly became the likely Republican Party nominee.  Goldwater represented a new wave of [[American conservatism]], of which the moderate Romney was not a part.<ref name="nyt-impatient"/>  Romney also felt that Goldwater would be a drag on Republicans running in the all the other races that year, including Romney's own<ref name="nyt-impatient"/> (at the time, Michigan had two-year terms for its governor).<ref name="nyt010367"/> Finally, Romney disagreed strongly with Goldwater's views on civil rights; he would later say, "Whites and Negroes, in my opinion, have ''got'' to learn to know each other. Barry Goldwater didn't have any background to understand this, to fathom them, and I couldn't get through to him."<ref name="white-1968-37"/>

During the June 1964 [[National Governors' Conference]], 13 of 16 Republican governors present were opposed to Goldwater; their leaders were [[Jim Rhodes]] of Ohio, [[Nelson Rockefeller]] of New York (whose own campaign had just stalled out with a loss to Goldwater in the California primary), [[William Scranton]] of Pennsylvania, and Romney.<ref name="white-1964-154">White, ''The Making of the President, 1964'', pp. 154<U+2013>155, 157.</ref>  In an unusual Sunday press conference,<ref name="nyt-impatient"/> Romney declared, "If [Goldwater's] views deviate as indicated from the heritage of our party, I will do everything within my power to keep him from becoming the party's presidential nominee."<ref name="white-1964-154"/>  Romney had, however, previously vowed to Michigan voters that he would not run for president in 1964.<ref name="white-1964-160">White, ''The Making of the President, 1964'', p. 160.</ref>  Detroit newspapers indicated they would not support him in any such bid, and Romney quickly decided to honor his pledge to stay out of the contest.<ref name="white-1964-160"/>  Scranton entered instead, but Goldwater prevailed decisively at the [[1964 Republican National Convention]].

On August 31, 1967, in a taped interview with talk show host [[Lou Gordon (journalist)|Lou Gordon]] of [[WKBD-TV]] in Detroit, Romney stated: "When I came back from Viet Nam [in November 1965], I'd just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get." He then shifted to opposing the war: "I no longer believe that it was necessary for us to get involved in South Vietnam to stop Communist aggression in Southeast Asia."  Decrying the "tragic" conflict, he urged "a sound peace in South Vietnam at an early time." Thus Romney disavowed the war and reversed himself from his earlier stated belief that the war was "morally right and necessary".<ref name="johns">{{cite journal | first=Andrew L. | last=Johns | title=Achilles' Heel: The Vietnam War and George Romney's Bid for the Presidency, 1967 to 1968 | journal=Michigan Historical Review | volume= 26 | year=2000 | pages=1<U+2013>29 | doi=10.2307/20164896 | issue=1}}</ref>

After the election, Nixon named Romney to be [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD).

Milliken continued Romney's model of downplaying party label and ideology, and Republicans held onto the governorship for three more terms until 1983, though Michigan was one of the nation's most blue-collar states.<ref>Witcover, ''Marathon'', p. 424.</ref>

As secretary, Romney conducted the first reorganization of the department since its 1966 creation.<ref name="nenno-11">Nenno, ''Ending the Stalemate'', p. 11.</ref>  His November 1969 plan brought programs with similar functions together under unified, policy-based administration at the Washington level, and created two new assistant secretary positions.<ref name="nenno-11"/>  At the same time, he increased the number of regional and area offices and decentralized program operations and locality-based decisions to them.<ref name="nenno-11"/>

The [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] mandated a federal commitment towards housing desegregation, and required HUD to orient its programs in this direction.<ref name="mason">Mason, ''Richard Nixon and the Quest for a New Majority'', pp. 149<U+2013>150.</ref>  Romney, filled with moral passion, wanted to address the widening economic and geographic gulf between whites and blacks by moving blacks out of inner-city ghettos into suburbs.<ref name="kotlowski-45">Kotlowski, ''Nixon's Civil Rights'', p. 45.</ref>  Romney proposed an [[open housing]] scheme to facilitate desegregation, dubbed "Open Communities"; HUD planned it for many months without keeping Nixon informed.<ref name="lamb-69">Lamb, ''Housing Segregation in Suburban America Since 1960'', pp. 69<U+2013>72.</ref><ref name="kotlowski-55">Kotlowski, ''Nixon's Civil Rights'', pp. 55<U+2013>57.</ref>

When the open housing proposal became public, local reaction was often hostile.<ref name="mason"/>  This included [[Warren, Michigan]], a blue-collar suburb of Detroit where many blacks worked but could not live due to the zoning practices, refusals, and intimidatory actions of white property owners, many of whom had come there from the city as part of [[white flight]].<ref name="lamb-93">Lamb, ''Housing Segregation in Suburban America Since 1960'', pp. 85<U+2013>93.</ref><ref name="nyt072970">{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20813F63A5A157493CBAB178CD85F448785F9 | title=Michiganites Jeer Romney Over Suburbs' Integration | last=Flint |first=Jerry M. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 29, 1970 | page=27 | format=fee required}}</ref>  HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration.<ref name="lamb-93"/>  Romney rejected this response, partly because when he was  governor, Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town.<ref name="nyt072970"/>  Now the secretary said, "The youth of this nation, the minorities of this nation, the discriminated of this nation are not going to wait for 'nature to take its course.' What is really at issue here is responsibility&nbsp;<U+2013> moral responsibility."<ref name="lamb-93"/>

Romney visited Warren in July 1970, and emphasized that [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] rather than forced integration was all that HUD was demanding, but the local populace was not satisfied and Romney was jeered as a police escort took him away from the meeting place.<ref name="nyt072970"/>   Nixon saw what happened in Warren<ref name="lamb-93"/> and had no interest in the Open Communities policy in general, remarking to domestic adviser [[John Ehrlichman]] that, "This country is not ready at this time for either forcibly integrated housing or forcibly integrated education."<ref name="mason"/>  Open Communities also conflicted with Nixon's use of the [[Southern strategy]] and his own views on race.<ref>Lamb, ''Housing Segregation in Suburban America Since 1960'', pp. 112, 119.</ref>  Romney was forced to back down on Warren and release federal monies to them unconditionally.<ref name="lamb-93"/>

When [[Black Jack, Missouri]], subsequently resisted a HUD-sponsored plan for desegregated lower- and middle-income housing, Romney appealed to U.S. Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] for [[U.S. Justice Department|Justice Department]] intervention.<ref name="mason"/>  In September 1970, Mitchell refused and Romney's plan collapsed.<ref name="mason"/>  Under Romney, HUD did put into place stricter racial guidelines in relation to new public housing projects, but overall administration implementation of the Fair Housing Act was lacking.<ref name="mason"/>  Some of the responsibility lay with Romney's inattentiveness to gaining political backing for the policy, including the failure to rally natural allies such as the [[NAACP]].<ref name="kotlowski-55"/>  [[Salisbury State University]] historian Dean J. Kotlowski writes that, "No civil rights initiative developed on Nixon's watch was as sincerely devised or poorly executed as open communities."<ref name="kotlowski-55"/>

Another of Romney's initiatives was "Operation Breakthrough", which was intended to increase the amount of housing available to the poor and which did have Nixon's initial support.<ref name="kotlowski-52"/>  Based on his automotive industry experience, Romney thought that the cost of housing could be significantly reduced if in-factory [[modular building|modular construction]] techniques were used.<ref name="huduser"/>  However, HUD officials saw it too as a means to spearhead desegregation; Romney said, "We've got to put an end to the idea of moving to suburban areas and living only among people of the same economic and social class".<ref>Lamb, ''Housing Segregation in Suburban America Since 1960'', p. 63.</ref>  This aspect of the program brought about strong opposition at the local suburban level and lost support in the White House as well.<ref>Lamb, ''Housing Segregation in Suburban America Since 1960'', pp. 64<U+2013>66.</ref>  Over half of HUD's research funds during this time were spent on Operation Breakthrough, and it was modestly successful in its building goals.<ref name="nyt-obit"/><ref name="nenno-13">Nenno, ''Ending the Stalemate'', p. 13.</ref>  It did not revolutionize home construction, and was phased out once Romney left HUD,<ref name="nenno-13"/> but side effects of the program did lead to more modern and consistent [[building codes]] and to introduction of technological advances such as the [[smoke alarm]].<ref name="huduser"/>
In any case, using conventional methods, HUD set records for the amount of construction of assisted housing for low- and moderate-income families.<ref name="nenno-13"/>  Toward the end of his term, Romney oversaw demolition of the infamous [[Pruitt<U+2013>Igoe]] housing project in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].<ref name="huduser">{{cite journal | url=http://www.huduser.org/Periodicals/CITYSCPE/VOL1NUM3/foote.pdf | title=As They Saw It: HUD's Secretaries Reminisce About Carrying Out the Mission | last=Foote | first=Joseph | journal=Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development and Research | volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=71<U+2013>92 |year=1995 |month=September}}</ref>

''[[The Boston Globe]]'' later termed Romney's conflicts with Nixon a matter that "played out with Shakespearean drama".<ref name="bg-series-4-side"/>  Despite all the setbacks and frustrations, [[University at Buffalo]] political scientist Charles M.

==Public service and volunteerism==
Romney was known as an advocate of public service, and volunteerism was a passion of his.<ref name="nyt-course"/> At the first meeting of the National Center for Voluntary Action, on February 20, 1970, he said:

<blockquote>
Americans have four basic ways of solving problems that are too big for individuals to handle by themselves. One is through the federal government. A second is through state governments and the local governments that the states create. The third is through the private sector&nbsp;<U+2013> the economic sector that includes business, agriculture, and labor. The fourth method is the independent sector&nbsp;<U+2013> the voluntary, cooperative action of free individuals and independent association.  Voluntary action is the most powerful of these, because it is uniquely capable of stirring the people themselves and involving their enthusiastic energies, because it is their own&nbsp;<U+2013> voluntary action is the people's action. ... As Woodrow Wilson said, "The most powerful force on earth is the spontaneous cooperation of a free people." Individualism makes cooperation worthwhile&nbsp;<U+2013> but cooperation makes freedom possible.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=591 | title=In the Line of Service | last=Colton | first=Kent W. | publisher=[[Brigham Young University]] | date=April 9, 2002}}</ref>
</blockquote>

In 1974, Romney became founding chair of the [[National Volunteer Center]], which promoted volunteerism; it would later merge with President [[George H. W. Bush]]'s [[Points of Light Foundation]].<ref name="wapo-obit"/>  That is part of the greater [[Corporation for National and Community Service]], which gives out a George W.
