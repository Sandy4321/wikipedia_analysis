'''Daniel Manning''' (May 16, 1831 &ndash; December 24, 1887) was an [[United States|American]] businessman, journalist, and politician.

Born in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] [[New York]], he was educated in the public schools and then entered the world of commerce. At the age of 11, Manning went to work for the Albany ''Atlas'' which later consolidated with the ''Argus'' in 1856 where he became the editor in 1865 and owner in 1873.[http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/people/A0831578.html]

Manning's political career was very successful as well. He served as the chairman of the New York Democratic committee from 1881<U+2013>1884, and later was appointed [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Grover Cleveland]] in March 1885. Manning resigned from this post in April 1887 due to ill health.

He died later that year in Albany. An engraved portrait of Manning appears on U.S. paper money, on the series 1886 20.00 silver certificates. Some of these notes are referred to as "diamondbacks" due to their unusual reverse design and they are scarce.
