'''''Pok<U+00E9>mon Chronicles''''' is a spin-off series of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|Pok<U+00E9>mon anime]], revolving around characters other than [[Ash Ketchum|Ash]]. It is an English dub of a number of special episodes that had previously aired only in Japan.

It first aired in Britain on [[Toonami (UK)|Toonami]], where the initial run has now finished. The only places where episodes are currently airing for the first time are the Caribbean and Latin America on [[Cartoon Network]] Monday to Friday at 9:00pm EST/ 10:00 MXT. However, in Latin America, it seems the show has been cancelled because [[Mew Mew Power]] was put when Pok<U+00E9>mon Chronicles usually is. The series made its [[U.S.]] premiere on [[Cartoon Network]] on [[June 3]], [[2006]] at 7 PM US ET/PT after it ended in most other countries.<ref name="usairing">{{cite web|last=|first=Cartoon Network Press Release|authorlink=Cartoon Network |coauthors= | date=[[2006-05-16]] |url=http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=10553 |title=Cartoon Network Acquires Pok<U+00E9>mon Series for June 3 Premiere |format= |work= |pages= |publisher=Toon Zone | language= |accessdate=2006-05-16 |accessyear= }}</ref>

Four DVDs have been released in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], with a [[United States|U.S.]] release. The first two volumes are available in [[Australia]] as a bonus extra on the Season 1 [[boxset]].

==History==
A number of special episodes of Pok<U+00E9>mon were made alongside the regular anime series. This began during the 5th season with a special feature length episode called "Raikou: Legend of Thunder!" Though popular, these special episodes were never dubbed into English and the regular series continued to progress forward in the series' continuity. 

A new program got a regular slot on [[TV Tokyo]] called ''Shuukan Pok<U+00E9>mon Housoukyoku'', known as the Housou or Hoso episodes by fans. This was an informational magazine show hosted by the characters of Brock and Misty. Occasionally, a 'special' episode would air instead. These episodes explored what other characters were doing while Ash was travelling in [[Hoenn]].

Despite many hopes for a dubbed version, 4Kids disregarded these episodes and continued to only dub the main series. But at a press conference some time later, it was announced that they would be creating a new program entitled ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Chronicles''. There was some speculation at first as to the content, and it was eventually revealed to be a dubbing of the Housou episodes.

The episode order is altered slightly from the episode order for the Housou episodes, such as those starring the Pichu Brothers, which were moved back. The series also included previously unseen "Pikachu's Winter Vacation" episodes.

Pok<U+00E9>mon Chronicles aired first in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and began on [[May 11]], [[2005]]. It then aired in Canada, starting on [[September 9]] of the same year. Then it began airing in Latin America on [[December 1]], [[2005]]. It began in the [[United States|US]] on [[June 3]] , [[2006]]. There is currently no information on when it will air anywhere else. Starting [[October 9]], [[2006]], Pok<U+00E9>mon Chronicles has since been airing on Cartoon Network's online broadband service, [[Toonami Jetstream]].

''Shuukan Pok<U+00E9>mon Housoukyoku'' has now been replaced by ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Sunday'', a similar show that airs on Sunday evenings.

==Characters==
{{main|List of Pok<U+00E9>mon characters}}

As ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Chronicles'' focuses on recurring minor or departed major characters from the main [[Pok<U+00E9>mon anime]], its cast shifts from episode to episode, and many different characters have played starring roles. These are listed here in order of appearance: 

===Main characters===
* '''[[Ash Ketchum|Ash]]'s Pok<U+00E9>mon''' / '''Satoshi's Pok<U+00E9>mon''': Ash's Pok<U+00E9>mon get into mischief even when [[Ash Ketchum|Ash]] isn't around. In the Winter Vacation episodes they are joined by [[Pikachu]] and some of [[Brock (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Brock]] and [[Misty (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Misty]]'s Pok<U+00E9>mon and meet a group of "Snow [[Snorlax]]."

* '''[[Brock (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Brock]]''' / '''Takeshi''': Brock travelled around Hoenn with Ash but between "Gotta Catch Ya Later" and "You Can Never Taillow", he visited his [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Gym]] in [[Pewter City]]. There he found that his mother had taken over the gym, turning it into a Water gym.

* '''Casey''' / '''Nanako''': Casey was introduced in [[Johto]], where she met Ash. They met a few times after that, although Casey only got 4 badges in the time it took Ash to get 8. When she isn't training Pok<U+00E9>mon, she is a big fan of the fictional [[Electabuzz]] [[baseball]] team. Her Pok<U+00E9>mon are [[Meganium]] (her starter), [[Pidgey]], [[Rattata]], [[Beedrill]] (given by Ash), [[Elekid]], and the dub says she has a [[Magmar]] and [[Rapidash]].

* '''[[Gary Oak]]''' / '''Shigeru Okido''': Gary Oak is Professor Oak's grandson. He was very stuck-up and travelled with his cheergirls around [[Kanto (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Kanto]]. He eventually matured after losing in the Indigo Plateau a round before Ash. He re-appeared in Johto, and after losing to Ash in the Silver Conference, decided to become a Pok<U+00E9>mon Professor.

* '''Jimmy''' / '''Kenta''': Jimmy is on his way to become a great Pok<U+00E9>mon Master with his [[Typhlosion]], so that he can help the kids in [[New Bark Town]]. He is based on [[Gold (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Gold]], the male protagonist from [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold and Silver|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold, Silver'']] and/or [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Crystal|''Crystal'']].

* '''Marina''': Marina is an old friend of Jimmy's, and she battles to entertain, always making sure she puts on a good show. She also performs in dance routines with her Pok<U+00E9>mon. Marina is based on the female character from ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Crystal]]''. Her favorite Pok<U+00E9>mon are her [[Misdreavus]] and [[Croconaw]].

* '''Vincent''' / '''Jun'ichi''': Vincent battled Ash in the Silver Conference, although he was known there as ''Jackson''. This new name was most likely another attempt to impress Marina, as he is trying to get her to become his girlfriend. Vincent's favorite Pok<U+00E9>mon is his [[Meganium]].

* '''[[Meowth]]''' / '''Nyarth''': Meowth is a unique Pok<U+00E9>mon in that he can talk. He normally hangs around with his best friends [[Team Rocket#The Trio|Jessie and James]], attempting to capture [[Pikachu]]. But he somehow occasionally finds time to visit Millennium City, and be the good guy with the Pichu Brothers.

* '''[[Misty (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Misty]]''' / '''Kasumi''': Misty has travelled everywhere with Brock and Ash since Ash broke her bike. But at the end of Johto saga of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon anime]], her sisters went on a World Tour, and she had to become the official [[Gym Leader]] of [[Cerulean City]].

* '''[[Professor Oak|Professor Samuel Oak]]''' / '''Professor Yukinari Okido''': Professor Samuel Oak is the world's foremost authority on Pok<U+00E9>mon. When Trainers such as [[Ash Ketchum]] and [[Gary Oak]] begin their Pok<U+00E9>mon Journey, Professor Oak gives them their starting Pok<U+00E9>mon - [[Bulbasaur]], [[Charmander]], or [[Squirtle]], (or [[Pikachu]] in Ash's case) When he isn't looking after all the Pok<U+00E9>mon that Trainers don't have with them at the time - (you can only carry six) - he is studying them and upgrading the [[Pok<U+00E9>dex]].

* '''The [[Pichu]] Brothers''', ''(individually known as Pichu Little and Pichu Big)'': The Pichu Brothers live in Millennium City. Their days are all about having fun with the Pichu Poss<U+00E9> in the clubhouse. They met [[Pikachu]] in "Pikachu and Pichu" - the mini-movie before the 3rd movie, but get into other mischief later, on their own or with Meowth.

* '''[[Richie (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Richie]]''' / '''Hiroshi''': Richie and his trusty Pikachu, Sparky, battled Ash at the Indigo Plateau, and they have been best friends ever since, even though they only met once again (in the Whirl Islands.) Richie does decide to go and meet Ash in Hoenn, but he apparently decides against it, because he is later seen in the [[Sevii Islands]].

* '''[[Tracey Sketchit]]''' / '''Kenji''': Tracey Sketchit travelled with Ash in the [[Orange Islands]], and is now a lab assistant for Professor Oak. He loves drawing, and has produced many accurate sketches of Pok<U+00E9>mon. He is also good friends with Misty and Brock.

* '''[[Team Rocket (anime)#The Trio|Jessie & James]]''' / '''Musashi & Kojiro''': Jessie & James are starting up the Hoenn branch of Team Rocket. ([[Giovanni (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Giovanni]] sent them to do so to get them out of the way.) When they aren't trying to capture Pikachu, they are spreading the name of Team Rocket for their boss. They had two important episodes, one of them had them remembering how they joined Team Rocket and another episode had them  saving a village from [[Taillow]].

===Minor characters===
* '''Delia Ketchum''' / '''Hanako''': Delia is Ash's mother. She really misses him while he is away, but she is happy at home with her [[Mr. Mime]] for company. She is also good friends with [[Professor Oak]] and [[Tracey Sketchit]].

* '''Gilbert''': Gilbert is a new Pok<U+00E9>mon trainer and the mayor's son. He prefers the Hoenn starters to the ones that [[Professor Oak]] has to offer.

* '''Sakura''': Sakura is one of the Kimono Sisters from Ecruteak City. She originally intended to join Ash, Misty, and Brock on their Pok<U+00E9>mon Journey, but decided to stay at home and learn more first. But now she is collecting [[badges]] in Kanto with her trusty [[Espeon]], and her new [[Beautifly]].

===Team Rocket Villains===
* '''[[Team Rocket (anime)#Other members and operations|Atilla & Hun]]''' / '''Buson & Basho''': Atilla & Hun are also members of Team Rocket, and are out to capture [[Raikou (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Raikou]].

* '''[[Team Rocket (anime)#Rivals|Cassidy & Butch]]''' / '''Yamato & Kosaburo''': Cassidy & Butch do not follow one Trainer around like Jessie & James do. They pick random worthwhile things and Pok<U+00E9>mon to steal. Unfortunately for them, they usually choose people linked to Ash in some way. They are the main villains in ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Chronicles''.

* '''[[Team Rocket (anime)#The Trio|Jessie & James]]''' / '''Musashi & Kojiro''': Jessie & James are starting up the Hoenn branch of Team Rocket. ([[Giovanni (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Giovanni]] sent them to do so to get them out of the way.) When they aren't trying to capture Pikachu, they are spreading the name of Team Rocket for their boss.

==Opening and Ending==
The original Housou episodes did not have a musical opening. Instead, they open with Brock and Misty talking (except for the Team Rocket Housous, where said characters would talk instead). Normally, it would result in Misty hitting Brock with a mallet, fan or water gun for being Brock. The endings would normally deal with that episode's character.

The Japanese Housous were seen as ''special'' episodes, hence the unconventional opening. However, it was dubbed as a completely new series, so a musical opening was required. While the openings from the main series interlink scenes from the related Japanese opening with scenes from the episodes, there was no Japanese opening for Pok<U+00E9>mon Chronicles. Because of this, all the scenes in the opening, (besides the Pok<U+00E9>mon logo at the end) are taken from episodes. There are 42 scenes in 36 seconds. 

The ending is a repeat of the opening on the left of the screen, with the credits rolling past on the right. There are a few variations, however. The DVD version and first two parts of ''The Legend of Thunder'' shows footage from the battle at the start of Part Two. The ending for ''Pikachu's Winter Vacation'' on the DVD rolls over a full screen picture taken from the episode.

The original theme tune is a modified version of the "G/S Pokerap". However, there is an instrumental in the middle, where the narrator basically says what Chronicles is about:
:
:Old Friends! 
:New Adventures! 
:Never before seen stories from the world of Pok<U+00E9>mon!

Starting on June 10, 2006, the intro sequence was changed to a newer version, consisting of a montage of various scenes from "The Legend of Thunder" with more intense music.

===A note on the DVDs===
The episodes have been released in a series of DVDs.  It should be noted that, if bought as standalone Volumes, Volume Three is packaged in with Volume Two as a "bonus Volume".  This is likely because the covers of Volumes One, Two and Four depict the evolutions of [[Charmander]], [[Squirtle]] and [[Bulbasaur]], respectively.  A box set is also available with Volumes One, Two and Three, though Volume Four is only available as a single disk Volume.  Unusually, the box set packages Volume Three in its own case with the Bulbasaur cover, leading to two near-identical Volume covers.  Also unusually, an image on [http://www.play.com Play.com] depicts a completely different cover for Volume Four, though this cover is used on the outer case of the box set.

The DVDs do not contain any special features besides episode and scene selection. They do not have subtitles.

The covers promise ''never before seen footage'' but this is minimal. There are some differences between the DVD and TV versions. Most notably, ''The Legend of Thunder'' is all together, and so the title card says "the movie", rather than "Part X". The end credits of ''Pikachu's Winter Vacation'' roll over a picture from the episode, rather than the normal credits.

Volume One was released in the UK on Monday 13th June 2005, while Volumes Two and Three were released on Monday 22nd August 2005. Volume Four was released in early 2006.  A US release is expected in the future, though any dates are yet to be confirmed.

==English Dub Controversy==
{{originalresearch}}
There is often [[4Kids Entertainment#Criticism and controversy|criticism and controversy]] for anime dubbed by 4Kids. One of the biggest outcries was of the initial reaction to Pok<U+00E9>mon Chronicles, due to the high amount of criticism for the earlier episodes.

The main source of this controversy was over the three-part special, "The Legend of Thunder". Due to high expectations in the Pok<U+00E9>mon fan community built up by [[fansub|fan translations]], fan reception to 4Kids' localization, as to be expected of the company given its previous fan relations (or lack thereof), was quite poor.

===Name changes===
Some names were changed without reason: In the regular series episode, "Tie One On", Vincent was known as Jackson. He was an important character that Ash had to beat in order to progress to the finals of the Johto League, so why this happened is unclear, especially since, in the Japanese versions of both "Tie One On" and "The Legend of Thunder", he was known by the same name of "Jun'ichi". In that same episode, 'Jackson' says hello to two characters called Dani and Yoshi in a television camera. As 'Junichi' called Kenta (Jimmy) and Marina at the same point in the Japanese version, it was assumed that those were their dub names. While this was never canon, the fact that Jackson's name changed does not make explanations easy.

In addition, Eusine, from the regular-series episode "For Ho-oh the Bells Toll" and the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Crystal'' video game appeared in part two of "Legend of Thunder" with the name Eugene. 4Kids has made no public statement on why these characters' names were changed; it is generally assumed that it was an oversight. When characters recognized each other later in the series, this was certainly not a problem.

===Gender changes===
Another controversy was the character of Hun. Though a man in the Japanese version, Hun is a woman in the dub. The reason for this is unknown, though it is suspected to be to prevent the implication of homosexuality. (This change seems peculiar considering Harley's [a character from the main series] mannerisms, [i.e.,wiggling his hips when he walks, crossdressing as May, etc.] and he's still a man in the dub.)

===Around the world===
In Latin America, [[Cartoon Network]] is/was airing the episodes since December 1st in a different order.

===Deleted scenes===
The ending of "Legend of Thunder," which provides a resolution after the main action, was removed. These removals were initially believed to be on the part of Toonami due to time constraints, but they were not restored on the DVD.

===Continuity errors===
Major continuity errors in "A Family That Battles Together Stays Together" were another source of controversy. In the regular-series episode "Showdown in Pewter City", Flint tells Ash that Brock's mother died of grief. (In the Japanese version, she just abandoned her family.) But when Brock arrives in Pewter City in "A Family That Battles Together Stays Together," she is alive and well; no explanation is offered for the break in continuity. Flint also can't remember how Pikachu defeated Onix, even though he was a key part of making it happen. (This, however, may be explained by the fact that, if Brock is unaware of how Flint helped Ash, Flint may be trying to cover it up so his son doesn't think he's a cheater. It could have also been put there for [[Comic relief]], by purposely making him an [[idiot]].) Lastly "A Family That Battles Together Stays Together" was to show how Brock left [[Onix]], [[Geodude]], and [[Crobat]] with his brother, Forrest. However, the dub only shows Brock giving Onix to Forrest, and so Crobat and Geodude just mysteriously disappear.
