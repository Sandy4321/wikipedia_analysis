'''Fran<U+00E7>ois d'Orbay''' (1634 <U+2013> 1697) was a French [[draughtsman]] and [[architect]] who worked closely with [[Louis Le Vau]] and [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]].<ref>"Orbay, Fran<U+00E7>ois d'", pp. 539<U+2013>540, in Curl 2006; "Orbay, Fran<U+00E7>ois d'", p. 411, in Fleming et al. 1998; Berger 1982 and 1998. Hautecoeur 1948, p. 123, gives d'Orbay's date of death as 4 September 1697, however Berger 1998 does not repeat it.</ref>

==Early training and career==
D'Orbay was born in Paris and likely received his early training as an architect from his father, who was a master mason and entrepreneur. In the late 1650s he became an assistant to the architect Louis Le Vau, when the latter was working on the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Vincennes]].<ref name=Berger>Berger 1998.</ref>

In 1660 Le Vau sent d'Orbay to Rome for further study. While in Rome, d'Orbay created an ambitious but unexecuted design for a stair in front of the [[Trinit<U+00E0> dei Monti]], as well as three buildings adjacent to the church. He probably returned to Paris before the end of 1660.<ref name=Berger/>

[[File:Eglise Premontres Saint-Germain.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|<U+00C9>glise des R<U+00E9>ligieux de Pr<U+00E9>montr<U+00E9> (1662; demolished 1719)]]

Commissioned by [[Anne of Austria]], d'Orbay designed and built the entrance to the church of the convent of the Pr<U+00E9>montr<U+00E9>s de la Croix-Rouge in 1662. A friend, the sculptor [[<U+00C9>tienne Le Hongre]], executed the patron's [[coat of arms]] and the bas-relief of the attic (''The Eucharist Carried by Angels''). The church was located between the rue de S<U+00E8>vres and the rue du Cherche-Midi in the [[Faubourg Saint-Germain]], but was demolished in 1719.<ref> Hautecoeur 1948, p. 121.</ref>

In 1663 d'Orbay received an official post with the [[B<U+00E2>timents du Roi]], working mainly as a draughtsman under Le Vau, the [[Premier Architecte du Roi]]. D'Orbay produced numerous drawings for the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]], [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], and the [[Coll<U+00E8>ge des Quatre-Nations]]. After Le Vau's death in 1670, d'Orbay was left in charge of completing much of the ongoing work, sometimes introducing significant changes to Le Vau's original designs.<ref name=Berger/>

At Versailles he is thought to have been primarily responsible for the design of the {{Link-interwiki|lang=fr|en=Escalier des Ambassadeurs}} (decorated by [[Charles Le Brun]]), although d'Orbay apparently relied very heavily on an earlier design by [[Claude Perrault]] for a stairway at the Louvre.<ref name=Berger/>

In 1671 d'Orbay became one of the founding members of the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie d'Architecture]] and that same year designed the portal of the H<U+00F4>pital de la Trinit<U+00E9> (destroyed), [[Rue Saint-Denis (Paris)|rue Saint-Denis]], Paris.<ref> Hautecoeur 1948, p. 121; Berger 1998.</ref>

In 1960 the French architect Albert Laprade brought d'Orbay from relative obscurity into the limelight by publishing a monograph in which he proposed that d'Orbay was the actual designer of most of the important French architecture projects carried out from 1660 to 1697, including the [[Louvre Colonnade]] and the Envelope of Versailles.<ref>Laprade 1960; for a discussion of the ''enveloppe'' of Versailles, see [[History of the Palace of Versailles#Second building campaign]].</ref> However, several [[architectural historian]]s have subsequently disputed most of Laprade's arguments. For instance, many of the drawings used as evidence are by other hands.<ref>Blunt & Beresford 1999, p. 294 note 38; Berger 1982 and 1998.</ref> It should also be noted that after Le Vau's death, d'Orbay was passed over and not promoted into Le Vau's post, which remained vacant. [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] was made principal architect of Versailles in 1678, after which d'Orbay resumed his former job as draughtsman (now under Mansart).<ref name=Berger/> Mansart was promoted to Premier Architecte du Roi in 1681.<ref>Jestaz 1998, p. 296.</ref>

==Late career==
D'Orbay did however execute some independent work in the latter part of his career:<ref name=Berger/>
* Carmelite Church in [[Lyon]] (1680<U+2013>1682; destroyed)
* Theatre of the [[Com<U+00E9>die-Fran<U+00E7>aise]] on the rue des Foss<U+00E9>s-Saint-Germain-des-Pr<U+00E9>s (now the rue de l'Ancienne Com<U+00E9>die) in Paris (1688<U+2013>1689; destroyed)
* [[Porte du Peyrou|Arc de Triomphe du Peyrou]] in Montpellier (designed in 1690; built by {{Link-interwiki|lang=fr|en=Augustin-Charles d'Aviler}})
* [[Montauban Cathedral]] (designed 1692; built 1692<U+2013>1739, after 1697 by Hardouin-Mansart and [[Robert de Cotte]], with modifications) 

D'Orbay died in Paris.
