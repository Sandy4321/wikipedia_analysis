==History==
West Milford started out as New Milford in what was then western [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]] in the 18th century, having been settled by disenchanted [[Dutch people|Dutch]] from Milford, New Jersey (later renamed by the British as Newark).  These same Dutch also built a town of [[New Milford, New Jersey|New Milford in eastern Bergen County]]. When both New Milfords applied for post offices in 1828, a clerk in [[Washington, D.C.]] is said to have approved the other application first and assigned the name "West Milford" to the New Milford in western Bergen County in order to distinguish between the two locations.<ref>Stewart, Holly. [http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=NewsBank&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=1401FE2F76ACDF38&p_docnum=1&p_queryname=6 "Where we<U+2019>re at"], ''Suburban Trends'', July 19, 2012. Accessed January 15, 2013. "In the 18th century, West Milford was part of Bergen County; it was {{sic|hide=y|comprised| of}} the westernmost areas of Franklin and Saddle River townships. It was settled by Dutch who moved north from the place we now call Newark; as they had called their former home 'Milford,' they wished to call the new place 'New Milford,' but another faction of the same migrants had already done the same in a community near the Hudson River. When both locales petitioned for a post office in 1828, a federal clerk is said to have applied the adjective 'west' to one in order to distinguish them."</ref>

West Milford became a municipality by an Act of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] on March 10, 1834, when it was formed from the westernmost portions of both [[Franklin Township, Bergen County, New Jersey|Franklin Township]] and [[Saddle River Township, New Jersey|Saddle River Township]], while the area was still part of [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]]. On February 7, 1837, Passaic County was created from portions of both Bergen County and [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]], with West Milford as the western end of the newly formed county.<ref name=Story>Snyder, John P.

There are old name places in the township including Postville, Utterville, Corterville, Browns, Awosting, Echo Lake, [[Macopin, New Jersey|Macopin]], Charlotteburg (named after [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]'s wife, [[Queen Charlotte]] and the town is now under the Charlotteburg Reservoir), Clinton (or sometimes called Clinton Furnace, now under the Clinton Reservoir, and the furnace still stands), Moe Mountain, Oak Ridge (a nameplace, but town is under the Oak Ridge Reservoir), Newfoundland, Apshawa, New City, and Smith Mills.  [[Newfoundland, New Jersey|Newfoundland]] is divided by the [[Pequannock River]], which divides Passaic and [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris]] Counties; a small part of Newfoundland lies within Jefferson Township.  A large part of the township, including the  [[New City Village]] area, is reservoir property owned by the City of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] in [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] for their water supply.  Prior to the [[World War II|Second World War]], the township was a resort area with trains coming from New York City to stations at Charlotteburg, Newfoundland, Oak Ridge in the south and Hewitt (also known as Sterling Forest station) and Awosting in the north.  Railroad service in the south was from the New Jersey Midland starting around the 1850s and in the north around the 1870s from the Montclair Railroad, out of [[Montclair, New Jersey]] and later the [[Erie Railroad]] (before their merger with the Lackawanna Railroad).

[[Greenwood Lake]] is an interstate lake approximately {{convert|9|mi|km}} long lying in both New Jersey and [[New York State]].  It was originally called Long Pond.  It was dammed up to increase the size of the lake for water power down stream.  During the resort era, several steamboats operated on the lake, the most famous and grand was the two deck steamer, ''Montclair''.  These steamboats met the trains and took passengers to the various resorts around the lake in both states.

There is a seaplane area on Greenwood Lake, a few large marinas and lakeside restaurants with docks.  There is a public airport called [[Greenwood Lake Airport]] just south of the lake on top of a mountain ridge and has two landing strips; one is long enough to handle small jets.<ref>[http://www.greenwoodlakeairport.com/id59.html Airport Information], [[Greenwood Lake Airport]]. Accessed January 15, 2013.</ref> There is one private airport in the township on a private estate.

After [[World War II]] and for the next 20 years the area underwent a major change from a resort area to year round residences. Before there were year-round houses, the summer residence of [[Cecil B. Demille]] was West Milford.  Road maps of the 1950s showing the population on the backside said 2,000 winter and 10,000 summer.<ref>Hagstrom Maps</ref>

===A&P Supermarket===
For decades, West Milford was rural with only a couple service stations, a couple small eating establishments, and a bank or two. The community was mostly residential. In the mid-1960s a then-average-sized {{convert|20000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company|A&P]] Supermarket was built. During the late 1990s, A&P closed this original store and built a {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} supermarket a few miles away from the town center, next door to their former store. 

===Jungle Habitat===
In 1972, [[Warner Brothers]] opened up a wildlife theme park called [[Jungle Habitat]]. This park consisted of a drive through safari and a small park with various shows. Initially, this brought huge tourist revenue to the township. Shortly after the park opened, a tourist being driven through the safari in a taxi was attacked by a lion on October 19, 1972, bringing negative publicity to the park.<ref>Laplaca, Bryan.

He was bitten by a lion while visiting Jungle Habitat in West Milford.... Two eyewitnesses to the mauling of Levy on Oct. 9, 1972 blasted the Habitat management for allowing what they called dangerous conditions to exist."</ref> The park was plagued by problems, including reports of dangerous animals escaping into West Milford.<ref>Hudson, Edward.

Accessed September 22, 2014.</ref>

Jungle Habitat was a mixed blessing due to the amount of summer and weekend traffic into this rural area made up of small two lane roads. Jungle Habitat wanted to expand and become a huge amusement park, but residents concerned with excessive traffic voted this proposal down in 1976, which resulted in an abrupt closing and exit.  Some of the animals in the wildlife park were subsequently moved to the then-recently established drive through safari at [[Six Flags Great Adventure|Great Adventure]] in [[Jackson Township, New Jersey|Jackson Township]].  The former site of Jungle Habitat, in recent years has become a location for various Township activities such as the annual Fourth of July Fireworks display.

===West Milford Shopping Center===
With the loss of tax revenue and the needs of the residents in mind, the township approved the addition of more businesses. In the 1970s,{{fact|date=October 2013}} a {{convert|45000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[ShopRite (United States)|ShopRite]] supermarket was built, and was expanded in the mid-1980s. Shortly thereafter, other businesses opened in the West Milford Shopping Center. 

Near the ShopRite, several restaurants and fast food establishments were built, including a [[McDonald's]] restaurant as well as the Abby Theater, the first four-screen multiplex cinema in northern New Jersey. The Abby Theater was opened in 1976 and designed by Milton Herson for Music Makers Theaters, with a seating capacity of 1,400. The theater was named for Abby Leigh, wife of Mitch Leigh, then board chairman of Music Makers.<ref name=boxoffice>Impressive Score.
