'''Charles Saatchi ''' (born 9 June 1943) ({{lang-ar|<U+062A><U+0634><U+0627><U+0631><U+0644><U+0632> <U+0633><U+0627><U+0639><U+0627><U+062A><U+062C><U+064A>}}) was the co-founder with his brother [[Maurice Saatchi, Baron Saatchi|Maurice]] of the global [[advertising]] agency [[Saatchi & Saatchi]], leading the world's largest advertising agency until they were forced out in 1995. In the same year the Saatchi brothers formed a new agency called [[M&C Saatchi]]. 

Many large clients followed, and their new agency quickly overtook their former agency in Britain's top ten. Charles is also known worldwide as an art collector and owner of the [[Saatchi Gallery]], and in particular for his sponsorship of the [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs), including [[Damien Hirst]] and [[Tracey Emin]]. 

==Life==
Charles Saatchi was born into a wealthy [[Iraqi Jewish]] family in Baghdad, Iraq. In 1947, the family fled persecution and moved to [[Finchley]],<ref name="times2009"/> London.<ref name="bbc2002">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/2124645.stm|title=Charles Saatchi: Artful adman|last=Jones|first=Chris |date=2002-07-12|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> There Saatchi attended [[Christ's College (Finchley)|Christ's College]], a secondary school in North London.<ref name="times2009"/> During this time he developed an obsession with U.S. pop culture, including the music of [[Elvis Presley]], [[Little Richard]] and [[Chuck Berry]]. He also manifested an enthusiasm for collections, from cigarette cards and jukeboxes to Superman comics and nudist magazines.<ref name="times2009"/> He has described as "life changing" the experience of viewing a [[Jackson Pollock]] painting at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. He then progressed to study at the [[London College of Communication]].<ref name="telegraph2001">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4730049/Adventures-in-Saatchiland.html|title=Adventures in Saatchiland|last=Gleadell |first=Colin |date=2001-12-31|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=25 November 2009}}</ref>

In 1970 he started the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi with his brother Maurice; which by 1986 had grown to be the largest agency in the world, with over 600 offices. Successful campaigns in the UK included [[Silk Cut]] cigarettes and the promotion of the Conservative Party led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] through the slogan "Labour Isn't Working". Eventually, he and his brother Maurice departed the agency and together founded the rival M&C Saatchi agency, taking many of their clients with them, including the huge [[British Airways]] advertising account.<ref name="bbc2002"/>

In the ''[[Sunday Times Rich List 2009]]'' ranking of the wealthiest people in the UK he was grouped with his brother Maurice and placed 438th with an estimated joint fortune of <U+00A3>120million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/richlist-app/index.php?pageID=19|title=Rich List 2009|date=2009|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=26 November 2009}}</ref>

He is a notorious recluse, even hiding from clients when they visited his agency's offices,<ref name="times2009">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article5817312.ece|title=The Saturday interview: Charles Saatchi|last=Thomson|first=Alice |coauthors=Rachel Sylvester |date=2009-02-28|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> and, as of February 2009, has only ever granted two newspaper interviews.<ref name="times2009"/><ref name="telegraph2002">{{cite news|url=http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/charlesqa/qa.htm|title=Readers' questions|publisher=The Sunday Telegraph|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> He does not attend to his own openings either. When asked why by the ''Sunday Telegraph'', he replied: "I don't go to other people's openings, so I extend the same courtesy to my own."<ref name="telegraph2002"/>

A fervent collector of modern art, Saatchi opened the [[Saatchi Gallery]] in London in 1985, where he exhibits the art he has collected over the years.<ref name="britannica"/><ref name="bbc2002"/>

His first wife, Doris Lockhart (1973-1990)<ref name='pieces-from-a-confessional' />, became known during their marriage as an art and design journalist, with particular knowledge of [[minimalism]];<ref name='pieces-from-a-confessional'>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/pieces-from-a-confessional-1179187.html|title=Pieces from a confessional|last=Darwent |first=Charles |date=1998-10-18|publisher=The Independant|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> his second, Kay Hartenstein (1990<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/13/style/chronicle-778490.html?pagewanted=1|title=Chronicle|date=1990-08-13|work=The New York Times|edition=New York|page=B6|publisher=The New York Times|last=Heller Anderson|first=Susan|accessdate=26 February 2010}}</ref>-2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article4371916.ece|title=Kay Saatchi on life after Charles Saatchi|last=Dougary|first=Ginny|work=The Times|publisher=Times Newspapers|date=2008-07-26|accessdate=26 February 2010}}</ref>), was a [[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications|Cond<U+00E9> Nast]] journalist. He married celebrity cook [[Nigella Lawson]] (his third wife) in 2003; they live in London with her two children Cosima and Bruno.<ref>Hilton, Beth.

In 2009 he published the book ''My Name Is Charles Saatchi And I Am An Artoholic''.<ref>ISBN 0-7148574-7-5</ref> Subtitled "Everything You Need To Know About Art, Ads, Life, God And Other Mysteries And Weren't Afraid To Ask", it presents Saatchi's answers to a number of questions submitted by members of the public and art fraternity.

In November to December 2009 he had a television programme on the [[BBC]] called [[School of Saatchi]] in which he gave young aspiring artists an opportunity to showcase their work. He made no appearance in the programme, only communicating through an assistant.

He bought his first painting in 1973 on a visit to Paris with his first wife, Doris Lockhart. This was a realist work by [[David Hepher]], a British artist, and was a detailed realist depiction of suburban houses. He established the [[Saatchi Gallery]] in 1985 at Boundary Road in [[St. John's Wood]], London.  His taste has mutated from "School of London", through American abstraction and minimalism, to the YBAs, whose work he first saw at the [[Freeze (exhibition)|Freeze]] exhibition.  His renown as a patron peaked in 1997 when part of his collection was shown at the [[Royal Academy]] as the exhibition ''[[Sensation exhibition|Sensation]]'', which travelled to Berlin and New York causing headlines and much offence (e.g., to families of children murdered by [[Myra Hindley]]) and consolidating the position of the YBAs.
