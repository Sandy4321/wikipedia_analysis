'''Interstate 15''' (I-15) is an [[Interstate Highway]], running from [[San Diego, California]], [[United States]], to the [[U.S.-Canadian border|Canadian border]], through [[Mohave County, Arizona|Mohave County]] in northwest [[Arizona]]. Despite being isolated from the rest of Arizona, in the remote [[Arizona Strip]], and short in length at {{convert|29.39|mi|km|2}}, it remains notable for its scenic passage through the [[Virgin River Gorge]]. The highway heads in a northeasterly direction from the [[Nevada]] border northeast of [[Mesquite, Nevada]], to the [[Utah]] border southwest of [[St. George, Utah]].

The south portion of I-15's route was built close to the alignment of the old [[U.S. Route 91 (Arizona)|U.S. Route 91]] (US 91), but the northern section, through the Virgin River Gorge, was built along roadless terrain. The southern section of the highway was complete and open in the early 1960s, but the gorge section was inaccessible until 1973.  When it opened, the Virgin River Gorge passage was the most expensive section of rural Interstate per mile.

[[Image:I15storm3.jpg|thumb|left|A storm rolls over the Virgin River Gorge]]
The highway enters the state in Mohave County northeast of [[Mesquite, Nevada|Mesquite]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], paralleling the old [[U.S. Route 91 (Arizona)|US 91]] heading northeast on an alignment north of the [[Virgin River]].  I-15 parallels the Virgin River for its entire length in Arizona, but the terrain abruptly becomes more rugged at mile 13, where the [[Virgin River Gorge]] begins.<ref name=USGS>{{cite web |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |title=USGS Topographic Maps via Terraserver-USA |url=http://terraserver-usa.com/ |accessdate=May 7, 2008}}</ref> The first interchange is exit 8 at [[Littlefield, Arizona|Littlefield]], where old US 91 turns north to avoid the gorge. I-15 crosses the river for the first time just beyond Littlefield, and soon passes another interchange serving local roads eastwards. This exit, exit 9, is a [[right-in/right-out]] design with [[frontage road]]s, constructed after the initial opening. Access under I-15 is provided just south of the ramps.<ref name=USGS/>

[[Image:Cedarpkt.jpg|thumb|I-15 at exit 18]]
Beyond exit 9, I-15 enters the Virgin River Gorge, first passing through "The Narrows". Here, the gorge features [[limestone]] cliffs that are as high as {{convert|500|ft|m}} above the highway.  Several pulloffs allow access to these cliffs.<ref name="Scenic driving">{{cite book |title=Scenic Driving Arizona |last=Green |first=Stewart |year=2003 |publisher=Falcon |isbn=0-7627-2701-2 |edition=2nd |page=24}}</ref>  Within the canyon, through which it ascends northbound and descends southbound, five bridges cross the river.<ref name=bridges>{{cite web |author=Arizona Department of Transportation |url=http://www.azdot.gov/Highways/bridge/BridgeInventory/PDF/BridgeInv-Flagstaff.pdf |format=PDF |title=Arizona State Highway System Bridge Record |accessdate=April 16, 2008}}</ref> The highway generally follows the winding course of the river, but several [[rock cut]]s bypass bends.<ref name=USGS/>

The canyon opens up slightly at the [[Cedar Pocket Reservoir|Cedar Pocket]] interchange (exit 18), allowing for a [[rest area]]. This rest area was turned over to the federal [[Bureau of Land Management]] in 2002 which maintains the nearby [[Virgin River Gorge Recreation Area]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Arizona Department of Transportation |title=Arizona Right-of-Way Resolution 2002-12-A-062 |date=December 20, 2002 |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |url=http://www.azhighwaydata.com/resolutions/pdf/resolutionfull/2002-12-A-062.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> The rest area was demolished in 2009. I-15 continues to parallel the Virgin River, but begins to deviate more.<ref name=USGS/> Trees here include [[tamarix]], [[ash tree|ash]], [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwoods]], [[willow]]s and [[Yucca brevifolia|Joshua trees]].  Wildflowers such as [[globemallow]], [[Tagetes|marigold]], and [[sand verbena]] dot the route in springtime.<ref name="Scenic driving"/>  At mile 22.5, the highway crosses the Virgin River for the final time, continuing east along the smaller [[Black Rock Gulch]] before then turning slightly northeast into a flatter area. The final interchange (exit 27) provides local access.

A [[weigh station]]/[[port of entry]] formerly served both sides of the road near mile 28 before the Utah state line.<ref name=USGS/> The weigh station/port of entry are now combined into a joint Arizona/Utah facility just north of the state line staffed by the [[Arizona Department of Transportation]] (DOT) Motor Vehicle Division and [[Utah DOT]] Motor Carrier Division.  I-15 continues on into Utah providing access to [[St. George, Utah|St. George]] as well as [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]].<ref name=USGS/>

== History ==
[[Image:Rockcut15.jpg|thumb|I-15 in afternoon light]]
The [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] from [[Southern California]] had two routes through northwestern Arizona, splitting at [[Littlefield, AZ|Littlefield]]; one went north towards central Utah, and the other went northeast through the Virgin River Gorge, straddling the state line to the [[Four Corners]] area.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[National Park Service]]|url=http://imgis.nps.gov/national_historic_trails.html|title=Old Spanish National Historic Trail|accessdate=August 9, 2007}}</ref> When the [[Arrowhead Trail (auto trail)|Arrowhead Trail]] was marked in the 1920s, and [[U.S. Route 91 (Arizona)|U.S. Route 91]] in 1926, automobile travelers between Nevada and Utah followed the northerly routing, turning east in Utah to reach [[St. George, UT|St. George]].<ref name="1926 Rand McNally">{{cite map |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |title=Auto Road Atlas |year=1926 |url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Southwest/Arizona/unitedstates1926ra_060.html |accessdate=April 16, 2008}}</ref>

When the Interstates were planned, federal authorities decided to save {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} over US 91 and pass through the [[Virgin River Gorge]] to take advantage of its scenery and lower grades for trucks.<ref name=Fresno/><ref name="costy"/>  Construction was completed first, in the early 1960s, on the portion between Nevada and the gorge.  The bridges over Big Bend Wash were completed in 1962.  The bridge over the Virgin River near Littlefield was completed by 1964.  By 1965, the overpass over Black Rock Road (northwards) was finally complete.<ref name=bridges/>

[[Image:Cedarpocketclouds.jpg|thumb|left|Cliffs sheathed in clouds along the highway]]
Construction through the gorge was slower and much more difficult, and the segment could not fully open until December 14, 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://interstate50th.org/history/2006-12-14.shtml |accessdate=April 16, 2008 |title=Today in Interstate History |publisher=[[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070927183420/http://www.interstate50th.org/history/2006-12-14.shtml |archivedate= September 27, 2007}}</ref>  To help quicken construction, the state of [[Utah]] loaned a portion of their federal highway funds to Arizona.<ref name="costy">{{cite news |work=[[The Progress]] |title=Costliest Interstate To Be in Arizona |date=October 15, 1969}}</ref> Even though the highway is of little importance to the transportation needs of Arizona, as it does not link any Arizona communities, it does serve as a vital link between [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] to the southwest.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Arizona Daily Sun]] |title=On Scenic Virgin River Gorge Road |date=June 16, 1972 |page=2}}</ref> Despite extra funding, however, challenges remained. Flash flooding and quicksand in the gorge repeatedly caused problems, with equipment and materials apparently disappearing overnight. Worse, the project was to claim a life, when in October 1969, a helicopter performing reconnaissance on the gorge crashed due to wind, killing the pilot. To help navigate the gorge's rugged and unforgiving terrain, a special piece of equipment called a [[swamp buggy]] had to be brought from [[Texas]].<ref name="problems">{{cite news |newspaper=Arizona Daily Sun |title=I-15 Project Surrounded by Problem s|page=13|date=December 18, 1973}}</ref> Even with this help, the route still demanded construction of four bridges over Virgin River. The westernmost bridge and the bridge carrying the northbound lanes at the third bridge location from the west were completed in 1972. By 1973, all five bridges were finally complete.<ref name=bridges/>

Even before its opening, it was promoted as the most scenic highway in the state; a 1988 article in ''[[Arizona Highways]]'' said that the project "enhanced rather than distracted from Nature's handiwork". The Virgin River was rechanneled 12 times in what was the most expensive rural freeway in the country, at the price of approximately $10&nbsp;million per mile ($49 million in 2007 dollars).<ref name=Fresno>{{cite news |publisher=[[Fresno Bee]] |title=Costliest Rural Freeway - $100 An Inch |date=November 26, 1972}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |url=http://www.environment.fhwa.dot.gov/histpres/highways_list.asp |title=Final List of Nationally and Exceptionally Significant Features of the Federal Interstate Highway System |accessdate=August 9, 2007}}</ref>
