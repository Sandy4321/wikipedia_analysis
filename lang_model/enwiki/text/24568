The '''2009 International Bowl''' was a postseason [[college football]] [[bowl game]] between the [[Connecticut Huskies football|Connecticut Huskies]] (UConn) and the [[Buffalo Bulls football|Buffalo Bulls]] at the [[Rogers Centre]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, on January&nbsp;3, 2009. The game was the final contest of the [[2008 NCAA Division I-FBS football season|2008 NCAA Division I-Football Bowl Subdivision (Division I-FBS) football season]]{{#tag:ref|In August 2006 the [[NCAA]] changed the name of [[Division I-A]] to [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) and [[Division I-AA]] to [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS).<ref name="ESPNNCAASubdivisionRename" /> In this article the old names are used when referring to events before August 2006; the new names are used when referring to events after August 2006.| group="Note"| name="NCAADivisionINote"}} for both teams, and ended in a 38<U+2013>20 victory for Connecticut. UConn represented the [[Big East Conference]] (Big East) in the game; Buffalo entered as the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC) champion.

Connecticut was selected as a participant in the 2009 International Bowl following a 7<U+2013>5 [[Season (sports)|regular season]] where they won their first five games, only to lose five of their last seven contests. Facing the Huskies were the Buffalo Bulls with a regular season record of 8<U+2013>5, highlighted by an upset win over then-No.&nbsp;12<ref name="APPollNote" group="Note" /> and undefeated [[2008 Ball State Cardinals football team|Ball State]] in the [[2008 MAC Championship Game]]. Pre-game media coverage focused on the legacy of the 1958 Buffalo Bulls, the first team from the university to be invited to a bowl game. When told that the two [[African-American]] members of the team would not be allowed to play because of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], the team elected to refuse the bowl bid. Buffalo would not play in a bowl until this game, 50&nbsp;years later.<ref name="ESPNAllOrNothing" />

The game began at 12:00&nbsp;PM [[North American Eastern Time Zone|EST]]. Connecticut, led by [[running back]] [[Donald Brown (American football)|Donald Brown's]] 208&nbsp;yards rushing, dominated the first half statistically,<ref name="UConnFBMediaGuideP140" /> but found themselves down 20<U+2013>10 midway through the second quarter because they committed six [[fumbles]], five of which were recovered by Buffalo. UConn would close the gap to 20<U+2013>17 by halftime, and take the lead for good late in the third quarter off a 4-yard [[touchdown]] [[Forward pass|pass]] from [[quarterback]] [[Tyler Lorenzen]] to [[tight end]] Steve Brouse. The Connecticut victory was sealed when, late in the fourth quarter, Buffalo quarterback [[Drew Willy]] threw a pass that was [[interception|intercepted]] by UConn [[safety (American football position)|safety]] Dahna Deleston and returned 100&nbsp;yards for a touchdown.

UConn junior running back [[Donald Brown (American football)|Donald Brown]] was named [[player of the game#United States college basketball and football|player of the game]].<ref name="IntBowlHistory" /> He finished with 261&nbsp;rushing yards and one&nbsp;touchdown; his 2,083&nbsp;rushing&nbsp;yards for the 2008 season was best in the NCAA.<ref name="ESPNrecap" /> Following the game, Brown declared his eligibility for the [[2009 NFL Draft]]; he would become the first Connecticut player ever drafted in the first round.<ref name="NorwichBulletinNFLDraft" /> Three other UConn players were drafted in the second round.<ref name="NorwichBulletinNFLDraft" />

==Team selection==
[[File:AILAFM Toronto Skyline.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Toronto, home of the International Bowl]]
The International Bowl had contracts with the [[Big East]] and [[Mid-American Conference]]s that allowed them to select one team from each conference to participate in their annual game. By virtue of being the Big East champion [[2008 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]] was awarded an automatic [[Bowl Championship Series]] berth; they would play in the [[2009 Orange Bowl]]. The [[2009 Gator Bowl|Gator Bowl]] and [[2008 Sun Bowl|Sun Bowl]] shared the second pick of Big East teams; after the Gator Bowl opted to select [[Big 12]] member [[2008 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] and the Sun Bowl learned that they would not be allowed to select [[2008 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]], [[2008 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pittsburgh]] received the Sun Bowl invitation. The [[2008 Meineke Car Care Bowl|Meineke Car Care Bowl]], which had the third selection, picked [[2008 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia]].<ref name="SIStewartMandelFinal2008Bowls" /> The fourth, fifth, and sixth selections of Big East teams belonged collectively to the International Bowl, [[2008 PapaJohns.com Bowl|PapaJohns.com Bowl]], and [[2008 St. Petersburg Bowl|St. Petersburg Bowl]], which, in consultation with the Big East, decided which schools were the best fit for each bowl. There were three remaining bowl-eligible Big East teams: Connecticut, [[2008 Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team|Rutgers]], and [[2008 South Florida Bulls football team|South Florida]]. The previous season, Rutgers had played in the International Bowl and South Florida had appeared in the PapaJohns.com Bowl; bowls in general dislike inviting the same team in consecutive years, on the theory that fans are less likely to want to travel to the same destination they were at the year before.<ref name="StarLedgerBowlSelection" /> Additionally, the St. Petersburg Bowl, in its inaugural year, sought to have local team South Florida play in their game to drive local attendance.<ref name="TBOBullsBid" /> Therefore, the teams were apportioned among the bowls as follows: South Florida to the St. Petersburg Bowl, Rutgers to the PapaJohns.com Bowl, and Connecticut to the International Bowl.<ref name="SIStewartMandelFinal2008Bowls" /> On December&nbsp;7,&nbsp;2008, UConn formally accepted the bowl invitation, the third in their history.<ref name="SeattlePI" />

Buffalo accepted an invitation to the International Bowl following their victory over then-undefeated [[2008 Ball State Cardinals football team|Ball State]] in the [[2008 MAC Championship Game]]. Although in past years the MAC champion had been invited to the [[Motor City Bowl]], Buffalo preferred to go to the International Bowl due to Toronto being closer to the school than [[Detroit]], the home of the Motor City Bowl.<ref name="CFN2008MACChampionshipPreview" /> The game marked the first bowl for the Bulls after their first MAC Championship since moving to [[Division I-A]]<ref name="NCAADivisionINote" group="Note" /> and joining the MAC in 1999.<ref name="ESPNpreview" />

The Bulls and Huskies had been frequent opponents during the previous decade as both programs made the transition from [[Division I-AA]] to Division I-A.<ref name="NCAADivisionINote" group="Note" /> The two teams played each other in six consecutive seasons from 1999 to 2005, with Connecticut winning five of the six contents. The 2005 game, won by UConn 38<U+2013>0, was the most recent meeting between the two teams. Overall, the Huskies and Bulls had played each other 16 times since their first meeting in 1939, with Connecticut holding a 12<U+2013>4 advantage in the all-time series.<ref name="UConnFBMediaGuideP126-127" /> Prior to the 2008 season, Buffalo and UConn had signed a contract to play a four-game, home-and-home series beginning in 2010.<ref name="UBUConnSeries" />

===Buffalo===
{{main|2008 Buffalo Bulls football team}}
[[File:Drew Willy.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|Buffalo quarterback [[Drew Willy]], in 2005]]
Entering 2008, the Bulls sought to build off of their [[2007 Buffalo Bulls football team|2007 season]], where they shared the MAC East championship but did not appear in the championship game due to a 31<U+2013>28 loss to fellow division co-champion [[2007 Miami RedHawks football team|Miami (Ohio)]]. Their 5<U+2013>7 final record, while not good enough to [[Bowl eligibility|qualify]] for a bowl game, was still the best by a Buffalo team since they had moved up to Division I-A in 1999.<ref name="CFN2008BuffaloPreview" /><ref name="NCAADivisionINote" group="Note" /> With 10 starters returning on offense and eight on defense,<ref name="ESPN2008MACEastPreview" /> the 2008 team was predicted to be perhaps the most talented team in Bulls history; however, due to their challenging schedule, their final record was predicted to be no better than 3<U+2013>9.<ref name="CFN2008BuffaloPreview" />

Buffalo opened the season stronger than expected, with a dominant home win over the [[2008 UTEP Miners football team|University of Texas-El Paso]] (UTEP), 42<U+2013>17.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsUTEPRecap" /> This was followed by a closer-than-predicted loss at heavily favored Pittsburgh, 27<U+2013>16.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsPittRecap" /> Buffalo's third game and conference opener, versus [[2008 Temple Owls football team|Temple]], was a back-and-forth contest that came down to the final play of the game. Keeping the game within seven points for the first three quarters, the Bulls first took the lead with 2:27 left in the fourth quarter, on a 25-yard [[Field goal (American football)|field goal]] by A.J. Principe.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsTempleRecap" /> Temple responded with a nine-play, 74-yard drive capped by a 11-yard touchdown catch by wide receiver Bruce Francis, his second score of the game, to take a 28<U+2013>24 lead with only 38&nbsp;seconds remaining. Taking over at their own 40-yard line after the kickoff went out of bounds, the Bulls drove down the field, scoring the game-winning touchdown on a 35-yard desperation heave from Drew Willy to wide receiver Naaman Roosevelt with no time remaining on the clock.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsTemplePbPQ4" /> Buffalo's record following the last-second win was 2<U+2013>1, marking the first time since 1969 that the Bulls had a record over .500 beyond Week 1 as a Division I-A team. The last time the Bulls had started a season 2<U+2013>1 was 1998, while they were still played in Division I-AA.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsTempleRecap" /><ref name="NCAADivisionINote" group="Note" />

The Bulls proceeded to lose their next three games.<ref name="WBIRBuffaloReview" /> Buffalo was unable to keep up with No.&nbsp;5-ranked<ref name="AP Wk3" /><ref name="APPollNote" group="Note" /> [[2008 Missouri Tigers football team|Missouri]], losing 42<U+2013>21 in a game that Missouri saw as a tuneup for their later season.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsMissouriRecap" /> In the next contest, against MAC opponent [[2008 Central Michigan Chippewas football team|Central Michigan]], down nine&nbsp;points with under three&nbsp;minutes left Buffalo scored on a 65-yard pass to James Starks, recovered an [[onside kick]] to retain possession, and attempted a game-winning field goal<U+2014>but A.J. Principe's 46-yard kick hit the right goalpost to give Central Michigan the victory.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsCentralMichiganRecap" /> In the next game, against the [[2008 Western Michigan Broncos football team|Western Michigan Broncos]], also in the MAC, Buffalo squandered a two-touchdown advantage with just over five minutes left, allowing the Broncos to win the game in [[Overtime (sports)#College, high-school, and Canadian football|overtime]]. Buffalo's overall record fell to 2<U+2013>4, 1<U+2013>2 in the MAC.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsWesternMichiganRecap" />

Bouncing back, Buffalo won their next five games.<ref name="WBIRBuffaloReview" /> Against [[2008 Army Black Knights football team|Army]], Buffalo reversed the result of the Western Michigan game, coming back from a two-touchdown deficit to win in overtime.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsArmyRecap" /> Handling conference opponents [[2008 Ohio Bobcats football team|Ohio]] and [[2008 Miami RedHawks football team|Miami (Ohio)]] with relative ease,<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsOhioRecap" /><ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsMiamiOHRecap" /> Buffalo continued conference play by beating [[2008 Akron Zips football team|Akron]] in a four-hour, four-overtime slugfest, 43<U+2013>40, in Akron's final football game at the [[Rubber Bowl]].<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsAkronRecap" /> In their next game, against [[2008 Bowling Green Falcons football team|Bowling Green]], the Bulls found themselves down 21<U+2013>0 midway through the third quarter, but still managed to come back for their third overtime win of the season.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsBowlingGreenRecap" /> With the win, Buffalo clinched the MAC East championship and ensured that they would have their first winning regular season since moving to Division I-A;<ref name="NCAADivisionINote" group="Note" /> the final regular season game, a 24<U+2013>21 loss to [[2008 Kent State Golden Flashes football team|Kent State]], was only a formality.<ref name="WBIRBuffaloReview" /> The Bulls finished the regular season with an overall record of 7<U+2013>5, 5<U+2013>3 within the conference.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsBallStatePreview" />

Buffalo's opponent in the 2008 MAC Championship Game would be the No.&nbsp;12-ranked<ref name="AP Wk13" /><ref name="APPollNote" group="Note" /> [[2008 Ball State Cardinals football team|Ball State Cardinals]], who had gone undefeated in winning the MAC West.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsBallStatePreview" /> Ball State was a two-touchdown favorite entering the game;<ref name="CFN2008MACChampionshipPreview" /> Buffalo in its history was 0<U+2013>5 against the Cardinals.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsBallStatePreview" /> The Bulls struck first with a touchdown late in the first quarter; Ball State responded with a touchdown and a field goal in the second quarter to take a 10<U+2013>7 lead at the half. The two teams traded touchdowns early in the third quarter.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsBallStateRecap" /> Disaster then struck for Ball State: on two consecutive possessions late in the third quarter, after having driven into the [[Red zone (football)|red zone]], the Cardinals fumbled the ball. Buffalo returned both of these fumbles for touchdowns and took a lead they would not surrender.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsBallStatePbPQ3" /> The Bulls won the game 42<U+2013>24, earning their first-ever MAC Championship as well as their first-ever win over a ranked opponent in nine attempts.<ref name="ESPN2008BuffalovsBallStateRecap" />

===Connecticut===
{{main|2008 Connecticut Huskies football team}}
The Huskies entered 2008 seeking to prove their success [[2007 Connecticut Huskies football team|the previous season]] was no fluke. In 2007, Connecticut earned their first Big East co-championship, albeit after losing to their fellow co-champion, [[2007 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia]], 66<U+2013>21. A loss to [[2007 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team|Wake Forest]] in the [[2007 Meineke Car Care Bowl]]<U+2014>the team's second bowl appearance all-time<U+2014>gave the Huskies a final 2007 record of 9<U+2013>4.<ref name="CFN2008UConnPreview" /> In the Big East preseason media poll, UConn was picked to finish 6th overall in the conference.<ref name="CourantBigEastMediaPoll" />

UConn started the season strong, winning their first five games.<ref name="CFN2008UConnReview" /> The Huskies easily won their first game 35<U+2013>3 against Division I-Football Championship Subdivision (Division I-FCS)<ref name="NCAADivisionINote" group="Note" /> opponent [[Hofstra University|Hofstra]].<ref name="ESPN2008UConnvsHofstraRecap" /> The second game, at Temple, was played as the remnants of [[Hurricane Hanna (2008)|Hurricane Hanna]] hit Philadelphia. UConn won 12<U+2013>9 in overtime as Donald Brown ran for a then-career high 214&nbsp;yards and scored the game-winning touchdown.<ref name="CourantJeffJacobsSept7" /> Connecticut next avenged their loss to [[2008 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia]] from 2007, winning the rematch 45<U+2013>10.<ref name="ESPN2008UConnvsVirginiaRecap" /> [[2008 Baylor Bears football team|Baylor]] was next on the schedule; the Huskies pulled out the win in a back-and-forth game, 31<U+2013>28.<ref name="ESPN2008UConnvsBaylorRecap" /> Connecticut opened Big East conference play in their next game against [[2008 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]. The game was not decided until UConn [[linebacker]] [[Lawrence Wilson]] returned an interception for a touchdown with 2:45 left in the fourth quarter, giving the Huskies a 26<U+2013>21 lead they would not relinquish. This was the second straight season where Connecticut won their first five games; before 2007, they had not opened a season so successfully since 1995, when they won their first six straight.<ref name="ESPN2008UConnvsLouisvilleRecap" /> Following the game, UConn achieved their first and only ranking of the year, appearing at No.&nbsp;24 in the [[AP Poll|Associated Press]] (AP)<ref name="AP Wk6" /> and [[Harris poll|Harris]]<ref name="Harris Wk6" /> polls and No.&nbsp;23 in the [[Coaches' poll]].<ref name="Coach Wk6" /> However, starting quarterback [[Tyler Lorenzen]] broke his foot in the Louisville game; the Huskies would be forced to rely on backup [[Zach Frazer]] for the next few games.<ref name="ESPN2008UConnvsLouisvilleRecap" />

The Huskies were unable to match their early success in the second half of the season, losing five of their next seven games. Everything went wrong for UConn in their game at [[2008 North Carolina Tar Heels football team|North Carolina]], as Frazer was intercepted three times and three Connecticut punts were blocked; North Carolina won in a blowout, 38<U+2013>12.<ref name="ESPN2008UConnvsUNCRecap" /> Against Big East rival Rutgers, UConn lost 12<U+2013>10 as [[Placekicker|kicker]] Tony Ciaravino missed three field goals, including one with 1:09 left in the game that hit the right goalpost.<ref name="ESPN2008UConnvsRutgersRecap" /> The Huskies bounced back in their next game against eventual Big East champion Cincinnati, winning in a blowout 40<U+2013>16.<ref name="ESPN2008UConnvsCincinnatiRecap" /> While not ranked in any of the polls, after the win Connecticut found itself No.&nbsp;25 in the BCS standings. The Huskies would promptly give up that honor, losing to West Virginia 35<U+2013>13 after leading 10<U+2013>0 at the end of the first quarter and 13<U+2013>7 at halftime.<ref name="ESPN2008UConnvsWVURecap" /> UConn would win the next week at Big East bottom-dweller [[2008 Syracuse Orange football team|Syracuse]], 39<U+2013>14, as Lorenzen returned from his injury.<ref name="CourantSyracuseRecap" /> This would prove to be their last win of the regular season, as the Huskies finished with losses to South Florida (17<U+2013>13) and No.&nbsp;23-ranked<ref name="AP Wk13" /><ref name="APPollNote" group="Note" /> Pittsburgh (34<U+2013>10). Connecticut ended the regular season with a record of 7<U+2013>5, 3<U+2013>4 within the Big East conference.<ref name="ESPN2008UConnSchedule" />

==Pregame buildup==
[[File:Turner Gill Introduction.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Buffalo Bulls head coach [[Turner Gill]]]]
In the weeks leading up to the game, media coverage focused on the achievements of the Buffalo Bulls.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlPreview" /> Buffalo had been one of the least-successful programs in college football from their transition to Division I-A in 1999 to 2006, during which they had a cumulative record of 12<U+2013>79.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlProfiles" /><ref name="NCAADivisionINote" group="Note" /> In 2008, the Bulls had their first winning season since 1996, won five games in a row for the first time since 1986, beat a ranked team for the first time in program history with their upset victory over Ball State in the MAC Championship Game, and would be making the first bowl appearance in school history.<ref name="ESPNpreview" /> The turnaround of the Buffalo program brought acclaim to Bulls head coach [[Turner Gill]], who had taken over the team in 2007.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlProfiles" />

Comparatively, Connecticut was an afterthought heading into the game.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlPreview" /> Pre-bowl coverage of UConn focused on NCAA rushing leader Donald Brown, who was considering foregoing his senior season to enter the 2009 NFL Draft. Brown indicated before the game that he had decided to return to UConn for the 2010 season.<ref name="ESPNDonaldBrownReturn" />

===Coaching change rumors===
Following the regular season, speculation surrounded whether Turner Gill would leave Buffalo for another school's head coaching position. He was identified as a candidate at two schools: [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]] and [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]].<ref name="ESPNTurnerGillCoachingRumors" /> In neither case was Gill hired; Syracuse opted for [[New Orleans Saints]] [[offensive coordinator]] [[Doug Marrone]],<ref name="ESPNSyracuseHiresDougMarrone" /> while Auburn passed him over in favor of [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State]] head coach [[Gene Chizik]], a move that prominent former [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) player, [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall-of-Famer]], and Auburn alumnus [[Charles Barkley]] claimed was due to racism.<ref name="BirminghamNewsCharlesBarkley" /> Gill ended up signing a contract extension with Buffalo.<ref name="USATodayTurnerGill" />

UConn head coach [[Randy Edsall]], who had been with the Huskies since 1999, was also rumored to be a candidate for the Syracuse job. Edsall, a Syracuse alumnus, denied any interest.<ref name="ESPNRandyEdsallSyracuse" /> [[Offensive coordinator]] [[Rob Ambrose]] accepted the head coaching position at [[Towson Tigers football|Towson]], his [[alma mater]]; he would stay to coach UConn during the bowl game, however.<ref name="ESPNRobAmbrose" />

===Legacy of the 1958 Buffalo Bulls===
While the 2009 International Bowl marked the first appearance of the Buffalo Bulls in a bowl game, it was not the first time the school had been invited to a bowl. Fifty years earlier, the 1958 Buffalo Bulls team finished with a record of 8<U+2013>1. They were awarded the [[Lambert Cup]], given to the best small college team in the eastern US, and received a bid to play in the [[1958 Tangerine Bowl (December)|1958 Tangerine Bowl]], where they would face [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]]. There was one catch: the team's [[African-American]] players<U+2014>starting running back [[Willie Evans (running back)|Willie Evans]] and backup defensive end Mike Wilson<U+2014>would not be allowed to play. The [[Citrus Bowl|Tangerine Bowl Stadium]] was controlled by the Orlando High School Athletic Association, who prohibited [[Racial segregation in the United States|integrated]] football games. University officials and the coaching staff decided to allow the team to vote on whether they would accept the bowl bid. Before secret ballots could be passed out, the players unanimously decided to reject the bid.<ref name="ESPNAllOrNothing" />

Surviving members of the 1958 Bulls team were invited to the 2009 International Bowl and were honored before the game.<ref name="UBIntBowl" /> The Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] spoke at the kickoff luncheon prior to the game, paying tribute to the legacy of the 1958 team.<ref name="NorwichCitizenJesseJackson" />

===Offensive matchups===
====Buffalo offense====
Buffalo featured a high-powered, high-tempo, balanced offense that was good at not committing turnovers.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlPreview" /><ref name="ESPNUConnAtonement" /> During the regular season the Bulls averaged 380.5&nbsp;offensive&nbsp;yards per game, 45th&nbsp;best in the nation, and scored an average of 31.3&nbsp;points per game, 31st&nbsp;best. Buffalo's [[turnover (football)|turnover]] margin was 6th&nbsp;best in the nation, at +1.15.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlPreview" />

The Bulls were led offensively by the triple threat of quarterback [[Drew Willy]], running back [[James Starks]], and wide receiver Namaan Roosevelt. The three combined to break 14&nbsp;single-season school records, including most points scored in a season (404).<ref name="ESPNpreview" /> Willy, heading into his final game as a Buffalo Bull, had already surpassed the 3,000-yard mark in passing on the season, throwing for 25&nbsp;touchdowns against only five&nbsp;interceptions.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlProfiles" /> Starks, while not seen as the same caliber of player as UConn's Donald Brown, had run for over 1,300&nbsp;yards and caught 41&nbsp;passes for 340&nbsp;yards, scoring 16&nbsp;touchdowns on the year. Roosevelt was seen as the top playmaker, going over the 100-yard mark in each of Buffalo's last five&nbsp;games and scoring at least once in his last seven.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlPreview" />

====Connecticut offense====
[[File:Tyler Lorenzen at 2010 UConn Spring Game.JPG|thumb|left|200px|alt=|Despite missing time during the season with a foot injury, quarterback [[Tyler Lorenzen]] would start for UConn in the 2009 International Bowl.]]
Especially compared to Buffalo, the UConn offense was extremely unbalanced; the Huskies ranked 19th in the nation in running, averaging 204.6&nbsp;yards per game, but only 106th in the nation in passing, averaging 147.3&nbsp;yards per game. Connecticut's offense was centered around running back [[Donald Brown (American football)|Donald Brown]]. Described as "the ultimate workhorse", Brown led the NCAA in rushing going into the game with 1,822&nbsp;yards.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlPreview" /> He had already tied the school single-season rushing touchdown record with 17 scores. His dominant performance led to him being named the Big East offensive player of the year<ref name="ESPNpreview" /> as well as an [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] by multiple organizations.<ref name="CourantDonaldBrownAllAmerican" /> Somewhat surprisingly, he was not a finalist for the [[Doak Walker Award]], annually given to the best running back in college football;<ref name="CourantDonaldBrownDoakWalker" /> the award was eventually won by [[Shonn Greene]] of [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]].<ref name="ESPNShonnGreeneDoakWalker" /> UConn's rushing attack was supplemented by the efforts of quarterback Tyler Lorenzen and running back Jordan Todman.<ref name="ESPNUConn2008Statistics" />

The Huskies struggled to pass the ball all season, only completing four touchdown passes as a team heading into the International Bowl.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlPreview" /> Lorenzen completed under half of his passing attempts on the season. He threw for 820&nbsp;yards with more interceptions (eight) than touchdowns (two). Nevertheless, before the game Randy Edsall confirmed that Lorenzen would be the starting quarterback for UConn in the International Bowl. This would be his ninth appearance at quarterback on the season; he missed four games with a broken right foot.<ref name="CourantTylerLorenzenStart" />

===Defensive matchups===
====Buffalo defense====
The Buffalo defense was described as "among the worst in the MAC, meaning it's among the worst in college football".<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlPreview" /> In Division I-FBS,<ref name="NCAADivisionINote" group="Note" /> the Bulls ranked 84th in total defense, allowing an average of 408&nbsp;yards per game. Buffalo's run defense was 83rd in the country, allowing 141.1&nbsp;yards per game; their pass defense was ranked 97th, allowing almost 250&nbsp;yards per game. The Bulls allowed other teams to score an average of 27&nbsp;points against them per game, which ranked 73rd in the country.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlPreview" />

Buffalo did have one strength on defense: forcing turnovers. The Bulls recovered 20&nbsp;fumbles and caught eight&nbsp;interceptions on the year. Buffalo's turnover margin of +1.15 was 6th&nbsp;best in the nation.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlPreview" />

====Connecticut defense====
Conversely, UConn boasted one of the better defenses in the country. The Huskies allowed the 10th-fewest yards per game in the nation with 281&nbsp;yards allowed.<ref name="ESPNpreview" /> Connecticut was especially good against the pass; they allowed an average of only 165&nbsp;yards per game, seventh-best in the country. No UConn opponent passed for more than 259&nbsp;yards during the regular season.<ref name="ESPNCFNBPreview" />

The Huskies had several standout players on defense. One was [[defensive end]] [[Cody Brown]], who led UConn with 14&nbsp;tackles for a loss (TFL) and nine&nbsp;[[Quarterback sack|sacks]] while also being named to the All-Big East first team. [[Cornerback]] [[Jasper Howard]] was another standout player: he had 37&nbsp;tackles and four&nbsp;interceptions on the year while also leading the Big East in punt returns.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlProfiles" />

==Game summary==
[[File:2009 International Bowl Rogers Centre exterior.jpg|thumb|alt=|[[Rogers Centre]] was the site of the 2009 International Bowl.]]

The 2009 International Bowl kicked off on January&nbsp;3, 2009, at 12:00&nbsp;PM in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Official attendance was listed at 40,184, the highest in the history of the International Bowl. The attendance record was largely due to Buffalo fans; an estimated 30,000 attended the game.<ref name="UBIntBowl" /> [[John Saunders (journalist)|John Saunders]], [[Jesse Palmer]], and [[Doug Flutie]], all with ties to Canada, were the announcers for the television broadcast, which aired on [[ESPN2]].<ref name="CourantBroadcastTeam" /><ref name="RogersCentreBroadcastTeam" /> The game was watched by over 2&nbsp;million&nbsp;households with a rating of 2.12, both the highest in International Bowl history.<ref name="UConnFBMediaGuideP102" /> Prior to the game, [[spread betting|spread bettors]] favored Connecticut to win by four&nbsp;and&nbsp;a&nbsp;half&nbsp;points.<ref name="CFN2009IntBowlPreview" />

===First quarter===
[[File:2009 International Bowl pregame UCMB.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|The [[University of Connecticut]] marching band performing prior to kickoff]]
Buffalo received the ball first to begin the game, and returned the opening [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]] to their own 24-yard line. They were unable to move the ball in three&nbsp;plays, and [[Punt (football)|punted]] the ball to Connecticut. The Huskies took possession on their own 18-yard line and drove down the field with alternating rushes by [[running back]] [[Donald Brown (American football)|Donald Brown]] and [[quarterback]] [[Tyler Lorenzen]], earning two [[first downs]]. On 2nd&nbsp;down&nbsp;and&nbsp;5 from the UConn 49-yard line, Lorenzen was [[Quarterback sack|sacked]] by Buffalo's Sherrod Lott and [[fumble]]d; the ball was recovered by UConn [[right tackle]] [[Mike Hicks (American football)|Mike Hicks]], allowing the Huskies to retain possession. A [[Holding (American football)|holding penalty]] on the next play called on UConn [[left tackle]] [[William Beatty (American football)|William Beatty]] set up 3rd-and-24. Donald Brown rushed for fifteen&nbsp;yards but was unable to reach the first-down marker, forcing UConn to punt.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ1" />

Buffalo took over at their own 19-yard line and promptly earned their 1st&nbsp;first&nbsp;down of the game on a 10-yard&nbsp;pass from quarterback [[Drew Willy]] to [[wide receiver]] [[Naaman Roosevelt]]. The Bulls' drive stalled from there, forcing them to punt. The punt struck the ground and hit UConn's Jonathan Jean-Louis, who was attempting to block for the punt return; Buffalo recovered the loose ball, giving them back possession at the Connecticut 23-yard line. The Bulls were unable to move the ball any closer to the [[end zone]], and settled for a 38-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] by [[Placekicker|kicker]] A. J. Principe, giving them a 3<U+2013>0 lead with 4:26 remaining in the first quarter.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ1" />

The ensuing kickoff was returned by UConn running back Jordan Todman 45&nbsp;yards to the Buffalo 45-yard line. On the first play from [[Line of scrimmage|scrimmage]], Donald Brown broke through the Buffalo defense and ran the length of the field for the first [[touchdown]] of the day. UConn kicker Dave Teggart's [[conversion (gridiron football)|extra point attempt]] was good, giving UConn their first lead of the day, at 7<U+2013>3.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ1" />

Buffalo got the ball back at their own 21-yard line and were only able to advance it to their 34-yard line before punting the ball back to Connecticut. UConn [[cornerback]] [[Jasper Howard]] returned the ball 26&nbsp;yards to the Bulls' 41-yard line. The Huskies handed the ball to Donald Brown for five straight running plays, advancing the ball to the Buffalo 19-yard line as the first quarter clock expired. At the end of the first quarter, UConn held a 7<U+2013>3 lead and looked to be in position to score more when the second quarter began.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ1" />

===Second quarter===
[[File:2009 International Bowl Game Action.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Buffalo on offense on the 21-yard line]]
UConn began the second quarter by having Tyler Lorenzen rush the ball for four yards. On 3rd and 7, Lorenzen attempted his first pass of the game, which was behind Husky wide receiver Michael Smith. Dave Teggart kicked a 32-yard field goal to increase Connecticut's lead to 10<U+2013>3.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ2" />

The Bulls began their next drive at their own 26-yard line, but went [[three-and-out]]. Buffalo [[Punter (football)|punter]] Peter Fardon kicked the ball over the head of UConn returner Jasper Howard; rather than let the ball go, he ran backwards chasing after it. Trying to grab the ball over his shoulder, he [[Muffed punt|muffed]] the catch, and the ball bounced into the end zone, where it was recovered by Buffalo's Ray Anthony Long for a Bull touchdown. The [[special-teams]] miscue by Howard allowed Buffalo to tie the game at 10<U+2013>10 with 11:36 remaining in the second quarter.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ2" />

UConn's turnover woes continued on their next possession when, on their second play from scrimmage after receiving Buffalo's kickoff, Tyler Lorenzen was sacked, causing him to fumble the ball. The Bulls recovered and drove down the field to the UConn 12-yard line where they were stopped. Principe kicked a 29-yard field goal giving Buffalo back the lead, at 13<U+2013>10.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ2" />

The ensuing kickoff saw yet another Connecticut special-teams blunder. UConn running back Robbie Frey misplayed the ball off of the kickoff, letting it roll back into the end zone. Frey recovered the loose ball;<ref name="ESPNPbPQ2" /> if he had simply taken a knee, by rule it would have been a [[touchback]] and the Huskies would have gotten the ball at their own 20-yard line.<ref name="ESPNrecap" /> Instead, Frey carried the ball out of the end zone, was hit at the 4-yard line, and fumbled. Buffalo recovered and promptly scored on a 4-yard touchdown run by Bull running back [[James Starks]], giving themselves a 20<U+2013>10 lead. UConn had committed its fifth fumble of the game, four of which were recovered by Buffalo. All of Buffalo's 20 points were directly off of UConn turnovers.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ2" />

Connecticut fumbled the ball for the sixth time on the next possession; this time Donald Brown was responsible for dropping the ball. Buffalo recovered for the fifth time, but was unable to score, punting to ball back to UConn with 4:37 left in the half. Brown made up for his earlier mistake by breaking off a 75-yard run before being caught from behind. On the next play Tyler Lorenzen ran the ball in to the end zone from 13&nbsp;yards out. Neither team scored for the remainder of the first half, making the score 20<U+2013>17 Buffalo going into halftime.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ2" />

===Third quarter===
[[File:UConn UBuffalo 01.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|Connecticut versus Buffalo]]
Connecticut received the ball to start the third quarter and drove down the field on rushing plays by Donald Brown, Jordan Todman and Tyler Lorenzen, before the drive stalled at the Buffalo 36-yard line. UConn punter Desi Cullen's punt was downed at the Buffalo 1-yard line, pinning them against their own end zone. The Bulls were unable to move the ball, punting the ball back to UConn after three plays. Starting from their own 44-yard line, the Huskies drove to within the Buffalo 10-yard line; an [[Offside (American football)|offside penalty]] on Buffalo's Jerry Housey gave UConn a 1st-and-goal at the Buffalo 4-yard line. Connecticut used a [[play-action pass]], only their second pass attempt of the game, to fool the Bulls; UConn [[tight end]] Steve Brouse was wide open in the end zone, catching the ball for the touchdown and giving Connecticut back the lead at 24<U+2013>20 with 5:22 left in the third quarter.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ3" />

Buffalo received the ball off the kickoff on their own 28-yard line. Losing eight&nbsp;yards on their three&nbsp;plays, Buffalo once again punted the ball to Connecticut. UConn drove to the Buffalo 25-yard line and attempted a 42-yard field goal; the kick by Dave Teggart was blocked. Buffalo got the ball back with less than a minute left in the quarter and completed two&nbsp;passes, moving the ball 13&nbsp;yards down the field before the quarter expired. The score remained in Connecticut's favor, 24<U+2013>20.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ3" />

===Fourth quarter===
[[File:UConn vs UBuffalo 02.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Huskies in blue versus Bulls in white]]
Buffalo began the final quarter with the ball in a 2nd-and-11 situation and were unable to convert the first down. UConn received Buffalo's punt and were also unable to move the ball, going three-and-out and punting back to the Bulls. On their next possession Buffalo managed to get a first down off of a Drew Willy pass to tight end Jesse Rack, but were unable to move the ball further than UConn's 49-yard line and punted again.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ4" />

Connecticut took over at their own 32-yard line and, after throwing only two&nbsp;passes in the first three&nbsp;quarters, completed three&nbsp;passes over 10&nbsp;yards apiece to move down the field. On a 2nd-and-5 from the Buffalo 15-yard line, Tyler Lorenzen scored his second rushing touchdown of the game. UConn's lead was extended to 31<U+2013>20 with less than five&nbsp;minutes left in the game.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ4" />

Receiving the ball at their own 8-yard line following a penalty on the kickoff return, Buffalo began to move down the field, with Drew Willy completing a 38-yard pass to wideout Brett Hamlin and a 29-yard pass to Naaman Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-4 from the Connecticut 19-yard line, Willy completed a ten-yard pass to James Starks, giving the Bulls a 1st-and-goal. Starks rushed for four&nbsp;yards on first&nbsp;down; on second&nbsp;down, Willy threw an incomplete pass intended for Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-goal from the Husky 5-yard line, Willy attempted a pass that was deflected and [[Interception (football)|intercepted]] by UConn [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] Dahna Deleston, who returned the ball 100&nbsp;yards for the game-sealing touchdown. UConn won the game 38<U+2013>20.<ref name="ESPNPbPQ4" />

[[File:Donald Brown at 2010 UConn Spring Game.JPG|thumb|left|alt=|2009 International Bowl MVP [[Donald Brown (American football)|Donald Brown]]]]
For his performance in the 2009 International Bowl, Connecticut running back Donald Brown was named the player of the game. Brown rushed for 261&nbsp;yards and one&nbsp;touchdown on 29&nbsp;attempts.<ref name="ESPNrecap" /> He finished the 2008 college football season with 2,083&nbsp;rushing&nbsp;yards which led the nation.<ref name="NYTDonaldBrown" /> Brown set several new UConn school records, including the single-season records for rushing yards (2,083), attempts (367), and yards per game (160.2),<ref name="UConnFBMediaGuideP153" /> the career records for rushing yards (3,800) and attempts (698),<ref name="UConnFBMediaGuideP148" /> and the record for consecutive games with at least 100&nbsp;yards&nbsp;rushing (8).<ref name="UConnFBMediaGuideP153" /> His performance did not break the International Bowl rushing records, however; [[2008 International Bowl|the previous year]] [[2007 Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team|Rutgers]] running back [[Ray Rice]] ran for 280&nbsp;yards and four&nbsp;touchdowns.<ref name="MSNBC2008IntBowl" />

Brown's dominant rushing performance was supplemented by RB Jordan Todman's 62&nbsp;yards on seven&nbsp;attempts, QB Tyler Lorenzen's 32&nbsp;yards on twelve&nbsp;attempts, including two&nbsp;touchdowns, and [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] Anthony Sherman's three&nbsp;yards on one&nbsp;attempt; in total Connecticut ran for 358&nbsp;yards. The Huskies attempted to pass only six times during the game; Lorenzen completed four of them for 49&nbsp;yards and a touchdown. Four different UConn receivers caught one pass each: wide receiver Kashif Moore (18&nbsp;yards), cornerback and sometime wide receiver Darius Butler (16&nbsp;yards), fullback Anthony Sherman (11&nbsp;yards), and tight end Steve Brouse (4&nbsp;yards and a touchdown).<ref name="ESPNBoxScore" />

Buffalo's offensive performance was in some ways the opposite of Connecticut's: while UConn dominated on the ground and barely passed the ball, Buffalo struggled with the run but had a good day passing. The Bulls ran for a total of 24&nbsp;yards on the game; James Starks accounted for 25&nbsp;yards on thirteen&nbsp;carries and scored a touchdown, while RB Brandon Termilus ran three&nbsp;times for five&nbsp;yards. Their total was partially offset by Drew Willy, who lost six&nbsp;yards on three rushing attempts. Willy had a much more successful day passing, completing 29 out of 43&nbsp;passes for 213&nbsp;yards and one&nbsp;interception. Namaan Roosevelt led the Buffalo receivers with 90&nbsp;yards on eight&nbsp;catches; of the five other Bulls who received passes, WR Brett Hamlin caught four&nbsp;passes for 54&nbsp;yards, TE Jesse Rack caught three for 22&nbsp;yards, RB Starks caught 11 for 21&nbsp;yards, WR Ernest Jackson caught two for 17&nbsp;yards, and WR Gary Rice caught one for 9&nbsp;yards.<ref name="ESPNBoxScore" />

Connecticut dominated Buffalo statistically in the first half, gaining 225&nbsp;yards to the Bulls' 94,<ref name="UConnFBMediaGuideP140" /> led by Donald Brown's 208&nbsp;yards&nbsp;rushing.<ref name="ESPNDonaldBrown1stHalf" /> Buffalo won the turnover battle however, recovering five UConn fumbles. The Bulls scored 20&nbsp;points off UConn turnovers in the first half, but were held scoreless in the second half when the Huskies stopped turning the ball over.<ref name="ESPNBoxScore" />

==Aftermath==
Connecticut's win gave the team a final record of 8<U+2013>5 and back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 2003<U+2013>04.<ref name="CourantUConnTimeline" /> Buffalo's final record fell to 8<U+2013>6, which still marked the first winning season for the Bulls since transitioning to Division I-A football in 1999.

In a press conference after the game, Brown announced that he would not return for his senior season and enter the NFL Draft, saying he told the media he said he was staying to take the focus off of himself prior to the game.<ref name="ESPNrecap" /> Brown was drafted 27th overall by the [[Indianapolis Colts]], becoming the first UConn player ever drafted in the first round. Three other UConn players were drafted in the second round: Darius Butler 41st overall by the [[New England Patriots]], William Beatty 60th overall by the [[New York Giants]], and [[defensive end]] [[Cody Brown]] 63rd overall by the [[Arizona Cardinals]].<ref name="NorwichBulletinNFLDraft" /> Tight end Martin B<U+00E9>dard was drafted 15th overall in the second round of the [[Canadian Football League]]'s (CFL) [[2009 CFL Draft|2009 Draft]].<ref name="2009CFLDraft" /> Buffalo did not have any players drafted by either league in 2009;<ref name="2009CFLDraft" /><ref name="NFLDraft2009Buffalo" /> in the [[2010 NFL Draft]] James Starks was selected in the sixth round, 193rd overall, by the [[Green Bay Packers]].<ref name="NFLDraft2010Buffalo" /> UConn cornerback [[Robert McClain]] was also drafted by the NFL in 2010, in the seventh round, 249th overall, by the [[Carolina Panthers]].<ref name="NFLDraft2010UConn" /><ref name="MarcusEasleyNote" group="Note"/>

In the offseason Connecticut hired [[Joe Moorhead]] as their new offensive coordinator, replacing the departed [[Rob Ambrose]].<ref name="NorwichBulletinJoeMoorhead" /> Turner Gill returned to coach Buffalo in [[2009 Buffalo Bulls football team|2009]]. Following that season, however, he left to take over the football program at the [[Kansas Jayhawks football|University of Kansas]].<ref name="ESPNTurnerGillKansas" />

Connecticut and Buffalo resumed their rivalry on September 25, [[2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2010]], playing a regular season game  at UConn's [[Rentschler Field (stadium)|Rentschler Field]].<ref name="CourantUConn2010Schedule" />  Although the score was tied 14&ndash;14 at halftime, the Huskies pulled away in the second half after changing quarterbacks, winning the rematch 45&ndash;21.<ref name="ESPN2010UConnvsBuffaloRecap" />
