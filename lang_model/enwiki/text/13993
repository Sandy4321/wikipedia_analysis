'''''WCW Thunder''''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[television program|show]] produced by [[World Championship Wrestling]] which aired on [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] from January 8, 1998 to March 21, 2001. The rights to ''WCW Thunder'' now belong to [[WWE]].

==History==
===Creation===
The success of World Championship Wrestling's primary show, ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]], led [[Ted Turner]] to create a new show, which would eventually be named ''Thunder'', that would air Thursdays on [[TBS (TV channel)|TBS]].<ref name="CCC255256">{{cite book|title=Controversy Creates Cash|last=Bischoff|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Bischoff|pages=255<U+2013>256|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4165-2729-9}}</ref>

WCW Executive Vice-President [[Eric Bischoff]] was originally reluctant to produce another two-hour weekly television show for a variety of reasons. First, [[Time Warner]] (WCW's parent company) was under a hiring freeze<ref name="CCC255">{{cite book|title=Controversy Creates Cash|last=Bischoff|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Bischoff|page=255|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4165-2729-9}}</ref> which prevented Bischoff from bringing in additional production people to run the show. Second, he felt WCW did not have enough talent to produce another show and risked overexposing them and making storylines less significant.<ref name="CCC257">{{cite book|title=Controversy Creates Cash|last=Bischoff|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Bischoff|page=257|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4165-2729-9}}</ref> Third, according to Bischoff, TBS refused to pay the cost of producing ''Thunder'' which was between [[United States dollar|$]]12 million and $15 million a year.<ref name="CCC257"/>

Bischoff eventually decided that he could make the new show work and help pay for it by expanding revenue from increased [[house show]] business.<ref name="CCC258">{{cite book|title=Controversy Creates Cash|last=Bischoff|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Bischoff|page=258|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4165-2729-9}}</ref> Bischoff was also given permission to sign [[Bret Hart]], specifically as a high-profile talent to perform on ''Thunder''.<ref name="CCC261">{{cite book|title=Controversy Creates Cash|last=Bischoff|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Bischoff|page=261|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4165-2729-9}}</ref><ref name="CCC271">{{cite book|title=Controversy Creates Cash|last=Bischoff|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Bischoff|page=271|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4165-2729-9}}</ref>

The first match to take place on ''Thunder'' featured former [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] star [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]] against [[Randy Savage]].  Adams pinned Savage after a chairshot from [[Lex Luger]]. The match decision was reversed by [[James J. Dillon]].

===Advertisements===
TV commercials for ''Thunder'' featured top ring talents such as [[Hulk Hogan]] saying ''"I'll show you some thunder, brotha!"'' and [[Paul Wight|The Giant]] with ''"This forecast definitely calls for pain!"'' However, neither Hogan nor Giant would frequently appear on what was considered by fans to be a second rate show. Furthermore, unlike TNT's ''Monday Nitro'', TBS often featured commercials briefing the events of the latest edition of ''Thunder'' during its other programs.

===2000-2001===
''Thunder'' switched from Thursday evenings to Wednesday evenings on January 12, 2000.  Since ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|WWF SmackDown!]]'' debuted on [[UPN]] in the same timeslot as ''Thunder'', WCW had been trailing the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] on Thursdays as well as on Mondays, as this was during the time WCW's ratings began their steady decline that would eventually lead to the company's demise. (The WWF also had a slight advantage as ''SmackDown!'' was available over broadcast signals and cable was not required to view the program). Little was gained by the move, however.

On October 9, 2000, WCW moved the ''Thunder'' tapings to Mondays. From then on until March 19, 2001 (with the exception of the January 3, 2001 show), WCW aired its live ''Nitro'' broadcast at the beginning of the night and began the ''Thunder'' taping following the ''Nitro'' show.

===Commentators===
At the beginning, ''Thunder'' was broadcast by [[Tony Schiavone]], [[Bobby Heenan]] and [[Lee Marshall (announcer)|Lee Marshall]]. In Fall 1998, [[Mike Tenay]] from ''Nitro'' replaced Lee Marshall. During the April 1, 1999 broadcast of ''Thunder'', Schiavone and Tenay had a [[Work (professional wrestling)|worked]] argument, and starting with the following week, Tenay was moved to play-by-play, with [[Larry Zbyszko]] replacing Bobby Heenan on color commentary. In December 1999, [[Scott Hudson (announcer)|Scott Hudson]] replaced Zbyszko and Schiavone returned as the second color man, the role that Tenay had in previous years. [[Lane Huffman|Stevie Ray]], late of [[Harlem Heat]] also briefly did color commentary on ''Thunder''.

==Color scheme==
''Thunder'' utilized a primarily blue color scheme for its production graphics and ring designs, a design which was later emulated by ''SmackDown!'', as compared to the primarily red designs of the Monday night shows, ''Raw'' and ''Nitro''.
