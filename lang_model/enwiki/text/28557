The '''60th Boat Race''' took place on 1 April 1903.  Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  The race was umpired for the first time by former Cambridge rower [[Frederick I. Pitman]], whose misfiring starter pistol caused confusion at the start, allowing Cambridge to gain an advantage.  They went on to win by six lengths in a time of 19 minutes 33 seconds.  The victory took the overall record to 33&ndash;26 in Oxford's favour.

==Background==
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 20 August 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 20 June 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/the-course | title = The Course| accessdate = 24 July 2014 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited}}</ref>  The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities;  it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and as of 2014, broadcast worldwide.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|title=Former Winnipegger in winning Oxford&ndash;Cambridge Boat Race crew|date=6 April 2014|publisher=[[CBC News]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/former-winnipegger-in-winning-oxford-cambridge-boat-race-crew-1.2600176|accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref>  Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1902|1902 race]] by five lengths,<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 20 August 2014}}</ref> and led overall with 33 victories to Cambridge's 25 (excluding the [[The Boat Race 1877|"dead heat" of 1877]]).<ref>{{Cite web | url= http://theboatraces.org/classic-moments-the-1877-dead-heat | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Classic moments <U+2013> the 1877 dead heat | accessdate =20 August 2014}}</ref>

Oxford's coaches were G. C. Bourne who had rowed for the university in the [[The Boat Race 1882|1882]] and [[The Boat Race 1883|1883 races]] and C. K. Philips who had represented the Dark Blues four times between 1895 and 1898.  Cambridge were coached by Charles John Bristowe who had represented the Light Blues in the [[The Boat Race 1886|1886]] and [[The Boat Race 1887|1887 races]] and [[Claude Goldie]] who had rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1898|1898]] and [[The Boat Race 1899|1899 races]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>  The Light Blues were later coached by [[William Dudley Ward]].<ref name=drink113/>  The umpire for the first time was old [[Eton College|Etonian]] and former Cambridge rower [[Frederick I. Pitman]] who rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1884|1884]], [[The Boat Race 1885|1885]] and 1886 races.<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 108</ref>

During the build-up to the race, Oxford suffered a series of misfortunes, including a bout of [[influenza]] which caused several changes in the Dark Blue crew.  Centred on the group of Blues returning from the previous year, Cambridge were able to produce "a very fast crew".<ref name=drink112>Drinkwater, p. 112</ref>

==Crews==

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Oxford won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge.  On a strong tide, umpire Pitman attempted to start the race at 3:35&nbsp;p.m.  After he shouted "Are you ready?", Cambridge [[Glossary of rowing terms#The stroke|squared]] their [[Blade (rowing)|blades]] and were dragged away from their stakeboat, and rowed on despite Pitman failing to correctly discharge the starter pistol.  Worse, he failed to notice the departing Light Blues who were already one third of a length ahead before Oxford got on their way.  Somewhat dismayed by the disadvantageous start, author and the number seven for this year's race George Drinkwater stated they "rowed like a beaten crew from the first stroke."<ref name=drink113>Drinkwater, p. 113</ref>  

With a lead of nearly three lengths by [[Hammersmith Bridge]], Cambridge pushed on to hold a four-and-a-half length lead at [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]], and passed the finishing post six lengths ahead, in a time of 19 minutes 33 seconds.<ref name=drink113/>  It was their second consecutive win and their fourth in five years, and took the overall record in the event to 33&ndash;26 in Oxford's favour.<ref name=results/>
