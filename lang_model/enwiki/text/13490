'''''The Secret Service''''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Children's television series|children's]] [[Spy-fi|espionage]] television series, made as a [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21]] production for [[ITC Entertainment]] and broadcast in 1969. Created by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]], with [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]] and [[Reg Hill]] as producers, it succeeded earlier Century 21 productions such as ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' and, in a manner similar to its predecessors, presented characters as [[marionette]] puppets in a filming technique dubbed "[[Supermarionation]]". The eighth and final Supermarionation series, ''The Secret Service'' incorporated footage of [[Live action|live actors]] for distance shots at the behest of Anderson, who wished to compensate for the inadequacies of the Supermarionation format (such as the difficulties of inducing effective movement in the puppet characters) and increase its realism. ''The Secret Service'' remained Anderson's last puppet series until the 1980s, when he produced ''[[Terrahawks]]'' using the "[[Supermarionation#Supermacromation|Supermacromation]]" technique.

Episodes depict the adventures of Father Stanley Unwin, a character whose likeness Anderson based on the real-life [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|comedian of the same name]], who also [[Self-referential humor|provided the puppet voice]]. The parish priest of a rural English village, Unwin also works undercover as a [[secret agent]] for BISHOP, a covert branch of [[British Intelligence]] that combats international criminal and terrorist threats. With junior operative Matthew Harding as his assistant, the Father answers to his superior in London <U+2013> codenamed "The Bishop" <U+2013> as he would in his clerical profession. When faced with the challenge of infiltrating hostile situations to gather intelligence, Unwin and Matthew deploy the "Minimiser", a gadget that [[Resizing (fiction)|shrink]]s Matthew to a fraction of his normal size for the purposes of conducting secret reconnaissance. Meanwhile, Unwin's nonsensical [[gobbledegook]] is used to perplex opponents.

Filming commenced at the Century 21 Studios in [[Slough]], and [[Filming location|on location]] in England, in August 1968. However, [[Lew Grade]], Anderson's financial backer, [[Cancellation (television)|cancelled]] production on ''The Secret Service'' in December 1968 during a [[preview screening]] of the pilot, declaring that the "Unwinese" dialogue would preclude successful distribution in the [[Television in the United States|United States]]. Filming ended in January 1969 upon completion of the thirteenth episode, and the series aired in three broadcasting regions of the United Kingdom from September. Critical reception to ''The Secret Service'' has been mixed: verdicts range from the "forgotten gem" to the "one [[Box office bomb|flop]]" of the Anderson series. Commentators have questioned Anderson's decision to hire Unwin, arguing that the humour that the Unwinese generates is too weak to sustain interest, although the scripting of the supporting characters has been praised.

==Plot==
''The Secret Service'' follows the adventures of Father Stanley Unwin, the parish priest of a rural English village. Affecting the appearance of an eccentric middle-aged cleric, Unwin moonlights as a [[secret agent]] for BISHOP, a top-secret arm of [[British Intelligence]] (in full, '''B'''ritish '''I'''ntelligence '''S'''ervice '''H'''eadquarters, '''O'''peration '''P'''riest) based in [[Whitehall]]. Answering to his superior, codenamed "The Bishop", Unwin resides at his [[vicarage]] with Matthew Harding <U+2013> another agent who, when not assisting the Father on his missions, adopts the manner of a simple gardener. Supporting characters include Blake, a junior BISHOP operative, and Mrs Appleby, Unwin's ageing housekeeper, who is unaware of Unwin and Harding's involvement with British Intelligence.

Prior to the events depicted in ''The Secret Service'', pioneering scientist Professor Humbolt perfected the Minimiser, a device capable of [[Resizing (fiction)|shrinking]] people or objects to one third of their original size. Following Humbolt's death, it passed into the possession of Father Unwin, who conceals his deceased parishioner's parting gift inside a large Bible. The regular target of the Minimiser is Harding, whom Unwin reduces to a height of two feet (0.6&nbsp;m) so that he can infiltrate situations to which no full-size person could gain discreet access. In this manner, the puppet interacts with life-size sets and live actors whose faces are excluded from the shot. The Minimiser is also used to shrink enemy agents, bringing them down to Harding's size.

When miniaturised, Harding is transported in Unwin's adapted [[briefcase]], which is fitted with equipment such as a [[periscope]], stores other gadgets as required, and can open from the inside. Unwin's [[hearing aid]] is in fact a transmitter that allows covert communication with Harding, who wears a corresponding unit. The Father's preferred means of transport is ''Gabriel'', a repainted and revamped 1917-issue [[Ford Model T]] that can travel at speeds in excess of 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h). If enemies, police or other authorities challenge Unwin, the Father spouts a form of nonsensical [[gobbledegook]] as a smokescreen to confuse the opposition and cover for Matthew.

''The Secret Service'' represents a departure from most earlier [[Supermarionation]] television series on account of its contemporary setting: the time depicted is the late 1960s.<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 151">Bentley: ''Episode Guide'', 151.</ref><ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 142"/><ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 115">Bentley: ''Captain Scarlet'', 115.</ref><ref name="Archer, 85">Archer, 85.</ref> ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'', produced from 1960, is set between 1960 and 1962.<ref name="Archer, 85"/> The events of the episodes "Errand of Mercy" and "The Deadly Whisper" are set on 3 February and 24 May 1969, respectively.<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 154">Bentley: ''Episode Guide'', 154.</ref><ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 156">Bentley: ''Episode Guide'', 156.</ref> However, [[Gerry Anderson]] biographers Archer and Hearn argue that the setting is ambiguous: while it is first suggested to be "sometime in the near future", it is also remarked of the set-up that "[[Morris Minor]]s negotiate leafy country roads while space-age helijets patrol the skies."<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 183"/> It is concluded that the production is so fantastic that it "isn't set in the real world at all."<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 183"/>

{{Quote box|quote=I thought it would be a great idea if I cast [Unwin] in the role of a [[secret agent]]; he played the part of a priest and he had his own church, hence the title <U+2013> the double meaning <U+2013> ''The Secret Service''. If he ever got into a difficult spot, say the police had stopped him, he would talk to them in his Unwinese and that would fox the police totally. They'd have to be polite <U+2013> "I'm sorry, I didn't quite get that," because they're writing it down. He says, "I'll repeat that," then he repeats the whole lot and, of course, the guy is saying, "I didn't understand that." Eventually, the police would say, "Yes, yes, I quite understand, sir. Sorry to trouble you, off you go." So that was the [[gimmick]].|source=[[Gerry Anderson]] (2009)<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 190"/>|align=right|width=17.5%}}

With the completion of ''[[Joe 90]]'', which commenced transmission on [[Associated Television|ATV]] in September 1968, [[Gerry Anderson]] decided to produce another espionage television series.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 180">Archer and Hearn, 180.</ref> This would incorporate the [[plot device]] of a rural English village as the base of operations for the star [[secret agent]], the local parish priest.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 180"/> Anderson selected [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|Stanley Unwin]] to voice the lead character, which would be named after him, after encountering the comedian at [[Pinewood Studios]] as he completed dubbing work for the 1968 film ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]''.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 189">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 189.</ref>

In the 1940s and 50s, Unwin had developed "Unwinese", a [[nonsense]] language that distorted words and phrases into a form of [[gibberish]] that sounded unintelligible but which in fact retained some fragments of meaning.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 189"/> Recalling Unwin's radio and television performances, Anderson thought that the self-made language would suit the character of an eccentric undercover operative, and could produce humour if demonstrated to have a confusing effect on enemies.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 180"/> He elaborated, "As far as I was concerned, Stanley came first and then the idea had to accommodate him. It wasn't that the story called for someone who could speak [[gobbledegook]], it was a question of how we could fit him into the storyline."<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 180"/> 

Due to the strange nature of the language, the [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21]] writers would brief Unwin on episode plots and then leave space in their scripts for the actor to draft all the Unwinese dialogue himself.<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 151"/><ref name="StanleyUnwinInterview1">{{cite web|url=http://www.stanleyunwin.com/work_tv_secret_2.htm|title=The Seekry Servy: A Bit of a Chat|work=''stanleyunwin.com''|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5sYDQ5VFs|archivedate=6 September 2010|accessdate=26 September 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Shane Rimmer]], who scripted the episode "Hole in One", remarked that "A lot of [the Unwinese] you had to leave to [Unwin]. You gave him a line of patter that's going to work with what he does. Because ''he'' was such a bizarre character, you felt you could really go all the way with him: you could practically do anything."<ref name="StanleyUnwinInterview1"/>

The premise of ''The Secret Service'' drew part of its inspiration from the ''Joe 90'' episode "[[The Unorthodox Shepherd]]",<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 180"/> which features the character of an aged, deaf vicar who covers up a money counterfeiting operation on his church grounds. Archer and Hearn comment on the wider influence of ''Joe 90'' on its successor series, stating that ''The Secret Service'' "continues the espionage theme of ''Joe 90'' in a range of adventures that depict a Britain under siege from despicable foreign agents intent on stealing its secrets."<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 183"/>

===Puppets===
Following ''Joe 90'', Anderson had originally intended to discontinue the use of [[Supermarionation]] puppets altogether.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 180"/> However, due to the higher prospective production costs of filming a new series completely in live action, he decided to compromise between the advantages of both options and mix the two formats.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 180"/> On the nature of the puppets, which had incorporated natural human anatomical proportions since ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'', Anderson stated that a progression in sculpting techniques had resulted in "imitations of human beings" that rendered his series "like live-action shows but with unconvincing actors".<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 180"/>

Recording live actors for [[long shot]]s solved a problem that all previous Supermarionation productions had entailed: that of inducing realistic movement from puppet characters.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 180"/> Century 21 had experimented with filming special effects in live settings for its 1968 film, ''[[Thunderbird 6]]''.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 190">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 190.</ref> "The Unorthodox Shepherd" had incorporated similar filming techniques: a church at [[Harefield]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] had doubled as the principal setting, the villain represented on location footage by a full-size mannequin based on a Supermarionation puppet.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 190"/> La Rivi<U+00E8>re notes the contrast between the mixing of formats for ''The Secret Service'' and the procedure adopted for earlier Supermarionation series, which had only used live-action shots for situations such as the operation of machines (for which a brief shot of a living hand would often be inserted).<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 193">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 193.</ref>

New puppets created for ''The Secret Service'' were limited to the characters of Father Unwin (which sculptor Mary Turner based on the likeness of Stanley Unwin), his ageing housekeeper Mrs Appleby (which [[Christine Glanville]] based on the appearance of her mother) and The Bishop.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 192">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 192.</ref> Other characters were portrayed by "revamp puppets" that appeared in the earlier Anderson series ''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'' and ''Joe 90''. For example, the Harding puppet made its first appearance in the ''Captain Scarlet'' episode "[[Treble Cross]]",<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 151"/> while the [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] marionette itself starred as Blake.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 182">Archer and Hearn, 182.</ref> La Rivi<U+00E8>re refers to the Unwin puppet in particular as "one of the most impressive artistic feats" produced at the Century 21 puppet workshop, describing the accuracy of the likeness as "uncanny".<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 192"/>

===Voice cast===
With the exception of Unwin, all voice actors cast for ''The Secret Service'' had contributed to earlier [[Supermarionation]] series. ''The Secret Service'' starred:

*[[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|Stanley Unwin]] as '''Father Stanley Unwin''' (aged 57),<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 151"/> a parish priest based in rural England who carries out top-secret missions for BISHOP ('''B'''ritish '''I'''ntelligence '''S'''ervice '''H'''eadquarters, '''O'''peration '''P'''riest). Due to the realism of the costume that he wore for live-action location filming, members of the public would often confuse Unwin for a real vicar during production on ''The Secret Service''.<ref name="StanleyUnwinInterview2">{{cite web|url=http://www.stanleyunwin.com/work_tv_secret_3.htm|title=The Seekry Servy: Stanley on ''The Secret Service''|work=''stanleyunwin.com''|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5sYDRdgKl|archivedate=6 September 2010|accessdate=26 September 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> While driving home from one shooting session in costume, he once found himself "held up because the driver in front had stalled his caravan. Seeing my clerical garb he said: 'So sorry, Father. I'm in trouble.'"<ref name="StanleyUnwinInterview2"/>
*[[Gary Files]] as '''Matthew Harding''' (aged 28),<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 151"/> a BISHOP agent paired with Unwin, who serves as his accomplice on assignment and as gardener of the vicarage in public life. Files retained fond memories of his time on ''The Secret Service'', stating that he enjoyed voicing the character of Harding more than the character of [[Captain Magenta]] on ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]''.<ref name="TheVervoid">{{cite web|url=http://www.thevervoid.com/media/scarlet_interview.htm |title=Gary Files Interview|work=''thevervoid.com''|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080626072515/http://www.thevervoid.com/media/scarlet_interview.htm|archivedate=26 June 2008|accessdate=26 September 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> He made significant contributions to Harding's characterisation, conceiving the rural accent of Unwin's assistant himself: "It just seemed so right for the character. Then once I had the voice, the rest of Matthew followed."<ref name="TheVervoid"/>
*[[Sylvia Anderson]] as '''Mrs Appleby''' (aged 55),<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 151"/> the housekeeper of Unwin's vicarage, who remains ignorant of Unwin and Harding's secret double life.
*[[Jeremy Wilkin]] as '''The Bishop''' (aged 52),<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 151"/> a high-ranking figure in [[British Intelligence]], director of BISHOP and superior to Unwin, based in [[Whitehall]].
*[[Keith Alexander (actor)|Keith Alexander]] as '''Blake''', a cautious junior agent of BISHOP, who has speaking roles in three episodes ("A Question of Miracles", "Last Train to Bufflers Halt" and "The Cure").

Supporting character voices were provided by all the regular cast (with the exception of Unwin) in addition to [[David Healy (actor)|David Healy]] and (for the final episode, "More Haste Less Speed") [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]].

===Filming===
{{Quote box|quote=I came up with the idea of getting [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|Stanley Unwin]] to do all the walking shots, and driving shots in his [[Model T Ford]] that he had. If, for example, you had a sequence where Stanley Unwin would arrive at a building in his Model T, he would drive it down the street, up to the kerb, turn the engine off, get out, walk down the path, and as he opened the door, you'd cut to the reverse angle and that would be the ''puppet'' of Stanley Unwin.|source=[[Gerry Anderson]] (2009)<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 190"/>|align=right|width=17.5%}}

Filming commenced on 20 August 1968<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 151"/> after a summer of [[pre-production]].<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 180"/> Director [[Ken Turner (director)|Ken Turner]], who headed the location unit, recalled that ''The Secret Service'' became a complex series to shoot because it incorporated three design elements (studio puppet filming, studio special effects filming and live-action location filming).<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 182"/> In a reversal to the practice used on earlier Supermarionation productions, location filming needed to be completed first before work could start at the [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21]] Studios. Turner elaborated, "We felt that somebody had to take the location stuff by the balls, get it shot and then hand it over to the director to fit his puppet stuff in. I suppose that seemed a bit back to front but with that programme it was what worked out best."<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 182"/>

On the complications that emerged from filming, producer [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]] remembered his experience on the series as "an absolute nightmare" due to the various scales used: "You can imagine the problems. You're shrinking [the Matthew Harding puppet] to puppet size on a puppet set and then you're having to build it in live-action size for the puppet because he's supposed to be a small man in a full-sized environment. And then you're using the 'shrunken' puppet in a full set."<ref name="Peel, 25">Peel, 25.</ref>

Locations used in filming included a manor house at [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], which doubled as Unwin's residence.<ref name="AndersonicLocations">{{cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Richard|title=Secret Servibold Locateymost|journal=Andersonic|url=http://www.andersonic.co.uk/page20.htm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5sYDKumLj|archivedate=6 September 2010|accessdate=26 September 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Centre Point]], a tower building located on [[Oxford Street]] in London, appeared as [[British Intelligence]] Headquarters, while [[Horse Guards Parade]] in [[Whitehall]] represented the base of BISHOP.<ref name="AndersonicLocations"/> The hospital at which Unwin visits Brother Gregory in the episode "School for Spies" was in fact [[Wexham Park Hospital]] in Slough.<ref name="AndersonicLocations"/> The exterior of Century 21 Studios themselves, located on the [[Slough Trading Estate]], appeared as the Healey Automation plant in the pilot episode, "A Case for the Bishop".<ref name="AndersonicLocations"/>

Due to the 1960s setting of ''The Secret Service'', [[Derek Meddings]] and the technicians of the special effects department received few commissions for [[scale model]]s of vehicles that appeared futuristic.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 192"/> This left Unwin's vintage [[Ford Model T]], ''Gabriel'', as their main project, in addition to rendering vehicles and settings common to the decade in miniature and producing the optical enlargement and miniaturisation effects for the character of Harding.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 192"/> Wag Evans manufactured a full-size and two miniature versions (the last of differing scales) of ''Gabriel'', fitting the larger car with belt-driven electric motors, a folding roof, upholstered interior, and a remote control mechanism.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 183"/>

Evans remembered that the location filming involving ''Gabriel'', conducted in and around [[Burnham Beeches]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] in the autumn of 1968,<ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 142">Archer and Nicholls, 142.</ref> proved to be arduous due to the low levels of light.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 183">Archer and Hearn, 183.</ref> On occasion, just two minutes of new footage would be recorded at each session.<ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 142"/> On the subject of the remote-control steering, he stated, "I remember standing out of shot and having to 'drive' [''Gabriel''] down the road while it was out of view.

Further to the titles, Gray recorded [[incidental music]] for individual episodes in three additional four-hour sessions.<ref name="TVCentury21Music"/> For the first, held at the [[Olympic Studios]] in London on 12 November 1968, an orchestra of 29 musicians played tracks to feature in the pilot episode, "A Case for the Bishop".<ref name="TVCentury21Music"/> Recording for "A Question of Miracles" ran on 11 December, at Gray's private studios and with eight musicians.<ref name="TVCentury21Music"/> The final session wrapped up the soundtrack on 10 January 1969.<ref name="TVCentury21Music"/> Due to the cancellation of ''The Secret Service'', the soundtrack has received no commercial releases,<ref name="Peel, 30"/> although since 2007 it has been available on CD exclusively for members of [[Fanderson]], the official Gerry Anderson fan organisation.<ref name="SupermarionationIsGoMusic">{{cite web|url=http://lester.demon.nl/superm/gray-disco.html|title=Barry Gray Discography|first=Theo|last=de Klerk|year=2008|work=''lester.demon.nl''|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5t2Txlwlo|archivedate=26 September 2010|accessdate=26 September 2010}}</ref>

===Cancellation===
{{Quote box|quote="Cut! Cut! Cut! Stop! Put the lights up! cried out [[Lew Grade]], leaping to his feet. [[Gerry Anderson]] was startled by this outburst, just as he had been by Lew's reaction to ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' four years before. However, this time Lew's response was vastly different, as Gerry explains: "'Cancel the show, Gerry. Just finish off the first thirteen.' I said, 'Why?' and he said, 'They'll never understand [Father Unwin] in America!' I said, 'But, Lew, that's the whole point, they're not ''supposed'' to understand.'

[[Lew Grade]], the [[ITC Entertainment]] financier, ordered Anderson to cancel production on ''The Secret Service'' during a [[test screening]] of the pilot episode, "A Case for the Bishop", in December 1968.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 183"/> Objecting to the concept on the grounds that audiences in the United States would be confused by the Unwinese, Grade capped the production at the thirteen episodes that either had been completed or were in production at the time of the screening.<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 151"/> Anderson countered that a nonsense language such as Unwinese is inherently incomprehensible, and questioned Grade's reasoning for the cancellation, responding that "I chose Stanley Unwin because you are not supposed to understand Stanley Unwin, even if you're British. I thought if the Americans don't understand him either, what's the difference?"<ref name="StanleyUnwinInterview1"/>

However, Anderson conceded that Grade "was not a man you could argue with. If he said "No", you had to accept that he wouldn't change his mind."<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 184">Archer and Hearn, 184.</ref> Of Grade's decision, La Rivi<U+00E8>re conjectures, "No one knows what was running through [his] mind ... but given the ease with which the 'Unwinese' element could have been removed the series, it seems probable that he simply didn't like a lot of what he was seeing."<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 194">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 194.</ref> In a move that would lead to the discontinuation of the Supermarionation format, Anderson and Grade coordinated to transfer most of the production staff from the [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21]] base at the [[Slough Trading Estate]] in [[Berkshire]] to [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] for the commencement of filming on ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'', the Andersons' first full live-action series.

Having wanted to abandon puppet work and move into live-action, Anderson greeted the cancellation of ''The Secret Service'' with optimism, remarking of live actors, "I started to think: 'It's amazing! They speak! Their mouths are in synch with their words! And they can walk! And they can pick up things!'"<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 195"/> After the Century 21 Studios closed down on 24 January 1969<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 151"/> on completion of the final episode of ''The Secret Service'', "More Haste Less Speed", the special effects department expanded its workshops into the disused rooms in anticipation of new projects for ''UFO''.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 181"/><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 196">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 196.</ref>

{{Quote box|quote=The puppets and special effects had always worked well together because they existed in the same artificial universe ... By contrast, no such forgiveness is extended when you see a puppet in a car, then cut to a human getting out of the vehicle and walking across the road.

Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn note a sharp divergence from earlier Supermarionation productions that stems from ''The Secret Service'' being less "American-orientated" and containing fewer action sequences.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 180"/> The series is referred to as the "most eccentric" of all Anderson's series up to 1969, and the fusion of puppets and live actors the "natural conclusion" to the Supermarionation technique.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 180"/> The writers bestow particular praise on the characterisation of the supporting character of Mrs Appleby, whose ignorance of Unwin and Harding's commitments to British Intelligence leads to moments of humour: for example, when Father Unwin speaks into his communications device disguised as a [[hearing aid]], the housekeeper deduces that the apparently senile vicar is muttering to himself.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 182"/> The episodes "A Question of Miracles", in which the miniaturised Matthew is dwarfed by articles of food and drink from a picnic basket, and "Last Train to Bufflers Halt", with its plot about an unstoppable train, are also lauded.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 183"/> Stephen La Rivi<U+00E8>re, author of ''Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future'', favours "More Haste Less Speed": describing the series finale as "wonderfully quirky" and "glorious", he views the plot concerning counterfeiting as reminiscent of the "gentler, earlier days of ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]''", also praising [[Keith Alexander (actor)|Keith Alexander]] for his impression of an aged woman while voicing the character of Lady Hazlewell.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 195"/>

However, evaluating ''The Secret Service'' as a whole, La Rivi<U+00E8>re suggests that the premise of a secret agent masquerading as a priest while driving an antiquated car did not appeal to child viewers, and that older audiences did not see the "traditional espionage format" as original.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 195">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 195.</ref> For La Rivi<U+00E8>re, the blending of puppetry and live action "simply doesn't work. It requires more than the audience can give in terms of acceptance."<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 193"/> In the case of "More Haste Less Speed", he notes that the character of Lady Hazlewell is portrayed in live-action distance shots by a stunt actor dressed in [[Drag queen|drag]] <U+2013> an "unintentionally hilarious moment that illustrates beautifully why the live-action inserts didn't work."<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 193"/> He further argues that the contrasting light levels of shots alternating between one format and the other shatter the illusion of "artificiality" that previous series had been able to produce due to the absence of live action.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 193"/>

{{Quote box|quote=The [[cleric]]al vocation of the main character also introduces the issue of faith <U+2013> the series doesn't so much preach any religion as such but rather demonstrates people putting faith in each other. In trusting the eccentric Unwin (blind faith as it happens, as [Unwin] appears to be talking utter nonsense), Professor Graham helps to avert the disaster. Unwin circumspectly passes it off as "a miracle of ''science''", avoiding any awkward questions. In several other episodes it's interesting that he implies that his successes (achieved using the ''science'' of the Minimiser) are down to ''divine'' intervention.|source=Paul O'Brien on "Recall to Service"<ref name="AndersonicReview"/>|width=22.5%|align=right}}

La Rivi<U+00E8>re cites external influences that, in his mind, did not work in favour of ''The Secret Service'', including the sustained viewer interest in previous Supermarionation productions as far back as ''[[The Adventures of Twizzle]]'' (1959) and the frequent repeat runs that such series received on [[Associated Television|ATV]] throughout the 1960s: "... as with anything that is [[Fad|phenomenally popular]], the time must come when the audience is satiated and drifts away to something else."<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 195"/> On the other hand, it is argued that, in light of the release of the 1969 film ''[[Doppelg<U+00E4>nger (1969 film)|Doppelg<U+00E4>nger]]'', a live-action production preceding the television series ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'', the Supermarionation format had become outdated.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 195"/> Archer and Hearn express similar concerns on the falling demand for new Supermarionation series in 1969, stating that Anderson and his team has become "a bit too successful" in producing a winning format.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 184"/>

Science-fiction author [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]], in his episode guide to the Supermarionation productions, labels ''The Secret Service'' "dismal", deeming the mix of puppetry and live action "completely pointless" and Stanley Unwin's recruitment not just "bizarre in the extreme" but also ill-considered, since his Unwinese "was hardly funny to most people (let alone children)."<ref name="Peel, 247">Peel, 247.</ref> Addressing [[Lew Grade]]'s concern that an American audience would be left baffled by Unwin's mannerisms, Peel argues that the character was equally incomprehensible to British viewers.<ref name="Peel, 247"/> As with La Rivi<U+00E8>re, he perceives a lack of inspiration in the core premise, and also refers to the Minimiser as the "single [[gimmick]]" of the series,<ref name="Peel, 247"/> which as a whole "marked the death knell of Supermarionation."<ref name="Peel, 248">Peel, 248.</ref> It is Peel's opinion that each Supermarionation series following ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' "had made one mistake after another", so that "From the heights of ''Thunderbirds'', the Anderson team had slipped to the depths with ''The Secret Service''.<ref name="Peel, 248"/>

{{Quote box|quote=Of course, the burning question is, does it work? <U+2013> And one has to answer with an uncomfortable "yes". It does work.

Supermarionation historians Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett suggest that "On paper, at least, the premise seemed irresistible",<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 292">Drake and Bassett, 292.</ref> yet describe the combination of puppetry and live action as "uneasy".<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 291">Drake and Bassett, 291.</ref> Prior to his death in 2002, Unwin himself praised the off-beat nature of ''The Secret Service'', defending the inclusion of such elements as the Unwinese as "an attempt to add a new dimension to the puppet field ...

In an episode review published in the ''Andersonic'' [[fanzine]], Paul O'Brien suggests that the AquaTank plot of "Recall to Service" is "an obvious [[allegory]] about the hazards of complete [[automation]]", writing that the depiction of a military weapon gone rogue relates to instalments of earlier Supermarionation series such as ''Thunderbirds'' in terms of its [[subtext]], which warns of the dangers of over-reliance on technology.<ref name="AndersonicReview">{{cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Paul|title=Optical Deludey|journal=Andersonic|url=http://www.andersonic.co.uk/page23.htm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5t2TulsKY|archivedate=26 September 2010|accessdate=26 September 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> The crucial plot development of the episode occurs, according to O'Brien, "when Matthew switches the advancing AquaTank back to manual control <U+2013> in other words the machinery is now subordinate to its creator once again, as it should stay."<ref name="AndersonicReview"/> O'Brien directs criticism at the limitations of the puppet cast, arguing that the recurring absence of female characters leaves Father Unwin and Matthew members of an "all-male club".<ref name="AndersonicReview"/> On the subject of Mrs Appleby, he writes that the one regular character of the opposite sex "contributes precisely nil to the plot."<ref name="AndersonicReview"/>
