'''Kenneth C. Anderson''' (born March 6, 1976)<ref name="WebsiteFacts"/> is an [[United States of America|American]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and [[actor]] better known by his [[ring name]] '''Mr. Kennedy'''. He currently wrestles for the [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE).<ref name="WWEProfile"/>

Before being promoted to the main WWE roster, Anderson wrestled for numerous [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotions]] in his career. While situated in these promotions, he has won various championships, both in tag team and singles competition. Anderson was assigned to WWE's developmental territory [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW) in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] in 2005. 

After signing with WWE, Anderson made his debut on the SmackDown! roster in August 2005 and proceeded to play a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] in the program. In September 2006 he captured the [[WWE United States Championship]], making it his first title with the company. Anderson, however, [[List of professional wrestling terms#D|dropped]] the title the following month. The following year, at [[WrestleMania 23]], Anderson won the annual [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], a contract, which guarantees a match for any of WWE's three top titles. He, however, lost the right to challenge for a title against [[Adam Copeland|Edge]]. During the [[2007 WWE Draft]], Anderson was moved from SmackDown! to the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] brand, only to return back to the SmackDown roster the following year.

==Early life==
Anderson is the son of James Alan Holmes and Sheryl Anderson and has one sister, Jennifer Holmes. His father died on April 13, 2006 from cancer.<ref name="Family">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingwire.net/newswire/archive.php?Action=ShowNews&NewsID=12673|title=Obituary for James Alan Holmes|publisher=WrestlingWire (originally from ''Herald Times'' Reporter)|date=April 16, 2006|accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref>

Anderson is a graduate of Washington High School in [[Two Rivers, Wisconsin]]. During his time there, Anderson excelled at swimming and track & field.<ref name="SLAM!">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/kennedy_ken.html|title=Mr. Kennedy profile|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam!

Before starting a wrestling career, Anderson worked at a nuclear plant as a security officer and as a personal trainer.<ref name="SLAM!"/><ref name="MiamiHerald"/> He also served in the United States Army.<ref name="detnews">{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070322/ENT0101/703220388/1032/|last=Graham|first=Adam|title=WWE's Mr. Kennedy: From bad to evil greatness|work=[[The Detroit News]]|accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref>

==Professional wrestling career==
Anderson was trained by All-Star Championship Wrestling owners Eric Hammers and Mike Krause. He was invited to appear in a trial basis on ''[[WWF Jakked/Metal|WWF Jakked]]'', ''[[WWE Velocity]]'', and ''[[WWE Heat|WWE Sunday Night Heat]]'' as an independent [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]] several times from 2001 to 2004. Anderson made some appearances on ''[[TNA Xplosion]]'' and was initially approached for a contract at [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] by [[Jeff Jarrett]] but communications broke down.<ref name="Kennedy interview"/> Anderson competed in the 2002 and 2003 [[Ted Petty Invitational]] tournaments (the first one then known as the Sweet Science Sixteen tournament) but did not advance past the first round in either of them.<ref name="SLAM!"/> After wrestling for over six years,<ref name=about/> in February 2005, WWE signed Anderson to a developmental contract.<ref name="Kennedy interview"/>

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2005<U+2013>present)===
Upon signing with WWE, Anderson was sent to the [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW) [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territory]]. After six months he was called up to work on ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]''. Before his first ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' match, a victory over [[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]], he showed himself to be a cocky and arrogant wrestler with not only his mannerisms but by taking a microphone and performing his own ring announcement.<ref name="MiamiHerald" /><ref>{{cite episode |title=SmackDown! |series=WWE Friday Night SmackDown |serieslink=WWE Friday Night SmackDown |credits= |network=[[UPN]] |station= |airdate=2005-08-11 |season=6 |seriesno= |number= |minutes= }}</ref> He referred to himself as "Mr. Anderson" for this match. A few weeks later, to avoid comparisons with the more famous [[Anderson family]] (as well as former [[Cincinnati Bengals]] [[quarterback]] [[Ken Anderson (American football)|Ken Anderson]]), he changed his name to "Ken Kennedy", or "Mr. Kennedy".<ref name="Kennedy interview"/> This idea was initially suggested by [[Paul Heyman]] and was chosen as his name because it is the middle name of WWE Chairman [[Vince McMahon]].<ref name="WrestlingObserver">{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/?aID=15314|last=Pollock|first=John|title=Ken Kennedy interview on injury, name, Guerrero and future|publisher=Wrestling Observer|accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref>

[[ring announcer]] [[Tony Chimel]], based on Kennedy believing that Chimel's announcing was not done well enough or with sufficient respect, and therefore performing his own introductions or forcing Chimel to introduce him again. Kennedy's self-ring introductions before the match became one of his trademarks.<ref name="MiamiHerald">{{cite journal|first=Jim|last=Varsallone|title=Introducing WrestleMania's Mr. Kennedy ...

Kennedy made his [[pay-per-view]] debut at ''SmackDown!'s'' [[No Mercy (2005)|No Mercy]], defeating [[Bob Holly|Hardcore Holly]] and injuring Holly's ribs during the match.<ref name="OWWProfile">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/k/ken-kennedy.html|title=Ken Kennedy profile| publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref>

On the November 11 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Kennedy faced [[Eddie Guerrero]] to compete for a spot on ''SmackDown!'''s [[Survivor Series (2005)|Survivor Series]] team. He lost the match when Guerrero tossed him a [[Folding chair|steel chair]] and played possum, a move which Guerrero had made famous. The groggy referee turned around and saw Guerrero on the ground with Kennedy holding the chair, and consequently [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualified]] Kennedy, awarding the place on Team SmackDown! to Guerrero. This was Kennedy's first loss. In retaliation, Kennedy struck Guerrero over the head with the chair after the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/11112005/|title=RAW ambushes SmackDown|date=2005-11-11|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref> This was Guerrero's final televised match,<ref name=mike/> as he died on November 13 in his hotel room in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. In interviews about the incident, Kennedy has stated that he considers this an "unfortunate honor".<ref name="WrestlingObserver"/>

In December 2005, Kennedy participated in WWE's "overseas" tour. On the second day in [[Italy]], Kennedy suffered a serious [[Latissimus dorsi muscle|latissimus dorsi]] tear.<ref name=mike>{{cite web|url=http://www.charleston.net/news/2007/dec/02/mr_kennedy_endures_pitfalls23762/|title='Mr. Kennedy' endures pitfalls|last=Mooneyham|first=Mike|work=[[The Post and Courier]]|date=December 2, 2007|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref> Even after surgery in December, Kennedy was still forced out of the ring for nearly six months while he rehabilitated the [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimate]] injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ken-kennedy.com/About/dec7th_05.html|title=Kennedy sidelined six months|work=WWE.com|publisher=Ken-Kennedy.com|accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref> He continued to make appearances on ''SmackDown!'' and ''Velocity'' throughout January and February, making his ring announcement and commentating specific matches as a representative of [[The Network (professional wrestling)#WWE incarnation|The Network]]. He even made an appearance on the January 11 episode of ''WWE Byte This!'' with [[Todd Grisham]] to maintain visibility.<ref name="ByteThis">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/content/media/video/webshows/bytethis/200601/11bytethis?section=%|title=Byte This - Ken Kennedy|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref>

This led to ''SmackDown!'' [[Professional wrestling authority figures#SmackDown! brand authorities|General Manager]] [[Theodore Long]] making a match between Kennedy and [[The Undertaker]], who Kennedy had never faced, to be held at [[No Mercy (2006)|No Mercy]].

However, Long put him against an opponent who he had never faced&mdash;this time [[Chris Benoit]]&mdash;with Kennedy's title on the line. Long said that, if Kennedy were to defeat Benoit, he would be given his release and be allowed to go to Raw. Kennedy lost the United States Championship to Benoit after a distraction from the Undertaker.

In November 2006, Kennedy joined forces with [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] (MVP) in matches against the [[Brothers of Destruction]] (Undertaker and [[Glenn Jacobs|Kane]]) in various combinations. On a November episode of ''SmackDown!'', Kennedy and MVP lost to the Brothers of Destruction three times.
