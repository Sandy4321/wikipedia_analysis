:'''"Say to the king-(i.e. [[pharaoh]]), my lord, my god, my Sun: Message of ''Yapahu'', your servant, the dirt at your feet, I [[Prostration formula|fall at the feet]] of the king, my lord, my god, my Sun, 7 times and 7 times. Whatsoever the king, my lord, has said to me, I have listened to with the greatest care. Moreover, I have become like a ([[bronze]])&ndash;pot: '''''s<U+00ED>-ri''''' given in pledge, because of the [[Sutean]]s. I have, however, just heard the sweet breath of the king. It has come forth to me, and my heart is very content."'''  -EA 297, lines 1-21 (complete)

[[Prostration formula|Truly, I fall at the feet]] of the king, my lord, my god, my Sun, the Sun from the sky, 7 times and 7 times, on the stomach and on the back.'''
:'''(12-14) I have listened to the words of the [[messenger]] of the king, my lord, very carefully,-(MA-[[GAL (cuneiform)|GAL]], MA-[[GAL (cuneiform)|GAL]]).'''
:'''(15-21) May the king, my lord, the [[Ra|Sun]] from the sky, take thought for his land.
