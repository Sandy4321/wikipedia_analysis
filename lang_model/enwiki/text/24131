}}
'''''The Inbetweeners Movie''''' is a 2011 British [[Coming-of-age story|coming-of-age]] [[comedy film]] based on the [[E4 (channel)|E4]] [[sitcom]] ''[[The Inbetweeners]]'', written by series creators [[Damon Beesley]] and [[Iain Morris]] and directed by [[Ben Palmer]]. The film follows the misadventures of a group of teenage friends on holiday in [[Crete]] after the end of their final year at school together, and currently serves as an ending to the TV series. It stars [[Simon Bird]], [[Joe Thomas (actor)|Joe Thomas]], [[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]] and [[Blake Harrison]]. The film was released on 19 August 2011 in the UK and Ireland. A [[#Sequel|sequel]] will be released in August 2014.

==Plot==
Friends [[Will McKenzie]], [[Simon Cooper (The Inbetweeners)|Simon Cooper]], [[Jay Cartwright]], and [[Neil Sutherland]] have finished their [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] and are about to leave Rudge Park Comprehensive, much to the relief of [[Mr. Gilbert]], their [[Sardonicism|sardonic]], mean [[sixth form]] tutor. Within their final week of school, Jay's grandfather dies, Simon is dumped by his girlfriend [[Carli D'Amato]], and Will's divorced father tells him he has married his much younger mistress. The boys decide to go on holiday together and Neil books them on a trip to [[Malia, Crete]]. 

Upon arriving in Malia, they discover that their accommodation is a filthy, run-down old flat with only one bedroom and a sofa bed, which confuses Neil as it apparently looked different on the booking process. On the way to the bars, the boys encounter a strange, annoying youngster named Richard (Theo Barklem-Biggs) who came alone to Malia for a holiday. While walking past the bars, the boys are tricked into entering a bar which is really empty. After a while, they meet four girls who also frequent the pub; Alison, Lucy, Lisa and Jane. Their initial meeting does not go smoothly; Will chats to Alison and initially gets on with her, finding that she is as witty and intelligent as him, but ends up accidentally poking fun at her clich<U+00E9>d "Greek waiter boyfriend"; Simon struggles to talk to Lucy, who takes an interest in him, but bores her by talking non-stop about Carli; Neil has a non-conversation with Lisa, before ditching her for two older women, and Jay gets stuck with the bubbly and overweight Jane. Less than pleased, the girls go on their way, but arrange to meet the boys at their hotel the next day. Outside the bar, Simon sees Carli across the street; this is because Neil asked Carli where she was going on holiday and absentmindedly booked the same place. Simon angrily tells Neil that the point of the holiday was to take his mind off Carli, but decides to go and speak to her. He talks awkwardly with her before being knocked down by a [[All-terrain vehicle|quad-bike]] ridden by James, a cocky and abusive [[alpha male]] club rep and Carli's new boyfriend. Carli reveals she is going to an all-day boat party later in the week, and Simon pledges to meet her there.

The next morning, Will and Simon awaken to the sound of Neil having sex with a late middle-aged woman and find Jay sleeping face-down in an ants' nest outside. After sobering up, they go to meet the girls by their hotel pool. While there, the boys take some reserved sun loungers by throwing the towels placed over them into the pool, and an irritating, obnoxious little boy publicly humiliates Jay by pushing him into the pool and, when Jay finally catches him, pulling his shorts down, and Jay retaliates by picking him up and throwing him into the pool, only to discover that he genuinely cannot swim, forcing some hotel patrons to jump in and save him. As this is happening, the man who had reserved the sun loungers turns up and angrily demands the chairs, and their towels, and gets into an argument with Will. When the staff try to move them, Will shamelessly points out that the man's daughter, who is in a wheelchair, does not even need another chair, to the disgust of the other patrons. Having publicly humiliated themselves and caused a scene, the boys are quickly ejected from the hotel. Outside, Jay and Simon get into an argument; Jay complains of Simon's continuing obsession with Carli and his constant moaning, while Simon berates Jay's continual lying and false bravado, and they have a 'fight' (of a fashion) in the street. Will and Neil separate the pair and drag off Simon and Jay, respectively, in different directions. Desperate to buy a ticket for the boat party, Simon naively sells all his clothes to James, including what he is wearing, but never gets paid for them and is left naked. Meanwhile, Jay angrily tears up two of the four boat party tickets he secretly bought for all of them while drunk the night before as a surprise, hence having shown a kinder side. He and Neil then go to a nightclub later that night hoping to meet more girls, only to witness a [[male stripper]] performing [[autofellatio]] on stage. The duo subsequently run into James and his 'friends', and try to befriend him. James rudely threatens to injure Jay if they don't leave. Later that evening, the four boys meet back at the empty bar and bury the hatchet. Before long, the girls turn up and suggest that they all go [[skinny dipping]] at the local beach. Jane attempts to kiss Jay, but when two men poke fun at him over her weight and Jay pulls away, she leaves him behind. Will has better luck with Alison until she spots her boyfriend, Nicos, having sex with another woman, and she leaves crying. In the water, Lucy and Simon appear to be growing closer, and are about to kiss, when he sees Carli on the beach and leaves Lucy alone in the sea. Fed up with how the holiday is going, Will casually contemplates suicide in their flat's swimming pool, but Neil cheers him up and the boys, deciding to make the most of their holiday, go out partying.

The next day, they meet the girls again at the beach, although Lucy turns and walks down the beach when she sees Simon, and he follows her when Alison suggests he goes and talks to her. Seeing Will in a difficult state, Alison cheers him up, and decides to give him Nicos' ticket. On the beach, Simon apologises to Lucy, and she offers him her boat party ticket so that he can be with Carli, and Simon, once again missing this display of kindness, takes the ticket, thanks her and leaves. On board, Simon witnesses an argument with Carli and James. Later on, Carli kisses him passionately, and he is elated, until he realises that she is just using him to make James jealous. Finally seeing Carli for what she really is, he ditches her. Jay apologises to Jane, and she takes him into the toilets to perform oral sex. After finishing, they encounter James, who mocks Jane's weight and demands a [[banknote]] from Jay, so that he can snort drugs. Getting his own back, Jay gives him a <U+20AC>20 note that had been concealed in his [[anus]] to be used as a [[bribe]] for 'corrupt foreign police' when necessary, resulting in James unknowingly walking around with [[feces]] on the end of his nose, causing all the girls he flirts with to walk away in disgust, to his confusion. Neil bumps into Richard during the boat party and is introduced to Richard's parents (both senior citizens), who came over at Richard's request to pick him up. When Neil is about to kiss the mother as a polite gesture, Lisa rushes over and tells her to back off, as she thinks Neil is trying to make moves on her like he did with the other older women at the bar. After Neil tells Lisa that his girlfriend back home dumped him, and he did not want to tell the others to save on being embarrassed, they feel no longer limited in the kind of sex they have.

Meanwhile, Alison and Will form a relationship, and Simon finally sees that Lucy, who gave him her ticket so that he could attend the party, is more worthy of his attention than the shallow Carli. Knowing that he has been less than kind to her, and encouraged by everyone on the boat, he decides to swim all the way to shore to tell her how he feels, as a grand romantic gesture, and dives into the sea. The strong tidal drift causes him to struggle and he almost drowns, and has to be airlifted to shore. As paramedics load him into an ambulance, a concerned Lucy rushes forward and kisses him, and they reconcile whilst Simon tells her 'It's normally bigger, it's just cold'.

After the boat party is over, the other boys and girls visit Simon in hospital, and once he recovers they all spend the rest of their holiday together as couples. The four head home to the UK. As they meet their families at the airport, their girlfriends exit the same terminal and introduce themselves to the boys' parents as the film ends. Neil and Lisa quickly rush from the airport when Nicole is also waiting for him at the airport (Neil had lied about Nicole dumping him during the boat party). In a final scene before the credits, a drunken Mr. Gilbert is seen riding a [[quad bike]] through the streets of Malia in his underwear with a [[Necktie|tie]] round his head in a [[John Rambo]] style.

==Release==
===Box office===
On its first day of release, ''The Inbetweeners Movie'' grossed over <U+00A3>2.5 million in 409 cinemas, outperforming ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]''.<ref>http://www.gigwise.com/news/66040/The-Inbetweeners-Movie-Is-A-Box-Office-Hit</ref> The film then went on to set a new record for the most successful opening weekend ever achieved by a comedy film in the UK, overtaking ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (film)|Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]'' and ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'' after earning <U+00A3>13,200,000. It retained its number 1 position in the UK film charts for 4 weeks and for 3 weeks in the [[Republic of Ireland]], finally being overtaken by ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'' on 16 September 2011. The film saw a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] in the United States on 7 September 2012, where it grossed $36,000, making its total box office revenue $88,025,781.

===Critical reception===
''The Inbetweeners Movie'' received mostly positive reviews upon its original United Kingdom release in August 2011. Following release in the United States in September 2012, critical reaction was less favourable, with the film at first holding a 75% score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and having since dropped to 54% yet keeping a 74% rating in the user/audience section, with the site's consensus "It arguably plays most strongly to fans of the BBC series [sic]<!-- N.B. series is shown on BBC America -->, but even viewers who have never seen ''The Inbetweeners'' on TV may find themselves won over by the film's surprisingly tender ribaldry."{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} 
At the website [[Metacritic]], which uses a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating system, the film received a mixed rating of 44/100 based on 36 reviews.<ref name="Metacritic">{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-inbetweeners-movie | title = The Inbetweeners Movie | publisher = [[CBS]] | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = 7 August 2012}}</ref>

Ian Freer of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film four stars out of five, observing that "Like any holiday, it is episodic and suffers from repetition but this is gag-for-gag the funniest film of the summer and a fitting end to a much-loved series."<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=137335 Empire Online]</ref> Steve Rose of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film three stars out of five, giving particular praise to Simon Bird's performance and arguing that the film "updates the teen summer holiday formula surprisingly entertainingly, considering it doesn't subvert it one iota and the formula was already done previously with ''[[Holiday on the Buses]]'' and ''[[Kevin & Perry Go Large]]'' among others."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/aug/17/the-inbetweeners-movie-review | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Steve | last=Rose | title=The Inbetweeners Movie <U+2013> review | date=17 August 2011}}</ref> Tim Robey of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' also gave a positive assessment of the film, praising it as "an enormous hit, a ''[[Mamma Mia!

===Home media===
On 12 December 2011, ''The Inbetweeners Movie'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] in the UK by [[Channel 4|4DVD]], with the latter version sold as a triple pack containing both formats along with a [[digital copy]] of the film. Both versions include a number of special features, such as a [[making-of]] documentary, footage from the film's London premiere, various [[deleted scene]]s, [[Audio commentary|cast commentaries]] and a [[blooper]] reel.<ref>http://www.blu-raydisc-reporter.com/2011/10/the-inbetweeners-movie-blu-ray/</ref>

Following its appearance in UK stores, the DVD quickly became a major financial success. Within less than a week, the film became the third fastest-selling British home media release of 2011 after ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows <U+2013> Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows <U+2013> Part 2]]'', with approximately 575,000 copies sold in the first day of its release.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/dec/14/inbetweeners-dvd-set-for-sales-record | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Mark | last=Sweney | title=Inbetweeners DVD set for sales record | date=14 December 2011}}</ref> By 17 December, estimated sales reached one million, resulting in the film displacing the home media release of ''[[Paul (film)|Paul]]'' as one of the five best-selling DVDs of the year in the UK.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8963318/HMV-heads-for-a-record-loss.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Harry|last=Wallop|title=HMV heads for a record loss|date=17 December 2011}}</ref><ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/16197972</ref>

====Extended version====
The Blu-ray release also features an extended cut of the film that restores approximately four minutes of material omitted from the theatrical release, most notably an additional scene in which Will and Simon encounter a drunken Mr. Gilbert on a Malia stag weekend. These additions resulted in the extended cut being rated an 18, as opposed to the 15 rating of the theatrical release.

==Sequel==
{{main|The Inbetweeners Movie 2}}
Although originally intended as an unambiguous ending to the television series, the unprecedented popularity and box office success of ''The Inbetweeners Movie'' has led to speculation over the possibility of a [[sequel]]. Anonymous claims that a second film, involving Will, Jay, Simon, and Neil reuniting four years later for a [[stag party]] prior to Neil's wedding, is already in the early stages of production, had been consistently denied by the cast and crew, with screenwriter [[Iain Morris]] commenting that he had never heard any discussion of a sequel prior to the aforementioned rumours appearing in an article in the ''[[Daily Mirror]].''<ref>http://www.metro.co.uk/film/874472-the-inbetweeners-movie-sequel-gets-go-ahead-as-boys-reunite-for-wedding</ref> All four members of the main cast had expressed a willingness to return for another ''Inbetweeners'' film in the future if necessary, with [[Simon Bird]] commenting that "I wouldn't rule it out. We'll wait and see."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/dec/18/inbetweeners-movie-faces-2011-comedy | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Tom | last=Lamont | title=The Inbetweeners: 'Our movie's success doesn't make any logical sense' | date=18 December 2011}}</ref>  

Producer [[Christopher Young]] has also openly recognised the possibility of another film based on the series, claiming that "if there is a sequel it will come from the creative elements&nbsp;... We've talked about it. In the short term people are dispersing and doing other things but I'm sure in the medium term a sequel is very possible. It won't be immediate but it's definitely not closed."<ref>http://www.screendaily.com/news/uk-ireland/the-inbetweeners-movie-anatomy-of-a-uk-hit/5032152.article</ref>

''The Inbetweeners Movie'' won [[Empire Award for Best Comedy|Best Comedy]] at the [[17th Empire Awards|2012 Empire Awards]], where [[Blake Harrison]] and [[Tamla Kari]] expressed interest in a sequel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inbetweeners star: Never say never to a sequel!|url=http://movies.uk.msn.com/features/inbetweeners-star-never-say-never-to-a-sequel|work=Lucy Mapstone, editor, MSN Celebrity|publisher=[[MSN]]|date=25 March 2012|accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref>

On 21 August 2012, it was announced that a sequel is in early stages of pre-production.<ref>{{cite web|title='Inbetweeners' movie sequel confirmed to be in the works|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/s121/the-inbetweeners/news/a400709/inbetweeners-movie-sequel-confirmed-to-be-in-the-works.html|work=Tom Eames|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref>
On 8 November, it was announced by series creators Morris and [[Damon Beesley]] that a script was being written and it is at "version 0.5"<ref>http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-11-08/the-inbetweeners-movie-2-were-getting-close</ref>
On 1 May 2013, <!-- following an article in the Sun newspaper --> it was announced <!-- on the official Inbetweeners [[Facebook]] page --> that although nothing had been signed a sequel is in the planning stage possibly set in [[Australia]] and to be released sometime in 2014 <ref>https://en-gb.facebook.com/e4inbetweeners</ref><ref>http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4909806/inbetweeners-movie-sequel.html</ref>

On 25 July, [[Simon Bird]] confirmed that a script for the sequel is in the works, but did state that it may take some time before production begins. At a launch event for his new comedy series ''Chickens'', he stated that they "...are doing another movie, but writing it takes a lot longer than people assume." He also went on to say that "...when the last movie was such a success, people think you can just go ahead and do another just like it straight away. But the writers have to have time to work on the script and come up with ideas. I also think us actors wanted just a little bit of a break.", implying that the sequel will not begin production in the meantime to ensure that the film maintains a high level of quality in the script and the overall film at the time of its release in the future.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} 

On 2 August 2013, ''[[The Inbetweeners Movie 2]]'' was officially confirmed for release in August 2014.<ref>{{cite news|title='The Inbetweeners Movie 2' officially confirmed for August 2014 release|url=http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/the-inbetweeners-movie-2-officially-confirmed-for/315278|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=nme.com|date=2 August 2013}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=The Inbetweeners Movie 2 officially confirmed for August 2014 release|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/s121/the-inbetweeners/news/a503482/the-inbetweeners-movie-2-officially-confirmed-for-august-2014-release.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=digitalspy.co.uk|date=2 August 2013}}</ref>
