It is part of the Beaumont&ndash;Port Arthur [[Beaumont<U+2013>Port Arthur metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Also referred to as the "Golden Triangle Area, due the triangular shape the bordering cities make.

==Geography==
Nederland is located at {{Coord|29|58|23|N|93|59|48|W|city}} (29.973113, -93.996715){{GR|1}}.

== History ==

Nederland was founded in 1897 by [[Netherlands|Dutch]]<ref>[http://www.wtblock.com/wtblockjr/centenni.htm#continuefrom / "WT Block.com March 2010"]</ref> settlers (''Nederland'' is the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name for "lowlands")as a repayment for financial services of Dutch bankers who financed the Kansas City Southern railroad line that runs through the center of the city. The more prominent families were named [[Rienstra]], [[Doornbos]] and Van Oostrom, and their descendants still live in the area today. Tradition says they were attracted to the flat coastal terrain that reminded them of their homeland (although the heat most certainly did not). The downtown area bears its English and Dutch street names still today.

Nederland's early economy was driven by rice and dairy farming.  However, the depression of 1907 and overproduction caused the rice industry in the town to collapse.  Many Dutch settlers moved away from the area during this time, but a small percentage remained.  After the [[Spindletop]] gusher discovery of 1901 and the establishment of the Sun Oil terminal near Nederland, the town became a residential community for the workers of the nearby oil terminals.

Nederland became incorporated as a township in 1940.  The surrounding larger cities of Beaumont, Port Arthur and [[Orange, Texas|Orange]] came to be known as the [[Golden Triangle (Texas)|Golden Triangle]]. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Port of Beaumont was as important as [[New Orleans]] or [[Houston]]/[[Galveston]], and Nederland thrived as a result.  

The refineries also attracted a large population of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] laborers into the area. The area drew particularly heavily from [[southern Louisiana]], and a strong [[Cajun]] flair is evident throughout the community. With the decline of oil prices in the 1980s, the local economy suffered and Nederland experienced slight population losses, but has stablized in the late 1990s and 2000s.

On September 23, 2005, Nederland was hit by Hurricane Rita, a category 3 hurricane.

On September 13, 2008, Nederland was hit by hurricane-force winds of [[Hurricane Ike]].
