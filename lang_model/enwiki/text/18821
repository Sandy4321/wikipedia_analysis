'''Lyman Hall''' (February 18, 1859 &ndash; August 16, 1905) was a [[professor]] and [[chancellor (education)|president]] of the Georgia School of Technology (now called the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], commonly referred to as Georgia Tech). He is perhaps best known for bringing what is now the School of Polymer, Textile & Fiber Engineering to Georgia Tech. Hall's administration also introduced degrees in [[electrical engineering]] and [[civil engineering]] in December 1896, [[textile engineering]] in February 1899, and [[chemical engineering|engineering chemistry]] in January 1901. Hall died in 1905, reportedly due to the stress of fundraising for a new chemistry building which now bears his name.

== Early life ==
Born in 1859 in [[Americus, Georgia]], he attended [[Mercer University]] in [[Penfield, Georgia]].<ref name="ens">{{cite book|first=Robert C.|last=McMath|coauthors=Ronald H. Bayor, James E.

He was then a professor at the [[Moreland Park Military Academy]] before Georgia Tech recruited him.<ref name="ens"/><!-- p45-46 -->

== Career ==
In 1888, [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] Lyman Hall was appointed Georgia Tech's first mathematics professor (and consequently head of the school's mathematics department). He had a solid background in engineering due to his time at West Point and often incorporated surveying and other engineering applications into his coursework. He had an energetic personality and quickly assumed a leadership position among the faculty.<ref name="ens"/><!-- p45-46, 50 --> At the first faculty meeting on October 5, 1888, he was elected secretary.<ref name="ens"/><!-- p50 --> On June 25, 1895, Professor Hall was invited to speak to Georgia Tech's board about the school's needs. While there were no recorded minutes, subsequent board actions suggest that he recommended the construction of on-campus dormitories to reduce disciplinary problems, and a more proactive recruitment of students.<ref name="ens"/><!-- p64 -->

Previous president [[Isaac S. Hopkins]] tendered his resignation in May 1895 because he had been elected president of the First Methodist Church of Atlanta and he could not do "justice to both to the school and the church".<ref name="ens"/><!-- p65 --> While several successors were considered, [[Samuel M. Inman]] proposed that the decision be postponed. Georgia Tech's trustees correspondingly elected Hall as the chairman of the faculty (acting president) From January 1, 1896 to July 1, 1896.<ref name="ens"/><!-- p65 --> On June 24, the trustees elected him the institute's second president.<ref name="dhwg">{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Wallace|title=Dress Her in WHITE and GOLD: A biography of Georgia Tech|publisher=The Georgia Tech Foundation, Inc|year=1969}}</ref>

As president, Hall was noted for his aggressive fundraising and improvements to the school, including his special project, the [[Aaron S. French]] Textile School.<ref name="earlypresidents">{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/finding-aids/display/xsl/UA004|title=Biographies of the Early Presidents|format=HTML|work=Inventory of the Early Presidents Collection, 1879-1957 (bulk 1930-1950)|publisher=Georgia Tech Archives & Records Management|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> In February 1899, Georgia Tech opened the first [[textile engineering]] school in the [[Southern United States]],<ref name="Textile">{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/gtbuildings/french/growth.htm|title="Splendid Growth" - The Textile Educational Enterprise at Georgia Tech|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology Library|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> with $10,000 from the Georgia General Assembly, $20,000 of donated machinery, and $13,500 from supporters.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070614175203/http://www.development.gatech.edu/colleges-schools/engineering/textile-fiber/|archivedate=2007-06-14|url=http://www.development.gatech.edu/colleges-schools/engineering/textile-fiber/|title=Polymer, Textile and Fiber Engineering: History|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> It named the A. French Textile School, after its chief donor and supporter, [[Aaron S. French]].

Lyman Hall's other goals included enlarging Tech and attracting more students, so he expanded the school's offerings beyond mechanical engineering; the new degrees introduced during Hall's administration included [[electrical engineering]] and [[civil engineering]] in December 1896, [[textile engineering]] in February 1899, and [[chemical engineering|engineering chemistry]] in January 1901.<ref name="ens"/><!-- p71, 77, 92--><ref name="Hall">{{cite web|url = http://www.library.gatech.edu/gtbuildings/hall.htm|title=The Hall Administration, 1895-1905|format = HTML|work = "A Thousand Wheels are set in Motion" - The Building of Georgia Tech at the Turn of the 20th Century, 1888-1908|publisher = Georgia Tech Library and Information Center|accessdate= 2007-07-09}}</ref> Hall also became infamous as a disciplinarian, even suspending the entire senior class of 1901 for returning from [[Christmas]] vacation a day late.<ref>{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Edwards|url=http://technique.library.gatech.edu/issues/winter1998/jan16/campuslife7.html|title=Ramblins: Hall handed down stiff penalty for senior prank|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1998-01-16|accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref> 

Lyman Hall died on August 16, 1905 during a vacation at a [[New York]] health resort. His death while still in office was attributed to stress from his strenuous fund raising activities (this time, for a new Chemistry building).<ref name="ens"/><!-- p 102--> Later that year, the school's trustees named the new chemistry building the "Lyman Hall Laboratory of Chemistry" in his honor.<ref name="ens"/><!-- p102--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/gtbuildings/lyman.htm|title=Lyman Hall Chemistry Building|format = HTML|work = "A Thousand Wheels are set in Motion" - The Building of Georgia Tech at the Turn of the 20th Century, 1888-1908|publisher = Georgia Tech Library and Information Center|accessdate= 2007-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/campusmap/bldngmodel.php?id=29A|title=Lyman Hall|work=Campus Map|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref>

Erected in 1905 and named in his honor, The Lyman Hall Laboratory of Chemistry at Georgia Tech is commonly referred to by students as "Lyman Hall" or simply "Lyman", due to the common mistaken impression that the word "Hall" is a mere descriptor.<ref name="map">{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/map/?id=29A|title=Campus Map: Lyman Hall|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/gtbuildings/lyman.htm|title=Lyman Hall Chemistry Building|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facilities.gatech.edu/campusmaps/bldngmodel.php?id=0029A|title=Lyman Hall|publisher=Georgia Tech Facilities|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref> It now houses the Bursar's Office after being completely gutted in 1988, but the quote from geologist [[Archibald Geikie|Sir Archibald Geikie]]'s 1905 published work remains on the front of the building: "In the first place I would put accuracy."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA300&lpg=PA300&dq=%22in+the+first+place+I+would+put+accuracy%22+A+Geikie&sig=trRLA4YQd4A9RGq5Youe5m4JMKM&id=FngJAAAAIAAJ&ots=D2LIqUNHnk&output=text|title=Landscape in History and Other Essays|first=Archibald|last=Geikie|authorlink=Archibald Geikie|date=1905|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=New York, NY}}</ref>

The 1903 to 1906 school announcements describe the architecture of the building in great detail:<ref name="bld">{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/gtbuildings/gtanno190506-92a.htm|title=Lyman Hall Laboratory of Chemistry|work=GT Buildings|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Library]]|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref>
{{quote|The Lyman Hall Laboratory of Chemistry, which is in the shape of a T, is of brick with limestone trimmings, and is two stories in height, with a full basement. Each floor has an approximate area of 5,600 square feet. The lecture-rooms, stock-rooms, library, offices, gas analysis laboratory, photographic and spectroscopic rooms occupy the front, and the laboratories the rear wing. Especial care has been given to lighting and ventilation, the laboratories being lighted on three sides. For the removal of noxious gases, they are amply provided with hoods, each of which has a separate flue leading to a tight wooden fume-box loaced just under the roof. This box communicates with the outer air, and can be provided with forced draught if necessary. The Chemical and Physical laboratories have been fitted up with reference to practical work, and such addition will be made from time to time as may be required for experimental research. The apparatus and appliances are of the newest and best forms, and will be increased as occasion may demand.<ref name="bld"/>}}
