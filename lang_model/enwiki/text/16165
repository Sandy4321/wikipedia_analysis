He was a member of the Meic Torcaill, a Dublin family of significance since the early twelfth century.

Control of the wealthy coastal kingdom was bitterly contested during Ascall's floruit, with members of his immediate family, as well as Islesmen and Irishmen, all securing power for brief periods of time. Throughout much of this period, however, the overlord of Dublin was [[Diarmait Mac Murchada|Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of Leinster]]. In 1166, after the death of his close ally [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn|Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, High King of Ireland]], Mac Murchada was beset by his enemies. At this critical point of his reign, Mac Murchada lost the support of the Dubliners, which contributed to his expulsion from Ireland that year. Not long afterwards, however, Mac Murchada made his return through significant military assistance of mercenary English adventurers. In the latter half of 1170, Dublin itself fell to the combined forces of Mac Murchada and the powerful English magnate [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare, Earl of Pembroke]].

With the collapse of the Norse-Gaelic kingdom, Ascall and the Dublin elite were forced to flee into what one source calls the "northern islands", a reference to either the [[Kingdom of the Isles]] or the [[Earldom of Orkney]]. About a year later, not long after Mac Murchada's death, Ascall attempted to regain his patrimony from the English. Unfortunately for himself, his invasion of Dublin ended in utter failure, and he was executed by the English governor of the town. Immediately following his fall, Dublin was besieged by a combined force of Irishmen and Islesmen. The town, however, remained firmly in the hands of the English; and before the end of the year, the Dublin passed into the direct control of [[Henry II of England|Henry II, King of England]], who converted it into an English royal town.

Ascall's father was [[Ragnall mac Torcaill]] (died 1146), a man who may well have ruled as [[King of Dublin]].<ref>[[#D5|Downham (2013)]] p. 178; [[#D1|Downham (2007)]] p. 43 illus. 1.</ref> The men were members of the Meic Torcaill, a substantial landholding kindred in the kingdom.<ref name="D5-164=D1-39">[[#D5|Downham (2013)]] p. 165; [[#D1|Downham (2007)]] p. 39.</ref> Several members of this [[Norse-Gaelic]] family held the kingship in the twelfth century.

At the midpoint of the twelfth century, the kingdom was under the overlordship of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada|Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of Leinster]] (died 1171).

The record of events during the mid part of the twelfth century suggests that Leinster-based overkings of Dublin enjoyed the cooperation of the indigenous leaders of Dublin, and the emergence of the Meic Torcaill during this period may well fit into such a context. When an indigenous ruler was not to be found, however, the Dubliners seem to have sought leadership from the Isles, rather than endure a non-Leinster overking, as evidenced by the aforesaid episode concerning Gofraid.<ref name="D5-167168=D1-4041">[[#D5|Downham (2013)]] pp. 167&ndash;168; [[#D1|Downham (2007)]] pp. 40&ndash;41.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The Dubliners, therefore, appear to have preferred rulers of [[Norse-Gaelic]] descent.<ref name="D5-167168=D1-4041"/> Modern scholars sometimes use the term "Ostmen" to denote the Dubliners and other Norse-Gaelic people of Ireland. The earliest form of the term in an Irish context dates to about 1173, several years after the English conquest of the Ireland's Norse-Gaelic settlements. The term, therefore, may well have been originally introduced by the conquering English incomers.<ref>[[#P1|Purcell (2003&ndash;2004)]] p. 276 n. 2.</ref> Whatever the case, the name still exists today as [[Oxmantown]], an area of [[Dublin|modern-day Dublin]].<ref>[[#D4|Duffy (1998)]] p. 85.</ref> For consistency, this article uses the term "Norse-Gaelic" throughout in reference to Dubliners, Islesmen, and other people of mixed [[Gaels|Gaelic]] and Scandinavian ethnicity.

==Fall of Mac Murchada and rise of Ua Conchobair==

Within the same year as Mac Lochlainn's demise, Ua Conchobair and his allies expulsed Mac Murchada from not only Dublin, but Ireland altogether; and Ua Conchobair himself was duly recognised as High King of Ireland.<ref>[[#F3|Flanagan (2004d)]].</ref> 

According to the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'', he had secured the cooperation of Dublin, and perhaps gained the kingship of the town itself, through a stipend of 4,000 cows.<ref>[[#A1|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013a)]] <U+00A7> 1166.13; [[#A4|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013b)]] <U+00A7> 1166.13; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 129&ndash;130.</ref> In consequence, Dubliners formed part of Ua Conchobair's forces when he marched to [[Drogheda]] and [[Leinster]], where he forced the submissions of the kings of [[King of Airgialla|Airgialla]] and [[King of Leinster|Leinster]] respectively.<ref>[[#A1|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013a)]] <U+00A7><U+00A7> 1166.13, 1166.14; [[#A4|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013b)]] <U+00A7><U+00A7> 1166.13, 1166.14; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] p. 130.</ref> In fact, Dublin appears to have formed a key part of Ua Conchobair's arsenal, and it is apparent that Mac Murchada was doomed without the support of this coastal-kingdom.<ref>[[#D4|Duffy (1998)]] p. 78; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 130&ndash;131.</ref> Certainly, the ''[[Song of Dermot and the Earl]]'' relates that Ascall ("''MacTurkyl de Diveline''") had abandoned his former overlord,<ref>[[#S3|''Song of Dermot'' ...

The following year, Ua Conchobair convened a great assembly at [[Athboy]]. The ''Annals of the Four Masters'' states that 13,000 horsemen attended the meeting&mdash;1,000 of which were supplied from Dublin. One of the many rulers recorded to have attended this gathering is a certain Ragnall mac Ragnaill, styled ''tigerna Gall'' ("lord of the foreigners").<ref>[[#A1|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013a)]] <U+00A7> 1167.10; [[#A4|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013b)]] <U+00A7> 1167.10; [[#F8|Flanagan (1997)]] p. 64; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] p. 131.</ref> The latter's name and title suggest that he was either an otherwise unattested brother of Ascall, or else an annalist's mistake for Ascall himself.<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] p. 131, 131 n. 182.</ref> Meanwhile, after his expulsion from Ireland, Mac Murchada sought out Henry on [[Continental Europe|the Continent]], and gained permission to recruit military aid from the latter's subjects.
