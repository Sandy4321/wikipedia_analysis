The 33-acre archaeological site, numbered 1Ee89, is outside Wetumpka on the lower [[Coosa River]], north of where it joins the [[Tallapoosa River]]. It is a former village with a ceremonial ground, burial grounds, and refuse sites.<ref name=wesson/><ref name="montgadvert">{{cite news |title=Oklahoma tribe opposes Creek casino in Alabama |author=Sebastian Kitchen |url=http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20120813/NEWS/120813015/Oklahoma-tribe-opposes-Creek-casino-Alabama |newspaper=Montgomery Advertiser |date=August 13, 2012 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref> 

==History==
The site was documented during historic times by [[William Bartram]] in the 1760s and [[Benjamin Hawkins]] in 1799.<ref name="earlyhist"/>  The town was home to several thousand Muscogee and served as the last capital of the National Council of the Creek Nation from 1802 until 1814.  During the [[Creek War]], the inhabitants who were not fighting in the war were confined at nearby [[Fort Jackson (Alabama)|Fort Jackson]].  After the end of the war, they were allowed to resettle the site and remained there until 1832, when they were forcibly removed to the Indian Territory.<ref name="casestudy">{{cite web |url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07092009-225709/unrestricted/Earnest_S_Dissertation_2009r.pdf |title=Constructions of Place, Culture, and Identity in Historic Preservation: A Case Study of Hickory Ground, Alabama |author=Samantha Earnest |date=2009 |publisher=Florida State University |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref>  

The site was rediscovered in 1968 by archaeologist David Chase of [[Auburn University]].   The rediscovery was not made public until much later, when plans to build apartments on the site were announced.<ref name=regain/><ref name=divide/>  Through the efforts of the [[Alabama Historical Commission]], the site was acquired through [[matching funds]] of $165,000 from the [[United States Department of the Interior]] and [[tax break]] incentives in early 1980.  Excavations in 1988 found evidence of occupation at the site during five distinct cultural periods, ranging from the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Early Archaic]] (8000<U+2013>6000 B.C.) to the historic Muscogee occupation.<ref name="casestudy"/>

==Controversy==
In August 1980, the property was granted to the [[Poarch Band of Creek Indians]] by the historical commission.<ref name="casestudy"/>  The land was placed under a 20 year easement that limited development of the property.  Following the expiration of the easement, the Poarch built a [[Native American gaming|Native American casino]] at the site from 2001<U+2013>02, which entailed the excavation of the casino site and subsequent exhumation of Muscogee graves.<ref name="montgadvert"/>  The [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation]] of [[Oklahoma]] called the initial construction at the site "deplorable" and claimed that many burials were disturbed in the initial construction.<ref name="wetumpkanews"/><ref name="montgadvert"/>  The announcement of a $246 million casino expansion in 2012, to create a 20-story hotel and casino at the site, caused further outcry from the Muscogee Nation and a threat of legal action.<ref name="montgadvert"/>  The Poarch denied that the historic site itself was affected by their development, stating in a news release that the actual site was "protected land that is not part of a casino expansion."<ref name="wfsb">{{cite news |title=Cultural Landmark Unaffected by Poarch Band of Creek Indians Economic Development Initiative |url=http://www.wfsb.com/story/19296407/cultural-landmark-unaffected-by-poarch-band-of-creek-indians-economic-development-initiative?clienttype=printable |newspaper=WFSB Channel 3 |date=August 16, 2012 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref>  The dispute over the development of the Hickory Ground is part of a wider disagreement between the Poarch Band and the Oklahoma Muscogee; some in the Oklahoma tribe view themselves as 'traditionalists' and see the Poarch Band, who stayed behind in Alabama when the rest of the Muscogee were removed during the [[Trail of Tears]], as being "questionable Indians".<ref name=divide>{{cite book|last=Wesson|first=Cameron B.|editor=K.
