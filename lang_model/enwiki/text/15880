'''24 Manai Telugu Chettiars''' is an [[Indian caste system|Indian caste]].

==Origins==
'''24 Manai Telegu Chettiars''' community is believed to have originated from the trader communities who descended from [[Vijayanagar]] Kingdom and settled around [[Madurai]](1530-1781 CE) and [[Thanjavur]] (1530-1674 CE).

Thanjavur was the heart of the [[Chola]] dynasty (from the 9th century to the 13th), but in the second quarter of the sixteenth century a Telugu Nayak viceroy (Raghunatha Nayaka) was appointed by the emperor of Vijayanagar, thus establishing a court whose language was [[Telugu]]. Telugu Nayak rulers acted as the governors in the present day [[Tamil Nadu]] area with headquarters at Madurai(1530-1781 CE) and Thanjavur (1530-1674 CE).

After the collapse of Vijayanagar, Thanjavur and Madurai Nayaks became independent and ruled for the next 150 years until they were replaced by [[Maratha]]s. This was the period when several Telugu families migrated from [[Andhra Pradesh]] and settled down in Thanjavur and Madurai.

The 24 Manai Telugu Cettiar community is called so because it consists of 24 Manai's or houses (similar to a gothra). These 24 houses are divided into 16 "Male" houses and 8 "Female" houses. According to tradition, people should only marry a person from opposite group (i.e., a person belonging to one of the 16 "male" houses should only marry a person belonging to one of th 8 "female" houses. This is not always followed now, though marrying within same house is a strict no-no. 
 
The community is classified under OBC (Other Backward Community) in Tamil Nadu. Telugupatty Chetty, is classified as MBC (Most Backward Community). In Karnataka, Sadhu Chetty is Classified as MBC.
