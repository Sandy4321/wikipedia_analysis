The '''Constitution of May 3, 1791''' ({{lang-pl|Konstytucja Trzeciego Maja}}; {{lang-lt|Gegu<U+017E><U+0117>s tre<U+010D>iosios konstitucija}}) was drafted between October 6, 1788, and May 3, 1791, and adopted as a "Government Act" (''Ustawa rz<U+0105>dowa'') by the [[Great Sejm]] of the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (a dualistic [[Sovereign state|state]] of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] ruled by a common [[monarch]]), on May 3, 1791. The constitution was designed to redress political defects of the Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth; the system of "[[Golden Liberty]]" had conferred disproportionate rights on the [[nobility]] (''[[szlachta]]''), and over time had corrupted politics. The Constitution's adoption was preceded by a period of agitation for, and gradual introduction of, reforms, beginning with the [[Convocation Sejm (1764)|Convocation Sejm of 1764]] and the [[Royal elections in Poland|election]] of [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August Poniatowski]] as the Commonwealth's [[List of Polish monarchs|last king]], and culminating in legislation adopted by the [[Great Sejm]], including the May 3 Constitution. 

The Constitution sought to supplant the prevailing anarchy, fostered by some of the country's [[magnate]]s, with a more democratic [[constitutional monarchy]]. It introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility and placed the [[peasant]]s under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of [[serfdom]]. It banned pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the ''[[liberum veto]]'', which had put the Sejm at the mercy of any single deputy who could choose, or be [[bribery|bribed]] by an interest or foreign power, to undo all the legislation that had been passed by that Sejm. The Constitution's adoption met with hostile political and military responses from the Commonwealth's neighbors. In the [[War in Defense of the Constitution]], the Commonwealth's ally [[Prussia]], under [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]], broke its alliance with the Commonwealth, which was effectively defeated by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]]'s [[Imperial Russia]] in alliance with the [[Targowica Confederation]], a coalition of Polish magnates and landless nobility who opposed reforms that might weaken their influence. The King, a principal co-author of the Constitution, eventually capitulated to the Confederates and threw in his lot with them.

[[Norman Davies]] describes the Constitution of May 3, 1791, as "the first constitution of its type in Europe"; other historians call it the world's second oldest constitution, after the [[U.S. Constitution]] that had come into effect in 1789.<ref name=ab/><ref name="Moyers2009"/><ref name="LapointeWolenski2009"/><ref name="nd"/>{{Ref label|a|a|none}} The 1791 document remained in force for only 14 months and 3 weeks. Yet, despite the King's capitulation, the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition of the Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1793), and the [[Third Partition of Poland|1795 demise]] of Poland, over the next 123 years of [[Partitions of Poland|Poland's partition]] the Constitution of May 3, 1791, was seen as an important step toward the eventual restoration of Poland's sovereignty. In the words of two of its other co-authors, [[Ignacy Potocki]] and [[Hugo Ko<U+0142><U+0142><U+0105>taj]], it was "the last will and testament of the expiring Country."{{Ref label|b|b|none}}

The May 3 Constitution responded to the increasingly perilous situation of the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]],<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-151"/> only a century earlier a major European power and indeed the largest state on the continent.<ref name="Wandycz2001-66"/> Already two hundred years before the May 3 Constitution, when the remarkable noble democracy was at its peak, King [[Sigismund III Vasa]]'s court [[preacher]], the [[Jesuit]] [[Piotr Skarga]], had famously condemned the individual and collective weaknesses of the Commonwealth.<ref name="Davies2005-273"/> Likewise, in the same period, other writers and philosophers such as [[Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski]]<ref name="Stone2001-98"/> and [[Wawrzyniec Grzyma<U+0142>a Go<U+015B>licki]],<ref name="Stone2001-106"/> and [[Jan Zamoyski]]'s ''[[egzekucja praw]]'' (Execution-of-the-Laws) [[reform movement]], had advocated reforms.<ref name="FedorowiczBogucka1982-110"/> Sigismund's son, King [[John II Casimir Vasa|John Casimir]], whose reign witnessed highly destructive wars and [[szlachta]] obstructionism, correctly predicted already in 1661, as he was struggling with the [[General sejm|Sejm]], that the Commonwealth was heading for a partition by [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]], [[Brandenburg-Prussia|Brandenburg]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]].<ref name="Gierowski 251"/>

In September 1773, [[Tadeusz Rejtan|Rejtan]] (''lower right'') tried to prevent ratification of the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] by barring other [[Sejm]] deputies from the chamber.]]
As their warnings failed to be heeded and sufficient reforms failed to be implemented, the state machinery became increasingly dysfunctional. Many historians hold that a major cause of the Commonwealth's downfall was the peculiar parliamentary institution of the ''[[liberum veto]]'' ("free veto"), which since 1652 had in principle permitted any Sejm deputy to nullify all the legislation that had been adopted by that Sejm.<ref name="Carsten1961"/> This had set up a dangerous precedent.<ref name="Carsten1961"/> Thus deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powers (primarily from the [[Russian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and France), or simply content to believe they were living in an unprecedented "Golden Age", for over a century paralysed the Commonwealth's government.<ref name="Carsten1961"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-156"/> The threat of the ''liberum veto'' could be only overridden by the establishment of a "[[confederated sejm]]", which operated immune from the ''liberum veto''.<ref name="Fazal2011"/> Declaring a sejm to be a "[[Confederation (Poland)|confederation]]" or belong to a confederation was a contrivance used in the 18th century (prominently by foreign interests) to force a legislative outcome.<ref name="Gierowski 63, 72"/>

By the early 18th century, the [[magnate]]s of Poland and Lithuania controlled the state <U+2013> or rather, they managed to ensure that no reforms would be carried out that might weaken their privileged status (the "[[Golden Freedoms]]").<ref name="Davies2005-274"/> They spent lavishly on banquets, drinking bouts and other amusements, while the peasants languished in abysmal conditions and the towns, many of which were wholly within the private property of a magnate who feared the rise of an independent middle class, were kept in a state of ruin.<ref name="Davies2005-274"/><ref name="DurantDurant1992"/>

The matters were not helped by the inefficient monarchs [[Royal elections in Poland|elected to the Commonwealth throne]] at the turn of the century:<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-153-154"/> [[Augustus II the Strong]] and [[Augustus III of Poland]] of the [[House of Wettin]]. The Wettins, used to the [[absolute monarchy|absolute rule]] practiced in their native [[Saxony]], attempted to rule through intimidation and the use of force, which led to the a series of conflicts between their supporters and opponents (including another pretender to the Polish throne, King [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Leszczy<U+0144>ski]]).<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-153-154"/> Those conflicts often took the form of [[Confederation (Poland)|confederations]] <U+2013> legal rebellions against the king permitted under the Golden Freedoms (some conflicts of that era included the [[Warsaw Confederation (1704)]], [[Sandomierz Confederation]], [[Tarnogr<U+00F3>d Confederation]], [[Dzik<U+00F3>w Confederation]] and the [[War of the Polish Succession]]).<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-153-154"/> Only 8 out 18 Sejm sessions during the reign of Augustus II passed legislation.<ref name="Wandycz2001-103-104"/> For a period in 30 years around the reign of Augustus III, only one session was able to pass legislation.<ref name="Davies1998"/> The government was near collapse, giving rise to the term "Polish anarchy", and the country was managed by provincial assemblies and magnates.<ref name="Davies1998"/>

There were also reform attempts in the Wettin era, led by individuals such as [[Kazimierz Karwowski]], [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Dunin-Karwicki]], [[Stanis<U+0142>aw A. Szczuka]] and [[J<U+00F3>zef Massalski]]; for the most part they proved to be futile.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-156"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-153-154"/>

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] greatly influenced [[Enlightenment in Poland|certain Commonwealth circles]] during the 1764<U+2013>95reign of its last king, [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August Poniatowski]]. Poniatowski was an "enlightened" Polish magnate and had been deputy to the Sejms of 1750, 1758, 1760, 1761, 1762 and 1764.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-157"/> As such he had a deeper understandings of Polish politics than previous monarchs.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-157"/> The [[Convocation Sejm (1764)|Convocation Sejm of 1764]] was controlled by the [[Czartoryski family]]'s reformist [[Familia]] party and enforced by the Russian military forces (Familia's main opponents were silenced), whom the Czartoryskis' invited.<ref name="Gierowski 60-63"/> The [[confederated sejm|confederated]] Convocation Sejm passed a number of reform measures, including the weakening of ''[[liberum veto]]'', made no longer applicable to treasury and economic matters including taxation.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-157"/><ref name="Gierowski 60-63"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-158"/> A more comprehensive reform package was presented by [[Andrzej Zamoyski]], however opposition from the Prussian, Russian and Polish nobility (''[[szlachta]]'') thwarted the more ambitious projects, including the adoption of majority voting in all instances.<ref name="Gierowski 60-63"/> Poniatowski's political position was rather weak from the beginning; his election was in reality imposited by Empress [[Catherine the Great]]. He proceeded with cautious reforms such as the establishment of fiscal and military ministries and the introduction of a national customs [[tariff]], which soon had to be abandoned because of the opposition from [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II the Great]] of Prussia.<ref name="Gierowski 60-63"/> These measures had already been authorized by the Convocation Sejm, as additional Familia and King inspired legislative and executive improvements continued to be adopted and implemented during and after the Coronation Sejm of 1764.<ref name="Gierowski 60-63"/> 

[[File:RNieustaj<U+0105>ca.jpg|thumb|left|275px|From his election, King [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August Poniatowski]] worked to develop an [[executive (government)|executive government council]]. In 1775 the [[Partition Sejm]] established a [[Permanent Council]], after [[Russian Empire|Russia]]'s [[Catherine the Great]] concluded it would serve her purposes.<ref name="Gierowski 62-63, 72-73"/>]]

The idea of reforming the Commonwealth was  viewed with suspicion not only by its magnates but also by neighboring countries, which had been content with the deterioration of the Commonwealth's affairs and abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders.<ref name=JPL/> With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16,000, it was easy for its neighbors to intervene directly (the [[Imperial Russian Army]] numbered 300,000; the [[Prussian Army]] and [[Imperial Austrian Army]], 200,000).<ref name="Bauer1991"/>

Russia's Empress Catherine and Prussia's King Frederick II provoked a conflict between members of the Sejm and the King over [[civil rights]] for [[religious minorities]] (Protestant and [[Greek Orthodox]], whose position, guaranteed as equal with the Catholic majority by the [[Warsaw Confederation]] of 1573, had worsened considerably)<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-158"/><ref name="Gierowski 64"/><ref name="Hugh Seton-Watson"/><ref name="RB"/> Catherine and Frederick declared their support for the ''szlachta'' and their "liberties," and by October 1767 Russian troops had assembled outside [[Warsaw]] in support of the conservative [[Radom Confederation]].<ref name="Hugh Seton-Watson"/><ref name="RB"/><ref name="Sanford"/> In face of the superior Russian military force, the King and his adherents were left with little choice but to acquiesce to Russian demands. During the [[Repnin Sejm]] (named after the unofficially presiding Russian ambassador [[Nicholas Repnin]]) the King accepted the five "eternal and invariable principles" which Catherine had vowed to "protect for all time to come in the name of Poland's liberties": the [[Royal elections in Poland|election of kings]]; the right of ''[[liberum veto]]''; the right to renounce allegiance to, and raise rebellion against, the king (''[[rokosz]]''); the ''szlachta'''s exclusive right to hold office and land; and a landowner's power over his peasants,<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-158"/><ref name=JPL/><ref name="Hugh Seton-Watson"/><ref name="RB"/> except that the right to apply the death penalty against serf laborers was in this legislation taken away from their ''szlachta'' overlords.<ref name="Gierowski 65"/> Thus all the privileges of the nobility that had made the Commonwealth's [[political system]] ("[[Golden Liberty]]") ungovernable were guaranteed as unalterable in the ''[[Cardinal Laws]]''.<ref name="Hugh Seton-Watson"/><ref name="RB"/><ref name="Sanford"/> The Cardinal Laws and the rights of "religious dissenters" passed by Repnin Sejm were personally guaranteed by Empress Catherine, which made it the earliest case of Russia's formal involvement in constitutional foundations of the Commonwealth.<ref name="Gierowski 65"/> During the 1768 Sejm, Repnin showed his disregard for local resistance by arranging the abduction and imprisonment -until 1773- of several vocal opponents of the recently proclaimed politics (including religious toleration) and foreign domination: [[Kajetan So<U+0142>tyk]], [[J<U+00F3>zef A. Za<U+0142>uski]], [[Wac<U+0142>aw Rzewuski]] and [[Seweryn Rzewuski]].<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-159"/> The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had thus become, legally and practically, a [[protectorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name="JezierskiLeszczy<U+0144>ska2003"/> Nonetheless, several minor beneficial reforms were adopted, political rights of the religious minorities were restored, and the need for more reforms was becoming increasingly recognized.<ref name="RB"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-159"/>

[[File:The Vote upon theConstitution of May 3, 1791.PNG|thumb|240px|In 1791 the "Great" [[Four-Year Sejm|(Four-Year) Sejm]] (1788<U+2013>92) and Senate adopted the May 3 Constitution at Warsaw's [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]]]]
Not everyone in the Commonwealth agreed with King Stanis<U+0142>aw August's acquiescence to the Russian intervention. On February 29, 1768, several magnates, including [[J<U+00F3>zef Pu<U+0142>aski]] and his young son, [[Kazimierz Pu<U+0142>aski]] (Casimir Pulaski), vowing to oppose Russian influence, declared Stanis<U+0142>aw August a lackey of Russia and Catherine and formed a [[confederation]] at the town of [[Bar, Ukraine|Bar]].<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-159"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-160"/><ref name="CollinsNolte1995"/> The [[Bar Confederation]], despite it patriotic focus on limiting the influence of foreigners in the Commonwealth affairs, was also rather conservative, and restrictive with regards to religious tolerance.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-160"/> A civil war began in Poland, waged by the Confederation with the goal of overthrowing the King and fought on until 1772, when the uprising was overwhelmed by Russian intervention.<ref name=JPL/>

The Bar Confederation's defeat set the scene for the next act in the unfolding drama.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-160"/> On August 5, 1772, at [[Saint Petersburg]], the three neighboring powers <U+2013> Russia, Prussia and Austria <U+2013> signed the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition treaty]]. The Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth was to be divested of about a third of its territory and population (over {{convert|200000|km<U+00B2>|0|abbr=on}} and 4 million people).<ref name=Luk9699/> This was justified on grounds of "anarchy" in the Commonwealth and refusal to cooperate with its neighbors' efforts to restore order.<ref name=conquest/> The three powers demanded that the Sejm ratify this first partition, otherwise threatening further partitions. King Stanis<U+0142>aw August yielded under duress and on April 19, 1773, called the Sejm into session. Only 102 deputies attended what became known as the [[Partition Sejm]]; the rest, aware of the King's decision, refused. Despite protests, notably by the deputy [[Tadeusz Rejtan]], the First Partition of Poland was ratified.<ref name=Luk9699/>

The first of the three successive 18th-century [[partitions of Poland|partitions of Commonwealth territory]] that would eventually remove Poland's sovereignty shocked the inhabitants of the Commonwealth, and had made it clear to progressive minds that the Commonwealth must either reform or perish.<ref name=Luk9699/> In the last three decades preceding the May 3, 1791 Constitution, there was a rising interest among progressive thinkers in [[constitutional reform]].<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-164-165"/> Even before the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition]], a Polish noble, [[Micha<U+0142> Wielhorski (1730-1814)|Micha<U+0142> Wielhorski]], an envoy of the Bar Confederation, had been sent to ask the French ''[[philosophe]]s'' [[Gabriel Bonnot de Mably]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] to offer suggestions on a new constitution for a new Poland.<ref name="Williams2007"/><ref name="RomanielloLipp2011"/><ref name="Lukowski2010"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-166-167"/> Mably had submitted his recommendations (''[[The Government and Laws of Poland]]''<!--Du gouvernement et des lois en Pologne-->) in 1770<U+2013>1771; Rousseau had finished his ''[[Considerations on the Government of Poland]]'' in 1772, when the First Partition was already underway.<ref name="Cranston"/> Notable works advocating the need to reform and presenting specific solutions were published in the Commonwealth itself by Polish-Lithuanian thinkers such as [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Konarski]] (''[[On an Effective Way of Councils or on the Conduct of Ordinary Sejms]]'', 1761<U+2013>1763), founder of the [[Collegium Nobilium (Warsaw)|Collegium Nobilium]]; [[J<U+00F3>zef Wybicki]] (''[[Political Thoughts on Civil Liberties]]'', 1775, ''[[Patriotic Letters]]'', 1778-1778), composer of the [[Polish National Anthem]]; [[Hugo Ko<U+0142><U+0142><U+0105>taj]] (''[[Anonymous Letters to Stanis<U+0142>aw Ma<U+0142>achowski]]'', 1788<U+2013>1789, ''[[The Political Law of the Polish Nation]]'', 1790), head of the [[Ko<U+0142><U+0142><U+0105>taj's Forge]] party; and [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Staszic]] (''[[Remarks on the Life of Jan Zamoyski]]'', 1787).<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-166-167"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-169-171"/> Also seen as crucial to giving the Constitution moral and political support were [[Ignacy Krasicki]]'s satires of the [[Great Sejm]] era.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-179"/>

Supported by more progressive magnates such as the [[Czartoryski family]] and King Stanis<U+0142>aw August, a new wave of reforms were introduced at the [[Partition Sejm]].<ref name="Sanford"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-162-163"/><ref name="Stone2001-274"/> The most important included the 1773 establishment of a ''[[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]]'' ("[[Commission of National Education]]") <U+2013> the first ministry of education in the world.<ref name=Luk9699/><ref name="Stone2001-274"/><ref name=dp/><ref name=nd167/> Subsequently new schools were opened in the cities and in the countryside, uniform textbooks were printed, teachers received better education, and poor students were provided scholarships.<ref name=Luk9699/><ref name="Stone2001-274"/> The Commonwealth's military was being modernized, and a larger standing army was to be provided for.<ref name="Gierowski 73"/> Economic and commercial reforms, including some intended to cover the increased military budget, previously shunned as unimportant by the [[szlachta]], were introduced.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-162-163"/><ref name="Stone2001-274"/><ref name="Gierowski 73"/> Finally, a new executive body was created, the 36-strong [[Permanent Council]], comprising five ministries with limited legislative powers, giving the Commonwealth a new governing body, in constant session between the Sejms and therefore immune to their liberum veto disruptions.<ref name="Sanford"/><ref name=Luk9699/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-162-163"/><ref name="Stone2001-274"/>

In 1776 the Sejm commissioned former chancellor [[Andrzej Zamoyski]] to draft a new [[legal code]].<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-164-165"/> By 1780 the [[Zamoyski Code]] (''Zbi<U+00F3>r praw s<U+0105>dowych'') had been produced by him and his collaborators. It would have strengthened royal power, made all officials answerable to the Sejm, placed the clergy and their finances under state supervision, and deprived landless ''[[szlachta]]'' of many of their legal immunities. The Code would also have improved the situation of non-nobles <U+2014> townspeople and peasants.<ref name="Gierowski 74-75"/> Zamoyski's progressive legal code, containing elements of constitutional reform, met with opposition from native conservative ''szlachta'' and foreign powers and failed of adoption by the 1780 Sejm.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-164-165"/><ref name="Gierowski 74-75"/><ref name=butt/>

The Sejm's first two years saw the passage of few major reforms; it was the subsequent two years that brought major changes.<ref name=bardach304-305/> The Sejm first adopted several lesser reforms, notably the 1791 [[Free Royal Cities Act]] addressing the cities, burgher rights, and voting rights, which was incorporated as a formal constituent of the final constitution.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-173-174"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-178"/> While the Sejm comprised representatives only of the [[szlachta|nobility]] and clergy, the reformers were supported by the [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] (townspeople), who in the fall of 1789 organized a "[[Black Procession]]" demanding the full political enfranchisement of the [[bourgeoisie]].<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-172-173"/> On April 18, 1791, the Sejm <U+2014> fearing that the burghers' protests, if ignored, could turn violent as they had in France not long before <U+2014> adopted the Free Royal Cities Act.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-175"/>

=== War in Defense of the Constitution ===
{{main|Polish<U+2013>Russian War of 1792}}

The Constitution remained in effect for little over a year before being overthrown by Russian armies allied with the [[Targowica Confederation]] in the [[Polish<U+2013>Russian War of 1792]], also known as the War in Defense of the Constitution.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-184-185"/> With the wars between [[Russo-Turkish War, 1787-1792|Turkey and Russia]] and [[Gustav III's Russian War|Sweden and Russia]] having by ended, [[Catherine II of Russia|Empress Catherine]] was furious over the adoption of the May 3 Constitution, which she believed threatened Russian influence in Poland.<ref name="BideleuxJeffries1998"/><ref name="Lukowski2010-226"/><ref name="Schroeder"/> Russia had viewed Poland as a ''de facto'' [[protectorate]];<ref name=luza84/> one of Russia's chief foreign policy authors, [[Alexander Bezborodko]], when he learned of the Constitution, said that "the worst possible news have arrived from Warsaw: the Polish king has became almost sovereign."<ref name="Bauer167"/> The contacts of Polish reformers with the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|Revolutionary French National Assembly]] were seen by Poland's neighbors as evidence of a revolutionary [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] and a threat to the absolute monarchies.<ref name="Carter1994"/><ref name="Davies2005-403"/> The Prussian statesman [[Ewald von Hertzberg]] expressed the fears of European conservatives: "[[The Poles]] have given the ''coup de gr<U+00E2>ce'' to the Prussian monarchy by voting a constitution", elaborating that strong Commonwealth would likely demand the return of the lands Prussia acquired in the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition]].<ref name=Bauer167/><ref name=buffaloquote/>

A number of magnates who had opposed the Constitution from the start, such as [[Franciszek Ksawery Branicki]], [[Szymon Marcin Kossakowski|Szymon]] and [[J<U+00F3>zef Kossakowski (colonel)|J<U+00F3>zef Kossakowski]], [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Szcz<U+0119>sny Potocki]] and [[Seweryn Rzewuski]], asked Tsarina Catherine to intervene and restore their privileges (the [[cardinal laws]]) abolished under the Constitution.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-184-185"/> To that end these magnates formed the [[Targowica Confederation]].<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-184-185"/> The Confederation's proclamation, prepared in [[St. Petersburg]] in January 1792, criticized the Constitution for contributing to, in their own words, "contagion of democratic ideas" following "the fatal examples set in Paris".<ref name="Lord1915"/><ref name="Kope<U+010D>ek2006-282-284"/> It asserted that "The parliament... has broken all fundamental laws, swept away all liberties of the gentry and on the third of May 1791 turned into a revolution and a conspiracy."<ref name="Kope<U+010D>ek2006-284-285"/> The confederates declared to overcame this revolution, stating that they "can do nothing but turn trustingly to Tsarina Catherine, a distinguished and fair empress, our neighboring friend and ally", who "respects the nation's need for well-being and always offers it a helping hand."<ref name="Kope<U+010D>ek2006-284-285"/>

Shortly after, the Targowica Confederation was formed by Polish nobility to overthrow the Constitution.<ref name="zamoyski"/> The confederates aligned with Russia's Catherine the Great, and the Russian army entered Poland, starting the [[Polish-Russian War of 1792]], also known as the War in Defense of the Constitution.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-184-185"/> The Sejm voted to increase the army of the Commonwealth to 100,000 men, but due to insufficient time and funds this number was never achieved and soon abandoned even as a goal.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-184-185"/><ref name="Gierowski 78-82"/> The Polish King and the reformers could field only a 37,000-man army, many of them untested recruits.<ref name="bardach317"/> This army, under the command of the King's nephew [[J<U+00F3>zef Poniatowski]] and [[Tadeusz Ko<U+015B>ciuszko]], did defeat or fought to a draw the Russians on several occasions, but in the end, a defeat loomed inevitable.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-184-185"/> Despite Polish requests, Prussia refused to honor its alliance obligations.<ref name="<U+0141>ojek1986-325-326"/>  Stanis<U+0142>aw August's attempts at negotiations with Russia proved futile.<ref name="psb628"/> Eventually, when in July 1792 Warsaw was threatened with siege by the Russians, the King came to believe that victory was impossible against the Russian numerical superiority, and that surrender was the only alternative to total defeat.<ref name="psb628"/> Having received assurances from the Russian ambassador [[Yakov Bulgakov]] that no territorial changes will occur, the [[cabinet of ministers]] called the [[Guardians of the Laws]] (or Guard of the Laws, {{lang-pl|Stra<U+017C> Praw}}) voted 8:4 to surrender.<ref name="psb628"/> On July 24, 1792, King Stanis<U+0142>aw August Poniatowski joined the Targowica Confederation.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-184-185"/> The Polish Army disintegrated. Many reform leaders, believing their cause lost, went into self-exile, although they hoped that Stanis<U+0142>aw August would be able to negotiate an acceptable compromise with the Russians, as he did in the past.<ref name="psb628"/> The King had not saved the Commonwealth, though. To the surprise of the Targowica Confederates, the [[Partitions of Poland#Second Partition|Second Partition of Poland]] ensued.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-184-185"/><ref name="Kope<U+010D>ek2006-282-284"/> With new deputies bribed or intimidated by the Russian troops, the infamous [[Grodno Sejm]] took place.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-184-185"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-186-187"/> On 23 November 1793, it concluded its deliberations, annulling the Constitution and acceding to the Second Partition.<ref name="Davies2005-254"/><ref name="Pickus2001"/> Russia took {{convert|250000|km2|sqmi}}, and Prussia took {{convert|58000|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-186-187"/> The Commonwealth now comprised no more than {{convert|215000|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name="Frucht2005"/> What was left of the Commonwealth was merely a small [[buffer state]] with a puppet king, and Russian garrisons keeping an eye on the reduced Polish army.<ref name="Frucht2005"/><ref name="OlsonCloud2003"/><ref name="Reddaway1971"/><ref name="AgnewBidwell1851"/>

For a year and a half, Polish patriots bided their time while planning an insurrection.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-186-187"/> On March 24, 1794, in Krak<U+00F3>w, Tadeusz Ko<U+015B>ciuszko declared what has come to be known as the [[Ko<U+015B>ciuszko Uprising]].<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-186-187"/> On May 7 he issued the [[Proclamation of Po<U+0142>aniec]] (''Uniwersa<U+0142> Po<U+0142>aniecki''), granting freedom to the peasants and ownership of land to all who fought in the insurrection.

The Polish constitution was one of several to reflect [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] influences, in particular [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu's]] advocacy of a [[separation of powers|separation and balance of powers]] between the three branches of government and his advocacy of a [[bicameral]] legislature.<ref name="Sanford"/><ref name="Constitutions2"/><ref name="bardach318"/> Once the government was established, it aimed to ensure, in accordance with the Constitution's article V, that "the integrity of the states, civil liberty, and social order shall always remain in equilibrium".<ref name="Sanford"/><ref name="Constitutions2"/><ref name=bardach318/> According to [[Jacek J<U+0119>druch]], the constitution, in its liberality of provisions, "fell somewhere below the [[French Constitution of 1791|French]], above the [[Constitutional Act of 1791|Canadian]], and left the [[Prussian General Code of Law|Prussian]] far behind", but did not equal the [[Constitution of the United States|American Constitution]]".<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-178"/> Poniatowski described the May 3 Constitution as "founded principally on those of England and the United States of America, but avoiding the faults and errors of both, and adapted as much as possible to the local and particular circumstances of the country."<ref name="Constitutions1"/> [[George Sanford (political scientist)|George Sanford]] notes that the May Constitution gave Poland "a [[constitutional monarchy]] close to the English model of the time."<ref name="Sanford"/>

The Constitution contains a [[preamble]] and 11 individual articles.<ref name="Sanford"/> It introduced the principle of [[popular sovereignty]] (applied to the nobility and townspeople) and a [[separation of powers]] into [[legislative]] (a [[bicameral]] [[Sejm]]), executive ("the King and the Guardians", the [[Guardians of the Laws]] being the newly established top governmental entity)<ref name="Grodziski 114"/> and [[judicial]] branches.<ref name="Constitutions2"/>

The Constitution advanced the democratization of the [[polity]] by limiting the excessive [[immunity from prosecution|legal immunities]] and political prerogatives of landless nobility.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-175"/><ref name="Constitutions3"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-181-182"/><ref name="Lukowski2010-227"/> Also by granting to the townspeople in the earlier [[Free Royal Cities Act]] (''Miasta Nasze Kr<U+00F3>lewskie Wolne w Pa<U+0144>stwach Rzeczypospolitej'') of April 18 (or 21), 1791, stipulated in Article III to be integral to the Constitution, personal security (''[[neminem captivabimus]]''), the right to acquire [[landed property]], and eligibility for offices, including [[Officer (armed forces)|military officers' commissions]] and [[public office]]s, such as reserved seats in the Sejm itself and in the executive commissions of the Treasury, the Police and the Judiciary.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-175"/><ref name="Constitutions3"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-181-182"/><ref name="Lukowski2010-227"/> Membership in the nobility ([[szlachta]]) was made easier for burghers to acquire.<ref name="Gierowski 83"/>

''Prawo o sejmikach'', the act on regional assemblies ([[sejmik]]s), passed earlier on March 24, 1791 (article VI), was similarly recognized.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-178"/><ref name="Constitutions6"/> This law introduced major changes to the electoral ordinance, as it reduced the enfranchisement of the noble class.<ref name="Sanford"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-173-174"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-177"/><ref name="Roszkowski1991"/><ref name="Scott1995"/> Previously, all nobles had been eligible to vote in the sejmiks (local parliaments), which ''de facto'' meant that many of the poorest, landless nobles (known as "clients" or "clientele" of local magnates) voted as the magnates bade them.<ref name="Sanford"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-173-174"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-177"/><ref name="Roszkowski1991"/><ref name="Scott1995"/> Now the voting right was tied to a property qualification (one had to own or lease land and pay taxes, or be closely related to such a person, to be eligible to vote).<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-178"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-174"/> Active voting rights were also taken from nobles who held property granted them by magnates or the king, to remove the temptation to vote so as to please their benefactors.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-173-174"/> Some 300,000 of 700,000 otherwise eligible nobles were thus disfranchised, much to their displeasure.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-173-174"/> Voting rights were also restored to landowners who were in military service (rights that they had lost in 1775).<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-173-174"/> A common practice at that time, voting was limited to males of at least 18 years of age.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-181-182"/> The eligible voters would elect deputies to local (county, Polish: ''[[powiat]]'') sejmiks, which elected deputies to the General Sejm.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-181-182"/>

With half the nobility disfranchised and some half million burghers in the Commonwealth now substantially enfranchised, the Great Sejm's early acts did much to increase equality in the distribution of political power, although the situation of the politically less conscious and active classes, notably the [[Polish Jews|Jews]] and peasants, still waited to be addressed.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-176"/><ref name="Lukowski2010-227"/>{{Ref label|c|c|none}} While the Government Act also placed the Commonwealth's peasantry "under the protection of the national law and government" <U+2013> a first step toward ending [[serfdom]] and enfranchising the country's largest and most oppressed social class <U+2013>  the peasant question was far from resolved, as serfdom remained in force.<ref name="Sanford"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-176"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-181-182"/><ref name="Lukowski2010-227"/>{{Ref label|c|c|none}} It would take the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition]] and [[Tadeusz Ko<U+015B>ciuszko]]'s [[Proclamation of Po<U+0142>aniec]] to move the matter forward.<ref name="Grodziski 157"/>

To enhance the Commonwealth's integration and security, the Constitution moved to abolish the erstwhile [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Union|union of Poland and Lithuania]] in favor of a more [[unitary state]].<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-179"/><ref name=bardach309/> Its full establishment, supported by Poniatowski and Ko<U+0142>l<U+0105>taj, was opposed by many Lithuanian deputies, and as a compromise, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania received numerous privileges guaranteeing its continued existence.<ref name=bardach309/> Related acts included the ''"Deklaracja Stan<U+00F3>w Zgromadzonych'' (Declaration of the Assembled Estates) of May 5, 1791, confirming the Government Act adopted two days earlier, and the ''Zar<U+0119>czenie Wzajemne Obojga Narod<U+00F3>w'' ([[Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations]], i.e., of the [[Crown of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]) of October 22, 1791, affirming the unity and indivisibility of Poland and the Grand Duchy within a single state, and their equal representation in state-governing bodies.<ref name="Constitutions1"/><ref name=Kowecki/> The Reciprocal Guarantee strengthened the Polish-Lithuanian union, while keeping many [[Federation|federal]] aspects of the state intact.<ref name="bardach309"/><ref name=mkw/> The document, like the Constitution itself, was translated into [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]].<ref name="Lietuvos TSR istorija"/>

{{Constitutions of Poland}}
The Constitution abolished several institutional sources of government weakness and national anarchy, including the ''[[liberum veto]]'' (replaced by a [[simple majority vote]]), [[confederation]]s and [[confederated sejm]]s (paradoxically, the [[Great Sejm]] was itself a confederated sejm), and the excessive sway of [[sejmik]]s (regional sejms) stemming from the previously binding nature of their instructions to their Sejm deputies.<ref name="Sanford"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-178"/> The confederations were declared "contrary to the spirit of this Constitution, subversive of government and destructive of society".<ref name="Lukowski2010-229"/> Thus it strengthened the powers of the parliament (Sejm) proper, moving the country closer towards a [[constitutional monarchy]].<ref name="Sanford"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-178"/> The constitution also changed the government from an [[elective monarchy|elective]] (in its [[royal elections in Poland|unique Polish variant]]) to [[hereditary monarchy]].<ref name="Sanford"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-178"/><ref name="Constitutions5"/> The latter provision was meant to reduce the destructive vying influences of foreign powers at each royal election.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-180"/>{{Ref label|d|d|none}} The [[royal dynasty]] itself was elective, however, and if it were to die out, a new one would be chosen by "the Nation".<ref name="Lukowski2010-229"/> In the period when [[regent|regency]] was needed, the royal council would take that responsibility (as covered by Article IX).<ref name="Lukowski2010-231"/> The king held the throne "by the grace of God and the will of the Nation", and "all authority derives from the will of the Nation."<ref name="Sanford"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-181-182"/> The institution of [[pacta conventa]] was preserved.<ref name="Lukowski2010-230"/> On Stanis<U+0142>aw August's death the Polish throne would become hereditary and pass to [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]], of the [[House of Wettin]], which had provided Poland's two most recent elective kings before Stanis<U+0142>aw August (Frederick Augustus' daughter, [[Maria Augusta Nepomucena]], was called the [[Infanta]] of Poland).<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-178"/><ref name="Lukowski2010-230"/> This provision was contingent upon Frederic Augustus' consent, and he in fact declined the offer presented to him by [[Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski|Adam Czartoryski]].<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-178"/> In 1807, however, [[Napoleon]] convinced Frederic Augustus to become the king of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] established by the [[Napoleon|French Emperor]].<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-179"/>

[[Judiciary]] was discussed in Article VIII, and separated from the two other branches of the government,<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-181-182"/><ref name="Lukowski2010-230"/> to be served by elective judges.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-181-182"/> [[trial court|Courts of first instance]] existed in each voivodeship, and were in constant session.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-181-182"/> Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed [[Crown Tribunal]] and [[Lithuanian Tribunal]].<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-181-182"/> The Sejm also elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm court (a precursor for the modern [[State Tribunal of the Republic of Poland|State Tribunal]] of Poland).<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-181-182"/><ref name="Lukowski2010-230"/> [[Referendary court]]s of each province were to hear the cases of peasantry.<ref name="Lukowski2010-230"/> Municipal courts, described in the law on the towns, complemented this system.<ref name="Lukowski2010-230"/>

Article I acknowledged the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic faith]] as the "dominant religion", but guaranteed tolerance and [[Freedom of religion|freedom to all religions]].<ref name="Sanford"/><ref name="Lukowski2010-226"/> Article II confirmed many old privileges of the nobility, stressing that all nobles are equal, and should enjoy personal security and the right to property.<ref name="Lukowski2010-227"/> The Army was to be built up to 100,000 men.<ref name=jb/> The constitution also provided additional levies on the nobility and clergy.<ref name=fbs/>

The May 3 Constitution remained to the last a work in progress. The provisions of the Government Act were fleshed out in a number of laws passed in May<U+2013>June 1791: on [[sejm court]]s (two acts of May 13), the Guardians of the Laws (June 1), the national police ''commission'' (a ministry, June 17) and municipal administration (June 24). The Constitution included provisions for [[Constitutional amendment|its own revision]], to be handled by an extraordinary Sejm held every 25 years.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-178"/><ref name="Lukowski2010-228"/> The Constitution's co-author [[Hugo Ko<U+0142><U+0142><U+0105>taj]] announced that work was underway on "an economic constitution<U+2026>guaranteeing all [[property rights|rights of property]] [and] securing protection and honor to all manner of labor<U+2026>". Yet a third planned basic law was mentioned by Ko<U+0142><U+0142><U+0105>taj: a "moral constitution," most likely a Polish analog to the American [[Bill of Rights]] and the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]].<ref name="Constitutions7"/> A new [[civil code|civil]] and [[criminal code]] (tentatively called the [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August Code]]) was in the works.<ref name="Lukowski2010-231"/><ref name="psb627"/> The King also planned a reform improving the situation of [[Polish Jews]].<ref name="psb627"/>

The Constitution was a [[milestone]] in both [[legal history|legal]] the [[history of democracy|democratic]] history.<ref name=nd/><ref name="Markoff"/> It was the first constitution to follow the 1788 ratification of the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name="Markoff"/><ref name=ik/> Poland and the United States, though geographically distant, displayed some notable similarities in their approaches to the design of political systems.<ref name="Markoff"/> [[Edmund Burke]] described it as "the noblest benefit received by any nation at any time...

The Constitution's official name was ''Ustawa Rz<U+0105>dowa'' ("Government Act"), where "government" meant the political system.<ref name=bardach304-305/> In the Commonwealth, the term "constitution" (Polish: ''konstytucja'') had denoted all the legislation, of whatever character, that had been passed at a Sejm.<ref name="Kowalski2009"/>

=== Holiday ===
[[File:Medal commemorating Constitution of May 3, 1791.png|thumb|125px|Medal commemorating the Constitution of May 3, 1791, issued that year]]

May 3 was declared an official Polish  holiday (Constitution Day <U+2013> ''<U+015A>wi<U+0119>to Konstytucji 3 Maja'') on May 5, 1791.<ref name=rsuw/> Although it was banned during the [[partitions of Poland]], it was reinstated in April 1919 under the [[Second Polish Republic]] <U+2013> the first holiday officially introduced in the newly independent country.<ref name=RKLJ/><ref name=rsuw/><ref name=ipo/> The holiday was again dislawed during World War II by both the Nazi and Soviet occupiers.

== Notes ==
'''a''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} The claims of "first" and "second constitution" have been disputed, particularly as different scholars define the word constitution differently. Both the U.S. and Polish constitutions were preceded by earlier ones, including some also termed constitutions, for example, the [[Corsican Constitution]] of 1755.<ref name=dd/> See [[history of the constitution]].

'''b''' {{Note label|b|b|none}} Machnikowski uses the word Fatherland.<ref name="Machnikowski2010"/> [[:wikisource:Constitution of May 3, 1791|The English translation of the Constitution of May 3, 1791, by Christopher Kasparek]], reproduced in [[Wikisource]], renders "''ojczyzna''" as "country" (the usual English-language [[Translation#Equivalence|equivalent]]), e.g., at the end of section II, [[:wikisource:Constitution of May 3, 1791#II. The Landed Nobility|"The Landed Nobility"]]. The English [[cognate]] of the Polish "''ojczyzna''" is "[[fatherland]]" <U+2013> both words are [[calque]]s of the [[Latin]] "''patria''," itself derived from "''pater''" ("father").

'''c''' {{Note label|c|c|none}} The contemporaneous [[United States Constitution]] sanctioned the continuation of [[slavery]]. Thus neither of the two constitutions enfranchised all its adult male population: the U.S. Constitution excluded America's slaves; the Polish Constitution <U+2013> Poland's peasants.

'''d''' {{Note label|d|d|none}} King [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August]] himself had been elected in 1764 thanks to the significant support of his ex-[[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], Russian [[Tsar]]ina [[Catherine the Great]].<ref name="psb616"/> The Russians spend about 2.5m [[ruble]]s supporting his election, Poniatowski's supporters and opponents engaged in some military posturing and even minor clashes, and in the end, the Russian army was deployed only a few miles from the [[election sejm]], which met at [[Wola]] near Warsaw.<ref name="Davies2005-390"/><ref name="Szyndler2009"/>
