The '''Mistle Thrush''' (''Turdus viscivorus'') is a bird common to much of Europe, Asia and North Africa. It is a year-round resident in much of its range, but northern and eastern populations [[bird migration|migrate]] south for the winter, often in small flocks. It is a large [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] with pale grey-brown upperparts, a greyish-white chin and throat, and black spots on its pale yellow and off-white underparts. The sexes are similar in [[plumage]], and the three [[subspecies]] show only minimal differences. The male has a loud, far-carrying song which is delivered even in wet and windy weather, earning the bird the old name of "stormcock".

Found in open woods, parks, hedges and cultivated land, the Mistle Thrush feeds on a wide variety of [[invertebrate]]s, seeds and berries. Its preferred fruits including those of the [[viscum album|mistletoe]], [[holly]] and [[yew]]. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, and this is reflected in the thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a [[parasitism|parasitic]] species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can [[germination|germinate]]. In winter, a Mistle Thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.

The open cup nest is built against a trunk or in a forked branch, and is fearlessly defended against potential predators, sometimes including humans or cats. The [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]], typically of three to five eggs, is [[Egg incubation|incubated]] for 12<U+2013>15&nbsp;days, mainly by the female. The chicks [[fledge]] about 14<U+2013>16&nbsp;days after hatching. There are normally two broods. There was a large range expansion in the 18th and early 19th centuries, although there has been a small decline in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in agricultural practices. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is classified by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] as being of [[Least Concern]].

==Taxonomy==
The Mistle Thrush was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema naturae]]'' in 1758 under its current scientific name.<ref name = Linn>Linnaeus (1758) p. 168.</ref><ref name = hbwonline>{{cite web| author = Hoyo, Josep del; Elliott, Andrew; Sargatal, Jordi; Christie, David A (eds.)| title=Mistle Thrush | work= Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive | url=http://www.hbw.com/species/mistle-thrush-turdus-viscivorus | publisher= Lynx Edicions | accessdate = 10 September 2013| archiveurl= | archivedate= | deadurl = no }} Subscription required.</ref> The bird's liking for [[viscum album|mistletoe]] berries is indicated by both its English and [[binomial nomenclature|scientific names]].

There are more than 60 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus ''Turdus'', characterised by rounded heads, longish pointed wings, and usually melodious songs.<ref name=Clement36>Clement ''et al.''

At least eight [[subspecies]] have been proposed, but the differences are mainly [[cline (biology)|clinal]], with birds of the [[Subspecies#Nominotypical_subspecies and subspecies autonyms|nominate subspecies]] becoming paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range. The currently accepted subspecies are:<ref name=Clement397>Clement ''et al.'' (2000) pp. 397<U+2013>491.</ref>

==Description==
[[File:Turdus_viscivorus_in_Baikonur-town_003.jpg|thumb|In [[Kazakhstan]]]]
The Mistle Thrush is the largest thrush native to Europe. The nominate subspecies measures 27<U+2013>28&nbsp;cm (10.6<U+2013>11&nbsp;in) in length,<ref name=Clement397/> with a {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} wingspan.<ref name = bto/> It weighs {{convert|93|to|167|g|oz|abbr=on}},<ref name = hbwonline/> with an average of around {{convert|130|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name = bto/> It has a stocky upright posture when on the ground. It has pale grey-brown upperparts, the chin and throat are greyish-white, and the yellowish-buff breast and off-white belly are marked with round black spots. The spotting becomes denser on the lower chest, giving the appearance of a breast-band. The long tail has white tips on the outer feathers, and the underwing [[Covert feather|coverts]] are white. The eyes are dark brown and the bill is blackish with a yellowish base to the lower [[mandible]]. The legs and feet are yellowish-brown. There are no plumage differences between the sexes. Juveniles are similar to adults, but they have paler upperparts with creamy centres to many of the feathers and smaller spots on the yellowish underparts. By their first winter they are very similar to adults, but the underparts are usually more buff-toned.<ref name=Clement397/>

The eastern subspecies ''T. v. bonapartei'' is 30&nbsp;cm (11.8&nbsp;in) in length, and therefore slightly larger than the nominate form. It is paler grey above and whiter below, with fewer black spots. Birds of intermediate appearance are seen west of the [[Ob River]] where the range overlaps with ''viscivorus''. The southern race ''T. v. deichleri'' resembles ''bonapartei'' in appearance, but is closer in size to the nominate ''viscivorus'', although it has a more slender bill.<ref name=Clement397/>

Adults have a full [[moulting|moult]] after breeding, beginning between late May and the end of June, and completed by early October. Juvenile birds have a partial moult, replacing their head, body, and covert feathers; this is completed by October, although the start of the moult depends on when the chicks hatched.<ref name=Clement397/>

The Mistle Thrush is much larger, paler and longer-tailed than the [[sympatry|sympatric]] Song Thrush. In the western Himalayas it could be confused with both the [[Plain-backed Thrush|Plain-backed]] and the [[Long-tailed Thrush]]es. These are similar to the Mistle Thrush, but the Plain<U+2013>backed Thrush lacks obvious wing bars, is more [[rufous]] above than its relative, and is barred rather than spotted below. The Long-tailed Thrush has olive-toned upperparts, bars on its breast and two wing bars. Juvenile Mistle Thrushes are superficially similar to [[White's Thrush]], but that species has golden-yellow plumage, scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern.<ref name=Clement397/>

===Voice===
The male Mistle Thrush has a loud melodious song with fluted whistles, sounding like ''chewee-trewuu&nbsp;... trureetruuruu'' or similar, repeated three to six times,<ref name=Clement397/> and used to advertise his territory, attract a mate and maintain the pair bond.<ref name=Clement41>Clement ''et al.'' (2000) p. 41.</ref> The tone resembles that of the Song Thrush or Blackbird, but compared to its relatives the Mistle Thrush's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower. The song is, however, much louder, often audible up to 2&nbsp;km (2,000&nbsp;yd) away. The song is given from a treetop or other elevated position mainly from November to early June. The male is most vocal in the early morning, and its tendency to sing after, and sometimes during, wet and windy weather led to the old name "stormcock".<ref name=Clement397/><ref name=BWP/> The song may be heard in any month, although it is uncommon from July to August while the thrush is moulting.<ref name= Coward/> The main call, given by both sexes, is a dry chattering ''krrrr'', louder when it is alarmed or excited.<ref name=Clement397/><ref name=BWP/> It is often likened to the sound of a football rattle, a form of [[ratchet (instrument)|musical ratchet]].<ref name = btothrushes>{{cite web| author = | title= Song Thrush/Mistle Thrush| work= A BTO Garden BirdWatch factsheet| url= http://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/u23/downloads/pdfs/thrushes_01_2012_low_res.pdf| publisher=British Trust for Ornithology (BTO)| accessdate =18 August 2013 | archiveurl= | archivedate= | deadurl = no }}</ref> There is also a squeaky ''tuk'' contact call.<ref name = hbwonline/>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Turdus viscivorus -Longbridge, Birmingham, England -parent and chicks-8 (2).jpg|thumb|An adult (right) with two juveniles feeding on a lawn]]
The Mistle Thrush breeds in much of Europe and temperate Asia, although it is absent from the treeless far north, and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast Europe, Turkey and the Middle East. In these warmer southern areas, it tends to be found in the milder uplands and coastal regions. Nominate ''T. v. viscivorus'' breeds in Europe and in Asia east to the Ob, beyond which it is replaced by ''T. v. bonapartei''. The southern form ''T. v. deichleri'' is resident in North Africa, [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]].<ref name=Clement397/>

The Mistle Thrush is a partial [[bird migration|migrant]]: birds from the north and east of the range wintering in the milder areas of Europe and North Africa. Scandinavian and Russian birds start moving south from mid-September onwards, most birds wintering in Europe, western Turkey and the [[Middle East]]. Between mid-October and November, large numbers cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and others pass through Cyprus, but there is hardly any migration across the [[North Sea]]. Breeding birds in the British Isles and north-west Europe are resident or move only short distances. In the Himalayas, the breeding population moves to nearby lower-altitude sites in winter. Return migration starts mainly from late March, although it can be a month earlier in the Middle East, and northern breeders may not arrive back on their territories until late April or early May. Migration may be by day or night, and typically involves individuals or small groups.<ref name=Clement397/> Vagrant birds have occurred in the [[Azores]], China, [[Crete]], [[Faroe Islands]], Iceland, Japan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, [[Sikkim]] and the United Arab Emirates.<ref name=IUCN2012/><ref name=Clement397/>

The Mistle Thrush is found in a wide range of habitats containing trees, including forests, plantations, hedges and town parks. In the south and east of its range, it inhabits upland [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] woodland and the range extends above the main [[tree line]] where dwarf [[Juniperus communis|juniper]] is present. Breeding occurs at up to 600&nbsp;m (1,980&nbsp;ft) in the mountains of North Africa, and occasionally much higher, to 1,700&nbsp;m (5,600&nbsp;ft).<ref name=Clement397/> In the highlands of Europe, its preferred altitude is from 800<U+2013>1,800&nbsp;m (2,600<U+2013>5,900&nbsp;ft).<ref name=BWP>Snow & Perrins (1998) pp. 1230<U+2013>1234.</ref> More open habitats, such as agricultural land, moors and grassy hills, are extensively used in winter or on migration.<ref name=Clement397/>

There is evidence that this species has changed its natural habitat in at least parts of its range. In Germany and elsewhere in central Europe, it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded, first into farmland, and then to suburbs and urban parks. The reasons for this expansion are unclear.<ref name= fuller>Fuller (2003) p. 28.</ref> In areas of [[intensive farming]], such as eastern England, [[arable land]] has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats.<ref name= Mason>{{cite journal |last= Mason |first= Christopher F |year= 2000|title=Thrushes now largely restricted to the built environment in eastern England | journal= Diversity and Distributions | volume=6 | pages=189<U+2013>194 | url = |doi=10.1046/j.1472-4642.2000.00084.x|jstor=2673424 |issue=4}}</ref>

==Behaviour==

Mistle Thrushes are found as individuals or pairs for much of the year, although families forage together in late summer,<ref name=Clement397/> and groups may merge to form flocks of several tens of birds;<ref name= brown/> it is not uncommon for up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year. They roost at night in trees or bushes, again typically as individuals or pairs, but with families roosting together in autumn.<ref name=Clement397/>

The Mistle Thrush is quite terrestrial, hopping with its head held up and body erect; when excited, it will flick its wings and tail. The flight consists of undulating bounds interspersed with glides.<ref name=Clement397/>

===Breeding===

Breeding typically commences in mid-March in the south and west of Europe (late February in Britain), but not till early May in Finland.<ref name= BWP/> The nest is usually built in a tree in the fork of a branch or against the trunk, although hedges, ledges on buildings and cliff faces may also be used. The nest site may be up to 20&nbsp;m (66&nbsp;ft) above the ground, although 2<U+2013>9&nbsp;m (6.5<U+2013>30&nbsp;ft) is more typical. The [[Common Chaffinch]] often nests close to a Mistle Thrush, the vigilance of the [[finch]] and the aggressive behaviour of the thrush benefiting both species. The thrush's nest is a large cup of sticks, dry grass, roots and moss, coated on the inside with a layer of mud and lined with fine grass and leaves. The nest is built by the female, although the male may help.<ref name = hbwonline/><ref name=Clement397/><ref name=BWP/> Nests built early in the breeding season may be destroyed by bad weather.<ref name=Coward/>

The [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is typically three to five eggs (range two to six), which are usually whitish-buff or greenish-blue and are spotted with red, purple or brown.<ref name=BWP/> The average size of the egg is 30&nbsp;x&nbsp;22&nbsp;mm (1.18&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.87&nbsp;in), and weighs 7.8&nbsp;g (0.28&nbsp;oz), of which 6% is shell.<ref name = bto>{{cite web| author = | title= Mistle Thrush ''Turdus viscivorus'' [Linnaeus, 1758]| work= Bird Facts | url=http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob12020.htm | publisher=British Trust for Ornithology (BTO)| accessdate = 20 August 2013| archiveurl= | archivedate= | deadurl = no }}</ref> The eggs are [[incubate (bird)|incubated]] for 12<U+2013>15&nbsp;days, mainly by the female.<ref name=Clement397/> The chicks are [[altricial]] and downy,<ref name = bto/> and are fed by both parents. They [[fledge]] about 14<U+2013>16&nbsp;days after hatching.

===Feeding===
[[File:Viscum album fruit.jpg|thumb|The Mistle Thrush derives its English and scientific names from mistletoe, a favourite food.]]

Mistle Thrushes feed mainly on [[invertebrate]]s, fruit and berries. Animal prey include earthworms, insects and other [[arthropod]]s, slugs and snails.<ref name=Clement397/> Snails are sometimes smashed on a stone "anvil", a technique also used by the Song Thrush.<ref name=Coward/> The Mistle Thrush has been known to kill [[Anguis fragilis|slow worms]] and the young of the Song Thrush, Blackbird and [[Dunnock]].<ref name=Clement397/>

Plant food includes the fruits and seeds of bushes and trees, mainly holly, yew, ivy and mistletoe, but also, for example, blackberry, cherry, elder, hawthorn, olive and rose. It may eat the flowers and shoots of grasses and other plants, and will take fallen apples and plums. It forages within its breeding habitat and in open fields, sometimes sharing these feeding areas with [[Redwing]]s or [[Fieldfare]]s.<ref name=Clement397/>

Young birds are initially mainly fed on invertebrates, often collected from low foliage or under bushes rather than in the grassland preferred by the adults. Adults will roam up to 1&nbsp;km (1000&nbsp;yd) from the nest on pasture or ploughed land. After fledging the young may accompany their parents until the onset of winter.<ref name= brown/> Individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter, mistletoe being preferred where available, with holly as the first choice elsewhere.<ref name= Snow>Snow & Snow (2010) pp. 154<U+2013>156.</ref> Although the thrush normally feeds on the ground or other trees, the defence of this resource conserves the fruit for later in the season when other food items are becoming scarce.<ref name= BWP/> The trees are defended against [[conspecificity|conspecifics]], other thrushes and species such as the [[Bullfinch]] and [[Great Spotted Woodpecker]]. In years when there is an abundance of winter fruit, this strategy may be abandoned, with the Mistle Thrushes foraging in flocks.<ref name= skorka>{{cite journal |last= Sk<U+00F3>rka |first= Piotr |coauthors= W<U+00F3>jcik, Joanna D |year=2005 |title= Population dynamics and social behavior of the Mistle Thrush ''Turdus viscivorus'' during winter | journal= Acta Ornithologica | volume= 40| pages=35<U+2013>42 | url = |doi=10.3161/068.040.0109|jstor= |issue=1}}</ref> Conversely, in hard winters, the defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of Fieldfares, Redwings or [[Bohemian Waxwing]]s.<ref name= Snow/>

As its name implies, the Mistle Thrush is important in [[plant propagation|propagating]] the mistletoe, an aerial parasite, which needs its seeds to be deposited on the branches of suitable trees. The highly nutritious fruits are favoured by the thrush, which digests the flesh leaving the sticky seeds to be excreted, possibly in a suitable location for germination.<ref name= fleas28>Rothschild & Clay (1953) p. 28.</ref>

The Mistle Thrush has an extensive distribution in Europe and western Asia, and its European breeding population is estimated at 9<U+2013>22.2&nbsp;million birds. When Asian breeders are added, this gives a global total of 12.2<U+2013>44.4&nbsp;million.<ref name=IUCN2012/> The species was formerly more restricted in range, and rarely bred even in northern England in the 1700s.<ref name= brown>Brown & Grice (2005) p. 499.</ref> It expanded rapidly into lowland and coastal areas of Europe during the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century, colonising areas where it was formerly rare or absent, such as Ireland (where it first bred in 1807), Scotland and the Netherlands. The range also increased in Denmark, Norway, Hungary and Austria.<ref name=BWP/>

Although the population now appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] as being of [[Least Concern]].<ref name=IUCN2012/> The perceived decline may be due to the loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture.<ref name= brown/> In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.<ref name = hbwonline/>

[[File:Mistlethrushbonna.png|thumb|upright=0.4|Mistle Thrush and Alpine Chough by [[Giovanni da Udine]]]]
[[Desiderius Erasmus|Desiderius Erasmus's]] early sixteenth century collection of Latin proverbs included ''Turdus malum sibi ipse cacat'', (the thrush himself excretes his own trouble), which refers to the use of the sticky berries favoured by this species to make [[birdlime]] for trapping birds. The thrush is literally spreading the seeds of his own destruction.<ref name= job404/><ref name=erasmus>Erasmus (1982) p. 25.</ref>

Sixteenth-century artist [[Giovanni da Udine]] painted in [[Raphael|Raphael's]] workshop. His ''Mistle Thrush and Alpine Chough'' was a sketch for his ''Bird with Garland and Fruit'', and this in turn was the basis for a Raphael [[fresco]] in the [[Apostolic Palace]].<ref name= Hersey>Hersey (1993) p. 225.</ref><ref name= Alsteens>Alsteens (2009) pp. 22<U+2013>23.</ref>

The early [[Renaissance]] poem "The Harmony of Birds" had the ''thrusshe'' (Mistle Thrush) sing "sanctus, sanctus", and distinguished it from the Song Thrush, the ''mauys'' or ''throstle''.<ref>Percy Society ''et al''. (1842) p. 6.</ref><ref name= andrew>Andrew (1985) p. 77.</ref> The song is also described in [[Thomas Hardy|Thomas Hardy's]] "Darkling Thrush" and [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas's]] "The Thrush".<ref name= Armitage>Armitage & Dee (2011) pp. 202<U+2013>203.</ref> The loud call of this common and conspicuous bird also led to many old or local names, including "screech" and "shrite".<ref name= swainson>Swainson (1886) [http://archive.org/stream/folkloreprovinci00swaiuoft#page/viii/mode/2up pp. 1<U+2013>2].</ref> Others, like   "stormcock" referred to its willingness to sing in wind and rain. "Holm thrush", "hollin cock" and "holm cock" are based on obsolete names for the holly tree, which may be defended by the thrush in winter for its berries.<ref name= Cocker>Cocker & Mabey (2005) pp. 360<U+2013>361</ref>
