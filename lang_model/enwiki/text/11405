'''''Diva''''' is the third [[studio album]] by [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] [[reggaet<U+00F3>n]] recording artist [[Ivy Queen]]. It was released on August 23, 2003 and independently distributed by Real Music Group. The recording followed her two previous studio albums which were commercially unsuccessful. It featured collaborations with Latin [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artists including [[Mexicano 777]], [[Bimbo Carmona|Bimbo]] and [[K7 (musician)|K-7]] while the album's production was handled by a variety of musical producers; [[Luny Tunes]], [[DJ Nelson]], [[Noriega]], and [[Iv<U+00E1>n Joy]] were enlisted, while DJ Adam produced a majority of the tracks. Lyrically, the album explored female empowerment, infidelity, heartbreak and love.

''Diva'' spawned a total of six singles: "[[Quiero Bailar (song)|Quiero Bailar]]", "[[Ivy Queen|Quiero Saber]]", "[[Papi Te Quiero]]", "[[Guillaera]]", "[[Ivy Queen|Tuya Soy]]" and "[[Ivy Queen|Tu No Puedes]]", which were released over the course of three years. "Quiero Bailar" became a commercial success in the United States and Puerto Rico, while the other five singles failed to acquire chart success on national charts. Highly anticipated and acclaimed, ''Diva'' peaked at number twenty-four on the [[Top Latin Albums|''Billboard'' Top Latin Albums]] chart, number eight on the [[Top Heatseekers|''Billboard'' Top Heatseekers]] chart for the South Atlantic area, number four on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' Reggae Albums]] and number one on the [[Tropical Albums|''Billboard'' Tropical Albums]] chart. It became the eight best-selling Tropical Album of 2004, while the recording helped Queen to become the eighth best-selling Tropical Artist of that year. The album was recognized as a "door-opener" for reggaet<U+00F3>n's mainstream exposure in 2004. 

==Background==
After the failed commercial success of Ivy Queen's first two studio albums, ''[[En Mi Imperio]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Original Rude Girl]]'' (1998), she was dropped from the [[Sony Music Latin|Sony]] label and took a hiatus from her musical career in 1999.<ref name="Forgotten">{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3A8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15&dq=Ivy+queen+had+it+all&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sSQTUe_QIqHg2gXAmIDoDA&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Ivy%20queen%20had%20it%20all&f=false|title=Reggaet<U+00F3>n Acts Rise Up On Indie Labels|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|last=Newman|first=Melinda|date=2004-03-06|accessdate=2012-12-08}}</ref> The 1999 single, "[[In the Zone (song)|In The Zone]]", a duet with Haitian singer [[Wyclef Jean]], was a moderate success in the United States.
