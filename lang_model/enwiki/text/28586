"'''Backwards'''" is the first episode of [[science fiction]] [[sit-com]] ''[[Red Dwarf (TV series)|Red Dwarf]]'' Series III,<ref name="British Sitcom Guide - Red Dwarf - Series 3">{{cite web | url =http://www.sitcom.co.uk/red_dwarf/series3.shtml | title =British Sitcom Guide - Red Dwarf - Series 3 | publisher =www.sitcom.co.uk |accessdate =2008-01-25}}</ref> and the thirteenth in the series run.<ref name="TV.com - Backwards summary">{{cite web | url =http://www.tv.com/red-dwarf/backwards/episode/10957/summary.html | title =TV.com - Backwards summary | publisher =www.tv.com |accessdate =2008-01-25}}</ref>  It premiered on the [[United Kingdom|British]] television channel [[BBC2]] on 14 November 1989.<ref name="BBC Programme Catalogue - RED DWARF III THE SAGA CONTINUUMS - 1, BACKWARDS">{{cite web | url =http://catalogue.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/NMRJ900L | title =BBC - Programme Catalogue - RED DWARF III THE SAGA CONTINUUMS - 1, BACKWARDS | publisher =BBC |accessdate =2007-12-11}}</ref> Written by [[Rob Grant]] and [[Doug Naylor]], and directed by [[Ed Bye]], the episode has the crew travel to an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate Earth]] where time runs backwards.

The episode marks the first appearance of [[Robert Llewellyn]]'s Kryten, [[Hattie Hayridge]]'s Holly, the new spaceship [[Red Dwarf ships#Starbug|Starbug]], better production values, and a change in direction of story themes that would cement the shows cult status.<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide History">Howarth & Lyons (1993)</ref>  The story was later reformulated as a novel by the [[Backwards|same name]]. The episode was re-mastered, along with the rest of the first three series, in 1998.

==Plot==
[[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]] ([[Chris Barrie]]) takes [[Kryten]] ([[Robert Llewellyn]]) out in ''[[Red Dwarf ships#Starbug|Starbug 1]]'' for his piloting test and while answering recognition questions they travel through a time hole. They crash land on a planet which appears similar to Earth. As they reach a road side they notice that a sign which says "Nodnol, 871 selim". Although Rimmer is confused, Kryten correctly states that the sign reads London, 178 miles, and that they're on a backwards Earth.<ref name="Prog Guide p60">Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 60.</ref>

Meanwhile [[Dave Lister|Lister]] ([[Craig Charles]]) and [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]] ([[Danny John-Jules]]) have been flying around in ''[[Red Dwarf ships#Starbug|Starbug 2]]'' for the past three weeks searching for them.  They come across the same "time hole" that Starbug 1 did and, despite Cat's reservations, go through it. They close in on Starbug 1 using a homing device and land near the lake where it crash landed. Upon exiting Starbug 2 Lister complains of feeling some pain - he suddenly has a black eye and his ribs feel like they've been cracked.<ref name="Prog Guide p60"/> 

Kryten and Rimmer are initially disgusted with this "backwards" world. Here, people take money from busker's hats, and cafes are populated by customers who spit tea back into teacups and messily disgorge chocolate eclairs. Newspapers report events that have yet to happen, and advertise job vacancies that offer good prospects of demotion. Rimmer and Kryten quickly discover that they can use their forwardness to their advantage, starring in an act called "The Sensational Reverse Brothers".<ref name="Prog Guide p60"/>

Lister and Cat eventually track down Kryten and Rimmer at the club where they work, whereupon Lister finally discovers that everything is backwards, after initially thinking they had landed in Bulgaria. However, Kryten and Rimmer are quite content on this planet. Lister tries to convince them to come back, but they intend to stay. The club owner then fires them for starting a fight, but Kryten argues that they have not started any fight. Lister soon realises that they did start the fight, but it has not happened yet. Lister gets punched in the face, sucking his black eye away, and this leads to a barroom brawl and a huge fight breaks out in reverse. Eventually everything is restored to its original state and they realise that they cannot stay on a backwards Earth. The final realisation occurs when Cat proceeds to relieve himself in the bushes, forgetting that everything happens in reverse.<ref name="Prog Guide p60"/>

==Production==
[[Image:red dwarf backwards nodnol sign.jpg|thumb|right|Locations in and around Manchester were used for the episode]]With Rob Grant and Doug Naylor directly involved with the third series, under their Grant Naylor Productions team, they radically changed the look of the show.<ref name="Red Dwarf Series III Production">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck05/series_3/production.html | title =Red Dwarf Series III Production | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-01-07}}</ref>  The opening credits sequence sported a new rock guitar version of the Red Dwarf theme tune playing over clips from the series.<ref name="Red Dwarf Series III Music">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck05/series_3/music.html | title =Red Dwarf Series III Music | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-01-07}}</ref>  The opening sequence ends with the first appearance of the official logo of the show which was designed by DeWinters.<ref name="Red Dwarf Series III Production">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck05/series_3/production.html | title =Red Dwarf Series III Production | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-01-07}}</ref>  Mel Bibby had also come onboard the crew and re-designed the sets. His influence of [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' film clearly shown in the new sets as murky and run down feel.<ref name="Red Dwarf Series III Sets">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck05/series_3/sets.html | title =Red Dwarf Series III Sets | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-01-07}}</ref>

Costumes were overhauled as well as Costume designer Howard Burden brought in a new stylish look to the crew. Lister's jacket outfit, having been designed with his art school background in mind, included a voluptuous woman riding a rocket on the back. This woman had indeed intended to be Wilma Flintstone but was changed to a generic looking female once the legality of using The Flintstone image arose. Rimmer's tunic uniform served as implying his devotion to duty as well as his hologrammatic status. While the Cat's wardrobe reached new heights in the fashion stakes where as Kryten's appearance was based on the Series II look but produced more successfully.<ref name="Red Dwarf Series III Costumes">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck05/series_3/Costumes.html | title =Red Dwarf Series III Costumes | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-01-07}}</ref> 

Effects also featured more heavily in the new series. The bar room brawl with plenty of fake glass, featured a stunt double hurling through a window on the set. Blue screen backgrounds were used for the actors to film against which was then merged with the cloaked Starbug location footage. Close up shots were merely filmed on top of a raised platform with only the sky visible in the background.<ref name="Red Dwarf Series III Effects">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck05/series_3/effects.html | title =Red Dwarf Series III Effects | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-01-07}}</ref>

Starbug was introduced as the new spaceship in place of [[Red Dwarf ships#Blue Midget|Blue Midget]]. Grant and Naylor felt that Blue Midget didn't work well set-wise because of size constraints so they requested that Peter Wragg, and his visual effects team, come up with a design for another ship. The final design, initially called White Midget, was shown to Grant and Naylor and they liked it, but they thought it looked more like a bug so settled on the name Starbug.<ref name="Interview: Peter Wragg">Interview: Peter Wragg, Red Dwarf Smegazine, issue 8, October 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, issn 0965-5603</ref> 

The Series III pre-credits scroll detailing the back story was actually intended to be an episode in its own right. Titled "Dad", the episode would have tied the loose ends from series two's "[[Parallel Universe (Red Dwarf episode)|Parallel Universe]]" where Lister would have given birth to the twins and given them back to the parallel universe Lister version. Grant and Naylor had partially written the script but they decided to scrap the idea as they felt it to be unfunny and potentially offensive to women.<ref name="Interview: Grant Naylor">Interview: Grant Naylor, Red Dwarf Smegazine, issue 6, August 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, issn 0965-5603</ref>

Many of the location scenes for "Backwards" were filmed in and around [[Manchester]]. Series creator and writer Rob Grant can be seen standing on the street with sunglasses smoking a cigarette backwards. The episode's theme gave the writers an opportunity to insert some in-joke dialogue that otherwise wouldn't have been put in. In one scene the bar manager comes into Rimmer and Kryten's dressing room to tell them that they're sacked for un-starting a bar room brawl. In fact what he is saying refers more to the one sad prat who has been bothered to get hold of this recording, turn it round, and actually work out this rubbish. At the very end (beginning?) of the reverse barroom brawl, an "Action!", said by [[Ed Bye]] can be heard.<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide History"/>

The character of Kryten was originally intended as a one-off appearance in the series-two episode "[[Kryten (Red Dwarf episode)|Kryten]]". The character returned mainly to broaden the story potential as Lister was the only person who could really do anything. Rimmer, a hologram, couldn't touch anything, the Cat couldn't be bothered to touch anything, and Holly was incompetent. The show was becoming difficult to write for. At the insistence of Naylor, Kryten returned to complete the team.<ref name="Interview: Grant Naylor"/> 

Grant and Naylor had approached [[David Ross (actor)|David Ross]] with the intention of bringing him back to play the regular role of Kryten. Ross was in a stage play ''Flea In Her Ear'' and wasn't available, so they went to see [[Robert Llewellyn]] at the advice of Paul Jackson. Llewellyn was in a stage show called ''Mammon'', playing a robot. They saw his performance and were impressed.<ref name="Interview: Grant Naylor"/> 

The very first scene that Llewellyn filmed involved him lighting candles with his fingers. He was wired up for the flame to ignite from his fingertip. The problem was that it was wet on the set and he was sweating so the wiring was backfiring and electrocuting him. The scene was cut out from the show.<ref name="Interview: Grant Naylor"/>

"Backwards" world guest stars includes [[Maria Friedman]] as the Waitress, [[Tony Hawks]] as a Compere, Anna Palmer as a Customer in Cafe and [[Arthur Smith]] as the Pub Manager.<ref name="Backwards cast and crew">{{cite web | url =http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0684144/fullcredits | title =Backwards cast and crew | publisher =www.imdb.com |accessdate =2008-01-25}}</ref>

Kryten's spaceship examination, which includes registration reading, "if you'd like show me to your vehicle", "in your own time", direction instructions, recognition test and stopping distances all mirrors the same examination that UK citizens take with [[DVLA]] examinations. 

Both [[Ghengis Khan]] and [[Doug McClure]] are referenced by Rimmer when trying to ascertain the time period.

The [[Big Bang]] theory, as well as expansion and contraction, is explained by Holly as the reason why this universe is running backwards. To look inconspicuous Kryten walks into the cafe wearing a [[Ronald Reagan]] rubber mask. The newspaper that Kryten is titled ''Yadretsey'', or ''Yesterday'' forwards <U+2014> a parody of the ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'' newspaper that was published at time of production.

Kryten and Rimmer think that the backwards world is wonderful, stating facts like [[World War II|the second world war]] where millions of people will come back to life. [[Hitler]] will retreat across [[Europe]], liberating [[France]] and [[Poland]]. Lister though looks at the other side of the argument and states that in this universe [[St. Francis of Assissi]] is the petty-minded little sadist who goes around maiming small animals and [[Santa Claus]] is a big guy who sneaks down chimneys and steals all the kids' favourite toys.
