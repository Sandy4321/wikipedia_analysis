'''''No. 5, 1948''''' is a painting by [[Jackson Pollock]] (January 28, 1912 <U+2013> August 11, 1956), an American painter known for his contributions to the [[abstract expressionist]] movement. The painting was done on an 8' x 4' sheet of [[fiberboard]], with thick amounts of brown and yellow paint drizzled on top of it, forming a nest-like appearance.<ref name="Post">{{cite news | url= http://www.post-trib.com/news/123108,PollackArt.article | title= Financier splashes out $140m for Pollock work | date=November 3, 2006 | publisher= [[Post-Tribune]]}}</ref> It was originally owned by [[Samuel Irving Newhouse]] and displayed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] before being sold to [[David Geffen]] and then allegedly to [[David Martinez]] in 2006 (though the supposed sale of this painting to Martinez has been denied by his attorneys)  <ref name="Artnet"> {{cite web | url= http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/artmarketwatch/artmarketwatch11-3-06.asp | title= Art Market Watch | date=November 3, 2006 | accessdate=2006-11-08 | publisher= Artnet}}</ref>.

==Alleged sale==
According to a report in ''[[The New York Times]]'', on November 2, 2006, the painting was sold by [[David Geffen]], founder of [[Geffen Records]] and co-founder of [[Dreamworks SKG]], to [[David Martinez]], managing partner of [[Fintech Advisory]] Ltd, in a private sale for a record [[inflation]]-adjusted price of $140 million.<ref name="Time">{{cite news | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/arts/design/02drip.html?adxnnl=1&ref=arts&adxnnlx=1163031599-revbGMuaIhdTP4qLonq8BA | title= A Pollock Is Sold, Possibly for a Record Price | date=November 2, 2006 | work= [[The New York Times]]}}</ref> The sale was reportedly brokered by [[Sotheby]]<U+2019>s auctioneer Tobias Meyer,<ref name="BBC">{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6111526.stm | title= Pollock work 'earns record price' | date=November 3, 2006 | publisher= [[BBC News]]}}</ref> however, [[Shearman & Sterling]], LLP issued a press release on behalf of its client, David Martinez, to announce that contrary to recent articles in the press, Mr Martinez does not own the painting or any rights to acquire it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/20061112-9999-1n12mexweek.html |title=The Week in Mexico| date=November 12, 2006 | work=San Diego Union-Tribune}}</ref> It is speculated that Geffen sold the painting, along with two others, to raise enough funds to bid for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Martinez has reportedly been amassing an art collection, buying multiple modern artworks in recent years.

This sale would make the painting the most expensive ever sold, privately or at auction, exceeding the sale of [[Gustav Klimt]]'s 1907 ''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'' to [[Ronald Lauder]], [[heir]] to the [[Est<U+00E9>e Lauder Companies]] fortune, by around five million dollars.<ref name="BBC" /> David Cook, deputy director of painting at [[Sotheby]]'s Australia, stated that the price of Pollock's paintings will continually rise in value, as very few of Pollock's paintings are still left. Cook has also stated that another of Pollock's paintings, ''[[Blue Poles]]'', is worth at least 180 million AUD and possibly even more than ''No. 5, 1948''.<ref name="Canberra">{{cite news | url= http://canberra.yourguide.com.au/detail.asp?class=news&subclass=general&story_id=528424&category=General&m=11&y=2006 | title= Our Poles world's top-priced painting? | date=November 4, 2006 | work=[[The Canberra Times]]}}</ref>  In addition to the refutation issued by Shearman & Sterling, the auction expert [[Josh Baer]] indicated that Martinez was not the buyer of the painting.<ref name="Artnet" />
