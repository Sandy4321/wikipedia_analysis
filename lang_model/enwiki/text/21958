'''Corsican Italians''' are the Italian speaking populations of the island of [[Corsica]] (Corse in French), who promoted the union of Corsica to [[Italy]]. They were called with this name by the [[Italia irredenta|Irredentism]] movement of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] after the Unification of Italy in the XIX century, mainly during the [[Fascism]].

==History==

Corsica was fully Italian (ethnically, linguistically and historically) until 1768, when the [[Republic of Genoa]] gave the island to [[France]], exactly one year before [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was born in the capital Ajaccio. Since then the [[Italian language]] has been slowly but steadily substituted by the [[French language|French]], mainly after 1870.<ref>Melillo, A.M. ''Profilo dei dialetti italiani: Corsica''. pag 48</ref>

[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] promoted the unification of the Corsican Italians to Italy when [[Rome]] was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy, but [[Victor Emmanuel II]] did not agree to it.

The process of the [[Italia irredenta|Italian irredentism]] affected marginally Corsica and only during the [[Fascism]] of [[Mussolini]] were started in Corsica the first organizations promoting strongly the unification of the island to the [[Kingdom of Italy]].

Before WWI in Livorno ([[Leghorn]]) professor Francesco Guerri founded the review "Corsica antica e moderna", inspired on the "Archivio storico di Corsica" of Gioacchino Volpe. Petru Rocca created in the 1920s the ''Partito autonomista'' of Corsica (of which was segretary) with the support of monsignor Domenico Parlotti and dr. Croce, director of the "Archivi di Stato della Corsica".

Before and during WW2 there were Corsican intellectuals making pro-Italian propaganda and cultural activities in Italy (mainly in the "Gruppi di Cultura Corsa"), like Marco Angeli, Bertino Poli, Marchetti, Luccarotti, Grimaldi and Petru Giovacchini (he was later chosen as possible governor of Corsica if Italy had annexed it).[http://www.saturniatellus.com/portale/viewtopic.php?p=8218]  The most renowned was [[Petru Giovacchini]], who considered [[Pascal Paoli]] (the hero of Corsica) as the precursor of the Corsican irredentism in favor of the unification of the island to Italy.<ref>

In November 1942 the VII Army Corps of the [[Regio Esercito (WWII)]] pacifically occupied Corsica, still under the formal sovereignity of Vichy France.  Because of the lack of partizan resistance and to avoid problems with [[Petain]], no Corsican units were formed under the Italian control (except for a labour battalion formed in March 1943).
 
Some Corsican military officials collaborated with Italy, as the retired Major Pantalacci (and his son Antonio), colonel Mondielli and colonel Petru Simone Cristofini (and his wife, the first Corsican female journalist Marta Renucci).<ref>''Vita e Tragedia dell'Irredentismo Corso'', Rivista Storia Verit<U+00E0></ref>

After [[WWII]] nearly one hundred collaborationists or autonomists (included the intellectuals) were put on trial by the French authorities in 1946 and found guilty, 8 of them were sentenced to death, but only colonel Cristofini was executed. 

Actually the Italian irredentistic movement in Corsica has disappeared, but has evolved in some independence movements from France (like the [[Corsica Nazione]], [[Partitu di a Nazione Corsa]] 
and the rebel organization called [[National Front for the Liberation of Corsica]]). 

===A Corsican Irredentist===

Colonel Petru Simone Cristofini was born in Calenzana (near [[Calvi]], Corsica) on 26 May 1903 and in 1939 he was a captain of the 3rd Algerine Fusiliers regiment. He was initially a supporter of [[Petain]]. After the Allied occupation of French North Africa he commanded the ''Phalange Africaine''. 

In [[Tunisia]] he was wounded in an eye and, before returning to Corsica (where he supported pro-Italy secessionists), he met [[Mussolini]] in Rome and actively collaborated with the Italian forces in Corsica during the first months of 1943. In the island he worked with Petru Giovacchini (the possible governor of Corsica if the [[Axis]] had won the war). Cristofini, as head of the Ajaccio troops, helped the Italian Army to control successfully the Resistance opposition in Corsica, before the Italian Armistice in September 1943.

Colonel Cristofini was put on trial for treason after the [[Allied]] occupation of Corsica and sentenced to death. He tried to kill himself, and was executed while he was dying in November 1943. <ref>''Il Martirio di un irredento: il colonnello Petru Simone Cristofini''. Rivista Storia Verit<U+00E0></ref>

==Language==

The first [[Corsican Constitution]] was written in Italian (the language of culture in Corsica until the end of XIX century) for the short-lived [[Corsica#The_Corsican_republic|Corsican republic]], established in 1755 by [[Pascal Paoli]], who proclaimed that the Italian was the official language of Corsica. 

Even the second Corsican Constitution of the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom in 1794 was in Italian.[http://www.pasqualepaoli.com/english/royaume.htm] 

While most Corsicans spoke the Corsican dialect at home, until the first half of the XIX century the Italian was the language most publicly spoken and written in the island. 
[[Image:Bonifacio Porte de Genes 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Genoese gate at [[Bonifacio]] castle]] 
In the second half of the XIX century the [[French language]] substituted the Italian, mainly because of [[Napoleon III]], but at the same time the Corsican dialect started to be used by many Corsican intellectuals. 

The actual [[corsican language]] is directly related to the Tuscan dialect of [[Pisa]], an italian city that dominated the island before [[Genoa]] . In the north of the island ([[Calvi]]),  there it is a local dialect very similar to the medioeval genoese.

In the mountanous interior of Corsica there are many villages were nearly everybody speaks the ''Corso'', practically a medioeval Pisan dialect mixed with many Sardinian words.[http://foreignaffairs.tripod.com/armillotta/pisa94_corsica.html]

The extreme similarity of the Corso with the Italian can be understood in this phrase:  ''S<U+00F2> natu in Corsica <U+00E8> g'aghju passatu i megli anni di a mio ghjuvent<U+00F9> (Corso)/ Sono nato in Corsica e vi ho passato i migliori anni della mia giovent<U+00F9> (Italian)''.

The irredentist Marco Angeli di Sart<U+00E8>na wrote in 1924 the first book in "Corso" (titled ''Terra c<U+00F2>rsa'') and many lyrics in this dialect (titled ''Malincunie'') in [[Ajaccio]]. He created and wrote even the newspaper <U+00AB>Giovent<U+00F9><U+00BB> of the "Partito Corso d'azione", partially in Italian and Corsican.

Actually nearly 12% of the Corsicans speaks even the [[Italian language]], while 3/4 understand it thanks to the television programs from nearby Italy. <ref>Vignoli, Giulio. ''Gli Italiani Dimenticati''. pag 126</ref>
