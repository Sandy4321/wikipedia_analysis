'''Hurricane Nate''' was an [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic hurricane]] that threatened [[Bermuda]] but remained at sea during early September 2005. The fourteenth [[Tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] and seventh hurricane of the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|annual Atlantic hurricane season]], Nate formed southwest of Bermuda on September 5 and initially moved very slowly to the northeast. Early forecasts suggested a possible threat to the island, but Nate passed well to its south as a [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category&nbsp;1]] hurricane on September 8. After moving away from the island, the storm entered a region with cooler sea surface temperatures and unfavorable [[wind shear]], causing it to weaken to a tropical storm before becoming [[extratropical]] on September 10. The extratropical remnant was later absorbed by a larger weather system.

The hurricane caused no structural damage, although it generated [[rip current]]s that killed one person off the [[New Jersey]] coast. Nate dropped light rainfall and produced gusty winds on the island of Bermuda. The remnants of hurricanes Nate and [[Hurricane Maria (2005)|Maria]] contributed to heavy rainfall in [[Western Norway]], triggering a mudslide that killed one person. Canadian Navy ships en route to the US Gulf Coast, carrying relief supplies to assist in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], were delayed while trying to avoid hurricanes Nate and [[Hurricane Ophelia (2005)|Ophelia]].

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Nate 2005 track.png|alt=Track map of hurricane. The United States are seen on the western end of the map, while Bermuda is located closer to the center.}}
A [[tropical wave]] emerged from the west coast of Africa on August&nbsp;30 and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean, maintaining a vigorous area of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] along the wave axis. By September&nbsp;1 most of the  deep convection had been stripped away by southwesterly wind shear.  Despite this, the wave remained well-defined as it continued west-northwest. The wave split into two pieces; the northern portion passed between the [[Leeward Islands]] and [[Hurricane Maria (2005)|Hurricane Maria]] on September&nbsp;3, while the southern portion moved into the [[Caribbean Sea]]. On September&nbsp;4, the northern portion of the wave began to interact with an upper-level [[low pressure system]] and an elongated [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] that was located between [[Bermuda]] and the Leeward Islands<ref name="NateTCR">{{cite web|author=Stacy R.

[[Rainband|Convective banding]] formed around a broad [[surface weather analysis|surface low]]. It is estimated that the system developed into a tropical depression at 1800&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on September&nbsp;5. At the time it was located approximately {{convert|350|mi|km}} to the south-southwest of Bermuda.<ref name="NateTCR"/>

Upon being designated, Tropical Depression Fifteen developed deep convection close to, and to the east of, the [[eye (cyclone)|center of circulation]]. At the same time, [[tropical cyclone#Physical structure|banding features]] became better organized.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Molleda and Richard Pasch|title=Tropical Depression 15 Discussion Number 1|date=September 5, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 5, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al152005.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref> Later on September 5, the overall cloud pattern improved while thunderstorm activity condensed and deepened within the increasingly well-defined circulation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Knabb|title=Tropical Storm Nate Discussion Number 2|date=September 5, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 5, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al152005.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref> Just six hours after being designated as a tropical depression, the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm; it was given the name ''Nate'' by the [[National Hurricane Center]]. Over the following two days, Nate drifted slowly northeastward towards Bermuda.<ref name="NateTCR"/>

Within the early hours of September&nbsp;6, Nate became quasi-stationary under a weak steering pattern between Hurricane Maria and a disturbance over [[The Bahamas]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Stacy Stewart|title=Tropical Storm Nate Discussion Number 3|date=September 6, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 5, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al152005.discus.003.shtml?}}</ref> Satellite imagery indicated that the cloud pattern continued to organize with excellent [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] surrounding the storm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lixion Avila|title=Tropical Storm Nate Discussion Number 4|date=September 6, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 5, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al152005.discus.004.shtml?}}</ref> Late on September&nbsp;6 a developing [[eye (cyclone)|banding eye feature]] became evident.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Roberts and Jack Beven|title=Tropical Storm Nate Discussion Number 6|date=September 6, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 5, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al152005.discus.006.shtml?}}</ref> Tropical Storm Nate strengthened further and became a hurricane at 1200 UTC&nbsp;on September&nbsp;7, as it began to turn away from Bermuda.<ref name="NateTCR"/> Some models indicated that Nate could have been either absorbed by or [[Fujiwhara effect|merged]] with the larger Hurricane Maria, but the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) forecast that Nate would survive as a separate system, which it did.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Roberts and Jack Beven|title=Hurricane Nate Discussion Number 10|date=September 7, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 5, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al152005.discus.010.shtml}}</ref> The large low to the northeast of The Bahamas gradually opened into a broad trough as a shortwave trough approached from the northwest. The larger trough slowly became elongated in a northeast<U+2013>southwest manner late on September&nbsp;7. At the same time, the shortwave trough moved southward along the west side of the other trough. The increasing southwesterly flow along the southeast side of the broad trough caused Nate to accelerate northeastward. Nate reached its peak intensity of 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) late on September&nbsp;8 as it passed 120&nbsp;miles (205&nbsp;km) southeast of Bermuda, while its strongest winds remained well offshore.<ref name="NateTCR"/>

While at peak intensity, the storm maintained a well-organized and "impressive" convective pattern.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jamie Rhome and Jack Beven|title=Hurricane Kate Discussion Number 14|date=September 8, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 5, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al152005.discus.014.shtml?}}</ref> Soon after the storm peaked in strength, increasing wind shear and dry air caused Nate to weaken back into a tropical storm later on September&nbsp;9.<ref name="NateTCR"/> Satellite imagery showed that the cloud pattern began to rapidly deteriorate.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jamie Rhome and James Franklin|title=Hurricane Nate Discussion Number 15|date=September 9, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 5, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al152005.discus.015.shtml?}}</ref> The hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm at 1800&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;9 and continued to weaken as wind shear increased in association with an approaching trough and a related [[cold front]].<ref name="NateTCR"/> By late on September&nbsp;9, all of the already limited convective activity was confined to the eastern semicircle, leaving the low-level center exposed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Blake and Lixion Avila|title=Hurricane Kate Discussion Number 17|date=September 9, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 5, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al152005.discus.017.shtml?}}</ref> The storm was reduced to a swirl of low-level clouds just hours later.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jamie Rhome and Jack Beven|title=Hurricane Kate Discussion Number 18|date=September 9, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 5, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al152005.discus.018.shtml?}}</ref> Nate became extratropical the next day before becoming absorbed by a larger system by 0000&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;13, to the north-northeast of the [[Azores]].<ref name="NateTCR"/>

A [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm watch]] was issued for [[Bermuda]] early on September&nbsp;7, and later that day a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch superseded it.
