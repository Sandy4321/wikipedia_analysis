'''Ronald Wilson Reagan''' ([[February 6]] [[1911]] &ndash; [[June 5]] [[2004]]) was the 40th [[President of the United States]] (1981&ndash;1989) and the 33rd [[Governor of California]] (1967&ndash;1975). Born in [[Illinois]], Reagan moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] in the 1930s, where he was an [[actor]], president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG), and a spokesman for [[General Electric]] (GE). His start in politics occurred during his work for GE; originally a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he switched to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in 1962. After delivering [[A Time for Choosing|a rousing speech]] in support of [[Barry Goldwater]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1964|presidential candidacy in 1964]], he was persuaded to seek the California governorship, winning [[California gubernatorial election, 1966|two years later]] and [[California gubernatorial election, 1970|again in 1970]]. He was defeated in his run for the [[United States presidential election, 1968|Republican presidential nomination in 1968]] as well as [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], but won both the nomination and election in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]].

As president, Reagan implemented new political initiatives as well as economic policies, advocating a [[limited government]] and economic ''[[laissez-faire]]'' philosophy, but the extent to which the implementation of these ideas was successful is debated. The [[Supply-side economics|supply side economic]] policies, dubbed "[[Reaganomics]]", included [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981|substantial tax cuts]] implemented in 1981. After surviving an [[Reagan assassination attempt|assassination attempt]] and ordering [[Invasion of Grenada|military actions]] in [[Grenada]], he was [[United States presidential election, 1984|re-elected]] in a landslide victory in 1984.

Reagan's second term was marked by the beginning of the end of the [[Cold War]], as well as the revelation of the [[Iran-Contra affair]]. The president ordered a massive military buildup in an arms race with the [[Soviet Union]], forgoing the previous strategy of [[d<U+00E9>tente]]. He publicly portrayed the USSR as an "[[evil empire]]" and [[Reagan Doctrine|supported anti-Communist movements worldwide]]. Despite his rejection of d<U+00E9>tente, he negotiated with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to shrink both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan left office in 1989; in 1994 the former president [[Ronald Reagan's Alzheimer's letter|disclosed]] that he had been diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|died ten years later]] at the age of ninety-three, and ranks [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|highly]] among former U.S. presidents in terms of approval rating.

According to [[Paul Kengor]], author of ''God and Ronald Reagan'', Reagan had a particularly strong faith in the goodness of people, which stemmed from the optimistic faith of his mother, Nelle,<ref name="pk 16">Kengor, Paul (2004), p. 16 </ref> and the [[Disciples of Christ]] faith,<ref name="pk 16"/> which he was baptized into in 1922.<ref>Flowers, Richard B.

===Radio and film===
[[Image:Ronald Reagan in Cowboy From Brooklyn trailer.jpg|thumb|left|Reagan starred in ''Cowboy From Brooklyn'' in 1938.]]
After graduating from Eureka in 1932, Reagan drove himself to Iowa, where he auditioned for a job at many small-town [[radio station]]s.<ref name="agpi"/> He earned a job broadcasting [[University of Iowa]] home football games for the [[Hawkeyes]].

While traveling with the Cubs in California, Reagan took a screen test in 1937 that led to a seven-year contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] studios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/a_hero.asp|title=Biography > A Hero from the Heartland|accessdate=2007-12-30|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation}}</ref> His first screen credit was the starring role in the 1937 movie ''[[Love Is on the Air]]'', and by the end of 1939 he had already appeared in 19 films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp|title=Ronald Reagan > Hollywood Years|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation|accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref> Before the film ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' in 1940, he played the role of [[George Gipp|George "The Gipper" Gipp]] in the film ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]''; from it, he acquired the lifelong nickname "the Gipper".<ref name="Cannon15">Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 15</ref> Reagan's favorite acting role was in 1942's ''[[Kings Row]]'',<ref name="Rest of Me">{{cite book |last= Reagan |first= Ronald |title= Where's the Rest of Me? |year= 1965 |publisher= Duell, Sloan, and Pearce |location= New York}}</ref> but his performance did not meet with universal approval: one reviewer felt that Reagan had made "only casual acquaintance with the [character]".<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley |work=The New York Times|date=1942-02-03|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9903E2DE143BE33BBC4B53DFB4668389659EDE|title=The Screen; 'Kings Row,' With Ann Sheridan and Claude Rains, a Heavy, Rambling Film, Has Its First Showing Here at the Astor|accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref> Reagan also acted in ''[[Tennessee's Partner]]'', ''[[Hellcats of the Navy]]'', ''[[This Is the Army]]'', ''[[Dark Victory]]'', ''[[Bedtime for Bonzo]]'', ''[[Cattle Queen of Montana]]'', and ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (his final film) in a 1964 remake.<ref name=imdb>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/|title=Ronald Reagan|accessdate=2007-12-30|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}</ref>

==Early political career==
A registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and admirer of [[Franklin D.

Eisenhower]] in 1952 and 1956 as well as [[Richard Nixon]] in 1960.<ref>Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 132</ref> In his position with General Electric, Reagan was required to tour GE plants and give speeches.

Although he had speechwriters later in the White House, he continued editing, and even occasionally writing, many of his speeches.<ref>Rollyson, Carl E. (2006) American Biography. iUniverse. p. 197</ref>

Two years after switching parties, Reagan joined the campaign of conservative presidential contender [[Barry Goldwater]]. Speaking on Goldwater's behalf, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. He revealed his ideological motivation in a famed speech given on [[October 27]], [[1964]]: "The [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose.

Reagan was involved in high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era. On [[May 15]], [[1969]], during the [[People's Park (Berkeley)#"Bloody Thursday" and Its Aftermath|People's Park protests]] at UC Berkeley, Reagan sent the [[California Highway Patrol]] and other officers to quell the protests, in an incident that became known as "Bloody Thursday."<ref name="Cannon50">Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 50</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904149,00.html |accessdate=2007-12-09 |date=[[February 16]], [[1970]]| title=Postscript to People's Park|work=Time}}</ref> Reagan then called out 2,200 [[United States National Guard|state National Guard]] troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks in order to crack down on the protesters.<ref name="Cannon50"/> When the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] kidnapped [[Patty Hearst]] in Berkeley and demanded the distribution of food to the poor, Reagan joked, "It's just too bad we can't have an epidemic of [[botulism]]."<ref>{{cite news|title=Reagan Raps Press on Botulism Quote|date=[[March 14]], [[1974]]|work=The Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles, California}}</ref> 

Early in 1967, the national debate on abortion was beginning. Democratic California state senator [[Anthony Beilenson]] introduced the "Therapeutic Abortion Act", in an effort to reduce the number of "back-room abortions" performed in California.<ref name="Cannon50"/> The State Legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he signed it.<ref name="Cannon51">Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 51</ref> About two million abortions would be performed as a result, most because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother.<ref name="Cannon51"/> Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill, and stated that had he been more experienced as governor, it would not have been signed.

Reagan was re-elected in 1970, defeating "Big Daddy" [[Jesse Unruh]], but chose not to seek a third term.  One of Reagan's greatest frustrations in office concerned [[capital punishment]], which he strongly supported.<ref name= "Rest of Me"/> His efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area were thwarted when the [[Supreme Court of California]] issued its ''[[California v. Anderson|People v. Anderson]]'' decision, which invalidated all death sentences issued in California prior to 1972, though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment. The only execution during Reagan's governorship was on [[April 12]], [[1967]], when Aaron Mitchell's sentence was carried out by the state in [[San Quentin|San Quentin's]] gas chamber.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Seneker, Carl J|title=Governor Reagan and Executive Clemency|journal=California Law Review|volume=55|issue=2|pages=412<U+2013>418 |publisher=JSTOR |date=May 1967|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0008-1221(196705)55%3A2%3C412%3AGRAEC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-M|doi=10.2307/3479351|accessdate =2007-11-12}}</ref>

Reagan's terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president. By campaigning on a platform of sending "the welfare bums back to work", he spoke out against the idea of the welfare state. He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy, including that of undue federal taxation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/7092/reagan_economic_legacy.html|title=The Reagan Economic Legacy|accessdate= 2007-08-22|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=June 9, 2004|author=Kubarych, Roger M}}</ref>

[[Image:1976 Republican National Convention.jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Reagan on the podium with Gerald Ford at the 1976 Republican National Convention after narrowly losing the presidential nomination.]]
In 1976, Reagan challenged incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]] in a bid to become the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like-minded organizations such as the [[American Conservative Union]] which became key components of his political base, while President Ford was considered a more moderate Republican.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/gf38.html|title=Biography of Gerald R.

Reagan's campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager [[John Sears]] of winning a few primaries early to seriously damage the lift-off of Ford's campaign, such as his victories in North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy disintegrated.<ref>{{cite news|date=[[September 24]], [[1979]]|accessdate=2008-05-10|title=Candidate Reagan is Born Again|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947391-2,00.html}}</ref> Reagan ended up losing New Hampshire and later Florida.<ref name="1976 Results">{{cite web |url= http://www.politicallibrary.org/TallState/1976rep.html |title=1976 New Hampshire presidential Primary, [[February 24]], [[1976]] Republican Results|publisher=New Hampshire Political Library|accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref>

As the party's [[1976 Republican National Convention|1976 convention]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] neared, Ford appeared close to victory. Acknowledging his party's moderate wing, Reagan chose moderate Republican Senator [[Richard Schweiker]] of [[Pennsylvania]] as his [[running mate]]. Nonetheless, Ford narrowly won, with 1,187 delegates to Reagan's 1,070.<ref name="1976 Results"/>

Reagan's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Although he lost the nomination, Reagan received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a Washington State "[[faithless elector]]" in the November election,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html#1976|title=Electoral College Box Scores 1789<U+2013>1996|accessdate= 2007-04-30|publisher= U.S. National Archives and Records Admin.}}</ref> in which Ford lost to the Democratic challenger [[Jimmy Carter]].

After receiving the Republican nomination, he selected one of his primary opponents, [[George H.W. Bush]], to be his running mate. His showing in the October [[United States presidential election debates|televised debates]] boosted his campaign.

====Judiciary====
During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, if given the opportunity, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice.<ref>Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 280</ref> That opportunity came in his first year in office when he nominated [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice [[Potter Stewart]]. In his second term, Reagan elevated [[William Rehnquist]] to succeed [[Warren Burger]] as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]], and named [[Antonin Scalia]] to fill the vacant seat. 

In 1987 when Associate Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Louis Powell]] retired, Reagan nominated conservative jurist [[Robert Bork]] to the high court. Within 45 minutes of Bork's nomination, Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], a Democrat of [[Massachusetts]], strongly condemned Bork, declaring, "Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions" and "blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters".<ref>{{cite news |title= Washington; Kennedy And Bork|accessdate=2008-04-28|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DF1E3EF936A35754C0A961948260|author=Reston, James|date=[[July 5]], [[1987]]|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

Reagan appointed many leading conservative academics to the intermediate United States Courts of Appeals, including Bork, [[Ralph K. Winter, Jr.]], [[Richard Posner]], and [[Frank Easterbrook]].

====Lebanon and Grenada, 1983====
{{main|Beirut barracks bombing|Invasion of Grenada}}
[[Image:REAGANEugeniaCharles.jpg|thumb|left|Reagan meets with Prime Minister [[Eugenia Charles]] of [[Dominica]] in the [[Oval Office]] about ongoing events in [[Grenada]]]]
American peacekeeping forces in [[Beirut]], a part of [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|a multinational force]] (MNF) during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] who had been earlier deployed by Reagan, were attacked on [[October 23]] [[1983]]. The [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|Beirut barracks bombing]] resulted in the deaths of 241 American servicemen by suicide bombers. Reagan called the attack "despicable", pledged to keep a military force in Lebanon, and planned to target the Sheik Abdullah barracks in [[Baalbek]], Lebanon, training ground for [[Hezbollah]] fighters,<ref>{{cite paper|title=Anne Dammarell et al. v.

On [[February 7]], [[1984]], President Reagan ordered the Marines to begin withdrawal from Lebanon.

On [[October 25]], [[1983]], only two days later, Reagan ordered U.S. forces to invade [[Grenada]], where a 1979 ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]'' had established a [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] government aligned with the Soviet Union and Cuba. On [[October 13]], a faction led by Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]] seized power. A formal appeal from the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS) led to the intervention of U.S. forces; President Reagan also cited the regional threat posed by a Soviet-Cuban military build-up in the Caribbean and concern for the safety of several hundred American medical students at St. George's University as adequate reasons to invade. In the first major operation conducted by the U.S. military since the [[Vietnam War]], several days of fighting commenced, resulting in a U.S. victory,<ref name= "Invasion of Grenada">{{cite web|publisher=Defense Technical Information Center|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/history/urgfury.pdf|format=PDF|title= Operation Agent Fury|accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref> with 19 American fatalities and 116 wounded American soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cooper, Tom.| url= http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_159.shtml |title=Grenada, 1983: Operation 'Urgent Fury' |date=[[September 1]], [[2003]] |accessdate=2007-04-08 |publisher=Air Combat Information Group}}</ref> In mid-December, after a new government was appointed by the Governor-General, U.S. forces withdrew.<ref name="Invasion of Grenada"/>

Reagan accepted the Republican nomination in [[Dallas, Texas]], on a wave of positive feeling. He proclaimed that it was "morning again in America",<ref name="agpi"/> in reference to the recovering economy and the dominating performance by the U.S. athletes at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics]] that summer, among other things. He became the first American president to open a summer Olympic Games held in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sok.se/inenglish/losangeles1984.4.18ea16851076df63622800011008.html|title=Los Angeles 1984|publisher=Swedish Olympic Committee|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref>

Reagan's opponent in the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]] was former Vice President [[Walter Mondale]]. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, it was questioned whether he was capable to be president for another term.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/editors200410040912.asp|title=The Debate: Mondale vs. Reagan|work=National Review|date=October 4, 2004|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/newshour/84_1stprez-analysis.html|title=Reaction to first Mondale/Reagan debate |publisher=PBS |date=[[October 8]], [[1984]] |accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref> Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, "I will not make age an issue of this campaign.

===Second term, 1985&ndash;1989===
Reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on [[January 20]], [[1985]], in a private ceremony at the [[White House]]. The public ceremony took place in the [[Capitol Rotunda]] the next day, because [[January 20]] fell on a Sunday, thus no public celebration was held. [[January 21]] was one of the coldest days on record in [[Washington, D.C.]], and due to the low temperatures and large snowfall the night before, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol.

[[Image:President Reagan being sworn in for second term in the rotunda at the U.S. Capitol 1985.jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Reagan is sworn in for a second term as president in the Capitol Rotunda]]
In 1985, Reagan visited a [[Germany|German]] military cemetery in [[Bitburg]] to lay a wreath with West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]. It was determined that the cemetery held the graves of 49 members of the [[Waffen-SS]]. Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery "victims", which ignited a stir over whether Reagan had equated the SS men to [[Holocaust]] victims; [[Pat Buchanan]], Director of Communications under Reagan, argued that the notion was false.<ref>{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Pat.|url=http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html|title=Pat Buchanan's Response to Norman Podhoretz's OP-ED|publisher=The Internet Brigade|date=1999|accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref> Now strongly urged to cancel the visit,<ref>Reeves, Richard (2005), p. 249</ref> the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl.

The Reagan administration was criticized for its slow response to the growing [[HIV]]-[[AIDS]] epidemic.<ref name="aids">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/06/08/EDG777163F1.DTL|title=Reagan's AIDS Legacy: Silence equals death|author=White, Allen|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=[[June 8]], [[2004]]|accessdate=2008-04-24}}</ref> As thousands became infected with the virus, President Reagan did not increase funding to try and discover cures, rather he downplayed the situation and only acknowledged that it was an issue of concern at the [[May 31]], [[1987]] Third International Conference on AIDS in Washington.<ref name="aids"/>

====Health and well-being====
On [[July 13]], [[1985]], Reagan underwent surgery at [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] to remove cancerous polyps from his colon. This caused the first-ever invocation of the acting president clause of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/articles/812.html|title=What is the 25th Amendment and When Has It Been Invoked?|publisher=History News Network|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref> The surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful.<ref>Bumgarner, John R.

Two years later, on [[January 5]], Reagan underwent surgery for an enlarged [[prostate]] which caused further worries about his health.

====War on Drugs====
Midway into his second term, Reagan declared more militant policies in the [[War on Drugs]]. He said that "drugs were menacing our society" and promised to fight for drug-free schools and workplaces, expanded drug treatment, stronger law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts, and greater public awareness.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lamar, Jacob V., Jr|title=Rolling Out the Big Guns|work=Time|date=[[September 22]], [[1986]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962371-1,00.html|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://academic.udayton.edu/race/03justice/crime09.htm |title=The Drug War as Race War|accessdate=2007-04-11|author=Randall, Vernellia R.|date=April 18, 2006|publisher=The University of Dayton School of Law}}</ref>

On [[October 27]], [[1986]], Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that budgeted $1.7 billion dollars to fund the War on Drugs and specified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses.<ref name="PBS Frontline">{{cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/cron/|title=Thirty Years of America's Drug War|publisher=|accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref> The bill was criticized for promoting significant racial disparities in the prison population, because of the differences in sentencing for [[Crack cocaine|crack]] and powder [[cocaine]].<ref name="PBS Frontline"/> Critics also charged that the administration's policies did little to actually reduce the availability of drugs or crime on the street, while resulting in a great financial and human cost for American society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/341/reagan.shtml|publisher=Drug Reform Coordination Network|title=The Reagan-Era Drug War Legacy|date=June 11, 2004|accessdate= 2007-04-04}}</ref> Defenders of the effort point to success in reducing rates of adolescent drug use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofacts/HSYouthtrends.html|title=NIDA InfoFacts: High School and Youth Trends|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIH|accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/kleber.html|title=Interview: Dr. Herbert Kleber|accessdate=2007-06-12|publisher=PBS|quote=The politics of the Reagan years and the Bush years probably made it somewhat harder to get treatment expanded, but at the same time, it probably had a good effect in terms of decreasing initiation and use.

[[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]] made the War on Drugs one of her main priorities by founding the "[[Just Say No]]" drug awareness campaign, which aimed to discourage children and teenagers from engaging in [[recreational drug use]] by offering various ways of saying "no". Mrs. Reagan traveled to 65 cities in 33 states, raising awareness about the dangers of drugs and alcohol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4297405/|title=The 'just say no' first lady|publisher=MSNBC|date=February 18, 2004|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>

====''Challenger'' disaster====
[[Image:Reagan Challenger.jpg|thumb|right|Reagan addresses the nation from the [[Oval Office]] regarding the ''Challenger'' disaster]]
The disintegration of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] on [[January 28]], [[1986]] proved a pivotal moment in Reagan's presidency. The shuttle had left [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Florida]] at 11:38 [[Eastern standard time|EST]], and disintegrated 73 seconds after lift off.<ref name="npr-shuttle">{{cite news|publisher=NPR|title=Challenger: Reporting a Disaster's Cold, Hard Facts|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5175151|author=Berkes, Howard|accessdate=2008-04-19|date=[[January 28]], [[2006]]}}</ref> All seven [[astronaut]]s aboard, including [[Christa McAuliffe]], who was to be the first "teacher in space", were killed.<ref name="npr-shuttle"/>

On the night of the disaster, Reagan had been scheduled to deliver his annual [[State of the Union Address]], but he postponed the address and gave a national address from the Oval Office on the ''Challenger'' disaster. The speech was largely written by [[Peggy Noonan]]; Reagan said the following that night:

{{Cquote|The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them...

Historians and commentators largely lauded Reagan's speech;<ref name="presidents-dvd"/> John Robert Greene, Professor of History at [[Cazenovia College]], said "The defining Reagan moment for me was the ''Challenger'' disaster.

====Libya bombing====
{{main|Bombing of Libya}}
Relationships between [[Libya]] and the United States under President Reagan were continually contentious, beginning with the [[Gulf of Sidra incident]] in 1981.

====Immigration====
In 1986, Reagan signed the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Immigration Reform and Control Act]] (IRCA). The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit [[illegal immigrants]], required employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and granted [[amnesty]] to approximately 3 million illegal immigrants who entered the United States prior to [[January 1]], [[1982]] and had lived in the country continuously. Critics of the act claim that its laws subjecting employers to sanctions were without teeth and that it failed to stem illegal immigration.<ref>{{cite news|author=Graham, Otis|date=January 27, 2003|url=http://www.otisgraham.com/otis_graham_writings/art_ronald_reagans_big_mistake.html | title=Ronald Reagan's Big Mistake|work=The American Conservative|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished [[Statue of Liberty]], Reagan said, "The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society.
