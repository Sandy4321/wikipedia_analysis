The '''Forth Road Bridge''' is a [[suspension bridge]] in [[Central Belt|east central]] [[Scotland]]. The bridge, built in 1964, spans the [[Firth of Forth]], connecting the capital city [[Edinburgh]] at [[South Queensferry]] to [[Fife]] at [[North Queensferry]]. The [[toll bridge]] replaced a centuries-old ferry service to carry vehicular traffic, cyclists, and pedestrians across the Forth; rail crossings are made by the adjacent and historic [[Forth Bridge (railway)|Forth Bridge]].

Issues regarding the continued tolling of the bridge, and those over its deteriorating condition and proposals to have it replaced or supplemented by an additional crossing, have caused it to become something of a [[political football]] for the [[Scottish Parliament]].

==History==
The first crossing at what is now the site of the bridge was established in the 11th century by [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], [[queen consort]] of King [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]], who founded a ferry service to transport religious pilgrims from Edinburgh to [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and [[St Andrews]].<ref>[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/cannypublishing/newsletter.html Queensferry History Group, April 2004 newsletter]</ref> Its creation gave rise to the port towns which remain to this day, and the service remained in uninterrupted use as a passenger ferry for over eight hundred years. As early as the 1740s there were proposals for a road crossing at the site, although their viability was only considered following the construction of the first Forth bridge in 1890.<ref>[http://www.feta.gov.uk/webpages/history.php Forth Estuary Transport Authority - About the bridge (history)]</ref>

The importance of the crossing to vehicular traffic was underpinned when the [[Great Britain road numbering scheme]] was drawn up in the 1920s. The planners wished the arterial [[A9 road]] to be routed across the Forth here, although the unwillingness to have a ferry crossing as part of this route led to the [[A90 road|A90]] number being assigned instead.<ref>[http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/1922.shtml List of road numbers assigned by the Ministry of Transport in 1922]</ref>

There was a period of renewed lobbying for a road crossing in the 1920s and 1930s, at which time the only vehicle crossing was a single passenger and vehicle ferry. Sir [[William Denny (shipbuilder)|William Denny]] championed the expansion of that service in the 1930s, providing and operating two additional ferries on behalf of the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] that aimed to supplement the services of the adjacent railway bridge. Their success allowed for the addition of two more craft in the 1940s and 1950s<ref>[http://www.megoran.fsworld.co.uk/Forth%20Ferries.htm "The Withdrawal of the Firth of Forth Paddle Ferries", article dated September 2004]</ref>, by which time the ferries were making 40,000 crossings, carrying 1.5 million passengers and 800,000 vehicles annually.<ref>[http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/queensferry/forthroadbridge/ Undiscovered Scotland - The Forth Road Bridge]</ref>

With the then-newest and nearest bridge spanning the Forth (the [[Kincardine Bridge]], built in 1936) still around fifteen miles upstream, the upsurge in demand for a road crossing between Edinburgh and Fife prompted the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK government]] establish the [[Forth Road Bridge Joint Board]] by [[Act of Parliament]] in 1947 to oversee the implementation of a new bridge to replace the ferry service. The final construction plan was accepted in February 1958 and work began later that year.

[[Mott, Hay and Anderson]] and [[Hyder Consulting|Freeman Fox & Partners]] designed and constructed the bridge at a cost of <U+00A3>11.5 million, while the total cost of the project including road connections and realignments was <U+00A3>19.5 million. Seven lives were lost during construction before the bridge was opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] on [[4 September]] [[1964]].<ref>[http://www.feta.gov.uk/webpages/aboutbridge.php Forth Estuary Transport Authority: About the bridge]</ref> The ferry service was discontinued as of that date. The bridge's management was delegated to the FRBJB, and remained so until 2002 when its operation was transferred to a new body with a wider remit, the [[Forth Estuary Transport Authority]].<ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2002/01/933 <U+201C>New transport body for Forth road bridge<U+201D> Scottish Executive, [[17 January]] [[2001]] ]</ref>

==Statistics==
[[Image:Forth bridge dsc06385.jpg|thumb|left|High-tensile wires suspending the deck of the northbound carriageway.]]
The bridge's central main span is 1006&nbsp;m (3298&nbsp;ft) long, its two side spans are each 408&nbsp;m (1338&nbsp;ft) long, and the approach viaducts are 252&nbsp;m (827&nbsp;ft) on the north side and 438&nbsp;m (1437&nbsp;ft) on the south side; at a total length of 2512&nbsp;m (8242&nbsp;ft), it was the longest suspension bridge outside the [[United States]] and the [[List of largest suspension bridges|fourth-largest in the world]] at the time of its construction. The bridge comprises 39,000 tons of [[steel]] and 115,000 cubic metres of [[concrete]]. Its width comprises a [[dual carriageway]] road with two lanes in each direction bounded by cycle/footpaths on each side. The main strung cables are 590&nbsp;mm in diameter and each carries 13,800&nbsp;tonnes of the bridge's load by suspending 11,618 5&nbsp;mm diameter high tensile wires.<ref>[http://www.feta.gov.uk/webpages/factsfigures.php Forth Estuary Transport Authority: About the bridge (facts and figures)]</ref><ref>[http://www.camvista.com/scotland/panoramas/forthbridges.php3 CamVista.com Panoramas: The Forth Road Bridge]</ref>

The bridge forms a crucial part of the corridor between south-east and north-east Scotland, linking Edinburgh to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Dundee]] and [[Aberdeen]] by the A90 road and its sister [[M90 motorway]] which begins a few miles north of the bridge's northern terminus. The bridge carried around 2.5 million vehicles in its first year but the annual figure has risen steadily over time to around 11.8 million vehicles in 2004 alone. The bridge carried its 250 millionth vehicle in 2002.<ref>http://www.feta.gov.uk/content/view/36/57/]</ref>

It was awarded [[Historic Scotland]]'s [[Listed building#Scotland|Category A listed structure]] status in 2001.

==Tolling issues==
The bridge has been tolled since opening to pay for the cost of construction and maintenance. The current toll is <U+00A3>1 for most vehicular traffic, increased from 80p in October 2005.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3537029.stm "Move to drive up Forth tolls" BBC News, [[5 March]] [[2005]] ]</ref> The toll for buses with over sixteen seats is <U+00A3>1.40, and most goods vehicles pay <U+00A3>2.<ref>[http://www.feta.gov.uk/webpages/bridgetolls.php Forth Estuary Transport Authority: About the bridge (bridge tolls)]</ref>

Initially, it was suggested that tolling would cease once the original cost of construction plus interest accrued had been repaid - this was done in 1993 and tolls were planned for removal by May 1995. However, the legislation enabling the levying of tolls has instead been renewed by Parliament (originally that of the UK but now the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament) on three separate occasions in 1998, 2003 and 2006.<ref>[http://www.notolls.org.uk/scotland.htm National Alliance Against Tolls Scotland]</ref>

Originally, a toll was paid for each direction of travel with sets of toll booths on both carriageways. In 1997, a decision was made to double the northbound toll (then 40p, to 80p) and remove the southbound toll. The belief was that almost all traffic makes a return journey across the bridge, resulting in a reduction of congestion for southbound traffic without reducing overall toll revenues.

The Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) has justified the continued use of tolls by suggesting they are necessary to fund maintenance and improvement works. These include the construction of defences around the submerged piers forming the bases of the main towers in the event of collision in the Firth.<ref>[http://www.feta.gov.uk/webpages/bprojects1.php Forth Estuary Transport Authority: Bridge projects (Tower defences)]</ref> The main towers have also been strengthened with internal steel columns (the original tower structure having been hollow) and had hydraulic rams jack up these sections to transfer a portion of the load to the new steelwork.<ref>[http://www.feta.gov.uk/webpages/bprojects3.php Forth Estuary Transport Authority: Bridge projects (Upgrading of main towers)]</ref> Also, the vertical cables suspending the deck have had their bolts replaced after a single detected failure. A new paint system required development for the bridge (the original having been phased out due to environmental concerns)<ref>[http://www.feta.gov.uk/webpages/bprojects2.php Forth Estuary Transport Authority: Bridge projects (Maintenance painting)]</ref> and the toll plaza and booths have been replaced allowing more comfort for toll-collection staff and the introduction of electronic tolling.

In late 2005, FETA's committee approved a proposal for a complete revamp of the system of toll levies. The minimum toll would be set to the existing <U+00A3>1 figure, but would increase dependent on the time of day, rising to a maximum of <U+00A3>4 for evening rush hour travel. All tolls would be halved for cars with more than one occupant, as an incentive to drivers to share cars and make fewer journeys. According to FETA's chairman [[Lawrence Marshall]], the system would provide the most efficiency, claiming that 80% of peak-time journeys are made by single-occupant vehicles. The proposal, passed with the chairman's casting vote after the committee was deadlocked, was referred to the [[Scottish Executive]] in December 2005, and implementation planned for October 2007 subject to approval by transport minister [[Tavish Scott]]. Environmental groups welcomed the proposal, although local politicians condemned it as simply a means of raising capital. At the same time, a counter-argument was tabled by Fife councillors proposing the complete removal of tolls.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4468800.stm "Bridge board backs <U+00A3>4 toll plan" BBC News, [[25 November]] [[2005]] ]</ref>.

The Scottish Parliament debated the proposals in January 2006, and the affair became a major political issue after Westminster-based [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Alistair Darling]] ([[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] respectively) were seen to describe the variable tolling plan as "dead in the water".<ref>[http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/opinion.cfm?id=145522006 "Not even an election can bridge the gap between Gordon and Jack" Scotland on Sunday, [[29 January]] [[2006]] ]</ref> Scottish [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Jack McConnell]] insisted his [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] colleagues were misquoted and himself refused to rule out the plan, receiving considerable condemnation from the opposition [[Scottish National Party]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4650128.stm "Minister defiant on bridge issues" BBC News, [[26 January]] [[2006]] ]</ref>

The political situation was particularly important given that by late January 2006, campaigning was well underway for a [[Dunfermline and West Fife by-election, 2006|by-election]] scheduled to take place for the Westminster constituency of [[Dunfermline and West Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline and West Fife]] in which the north end of the bridge is situated. The by-election, scheduled for [[February 9]], was contested by - in addition to the major political parties in Scotland - an [[Abolish Forth Bridge Tolls Party]]. It was eventually won by [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] candidate [[Willie Rennie]], overturning a large Labour majority on a 16% [[swing (politics)|swing]].

In the aftermath of the by-election defeat, media speculation suggested the Executive had turned against the proposals, and Tavish Scott eventually confirmed their rejection and the retention of the existing toll structure on [[1 March]]. FETA condemned the decision, while local opposition [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] charged the minister that his tolling review short-changed Fifers as tolls were axed on the [[Erskine Bridge]] leaving tolls on only the Forth and [[Tay Road Bridge]], both in Fife.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=318352006 "Bridge boss furious over decision to freeze tolls" The Scotsman, [[2 March]] [[2006]] ]</ref>

===Abolition===

Following the formation of a SNP minority government after the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|Scottish parliamentary election of May 2007]], a new debate on the abolition of tolls was opened by Transport Minister [[Stewart Stevenson]] on [[May 31]], [[2007]], where it was approved by a unanimous vote. Legislation to remove the tolls is timetabled to be introduced later in the year. Toll levies at that point totalled <U+00A3>16 million annually.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=854702007 "Bridge tolls 'scrapped by the end of the year'" The Scotsman, [[June 1]], [[2007]].]</ref>

==Structural issues==
[[Image:Forth Road Bridge cable inspection.jpg|thumb|right|An inspection of the integrity of the cables underway on the bridge.]]
There has been concern at FETA over the structural wear-and-tear of the bridge. The planned theoretical capacity for the bridge (30,000 vehicles per day) is routinely exceeded as traffic levels have outstripped predictions. FETA predicts the demand will rise to an average of 40,000 vehicles per day by 2010 and the Scottish Executive admit that 60,000 vehicles is not uncommon for weekday travel. This has raised concerns about the lifespan of the bridge, originally planned at 120 years.<ref>[http://www.feta.gov.uk/webpages/statistics.php Forth Estuary Transport Authority: About the bridge (transport statistics)]</ref><ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Transport/Road/TollBridge Scottish Executive's Tolled Bridges review]</ref>

2003 saw an inspection programme launched (at a cost of <U+00A3>1.2 million) to assess the condition of the bridge cables after excessive corrosion was discovered in a number of bridges in the United States of a similar design, size, and era. The study, which was completed in 2004, found that 22 (out of over 11,000) high-tensile steel wires are known to have snapped.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3965643.stm "Forth Road Bridge corrosion found" BBC News, [[29 October]] [[2004]] ]</ref> There have been allegations of poor workmanship on the bridge which, combined with the adverse weather while it was being constructed, has led to speculation that these steel wires have become crossed instead of being parallel as intended.

Further investigation of the implications of this is underway, with a study using listening devices to monitor any further strands snapping and pinpoint their location within the main cables. The traffic loads and worries over corrosion have halved the bridge's predicted lifespan to just 50-60 years; there are fears a ban on heavy goods traffic will be necessary by 2013, due to the severe stress the traffic loading has on the bridge and internal corrosion of the steel cables. A full closure is feared to be necessary by 2020.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=481652005 "Traffic wrecking Forth Road Bridge" The Scotsman, [[5 May]] [[2005]] ]</ref>

A number of options are being considered to increase the bridge's lifespan. These include an extensive [[humidity|dehumidification]] programme to slow the corrosion rate of the cables. Engineering consultants [[Faber Maunsell]] expect to begin work on the project in 2006. The works, if approved, are planned to take two years at a cost of <U+00A3>12 million.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4701914.stm "Study into Forth bridge dry-out" BBC News, [[11 February]] 2006]</ref> As part of the works, some of the corroded cable strands are to be [[rope splicing|spliced]].<ref>[http://www.ndtcabin.com/articles/construction/0501001.php "Severe corrosion found on Forth Bridge cables" NDT Cabin Internet Magazine, [[January 18]] [[2005]]]</ref>

==Proposals for a new Forth Road Bridge==
{{future uk public transportation}} 

[[Image:Wfm db forth bridges.jpg|thumb|right|The Forth Bridges, with the road bridge crossing to the left of the [[Forth Bridge (railway)|rail bridge]].]]
With a complete closure of the existing Forth Road Bridge predicted by approximately 2020 without drastic action, there is a threat of serious economic consequences, due to the strategic importance of the bridge in the Scottish transport network and the estimated 10-year-plus timescale for construction of a replacement.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=127232006 "Time running out for new bridge" The Scotsman, [[26 January]] [[2006]] ]</ref>

Proposals for an additional road crossing had initially been drawn up in the early 1990s, but met stiff opposition from environmentalists and from [[City of Edinburgh|Edinburgh City Council]] on the grounds of the increased traffic it would generate. Following the Labour victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 General Election]], the proposals were shelved; however, they have resurfaced as of 2005, given the concerns over the existing bridge's lifespan. A new bridge or tunnel, either as a complement to the existing bridge or as a complete replacement, is now under consideration by FETA, with its cost estimated at <U+00A3>700 million. There remains considerable opposition to the project on the same grounds as before, particularly from the [[Scottish Green Party]].<ref>[http://www.scottishgreens.org.uk/index.php?id=4579 "Another illogical, expensive, Lib Dem white elephant?" Scottish Green Party, [[29 April]] [[2005]] ]</ref><ref>[http://www.forthrightalliance.org/ ForthRight Alliance campaign against a second Forth Road Bridge]</ref>
