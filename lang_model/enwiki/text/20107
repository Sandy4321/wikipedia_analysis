{{Politics of Rwanda}}
{{update|date=November 2010}}
'''Politics of [[Rwanda]]''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Rwanda]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two chambers of parliament, the [[Senate of Rwanda|Senate]] and the [[Chamber of Deputies of Rwanda|Chamber of Deputies]]. On 5 May 1995, the Transitional National Assembly adopted a new constitution which included elements of the constitution of 18 June 1991 as well as provisions of the 1993 Arusha peace accord and the November 1994 multiparty protocol of understanding.

==Political background==
After its military victory in July 1994, the [[Rwandese Patriotic Front]] organized a coalition government similar to that established by President [[Juv<U+00E9>nal Habyarimana]] in 1992. Called The Broad Based Government of National Unity, its fundamental law is based on a combination of the constitution, the Arusha accords, and political declarations by the parties. The [[MRND]] party was outlawed.

Political organizing was banned until 2003. The first post-war presidential and legislative elections were held in August and September 2003, respectively.

The biggest problems facing the government are reintegration of more than 2 million refugees returning from as long ago as 1959; the end of the [[insurgency]] and [[counter-insurgency]] among ex-military and [[Interahamwe]] militia and the Rwandan Patriotic Army, which is concentrated in the north and south west; and the shift away from crisis to medium- and long-term development planning. The prison population will continue to be an urgent problem for the foreseeable future, having swelled to more than 100,000 in the 3 years after the war. Trying this many suspects of genocide will tax Rwanda's resources sorely.

The current government prohibits any form of discrimination by gender, ethnicity, race or religion. The government has also passed laws prohibiting emphasis on Hutu or Tutsi identity in most types of political activity.
