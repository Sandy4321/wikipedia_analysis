'''Opal''' is an [[amorphous]] form of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] related to [[quartz]], a [[mineraloid]] form, not a mineral. 3% to 21% of the total weight is [[water]], but the content is usually between 6% to 10%. It is deposited at a relatively low temperature and may occur in the fissures of almost any kind of [[rock (geology)|rock]], being most commonly found with [[limonite]], [[sandstone]], [[rhyolite]], [[marl]] and [[basalt]]. 97% of opal is produced in [[Australia]] and is its national gemstone.<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/symbols/gemstone.cfm Australian Government]</ref>

Opal's internal structure makes it [[diffraction|diffract]] light; depending on the conditions in which it formed it can take on many colors. Opal ranges from clear through white, gray, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, magenta, rose, pink, slate, olive, brown, and black.  Of these hues, the reds against black are the most rare, whereas white and greens are the most common. It varies in optical density from opaque to semi-transparent. For gemstone use, its natural color is often enhanced by placing thin layers of opal on a darker underlying stone, like [[basalt]].

==Precious opal==
[[File:WLA hmns Fiery Opal Opalville Mine.jpg|thumb|left|Opals can express every color in the visible spectrum.]]
[[File:Potch.jpg|thumb|left|Potch opal from Andamooka South Australia]]
[[Image:Close-packed spheres.jpg|thumb|left|Precious opal consists of spheres of silica of fairly regular size, packed into close-packed planes that are stacked together with characteristic dimensions of several hundred nm.]]
Precious opal shows a variable interplay of internal colors and even though it is a [[mineraloid]], it does have an internal structure. At micro scales precious opal is composed of silica spheres some 150 to 300 [[nanometre|nm]] in diameter in a hexagonal or cubic [[close-packing|close-packed]] [[crystal structure|lattice]]. These ordered silica spheres produce the internal colors by causing the [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and [[diffraction]] of light passing through the microstructure of the opal.<ref name=Klein>Klein, Cornelis, and Hurlbut, Cornelius S.; 1985, ''Manual of Mineralogy'', 20th ed., ISBN 0-471-80580-7</ref> It is the regularity of the sizes and the packing of these spheres that determines the quality of precious opal. Where the distance between the regularly packed planes of spheres is approximately half the wavelength of a component of [[visible light]], the light of that wavelength may be subject to [[diffraction]] from the [[Diffraction grating|grating]] created by the stacked planes. The spacing between the planes and the orientation of planes with respect to the incident light determines the colors observed. The process can be described by [[Bragg's Law]] of diffraction.

Visible light of diffracted wavelengths cannot pass through large thicknesses of the opal. This is the basis of the optical [[band gap]] in a [[photonic crystal]], of which opal is the best known natural example. In addition, microfractures may be filled with secondary silica and form thin lamellae inside the opal during solidification. The term ''[[opalescence]]'' is commonly and erroneously used to describe this unique and beautiful phenomenon, which is correctly termed ''[[iridescence|play of color]]''. Contrarily, ''opalescence'' is correctly applied to the milky, [[turbidity|turbid]] appearance of common or ''potch'' opal. Potch does not show a play of color.

The veins of opal displaying the play of color are often quite thin, and this has given rise to unusual methods of preparing the stone as a gem.<U+00A0> An opal ''[[doublet (lapidary)|doublet]]'' is a thin layer of opal, backed by a swart mineral such as [[ironstone]], [[basalt]], or [[obsidian]].<U+00A0> The darker backing emphasizes the play of color, and results in a more attractive display than a lighter potch.

Combined with modern techniques of polishing, doublet opal produces similar effect of black or boulder opals at a mere fraction of the price. Doublet opal also has the added benefit of having genuine opal as the top visible and touchable layer, unlike triplet opals.

The triplet-cut opal backs the colored material with a dark backing, and then has a domed cap of clear [[quartz]] or plastic on top, which takes a high polish and acts as a protective layer for the relatively fragile opal. The top layer also acts as a magnifier, to emphasize the play of color of the opal beneath, which is often of lower quality. Triplet opals therefore have a more artificial appearance, and are not classed as precious opal.

==Common opal==

Besides the [[gemstone]] varieties that show a play of color, there are other kinds of common opal such as the [[milk]] opal, milky bluish to greenish (which can sometimes be of gemstone quality), [[resin]] opal which is honey-yellow with a resinous luster, wood opal which is caused by the replacement of the organic material in [[wood]] with opal,<ref>{{cite book|last=Gribble|first=C. D.|title=Rutley's Elements of Mineralogy|publisher=Unwin Hyman|location=London|year=1988|edition=27th ed.|page=431|chapter=Tektosilicates (framework silicates)|isbn=0045490112}}</ref> [[menilite]] which is brown or grey, [[hyalite]] is a colorless glass-clear opal sometimes called Muller's Glass, [[geyserite]], also called [[siliceous sinter]], deposited around [[hot springs]] or [[geyser]]s and [[diatomite]] or [[diatomaceous earth]], the accumulations of [[diatom]] shells or tests.

==Other varieties of opal==
Girasols, more commonly called fire opals are transparent to translucent opals with warm body colors yellow, orange, orange-yellow or red. They do not usually show any play-of-color, although occasionally a stone will exhibit bright green flashes. The most famous source of fire opals is the state of [[Quer<U+00E9>taro]] in Mexico and these opals are commonly called Mexican fire opals. Fire opals that do not show play of colour are sometimes referred to as jelly opals.

Peruvian opal (also called blue opal) is a semi-opaque to opaque blue-green stone found in Peru which is often cut to include the matrix in the more opaque stones. It does not display pleochroism.

Australia produces around 97% of the world's opal. 90% is called 'light opal' or white and crystal opal.  White makes up 60% of the opal productions but cannot be found in all of the opal fields. Crystal opal or pure hydrated silica makes up 30% of the opal produced, 8% is black and only 2% is boulder opal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

The town of [[Coober Pedy, South Australia|Coober Pedy]] in [[South Australia]] is a major source of opal. The world's largest and most valuable gem opal "Olympic Australis" was found in {{Nowrap|August 1956}} at the "Eight Mile" opal field in Coober Pedy. It weighs 17,000 carats (3450&nbsp;grams) and is 11&nbsp;inches long (280&nbsp;mm), with a height of 4<U+00BE>&nbsp;inches (120&nbsp;mm) and a width of 4<U+00BD>&nbsp;inches (115&nbsp;mm).  It is valued at AUD$2,500,000<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.altmanncherny.com.au/The%20Olympic%20Australis.htm The Olympic Australis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Mintabie Opal Fields located approximately 250&nbsp;km north west of [[Coober Pedy]] has also produced large quantities of Crystal opal and also the rarer black opal. Over the years it has been sold overseas incorrectly as Coober Pedy Opal. The black opal is said to be some of the best examples found in Australia.

Andamooka in South Australia is also a major producer of matrix opal, crystal opal, and black opal. Another Australian town, [[Lightning Ridge, New South Wales|Lightning Ridge]] in [[New South Wales]], is the main source of black opal, opal containing a predominantly dark background (dark-gray to blue-black displaying the play of color). Boulder opal consists of concretions and fracture fillings in a dark siliceous [[ironstone]] matrix. It is found sporadically in western Queensland, from Kynuna in the north, to Yowah and [[Koroit opal field|Koroit]] in the south.<ref>[http://www.nrw.qld.gov.au/mines/fossicking/opal.html Queensland opal]</ref> The rarest type of Australian opal is "pipe" opal, closely related to boulder opal, which forms in sandstone with some iron-ore content, usually as fossilized tree roots. Its largest quantities are found around [[Jundah]] in South West Queensland. Australia also has opalised fossil remains,<ref name="Opals Down Under: Opal Fossils">[http://www.opalsdownunder.com.au/learn-about-opals/advanced/opal-fossils Opal Fossils]. Opals Down Under. Retrieved on 2011-03-08.</ref> including dinosaur bones in New South Wales, and marine creatures in South Australia.

[[Image:nev opal09.jpg|thumb|Multi-colored rough opal specimen from Virgin Valley, Nevada, US]]
The Virgin Valley opal fields of [[Humboldt County, Nevada|Humboldt County]] in northern [[Nevada]] produce a wide variety of precious black, crystal, white, fire, and lemon opal. The black fire opal is the official gemstone of Nevada. Most of the precious opal is partial wood replacement. Miocene age opalised teeth, bones, fish, and a snake head have been found. Some of the opal has high water content and may desiccate and crack when dried. The largest black opal in the [[Smithsonian Institution]] comes from the Royal Peacock opal mine in the Virgin Valley.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  

Another source of ''white base opal'' or creamy opal in the United States is [[Spencer, Idaho]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} A high percentage of the opal found there occurs in thin layers.

Other significant deposits of precious opal around the world can be found in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Turkey, Indonesia, Brazil (in [[Pedro&nbsp;II, Piau<U+00ED>]]<ref>[http://www.mindat.org/gallery.php?loc=8782 Boi Morto Mine, Pedro&nbsp;II, Piau<U+00ED>, Brazil<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>), Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Ethiopia.

In late 2008, [[NASA]] announced that it had discovered opal deposits on [[Mars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-198|title=NASA probe finds opals in Martian crevices|accessdate=2008-10-29}}</ref>

==Synthetic opal==
As well as occurring naturally, opals of all varieties have been synthesized experimentally and commercially. The discovery of the ordered sphere structure of precious opal led to its synthesis by Pierre Gilson in 1974.<ref name=Klein/> The resulting material is distinguishable from natural opal by its regularity; under magnification, the patches of color are seen to be arranged in a "lizard skin" or "chicken wire" pattern. Furthermore, synthetic opals do not [[fluorescence|fluoresce]] under [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light. Synthetics are also generally lower in density and are often highly porous.

Two notable producers of synthetic opal are the companies [[Kyocera]] and [[Inamori]] of Japan. Most so-called synthetics, however, are more correctly termed "imitation opal", as they contain substances not found in natural opal (e.g., plastic stabilizers). The imitation opals seen in vintage jewelry are often foiled glass, glass-based "[[Slocum stone]]", or later plastic materials.

==Local atomic structure of opals==
The lattice of spheres of opal that cause the interference with light are several hundred times larger than the fundamental structure of crystalline silica. As a [[mineraloid]], there is no [[unit cell]] that describes the structure of opal. Nevertheless, opals can be roughly divided into those that show no signs of crystalline order ([[amorphous]] opal) and those that show signs of the beginning of crystalline order, commonly termed [[cryptocrystalline]] or microcrystalline opal.<ref>Graetsch, H., "Structural Characteristics of opaline and microcrystalline silica minerals", "Silica, physical behavior, geochemistry and materials applications". ''Reviews in Mineralogy'', Vol. 29, 1994. Editors PJ Heaney, Connecticut Prewitt, GV Gibbs, Mineralogical Society of America</ref> Dehydration experiments and [[infrared spectroscopy]] have shown that most of the H<sub>2</sub>O in the formula of SiO<sub>2</sub><U+00B7>nH<sub>2</sub>O of opals is present in the familiar form of clusters of molecular water. Isolated water molecules, and [[silanol]]s, structures such as Si-O-H, generally form a lesser proportion of the total and can reside near the surface or in defects inside the opal.

The structure of low-pressure polymorphs of anhydrous [[silica]]  consist of frameworks of fully corner bonded tetrahedra of SiO<sub>4</sub>. The higher temperature polymorphs of silica [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] are frequently the first to crystallize from amorphous anhydrous silica, and the local structures of microcrystalline opals also appear to be closer to that of [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] than to quartz. The structures of tridymite and cristobalite are closely related and can be described as hexagonal and cubic [[close-packed]] layers. It is therefore possible to have intermediate structures in which the layers are not regularly stacked.
[[Image:Alphacrist.jpg|thumb|The crystal structure of crystalline <U+03B1>-cristobalite. Locally, the structures of some opals, opal-C, are similar to this.]]

===Microcrystalline opal===
Opal-CT has been interpreted as consisting of clusters of stacking of cristobalite and tridymite over very short length scales. The spheres of opal in opal-CT are themselves made up of tiny microcrystalline blades of cristobalite and tridymite. Opal-CT has occasionally been further subdivided in the literature. Water content may be as high as 10 wt%. [[Lussatite]] is a synonym. Opal-C, also called [[Lussatine]], is interpreted as consisting of localized order of <math>\alpha</math>-cristobalite with a lot of stacking disorder. Typical water content is about 1.5wt%.

===Non-crystalline opal===
Two broad categories of non-crystalline opals, sometimes just referred to as "opal-A", have been proposed. The first of these is opal-AG consisting of aggregated spheres of silica, with water filling the space in between. Precious opal and potch opal are generally varieties of this, the difference being in the regularity of the sizes of the spheres and their packing. The second "opal-A" is opal-AN or water-containing amorphous silica-glass. [[Hyalite]] is another name for this.

Non-crystalline silica in siliceous sediments is reported to gradually transform to opal-CT and then opal-C as a result of  [[diagenesis]], due to the increasing overburden pressure in [[sedimentary]] rocks, as some of the stacking disorder is removed.<ref>[http://minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Articles_Free/1996/Cady_p1380-1395_96.pdf (Cady ''et al.'', 1996)]</ref>

==Naming==
The word ''opal'' is adapted from the Roman term ''opalus'', but the origin of this word is a matter of debate. However, most modern references suggest it is adapted from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''<U+00FA>pala.<ref name=eckert>Allan Eckert, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=vGewAkLkmvIC&pg=PA56 "The World of Opals"], John Wiley and Sons, 1997,pg. 56<U+2013>57</ref>

References to the gem are made by [[Pliny the Elder]]. It is suggested it was adapted it from [[Ops]], the wife of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] and goddess of fertility. The portion of [[Saturnalia]] devoted to Ops was "Opalia", similar to opalus.

Another common claim that the term is adapted from the Greek word, ''opillos''. This word has two meanings, one is related to "seeing" and forms the basis of the English words like "opaque", the other is "other" as in "alias" and "alter". It is claimed that opalus combined these uses, meaning "to see a change in color". However, historians have noted that the first appearances of ''opillos'' do not occur until after the Romans had taken over the Greek states in 180 B.C., and they had previously used the term ''paederos''.<ref name=eckert/>

However, the argument for the Sanskrit origin is strong. The term first appears in Roman references around 250 B.C., at a time when the opal was valued above all other gems. The opals were supplied by traders from  the [[Bosporus]], who claimed the gems were being supplied from India. Before this the stone was referred to by a variety of names, but these fell from use after 250.

==Historical superstitions==
In the Middle Ages, opal was considered a stone that could provide great luck because it was believed to possess all the virtues of each gemstone whose color was represented in the color spectrum of the opal.<ref name=Fernie>{{cite book | last = Fernie | first = William Thomas | title = Precious Stones for Curative Wear | publisher = Bristol, John Wright & Co | year = 1907|pages = 248<U+2013>249}}</ref> It was also said to confer the power of invisibility if wrapped in a fresh [[bay leaf]] and held in the hand.<ref name=Fernie/><ref>{{cite book|title=Wicca Candle Magick|first=Gerina|last=Dunwich|year=1996|pages=84<U+2013>85}}</ref> Following the publication of Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Anne of Geierstein]]'' in 1829, however, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott's novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal [[amulet|talisman]] with supernatural powers. When a drop of [[holy water]] falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death.<ref name=Fernie/> Even as recently as the beginning of the 20th century, it was believed that when a Russian saw an opal among other goods offered for sale, he or she should not buy anything more since the opal was believed to embody the [[evil eye]].<ref name=Fernie/>

Opal is considered the [[birthstone]] for people born in October or under the sign of [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]].
