==History==
On May 25, 2007 it was announced by the [[Northern Pacific Hockey League]] that two expansion teams would begin play during the 2007-08 season, those two teams were the [[Missoula Maulers]] and the '''Rogue Valley Wranglers''''. <ref name="NORPAC Announces Addition of Two Teams">{{cite web |title =NORPAC Announces Addition of Two Teams|url =http://www.thenphl.com/html/full_story.php?nwoffset=5|publisher =NPHL|accessdate =2007-05-25}}</ref> When the Wranglers franchise was announced the [[Northern Pacific Hockey League]] was a Junior B Hockey League, however on July 17, 2007 it was announced that the league would be granted Junior A Tier III status, thus raising the Wranglers from a Junior B team to a Junior A Tier III team. <ref name="Junior A Tier III">{{cite web |title =
NORPAC Officially Granted Tier-III A Status|url =http://www.thenphl.com/html/full_story.php?nwoffset=3|publisher =NPHL|accessdate =2007-07-11}}</ref> Also on July 17, the Wranglers announced the signing of their first player, Robert Reiber, who has since been traded to the [[Eugene Generals]]. <ref name="Wranglers Sign First Player">{{cite web |title =Wranglers Sign First Player|url =http://www.roguevalleywranglers.com/news_breakingnews_reiber_signing.html|publisher =Rogue Valley Wranglers|accessdate =2007-07-17}}</ref><ref name="Wranglers Transactions">{{cite web |title =Stats & Standings|url =http://www.thenphl.com/html/stats___standings.html|publisher =NPHL|accessdate =2007-11-08}}</ref>

The Wranglers began the 2007-08 season, their first, with 25 straight losses, most notably a 23-1 loss to the Seattle Totems on Sat, Nov 17. Unfortunately, the Wranglers were not able to secure their first win until December 7, 2007, by defeating the [[Coeur d'Alene Lakers]] 4-2. Rogue Valley did not have to wait long for their second win as they defeated [[Coeur d'Alene Lakers|Coeur d'Alene]] in a game on the following day, 7-4. The Wranglers finished the second half of the 2007-08 season much like they began, losing 20 of their final 21 games, winning the final game of the season against a familiar opponent, [[Coeur d'Alene Lakers|Coeur d'Alene]], by a score of 5-2. <ref name="Wranglers Schedule">{{cite web |title =Stats & Standings|url =http://www.thenphl.com/html/stats___standings.html|publisher =NPHL|accessdate =2007-12-09}}</ref>

On July 23, 2008, the Wranglers announced that it would host a [[Minor Hockey|Midget U18]] tournament each year beginning in 2008. The first annual Rogue Valley Wranglers Cup is scheduled to begin on September 19 and play through the 21st.<ref name="Wranglers to Host Midget AA Tourney ">{{cite web |title =Wranglers to Host Midget AA Tourney |url =http://www.roguevalleywranglers.com|publisher =Rogue Valley Wranglers|accessdate =2008-07-24}}</ref> Later in the summer of 2008, on August 20, the Wranglers and class-A professional hockey team [[Chi-Town Shooters]] of the [[All American Hockey League (2008-)|All American Hockey League]] announced that Rogue Valley would act as a farm team for the Shooters. <ref name="Shooters Sign Rogue Valley Wranglers as Farm Team">{{cite web |title =Shooters Sign Rogue Valley Wranglers as Farm Team|url =http://www.southshoreshooters.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=36&Itemid=1|publisher =South Shore Shooters|accessdate =2008-08-20}}</ref>

On February 20, 2010, it was announced that the Wranglers had been purchased by Troy Irving and Forest Sexton <ref name="Wranglers under new ownership">{{cite web |title =Wranglers under new ownership|url =http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100220/SPORTS/2200320/-1/SPORTS|publisher = Medford Mail Tribune|accessdate =2010-02-20}}</ref> and that the team would be renamed to the Southern Oregon Spartans.
