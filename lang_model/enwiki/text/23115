'''David Conner "Dave" Treen, Sr.''' (July 16, 1928 &ndash; October 29, 2009), was an American [[attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] and [[politician]] from [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville, St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana]] <U+2013> the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[List of Governors of Louisiana|Governor]] of the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Louisiana]] since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. He was the first Republican in modern times to have served in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from his state. 

A narrow victor in the [[gubernatorial]] [[general election]] held in 1979, Treen served as governor from 1980-84. He lost his bid for reelection in 1983 to his long-time rival, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Edwin Edwards]]. He served in Congress from 1973 to 1980. Treen grew up as a Democrat, but became a Republican in 1962 when there were only about ten thousand registered Republicans in the state. At the time of Treen's death in 2009, only a few other living Louisiana Republicans had exceeded his length of tenure in the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]].  {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Early years and family==
Treen was born in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] to Joseph Paul Treen, Sr. (1900<U+2013>1986), and the former Elizabeth Speir (1899<U+2013>1990).<ref name=ssdi>{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=November 1, 2009}}</ref> He graduated in 1945 from [[Alcee Fortier High School]] in [[New Orleans]]. He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1948 in [[history]] and [[political science]] from [[Tulane University]] in New Orleans. While at Tulane, he was a brother of [[Kappa Sigma]] [[College fraternity|fraternity]]. In 1950, he graduated from [[Tulane Law School]] and was admitted to the bar. In 1951, he wed the former '''Dolores "Dodi" Brisbi''' (November 23, 1929 &ndash; March 19, 2005)<ref name=ssdi/>, a graduate of [[Newcomb College]] in New Orleans, whom he met while he was attending Tulane. He served in the [[U.S. Air Force]] from 1951 to 1952. Treen joined the law firm of Deutsch, Kerrigan & Stiles. He was also a vice president of the Simplex [[Manufacturing]] Corporation of New Orleans from 1952-57. 

The Treens had three children, Jennifer Treen Neville (born ca. 1952), Dr. David C. Treen, Jr. and Cynthia Treen Lunceford (born April 2, 1954), and nine grandchildren. He had two brothers, Joseph Paul Treen, Jr. (deceased) and [[John S. Treen|John Speir Treen]].<ref name=obit>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theadvocate/obituary.aspx?n=gov-david-conner-treen&pid=135263008|title=Gov. David Conner Treen|publisher=''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]''|accessdate=November 1, 2009}}</ref> Treen's eldest grandson, [[Jason Neville|Jason Stewart Neville]] (born May 21, 1979), was one of the founding members of the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] of Louisiana and ran unsuccessfully in 2003 for the Louisiana State Senate.

==States' Rights Party elector candidate, 1960==
In 1960, Treen opposed the election of both [[Richard Nixon]] and [[John F. Kennedy]] as president and ran as an [[US Presidential Electors|elector]] for the Louisiana [[States' Rights Party]], which supported [[Virginia]] Democratic [[U.S. Senator]] [[Harry F. Byrd, Sr.]] In addition to Treen, the States' Rights electors included former State Senator [[William M. Rainach]] of [[Claiborne Parish]] (a defeated 1959 gubernatorial candidate) and [[Plaquemines Parish]] Judge [[Leander Perez]], who was [[excommunicated]] from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] because of his outspoken opposition to racial integration. Another elector was the "Radical Right" figure [[Kent Courtney]] of New Orleans and later [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]]. Still another was the anti-Long former Congressman [[Jared Y. Sanders, Jr.]], of Baton Rouge, son of former Governor [[Jared Y. Sanders, Sr.]]<ref>''Minden Press'', [[Minden, Louisiana]], November 7, 1960</ref>

Treen made it clear that his states' rights group was not affiliated with the [[National States' Rights Party]], a group considered neo-Nazi, and, in Treen's words, "a disgrace to the term 'states rights.'" Treen's elector slate polled 169,572 ballots (21%) statewide. [[Jefferson Parish]], Treen's residence, which would later support him in most of his campaigns, rejected the States' Righters and instead supported Kennedy with 51.8%. Nixon and [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] electors received 230,980 (28.6%) in Louisiana, and Kennedy-Johnson won the state's ten [[electoral votes]] with 407,339 (50.4%).<ref>State of Louisiana, Secretary of State, General election returns for November 8, 1960</ref> One of the Kennedy electors was popular State Attorney General [[Jack P.F. Gremillion]], a part of the [[Earl Kemp Long]] organization, who would fall to  scandal a dozen years later. Another was [[Edmund Reggie]] of [[Crowley, Louisiana]], a confidant of future Governor Edwin Edwards and future father-in-law of Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]].<ref>''Minden Press'', November 7, 1960</ref>

==Republican for Congress, 1962, 1964, and 1968==
Treen joined the Republican Party (GOP), then still small in Louisiana, in 1962 to run for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] against Second District Democrat [[Hale Boggs]] (1914<U+2013>1972), of New Orleans though Treen's father had urged him instead to challenge Boggs for renomination in the Democratic primary. Treen, as a young Democrat in 1956, had supported then Republican congressional nominee [[George R. Blue]] in Blue's failed race against Boggs that year. Blue later switched to the Democrats and won election to the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1964. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Treen joined the Republican Party at a time when it was all but nonexistent in Louisiana. Under the circumstances, Treen was able to raise only $11,000 for his 1962 and polled 27,791 votes (32.8 percent) to Boggs' 57,395 (67.2 percent). {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 1964, Treen again challenged Boggs and improved on his earlier showing, helped by the popularity in Louisiana of the presidential candidacy of U.S. Senator [[Barry M. Goldwater]] and by Boggs' vote for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, even as most Southern Democrats voted against it. In that campaign, Treen polled 62,881 (45 percent) to Boggs' 77,009 (55%). In 1966, Treen did not run for Congress; the GOP fielded the attorney Leonard L. Limes of New Orleans, who was badly defeated by Boggs. So, Treen tried again in 1968<U+2013> his third and final campaign against Boggs, then the House [[majority whip]]. Boggs became majority leader in 1971 and was in line for Speaker. California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] came into the district to campaign for Treen. This time, Treen almost defeated Boggs, receiving 77,633 votes (48.8%) to Boggs' 81,537 ballots (51.2%).  {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Treen attributed Boggs' victory to the supporters of former [[Alabama]] Governor [[George C. Wallace]], who ran for president on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket. Treen claimed that Wallace supporters "became very cool to my candidacy. We couldn't really believe they would support Boggs, but several Democratic organizations did come out for Wallace and Boggs, and he received just enough Wallace votes to give him the election". Treen did not contest the election.  {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==First gubernatorial campaign, 1971&ndash;1972==
{{Main|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1971&ndash;72}}

===Primary opposition from Robert M. Ross===
Treen was challenged in the only Republican gubernatorial [[closed primary]] ever held in Louisiana. His opponent was [[Robert Max Ross]] (August 5, 1933&ndash;September 15, 2009), a native of [[Baskin, Louisiana|Baskin]] in [[Franklin Parish, Louisiana|Franklin Parish]], who grew up in [[Mangham, Louisiana|Mangham]] in [[Richland Parish]] in north Louisiana. Ross graduated from Mangham High School in 1951 and procured a [[bachelor of science]] degree in [[agriculture]] from [[Louisiana State University]] in Baton Rouge. He was commissioned a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Air Force]], fought in the [[Vietnam War]], and was a major in the Air Force Reserves. After his military service, Ross returned to Mangham, where he was involved in a number of small businesses, including a [[mobile home]] park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/dclassifieds?Dato=20090917&Kategori=OBITUARY&Class=30&Type=CAT30200&Lopenr=90900159&Selected=3|title=Obituary of Robert Max Ross|publisher=''[[Monroe News Star]]''|accessdate=September 17, 2009}}</ref> In the 1971 primary, Treen carried the support of the party leadership, including chairman [[Charles deGravelles]] of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]]. Treen received 92 percent of the vote (9,732 votes) to Ross's 8% percent (839 votes). Ross challenged Treen again for governor in 1983 and ran far behind in races for the United States Senate in 1984 and 1986.  {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===1972 general election against Edwin Edwards===
For the general election against Edwards held on February 1, 1972, Treen campaigned vigorously with billboards which said, "Make a Real Change," and television spots too, but he still lost. His chances seemed to improve when the [[American Party (1969)|American Party]] nominee, [[Hall M. Lyons]] (1923<U+2013>1998) of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], a son of GOP pioneer [[Charlton Lyons]] of Shreveport, withdrew after Edwards predicted his own victory based on the premise that Lyons and Treen would split the more conservative vote. Lyons said that his decision to leave the race was intended to allow conservatives to unite behind Treen.<ref>"Lyons Says Conservatives Should Unite With Treen", ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', January 4, 1972, pg. 1</ref>

Treen also shared the Republican ticket with other candidates. [[Morley A. Hudson]] and [[Tom Stagg]], both of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], ran for lieutenant governor and [[attorney general]] respectively, against [[Jimmy Fitzmorris]] and [[William J. Guste]]. [[Robert L. Frye]], a native of [[Webster Parish, Louisiana|Webster Parish]] in northwest Louisiana and a professor at [[Southeastern Louisiana University]] in [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]], ran for state education superintendent against the Democratic nominee [[Louis J. Michot]]. Edwards scoffed at his challenger: "If Treen had been a registered Democrat in the November 6 Democratic primary, he'd have gotten lost in the shuffle. Yet, while his only claim of any kind of legitimacy is that he's a Republican, he deliberately avoids use of the word 'Republican' on any of his campaign paraphernalia. He's apparently ashamed of the fact that he'a a Republican."<ref>Charles Layton, "State Voters Decide Today Whther They Want Change", ''Minden Press-Herald'', February 1, 1972, pg. 1 </ref>

Treen polled 480,424 ballots (42.8%) to Edwards's 641,146 (57.2%) Treen carried twenty-seven parishes, mostly in the northern part of the state, with margins exceeding 60 percent in ten of those parishes. His tally was some 5 percentage points higher than what [[Charlton Lyons]] had scored in 1964 against [[John McKeithen]]. The confident and charismatic Edwards proclaimed that his administration would be an "Era of Excellence". ''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]'' and its sister publication, the former ''Monroe Morning World'' (now ''[[Monroe News Star]]''), analyzed the gubernatorial returns and concluded that Edwards received 202,055 black votes to only 10,709 for Treen. As Edwards' statewide margin was 160,000, the survey concluded that [[African American]]s made the difference. The newspapers said that Treen received some 30,000 more votes from whites than did Edwards. Another source said that Treen, who was named Republican national committeeman after his gubernatorial race, received the backing of 55% of white voters but only 2% among African Americans.<ref>"Treen Named State GOP Committeeman", ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', March 6, 1972, pg. 1</ref>

Numerous Republican legislative candidates ran on the Treen ticket but most outside of Shreveport, Baton Rouge, and Jefferson Parish were defeated. The Treen loyalist [[Bob Reese]], for instance, failed in a state senate race from [[Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana|Natchitoches Parish]] against the Democrat [[Paul L. Foshee]].

==Election to Congress, 1972==
After a decade of service on the Republican State Central Committee, Treen was named as the Louisiana Republican national committeeman for a two-year stint that began in 1972. His friend, [[James H. Boyce]], a Baton Rouge [[industrialist]], served as state party chairman while Treen was national committeeman. Over the years, Treen was the beneficiary of a group of dedicated party officials who worked on his behalf, such as National Committeeman [[Frank Spooner]] of [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]] and National Committeewoman [[Virginia Martinez (Louisiana politician)|Virginia Martinez]] of New Orleans. Martinez was also the treasurer of the national party conventions in 1980 and 1984.<ref>[http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/la/orleans/obits/1/m-07.txt]</ref>

In the fall of 1972, based in part on the strength of his losing gubernatorial race, Treen ran for the open Third District House seat vacated by conservative Democrat [[Patrick T. Caffery]] of [[New Iberia]], the seat of [[Iberia Parish]] in south Louisiana. He was a surprise winner, helped in part by the popularity of the Nixon-[[Spiro Agnew|Agnew]] ticket, which carried sixty-three of the sixty-four parishes (the exception being: [[West Feliciana Parish]]) in traditionally Democratic Louisiana. Treen defeated Democrat J. Louis Watkins, Jr., of [[Houma]], 71,090 (54%) to 60,521 (46%). His home parish of Jefferson helped to push Treen over the top with a 73% share of the vote.

Treen served in the congressional seat from 1973 until 1980, when he resigned to become governor. As a congressman, he voted right-of-center and usually in accord with his party. He was considered a team player among House Republicans. In 1974, Treen won a comfortable reelection in a nationally Democratic year. He defeated State Representative [[Charles Grisbaum, Jr.]], of Jefferson Parish, who became a close friend. Grisbaum later switched parties, and when Treen became governor in 1980, Grisbaum served as one of Treen's floor leaders in the Louisiana House. In 1975, Treen was joined by his first Louisiana Republican colleague in the U.S. House when [[Henson Moore]] (born 1939) won the Sixth Congressional District seat based in and about Baton Rouge and the [[Florida Parishes]]. Moore won the seat formerly held by the Democrat [[John Rarick]]. In 1976, Treen polled 73.3 percent in a race against a nominal Democratic opponent while the Democrat  [[Jimmy Carter]] carried Louisiana over [[Gerald R. Ford]].  {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Election as governor, 1979==
In 1979, Treen filed for the [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] for governor. He finished with  297,469 votes, almost the exact numbers posted by Charlton Lyons in 1964<U+2014>284 fewer votes in fact than Lyons had in a two-candidate field. The second spot was hotly contested between Public Service Commissioner [[Louis Lambert]] of [[Ascension Parish]] (282,708 votes) and outgoing Lieutenant Governor [[Jimmy Fitzmorris|James E. "Jimmy" Fitzmorris, Jr.]], of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] (280,412 votes).

In the Treen-Lambert general election, the defeated Democratic candidates, including the disappointed Fitzmorris, House Speaker [[E. L. Henry]] of [[Jonesboro, Louisiana|Jonesboro]], and State Senators [[Paul Hardy]] of [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]] and [[Edgar G. "Sonny" Mouton, Jr.]], of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], all endorsed Treen. Their support helped him to defeat Lambert by 9,557 votes. Treen received 690,691 (50.3%) to Lambert's 681,134 (49.7%). He won 22 parishes in victory, compared to 27 parishes in defeat in 1972. Only ten parishes that had voted for Treen in 1972 stuck with him in 1979. His strongest parishes in victory were all in south Louisiana: Plaquemines, Lafayette, St. Tammany, and Iberia. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In the losing 1972 campaign, all of Treen's strong parishes were in north Louisiana. The election of 1979 seemed to indicate that Lafayette would in time replace [[Shreveport]] as the new growth center of the Louisiana GOP. Treen's victory came from Republican inroads made in the Edwards stronghold of [[Acadiana]], particularly Lafayette, [[Iberia Parish|Iberia]], [[Terrebonne Parish|Terrebonne]], [[Acadia Parish|Acadia]], and [[St. Martin Parish|St. Martin]] parishes, where the GOP nominee overcame large deficits from 1972 to win in 1979. Treen received only 3.1% of the black vote in victory, nearly identical to his black support in 1972 in defeat.

In March 1980, aged 51, Treen became the 51st governor of his state. He made full use of his power to appoint members of state boards and commissions. He named the Alexandria businessman and [[philanthropist]] [[Roy O. Martin, Jr.]], to the Louisiana Board of Commerce and Industry. He named [[John Henry Baker]] to the Louisiana Athletic Commission, since renamed the Louisiana State Boxing and Wrestling Commission. Martin and Baker were both delegates to the 1980 Republican National Convention in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]].  {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Treen reappointed Shreveport attorney [[Robert G. Pugh]] to the [[Louisiana Board of Regents]] created by the Constitution of 1974, which Pugh had helped to write. Pugh, who was an advisor to Treen on numerous issues, also presented a plan to preserve coastal wetlands through a tax on energy, but the legislature declined to approve it. He appointed [[Robert DeBlieux]], the outgoing Democratic [[mayor]] of Natchitoches as the state's chief preservation officer. DeBleiux had been instrumental in obtaining designation of the [[Natchitoches Historic District]] in the middle 1970s. When Treen assumed office, only 10 of the 105 members of the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisians House of Representatives]] were Republican, and all thirty-nine state senators were Democrats.  {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Accomplishments as governor==
A few hallmarks of the Treen administration were the creation of the [[Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts]], a statewide high school on the campus of [[Northwestern State University]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]] for the gifted, the establishment of the Department of Environmental Quality, and the appointment of more minorities to state positions. Two Treen campaign confidants, [[John H. Cade, Jr.]], of Alexandria and [[William "Billy" Nungesser]] of New Orleans, worked as unpaid advisors in the administration. Cade had also managed Treen's successful congressional races in 1972, 1974, 1976, and 1978. He directed the successful 1979 gubernatorial race as well as the disastrous 1983 reelection attempt. Cade was the Republican state chairman from 1976 to 1978, and Nungesser chaired the GOP central committee as well from 1988 to 1992.<ref>[[Ron Gomez]], ''My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative'', [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Louisiana]]: Zemog Publishing, 2000, ISBN 0-9700156-0-7, pg. 65</ref>

Treen rewarded all of the Democratic gubernatorial candidates who endorsed him. Jimmy Fitzmorris became Executive Assistant for Economic Development. Edgar Mouton was named executive counsel to Treen, but he later abandoned the administration and endorsed the return of Edwin Edwards to the governorship in 1983. Speaker E.L. Henry became the powerful Commissioner of Administration. Louisiana Secretary of State Paul Hardy became secretary of the Department of Transportation and Development, with the former Republican mayor of [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], [[Tom Colten]], as his assistant. Edwards loyalist George Fischer was named secretary of the Department of Health and Human Resources, one of the largest departments in state government.<ref>Ron Gomez, pgs. 65-6</ref> Many of the Democrat legislators remained loyal to Edwards, who operated a "shadow government" from the sidelines. Edwards said on leaving office in 1980 that he was on "a brief, mandated hiatus and would be back" in 1983.<ref>Ron Gomez, pg. 121</ref>

Treen obtained legislative passage of his "Professional Improvement Program" (or PIPs) for public school teachers, but the program was dropped in the next Edwards administration. PIPs allowed instructors to obtain small pay increases for taking college-level courses and/or attending intensive workshops to improve teaching performance. Problems developed when numerous teachers signed up only for classes with few academic requirements and shunned the more rigorous courses. Such action thereby negated the purpose of Treen's reform. 

Treen signed into law a measure authored by State Senator [[Bill Keith (Louisiana politician)|Bill P. Keith]] of Shreveport which required balanced treatment in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] instruction regarding [[evolution]] and [[creation science]]. The measure was struck down in 1987, after Treen had left office, by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in the case ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19870620&id=tbgMAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0GADAAAAIBAJ&pg=4418,4944792|title=<U+201D>Ridicule sparked creationism law<U+201D>|publisher=''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', June 20, 1987|accessdate=November 25, 2009}}</ref>

Treen worked with the Lafayette delegation, including Representatives [[Michael F. "Mike" Thompson|Mike Thompson]] and [[Ron Gomez]], for construction of the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] [[Louisiana's Ragin' Cajuns|Ragin' Cajuns]] stadium, the [[Cajundome]]. Construction began in 1982 and was completed and dedicated late in 1985, by which time Edwards had returned to the office.<ref>Rom Gomez, pgs. 111-2</ref>

During his gubernatorial term, Treen developed a reputation for indecision and micromanagement of details which frustrated supporters and angered adversaries.His failure to push for strong conservative policies and governmental reforms disappointed many Republican allies, as did his refusal to oust from his administration allies of former governor and his past and future rival, Democrat Edwin Edwards. 

Treen had difficulty with the lieutenant governor, Democrat [[Robert "Bobby" Freeman]], a former state representative from [[Plaquemine, Louisiana|Plaquemine]] in [[Iberville Parish]]. Freeman, considered a liberal by Louisiana standards, vowed to exercise gubernatorial powers, as permitted under the state constitution, whenever Treen left the state, either on business or pleasure. In 1983, Freeman supported the return of Edwin Edwards as governor. Freeman easily won re-election in 1983 by defeating Edwards' first lieutenant governor, Democrat-turned-Republican Jimmy Fitzmorris.  {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Treen presided over resumption of use of the [[capital punishment in Louisiana]]. Two convicts were executed by [[electric chair]] during his tenure. 

==Facing Edwin Edwards again, 1983==
Treen and Edwards were known as fierce rivals. During the 1983 election campaign, Edwards remarked that Treen is so slow that "it takes him an hour and a half to watch 60 Minutes". Similarly, when asked for a scenario in which he could lose to Treen, Edwards replied nonchalantly, ''"If I'm caught in bed with either a dead girl or a live boy."'' In 1983, Treen lost to Edwin Edwards, who secured the third of his four terms as governor. In that race, Treen won only a handful of parishes, including rural [[La Salle Parish]] in north Louisiana<U+2013> scene of the [[Jena Six]] case<U+2013> which supported him in all three of his gubernatorial bids. Treen received 586,643 (36.3%) to Edwards' 1,008,282 (62.4%). Another 1.3% was cast for minor candidates, one of whom was Robert Ross, who had also been Treen's primary rival in 1971. Treen polled roughly 104,000 fewer votes in losing in 1983 than he had in winning in 1979. Edwards polled more than 400,000 votes beyond what Louis Lambert had received four years earlier.

[[Billy J. Guin]], a Shreveport Republican leader who managed Treen's northwest Louisiana campaign in 1972, said that Treen refused to show favoritism to anyone and went out of his way to demonstrate fairness to his political opponents. "It got to the point that he would not take phone calls from his longtime supporters because he did not want to tell them 'No'. This of course alienated his own supporters and contributed to his defeat in 1983", Guin said. Guin blamed the legislature, still largely under the domination of Edwards even during the Treen years, for contributing to Treen's defeat.In addition to Treen's own defeat, several Democratic allies of the Republican governor were unseated in the state Senate, including [[Dan Richey]] of [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]] in [[Concordia Parish]] and [[Ned Randolph|Edward G. "Ned" Randolph, Jr.]], of Alexandria in [[Rapides Parish]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Failed nomination to the Fifth Circuit==
After Treen's defeat for governor, President Reagan nominated him on July 22, 1987 for a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] in New Orleans created by the death of veteran Judge [[Albert Tate, Jr.]] However, the appointment was delayed by Democratic senators on the [[U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee]]<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD71E3EF930A15754C0A961948260 "Ex-Louisiana Leader To Be Named a Judge"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 23, 1987</ref> who objected to Treen's past membership in the [[States' Rights Party]] and also to other unsubstantiated allegations. Treen withdrew his name from consideration in late April 1988, saying that he ''"could not afford to defer my professional and business activities"'' any longer, and that ''"some persons on the Democrat-controlled committee would just as soon see the vacancy go unfilled until after the election....in the hope that a Democrat will succeed to the White House."'' {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} However, the Senate wound up confirming Reagan's second choice, attorney [[John Malcolm Duh<U+00E9>, Jr.]], a [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]], later Lafayette, lawyer, who was the son-in-law of New Orleans Congressman F. Edward Hebert and former law partner of retired 3rd District Congressman Patrick T. Caffery. Another of Congressman Caffery's former law partners, Eugene Davis, was named to the federal bench in 1976 by President Gerald Ford and now sits on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, where Duh<U+00E9> had served. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} 

==Other political bids considered==
Nonetheless, Treen maintained political ambitions even after his landslide defeat for re-election as governor. In 1984, he filed candidacy papers to oppose U.S. Senator [[Bennett Johnston]], but quickly withdrew from the race, apparently when polls showed the popular Johnston unbeatable even in a potentially national Republican year. Treen considered, but decided against making, gubernatorial bids in 1991, 1995, and 2003.

==Treen endorses Edwards==
In 1991, despite their differences, Treen endorsed Edwards' bid for a fourth term because the Republican choice in the state's jungle primary fell on former [[Ku Klux Klan]]sman and state Representative [[David Duke]], by then a [[perennial candidate]] who was troublesome to the GOP and the business community. Though Duke claimed to have ended his ties to the KKK, there was lingering suspicion that he was still in contact with neo-Nazi, anti-Semitic, and other radical elements. Ironically, Duke won his single victory for public office, a seat in the state House of Representatives, by narrowly defeating Treen's brother, [[John S. Treen]], a home builder in Jefferson Parish. Many Republicans blamed John Treen's lackluster campaign in that race for Duke's emergence as a major player in the 1990 [[U.S. Senate]] race, when he made a noticeable bid against incumbent Johnston, and in the 1991 gubernatorial election, when Duke secured a general election berth. A new [[interest group]], the [[Louisiana Coalition against Racism and Nazism]], appeared to fight the Duke gubernatorial candidacy. Among its leaders was the Republican political activist and longtime Treen supporter, [[Beth Rickey]] of New Orleans. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} 

==Congressional comeback attempt fails by 1,812 votes==
In 1999, Treen attempted a political comeback by running for the U.S. House. By this time, his home in Mandeville had been drawn into the 1st District. That seat was being vacated by Representative [[Bob Livingston]], who left Congress in a sex scandal amid the House vote on the [[impeachment]] of President [[Bill Clinton]]. This was the eighth election that Treen's name appeared on a Louisiana ballot for Congress.

In the special election with David Duke, also trying to score a comeback, and Republican state Representative [[David Vitter]], Treen finished first with 36,719 votes (25%) to Vitter's 31,741 (22%) and Duke's 28,055 (19%). (Six other candidates, including New Orleans businessman [[Rob Couhig]], shared the remaining 33% of the votes cast.) In the low-turnout special election runoff, Vitter defeated Treen, 61,661 ballots (51%) to 59,849 (49%), a margin of 1,812 votes. The race against Vitter was a bitter contest, with attacks flying back and forth. Many of Vitter's colleagues in the state legislature, including Republicans, supported Treen and charged that Vitter was difficult to work with as a legislator. Duke endorsed Treen over Vitter, perhaps to get back at Treen, hoping to defeat him, because Treen had supported Edwards against Duke in 1991. Vitter ultimately won the seat. In 2005, Vitter left the House to become the first Republican to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Louisiana since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].  {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} 

==Treen in retirement==
Treen declared that he would run for governor again in the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 2003|2003 election]], at the age of 75, but the party leadership coalesced behind [[Bobby Jindal]]. Treen withdrew from the pre-primary race and worked for Jindal's election. Jindal lost the general election to Democratic Lieutenant Governor [[Kathleen Babineaux Blanco]] of Lafayette (who actually lost [[Lafayette Parish]] in the election). A year later, Jindal filled the House seat that Vitter vacated to become senator, the same seat that Treen had lost in his last campaign for elective office. Treen even discussed running for governor again in 2007 but never filed candidacy papers. In 2007, Jindal won the governor's election outright in the primary. Treen's old rival and reluctant ally, Edwin Edwards, meanwhile, went to prison for racketeering connected with his fourth gubernatorial term, the one that Treen had reluctantly blessed in preference to his greater nemesis, David Duke. Treen had urged then President [[George W. Bush]] to pardon Edwards or to commute his sentence to the time already served. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} 

There was also speculation that Edwards actually voted for Treen in the 1979 election because he preferred to face Treen again in 1983, rather than the other Democratic possibilities who were running for governor against Treen. Earl Long similarly often quietly voted for the "anti-Long" gubernatorial candidate himself to set up a potential new governor for failure. Long would then run for governor again four years later against the "failed" (in Long's eyes) governor's stand-in. That was before Louisiana governors could succeed themselves in office.
{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In 1997, Treen became the first Republican inducted into the [[Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [http://www.cityofwinnfield.com/museum.html Winnfield].

==2008 Congressional bid==
Treen announced on October 23, 2007, that he would be a candidate in the March 8 [[Louisiana's 1st congressional district special election, 2008|special election]] to succeed [[Bobby Jindal]], who was elected governor. He cited his experience and political ties in Washington, D.C. as reasons for his candidacy.<ref>[http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?/base/news-5/119311923630980.xml&coll=1 Treen to seek Jindal's 1st District House seat], October 23, 2007</ref>

Treen had lost a race for this same seat in a 1999 special election to current [[U.S. Senator]] [[David Vitter]]. Four Republicans filed for the seat, and two faced an April 5 runoff election restricted to registered party members: State Representative [[Tim Burns (Louisiana politician)|Tim Burns]] and State Senator [[Steve Scalise]]. Scalise won the runoff and a month later defeated Democrat Gilda Reed, a favorite of organized labor and the party's constituent groups.

Treen withdrew from consideration on January 28.<ref>[http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/01/treen_passes_on_congressional.html Campaign watch: Two quit race for Jindal seat in U.S. House], ''[[The New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'', January 28, 2008</ref> Treen endorsed the reelection of Democratic U.S. Senator [[Mary Landrieu]] in her 2008 race against Republican state [[Treasurer]] [[John Neely Kennedy]], who resided in Mandeville, where Treen lived at the time.<ref>Mike Hasten, "Kennedy, Landrieu push for votes as Senate showdown approaches", ''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Daily Town Talk]]'', November 4, 2008: http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20081104/NEWS01/311040037</ref>

==Death==
Treen died from complications from a [[respiratory illness]] at [[East Jefferson General Hospital]] in Metairie.<ref>[http://www.wdsu.com/politics/21462922/detail.html Former Louisiana Gov. Dave Treen Dead At 81], October 29, 2009</ref> Condolences and kinds words poured in from around the state, typified by [[Southeastern Louisiana University]] president [[John L. Crain]]'s tribute that Treen "was a true Louisiana icon, a Republican governor in Louisiana before it was cool". His body lay in state at the [[Louisiana State Capitol]] following a memorial service on November 2, 2009. A second memorial service was held at St. Timothy United Methodist Church in [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]] on November 3. The family requested memorials to, among several charities, the Methodist Children's Home in Mandeville.<ref name=obit/> 

Republican State Chairman [[Roger F. Villere, Jr.]], of Metairie called the former governor "a courageous man who loved our country and our state. He fought the political establishment in the 1960s and 1970s when it was very difficult to elect a Republican in our state, and his career in political office was marked with integrity and fiscal discipline. It is important for younger voters to understand that Louisiana's commitment to high ethical standards and the existence of a viable two-party system in our state are relatively new developments. Just a quarter century ago, neither existed in a significant way. Dave Treen laid the foundation to change all that, and for that, millions of Louisiana citizens owe him a profound debt of gratitude."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lagop.com/2009/10/statement-from-chairman-villere-following-the-death-of-david-treen/|title=Statement from Chairman Roger Villere Following the Death of David Treen|publisher=lagop.com|accessdate=November 8, 2009}}</ref>
