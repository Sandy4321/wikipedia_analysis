The series premiered in the United Kingdom on [[BBC Radio 4]].

==Production==
===Development===
The development of the series began with the production [[pilot episode]], written by Graham Duff and produced by Baby Cow Productions in March 2003.<ref name="hammer">{{cite web|url=http://www.unofficialhammerfilms.com/interviews/gd.html|title=Interviews: Graham Duff (2005)|first=Robert|last=Simpson|publisher=Unofficial Hammer Films Site|date=2005-01-20|accessdate=2007-03-18}}
</ref> The episode, which eventually became "[[List of Nebulous episodes#First series|Night of the Vegetarians]]", featured much of the final cast, but with a number of differences: a different actor played [[List of characters from Nebulous#Rory Lawson|Rory]], and [[List of characters from Nebulous#Sir Ronald Rolands|Sir Ronald Rolands]] was voiced by Duff, while [[List of characters from Nebulous#Gemini|Gemini]] originally had two voices: a female voice played by [[Julia Dalkin]], and a male voice by [[Nicholas Briggs]].<ref name="duff">{{cite web|url=http://nebulouscity.com/Graham%20Duff%20Interview.doc|title=Graham Duff Interview|publisher=Nebulous City|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref><ref name="cult">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2005/01/06/16362.shtml|title=Nick's Nebulous Notes|publisher=BBC Cult Television|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> Malcolm Boyle - who wrote the Nebulous theme and edited the pilot - had written an entire original score for the show. However due to BBC radio budget limitations, this was not used in the completed series. Nicholas Briggs had also originally created a very deep, realistic [[soundscape]], similar to those he had created for the [[Big Finish Productions]] [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish|''Doctor Who'' audioplays]], but was advised that "it's likely the listener will have distractions and will not listen to it more than once; therefore, the soundscape must be totally accessible from any point in the episode", toning down the sound effects to match the series' comic nature.<ref name="briggs">{{cite web|url=http://nebulouscity.com/Nick%20Briggs%20Interview.doc|title=Nicholas Briggs interview|publisher=Nebulous City|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>

===Recording===

The Moat Studios in [[London]] record ''Nebulous'' in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]],<ref name="PL"/> with each half-hour episode typically taking one day to record, including [[read-through]] and [[rehearsal]].<ref name="duff"/> Nicholas Briggs produces the sound, using a combination of [[synthesizer|synthesised effects]] from a [[Roland SH-101]] and [[Foley artist|foley]] [[sound effect]]s.<ref name="cult"/> Briggs also carries out the [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|studio editing]] in order to bring the 30-minute episodes down to the 28 minutes mandated by the BBC to allow time for [[Radio commercial|radio trailers]] between programmes.<ref name="briggs"/>

==Plot==
{{main|List of Nebulous episodes}}

===Setting===
Set in the year 2099, the series depicts the [[Earth]] as very different from today. Following a number of environmental disasters, such as "the Withering"&nbsp;&ndash; which resulted in the loss of a great deal of human knowledge including the [[vacuum cleaner]] and [[fire]] (although the latter came back fairly quickly)&nbsp;&ndash;  and a "Cattle-clasm" that killed off most of the livestock,<ref name="vegetarian">{{cite episode | title = Night of the Vegetarians | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#First series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2005-01-06 | season = 1 | number = 1 }}</ref> the Earth has been reduced to a wasteland separated between "Withered Zones" and the remaining inhabitable areas.<ref name="lovely">{{cite episode | title = The Lovely Invasion | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#First series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2005-01-13 | season = 1 | number = 2 }}</ref> The Withering shifted the Earth into a new orbit, resulting in disruption to the seasons and a reformed calendar. Every day of the week is now 25-hours long except for Thursday (which, due to time anomalies, has not occurred in over a decade),<ref name="past">{{cite episode | title = The Past Must be Destroyed| episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#Third series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2008-05-22 | season = 3 | number = 2 }}</ref> while the change in the length of the year led to the creation of new months such as Janril, Febtober, and Marchuary. In addition, the dreary season of Hamble was created, which is permanently dark, cold and [[drizzle|drizzly]].<ref name="polished">{{cite episode | title = The Man Who Polished The Sun | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#First series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2005-02-10 | season = 1 | number = 6 }}</ref> The Withering resulted in [[vegetarians]], [[pigeons]] and [[homosexuality|gays]] becoming [[endangered species]],<ref name="vegetarian"/> and completely wiped out [[prostitutes|tarts]].<ref name="dust">{{cite episode | title = The Dust Has Landed | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#First series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2005-01-20 | season = 1 | number = 3 }}</ref>

The Earth's geography is also radically altered. A new [[mountain range]] was formed in Britain by a day-long [[ice age]], and the Earth now has twelve and a half [[continent]]s. Many locations have been displaced and reduced to islands, including [[Oxford University]]<ref name="dust"/> and the London borough of [[Deptford]], which is now in the Indonesian Ocean as a part of the Cockney Islands.<ref name="deptford">{{cite episode | title = The Deptford Wives | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#Second series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2006-04-05 | season = 2 | number = 1 }}</ref> The [[solar system]] is equally altered: [[Jupiter]] has been deep fried by [[Harry Ramsden's]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Neptune]] have been knocked together, and there was an initiative to destroy the [[Moon]], which according to the show was deleterious to the [[nightlight]] industry.<ref name="destinoyd">{{cite episode | title = The Destiny of the Destinoyd | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#Second series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2006-04-26 | season = 2 | number = 4 }}</ref>

[[Religion]] also exists in the ''Nebulous'' universe. Pieced together following the Withering, theologians conclude that there were four true deities: the evil twins [[Yin and Yang]], [[Feng Shui]] the destroyer, and merciful Bod, based on the children's television programme ''[[Bod (series)|Bod]]'';<ref name="colour">{{cite episode | title = Madness Is A Strange Colour | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#First series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2005-01-27 | season = 1 | number = 4 }}</ref> the theme tune of which has become a [[hymn]], sung in [[Gregorian chant]].<ref name="cult"/> Bod is analogous to [[God]], hence the commonly-used phrase "[[wiktionary:oh my God|Oh my Bod]]!"

===Storyline===

''Nebulous'' follows the adventures of the eco-troubleshooting team "KENT" (the ''Key Environmental Non-Judgemental Taskforce'', named after the [[Ceremonial counties of England|English county]] of [[Kent]]). The group is directed by Professor Nebulous toward the goal of restoring a natural balance to Earth. However, they are woefully under-funded; KENT was forced to open a laundry to supplement funds.<ref name="coincidence">{{cite episode | title = The Coincidence Machine | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#First series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2005-01-03 | season = 1 | number = 5 }}</ref> There is at least one other eco-troubleshooting team based in England, but despite their common goals they have a less-than-hospitable view of each other. LOUGHBOROUGH (the ''Legitimate Organisation Undertaking General Humanitarian Business Operations Requiring Optimum Unconditional Global Harmony'', named after the [[Leicestershire]] town [[Loughborough]]) is run by Professor Nebulous<U+2019> ex-love interest, Doctor Erica Flazenby. By comparison to KENT it is over-funded and well-equipped, with [[Raygun|bazers]], [[black helicopter]]s and info pills, which provide the user with information by ingestion.<ref name="dust"/>

''Nebulous'' both [[parody|parodies]] and pays [[homage]] to several well known science fiction programmes and films in both its setting and plotlines, often incorporating several different elements within a single story: Professor Nebulous himself is similar to [[Bernard Quatermass]],<ref name="duff"/> a British [[scientist]] who led a research group and fought [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]] in the classic science fiction serial ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'' and its sequels. KENT itself is based partly on the Department of Measurement of Scientific Work, nicknamed "Doomwatch", the eponymous organisation from the BBC [[science fiction on television|science fiction television programme]] ''[[Doomwatch]]'', and partly on the Doctor Who Organization "U.N.I.T", otherwise known as the "[[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce]]".<ref name="msn">{{Cite web|url=http://groups.msn.com/Gallifrey/markgatissinterview.msnw|title=Mark Gatiss|publisher=Gallifrey [[MSN Groups|MSN Group]]|first=James|last=Ellis|date=6 January 2005|accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref> The second episode of series one, "[[List of Nebulous episodes#First series|The Loverly Invasion]]"<!-- The Loverly Invasion is the correct spelling-->, is a direct spoof of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Claws of Axos]]",<ref name="who">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2005/01/06/16359.shtml|title= Nebulous Who|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=6 January 2005|accessdate=2007-03-21|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070204093918/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2005/01/06/16359.shtml <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2007-02-04}}</ref> while "[[List of Nebulous episodes#Second series|The Deptford Wives]]" takes both its name and premise from ''[[The Stepford Wives]]'' (and also borrows from ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unofficialhammerfilms.com/articles/prev_nebulous2_01.html|title=Nebulous Series 2 Preview|publisher=Unofficial Hammer Films Site|accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref>  From the first episode of series 3 onwards, this also began to include the recent ''Doctor Who'' spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'' and the ITV series ''[[Primeval]]'', with references to "baby dinosaurs falling through a hole in time" and "the sheer amount of paranormal activity in the Cardiff area alone ... starting to threaten the Earth's plausibility shield".  Episode 6 of that series also parodied the tendency in British sci-fi for attempts to take over the world to start in Britain, with the chief villain (played by [[Tenth Doctor]] actor [[David Tennant]]) stating "Funnily enough, that's a tax thing", as well as one of the [[Ninth Doctor]]'s nicknames, [[q:Ninth Doctor#The Parting of the Ways .5B1.13.5D|"the oncoming storm"]] (with Nebulous known as "the oncoming drizzle").

==Reviews==

Reception to ''Nebulous'' was generally positive: a reviewer from ''[[The Times]]'' described the first series as "a winning blend of Doomwatch, Quatermass and British silliness that has cult written all over it",<ref name="times1"/> while the second series was described as "cool and [[Cult radio|cultish]]".<ref name="times2"/> However, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was more guarded, comparing the show to "[[Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy|Hitchhiker's]] without the philosophy or [[Red Dwarf]] without the energy", going on to say that show is "funny, but not seriously so".<ref>{{cite news|url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/01/11/bvgill11.xml|title= A gloriously pompous production|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=11 January 2005|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> A reviewer for ''Doctor Who'' website UnitNews also initially expressed concerns about the level of jokes in the show, but later claimed "I should have been more patient because when they did arrive, coinciding with the introduction of the character Harry, they were relentlessly funny".<ref>{{cite news|url =http://www.seenit.co.uk/nebulous-bbc-audio/0177/|title= Nebulous review: BBC Audio|publisher=UnitNews|date=20 February 2007|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>
