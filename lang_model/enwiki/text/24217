'''Jubilee Library''' is the main public library serving the English city of [[Brighton and Hove]].  It forms the centrepiece of the Jubilee Square development in central Brighton<U+2014>a <U+00A3>50 million scheme to regenerate a 40-year-old [[Brownfield land|brownfield site]].  Opened in 2005 by the [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]] and subsequently visited by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], the library has won many design awards and has been described as "a triumph",<ref name="Antram28">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=28.}}</ref> "the most important public building constructed in Brighton since the [[Royal Pavilion]]" and "the superhero [that] saved the city".<ref name="NEB165">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=165.}}</ref><ref name="HP-27022005">{{cite web|url=http://www.hughpearman.com/articles5/brightonlibrary.html|title=Regeneration by the book: Brighton's public library heals the urban fabric (originally published as "All Booked Out")|last=Pearman|first=Hugh|date=27 February 2005|work=Gabion website (originally published in [[The Sunday Times]])|publisher=[[News International]]|accessdate=11 October 2011}}</ref>  In terms of visitor numbers and loans, the library is one of the busiest in England.

Before 2005, the seaside resort of Brighton did not have a purpose-built central library, but there had been attempts to create one for more than a century.<ref name="NEB161">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=161.}}</ref>  After several proposals in the postwar period came to nothing<U+2014>including elaborate schemes which would have combined a library with ice rinks, exhibition halls, car parks and other developments<U+2014>funding was secured in the late 1990s through the newly introduced [[Private finance initiative]].  A suitable derelict site already existed in the centre of Brighton, and a competitive tender process identified finance providers, architects and building contractors.  The new library, the first part of the Jubilee Square scheme to be finished, was ready on time and on budget in 2005, and superseded a temporary library which had replaced the 100-year-old facilities in 1999.

The new library brings together facilities previously housed in separate sites, and offers extensive IT facilities, a large [[LGBT]] literature collection and various social and community activities.<ref name="NEB162<U+2013>163">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|pp=162<U+2013>163.}}</ref>  Several pieces of art were commissioned for the building and its environs.  The building has been described as one of the most energy-efficient structures in England<U+2014>its [[carbon footprint]] is half that of a traditional public building of comparable size, and natural energy is used throughout.

==History==
===Libraries in Brighton===
[[File:The Dome, Church Street - geograph.org.uk - 231199.jpg|thumb|left|From 1889, the main library occupied the buildings on the left.  The grey building in the right background housed the music library.]]
Brighton, now part of the city of Brighton and Hove, developed as a high-class seaside resort in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Private and [[Subscription library|subscription libraries]] were quick to appear: they catered for rich visitors and performed a secondary function as fashionable social venues.  The first, on [[Old Steine]], opened in 1760 and survived until 1856.  Others had thousands of volumes in stock.<ref name="NEB177">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=177.}}</ref>

From 1841, the [[Royal Albion Hotel]] (opened in 1826)<ref name="Musgrave216">{{Harvnb|Musgrave|1981|p=216.}}</ref> housed the Royal Literary and Scientific Institution, which served as the town's public reading room, museum and and public lecture theatre.  In 1869, the Institution gave its collection to Brighton Corporation, which used the books to establish a public library.<ref name="NEB161"/><ref name="Musgrave216<U+2013>217">{{Harvnb|Musgrave|1981|pp=216<U+2013>217.}}</ref>  At first, this was stored in the [[Royal Pavilion]], but the facility outgrew its few rooms and the Corporation converted the Pavilion's former stables and servants' lodgings into a library.  This opened on 12 September 1873.<ref name="NEB161<U+2013>162">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|pp=161<U+2013>162.}}</ref>  Further growth in the stock of books meant that a new temporary facility was opened nearby on Church Street in 1889; this was rebuilt in 1901<U+2013>02 and reopened as the home of Brighton's reference and lending collections on 5 November 1902.  Separate children's and music libraries followed later in different buildings.<ref name="NEB162">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=162.}}</ref>  The main library was housed in former stables which had been built in the 1830s by Joseph Good as an extension to [[William Porden]]'s original Royal Pavilion estate buildings of 1803, which later became the [[Brighton Dome|Dome Theatre and Corn Exchange complex]].<ref name="BoB30<U+2013>31">{{Harvnb|Brighton Polytechnic. School of Architecture and Interior Design|1987|pp=30<U+2013>31.}}</ref>

===The Jubilee Street site===
[[File:Vantage Point, Brighton (Geograph Image 2531996 35b5ccd9).jpg|thumb|right|Vantage Point, an office block in the [[New England Quarter]], was used as a temporary library while Jubilee Library was being built.]]
Several plans were made in the 20th century for a new purpose-built library, often in conjunction with other developments: a combined car park, exhibition centre and library in 1964, a building incorporating a swimming pool in 1973, and in 1986 a mixed-use commercial and residential development with a library set below an ice rink.<ref name="NEB162"/>  The most likely site in the late 1980s and early 1990s became the Music Library building and the adjacent former courthouse, on the opposite side of Church Street to the main library, but funding was not forthcoming.  Meanwhile, a large site behind Church Street, centred on Jubilee Street, had stood derelict since the former Central National Voluntary School and other buildings were demolished in 1971.<ref name="NEB162"/>  The first suggestion that a central library should be built on this land was made in 1991.<ref name="Antram65">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=65.}}</ref>

Brighton and Hove became a joint [[unitary authority]] in 1997, and the newly constituted Brighton & Hove Council applied for funding for a new library through a [[private finance initiative]] (PFI).  The Government agreed to this in May 1998, and in January 1999 the council issued an [[Call for bids|invitation to tender]] for bidders for the contract to design and build the new library and associated buildings on the {{convert|4.3|acre|ha|adj=on}} site.<ref name="NEB162"/>  In December 1999, three bids were shortlisted from those submitted, and in November 2000 property and infrastructure finance company Mill Group Consortium's joint bid with Norwich Union [[Public<U+2013>private partnership|PPPF]] was successful in winning the PFI contract.  At the same time, [[Bennetts Associates]] and Brighton-based architects Lomax Cassidy & Edwards won the design contract, and construction firm [[Balfour Beatty#History|Rok plc]] were chosen to build the library.  The contract was signed on 31 March 2001.<ref name="NEB162"/>

From the start, the new library was intended to be the focus of a large-scale mixed-use development which involved the creation of a new pedestrianised piazza<ref name="Antram65"/> and the reinstatement as a through route of Jubilee Street, severed when the surrounding derelict land became a makeshift car park.<ref name="NEB162"/>  (The street was laid out in the 1840s across Jubilee Field, so named when a wealthy resident's free party for the town's poor people to celebrate [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III's]] Jubilee in 1809 brought in so many people that they spilled out of the Royal Pavilion stables and on to the adjacent field.)<ref name="NEB165"/>  The name ''Jubilee Library'' was chosen to reflect this;<ref name="NEB162"/><ref name="HP-27022005"/> a councillor's suggestion of ''[[Thabo Mbeki]] Library'', in reference to the then incumbent South African President's period of study at the [[University of Sussex]], was rejected.<ref name="NEB162"/>

The library on Church Street closed in mid-1999 after a century of use.  The stock was then moved to a 1960s former office building, Vantage Point, in the area near [[Brighton railway station]] which is now covered by the [[New England Quarter]] development.  It was inconvenient and remote from the city centre, but no other building was available at short notice that could hold all the stock.<ref name="NEB162"/>  The Music Library, which had occupied a building on Church Street since 1964, moved there at the same time; the Local Studies collection was then put in the Church Street building until 2003.<ref name="NEB178">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=178.}}</ref>  Vantage Point was open to the public until 30 October 2004.<ref name="BHBF-VP">{{cite web|url=http://www.brightonbusiness.co.uk/htm/ni20041008.130308.htm|title=Brighton<U+2019>s new library to open in March 2005|date=8 October 2004|publisher=Brighton & Hove Business Forum|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="BHCC-PR-06102004">{{cite press release|title=Date for new library opening|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council|date=6 October 2004|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=b1149084&action=show_pr&id=143661|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref>

===Opening===
Work on the <U+00A3>14 million building started in November 2002<ref name="NEB162"/> and finished on 29 November 2004, in line with its schedule and budget.<ref name="NEB163"/>  Staff and stock transferred to the new library immediately, and on 15 February 2005 [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]] officially opened it.  The public opening was on 3 March 2005<U+2014>that year's [[World Book and Copyright Day|World Book Day]].<ref name="NEB163"/>  It was immediately popular with residents and visitors: 2,000 people entered the building in its first two hours, and it became so crowded that the doors had to be closed temporarily and the toilets stopped flushing from overuse.<ref name="NEB163"/>  Within two weeks, 3,000 new members joined, and numbers were still high six months later: about 16,500 joiners were recorded in that time.  Visitor and loan numbers by November 2005 greatly exceeded the average numbers during the Vantage Point period: about 358,000 visits were recorded and 336,000 items were lent.<ref name="BHCC-PR-03112005">{{cite press release|title=Jubilee development will earn city millions|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council|date=3 November 2005|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=b1149084&action=show_pr&id=158587|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref>  By the end of its first year, the library had 810,000 visits and 23,000 new members.<ref name="NEB164">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=164.}}</ref>  [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] visited the library on her full-day tour of the city in March 2007.<ref name="NEB163"/><ref name="BBC-08032007">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/6429723.stm|title=Royal couple visits seaside city|date=8 March 2007|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref>

By January 2008, Jubilee Library was the fifth most visited public library in England, behind only [[Birmingham Central Library]], [[Manchester Central Library]], [[Croydon Central Library]] and the [[The Forum, Norwich|Norfolk & Norwich Millennium Library]]<U+2014>all of which serve much larger regional populations.  In 2007, 900,000 visits were recorded.  In the same year, the library lent about 700,000 items; only three English libraries issued more in that time.<ref name="BHCC-PR-17012008">{{cite press release|title=Jubilee Library among nation's favourites

Several artworks were commissioned for the library and its environs in 2005.<ref name="Antram65"/><ref name="NEB162"/>  By the end of that year, the Jubilee Square development was largely complete. Jubilee Street was reopened to traffic in December, three months after <U+00A3>30 million was spent on new shops, offices and restaurants on its west side; and a [[PizzaExpress]] restaurant was built on the east side of the square.  Two years later, the south side of the square was finished when a hotel opened opposite the library.<ref name="NEB163"/>

==Architecture==
[[File:Jubilee Library, Jubilee Street - geograph.org.uk - 231185.jpg|thumb|right|The glass fa<U+00E7>ade faces south on to Jubilee Square.  The timber and glass benches in front were one of three artworks commissioned for the library.]]
[[File:Jubilee Library, Brighton - Detail of Tiling on West Elevation.JPG|thumb|right|The west fa<U+00E7>ade has imitation [[mathematical tile]]s and windows at irregular intervals.]]
Jubilee Library has been widely praised for its design, use of materials and [[Green building|sustainability]].  It has been called "a rare example of first-class design emanating from the controversial Private Finance Initiative",<ref name="Antram65">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=65.}}</ref> "a triumph ... carefully wrought but nonetheless striking",<ref name="Antram28"/> "crisp, simple ... and pack[ing] a surprising architectural punch"<ref name="Guardian-28022005">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2005/feb/28/architecture.regeneration|title=Sweet and low down|last=Glancey|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Glancey|date=28 February 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|Guardian News and Media Ltd]]|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref> and "a stunning piece of architecture that enhances its location".<ref name="AJ-14102005">{{cite web|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/jubilee-library-lands-prime-ministers-award-as-warm-up-to-stirling/586044.article|title=Jubilee Library lands Prime Minister's Award as warm up to Stirling|last=Sharp|first=Rob|date=14 October 2005|work=[[Architects' Journal]]|publisher=[[EMAP|Emap Ltd]]|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref>  The scheme architects were [[Bennetts Associates]] and Brighton firm Lomax Cassidy & Edwards;<ref name="Antram65"/> the lead architects of the respective firms have a long association.<ref name="HP-27022005"/>

The south-facing entrance is fully glazed and creates a smooth transition from the square to the interior.  To the east, a "slightly austere translucent glass box" projects slightly and is topped by an angled [[brise soleil]].<ref name="Antram65"/><ref name="NEB162"/>  Further to the east, the wing containing staff and conference rooms is faced with glazed blue tiles which imitate [[mathematical tile]]s<U+2014>an 18th-century design element used frequently in Brighton but rarely found elsewhere.<ref name="Antram65"/><ref name="Antram6">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=6.}}</ref>  The west side is the only other clearly visible elevation (it faces Jubilee Street); the ground floor is continuously glazed, and above this layers of blue and green imitation mathematical tiles are interspersed with windows at irregular intervals.<ref name="Antram65"/><ref name="NEB162"/>  The tiles were glazed by hand in the local area.  Architecture critic [[Hugh Pearman (architecture critic)|Hugh Pearman]] praised their use "at a time when every other building in the western world seems to have an off-the-peg [[terracotta]] skin".<ref name="HP-27022005"/>

The interior has been described as "cathedral-like",<ref name="NEB162"/> "lofty [and] noble".<ref name="HP-27022005"/>  Comparisons have been made between it and the mid 19th-century works of French architect [[Henri Labrouste]], such as the [[Biblioth<U+00E8>que Sainte-Genevi<U+00E8>ve]] and the [[Biblioth<U+00E8>que nationale de France]],<ref name="NEB162"/><ref name="Antram66"/> and also the work of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].<ref name="HP-27022005"/>  The two-storey forum-style space is interspersed with large white-painted concrete columns splayed at the top.<ref name="Antram66"/>  Natural light comes in through the south-facing glass front and is directed by a giant screen in the form of a [[Louver|louvre]] which, along with steel and glass passageways, divide the outer glass wall from the interior.<ref name="Antram66"/>  These passages form a {{smallcaps|u}}-shaped surround at first-floor level, behind which are staff rooms, stock rooms, conference facilities and other administrative functions.  They are partly lined with [[beech]] panels.<ref name="HP-27022005"/>

The main artwork is visible through a two-storey window above the main entrance.  ''Uncover<U+2013>Discover'' by Georgia Russell consists of large [[filigree]]-style paper letters suspended from the ceiling.<ref name="Antram65"/><ref name="BHCC-JL">{{cite web|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1139701|title=Jubilee Library: The central library for Brighton & Hove|year=2011|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council|accessdate=11 October 2011}}</ref>  Inside the children's section is the ''Wall of a Thousand Stories'' by Kate Malone<U+2014>a series of multicoloured ceramic plaques.<ref name="BHCC-JL"/><ref name="Antram66">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=66.}}</ref>  Another art installation, ''Liquidus'', also has a functional role: it is a pair of "primeval" timber and glass benches which are lit from beneath after dark.  Caroline Barton designed the benches, which are in the square in front of the entrance.<ref name="Antram65"/><ref name="BHCC-JL"/>

==Sustainability==
The library is a good example of a 21st-century building designed in line with [[Green building|sustainable principles]]: Brighton & Hove City Council describes it as "one of the most energy efficient public buildings in the country",<ref name="BHCC-JL"/> and the [[Building Research Establishment]] gave its sustainable features an "excellent" grade in 2002 during the construction phase.<ref name="BHCC-PR-06122002">{{cite press release|title=Work begins on Brighton Central Library and Jubilee Street|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council|date=6 December 2002|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=b1149084&action=show_pr&id=113741|accessdate=12 October 2011}}</ref> [[Solar energy|Solar]] and [[wind energy]] are used to heat and cool the building naturally, except during extremes of temperature.  Air is taken in from outside, circulates through the building through spaces in the walls and under the heat-absorbing floor, and is pushed out through roof vents.<ref name="Antram66"/><ref name="BHCC-PR-06122002"/><ref name="BHCC-Lib-Awards">{{cite web|url=http://www.brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/Libraries/sites/Jubilee/Pages/JubileeLibraryAwardWinning.aspx|title=Jubilee Library Award Winning|year=2011|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="NEB164">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=164.}}</ref>  The architects planned three revolving funnels to let the air out and "dramatise" the roofline, but this feature was dropped before construction.<ref name="Antram65"/>  Rainwater is harvested from the roof, collected in a {{convert|10000|l|gal|adj=on}} tank and used in the toilets.<ref name="BHCC-Lib-Awards"/><ref name="NEB163"/>  Internal lighting automatically adjusts to the conditions.  The library [[Greenhouse gas|emits half as much carbon dioxide]] as buildings of comparable size.<ref name="NEB163"/>

==Awards==
In 2005, the year it opened, Jubilee Library won ten awards.  It came top in the partnership and delegates' choice categories in the Public Libraries Group Award from the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]].  The [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] declared it their Major Project of the Year, and it was the "Operational Project with Best Design" at the Public<U+2013>Private Finance Awards.  The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] gave it their Regional Award, the Concrete Society awarded the library a Certificate of Excellence, and the Sussex Heritage Trust gave it their Community Award.  At the [[British Construction Industry Awards]], Jubilee Library won the Prime Minister's Better Public Buildings Award and the Building Projects Award.  The Jubilee Square development as a whole won the "Best Practice in Regeneration Award for Best Design-led Regeneration Project", given by the British Urban Regeneration Association.  Four more honours followed in 2006: a [[Civic Trust#Civic Trust Awards|Civic Trust Award]], ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper's Ethical Award in the Buildings category, an International Green Apple Award for the Built Environment and Architectural Heritage, and (jointly with another project) the Art and Work Award for a Site-specific Commission.  The project was also a finalist or runner-up in contests including the 2005 [[Stirling Prize]]<U+2014>an international competition run by the Royal Institute of British Architects.<ref name="BHCC-Lib-Awards"/>

==Impact and reception==
The Jubilee Square development as a whole has been praised for linking two important historic parts of the city centre<U+2014>the [[North Laine]] and the Royal Pavilion grounds<U+2014>which had previously been isolated from each other by the "desolate space" of temporary car parks and wasteland.<ref name="BHCC-PR-06122002"/><ref name="HP-27022005"/>  The reopened Jubilee Street forms a direct link from Church Street, an ancient route to the Pavilion estate, and North Road<U+2014>the main road through the North Laine district of cultural venues, restaurants and small shops.<ref name="NEB162"/>  As such, the library and square form a central part of Brighton's "cultural quarter".<ref name="BHCC-PR-03112005"/>  As the central feature of Jubilee Square, and the first to be completed, the library was described by [[Hugh Pearman (architecture critic)|Hugh Pearman]] as the "catalyst for regeneration".  The library's opening and success encouraged commercial development round it, which in turn helped to pay for it through the 25-year private finance scheme set up in 2000.  Pearman stated that "the library became the superhero.  The city did not save it: it saved the city."<ref name="HP-27022005"/>  Assessing its impact in 2010, another writer suggested it could be "the most important public building constructed in Brighton since the Royal Pavilion".<ref name="NEB165"/>

The council estimated in 2005 that the library and the associated commercial development would generate <U+00A3>20 million for the city's economy, based on increased spending by visitors and the creation of hundreds of jobs.  It spent <U+00A3>1.6 million of public money on the scheme, so a greater than tenfold [[return on investment]] was expected.<ref name="NEB165"/><ref name="BHCC-PR-03112005"/>  The new library has had a positive impact on locals as well: in 2005, the council reported that visitor numbers were three times greater than before, loans were 70% higher and thousands more people had joined Brighton & Hove Libraries.  The private finance contract allowed the council to buy new stock at preferential rates, and about 20,000 new items were added in the first few months.<ref name="BHCC-PR-03112005"/>

Some internal design features have been criticised.  Only a single staircase on one side of the building connects the three storeys.  It leads into "claustrophobic" corridors which contrast with the open spaces of the main building.  The large internal space also makes the stock displays appear modest.<ref name="Antram66"/>  The shelving units have been described as "awful"<ref name="HP-27022005"/> and "well below the design quality" of the rest of the library.<ref name="Antram66"/>
