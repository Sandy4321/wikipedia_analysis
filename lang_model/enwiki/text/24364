'''Jens Lehmann''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]<U+2014>German {{IPA|[j<U+025B>ns 'le:man]}}) (born [[November 10]] [[1969]] in [[Essen, Germany|Essen]]) is a [[Germany|German]] [[football (soccer)|football]] [[goalkeeper]] who currently plays for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] of the [[English Premier League]] and the [[Germany national football team|German national team]].

==Club career==

Lehmann started his career in 1989 with [[Schalke 04]], playing for them for nearly a decade. His first years were rocky; an infamous 45-minute stint against [[Bayer Leverkusen]] in 1993 in which he conceded three howler goals and was subbed after 45 minutes,<ref>[http://www.fussballdaten.de/bundesliga/1994/12/leverkusen-schalke/ Bayer Leverkusen 	- FC Schalke 04]</ref> causing him to flee the stadium alone by tram rather than taking the team bus,<ref>[http://www.faz.net/s/Rub47986C2FBFBD461B8A2C1EC681AD639D/Doc~E336A733D0AD84679B26B9D3C9EEA71AD~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Vom Libero zum Titan?]</ref> but gradually established himself as a strong keeper lauded for his ability to intercept crosses.

He scored his first league goal on [[12 March]] [[1995]] in a 6-2 victory over [[TSV 1860 M<U+00FC>nchen]]; in the 84th minute, he scored Schalke's 6th goal from the penalty spot<ref>[http://www.fussballdaten.de/bundesliga/1995/21/schalke-1860muenchen/ FC Schalke 04 - TSV 1860 M<U+00FC>nchen]</ref>. His second goal was scored on [[19 December]] [[1997]], a last-minute equaliser against Borussia Dortmund, Schalke's rivals and the club he would join just fourteen months later<ref>[http://www.fussballdaten.de/bundesliga/1998/20/dortmund-schalke/ Borussia Dortmund - FC Schalke 04]</ref>.

Lehmann became the [[Ruhr Valley]] club's hero in their 1997 [[UEFA Cup]] final victory over [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Internazionale]], after playing a strong season and saving an [[Ivan Zamorano]] penalty in a [[kicks from the penalty mark|penalty shootout]].  

He left Schalke for [[A.C. Milan]] in [[1998]], but did not play well and was dropped after just five matches.  He returned to Germany to play for [[Borussia Dortmund]], winning the [[Bundesliga (football)|Bundesliga]] in [[Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bundesliga 2001/02|2001-2002]]. A fiery personality with a poor disciplinary record, he holds the Bundesliga record for the number of sendings-off for a goalkeeper (five).

Lehmann joined [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on [[July 25]], [[2003]] as a replacement for [[David Seaman]], and played every match as Arsenal went unbeaten for the entire '03-04 [[FA Premier League]] campaign, becoming the first  English club to accomplish this feat since the 1880s. However, Lehmann's confident, aggressive style of play, often coming out of his goal to intercept passes occasionally led to mistakes, such as in the title-winning match at local rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur]] when Lehmann pushed Tottenham striker [[Robbie Keane]] as the pair waited for a Tottenham corner,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3628573.stm Arsenal clinch title]</ref> and made mistakes that led to both goals in Arsenal's Champions League defeat at home to Chelsea the same season.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1166223,00.html Hot-headed German Goalie Faces London Bench]</ref>

By the middle of the [[2004-05 in English football|2004-05]] season, Lehmann was no longer automatic first-choice, with Spaniard [[Manuel Almunia]] starting in several matches instead. However, Almunia made a series of mistakes himself, thus allowing Lehmann to regain his position. At the end of that season, as speculation again began to mount that he would be replaced over the summer, Lehmann cemented his position in the Arsenal goal with a man-of-the-match performance against [[Manchester United]] in the 2005 [[FA Cup]] final. He made several important saves and demonstrated great positional sense to keep the score 0-0 after [[extra time]], and then crucially saved [[Paul Scholes]]' shot in the penalty shootout, which Arsenal won 5-4.  

Lehmann had an outstanding [[2005-06 in English football|2005-06 season]] with Arsenal, making his 100th Premier League appearance for the club in their game against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on [[April 15]] [[2006]]. He was a key factor in his side's first-ever accession to the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] final; during their run Arsenal broke the record for the most consecutive [[Shutout|clean sheets]] in the Champions League with ten, breaking the record of seven that Milan had set just one year before. That run formed the bulk of an 853-minute spell without conceding a goal, overtaking the CL record for an individual goalkeeper set by [[Edwin van der Sar]].

[[Bayern Munich]]'s [[Hasan Salihamid<U+017E>i<U+0107>]] had been the last to net against Lehmann, in the 64th minute of a quarter-final first leg match on [[March 22]] [[2005]]; Lehmann kept a clean sheet in the second leg, and then a further seven during Arsenal's run in 2005-06 (Almunia played in the other three matches); the final clean sheet was earned in the semi-finals against [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]], after Lehmann saved an 89th minute [[Juan Rom<U+00E1>n Riquelme]] [[penalty kick|penalty]]. Lehmann maintained his shutout run despite an ignominious end to his [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]] against [[FC Barcelona]]; with the score still at 0-0 he was sent off in the 18th minute for a [[professional foul]] after bringing down [[Samuel Eto'o]], making him the first player and goalkeeper to ever be sent off in a Champions League final, but it didn't stop him from being named the Champions League Goalkeeper of the Year for the 2005-06 season.

His remarkable run was finally ended on [[September 13]] [[2006]] by [[Hamburger SV]]'s [[Boubacar Sanogo]], who scored a consolation goal in the 89th minute of Arsenal's first group stage match of the [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|2006-07]] Champions League season.

Lehmann's contract at Arsenal was due to expire in summer 2007 and during the [[2006-07 in English football|2006-07]] season there was much speculation he would leave the club on a [[Bosman ruling|Bosman]] transfer. However it was reported on [[April 26]] [[2007]] that he had signed a year's extension on his contract, tying him to the club until 2008.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/6594633.stm</ref>

==International career==
Lehmann made his debut for the national team against [[Oman national football team|Oman]] in February 1998 and has since earned 39 (as of [[16 August]][[2006]]) [[Cap (football)|caps]] for his country, most of which were friendlies.  He has a well-publicised rivalry with [[Bayern Munich]] goalkeeper [[Oliver Kahn]], whose presence has long prevented Lehmann from becoming the number one goalkeeper of the [[Germany national football team|German national team]].  On [[April 7]][[2006]], however, German national coach [[J<U+00FC>rgen Klinsmann]] announced that Lehmann would be Germany's first-choice goalkeeper for the upcoming [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. 

Lehmann conceded two goals in Germany's opening match, both scored by [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]'s [[Paulo Wanchope]] although Germany won the match 4-2. Lehmann played strongly in the next three games, conceding no goals and allowing Germany to sweep their group 3-0-0 <!-- W-D-L --> and defeat Sweden convincingly in the Round of 16. Lehmann's shutout streak was broken by Argentina in the quarterfinals, but his team found the equalizer late in the game and Lehmann stopped two shots in the penalty shootout. 

Germany's opponent in the semifinals was Italy. The Italians had the better chances to score but Lehmann made several spectacular saves, including one in extra time where he dove out of goal to intercept an Italian player who had broken loose from the defence, punching the ball clear with his fist and temporarily knocking out the Italian in the process. He allowed two goals within a minute of each other with only a few seconds remaining in overtime. However neither of these goals could be blamed on Lehmann, but were caused by Germany's defence playing high up the pitch. These goals put Italy into the World Cup final. The retiring Oliver Kahn was given the honour of starting in the third place match, with which Lehmann was content.

The highlight of Lehmann's international career came in the 2006 World Cup quarterfinal match (30 June 2006, Olympiastadion, Berlin) against Argentina. The game remained tied 1-1 after 90 minutes and extra time. The game came down to penalty kicks and Lehmann carried his team through. He made two critical saves of Argentinian penalty kicks, one from [[Roberto Ayala]] and another from [[Esteban Cambiasso]], and came close to saving a third. Meanwhile, the Germans made all of the necessary goals to win the penalty kicks 4-2. Lehmann's prowess in the shootout was aided by notes given to him before the kicks <U+2014> an idea from Germany's chief scout, Swiss-born [[:de:Urs Siegenthaler|Urs Siegenthaler]] <U+2014> with Lehmann keeping the paper in his right sock. Before the last shot from Cambiasso, Lehmann looked at the paper for a long time even though Cambiasso's name was not even on it. The story around the paper features in the film "[[Deutschland. Ein Sommerm<U+00E4>rchen]]". 
Lehmann was considered a hero by the German public after these saves, and he received praise even from long-time rival Oliver Kahn. <ref>{{cite web | title=Lehmann had penalty taker notes| work=BBC news report | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/germany/5136802.stm| accessdate=July 1 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> 

In August 2006 Lehmann revealed that during the World Cup he was suffering with a foot injury that he claims was a result of wearing different boots. The [[German Football Association]] ordered their players to wear only those manufactured by principal sponsor [[Adidas]] as opposed to Lehmann's sponsor [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. (Defender [[Christian W<U+00F6>rns]] had been dropped from the national team in 2005 after refusing to train in Adidas boots.) This has now been overturned thanks to Lehmann and several other players protesting about the decision and the players are now free to wear boots made by other companies.

In August 2006, Lehmann suggested that he may retire from league and international football after playing for Germany in [[Euro 2008]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Lehmann plans to retire after Euro 2008| work=The Hindu News Update Service | url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/007200608141961.htm| accessdate=August 14 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>  However, he subsequently stated in January 2007 that he has not made any decision on retirement. <ref>{{cite web | title=Lehmann Refutes Retirement Claims | work=goal.com | url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=199691| accessdate=January 5 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref>
