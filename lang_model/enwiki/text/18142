'''[[Jimmy Carter]]''' served as the thirty-ninth [[President of the United States]] from 1977 to 1981.

==Inauguration==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:CarterClinton.jpg|thumb|right|''President Carter meets with Governor (and future President) [[Bill Clinton]].'']] -->
In his inaugural address he said: "We have learned that more is not necessarily better, that even our great nation has its recognized limits, and that we can neither answer all questions nor solve all problems."<ref name = "Dyer-2004">American Presidency, Brinkley and Dyer, 2004</ref>

Carter had campaigned on a promise to eliminate the trappings of the "[[Imperial Presidency]]," and he began taking action according to that promise on Inauguration Day, breaking with recent history and security protocols by walking up Pennsylvania Avenue from the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] to the [[White House]] in his inaugural parade. His first steps in the White House went further in this direction: Carter reduced the size of the staff by one-third; canceled government-funded [[chauffeur]] service for [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] members, ordering them to drive their own cars; and put the [[USS Sequoia (presidential yacht)|USS ''Sequoia'']], the presidential [[yacht]] up for sale.

===Judicial appointments===
{{main|Jimmy Carter judicial appointments}}
Although Carter had no opportunity to appoint any justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], he appointed 56 judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]], and 203 judges to the [[United States district courts]]. Carter also experienced a small number of [[Jimmy Carter judicial appointment controversies|judicial appointment controversies]], as three of his nominees for different [[United States federal judge|federal appellate judgeships]] were not processed by the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]]-controlled [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] before Carter's presidency ended.

==Domestic policies==
Carter's reorganization efforts separated the [[United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare|Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] into the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]. He signed into law a major Civil Service Reform, the first in over 100 years.

[[File:Mondale and Carter.JPG|thumb|left|President Carter and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Walter Mondale]] in front of Presidential helicopter [[Marine One]], January, 1979]]
On Carter's first day in office, January 20, 1977, he fulfilled a campaign promise by issuing an [[Executive Order]] declaring unconditional [[amnesty]] for [[Vietnam War]]-era [[draft dodgers|draft evaders]].<ref>[http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/11967.html Executive Orders<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref>[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/vietnam/vietnam_1-21-77.html Online NewsHour: Remembering Vietnam: Carter's Pardon<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

Under Carter's watch, the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] of 1978 was passed, which phased out the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]]. He was also somewhat successful in [[deregulation|deregulating]] the trucking, rail, communications, and finance industries.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}<!---this IS factual, but the problem is that it may not have been important for Carter.

Carter was the ''first'' president to address the topic of [[LGBT|gay]] rights.<ref>Shilts, Randy, ''Conduct Unbecoming''</ref> He opposed [[The Briggs Initiative]], a [[California]] ballot measure that would have banned [[gay]]s and supporters of [[gay rights]] from being [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] teachers. His administration was the first to meet with a group of gay rights activists, and in recent years he has come out in favor of [[civil unions]] and ending the ban on [[gays in the military]].<ref> [http://www.gaywired.com/article.cfm?section=66&id=14671 Gaywired.com]</ref> He has stated that he "opposes all forms of discrimination on the basis of [[sexual orientation]] and believes there should be [[equal protection]] under the law for people who differ in sexual orientation".<ref>[http://www.sovo.com/2004/12-24/news/localnews/carter.cfm Carter backs civil unions for gay couples - Southern Voice Atlanta<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

===Budget===
Despite calling for a reform of the tax system in his presidential campaign, once in office Carter did very little to change it.<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761566991 Jimmy Carter - MSN Encarta<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref></blockquote>

The federal government was in [[deficit]] every year of the Carter presidency.<ref name="crs">[http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL33305_20060309.pdf], CRS Report RL33305, The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax of the 1980s: Implications for Current Energy Policy, by Salvatore Lazzari, p. 5.</ref>  His [[Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act]] created 103 million [[acre]]s (417,000 [[km<U+00B2>]]) of national park land in [[Alaska]].

===Congressional relations===
During the first 100 days of his presidency, Carter wrote a letter to Congress proposing several water projects be scrapped. Among the opponents of Carter's proposal was Senator [[Russell Long]], a powerful Democrat on the [[Senate Finance Committee]].<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=z5BwlqRzRAsC&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=Jimmy+Carter+Russell+Long+water&source=bl&ots=J8G6BTyRwe&sig=VcH6urCskAvDi_21rj8UapCrkdQ&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA81,M1</ref> Carter's plan was overturned and bitter feeling became a problem for Carter.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/27/zelizer.hundred/index.html</ref>

Initially, Carter was fairly successful in getting legislation through Congress, but a rift grew between them. A few months after his term started, and thinking he had the support of about 74 Congressmen, Carter issued a "hit list" of 19 projects that he claimed were "[[pork barrel]]" spending. He said that he would veto any legislation that contained projects on this list.<ref>{{cite news
|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/143163782.html?dids=143163782:143163782&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+1%2C+1977&author=By+Walter+Pincus+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&pub=The+Washington+Post+(1974-Current+file)&edition=&startpage=A1&desc=When+a+Campaign+Vow+Crashes+Into+a+Pork+Barrel

}}</ref>

This list met with opposition from the leadership of the Democratic Party. Carter had characterized a rivers and harbors bill as wasteful spending. House speaker [[Tip O'Neill]], who supported Carter in many matters, thought it was unwise for the President to interfere with matters that had traditionally been the purview of Congress. Carter was then further weakened when he signed into law a bill containing many of the "hit list" projects.

Later, Congress refused to pass major provisions of his [[consumer protection]] bill and his labor reform package. Carter then vetoed a public works package calling it "inflationary", as it contained what he considered to be wasteful spending. Congressional leaders sensed that public support for his legislation was weak, and took advantage of it. After gutting his consumer protection bill, they transformed his tax plan into nothing more than spending for special interests, after which Carter referred to the congressional tax committees as "ravenous wolves."

===Energy crisis===
{{see also|1979 energy crisis}}
In 1973, during the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]], the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC) reduced supplies of [[oil]] available to the world market, in part due to deflation of the dollars they were receiving due to Nixon [[Nixon Shock|leaving the gold standard]] and in part due to America's sending of arms to [[Israel]] during the [[Yom Kippur War]]. This sparked the [[1973 Oil Crisis]] and forced oil prices to rise sharply, spurring price inflation throughout the economy and slowing growth. The US government imposed [[price controls]] on [[gasoline]] and [[oil]] following the announcement, which had the effect of causing shortages and long lines for gasoline.<ref name="concise">

In 1977, Carter convinced the Democratic Congress to create the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DoE) with the goal of [[energy conservation|conserving energy]]. Carter set oil and natural gas price controls, had [[solar hot water]] panels installed on the roof of the White House, had a wood stove in his living quarters, ordered the [[General Services Administration]] to turn off hot water in some federal facilities, and requested that [[Christmas]] decorations remain dark in 1979 and 1980. Nationwide, controls were put on [[thermostat]]s in government and commercial buildings to prevent people from raising temperatures in the winter (above 65 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] = 18.33 <U+00B0>C) or lowering them in the summer (below 78 degrees Fahrenheit = 25.55 <U+00B0>C).

As reaction to the energy crisis and growing concerns over [[air pollution]], Carter also signed the [[National Energy Act]] (NEA) and the [[Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act]] ([[PURPA]]). The purpose of these [[wiktionary:watershed#Noun|watershed]] laws was to encourage energy conservation and the development of national energy resources, including [[renewable energy|renewables]] such as [[wind energy|wind]] and [[solar energy]].<ref>http://web.gsm.uci.edu/~navarro/windfinal110899.pdf</ref>

However, during the 1979 crisis, Carter reinstated some price controls on gasoline, which again had the effect of causing lines at gasoline stations.<ref name="mises"/> During his "malaise" speech, he announced a gradual deregulation of these price controls, along with the imposition of a [[Windfall profit tax|"Windfall Profit Tax"]]. Enacted in 1980 on domestic oil production, the tax was repealed in 1988, when Congress agreed that it had increased dependence on foreign oil.<ref name="tax history">

===Economy: stagflation and the appointment of Volcker===
During Carter's administration, the economy suffered double-digit [[inflation]], coupled with very high interest rates,<ref name="'70s 292">{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0465041957|page= 292|pages= |url= }}</ref> oil shortages, high unemployment and slow economic growth. Productivity growth in the United States had declined to an average annual rate of 1%, compared to 3.2% of the 1960s. There was also a growing federal budget deficit, which increased to $66 billion.

The [[1970s#Economy of the Seventies|1970s are described]] as a period of [[stagflation]], as well as higher interest rates. Price inflation (a rise in the general level of prices) creates uncertainty in budgeting and planning and makes labor strikes for pay raises more likely. Carter asked Congress to impose [[price controls]] on energy, medicine, and consumer prices, but Congress did not agree.<ref name="'70s 301">{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0465041957|page= |pages=301<U+2013>302 |url= }}</ref>

In the wake of a cabinet shakeup in which Carter asked for the resignations of several cabinet members (see "Malaise speech" below), Carter appointed [[G. William Miller]] as [[Secretary of the Treasury]]. Miller had been serving as Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve Board]]. To replace Miller, and in order to calm down the market, Carter appointed [[Paul Volcker]] as Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve Board]].<ref>Erwin C. Hargrove, ''Jimmy Carter as President: Leadership and the Politics of the Public Good'', London, 1988, p 102.</ref> Volcker pursued a tight [[monetary policy]] to bring down inflation, which he considered his mandate. He succeeded, but only by first going through an unpleasant phase during which the economy slowed and [[unemployment]] rose, prior to any relief from inflation.

Led by Volcker, the [[Federal Reserve]] raised the discount rate from 10% when Volcker assumed the chairmanship in August 1979 to 12% within two months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/Research/data/us/disc.cfm?js=0|title=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis - Discount Rates}}</ref> The [[prime rate]] hit 21.5% in December 1980, the highest rate in U.S. history under any President.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mortgage-x.com/general/indexes/prime.asp |title=http://mortgage-x.com/general/indexes/prime.asp |accessdate= |format= |work=}}</ref> Carter admitted in February 1980 that inflation had reached a "crisis stage."<ref name="'70s 292"/> Investments in fixed income (both [[bond (finance)|bond]]s and [[pension]]s being paid to [[retirement|retired]] people) were becoming less valuable. The high interest rates would lead to a [[Early 1980s recession|sharp recession in the early 1980s]].<ref>"The downturn was precipitated by a rise in interest rates to levels that exceeded the record rates recorded a year earlier." Congressional Budget Office, "The Prospects for Economic Recovery", February 1982.</ref>

==="Malaise" speech===
When the [[1979 energy crisis|energy market exploded]] <U+2014> an occurrence Carter tried to avoid during his term <U+2014> he was planning on delivering his fifth major speech on energy; however, he felt that the American people were no longer listening. Carter went to [[Camp David]] for ten days to meet with governors, mayors, religious leaders, scientists, economists and citizens. He sat on the floor and took notes of their comments and especially wanted to hear criticism. His pollster told him that the American people simply faced a crisis of confidence because of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of John F. Kennedy]], the [[Vietnam War]], and [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/peopleevents/e_malaise.html | publisher = PBS | work = American Experience | title = Jimmy Carter}}</ref> On July 15, 1979, Carter gave a nationally-televised address in which he identified what he believed to be a "crisis of confidence" among the American people. This came to be known as his "[[malaise]]" speech, although the word never appeared in it:[http://millercenter.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3402]

{{quote|<p>I want to talk to you right now about a fundamental threat to American [[democracy]]... I do not refer to the outward strength of America, a nation that is at peace tonight everywhere in the world, with unmatched economic power and military might...</p>

<p>The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation.</p>

<p>In a nation that was proud of hard work, strong families, close-knit communities, and our faith in God, too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption. Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns. But we've discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning.</p>

<p>I'm asking you for your good and for your nation's security to take no unnecessary trips, to use [[carpool]]s or [[public transportation]] whenever you can, to park your car one extra day per week, to obey the [[speed limit]], and to set your thermostats to save fuel... I have seen the strength of America in the inexhaustible resources of our people. In the days to come, let us renew that strength in the struggle for an energy-secure nation.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/filmmore/ps_crisis.html Transcript] <U+2014> "Crisis of Confidence" speech, July 15, 1979</ref><ref>[http://www.cartercenter.com/news/editorials_speeches/crisis_of_confidence.html Transcript at Carter Center] <U+2014> "Crisis of Confidence" speech, July 15, 1979</ref></p>}}

Carter later admitted in his memoirs that he should simply have asked only those five members for their resignations.  In 2008, a ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' piece stated:

{{quote|We would also do well to remember the sort of complexity and humility that Carter tried to inject into political rhetoric... Carter was unwilling to pander to the people... What Carter really did in the speech was profound. He warned Americans that the 1979 energy crisis <U+2014> both a shortage of gas and higher prices <U+2014> stemmed from the country's way of life. "Too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption. Human identity is no longer defined by what one does but by what one owns", the president said. Consumerism provided people with false happiness, he suggested, but it also prevented Americans from re-examining their lives in order to confront the profound challenge the energy crisis elicited. Despite [some failures] Carter left behind a way of talking about the country's promise and its need to confront what is undoubtedly one of its biggest challenges <U+2014> to solve the energy crisis in a way that takes seriously both our limits and our greatness.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usnews.com/articles/opinion/2008/08/13/past-and-present-malaise-and-the-energy-crisis.html | publisher = US News | title = Past and Present: malaise and the energy crisis | date = 2008-08-13}}</ref>}}

==Foreign policies==
===South Korea===
During his first month in office, Carter cut the defense budget by $6 billion. One of his first acts was to order the unilateral removal of all [[nuclear weapon]]s from [[South Korea]] and announce his intention to cut back the number of US troops stationed there. Other military men confined intense criticism of the withdrawal to private conversations or testimony before congressional committees, but in 1977 Major General [[John K. Singlaub]], chief of staff of U.S. forces in South Korea, publicly criticized Carter's decision to lower the U.S. troop level there. On March 21, 1977, Carter relieved him of duty, saying his publicly stated sentiments were "inconsistent with announced national security policy."<ref>{{cite web

===Arab-Israeli Conflict/Camp David Accords===

[[File:Sadat and Begin clean3.jpg|right|thumb|Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin acknowledge applause during a Joint Session of Congress in which President Jimmy Carter announced the results of the Camp David Accords. [[18 September]] [[1978]]]]

Carter's Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] paid close attention to the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]]. Diplomatic communications between [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]] increased significantly after the [[Yom Kippur War]] and the Carter administration felt that the time was right for comprehensive solution to the conflict.

In mid-1978, Carter became quite concerned as there were only a few months left before the Egyptian- Israeli Disengagement Treaty expired. As a result, Carter sent a special envoy to the [[Middle East]]. The American Ambassador flew back and forth between [[Cairo, Egypt]] and [[Tel Aviv]] in search of ways to narrow the disagreement between the two countries. It was then suggested that the foreign ministers meet at [[Leeds Castle]], England where they could discuss the possibilities of peace. They tried to come to an agreement, but the foreign ministers failed.<ref>Bickerton, I; Klausner, C: "A History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict", pages 188<U+2013>190. Pearson Prentice Hall, 5th edition, 2007.</ref> This led to the 1978 [[Camp David Accords]], one of Carter's most important accomplishments as President. The accords were a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt negotiated by Carter, which followed up on earlier negotiations conducted in the Middle East. In these negotiations King [[Hassan II of Morocco]] acted as a negotiator between [[Arab world|Arab]] interests and Israel, and [[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu]] of Romania acted as go-between for Israel and the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO, the unofficial representative of the [[Palestinian people]]). Once initial negotiations had been completed, Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] approached Carter for assistance. Carter then invited Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Anwar El Sadat]] to [[Camp David]] to continue the negotiations. They arrived on August 8, 1978. Upon their arrival, neither leader had addressed one another since the Vienna meeting. President Carter inevitably became the mediator between the two leaders. He spoke to each leader separately until an agreement was reached. Almost a month had passed, but no resolution had been reached. President Carter decided to take the two of them on a trip to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania to break this deadlock. He showed the two leaders the battlefield and gave them a history lesson about one of the battles that had taken place during the U.S. Civil War. Carter emphasized how important it was to have peace in order to bring prosperity to the people. A lesson was learned, and when Begin and Sadat returned to Camp David, they finally agreed that something had to be signed.<ref>Bickerton, I; Klausner, C: "A History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict", pages 190<U+2013>193. Pearson Prentice Hall, 5th edition, 2007.</ref>

On September 12, 1978, President Carter suggested dividing the negotiations over the peace treaty into two frameworks: framework #1 and framework #2. Framework #1 would address the West Bank and Gaza. Framework #2 would deal with Sinai. President Carter cleverly split the negotiations.

The first framework dealt with [[The Palestinian Territories]] (the West Bank and Gaza). The first point stated that the election of a self-governing authority would be allowed to provide full autonomy to the inhabitants of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza]]. This government would be elected by the Palestinians and would only look after municipal affairs. The second step would be to grant Palestinians autonomy mainly on those municipal matters. Five years down the road after having gone through steps one and two, the status of Palestine could then be negotiated. Framework #1 was not very well received; the Palestinians and Jordanians were furious. They objected to the fact that Begin and Sadat were deciding on their ultimate destiny without consulting them or their leaders. Framework #1 for that reason was not going to work; it was essentially a dead end.<ref name="Bickerton, I pages 190">Bickerton, I; Klausner, C: "A History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict", pages 190<U+2013>193; 198<U+2013>200. Pearson Prentice Hall, 5th edition, 2007.</ref>

The second framework dealt with the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. This framework consisted of two points:

1. The two parties, Egypt and Israel, should negotiate a treaty over a period of six months based on the principle of Egyptian sovereignty over Sinai and the withdrawal of Israel from that region.
2. This treaty would be followed and included in it would be the establishment of diplomatic, political, economic, and cultural relations between Egypt and Israel.

This would be a peace that would establish normal relations between the two states.
This was the basis of the two frameworks, but it had yet to be approved.<ref name="Bickerton, I pages 190"/>

The reaction to this proposal in the Arab world was very negative. In November 1978, there was an emergency meeting held by the Arab League in Damascus. Once again, Egypt was the main subject of the meeting, and they condemned the proposed treaty that Egypt was going to sign.
Sadat was also attacked by the Arab press for breaking ranks with the Arab League and having betrayed the Arab world. Discussions pertaining to the future peace treaty took place in both countries. Israel insisted in its negotiations that the Israel-Egypt treaty should supersede all of Egypt's other treaties, including those signed with the Arab League and Arab states.
Israel also wanted access to the oil discovered in the Sinai region. President Carter interjected and informed the Israelis that the U.S. would supply Israel with whatever oil it needed for the next 15 years if Egypt at any point decided not to supply oil to Israel.<ref>Bickerton, I; Klausner, C: "A History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict", pages 192<U+2013>193. Pearson Prentice Hall, 5th edition, 2007.</ref>

While framework #1 was already approved by the Israeli Government, the second framework also needed approval. The Israeli Cabinet accepted the second framework of the treaty. The Israeli Parliament also approved the second framework with a comfortable majority. Alternatively, the Egyptian Government was arguing about a number of things. They did not like the fact that this proposed treaty was going to supersede all other treaties. Egyptians were also disappointed that they were unable to link the Sinai question to the Palestinian question.

On March 26, 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in Washington, D.C.<ref name="Bickerton, I pages 190"/> Carter's role in getting the treaty was essential. [[Aaron David Miller]] interviewed many officials for his book ''The Much Too Promised Land'' (2008) and concluded the following: "No matter whom I spoke to <U+2014> Americans, Egyptians, or Israelis <U+2014> most everyone said the same thing: no Carter, no peace treaty."<ref>Aaron David Miller, The Much Too Promised Land (Bantam Books, 2008), page 159.</ref>

===Rapid Deployment Forces===
On October 1, 1979, Carter announced before a television audience the existence of the [[Rapid Deployment Forces]] (RDF), a mobile fighting force capable of responding to worldwide trouble spots, without drawing on forces committed to [[NATO]]. The RDF was the forerunner of [[United States Central Command|CENTCOM]].{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

===Human rights===
Carter initially departed from the long-held policy of [[containment]] toward the Soviet Union. In its place, Carter promoted a foreign policy that put [[human rights]] at the front.{{fact|date=January 2009}} This was a break from the policies of several predecessors, in which [[human rights]] abuses were often overlooked if they were committed by a nation that was allied with the United States. The Carter Administration ended support to the historically U.S.-backed [[Anastasio Somoza|Somoza]] regime in [[Nicaragua]] and gave aid to the new [[Sandinista|Sandinista National Liberation Front]] government that assumed power after Somoza's overthrow. However, Carter ignored a plea from [[El Salvador]]'s Archbishop [[<U+00D3>scar Romero]] not to send military aid to that country. Romero was later assassinated for his criticism of El Salvador's violation of human rights.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} Carter was also criticised by the feminist author and activist Andrea Dworkin for ignoring issues of women's rights in Saudi Arabia.<ref>[http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIIIA.html A Feminist Looks at Saudi Arabia<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

Carter continued his predecessors' policies of imposing sanctions on [[Rhodesia]], and, after Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] was elected [[Prime Minister]], protested the exclusion of [[Robert Mugabe]] and [[Joshua Nkomo]] from participating in the elections. Strong pressure from the United States and the United Kingdom prompted new elections in what was then called [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]), which saw Robert Mugabe elected as Prime Minister of Zimbabwe; afterwards, sanctions were lifted, and diplomatic recognition was granted. Carter was also known for his criticism of [[Paraguay]]'s [[Alfredo Stroessner]], [[Augusto Pinochet]] (although he received him in the White House), the [[Apartheid]] government of South Africa, [[Zaire]] (although Carter later changed course and supported Zaire, in response to alleged <U+2014> albeit unproven <U+2014> [[Cuba]]n support of anti-[[Mobutu Sese Seko|Mobutu]] rebels<ref>Crawford Young and Thomas Turner, ''The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State'', p. 389</ref><ref>Jeffrey M. Elliot and Mervyn M. Dymally, ''Voices of Zaire: Rhetoric or Reality'', p. 88</ref>) and other traditional allies.

===People's Republic of China===
:''See also'' [[Sino-American relations#Liaison Office, 1973-1978|Sino-American relations]]

[[File:Carter DengXiaoping.jpg|thumb|216px|[[Deng Xiaoping]] with President Carter]]
Carter continued the policy of Richard Nixon to normalize relations with the People's Republic of China. National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] and China expert [[Michel Oksenberg]] who was serving on the National Security Council, traveled to Beijing in early 1978, where they worked with [[Leonard Woodcock]], head of the liaison office there, to lay the groundwork for granting the People's Republic of China full diplomatic and trade relations. In the [[Joint Communiqu<U+00E9> on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations]] dated January 1, 1979, the United States transferred diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. The U.S. reiterated the Shanghai Communiqu<U+00E9>'s acknowledgment of the Chinese position that there is only one China and that Taiwan is a part of China; Beijing acknowledged that the American people would continue to carry on commercial, cultural, and other unofficial contacts with the people of Taiwan. The U.S. unofficially recognized Taiwan through the [[Taiwan Relations Act]].

|description=Jimmy Carter's speech upon signing the Panama Canal treaty, September 7, 1977.
}}
One of the most controversial moves of Carter's presidency was the final negotiation and signature of the Panama Canal Treaties in September 1977. Those treaties, which essentially would transfer control of the American-built Panama Canal to the nation of [[Panama]], were bitterly opposed by a majority of the American public and by the Republican Party. A common argument against the treaties was that the United States was transferring an American asset of great strategic value to an unstable and corrupt country led by an unelected but popularly supported General ([[Omar Torrijos]]). Those that supported the Treaties argued that the Canal was built within Panamanian territory therefore, by controlling it, the United States was in fact occupying part of another country and this agreement was intended to turn back to Panama the sovereignty of its complete territory. After the signature of the Canal treaties, in June 1978, Carter visited Panama with his wife and twelve U.S. Senators, amid widespread student disturbances against the Torrijos administration. Carter then began urging the Torrijos regime to soften its policies and move Panama towards gradual [[republicanism]].

===Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT)===
[[File:Carter Brezhnev sign SALT II.jpg|thumb|250px|left||President Jimmy Carter and Soviet General Secretary [[Leonid Brezhnev]] sign the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II) treaty, June 18, 1979, in [[Vienna]]]]

A key foreign policy issue Carter worked laboriously on was the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT II|SALT II Treaty]], which reduced the number of nuclear arms produced and/or maintained by both the United States and the Soviet Union. SALT is the common name for the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks, negotiations conducted between the US and the USSR. The work of Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon brought about the SALT I treaty, which had itself reduced the number of nuclear arms produced, but Carter wished to further this reduction. It was Carter's main goal (as was stated in his Inaugural Address) that nuclear weapons completely disappear from the world.

Carter and Leonid Brezhnev, the leader of the Soviet Union, reached an agreement to this end in 1979 <U+2014> the SALT II Treaty, despite opposition in Congress to ratifying it, as many thought it weakened US defenses. Following the Soviet invasion of [[Afghanistan]] late in 1979 however, Carter withdrew the treaty from consideration by Congress and the treaty was never ratified (though it was signed by both Carter and Brezhnev). Even so, both sides honored the commitments laid out in the negotiations.

===Intervention in Afghanistan===
{{seealso|Operation Cyclone}}
The United States secretly began sending aid to anti-Soviet, Afghan Islamist factions on July 3, 1979. In December 1979 the USSR [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|invaded Afghanistan]], after the pro-Moscow Afghanistan government, put in power by a 1978 coup, was overthrown. At the time some believed the Soviets were attempting to expand their borders southward in order to gain a foothold in the region. The Soviet Union had long lacked a [[warm water port]], and their movement south seemed to position them for further expansion toward [[Pakistan]] in the East, and [[Iran]] to the West. American politicians, Republicans and Democrats alike, ignorant of U.S. involvement, feared the Soviets were positioning themselves for a takeover of [[Middle East]]ern oil. Others believed that the Soviet Union was afraid Iran's Islamic Revolution and Afghanistan's Islamization would spread to the millions of Muslims in the USSR. National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] revealed the Carter Administration's involvement in starting the war in a 1998 interview with ''Le Nouvel Observateur''. Brzezinski told ''Le Nouvel Observateur'' that the Soviet invasion gave America "the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam War."[http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/BRZ110A.html Full Text of Interview]

After the invasion, Carter announced what became known as the [[Carter Doctrine]]: that the U.S. would not allow any other outside force to gain control of the [[Persian Gulf]]. He terminated the Russian Wheat Deal, which was intended to establish trade with USSR and lessen [[Cold War]] tensions. The grain exports had been beneficial to people employed in agriculture, and the Carter embargo marked the beginning of hardship for American farmers. He also made two of the most unpopular decisions of his entire Presidency: prohibiting American athletes from participating in the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, and reinstating registration for the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] for young males.

{{Refimprove|remainder of the section|date=January 2007}}
[[File:Carter and Brzezinski.jpg|right|thumb|Jimmy Carter standing with [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]]]
Carter and Brzezinski started a $40 billion covert program of training insurgents in Pakistan and Afghanistan as a part of the efforts to foil the Soviets' apparent plans. On the surface as well, Carter's diplomatic policies towards Pakistan in particular changed drastically. The administration had cut off financial [[aid]] to the country in early 1979 when religious fundamentalists, encouraged by the prevailing [[Islamist]] [[military dictatorship]] over Pakistan, burnt down a [[American diplomatic missions|US Embassy]] based there. The international stake in Pakistan, however, had greatly increased with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The then-[[President of Pakistan]], General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], was offered 400 million dollars to subsidize the [[anti-communist]] [[Mujahideen]] in Afghanistan by Carter. General Zia declined the offer as insufficient, famously declaring it to be "peanuts"; and the U.S. was forced to step up aid to Pakistan.

Reagan would later expand this program greatly to combat Cold War concerns presented by Russia at the time. Critics of this policy blame Carter and Reagan for the resulting instability of post-Soviet Afghan governments, which led to the rise of Islamic [[theocracy]] in the region.

===Iran hostage crisis===
{{main|Iran hostage crisis}}
[[File:The Shah with Atherton, Sullivan, Vance, Carter and Brzezinski, 1977.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The Iranian Shah, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], meeting with [[Arthur Atherton]], [[William H. Sullivan]], Cyrus Vance, President Jimmy Carter and Zbigniew Brzezinski, 1977]]
The main conflict between human rights and U.S. interests came in Carter's dealings with the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]]. The Shah, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran|Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], had been a strong ally of the United States since World War II and was one of the "twin pillars" upon which U.S. strategic policy in the [[Middle East]] was built (the other being Saudi Arabia). However, his rule was strongly [[autocracy|autocratic]], was seen as [[Kleptocracy|kleptocratic]] at home, and in 1953 he went along with the [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] Administration in staging a [[Coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coup]] to remove the elected Prime Minister, [[Mohammed Mossadegh]].

On a state visit to Iran, Carter spoke out in favor of the Shah, calling him a leader of supreme wisdom, and a pillar of stability in the volatile Middle East. The speech was apparently never shown on American television.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

When the [[Iranian Revolution]] broke out in Iran and the Shah was overthrown, the U.S. did not intervene directly. The Shah went into permanent [[exile]]. Carter initially refused him entry to the United States, even on grounds of medical emergency.

Despite his initial refusal to admit the Shah into the United States, on October 22, 1979, Carter finally granted him entry and temporary [[Right of asylum|asylum]] for the duration of his [[cancer]] treatment; the Shah left for [[Panama]] on December 15, 1979. In response to the Shah's entry into the U.S., [[Iran hostage crisis|Iranian militants seized]] the American embassy in [[Tehran]], taking 52 Americans hostage.<ref name = "Dyer-2004"/> The Iranians demanded:
# the return of the Shah to Iran for trial,
# the return of the Shah's wealth to the [[Iranian people]],
# an admission of guilt by the United States for its past actions in Iran, plus an apology, and
# a promise from the United States not to interfere in Iran's affairs in the future.
Though later that year the Shah left the U.S. and died in [[Egypt]], the hostage crisis continued and dominated the last year of Carter's presidency. The subsequent responses to the crisis <U+2014> from a "[[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] strategy" of staying inside the White House, to the unsuccessful attempt to rescue the hostages by military means ([[Operation Eagle Claw]]) <U+2014> were largely seen as contributing to Carter's defeat in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980 election]].

After the hostages were taken, Carter issued, on November 14, 1979, Executive Order 12170 <U+2014> Blocking Iranian Government property,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/1979.html |title=http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/1979.html |accessdate= |work=}}</ref> which was used to freeze the bank accounts of the Iranian government in US banks, totaling about $8 billion US at the time. This was to be used as a bargaining chip for the release of the hostages.

In the days before President [[Ronald Reagan]] took office, [[Algeria]]n diplomat Abdulkarim Ghuraib opened negotiations between the U.S. and Iran. This resulted in the "Algiers Accords" one day before the end of the Carter's Presidency on January 19, 1981, which entailed Iran's commitment to free the hostages immediately.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Hostage_Crisis|title=Iranian Hostage Crisis |accessdate= |format= |work=}}</ref> Additionally, Executive Orders 12277 through 12285 were issued by Carter<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/executive_orders.php?year=1981|title=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/executive_orders.php?year=1981 |accessdate= |format= |work=}}</ref> releasing all assets belonging to the Iranian government and all assets belonging to the Shah found within the United States and the guarantee that the hostages would have no legal claim against the Iranian government that would be heard in U.S. courts. Iran, however, also agreed to place $1 billion of the frozen assets in an escrow account and both Iran and the United States agreed to the creation of a tribunal to adjudicate claims by U.S. Nationals against Iran for compensation for property lost by them or contracts breached by Iran. The tribunal, known as the [[Iran-United States Claims Tribunal]], has awarded over $2 billion dollars to U.S. claimaints and has been described as one of the most important arbitration bodies in the history of [[international law]]. Although the release of the hostages was negotiated and secured under the Carter administration, the hostages were released on January 20, 1981, moments after Reagan was sworn in as President.

==Special counsel investigating campaign loans==
In April 1979, [[United States Attorney General]] [[Griffin Bell]] appointed [[Paul J. Curran]] as a special counsel to investigate loans made to the peanut business owned by Carter by a bank controlled by [[Bert Lance]], a friend of the president and the director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]]. Unlike [[Archibald Cox]] and [[Leon Jaworski]] who were named as [[special prosecutor]]s to investigate the [[Watergate scandal]], Curran's position as special counsel meant that he would not be able to file charges on his own, but would require the approval of Assistant Attorney General [[Philip Heymann]].<ref>Staff.

==Pardons==

Besides unconditional amnesty for a [[Vietnam War]] era [[draft dodger]]s, issued in his first full day in office (January 21, 1977), President Carter used his power in other cases. In general, he issued 566 pardons or commutations as President,<ref>http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/pardonspres1.htm</ref> granting 20% of all requests that came before him.<ref>http://www.rvc.cc.il.us/faclink/pruckman/pardoncharts/fiscact_files/image002.gif</ref>

Billy Carter's name was occasionally used as a gag answer for a [[Washington, D.C.]], trouble-maker on 1970s episodes of ''[[The Match Game]]''. Billy Carter once urinated on an airport runway in full view of the press and dignitaries. In late 1978 and early 1979, Billy Carter visited [[Libya]] with a contingent from Georgia three times. He eventually registered as a foreign agent of the Libyan government and received a $220,000 loan. This led to a [[United States Senate|Senate]] hearing over alleged [[influence peddling]], which some in the press dubbed "Billygate". A Senate subcommittee was called ''To Investigate Activities of Individuals Representing Interests of Foreign Governments (Billy Carter-Libya Investigation)''.

On May 5, 1979, Carter was the target of [[Raymond Lee Harvey]], a [[mental illness|mentally ill]] [[transient]], who was found with a [[starter pistol]] awaiting the President's [[Cinco de Mayo]] speech at the [[Civic Center Mall]] in Los Angeles, and claimed to be part of a four-man assassination attempt.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920351,00.html Skid Row Plot - TIME<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

Carter lost the presidency to [[Ronald Reagan]] in the 1980 election. The popular vote went 50.7 percent, or 43.9 million popular votes, for Reagan and 41 percent, or 35.5 million, for Carter. Independent candidate [[John B. Anderson]] won 6.6 percent, or 5.7 million votes. However, because Carter's support was not concentrated in any geographic region, Reagan won a landslide 91 percent of the [[electoral vote]], leaving Carter with only six states and the [[District of Columbia]]. Reagan carried a total of 489 electoral votes compared to Carter's 49.

Carter's defeat marks the first time an elected president failed to secure a 2nd term since Herbert Hoover in 1932. Furthermore, he is the first incumbent Democrat to fail to secure re-election since Andrew Johnson (Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms while Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson served one full term in addition to taking over after the deaths of Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy respectively and both Truman and Johnson did not seek re-election).

While Carter kept his promise (all 52 hostages returned home alive), he failed to secure the release of the hostages prior to the election. While Carter ultimately won their release, Iran did not release the hostages until minutes after Reagan took office. In recognition of the fact that Carter was responsible for bringing the hostages home, Reagan asked him to go to [[West Germany]] to greet them upon their release.

During his campaign, Carter was mocked for [[Jimmy Carter rabbit incident|an encounter with a swimming rabbit]] while fishing on a farm pond on April 20, 1979.
