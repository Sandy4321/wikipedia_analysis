'''Kenneth Marlar Taylor''' (December 23, 1919 <U+2013> November 25, 2006) was a new [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]] pilot stationed at [[Pearl Harbor]] during the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack]] on December 7, 1941. Along with his fellow pilot and friend [[George Welch (pilot)|George Welch]], they got airborne while under fire and Taylor shot down four Japanese dive bombers. Taylor was injured during the incident and received several awards for his efforts, including the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and the [[Purple Heart]]. 

Taylor later commanded several squadrons while stationed in the United States and elsewhere, and served for 27 years of active duty. He joined the [[Alaska Air National Guard]] until 1971 and worked in the insurance industry before retiring in 1985. His Pearl Harbor experience was portrayed in the 1970 film ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]''. Taylor died of [[hernia]] complications in November 2006 and is buried at the [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

==Early years and beginning career==
Shortly after his birth in [[Enid, Oklahoma|Enid]], [[Oklahoma]], Taylor's father Joe M. Taylor moved his family to [[Hominy, Oklahoma]], where Taylor graduated high school in 1938. He entered the [[University of Oklahoma]], [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], as a pre-law student in the same year and joined the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] two years later.<ref name="TaylorObit">{{Cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|title=Pilot shot down planes in Pearl Harbor attack|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] (printed in [[The San Diego Union Tribune]])|date=2006-12-10|url=http://www.uniontrib.com/uniontrib/20061210/news_lz1j10taylor.html|accessdate=March 23, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rlvz6KaA|archivedate=August 6, 2010}}</ref><ref name="NYTObit"/> He graduated from aviation training at [[Brooks City-Base|Brooks Field]] near [[San Antonio, Texas]] on April 25, 1941, reaching the [[Second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] rank and was assigned to class 41C.<ref name="BrookField">{{cite news|last=Lennon|first=Troy|title=Modest heroes who blunted sneak attack|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=December 7, 2006

Prior to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, Taylor spent the night before playing poker and dancing at the officers' club at Wheeler with fellow pilot [[George Welch (pilot)|George Welch]], and did not go to sleep until 6:30 a.m. local time on the day of the attack.<ref name="WarinthePacific">{{cite book|last=Gailey|first=Harry A.|title=The War in the Pacific|publisher=Presidio Press|year=1995|location=[[Novato, California|Novato]]|pages=89|isbn=0-89141-486-X}}</ref> Taylor and Welch awoke less than an hour and a half later at 7:55 a.m. to the sound of low-flying planes, machine-gun fire, and explosions.<ref name="FogofWar"/> Lt.

After they took off, they headed towards [[Kalaeloa, Hawai'i|Barber's Point]] at the southwest tip of Oahu, and initially saw an unarmed group of American [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers who were arriving from the mainland United States.<ref name="LATimes1207">{{cite news|title=Kenneth M.

[[File:TaylorWelchPH.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor and Welch shortly after the Pearl Harbor attack]]
While his plane was being reloaded with the .50 cal, a flight of dive bombers began strafing Wheeler, and Welch took off again (since he had landed a few minutes before Taylor and was already reloaded). The men who were loading the ammunition on Taylor's plane left the ammo boxes on his wing as they scattered to get away from the bombers. Taylor quickly took off, jumping over an armament dolly and the ammo boxes fell off of his plane's wing.<ref name="FogofWar"/> Both pilots realized that if they took off away from the incoming aircraft they would become targets once they were airborne, so both headed directly towards the bombers at take-off.<ref name="FogofWar"/> Additionally, if the low-flying bombers attempted to fire at the grounded P-40s at their current elevation, they would risk crashing. Taylor used this hindrance to his advantage and began immediately firing on the enemy aircraft as he took off, and performed a [[chandelle]].<ref name="FogofWar"/>

Taylor headed for a group of enemy aircraft, and due to a combination of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M Zeros]].<ref name="FogofWar"/><ref name="PH1941">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Carl|title=Pearl Harbor 1941: The Day of Infamy|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=1999|location=[[Great Britain]]|pages=62|isbn=1-85532-798-8}}</ref> A Japanese rear-gunner fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit.<ref name="RememberPearlHarbor">{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Blake|title=Remember Pearl Harbor|publisher=Modern Age Books|year=1942|location=[[New York]]|pages=30|isbn=0-935180-49-4}}</ref> One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg.<ref name="TaylorObit"/> Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying "It was of no consequence; it just scared the hell out of me for a minute."<ref name="TaylorObit"/> A few years after the interview, Taylor received two other slugs from his crew chief that had been found behind his seat.<ref name="FogofWar"/> Welch shot down the aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill<ref name="FogofWar"/>) before pulling away to assist Welch with an attacking [[A6M Zero]]. The attacking Zero and the rest of its formation left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several enemy aircraft until he ran out of ammunition, and both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?"<ref name="HandfulPilots"/> The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them.<ref name="FogofWar"/> In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, and let me tell you why: I was too young and too stupid to realize that I was in a lot of danger."<ref name="LATimes1207"/>

==Military and National Guard service==
[[File:Lockheed P-80 (F-80) Shooting StarCAM.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Taylor commanded a squadron that used the [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]]]]
After the Pearl Harbor attack Taylor was assigned to the [[44th Fighter Squadron]], and went to the South Pacific at Henderson Field on [[Guadalcanal]]. He was able to record two additional aerial kills: the first on January 27 and the other on December 7, 1943, two years after the Pearl Harbor attack.<ref name="FogofWar"/> This brought his total number of career kills to six, designating him a [[flying ace]]. Officially however, Taylor is still only credited with two aerial victories on December 7, 1941 and one on January 27, 1943. In Guadalcanal he was injured during an air raid and was sent back to the United States in 1943.<ref name="Airman88"/><ref name="LATimes1207"/> In the U.S. he trained pilots in preparation of combat in Europe and was then assigned to the [[12th Fighter Squadron|12th Pursuit Squadron]]. At the end of World War II, Taylor had reached the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]] and went to the [[Philippines]] to command a squadron that used the first United States Air Force combat jets, the [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]].<ref name="FogofWar"/><ref name="Airman88"/> Afterwards, he commanded the 4961st Special Weapons Test Group, became a tactical evaluator at the USAF Inspector General's office, and worked in [[The Pentagon]]. He was also the Deputy Chief of Staff and Plans for the [[Alaskan Air Command]] and was a long range planner on the Joint Staff.<ref name="FogofWar"/>

After serving 27 years of active duty, he retired as a colonel in 1967 and soon started as the [[Adjutant general#United States|Assistant Adjutant General]] for the [[Alaska Air National Guard]], retiring as a brigadier general in 1971.<ref name="TaylorObit"/> Following his retirement from the armed services, Taylor worked in the insurance industry in Alaska until 1985.<ref name="TaylorObit"/>

==Personal life and depictions in film==
On May 9, 1942, Taylor married Flora Love Morrison of [[Hennessey, Oklahoma]], whom he had met when she was visiting her father in Hawaii. Married for 64 years, the Taylors had two children: a daughter, Tina, son Ken II, three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.<ref name="StarBulletin"/> Taylor had homes in [[Anchorage, Alaska]] and [[Green Valley, Arizona]] after retiring from the Air Force.<ref name="NYTObit"/><ref name="FogofWar"/> While he lived in Anchorage, Taylor would vacation in Hawaii each year.<ref name="HandfulPilots"/> Taylor's son later retired as a brigadier general commanding the Alaska Air National Guard, the same position formerly held by his father.<ref name="Reluctant">{{Cite web|last=Meek|first=John Martin|title=Ken Taylor: The Reluctant Hero|url=http://www.pearlharborhero.net/id14.html|accessdate=March 23, 2009|postscript=<!--None-->|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rlwmiJKQ|archivedate=August 6, 2010}}</ref>

At a 50th anniversary symposium of the Pearl Harbor attack, Taylor met with a Japanese pilot who was part of the first wave of bombers to attack Pearl Harbor. The pilot reflected on Taylor's efforts, "I was impressed by Mr. Taylor's grit to storm into the pack of Japanese fighters", and Taylor also told a reporter "I have no hatred against Japanese people, but I do against those who started the war."<ref name="Symposium">{{cite news|last=Masui|first=Shigeo|title=Former Pearl Harbor Rivals Shake Hands 50 Years Later|work=[[Yomiuri Shimbun|The Daily Yomiuri]]|date=May 12, 1991|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/results/docview/docview.do?risb=21_T2977285608&format=GNBFI&sort=RELEVANCE&startDocNo=1&resultsUrlKey=29_T2977285611&cisb=22_T2977285610&treeMax=true&treeWidth=0&csi=145202&docNo=4|format=Registration required|accessdate=March 23, 2009}}</ref>

Taylor was a technical adviser for and was depicted in the 1970 film ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'', where actor [[Carl Reindel]] portrayed Taylor. The 2001 film ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' featured a sequence in which the characters portrayed by [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Josh Hartnett]] took to the skies to fight the Japanese. This sequence is understood to be a fill-in for Taylor's and Welch's roles in the actual Pearl Harbor attack, but the characters played by Affleck and Hartnett do not bear any other known similarities to Taylor and Welch. Unlike ''Tora! Tora! Tora!'', Taylor was not consulted for the ''Pearl Harbor'' film, and later called the adaptation "...&nbsp;a piece of trash...over-sensationalized and distorted."<ref name="TaylorObit"/>
