{{otherhurricaneuses|Hurricane Dennis (disambiguation)|the Atlantic hurricane of 2005}}

'''Hurricane Dennis''' was an early-forming major [[hurricane]] in the [[Caribbean]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]] during the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Dennis was the fourth named storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season. In July, the hurricane set several records for early season hurricane activity, becoming both the earliest formation of a fourth tropical cyclone and the strongest [[Atlantic hurricane]] ever to form before August, according to available records. 

Dennis hit [[Cuba]] twice as a Category 4 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]], and made landfall on the [[Florida Panhandle]] in the [[United States]] as a Category 3 storm less than a year after [[Hurricane Ivan]] did so. Dennis caused at least 89 deaths (42 direct) in the U.S. and [[Caribbean]] and caused $2.23 billion (2005 [[US dollars]]) in damages to the United States, as well as an approximately equal amount of damage in the Caribbean, primarily on [[Cuba]]. 

==Storm history==
Hurricane Dennis began as [[Tropical cyclone#types of tropical cyclones|Tropical Depression]] Four in the southeastern [[Caribbean Sea]] on the evening of [[July 4]], the first storm of the season to form away from [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]]. Almost immediately, it made landfall on [[Grenada]] as a tropical depression with 30 mph winds.<ref name="DennisTCR">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Dennis|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=December 2|accessyear=2005|format=PDF|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL042005_Dennis.pdf}}</ref> On the morning of [[July 5]], it strengthened into Tropical Storm Dennis in the eastern Caribbean; this was the earliest formation of an Atlantic season's fourth storm (by comparison, during the [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004 season]], [[Hurricane Alex (2004)|Hurricane Alex]] formed in early August and [[Hurricane Charley]] made landfall in [[Cuba]] on [[August 12]]). The newly named Dennis began moving rapidly to the west-northwest.

{{storm path|Dennis 2005 track.png}}
It was very clear from early weather forecasting models that Dennis had the potential to be a major storm, and it was predicted to reach hurricane status while still a tropical depression. It reached hurricane strength on the afternoon of [[July 6]] while approaching the southern coast of [[Hispaniola]], and it quickly became a strong and well-organized Category 1 storm on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. The next day it strengthened rapidly to become a Category 4 major hurricane, the earliest in an Atlantic hurricane season that a storm had reached that strength since [[Hurricane Audrey]] in the [[1957 Atlantic hurricane season|1957 season]]. After rapid strengthening, Dennis's track became slightly more northerly, bringing it between [[Jamaica]] and [[Haiti]] by [[July 7]]; both countries experienced high winds and heavy rain. 

As it approached Cuba and strengthened to just under [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] intensity, Dennis's track began to wobble. Meteorologists from the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) stated, "this type of erratic motion is not unusual for intensifying major hurricanes."<ref name="NHC-disc16">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Hurricane Dennis, 11:00 a.m. EDT, July 08 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=December 2|accessyear=2005|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al042005.discus.016.shtml}}</ref>

[[Image:Hurricane Dennis on July 7 2005 1550 UTC.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Hurricane Dennis on [[July 7]], [[2005]] at 1550 [[UTC]], beginning to pass to the north of [[Jamaica]]. Jamaica, eastern [[Cuba]], and [[Hispaniola]] are all obscured by the storm.]]
On [[July 7]], [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|Hurricane warnings]] were issued for Cuba at 11  a.m. [[North American Eastern Standard Time Zone|EDT]] (1500 [[UTC]]). Dennis made landfall near [[Punta del Ingl<U+00E9>s]] with 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h) winds late that day, and dropped down to a Category 3 storm while crossing the peninsula. As it moved back into the [[Gulf of Guacanayabo]], its wind speed increased to a peak of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h). Dennis then slammed into south-central Cuba just west of [[Punta Mangles Altos]] on [[July 8]], again with 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h) winds.<ref name="DennisTCR"/>

Crossing Cuba's mountainous terrain disrupted the storm's circulation, weakening Dennis to [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1]] intensity. However, NHC forecasts continued to indicate the possibility of a return to [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4]] status after [[Convection#Atmospheric convection|convection]] was re-established. This prediction was borne out when Dennis rapidly reintensified on the afternoon of [[July 9]] over the Gulf Loop Current, a reintensification described by NHC as having occurred "at a rate that bordered on insane."<ref name="NHC-disc23">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Hurricane Dennis, 10:00 p.m. CDT, July 09 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=December 2|accessyear=2005|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al042005.discus.023.shtml}}</ref> The storm reached Category 4 intensity again on the morning of [[July 10]]. At 1200 [[UTC]], the storm reached its peak intensity of 930&nbsp;[[mbar]] (27.47 inHg), surpassing [[Hurricane Audrey]] and setting a new record for the strongest storm to form prior to August; the new record stood for less than two weeks before [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]] surpassed it by reaching a pressure of 929&nbsp;[[mbar]] (27.43&nbsp;inHg). <ref name="DennisTCR">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Dennis|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=December 2|accessyear=2005|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL042005_Dennis.pdf}}</ref>

[[Image:Dennis2005filledrainblk.GIF|thumb|left|250px|Total rainfall from Dennis.]]
The storm continued moving north-northwest towards the central Gulf Coast, which had seen the landfalls of [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Arlene|Tropical Storm Arlene]] in June and [[Hurricane Cindy (2005)|Hurricane Cindy]] the previous week. By the morning of [[July 10]], hurricane warnings were in effect in the U.S. for the [[Florida Panhandle]], [[Alabama]], and [[Mississippi]], with tropical storm warnings extending further east and west along the coast. The NHC predicted a landing at near full strength in the late afternoon. However, much like [[Hurricane Ivan]] which struck in the same area the previous year, the storm weakened just before landfall; its maximum sustained winds dropped from 145&nbsp;mph (235&nbsp;km/h, Category 4 strength) to 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h, Category 3 strength). 

Continental landfall occurred at [[Santa Rosa Island, Florida|Santa Rosa Island]], between [[Pensacola, Florida]], and [[Navarre Beach, Florida]], at 2:25  p.m. CDT (1925 UTC) on [[July 10]]. Dennis was a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3 hurricane]] with winds of 115 to 120&nbsp;mph (185 to 195&nbsp;km/h). The highest official wind speed reported was a 121&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) wind gust at Navarre Beach.<ref name="NWS-pns">{{cite web|author=National Weather Service, Mobile-Pensacola Forecast Office|title=Public Information Statement|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=December 2|accessyear=2005|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mob/dennis_pns.shtml}}</ref> The storm lost strength over the day and was a tropical depression by early on [[July 11]]. The depression persisted, however, and gained a little strength while stalled over [[Illinois]] the next day. It finally dissipated in [[Ontario]] on [[July 13]], with advisories ceasing a full three days after landfall.

==Preparations==
Combined with Hurricane Cindy's landfall on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], uncertainty over Dennis's final landfall helped push oil prices to a record high of $61.28 a barrel on [[July 6]],<ref name="oil-prices-61.28">{{cite news|title=Hurricane Dennis approaches Gulf of Mexico|publisher=Associated Press|date=July 6 2005|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/07/06/international/i173520D51.DTL}}</ref> and again to $61.50 on [[July 7]],<ref name="oil-prices-61.50">{{cite news|title=Oil Prices surges to record|publisher=Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg|date=July 7 2005|url=http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000006&sid=aSz8CWOnmoDk&refer=home}}</ref> although they dropped below $60 on [[July 8]]. Dennis was originally forecast to strike [[Louisiana]], one of the oil-producing regions of the [[Gulf coast]]. Speculative spikes in oil prices due to Hurricane Dennis foreshadowed the far greater price spikes caused by Hurricanes [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] in late August and September.

In [[Haiti]] officials evacuated residents along the coastline, but noted that many were not obliging.<ref name="BBC-Haiti">{{cite news|title= Hurricane Dennis kills 10 in Cuba|publisher=BBC|date=July 11 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4659163.stm}}</ref> In [[Cuba]] more than 600,000 residents were moved from their homes to government shelters or other locations in anticipation of Dennis.<ref name="MSNBC-Cuba">{{cite news|title=Mop-up begins after Dennis sweeps Gulf Coast|publisher=MSNBC|date=July 11 2005|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8487520/}}</ref>

In the United States, the lower [[Florida Keys]] were placed under a mandatory evacuation order, and a nonresident and mobile home resident evacuation was ordered for the remainder of the Keys. This evacuation was cancelled the night of [[July 8]], as there was no longer sufficient time for stragglers in the Florida Keys to safely leave. Furthermore, the [[governor]]s of [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]] all declared [[state of emergency|states of emergency]] in their states.

At 6  a.m. CDT (2300 UTC) on [[July 9]], [[2005]], all southbound lanes on [[Interstate 65]] from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], Alabama, were closed. Traffic was redirected, making all four lanes northbound to allow evacuations. In Alabama residents in all parts of [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile County]], and those south of [[I-10]] in [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin County]], were ordered to evacuate. Similar orders were issued in Mississippi for parts of [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock]], and [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison]] counties; and for coastal areas in the [[Florida Panhandle]] stretching from [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia County]] to [[Bay County, Florida|Bay County]]. Likewise, military installations such as [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], [[Naval Air Station Whiting Field|Whiting Field]], [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin AFB]], [[Hurlburt Field]] and [[Tyndall Air Force Base|Tyndall AFB]] were all evacuated days before the storm.

Hurricane Dennis caused $4-6 billion (2005 [[US dollars]]) and at least 89 deaths in its path past [[Haiti]], [[Jamaica]], [[Cuba]], and the [[United States]].

===Caribbean===
Dennis first affected [[Jamaica]] while still a weak storm. One person was killed there and damage was estimated at $32 million [[United States dollar|USD]]. <ref name="DennisTCR"/>

In [[Haiti]], the [[Pan American Health Organization]] reports that 56 deaths and 36 injuries occurred; the storm also destroyed 929 homes and damaged another 3,000, leaving 1,500 families homeless. <ref name="IFRC">{{cite web|author=International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|title=Operations Update-Caribberan:Hurricanes Dennis & Emily|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/2005/IFRC/ifrc-carib-25jul.pdf|accessdate=December 26|accessyear=2005}}</ref> Among the dead were 16 who were killed when a bridge collapsed during the hurricane. <ref name="MSNBC-Cuba">{{cite news|title=Mop-up begins after Dennis sweeps Gulf Coast|publisher=MSNBC|date=July 11 2005|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8487520/}}</ref> Furthermore, 24 persons are still listed as missing. 

From there the storm moved to [[Cuba]], leaving 16 people dead and $1.4 billion in damages as it roared through the island, flattening houses and downing trees and power lines. According to reports from the Cuban government, 120,000 homes were damaged, 15,000 of which were destroyed. The citrus and vegetable industries were also devastated as Cuba's primary agricultural regions were the hardest hit. Nonetheless, [[Fidel Castro]] publicly refused US aid after the storm in protest of the ongoing US trade embargo against Cuba, stating that, "If they offered $1 billion we would say no."<ref name="Cuba-damages">{{cite news|title=Castro: Cuban death toll from Hurricane Dennis raised to 16|publisher=USA Today|date=July 12 2005|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/stormcenter/2005-07-12-dennis-cuba_x.htm?POE=WEAISVA}}</ref> Relayed reports from Cuban meteorologists stated that a gust up to 149 mph (239 km/h) was detected at [[Cienfuegos Province|Cienfuegos]], 85% of the power lines were down, and extensive damage to the communications infrastructure had occurred. Dennis was more destructive than the previous year's [[Hurricane Charley]] and was widely regarded as the worst hurricane to strike Cuba since [[Hurricane Flora]] in the [[1963 Atlantic hurricane season|1963 season]].

===United States===
[[Image:Beach front home damaged by hurricane dennis 2005.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A beachfront home in [[Navarre Beach, Florida]] largely destroyed by Hurricane Dennis.]]
In the [[United States]], damage was not as high as originally expected, mainly because Dennis was more compact and moved more quickly than initially forecast. Dennis made landfall approximately 30 miles to the east of where [[Hurricane Ivan]] had made landfall 10 months before, but did not cause as much damage as Ivan. Dennis moved about 7&nbsp;mph (11&nbsp;km/h) faster than Ivan at landfall, and had hurricane-force winds that only extended 40&nbsp;miles (65&nbsp;km) from its center, compared to Ivan's 105&nbsp;miles (170&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="MSNBC-Florida">{{cite news|title=Mop-up begins after Dennis sweeps Gulf Coast|publisher=MSNBC|date=July 11 2005|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8487520/}}</ref><ref name="BBC-landfall">{{cite news|title=Southern US mops up after Dennis |publisher=BBC|date=July 11 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4667307.stm}}</ref>

[[Image:Damage caused by Hurricane Dennis 2005.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Power lines and homes damaged by Dennis in [[Navarre Beach, Florida]].]]

During the height of the storm, Dennis produced storm surges as high as 9&nbsp;ft (3&nbsp;m) in the [[Apalachee Bay]] region, and as high as 7&nbsp;(2&nbsp;m) on the [[Florida Panhandle]],<ref name="FEMA 1-year">{{cite web|author=[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] | title = Monday Marks Hurricane Dennis Anniversary | date = [[July 7]], [[2006]] | accessdate = 2006-07-08 | publisher = [[FEMA]] | url = http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=27523}}</ref> and left 680,000 customers without electricity in four southern states. No significant damage was reported to most structures; however, insurers initially estimated that Dennis caused $3&ndash;$5 billion in insured damage,<ref name="Dr-Gray">{{cite web|author=Dr. William M. Gray|title=Forecast of Atlantic Hurricane Activity for October 2005|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=December 10|accessyear=2005|url=http://hurricane.atmos.colostate.edu/Forecasts/2005/oct2005/}}</ref> or approximately $6&ndash;$10 billion total (insured damage estimates are generally held to be approximately one-half of total damages). However, the NHC's Tropical Cyclone Report reported total damage in the United States as only $2.23 billion with $1.115 billion of insured damage.<ref name="DennisTCR"/>

Dennis caused at least 10 tornadoes in the U.S., although only one of them reached F1 status on the [[Fujita scale]]<ref name="DennisTCR">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Dennis|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=December 2|accessyear=2005|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL042005_Dennis.pdf}}</ref>. The storm dropped over 10&nbsp;inches (250&nbsp;mm) of rain in some areas of Alabama and Georgia (see the [[:Image:Dennis2005rain.png|rainfall graphic]]). Parts of Georgia, which had received heavy rain just days earlier from [[Hurricane Cindy (2005)|Hurricane Cindy]], suffered heavy flooding, and flash-floods were reported on the outskirts of the [[Atlanta]] metropolitan area.<ref name="Dennis-SRH">{{cite web|author=National Weather Service, Southern Regional Headquarters|title=The Menace of Dennis|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=February 5|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ffc/html/dennis05.shtml}}</ref><ref name="GeorgiaFaces">{{cite web|author=Stephanie Schupska (University of Georgia)|title=Dennis' rain, flooding slams Georgia homes, crops|publisher=UGA College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences|accessdate=February 5|accessyear=2006|url=http://georgiafaces.caes.uga.edu/getstory.cfm?storyid=2545}}</ref>

One beneficial effect of Hurricane Dennis was the rolling of the former [[USS Spiegel Grove (LSD-32)|USS ''Spiegel Grove'']].<ref name="Rolling">{{cite web|author=FloridaKeys.com|title=A Fascinating Dive Opportunity Takes a Turn for the Better|publisher=FloridaKeys.com|accessdate=December 10|accessyear=2005|url=http://www.fla-keys.com/spiegelgrove/}}</ref> ''Spiegel Grove'' was sunk in [[Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary]] in an attempt to create an artificial [[reef]]. However, the ship turned over and landed on the bottom upside down. Efforts to roll the ship were partially successful, bringing it onto its starboard side, but Hurricane Dennis completed the roll, bringing ''Spiegel Grove'' into its intended upright position.
