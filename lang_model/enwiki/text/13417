'''Thomas White''' (1593<U+2013>1676) was an [[English people|English]] [[Roman Catholic]] priest and scholar, known as a theologian, censured by the [[Inquisition]],<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Thomas White}}</ref> and also as a philosopher contributing to scientific and political debates.

==Life==
He was the son of Richard White of [[Hutton, Essex]] and Mary, daughter of [[Edmund Plowden]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=29274|title=White, Thomas|first=Beverley|last=Southgate}}</ref> He was educated at [[St Omer College]] and [[Douai College]]; and subsequently at [[Valladolid]]. He taught at Douai, and was president of the [[English College, Lisbon]]. Ultimately he settled in London.<ref>''Concise Dictionary of National Biography''</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alma-mahler.com/engl/gallery/spielort_lissabon.html |title=Convento dos Inglesinhos |language=Portuguese |accessdate=9 December 2010}} </ref>

His role in English Catholic life was caricatured by the hostile [[Jesuit]] [[Robert Pugh (Jesuit)|Robert Pugh]] in terms of the "Blackloist Cabal", a group supposed to include also [[Kenelm Digby]], [[Peter Fitton]], [[Henry Holden]], and [[John Sergeant (priest)|John Sergeant]]. In fact the [[Old Chapter]] was controlled by a Blackloist faction, in the period 1655 to 1660.<ref>Article ''Thomas White'' in ''Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers'' (2000), editor [[Andrew Pyle (philosopher)|Andrew Pyle]].</ref>

==Works==

He wrote around 40 theological works, around which the "Blackloist controversy" arose, taking its name from his alias Blackloe (Blacklow, Blacloe). 

The first philosophical work of [[Thomas Hobbes]], which remained unpublished until 1973, was on the ''De mundo dialogi tres'' of White, written in 1642.<ref>[[Richard Henry Popkin]], ''The Third Force in Seventeenth-century Thought'' (1992), p. 11.</ref> The ''Institutionum peripateticarum'' (1646, English translation ''Peripatetical Institutions'', 1656) represented itself as an exposition of the 'peripatetic philosophy' of Kenelm Digby. It was a scientific work, showing acceptance of the motion of the Earth and ideas of [[Galileo]], but disagreeing with him on the cause of the tides.<ref>John L. Russell, ''Copernican System in Great Britain'', p. 223 in Jerzy Dobrzycki, ''The Reception of Copernicus' Heliocentric Theory'' (1973).</ref><ref>Edward Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200-1687'' (1996), p. 671.</ref>

In 1654 he produced an edition of the ''Dialogues'' of the controversialist [[William Rushworth]] (Richworth). ''The Grounds of Obedience and Government'' (1655) was written during the Protectorate of [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Its implicit message, the Blackloist line for Catholics, was submission to the ''de facto'' ruler. The political aim was to secure an accommodation, and [[religious tolerance]] for Catholicism, and this was particularly controversial since the achievement of the objective might be at the cost of the access of Jesuits to England.<ref>M. A. Stewart, ''English Philosophy in the Age of Locke'' (2000), p. 148.</ref> 
He replied to [[Joseph Glanvill]]'s ''The Vanity of Dogmatizing'' (1661), an attack on Aristotelians, with ''Scire, sive sceptices'' (1663).<ref>[[W. R. Sorley]], ''A History of English Philosophy'' (2007 edition), p. 101.</ref>
