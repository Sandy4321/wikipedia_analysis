'''Sandra Marie Schmirler''', {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Saskatchewan Order of Merit|SOM]]}} (June 11, 1963 <U+2013> March 2, 2000) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[curling|curler]] who captured three Canadian Curling Championships (Scott [[Tournament of Hearts]]) and three [[World Women's Curling Championship|World Curling Championships]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usask.ca/100/alumni/sandra_schmirler.php|title=100 Alumni of Influence <U+2013> Sandra Schmirler|publisher=[[University of Saskatchewan]]|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}</ref> Schmirler also [[skip (curling)|skipped]] (captained) her Canadian team to a gold medal at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]], the first year [[Curling at the Winter Olympics|women's curling was a medal sport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/712847/Sandra-Schmirler|title=Sandra Schmirler (Canadian athlete)|publisher=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] Online|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.ca.msn.com/other/photos/canadian-athletes-taken-too-soon?page=4|title=Canadian athletes taken too soon <U+2013> Sandra Schmirler|last=Buckland|first=Jason|date=August 31, 2011|publisher=FOX Sports on MSN Canada|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}</ref> At tournaments where she was not competing, Schmirler sometimes worked as a commentator for [[CBC Sports]], which popularized her nickname "'''Schmirler the Curler'''"<ref name="nytobit">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/04/sports/sandra-schmirler-36-dies-olympic-curling-champion.html|title=Sandra Schmirler, 36, Dies; Olympic Curling Champion|last=McElroy|first=Kathleen|date=March 4, 2000|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref> and claimed she was the only person who had a name that rhymed with the sport she played. She died in 2000 at 36 of [[cancer]], leaving a legacy that extended outside of curling.

==Curling career==
While attending Biggar Composite School<ref name="libarchcan">{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/030001-1515-e.html|title=Sandra Schmirler|publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]]|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}</ref> in [[Biggar, Saskatchewan|Biggar]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]], Schmirler started curling in Grade 7 as part of the school's physical education program.

Prior to the 1988<U+2013>89 curling season, Schmirler and [[Jan Betker]] found themselves curling with different teammates, attempting to put together a stable squad. After a disappointing season, Schmirler decided to [[skip (curling)|skip]] for the 1990<U+2013>91 season, with Betker playing third. They recruited [[Joan McCusker|Joan Inglis (McCusker)]] to play second, and McCusker recommended [[Marcia Gudereit]] as a lead.<ref name="libarchcan"/><ref name=regina>{{cite web|url=http://www.regina.ca/residents/heritage-history/historical-biographies/biography-schmirler/|title=Historical Biographies: Schmirler, Sandra|publisher=City of Regina|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}</ref> This rink won the provincials in their first year together and finished in fourth place at the [[Scott Tournament of Hearts]].<ref>Lefko, p.28-29</ref><ref name="nytobit"/> In 1993, the Schmirler rink again won the provincial title to move on to the Tournament of Hearts. Her rink defeated [[Maureen Bonar]] in the finals, giving Saskatchewan its first national women's curling championship since [[Marj Mitchell]]'s win in 1980. The rink moved on to the [[1980 Royal Bank of Scotland World Women's Curling Championship|World Championship]] and defeated [[Janet Clews-Strayer]] from [[Germany]] in the final that year, winning Canada its sixth world women's title.<ref>Lefko, p.34-38</ref> The next season, she and her rink competed at the Tournament of Hearts as defending champions. The team finished first in the round robin, and defeated [[Connie Laliberte]] in the final to clinch a second consecutive Canadian championship. She and her team then represented Canada at the [[1994 World Women's Curling Championship|World Women's Curling Championship]], where they finished first in the round robin. She then advanced to the playoffs, and won the semifinal against [[Josefine Einsle]] of Germany and the final against [[Christine Cannon]] of Scotland. With her win in the final, she and her team clinched their second world championships, equalling their run from the previous season. At the time, no other Canadian rink (men or women) had won consecutive world championships.<ref name="libarchcan"/><ref>Lefko, p.46-47</ref> Schmirler returned to the [[1995 Scott Tournament of Hearts|Tournament of Hearts]] the next year as the defending champion. She and her team finished with a 8<U+2013>3 win-loss record and advanced to the playoffs as the second seed. She lost her next two games, however, and failed to advance to the final, losing a chance to win a third consecutive title. In 1997, Schmirler and her rink returned to the [[1997 Scott Tournament of Hearts|Tournament of Hearts]], where they finished with a 9<U+2013>2 win-loss record in the round robin. They advanced to the playoffs, and defeated [[Alison Goring]] of Ontario twice en route to winning her third Canadian championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/509041251.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+3%2C+1997&author=&pub=The+Spectator&edition=&startpage=S.3&desc=Ice+queen+of+Hearts%3A+Schmirler+Canadian+champion+third+time|title=Ice queen of Hearts: Schmirler Canadian champion third time|date=March 3, 1997|publisher=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}</ref> They then went to the World Championships, where they again finished first in the round robin and advanced to the playoffs, defeating [[Helena Blach Lavrsen]] of Denmark in the semifinals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/508531761.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+19%2C+1997&author=&pub=The+Spectator&edition=&startpage=D.5&desc=A+good+news%2C+bad+news+day%3A+Women+go+for+gold%2C+men+battle+for+bronze+at+World+Curling+Championships|title=A good news, bad news day: Women go for gold, men battle for bronze at World Curling Championships|date=April 19, 1997|publisher=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}</ref> and [[Andrea Sch<U+00F6>pp]] of Germany in the final to win a third world title.<ref>Lefko, p.57</ref> After each of these three seasons, her rink was named "Team of the Year" by Sask Sport.<ref name="Esask"/><ref name="betkerbio">{{cite web|url=http://reginastars.rbdc.ca/stars.htm|title=Dancing with Regina's Stars: Meet the Stars: Jan Betker|year=2008|publisher=Regina Ballroom Dancing Club|accessdate=June 25, 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Schmirler97olympictrials.png|thumb|left|Schmirler's in-off for three to win the [[1997 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]] against [[Shannon Kleibrink]] is one of her most famous shots, both in terms of degree of difficulty and for the fact that it sent her team to the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].]]

In the [[1998 Winter Olympics]], curling became a medal sport for the first time. [[1997 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials|Olympic trials]] were held in November 1997 to select Canada's representatives at the Olympics. The Schmirler rink finished first in the round robin, and defeated [[Shannon Kleibrink]] in the final with a score of 9<U+2013>6, behind strong shot making from Schmirler and McCusker.<ref>Lefko, p.62-65</ref> Schmirler made a difficult in-off to win and clinch the berth to the Olympics. The [[Curling at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Olympics]] were held in [[Nagano]], [[Japan]]. The Schmirler rink was among the favourites for gold, but there was a strong field in the event. After finishing the round robin in first place with six wins and one loss,<ref name="libarchcan"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/498479241.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+13%2C+1998&author=&pub=The+Record&edition=&startpage=C.4&desc=Schmirler+clinches+1st+place+with+victory+over+Germany|title=Schmirler clinches 1st place with victory over Germany|date=February 13, 1998|publisher=[[Kitchener Record]]|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}</ref> Canada played their semifinal game against [[Great Britain]]'s [[Kirsty Hay]]. The game was tied after regulation play and went to an extra end, where Schmirler barely made a draw with her last rock to win the game. In the final against [[Denmark]]'s Helena Blach Lavrsen, Schmirler secured a win in nine ends, winning Canada the gold medal.<ref name="libarchcan"/><ref name=regina/><ref name="nytobit"/><ref>Lefko, p.72-77</ref> After winning the gold medal, Sandra appeared on the front page of the ''[[New York Times]]''.<ref>Lefko, p.77</ref> After the Olympics, the Schmirler rink was named 'Team of the Year' by the [[Canadian Press]].

==Personal life==
===Family and education===
Schmirler was born to her parents Shirley and Art. She was born with a [[club foot]], which required her to wear a cast for two months. She had two older sisters, Carol and Beverley.<ref>Lefko, p.8</ref> She attended high school in Biggar, and moved to Saskatoon to attend university. She started out towards a degree in [[computer science]], but transferred after her first year to work for a degree in [[physical education]].<ref>Lefko, p.17</ref> She convocated with a Bachelor of Science in Physical Education in 1985.<ref>Lefko, p.21</ref> After moving to Regina, she met and married Del Peterson on August 1, 1987. They separated in 1992, and divorced a year later.<ref>Lefko, p.31</ref> She curled under her married name of Sandra Peterson from 1987 to 1996.<ref>Lefko, p. 27, 53</ref>

In 1993, teammate Marcia Gudereit introduced Schmirler to Shannon England. On June 22, 1996, they were married.<ref>Lefko, p.53</ref> In 1997, Schmirler was pregnant with their first child. When this information was revealed to reporters at the Scott Tournament of Hearts, they jokingly dubbed her "Schmirler the Hurler". On September 15, 1997, their daughter Sara Marion was born.<ref>Lefko, p.57-58</ref> In April 1999, Sandra's father Art Schmirler died from [[esophageal cancer]].<ref name=regina/> On June 30, 1999, the couple's second daughter, Jenna Shirley, was born.<ref>Lefko, p.93</ref>

===Illness and death===
After Jenna's birth, Schmirler experienced many health problems. She had suffered from back pain, which was thought to be pregnancy related, and following Jenna's birth, she began to suffer from stomach pains.<ref name=regina/> Tests showed that a cancerous node the size of a fist had developed behind her heart.<ref name="nytobit"/><ref>Lefko, p.97</ref> As her condition worsened, she underwent surgery on September 6, 1999. During surgery, a dead piece of the tumour broke off and released a blood clot into her lung. Her heart stopped beating, and only emergency heart massage kept her alive.<ref>Lefko, p.94-95</ref> Almost a month after being diagnosed with cancer, doctors finally provided a specific diagnosis <U+2013> [[adenocarcinoma|metastatic adenocarcinoma]], with an unknown primary site.<ref name=regina/> Because no one could pin down where the cancer came from, Sandra referred to it as "the cancer from Mars."<ref name="Lefko, p.101">Lefko, p.101</ref> In addition to [[chemotherapy]] and radiation, Schmirler explored [[orthomolecular medicine]] through the Canadian Cancer Research Group. This form of [[alternative medicine]] involves large doses of vitamins and nutrients.<ref name="Lefko, p.101"/>

In 2000, Schmirler worked as colour commentator for CBC during [[Canadian Junior Curling Championships|Canada's national junior curling championships]].<ref name="libarchcan"/><ref>Lefko, p.110</ref> During her illness, Schmirler had been largely removed from the public eye. While in [[Moncton]] for the championships, Schmirler held a press conference to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: "There were three goals I had coming out of this thing, and the first one was to look after my family. And the second one...because I curl so much, I've never taken a hot vacation, so I'm going to put my feet in the sand in a warm place. And the last one was to actually be here today, and I thank CBC, I thank Lawrence (Kimber), and Joan Mead."<ref>Lefko, p. 113-120</ref>

After returning from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The decision was made not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy.<ref>Lefko, p.128</ref> She had been scheduled to work the [[2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts]], but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by [[The Sports Network|TSN's]] [[Vic Rauter]]. "I'm still fighting hard and I still hope to make it to the [[Tim Hortons Brier|Brier]], not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping to be in your green shoes (at the Scott). But keep things in perspective. There are other things in life besides curling, which I have found. But I hope to be on the curling trail again next year. And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra."<ref>Lefko, p.133</ref> However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to [[palliative care]].<ref>Lefko, p.133-134</ref> She died in her sleep at the [[Pasqua Hospital]] Palliative Care Unit<ref name="nytobit"/> on the morning of March 2, 2000 at age 36.<ref name="CBC1">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/03/02/schmirlerobit000302.html|title=Saskatchewan mourns Sandra Schmirler|date=March 2, 2000|publisher=CBC|accessdate=June 25, 2008}}</ref><ref name=regina/> She was survived by her husband and her two daughters.<ref name="nytobit"/><ref name="msn"/>

Her death caused reactions not just within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chr<U+00E9>tien]] said in a statement: "All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed."<ref name="nytobit"/><ref>Lefko, p.141-142</ref> In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.<ref name="nytobit"/>
