'''''A Story of Floating Weeds''''' is a 1934 [[silent film]] directed by [[Yasujiro Ozu]] which he later remade as ''[[Floating Weeds]]'' in 1959.

The film includes the first appearance of what became one of the director's trademarks: a title sequence in which the credits appear against a sackcloth backdrop. Not only does this fit the story's pastoral setting, but since the credit sequences of Ozu's previous films had featured cartoony illustrations, the choice of humble sackcloth indicates the emergence of his mature film-making style. It earned Ozu the Kinema Junp<U+00F4> Critics' Prize for Best Japanese Film, his third in as many years.
