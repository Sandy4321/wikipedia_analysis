Cornwell and his brother were also corporators and shareholders of the Potomac White Sand Company of [[Green Spring, West Virginia|Green Spring]] following its incorporation in 1902. He served as the president of the Hampshire Southern Railroad and it was constructed under his leadership, beginning in June 1909.

In addition to serving as the railroad company's president, Cornwell also served on the [[board of directors]] of the Winchester and Western Railroad.
