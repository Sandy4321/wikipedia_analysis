She achieved popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her [[music video]]s, which became a fixture on [[MTV]]. Madonna is known for reinventing both her music and image, and for retaining a standard of autonomy within the recording industry. [[Music criticism|Music critics]] have acclaimed her musical productions which have also been known to induce controversy. Often referred to as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Pop]]", she is cited as an influence among [[List of artists influenced by Madonna|other artists]] around the world.

Born in [[Bay City, Michigan]], Madonna moved to [[New York City]] to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing in the music groups [[Breakfast Club (band)|Breakfast Club]] and Emmy, she signed with [[Sire Records]] (an affiliate of [[Warner Bros. Records]]) in 1982 and released her [[Madonna (album)|self-titled debut album]] the following year. She followed it with a series of commercially successful albums, including the [[Grammy Award]] winners ''[[Ray of Light]]'' (1998) and ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' (2005). Throughout her career, she has written and produced most of her songs, with many of them reaching number one on the record charts, including "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]", "[[Into the Groove]]", "[[Papa Don't Preach]]", "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]", "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]", "[[Frozen (Madonna song)|Frozen]]", "[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]", "[[Hung Up]]", and "[[4 Minutes (Madonna song)|4 Minutes]]".

Madonna's popularity was further enhanced by her film roles; she garnered a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress <U+2013> Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'' (1996) while most of her other films have received harsh feedback. Her other ventures include fashion design, writing children's books, and filmmaking. She has been acclaimed as a businesswoman, most notably after she founded entertainment company [[Maverick (company)|Maverick]] (including the label [[Maverick Records]]) in 1992 as a joint venture with [[Time Warner]]. In 2007, she signed an unprecedented US $120 million [[360 deal]] with [[Live Nation]].

Madonna has sold more than 300 million records worldwide and is recognized as the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling female recording artist of all time]] by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. According to the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), she is the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century and [[List of best-selling music artists in the United States|the second best-selling female artist in the United States]], with 64.5 million [[RIAA certification|certified]] albums. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked her at number two, behind only [[The Beatles]], on the [[Billboard Hot 100 50th Anniversary Charts|''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists]], making her the most successful solo artist in the history of American singles chart. The magazine also declared her as the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|top-touring female artist of all time]]. She became one of the five founding members of the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in her first year of eligibility.

==Life and career==

===1958<U+2013>81: Early life and career beginnings===
Madonna Louise Ciccone was born to a Catholic family in [[Bay City, Michigan]], on August 16, 1958. She is the eldest daughter of Silvio Anthony "Tony" Ciccone and Madonna Louise Fortin (c. 1933 <U+2013> December 1, 1963).<ref name="mom"/> Her father's parents were immigrants from [[Pacentro]], Italy, while her mother had [[French people|French]] ancestry.<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=10}}</ref> Tony worked as an engineer designer for [[Chrysler]] and [[General Motors]]. Since Madonna had the same name as her mother, family members called her "Little Nonni". She has two elder brothers, Anthony (born 1956) and Martin (born 1957), and three younger siblings, Paula (born 1959), [[Christopher Ciccone|Christopher]] (born 1960), and Melanie (born 1962).<ref name="thechild">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1400097/The-child-who-became-a-star.html|title=The Child Who Became a Star: Madonna Timeline|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|date=July 26, 2006|accessdate=June 9, 2008}}</ref>

Upon receiving [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|confirmation]] in 1966, she adopted [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] as an additional [[confirmation name]].<ref>{{harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=92}}</ref> She was raised in the Detroit suburbs of [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] and Avon Township (now [[Rochester Hills, Michigan|Rochester Hills]]). Months before her mother died from breast cancer, Madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality, although she did not understand the reason.<ref name="mom"/> Her mother was at a loss to explain her medical condition, and often began to cry when Madonna questioned her about it. Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=47}}</ref>

[[File:Madonna family in their vineyard cropped.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Tony Ciccone with his wife Joan, pictured in 2009]]
Madonna turned to her paternal grandmother in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly to take the place of their beloved mother. Madonna later told ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' that she saw herself in her youth as a "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades..... I wanted to be somebody." Terrified that Tony could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him.<ref name="mom"/>

In 1966, Tony married the family's housekeeper Joan Gustafson, and they had two children: Jennifer (born 1967) and Mario (born 1968).<ref name="thechild"/> At this point, Madonna started to resent him for decades, and developed a rebellious attitude.<ref name="mom"/> She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and then West Middle School. She was known for her high [[Grade (education)|grade point average]], and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior, she would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the [[jungle gym|monkey bars]] during recess, and pull up her skirt during class<U+2014>all so that the boys could see her underwear.<ref name="tarabio">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=23}}</ref>

Madonna later attended [[Rochester Adams High School]] where she became a straight-A student and a member of the cheerleading squad.<ref>{{harvnb|Claro|1994|pp=24, 27}}</ref> After graduating, she received a dance scholarship to the [[University of Michigan]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Tilden |first=Imogen |title =Madonna|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=July 4, 2001|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/jul/04/netnotes.imogentilden|accessdate=May 29, 2008|}}</ref> She convinced her father to allow her to take ballet lessons<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=12}}</ref> and was persuaded by Christopher Flynn, her ballet teacher, to pursue a career in dance.<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|pp=26<U+2013>29}}</ref> In 1978, she dropped out of college and relocated to New York City.<ref>{{cite episode| title = A Star with Staying Power|url=http://edition.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/madonna/profile.html|airdate =Saturday 11 am and Sunday 7 pm|series= People in the News| network= [[CNN]]|credits =Hosted by Paula Zahn}}</ref> She had little money and worked as a waitress at [[Dunkin' Donuts]] and with [[modern dance]] troupes.<ref>{{cite episode|title = Madonna: Queen of Pop|series= Biography| network = [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]|minutes=5|credits=Hosted by Jim Wallasky}}</ref> Madonna said of her move to New York, "It was the first time I'd ever taken a plane, the first time I'd ever gotten a taxi cab. I came here with $35 in my pocket. It was the bravest thing I'd ever done."<ref>{{harvnb|Rettenmund|1995|p=45}}</ref> She started to work as a backup dancer for other established artists. During a late night, Madonna was returning from a rehearsal, when a pair of men held her at knifepoint and forced her to perform [[fellatio]]. Madonna later commented that "the episode was a taste of my weakness, it showed me that I still could not save myself in spite of all the strong-girl show. I could never forget it."<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=56}}</ref>

While performing as a backup singer and dancer for the French disco artist [[Patrick Hernandez]] on his 1979 world tour, Madonna became romantically involved with musician Dan Gilroy.<ref name="tarabio"/><ref name="goldmine">{{cite journal|title=Madonna <U+2013> From Genesis to Revelations|first=Bruce|last=Baron|work=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]|publisher=[[F+W Media]]|date=July 2, 1999|volume=25|issue=494|issn=1055-2685}}</ref> Together, they formed her first [[rock music|rock]] band, the [[Breakfast Club (band)|Breakfast Club]],<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=23}}</ref> for which Madonna sang and played drums and guitar.

Madonna came under further fire when she performed "Like a Virgin" at the first 1984 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] (VMA) where she appeared on stage atop a giant wedding cake, wearing a wedding dress and white gloves. The performance is noted by MTV as an iconic moment in VMA history.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1618580/20090812/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Can Lady Gaga Top These Iconic MTV VMA Performances?|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=August 12, 2009|publisher=MTV News.

In January 1989, Madonna signed an endorsement deal with soft-drink manufacturer, [[Pepsi]]. In one of her Pepsi commercials, she debuted her song "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]". The corresponding music video featured many [[Christian symbolism|Catholic symbols]] such as [[stigmata]] and [[cross burning]], and a dream about making love to a saint, leading the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to condemn the video. Religious groups sought to ban the commercial and boycott Pepsi products.

In 1992, Madonna had a role in ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' as Mae Mordabito, a baseball player on an all-women's team. She recorded the film's theme song, "[[This Used to Be My Playground]]", which became a Hot 100 number one hit.<ref name="ach"/> The same year, she founded her own entertainment company, [[Maverick (entertainment company)|Maverick]], consisting of a record company ([[Maverick Records]]), a film production company ([[Maverick Films]]), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions.

Madonna's music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny. [[Robert McQueen Grant|Robert M. Grant]], author of ''Contemporary Strategy Analysis'' (2005), commented that what has brought Madonna success is "certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist, musician, dancer, songwriter, or actress, Madonna's talents seem modest."<ref name=CSA>{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=6}}</ref> He asserts Madonna's success is in relying on the talents of others, and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career.<ref name=CSA/> Madonna's approach was far from the music industry wisdom of "Find a winning formula and stick to it." Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Grant concluded that "having established herself as the queen of popular music, Madonna did not stop there, but continued re-inventing."<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=3}}</ref> [[Musicologist]] [[Susan McClary]] wrote that "Madonna's art itself repeatedly deconstructs the traditional notion of the unified subject with finite ego boundaries. Her pieces explore, varios ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition."<ref>{{harvnb|Lancaster|di Leonardo|1997|p=355}}</ref>

Throughout her career, Madonna has been involved in writing and producing most of her own music.<ref name="music credit">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/madonna-mn0000237205/credits |title=Madonna > Credits|publisher=Allmusic.

I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'."<ref name="Gnojewski57">{{harvnb|Gnojewski|2007|p=57}}</ref> [[Mark Kamins]], her first producer, believed that Madonna is "a much underrated musician and lyricist."<ref name="morton20">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=20}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' has named her "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for [[Hook (music)|hooks]] and indelible lyrics."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/madonna/albumguide|title=Madonna: Album Guide|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}</ref> According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing "incredible" hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music.

Before emerging as a pop star, Madonna has spent her early years in [[rock music]] alongside her bands, Breakfast Club and Emmy.<ref name="rock star">{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/23298744|title=Madonna: A true blue rock star|last=Sclafani|first=Tony|date=March 7, 2008|accessdate=January 14, 2011|publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}</ref> While performing with Emmy, Madonna recorded about 12-14 songs which resemble the [[punk rock]] of that period.<ref name="goldmine"/> Her early rock roots also can be found on the demo album ''[[Pre-Madonna]]''.<ref name="rock star"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] noted that with her self-titled debut album, Madonna began her career as a [[disco]] diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the beginning of the '80's, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and according to Erlewine, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing [[dance music]] as mainstream music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/madonna-mw0000268192|title=Madonna <U+2013> Madonna > Overview|publisher=Allmusic. Rovi Corporation|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}</ref> The album's songs reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy hooks, highly polished [[arrangement]]s and Madonna's own vocal style. Her second album, ''Like a Virgin'' (1984), foreshadowed several trends in her later works. It contained references to classical works ([[pizzicato]] synthesizer line that opens "[[Angel (Madonna song)|Angel]]"); potential negative reaction from social groups ("[[Dress You Up]]" was blacklisted by the [[Parents Music Resource Center]]); and retro styles ("Shoo-Bee-Doo", Madonna's homage to [[Motown]]).<ref name="fouzvocal">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|pp=59<U+2013>61}}</ref>

Her mature artistic statement was visible in ''True Blue'' (1986) and ''Like a Prayer'' (1989). In ''True Blue'', she incorporated [[classical music]] in order to engage an older audience who had been skeptical of her music.<ref>{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=277}}</ref> ''Like a Prayer'' introduced live recorded songs and incorporated different genres of music, including dance, [[funk]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[gospel music]].<ref name="bookalbum"/> Her versatility was further shown on ''I'm Breathless'', which consists predominantly of the 1940s [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[showtune]]-flavoured [[jazz]], [[swing music|swing]] and [[big band]] tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=madonna |title=CG: Madonna |publisher=Robert Christgau |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref> Madonna continued to compose ballads and [[Glossary of musical terminology|uptempo]] dance songs for ''Erotica'' (1992) and ''Bedtime Stories'' (1994).

===Vocal style and instruments===
Possessing a [[mezzo-soprano]] vocal range,<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|2003|p=34}}</ref> Madonna has always been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Chaka Khan]].<ref name="fouzvocal"/> [[Mark Bego]], author of ''Madonna: Blonde Ambition'', called her "the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs", despite not being a "heavyweight talent."<ref>{{harvnb|Bego|2000|p=122}}</ref> According to [[MSNBC]] critic Tony Sclafani, "Madonna's vocals are the key to her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs "straight," but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways [[John Lennon]] and [[Bob Dylan]] did."<ref name="rock star"/> Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal [[timbre]] in her early albums which became pass<U+00E9> in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as "Minnie Mouse on helium".<ref name="fouzvocal"/> During the filming of ''Evita'', Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, "I studied with a vocal coach for ''Evita'' and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using.

===Influences===
According to Taraborrelli, the defining moment of Madonna's childhood was the tragic and untimely death of her beloved mother.<ref name="mom">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|pp=11<U+2013>13}}</ref> Psychiatrist Keith Ablow suggests her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Madonna at a time when her personality was still forming. According to Ablow, the younger a child is at the time of a serious loss, the more profound the influence and the longer lasting the impact. He concludes that "some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Madonna is not different than them."<ref name="mom"/> Conversely, author [[Lucy O'Brien]] feels the impact of the rape she suffered is, in fact, the motivating factor behind everything Madonna has done, more important even than the death of her mother: "It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected. She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/madonna-like-an-icon-by-lucy-obrien-463929.html|title=Madonna: Like an Icon, By Lucy O'Brien|last=Burston|first=Paul|date=September 9, 2007|accessdate=September 6, 2010|work=The Independent | location=London | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100928045808/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/madonna-like-an-icon-by-lucy-obrien-463929.html | archivedate=August 30, 2012}}</ref>

As they grew older, Madonna and her sisters would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began drifting farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come to think that she resembled poet [[Anne Sexton]] and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with [[Sylvia Plath]] being her favourite.<ref name="mom"/> Later, Madonna commented: "We were all wounded in one way or another by [her death], and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying<U+2014>after I got over my heartache<U+2014>I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself."<ref name="mom"/> Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. "Her death had taught [Madonna] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness<U+2014>particularly her own<U+2014>and wanted to be the queen of her own castle."<ref name="mom"/>

In 1985, Madonna commented that the first song to ever make a strong impression on her was "[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]" by [[Nancy Sinatra]]; she said it summed up her own "take-charge attitude".<ref name="hot"/> As a young woman, she attempted to broaden her taste in literature, art, and music, and during this time became interested in classical music. She noted that her favorite style was [[baroque music|baroque]], and loved [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin|Chopin]] because she liked their "feminine quality".<ref>{{harvnb|St. Michael|2004|p=199}}</ref> Madonna's major influences include [[Karen Carpenter]], [[The Supremes]] and [[Led Zeppelin]], as well as dancers [[Martha Graham]] and [[Rudolf Nureyev]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9901/19/madonna.lkl/|last=King|first=Larry|authorlink=Larry King|title=Interview: Madonna reviews life on Larry King Live| publisher=CNN| date=January 19, 1999|accessdate=June 9, 2008}}</ref> She also grew up listening to [[David Bowie]], whose show was the first rock concert she ever attended.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockhall.com/inductees/david-bowie/transcript/madonna-accepts-for-david-bowi/|title=Madonna accepts for David Bowie|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref>

Madonna's Italian-Catholic background and her relationship with her parents are reflected in the album ''Like a Prayer''.<ref name="laprsreview"/> It was an evocation of the impact religion had on her career.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|pp=126<U+2013>131}}</ref> Her video for the title track contains Catholic symbolism, such as the stigmata.

During her childhood, Madonna was inspired by actors, later saying, "I loved Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe. They were all incredibly funny&nbsp;... and I saw myself in them&nbsp;... my girlishness, my knowingness and my innocence."<ref name="hot">{{cite journal|last=Worrell|first=Denise|title=Madonna, Why She's Hot|journal=Time|date=May 27, 1985|issn= 0040-781X|ref=harv}}</ref> Her "Material Girl" music video recreated Monroe's look in the song "[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]", from the film ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' (1953). She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, in preparation for the film ''Who's That Girl''. The video for "Express Yourself" (1989) was inspired by [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[silent film]] ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927). The video for "Vogue" recreated the style of [[Glamour (presentation)|Hollywood glamour]] photographs, in particular those by [[Horst P. Horst]], and imitated the poses of [[Marlene Dietrich]], Carole Lombard, and [[Rita Hayworth]], while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired her, including [[Bette Davis]], described by Madonna as an idol.<ref name="carrie"/><ref>{{harvnb|Victor|2001|p=78}}</ref> However, Madonna's film career has been largely received negatively by the film critic community. Stephanie Zacharek, critic for ''Time'' magazine, stated that, "[Madonna] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it's tough to watch, because she's clearly trying her damnedest."<ref name="filmcareer">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=293}}</ref> According to biographer [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]], "Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately she is deeply hurt."<ref name="filmcareer"/> After the [[box office bomb]] ''Swept Away'' (2002), Madonna vowed that she would never again act in a film, hoping her repertoire as a bad actress would never be discussed again.<ref name="filmcareer"/>

Influences also came to her from the art world, most notably through the works of artist [[Frida Kahlo]].<ref>{{harvnb|Voller|1999|p=170}}</ref> The music video of the song "Bedtime Story" featured images inspired by the paintings of Kahlo and [[Remedios Varo]].<ref>{{harvnb|Guralnick|Wolk|2000|p=149}}</ref> Madonna is also a collector of [[Tamara de Lempicka]]'s [[Art Deco]] paintings and has included them in her music videos and tours.<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=47}}</ref> Her video for "[[Hollywood (Madonna song)|Hollywood]]" (2003) was an homage to the work of photographer [[Guy Bourdin]]; Bourdin's son subsequently filed a lawsuit for unauthorised use of his father's work.<ref>{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Susman|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,491440,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|title=Strike a Pose|date=September 30, 2003|accessdate=June 14, 2008}}</ref> Pop artist [[Andy Warhol]]'s use of sadomasochistic imagery in his underground films were reflected in the music videos for "Erotica" and "Deeper and Deeper".<ref>{{harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=69}}</ref>

Madonna is dedicated to [[Kabbalah]], and in 2004, she adopted the name [[Esther (given name)|Esther]] which in [[Persian language|Persian]] means "star".<ref name="kab"/> She has donated millions of dollars to New York and London schools teaching the subject.<ref name="kab">{{harvnb|Friskics-Warren|2006|p=72}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/kabbalah/kabbalah88.html |title=Madonna opens her own school|work=[[The Times of India]]|last=Ross|first=Rick|date= August 5, 2004|accessdate= February 20, 2006|publisher=[[The Times Group]]}}</ref> She faced opposition from rabbis who felt Madonna's adoption of the Kabbalah was sacrilegious and a case of celebrity [[wikt:dilettantism|dilettantism]].

===Music videos and performances===
In ''The Madonna Companion'', biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that more than any other recent pop artist, Madonna had used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work.<ref name="metz2">{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=161}}</ref> According to them, many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context, while referring to the music. [[Cultural critic]] [[Mark C. Taylor]] in his book ''Nots'' (1993) felt that the [[postmodern art]] form par excellence is video and the reigning "queen of video" is Madonna. He further asserted that "the most remarkable creation of MTV is Madonna. The responses to Madonna's excessively provocative videos have been predictably contradictory."<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1993|p=191}}</ref> The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as "Papa Don't Preach", "Like a Prayer", or "Justify My Love" had to do with the music videos created to promote the songs and their impact, rather than the songs themselves.<ref name="metz2"/> Morton felt that "artistically, Madonna's songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos."<ref name="morton20"/>

Madonna's initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamor.<ref name="metz2"/> She was able to transmit her avant-garde downtown New York fashion sense to the American audience.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=163}}</ref> The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the ''True Blue'' era.<ref>{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=145}}</ref> Author [[Douglas Kellner]] noted, "such 'multiculturalism' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences."<ref>{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=271}}</ref> Madonna's Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time, in the form of boleros and layered skirts, accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of "La Isla Bonita".<ref>{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=44}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rettenmund|1995|p=34}}</ref>

Academics noted that with her videos, Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex.<ref>{{harvnb|Welton|1998|p=234}}</ref> This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for "Like a Prayer". The video included scenes of an African-American church choir, Madonna being attracted to a statue of a black saint, and singing in front of burning crosses. This mix of the sacred and the profane upset the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and resulted in the Pepsi commercial withdrawal.<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=70}}</ref> In 2003, MTV named her "The Greatest Music Video Star Ever" and said that "Madonna's innovation, creativity and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award."<ref>{{harvnb|Landrum|2007|p=258}}</ref>

Madonna's emergence occurred during the advent of MTV; Chris Nelson from ''[[The New York Times]]'' spoke of pop artists like Madonna saying, "MTV, with its almost exclusively [[lip sync|lip-synched]] videos, ushered in an era in which average music fans might happily spend hours a day, every day, watching singers just mouth the words."<ref name="sync">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/01/arts/music/01NELS.html?pagewanted=1|title=Lip-Synching Gets Real|last=Nelson|first=Chris|date=February 1, 2004|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 25, 2010}}</ref> The symbiotic relationship between the music video and lip-syncing led to a desire for the spectacle and imagery of the music video to be transferred to live stage shows. He added, "Artists like Madonna and [[Janet Jackson]] set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing."<ref name="sync"/> Thor Christensen of the ''[[The Dallas Morning News|Dallas Morning News]]'' commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, she has subsequently reorganized her performances by "stay[ing] mostly still during her toughest singing parts and [leaves] the dance routines to her backup troupe&nbsp;... [r]ather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time."<ref name="lip-sync">{{Cite news| last1 = Christensen|first1 = Thor|title = Loose Lips: Pop Singers' Lip-Syncing In Concert Is An Open Secret| page = B.8|newspaper = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date = September 15, 2001| issn = 1068624X| ref = harv| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

To allow for greater movement while dancing and singing, Madonna was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. Because of her prominent usage, the microphone design came to be known as the "Madonna mic".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://harada-sound.com/sound/handbook/rfmics.html|title=Kai Harada, sound designer and sound handbook author, writes about "The Feeding and Care of RF Microphones|last=Harada|first=Kai|date=September 1, 2007|publisher=Harada-Sound.com|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/wimbledons-no-1-seat-455502.html|title=Wimbledon's No 1 seat|last=Castle|first=Andrew|date=July 2, 2007|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent News & Media|accessdate=March 17, 2010|authorlink=Andrew Castle|location=London}}</ref> Metz noted that Madonna represents a [[paradox]] as she is often perceived as living her whole life as a performance. While her big-screen performances are panned, her live performances are critical successes.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=290}}</ref> Madonna was the first artist to have her concert tours as reenactment of her music videos. Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally, the fact that images from Madonna's videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the realism of the original videos. Thus her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized.<ref>{{harvnb|Diamond|1996|p=202}}</ref> Taraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia, latest technology and sound systems, Madonna's concerts and live performances are deemed as "extravagant show piece, a walking art show."<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=90}}</ref>
