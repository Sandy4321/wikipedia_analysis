The '''Speak Good English Movement''' (SGEM) is a Singapore Government campaign<ref name="launch">[http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90830afp.htm Singapore to launch Speak-good-English campaign] - Agence France Presse in Singapore, 30 August 1999. Retrieved 18 November 2010</ref> to "encourage Singaporeans to speak grammatically correct English that is universally understood".<ref name="SGEwebsite">[http://www.goodenglish.org.sg/about/about-us/what-we-do/ Speak Good English Movement - What We Do] Retrieved 18 November 2010</ref>
It was launched by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong on 29 April 2000. The purpose was to ensure that Singaporeans can recognise the importance of speaking Standard English and also to encourage them to use it.<ref name="nzh">[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10672269 Locals told to speak English, not Singlish] - NZ Herald, 10 September 2010. Retrieved 18 November 2010</ref>

==Background==
English was introduced in 1819 with [[Founding of modern Singapore | the establishment of the modern port in Singapore]]. The port attracted migrants from neighbouring countries, such as China and India, resulting in a [[languages of Singapore|diverse linguistic landscape]]. Proximity to these various languages has, over the generations, influenced the local variety of English. The colloquial form of [[Singaporean English]] is called [[Singlish]], and is largely characterised by the mixture of local expressions with English (e.g. the use of discourse particles such as ''lah'').<ref name=singlish>"You see me no up" - Is Singlish a problem? - Chng, Huang Hoon. ''Language Problems & Language Planning'', 27(1), 45-60, 2003 </ref>  Singlish is commonly used by Singaporeans in informal contexts,<ref> [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501020729-322685,00.html A War of words over 'Singlish'] - TIME, 22 July 2002. Retrieved 18 November 2010</ref> however it can be incomprehensible to non-Singaporeans. 

When the Speak Good English Movement was launched in 1999, Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] described Singlish as "English corrupted by Singaporeans" and "broken, ungrammatical English".<ref name="launch"/>  According to the local government, mastery of Standard English is imperative to raise living standards in Singapore, <ref name="nzh" /> and Singlish causes problems when Singaporeans need to communicate in English, the "global language of commerce, business and technology".<ref name="bbcnews">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1261986.stm Singapore attack on Singlish] - BBC News, 5 April 2001. Retrieved 18 November 2010</ref> The movement thus campaigns for an improved standard of English used in Singapore. In hopes of extending its reach, the movement adopts a different theme and target group each year.<ref name ="SGEwebsite" /> Also, the movement collaborates with various partner organizations to provide programmes in line with the movement's goals.

==Aims==
The campaign aims to discourage the use of Singlish and encourage the use of a more standardized form of English (i.e. generally modelled on the [[British English|British]] standard). According to the movement's chairman, then Colonel(NS) David Wong,<ref>David Wong quoted in M.Nirmala, ''No Singlish please, We're Singaporeans'' - The Straits Times, 31 March 2000, p. 33</ref> the Speak Good English Movement aims to build a sense of pride that Singaporeans can speak good English, as opposed to Singlish, as well as to check the trend where Singaporeans use Singlish as a way of [[Prestige_(sociolinguistics)|identifying]] themselves. Instead, it envisions a brand of grammatically correct English, different from Singlish, to be linked with the unique Singaporean identity.

==Past themes==
Since 2003, the Speak Good English Movement has been launched annually with year-long programmes and activities held island-wide to increase the awareness among Singaporeans that speaking good English matters in their daily lives.<ref name="SGEwebsite" /> Each year a different theme focusing on the target audience is created. The themes that were used in the campaign thus far are:

===Speak Well, Be Understood. (2000-2004)===
====2000/01====
In 1999, then Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] highlighted the problem of speaking Singlish in his [[National Day Rally]]. A year later in April 2000, he officially launched the Speak Good English Movement with the tagline 'Speak Well, Be Understood'. He stressed the importance of speaking standard English and reducing the use of Singlish, as Singapore is a hub city and an open economy with a need to interact with English-speaking foreigners. Singaporeans often use Chinese syntax and literal translations of Chinese phrases while speaking English, which make utterances seem truncated and incomprehensible to foreigners. In his rally, the prime minister stressed that "if we speak a corrupted form of English that is not understood by others, we will lose a key competitive advantage." <ref>"Speak Good English Movement" launched in Singapore - Xinhua News Agency, 29 April 2000</ref> The movement was spearheaded by a committee of people in the private sector led by then Colonel (NS) David Wong, a senior adviser with the consulting company [[Ernst and Young]]. Its target audience was Singaporeans under 40, which included young working adults, parents and students in schools, tertiary institutes, polytechnics and technical institutes. The launch kick-started a week-long festival packed with events such as plays and a speech marathon.

Later in the year, the public sector also organised year-long programmes as part of the movement.<ref>Buck up, poor English reflects badly on us - PM.- The Straits Times, 30 April 2000, p. 4</ref> One such event was the seminar held by the Singapore Teachers Union (STU) at the Shangri-La Hotel, attended by about 500 participants who were mostly teachers. The seminar emphasised the power of pronunciation and the teaching of grammar, and encouraged teachers to teach English in more creative ways in schools using dramas and role-playing.<ref>Teach good English? Seminar will give tips. - The Straits Times, 26 May 2000</ref> Other highlights in 2000 included the launch of [http://asp.marketasia.com.sg/RELC/grammarindex.asp Grammar Matters], a series of 5 books using comics to illustrate the correct use of grammar by the Regional English Language Center in support of the movement.

====2001/02====
From 2001-2002, it was reported that increasingly, Singaporeans were becoming more aware and acknowledging the importance of speaking good English. The [[British Council]] continued to operate its toll-free line giving English lessons. Reportedly, year 2001 saw almost 250,000 callers while there were about 170,000 callers in 2002.  Also, an inter-school [[Scrabble]] competition, in which 54 primary schools participated, was held to kick off the year's events in April 2002.<ref>Singaporeans starting to value importance of speaking good English. - Channel News Asia, 12 April 2002</ref>

====2002/03====
According to the Government, more Singaporeans recognised the need to speak well, and took steps to improve their spoken English. Programmes organised by SGEM partners such as the [[People<U+2019>s Association]] and the [[British Council]] were well received.<ref>Official Speech for SGEM 2003/04 - Col (NS) David Wong, 2 Jul 2003</ref>

====2003/04====
In 2003, the movement, already in its fourth year, aimed to not only encourage Singaporeans to speak well but also speak simple English.  Chairman Wong said, "They may be afraid to use English, it's not natural to them. This year what we would like to do is encourage people to try. Have a go even if they can't speak well, even if they cannot use long words, even if they can't use long sentences, it's not important. The idea is to use simple words, simple sentences and convey their message clearly." <ref>Speak Good English Movement aims to get people to speak simple English.- Channel News Asia, 2 July 2003</ref> The movement continued throughout the year until March 2004 so as to create greater impact and awareness.

===Speak Up. Speak Out. Speak Well. (2005/06)===

Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] launched that year's Speak Good English Movement on May 13 at the HDB Hub Auditorium at Toa Payoh. Chairing the movement was Professor Koh Tai Ann, professor of English Literature at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at [[Nanyang Technological University]]. Professor Koh highlighted that speaking good English did not necessary mean that one should seek to eradicate or diminish the usage of [[Singlish]] or [[mother tongue]]. He recognised the importance of mother tongue and Singlish as a bonding element for Singaporeans, but emphasized that there was a right place and time for it and that Singaporeans must be able to converse in Standard English when the occasion called for it. The highlights of that year's movement included the appointment of 12 !cons, ambassadors for the SGEM 2005. They included taxi drivers, cyber gamers and media personalities.<ref>A dozen !cons appointed for Speak Good English Movement - TODAY,5 May 2005</ref>

[[File:Get It Right Poster -Singapore.jpg|thumb|alt=Get It Right Poster -Singapore alt text |A Get It Right Poster at a food-court displaying a correction of ungrammatical English.]]

In its 11th year, the Speak Good English Movement 2010 which was launched on 7 September 2010 with the tagline 'Get It Right'. This year's focus is on those who are less proficient in Standard English. It aimed at broadening the environment in which Standard English is used, in order to create a conducive environment where those less proficient in the code can learn by example. Fluent speakers of Standard English are encouraged to use it more frequently in all conversation, regardless if it is with family members, colleagues, hawkers, or taxi drivers.<ref name="mypaper">"Get your English right -even at the kopitiam" - My paper, 1 September  2010, p.4</ref><ref>"Getting it right from the start" - The Straits Times, 1 September 2010, p.B06</ref>

In a bid for Singaporeans to 'Get It Right'-where those proficient in Standard English take note to use the language accurately and those who are less proficient at it try to use it correctly; the organisers introduced  an Activist Toolkit.<ref>SGEM Official Media Release 2010, 31 August 2010</ref> The Activist Toolkit includes sticky notes, stickers and notebooks. People are encouraged to use the sticky notes to correct English errors that they encounter anywhere. For example, correcting a wrongly expressed sign by pasting a sticky note over it. This tactic is called 'guerrilla-styled' from [[guerrilla marketing]].<ref>[http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100908-0000073/Correct-sticky-notes-to-be-pasted-on-bad-signs|Correct Sticky Notes to be Pasted on Bad Signs] - TODAYonline, 8 September 2010.

*[http://english.stomp.com.sg/english English As It Is Broken]: The citizen-journalism and social networking site, [[STOMP]]  collaborated with SGEM to provide an English Language Panel which answers readers' questions regarding the English language in the local context on a daily basis. STOMP's continuing partnership with the movement has since produced two books focus on commonly asked questions and mistakes, as well as tips on how to improve the reader's command of the English language. STOMP also launched a free [[iPhone]] app, Say It Right, that allows users to listen to the correct pronunciation of words that are most commonly mispronounced by Singaporeans and to look up the definition of these words. The app uses a familiar Singaporean voice to pronounce the words in hopes of making it more appealing and useful to its target audience in spontaneous situations when they are unsure of the pronunciation of a certain word.<ref>Say it right with this iPhone app - My paper, 19 November 2010, p.A23</ref>

==Criticism==
Since the onset of the SGEM, reaction to the movement has been mixed, and its strongest opponents have included linguists and social commentators. In response, Liew Choon Boon, Director of the Arts & Heritage Development Division from the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts and Ho Peng,  Director of Curriculum Planning and Development from the Ministry of Education wrote in a letter published in The Straits Times on December 12, 2008:
<blockquote>While Singlish may be a fascinating academic topic for linguists to write papers about, Singapore has no interest in becoming a curious zoo specimen to be dissected and described by scholars.<ref>[http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20081212-107403.html "Good English the way to go"] - Straits Times, 12 December 2008. Retrieved 18 November 2010</ref></blockquote>

===Singlish as a marker of Singaporean identity===
The Speak Good English Movement is the government's effort to encourage Singaporeans to speak Standard English rather than the colloquial form, [[Singlish]].  This has been criticised by many Singaporeans as trying to eradicate Singlish. Arguing that Singlish is a distinctive marker of Singaporean identity, supporters of Singlish criticize SGEM. Their support for Singlish stems from the belief that Singlish can forge social cohesion and according to some, <U+201C>It may be the only thing that makes us Singaporean<ref name = "TalkingCock">[http://www.talkingcock.com/html/article.php?sid=787 "Thanks for making our Save Our Singlish Campaign such a success!] - Speech at the launch of Save our Singlish campaign, 28 April 2002. Retrieved 23 October 2010</ref>  Likewise, celebrity [[STOMP]] blogger, Leow Ju Len says in this blog post<ref>[http://starblog.stomp.com.sg/post.php?blogid=130 "Dun anyhow condemn Singlish, can"] - Leow Ju Len, STOMP Starblog. Retrieved 18 Novemeber 2010</ref>: <blockquote>I mean, our tourism slogan is 'Uniquely Singapore', and what could be more uniquely Singaporean than Singlish?". He also reasons that the beauty of Singlish is the fact that "It's also wonderfully time- and breath-saving. If you need to know the time, you say: "Now what time?". It gets the question across in three words. Where got time to say: "Do you know what time it is now?"</blockquote>

====Save Our Singlish Campaign====
On 27 April 2002, two years after the start of SGEM, [[TalkingCock]] launched the Save Our Singlish Campaign . They made it clear at the speech during the launch that they were not against the speaking of good English. Rather, they "completely support the writing and speaking of good English" and hoped that SGEM see the Save Our Singlish Campaign "as complementary, not adversarial." <ref name = "TalkingCock" /> TalkingCock found it important to save Singlish for it is a crucial part of the Singaporean culture and heritage<ref name = "TalkingCock" />:
<blockquote>Why we<U+2019>re fighting for Singlish, is because it<U+2019>s simply a part of our culture. In fact, it may be the ONLY thing that makes us uniquely Singaporean.It mixes all the various languages, which to me, seems to spread multi-cultural understanding. I thought this was something to be proud of.</blockquote>
Furthermore, they reiterated that "Singlish is not just broken English. It<U+2019>s a patois."<ref name = "TalkingCock" /> Their argument was that speaking good English should not be promoted at the expense of Singlish. Singapore Watch sumed it up with "Speak Singlish proudly, speak English properly."<ref>[http://singaporewatch.org/2005/04/30/speak-singlish-proudly-speak-english-properly "Speak Singlish Proudly, Speak English Properly"] - Singapore Watch, 30 April 2005. Retrieved 18 November 2010 </ref> [[Colin Goh]] who started [[TalkingCock]], pointed out that Singaporeans are able to tell the difference between English and Singlish:<ref name ="TalkingCock" /><blockquote>Have more faith in Singaporeans than that. We know when to use Singlish and when not to. ... We are intelligent enough to know we don<U+2019>t write formal letters in Singlish. When was the last time you typed out, "Eh, give me a job, leh!" And we try not to speak Singlish to our foreign friends because we instinctively know that they might not understand. Or as we say, they<U+2019>ll catch no ball.</blockquote>
He further acknowledged that there are times when improper English is spoken by Singaporeans but reiterated that the blame cannot be pushed to Singlish:
<blockquote>If Singaporeans' communication with Europeans or Americans is bad, that's because they speak broken English, not Singlish. We all know we can't speak Singlish to foreigners because they'll all catch no ball. That's just common sense. The fault isn't with too much Singlish, it's because English is taught so badly.</blockquote>

In a event held on 24 August 2006, ''TalkingCock in Parliament: We, the Citizens'', Ruby Pan who was a Ministry of Education scholar and graduated from [[Princeton University]] displayed the ability to switch easily from Standard English to Singlish and also to different English accents.<ref>[http://www.mrbrownshow.com/2006/08/30/the-mrbrown-show-video-talkingcock-in-parliament-ruby-pan/ "TalkingCock in Parliament" Video clip] - Ruby Pan, The mrbrown Show.

====Speak Good Singlish Movement====
The Speak Good Singlish Movement gathers support through a Facebook page which currently has 1700 members.<ref name="SGSM">[http://www.facebook.com/pages/Speak-Good-Singlish-Movement/152213451475413 "Speak Good Singlish Movement"] - Facebook page. Retrieved 18 November 2010</ref> It began as a response to the launch of SGEM 2010, in particular its notion of using post-its to correct public signs written in poor English. In response, the page ran its own post-it campaign, called the "Post-its Tak Bak Chew Campaign", which invites supporters to send in snapshots of their own home-made signs with proper Singlish.

The Facebook page was established on 11 September 2010 with the following statements:

<blockquote>We are not against the Speak Good English Movement in Singapore. But we believe that we should get it right with speaking English as well as Singlish. We are tired of people confusing Singlish with broken English. We are tired of people pretending to speak Singlish by speaking bad English. We are tired of people caricaturising Singlish speakers as uncouth and unintelligent. If you don't bother to learn the subtle rules of a natural evolving language, then please don't conclude that it is simple, shallow, and useless! Singlish is full of cultural nuances and wordplay, and it pulls together the best in the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary of many languages.<ref name="SGSM" /></blockquote>

In an exclusive interview with [http://www.theonlinecitizen.com The Online Citizen], one of the Singapore's key social commentary websites, its unnamed founder directly called into question Dr Balakrishnan's appeal about the SGEM <ref>[http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/09/<U+201C>please-stop-hum-tumming-singlish-just-leebit-alone<U+201D> <U+201C>Please stop hum-tumming Singlish!

===Hiring 'native' English speakers to teach===
Since gaining independence in 1965, English is taught as a first language and is also the most dominant language in Singapore. It is also used as the medium of instruction in all public schools. Not all Singaporeans can be considered as [[native speakers]] of English because the [[Languages in Singapore#Home Languages | main languages spoken at home]] are not necessarily English. In 2006, then Education Minister [[Tharman Shanmugaratnam]] mentioned during a dialogue session at a student education conference that his ministry was looking at hiring 'native speakers' to teach English Language in schools in order to improve the standard of teaching the English language in school.<ref>MOE considering whether to hire native speakers to teach English - The Straits Times, 10 June 2006. Retrieved 23 October 2010</ref> Following this, many Singaporeans wrote in to newspapers forums with questions such as "Why aren't our English teachers suitably qualified?" <ref>[http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/forum/2006/forum_letters/20060622.pdf Why aren't our English teachers suitably qualified?] Fok Kah Hon - Today Voices, 22 June 2010. Retrieved 23 October 2010</ref> and wondering if native English speakers meant foreign English speakers hailing from the United States or Britain.

On 14 June 2006, [[mrbrown]] reported in his blog that the Ministry of Education had already put up job advertisements in [[The Guardian]] for experienced, qualified native speakers of English to teach English as a first language, English Literature, Geography, History, Knowledge and Inquiry.<ref>[http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2006/06/moe_ad_seen_in_.html MOE ad seen in The Guardian newspaper] - mrbrown blog post, 14 June 2006. Retrieved 23 October 2010</ref>

Subsequently, [[mrbrown]] created two [[podcasts]] on [[the mrbrown show]] to express his views. The first gave insight to what will happen if the implementation of hiring foreign native English speakers to teach English became too successful.<ref>[http://www.mrbrownshow.com/2006/06/14/the-mrbrown-show-14-june-2006-smile-and-speak-good-english/ "Smile and speak good english"] - The mrbrown Show, 14 June 2006. Retrieved 223 October 2010</ref> The second tells of how he thinks the interviews with the native speakers applicants for the teaching job are like.<ref>[http://www.mrbrownshow.com/2006/06/19/the-mrbrown-show-19-june-2006-the-native-speaker-interviews "The native speaker interviews"] - The mrbrown Show, 19 June 2006. Retrieved 23 October 2010 </ref>

In response, Jennifer Chan, Press Secretary to Minister for Education, wrote in a forum letter reply dated June 22, 2006 that:
<blockquote>The criteria for the selection of foreign teachers will remain stringent. Besides academic and teaching qualifications, they should also have a proven track record in teaching in their countries. The individuals may be native speakers or persons who have learnt EL well as a first language</blockquote>
The hiring of "a small number" of foreign teachers was to complement the local teachers in subjects like English, the Mother Tongue Languages and the Humanities. This was part of the plan to bring the standard of English Languages in schools to a higher level.<ref>[http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/forum/2006/20060622.htm All primary school English teachers are trained; criteria for selecting foreign teachers are stringent] Chan, Jennifer. Ministry of Education, Forum Letter Replies, 22 June 2006. Retrieved 23 October 2010</ref>

===The "interference" Argument===
Similar to [[linguistic interference]], the "interference" argument justifies the need to eliminate Singlish since it is thought to cause the confusion and contamination of Standard English. It suggests that the inability to distinguish between the grammars of Singlish and Standard English would cause a learner of English to be confused between the two varieties, thus mixing their features and contaminating the grammar of Standard English.<ref>'Burdens' and 'handicaps' in Singapore's language policy: on the limits of language management - Wee, Lionel, ''Language Policy'', 2010 </ref>

However, many Singaporeans felt that Singlish is unlikely to cause a problem to their level of Standard English. In a 2008 study, about 41% of the Singaporean participants felt that they already have a good command of English.<ref>Speak good English? 4 in 10 Singaporeans say "no need lah" - Wong, Tessa. SG Forum, 28 August 2008</ref> Another study by Wee(2005) have shown that in general, Singaporeans are confident in their [[code-switching]] abilities between Singlish and Standard English, thus undermining the claims that using Singlish interferes with the learning of Standard English.<ref>Intra-language discrimination and linguistic human rights: The case of Singlish - Wee, Lionel.
