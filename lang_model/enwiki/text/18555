Adolf Hitler was born at the Gasthof zum Pommer, an inn in [[Braunau am Inn]], [[Austria-Hungary]], on 20 April 1889,<ref>{{harvnb|Shirer|1961|p=21}}</ref> the fourth child of six.<ref>{{harvnb|Bullock|1962|p=23}}</ref> His father, [[Alois Hitler]] (1837<U+2013>1903), was a customs official. His mother, [[Klara Hitler|Klara P<U+00F6>lzl]] (1860<U+2013>1907), was Alois's third wife. She was also his [[cousin]],<ref>Since the identity of Alois' biological father is an unsolved mystery of Third Reich history, it is consequently impossible to determine the true biological relationship between Alois and Klara. ''See'' discussion in [[Alois Hitler]] article. If, as the official records (as modified when Alois was 39 years old) show, [[Johann Georg Hiedler]] was Alois's biological father, then Alois and Klara were first cousins, once removed; if [[Johann Nepomuk Hiedler]] (the younger brother of Johann Georg) was his biological father, then Alois was Klara's half-uncle. In either case Alois and Klara were within the proscribed degrees of [[consanguinity]].</ref> so a [[papal dispensation]] was obtained for the marriage. Of Alois and Klara's six children, only Adolf and his sister [[Paula Hitler|Paula]], seven years his junior, reached adulthood.<ref name="bull25">{{harvnb|Bullock|1962|p=25}}</ref> Hitler's father also had a son, [[Alois Hitler, Jr.|Alois, Jr.]], and a daughter, [[Angela Hitler|Angela]], by his second wife.<ref name="bull25"/>

Hitler had a troubled childhood, as his father was violent to him and violent towards his mother. Hitler himself said that, as a boy, he was often beaten by his father. Years later, he told his secretary: "I then resolved never again to cry when my father whipped me. A few days later I had the opportunity of putting my [[will (philosophy)|will]] to the test. My mother, frightened, took refuge in front of the door. As for me, I counted silently the blows of the stick which lashed my rear end".<ref>{{harvnb|Toland|1991|pp=12<U+2013>13}}</ref> Some historians believe a history of family violence committed by his father against his mother is indicated in a section of his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in which Hitler describes in vivid detail an anonymous example of family violence committed by a husband against a wife. This along with beatings by his father against him could explain Hitler's deep emotional attachment to his mother while at the same time having deep resentment towards his father.

Hitler's family moved often, from Braunau am Inn to [[Passau]], [[Lambach]], [[Leonding]], and [[Linz]]. The young Hitler was a good student in elementary school. But in the sixth grade, his first year of high school (''Realschule'') in Linz he failed and had to repeat the grade. His teachers said that he had "no desire to work". For one school year he was a student there at the same time as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], considered one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century.<ref>Lackey, Douglas. 1999. "What Are the Modern Classics? The Baruch Poll of Great Philosophy in the Twentieth Century" ''Philosophical Forum''. 30 (4): 329-46</ref>  Although both boys were exactly the same age, Hitler was placed two school years below Wittgenstein.<ref>Hamann, Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship, p.15</ref> It is a matter of controversy whether Hitler and Wittgenstein even knew of each other, and if so whether either had any memory of the other.<ref>The controversial book ''[[The Jew of Linz]]'' by [[Kimberley Cornish]] suggests that conflict between Hitler and Wittgenstein was a critical moment in Hitler's formation as an anti-Semite, although there is no evidence for any such conflict. {{harvnb|Cornish|1999}}</ref>

Hitler later said that his educational slump was a rebellion against his father, who wanted the boy to follow him in a career as a customs official; he wanted to become a painter instead. This explanation is further supported by Hitler's later description of himself as a misunderstood artist. After Alois died on 3 January 1903, Hitler's schoolwork did not improve. At age 16, Hitler dropped out of high school without a diploma.

In ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler attributed his conversion to German nationalism to a time during his early teenage years when he read a book of his father's about the [[Franco-Prussian War]], which caused him to question why his father and other German Austrians failed to fight for the Germans during the war.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-22|url=http://www.mondopolitico.com/library/meinkampf/v1c1.htm|title= ''In the House of my Parents''|publisher=Mondo Politico}}</ref>

====Heritage====
{{Refimprovesect|date=August 2008}}

Hitler's father, [[Alois Hitler]], was an [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] child. For the first 39 years of his life he bore his mother's surname, Schicklgruber. In 1876, he took the surname of his stepfather, [[Johann Georg Hiedler]]. The name was spelled ''Hiedler'', ''Huetler'', ''Huettler'' and ''Hitler'', and was probably regularized to ''Hitler'' by a clerk. The origin of the name is either "one who lives in a hut" ([[German language|Standard German]] ''H<U+00FC>tte''), "shepherd" (Standard German ''h<U+00FC>ten'' "to guard", [[English language|English]] ''heed''), or is from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word ''Hidlar'' and ''Hidlarcek''. (Regarding the first two theories: some German [[dialect]]s make little or no distinction between the ''<U+00FC>''-sound and the ''i''-sound.)

Allied [[propaganda]] exploited Hitler's original family name during World War II. Pamphlets bearing the phrase "Heil Schicklgruber" were [[airdrop]]ped over German cities. He was legally born a Hitler, however, and was also related to Hiedler via his maternal grandmother, [[Johanna Hiedler]].

The name "Adolf" comes from [[Old High German]] for "noble wolf" (Adel=nobility + wolf). Hence, one of Hitler's self-given nicknames was ''Wolf'' or ''Herr Wolf''; he began using this nickname in the early 1920s and was addressed by it only by intimates (as "Uncle Wolf" by the Wagners) up until the fall of the Third Reich.<ref>{{harvnb|Langer, Walter C.|1972|p=246}}</ref> The names of his various headquarters scattered throughout [[continental Europe]] (''[[Wolfsschanze]]'' in [[East Prussia]], ''Wolfsschlucht'' in [[France]], ''Werwolf'' in [[Ukraine]], etc.) reflect this. By his closest family and relatives, Hitler was known as "Adi".

[[Alois Hitler#Hitler.27s biological father|Hitler's paternal grandfather]] was most likely one of the brothers Johann Georg Hiedler or [[Johann Nepomuk Hiedler]]. There were rumors that Hitler was one-quarter Jewish and that his grandmother, [[Maria Schicklgruber]], became [[pregnant]] while working as a servant in a Jewish household. The implications of these rumors were politically explosive for the proponent of a [[racism|racist]] and [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] ideology. Opponents tried to prove that Hitler had Jewish or [[Czech people|Czech]] ancestors. Although these rumors were never confirmed, for Hitler they were reason enough to conceal his origins. According to Robert G. L. Waite in ''[[The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler]]'', Hitler made it illegal for German women to work in Jewish households, and after the "[[Anschluss]]" (annexation) of [[Austria]], Hitler turned his father's hometown into an artillery practice area. Waite says that Hitler's insecurities in this regard may have been more important than whether Judaic ancestry could have been proven by his peers.

===Early adulthood in Vienna and Munich===
From 1905 on, Hitler lived a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life in [[Vienna]] on an orphan's pension and support from his mother. He was rejected twice by the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]] (1907<U+2013>1908), citing "unfitness for painting", and was told his abilities lay instead in the field of [[architecture]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bullock|1962|pp=30<U+2013>31}}</ref> His [[memoirs]] reflect a fascination with the subject:

<blockquote>The purpose of my trip was to study the picture gallery in the Court Museum, but I had eyes for scarcely anything but the Museum itself. From morning until late at night, I ran from one object of interest to another, but it was always the buildings which held my primary interest.<ref name = "Kampf-vol1ch2">{{harvnb|Hitler|1998|loc=<U+00A7>2}}</ref></blockquote>

Following the school rector's recommendation, he too became convinced this was his path to pursue, yet he lacked the proper academic preparation for architecture school:

<blockquote>In a few days I myself knew that I should some day become an architect. To be sure, it was an incredibly hard road; for the studies I had neglected out of spite at the Realschule were sorely needed. One could not attend the Academy's architectural school without having attended the building school at the Technic, and the latter required a high-school degree. I had none of all this. The fulfillment of my artistic dream seemed physically impossible.<ref name = "Kampf-vol1ch2"/></blockquote>

On 21 December 1907, Hitler's mother died of [[breast cancer]] at age 47. Ordered by a court in Linz, Hitler gave his share of the [[orphan]]s' benefits to his sister Paula. When he was 21, he inherited money from an aunt. He struggled as a painter in Vienna, copying scenes from postcards and selling his paintings to merchants and tourists. After being rejected a second time by the Academy of Arts, Hitler ran out of money. In 1909, he lived in a shelter for the homeless. By 1910, he had settled into a [[Meldemannstra<U+00DF>e dormitory|house for poor working men on Meldemannstra<U+00DF>e]].

Hitler said he first became an anti-Semite in Vienna,<ref name = "Kampf-vol1ch2"/> which had a large Jewish community, including [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] who had fled the [[pogrom]]s in [[Russia]]. But according to a childhood friend, [[August Kubizek]], Hitler was a "confirmed anti-Semite" before he left Linz, Austria.<ref name = "Kampf-vol1ch2"/> Vienna at that time was a hotbed of traditional religious prejudice and 19th century racism. Hitler may have been influenced by the writings of the ideologist and anti-Semite [[Lanz von Liebenfels]] and [[polemic]]s from politicians such as [[Karl Lueger]], founder of the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] and [[List of mayors of Vienna|Mayor of Vienna]], the composer [[Richard Wagner]], and [[Georg Ritter von Sch<U+00F6>nerer]], leader of the [[pan-Germanism|pan-Germanic]] ''Away from Rome!'' movement. Hitler claims in ''Mein Kampf'' that his transition from opposing antisemitism on religious grounds to supporting it on racial grounds came from having seen an Orthodox Jew:

{{bquote|There were very few Jews in Linz. In the course of centuries the Jews who lived there had become [[Europeanisation|Europeanised]] in external appearance and were so much like other human beings that I even looked upon them as Germans. The reason why I did not then perceive the absurdity of such an illusion was that the only external mark which I recognized as distinguishing them from us was the practice of their strange religion. As I thought that they were persecuted on account of their faith my aversion to hearing remarks against them grew almost into a feeling of abhorrence. I did not in the least suspect that there could be such a thing as a systematic antisemitism.

Once, when passing through the inner City, I suddenly encountered a phenomenon in a long caftan and wearing black side-locks. My first thought was: Is this a Jew? They certainly did not have this appearance in Linz. I carefully watched the man stealthily and cautiously but the longer I gazed at the strange countenance and examined it feature by feature, the more the question shaped itself in my brain: Is this a German?<ref name = "Kampf-vol1ch2"/>}}

If this account is true, Hitler apparently did not act on his new belief. He often was a guest for dinner in a noble Jewish house, and he interacted well with Jewish merchants who tried to sell his paintings.<ref>{{harvnb|Hamann|1999}}</ref>

Hitler may also have been influenced by [[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[On the Jews and their Lies]]''. In ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler refers to Martin Luther as a great warrior, a true statesman, and a great reformer, alongside [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Frederick the Great]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hitler|1998|loc=<U+00A7>7}}</ref> [[Wilhelm R<U+00F6>pke]], writing after the Holocaust, concluded that "without any question, [[Lutheranism]] influenced the political, spiritual and social history of Germany in a way that, after careful consideration of everything, can be described only as fateful."<ref>{{harvnb|R<U+00F6>pke1946|p=117}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Waite|1993|p=251}}</ref>

Hitler claimed that Jews were enemies of the [[Aryan race]]. He held them responsible for Austria's crisis. He also identified certain forms of [[Socialism]] and [[Bolshevism]], which had many Jewish leaders, as Jewish movements, merging his antisemitism with anti-[[Marxism]]. Later, blaming Germany's military defeat in [[World War I]] on the [[German Revolution of 1918<U+2013>19|1918 revolutions]], he considered Jews the culprits of Imperial Germany's downfall and subsequent economic problems as well.

Generalising from tumultuous scenes in the parliament of the multi-national Austrian monarchy, he decided that the democratic [[parliamentary system]] was unworkable. However, according to August Kubizek, his one-time roommate, he was more interested in Wagner's operas than in his politics.

Hitler received the final part of his father's estate in May 1913 and moved to [[Munich]]. He wrote in ''Mein Kampf'' that he had always longed to live in a "real" German city. In Munich, he became more interested in architecture and, he says, the writings of [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]]. Moving to Munich also helped him escape [[Conscription|military service]] in Austria for a time, but the Munich police (acting in cooperation with the Austrian authorities) eventually arrested him. After a physical exam and a contrite plea, he was deemed unfit for service and allowed to return to Munich. However, when Germany entered World War I in August 1914, he petitioned King [[Ludwig III of Bavaria]] for permission to serve in a [[Bavaria]]n regiment. This request was granted, and Adolf Hitler enlisted in the Bavarian army.<ref>{{harvnb|Shirer|1961}}</ref>

===World War I===
Hitler served in France and [[Belgium]] in the 16th Bavarian Reserve Regiment (called ''Regiment List'' after its first commander), ending the war as a [[Gefreiter]] (equivalent at the time to a [[lance corporal]] in the British and [[private first class]] in the American armies). He was a runner, one of the most dangerous jobs on the Western Front, and was often exposed to enemy fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Bullock|1962|pp=50<U+2013>51}}</ref> He participated in a number of major battles on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], including the [[First Battle of Ypres]], the [[Battle of the Somme]], the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] and the [[Battle of Passchendaele]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=53}}</ref> The Battle of Ypres (October 1914), which became known in Germany as the ''Kindermord bei Ypern'' (Massacre of the Innocents) saw approximately 40,000 men (between a third and a half) of the nine infantry divisions present killed in twenty days, and Hitler's own company of 250 reduced to 42 by December. Biographer [[John Keegan]] has said that this experience drove Hitler to become aloof and withdrawn for the remaining years of war.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1987|p=239}}</ref>

Hitler was twice decorated for bravery. He received the [[Iron Cross]], Second Class, in 1914 and Iron Cross, First Class, in 1918, an honour rarely given to a Gefreiter.<ref>{{harvnb|Bullock|1962|p=52}}</ref> However, because the regimental staff thought Hitler lacked leadership skills, he was never promoted to [[Unteroffizier]] (equivalent to a British corporal). Other historians say that the reason he was not promoted is that he was not a German citizen. His duties at regimental headquarters, while often dangerous, gave Hitler time to pursue his artwork. He drew cartoons and instructional drawings for an army newspaper. In 1916, he was wounded in either the groin area<ref>Alastair Jamieson, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3481932/Nazi-leader-Hitler-really-did-have-only-one-ball.html ''Nazi leader Hitler really did have only one ball.html''], [[The Daily Telegraph]], retrieved on 20 November 2008</ref> or the left thigh<ref>Rosenbaum, Ron, "[http://www.slate.com/id/2205359/ Everything You Need To Know About Hitler's "Missing" Testicle]", ''Slate'', Nov. 28, 2008</ref> during the Battle of the Somme, but returned to the front in March 1917. He received the [[Wound Badge]] later that year. [[Sebastian Haffner]], referring to Hitler's experience at the front, suggests he did have at least some understanding of the military.

On 15 October 1918, Hitler was admitted to a [[field hospital]], temporarily blinded by a [[mustard gas]] attack. The English psychologist [[David Lewis (psychologist)|David Lewis]] and Bernhard Horstmann suggest the blindness may have been the result of a [[conversion disorder]] (then known as [[hysteria]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|2003}}</ref> Hitler said it was during this experience that he became convinced the purpose of his life was to "save Germany." Some scholars, notably [[Lucy Dawidowicz]],<ref>{{harvnb|Dawidowicz|1986}}</ref> argue that an intention to exterminate Europe's Jews was fully formed in Hitler's mind at this time, though he probably had not thought through how it could be done. Most historians think the decision was made in 1941, and some think it came as late as 1942.

Two passages in ''Mein Kampf'' mention the use of [[poison gas]]:

{{blockquote|At the beginning of the Great War, or even during the War, if twelve or fifteen thousand of these Jews who were corrupting the nation had been forced to submit to poison-gas . . . then the millions of sacrifices made at the front would not have been in vain.<ref>{{harvnb|Hitler|1998|loc=<U+00A7>15}}</ref>}}

{{blockquote|These tactics are based on an accurate estimation of human weakness and must lead to success, with almost mathematical certainty, unless the other side also learns how to fight poison gas with poison gas. The weaker natures must be told that here it is a case of to be or not to be.<ref name = "Kampf-vol1ch2"/>}}

Hitler had long admired Germany, and during the war he had become a passionate German patriot, although he did not become a German citizen until 1932. Hitler found the war to be 'the greatest of all experiences' and afterwards he was praised by a number of his commanding officers for his bravery.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1987|p=238<U+2013>240}}</ref> He was shocked by Germany's [[capitulation]] in November 1918 even while the German army still held enemy territory.<ref>{{harvnb|Bullock|1962|p=60}}</ref> Like many other German nationalists, Hitler believed in the ''[[Dolchsto<U+00DF>legende]]'' ("dagger-stab legend") which claimed that the army, "undefeated in the field," had been "stabbed in the back" by civilian leaders and Marxists back on the [[home front]]. These politicians were later dubbed the ''[[November Criminals]]''.

The [[Treaty of Versailles]] deprived Germany of various territories, [[demilitarization|demilitarised]] the [[Rhineland]] and imposed other economically damaging sanctions. The treaty re-created Poland, which even moderate Germans regarded as an outrage. The treaty also blamed Germany for all the horrors of the war, something which major historians like [[John Keegan]] now consider at least in part to be [[victor's justice]]: most European nations in the run-up to World War I had become increasingly [[militarisation|militarised]] and were eager to fight. The culpability of Germany was used as a basis to impose [[reparation]]s on Germany (the amount was repeatedly revised under the [[Dawes Plan]], the [[Young Plan]], and the [[Hoover Moratorium]]). Germany in turn perceived the treaty and especially, Article 231 the paragraph on the German responsibility for the war as a humiliation. For example, there was a nearly total demilitarisation of the armed forces, allowing Germany only six battleships, no submarines, no air force, an army of 100,000 without conscription and no armoured vehicles. The treaty was an important factor in both the social and political conditions encountered by Hitler and his Nazis as they sought power. Hitler and his party used the signing of the treaty by the "November Criminals" as a reason to build up Germany so that it could never happen again. He also used the "November Criminals" as scapegoats, although at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris peace conference]], these politicians had had very little choice in the matter.
