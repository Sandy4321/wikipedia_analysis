{{The Holocaust}}
The '''W<U+0105>sosz pogrom''' was the mass murder of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish residents]] of [[W<U+0105>sosz, Podlaskie Voivodeship|W<U+0105>sosz]] in [[Nazi]] German [[Occupation of Poland (1939<U+2013>1945)|occupied Poland]] that took place on July 5, 1941, during [[World War II]].

== Circumstances surrounding the pogrom ==
When [[Nazi Germany]] invaded [[Poland]] in 1939, the village of [[W<U+0105>sosz, Podlaskie Voivodeship|W<U+0105>sosz]] ([[Podlaskie Voivodeship]]) was taken by the Germans in the second week of the war.<ref name="Pinkas"/> At the end of September, in accordance with the [[German<U+2013>Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty|German<U+2013>Soviet Boundary Treaty]], the area was transferred by the Nazis to the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name="Pinkas"/>

The Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded Poland from the East]] two weeks earlier, on September 17, 1939, pursuant to the secret protocol of the [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact]]. The [[Red Army]] overran 52.1% of territory of Poland with over 13,700,000 inhabitants. The Soviet occupation zone included 5,1 million ethnic Poles (ca. 38%), 37% Ukrainians, 14,5% Belarusians, 8,4% Jews, 0,9% Russians and 0,6% Germans. There were also 336,000 refugees who escaped to [[Kresy|eastern Poland]] from areas already occupied by Germany <U+2013> most of them Polish Jews numbering at around 198,000.<ref name="Trela-Mazur">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =El<U+017C>bieta Trela-Mazur | coauthors = | title =Sowietyzacja o<U+015B>wiaty w Ma<U+0142>opolsce Wschodniej pod radzieck<U+0105> okupacj<U+0105> 1939-1941 (Sovietization of education in eastern Lesser Poland during the Soviet occupation 1939-1941) | year =1997 | editor =W<U+0142>odzimierz Bonusiak, Stanis<U+0142>aw Jan Ciesielski, Zygmunt Ma<U+0144>kowski, Miko<U+0142>aj Iwanow | pages =294 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Wy<U+017C>sza Szko<U+0142>a Pedagogiczna im.

==The only existing document==
The only account of what might have happened during the pogrom belongs to a document written by 22-year-old Menachem Finkielsztejn who had lived in the region with his parents [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|under Polish protection]] during [[The Holocaust in Poland|the Holocaust]], before his subsequent emigration to Israel with his family and siblings.

In the second week of the German occupation, a Polish militia was formed on the order of German gendarmerie. It consisted of "local thugs", wrote Finkielsztejn. On July 5, 1941, this unit surrounded W<U+0105>sosz to prevent Jews from escaping, and a house to house pogrom began.<ref name="WZKH" /><ref name="MF" /> The actual description of the pogrom remains unverified to this day and, as noted by Polish and American scholars, it might have been rewritten by Jewish custodians of the original document.<ref name="glaukopis">Prof. [[Marek Jan Chodakiewicz]], [http://www.glaukopis.pl/pdf/czytelnia/ResearchBeforeConclusion.pdf "RESEARCH BEFORE CONCLUSION: THE PROBLEMS OF SHOCK THERAPY..."] ''Collection 301'', page 5; ''Glaukopis socio-historical Journal'', 2007, ISSN: 1730-3419</ref> 

As Finkielsztejn writes <U+2013> on July 6, 1941, the Jews who escaped from W<U+0105>sosz, arrived in the neighboring town of [[Radzi<U+0142><U+00F3>w]], but the next day pogrom broke out there as well. According to his deposition 1,500 local and refugee Jews were burned there in a barn.<ref name="MF">Translation from Polish translation: [http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/grajewo/gra228.html  "Reported by Menachem Finkelsztajn / Born in Radzilow, age 22 / Extermination of Jews in the Districts of Grajewo and Lomza in July, 1941."] The District Jewish Historical Committee Bialystok, June 14, 1946 No. 5/46. ''Publisher makes no representations regarding the accuracy of the translation.''</ref> However, there's also an early Polish monument on the outskirts of Radzi<U+0142><U+00F3>w which reads, "In August 1941 fascists murdered 800 persons of Jewish descent [undated], 500 of them were burned alive in a barn." The date on the monument is incorrect but historical research confirms that Jews were killed in Radzi<U+0142><U+00F3>w on July 7, how many, and under what circumstances, remains unknown. The pages from Finkielsztejn's paper describing the actual pogrom vanished from the Jewish Historical Institute of Warsaw in the following years.<ref name=A-K>Andrzej Kaczynski, [http://www.radzilow.com/rzeczpospolita.htm Thou Shall Not Kill] Rzeczpospolita, no. 159, July 10, 2000: "Nie zabijaj"</ref> According to the remaining page, the Germans found later, that allegedly only fifteen Jews were left alive in W<U+0105>sosz.<ref name="Pinkas"/> The Jews stayed in the town until June 1942 under the supervision of German gendarmerie who "behaved properly" (whatever it means); and were used by the Nazis for [[forced labor]] purposes. Finkielsztejn insisted that all criminals were Polish, even those who had Russian names, or were driving German tanks, while armed to their teeth by the Gestapo. His paper ends there. In November 1942 the survivors were moved to the [[Bogusze, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Bogusze]] transit camp and in January 1943 sent to [[Majdanek]] or [[Treblinka]] [[extermination camp]]s.<ref name="Pinkas"/>

According to Alexander B. Rossino, historian at the [[Washington Holocaust museum]], the atrocities committed in Radzi<U+0142><U+00F3>w near W<U+0105>sosz were likely perpetrated by the [[Gestapo]] paramilitary ''[[Einsatzkommando#Einsatzgruppe B|Einsatzgruppe Zichenau-Schroettersburg]]'' under SS-Obersturmf<U+00FC>hrer [[Hermann Schaper]]. The methods used by his death squad in Radzi<U+0142><U+00F3>w were identical to those employed in Jedwabne only three days later <U+2013> as shown by the evidence collected in [[West Germany]] between 1964-1976.<ref name="A-R">Alexander B.
