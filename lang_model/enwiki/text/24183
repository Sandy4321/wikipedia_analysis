'''Core Animation''' is a data visualization [[application programming interface|API]] used by [[Mac OS X v10.5]] and [[iPhone OS]] to produce animated user interfaces.<ref name="apptech">{{cite web | title=Apple - Developer - Leopard Technology Series for Developers - Leopard Developer Application Technologies Overview | url=http://developer.apple.com/leopard/overview/apptech.html | accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref>

==Overview==

'''Core Animation''' provides a way for developers to produce animated user interfaces via an ''[[implicit animation]]'' model as well as an "explicit" model.  The developer specifies the original and final states of an object, and Core Animation handles [[interpolation]].  This allows animated interfaces to be created with relative ease, as no specific code for the animation is required by the developer.<ref>{{cite web | title=Apple - Mac OS X Leopard - Technology - Core Animation | url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/technology/coreanimation.html | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref>

Core Animation can animate any visual element, and it provides a unified way of accessing [[Core Image]], [[Core Video]], and the other [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz technologies]]. Like the rest of the graphics model, Core Animation can be accelerated by a graphics processor (GPU).<ref name="apptech" />

Animated sequences execute in a thread independent from the main run loop, allowing application processing to occur while the animation is in progress.  In this way, application performance is not affected, and animations can be stopped, reversed, or ''retargeted'' while in progress.  <ref name="apptech" />

Updating an existing Cocoa application to use Core Animation should be a simple process. The standard GUI widgets and windows used by the application need be initially registered into a Core Animation setup function. Beyond that, core animation code can be largely segregated from standard GUI logic.

==History==
Core Animation first appeared in [[Mac OS X v10.5]], but actually first emerged from the [[iPhone]] software team.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} It was shown publicly for the first time on [[August 7]], [[2006]] during [[Worldwide Developers Conference| WWDC 2006]].
At the [[Macworld Expo]] 2007, Apple announced that the iPhone runs a specially adapted version of [[Mac OS X]] and uses Core Animation.
