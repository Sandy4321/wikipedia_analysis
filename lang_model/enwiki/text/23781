}}
'''St Mary Magdalene's Church''' is a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] place of worship in [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], a town and seaside resort which is part of the [[Hastings|Borough of Hastings]] in [[East Sussex]], England.  Built in 1852 for Anglican worshippers in the growing new town of St Leonards-on-Sea, a seaside resort which had been laid out from the 1820s, the church's prominent position on the skyline overlooking the town was enhanced in 1872 by the addition of a tower.  No longer required by the Anglican community in the 1980s, it was quickly bought by the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and converted into a place of worship in accordance with their requirements.  The alterations were minimal, though, and the building retains many of its original fittings and its "archaeologically correct Gothic" exterior which reflected architectural norms of the early [[Victorian era]].<ref name="NHLE-1043430">{{NHLE|num=1043430|desc=Church of St Mary Magdalene, St Margaret's Road, St Leonard's, Hastings, East Sussex|grade=II|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref>  [[English Heritage]] has [[Listed building|listed]] the church at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance.

==History==
By the 12th century, Hastings on the [[English Channel]] coast was one of Sussex's largest and most important towns.  The famous [[Battle of Hastings|Battle]] of 1066 took place nearby; a [[Hastings Castle|castle]] was founded; the town operated its own mint; it was the leader of the [[Cinque Ports]]; and seven churches existed within its boundaries.<ref name="EllerayIntro">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1979|loc=Introduction.}}</ref><ref name="VCH-ix-8">{{Harvnb|Salzman (ed.)|1973|p=8.}}</ref><ref name="Pevsner518">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=518.}}</ref><ref name="VCH-ix-4">{{Harvnb|Salzman (ed.)|1973|p=4.}}</ref>  The surrounding [[Manorialism|manors]] included Gensing, a large and attractive expanse of land running down from a forested valley on to flat agricultural land and a beach immediately west of the town.<ref name="JMB11">{{Harvnb|Manwaring Baines|1990|p=11.}}</ref>  As Hastings recovered from an 18th-century slump and started to become fashionable and well patronised again in the early 19th century,<ref name="JMB10">{{Harvnb|Manwaring Baines|1990|p=10.}}</ref> speculative development was encouraged.<ref name="JMB11">{{Harvnb|Manwaring Baines|1990|p=11.}}</ref>

[[James Burton (1761<U+2013>1837)|James Burton]], a builder and entrepreneur who later fathered the prominent architect [[Decimus Burton]], saw the potential of the Gensing estate land, which was owned by the [[Eversfield baronets]] of Denne Park near [[Horsham]], West Sussex.<ref name="JMB11"/>  He bought a large section of this manor, including {{convert|1151|yd|m}} of seafront land, for <U+00A3>7,800 in February 1828, and developed a carefully planned new town, St Leonards-on-Sea, on it.<ref name="JMB11"/>  Residential, commercial and hotel development was rapid, especially after it was incorporated as a town by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1832 (previously it had been run as a private enterprise by Burton),<ref name="JMB28">{{Harvnb|Manwaring Baines|1990|p=28.}}</ref> and the resort soon rivalled neighbouring Hastings in popularity.<ref name="JMB42">{{Harvnb|Manwaring Baines|1990|p=42.}}</ref>

Burton provided the town with its first [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church, [[St Leonard's Church, St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonard's Church]], in 1831.  The 800-capacity seafront building was consecrated in 1834.<ref name="JMB53<U+2013>54">{{Harvnb|Manwaring Baines|1990|pp=53<U+2013>54.}}</ref>  After Burton's death in 1837, the town continued to grow in all directions, helped by the opening of [[St Leonards Warrior Square railway station]] in 1851.<ref name="Body107">{{Harvnb|Body|1984|p=107.}}</ref>  This was close to the square of that name, an early Victorian-era set piece (started in the early 1850s), which helped to push St Leonards-on-Sea's boundaries closer to those of Hastings.<ref name="Pevsner529">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=529.}}</ref>

St Leonard's Church, the [[parish church]], was in the western part of the resort, on the seafront road called Marina.<ref name="Pevsner529">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=529.}}</ref>  This was the only Anglican place of worship in the town, and in 1848 a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] place of worship was established<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/> near Warrior Square when Augustus Pugin's Convent of the Holy Child Jesus opened its chapel for public worship;<ref name="PoW27">{{Harvnb|Elleray|2004|p=27.}}</ref> so in June 1850 a group of promoters contacted the Incorporated Church Building Society and applied for money to build a new church to serve the eastern part of St Leonards-on-Sea.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/>

[[File:St Mary Magdalene's Church (Greek Orthodox), St Leonards (from East).JPG|thumb|left|The church was built on a high, sloping site.]]
The land Burton bought straddled two parish boundaries: St Leonard's and St Mary Magdalene's.<ref name="JMB11"/>  St Leonard's was named in reference to one of Hastings' ancient parish churches which apparently vanished by the early 15th century.<ref name="JMB11"/>  It belonged to an abbey in [[Rouen]] in France before that.<ref name="VCH-ix-27">{{Harvnb|Salzman (ed.)|1973|p=27.}}</ref>  St Mary Magdalene's parish, to the east, was first described in 1656, but there was no ancient church of that dedication in the area; instead there was a medieval [[Hospital#Medieval Europe|Hospital]] of St Mary Magdalene, from which the name may have come.<ref name="VCH-ix-27"/>  The new church then took the name of this ancient parish.<ref name="VCH-ix-27"/>

Charles Eversfield of the [[Eversfield baronets]] gave the site for the church<U+2014>a high, landmark site overlooking Warrior Square.  Funding came from the [[Bishop of Chichester]], the vicar of St Leonard's parish church and others.  A building committee was assembled to administer the design and construction process.  Sir [[Thomas Smith Marrable]] was a member, and his son [[Frederick Marrable|Frederick]] was commissioned to design the church.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/>  Work on the [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic]]-style building started in 1852, and the church opened in that year.<ref name="PoW28">{{Harvnb|Elleray|2004|p=28.}}</ref>  It had a capacity of 822 worshippers, split approximately equally between free and paid-for pews.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/>  The ecclesiastical parish was officially reconstituted in 1870.<ref name="VCH-ix-27"/>  The building cost <U+00A3>12,000<U+2014>expensive for the time.<ref name="SPC-22034">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sussexparishchurches.org/content/view/220/34/|title=Hastings <U+2013> St Mary Magdalene, St Margaret's Road|last=Allen|first=John|date=28 March 2012|work=Sussex Parish Churches website|publisher=Sussex Parish Churches (www.sussexparishchurches.org)|accessdate=29 March 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FUDdNOkJ|archivedate=29 March 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The plans provided for a tower and a large spire.  The latter was never added, but in 1872 a tower was built at the southwest corner.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/><ref name="PoW28"/><ref name="SPC-22034"/>  Other work carried out in this year included the addition of an organ chamber (in the form of an [[apse]]) and a [[vestry]], and a new east window in the [[chancel]].<ref name="SPC-22034"/>  [[Stained glass]] windows by [[Morris & Co.]] were added in 1882.  A church hall, a simple brick structure, was built on the northwest side in 1935.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/>

The [[Diocese of Chichester]] declared the church [[Redundant church|redundant]] in 1980.<ref name="SPC-22034"/>  Soon afterwards, it was bought by the local Greek Orthodox community; various sources give 1981,<ref name="SPC-22034"/> 1982<ref name="PoW28"/> or 1983<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/> for the year.  They installed an [[iconostasis]] in 1983 as the central feature of the church.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/>

==Architecture==
[[File:St Mary Magdalene's Church (Greek Orthodox), St Leonards (from Southeast).JPG|thumb|right|The nave has a [[clerestory]] and five-bay aisles.]]
St Mary Magdalene's Church is an expensively designed, "archaeologically correct" Decorated Gothic Revival church whose design was exactly in accordance with architectural norms of the mid-19th century.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/><ref name="PoW28"/>  As a "large and imposing" building on a prominent, high corner site (a feature typical of the churches of St Leonards-on-Sea and Hastings),<ref name="VCS113">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1981|loc=<U+00A7>113.}}</ref> it makes a "handsome composition" within the townscape.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/><ref name="SPC-22034"/>  Another characteristic feature, similar to other local churches, is the extensive use of locally quarried stone.<ref name="VCS113"/>  The interior and exterior walls are of [[sandstone]] laid in [[ashlar]] blocks.<ref name="SPC-22034"/><ref name="VCH-ix-26">{{Harvnb|Salzman (ed.)|1973|p=26.}}</ref>  The Decorated Gothic Revival design matches the typical style of a 14th-century church.<ref name="PoW28"/><ref name="VCH-ix-26"/><ref name="Pevsner521">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=521.}}</ref>

The plan consists of a [[Clerestory|clerestoried]] [[nave]] with aisles on the north and south sides, a [[chancel]] at a lower level, a [[buttress]]ed four-stage tower with a beacon-style turret,<ref name="VCS113"/><ref name="Pevsner521"/> a porch and a vestry on the north side.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/>  The aisles have five [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] each and are separated from the nave by arcades.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/>  The tower rises from the westernmost bay of the south aisle<ref name="VCH-ix-26"/> and has paired [[lancet window]]s on each face of its top (bell) stage.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/>  The chancel has a [[hammerbeam roof]] in a [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Gothic]] style.<ref name="SPC-22034"/><ref name="VCH-ix-26"/>

Writing in 1965, [[Ian Nairn]] and [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] stated that the interior was "not specially interesting",<ref name="Pevsner521"/> but several original features remain.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/>  [[Stained glass]] of the 19th century<U+2014>some of which was destroyed in bomb attacks in 1943<U+2014>included examples by Marrable himself, [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]], William Miller, [[Clayton and Bell]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]]<ref name="SPC-22034"/> and the Morris & Co. window in the south aisle.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/>  A three-seat [[sedilia]] and adjacent [[piscina]], both with [[ogee]]-shaped heads, remain in the south wall, and there is a [[reredos]] with a carving of the [[Last Supper]].<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/>  An ogee-panelled porch and an octagonal [[Baptismal font|font]] with carvings also survive.<ref name="NHLE-1043430"/>
