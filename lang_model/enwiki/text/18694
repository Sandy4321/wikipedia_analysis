'''''Station to Station''''' is the tenth [[studio album]] by English musician [[David Bowie]], released by record label [[RCA Records|RCA]] in 1976. Commonly regarded as one of his most significant works, ''Station to Station'' is also notable as the vehicle for Bowie's last great 'character', [[The Thin White Duke]]. The album was recorded after he completed shooting [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', and the cover featured a still from the movie. During the sessions Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially [[cocaine]], and recalls almost nothing of the production. 

Musically, ''Station to Station'' was a transitional album for Bowie, developing the [[Funk music|funk]] and [[soul music]] of his previous release, ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]'', while presenting a new direction towards [[synthesizers]] and [[motorik]] rhythms that was influenced by German [[electronic music|electronic]] bands such as [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Neu!]]. This trend would culminate in some of his most acclaimed work, the so-called [[Berlin Trilogy]], recorded with [[Brian Eno]] in 1977<U+2013>79. Bowie himself has said that ''Station to Station'' was "a plea to come back to Europe for me".<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/> The album<U+2019>s lyrics, meanwhile, reflected his preoccupations with [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[mythology]] and [[religion]].

With its blend of funk and [[Krautrock]], romantic balladry and [[occultism]], ''Station to Station'' has been described as "simultaneously one of Bowie's most accessible albums and his most impenetrable".<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/> Featuring the single "[[Golden Years]]", it made the Top 5 in both the UK and US charts. {{RS500|323}}

==Background==
According to biographer David Buckley, the [[Los Angeles]]-based Bowie, fuelled by an "astronomic" [[cocaine]] habit and subsisting on a diet of [[Capsicum|peppers]] and milk, spent much of 1975<U+2013>76 "in a state of psychic terror".<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 259, 264.</ref> Stories <U+2013> mostly from one interview, pieces of which found their way into ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' <U+2013> circulated of the singer living in a house full of ancient-Egyptian artefacts, burning black candles, seeing bodies fall past his window, having his [[semen]] stolen by witches, receiving secret messages from [[The Rolling Stones]], and living in morbid fear of fellow [[Aleister Crowley]] aficionado [[Jimmy Page]].<ref name="The Complete David Bowie">Pegg (2004): pp. 297<U+2013>300.</ref> Bowie would later say of L.A., "The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the earth".<ref name="NME">{{cite journal |last=McKinnon |first=Angus |title=The Future Isn't What It Used to Be |journal=[[NME]] |date=13 September 1980 |pages=pp. 32<U+2013>35}}</ref>

It was on the set of his first major film, ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', that Bowie began writing a pseudo-autobiography called ''The Return of the Thin White Duke''.<ref name="MOJO 60 Years of Bowie">{{cite journal |last=Paytress |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=So Far Away... |journal=Mojo Classic |issue=60 Years of Bowie |pages=p. 55}}</ref> He was also composing music on the understanding that he was to provide the picture's soundtrack, though this would not come to fruition. Director [[Nicolas Roeg]] warned the star that the part of Thomas Jerome Newton would likely remain with him for some time after production completed. With Roeg's agreement, Bowie developed his own look for the film, and this carried through to his public image and onto two album covers over the next twelve months, as did Newton's air of fragility and aloofness.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 260<U+2013>263.</ref>

[[The Thin White Duke]] became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, as often as not during the next six months, for Bowie himself. Impeccably dressed in white shirt, black trousers and waistcoat, The Duke was a hollow man who sang songs of romance with an agonised intensity while feeling nothing, "ice masquerading as fire".<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record">Carr & Murray (1981): pp. 78<U+2013>80.</ref> The persona has been described as "a mad aristocrat",<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/> "an amoral zombie",<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 258.</ref> and "an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman".<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/> For Bowie himself, The Duke was "a nasty character indeed".<ref>Wilcken (2005): p. 24.</ref>

==Production==
''Station to Station'' was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. In 1981, ''[[NME]]'' editors [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] surmised that it was cut <U+2013> "in 10 days of feverish activity" <U+2013> when Bowie decided that there was no hope of his producing a soundtrack for ''The Man Who Fell to Earth''.<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/> More recent authorship contends that the album was recorded over a couple of months, in October<U+2013>November 1975,<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/> and was in the can before Bowie began his abortive sessions on the soundtrack.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 277<U+2013>279.</ref><ref>Wilcken (2005): p. 16.</ref>

At various times to be titled ''The Return of The Thin White Duke'',<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 263.</ref> or ''Golden Years'',<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/> ''Station to Station'' was co-produced by Harry Maslin, Bowie's associate for "[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]" and "[[Across the Universe]]" on ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]''. [[Tony Visconti]], who after a three-year absence had recently returned to the Bowie fold mixing ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' and co-producing ''[[David Live]]'' and ''Young Americans'', was not involved due to competing schedules.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 269<U+2013>270.</ref> However, the recording did cement the band line-up that would see Bowie through the rest of the decade, with bassist [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]] joining ''Young Americans'' drummer [[Dennis Davis]] and rhythm guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]].<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/>

The recording process developed with this team set the pattern for Bowie's albums up to and including ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)]]'' in 1980: backing tracks laid down by Murray, Davis and Alomar; sax, keyboard and lead guitar overdubs (here by Bowie, [[Roy Bittan]] and [[Earl Slick]], respectively); lead vocals; and finally various production tricks to complete the song.<ref name="Buckley p.270">Buckley (2000): p. 270.</ref> According to Bowie, "I got some quite extraordinary things out of Earl Slick. I think it captured his imagination to make ''noises'' on guitar, and textures, rather than playing the right notes."<ref name="Sound + Vision">{{cite album-notes |title=Sound + Vision |albumlink=Sound + Vision (box set) |bandname=David Bowie |year=1990 |first=Kurt |last=Loder |authorlink=Kurt Loder |coauthors=David Bowie |format=box set booklet |publisher=[[Rykodisc]]}}</ref> Alomar recalled, "It was one of the most glorious albums that I've ever done ... We experimented so much on it".<ref name="Buckley p.270"/> Harry Maslin added, "I loved those sessions because we were totally open and experimental in our approach".<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/>

Bowie himself remembers almost nothing of the album's production, not even the studio, later admitting, "I know it was in LA because I've read it was".<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/> The singer was not alone in his use of cocaine during the sessions, Carlos Alomar commenting, "if there's a line of coke which is going to keep you awake till 8 a.m. so that you can do your guitar part, you do the line of coke ... the coke use is driven by the inspiration." Like Bowie, Earl Slick had somewhat vague memories of the recording: "That album's a little fuzzy <U+2013> for the obvious reasons! We were in the studio and it was nuts <U+2013> a lot of hours, a lot of late nights."<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 271<U+2013>272.</ref>

==Style and themes==
''Station to Station'' is often cited as a transitional album in Bowie's career. [[Nicholas Pegg]], author of ''The Complete David Bowie'', called it a "precise halfway point on the journey from ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]'' to ''[[Low (album)|Low]]''",<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/> while for [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], it "effectively divides the '70's for David Bowie. It ties off the era of [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]] and plastic soul, and introduces the first taste of the new music that was to follow with 'Low'."<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/>

In terms of Bowie's own output, ''Station to Station'''s Euro-centric flavour had its musical antecedents in tracks like "[[Aladdin Sane (song)|Aladdin Sane 1913-1938-197?]]" and "[[Time (David Bowie song)|Time]]" (1973), while its [[funk]]/[[disco]] elements were a development of the [[Soul music|soul]]/[[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] sound of ''Young Americans'' (1975). More recently Bowie had begun to soak up the influence of German [[motorik]] and [[electronic music]] by bands like [[Neu!]], [[Can (band)|Can]] and [[Kraftwerk]]. Thematically the album revisited concepts dealt with in songs such as "[[The Supermen]]" from ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]'' (1970) and "[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]" from ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971): [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] '[[<U+00DC>bermensch|Overman']], the [[occult]]ism of [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Nazism|Nazi]] fascination with [[Holy Grail|Grail]] mythology, and the [[Kabbalah]].<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/><ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/> Pegg considered the album's theme to be a clash of "occultism and Christianity".<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/>

The musical style of "[[Golden Years (song)|Golden Years]]", the first track recorded for the album, built on the funk and soul of ''Young Americans'' but with a harsher, grinding edge. It has been described as carrying with it "an air of regret for missed opportunities and past pleasures".<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/> Bowie said that it was written for <U+2013> and rejected by <U+2013> [[Elvis Presley]], while Bowie's wife at the time [[Angela Bowie|Angie]] claimed it was penned for her.<ref name="Buckley p.272<U+2013>273">Buckley (2000): pp. 272<U+2013>273.</ref> Though a Top 10 single on both sides of the Atlantic, it was rarely performed live on the subsequent ''Station to Station'' tour.<ref name="The Complete David Bowie pp.82<U+2013>83">Pegg (2004): pp. 82<U+2013>83.</ref> "[[Stay (David Bowie song)|Stay]]" was another riff-driven funk piece, "recorded very much in our cocaine frenzy", according to Alomar.<ref name="Buckley p.272<U+2013>273"/> Its lyrics have been variously interpreted as reflecting on "the uncertainty of sexual conquest",<ref name="Buckley p.272<U+2013>273"/> and as an example of "the Duke's spurious romanticism".<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/>

The Christian element of the album was most obvious in the hymn-like "Word on a Wing", though for some commentators religion, like love, was simply another way for the Duke to "test his numbness".<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/> Bowie himself has claimed that in this song, at least, "the passion is genuine".<ref name="NME"/> When performing it live in 1999, the singer described it as coming from "the darkest days of my life ... I'm sure that it was a call for help".<ref name="The Complete David Bowie pp.240<U+2013>243">Pegg (2004): pp. 240<U+2013>243.</ref> The closing ballad, "[[Wild Is the Wind (song)|Wild Is the Wind]]", was the album's sole cover, and has been praised as one of the finest vocal performances of Bowie's career.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 274<U+2013>275.</ref> Bowie was inspired to record the song after he met singer/pianist/songwriter [[Nina Simone]], who sang it on the soundtrack album ''[[Wild Is the Wind (album)|Wild Is the Wind]]'' (1966).<ref name="The Complete David Bowie pp.240<U+2013>243"/>

The spectre of ''The Man Who Fell to Earth'''s Thomas Jerome Newton sprawled in front of dozens of television monitors is said to have partly inspired the album's most upbeat track, "[[TVC15]]".<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 274.</ref> Supposedly also about [[Iggy Pop]]'s girlfriend being eaten by a TV set,<ref>Pegg (2004): p. 223.</ref> it has been called "incongruously jolly" and "the most oblique tribute to [[The Yardbirds]] imaginable".<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/>

The title track has been described as heralding "a new era of experimentalism" for Bowie.<ref name="Buckley p.275<U+2013>277">Buckley (2000): pp. 275<U+2013>277.</ref> "[[Station to Station (song)|Station to Station]]" was in two parts: a slow, portentous piano-driven march, introduced by the sound of an approaching train juxtaposed with Earl Slick's agitated guitar [[feedback]], followed by an up-tempo rock/blues section. In 1999 Bowie told ''[[Uncut (magazine)|UNCUT]]'' magazine, "Since Station To Station the hybridization of R&B and electronics had been a goal of mine".<ref name="Uncut">{{cite web |url=http://www.davidbowie.com/news/dbberlin.html |title=Uncut Interviews David Bowie on Berlin |accessdaymonth=2 November |accessyear=2008 |year=1999 |publisher=David Bowie official website}}</ref> Despite the noise of a train in the opening moments, Bowie claims that the title refers not so much to railway stations as to the [[Stations of the Cross]], while the line "From [[Keter|Kether]] to [[Malkuth]]" relates to mystical places in the [[Kabbalah]], mixing Christian and Jewish allusions.<ref name="The Complete David Bowie pp.205<U+2013>206">Pegg (2004): pp. 205<U+2013>206.</ref> Fixation with the occult was further evident in such phrases as "[[White Stains|white stains]]", the name of a book of poetry by Aleister Crowley.<ref>Wilcken (2005): p. 7.</ref> The lyrics also gave notice of Bowie's recent drug use ("It's not the side effects of the cocaine / I'm thinking that it must be love").<ref>Wilcken (2005): p. 9.</ref> With its [[Krautrock]] influence, it was the album's clearest foretaste of Bowie's subsequent '[[Berlin Trilogy]]'.<ref name="Buckley p.275<U+2013>277"/><ref name="The Complete David Bowie pp.205<U+2013>206"/>

Speaking to ''[[Creem]]'' magazine in 1977, Bowie proclaimed that ''Station to Station'' was "devoid of spirit ... Even the love songs are detached, but I think it's fascinating."<ref name="Buckley p.275<U+2013>277"/>

==Singles and unreleased tracks==
Every song on ''Station to Station'', with the exception of the title track, eventually appeared on a [[Single (music)|single]]. "Golden Years" was released in November 1975, two months before the album. Bowie allegedly got drunk to perform it on TV for the American show ''[[Soul Train]]'',<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 75.</ref> resulting in the film clip seen on [[music video]] programmes.<ref name="The Complete David Bowie pp.82<U+2013>83"/> It made number 8 in the UK and number 10 in the US (where it charted for 16 weeks) but, like "[[Rebel Rebel]]"'s relationship to ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1974), was a somewhat unrepresentative teaser for the album to come.<ref name="The Complete David Bowie pp.82<U+2013>83"/>

"TVC15" was released in edited form as the second single in May 1976, making number 33 in the UK and number 64 stateside. "Stay", also shortened and appearing the same month, was issued as a companion 45 to RCA's ''[[ChangesOneBowie]]'' greatest hits collection, though it did not appear on the compilation (''ChangesOneBowie'' was itself packaged as a uniform edition to ''Station to Station'', featuring a black-and-white cover and similar lettering).<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 84.</ref> In November 1981, as Bowie's relationship with RCA was winding down, "Wild Is the Wind" was issued as a single to push the ''[[ChangesTwoBowie]]'' compilation. Backed with "Word on a Wing" and accompanied by a video shot especially for the release, it made number 24 in the UK and charted for 10 weeks.<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 625.</ref>

Another song purportedly recorded during the album sessions at Cherokee Studios, a cover of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City",<ref name="Sound + Vision"/> went unreleased at the time but was issued in 1990 on the ''[[Sound and Vision (compilation)|Sound and Vision]]'' box set. According to Nicholas Pegg, however, the Cherokee work most likely consisted of overdubs to a track originally cut at [[Sigma Sound Studios]] during ''Young Americans''.<ref>Pegg (2004): pp. 107<U+2013>108.</ref>

==Release and reception==
The album was released in January 1976. The sleeve was originally to have featured a full-colour still from ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]''. However Bowie rejected the colour cover, claiming the sky looked artificial ("Since when has that ever stopped him from doing anything?", asked ''NME'''s Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray later).<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/> The album was duly released with the same picture cropped in [[black-and-white]]; it was not until [[Rykodisc]] reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s that the colour version was restored.

''[[Billboard]]'' considered that Bowie had "found his musical niche" following songs like "[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]" and "Golden Years" but that "the 10-minute title cut drags". ''[[NME]]'' called it "one of the most significant albums released in the last five years". Both found the meaning of the lyrics difficult to fathom.<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' applauded the album's 'rockier' moments but discerned a move away from the genre, finding it "the thoughtfully professional effort of a style-conscious artist whose ability to write and perform demanding rock & roll exists comfortably alongside his fascination for diverse forms ... while there's little doubt about his skill, one wonders how long he'll continue wrestling with rock at all."<ref name="RS review">{{cite journal |last=Moris |first=Teri |title=Station to Station |journal=[[Rolling Stone]]. |date=25 March 1976 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/davidbowie/albums/album/318243/review/18750542/station_to_station |accessyear=2008 |accessdaymonth=2 November}}</ref>

''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'', noting that Bowie was "never one to maintain continuity in his work or in his life", declared that ''Station to Station'' "offers cryptic, expressionistic glimpses that let us feel the contours and palpitations of the masquer's soul but never fully reveal his face." The review also found various allusions to earlier Bowie efforts, such as the "density" of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', the "pop feel" of ''[[Hunky Dory]]'', the "dissonance and angst" of ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'', the "compelling percussion" of ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]'', and the "youthful mysticism" of "[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]", concluding that "it shows Bowie pulling out on the most challenging leg of his winding journey".<ref name="Circus review">{{cite journal |last=Cromelin |first=Richard |title=The Return Of The Thin White Duke |journal=[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]. |date=March 1976 |url=http://mywebsite.bigpond.com/roger.griffin/GoldenYears/7603Circus.html |accessyear=2008 |accessdaymonth=2 November}}</ref>

''Station to Station'' was, and remains, Bowie's highest-charting album in the US, reaching number 3 and remaining for 32 weeks.<ref name="Buckley pp.623<U+2013>624">Buckley (2000): pp. 623<U+2013>624.</ref> It was [[Music recording sales certification|certified gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on 26 February 1976.<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=station%20to%20station&perPage=25 |title=RIAA Gold and Platinum Search for "Station to Station" |accessdaymonth=2 November |accessyear=2008 |publisher=[[RIAA]]}}</ref> In the UK, it charted for 17 weeks, peaking at number 5, the last time one of his studio albums placed lower in his home country than in America.<ref name="Buckley pp.623<U+2013>624"/>

==Aftermath==
With the ''Station to Station'' sessions completed in December 1975, Bowie started work on a soundtrack for ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'' with [[Paul Buckmaster]] as his collaborator.<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/> Bowie expected to be wholly responsible for the film's music but found that "when I<U+2019>d finished five or six pieces, I was then told that if I would care to submit my music along with some other people's... and I just said "Shit, you're not getting any of it". I was so furious, I<U+2019>d put ''so'' much work into it."<ref name="NME"/> However Harry Maslin contended that Bowie was "burned out" and couldn't complete the work in any case. The singer eventually collapsed, admitting later, "There were pieces of me laying all over the floor".<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/> In the event, only one instrumental composed for the soundtrack saw the light of day, evolving into "[[Subterraneans]]" on his next studio album, ''Low''.<ref name="NME"/>

After abandoning the soundtrack album, Bowie went [[Isolar - 1976 Tour|on tour in support of ''Station to Station'']], commencing 2 February 1976 and completing on 18 May 1976.<ref name="The Complete David Bowie"/> [[Kraftwerk]]'s "[[Radioactivity (song)|Radioactivity]]" was employed as an overture to the shows, accompanying footage from [[Luis Bu<U+00F1>uel]]'s and [[Salvador Dali]]'s [[Surrealism|surrealist]] film "[[Un chien andalou|Un Chien Andalou]]".<ref name="Strange Fascination pp.281<U+2013>286">Buckley (2000): pp. 281<U+2013>286.</ref> The staging featured Bowie, dressed in The Duke's habitual black waistcoat and trousers, a pack of [[Gitanes]] placed ostentatiously in his pocket, moving stiffly among "curtains of white light",<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/> an effect that spawned the nickname 'the White Light Tour'.<ref name="Strange Fascination pp.281<U+2013>286"/> In 1989 Bowie reflected, "I wanted to go back to a kind of [[German Expressionism|Expressionist German-film]] look ... and the lighting of, say, [[Fritz Lang]] or [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst|Pabst]]. A black-and-white movies look, but with an intensity that was sort of aggressive. I think for me, personally, theatrically, that was the most successful tour I<U+2019>ve ever done."<ref name="Sound + Vision"/> The ''Station to Station'' tour was the source of one of the artist's best-known [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]], culled from an [[FM broadcasting|FM radio broadcast]] of his 23 March 1976 concert at [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum|Nassau Coliseum]].<ref name="Strange Fascination pp.281<U+2013>286"/>

Bowie drew criticism during the tour for his alleged pro-[[Fascism|fascist]] views. In a 1974 interview he had declared, "[[Adolf Hitler]] was one of the first rock stars ... quite as good as [[Mick Jagger|Jagger]] ... He staged a country",<ref name="Buckley pp.289<U+2013>291">Buckley (2000): pp. 289<U+2013>291.</ref> but managed to avoid condemnation. On the ''Station to Station'' tour, however, a series of incidents attracted publicity, starting in April 1976 with his detention by [[customs]] in [[Eastern Europe]] for possession of [[Nazism|Nazi]] memorabilia. The same month he was quoted in [[Stockholm]] as saying that "Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader".<ref name="Buckley pp.289<U+2013>291"/> Bowie would blame his addictions and the persona of The Thin White Duke for his lapses in judgment.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 11.</ref> The controversy culminated on 2 May 1976, shortly before the tour completed, in the so-called '[[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] incident' in [[London]], when Bowie arrived in an open-top [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] [[convertible]] and apparently gave a Nazi salute to the crowd that was captured on film and published in ''[[NME]]''. Bowie claimed that the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave,<ref name="MOJO 60 Years of Bowie 2">{{cite journal |last=Paytress |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=The Controversial Homecoming |journal=Mojo Classic |issue=60 Years of Bowie |pages=p. 64}}</ref> a contention backed by a young [[Gary Numan]] who was among the throng that day: "Think about it. If a photographer takes a whole motor-driven film of someone doing a wave, you will get a Nazi salute at the end of each arm-sweep. All you need is some dickhead at a music paper or whatever to make an issue out it&nbsp;..."<ref name="Buckley pp.289<U+2013>291"/> The stigma remained, however, to the extent that the lines "To be insulted by these fascists/It's so degrading" from ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters]]''' opening track "[[It's No Game]]", four years later, were taken as an attempt to bury the incident once and for all.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 112.</ref>

==Legacy==
''Station to Station'' was a milestone in Bowie's transition to his late-1970s '[[Berlin Trilogy]]'. Bowie himself has said of the album, "As far as the music goes, ''Low'' and its siblings were a direct follow-on from the title track",<ref name="The Complete David Bowie pp.205<U+2013>206"/> while [[Brian Eno]] opined that ''Low'' was "very much a continuation from ''Station to Station''".<ref name="Low">Wilcken (2005): p. 4.</ref> It has also been described as "enormously influential on [[post-punk]]".<ref name="Allmusic">{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:jsrj287c052a |title=''Station to Station'' Review |accessdaymonth=2 November |accessyear=2008 |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] wrote in 1981, "If ''Low'' was [[Gary Numan]]'s Bowie's album, then ''Station to Station'' was [[Magazine (band)|Magazine's]]."<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record"/> However, ''[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]]'' declared in 2004 that "just as few had anticipated Bowie<U+2019>s approach, few copied it ... for the most part this is an orphaned, abandoned style".<ref name="Stylus">{{cite web |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/david-bowie-station-to-station.htm |title=On Second Thought: David Bowie&nbsp;<U+2013> Station to Station |author=Mathers, Ian |date=13 April 2004 |accessyear=2008 |accessdaymonth=2 November |work=[[Stylus Magazine]]}}</ref> 

In 1999, music biographer David Buckley described ''Station to Station'' as a "masterpiece of invention" that "some critics would argue, perhaps unfashionably, is his finest record".<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 263, 269.</ref> The same year, Eno called it "one of the great records of all time".<ref name="Low"/> {{RS500|323}}<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/4|title=The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|accessyear=2008|accessdaymonth=1 November|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref>  A year later, ''[[The Observer]]'' ranked the album number 80 on its list of the 100 greatest British albums.<ref name="Observer">{{cite news |first=Luke |last=Bainbridge |title=The Top 100 Greatest British Albums: 80 Station to Station David Bowie |work=Observer Music Monthly |publisher=Guardian Media Group |location=London |page=49 |date=20 June 2004}}</ref>
