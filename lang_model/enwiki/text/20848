'''Dorothee Pesch''' (born 3 June 1964, [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]], [[Germany]]), popularly known as '''Doro Pesch''' or '''Doro''', is a German [[hard rock]] vocalist and songwriter, formerly front-woman of the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Warlock (band)|Warlock]]. The name Doro has also been associated with the touring band accompanying the singer, whose members have continuously changed in more than twenty years of uninterrupted activity, the most stable presences guaranteed by bassist [[Nick Douglas]] and drummer [[Johnny Dee (musician)|Johnny Dee]].

Doro started her career in garage bands in native [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]] underground scene and achieved media visibility and some commercial success with Warlock in the 1980s. Warlock were starting to have an opening in the US market, when they went through many line-up changes and Pesch was left the only original member of the band. She started a solo career under the name Doro, in order to avoid legal battles between her record label [[PolyGram]] and her former manager. She released two albums in the US with producers Joey Balin and [[Gene Simmons]], but they were not the breakthrough that she hoped.

During the rise of [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock]] in the 1990s, her record label relegated her productions only to the European region, where she continued to tour extensively. She remained a successful charting artist in Germany, despite living and producing her albums in the US. When classic heavy metal found again the favour of the public, she returned to tour all over the world and her popularity as a veteran singer grew considerably, inspiring many new female metal artists. Doro is also known for her duets performed both live and in studio with other singers and musicians of the metal scene, whom she has befriended in her long career.

To this date, she released sixteen studio albums, the latest being ''[[Raise Your Fist]]'' in 2012. Doro continues her recording career and is a much requested touring artist all over the world. When not on tour, she resides in [[New York City]].

What should have been the fifth Warlock release became ''[[Force Majeure (Doro album)|Force Majeure]]'', the first Doro album,  published in February 1989. It was recorded in the US by Joey Balin, and is the natural successor of ''Triumph and Agony'', continuing the band's drift towards radio-friendly [[pop metal]] in contrast with the European [[power metal]] of Warlock<U+2019>s earlier works.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/force-majeure-r6229/review | title = Doro Force Majeure review | accessdate = 2011-06-24 | last = Henderson | first = Alex | work = [[Allmusic]] | publisher = [[Rovi Corporation]]}}</ref> The album sold quite well in Europe,<ref name="GER" >{{cite web|url=http://www.charts.de/suche.asp?search=doro&x=4&y=6&country=de|title=Suche Nach "Doro"|work=Charts.de|publisher=Media Control|language=German|accessdate=November&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2010}}</ref><ref name="SWI">{{cite web|url= http://swisscharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Doro |title=Discography Doro |work=swisscharts.com|accessdate=November&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2010}}</ref> but it had limited success in the US, lurking at the bottom of the Billboard 200 chart.<ref>{{cite web|url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=doro-p4120/charts-awards/billboard-albums|pure_url=yes}}|title=Doro > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums | work=[[Allmusic]] | publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=November&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2010}}</ref>

Following the tour to promote ''Force Majeure'', the final Warlock line-up disbanded and Doro concentrated on her solo career. She decided to keep her Swiss manager Alex Grob, but renounced to be part of a band with whom to share songwriting duties and career decisions.<ref name="pavel" /><ref name="bio" /><ref name="evilg" >{{cite web | url = http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/doro.htm | title = Interview with Doro Pesch | accessdate = 2012-08-24 | first = EvilG | date = September 2000 | publisher = [[Metal Rules]]}}</ref> She contacted [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] bassist and childhood idol [[Gene Simmons]],<ref name="eyez" /><ref name="rules2" >{{cite web | url = http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/doropesch-2002.htm | title = Interview with Doro Pesch | accessdate = 2012-09-04 | last = Syrj<U+00E4>l<U+00E4> | first = Marko | date = October 2002 | publisher = [[Metal Rules]]}}</ref> who was taking a second career as [[Artists and repertoire|talent scout]] and [[record producer]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-simmons-mn0000200968 | title = Gene Simmons Biography | accessdate = 2012-08-26 | last = Prato | first = Greg | work = [[Allmusic]] | publisher = [[Rovi Corporation]]}}</ref> Simmons was willing to start a collaboration and produced the album ''[[Doro (album)|Doro]]'', with the help of [[Black 'n Blue]] guitarist [[Tommy Thayer]] and Pat Regan.<ref name="rules2" /> ''Doro'' was recorded in California with large use of writers and session musicians from the KISS entourage.

===Doro in Europe (1991-1999)===
The German singer experimented a new direction for her music in 1991, when she recorded the album ''[[True at Heart]]'' in [[country music]] haven [[Nashville, Tennessee]], with local musicians and mainstream producer [[Barry Beckett]]. [[Dann Huff]] of the melodic hard rock band [[Giant (band)|Giant]] contributed his lead guitar work to the album. New band members Michael Tyrrell on guitar,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://michaeltyrrell.com/michael.php | title = Michael | accessdate = 2012-07-21 | publisher = Michael Tyrrell official website}}</ref> Jeff Bruno on guitar and keyboards, and Tony Mac on drums were recruited for the following European tour.<ref name="AIIZ" />

Despite living in in the US and losing visibility in the English-spoken media, Doro remained very popular in Germany,<ref name="allmusic" /> where her albums always charted<ref name="GER" /> and where in 1991 she sang on a [[charity song]] by the "German Rock Project" called "Let Love Conquer the World".<ref name="bio" />

Returning in the US after the European tour, Doro was put in contact with [[Jack Ponti]], a mainstream songwriter and producer from New Jersey, to work on her next two albums. Ponti at the time was the producer of some minor glam metal acts and the [[A&R]] manager of [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]] and [[Nelson (band)|Nelson]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=248&Itemid=52 | title = 20 Questions with Jack Ponti | accessdate = 2011-02-19 | date = 21 June 2005 | publisher = [[Metal Sludge]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/jackponti.html | title = Interview with Jack Ponti | accessdate = 2011-02-19 | date = November 1997 | publisher = MelodicRock.com}}</ref> The album ''[[Angels Never Die]]'', released in 1993, was produced and largely written and performed by Ponti himself and Vic Pepe with the help of various session musicians.<ref>{{cite album-notes |title=Angels Never Die |albumlink= Angels Never Die |artist=Doro |year= 1993 | publisher=[[Vertigo Records]] (514 309-1)  |publisherid= |location=Cologne, Germany}}</ref> It contains a mix of melodic hard rock songs and power ballads,<ref name="bio" /> typical of the commercial pop metal albums of the period.

==Duets==
{{For|a list of duets| Doro Pesch discography#Duets }}
Doro Pesch is well known in the metal scene for her many duets with both expert singers and new artists.

Warlock were starting to make a solid reputation in the US, when the taste of the audience for classic metal acts shifted in favor of grunge, leaving the singer's mission to conquer the American market incomplete.<ref name="megametal" /> On the contrary, in her home country fans and press remained always loyal and favorable to Doro, who received in her career five nominations for the German [[Echo (music award)|Echo]] music award, which she won in 1994 as Best National Female Artist.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.echopop.de/no_cache/pop-suche/ | title = Echo Deutscher Musikpreis Archiv: Suche - search for Doro | accessdate = 2012-08-22 | publisher = [[Echo (music award)|ECHO]] | language = German}}</ref>
