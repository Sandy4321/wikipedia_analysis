'''Adam Pardy''' (born March 29, 1984 in [[Bonavista, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bonavista]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]] for the [[Calgary Flames]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).  He was a sixth round selection of the Flames, 173rd overall, at the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]] and has played for the organization since turning pro in 2005. He is an alumnus of the [[Cape Breton Screaming Eagles]] of the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL) where he played junior hockey.  Pardy was an [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) all-star in [[2007<U+2013>08 AHL season|2007<U+2013>08]] and made his NHL debut in [[2008<U+2013>09 NHL season|2008<U+2013>09]] after stints with the [[Omaha Ak-Sar-Ben Knights]], [[Las Vegas Wranglers]] and [[Quad City Flames]] in the minor leagues.

==Playing career==
Pardy was selected by the [[Halifax Mooseheads]] of the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL) in 2002, but was unable to earn a spot on Halifax's deep roster.  As a result, he began the 2002<U+2013>03 season in the [[Maritime Junior A Hockey League]] playing first for the [[Yarmouth Mariners]] and then the [[Antigonish Bulldogs]].<ref name="McKeens">{{cite web |last=McCluskey |first=Chris |url=http://mckeenshockey.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=348656 |title=Pardy on, Adam |publisher=McKeen's Hockey Prospects |date=2004-10-29 |accessdate=2010-01-08}}</ref> His QMJHL rights were traded to the [[Cape Breton Screaming Eagles]] in January 2003, though the Bulldogs refused to release him at first.<ref name="McKeens" /> After he was finally given his release to play with the Screaming Eagles, he finished the season playing seven regular season games in the Quebec League along with two more in the playoffs.<ref name="LOH" />

He then played two full seasons with the Screaming Eagles between 2003 and 2005. Pardy played 68 games for Cape Breton in [[2003<U+2013>04 QMJHL season|2003<U+2013>04]], scoring four goals and 12 points, adding 137 [[penalties in minutes]]. He improved to 12 goals, 27 assists and 163 penalty minutes in [[2004<U+2013>05 QMJHL season|2004<U+2013>05]] as an overage player.<ref name="LOH" />  He was a sixth round selection, 173rd overall, of the [[Calgary Flames]] and the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]].<ref name="NFLDWest">{{cite web |last=Sportak |first=Randy |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Calgary/2005/09/09/1209156-sun.html |title=Flames are Newfoundland west |work=Calgary Sun |date=2005-09-09 |accessdate=2010-01-07}}</ref> His selection at the age of 20 was unusual, as it came two years after most players are drafted, and was his third time through the draft after being passed over in 2002 and 2003.<ref name="McKeens" /> Pardy played a total of 144 games for the Screaming Eagles, scoring 16 goals, 40 assists and 302 penalty minutes.<ref name="MGBio" />

He turned professional in 2005 and began the season with Calgary's [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Omaha Ak-Sar-Ben Knights]]. He struggled at first, resulting in a demotion to the [[ECHL]]'s [[Las Vegas Wranglers]] where he had greater success.<ref name="SurprisePardy">{{cite web |last=MacFarlane |first=Steve |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Calgary/2008/09/29/6918331-sun.html |title=Special surprise Pardy |work=Calgary Sun |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2010-01-07}}</ref> He bounced between the two clubs for much of the season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.echl.com/cgi-bin/mpublic.cgi?action=show_news&cat=1&id=6427 |title=Pardy Recalled From Wranglers To Omaha |publisher=ECHL |date=2005-12-21 |accessdate=2010-01-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.echl.com/cgi-bin/mpublic.cgi?action=show_news&cat=1&id=7428 |title=Pardy Returns To Wranglers From Omaha |publisher=ECHL |date=2006-03-25 |accessdate=2010-01-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  He finished the season with zero points in 24 games in the AHL along with one goal and 11 assists in 41 games in the ECHL.<ref name="LOH" /> He played his first full AHL season in Omaha in [[2006<U+2013>07 AHL season|2006<U+2013>07]], appearing in 70 games,<ref name="SurprisePardy" /> scoring two goals and six assists.<ref name="LOH" />  He did not earn much ice time initially as the coaches played him sparingly for the first three months of the season.

Entering his third season of professional hockey in [[2007<U+2013>08 NHL season|2007<U+2013>08]], Pardy continued to impress the Flames organization with his development, and while he did not make the team out of training camp, he was one of the final cuts.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cruickshank |first=Scott |url=http://www2.canada.com/topics/sports/hockey/flamesstory.html?id=0945c5ee-1a2b-4102-88eb-1bd72fe5b185&k=24119 |title=Pardy chases lucky no. 8 |work=Calgary Herald |date=2007-09-22 |accessdate=2010-01-07}}</ref>  He joined the [[Quad City Flames]] for the season, but was recalled to Calgary in December 2007 after [[Robyn Regehr]] suffered a bone bruise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.echl.com/cgi-bin/mpublic.cgi?action=show_news&cat=1&id=12991 |title=Former Wrangler Pardy ready for chance with Flames |publisher=ECHL |date=2007-12-09 |accessdate=2010-01-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He did not appear in a game, however.<ref name="MGBio">{{Cite book |title=2009<U+2013>10 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |last=Hanlon |first=Peter |last2=Kelso |first2=Sean |url=http://flames.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=40390 |format=PDF |year=2009 |page=86}}</ref> He finished the season in Quad City, playing in 65 games, scoring five goals and 18 points.<ref name="LOH">{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=21431 |title=Adam Pardy player profile |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-01-07}}</ref> He played for Team Canada at the 2007<U+2013>08 AHL All-Star Game in [[Binghamton, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.echl.com/cgi-bin/mpublic.cgi?action=show_news&cat=1&id=13620 |title=13 Former ECHL Players Selected For AHL All-Star Game |publisher=ECHL |date=2008-01-25 |accessdate=2010-01-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Pardy is not an offensive defenceman, instead focusing his play on preventing his opposition from scoring.
