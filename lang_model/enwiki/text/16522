'''Albert Bridge''' is a [[listed building|Grade II* listed]] road bridge over the [[River Thames]] in [[West London]], connecting [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] on the north bank to [[Battersea]] on the south bank. Designed and built by [[Rowland Mason Ordish]] in 1873 as an [[Ordish<U+2013>Lefeuvre Principle]] modified [[cable-stayed bridge]], it proved to be structurally unsound, and so between 1884 and 1887 [[Joseph Bazalgette|Sir Joseph Bazalgette]] incorporated some of the design elements of a [[suspension bridge]]. The [[Greater London Council]] carried out further strengthening work in 1973 by adding two concrete [[pier (architecture)|piers]], which transformed the central span into a simple [[beam bridge]]. As a result of these modifications the bridge today is an unusual hybrid of three different design styles.

Built as a [[toll bridge]], it was commercially unsuccessful; six years after its opening it was taken into public ownership and the tolls were lifted. The [[toll booth|tollbooths]] remained in place however, and are the only surviving examples of bridge tollbooths in London. Nicknamed "The Trembling Lady" because of its tendency to vibrate when large numbers of people walked over it, signs at the entrances warn troops from the nearby [[Chelsea Barracks]] to break step while crossing the bridge.

Incorporating a roadway only {{convert|27|ft|m}} wide, and with serious structural weaknesses, the bridge was ill-equipped to cope with the advent of the motor vehicle during the 20th century. Despite the many calls for its demolition or pedestrianisation Albert Bridge has remained open to vehicles throughout its existence, other than for brief spells during repairs, and is one of only two Thames road bridges in central London never to have been replaced. The strengthening work carried out by Bazalgette and the Greater London Council was unable to prevent further deterioration of the bridge's structure. A series of increasingly strict traffic control measures have been introduced to limit its use and thus prolong its life, making it the least busy Thames road bridge in London except for the little-used [[Southwark Bridge]]. The bridge's condition is continuing to degrade however, as the result of traffic load and severe rotting of the timber [[deck (bridge)|deck]] structure caused by the urine of the many dogs using it as a route to nearby [[Battersea Park]].

In 1992 Albert Bridge was rewired and painted in an unusual colour scheme designed to make it more conspicuous in poor visibility, and hence avoid being damaged by collisions with shipping. At night it is illuminated by 4,000&nbsp;bulbs, making it one of West London's most striking landmarks.

==Background==
[[File:Stanford 1891 Chelsea bridges.png|left|thumb|300px|Chelsea and Battersea in 1891, showing (left to right) Old Battersea Bridge, Albert Bridge, Victoria (now Chelsea) Bridge and Grosvenor Railway Bridge. Battersea and Albert bridges are less than {{convert|500|yd|m}} apart.]]
The historic industrial town of [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] on the north bank of the [[River Thames]] about {{convert|3|mi|km}} west of [[Westminster]], and the rich farming village of [[Battersea]] facing Chelsea on the south bank, were linked by the modest wooden [[Battersea Bridge]] in 1771.<ref name="Matthews65">{{Harvnb|Matthews|2008|p=65}}</ref> In 1842 the [[Commissioners of Woods and Forests|Commission of Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues]] recommended the construction of an [[Thames Embankment|embankment]] at Chelsea to free new land for development, and proposed a new bridge downstream of Battersea Bridge, and the replacement of the latter by a more modern structure.<ref name="Roberts130">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=130}}</ref> Work on the [[Chelsea Embankment]] began in 1862, and work on the [[Chelsea Bridge|Victoria Bridge]] (later renamed Chelsea Bridge), a short distance downstream of Battersea Bridge, began in 1851 and was completed in 1858.<ref name="Roberts112">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=112}}</ref> Meanwhile, the proposal to demolish Battersea Bridge was abandoned.<ref name="Roberts130" />
 
Although Chelsea and Battersea were then linked by two bridges, the wooden Battersea Bridge had become dilapidated by the mid-19th century. It had grown unpopular and was considered unsafe.<ref name="Roberts63">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=63}}</ref> The newer Victoria Bridge, meanwhile, suffered severe congestion. In 1860, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] suggested that a new [[tollbridge]] built between the two existing bridges would be profitable,<ref name="Davenport71">{{Harvnb|Davenport|2006|p=71}}</ref> and in the early 1860s the Albert Bridge Company was formed with the aim of building this new crossing.<ref name="Matthews71">{{Harvnb|Matthews|2008|p=71}}</ref> An 1863 proposal was blocked by strong opposition from the operators of Battersea Bridge, which was less than {{convert|500|yd|m}} from the proposed site of the new bridge and whose owners were consequently concerned over potential loss of custom.<ref name="Matthews71" /> A compromise was reached, and in 1864 a new Act of Parliament was passed, authorising the new bridge on condition that it was completed within five years.<ref name="Cookson126">{{Harvnb|Cookson|2006|p=126}}</ref> The Act compelled the Albert Bridge Company to purchase Battersea Bridge once the new bridge opened, and to compensate its owners by paying them <U+00A3>3,000 per annum (about <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|3000|1864|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in the interim.<ref name="Davenport72" />{{Inflation-fn|UK}} 

[[File:Bridge of Franz Joseph I., Prague.jpg|right|thumb|The 1868 [[Franz Joseph Bridge]] in Prague was built to the proposed design of the future Albert Bridge.]]
[[Rowland Mason Ordish]] was appointed to design the new bridge.<ref name="Matthews71" /> Ordish was a leading architectural engineer who had worked on the [[Royal Albert Hall]], [[St Pancras railway station]], the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] and [[Holborn Viaduct]].<ref name="Matthews71" /> The bridge was built using the [[Ordish<U+2013>Lefeuvre Principle]], an early form of [[cable-stayed bridge]] design which Ordish had patented in 1858.<ref name="Davenport71" /> Ordish's design resembled a conventional [[suspension bridge]] in employing a [[parabola|parabolic]] cable to support the centre of the bridge, but differed in its use of 32&nbsp;inclined [[Guy-wire|stays]] to support the remainder of the load.<ref name="Smith38">{{Harvnb|Smith|2001|p=38}}</ref> Each stay consisted of a flat [[wrought iron]] bar attached to the bridge deck, and a [[wire rope]] composed of 1,000 {{convert|1/10|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=2}} diameter wires joining the wrought iron bar to one of the four octagonal support columns.<ref name="Tilly217">{{Harvnb|Tilly|2002|p=217}}</ref>

==Design and construction==
Although authorised in 1864, work on the bridge was delayed by negotiations over the proposed [[Chelsea Embankment]], since the bridge's design could not be finalised until the exact layout of the new roads being built on the north bank of the river had been agreed.<ref name="Cookson126" /> While plans for the Chelsea Embankment were debated, Ordish built the [[Franz Joseph Bridge]] over the [[Vltava]] in [[Prague]] to the same design as that intended for the Albert Bridge.<ref name="Matthews72">{{Harvnb|Matthews|2008|p=72}}</ref><ref group="n">Damaged during the [[Second World War]], the Franz Joseph Bridge was replaced by a more conventional bridge in the 1950s. Albert Bridge and the Franz Joseph Bridge were the only significant bridges built using the Ordish<U+2013>Lefeuvre Principle; a third smaller Ordish<U+2013>Lefeuvre Principle bridge was also built in [[Singapore]].</ref>

[[File:ILN Chelsea Embankment & Albert Bridge construction.jpg|left|thumb|Chelsea Embankment and the Albert Bridge under construction, 1873]]
In 1869, the time allowed by the 1864 Act to build the bridge expired. Delays caused by the Chelsea Embankment project meant that work on the bridge had not even begun, and a new Act of Parliament was required to extend the time limit.<ref name="Cookson126" /> Construction finally got underway in 1870, and it was anticipated that the bridge would be completed in about a year, at a cost of <U+00A3>70,000 (about <U+00A3>{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|70000|1869|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}<ref name="Matthews72" /> In the event the project ran for over three years, and the final bill came to <U+00A3>200,000 (about <U+00A3>{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|200000|1873|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).<ref name="Cookson126" />{{Inflation-fn|UK}} It was intended to open the bridge and the Chelsea Embankment in a joint ceremony in 1874, but the Albert Bridge Company was keen to start recouping the substantially higher than expected costs, and the bridge opened with no formal ceremony on 23 August 1873, almost ten years after its authorisation.<ref name="Matthews72" /> As the law demanded, the Albert Bridge Company then bought Battersea Bridge.<ref name="Matthews71" /><ref name="Cookson123">{{Harvnb|Cookson|2006|p=123}}</ref>

Ordish's bridge was {{convert|41|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|710|ft|m}} long, with a {{convert|384|ft|9|in|m|adj=on}} central span.<ref name="Davenport72">{{Harvnb|Davenport|2006|p=72}}</ref> The deck was supported by 32&nbsp;rigid steel rods suspended from four octagonal [[cast iron]] towers, with the towers resting on cast iron piers.<ref name="Cookson126" /> The four piers were cast at [[Battersea]] and floated down the river into position, at which time they were filled with concrete; at the time they were the largest castings ever made.<ref name="Cookson126" /><ref name="Matthews72" /> Unlike most other suspension bridges of the time, the towers were positioned outside the bridge to avoid causing any obstruction to the roadway.<ref name="Matthews72" /> At each entrance was a pair of [[toll booth|tollbooths]] with a bar between them, to prevent people entering the bridge without paying.<ref name="Matthews72" /> 

[[File:Albert Bridge notice.JPG|upright|right|thumb|Warning to troops]]
The bridge acquired the nickname of "The Trembling Lady" because of its tendency to vibrate, particularly when used by troops from the nearby [[Chelsea Barracks]].<ref name="Cookson127">{{Harvnb|Cookson|2006|p=127}}</ref> Concerns about the risks of [[mechanical resonance]] effects on suspension bridges, following the 1831 collapse of the [[Broughton Suspension Bridge]] and the 1850 collapse of [[Angers Bridge]], led to notices being placed at the entrances warning troops to break step (i.e., not to march in rhythm) when crossing the bridge;<ref name="Cookson130">{{Harvnb|Cookson|2006|p=130}}</ref> although the barracks closed in 2008, the warning signs are still in place today.<ref name="Tilly217" /><ref group="n">A similar resonance effect caused the temporary closure of the nearby [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] in 2000 shortly after its opening.</ref>

==Transfer to public ownership==
[[File:Albert Bridge tollhouse.JPG|upright|left|thumb|The octagonal tollbooths are London's last surviving bridge tollbooths.]]
Albert Bridge was catastrophically unsuccessful financially. By the time the new bridge opened the Albert Bridge Company had been paying compensation to the Battersea Bridge Company for nine years, and on completion of the new bridge became liable for the costs of repairing the by then dilapidated and dangerous structure.<ref name="Pay70">{{Harvnb|Pay|Lloyd|Waldegrave|2009|p=70}}</ref> The cost of subsidising Battersea Bridge drained funds intended for the building of wide approach roads, making the bridge difficult to reach.<ref name="Roberts130" /> Located slightly further from central London than neighbouring Victoria (Chelsea) Bridge, demand for the new bridge was less than expected, and in the first nine months of its operation only <U+00A3>2,085 (about <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2085|1874|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) was taken in tolls.{{Inflation-fn|UK}}<ref name="Pay70" />

In 1877 the [[Metropolis Toll Bridges Act 1877|Metropolis Toll Bridges Act]] was passed, which allowed the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] to buy all London bridges between [[Hammersmith Bridge|Hammersmith]] and [[Waterloo Bridge|Waterloo]] bridges and free them from tolls.<ref name="Cookson147">{{Harvnb|Cookson|2006|p=147}}</ref> In 1879, Albert Bridge, which had cost <U+00A3>200,000 to build, was bought by the Board of Works along with Battersea Bridge for a combined price of <U+00A3>170,000 (about <U+00A3>{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|170000|1879|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}<ref name="TimesFreeing">{{citation|title=The Freeing of the Bridges|date=1880-06-28|newspaper=The Times|page=p. 12|accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> The tolls were removed from both bridges on 24 May 1879,<ref name="Davenport71" /> but the octagonal tollbooths were left in place, and today are the only surviving bridge tollbooths in London.<ref name="Quinn237">{{Harvnb|Quinn|2008|p=237}}</ref>

==Structural weaknesses==
In 1884 the Board of Works' Chief Engineer [[Joseph Bazalgette|Sir Joseph Bazalgette]] conducted an inspection of the bridge and found that the iron rods were already showing serious signs of corrosion.<ref name="Cookson127" /> Over the next three years the staying rods were augmented with steel chains, giving it an appearance more closely resembling a conventional suspension bridge,<ref name="Tilly217" /><ref name="Roberts131">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=131}}</ref> and a new timber deck was laid, at a total cost of <U+00A3>25,000 (about <U+00A3>{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|25000|1884|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).<ref name="Davenport71" />{{inflation-fn|UK}} Despite these improvements, Bazalgette was still concerned about its structural integrity and a weight limit of five [[long ton|tons]] was imposed on vehicles using the bridge.<ref name="Matthews72" />

With a roadway only {{convert|27|ft|m}} wide and subject to weight restrictions from early on, Albert Bridge was ill-suited to the advent of motorised transport in the 20th century. In 1926 the [[Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic]] recommended demolition and rebuilding of the bridge to carry four lanes of traffic, but the plan was not carried out because of a shortage of funds in the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="Roberts132">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=132}}</ref> It continued to deteriorate, and in 1935 the weight limit was reduced to two tons.<ref name="Roberts132" />

Because of its ongoing structural weaknesses, in 1957 the [[London County Council]] proposed replacing Albert Bridge with a more conventional design. A protest campaign led by [[John Betjeman]] resulted in the proposal being withdrawn, but there continued to be serious concerns about the integrity of the bridge.<ref name="Cookson127" /> In 1964 an experimental [[tidal flow (traffic)|tidal flow]] scheme was introduced, in which only northbound traffic was permitted to use the bridge in the mornings and only southbound traffic in the evenings.<ref name="Matthews72" /> The bridge's condition continued to deteriorate however, and in 1970 the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) sought and obtained consent to carry out strengthening work. In April 1972 the bridge was closed for the work to be carried out.<ref name="Matthews72" />

===Pedestrianised park proposal===
[[File:Albert Bridge view.JPG|right|thumb|Concrete central piers were added in 1973, making the bridge an unusual hybrid of a [[cable-stayed bridge]], [[suspension bridge]] and [[beam bridge]].]]
The GLC's solution entailed adding two concrete piers in the middle of the river to support the central span and thus tranform the bridge's central section into a [[beam bridge]].<ref name="Matthews73">{{Harvnb|Matthews|2008|p=73}}</ref> The bridge's main girder was also strengthened, and a lightweight replacement deck was laid. The modifications were intended to be a stopgap measure, to extend the bridge's life by five years while a replacement was being considered; in the the GLC's estimation the work would last for a maximum of 30&nbsp;years, but the bridge would need to be either closed or replaced well before then.<ref name="Cookson128" /> 

In early 1973, the ''[[Architectural Review]]'' submitted a proposal to convert Albert Bridge into a landscaped public park and pedestrian footpath across the river.<ref name="Roberts133">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=133}}</ref> The proposal proved very popular with the area's residents, and a May 1973 campaign led by [[John Betjeman]], [[Sybil Thorndike]] and [[Laurie Lee]] raised a [[petition]] of 2,000&nbsp;signatures for the bridge to be permanently closed to traffic on its reopening.<ref name="Matthews73" /> Although the GLC reopened the bridge to traffic in July 1973, it also announced its intention to proceed with the ''Architectural Review'' scheme once legal matters had been dealt with.<ref name="Matthews73" /><ref group="n">A modified form of the ''Architectural Review'' design was used in 1999 for the Green Bridge, carrying [[Mile End Park]] over [[Mile End Road]] in East London.</ref> 

The [[Royal Automobile Club]] campaigned vigorously against the pedestrianisation proposal. A publicity campaign fronted by actress [[Diana Dors]] in favour of reopening the bridge was launched, whilst a lobbying group of local residents led by poet [[Robert Graves]] campaigned in support of the GLC's plan.<ref name="Cookson127" /> Graves's campaign collected over a thousand signatures in support, but was vigorously attacked by the [[British Road Federation]], who derided the apparent evidence of public support for the scheme as "sending a lot of students around to [[council flat]]s [where] most people will sign anything without knowing what it is all about".<ref name="Cookson128">{{Harvnb|Cookson|2006|p=128}}</ref> A [[public enquiry]] of 1974 recommended that the bridge remain open to avoid causing congestion on neighbouring bridges, and it remained open to traffic with the tidal flow and 2-ton weight limit in place.<ref name="Matthews73" />

==Present day==
[[File:Albert Bridge columns.JPG|left|upright|thumb|The unusual current colour scheme is intended to increase visibility to shipping in poor lighting conditions.]]
In 1990, the tidal flow system was abandoned and Albert Bridge was converted back to two way traffic. A [[traffic island]] was installed on the south end of the bridge to prevent larger vehicles from using it. In the early years of the 21st century the Chelsea area experienced a growth in the popularity of large [[four-wheel drive]] cars (so-called [[Chelsea tractor]]s), many of which were over the two-ton weight limit; it was estimated that {{frac|1|3}} of all vehicles using the bridge were over the weight limit.<ref name="Guardian Tractors">{{citation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/aug/20/transportintheuk.travelsenvironmentalimpact|title=Chelsea choked by its tractors|last=Temko|first=Ned|authorlink=Ned Temko|date=2006-08-20|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-06-04}}</ref> In July 2006 the {{convert|27|ft|m|adj=on}} wide roadway was narrowed to a single lane in each direction to reduce the load.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5225686.stm|title=Albert Bridge feeling the strain|date=2006-07-28|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-06-04}}</ref> Red and white plastic barriers have been erected along the roadway in an effort to protect the structure from damage caused by cars.<ref name="Builder & Engineer">{{citation|date=2008-03-17|title=Albert Bridge undergoes restoration study |journal=Builder & Engineer|location=London|url=http://www.builderandengineer.co.uk/news/general/albert-bridge-undergoes-restoration-study-1724.html|accessdate=2009-06-04}}</ref>

Between 1905 and 1981 Albert Bridge had been painted in a uniform green colour and in 1981 was repainted yellow, but in 1992 it underwent significant redecoration and rewiring.<ref name="Roberts135">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=135}}</ref> Partially as a result, it is now a major West London landmark. The bridge is painted in a scheme of pink, blue and green, intended to increase visibility in fog and murky light and hence reduce the risks of shipping colliding with the fragile structure during the day.<ref name="Cookson129">{{Harvnb|Cookson|2006|p=129}}</ref> At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage [[tungsten-halogen bulb]]s illuminate the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by [[Mary Archer]], at the time Chairwoman of the [[National Energy Foundation]].<ref name="Cookson130" /> Its distinctive and striking current appearance has led to its being used as a backdrop for numerous films set in the Chelsea area, such as ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'', ''[[Sliding Doors]]'' and ''[[Maybe Baby (2000 film)|Maybe Baby]]''.<ref name="Roberts133" />

[[File:Albert Bridge illuminations.jpg|right|thumb|4,000 bulbs illuminate Albert Bridge at night.]]
Except for [[Tower Bridge]], built in 1894, Albert Bridge is the only Thames road bridge in central London never to have been replaced.<ref name="Cookson126" /> Despite being intended as a temporary measure to be removed in 1978, the concrete central piers remain in place,<ref name="Cookson130" /> and although in 1974 its lifespan was estimated at a maximum of 30 years, the bridge is still standing and still operational.<ref name="Cookson128" /> Albert Bridge was given protection as a [[listed building|Grade II* listed structure]] in 1975, granting it protection against further significant alteration without consultation.<ref>{{IoE|206969}} Images of England website. Retrieved on 2009-06-06.</ref> Despite this, it continues to deteriorate. Although proposals have been drawn up by [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|Kensington and Chelsea Council]] to repair and rescue it,<ref name="Builder & Engineer" /> as of March 2008 funds for the repairs were unavailable.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3555651/Whats-a-girl-to-do-against-all-this-blah.html|title=What's a girl to do against all this blah?|last=Paige|first=Elaine|authorlink=Elaine Paige|date=2008-03-02|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2009-06-04}}</ref> As well as structural damage caused by traffic, the timbers underpinning the deck are being seriously rotted by the urine of dogs crossing it to and from nearby [[Battersea Park]].<ref name="Roberts134">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=134}}</ref><ref group="n">Because of the lack of large open spaces on the north side of the river in this area large numbers of dogs cross daily to be walked in Battersea Park.</ref> With multiple measures in place to reduce traffic flow and prolong the life of the bridge, as of 2009 it carries approximately 19,000 vehicles per day, the lowest usage of any Thames road bridge in London other than the little-used [[Southwark Bridge]].<ref name="Pay71">{{Harvnb|Pay|Lloyd|Waldegrave|2009|p=71}}</ref>
