The '''Lower Canada Rebellion''' is the name given to the armed conflict between the rebels of [[Lower Canada]] (now [[Quebec]]) and the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial power of that province. Together with the simultaneous [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] in the neighbouring colony of [[Upper Canada]] (now [[Ontario]]), it formed the [[Rebellions of 1837]].

== History ==
The rebellion of Lower Canada continued in 1838 and is often called ''Les r<U+00E9>bellions de 1837-38'' in Quebec. The actions of the rebels resulted in the declaration of [[martial law]] and a first armed conflict occurred in 1837 when the 26 members of the ''Patriote'' movement who had been charged with illegal activities chose to resist their arrest by the authorities under the direction of [[John Colborne]]. In 1838, two major armed conflicts occurred when groups of Lower Canadian ''Patriotes'' led by [[Robert Nelson]] crossed the American border in an attempt to invade Lower Canada and Upper Canada, drive the British army out and establish independent republics.

These events are often misreported, which moves the attention away from three decades of political battles between the [[Parti patriote]] of [[James Stuart (Lower Canada statesman)|James Stuart]] and [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]], which was seeking [[responsible government]] for the colony, and the unelected British Executive and [[Legislative Council of Lower Canada|Legislative Council]]s in the former [[French colony]], which were dominated by a small group of mainly businessmen known as the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau Clique]], the equivalent of the [[Family Compact]] in [[Upper Canada]]. 

The movement for reform took shape in a period of economic disenfranchisement of the [[French language|French]]-speaking majority and working class English speaking citizens. However, the rebellion was not about language but centered on the unfairness of colonial governing as such, many of the leaders and participants were English-speaking citizens of Lower Canada. In banking, the timber trade, and transportation, Anglophones were seen as disproportionately represented. However, the [[Roman Catholic]] church discouraged French-Canadians from commercial activities, asserting it was God's will that they remain an [[agrarian]] society. (Out of 775 identified rebels from Lower Canada, 388 were farmers.) At the same time, some among the Anglophone business elite were advocating for a union of Upper and Lower Canada in order to ensure competitiveness on a national scale with the increasingly large and powerful economy of the [[United States]]. The unification of the colony was a plan favoured by the British-appointed governor, [[George Ramsey, Earl of Dalhousie]]. The reaction was a growing sense of nationalism among English and the French-speaking citizens, which solidified into the [[Parti canadien]]. (After 1826 called the Parti patriote.) 

In 1811, James Stuart became leader of the Parti canadien in the assembly and in 1815, reformer Louis-Joseph Papineau was elected Assembly speaker. The Assembly, while elected, had little power; its decisions could be vetoed by a legislative council and the governor appointed by the British government. Dalhousie and Papineau were soon at odds over the issue of uniting the Canadas, and Dalhousie forced an election in 1827 rather than accept Papineau as speaker. Sympathizers to the reform movement in England had Dalhousie forced from his position and reappointed to [[India]]. Still, the legislative council and the assembly were not able to reach a compromise, and by 1834, the assembly had passed the [[Ninety-Two Resolutions]], outlining its grievances against the legislative council. At that point, the Patriote movement was supported by an overwhelming majority of the population in all origins.

Later in 1834 the Parti Patriote swept the election with more than three-quarters of the popular vote. However, the reformers in Lower Canada were divided over several issues. A moderate reformer named [[John Neilson]] had quit the party in 1830 and joined the Constitutional Association 4 years later. Papineau's anti-clerical position alienated reformers in the Catholic Church, and his support for secular rather than religious schools made him a powerful enemy in Bishop [[Jean-Jacques Lartigue]]. Lartigue called on all Catholics to reject the reform movement and support the authorities, forcing many to choose between their religion and their political convictions.

However, Papineau continued to push for reform. He petitioned the British government to bring about reform, but in March of 1837 the government of [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] rejected all of Papineau's requests. Papineau then organized protests and assemblies, and eventually approved the paramilitary [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> des Fils de la Libert<U+00E9>]] during the [[Assembl<U+00E9>e des six-comt<U+00E9>s]].

Papineau escaped to the United States, but the rebels set themselves up in the countryside, and, led by [[Wolfred Nelson]] defeated a British force at [[Saint-Denis, Quebec|Saint-Denis]] on [[November 23]]. However, the British troops soon beat back the rebels, defeating them at Saint-Charles on [[November 25]] and at [[Saint-Eustache, Quebec|Saint-Eustache]] on [[December 14]]. Saint-Eustache was then pillaged and ransacked. On December 5th, [[martial law]] was declared in Montr<U+00E9>al.

When news of the arrest of the Patriote leaders reached Upper Canada, [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] launched an armed rebellion in December of 1837. While this revolt was quickly put down, the rebellion in Lower Canada continued into the following year. Leaders who had escaped across the border into the United States raided Lower Canada in February of 1838, and a second revolt began at [[Beauharnois]] in November of the same year. This too was crushed by the British.

Meanwhile, Britain had dispatched [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] to investigate the cause of the rebellion. [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|His report]] recommended that [[the Canadas]] be united into one colony (the [[Province of Canada]]) so as to assimilate the French-speaking ''Canadiens'' into the culture of the [[British Empire]]. However, he recommended acceding to the rebels' grievances by granting responsible government to the new colony.

== Afterwards ==
Following the military defeat of the Patriotes, Lower Canada was merged with Upper Canada under the [[Act of Union (1840)|Union Act]] and the ''Canadiens'' became a minority in the new political entity. Eight years after the Union, a responsible government was set up in the united [[Province of Canada]]. The great instability of this new regime (see [[Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada]]) eventually led to the formation of the [[Great coalition]], and another major constitutional change, the [[Canadian Confederation]] of 1867.

The rebellion of the ''Patriotes Canadiens'' of Lower Canada is often seen as the example of what might have happened to the United States of America if the [[American Revolutionary War]] had failed. In Quebec, the rebellion (as well as the parliamentary and popular struggle) is now commemorated as the [[Journ<U+00E9>e nationale des Patriotes]] (National Patriotes Day) by the use of the [[Canadian Statutory Holiday]], [[Victoria Day]]. It has become a symbol for the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|contemporary Quebec independence movement]].
