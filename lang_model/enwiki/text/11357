'''''Palinurus elephas''''' is a [[spiny lobster]], which is commonly caught in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

==Distribution and habitat==
Palinurus elephas is a common lobster, found in the eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]], from southern [[Norway]] to [[Morocco]] and the [[Azores]] <ref name = Seashore> {{cite book |author=Peter Hayward, Tony Nelson-Smith & Chris Shields |title=Sea Shore of Britain and Europe |series=Collins Pocket Guides |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year=1996 |isbn=0002199556}} </ref>, and in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], except its eastern extremes.<ref name="MLW"/> It lives on rocky exposed coasts below the tidal zone,<ref name="Marlin"/> mainly at depths of {{convert|20|to|70|m}}.

==Description==
''P. elephas'' may reach up to {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} long,<ref name="Marlin"/> although rarely longer than {{convert|40|cm|abbr=on}},<ref name="MLW"/> and usually {{convert|25|-|30|cm|0|disp=or}}.<ref name = Handbook /> Few achieve their maximum weight of several kilograms.<ref name = Seashore />

The adults are reddish-brown with yellow spots. The [[carapace]] is slightly compressed and lacks lateral ridges. It is covered with forward pointing spines, with the supraorbital spines prominent. The antennae are very heavy and spiny. Their [[flagellum]] is tapering and is even longer than the body. The first walking leg (''pereopod'') is provided with subchela (the distal end of a limb developed as a prehensile structure). The fourth segment ([[Arthropod leg#Crustacea|''merus'')]] of this leg has a characteristic row of spines.<ref name = Handbook>{{cite book |author=P. J. Hayward & J. S. Ryland |title=Handbook of the Marine Fauna of North-West Europe |pages=430 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1996 |isbn=0198540558}}</ref>

==Reproduction==
The breeding season is in September and October, with the female brooding the reddish eggs. These eggs hatch about six months later in the spring as flattened, leaf-shaped, planktonic [[crustacean larvae|larvae]] (''phyllosoma larvae'').<ref name = Seashore /><ref name = Handbook />

==Diet==
It is nocturnal and feeds on small worms, crabs or dead animals, hiding in rock crevices or caves during the day.<ref name="Malawi"/>

==Uses==
It is a much sought-after delicacy and is widely caught for food around the Mediterranean Sea, mostly with [[lobster pot]]s, and is also caught less intensively off the Atlantic Coasts of Ireland, Portugal, France and England.<ref name="MLW"/> There are also small fisheries for this species on the west coast of Scotland, employing tangle nets or lobster pots.
