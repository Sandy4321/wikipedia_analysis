'''Paul Groves''' (born [[28 February]] [[1966]] in [[Derby]], [[England]]) is an [[England|English]]  former [[football (soccer)|footballer]] and current reserve-team coach at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].

==The Grimsby years==

===As player===
Groves spent two spells as a player at Grimsby, and was very consistent, regularly scoring goals from midfield, in addition to being a good tackler.  Indeed, he was top scorer in his first season at the club [[1992-93 in English football|1992-93]], with 12 goals in 46 matches. He also topped the club's scoring chart in [[1995-96 in English football|1995-96]] with 10 goals in 46 matches and in [[1998-99 in English football|1998/99]] with 14 goals in 46 matches.  He also played every league game in his first (four-season) spell and in his first three seasons after returning from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]]. He also spent several seasons as captain.

During his time at Grimsby, the club spent all but the [[1997-98 in English football|1997-98]] season in the [[Football League First Division|second tier]] of the football league, with only one season outside of it.  This was the successful play-off promotion and [[Football League Trophy|Auto Windscreens Shield]]-winning season, in which Groves captained Grimsby to two [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] wins (the third of his career) in the space of three weeks and started all 68 games that season. In addition to league success, there were several cup runs in which Grimsby beat [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] opposition including [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].

Groves first joined Grimsby from Blackpool for <U+00A3>150,000 in [[1992-93 in English football|1992]]. He joined West Brom for <U+00A3>600,000 in [[1996-97 in English football|1996]] but returned just over [[1997-98 in English football|a year later]] for <U+00A3>250,000.

He brought his 19-year playing career to a close in May [[2005-06 in English football|2005-06]] with [[Stafford Rangers F.C.|Stafford Rangers]] after helping them to promotion to the [[Conference National]]. In July 2006, he joined the coaching staff at Portsmouth.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/5175646.stm  					Groves leaves Stafford for Pompey]</ref>

===As manager===
Groves became player-manager of Grimsby in December 2001 with the club in danger of being relegated from Division One.  With several good loan signings, including [[Andy Todd]], he managed to steer the club to safety.  The [[2002-03 in English football|2002-03]] season was not as successful: the club was relegated. A poor [[2003-04 in English football|2003-04]] season saw Groves sacked as manager in February, but remarkably kept on as a player.

This spell as manager, as well as his eventual transfer to rivals [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe]] and perceived lack of charisma, has tarnished his reputation with Grimsby Town fans and he is not as highly regarded as someone with his playing and goal scoring record should have been.
