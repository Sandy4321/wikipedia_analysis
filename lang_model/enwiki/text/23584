The '''Tarascan state'''  was a state in pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]], roughly covering the geographic area of the present-day [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[States of Mexico|state]] of [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]]. At the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]] it was the second-largest state in Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}  The state was founded in the early 14th century and lost its independence to the Spanish in [[1530]]. In [[1543]] it officially became the governorship of Michoac<U+00E1>n, from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] name for the Tarascan state, Michoac<U+00E1>n ("place of those who have fish"). In [[P'urh<U+00E9>pecha language|P'urh<U+00E9>pecha]], language of the Tarascans, the name of the state was ''Ir<U+00E9>checua Tzintzuntz<U+00E1>ni'', the "lands of Tzintzuntzan".

The people of the Tarascan empire were mostly of [[P'urh<U+00E9>pecha]] ethnic affiliation but also included other ethnic groups such as the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Matlatzinca]] and [[Chichimec]].  These ethnic groups were gradually assimilated into the P'urh<U+00E9>pecha majority group.

The Tarascan state was constituted of a network of tributary systems and gradually became increasingly centralized, under the control of the ''"Caconzi"'', the ruler and king of the state. The Tarascan capital was located at [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]] on the banks of [[Lake P<U+00E1>tzcuaro]], Michoac<U+00E1>n, and, according to Tarascan oral tradition was founded by the first ''caconzi'' [[Tar<U+00ED>acuri]] and dominated by his lineage the "''Uac<U+00FA>secha''" ("Eagles" in P'urh<U+00E9>pecha).

The Tarascan state was contemporary with and an enemy of the [[Aztec Empire]], against which it fought many wars. The Tarascan empire blocked Aztec expansion to the northwest, and the Tarascans fortified and patrolled their frontiers with the Aztecs, possibly developing the first truly territorial state of Mesoamerica.  

Due to its relative isolation within Mesoamerica, the Tarascan state had many cultural traits completely distinct from those of the Mesoamerican cultural group.  It is particularly noteworthy for being among the few Mesoamerican civilizations to use metal for tools and ornamentation.

==Geography and lithic occupation==
The territory that would eventually form the setting of the Tarascan state is the high volcanic region constituting the western extension of the Mexican Mesa Central, in between two large rivers: the [[Lerma River|Lerma]] and [[Balsas River]]s.  Including temperate, subtropical and tropical climate zones, it is dominated by [[Cenozoic]] volcanic mountains and lake basins above 2000 meters altitude, but also includes lower land in the southwestern coastal regions. Most common soil types in the central plateau are young volcanic [[Andosol]]s,  [[Luvisol]]s and less fertile [[Acrisol]]s.  The vegetation is mainly pine, pine-oak and fir. Human occupation has focused on the lake basins, which are abundant in resources. In the north, near the Lerma river, there are [[obsidian]] resources and [[thermal springs]]. The Tarascan state was centered around the [[Lake P<U+00E1>tzcuaro]] basin.

==History of the Tarascan state==
[[Image:Mexico.Mich.Tzintzuntzan.01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The archaeological site of [[Tzintzuntzan]], capital of the Tarascan state]]
===Early archaeological evidence===
The Tarascan area has been inhabited at least since the early [[Mesoamerican chronology|Pre-classic period]].  Early lithic evidence from before 2500 B.C. like [[Folsom point|fluted points]] and stone utensils are found at some [[Megafauna]] kill sites. The earliest radio-carbon dates of archeological sites fall around 1200 B.C.  The best known early Pre-classic culture of Michoac<U+00E1>n was the [[Chupicuaro culture]]. Chup<U+00ED>cuaro sites are mostly found on lake islands which can be seen as a sign of it having traits relating it to the later Tarascan cultural patterns.  In the early Classic period, [[Mesoamerican Ballgame|ballcourts]] and other artifacts demonstrate a [[Teotihuacan]] influence in the Michoac<U+00E1>n region.

===Ethnohistorical Sources===
The most useful ethnohistorical source has been the ''[[Relaci<U+00F3>n de Michoac<U+00E1>n]],'' written around 1540 by the Franciscan priest [[Fray Jeronimo de Acal<U+00E1>]], containing translated and transcribed narratives from Tarascan noblemen.  This ''Relaci<U+00F3>n'' contains parts of the "official Tarascan history" as carried down through oral tradition: one part focuses on Tarascan state religion, the second on Tarascan society, and the last on Tarascan history and the Spanish conquest.  Unfortunately the first part is only partly preserved.  Other sources include a number of small pictorial manuscripts, the best known being the ''Lienzo de Jucutacuto''.

==Foundation and expansion==
{{Tarascan rulers}}
In the late classic at least two non-P'urh<U+00E9>pecha ethnic groups lived around Lake P<U+00E1>tzcuaro: Nahuatl speakers in Jar<U+00E1>cuaro, and some Chichimecan cultures on the northern banks, with the Nahua population being the second largest.  

According to the ''Relaci<U+00F3>n de Michoac<U+00E1>n'' a visionary leader of the P'orh<U+00E9>pecha named [[Tar<U+00ED>acuri]] decided to gather the communities  around Lake P<U+00E1>tzcuaro into one strong state. Around 1300 he undertook the first conquests and installed his sons Hiripan and Tang<U+00E1>xoan as lords of [[Ihuatzio]] and [[Tzintzuntzan]] respectively, himself ruling from P<U+00E1>tzcuari city. By the death of Tar<U+00ED>acuri (around 1350), his lineage was in control of all the major centers around Lake P<U+00E1>tzcuaro.  His son Hiripan continued the expansion into the area surrounding [[Lake Cuitzeo]]. 

[[Hiripan]] and later his brother [[Tang<U+00E1>xuan I]] began to institutionalize the tributary system and consolidate the political unity of the empire. They created an administrative bureaucracy and divided responsibilities of and tributes from the conquered territories between lords and nobles.  In the following years first the Tarascan sierra and then the Balsas basin was incorporated into the increasingly centralized state. 

Under the rule of ''cazonci'' [[Tzitzipand<U+00E1>quare]] a number of regions were conquered, only to be lost again by rebellions or strategic retreats when confronted with Aztec expansion. In 1460 the Tarascan state reached the Pacific coast at [[Zacatula]], advanced into the valley of [[Toluca#Geography|Toluca]], and also, on the northern rim, reached into the present day state of [[Guanajuato]].  In the 1470s Aztecs under [[Axayacatl]] captured a series of Tarascan frontier towns and closed in on the Tarascan heartland, but were eventually defeated. This experience prompted the Tarascan ruler to further fortify the Aztec frontier with military centers along the border, such as at [[Cutzamala (Mesoamerican site)|Cutzamala]]. He also allowed [[Otomi people|Otomi]]es and [[Matlatzinca]]s who had been driven out of their homelands by the Aztecs to settle in the border area under the condition that they took part in the defense of the Tarascan lands. From 1480 the Aztec ruler [[Auitzotl|Ahuitzotl]] intensified the conflict with the Tarascans. He supported attacks on Tarascan lands by other ethnic groups allied with or subjugated to the Aztecs such as [[Matlatzinca]]s, [[Chontal de la Sierra|Chontales]], and [[Cuitlatec]]s. The Tarascans, led by the Caconzi [[Zuangua]], repelled the attacks but further Tarascan expansion was halted until the arrival of the Spaniards two years into the rule of the last Caconzi of an independent Tarascan state, [[Tang<U+00E1>xuan II]].

==Fall of the Tarascan state==
After hearing about the fall of the Aztec Empire, the Tarascan Caconzi Tang<U+00E1>xuan II sent emissaries to the Spanish victors. A few Spaniards went with them to Tzintzuntzan where they were presented to the ruler and gifts were exchanged. They returned with samples of gold and Cort<U+00E9>s' interest in the Tarascan state was awakened. In 1522 a Spanish force under the leadership of [[Cristobal de Olid]] was sent into Tarascan territory and arrived at Tzintzuntzan within days. The Tarascan army numbered many thousands, perhaps as many as 100,000, but at the crucial moment they chose not to fight.<ref>Gorenstein (1993, xiv).</ref> Tang<U+00E1>xuan submitted to the Spanish administration, but for his cooperation was allowed a large degree of autonomy. This resulted in a strange arrangement where both Cort<U+00E9>s and Tang<U+00E1>xuan considered themselves rulers of Michoac<U+00E1>n for the following years: the population of the area paid tribute to them both. When the Spanish found out that Tang<U+00E1>xuan was still ''de facto'' ruler of his empire but only supplied the Spanish with a small part of the resources extracted from the population they sent the ruthless conquistador [[Nu<U+00F1>o Beltr<U+00E1>n de Guzm<U+00E1>n|Nu<U+00F1>o de Guzm<U+00E1>n]], who allied himself with a Tarascan noble [[Don Pedro Panza]] ''Cuinier<U+00E1>ngari'', and the Caconzi was executed.<ref>See Gorenstein (1993, xv). According to some other sources Tang<U+00E1>xuan II was dragged behind a horse and then burned.</ref> A period of violence and turbulence began. During the next decades Tarascan puppet rulers were installed by the Spanish government, but when Nu<U+00F1>o de Guzman had been disgraced and recalled to Spain, Bishop [[Vasco de Quiroga]] was sent to the area to clean up.  He rapidly gained the respect and friendship of the natives who ceased hostilities towards the Spanish hegemony.
