==Background and recording==
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="What it really means is, 'I'm all the chaos and all the things you can't control in your life, but don't be afraid of it, because that's how it's always going to be.' You can't be too afraid to go live and take what you want out of life. You can't control all the crazy stuff that happens to you. All you can control is the way you handle it."|source=-Amy Lee talking about "What You Want"<ref name="ref1" />}}

"What You Want" was written by [[Amy Lee]], [[Terry Balsamo]], and [[Tim McCord]] in New York City and the production was handled by [[Nick Raskulinecz]].<ref name="mtv20110711" /><ref name="windupbook" /> During an interview with [[MTV News]] in June, Lee talked about the song saying, "[...] the song that I think is the first single is the song that wraps it all up. It's got a cool meaning, a lot of great lyrics going on, it also just smacks you right in the face and it's heavy and it's great."<ref name="mtv31" /> She noted that the song was a departure from the band's previous material and acknowledged that they wanted the new single to be "more than a hit".<ref name="mtv31" />

Lee stated the song was inspired by and talked about her relationship with the band's fans, and the realization that following a music career "is what I'm supposed to do". She also explained that the theme of the song was freedom, saying that the song's lyric "Remember who you really are" was "exactly everything you could assume it means".<ref name="mtv20110711" /> Another inspiration for the song came from Lee's life, "That song is me talking to myself about not being afraid and coming back to this thing and living the life I was born to live. Sometimes, it takes a lot to do this. And I do love it very much, but there is always that fear of putting yourself under the microscope."<ref name="reuters" />

Speaking about the sound, Lee described "What You Want" as "very danceable" and her own vocals as "fun and snappy and it gives a cool dynamic [to the song]".<ref name="mtv1668697" /><ref name="mmusic" /> Lee stated that the process of recording the song was fun for the band as they had excess time. She said that initially the song was conceived while the band was just recording demo, but as time passed it progressed and grew into something more.<ref name="mtv20110711" /> She wrote a chorus for "What You Want" and played it on the piano. Lee revealed that she was initially embarrassed when she came up with the lyrics and the melody of the song as she thought the members of her band would think she was [[Janet Jackson]] due to the usage of a hook.<ref name="nme59472" /> During an interview with ''[[M Music & Musicians]]'' Lee revealed that she wouldn't have recorded the song if it had been brought to her before the recording of ''Evanescence'' as she would have thought it was "stupid".<ref name="mmusic" />

==Release==

Fans who identified an Evanescence song using the SoundTracking application and shared it to [[Twitter]], using the hashtag #Evcomeback, entered themselves to win an album from the band.<ref name="social" /> If fans checked in to Evanescence using GetGlue, they unlocked an exclusive sticker.<ref name="social" />

According to the fans{{'}} tweets, the new songs were well received and praised.<ref name="fans" /> Kara Klenk of the same publication also confirmed the positive reception adding, "In the fast-paced music world where artists need to constantly reinvent themselves and pump out music, videos, appearances, and tours to keep their fans happy and interested, it's rare for a band to take a multi-year hiatus and come back to legions of fans who have anxiously awaited their return."<ref name="fans2" />

==Composition==
"What You Want" contains a variety of musical elements and influences of several music genres: [[industrial rock]], [[rock music|rock]]<ref name="pop crush" />  gothic pop,<ref name="nmereview" /> [[nu-metal]],<ref name="Prokofiev" /> classic [[synthpop]],<ref name="artistdirect" /> electro-pop dance<ref name="Chad Grischow" /> and [[Baroque music|baroque metal]] along with a [[pop music|pop]] [[hook (music)|hook]].<ref name="rollkimmel" /> Several critics noted that some of the gothic and metal elements were prominent in the band's previous material, mostly due to their songs' piano-driven melody.<ref name="pop crush" /> Lewis Corner of the website [[Digital Spy]] noted that the classical strings present in the song reinforced the band's [[medieval]] influences.<ref name="Digital Spy" /> Dane Prokofiev of [[PopMatters]] further compared the song with [[Korn]]'s music<ref name="Prokofiev" /> while Rick Florino of [[Artistdirect]] noted similarities to works by [[Depeche Mode]].<ref name="artistdirect" /> The song's beat was further described as dynamic, "slamming" and loud.<ref name="rstonerstone" /><ref name="Chad Grischow" /><ref name="copseyrev" /> As the song progresses, the melody goes through "dramatic crashes" and [[crescendo]]s.<ref name="spinreview" /> 

"What You Want" opens with rapid [[drum kit|drums]]<ref name="nmereview" /> and soon moves into a guitar-driven mode, accompanied by [[synthesizer]]s.<ref name="pop crush" /> Throughout the song, Lee uses "pseudo [[operatic]]" and "poppy" vocals.<ref name="nme58530" /><ref name="Chad Grischow" /> In the opening lines, she sings: "Do what you, what you want / If you have a dream for better / Do what you, what you want / 'Til you don't want it anymore."<ref name="rstone20110823" /><ref name="pop crush" /> Those sounds are followed by a [[hard rock]] surging guitar and strings which were noted to be part of the band's characteristic sound.<ref name="nme58530" /><ref name="pop crush" /> The chorus is instrumentally complete with crashing [[cymbal]]s, "thrashing, high-wired rawk" guitars,<ref name="copseyrev" /> electric guitars, keyboards and piano<ref name="artistdirect" /><ref name="bill1005308962" /><ref name="spyrev" /> as Lee sings, "Hello, hello, remember me? I<U+2019>m everything you can<U+2019>t control / Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe we can break through."<ref name="artistdirect" /><ref name="pop crush" /> At the end of the song, Lee shouts the hook "Do what you, what you want," as her vocals are echoed and eventually fade away.<ref name="pop crush" /> Laurie Tuffrey of ''[[NME]]'' summarized the song as a "standard goth-pop fare, full of rapid drum breaks, swathes of fuzzy riffing and a catchy, chant-friendly chorus."<ref name="nmereview" /> Overally, Scott Shetler of Pop Crush described its production as "polished".<ref name="pop crush" />

Several critics interpreted the song's lyrics during their reviews. Its theme was noted to be about freedom.<ref name="Chad Grischow" /><ref name="spinreview" /> Jason Lipshutz of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' said that in the song, Lee is "trying to convince a romantic partner to stop 'spiraling down, down, down' and help her find a new beginning."<ref name="bill1005308962" /> ''[[Kerrang!]]'' writer [[Steve Beebee]] wrote that Lee reaches a conclusion that "Love will guide you home."<ref name="kerralbums" /> Talking about the lyrical content of the song, Laurie Tuffrey of ''NME'' opined: "It's quite hard to tell what the song's about, with lots of references to 'the unknown' and 'the pain', and it confusingly switches between suggesting people 'do what you want you want, if you have a dream for better' in the first verse and the decidedly creepier final chorus where Lee seemingly gets an ex-lover on the blower, only to tell them 'Hello, hello, it<U+2019>s only me, infecting everything you love'."<ref name="nmereview" />

==Critical reception==
Scott Shetler of Pop Crush described the song as a "forceful rock track that reminds fans why the group was one of the most successful crossover acts of the past decade" and praised Lee's "strong-but-pretty vocals".<ref name="pop crush" /> James Montgomery from MTV News, praised the song saying that the "elastic-yet-lock-step energy not only makes the song the perfect comeback single for a band that's been gone for far too long, but it manages to capture the very essence of what inspired them to press on."<ref name="mtv1668697" /> Tom Goodwyn of the same publication wrote: "A big thumping drumbeat and driving guitar riff kick things off, before giving way to a stomping chorus written with NFL stadiums in mind."<ref name="nmerev" /> Karen Bliss of the magazine ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised Lee's "haunting" and "crystalline" vocals in the "industrial-strength sound" of "What You Want".<ref name="rstone20110823" /> Nick Catucci of the same publication gave the song three stars writing, "Amy Lee trades anguish for defiance, goosing her wail with welcome sass. Still, she's nearly overrun by the music, a collision of two-ton guitars, strings and piano."<ref name="rstonerev" /> Steven Hyden of ''[[The A. V. Club]]'' wrote: "Lee really can sing, and the opener 'What You Want' shows she has the pipes (and even the submerged spunk) to become the new [[Pat Benatar]] this generation desperately needs."<ref name="avclub" /> Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave the song five out of five stars praising the hook as one of the best in the band's career adding that it managed to make the song "instantly unforgettable". Florino further called the song "another classic from Evanescence" which will "revive rock music again" and concluded:
<blockquote>
At the heart of this epic, Lee relays another personal story that impacts intensely, especially as the song breaks during the bridge and her voice takes flight like never before. Lyrics like 'Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe' sear and soar, as Lee continues to hypnotize like no other singer in rock or pop for that matter.<ref name="artistdirect" />
</blockquote>

While reviewing ''Evanescence'' as a whole, Catucci of ''Rolling Stone'' called the song "pummeling but pretty."<ref name="roll20111011" /> In another review for the same publication, Matthew Perpetua wrote that the "heaviness is less top-heavy" in the song before adding that the band "never sounded so brisk and dynamic".<ref name="rstonerstone" /> Camille Dodero of the same publication called "What You Want" a "hair-blowingly grandiose" song.<ref name="spintough" /> Melissa Maerz of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the song a B rating and said, "the song's grinding guitars, massive drums, goth-princess piano frills, and warrior-grrrl vocal rage feel like 2007 all over again."<ref name="maerz" /> Melinda Newman of [[HitFix]] praised the chorus lines saying that it should have been chosen as a theme song for the film ''[[Contagion (film)|Contagion]]''.<ref name="hitfix" /> 

Robert Copsey of Digital Spy described the song as a "hefty slab of dramatic rock which includes the band's trademark electric guitars with melodic choruses".<ref name="spyrev" /> In another review, he awarded the song four stars out of five stating "electro it certainly ain't, but the result is as dancefloor-friendly as it is mosh pit-ready." He further praised the "catchy-as-[[cholera]]" chorus and gave a mixed review about the lyrics and the title saying "fortunately their words seemed to have been a touch overzealous; though it's clear from the trailer for the group's third album that they've been spending a night or two on the tiles."<ref name="copseyrev" /> Lewis Corner of the same publication concluded: "'What You Want' proved... the band's melodious rock sensibilities remain firmly in tact".<ref name="Digital Spy" /> Tamar Anitai of MTV, Theon Weber of ''Spin'', [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] and Edna Gundersen of ''[[USA Today]]'' chose the song as an album highlight.<ref name="highlightbuzz" /><ref name="highlightspin" /><ref name="erlewine" /><ref name="usatoday50723828" /> ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'}}s Kyle Anderson also chose it as a highlight, further describing it as "fierce".<ref name="EW" /> ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}} Mikael Wood wrote that "'What You Want' rides its central riff with a bulldozer's efficiency."<ref name="latimes" /> Marc Hirsh of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' found a "metallic lurch playing off of Lee's goth-empress vocals" in the song. Hirsh went on to call the song a "strong declaration" announcing the band's comeback.<ref name="bostonglobe" />

==Music video==

===Background and development===
[[File:Brooklyn Bridge Postdlf.jpg|thumb|The music video for the song was filmed in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]] and shows several shots of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].]]

The filming of the [[music video]] for "What You Want" started on July 30, 2011 in a [[warehouse]] in  [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], and it was directed by [[Meiert Avis]].<ref name="whatyouwantvideo" /> The video featured the band's fans who played a crowd on a concert by Evanescence.<ref name="whatyouwantvideo" /> During an interview, Lee revealed that the music video for the song was one of the band's "realest" videos adding, "[...] this is more a personal video. We've done a lot in the past that [were] very 'fantasy,' and this is sort of the real us.[...] I just wanted to do something that really felt personal for a change. Obviously, I'm wearing crazy makeup, and that's not my everyday, but, you know, I want ... to connect with the fans again. We all do. We miss them. A lot of this record is about them, and that's why they're going to be here and be in it, too."<ref name="whatyouwantvideo" /> In an interview with MTV News, she described the concept of the video:

<blockquote>
"This video is sort of, like, the history of the band. This club [set] is emulating old shows we used to play in the beginning <U+2014> we used to play this club called Vino's in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock [Arkansas]]] <U+2014> it's sort of like back then, the gritty, dirty club, sweaty. And basically, it's also [about] New York, where I've been, [and] where [bassist] Tim [McCord] lived in the past few years since we've been gone. And it's sort of about escaping New York and.[...] coming back out into the world."<ref name="whatyouwantvideo" />
</blockquote>

However, before the filming of the video, the band was still finishing the album and when the time to shoot the video came, Lee didn't conceive an idea about how it should look like. As she felt the song was different for the band, Lee knew that they didn't want to "go the classic, sort of fantastic, epic [thing]."<ref name="mtv16706" /> Lee asked her sister Carrie to help her around the concept of the video. Her sister said that they should film the video for the song in New York and Lee agreed with her idea, "She just started saying things that were right on. She was like, 'This should be in New York. You guys need to do something different, this song feels different.' And she started talking about running across the Brooklyn Bridge, and it being where I live, and I was like, 'Oh my God, this is great.'"<ref name="mtv16706" /> However, the final shot of the video filmed at [[Coney Island]] was Lee's own idea. The shot represented the band coming back in the world and "heading into the unknown, coming into a new world".<ref name="mtv16706" />

===Synopsis===
The video begins with shots of several skyscrapers in New York, which are followed by scenes of the band performing in a warehouse that has been converted into a stage (similar to Vino's bar which is where the band used to regularly perform before they became popular<ref name="whatyouwantvideo" />). The crowd at the concert is seen singing along with the band. The video continually cuts the singer walking through Brooklyn in a dark dress and makeup. She walks through a train station, streets and the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. During the [[bridge (music)|bridge]] of the song, Lee runs through the Brooklyn Bridge and jumps on the other side, landing on her feet. At the end of the video, the band meet up and walk to the beach where they walk into the sea. The final shot shows the band walking in the sea as the video fades out.

===Release and reception===
A twenty-two second teaser of the video was released on September 9, 2011. The video for the song officially premiered online on September 13, 2011<ref name="mtv1670632" /> and it was made available for digital download on the iTunes Store the same day.<ref name="itunesdownload" /> James Montgomery from MTV News, said that the video was a departure for the band "eschewing the dark fantasy worlds they've created in previous videos in favor of good old-fashioned realism: the blood, sweat and tears that not only took them to the top, but have fueled their current comeback, too."<ref name="whatyouwantvideo" /> Later, he added that the video "recalls the halcyon days of big-ticket rock videos" and some "claustrophobic, cathartic performance footage."<ref name="mtv1670632" /> He called it "a true band clip; it's artfully autobiographical and, perhaps most notably, features all of Evanescence."<ref name="mtv1670632" /> ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'}}s Grady Smith, called the video "heavy goth-rock head-banger" and added that the shots of Lee falling from the bridge were similar to the music video for "[[Bring Me to Life]]" (2003).<ref name="ewvideo" /> 

Melinda Newman of the website HitFix compared the video with the movies ''[[The Crow (film)|The Crow]]'' (1994) and ''[[Run Lola Run]]'' (1998). She further praised the lighting, the photographs and the mood which according to her, were "perfection, especially the city scapes at night and the intense looks on the fans faces, as they are enraptured by Lee. It's a big budget shoot, the kind we don't see that much of anymore."<ref name="hitfix" /> Jason Lipshutz of the magazine ''Billboard'' praised the video with its "crystal-clear" shots of the concert and the "hazy" shots of Lee running through New York.<ref name="billvideo" /> Nicole James of MTV Buzzyworthy simply said "rock videos + themes = the only kind of math I like" referring to the music video for "What You Want".<ref name="goodbuzz" /> A more negative review of the video was given by Laurie Tuffrey of ''NME'' who called the video "uninspiring".<ref name="nmereview" /> He further found [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] effects and concluded that Lee was "looking for some love to infect" while running through Brooklyn streets.<ref name="nmereview" />

==Live performances==
[[File:Evanescence Tour 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Amy Lee performing "What You Want" in Costa Rica during the [[Evanescence Tour]] on October 30, 2012.]]

They later added the song to the [[set list]] on their third worldwide tour in support of ''Evanescence'', titled Evanescence Tour.<ref name="3rdtour" /><ref name="tour ny" /> While reviewing a concert by the band, Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that Lee sounded "pristine and powerful" during the chorus of the song. He further praised Tim McCord's bass and Terry Balsamo's guitar, "volleying with Troy McLawhorn as Evanescene's methodical metallic theatrics hypnotized."<ref name="art9256008" /> He concluded that the song "proved to be an undeniable anthem echoed throughout the room by every voice present."<ref name="art9256008" /> Evanescence performed the song during their concert at the [[Rock in Rio|2011 Rock in Rio]] festival on October 2, 2011.<ref name="rockinrio" />
