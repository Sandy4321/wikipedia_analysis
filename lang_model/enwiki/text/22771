"'''Ave Maria'''" is a song by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] recording artist [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] from her third studio album ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). [[Amanda Ghost]], [[Ian Dench]] and [[Makeba Riddick]] wrote the song in collaboration with its producers Knowles and production duo [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]]. As stated by Ghost, "Ave Maria" was inspired by Knowles{{'}} and her own respective marriages. The song is a re-write of [[Franz Schubert]]'s "[[Hail Mary|Ave Maria]]". It is instrumentally complete with a [[piano]] and [[String instrument|strings]]. Throughout the [[Ballad (music)|ballad]], Knowles sings in a lower [[Register (music)|register]]. Lyrically, it speaks about being surrounded by friends but still feeling alone. 

Critical reception towards the song was mixed. Many contemporary critics praised its balladry and Knowles{{'}} vocals while others dubbed it as merely a normal take on the original. Following the release of ''I Am... Sasha Fierce'', "Ave Maria" debuted on the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 150 on November 29, 2008, based on downloads alone. The song was a part Knowles' [[set list]] during her [[I Am... Tour]] (2009-10) where she sang it dressed in a wedding dress and veil. "Ave Maria" was subsequently included on her live album, ''[[I Am... World Tour]]'' (2010). She performed the song during the [[BET Awards|2009 BET Awards]].

<blockquote>
[T]he lyric is very much about her. She talks about being surrounded by friends but she's alone: 'How can the silence seem so loud?' and then 'There's only us when the lights go down'. I think that's probably the most personal line on the whole album about her and Jay, because they are very real, and they're very much in love, and it must be pretty tough to have that love when you're incredibly famous.<ref name="Ave Maria"/>
