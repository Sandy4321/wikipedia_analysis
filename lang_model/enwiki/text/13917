'''Alaina Marie Beaton''' (born October 1, 1985), better known by her [[stage name]] '''Porcelain Black''', is an American [[industrial pop]] [[singer-songwriter]]. At eighteen, she embarked on her music career as a solo act under the name '''Porcelain and the Tramps''' with [[Virgin Records]]. However, Black and Virgin could not agree on the music she would record. The music she recorded was posted to her [[Myspace]] account, "rockcitynosebleed", where she gained millions of hits. After three years of trying to get out of the contract, she signed with [[RedOne]]'s [[Universal Republic Records|Universal Republic]] imprint late in 2009 and began working on her [[debut album]]. In 2012, she appeared on ''Best Ink'', where the name of her debut album was confirmed as ''[[Mannequin Factory]]''.

[[Porcelain Black discography|Her discography]] includes multiple music video appearances, ranging from [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]]'s "Freedom at 21" to [[Travie McCoy]]'s "[[We'll Be Alright]]". As an author, she is credited on songs performed by [[One Direction]], [[Orianthi]], [[The Used]], and [[Mexican pop music|Mexican pop singer]], [[Belinda (entertainer)|Belinda]]. As a solo act, she has released two [[Single (music)|singles]], "[[This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like]]" and "[[Naughty Naughty]]", the first featuring guest vocals from [[Lil Wayne]]. Both songs charted on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] [[Billboard charts|chart]]. After the release of her first single, Lil Wayne invited her on the second half of his [[I Am Music Tour]] as an [[opening act]]. She made her first televised appearance on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]],  performing "This is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like". Musically, she fuses [[Industrial music|industrial]] themes with [[pop music]] conventions such as [[Synthesizer|electronic synths]] and a heavy reliance upon [[Hook (music)|hooks]]. She is best known for her [[guttural vocals]] and two-toned hair. She considers her music the "love child" of [[Marilyn Manson]] and [[Britney Spears]], although her image and sound has drawn comparisons to [[Lady Gaga]], [[Joan Jett]], and [[Courtney Love]]. ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' and ''[[The Advocate]]'' dubbed her a [[gay icon]], for her attention to style and the rebellious overtones of her music.

===Porcelain and the Tramps: 2006-2009===
While on a road trip in New York, Black was approached by her first manager who told her to look for him in Los Angeles when she turned 18. Eighteen months later, Black moved to Los Angeles, found her manager and was signed to Virgin Records two weeks later.<ref name=inked/> Recording under the [[pseudonym]] Porcelain and the Tramps, Black worked with [[Tommy Henriksen]] and [[John Lowery]] in [[London]] while at Virgin.<ref name=noisecreep/> However, she and the label could not agree on the music she made. Virgin wanted Black to record pop music in the vein of [[Avril Lavigne]], despite already knowing what kind of music she made when signing her.<ref name=noisecreep/> She also faced skepticism from her collaborators who questioned her desire to mix industrial rock sounds with dance pop. Black began posting the songs she recorded on [[Myspace]], gaining upwards of 10 million views in a matter of months.<ref name=inked>{{cite web|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|title=Porcelain Black|url=http://www.inkedmag.com/features/inked-people/porcelain-black/|publisher=[[Inked (magazine)|Inked]]|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> Black co-wrote and sang backup vocals for the song "[[In Love and Death|Lunacy Fringe]]" by [[The Used]].<ref name=tweet>{{cite web|last=Black|first=Porcelain |title=Tweet by Porcelain Black|url=http://twitter.com/#!/PorcelainBlack/status/107591162973523968|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> She was approached by [[Courtney Love]] on MySpace to provide backing vocals for a solo album she was working on.

Through a mutual A&R friend, producer [[RedOne]] heard about Black and was interested in meeting her. RedOne asked to meet Black in his studio in November 2009, which led to them writing her debut single "[[This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like]]" the next day.<ref name="noisecreep"/> RedOne helped Black get out of her contract with Virgin Records and signed her to his [[Universal Republic]] imprint, [[2101 Records]]. RedOne also introduced her to a new manager, Derrick "EI" Lawrence, who also manages [[Lil Wayne]]. Wayne invited her to join him on his [[I Am Music Tour]] after meeting her.<ref name="qanda"/> She changed her name to Porcelain Black because it caused confusion to people who thought Porcelain and the Tramps was a band.<ref name=freewired/> Her stage name came from her childhood nickname, Porcelain, which was due to an extensive collection of porcelain dolls given to her by her aunt.

<blockquote>I discovered two things about Porcelain Black well worth noting. The first was that Porcelain Black's personal style is similarly as outrageous as Lady Gaga or Niki Minaj -- to the untrained eye that is. However, further research quickly reveals that there seems to be a naturalness and authenticity to her style, music and performance. Personally, I've always found there to be a slight disconnect from the way GaGa and young Ms. Minaj adorn themselves and the music they write, record and perform. But I think the number one thing that sets Porcelain Black's style apart from the other two pop-stars is there is something straight out of the gate that is aspirational about her style, especially to her growing fan base. I can already envision hordes of young girls (and my fellow gays) dying their hair to resemble Porcelain's as well as lining up to snap up H&M and Topshop inspired collections to get her vintage-goth-rock frocks and looks.<ref name=huff>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Malcom|title=Make Room, Lady Gaga And Nicki Minaj -- Meet Fashion And Music's New Love Child: Porcelain Black|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/malcolm-harris/porcelain-black_b_1005737.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

Following trends in music where women experiment with [[bisexuality]], Black said she was an "equal opportunist".<ref name=advocate/> Thematically, her music has been said to resonate with [[LGBT]] and [[adolescence]], gaining her notoriety as a [[gay icon]].<ref name=advocate/><ref name=huff/> On this subject, Black has said: 

<blockquote>"Since a lot of my music is about women's empowerment, I know a lot of strong women relate to it...Me and all the gay boys that worked at my dad's hair salon got along quite nicely. I was exposed to all kinds of people and learned at a young age that people's differences are what make them beautiful. It<U+2019>s what makes the world go round. If we weren't different, the world would be boring."<ref name=advocate/></blockquote>

===Influences===
