At three years of age, her family moved to [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]] (at the time a suburb of [[Quebec City]]).<ref name=qui>[http://www.anniegroovie.com/qui-est-annie ''Qui est Annie ?''] {{fr}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cyberleon.ca/ Cyberleon] {{fr}}</ref> Groovie would later earn a degree in [[visual arts|Plastic Arts]] and a [[Bachelor's Degree]] in Graphic Communications at [[Universit<U+00E9> Laval]], before pursuing a career as a commercial designer for [[Cossette, Inc.]] for several years in [[Montreal]], where she lived since 1994.

Adept at [[gymnastics]] and [[circus]] performance, Groovie was selected in 1997 by the [[World Circus (circus)|World Circus]] to spend three months in [[Chile]] to teach circus skills to street children; she would later go to [[Africa]] on a similar mission in 2000.

In 2003, Groovie created ''L<U+00E9>on'', a male cyclops with a shaggy hairdo; she would soon began to write a series of books for children's publisher La Courte <U+00E9>chelle surrounding him and his cycloptic friends<U+2014>Lola, his girlfriend; and Le Chat, the cat.<ref>[http://www.anniegroovie.com/leon-et-ses-amis ''L<U+00E9>on et ses amis''] {{fr}}</ref> The format of these books were part-comic book, part children's book,<ref name=TFO>[http://www2.tfo.org/Panorama/Video/4130 TFO ''Panarama'': ''Annie Groovie, une auteure qui ravit les jeunes'', December 12, 2007.] {{fr}}</ref> in which the adventures of L<U+00E9>on are drawn out in a series of adventures, jokes, riddles, games and fake advertisement parodies.<ref name=SILQ>[http://silq.ca/programmation/invites_honneur/ Salon international du livre de Qu<U+00E9>bec: ''Pr<U+00E9>sident et invit<U+00E9>s d'honneur'' (2010)] {{fr}}</ref> In 2006, she would leave her advertising career to work full-time on ''L<U+00E9>on''.<ref name=qui />
