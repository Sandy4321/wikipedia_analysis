'''Husni al-Za'im''' (1897 - 1949) ({{lang-ar|<U+062D><U+0633><U+0646><U+064A> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0632><U+0639><U+064A><U+0645>}}) was a Syrian military man and politician. Husni al-Za'im, a member of Syria's [[Kurd]]ish minority, had been an officer in the [[Turkish Army]]. After [[France]] instituted its [[colonialism|colonial]] [[mandate]] over [[Syria]] after the [[First World War]], he became an officer in the [[French Army]]. After Syria's independence he was made [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]], and led the [[Military of Syria|Syrian Army]] into war with the [[Israeli Army]] in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. The defeat of the [[Arab]] forces in that war shook Syria and undermined confidence in the country's chaotic [[parliamentary democracy]]. 

On [[April 11]], [[1949]], al-Za'im seized power in a bloodless [[coup d'<U+00EA>tat]]. Syria's [[President of Syria|President]], [[Shukri al-Kuwatli]], was briefly imprisoned, but then released into exile in [[Egypt]]. The coup was carried out with discreet backing of the [[USA|American]] embassy, and possibly assisted by the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]], although al-Za'im himself is not known to have been a member. Among the officers that assisted al-Za'ims takeover was [[Adib al-Shishakli]] and [[Sami al-Hinnawi]], both of whom would later become military leaders of the country.

Al-Za'im's takeover, the first military coup in the history of Syria, would have lasting effects, as it shattered the country's fragile and flawed democratic rule, and set off a series of increasingly violent military revolts. Two more would follow in 1949.

While his rule was relatively mild, with no executions of political opponents and few arrests of dissenters, al-Za'im quickly made enemies. His [[secularism|secular]] policies and proposals for the emancipation of women through granting them the vote and suggesting they should give up the [[Islam]]ic practice of [[veil]]ing, created a stir among [[Muslim]] religious leaders ([[Women's suffrage]] was only achieved during the third civilian administration of [[Hashim al-Atassi]], a staunch opponent of military rule). Raising taxes also aggrieved businessmen, and [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalists]] were still smouldering over his signing of a [[cease-fire]] with [[Israel]], as well as his deals with US [[oil]] companies for building the [[Trans-Arabian Pipeline]]. He made a peace overture to Israel offering to settle 300,000 Palestinian refugees in Syria, in exchange for border  modifications along the cease fire line and half of Israel's [[Lake Tiberias]].<ref>Jeffrey Sosland, ''Cooperating Rivals: The Riparian Politics of the Jordan River Basin,'' SUNY Press, 2007 p.32</ref> Settling the refugees was made conditional on sufficient outside assistance for the Syrian economy. The overture was answered very slowly by Jerusalem and not treated seriously.<ref>Elmer Berger, ''Peace for Palestine: First Lost Opportunity,''University Press of Florida, 1993 p.264 n.7</ref>

Lacking popular support, al-Za'im was overthrown after just four and a half months by his colleagues, al-Shishakli and al-Hinnawi. As al-Hinnawi took power as leader of a military junta, Husni al-Za'im was swiftly spirited away to [[Mezze prison]] in Damascus, and executed along with [[Prime Minister of Syria|Prime Minister]] [[Muhsen al-Barazi]].

==Social==

al-Za'im worked hard to abolish wearing the fez, claiming that it was outdated headwear taken from the days of the Ottoman Empire. He is credited for giving women the right to vote and run for public office in Syria. The law had been debated at the Syrian Parliament since 1920 and no leader dared push it through, except Zaim. 
Once, senior Muslim clerics demanded an audience with the president, objecting to the increasingly liberal lifestyle being promoted by Syrian women. One issue of particular concern was the mixing of men and women at the Grand Hotel in Bludan. 

Zaim said yes, granting them an audience at the same hotel. When the clerics walked in that evening, he had them seated around a dining table, then snapped at one of the waiters, <U+201C>Please prepare diner, bring the whiskey, and call in the dancing girls!<U+201D> Zaim looked back at his guests, who were horrified at his attitude, and no longer dared demand enforcement of Islamic codes. During the 137 days of his rule in Syria, however, Husni al-Zaim never executed anybody. He did have creative ways of punishing those who disobeyed him, however. When the quality of bread dropped to unacceptable levels, Zaim ordered all bakers to walk on the gravel, barefoot, until blood flowed from their feet. <ref> [http://www.fw-magazine.com/content/story-nouran-and-husni-al-zaim Farah Sudki, ''The story of Nouran and Husni al-Za'im,'' Forward Magazine, November 2008]</ref> 

==Family Man==
Husni al-Za<U+2019>im<U+2019>s wife Nouran, was the first lady of Syria from April to August 1949. The marriage took place in 1947, two years before Husni al-Zaim became President of the Republic.  In order to please his young wife, Zaim asked her 11-year old sister Kariman to live with them in Damascus. He treated her as a sister as well, and sent her to the Lycee Laique (one of the finest preparatory high schools in town). Another sister Orfan, would visit them often, and took up the habit of playing with a guard, [[Abdul Hamid Sarraj]] (the chief of security at the president<U+2019>s office who went on to become head of the intelligence bureau and minister of interior during the union years with Egypt 1958-1961).

During the incidence of al-Za'im's arrest, and when the guards came to arrest him, Zaim got dressed and said goodbye to his pregnant wife. <U+201C>Relax<U+201D> he asked her, <U+201C>I will be back soon to receive our first baby together!<U+201D> Niveen (his daughter) said, <U+201C>My mother and aunt told me that the couch they had been sitting on was riddled with bullets. Sarraj knew in advance that an attack was coming and told them to go upstairs to keep them from harm<U+2019>s way.<U+201D> 
Less than a week before the coup<U+2014>which led to the execution of Zaim and his Prime Minister Muhsen al-Barazi<U+2014>Nouran<U+2019>s cousins came to him, saying that they had confirmed intelligence information, saying that Sami al-Hinnawi (his comrade from the war of 1948) was planning to have him killed. Zaim summoned Hinnawi and directly asked, <U+201C>Sami, my brothers-in-law are telling me you want to kill me?<U+201D> Hinnawi replied, <U+201C>Impossible. How can I kill my leader and friend?<U+201D> 
After the president was arrested on August 14, Nouran and her sister were kept under house arrest for an entire week. <U+201C>No food was brought into the house<U+201D> said Niveen. A Senegalese guard tried helping them by passing his own food through the window. <ref> [http://www.fw-magazine.com/content/story-nouran-and-husni-al-zaim Farah Sudki, ''The story of Nouran and Husni al-Za'im,'' Forward Magazine, November 2008]</ref>
