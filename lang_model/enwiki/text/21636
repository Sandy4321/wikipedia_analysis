'''Telenor Arena''', sometimes referred to as '''Fornebu Arena''', is a multi-use indoor [[arena]] located at [[Fornebu]] in [[B<U+00E6>rum]], outside [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It serves primarily as a [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] for [[Norwegian Premier League]] side [[Stab<U+00E6>k Fotball]], but is also used as a [[music venue|concert venue]]. It has a capacity for 15,000 spectators for football and 23,000 for concerts, including 40 [[luxury boxes]] and [[club seating]] for 1,200. The venue has a fixed roof and [[artificial turf]]. The venue was opened ahead of the 2009 season as a replacement for [[Nadderud Stadion]]. It cost 585 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK) to built, of which NOK&nbsp;300 million was for the sports venue. It has hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]], as well as concerts for [[AC/DC]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Metallica]] and [[Andrea Bocelli]]. [[Telenor]] holds the [[naming rights]] for the venue.

==History==
===Planning===
Stab<U+00E6>k traditionally has played their home games at [[Nadderud Stadion]], a municipal [[multi-purpose stadium]] at [[Bekkestua]]. Following the club's rapid ascent from lower divisions to the top league during the first half of the 1990s, Nadderud became in need of upgrades, resulting in a new main grandstand opening in 1996.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nadderud stadion in "new look" |last=Nesb<U+00F8> |first=Knut |authorlink=Knut Nesb<U+00F8> |date=14 February 1996 |work=[[Aftenposten]] |page=15 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The stadium remained severely lacking adequate facilities for professional football, and fell short of increasing requirements from the [[Football Association of Norway]] (NFF).<ref name=utelukket>{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/sport/stab-k/reservearena-er-utelukket-for-stabek-1.5871251 |title=Reservearena er utelukket for Stab<U+00E6>k |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Johnsen |first=Lars |date=8 December 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yBf2Tapj}}</ref>

Originally, a redevelopment of Nadderud was proposed, but in 1999 the idea of building a new stadium was launched by Stab<U+00E6>k players to build an all-new venue at Fornebu, which had after the 1998 closing of [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu]] became subject to an [[urban redevelopment]] project. The initial proposal was named Blue Dream Arena, would have seating for 25,000 spectators, blue artificial turf and a [[retractable roof]].<ref name=j13>Jensen, 2008: 13</ref> Other amenities were [[movable seating]] which would also allow the stadium to both host [[athletics (sports)|athletics]] and be configured as a intimate football stadium.<ref name=hjemmearena>{{cite news |title=Fornebu blir hjemmearena fra 2004 |last=Sandven |first=Arild |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=11 May 2001 |page=41 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The idea called for [[Bruce Springsteen]] to hold a concert before the first match would be played against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].<ref name=j13 /> Several of the initial concepts of the stadium were never made. International rules disallowed blue artificial turf; instead, the flooring in the boxes were made in a blue, artificial turf-inspired material. Also the idea of having a retractable roof was discarded, both because of technical difficulties and cost issues.<ref>Jensen, 2008: 258<U+2013>59</ref>

[[File:Fornebu (luft).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Fornebu]] with Telenor Arena to the right]]
In May 2001, Oslo City Council voted to sell their properties at Forenbu to Fornebu Boligspar (FB), which again had agreements to sell a lot for the stadium to Stab<U+00E6>k.<ref name=hjemmearena /> In November 2002, [[Borgarting Court of Appeal]] concluded that [[Norr<U+00F8>nafly]] had the right to continue leasing a hangar<U+2014>located at the planned location of the venue<U+2014>until 2014.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hangar stopper Stab<U+00E6>ks stadion  |last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=17 November 2002 |page=47 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In June 2003, Stab<U+00E6>k was in financial difficulties, and investor [[Kjell Chr. Ulrichsen]] bought shares for NOK&nbsp;10 million to avoid bankruptcy; these shares had the [[option (law)|option]] to be converted to shares in the arena company.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stab<U+00E6>k har ogs<U+00E5> en rik onkel Legger 10 millioner i nytt Stab<U+00E6>k-stadion  |last=Skomakerstuen |first=Bj<U+00F8>rn |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=25 June 2003 |page=14 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Fornebu Boligspar later determined that it was more profitable to build apartments at the arena site. Negotiations started between the club, the property company and Mayor [[Odd Reinsfelt]]. In November 2003, it was announced that a compromise was reached whereby Fornebu Boligspar would give the lot free to Stab<U+00E6>k, in exchange for a lot nearby.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ordf<U+00F8>rer Odd Reinsfelt fant l<U+00F8>sningen for Stab<U+00E6>k og Fornebu Boligspar |last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=27 November 2003 |page=26 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Two weeks later the compromise was rejected by FB.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ingen enighet om Fornebu Arena  |last=Fredagsvik |first=Jarle |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=11 December 2003 |page=28 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> A new compromise was announced on 29 June 2004, whereby FB would give 50 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK) and a lot free to Stab<U+00E6>k in exchange for the commercial properties which would be part of the stadium.<ref>{{cite news |title=Enige om stadionl<U+00F8>sning p<U+00E5> Fornebu |agency=[[Aftenposten]] |date=29 June 2004 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> However, the following day the parties announced that they were not able to agree on the risk of the project, as Stab<U+00E6>k demanded that FB take the full risk in the project.<ref>{{cite news |title=Br<U+00E5>stopp for Stab<U+00E6>k p<U+00E5> Fornebu  |last=Bugge |first=Mette |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=30 June 2004 |page=21 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Instead, Stab<U+00E6>k started negotiating with [[IT Fornebu]] to take over a lot they owned. They needed a {{convert|300|ha}} lot which would have a market value of between NOK&nbsp;60 and 80 million, and Reinsfelt stated that the municipality was willing to help by "maneuver in gray areas within the margins".<!--"bevege seg i gr<U+00E5>soner innen marginene"--> The club was further pressured by NFF, who were to limit the exceptions allowed for Nadderud and other stadiums not meeting their criteria.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nytt h<U+00E5>p for Stab<U+00E6>k p<U+00E5> Fornebu |last=Thoresen |first=Thore-Erik |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=2 July 2004 |page=32 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> On 29 October, FB and Stab<U+00E6>k signed an agreement whereby Stab<U+00E6>k received a free lot and NOK&nbsp;50 million, in exchange for FB taking over the commercial properties. The condition was that the municipality allowed a more dense use of the rest of FB's area. This would require a re-regulation of the area, and Reinsfelt estimated that it would not be possible for construction to start until 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stab<U+00E6>k vant <U+2013> f<U+00E5>r dr<U+00F8>mmearenaen 					 				 |last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=30 October 2004 |page=18 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In November, UEFA changed the rules for artificial turf to state that it had to be green.

[[File:Superfinalen 2009 1.jpg|thumb|[[2009 Superfinalen]], the first official match at the arena]]
In June 2008, Stab<U+00E6>k announced they had signed an eleven-year sponsorship agreement with the telecommunications company [[Telenor]], where the latter would pay up to NOK&nbsp;115 million for the sole naming rights for the arena in addition to tickets and access to executive boxes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dagensit.no/bransje/article1431478.ece |title=Telenor betaler 115 millioner for stadion |work=Dagens IT |last=Riise |first=Kari Vartdal |date=24 June 2008 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 December 2009}}</ref> In March 2009, the retailing property was sold from [[Scandinavian Property Development]] to [[KLP Eiendom]].<ref name=handel>{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.no/eiendom/naering/article1625512.ece |title=Selger Fornebu-eiendommer |work=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=6 March 2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 December 2009}}</ref> The plans called for twenty to twenty-five football games, four to eight concerts, three to four large sports events and two other large events and conventions per year. Because of larger seating capacity, an all-seating arrangement, higher attendance and VIP facilities, Stab<U+00E6>k is able to generate three times the matchday revenue from Telenor Arena as Nadderud.<ref name=schultz>{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/ikke-skriv-historien-om-arenaen-enna-1.5787282 |title="Ikke skriv historien om arenaen enn<U+00E5>" |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Schultz |first=Einar |date=8 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yCoWHGZg}}</ref> The stadium is plagued with traffic problems on matchdays, with large crews hired to create temporary barriers to direct the crowds.

===Football versus event controversy===
In October 2009, ten individuals bought the operation company of the club and signed a 40-year lease for the use of the arena for Stab<U+00E6>k's home matches, as well as the right to use the facility for certain other activities. This contract has a revenue of NOK&nbsp;9 million per year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/naringsliv/article1771727.ece |title=10 personer overtar Stab<U+00E6>k |last=Sparre |first=Martin Riber |work=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=20 October 2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 December 2009}}</ref> In 2009, Stab<U+00E6>k Holding had a deficit of NOK&nbsp;66.1 million, while Stab<U+00E6>k Fotball lost NOK&nbsp;23.6 million.<ref name=kastetut>{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/stabek-kan-bli-kastet-ut-av-telenor-arena-1.5774178 |title=Stab<U+00E6>k kan bli kastet ut av Telenor Arena |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Johnsen |first=Morten Gisle |last2=Hagerup |first2=Mari |last3=Harnes |first3=Nils H. |last4=Bj<U+00F8>rnstad |first4=Andreas |date=4 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yBG8nJAJ}}</ref> To keep the operating company running, Ulrichsen increased the company's share capital by NOK&nbsp;73 million from late 2009 through late 2010.<ref name=selgesegut>{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/ulrichsen-vurderer-a-selge-seg-ut-1.5860917 |title=Ulrichsen vurderer <U+00E5> selge seg ut |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Johnsen |first=Morten Gisle |date=4 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yBQQXLiy}}</ref>

[[File:Telenor arena 0641.jpg|thumb|left|Training at the venue]]
On 4 November 2010, Stab<U+00E6>k Holding stated that they were near a bankruptcy, and that they intended to throw out Stab<U+00E6>k as a tenant, remove the turf and instead use the venue exclusively for events. Chair Diderik B. Schnitler in Stab<U+00E6>k Holding stated that the business model was not sustainable. The football schedule was not made until early in the year, while in the event business, bookings were common one to two years in advance. It was therefore difficult to secure lucrative events, as large parts of the year had to be held in reserve in case the venue was needed for yet-to-be scheduled matches.<ref name=kastetut /> The holding company stated that they might have to file for [[bankruptcy]]. Stab<U+00E6>k Fotball stated that they had a 40-year contract to use the venue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/ostlandssendingen/1.7366817 |title=Stab<U+00E6>k kan bli kastet ut av Telenor arena |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |last=Jenssen |first=Grethe Kielland |date=4 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yBG0uT5T}}</ref>

Stab<U+00E6>k's director of sports, [[Inge Andr<U+00E9> Olsen]], stated that returning to Nadderud was not an option, as it had too little capacity and insufficient facilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/ostlandssendingen/1.7367402 |title=<U+2013> Uaktuelt <U+00E5> g<U+00E5> tilbake til Nadderud |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |last=Haram |first=Ingrid Vestre |last2=Rismyhr |first2=Kim Peder |date=4 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yBG0uT5T}}</ref> Should Nadderud be used, it would have to be rebuilt, with new grandstands under roofs, VIP seating, a new parking house and new change room, which would cost NOK&nbsp;100 million.

On 4 December, Stab<U+00E6>k Fotball stated that they were willing to move their training, [[Norwegian Football Cup]] and [[UEFA]] matches to either Nadderud or Ullevaal, as a compromise to free up more available time in the arena.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/stabek-villig-til-a-flytte-treninger-til-nadderud-1.5860934 |title=Stab<U+00E6>k villig til <U+00E5> flytte treninger til Nadderud |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Johnsen |first=Morten Gisle |last2=Hagerup |first2=Mari |last3=Harnes |first3=Nils H. |last4=Bj<U+00F8>rnstad |first4=Andreas |date=4 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yBG8nJAJ}}</ref> This was rejected by NFF, who stated that the licensing rules required that a club's main arena be available for all league, cup and UEFA matches, and that a general exemption would not be given for the cup.<ref name=utelukket />

In mid-December, Stab<U+00E6>k Fotball started the process of a judicial registration of the right to lease the venue, which was permitted according to the contract. This would grant Stab<U+00E6>k Fotball the right to continue to lease the venue even if the holding company went bankrupt. A [[preliminary injunction]] for this was granted by [[Asker and B<U+00E6>rum District Court]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/derfor-er-arenastriden-i-retten-1.5898362 |title=Derfor er arenastriden i retten |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Olsson |first=Svein |last2=Johnsen |first2=Morten Gisle |date=22 December 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yCrROILU}}</ref>

In a 16 December statement, three Stab<U+00E6>k Fotball officials said that they suspected that Ulrichen's plan all along was to convert the venue to a pure convention center, and that the use as a football venue was a decoy to get a free lot worth up to NOK&nbsp;200 million plus grants worth NOK&nbsp;50 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/sport/stab-k/stabek-slar-kraftig-tilbake-mot-arena-eier-1.5893323 |title=Stab<U+00E6>k sl<U+00E5>r kraftig tilbake mot Arena-eier |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Holmlund |first=Bj<U+00F8>rnar |date=16 December 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yBPqKqTj}}</ref> The book value of the venue was NOK&nbsp;303 million at the end of 2010, although a statement from the district court stated that the value of the venue was significantly lower than that.

On 7 January 2011, the parts announced that they had reached a compromise. Stab<U+00E6>k would remain at Telenor Arena for at least the 2011 season. In addition, the club held an option to take over the responsibility for events at the venue. Stab<U+00E6>k Fotball had until 30 June to accept the option, which would allow the club to remain at the venue on a permanent basis. This would require them to invest NOK&nbsp;20 million in an event administration, which would increase event revenue, but at the same time move the risk from Stab<U+00E6>k Holding to Stab<U+00E6>k Fotball. If the club declined the option, they would not be allowed to play at the venue from the 2012 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/stabek-far-spille-pa-telenor-arena-1.5940071 |title=Stab<U+00E6>k f<U+00E5>r spille p<U+00E5> Telenor Arena |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Johnsen |first=Morten Gisle |date=7 January 2011 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yBPQBlcj}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/ostlandssendingen/1.7453992 |title=Stab<U+00E6>k blir p<U+00E5> Telenor Arena i 2011 |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |last=Jenssen |first=Grethe Kielland |last2=Rismyhr |first2=Kim Peder |date=7 January 2011 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yBPVtCh7}}</ref>

==Facilities==
[[File:Telenor Arena bench.jpg|thumb|A film crew at a match]]
The venue is located at Fornebu, a peninsula in B<U+00E6>rum, located {{convert|10|km|sp=us}} from the city center of [[Oslo]]. The venue is owned and operated by Fornebu Arena AS, which is again owned by Stab<U+00E6>k Holding, which also owns Stab<U+00E6>k Fotball. [[Telenor]], Norway's largest [[telecommunications company]], holds the [[naming rights]] for the stadium. The venue has seating for 15,000 spectators for football, and 23,000 for concerts.

==Transport==
[[Ruter]] bus 31 is a high-frequent service which runs from the city center via [[Lysaker Station]] to Fornebu. During regular schedule it stops just outside the stadium; however on matchdays it stops further away because of traffic. Lysaker Station is served by both the [[Oslo Commuter Rail]] and selected intercity and regional trains. Dedicated football buses are operated by Ruter to Stab<U+00E6>k home games. There are 1,500 parking spaces immediately near the venue, although additional parking is available at [[IT Fornebu]] and at Lysaker, which are a seven and fifteen minute walk away, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telenorarena.no/en/index.php?l1=78&l2=96&pageID=30 |title=How to get here |publisher=Telenor Arena |accessdate=19 April 2011 |archivedate=19 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5y3dr1SQJ}}</ref> The [[Fornebu Line]] is under planning, and would be built either as a [[light rail]] or a [[rapid transit]], which would allow rail transport from the city center of Oslo and Lysaker to the stadium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ruter.no/Global/dokumenter/dokumentvedlegg/fornebubane/Fornebu_sluttrapport_des2009.pdf |title=Fornebubanen Sluttrapport tras<U+00E9> og konsekvensutredning |publisher=[[Ruter]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=19 April 2011 |archivedate=19 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5y3e40Kkc}}</ref>
