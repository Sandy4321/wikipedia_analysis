"'''Flying the Flag (for You)'''" is a song written by [[Russ Spencer]], [[Morten Schjolin]], Andrew Hill, and Paul Tarry<ref name="eurovision_passport">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/content/view/472/281/|title=Passport of SCOOCH|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] ([[eurovision]].tv)|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> and performed by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[pop music|pop]]/[[bubblegum dance]] group [[Scooch]]. The song was entered into ''[[Making Your Mind Up (TV series)|Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up]]'' in [[2007]], the British national pre-selection competition for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], and represented the [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007|United Kingdom]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].  The song came 23rd<ref name="final_scoreboard" /> out of 24 nations competing, scoring nineteen points.

==Song information==
Scooch had reformed to hope to perform at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]], and the song was specifically written for the Contest (Eurovision rules state that the song must be an original composition.)<ref name=rules>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/addons/files/Extract_ESC2007Rules.pdf|title=Eurovision Song Contest|pages=p. 3|quote=The entries (lyrics and music) must not have been commercially released and/or publicly performed before [[1 October]] [[2006]].|accessdate=2007-05-14|format=[[PDF]]}}</ref> Russ, as the captain, opens and closes the song with captain's announcements. Natalie and Caroline sing the vocals of the song, as David offers passengers confectioneries. The lyrics are heavily based on actual experiences of flying.<ref name="flag_interpret">{{cite news|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/8602|title=19. Flag reinterpreted for UK act.|author=Barry Viniker|date=[[2007-05-08]]|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref> The song contains a liberal amount of sexual innuendo<ref name="guardian_assume">{{cite news|url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/pop/story/0,,2038168,00.html|date=[[2007-03-20]]|accessdate=2007-05-14|title=Assume crash position|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' Online}}</ref>, the most overt being "''...and '''blow''' into the mouthpiece''" and "''Would you like something to suck on upon landing, sir?''". The [[camp (style)|camp style]] was both praised and critcised - ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that the song was, in terms of Eurovision, outdated and similar to [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Buck's Fizz]]'s winning entry in [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1981|1981]]<ref name="guardian_assume" />, while [[Tim Moore (writer)|Tim Moore]] called the song "a fine song in Eurovision tradition".<ref name="bbc_worst_show">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6651815.stm|title="The worst show in living memory."|publisher=[[BBC News]]|author=[[Tim Moore (writer)|Tim  Moore]]|date=[[2007-05-13]]|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref>

==Music video==
[[Image:Flying The Flag For You Music Video.jpg|The beginning of the music video: "''This is your captain speaking; I<U+2019>d like to welcome you aboard this Eurovision flight.''"|thumb|left]]
The original [[music video]] was just their final performance on ''[[Making Your Mind Up (TV series)|Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up]]'', however [[Scooch]] recorded a new version once their contract with [[Warner Bros.]] had been signed.

Conforming to the lyrics, the second video starts with the quartet in the front of the aeroplane, with [[Russ Spencer|Russ]] as the captain. The video continues with all of the members as stewards walking up and down the plane, with a cameo appearance from [[Sister Mary McArthur]], who was invited to take part after the band saw her [[lip sync]] video. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/8332|title=Scooch: The new video... & that nun again.|date=[[2007-04-27]]|accessdate=2007-05-12|author=Barry Viniker}}</ref>.

Later in the video each member of the band is seen dancing in front of the flags of selected countries that are all participating in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]], in addition to the [[European Union]] flag.

"Flying the Flag (for You)" was the nineteenth song to be sung during the Eurovision Song Contest.<ref name="running_order">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/content/view/546/282/|title=Eurovision Song Contest Final Participants (in running order)|accessdate=2007-05-13|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] ([[eurovision]].tv)}}</ref>. The song scored only nineteen points: twelve from [[Malta]], and seven from [[Ireland]]<ref name="final_scoreboard" />, two nations [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest#Regional block voting|known for awarding points to the United Kingdom]] - although [[Malta]] voted twelve in protest to regional block voting which had made the Contest "not about the songs any more"<ref name="bbc_malta_slate">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6654719.stm|title=Malta slates Eurovision's voting|date=[[2007-05-13]]|accessdate=2007-05-14|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>, an opinion shared by "five or six other countries". Due to the low score that Scooch had received (in fact, only [[Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007|Ireland]] scored lower<ref name="final_scoreboard" />), the song received negative press by [[newspaper]]s - in particular, ''[[The Sunday Mirror]]'' commented that the song made the United Kingdom "the laughing stock of Europe"<ref name="bbc_bemoan">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6651515.stm|title=Papers bemoan UK Eurovision score|date=[[2007-05-13]]|accessdate=2007-05-13|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>, while ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' referred to the song as a "crash landing" (rather than a disaster).<ref name="bbc_bemoan" /><ref name="times_nosedive">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article1782856.ece|title=UK's Scooch nosedive at Eurovision|author=Brendan Bourne|date=[[2007-05-13]]|accessdate=2007-05-13|publisher=[[The Times Online]]}}</ref>
