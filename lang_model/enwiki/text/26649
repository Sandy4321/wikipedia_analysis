'''State Route 403''' (SR&nbsp;403, now known as the Altoona<U+2013>Pillar Rock Road<ref name="map"/>) was a state highway in [[Wahkiakum County, Washington|Wahkiakum County]], in the U.S. state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. It extended {{convert|10.45|mi|km|2}} from [[Pillar Rock (Washington)|Pillar Rock]] northwest to [[Washington State Route 4|SR&nbsp;4]] in [[Rosburg, Washington|Rosburg]]. The route served as a connector to Pillar Rock. The highway formerly was [[Secondary State Highway 12C]] (SSH&nbsp;12C) from 1943 until 1964, which ran from Pillar Rock to Rosburg. Later, in 1991, SR&nbsp;403 was removed from the state highway system.

When the [[Primary State Highways (Washington)|Primary and Secondary Highways]] were formed in 1937, the former route of SR&nbsp;403 became [[Secondary State Highway 12C]] (SSH&nbsp;12C).<ref name="1937-law">{{cite book |author=Washington State Legislature |title=Session Laws of the State of Washington |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dcQ4AAAAIAAJ&q=%22ESTABLISHMENT+OF+PRIMARY+STATE+HIGHWAYS.%22+pacific&pgis=1#search |accessdate=2008-11-29 |edition=1937 edition |series=Session Laws of the State of Washington |year=1937 |publisher=Washington State Legislature |location=Olympia, Washington |chapter=207}}</ref> SSH&nbsp;12C became SR&nbsp;403 in 1964 during the [[1964 highway renumbering (Washington)|1964 highway renumbering]], in which the [[Washington State Department of Transportation]] (WSDOT) replaced the previous system of [[Primary State Highways (Washington)|Primary and Secondary Highways]] with a new system called [[State highways in Washington|State Routes]], which is still in use today.<ref name="sr1">{{cite web |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/6836215D-E301-43F3-895A-472BD2FDE86A/0/Identification.pdf |title=Identification of State Highways, Part 1 |author=C.
