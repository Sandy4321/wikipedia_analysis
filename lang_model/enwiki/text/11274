Shishupal was the king of Mahabharata period.

Chanderi is located strategically on the borders of [[Malwa]] and [[Bundelkhand]].

Consequently, Chanderi became an important military outpost.

Dominating the skyline of this lovely old town is a vast [[Mughal]] fort known as '''[[Chanderi fort]]'''. Its main gate is known as the "Khooni Darwaza". Chanderi fort is situated on a hill 71 meter above the town. The fortification walls were constructed mainly by the Muslim rulers of Chanderi. To the southwest of the fort there is a curious gateway called katti-ghatti made through a hill side.

Chanderi is famous for its hand-woven Chanderi [[saree]]s. It is a renowned centre for traditional weavers of saree. The Chanderi sarees have sophistication hard to match.The Chanderi saree is a common name in middle & rich societies and is in high demand everywhere.

At a distance of 19 km from present Chanderi town is situated the Buddhi (old) Chanderi. Buddhi Chanderi is situated on the banks of Urvashi river. It is believed that the Chaidnagar mentioned in Puranas is same as Buddhi Chanderi.There is a myth that when Raja [[Nala]] left [[Damayanti]] asleep in the forests of [[Narwar]] she moved through dense forests and reached Chaidnagar protecting her self from wild animals. The route through [[forest]]s from [[Narwar]] to Chanderi is very short. A number of 9th and 10th century Jain temples are there in Buddhi Chanderi attracting thousands of Jain pilgrims from all over the country.

Chanderi is mentioned by the Persian scholar [[Alberuni]] in [[1030]]. [[Ghiyas ud din Balban]] captured the city in [[1251]] for [[Nasir ud din Mahmud]], [[Sultan of Delhi]]. Sultan [[Mahmud I Khilji]] of [[Malwa]] captured the city in [[1438]] after a siege of several months. In 1520 [[Rana Sangha]] of [[Mewar]] captured the city, and gave it to Medini Rai, a rebellious minister of Sultan Mahmud II of Malwa. The Mughal Emperor [[Babur]] captured the city from Medini Rai, and in [[1540]] it was captured by [[Sher Shah Suri]], and added to the governorship of Shujaat Khan. The Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] made the city a ''sarkar'' in the ''subah'' of Malwa. The [[Bundela]] [[Rajput]]s captured the city in [[1586]], and it was held by Ram Sab, a son of Raja Madhukar of [[Orchha]]. In 1680 Devi Singh Bundela was made governor of the city, and Chanderi remained in the hands of his family until it was annexed in [[1811]] by [[Jean Baptiste Filose]] for the [[Maratha]] ruler [[Daulat Rao Sindhia]] of [[Gwalior state|Gwalior]]. The city was transferred to the [[British India|British]] in [[1844]]. The British lost control of the city during the [[Revolt of 1857]], and the city was recaptured by Sir [[Hugh Henry Rose, 1st Baron Strathnairn|Hugh Rose]] on [[February 14]] [[1858]]. The city was transferred back to the Sindhias of Gwalior in [[1861]], and became part of [[Isagarh District]] of Gwalior state. After India's independence in [[1947]], Gwalior became part of the new state of [[Madhya Bharat]], which was merged into Madhya Pradesh on [[November 1]], [[1956]].
