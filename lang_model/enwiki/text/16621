The '''Battle of Unsan''', also known as the '''Battle of Yunshan''' ({{zh|s=<U+4E91><U+5C71><U+6218><U+6597>|p=Y<U+00FA>n Sh<U+0101>n Zh<U+00E0>n D<U+00F2>u}}), was a series of engagements of the [[Korean War]] that took place from October 25 to November 4, 1950 near [[Unsan]], [[North Pyongan]] province in present-day [[North Korea]]. As part of the Chinese First Phase Campaign, the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[People's Volunteer Army]] made repeated attacks against the [[1st Infantry Division (South Korea)|Republic of Korea 1st Infantry Division]] near [[Unsan]] beginning on October 25, in an attempt to take advancing [[United Nations]] forces by surprise. In an accidental first encounter with the [[United States]] military during the Korean War,<ref name=ryan127>{{harvnb|Ryan|Finkelstein|McDevitt|2003|p=127}}.</ref> the Chinese [[39th Army (People's Republic of China)|39th Corps]] attacked the unprepared [[US Army]]'s [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th Cavalry Regiment]] in Unsan on November 1, resulting in one of the most devastating US losses of the Korean War.

==Background==
By October 1950, the [[United Nations]] (UN) forces had successfully broken out of the [[Battle of the Pusan Perimeter|Pusan Perimeter]] in the extreme south of Korea and begun an aggressive northward advance towards the Sino-Korean border, chasing the now defeated army of [[North Korea]].<ref name="brit">{{cite web | last = Millett | first = Allan R. | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/322419/Korean-War | title = Korean War | date=2009 | publisher=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] | accessdate = 2009-02-04}}</ref> With the destruction of the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA), the US [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] entered [[Pyongyang]] on October 19.<ref name=alexander250>{{harvnb|Alexander|1986|p=250}}</ref> while the [[South Korea]]n troops were rushing towards the [[Yalu River]] in all directions.<ref name=roe156>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=156}}.</ref> As part of the [[Thanksgiving]] Offensive to end the war, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Frank W. Milburn]], commander of the US [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]], ordered the Republic of Korea (ROK) [[1st Infantry Division (South Korea)|1st Infantry Division]] to secure the [[Sup<U+2019>ung Dam]] on the Yalu River by advancing through the town of [[Unsan]].<ref name=kimh114>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=114}}.</ref>   

Alarmed by the rapid collapse of the KPA, China's [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] ordered the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s North East Frontier Force to be reorganized into the [[People's Volunteer Army]] (PVA) for the upcoming intervention in Korea.<ref name=roe145>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=145}}.</ref> Despite Mao's determination to save North Korea from capitulation, the Chinese military leadership expressed doubts on the ability of the Chinese army to fight against the more modernized US forces.<ref name=roe146>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=146}}.</ref> As a compromise, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a [[bridgehead]] building operation with limited offensives against only the South Korean forces while avoiding contacts with the US forces.<ref name=ryan127/><ref name=roe150>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=150}}.</ref> Under strict secrecy, the PVA entered Korea on October 15.<ref name=roe141>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=141}}.</ref>       

===Locations and terrain===

Unsan is a town in northwest Korea, and it is located {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the [[Ch'ongch'on River]] mouth on the Korean west coast.<ref name=appleman672>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=672}}.</ref> Because of the hilly terrains at the Sino-Korean Border, Unsan is one of the few access points into the Yalu River area.<ref name=appleman673>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=673}}.</ref> The town is surrounded by hills to the north, the Nammyon River to the west and the Samtan River to the east. At the south of the town, a road junction controls the road from Unsan to Ipsok while a ridge dubbed "Bugle Hill" controls the road between Unsan and Yongsan-dong. Those two roads formed the only retreat routes for the UN forces at Unsan.<ref name=alexander273>{{harvnb|Alexander|1986|p=273}}.</ref>

===Forces and strategy===

Acting on General Milburn's instruction, the ROK 1st Infantry Division advanced north on October 24 with the ROK [[6th Infantry Division (South Korea)|6th Infantry Division]] on its right and the US [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] on its left, and by the morning of October 25, the ROK 1st Infantry Division had captured Unsan.<ref name=kimh116>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=116}}.</ref> But with the UN forces spread thin across Korea, a {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} gap was left between the US 24th Division and ROK 1st Division, leaving the Korean left flank unprotected.<ref name=appleman680/>

Upon noticing the thinly held UN frontline, the Chinese decided to launch a [[pincer movement]] against the South Koreans at Unsan. As part of the First Phase Campaign, the PVA 120th Division of the [[40th Army (People's Republic of China)|40th Corps]] was at first to block and hold the ROK 1st Infantry Division at Unsan.<ref name=cmsa20>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=20}}.</ref> Simultaneously, the bulk of the 40th Corps, together with the PVA [[38th Army (People's Republic of China)|38th Corps]] and one division from the [[42nd Army (People's Republic of China)|42nd Corps]], would attack and destroy the ROK 6th and [[8th Infantry Division (South Korea)|8th Infantry Division]]s at the east of Unsan.<ref name=cmsa20>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=20}}.</ref> Finally, the PVA 39th Corps would destroy the ROK 1st Infantry Division by infiltrating the gap between US 24th Division and the ROK 1st Infantry Division west of Unsan.<ref name=cmsa20>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=20}}.</ref> Undetected by UN intelligence, the 120th Division arrived at the blocking position on October 24, with its 360th Regiment heavily fortified the hills north of Unsan.<ref name=cmsa21>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=21}}.</ref> To obscure troop movements and to prevent UN air raids, the Chinese also started several forest fires around the end of October.<ref name=appleman690>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=690}}</ref>

==Battle==

===Initial skirmish===

On October 25 at 1030, the ROK 1st Infantry Division attacked north with its 12th Regiment on the western bank of Samtan River while the 15th Regiment was trying to reach the eastern bank.<ref name=kimh116>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=116}}.</ref> But when the 15th Regiment was about to cross the river, the PVA 120th Division intercepted the South Koreans with heavy artillery fire.<ref name=kimh116_117>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=116-117}}.</ref> The South Koreans first believed the resistance to be the last remnants of the North Korean People's Army, but the perception soon changed with the capture of the first Chinese prisoner in the Korean War.<ref name=kimh117>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=117}}.</ref> The prisoner revealed that there were 10,000 Chinese soldiers waiting to join the fight north of Unsan.<ref name=kimh117/> 

Faced with the sudden appearance of the overwhelming Chinese forces, the ROK 1st Infantry Division tried to establish defensive positions by capturing the hills around Unsan.<ref name=kimh118>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=118}}.</ref> The South Koreans soon found themselves in a seesaw battle with the PVA 360th Regiment during the night of October 25.<ref name=kimh118/><ref name=cmsa22>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=22}}.</ref> The next day, the PVA 39th Corps arrived at the west of Unsan while cutting the road between Unsan and Yongsan-dong,<ref name=cmsa24>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=24}}.</ref> completely surrounding the ROK 1st Infantry Division.<ref name=kimh118/> Aided by [[airdrops]], the US 6th Medium Tank Battalion and the US 10th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group of the ROK 1st Infantry Division reopened the road on October 27.<ref name=appleman678>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=678}}.</ref> Several more attempts to advance north by the Koreans made little progress,<ref name=appleman678/> and the fighting stopped by October 28.<ref name=kimh119>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=119}}.</ref>

Despite the warnings given by [[Brigadier General]] [[Paik Sun Yup]], commander of the ROK 1st Infantry Division,<ref name=appleman678/> a general feeling of optimism about the outcome of the war prevented the warnings from being taken seriously.<ref name="Halberstan2007">{{harvnb|Halberstam|2007|p=9-44}}.</ref> With the fighting reached a stalemate at Unsan, [[General (United States)|General]] [[Walton Walker]] of the [[Eighth Army (United States)|Eighth United States Army]] ordered the US [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th Cavalry Regiment]] of the US 1st Cavalry Division to resume offensives north by relieving the ROK 12th Regiment.<ref name=kimh120>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=120}}.</ref> By the time the US 8th Cavalry Regiment reached Unsan on October 29, the ROK 11th Infantry Regiment of the ROK 1st Infantry Division was also pulling out of Unsan.<ref name=appleman681>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=681}}.</ref> At the same time, the Chinese had destroyed the ROK 6th Infantry Division on the east of Unsan.<ref name=roe168>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=168}}.</ref> Unsan had now became a northern [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] in the UN line containing only the US 8th Cavalry Regiment and the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment.<ref name=appleman680/>

===Chinese counterattack===

Still believing that the ROK 1st Infantry Division was tied up at Unsan,<ref name=ryan127/> PVA Commander [[Peng Dehuai]] gave the go ahead for the 39th Corps to destroy the Unsan garrison on November 1.<ref name=cmsa32>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=32}}.</ref> The Chinese plan called for the PVA 117th Division to attack from the northeast, the 116th Division to attack from the northwest and the 115th Division to attack from the southwest.<ref name=cmsa32/> At the same time, the US 8th Cavalry Regiment had taken up positions around the town, with its 1st Battalion defending the north of Unsan by the Samtan River, while its 2nd and 3rd Battalions defending the areas west of the Unsan by the Nammyon River.<ref name=alexander271_273>{{harvnb|Alexander|1986|p=271,273}}.</ref> The lack of UN manpower, however, created a {{convert|1|mi|m|abbr=on}} gap between the 1st and 2nd Battalions.<ref name=appleman694>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=694}}.</ref> The ROK 15th Infantry Regiment, on the other hand, had dug in northeast of the Unsan, across the river from the US 1st Battalion.<ref name=kimh120>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=120}}.</ref>

In the early afternoon of November 1, a combat patrol from the US [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th Cavalry Regiment]], rear guard of the 8th Cavalry Regiment, was intercepted by PVA 343rd Regiment of the 115th Division at Bugle Hill.<ref name=appleman691>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=691}}.</ref><ref name=cmsa32/> With the trap discovered, the Chinese immediately launched their attacks at 0500.<ref name=cmsa33>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=33}}.</ref><ref name=appleman692>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=692}}.</ref> Aided with rocket artillery support,<ref name=cmsa33/><ref name=appleman692/> the 117th Division attacked the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment in full force while four Chinese battalions from the 116th Division struck the gap between the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the US 8th Cavalry Regiment.<ref name=cmsa33/><ref name=appleman694>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=694}}.</ref> By 1100, the heavy fighting destroyed the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment while the US 1st and 2nd Battalions were running out of ammunition.<ref name=appleman694_695>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=694-695}}.</ref> As the UN forces began to buckle around Unsan, General Milburn finally ordered the garrison to withdraw after learning the destruction of the ROK 6th Infantry Division on the right flank.<ref name=appleman695>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=695}}.</ref> 

Before the withdrawal could be carried out, however, the PVA 347th Regiment of the 116th Division had already entered the town of Unsan through the gap between the American battalions.<ref name=cmsa33/> Soon afterwards, several road blocks appeared behind the US 1st and 2nd Battalions.<ref name=appleman696_697>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=696-697}}.</ref> With the attacks gaining momentum, the PVA 348th Regiment of the 116th Division advanced southward from Unsan,<ref name=cmsa34>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=34}}.</ref> ambushing the UN forces at the road junction by 0230.<ref name=appleman698_700>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=698-700}}.</ref> With all the roads blocked, the US 8th Cavalry Regiment's 1st and 2nd Battalions had to escape by infiltrating the Chinese lines in small groups,<ref name=alexander276>{{harvnb|Alexander|1986|p=276}}.</ref> abandoning most of their vehicles and heavy weapons along the way.<ref name=appleman700>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=700}}.</ref> The surviving US and ROK soldiers reached UN line by November 2.<ref name=appleman700/>  

While the US 8th Cavalry Regiment's 1st and 2nd Battalions were under heavy attack, its 3rd Battalion was left alone for most of the night.<ref name=appleman701>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=701}}.</ref> But by 0300, a company of Chinese [[commando]]s from the 116th Division managed to infiltrate the battalion command post disguised as ROK soldiers.<ref name=mahoney78>{{harvnb|Mahoney|2001|p=78}}.</ref><ref name=appleman702>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=702}}.</ref> The following surprise attack set many vehicles on fire while causing numerous casualties among the Americans,<ref name=mahoney78-79>{{harvnb|Mahoney|2001|p=78-79}}.</ref> most of whom were still sleeping.<ref name=appleman702/> By the time the confusing fighting had ended, the 3rd Battalion was squeezed into a {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide perimeter by the PVA 345th Regiment of the 115th Division.<ref name=cmsa34/><ref name=appleman704>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=704}}.</ref> The US 5th Cavalry Regiment made repeated attempts to rescue the 3rd Battalion by attacking the PVA 343rd Regiment at Bugle Hill,<ref name=cmsa35>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=35}}.</ref> but after suffering 530 casualties, the 5th Cavalry was forced to withdraw under orders from Major General [[Hobart Gay]], commander of the US 1st Cavalry Division.<ref name=appleman704>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=704}}.</ref> The trapped 3rd Battalion endured days of constant attacks, and the surviving soldiers managed to break out of the perimeter by November 4.<ref name=appleman707_708>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=707-708}}.</ref> By the end of the battle, less than 200 survivors from the 3rd Battalion managed to return to the UN line.<ref name=appleman708>{{harvnb|Appleman|1992|p=708}}.</ref>

==Aftermath==

Immediately after the success at Unsan, the rest of the Chinese forces advanced across the UN lines, intending to push the UN forces back across the Ch'ongch'on River and into Pyongyang.<ref name=roe176>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=176}}.</ref> But food and ammunition shortages soon forced the Chinese to disengage on November 5, thus ending the Chinese First Phase Campaign.<ref name=roe176/> Besides the victory at Unsan, the Chinese First Phase Campaign also destroyed the ROK 6th Infantry Division and one regiment from the ROK 8th Infantry Division at the [[Battle of Onjong]].<ref name=roe168>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=168}}.</ref><ref name=alexander288>{{harvnb|Alexander|1986|p=288}}.</ref> In return, the Chinese had suffered 10,700 casualties by the end of the campaign.<ref name=cmsa44>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=44}}.</ref> The Battle of Unsan has been considered to be one of the most devastating US losses of the Korean War.<ref>{{cite web |last= Przybyciel|first= Nick|title= The Battle of Unsan|url= http://www.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123012446|date= 3 March 2005|publisher= Air Force Reserve Command|accessdate=7 September 2009}}</ref>

The Chinese victory at Unsan was as much of a surprise to the Chinese leadership as it was to the UN forces.<ref name=roe229>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=229}}.</ref> The accidental encounter between the Chinese and US forces at Unsan eased the fear of the Chinese leadership about intervening in Korea,<ref name=roe230>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=230}}.</ref> while the performance of the US 1st Cavalry Division was studied in great detail by Chinese commanders.<ref name=ryan127/> For the UN forces, on the other hand, despite the heavy losses suffered by the US Eighth Army at Unsan, the unexpected Chinese withdraw made the [[United Nations Command]] to believe that China did not intervene in Korea on a large scale.<ref name=roe207>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=207}}.</ref> PVA Commander Peng Dehuai incorporated the lessons from Unsan for the upcoming Second Phase Campaign,<ref name=roe233>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=233}}.</ref> while General [[Douglas MacArthur]] launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive under the assumption that only a weak Chinese force was present in Korea,<ref name=roe224>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=224}}.</ref> resulting in the decisive battles at the [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River|Ch'ongch'on River]] and the [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir|Chosin Reservoir]].<ref name=alexander312_313>{{harvnb|Alexander|1986|p=312, 313}}.</ref>
