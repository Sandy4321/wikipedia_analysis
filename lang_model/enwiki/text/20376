'''Ernest Radcliffe Bond''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Queen's Police Medal|QPM]], (1 March 1919&nbsp;<U+2013> 20 November 2003), also called '''Commander X''', was a British soldier, and later policeman famous for his service in the [[Metropolitan Police Service]]. He married the 23-year-old Mabel Laming at 16, and they remained together until Mabel's death in 1992.

Bond experienced the [[Fraud Squad]], the [[Flying Squad]], the [[Murder Investigation Team|Murder Squad]], and became the first commander of the newly formed [[Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch|Bomb Squad]] (later the Anti-Terrorist Branch, now merged into [[Counter Terrorism Command]]). His notable achievements in the bomb squad were negotiating the rise of [[The Angry Brigade]], eventually jailing several members. The other major event he negotiated as commander with the Bomb Squad was the [[Balcombe Street siege]], in which two people were taken hostage by four [[Irish Republican Army]] terrorists, who demanded a plane to the [[Republic of Ireland]]. Bond, answering the demands, refused saying that the police "are not going to make any deals". The gunmen surrendered, the event a success for police with no casualties on either side.
