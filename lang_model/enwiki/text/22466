'''''Lokis''''' is a 1869 [[Prosper M<U+00E9>rim<U+00E9>e]] horror fantasy novel.

It was one of the last stories by M<U+00E9>rim<U+00E9>e, started in July 1868 and published in the ''[[Revue des deux Mondes]]'' in September 1869.<ref name=space/>

==Plot==
It is set in rural [[Lithuania]]. The plot revolves around a young man who is suspected to be half-human half-bear, since he was born after his mother was mauled (and, as believed by peasants, raped) by a bear. The title  is a misspelling of Lithuanian ''lokys'' for "[[bear]]". As such, the plot may be classified into a [[werewolf]] theme. Through the novel, the protagonist, Michel/Lokis, manifests signs of animal-like behavior until he finally kills his bride by a bite to her throat and runs away into the forest on his wedding night. Some critics consider the tale to be an inversion of the ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' story, whereby the Beauty transfroms a man into a Beast, rather than vice versa.<ref name=space>[http://fmls.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/XXXVI/2/196 "Space, Self, and the Role of the ''Matecznik'' in M<U+00E9>rim<U+00E9>e's ''Lokis''"], Forum for Modern Language Studies 2000 XXXVI(2):196-208; doi:10.1093/fmls/XXXVI.2.196 </ref>
