The original '''Rathscaf<U+00E9>''' (council caf<U+00E9>), today named <U+201C>Deutsches Haus,<U+201D>is a monument-protected building at the <U+201C>[[Bremer Marktplatz|Marktplatz]]<U+201D> (market place) in [[Bremen]], [[Germany]]. It is part of the monument ensemble No. 1<U+2013>21.

== History ==
In the [[Middle Ages]], a municipal wine-house was situated at the corner of Bremer Marktplatz/Liebfrauenkirchhof respectively Obernstrasse. Later on, the building was redecorated with a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] gable. Up to the 17th century, the building was used as a wine warehouse. Lateron it was taken over by private persons and remodeled several times. In 1900, it was used as a lingerie store. Thereafter, it was purchased by the city and pulled down to create room for a new building. 

=== Rathscaf<U+00E9> ===
Since the building was situated in the immediate neighbourhood of the [[Town Hall of Bremen|town hall]], it was decided to invite architectural competition bids for its reconstruction from all over Germany. This competition was won by the young Bremen architect Rudolf Jacobs. In accordance with his designs, the building was reconstructed between 1909 and 1911 as a four-storeyed building with saddle roof at the <U+201E>Marktplatz<U+201D> which at that time had the name <U+201E>Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz<U+201D>. Jacobs succeeded in establishing a building that received attention by the experts. As regards urban development, the building is of importance for the Marktplatz and for the <U+201E>Unser-Lieben-Frauen-Kirchhof<U+201D> that is situated on the opposite side. 

The building which belongs to the era of the early 20th century corresponds to the homeland and to the reform architecture of protected monuments. The group of three gabled houses, a <U+201E>document of old Bremen art and culture<U+201D>, is equipped outside and inside with original components originating from rescue work, collections and acquisitions such as the outside freestone gable decorations, the [[oriel window]]s from the 18th century, the portals and, inside the building, the hallways from the 18th century. 

=== Deutsches Haus ===
The corner house which had been destroyed during [[World War II|WWII]] was rebuilt by the construction firm Paul Kossel in accordance with the plans of the architect Herbert Anker, as a true copy of the original. The previous Rathscaf<U+00E9> received the name of <U+201E>Deutsches Haus<U+201D> after the reconstruction. Destruction and reconstruction are the central theme of [[sandstone]] sculptures. The interior was changed more significantly in 1956. Only in the corner house to the Hakenstrasse, the reconstruction of a hall out of the <U+201E>St<U+00F6>vesandt-house<U+201D> at the Geeren of 1740 remained unchanged, using original staircases, doors and parapet elements with [[Acanthus (ornament)|Acanthus]] carvings. 

The rooms which previously were called <U+201E>Marktdielen<U+201D> (market hallways) were now called <U+201E>B<U+00FC>rgerstuben<U+201D> (citizens' rooms) whereas some rooms maintained the name of <U+201E>Rathsstuben<U+201D> (council rooms). The <U+201E>Deutsche Bruderhilfe<U+201D> (an organisation that distributed West German donations to the citizens of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]) had its office in the building. In 1995, the group of buildings to which the <U+201E>Haus am Markt<U+201D> belonged was completely revitalised by the Bremen architect Christian Bockholt (office BPG). The restaurant rooms in the upper floor which were no longer needed were converted, inter alia, into office floorspaces and apartments. The rooms of <U+201E>Industrie-Club Bremen e.V.<U+201D> were renewed at that time and completely modernised, once again, in 2008. The building belongs to the K<U+00F6>rber-foundation since 2007. The restaurant at the lower floor houses the restaurant <U+201E>Beck's am Markt<U+201D>. 

'''An Inscription''' in large letters
::<U+201E>Remember the brothers bearing the fate of our separation<U+201D>,
admonishing words of [[Wilhelm Kaisen]], was attached to the market side in 1955. In March 2011, the inscription was given as a loan for one year to an exhibition in the [[Haus der Geschichte]] (house of history) in [[Bonn]]. 

'''The coat of arms''' at the gable is a reproduction of an old original sculpture of the Bremen State [[Coat of arms of Bremen|Great Coat of Arms]] at the Rickmers' estate in Horn.<ref>Elmsh<U+00E4>user, Hoffmann, Manske: ''Das Rathaus und der Roland aus dem Marktplatz in Bremen'', S.&nbsp;135: ''Plan des Ratscaf<U+00E9>s mit Eintragungen von Bauteilen, Ansicht zum Markt''.

=== Reused Components of other buildings ===
The following components of other demolished houses of Bremen citizens were reused at the Rathscaf<U+00E9>: the late Renaissance front gate of about 1660 from Hakenstrasse 1 was used in 1909; at the market side, the oriel windows of the houses Tiefer No. 35 (right side) and Hinterm Sch<U+00FC>tting No. 8 (left side); the oriel of the corner house Pelzerstrasse No. 6 and Brill no. 8; the oriels of the middle house of Balgebr<U+00FC>ckstrasse No. 33; the gable of the corner house of Hakenstrasse was taken from Wachtstrasse No. 17 after the said house had been demolished in 1894.
