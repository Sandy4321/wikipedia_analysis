{{infobox tellurium}}
'''Tellurium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&nbsp;'''Te''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;52. A brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white [[metalloid]] which looks similar to [[tin]], tellurium is chemically related to [[selenium]] and [[sulfur]]. It is occasionally found in native form, as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the universe as a whole than it is on Earth. Its extreme [[abundance of the chemical elements|rarity]] in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of [[platinum]], is partly due to its high atomic number, but also due to its formation of a volatile [[hydride]] which caused the element to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.

Tellurium was discovered in [[Transylvania]], in 1782 by [[Franz-Joseph M<U+00FC>ller von Reichenstein]] in a mineral containing tellurium and [[gold]]. [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] named the new element in 1798 after the Latin word for "earth", ''tellus''. [[Gold telluride]] minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself, which is normally extracted as a by-product of [[copper]] and [[lead]] production.

Commercially, the primary use of tellurium is in [[alloy]]s, foremost in steel and copper to improve machinability. Applications in [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]] and as a [[semiconductor]] material also consume a considerable fraction of tellurium production.

Tellurium has no biological function, although fungi can incorporate it in place of sulfur and selenium into [[amino acid]]s such as [[tellurocysteine]] and [[telluromethionine]].<ref name="tellurium-fungi"/> In humans, tellurium is partly metabolized into [[dimethyl telluride]], (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Te, a gas with a [[garlic]]-like odor which is exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium toxicity or exposure.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
When [[crystal]]line, tellurium is silvery-white and when it is in pure state it has a metallic luster. It is a brittle and easily pulverized metalloid. Amorphous tellurium is found by precipitating it from a solution of tellurous or telluric [[acid]] (Te(OH)<sub>6</sub>).<ref name="lan"/> Tellurium is a [[semiconductor]] that shows a greater electrical conductivity in certain directions which depends on [[atom]]ic alignment; the conductivity increases slightly when exposed to light ([[photoconductivity]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url =http://books.google.com/?id=Ty5Ymlg_Mh0C&pg=PA89|pages = 89<U+2013>91|isbn = 978-0-8493-8912-2|chapter = Tellurium|publisher = CRC Press| title = Semiconductor materials|first = Lev Isaakovich|last = Berger|year =1997}}</ref> When in its molten state, tellurium is corrosive to copper, [[iron]] and [[stainless steel]].

===Chemical properties===
Tellurium adopts a polymeric structure, consisting of zig-zag chains of Te atoms. This gray material resists oxidation by air and is nonvolatile.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of tellurium}}
Naturally occurring tellurium has eight isotopes. Five of those isotopes, <sup>122</sup>Te, <sup>123</sup>Te, <sup>124</sup>Te, <sup>125</sup>Te and <sup>126</sup>Te, are stable.

With an abundance in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] comparable to that of platinum, tellurium is one of the rarest stable solid elements in the Earth's crust. Its abundance is about 1&nbsp;<U+00B5>g/kg.<ref>{{Cite book|year=2002|url=http://books.google.com/?id=g1Kb-xizc1wC&pg=PA396|page=396|title=A handbook of industrial ecology|first1 = Robert U.|last1 = Ayres|first2= Leslie|last2 = Ayres|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=1-84064-506-7}}</ref> In comparison, even the rarest of the [[lanthanide]]s have crustal abundances of 500&nbsp;<U+00B5>g/kg (see [[Abundance of the chemical elements]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.28.53|title=Abundances of the Elements|year=1956|last1=Suess|first1=Hans|last2=Urey|first2=Harold|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=28|pages=53|bibcode=1956RvMP...28...53S}}</ref>

The extreme rarity of tellurium in the Earth's crust is not a reflection of its cosmic abundance, which is in fact greater than that of [[rubidium]], even though rubidium is ten thousand times more abundant in the Earth's crust. The extraordinarily low abundance of tellurium on Earth is rather thought to be due to conditions in the Earth's formation, when the stable form of certain elements, in the absence of [[oxygen]] and [[water]], was controlled by the reductive power of free [[hydrogen]]. Under this scenario, certain elements such as tellurium which form volatile [[hydride]]s were severely depleted during the formation of the Earth's crust, through evaporation of these hydrides. Tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements most depleted in the Earth's crust by this process.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Tellurium is sometimes found in its native (i.e., elemental) form, but is more often found as the tellurides of [[gold]] such as [[calaverite]] and  [[krennerite]] (two different [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s of AuTe<sub>2</sub>), [[petzite]], Ag<sub>3</sub>AuTe<sub>2</sub>, and [[sylvanite]], AgAuTe<sub>4</sub>. The city of  [[Telluride, Colorado]] was named in hope of a strike of gold telluride (which never materialized, though gold metal ore was found). Gold itself is usually found uncombined, but when found naturally as a chemical compound, it is most often combined with tellurium (a few rare non-telluride gold compounds such as the antimonide [[aurostibite]], AuSb<sub>2</sub>,  and [[bismuthide]] [[maldonite]], Au<sub>2</sub>Bi, are also known).

Although tellurium is found with gold more often than in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined with elements other than gold, as tellurides more common metals (e.g. [[melonite]], NiTe<sub>2</sub>). Natural [[tellurite]] and [[tellurate]] minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium is not in general able to replace sulfur in its minerals, due to the large difference in ion radius of sulfur and tellurium. In consequence, many common sulfide minerals contain considerable amounts of selenium, but only traces of tellurium.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter = Phase Relations in the Selenide Telluride Systems|pages =217<U+2013>256| isbn = 978-90-5410-723-1|url =http://books.google.com/?id=HUWRZecignoC&pg=PA217|publisher = Taylor & Francis|year = 1996|title = Geochemistry, mineralogy and genesis of gold deposits|first = I.

In the gold rush of 1893, diggers in [[Kalgoorlie]] discarded a pyritic material which got in their way as they searched for pure gold. The Kalgoorlie waste was thus used to fill in potholes or as part of sidewalks. Three years passed before it was realized that this waste was [[calaverite]], a telluride of gold that had not been recognized. This led to a second gold rush in 1896 which included mining the streets.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Earth: An Intimate History |last=Fortey |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Fortey |year=2004 |publisher=[[Harper Perennial]]<!-- presumably UK but not sure |location= --> |isbn=978-0-00-257011-4 |page=230}}</ref>

==History==

Tellurium ([[Latin]] ''tellus'' meaning "goddess of the earth") was discovered in the 18th century in a gold ore from the mines in [[Zlatna]], near today's city of [[Sibiu]], [[Romania]]. This ore was known as "Faczebajer wei<U+00DF>es bl<U+00E4>ttriges Golderz" (white leafy gold ore from Faczebaja, German name of Faceb<U+00E1>nya, now Fa<U+0163>a B<U+0103>ii in [[Alba County]]) or ''antimonalischer Goldkies'' (antimonic gold pyrite), and, according to [[Anton von Rupprecht]], was ''Spie<U+00DF>glask<U+00F6>nig'' (''argent molybdique''), containing native [[antimony]].<ref>v.

After a thorough investigation which lasted for three years and consisted of more than fifty tests, M<U+00FC>ller determined the [[specific gravity]] of the mineral and noted the [[radish]]-like odor of the white smoke which passed off when the new metal was heated, the red color which the metal imparts to [[sulfuric acid]], and the black precipitate which this solution gives when diluted with water. Nevertheless, he was not able to identify this metal and gave it the names ''aurum paradoxium'' and ''metallum problematicum'', as it did not show the properties predicted for the expected antimony.<ref name="Reich">{{Cite journal|last = von Reichenstein|first = F.J.M.|year = 1783|title = Versuche mit dem in der Grube Mariahilf in dem Gebirge Fazeby bey Zalathna vorkommenden vermeinten gediegenen Spiesglanzk<U+00F6>nig|journal = Physikalische Arbeiten der eintr<U+00E4>chtigen Freunde in Wien|issue = 1.Quartal|volume = 1783|pages = 63<U+2013>69}}</ref><ref name="ChiuZ"/><ref name="Weeks"/>

In 1789, another Hungarian scientist, [[P<U+00E1>l Kitaibel]], also discovered the element independently in an ore from [[Deutsch-Pilsen]] which had been regarded as argentiferous [[molybdenite]], but later he gave the credit to M<U+00FC>ller.

==Production==
The principal source of tellurium is from [[anode]] [[sludge]]s produced during the electrolytic refining of blister [[copper]].

The anode sludges contain the [[selenide]]s and tellurides of the [[noble metals]] in compounds with the formula M<sub>2</sub>Se or M<sub>2</sub>Te (M = Cu, Ag, Au). At temperatures of 500 <U+00B0>C the anode sludges are roasted with [[sodium carbonate]] under air. The metal ions are reduced to the metals, while the telluride is converted to [[sodium tellurite]].<ref name="wiberg2001"/>

==Applications==

===Metallurgy===
The largest consumer of tellurium is [[metallurgy]], where it is used in iron, copper and lead alloys.
When added to [[stainless steel]] and [[copper]] it makes these metals more machinable. It is alloyed into [[cast iron]] for promoting chill for spectroscopic purposes, as the presence of electrically conductive free graphite tends to deleteriously affect spark emission testing results. In lead it improves strength and durability and decreases the corrosive action of [[sulfuric acid]].<ref name="USGS2007Yb">{{Cite web|title = Mineral Yearbook 2007: Selenium and Tellurium|first = Micheal W.|last = George| publisher = United States geological Survey|year = 2007| url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/selenium/myb1-2007-selen.pdf}}</ref>

Humans exposed to as little as 0.01&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> or less in air exude a foul [[garlic]]-like odor known as "tellurium breath".<ref name=CRC>{{RubberBible86th}}</ref>
