'''CalCars''' (also known as '''The California Cars Initiative''') is a charitable, [[non-profit organization]] founded in 2002 to promote [[plug-in hybrid]] [[electric car|electric vehicle]]s (PHEVs) as a key to addressing oil dependence and [[global warming]] both nationally and internationally.<ref name="Apollo">{{Citation | last = Inslee, Jay; Bracken Hendricks | title = Apollo's Fire | year = 2007 | pages=36-40 | publisher = [[Island Press]], Washington, D.C. | id = ISBN 978-1-59726-175-3 }}''See Chapter 2. Reinventing the car.''</ref><ref name="Boschert">{{Citation | last = Sherry Boschert | title = Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America | year = 2006 | pages=49-66 | publisher = New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada| id = ISBN 978-0-86571-571-4}} ''See Chapter 3. Felix Flirts with Hydrogen.''</ref>  CalCars envisions millions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, charged by off-peak electricity from [[renewable energy]] sources, and with their [[internal combustion engine]]s powered by low-carbon [[alternative fuel]]s, as a way to significantly reduce [[greenhouse gases]] that come from transportation. 

CalCars works with allied organizations to build buyer demand for PHEVs in the United States and promote commercial production of plug-in hybrid vehicles by major automakers. 

CalCars engages in public education through its web site [http://www.calcars.org calcars.org]. It displays its "100+ miles per gallon" PHEVs at public and private events, shows promotional videos, and makes presentations to different audiences, including political leaders and opinion-makers. 

CalCars also promotes technology development for PHEVs by building example plug-in hybrid vehicles, and maintaining [[open hardware|open-source]] documentation of technological information about its prototypes. In its technology development, CalCars is closely linked with the work of Professor [[Andrew A. Frank|Andrew A. (Andy) Frank]] and the Team Fate design group at the [[University of California, Davis]].<ref>Dr. [[Andrew A. Frank]], Director, http://www.team-fate.net advanced hybrid vehicle research center (which has built 9 plug-in hybrid proof-of-concept vehicles), Professor, University of California at Davis; see a 2003 interview in EVWorld, [http://www.evworld.com/databases/storybuilder.cfm?storyid=504 part 1] and [http://www.evworld.com/databases/storybuilder.cfm?storyid=505 part 2] and a 2006 [http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/260.html Wall Street Journal profile].</ref>
== History ==
===First Prius-PHEV===
[[Image:Felix-car-batteries-full.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Lithium-ion battery]] pack, with cover removed, in CalCars' [[plug-in hybrid]] converted [[Toyota Prius]], which was the first [[Plug-in hybrid|PHEV]] based on the Prius and called PRIUS+.]]

CalCars built the first PRIUS+ conversion creating the first [[Plug-in hybrid|PHEV]] based on the 2004 [[Toyota Prius]].<ref name="Apollo"/><ref name="Boschert"/><ref>The PRIUS+ was CalCars first PHEV Prius, its homepage can be found at http://www.calcars.org/priusplus.html, [http://www.calcars.org/photos.html Photos], [http://www.calcars.org/calcars-photos.pdf Commercializing Plug-In Hybrids presentation (2MB PDF)]</ref>  This initial conversion was done with a lead-acid battery pack to prove the concept would work.  The build team included Ron Gremban, Felix Kramer, Marc Geller, Kevin Lyons, Andrew Lawton. Others who helped included Tom Driscoll, Michael Geller, Richard Jesch, Les Montavon, Dan Putman, Michael Schwabe, Len Tramiel, Bob Westman, Doug Widney.

== Prepayment Plan ==
CalCars  has proposed a [[Prepayment Plan]], where buyers would pay $1,000 to reserve a plug-in car and the federal government would match each payment with $9,000, all of which would go to carmakers <ref>[http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/1036.html Progress on Prepayment Plan/Battery Worry Hype]</ref>. 

==Mass Conversions ==
CalCars states that compared to crushing old vehicles, converting millions of [[Internal combustion engine|ICE]] [[PSV]]s is a winning energy-saving strategy <ref>[http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/1007.html Should We Crush Gas-Guzzlers? Or Convert Them to Plug In? An Analysis]</ref> <ref>[http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/1040.html Plug-In Endorsements: Inauguration + Senate '09 Freeedom Act]</ref> .

==Key CalCars personnel==
'''Felix Kramer''', Founder, is a marketing strategist and communicator with an entrepreneurial track record with startups; in the environmental realm, he has managed major events and run campaigns and organizations.

'''Ron Gremban''', Technology Development Lead for PRIUS+, moderator of the PRIUS+ Plug-In Hybrid Conversion Group,<ref>[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/priusplus/ PRIUS+ Plug-In Hybrid Conversion Group]</ref> and electrical and software engineer involved in sales of solar energy systems, has long experience with [[Battery electric vehicle|electric cars]] -- he helped design and drive the Caltech entry in the transcontinental 1968 Great Electric Car Race.<ref> See Ron Grembans out of date [http://www.ForSites.com/expertise.html bio].</ref>

'''Gail Slocum''', Senior Advisor, former Mayor, Menlo Park and Regulatory Attorney at Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

==Other supporting parties==
CalCars is helped and advised by the entire EV community, including many members of the [[Electric Auto Association]] and the groups working to keep the remaining electric cars on the roads instead of being "recycled".  [[Don't Crush]] succeeded as is apparent by Toyota's welcome decision<ref>Don't Crush [http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/84.html saved] a number of electric vehicles from being "recycled".</ref> to allow the cars to be purchased by their leaseholders; this group has now become [[Plug In America]].
