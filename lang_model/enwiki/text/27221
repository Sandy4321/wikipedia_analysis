He is noted for his vocal abilities and for his live performances. As a [[songwriter]], he composed many international hits, including "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", "[[Killer Queen]]", "[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]", "[[We Are the Champions]]" and "[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]".

==Biography==
===Early years===
[[Image:Fred after pub.jpg|thumb|right|Mercury (on right) with his college friends in 1964, after a lunchtime drink.]]
Freddie Mercury was born as Farrokh Bulsara on the [[Africa]]n island of [[Zanzibar]], at the time a [[British Empire|British colony]], now part of [[Tanzania]]. His parents, Bomi Bulsara{{ref label|Bulsara|a|none}} and Jer Bulsara were [[Parsis]] from [[British India]].<ref name="LindaB_2000">{{harvnb|"Linda B"|2000}}.</ref>{{ref label|Parsis|b|none}} The family had moved to Zanzibar in order for Bomi to continue his job as a middle-ranking cashier at the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|British Colonial Office]]. He had one younger sister, Kashmira.<ref name="Das_2000">{{harvnb|Das|2000}}.</ref>

Mercury was sent back to India at the age of 8 to attend [[St. Peter's Boys School|St. Peter's School]], a [[boarding school]] for boys at [[Panchgani]] near [[Bombay]] (now [[Mumbai]]). At St. Peter's, he was a bright student who excelled at sports. At school, he formed a popular school band, called [[The Hectics]], for which he played the piano. A friend from the time recalls that he "had an uncanny ability to listen to the radio and replay what he heard on piano."<ref name="O'Donnell_2005">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|2005}}.</ref> It was also at St. Peter's where he began to call himself "Freddie". Mercury remained in India for most of his childhood, living with his grandmother and aunt. He completed his education in India at [[St. Mary's (ISC) High School]] in [[Mazagaon|Mazagon]] before returning to Zanzibar.

At the age of 17, Mercury and his family were forced to flee from Zanzibar, due to the 1964 [[Zanzibar Revolution]].<ref name="Januszczak_1996">{{harvnb|Januszczak|1996}}.</ref> The family moved into a small house in [[Feltham]], [[London]]. He enrolled at Isleworth Polytechnic (now [[West Thames College]]) in West London where he studied art. He ultimately earned a Diploma in Art and Graphic Design at [[Ealing Art College]], later using these skills in order to design the [[Queen (band)#Logo|Queen crest]]. Mercury remained a British citizen for the rest of his life.

Following graduation, Mercury joined a series of bands and sold second-hand clothes in the [[Kensington Market#The Other Kensington Market|Kensington Market]] in London. He also held a job at the Heathrow airport. Friends from the time remember him as a quiet and shy young man who showed a great deal of interest in music.<ref name=student>{{harvnb|Davis|1996|p=1,10}} </ref>In 1969 he formed the band [[Ibex (band)|Ibex]], which was later renamed to Wreckage. When this band failed to take off, he joined a second band called Sour Milk Sea. However, by early 1970, this group broke up as well.<ref name="Skala_2006">{{harvnb|Skala|2006}}.</ref>

In April of 1970, Mercury joined with guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], who had previously been in a band called [[Smile (band)|Smile]]. Despite reservations from the other members, Mercury chose the name "Queen" for the new band. He later said about the band's name, "I was certainly aware of the [[gay]] connotations, but that was just one facet of it."<ref name="Highleyman_2005">{{harvnb|Highleyman|2005}}.</ref> At around this time, he also legally changed his name.

===Influences===
As a child, Mercury listened to a considerable amount of Indian music, and one of his early influences was the [[Bollywood]] [[playback singer]] [[Lata Mangeshkar]], whom he had the opportunity to see live in India.<ref name="Bret_1996_7">{{harvnb|Bret|1996|p=7}}.</ref> After moving to England, Mercury became a fan of [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[John Lennon]] and [[The Beatles]].<ref name="Davis_1996">{{harvnb|Davis|1996|p=2}}.</ref> He said of Hendrix: "Jimi Hendrix is very important. He's my idol. He sort of epitomizes, from his presentation on stage, the whole works of a rock star. There's no way you can compare him. You either have the magic or you don't. There's no way you can work up to it. There's nobody who can take his place."<ref name="Cohen_1975">{{harvnb|Cohen|1975}}.</ref> Another one of Mercury<U+2019>s favourite performers was singer and actress [[Liza Minnelli]]. He once explained: "One of my early inspirations came from [[Cabaret (movie)|Cabaret]]. I absolutely adore Liza Minnelli, she's a total wow. The way she delivers her songs-the sheer energy."<ref name=Rush>{{harvnb|Rush|1977a}} </ref>

==Career==
===Singer===
Regarded as one of the greatest singers in popular music,<ref name="Fitzpatrick_2006">{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|2006}}.</ref><ref name="Prato_notdated"><!-- should be replaced -->{{harvnb|Prato|&lt;not dated&gt;}}.</ref><ref name="BBC_2001">{{harvnb|BBC News|2001}}.</ref> Freddie Mercury possessed a very distinctive voice, including a recorded range of nearly four octaves.<ref name="D'EstiMiller_2007">{{harvnb|D'Esti Miller|2007}}.</ref><ref name="Mehar_2006">{{harvnb|Mehar|2006}}.</ref><ref name="Guazzelli_2007">{{harvnb|Guazzelli|2007}}.</ref> Although his speaking voice naturally fell in the [[baritone]] range, he delivered most songs in the [[tenor]] range. Biographer [[David Bret]] described his voice as "escalating within a few bars from a deep, throaty rock-growl to tender, vibrant tenor, then on to a high-pitched, almost perfect [[coloratura]], pure and crystalline in the upper reaches."<ref name="Bret_1996_26">{{harvnb|Bret|1996|p=26}}.</ref> On the other hand, he would often lower the highest notes during live performances. Mercury also claimed never to have had any formal training and suffered from vocal nodules.<ref name=Rush2>{{harvnb|Rush|1977b}} </ref>  [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[soprano]] [[Montserrat Caball<U+00E9>]], with whom Mercury recorded an album expressed her opinion that "the difference between Freddie and almost all the other rock stars was that he was selling the voice."<ref name="Cain_2006">{{harvnb|Cain|2006}}.</ref>

===Songwriter===
Mercury wrote ten out of the seventeen songs on Queen's ''[[Greatest Hits (Queen)|Greatest Hits]]'' album: "[[Seven Seas of Rhye]]", "[[Killer Queen]]", "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", "[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]", "[[Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy]]", "[[We Are the Champions]]", "[[Bicycle Race]]", "[[Don't Stop Me Now]]", "[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]", and "[[Play the Game]]". However, by the 1980s, all four members of the band were writing hits.

The most notable aspect of his songwriting involved the wide range of different genres that he used, which included, among other styles, [[rockabilly]], [[heavy metal]] and [[disco]]. As he explained in a 1986 interview, "I hate doing the same thing again and again. I like to see what's happening now in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things."<ref name="Wenner_2001">{{harvnb|Wenner|2001}}.</ref> Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, "Bohemian Rhapsody" is acyclic in structure and comprises dozens of [[Chord (music)|chords]].<ref name="Queen_1992">{{harvnb|Queen|1992}}.</ref><ref name="Aledort_2003">{{harvnb|Aledort|2003}}.</ref> "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", on the other hand, contains only a few chords. Despite the fact that Mercury often wrote very intricate [[harmonies]], he also claimed that he could barely read music.<ref name="Coleman_1981">{{harvnb|Coleman|1981}}.</ref> He wrote most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of different key signatures.<ref name="Queen_1992">{{harvnb|Queen|1992}}.</ref>

===Live performer===
[[Image:Queenland 198501.jpg|thumb|Freddie Mercury with a Brazilian flag during the [[Rock in Rio]] concert, 1985.]]
Mercury is noted for his live performances, which were often delivered to stadium audiences around the world. He displayed a highly theatrical style that often invoked a great deal of participation from the crowd. A writer for [[The Spectator]] described him as "a performer out to tease, shock and ultimately charm his audience with various extravagant versions of himself."<ref name="Blaikie_1996">{{harvnb|Blaikie|1996}}.</ref> [[David Bowie]], who performed at the [[Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]] and recorded the song "[[Under Pressure]]" with Queen said of Mercury, "Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest." ... "He took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once, and as they say, he was definitely a man who could hold an audience in the palm of his hand. He could always turn a clich<U+00E9> to his advantage."<ref name="Ressner_1992">{{harvnb|Ressner|1992}}.</ref>

One of Mercury's most notable performances with Queen took place at [[Live Aid]] in 1985, during which the entire stadium audience of 72,000 people clapped, sang, and swayed in unison. Queen's performance at the event has since been voted by a group of music executives as the greatest live performance in the history of rock music. The results were aired on a television program called "The World's Greatest gigs".<ref name="Minchin_2005">{{harvnb|Minchin|2005}}.</ref><ref name="BBC_2005b">{{harvnb|BBC News|2005b}}.</ref> In reviewing Live Aid in 2005, one critic wrote, "Those who compile lists of Great Rock Frontmen and award the top spots to [[Mick Jagger]], [[Robert Plant]] et al. are guilty of a terrible oversight. Freddie, as evidenced by his Dionysian Live Aid performance, was easily the most godlike of them all."<ref name="Harris_2005">{{harvnb|Harris|2005}}.</ref>

Over the course of his career, Mercury performed an estimated 700 concerts in countries around the world with Queen. A notable aspect of Queen concerts was the large scale involved.<ref name="Wenner_2001">{{harvnb|Wenner|2001}}.</ref> He once explained, "We're the [[Cecil B. DeMille]] of rock and roll, always wanting to do things bigger and better."<ref name="Wenner_2001">{{harvnb|Wenner|2001}}.</ref> The band was the first ever to play South American stadiums, breaking worldwide records for concert attendance in the [[Morumbi Stadium]] in [[Sao Paulo]] in 1981.<ref name="Bret_1996_91">{{harvnb|Bret|1996|p=91}}.</ref> In 1986, Queen was also the first to play behind the [[Iron Curtain]], when it performed to a crowd of 80,000 in [[Budapest]].<ref name="Pye_1986">{{harvnb|Pye|1986}}.</ref> Mercury's final live performance with Queen took place on August 9th, 1986 at [[Knebworth Park]] in England and drew an attendance estimated as high as 300,000.<ref name=knebworth>{{harvnb|Jones|1999}}</ref>

===Instrumentalist===
[[Image:Queen 1984 012.jpg|thumb|Freddie Mercury playing guitar during a live concert with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in [[Frankfurt]], 1984.]]

Mercury played the piano in many of Queen's most popular songs. Examples of piano-based Queen songs include "Killer Queen", "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy", "We Are the Champions", and "Don't Stop Me Now". He used concert grand pianos and, in the studio, various keyboard instruments such as organs, harpsichords and an upright piano. From 1979 onwards also he made extensive use of synthesizers in the studio. Queen guitarist [[Brian May]] claims that Mercury was unimpressed with his abilities at the piano and used the instrument less over time.<ref name="Longfellow_2006">{{harvnb|Longfellow|2006}}.</ref> Although he wrote many guitar lines, Mercury possessed only rudimentary skills on the instrument. Nevertheless, he wrote the song "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" on the guitar and often played it during live performances of the song.

===Solo career===
In addition to his work with Queen, Mercury put out two solo albums and several singles. Although his solo work was not as commercially successful as most Queen albums, the two albums and several of the solo songs debuted in the top 10 of the [[UK Album Charts]]. His first solo effort involved the contribution of a song called [[Love Kills]] to a 1984 album dedicated to the 1926 [[Fritz Lang]] film [[Metropolis]]. The song, which was produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]], debuted at the #10 position in the UK charts.<ref name="ReesCrampton_1999_809">{{harvnb|Rees|Crampton|1999|p=809}}.</ref> 

Mercury produced two solo albums, ''[[Mr. Bad Guy]]'' and ''[[Barcelona (album)|Barcelona]]'', released in 1985 and 1988, respectively. The former was a pop-oriented album that emphasized disco and dance music."Barcelona" was recorded with the opera singer [[Montserrat Caball<U+00E9>]], whom he had long admired.  Although it debuted in the top ten of the [[UK Album Charts]],<ref name="ReesCrampton_1999_809">{{harvnb|Rees|Crampton|1999|p=809}}.</ref> ''Mr. Bad Guy'' was not considered to have been a commercial success relative to most Queen albums. However, in 1993, a remix of "[[Living on My Own]]", a single from the album, reached the #1 position on the [[UK Singles Charts]].<ref name="ReesCrampton_1999_811">{{harvnb|Rees|Crampton|1999|p=811}}.</ref> The song also garnered Mercury a posthumous [[Ivor Novello Award]]. [[All Music]] critic Ed Rivadavia describes ''Mr. Bad Guy'' as "outstanding from start to finish" and expressed his view that Mercury "did a commendable job of stretching into uncharted territory."<ref name=Rivadavia_notdated">{{harvnb|Rivadavia|&lt;not dated&gt;}}.</ref> In particular, the album was heavily synthesizer-driven in a way that was not characteristic of previous Queen albums.

''Barcelona'', recorded with [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[soprano]] [[Montserrat Caball<U+00E9>]], combined elements of popular music and opera. Many critics were uncertain of what to make of the album, with one critic referring to it as "the most bizarre CD of the year."<ref name="Bradley_1992">{{harvnb|Bradley|1992}}.</ref> Caball<U+00E9>, on the other hand, considered the album to have been one of the great successes of her career. The title song from the album debuted at the #8 position in the UK charts and was a hit in Spain.<ref name="ReesCrampton_1999_810">{{harvnb|Rees|Crampton|1999|p=810}}.</ref>

In addition to the two solo albums, Mercury released several additional singles, including his own version of the hit [[The Great Pretender]] by [[The Platters]], which debuted at the #5 spot in the UK in 1987.<ref name="ReesCrampton_1999_809">{{harvnb|Rees|Crampton|1999|p=809}}.</ref> In September of 2006, a compilation album featuring Mercury<U+2019>s solo work was released in the UK in honour of what would have been his sixtieth birthday. The album debuted in the top 10 of the [[UK Album Charts]].<ref>{{harvnb|ukmusic.com|2006}} </ref>

==Personal==
In the early 1970s Mercury had a long-term relationship with a girlfriend named Mary Austin, with whom he lived for many years. However, by the mid-1970s, the singer began an affair with a male record executive at [[Elektra Records]], which ultimately resulted in the end of his relationship with Austin.<ref name="Teckman_2004_part2">{{harvnb|Teckman|2004}}, part 2.</ref> Mercury and Austin nevertheless remained close friends through the years, with Mercury often referring to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, Mercury said of Austin, "All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary (Austin), but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary, and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me. I couldn't fall in love with a man the same way as I have with Mary."<ref name="Hauptfuhrer_1977">{{harvnb|Hauptfuhrer|1977}}.</ref> He also wrote several songs about Austin, the most notable of which is "[[Love of My Life]]."<ref name="Longfellow_2006">{{harvnb|Longfellow|2006}}.</ref>

By 1980, he began to frequent [[gay bathhouse]]s and clubs in [[New York]], where he met many short-term partners.<ref name="Teckman_2004_part3">{{harvnb|Teckman|2004}}, part 3.</ref> Inspired by [[Glenn Hughes (American singer)|Glenn Hughes]] of the [[Village People]], Mercury also began to grow a [[moustache]] at around this time.<ref name="Teckman_2004_part3">{{harvnb|Teckman|2004}}, part 3.</ref> By 1985 he began another long-term relationship with a hairdresser named Jim Hutton. Hutton lived with Mercury for the last six years of his life, nursed him during his illness and was present at his bedside when he died. Hutton also claims that Mercury died wearing a wedding band that he had given him.<ref name="Hutton_1994">{{harvnb|Hutton|1994}}.</ref>

Although he cultivated a very flamboyant stage personality, several sources refer to Mercury as having been very shy in person.<ref name="Cain_2006">{{harvnb|Cain|2006}}.</ref><ref name="Das_2000">{{harvnb|Das|2006}}.</ref><ref name="O'Donnel_2005">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|2005}}.</ref> He also granted very few interviews. Mercury once said of himself: "When I'm performing I'm an extrovert, yet inside I'm a completely different man."<ref name="Myers_1991">{{harvnb|Myers|1991}}.</ref>

==Death==
According to companion Jim Hutton, Mercury was diagnosed with [[HIV]] in the spring of 1987.<ref name="Teeman_2006">{{harvnb|Teeman|2006}}.</ref> Around that time, Mercury also claimed to have tested negative for the virus in an interview.<ref name="Cain_2006">{{harvnb|Cain|2006}}.</ref> Despite the denials, British press pursued the rampant rumours over the next few years, fueled by Mercury's gaunt appearance, Queen's lack of touring and by reports from former lovers to various tabloid journals.<ref name="Bret_1996_138">{{harvnb|Bret|1996|p=138}}.</ref> Towards the end of his life, he was routinely stalked by photographers, while the daily tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' featured a series of articles claiming that he was seriously ill. 

Mercury continued to record music in the studio until the month before he died in November of 1991. During the final year of his life, Queen was at the height of its commercial success, as the album ''[[Innuendo (album)|Innuendo]]'' entered the British charts at the number one position and sold 250,000 copies in the first week alone.<ref name="Bret_1996_172">{{harvnb|Bret|1996|p=172}}.</ref>

On [[November 22]], [[1991]], Mercury called Queen's manager Jim Beach over to his Kensington home, to discuss a public statement. The next day, [[November 23]], the following announcement was made to the press on behalf of Mercury:<ref name="Bret_1996_179">{{harvnb|Bret|1996|p=179}}.</ref> 

{{Cquote|Following the enormous conjecture in the press over the last two weeks, I wish to confirm that I have been tested HIV positive and have AIDS. I felt it correct to keep this information private to date to protect the privacy of those around me. However, the time has come now for my friends and fans around the world to know the truth and I hope that everyone will join with my doctors and all those worldwide in the fight against this terrible disease. My privacy has always been very special to me and I am famous for my lack of interviews. Please understand this policy will continue.}}

A little over 24 hours after issuing the statement, Mercury died on [[November 24]], [[1991]] at the age of 45. The official cause of death was [[bronchopneumonia|bronchial]] [[pneumonia]] resulting from AIDS.<ref name="Biochannel_2007">{{harvnb|Biography Channel|2007}}.</ref> Although he had not attended religious services in years, Mercury's funeral was conducted by a [[Zoroastrian]] priest. Singer [[Elton John]] and the remaining members of Queen attended the funeral. He was [[cremated]] at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] and the whereabouts of his ashes now are unknown.

In his will, Mercury left the vast majority of his wealth including his home and recording royalties to Mary Austin and the remainder to his parents and sister. He further left <U+00A3>500,000 to his chef Joe Fanelli, <U+00A3>500,000 to his personal assistant Peter Freestone, <U+00A3>100,000 to his driver Terry Giddings, and <U+00A3>500,000 to his partner, Jim Hutton.<ref name="Wigg_2000">{{harvnb|Wigg|2000}}.</ref>
Mary Austin continues to live at Mercury's home, Logan Place, Kensington, with her family.<ref name="Wigg_2000">{{harvnb|Wigg|2000}}.</ref>

==Criticism and controversy==
===Ethnicity===

Mercury has been criticized for having kept his Indian ethnicity a secret from the public. As a journalist from [[The Times]] observed, "Freddie himself always played down his Indian origins. In the few interviews he gave, he remained deliberately unclear about them."<ref name="Januszczak_1996">{{harvnb|Januszczak|1996}}.</ref> A close friend of Mercury's further related to biographer [[David Bret]]: "[Farrokh]<!-- In the source, "Faroukh" --> Bulsara was a name he had buried. He never wanted to talk about any period in his life before he became Freddie Mercury, and everything about Freddie Mercury was a self-constructed thing."<ref name="Bret_1996_20">{{harvnb|Bret|1996|p=20}}.</ref> A very critical journalist from [[Times Online]] compared him to [[Michael Jackson]]: "He wanted to pass as a white European rock<U+2019>n<U+2019>roll star. Curiously, people are horrified that Michael Jackson should be in such denial of his ethnic origins and yet don<U+2019>t mind Mercury doing the same thing."<ref name="Landesman_2006">{{harvnb|Landesman|2006}}.</ref> 

It has been suggested that commercial considerations may have been a major reason behind Mercury's elusiveness. Bandmate [[Roger Taylor]] suggested that he downplayed his heritage because he worried that it was not "something that people would equate with rock 'n' roll".<ref name="Cain_2006">{{harvnb|Cain|2006}}.</ref> In his book ''Brimful of Asia: Negotiating Ethnicity on the UK Music Scene'', author Rehan Hyder explores the obstacles that Asian musicians may have in attaining commercial success in popular music. Hyder writes of Mercury: "His public persona made little or no reference to his ethnic origins. This public denial of his background (along with a similar refutal of his homosexuality)-reflects a man who certainly valued his privacy but can be viewed as part of a calculated and necessary career plan."<ref name="Hyder_2004_75">{{harvnb|Hyder|2004|p=75}}.</ref>

===HIV status===

Mercury has also been criticized for the fact that he hid his HIV status from the public for many years, waiting for the day before he died to admit that he had AIDS. It has been suggested that he could have raised a great deal of money and awareness by speaking truthfully and honestly about his situation and his fight against the disease.<ref name="Ressner_1992">{{harvnb|Ressner|1992}}.</ref><ref name="Sky_1992_163">{{harvnb|Sky|1992|p=163}}.</ref>

===Sexual orientation===

While some critics have suggested that Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public,<ref name="Januszczak_1996">{{harvnb|Januszczak|1996}}.</ref><ref name="Cain_2006">{{harvnb|Cain|2006}}.</ref><ref name="Landesman_2006">{{harvnb|Landesman|2006}}.</ref> other sources refer to the singer as having been "openly gay".<ref name="Fitzpatrick_2006">{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|2006}}.</ref><ref name="BBC_2006">{{harvnb|BBC News|2006}}.</ref>In fact, Mercury referred to himself as "gay" in a 1974 interview with [[NME]] magazine.<ref name="Webb_1974">{{harvnb|Webb|1974}}.</ref> On the other hand, he would often distance himself from partner Jim Hutton during public events in the 1980s.<ref name="Hutton_1994">{{harvnb|Hutton|1994}}.</ref> A writer for a gay online newspaper felt that audiences may have been overly naive about the matter: "While in many respects he was overtly queer his whole career, ('I am as gay as a daffodil, dear' being one of his most famous quotes [sic]), his sexual orientation seemed to pass over the heads of scrutinizing audiences and pundits (both gay and straight) for decades."<ref name="Urban_notdated">{{harvnb|Urban|&lt;not dated&gt;}}.</ref> John Marshall of [[Gay Times]] expressed the following opinion in 1992: "He [Mercury] was a 'scene-queen', not afraid to publicly express his gayness but unwilling to analyze or justify his lifestyle....It was as if Freddie Mercury was saying to the world, 'I am what I am. So what?' And that in itself was a statement."<ref name="Urban_notdated">{{harvnb|Urban|&nt;not dated&gt;}}</ref>

===Criticism from rock critics===
Although Queen was always successful on a commercial level, the band often received poor reviews from rock music critics in magazines such as the ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]].''<ref name="Webb_1974">{{harvnb|Webb|1974}}.</ref> In the 1970s, many of these critics embraced the newly emerging [[punk rock]] movement and felt that Queen albums were musically excessive. A journalist for ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote of the song "Bohemian Rhapsody": "Its overblown operatic tones and melodramatic tempo changes came to epitomise the style lampooned by rock critics as pomp rock."<ref name="Myers_1991">{{harvnb|Myers|1991}}.</ref> Another ''Rolling Stone'' critic expressed his opinion that many of the songs on the band's 1974 ''[[Queen II]]'' album featured "histrionic vocals, abrupt and pointless compositional complexity, and a dearth of melody."<ref name="Barnes_1974">{{harvnb|Barnes|1974}}.</ref>

===Controversies===
Mercury and Queen were widely criticized in the 1980s for the fact that they broke a [[United Nations]] cultural boycott by performing a series of shows at [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]], an entertainment complex in (then) apartheid South Africa. As a result of these shows, Queen was placed on a United Nations list of blacklisted artists and was widely criticized in magazines such as the [[NME]].<ref name="Harris_2005">{{harvnb|Harris|2005}}.</ref> 

A further controversy ensued in August 2006, when an organization calling itself the Islamic Mobilization and Propagation petitioned the Zanzibar government's culture ministry, demanding that a large-scale celebration of what would have been Mercury's sixtieth birthday be canceled. The organization issued several complaints about the planned celebrations, including that Mercury was not a true Zanzibari and that he had lived a homosexual lifestyle not in accordance with the laws of Islam, the dominant religion of the island. The organization claimed that "associating Mercury with Zanzibar degrades our island as a place of Islam."<ref name="BBC_2006">{{harvnb|BBC News|2006}}.</ref> The planned celebration was canceled.

==Legacy==
===Appearances in lists of influential individuals===
Several popularity polls conducted over the past decade indicate that Mercury's reputation may in fact have been enhanced since his death. For instance, in 2002 he appeared in the 58th spot in a list of the "[[100 Greatest Britons]]", sponsored by the [[BBC]] and voted for by the public.<ref name="BBC_2002">{{harvnb|BBC News|2002}}.</ref> He was further listed at the 52nd spot in a 2007 [[Japan]]ese national survey of the 100 most "influential heroes".<ref name="James_2007">{{harvnb|"James"|2007}}.</ref> Despite the fact that he had been criticized by gay activists for hiding his HIV status, author [[Paul Russell]] included Mercury in his book "The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present."<ref name="Russell_2002">{{harvnb|Russell|2002}}.</ref> Other entertainers on Russell's list included [[Liberace]] and [[Rock Hudson]]. In 2006, [[Time (magazine)|Time Asia]] magazine named him as one of the most influential [[Asian people|Asians]] heroes of the past 60 years: The article credited Mercury with having "duplicated in popular music what other Indians <U+2014> such as [[Salman Rushdie]] and [[Vikram Seth]] <U+2014> have done in literature: taking the colonizer's art form and representing it in a manner richer and more dazzling than many Anglophones thought possible."<ref name="Fitzpatrick_2006">{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|2006}}.</ref>

===Continued popularity===
In the UK, Queen have now spent more collective weeks on the [[UK Album Charts]] than any other musical act (including The Beatles),<ref name="BBC_2005a">{{harvnb|BBC|2005a}}.</ref> and ''Queen's Greatest Hits'' is the highest selling album of all time in the UK.<ref name="Brown_2006">{{harvnb|Brown|2006}}.</ref> Estimates of the band's total worldwide record sales to date have been set as high as 300 million.<ref name=Cota_2006">{{harvnb|Cota|2006}}.</ref> Two of Mercury's songs, "[[We Are the Champions]]" and "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", have each been voted as the greatest song of all time in major polls by [[Sony Ericsson]]<ref name="Haines_2005">{{harvnb|Haines|2005}}.</ref> and [[Guinness World Records]],<ref name="CNN_2002">{{harvnb|CNN|2002}}.</ref> respectively. The former poll was an attempt to determine the world's favourite song, while the Guinness poll took place in the UK. In October of 2007, the video for "Bohemian Rhapsody" was voted as the greatest of all time by readers of [[Q]] magazine.<ref name=video>{{harvnb|BBC News|2007}}</ref> Mercury was also voted second to [[Mariah Carey]] in MTV's 22 Greatest Voices in Music.<ref name="Fitzpatrick_2006">{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|2006}}.</ref>

The extent to which Mercury's death may have enhanced Queen's popularity is not clear. In the United States, where Queen's popularity had lagged in the 1980s, sales of Queen albums went up dramatically in 1992, the year following his death.<ref name="RIAA_2007">{{harvnb|RIAA|2007}}.</ref> In 1992 one American critic noted, "what cynics call the 'dead star' factor had come into play <U+2014> Queen is in the middle of a major resurgence."<ref name=Brown_1992">{{harvnb|Brown|1992}}.</ref> The movie [[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]], which featured "Bohemian Rhapsody," also came out in 1992.

===Tributes===
[[Image:Freddieinmontreux.jpg|thumb|400px|The statue of Freddie Mercury in [[Montreux]]]]
A [[statue]] in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]] (by sculptor [[Irena Sedlecka]]) has been erected as a tribute to Mercury. Beginning in 2003, fans from around the world gather in Switzerland on a yearly basis to pay tribute to the singer as part of the "Freddie Mercury Montreux Memorial Day" on the first weekend of September.<ref name="Bishton_2004">{{harvnb|Bishton|2004}}.</ref> A [[Royal Mail]] [[postage stamp|stamp]] was issued in honour of Mercury as part of the [[Millennium Stamp]] series. A plaque was also erected at the site of the family home in [[Feltham]] where Mercury and his family moved upon arriving in England in 1964.<ref name="WENN_2005">{{harvnb|WENN|2005}}.</ref>

===Importance in AIDS history===
Freddie Mercury's death represented an important event in the history of [[AIDS]].<ref>{{harvnb|National AIDS Trust|2006}}.</ref> In the spring of 1992, the remaining members of Queen founded [[The Mercury Phoenix Trust]] and organized ''[[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]] for AIDS Awareness''.<ref name="Stothard_1992">{{harvnb|Stothard|1992}}.</ref> [[The Mercury Phoenix Trust]] has since raised millions of pounds for various AIDS charities. The tribute concert, which took place at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] for an audience of 72,000, featured a wide variety of guests including [[Robert Plant]], [[Extreme]], [[Elton John]], [[Metallica]], [[David Bowie]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Tony Iommi]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[George Michael]], [[Def Leppard]] and [[Liza Minnelli]]. The concert was broadcast live to 76 countries and had an estimated viewing audience of 1 billion.<ref name="ABC_2007">{{harvnb|ABC Television|2007}}.</ref>
