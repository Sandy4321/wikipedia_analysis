'''Lee Krasner''' (October 27, 1908 <U+2013> June 19, 1984) was an influential American [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] painter in the second half of the 20th century. She is one of the few women artists to have had a retrospective show at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

==Early life==
Krasner was born as ''' Lena Krassner''' (outside the family she was known as '''Lenore Krasner''') on October 27, 1908 in [[Brooklyn, New York]].<ref>Brenson, Michael.

==Education==

From an early age, Krasner knew she wanted to pursue art as a career.<ref name="Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 13"/>Krasner's career as an artist began when she was a teenager.<ref name="Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 13"/> She specifically sought out enrollment at Washington Irving High School for Girls since they offered an art major.<ref name="Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 13"/> After graduating from high school, she attended The Cooper Union on a scholarship.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 14</ref> Here, she completed the course work required for a teaching certificate in art.<ref name="Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 13"/>

By 1928, she enrolled in the National Academy of Design. By attending a technical art school, Krasner was able to gain an extensive and thorough artistic education as illustrated through her knowledge of the techniques of the [[Old Masters]].<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 15</ref> She also became highly skilled in portraying anatomically correct figures.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 16</ref> There are relatively few works that survive from this time period apart from a few self-portraits and still lifes since most of the works were burned in a fire.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 15</ref> One of the images that still exists from this time period is her "Self Portrait" painted in 1930. She submitted it to the National Academy in order to enroll in a certain class, but the judges could not believe that the young artist produced a self portrait [[en plein air]].<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 15</ref> In it, she depicts herself with a defiant expression surrounded by nature. She also briefly enrolled in the [[Art Students League of New York]] in 1928.<ref>Strassfield, Christina Mossaides. "Lee Krasner: The Nature of the Body-- Works from 1933 to 1984". East Hampton: Guild Hall Museum, 1995. pg. 6</ref> Here, she took a class led by [[George Bridgman]] who emphasized the human form.<ref>Strassfield, Christina Mossaides. "Lee Krasner: The Nature of the Body-- Works from 1933 to 1984". East Hampton: Guild Hall Museum, 1995. pg. 6</ref><ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 18</ref> Krasner was highly influenced by the opening of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 1929. She was very affected by [[post-impressionism]] and grew critical of the academic notions of style she had learned at the National Academy.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 16</ref>

In the 1930s, she began studying modern art through learning the components of composition, technique, and theory.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 16</ref> This initial investigation into modern art formed her work throughout the rest of her career. She began taking classes from Han Hofmann in 1937, where he modernized her approach to the nude and still life.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 18</ref> He emphasized the two-dimensional nature of the picture plane and usage color to create spatial illusion that was not representative of reality through his lessons.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 22</ref> Throughout her classes with Hofmann, Krasner worked in an advanced style of cubism, also known as neo-cubism.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 26</ref> During the class, a human nude or a still life setting would be the model Krasner and other students would have to work from. She typically created charcoal drawings of the human models and oil on paper color studies of the still life settings.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 26</ref> She typically illustrated female nudes in a cubist manner with tension achieved through the fragmentation of forms and the opposition of light and dark colors.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. ''Lee Krasner''. New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 24</ref> The still lifes illustrated her interest in [[fauvism]] since she suspended brightly colored pigment on white backgrounds.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. ''Lee Krasner''. New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 24</ref>

It eventually became too difficult for Krasner to support herself as a waitress due to the [[Great Depression]].<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 33</ref> In order to provide for herself, she joined the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project in 1935. She worked on the mural division as an assistant to Max Spivak.<ref>Rose, Barbara. "Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 5</ref> Her job was to enlarge other artists' designs for large-scaled public murals. Since murals were created to be easily understood and appreciated by the general public, the abstract art Krasner produced was undesirable for murals.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 33</ref> While Krasner was happy to have a job, she was dissatisfied since she did not like working with figurative images created by other artists.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 33</ref> Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s, she created gouache sketches in the hopes of one day creating an abstract mural.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 34</ref> As soon as one of her proposals for a mural was approved for the WYNC radio station, the Works Progress Administration turned into War Services and all art had to be created for war propaganda.<ref>Rose, Barbara. "Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 5</ref> She continued working for War Services by creating collages for the war effort which were displayed in the windows of nineteen department stores in Brooklyn and Manhattan.<ref>Rose, Barbara.

New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 32</ref> She was very involved with the Artists Union during her employment with the WPA but was one of the first to quit the organization when she realized the communists were taking it over.<ref>Rose, Barbara. "Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 5</ref> By being part of this organization, she was able to meet more artists in New York City and enlarge her network.<ref>Kleeblatt, Norman L., and Stephen Brown. ''From the Margins: Lee Krasner|Norman Lewis, 1945 - 1952''. New York: Jewish Museum, 2014. pg. 15</ref> 

After she quit the Artists Union, she joined the American Abstract Artists.<ref>Rose, Barbara. "Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 5</ref> This marks the end of her educational career.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. "Lee Krasner". New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 27</ref> While she was a member, she typically exhibited cubist still lifes in a black-gridded [[cloisonne]] style which were highly impastoed and gestural.<ref>Rose, Barbara.

==Works==
Krasner is identified as an [[abstract expressionist]] due to her abstract, gestural, and expressive works. She worked in painting, collage painting, charcoal drawing, and occasionally mosaics. She would often cut apart her own drawings and paintings to create her collage paintings. She also commonly revised or completely destroyed an entire series of works due to her critical nature. As a result, her surviving body of work is relatively small. Her [[catalogue raisonn<U+00E9>]], published in 1995 by Abrams, lists 599 known pieces.

Her changeable nature is reflected throughout her work, which has led critics and scholars to have very different conclusions about her and her work.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. ''Lee Krasner''. New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 7</ref> Her style often goes back and forth between classic structure and baroque action, open form and hard-edge shape, and bright color and monochrome palette.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 14</ref> Throughout her career, she refused to adopt a singular, recognizable style and instead embraced change change through varying the mood, subject matter, texture, materials, and compositions of her work often.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 14</ref><ref>Hobbs, Robert. "Lee Krasner". New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 95</ref> By changing her work style often, she differed from other abstract expressionists since many of them adopted unchanging identities and modes of depiction..<ref>Hobbs, Robert. <U+201C>Lee Krasner<U+2019>s Skepticism and Her Emergent Postmodernism<U+201D>, Women<U+2019>s Art Journal, Vol. 28, No.2, (Fall-Winter 2008): 3 <U+2013> 10. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 3</ref> Despite these intense variations, her works can typically be recognized through their gestural style, texture, rhythm, and depiction of organic imagery.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 14</ref> Her interest in the self, nature, and modern life are themes which commonly surface in her works.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. ''Lee Krasner''. New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 7</ref> Krasner is often reluctant to discuss the [[iconography]] of her work and instead emphasizes the importance of her biography since she claims her art is formed through her individual personality and her emotional state.<ref>Tucker, Marcia. "Lee Krasner: Large Paintings". New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1973. pg. 12</ref>

===Early 1940s===

Throughout the first half of the 1940s, Krasner struggled with creating art that satisfied her critical nature. She was highly affected by seeing Pollock's work for the first time in 1942, causing her to reject Hofmann's cubist style which required working from a human or still life model.<ref>Rose, Barbara. "Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 5</ref><ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 50</ref> She called the work produced during this frustrating time her "grey slab paintings."<ref>Rose, Barbara. "Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 5</ref> She would create these paintings by working on a canvas for months, overpainting, scraping paint off, rubbing paint off, and adding more paint until the canvas was nearly monochrome from so much paint build up.<ref>Rose, Barbara. "Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 5</ref>  She eventually would destroy these works, which is why there is only one painting that exists from this time period.<ref>Rose, Barbara. "Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 5</ref> Krasner's extensive knowledge of cubism was the source of her creative problem since she needed her work to be more expressive and gestural to be considered contemporary and relevant.<ref>Rose, Barbara. "Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 6</ref> In the fall of 1945, Krasner destroyed many of her cubist works she created during her studies with Han Hofmann, although the majority of paintings created from 1938 to 143 survived this reevaluation.<ref>Rose, Barbara. "Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 4</ref>

===Little Images: 1946-1949===

Beginning in 1946, Krasner began working on her Little Image series. She created around forty of these types of paintings until 1949.<ref>Kleeblatt, Norman L., and Stephen Brown. ''From the Margins: Lee Krasner|Norman Lewis, 1945 - 1952''. New York: Jewish Museum, 2014. pg. 68</ref> They are commonly categorized as mosaic, webbed, or hieroglyphs depending on the style of the image.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. ''Lee Krasner''. New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg.40</ref> The mosaic images were created through the thick build up of paint while her webbed paintings were made through a drip technique in which the paintbrush was always close to the surface of the canvas.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 59</ref> Since she used a drip technique in creating her webbed images, many critics believed upon seeing this work for the first time that she copied and domesticated Pollock's chaotic paint splatters.<ref>Cheim, John. "Lee Krasner: Paintings from 1965 to 1970". New York: Robert Miller, 1991. pg.4</ref><ref>Wagner, Anne M. "Lee Krasner as L.K.", ''Representations'', No. 25 (Winter, 1989): 42-57. JSTOR. pg. 44</ref> Her hieroglyph paintings are gridded and look like an unreadable, personal script of Krasner's creation.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 59</ref> These works demonstrate her anti-figurative concerns, allover approach to the canvas, gestural brushwork, and disregard of naturalistic color.<ref>Kleeblatt, Norman L., and Stephen Brown. ''From the Margins: Lee Krasner|Norman Lewis, 1945 - 1952''. New York: Jewish Museum, 2014. pg. 14</ref> They have little variation of color but are very rich in texture due to the build up of [[impasto]] and also suggest space continuing beyond the canvas.<ref>Kleeblatt, Norman L., and Stephen Brown. ''From the Margins: Lee Krasner|Norman Lewis, 1945 - 1952''. New York: Jewish Museum, 2014. pg. 19</ref><ref>Tucker, Marcia. "Lee Krasner: Large Paintings". New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1973. pg. 9</ref>  These were her first successful images she created while working from her own imagination rather than a model.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 54</ref> The relatively small scale of the images can be attributed to the fact she painted them on an easel in her small studio space in an upstairs bedroom at The Springs.<ref>Kleeblatt, Norman L., and Stephen Brown. ''From the Margins: Lee Krasner|Norman Lewis, 1945 - 1952''. New York: Jewish Museum, 2014. pg. 19</ref><ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 59</ref> 

Many scholars interpret these images as Krasner's reworking of Hebrew script.<ref>Kleeblatt, Norman L., and Stephen Brown. ''From the Margins: Lee Krasner|Norman Lewis, 1945 - 1952''. New York: Jewish Museum, 2014. pg. 69</ref><ref>Hobbs, Robert. ''Lee Krasner''. New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg.40</ref><ref>Levin, Gail. <U+201C>Beyond the Pale: Lee Krasner and Jewish Culture<U+201D>, Women<U+2019>s Art Journal, Vol. 28, No.2 (Fall-Winter 2008): 28 <U+2013> 44. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 44.</ref> In an interview later in her career, Krasner admitted to subconsciously working from right to left on her canvases, leading scholars to believe that her Jewish background affected the rendering of her work.<ref>Kleeblatt, Norman L., and Stephen Brown. ''From the Margins: Lee Krasner|Norman Lewis, 1945 - 1952''. New York: Jewish Museum, 2014. pg. 69</ref> Some scholars have interpreted these paintings to represent Krasner's reaction to the tragedy of [[The Holocaust]].<ref>Kleeblatt, Norman L., and Stephen Brown. ''From the Margins: Lee Krasner|Norman Lewis, 1945 - 1952''. New York: Jewish Museum, 2014. pg. 19</ref><ref>Hobbs, Robert. ''Lee Krasner''. New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg.40</ref><ref>Levin, Gail. <U+201C>Beyond the Pale: Lee Krasner and Jewish Culture<U+201D>, Women<U+2019>s Art Journal, Vol. 28, No.2 (Fall-Winter 2008): 28 <U+2013> 44. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 44.</ref>  Others have claimed that her work with the War Services project caused her to be interested in text and codes since [[cryptoanalysis]] was a main concern for winning the war.<ref>Kleeblatt, Norman L., and Stephen Brown. ''From the Margins: Lee Krasner|Norman Lewis, 1945 - 1952''. New York: Jewish Museum, 2014. pg. 72</ref>

When she completed the Little Image series in 1949, Krasner again went through a critical phase with her work. She tried out and rejected many new styles and eventually destroyed most of the work she made in the early 1950s.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 62</ref> There is evidence that she began experimenting with automatic painting and created black and white hybridized, monstrous figures on large canvases in 1950.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 68</ref> These were the paintings that [[Betty Parsons]] saw when she visited The Springs that summer, causing Parsons to offer Krasner a show for the fall.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 68</ref> Between the summer and the fall, Krasner again had shifted her style to [[color field painting]] and destroyed the figurative automatic paintings she made.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 70</ref> The Betty Parsons show was the first solo exhibition Krasner displayed her works at since 1945.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 70</ref> After the exhibition, Krasner used the color field paintings to make her collage paintings.

===Early collage images: 1951-1955===

By 1951, Krasner started her first series of collage paintings. To create these images, Krasner pasted cut and torn shapes onto all but two of the large-scale color field paintings she created for the Betty Parson's exhibition in 1951.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 75</ref> This period marks the time when Krasner stopped working on an easel since she created these works by lying the support on the floor.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 82</ref> To make these images, she would pin the separate pieces to a canvas and modify the composition until she was satisfied. She then would paste the fragments on the canvas and add color with a brush when desired.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 83</ref> Most of the collage paintings she created recall plant or organic forms but do not completely resemble a living organism.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 93</ref> By using many different materials, she was able to create texture and prevent the image from being entirely flat.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 75</ref> The act of tearing and cutting elements for the collage embodies Krasner's expression since these acts are aggressive.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 79</ref> She explored contrasts of light and dark colors, hard and soft lines, organic and geometric shapes, and structure and improvisation through these collages.<ref>Haxall, Daniel. <U+201C>Collage and the Nature of Order: Lee Krasner<U+2019>s Pastoral Vision<U+201D>, Women<U+2019>s Art Journal, Vol. 28, No. 2 (Fall-Winter 2008): 20-27. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 21</ref> These collage paintings represent Krasner's turn away from nonobjective abstraction. From this period onwards, she created metaphorical and content-laden art which alludes to organic figures or landscapes.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 82</ref>

From 1951 to 1953, most of her works are made from ripped drawings completed in black ink or wash in a figurative manner.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 79</ref> By ripping the paper instead of cutting it, the edges of the figures are much more soft in comparison to the geometric and hard-edged shapes in her previous works.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 79</ref> From 1953 to 1954, she created smaller sized collage paintings that were composed of fragments of undesired works.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 80</ref> Some of the discarded works she used were splatter paintings completed by Pollock.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. ''Lee Krasner''. New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 7</ref> Many scholars have expressed different interpretations about why she used Pollock's unwanted canvases. Some assert that she simultaneously demonstrated her admiration for his art while also recontextualizing his aggressive physicality through manipulating his images into a collage format.<ref>Hobbs, Robert.

JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 27</ref> Others believe that she was creating a sense of intimacy between the two artists, which was lacking in their relationship by this time period, by combining their works together.<ref>Haxall, Daniel. <U+201C>Collage and the Nature of Order: Lee Krasner<U+2019>s Pastoral Vision<U+201D>, Women<U+2019>s Art Journal, Vol. 28, No. 2 (Fall-Winter 2008): 20-27.

===Earth Green Series: 1956-1959===

During the summer of 1956, Krasner started her Earth Green Series. While she started painting these images before Pollock's death, they are considered to reflect her feelings of anger, guilt, pain, and loss she experienced about their relationship before and after he died.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 100</ref> This intense emotion she felt during this time caused her art to develop into a more liberated form of her self-expression and pushed the boundaries of conventional, developed concepts of art.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 97</ref> Through these large-scale action paintings, she depicts hybridized figures that are made up of organic plant-like forms and anatomical parts, which often allude to both male and female body parts.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 100</ref> These forms dominate the canvas, causing it to be crowded and densely packed with bursting and bulging shapes.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 104</ref> The pain she experienced during this time is illustrated through the principal usage of flesh tones with blood-red accents in the figures which suggest wounds.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 104</ref> The paint drips on the canvas show her speed and willingness to relinquish absolute control, both necessary for portraying her emotions.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 104</ref>

By 1957, she continued to create figurative abstract forms in her work, but they suggest more floral elements rather than anatomical.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 108</ref> She used brighter colors which were more vibrant and commonly contrasted other colors in the composition.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 108</ref> She also would dilute paint or use a dry brush to make the colors more transparent.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 108</ref>

In 1958, she was commissioned to create two abstract murals for an office building on Broadway.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 117</ref> She created two collage [[maquettes]] which depicted floral motifs for two entryways of the building.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 117</ref> Later, these murals were destroyed in a fire.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 117</ref>

===Umber Series: 1959-1961===

Krasner's Umber Series paintings were created during a time period when the artist was suffering from [[insomnia]].<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 126</ref> Since she was working during the nighttime, she had to paint with artificial light rather than daylight, causing her palette to shift from bright, vibrant hues to dull, monochrome colors.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 126</ref> She also was still dealing with the death of Pollock and the recent death of her mother, which caused her to use an aggressive style when creating these images.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. ''Lee Krasner''. New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 73</ref> These mural sized action paintings contrast dark and light severely since white, grays, black, and brown are the predominant colors used.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 122</ref> Evidence of her animated brushwork can be seen through the drips and splatters of paint on the canvas.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 122</ref> There is no central spot for the viewer to focus on in these works, making the composition highly dynamic and rhythmic.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 122</ref> To paint these large-scale images, Krasner would tack the canvas to a wall.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 126</ref> These images no longer imply organic forms but instead are often interpreted as violent and turbulent landscapes.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 125</ref>

===Primary Series: 1960s===

By 1962, she begins using bright colors and allude to floral and plant-like shapes.<ref>Cheim, John. "Lee Krasner: Paintings from 1965 to 1970". New York: Robert Miller, 1991. pg. 21</ref> These works are compositionally similar to her monochrome images due to their large size and rhythmic nature with no central focal point.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 130</ref> The palette of these images often contrast one another and allude to tropical landscapes or plants.<ref>Strassfield, Christina Mossaides. "Lee Krasner: The Nature of the Body-- Works from 1933 to 1984". East Hampton: Guild Hall Museum, 1995. pg. 12</ref> She continued working in this style until she suffered an [[aneurysm]], fell, and broke her right wrist in 1963, the wrist she used to paint with.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 130</ref><ref>Hobbs, Robert. "Lee Krasner". New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 75</ref> Since she still wanted to work, she painted with her left hand instead.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 130</ref> To overcome working with her non-dominant hand, she often would directly apply paint from a tube to the canvas rather than using a brush, causing there to be large patches of white canvas on the surfaces of the images.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 130</ref> The gesture and the physicality of these works is more restrained since she is working with her left hand.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 130</ref>

After recovering from her broken arm, Krasner began working on bright and decorative allover painting which are less aggressive than her Earth Green Series and Umber Series paintings.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 132</ref> Often, these images recall calligraphy or floral ornamentation which are not blatantly related to Krasner's emotional state.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 132</ref> Floral or calligraphic shapes dominate the canvas, connecting variable brushwork into a single pattern.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 134</ref>

By the second half of the 1960s, critics began reassessing Krasner's role in the New York School as a painter and critic who greatly influenced Pollock and Greenberg due to the rise of the feminism.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 10</ref><ref>Tucker, Marcia. "Lee Krasner: Large Paintings". New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1973. pg.7</ref><ref>Cheim, John. "Lee Krasner: Paintings from 1965 to 1970". New York: Robert Miller, 1991. pg. 9</ref> Prior to this, her status as an artist was typically overlooked by critics and scholars due to her relationship with Pollock.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 10</ref> Since Pollock is such a large figure in the abstract expressionist movement, it is still often difficult for scholars to discuss her work without mentioning Pollock in some capacity.<ref>Cheim, John. "Lee Krasner: Paintings from 1965 to 1970". New York: Robert Miller, 1991. pg. 2</ref> This reevaluation is reflected in her first retrospective exhibition of her paintings which was held in London at the [[Whitechapel Gallery]] in 1965. This exhibition was more well received by critics in comparison to her previous shows in New York.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 10</ref>><ref>Cheim, John. "Lee Krasner: Paintings from 1965 to 1970". New York: Robert Miller, 1991. pg. 9</ref> 

In 1969, Krasner mostly concentrated on creating works on paper with gouache.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 139</ref> These works were named either earth, water, seed, or hieroglyphics and often looked similar to a [[Rorschach test]].<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 139</ref> Some scholars claim that these images were a critique of Greenberg's theory about the importance of the two-dimensional nature of the canvas.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 139</ref>

===Late career===

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Krasner's work was significantly influenced by [[postmodern art]] and emphasized the inherent problems of art as a form of communication.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. ''Lee Krasner''. New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 11</ref>

Starting in 1970, Krasner began making large horizontal paintings made up of hard-edge lines and a palette of a few bright colors that contrasted one another.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 150</ref> She painted in this style until about 1973.

In 1976, she started working on her second series of collage images. She began working on these collages after she was cleaning out her studio and discovered some charcoal drawings mostly of figure studies that she completed from 1937 to 1940.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 153</ref> After she saved a few of them, she decided to use the rest in a new series of collages. In these collages, the black and gray shapes of the figure studies are juxtaposed against the blank canvas or the addition of brightly colored paint.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 139</ref> The hard-edged shapes of the cut drawings are reconstructed into curvilinear shapes that recall floral patterns.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 153</ref> Texture is induced through the contrast of the smooth paper and rough canvas.<ref>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 153</ref> Since the figure studies are cut up and rearranged without consideration of their original intention or message, the differences between the old drawings and new structures is highly exaggerated.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. <U+201C>Lee Krasner<U+2019>s Skepticism and Her Emergent Postmodernism<U+201D>, Women<U+2019>s Art Journal, Vol. 28, No.2, (Fall-Winter 2008): 3 <U+2013> 10. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 8</ref> All of the collages' titles from this series are different verb tenses which is interpreted as a critique of Greenberg's and [[Michael Fried]]'s insistence on the presentness of modern art.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. <U+201C>Lee Krasner<U+2019>s Skepticism and Her Emergent Postmodernism<U+201D>, Women<U+2019>s Art Journal, Vol. 28, No.2, (Fall-Winter 2008): 3 <U+2013> 10. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 7</ref> These works are also considered as a statement about how artists need to reexamine and rework their style in order to stay relevant as they grow older.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. "Lee Krasner". New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 88</ref> This collage series was very well received by a large audience when they were exhibited in 1977 at the [[Pace Gallery]].<ref>Hobbs, Robert. "Lee Krasner". New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 88</ref>

===Pollock's influence===
Although many people believe that Krasner stopped working in the 1940s in order to nurture Pollock's home life and career, she never stopped creating art. Throughout her career, she went through periods of struggle where she would experiment with new styles that would satisfy her means for expression and harshly critique, revise, or destroy the work she would produce. Because of her self-criticism, there are periods of time where little to none of her work exists, specifically the late 1940s and early 1950s.<ref>Rose, Barbara. "Lee Krasner: A Retrospective". New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 14</ref>

Krasner and Pollock both had an immense effect on each other's artistic styles and careers. Since Krasner had learned from Hans Hofmann while Pollock received training from [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], each artist took different approaches to their work. Krasner learned from Hofmann the importance of the abstracting from nature and emphasizing the flat nature of the canvas while Pollock's training highlighted the importance of complex design from automatic drawing.<ref name="Rose, Barbara 1981. pg. 6">Rose, Barbara. "Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 6.</ref> Krasner's extensive knowledge of modern art helped Pollock since she brought him up to date with what contemporary art should be. He was therefore able to make works that were more organized and cosmopolitan.<ref name="Rose, Barbara 1981. pg. 6"/> Additionally, Krasner was responsible for introducing Pollock to many artists, collectors, and critics who appreciated abstract art such as [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Peggy Guggenheim]], and [[Clement Greenberg]].<ref name="Rose, Barbara 1981. pg. 6"/> Pollock also helped Krasner become less restrained when making her work. He inspired her to stop painting from human and still life models in order to free her interior emotions and become more spontaneous and gestural through her work.<ref name="Rose, Barbara 1981. pg. 6"/>

Krasner struggled with the public's reception of her identity, both as a woman and as the wife of Pollock. When they both exhibited their works at a show called "Artists: Man and Wife" in 1949, an [[ARTnews]] reviewer stated: "There is a tendency among some of these wives to 'tidy up' their husband's styles. Lee Krasner (Mrs. Jackson Pollock) takes her husband's paint and enamels and changes his unrestrained, sweeping lines into neat little squares and triangles."<ref>Wagner, Anne. <U+201C>Lee Krasner as L.K.<U+201D>, Representations, No. 25 (Winter 1989): 42 <U+2013> 57. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 44</ref> Even after the rise of feminism in the 1960s and 1970s, her career as an artist was always put into relation to Pollock since remarks made about her work often commented on how she had become a successful artist by moving out of Pollock's shadow.<ref>Wagner, Anne. <U+201C>Lee Krasner as L.K.<U+201D>, Representations, No. 25 (Winter 1989): 42 <U+2013> 57. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 45</ref> In articles about her work, Pollock is continually referred to. Typically in the 1940s and 1950s, she would not sign works at all, sign with the genderless initials "L.K.", or blend her signature into the painting in order to not emphasize her status as a woman and as a wife to another painter.<ref>Wagner, Anne. <U+201C>Lee Krasner as L.K.<U+201D>, Representations, No. 25 (Winter 1989): 42 <U+2013> 57. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 48</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Pollock-house.jpg|thumb|Pollock-Krasner house in Springs, New York]]
Lee Krasner died in 1984, age 75, from natural causes. She had been suffering from [[arthritis]].

Six months after her death, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] ([[MoMA]]) in [[New York City]] held a retrospective exhibition of her work. A review of the exhibition in the ''New York Times'' noted that it "clearly defines Krasner's place in the New York School" and that she "is a major, independent artist of the pioneer Abstract Expressionist generation, whose stirring work ranks high among that produced here in the last half-century."<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E0DB1038F932A15751C1A962948260&sec=&spon=&&scp=2&sq=%22Lee%20Krasner%22%20retrospective%201984&st=cse ''New York Times'' "ART: LEE KRASNER FINDS HER PLACE IN RETROSPECTIVE AT MODERN" By GRACE GLUECK. Published: December 21, 1984.]</ref> As of 2008, Krasner is one of only four women artists to have had a retrospective show at the Museum of Modern Art. The other three women artists are [[Louise Bourgeois]] (MoMA retrospective in 1982), [[Helen Frankenthaler]] (MoMA retrospective in 1989) and [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]] (MoMA retrospective in 2004).<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/arts/design/02kino.html?_r=1&scp=39&sq=%22lee%20krasner%22%201984&st=cse&oref=slogin ''New York Times'' "A Visit With the Modern's First Grandmother" By CAROL KINO. Published: October 2, 2005.]</ref>

Her papers were donated to the [[Archives of American Art]] in 1985; they were digitized and posted on the web for researchers in 2009.<ref>[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collectionsonline/polljack/overview.htm The Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner Papers], Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.</ref>

After her death, her East Hampton property became the [[Pollock-Krasner House and Studio]], and is open to the public for tours. A separate organization, the [[Pollock-Krasner Foundation]], was established in 1985. The Foundation functions as the official Estate for both Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock, and also, under the terms of her will, serves "to assist individual working artists of merit with financial need."<ref>[http://www.pkf.org/press.html The Pollock-Krasner Foundation website: Press Release page]</ref> The U.S. copyright representative for the Pollock-Krasner Foundation is the [[Artists Rights Society]].<ref>[http://arsny.com/requested.html Most frequently requested artists list of the Artists Rights Society]</ref>

[[File:Pollock-green.jpg|thumb|Lee Krasner's grave in front, with Jackson Pollock's grave in the rear, [[Green River Cemetery]]]]

Krasner was portrayed in an [[Academy Award]]-winning performance by [[Marcia Gay Harden]] in the 2000 film ''[[Pollock (film)|Pollock]]'', a drama about the life of her husband [[Jackson Pollock]], directed by [[Ed Harris]]. In [[John Updike]]'s novel ''Seek My Face'' (2002), a significant portion of the main character's life is based on Krasner's.

==Personal life==

===Relationship with Jackson Pollock===
Lee Krasner and [[Jackson Pollock]] established a relationship with one another in 1942 after they both exhibited at the McMillen Gallery. Krasner was intrigued by his work and the fact she did not know who he was since she knew many abstract painters in New York. She went to his apartment to meet him.<ref>Rose, Barbara. "Lee Krasner: A Retrospective". New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 48.</ref><ref>Hobbs, Robert. ''Lee Krasner''. New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 32</ref> By 1945, they moved to The Springs on the outskirts of East Hampton. In the summer of that year, they got married in a church with two witnesses present.<ref>Rose, Barbara. "Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 4.</ref>

While the two lived in the farmhouse in The Springs, they both continued creating art. They worked in separate studio spaces on their property. Krasner worked in an upstairs bedroom in the house while Pollock worked in the barn in their backyard.<ref name=autogenerated2>Rose, Barbara. "Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 8.</ref> When they were not working, the two spent their time cooking, baking, gardening, keeping the house organized, and entertaining friends.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

By 1956, their relationship became strained as they faced certain issues. Pollock had begun struggling with his alcoholism again and was partaking in an extramarital affair with [[Ruth Kligman]].<ref name=autogenerated3>Rose, Barbara. ''Lee Krasner: A Retrospective''. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1983. pg. 95.</ref> Krasner left in the summertime to visit friends in Europe but had to quickly return when Pollock died in a car crash while she was away.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

===Religion===
Krasner was brought up in an orthodox Jewish home throughout her childhood and adolescence. They lived in [[Brownsville, Brooklyn]] which had a large population of poor Jewish immigrants.<ref name=autogenerated1>Levin, Gail. <U+201C>Beyond the Pale: Lee Krasner and Jewish Culture<U+201D>, Women<U+2019>s Art Journal, Vol. 28, No.2 (Fall-Winter 2008): 28 <U+2013> 44. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 28.</ref> Her father spent most of his time practicing Judaism while her mother upheld the household and the family business.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Krasner appreciated aspects of Judaism like [[Hebrew script]], prayers, and religious stories. 

As a teenager, she grew critical of what she perceived as [[misogyny]] in orthodox Judaism. <ref name=autogenerated5>Levin, Gail. <U+201C>Beyond the Pale: Lee Krasner and Jewish Culture<U+201D>, Women<U+2019>s Art Journal, Vol. 28, No.2 (Fall-Winter 2008): 28 <U+2013> 44. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 29.</ref> In an interview later in her life, Krasner recalls reading a prayer translation and thinking it was "indeed a beautiful prayer in every sense except for the closing of it... if you are a male you say, 'Thank You, O Lord, for creating me in Your image'; and if you are a woman you say, 'Thank You, O Lord, for creating me as You saw fit.'"<ref name=autogenerated5 /> She also began reading [[existentialist]] philosophies during this time period, causing her to turn away from Judaism even further.<ref name=autogenerated4>Levin, Gail. <U+201C>Beyond the Pale: Lee Krasner and Jewish Culture<U+201D>, Women<U+2019>s Art Journal, Vol. 28, No.2 (Fall-Winter 2008): 28 <U+2013> 44. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 30.</ref> 

While she married Pollock in a church, Krasner continued to identify herself as Jewish but decided to not practice the religion.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> Her identity as a Jewish woman has affected how scholars interpret the meaning of her art.<ref name=autogenerated4 />
