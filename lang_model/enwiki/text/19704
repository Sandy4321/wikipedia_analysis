It was released in Japan in June 1997 and in the United States in January 1998. The game combines thematic elements of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' video game series with a [[game engine]] and battle system unlike those previously seen in the franchise. In contrast to other [[32-bit era]] ''Final Fantasy'' titles, ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' uses a [[3D computer graphics|3D]], [[Isometric projection|isometric]], rotatable playing field, with [[Raster graphics|bitmap]] [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] characters.<ref name="GSReview" />

The game is set in a fictional kingdom called [[Ivalice]], which has just ended its war with neighboring kingdom of Ordalia. The story follows Ramza Beoulve, a young cadet who finds himself thrust into the middle of a conflict, where two noble factions are coveting the throne of the kingdom.<ref name="Tactics6">{{cite book| editor=Square Electronic Arts| title=Final Fantasy Tactics North American instruction manual| origdate= |origyear=1997| publisher=Square Electronic Arts| language=English| id=SCUS-94221| pages=6}}</ref> While the war was caused by a conflict of succession, Ramza was exposed to a plot that involved the kingdom's dominant religious organization.

A [[spinoff]] was created in 2003, called ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'' for the [[Nintendo]] [[Game Boy Advance]], and a sequel has just been released for it called [[Final Fantasy Tactics A2]], and in 2006, a stand-alone title called ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' was released for the [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]]. All three games take place in the fictional land of [[Ivalice]]. An [[enhanced remake]] of ''Final Fantasy Tactics'', ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions]]'', was also released in 2007 as part of Square Enix's new ''[[Ivalice Alliance]]'' project.<ref name="remake">{{cite web| author=IGN Staff| title=IGN: Final Fantasy Tactics Returns| date=[[2006-12-13]]| publisher=[[IGN]]| url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/750/750839p1.html| accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref> Overall, the game received positive reviews from gaming magazines and websites.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay of ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' differs in several key areas from other titles in the ''Final Fantasy'' series. Instead of a generic battle screen, with the player's characters on one side and the enemies on the other, encounters take place on three-dimensional, isometric fields. Characters move on a battlefield composed of square tiles; movement and action ranges are determined by the character's statistics and job class.<ref name="Tactics12">{{cite book| editor=Square Electronic Arts| title=Final Fantasy Tactics North American instruction manual| origdate=| origyear=1997| publisher=Square Electronic Arts| language=English| id=SCUS-94221| pages=12<U+2013>13}}</ref> Battles are [[Conditional Turn-Based Battle System|turn-based]]; a unit may act when its CT (Charge Time) reaches 100.<ref name="Tactics12"/> Charge time is increased once every CT unit (a measure of time in battles) by an amount equal to the unit's speed statistic.<ref name="Tactics12"/> When CT reaches 100 or greater, the unit may act. During battle, whenever a unit performs an action successfully, it gains [[experience point|Experience Points]] (EXP) and Job Points (JP).<ref name="Tactics10">{{cite book| editor=Square Electronic Arts| title=Final Fantasy Tactics North American instruction manual| origdate= | origyear=1997| publisher=Square Electronic Arts| language=English| id=SCUS-94221| pages=10<U+2013>11}}</ref>

[[Image:BattleGrid.jpg|thumb|200px|left|An example of the [[Isometric projection|isometric]] battlefields found in the game. The blue panels on the ground mark where the [[Black Mage|Wizard]] (with straw hat and "AT" icon) can move to.]]
Another difference is the manner in which random battles are encountered. Like other ''Final Fantasy'' games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in ''Final Fantasy Tactics'', random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map.<ref name="Tactics21">{{cite book| editor=Square Electronic Arts| title=Final Fantasy Tactics North American instruction manual| origdate= | origyear=1997| publisher=Square Electronic Arts| language=English| id=SCUS-94221| pages=21<U+2013>23}}</ref> Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause [[area of effect]] damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging.<ref name="Tactics16">{{cite book |editor=Square Electronic Arts|title=Final Fantasy Tactics North American instruction manual|origdate= |origyear=1997|publisher=Square Electronic Arts|language=English|id=SCUS-94221|pages=16}}</ref> [[Hit Points]] of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of [[Races of Final Fantasy#Lucavi|certain bosses]]), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.<ref name="Tactics10"/>

Movement on the world map is limited to predefined paths connecting the towns and battle points.<ref name="Tactics21"/> When the character icon is over a town, a menu can be opened with several options: "Bar" for taking sidequest job offers, "Shop" for buying supplies and equipment, and "Soldier Office" for recruiting new characters.<ref name="Tactics21"/> Later in the game, some towns contain "Fur Shops" for obtaining items by way of [[poaching]] monsters.<ref name="Tactics21"/>

[[Image:JobClasses.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Final Fantasy Tactics'' offers a wide selection of Job Classes.  This particular character is currently a [[Black Mage|Wizard]].]]
Like several installments in the series, ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' features a [[Final Fantasy character classes|character class system]], which allows players to customize characters into various roles. The game makes extensive use of most of the original character classes seen in earlier ''Final Fantasy'' games, including [[Final Fantasy character classes#Summoner|Summoners]], [[Black Mage|Wizards]] (Black Mages), [[White Mage|Priests]] (White Mages), [[Final Fantasy character classes#Monk|Monks]], [[Final Fantasy character classes#Dragoon|Lancers]] (Dragoons), and [[Final Fantasy character classes#Thief|Thieves]].<ref name="Tactics23">{{cite book |editor=Square Electronic Arts|title=Final Fantasy Tactics North American instruction manual|origdate= |origyear=1997|publisher=Square Electronic Arts|language=English|id=SCUS-94221|pages=23<U+2013>26}}</ref> New recruits start out as either a [[Squire]] or a [[Chemist]], the base classes for warrior and magician jobs, respectively. The game features twenty jobs accessible by normal characters.<ref name="Tactics23"/>

In battle, JP are rewarded for every successful action. JP are used to learn new abilities within each job class.<ref name="Tactics23"/> Accumulating enough JP results in a job level up; new jobs are unlocked by attaining a certain level in the current job class (for instance, to become a Priest or Wizard, the unit must first attain Job Level 2 as a Chemist), which also allows the character to gain more JP in that class in battles.<ref name="Tactics23"/> Once all of the abilities of a job class have been learned, the class is "Mastered". A soldier in a specific Job always has its innate skill equipped (Wizards always have "Black Magic," Knights always have "Battle Skill") but a second job-skill slot and several other ability slots (Reaction, Support, and Movement) can be filled with any skill the particular soldier has learned.<ref name="Tactics23"/>

==Plot==
===Setting===
<!-- remember, this is based on the PS version. -->
The story takes place in the fictional kingdom of [[Ivalice]], located in a peninsula surrounded by sea on the north, west and south, with a [[headland]] south of the landmass. Its geography features ranging landscapes, from plains to mountains ranges to deserts and forests. It is heavily populated by human beings, although intelligent monsters can be found living in less populated areas. Magic is predominant in the land, although ruins and artifacts indicated that past populace had relied on machinery, such as airships and robots.<ref>'''Agrias''': I hear a 'lost civilization' is hidden under Goug.... When St. Ajora was alive, airships were in the sky, and human robots in town. But time passed, technology was lost, and no one knows if it ever really existed. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> 

Ivalice is a kingdom of seven territories, united under a monarch.<ref>'''Zodiac Brave Story''': Long before Ivalice was united, the land was divided into 7 kingdoms: Zeltennia, Fovoham, Lionel, Limberry, Lesalie, Gallione, and Murond.{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Ivalice's neighbors are the kingdom of Ordalia in the east and Romanda, a military nation to the north. While the three nations share common royal bloodlines, major wars have taken place between them. An influential religious institution known as the Murond Glabados Church heads the dominant faith, centering around a religious figure known as Saint Ajora.<ref>'''Zodiac Brave Story''': ...Those disciples of Ajora believed this was his miracle, and these stories spread, and the Glabados Church became what it is today. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> 

The story takes place after Ivalice ended its war with the two nations in what is known as the Fifty Years War, and is facing economic problems and political strife.<ref>'''Narration''':  Many soldiers who returned from the war, had no jobs, little money, and even less loyalty to the crown.{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Adding to its problems is the recent death of the king, whose heir is only an infant.<ref>'''News''': A political struggle erupted between the Prince Larg and the son of the late King. They are fighting for the regency, who will be guardian to the Prince.{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref>  A regent is needed to rule in place of the prince, and the kingdom is split between Prince Goltana, represented by the Black Lion, and Prince Larg, symbolized by the White Lion. The conflict leads to what is known in the game as the Lion War. Behind this backdrop is a revelation by the game's fictional historian Alazlam J. Durai, who seeks to reveal the story of an unknown character whose role in the Lion War was major but was covered up by the kingdom's church.<ref>'''Alazlam''': According to the "Durai Report" released last year (concealed for many years by church), this unknown man is the true hero... The church claims he was a blasphemer and anarchist-the root of all evil...{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref>  The setting is based around this character, named by default as Ramza, and revolves around his early life and the future conflicts he faced while the events that changed the kingdom unfold.

===Characters===
Central to the plot of the game are two main characters, Ramza Beoulve and Delita Hyral. The two characters are childhood friends, and while both are born of differing social classes; Ramza a noble and Delita a commoner, both disregarded this fact and grew up together believing in justice and honor, as taught by Ramza's father Balbanes. However, as the story progresses, the two characters faced many conflicts that changed their viewpoint on life; Delita seeks to manipulate the upper class to achieve his dreams, while Ramza believes in justice and honor regardless of name and class.<ref>'''Delita''': Larg, Goltana, your brothers, everyone... Haven't noticed they're all swept up in the same flow. I'm just going against it. That's all...... {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref><ref>'''Ramza''': There's no 'justice' in using and deceiving people! I can't ignore people dying for 'justice'! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref>

The game's plot is then portrayed through the eyes of Ramza Beoulve, who is the player character of the story. His exploits in the war introduced him to a number of characters; each with their own roles and agenda concerning the war and the fictional world, Ivalice, that they inhabit. The most prominent factions at the beginning of the story are those of [[Characters of Final Fantasy Tactics#Prince Goltana|Prince Goltana]] and [[Characters of Final Fantasy Tactics#Prince Larg|Prince Larg]], both are nobles seeking to obtain control of the throne by being the guardian to the monarch's young heir and were thus engaged in a war. The story progresses to include characters from the Murond Glabados Church, which have been controlling Ivalice silently and engineering the war in question.<ref>'''Simon''': High Priest and his sect are trying to regain power. First, they're reducing Larg and Goltana's military power by causing in-fighting.

As the game progresses, players are able to recruit generic player characters and customize them using the Job system of the Final Fantasy series. Several battles also feature "Guest" characters that are controlled via the game's A.I., which may be recruited later in the game according to the story proper. Aside from original characters, the developers have also incorporated cameo roles from other Square games. The characters were designed by [[Akihiko Yoshida]], who was also in charge of the illustration and character designs of games such as ''[[Tactics Ogre]]'', ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'', ''Final Fantasy XII'', and ''Vagrant Story''.<ref name="GamespotQA">{{cite web| author=Gamespot Staff| date=[[2003-11-20]]| title=Q&A: Final Fantasy XII developers| publisher=[[GameSpot]]| url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy12/news_6084068.html| accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.square-enix.com/na/company/press/2007/1009/| title=Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions ships to North American Retailers| publisher=[[Square Enix]]| date=[[2007-10-09]]| accessdate=2007-12-13}}</ref>

===Story===
''Final Fantasy Tactics'' begins with Ivalice just recovering from the Fifty Year War against Ordalia.<ref>'''News''':A war that caused terror for nearly 50 years between Ivalice and Ordalia, known as the "Fifty Year War".{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref>  The power vacuum caused by the death of its ruler, King Omdoria, soon sparked another conflict. Princess Ovelia and the younger Prince Orinas are both candidates to the throne, with the former supported by Prince Goltana of the Black Lion,<ref>'''News''': Goltana went to Lesalia and confined Ruvelia in Bethla for kidnapping the Princess, and let the Princess accede to the throne. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> and the latter by Queen Ruvelia and her brother, Prince Larg of the White Lion.<ref>'''News''': But Larg insisted Orinas was the legitimate successor and had him accede to the throne. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> This erupted into a full-scale war known as the "Lion War", with either side using whatever means possible to secure their place in the throne. This included bearing an illegitimate child,<ref>'''Vormav''': Larg may have had "seeds" planted to make his sister the King's mother. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> killing other possible heirs,<ref>'''Vormav''': They killed 2 older Princes making it look like illness {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> betrayal,<ref>'''Dycedarg''': Quiet, Zalbag! / '''Larg''': You...betraying me...?

Throughout the game, nobles regard commoners and peasants as animals,<ref>'''Algus''': Human? Hmph, ridiculous! From the minute you were born you had to obey us! From the second you were born you were our animals!! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> and many commoners try to take revenge on the nobles, who abandoned them after the war.<ref>'''Narrator''': Many soldiers who returned from the war, had no jobs, little money, and even less loyalty to the crown.{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Most joined the so-called Death Corps to fight against the nobles' soldiers, and many died in vain.<ref>'''Golagros''': The Death Corps lost most of their men and now are surrounded by the Hokuten. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Ramza, part of the noble Beoulve family of knights, and Delita, his childhood friend who was an ordinary commoner, were witnesses to this phenomenon. Events such as meeting an arrogant noble named Algus, as well as the negligent killing of Delita's sister Teta during an uprising, caused Delita and Ramza to abandon the nobility, both going separate ways.<ref>'''Algus''': Heh! Commoners are all alike. You'll never be nobles! Delita, You don't belong here! Understand, rascal!? {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref>

Ramza joins a mercenary group,<ref>'''Ramza''': ...I'm no longer a Knight. Just a mercenary like you. / '''Gafgarion''': ...That's right. Well then. Let's go! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> led by Gafgarion, who protects Princess Ovelia from being hunted by both sides. Delita has joined Prince Goltana's forces to rise up through the ranks and gain control over his own destiny.<ref>'''Delita''': You won't confuse me! Nobody uses me!! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Ramza and Delita are reunited when Gafgarion attempts to take Ovelia to Prince Larg, though this was futile. Agrias suggests visiting Cardinal Draclau of the Glabados Church to protect Ovelia, while Delita continues to work in the shadows, working with multiple sides to realize his ambition.<ref name="delita">'''Delita''': You and I are the same... Miserable people forced to live false lives. Always being used by someone... Try hard and you'll be rewarded they say. Lies... Only those close to the top are rewarded without trying, It's the way of the world. Most people have to act the roles given to them... Then again, most of them haven't even noticed they're even acting. No way I'd do that. I won't be used. I'll be the one using! Those who used me must pay for what they've done! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Along the way to Lionel Castle, Ramza meets Mustadio, a machinist in possession of a holy relic called the Zodiac Stone. Hunted by a trading company for the power it contains,<ref>'''Mustadio''': I don't know what power the stone has... But Rudvich wants to use its power to make weapons. My father told me never to give the stones to him. So they abducted him. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Mustadio also seeks Draclau's intervention.

However, soon after the encounter with Cardinal Draclau, Ramza discovers that an elaborate plot was set by the Murond Glabados Church. In their desire to control Ivalice, the Church, particularly the High Priest Marge Funeral, uses the legend of the so-called holy Zodiac Braves to gather the Zodiac Stones,<ref>'''Ramza''': Why do you think the Cardinal wanted the stone? People are sick of long wars and political in fighting. Draclau wants to use the 'Zodiac Brave Story'. Creating 'Zodiac Braves' by collecting holy stones, he can control the world. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> and fuels the Lion War between Larg and Goltana.<ref>'''Simon''': Simon: High Priest and his sect are trying to regain power. First, they're reducing Larg and Goltana's military power by causing in-fighting. If the war drags on, it not only reduce their power, but trust in the royal family. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> To stave off Ramza's interference, Draclau uses the stone to transform into a legendary Lucavi demon,<ref>'''Draclau''': Ha, ha, ha... You're the one holding the stone. You can change not only the world, but the truth of everything with its power. Since you don't seem to understand, let me show you. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> and Ramza has no choice but to slay him/it. As a result, Ramza is regarded a heretic of the Church, and he is approached by the Heretic Examiner Zalmo at Lesalia Imperial Capital.<ref>'''Ramza''': Why am I a 'heretic'? I haven't done anything. / '''Zalmo''': Don't be coy! You killed Draclau and took the Holy Stone to give it to a demon! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref>

While noble in name, the Beoulve family is susceptible to corruption, due to ambition. Dycedarg, the eldest sibling, conspires with Larg and the Church to ensure that the Beoulve family remains in power.  However, his younger brother Zalbag is unaware of his dealings.<ref>'''Dycedarg''': If only you hadn't interfered... Ivalice would've been ours, the Beoulve's... You fools... {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref>  Alma, Ramza's younger sister, remains in church, unaffected by the situation until Ramza is branded a heretic in front of her.<ref>'''Ramza''': You should run, Alma!

Only Ramza and Alma share their father's sense of justice.

Ramza is chased throughout the story by the Shrine Knights, the soldiers of the Church who are hunting the Zodiac Stones, although he gains allies, either by saving their lives,<ref>'''Olan''': Ramza, you're not alone! You have friends! Allies who'd 
risk their lives! I'm one of them! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> or by showing them the truth.<ref>'''Meliadoul''': I'm going to give you this Zodiac Stone. In return, let me go along. I want to know why my father... Besides... {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Some individuals with knowledge of the Zodiac Stones attempt to conspire with the Shrine Knights for its power, though most fail.<ref>'''Rudvich''': Why him...? / '''Draclau''': You failed enough.

To do that, unsuitable facts had to be deleted from history and St. Ajora had to become a 'Child of God'." {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> and attempts to use it along with the Zodiac Stone to reveal the organization's plot.<ref>'''Ramza''': The stones are evil...and so are the Zodiac Braves. The 
legends we believed in were all lies! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> 

In the course of the story, the two sides face off in a major battle that sees the deaths of many soldiers, including their leaders Larg and Goltana. Ramza manages to stop the bloodshed from continuing and rescues the general Cidolfas Orlandu, though the Church succeeds in eliminating the two Lions to secure its power over Ivalice. Deeper into the story, Ramza discovers that the Shrine Knights are in reality Lucavi, and the real conspirators behind the Church's plot.<ref>'''Ramza''': But collecting the stones and using the Brave Legend to use the people... / '''Malak''': You mean even the High Priest's being used? {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy Tactics |developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> The Lucavi are seeking to resurrect their leader Altima, who in the past was Saint Ajora, and they need much bloodshed and a suitable body to complete the resurrection. Alma is to serve as the host for Altima's incarnation.<ref>'''Vormav''': No, it will work... It just needs more... You didn't hear? It just needs more blood...

==Development==
''Final Fantasy Tactics'' was produced mostly by the team that made ''[[Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen|Ogre Battle]]'' and ''[[Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together|Tactics Ogre]]'', and was [[Yasumi Matsuno]]'s first project with Square following his departure from [[Quest Corporation|Quest]] in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.critiqueofgames.net/data/ros/sq-kai.htm| author=critiqueofgames.net staff| title = <U+30B9><U+30AF><U+30A6><U+30A7><U+30A2><U+30FB><U+30A8><U+30CB><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30B9><U+958B><U+767A><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30C3><U+30D5><U+30EB><U+30FC><U+30E0>| publisher = Critique of Games| date = [[2004-03-19]]| accessdate=2007-12-11 }}</ref> In an interview with Akito Inoue, an assistant professor at the International University of Japan, Inoue mentions that ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' was made because of how casual gamers are usually put off by games with branching storylines found in other Matsuno's titles such as ''[[Tactics Ogre]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://squarehaven.com/news/2007/05/27/Critique-of-Games-Akito-Inoue| publisher = Square Haven| title= Critique of Games: Akito Inoue| date=[[2007-05-27]]| accessdate=2007-12-13}}</ref>

Several historical and mythological references were altered by translators: for instance, the Norse World Tree, [[Yggdrasil]], makes an appearance as Yugodorasil; the word "breath" is consistently rendered as "bracelet" in attack names;<ref name="Mistranslation1">{{cite web| author=Fraundorf, Fritz| year=1998| title=Final Fantasy Tactics FAQ - Mistranslations| url=http://www.cheatcc.com/psx/sg/final_fantasy_tactics.txt| publisher = Cheat Code Central| accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> and Wiegraf's name is nearly homonymous with [[Wiglaf|a character from ''Beowulf'']] but rendered differently.<ref name="Mistranslation2">{{cite web| year=2007| title=Engrish Slang| url=http://www.aboutlanguageschools.com/language/slang/engrish-slang.asp| publisher = Language schools| accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref> The in-game tutorial function also shows examples of [[Engrish]] - poorly translated English - including lines such as "This was the darkened Items won't appear."<ref>'''Daravon''': "This was the darkened Items won't appear." - In-game Tutorial {{cite video game| title=Final Fantasy Tactics| developer=[[Squaresoft]]|publisher=Square Co.| date=1997-06-20| platform=PlayStation| language=English}}</ref> 

The game also includes references to several specific characters, places, and situations from earlier games in the ''Final Fantasy'' series <U+2014> ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Cloud Strife]] is a playable character, and through the "Proposition" system in bars scattered around the world map, treasures and lost areas such as "Matoya Cave" (a reference to the first ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'') and various colors of [[materia]] can be found.<ref name="treasure">{{cite book| author=Hollinger, Elizabeth and Ratkos, James| year=1997 | title=Final Fantasy Tactics: Prima's Official Strategy Guide | pages=189 | publisher=Prima Publishing | language=English | id=ISBN 0-7615-1246-2}}</ref>  To keep with tradition, Olan's adoptive father, Cidolfas Orlandu, is nicknamed "T.G. [[Cid (Final Fantasy)|Cid]]", and [[chocobo]]s are present in the game as well. Additionally, most of the monsters appear in one ''Final Fantasy'' game or another, although the Lucavi are entirely new monsters altogether.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/120/120026p1.html| title= Preview:Final Fantasy Tactics| publisher = [[IGN]]| author=IGN staff | date=[[1997-06-24]]| accessdate=2007-12-13}}</ref>

The game's soundtrack is composed by [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]] and [[Masaharu Iwata]], both of whom later collaborated to compose music for ''[[Stella Deus]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''. Matsuno approached his long time friends Sakimoto and Iwata to compose the music soon after the initial release of ''Final Fantasy VII''.<ref>{{cite web| author=Hoyak, Paul| year= | title=Final Fantasy Tactics Original Soundtrack Review| url=http://www.vgmworld.com/reviews/index.php?table=cocoebiz_music&item_num=69| work=VGM World| publisher = CocoeBiz L.L.C| accessedate=2007-12-20}}</ref> Sakimoto composed 47 tracks for the game, and Iwata was left to compose the other 24. The orchestral nature of the game's music was made possible using synthesizing operated by the synthesizer operator Katsutoshi Kashiwabara and sound programming Hidenori Suzuki. The album was first released on two [[Compact Disc]]s by now-defunct [[DigiCube]] on [[June 21]], [[1997]] bearing the catalog number ''SSCX-10008'',<ref>{{cite web| title = Label: DigiCube - MusicBrainz| url = http://musicbrainz.org/label/b922c77d-339b-4303-b799-effa4cc89d0a.html| publisher = [[MusicBrainz]]| accessdate = 2007-10-17}}</ref> and was re-released by [[Square Enix]] on [[March 24]], [[2006]] with the catalog number ''SQEX-10066/7''. It spans two discs and 71 tracks, covering a duration of 2:31:03.

Some reviewers made comparison with [[Nobuo Uematsu]]'s ''Final Fantasy'' compositions, though the soundtrack received positive reviews from critics. Chudah's Corner summarized its review by stating that the soundtrack is an "astoundingly memorable classic of videogame music".<ref>{{cite web| author=Jormungand| date=1997| title=Review by: Jormungand| publisher = Chudah's Corner| url=http://www.chudahs-corner.com/reviews/index.php?catalog=SSCX-10008| accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> This is also supported by other professional reviews, such as by an RPGFan reviewer that "don't believe that any other soundtrack known to man surpasses it", and a VGM World review who quotes that "the orchestral music is beautiful nonetheless".<ref>{{cite web| author=Gann, Patrick| date=1997| title=Final Fantasy Tactics Original Soundtrack Review| publisher = RPGFan| url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/fft/index.html| accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author=Harry| date=[[2006-05-18]]| title=Customer Review| url=http://www.vgmworld.com/catalog/index.php?table=cocoebiz_music&item_num=712 | work=VGM World| publisher = CocoeBiz L.L.C| accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy Tactics'' received positive reviews upon its release, and critical opinion of the game has improved further over time. Magazines such as [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] acknowledges it as "Square's first attempt into the strategy RPG genre"; though being "uneven", it is worth to be called "a classic".<ref>{{cite web| publisher = [[Metacritic]]| title = Final Fantasy Tactics (PSX: 1997)| url = http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/psx/finalfantasytactics?q=final%20fantasy%20tactics| accessdate = 2007-07-21}}</ref> Game Informer calls it "the most impressive strategy RPG yet."<ref>{{cite book |editor= McNamara, Andy |title=Game Informer Magazine |year=1997 |publisher=Sunrise Publications |issue=9 }}</ref> Gaming websites such as GameSpot lauded the game's battle sequences as challenging, requiring more strategic planning than ordinary RPGs. <ref name="GSReview" /> IGN noted that the plot was the strength of the game, being in-depth and with numerous plot twists. During battle sequences, the story unfolds to create a serious atmosphere of the plot, even with simple and "cute" character design. The spells and summoning visuals were compared with ''Final Fantasy VII'' 's detailed graphics.<ref name="IGNR" /><ref name="GSReview" /> 

Criticism is made on gameplay, plot and the localization effort. One of the reviews of RPGFan criticized the difficulty of the game as being inconsistent with each encounter against enemy units. The factors that influence the difficulty of the game include overpowered enemy units or party members, and time had to be taken to level up before any progress can be made.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/finalfantasytactics/Final_Fantasy_Tactics-4.html| title=RPGFan Reviews| author=Tortolia| publisher = RPGFan| accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref> Though in-depth, IGN also noted that the game's plot was confusing at times, and that the item system was repetitive.<ref name="IGNR">{{cite web| author="IGN staff"| date=[[1998-01-27]]| title=Final Fantasy Tactics| url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/150/150026p1.html| publisher=[[IGN]]| accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref> The game's localization effort was criticized by reviewers as poorly written, being rife with grammatical mistakes that almost stopped players from enjoying the storyline.<ref name="GSReview">{{cite web | author=Kasavin, Greg| date=[[1998-02-23]]| title=Final Fantasy Tactics for PlayStation Review| url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/strategy/finalfantasytactics/review.html| publisher=[[GameSpot]]| accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref> General RPGFan review noted that the battlefield area was too small, hindering any possibilities for better strategy. The gameplay is summarized by one of the reviews as "strength vs. strength and proper spacing of troops when fighting magic users".<ref>{{cite web| author="Esque"| date=[[1998-01-27]] | title=Final Fantasy Tactics| url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/finalfantasytactics/Final_Fantasy_Tactics.html| publisher=RPGFan| accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref>

[[IGN]] awarded the game the Editor's Choice Award on 1998, praising the in-game graphics as "amazing" and the battle environments with its extra details as being "extremely well designed".<ref name="IGNR" /> [[GameSpot]] has named ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' as one of its Greatest Games of All Time<ref>{{cite web| author=Kasavin, Greg| date=1997| url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-16.html | title=GameSpot: The Greatest Games of All Time: Final Fantasy Tactics| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>&mdash;the first ''Final Fantasy'' game to be so honored. However, its legacy remains fairly obscure compared to ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', also released for the PlayStation that year.

Editorials from the gaming website [[RPGamer]] outlined several similarities between the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the Church of Glabados portrayed in ''Final Fantasy Tactics''. One editorial noted that it was a controversial move by the developers, as if the church institution "in fact worships a demon, and is evil from its god on down".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/editor/1998/q3/072398ja.html|title=Why Final Fantasy Tactics Is So Offensive |author=Adashek, Jeff | work=[[RPGamer]] | year=1998|accessdate=2008-03-08}}</ref> However, another editorial mentions that such controversies failed to recognize the church in question is the medieval Roman Catholic Church, and that historically such institution is known for its flaws in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/editor/1998/q3/071698sb.html|author=Bruckner Shawn|title=Zeroing in on Controversy|work=[[RPGamer]] | year=1998|accessdate=2008-03-08}} </ref>
