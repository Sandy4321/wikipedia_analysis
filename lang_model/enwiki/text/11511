'''Deyrulumur Monastery''' (also known as ''Dayro d-Mor Gabriel''; ) ([[Aramaic]]: <U+0715><U+071D><U+072A><U+0710> <U+0715><U+0721><U+072A><U+071D> <U+0713><U+0712><U+072A><U+0710><U+071D><U+0720>; ''The Monastery of St. Gabriel'') is the oldest surviving [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] monastery in the world.  It is located on the [[Tur Abdin]] plateau near [[Midyat]] in the [[Mardin Province]] in Southeastern [[Turkey]].

Founded in 397, Deyrulumur is the most vital Syriac Orthodox monastery in Turkey, with around fifteen [[nuns]] and two [[monks]] occupying separate wings, as well as a fluctuating number of local lay workers and guests from overseas. It is also the seat of the [[metropolitan bishop]] of Tur Abdin.

Deyrulumur is a working community set amongst gardens and orchards, and somewhat disfigured by 1960s residential accommodation. The monastery's primary purpose is to keep Syriac Orthodox Christianity alive in the land of its birth by providing schooling, ordination of native-born monks.  On occasions it has provided physical protection to the Christian population.

Deyrulumur is open to visitors, and it is possible to stay with permission, but is closed, firmly, after dark.
