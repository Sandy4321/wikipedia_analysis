'''Robert William Andrew Feller''' (November 3, 1918{{spaced ndash}}December 15, 2010), nicknamed '''"The Heater from Van Meter,"''' '''"Bullet Bob,"''' and '''"Rapid Robert,"''' was an American [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[pitcher]] from 1936 to 1956. In a career spanning 570 games, Feller pitched 3,827 [[innings pitched|innings]] and posted a [[win (baseball)|win<U+2013>loss record]] of 266<U+2013>162, with 279 [[complete game]]s, 44 [[shutout]]s, and a 3.25 [[earned run average]] (ERA).

A prodigy who bypassed the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]], Feller first played for the [[Cleveland Indians]] at the age of 17, and played for 18 seasons in total, all with Cleveland. His career was interrupted by four years military service in World War II during which he served as [[Chief Petty Officer (United States)|Chief Petty Officer]] aboard the [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|USS ''Alabama'']]. Feller became the first pitcher to win 24 games in a season before the age of 21. During his career he threw [[no-hitter]]s in 1940, 1946, and 1951. Feller also recorded 12 [[one-hitter (baseball)|one-hitters]] (his no-hitters and one-hitters were records at the time of his retirement). He helped the Indians win a [[World Series]] title in [[1948 World Series|1948]] and an [[American League]]-record 111 wins and the [[pennant (sports)|pennant]] in 1954.

Feller led the American League in [[win (baseball)|wins]] six times and [[strikeout]]s in seven seasons. In 1946, he recorded 348 strikeouts, a total not bettered for 27 years. An eight-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], Feller was ranked 36th on ''[[Sporting News]]''{{'}}s list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and also the publication's "greatest pitcher of his time" as well as a finalist for the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]] in 1999.

[[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] member [[Ted Williams]] called Feller "the fastest and best pitcher I ever saw during my career."<ref name="Globe">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/articles/2010/12/16/bob_feller_92_hall_of_famer_had_blazing_fastball/|title=Bob Feller, 92, Hall of Famer had blazing fastball|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=December 16, 2010|accessdate=July 27, 2012|last=Feeney|first=Mark}}</ref> Hall of Famer [[Stan Musial]] believed he was "probably the greatest pitcher of our era."<ref name="Globe"/> He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 on his first ballot appearance; at the time only three players ever had a higher percentage of ballot votes. He was elected the inaugural President of the [[Major League Baseball Players' Association]] and participated in [[barnstorm (sports)|exhibition games]] which featured players from both the Major and [[Negro Leagues]]. Feller died at the age of 92 in 2010.

==Early life==
Feller was born and raised with his sister Marguerite, in [[Van Meter, Iowa]].

His catcher during this period was [[Nile Kinnick]], who later became a member of the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].<ref name="Sickels"/>{{rp|20}}

A student at Van Meter High School, Feller was a starting pitcher for the school's baseball team. During this time he continued to play on the Farmers Union team in the [[American Amateur Baseball Congress]], and had 25 wins and four losses for Farmers Union one season.<ref name="feller5"/>{{rp|4}}<ref name="Gilbert"/>{{rp|37}} He also was the starting [[center (basketball)|center]] for the high school basketball team.<ref name="Sickels"/>{{rp|29}} By the age of 16, Feller possessed what critics judged a high quality [[fastball]]; major league scouts traveled to [[Dayton, Ohio]] to watch him in the annual national baseball tournament. After the game, several big league clubs offered signing bonuses with their contract offers, but he had already been signed to a professional contract with the [[Cleveland Indians]].<ref name="Sickels"/>{{rp|25<U+2013>26}}

==Professional career==

===Teenage phenomenon (1936<U+2013>1941)===
In 1936, Feller was signed by [[Cy Slapnicka]], a [[scout (sport)|scout]] for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball.<ref name="Sickels"/>{{rp|27}} While scouting Feller, Slapnicka said, "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around.

He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder [[Tommy Henrich]], to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games [[List of baseball players who went directly to the major leagues|without visiting either farm club]]. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioner]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president [[Alva Bradley]], but awarded both Feller and Henrich [[free agent (sports)|free agency]] and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/>{{rp|375}} Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court.<ref name="Deford"/> Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the [[New York Yankees]]. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EycbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CkwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6479,5227575&dq=bob+feller+mountain+landis&hl=en|date=December 11, 1936|title=Rob the Cradle?

Feller joined the Indians and made his Major League debut on July 19, 1936 in a relief appearance against the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]]. A month later on August 23, Feller made his first career start against the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]]. Indians [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Steve O'Neill]] had [[Denny Galehouse]] warmed up in the bullpen in case the 17-year-old Feller had early troubles, but he struck out all three batters faced in the first inning, and recorded 15 [[strikeouts]] to earn his first career win.

On October 2, [[1938 Cleveland Indians season|1938]], Feller was the starting pitcher against the [[Detroit Tigers]]. Detroit's [[Hank Greenberg]] was two home runs short of [[Babe Ruth]]'s then-single-season record of 60 home runs. By the ninth inning, Feller had recorded 16 strikeouts, one fewer than the MLB record in a nine-inning game. He tied the record when he struck out Detroit's [[Pete Fox]] and passed it, to set a modern [[List of pitchers who have struck out 18 or more batters in a nine-inning MLB game|major league record]] of 18 strikeouts, when he struck out [[Chet Laabs]] for the fifth time that day.

Due to Feller's pitching speed, [[Lew Fonseca]] was commissioned by the Office of the Commissioner to pit Feller's fastball against a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle in a speed trial.

The motorcycle passed Feller going {{convert|86 |mi}} per hour (mph/kph) and with a 10-foot (three-meter) head start but the ball beat the bike to the target by three feet (0.91 m).

The United States entered [[World War II]] with the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. Feller heard about the bombing while returning from a visit to his terminally ill father at [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] to [[Chicago]] where he was to sign a new Indians contract.<ref name="Deford"/> Two days later, he volunteered for the [[United States Navy]], becoming the first American professional athlete to enlist.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=buckheit/091112&sportCat=mlb|title=For Feller, Navy was easy decision|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=November 12, 2009|accessdate=July 27, 2012|last=Buckheit|first=Mary}}</ref> Originally he tried to enlist as a fighter pilot but failed hearing tests. Feller attended basic training at Norfolk Naval Base and served as a physical fitness instructor there. He also pitched in baseball games hosted by the military.

Shortly before Feller left for combat, his father died. Five days later, in January 1943, he married Virginia Winther whom he met while in Florida for spring training; she was a student at [[Rollins College]].<ref name="Dolgan"/> After the marriage, Feller returned to service as Gun Captain aboard the ''Alabama'' and kept his pitching arm in shape by throwing near a gun turret.<ref name="Tribute">{{cite news|url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110331&content_id=17223902&vkey=news_cle&c_id=cle|title=Indians, fans pay tribute to Feller|last=Bastian|first=Jordan|work=[[MLB.com]]|date=March 31, 2011|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}</ref> Feller and the ''Alabama'' crew spent most of 1943 in the British Isles along with [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|USS ''South Dakota'']], but in August were reassigned to the [[Pacific Theater of Operations]].<ref name="Sickels"/>{{rp|119}} Feller's first taste of direct combat was at [[Operation Galvanic]] in November 1943.

When the war ended, Feller was discharged as a [[Chief Petty Officer (United States)|Chief Petty Officer]] on August 22, 1945.<ref name="Dolgan"/> Feller was decorated with six campaign ribbons and eight [[battle star]]s while serving on missions in both the Pacific and North Atlantic, and he was made an honorary member of the [[Green Berets]].<ref name="feller5"/>{{rp|xiii}}<ref name="Dolgan"/>

===Return to Cleveland (1945<U+2013>1948)===
Upon arrival in Cleveland after his discharge, Feller was honored with a civic luncheon on August 24, 1945, with more than 1,000 people in attendance at the Carter Hotel. Feller said to the crowd: "The real heroes didn't come home."<ref name="Dolgan"/><ref name="Tribute"/> Later that day, the city held a parade and Feller was the starting pitcher in the Indians' game against the Detroit Tigers. Feller allowed four hits in the game and earned a win in the Indians' 4<U+2013>2 victory. "I was so tired from all the receptions I didn't know if I could finish the game," Feller said.<ref name="Dolgan"/> For the 1945 season, he appeared in nine games and notched a 5<U+2013>3 record with 59 strikeouts and 2.50&nbsp;ERA.<ref name="Baseball-Reference">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/fellebo01.shtml|title=Bob Feller Statistics and History|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=July 27, 2012}}</ref>

Before the 1946 season, Feller signed a $50,000 contract for the year, including a bonus for attendance, as the Indians felt many were attending baseball games primarily to see him; he was offered $100,000 by [[Jorge Pasquel]] to play in the [[Mexican League]], but declined to leave the States again.<ref name="Sickels"/>{{rp|136}} Feller recorded his second career no-hitter on April 30, 1946, against the New York Yankees.

Feller began 1947 by setting up a [[barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] tour, pitting his own selected team against a [[Negro league baseball]] team led by [[Satchel Paige]]. Feller's team included [[Stan Musial]] and [[Phil Rizzuto]] while Paige's included [[Buck O'Neil]] and [[Hilton Smith]].

===World Series champion (1948)===
In [[1948 Cleveland Indians season|1948]], the Indians had one of their finest seasons, though Feller experienced a season that had more ups and downs. Feller was selected to represent the AL All-Stars for the seventh time in his career in the [[1948 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1948 All-Star Game]] but declined to play, feeling that his performance did not warrant selection as an All-Star. At one point he was winless for a month,<ref name="Dolgan"/> and by July 22, his record was 9<U+2013>12. [[Lou Boudreau]], the Indians' [[player-manager]], declared "we sink or swim with Feller", and continued to pick him.<ref name="Dolgan"/> Feller proceeded to go 10<U+2013>3 for the remainder of his appearances to finish the season with a record of 19<U+2013>15, a league-leading 164 strikeouts, and a 3.56&nbsp;ERA.<ref name="Baseball-Reference"/> The Indians won a one-game playoff against the [[Boston Red Sox]] to determine the team to represent the AL in the World Series; it was the first time the team had won the pennant since the 1920 season.<ref name="Sickels"/>{{rp|201}}

Feller started Game One of the 1948 World Series against the NL-champion [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]]. In the eighth inning, Feller and Boudreau appeared to have picked off the Braves' [[Phil Masi]] as he attempted to [[stolen base|steal a base]], but umpire [[Bill Stewart (sports official)|Bill Stewart]] ruled he was safe.<ref name="Dolgan"/> Masi scored the only run of the game on a Braves single.

===Later years (1949<U+2013>1956)===
[[File:Bob Feller 1953.jpg|thumb|180px|Feller c. 1953]]
After taking a pay cut to start the 1949 season, Feller pitched on Opening Day against the St. Louis Browns. During the game, he injured his shoulder and missed the rest of April. His performances were mixed in the rest of the season and he finished the year with a 15<U+2013>14 record and a 3.75 ERA.<ref name="Sickels"/>{{rp|206-211}} Before the 1950 season, Feller suggested to Indians management he take a pay cut, and did so. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg said, "He himself made the suggestion. In fact, he offered to take more than the 25 per cent maximum pay cut allowed. There was absolutely nothing to it. We all agreed quickly on the figure after Bob showed up yesterday."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/bob-feller-once-demanded-pay-cut-185949119.html|title=Big League Stew blog: Bob Feller once demanded a 25 percent pay cut|work=[[Yahoo!

On July 1, 1951, Feller recorded his third career no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers.<ref name="Antonen"/> "I was depending on my slider and I didn't begin to think of a no-hitter until about the seventh inning.

Feller started the 1952 season with three wins in his first five starts; one of the losses was an April 23 one-hitter against [[Bob Cain]], who also allowed only one hit. Feller struggled for the rest of the season, and after an argument with an umpire over a strike call in late August, manager [[Al Lopez]] shut Feller down for the season.<ref name="Sickels"/>{{rp|227<U+2013>230}} He finished the season with a 9<U+2013>13 record, a 4.74 ERA, and a rating of <U+2212>3.1 in [[wins above replacement]], worst in the major leagues.<ref name="Baseball-Reference"/> He improved the following year, winning 10 games and losing 7 in 25 starts after Lopez gave him extra days of rest between appearances.<ref name="Sickels"/>{{rp|234}} The Indians won 111 regular season games during 1954, beating an AL record previously held by the [[1927 New York Yankees]].<ref name="Encyclopedia"/>{{rp|67}} The 35-year-old Feller finished 13<U+2013>3 on the year, earning his 250th pitching victory in a May 23 win and his 2,500th career strikeout in a win on June 12.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/>{{rp|68}}

The Indians played against the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] in the [[1954 World Series]], but unlike the 1948 Series, Feller did not make an appearance. The Indians were swept in four games by the Giants.

If we had won the first or second game in New York, I was going to start Feller in Cleveland in the fourth game.

In 1962, Feller was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] along with [[Jackie Robinson]].

In 1947, Feller announced that he would pitch in the [[Cuban League|Cuban winter league]] during the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major leaguer could play in Cuba.<ref name="Cuban">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uH4hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RYsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3038,1860065&dq=bob+feller+barnstorming&hl=en|title=Veeck Says Feller Is Bothered Because Fans Are Down On Him|date=August 19, 1947|accessdate=September 3, 2012|agency=Associated Press|page=6|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal}}</ref> Feller said he would donate his profits from playing in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players' pension fund: "I want to prove I'm not going to Cuba for any selfish interest but because there is a principle involved and that is the right of any ball player to work at his chosen profession".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xkxhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=snQNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3534,1563344&dq=bob+feller+cuba&hl=en|title=Feller Would Give Cuban Profits To Pension Fund|newspaper=[[Telegraph Herald|The Telegraph-Herald]]|date=August 17, 1947|accessdate=September 3, 2012|page=20|location=Dubuque, IA|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Feller also believed it was "grossly unfair" that major leaguers who were U.S. citizens could not play in winter leagues but Latin Americans were permitted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YQUkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1CMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6445,1493266&dq=bob+feller+cuba&hl=en|title=Bob Feller Criticizes Majors for Favoritism to Cubans|date=July 5, 1951|accessdate=September 3, 2012|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Journal]]|agency=Associated Press|page=10}}</ref> Indians owner and president Bill Veeck said, "I have no comment on Bob's outside activities.

==Records==
Feller estimated that military service cost him at least 100 career wins. Based on his exceptional 1941 and 1946 seasons, it is likely that Feller would have finished his career with more than 300 wins and perhaps 3,800 strikeouts.<ref name="bullock2004">{{cite book|title=Playing for Their Nation: Baseball and the American Military during World War II|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|last=Bullock|first=Steven R.|pages=133<U+2013>134|year=2004|isbn=0-8032-1337-9}}</ref> Feller said "I know in my heart I would have ended up a lot closer to 400&nbsp;than 300&nbsp;if I hadn't spent four seasons in the Navy.

There is footage of a Feller fastball being clocked by Army ordnance equipment (used to measure [[artillery shell]] [[velocity]]) and registering at 98.6&nbsp;mph (159&nbsp;kph).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20101215/SPORTS/312150013/Keeler-Rapid-Robert-Feller-did-things-his-way-off-mound?nclick_check=1|title='Rapid Robert' Feller did things his way, on and off the mount|newspaper=[[Des Moines Register]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=December 15, 2010|accessdate=July 27, 2012|last=Keeler|first=Sean}}</ref> However, this took place in the later years of his career and the speed of the ball was measured as it crossed the plate (whereas later methods measure the speed as it leaves the pitcher's hand).

Feller and his wife, Virginia Winther, had three sons, Steve, Martin, and Bruce. The couple divorced in 1971; from the divorce settlement, Virginia received the house she and Feller had built.

==Legacy==
Of Feller's death, Mike Hegan, Indians broadcaster and son of former Feller teammate and battery mate [[Jim Hegan]], stated, "The Indians of the 40s and 50s were the face of the city of Cleveland and Bob was the face of the Indians. But, Bob transcended more than that era. In this day of free agency and switching teams, Bob Feller remained loyal to the city and the team for over 70 years.

On Opening Day of the 2011 season, the Indians invited Feller's widow, Anne, to present a silent first pitch. During pregame introductions, Cleveland players wore a No. 19 jersey in honor of Feller. For the entire 2011 season the players' uniforms were outfitted with an outline of Feller's pitching motion. The organization also made a permanent memorial of the press-box seat that Feller used in later life.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/2011-03-24-975899190_x.htm|title=Indians honor Bob Feller on Opening Day, all year|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=March 24, 2011|accessdate=May 4, 2012}}</ref>
