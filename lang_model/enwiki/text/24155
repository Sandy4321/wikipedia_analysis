'''Petar Krpan''' (born 1 July 1974 in [[Osijek]]) is a former [[Croatia]]n [[Association football|footballer]], who played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]].

==Club career==
Krpan started his career with hometown club [[NK Osijek]], and moved to [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] in 1998, being scarcely used during his one 1/2-season spell. In January 2000, staying in Portugal, he left for [[U.D. Leiria|Uni<U+00E3>o de Leiria]] and played for the club until the 2001 summer.

Krpan then returned to Croatia and played one season apiece for Osijek, [[NK Zagreb]] and [[HNK Hajduk Split]], before returning to Leiria for [[2004<U+2013>05 Primeira Liga|2004<U+2013>05]]. He was an important offensive element during the season, as Leiria barely avoided relegation from the [[Primeira Liga|first division]], notably netting in a 1<U+2013>1 home draw against [[F.C. Porto]].

In 2005, Krpan once again returned to Croatia by joining [[NK Rijeka|HNK Rijeka]], where he spent one season before moving to [[Druga HNL|second division]] side [[NK Inter Zapre<U+0161>i<U+0107>]]. In 2007<U+2013>08, he [[Tre<U+0107>a HNL|dropped down another level]] and joined [[NK Grafi<U+010D>ar Vodovod]], returning to his hometown, and retiring from football after one season, aged 34.

==International career==
In 1998, Krpan won three international caps for the [[Croatia national football team|Croatian national team]], all as a second-half substitute, his debut being on June 6, in a friendly match with [[Australia national association football team|Australia]], in [[Zagreb]].

He was a member of the bronze medal-winning squad at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], where he made one appearance, playing the last 15 minutes of the [[Round of 16|round-of-16]] match against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] (1<U+2013>0).
