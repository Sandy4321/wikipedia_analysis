The '''Somerville Community Path''' is a project to build a [[mixed-use path]] in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], from the Cambridge border near [[Davis Square]] to the Cambridge border near [[Lechmere Square]]. Roughly 0.8 [[mile]]s (1.3 km) of the path is finished and in use.<ref name=friendsmap>http://www.pathfriends.org/scp/community_path_detail.gif</ref> The two finished segments feature pavement interspersed with brick, and surrounded by grass, trees, pedestrian connections to nearby streets, and a community garden. The path is lit at night and plowed in the winter.

If completed, the project would connect the [[Minuteman Bikeway]], [[Fitchburg Cutoff Path]], and [[Cambridge Linear Park]] to the [[Charles River Bike Path]] and downtown [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. This would create connections for Bedford, Lexington, Concord, Arlington, Belmont, Somerville, and Cambridge to the proposed [[East Coast Greenway]]. 

==Route==

The "[[Alewife Linear Park]]" segment of the Somerville Community Path<ref>As described on the sign at the Davis Square end</ref> is a continuation of the [[Cambridge Linear Park]], which runs from the Cambridge-Somerville border west to [[Alewife (MBTA station)|Alewife Station]], the [[Fitchburg Cutoff Path]], and the [[Minuteman Bikeway]]. The bicycle and pedestrian paths diverge slightly just before Seven Hills Park,<ref>[http://www.somervillema.gov/Maps.cfm?page=24&pv=Yes City Of Somerville - Maps of the City<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> to pass through Davis Square. Pedestrians have grade-level crosswalks, and bicyclists are routed via nearby streets or may walk their bikes.<ref name="citymap" /> They join again at Grove Street<ref name="citymap">http://www.somervillema.gov/CoS_Content/images/city_map.jpg</ref> and continue to Cedar Street (though there is an [[MBTA]] busway linking Grove Street to College Avenue).<ref>Another sign near Davis Square calls this the "College Ave to Cedar St Segment".</ref>  

Community activists hope to finish a 2.5 mile (4.0 km) extension of the Somerville Community Path by connecting this segment to the existing path in [[Lechmere Square]] in eastern Cambridge (at the [[North Point development]].  

The next segment to the east, from Cedar Street to Central Street, is in the design phase,<ref name=friendsmap/> funded by a tourism grant from the [[Massachusetts Turnpike Authority]].<ref>http://www.somervillema.gov/Section.cfm?org=Planning&page=158</ref> This segment and the next portion, from Central Street to Lowell Street, currently consist of disused railroad tracks under a forest canopy.  A feasibility study was performed on the segment from School Street in Somerville to the Cambridge border in 2006.<ref>[http://www.somervillema.gov/CoS_Content/documents/comm_path_071406.pdf Community Path Extension Study - School St to Northpoint]</ref>

The final segment, from Lowell Street to Lechmere/North Point, is proposed to be built in conjunction with the Somerville-Medford extension of the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line light rail]]. This will mainly run alongside the active [[Lowell Line]] commuter rail tracks, except for a disused railroad right-of-way near Lechmere. The path would parallel that route, while connecting with the new stations to be built along the way.<ref>http://www.somervillema.gov/CoS_Content/documents/School%20to%20No%20Point%20Presentation.pdf Community Path Feasibility study, School St. To North Point Presentation, 2006</ref> Cooperation between the projects is mandated by the state environmental review process; preliminary drawings have been published.<ref>https://www.commentmgr.com/projects/1228/docs/Somerville Community Path-overview.pdf</ref>The Green Line extension was to be completed by the end of 2014 under an agreement to meet federal clean air requirements,<ref>http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/05/potential_green.html Potential Green Line stops announced in Somerville, Medford</ref> but the MBTA has indicated that the project might be delayed until 2016.<ref>http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/09/23/mayor_sees_chance_in_mbta_delay/ Mayor sees chance in MBTA delay</ref>

The [[Urban Ring (MBTA)|Urban Ring]] project may result in a connecting "rail with trail" path along the [[Grand Junction Railroad]] right-of-way.

==History==

The [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]] was chartered in 1830 and started service in 1835. The main line is now the MBTA [[Lowell Line]].

From near Alewife on the Cambridge-Arlington border, to Lowell Street in Somerville, the Cambridge Linear Park and Somerville Community Path follow a railroad [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] that was laid out in [[1870]], and later known as the "Fitchburg Freight Cutoff", "Somerville Freight Cut-off",<ref name="nycsubway">[http://world.nycsubway.org/us/boston/red.html world.nycsubway.org/United States/Boston, Massachusetts/MBTA Red Line<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "Somerville Freight Spur",<ref name="somervillecity">[http://railroad.net/forums/viewtopic.php?p=456458&sid=1094df7fd3a995d826e058d8b464471a RAILROAD.NET :: View topic - Abandonment of Somerville Freight Spur (ex-Fitchburg Cutoff)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  or Davis Square Freight Cut-Off.<ref>[http://www.somervillema.gov/section.cfm?org=planning&page=394 City Of Somerville - Maxpak Planning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (In the 1980s and 1990s, after the Red Line extension, there remained an active freight spur from the Lowell Line to the "MaxPak" site, where the last industrial user went out of business in 2002.<ref name="somervillecity" /><ref>[http://www.railroad.net/forums/viewtopic.php?p=307681&sid=aa7db49f2366fb15249d05f632a48c39 RAILROAD.NET :: View topic - Abandonment of Somerville Freight Spur (ex-Fitchburg Cutoff)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>)  The Boston and Lowell built the connection from its main line (at Somerville Junction, at modern-day Lowell Street<ref>"Somerville Junction Park" at the site of the former station, near the intersection of present-day Centre and Woodbine Streets, was dedicated on September 25, 2008.</ref>) to the [[Lexington and Arlington Railroad]] (now mostly converted to the [[Minuteman Bikeway]]), which the Boston and Lowell had just acquired.<ref name=worden>{{cite book|last=Worden|first=John L. III|title=Arlington's Little Local Railroad|publisher=The Arlington Historical Society|date=1991|url=http://arlingtonhistorical.org/museumshop/}}</ref>  Passenger service ran via this connection from 1870 until 1927.<ref name=worden /> There was also a connection to the [[Fitchburg Railroad]] main line, now the MBTA [[Fitchburg Line]].

After various corporate acquisitions and the decline of railroad service in the United States, the public [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] acquired the rights of way in 1973.

The existing paths were created in 1985 by the MBTA, Cambridge, and Somerville,<ref>According to the sign at the Somerville end of Linear Park</ref> in conjunction with the extension of the [[MBTA Red Line]] from Harvard to Alewife. The Davis-to-Alewife segment of the Red Line was built using a [[cut-and-cover]] method. The surface landscaping for the path was added after subway tunnel construction was complete. Between Davis and Porter, the subway diverges from the surface street pattern, using a [[deep bore tunnel]].<ref name="nycsubway"/>
