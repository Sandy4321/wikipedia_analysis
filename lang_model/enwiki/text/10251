The '''European Day of Languages''' is [[26 September]], as proclaimed by the [[Council of Europe]] on 6 December 2001, at the end of the [[European Year of Languages]] (2001), which had been jointly organised by the Council of Europe and the [[European Union]].<ref>https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=776/7.1&Sector=secCM&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&BackColorInternet=9999CC&BackColorIntranet=FFBB55&BackColorLogged=FFAC75%20</ref> Its aim is to encourage [[language learning]] across [[Europe]].

==Objectives==
The general objectives of the European Day of Languages are to:
* alert the public to the importance of language learning and diversify the range of languages learned in order to increase [[multilingualism|plurilingualism]] and intercultural understanding;
* promote the rich linguistic and [[cultural diversity]] of Europe;
* encourage lifelong language learning in and out of school.

In keeping with these aims, people, young and old, are encouraged to take up a language, or take special pride in their existing language skills. Also, those responsible for providing access to language learning are encouraged to make it easier for people to learn a range of languages, and to support policy initiatives to promote languages. There is also emphasis on learning a language other than English.

On the occasion of the day, a range of events are organised across Europe <ref>http://www.ecml.at/edl/default.asp?t=database</ref><ref>http://news.google.com/nwshp?tab=wn&q=%22European+Day+of+Languages%22&ie=UTF-8</ref>, including happenings for children, television and radio programmes, language classes and conferences. The events are not organised by the Council of Europe or the European Union nor do they allocate special funding (i.e. apart from their existing language programmes) for the day. Member states and potential partners are given a free hand to organise activities. To coordinate the activities organised at national level, the Council of Europe asks participating countries to nominate "National Relay Persons" for the day. The national relay in the UK is CILT, the National Centre for Languages <ref>http://www.cilt.org.uk/edl</ref>.

== Languages of Europe ==
{{main|Languages of Europe}}
There are about 225 [[indigenous language]]s in Europe &ndash; roughly 3% of the world's total. Most of the [[European languages]] are of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin. Since the end of the 18th century, the most widespread language of Europe (both in terms of geography and the number of native speakers) has been [[Russian language|Russian]], which replaced French. Counting only native speakers, approximately 150 million Europeans speak [[Russian language|Russian]] on a daily basis, followed by [[German language|German]] (approx. 95 mil.), [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] (each by 65 mil.), [[Italian language|Italian]] (60 mil.), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Polish language|Polish]] (40 mil. each), [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (30 mil.), [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (26 mil.) As far as foreign language studies are concerned, English is currently the most popular foreign language in Europe, followed by German, French, Italian, Russian and Spanish.

== Multilingualism today ==
{{Main|Multilingual countries and regions of Europe}}
According to the European Union survey "Europeans and their Languages" ("Special [[Eurobarometer]] 243", February 2006) <ref>http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf</ref>, 56% of EU [[citizen]]s (25 member states) speak a language other than their [[mother tongue]], but 44% admit to not knowing any other languages than their [[native language]]. However, 28% master two foreign languages. Among EU citizens, 38% indicate that they know [[English language|English]], followed by 14% mastering [[French language|French]] or [[German language|German]], 7% Russian, 5% Spanish and 3% Italian. The typical multilingual European is a student or holds a managerial position or was born in a country where a different language is spoken from the language of his/her parents.

With [[immigrant]]s and [[refugee]]s, European cities have become more multilingual. For example: in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] many recent immigrants speak [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Tatar]], [[Azeri]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and many others; in [[London]] some 300 languages are spoken ([[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Berber language|Berber]], [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] etc.). 

The European Union adheres to a policy of multilingualism, both at its institutional workings and as an aim for its citizens. At the 2002 [[European Council|EU summit]] in [[Barcelona]], it set a target for children to learn at least two foreign languages from an early age <ref>http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/71025.pdf</ref>. Multilingualism for the EU is linked to [[worker mobility]] and the European economy. The European Union spends more than <U+20AC>30 million a year promoting language learning and linguistic diversity through the ''[[Socrates programme|Socrates]]'' and ''[[Leonardo da Vinci programme|Leonardo da Vinci]]'' programmes, a policy that began with the pioneering ''[[Lingua programme]]'' in 1990.

== Criticism ==
In spite of the declared goal of promoting all European languages in all countries of Europe and the additional emphasis on promoting study of languages other than English, the official [[website]] that promotes the European Day of Languages is available in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] only (the two [[official language]]s of the [[Council of Europe]]). In addition to them, some materials that may be downloaded from that website have been made available also in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Esperanto]].<ref>[http://edl.ecml.at/Abouttheday/PDFs/tabid/1860/language/en-GB/Default.aspx European Day of Languages: Articles and documents - resources]</ref>
