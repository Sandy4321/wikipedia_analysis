He was most recently a competitor on the 15th season of [[The Ultimate Fighter]]. Rio has also won three collegiate wrestling championships (1 junior college and 2 NAIA) along with being a two-time Florida high school state wrestling champion.

==Wrestling career==
Rio was introduced to [[wrestling]] in middle school, but truly began competing at [[Miami Southridge High School]], where he went on to win two Florida state championships under high school wrestling coaches Jim Husk and Kenny Johnson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hsflorida.scout.com/2/226975.html|title=Coaching Legend: Southridge's Jim Husk Retires|work=scout.com|date=January 22, 2004}}</ref> During that time he also lead his school to two state championship wins, as well. Along with those honors, he also holds the national record of fastest pin at 4 seconds at 103&nbsp;lbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingusa.com/04%20wusa%20web%20root/oftheyearawards04/12EditoroftheYear.pdf |title=Wrestling USA: Stuart Mahler|work=WrestlingUSA.com |date=March 15, 2012}}</ref>  He was also named to the Wrestling USA Magazine National All-American High School Team as an Honorable Mention in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingusa.com/003%20wusa%20web%20root/wusahalloffame/00hsallamerican.html|title=Wrestling USA Magazine Hall of Fame|work=WrestlingUSA.com |date=May 30, 2000}}</ref>

In his first year at the collegiate level, Rio advanced to the finals of the national tournament, but lost.  The very next year, he advanced and won his first national championship at the junior college national wrestling championships for [[Harper College]] in Illinois. He then won back-to-back titles at the NAIA national wrestling championships for [[Lindenwood University]] in Missouri. He was also the only NAIA wrestler that year to defend his back-to-back title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingusa.com/02%20wusa%20web%20root/collegechampionships/naiachampionship.html |title=NAIA National Wrestling Championships|work=WrestlingUSA.com |date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tufufc.com/tuflive-coaches-1st-pick-miles-jury-mike-rio/ |title=TUFLive Coaches 1st Pick <U+2013> Miles Jury or Mike Rio|work=TUFUFC.com |date=March 15, 2012}}</ref>  Rio then finished his college career by being named Most Outstanding Wrestler of the 2006 national championship tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themat.com/section.php?section_id=3&page=showarticle&ArticleID=14185 |title=Dana College captures first ever NAIA team title|work=themat.com |date=March 5, 2006}}</ref>

===''The Ultimate Fighter''===
Having changed formats and being moved to a different network, The Ultimate Fighter's 15th season debuted live on [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] March 9, 2012 with rivals [[Dominick Cruz]] and [[Urijah Faber]] coaching the 32 potential candidates vying for a spot in The Ultimate Fighter House.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/27602/the-ultimate-fighter-15-cast-unveiled-with-32-lightweight-fighters.mma |title='The Ultimate Fighter 15' cast unveiled with 32 lightweight fighters |publisher=MMAJunkie.com |date=February 27, 2012 |accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref> In the preliminary bout to reach the house, Rio faced Northern Irish fighter, Ali Maclean, and won by submission with a rear-naked choke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmavalor.com/2012/03/09/fight-to-get-into-the-house-tuf-live-preliminary-round-live-results/ |title=Fight to get into the House: TUF Live Preliminary Round Live Results |work=MMAvalor.com |date=March 9, 2012}}</ref>  He was then chosen by current UFC Bantamweight Champion Cruz along with seven other fighters to represent his "Team Cruz" on the show.

After weeks of heavy training, a minor knee injury and a scuffle with teammate [[Justin Lawrence]], Rio's name was finally called to face Faber's British fighter [[Andy Ogle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/news/tuf-live-mike-rio-vs-andy-ogle-odds-134100565--mma.html |title=TUF Live, Mike Rio Vs.

In the last episode before the finale, it was revealed by UFC president [[Dana White]] that all the contestants in the house would fight in the finale except Ogle and Rio due to injuries. The injury to Rio being two broken ribs he suffered during his fight with Ogle.  The injury wasn't immediately noticed after the fight, instead it was discovered in training the following week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmavalor.com/2012/06/16/mike-rio-waits-for-his-turn-while-ribs-heal/ |title=Mike Rio Waits for his turn while Ribs Heal |work=MMAvalor.com |date=June 16, 2012}}</ref>  That didn't deter White, however.  He was so impressed by the calibre of talent on the show that he decided to sign them all to contracts, Rio included.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cagejunkies.com/2012/11/mike-rio-going-full-circle/ |title=Mike Rio <U+2013> Going Full Circle |work=cagejunkies.com |date=November 21, 2012}}</ref>
