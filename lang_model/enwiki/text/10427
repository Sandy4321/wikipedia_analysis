'''The American Wrestling Association (AWA) World Heavyweight Championship''' was the highest ranked championship in the now defunct [[American Wrestling Association]]. It is regarded as one of the most prestigious championships in [[professional wrestling]] history. 
__TOC__

== History ==
The AWA World Heavyweight Championship was established in May 1960, after the AWA became a separate promotion from the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], which had previously been a part of as the NWA's [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]-area presence. The first champion was [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)|Pat O'Connor]], who was recognized as the first champion upon the AWA's secession from the NWA as O'Connor held the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] as well, which he won on [[January 9]], [[1959]]. With the introduction of the championship, which had world title status for its entire existence until the promotion folded in January [[1991]], the NWA World Championship lost its status as the only World Championship of pro wrestling. The creation of a second world title would pave the way for the creation of many other world championships in other wrestling promotions.

The [[AWA Superstars World Heavyweight Championship|title]] was supposedly revived in [[1996]] in Dale Gagner's independent promotion [[AWA Superstars of Wrestling]], who relicensed the AWA name. However, [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] has sued Gagner for the use of the AWA name, citing trademark infringement, as the WWE owns the AWA tape library, trademarks, and logos.  AWA Superstars of Wrestling has claimed lineage for [[AWA Superstars World Heavyweight Championship|their world title]] to the classic AWA title and control over the title history, but because there is no connection to the original organizations or individuals involved therein, no continuity in title reigns or even physical belts, and questionable legal use of the AWA name, the claims made by AWA Superstars of Wrestling are in historical dispute and in legal jeopardy.
