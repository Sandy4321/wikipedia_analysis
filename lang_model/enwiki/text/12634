==Hinduism==
{{See|Hinduism in India|Hinduism|Hindu|Srauta|Historical Vedic religion}}
[[Hinduism]] is the largest religion in India, counting approximately 900 million adherents, comprising 80.4% of the population.   Often considered a "way of life" rather than a religion, it arose in the [[Indian subcontinent]] during the  period 2000-1500 [[BCE]].  The word [[Hindu]], originally a geographical description, derives from the [[Sanskrit]], ''Sindhu'', (the historical appellation for the river [[Indus]]), and refers to a person from the ''land of the river Sindhu''. The title Hindu was accepted by the followers of the religion (a.k.a. "Sanatan Dharma") because Hind (India) is their Fatherland and Holyland.

Hinduism differs from many religions in not having a single founder, a specific theological system, a single system of morality, or a central religious organization.   The religion is ideologically tolerant and inclusive&mdash;qualities which have enabled it to co-exist with other religions over its long history.  The main holy books of Hinduism are the [[Vedas]] (its foundation) and the [[Upanishads]]. Hindus are allowed to worship (or practice their bhagavat-dharma) God in any form and so many Hindus have even have a specific [[Purana]] for their deity (i.e. Kali Purana.)

''[[Nastika|Astika]]'' ([[IAST]]:{{IAST|<U+0101>stika}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] adjective  (and noun) that is derived from ''asti'' ("it is or exists")<ref name = MW>[[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier-Williams, Monier]], ''"Monier-Williams Sanskrit Dictionary"'', Nataraj Books, 2006, ISBN 18-81338-58-4</ref> meaning "believing" or "pious"<ref>V. S. Apte, ''A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary'', p. 240.</ref>; or "one who believes in the existence (of God, of another world, etc.)."<ref name = MW/> ''Nastika'' (''na'' (not) + ''{{IAST|<U+0101>stika}}'') is its negative, literally meaning "not believing" or "not pious". As used in Indian philosophy ''nastika'' refers to belief in Vedic authority, not belief or lack of belief in [[theism]]. In popular language the term ''nastika'' also means "atheist". As N. N. Bhattacharyya writes:

<blockquote>
The followers of Tantra are often branded as N<U+0101>stika by the upholders of the Vedic tradition.  The term N<U+0101>stika does not denote an atheist.  It is applied only to those who do not believe in the Vedas.  The S<U+0101><U+1E45>khyas and M<U+012B>m<U+0101><U+1E43>sakas do not believe in God, buth they believe in the Vedas and hence they are not N<U+0101>stikas. The Buddhists, Jains, and C<U+0101>rv<U+0101>kas do not believe in the Vedas; hence they are  N<U+0101>stikas. <ref>Bhattacharyya, N. N. ''History of the Tantric Religion''. Second Revised Edition. (Manohar: New Delhi, 1999) p. 174. ISBN 81-7304-025-7</ref>
</blockquote>

Hinduism is, in fact, an immense synthesis, deriving its elements from a hundred different directions, and incorporating every conceivable motive of religion. The motives of Hindu religion are manifold. Earth-worship, sun-worship, nature-worship, sky-worship, honour paid to heroes and ancestors, mother-worship, father-worship, prayers for the dead, the mystic association of certain plants and animals: and all these and more are included within Hinduism. And each marks some single age of the past, with its characteristic conjunction or invasion of races formerly alien to one another. They are all welded together now to form a great whole. Now and again in history a great systematizing impulse has striven to cast all or part of recognized belief into the form of an organic whole.  <ref>[[Sister Nivedita]] & Ananda K.Coomaraswamy: Myths and Legends of the Hindus and Bhuddhists, Kolkata, 2001 ISBN 81-7505-197-3, p.3-4</ref>

==Islam==
[[Image:Jama Masjid is the largest mosque in India. Delhi, India..jpg|thumb|200px|The Jama Masjid, 
[[Delhi]] is one of the largest mosques in the world.]]
{{main|Islam in India}}
[[Islam]] arrived in India as early as the 8th century A.D. During the following years, Islam contributed greatly to the cultural enhancement of an already rich Indian culture, shaping not only the shape of Northern Indian classical music ([[Hindustani]], a melding of Indian and Middle Eastern elements) but encouraging a grand tradition of [[Urdu]] (a melding of [[Hindi]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] languages) literature, both religious and secular. As of [[2001]], there were about 160 million Muslims in India (the second largest population in the world, after [[Indonesia]]), who are scattered throughout the country, with  the highest concentrations in the states of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Assam]],  [[Kerala]], [[West Bengal]] and parts of the Gangetic plain. [[Uttar Pradesh]], in the Gangetic plain, has the highest population of Muslims in one state. Muslims make up majority population in the state of [[Jammu & Kashmir]] and the union territory of [[Lakshadweep Islands]]. There are about 75 sects of Islam followed in India{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. [[Sunni Islam]] is the denomination practiced by the majority of Indian Muslims, followed by [[Shia Islam]]. 

===Ahmadiyya===
{{main|Ahmadiyya}}
[[Ahmadiyya]] is a relatively small messianic movement founded in 1899 by [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]].<ref>http://www.bartleby.com/65/ah/Ahmadiyy.html</ref> The majority of Ahmadis live in northern India, although many are found in New Delhi, Kashmir, and Uttar Pradesh. There are approximately one million Ahmadis in India. The Ahmadiyya's identify themselves as Muslims and there has been a court decision in which this was upheld.<ref>[http://www.thedailystar.net/law/2004/03/03/index.htm On right to freedom of religion and the plight of Ahmadiyas]. Retrieved on [[April 10]] [[2007]].</ref>

==Buddhism==
{{see|Buddhism in India|History of Buddhism in India|Decline of Buddhism in India|Dalit Buddhist movement}} 

[[Buddhism]], also known as ''Buddha Dharma'', originated in northern India in the 6th century [[BCE]], and rapidly gained adherents during [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha's]] lifetime.  Since, the religion was adopted mostly by the upper classes, its numbers in India remained small&mdash;in the hundreds of thousands. While the exact cause of the [[decline of Buddhism in India]] after the 9th century [[Common Era|CE]] is not known, [[Vedanta]] reform movements, which incorporated Buddhist elements into Hinduism, are thought to have contributed to it, as did [[Islamic invasions of India]], which devastated Buddhist monasteries, libraries, and statuary.  

The 20th century saw a resurgence of Buddhism in India.  In 1956, [[B. R. Ambedkar]], the main architect of the [[Indian constitution]],  and thousands of his [[Dalit]] followers converted to Buddhism to protest the Indian [[caste system]].  Buddhists form majority populations in the Indian states of [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], and the [[Ladakh]] region of Jammu & Kashmir.  In all, around 11 million Buddhists live in India today.

==Jainism==
[[Image:Jaintemple kochi.jpg|200px|thumb|A Jain temple in [[Kochi (India)|Kochi]]]]
{{see|Jainism | Jains in India according to 2001 census}}
[[Jainism]], along with Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism, is one of the four major [[Dharmic]] religions originating in India.  Dating back to the first millennium [[BCE]], the religion was well in place during the lifetime of its 24th [[tirthankar]], [[Mahavira]].   Today, Jains are extremely well-represented in the major professions, despite comprising only 0.4% (around 4.2 million) of India's population.  According to the 2001 Census of India, Jains have the highest literacy rate of any religious group&mdash;94.1%, in contrast to the national average of 64.8%.

==Sikhism==
:''Main article: [[Sikhism in India]]''
[[Image:Amritsar-golden-temple-00.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The [[Harimandir Sahib]], known popularly as the Golden Temple, is a sacred shrine for Sikhs.]] 
[[Sikhism]], was founded in India's northwestern [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] region about 400 years ago and Sikhs form the majority population in the state of Punjab. As of 2001 there were 19.3 million Sikhs in India. Many of today's Sikhs are situated in Punjab, the largest [[Sikh]] province in the world and the ancestral home of Sikhs. There are also significant populations of Sikhs in the neighboring states of [[Haryana]] and [[New Delhi]]. The most famous Sikh temple is the [[Golden Temple]], located in [[Amritsar]], Punjab. Many Sikhs serve in the [[Indian Army]]. The current prime minister of India, [[Manmohan Singh]], is a Sikh. Punjab is the spiritual home of Sikhs and is the only state in India where Sikhs form a majority.

==Christianity==
[[Image:Nasrani menorah.JPG|thumb|200px|The ''[[Nasrani Menorah]]'', the symbol of the [[Knanaya]] community in [[South India]].]]
{{main|Christianity in India}}
[[Christianity]], according to tradition arrived in India in the first century (c.52-85AD) through the [[apostle Thomas]]. The chronicle of his mission in India is recorded in the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas, and the lesser-known Apocalypse of Thomas. In these books, Judas Thomas is regarded as the "Twin" of [[Jesus Christ]] of Nazareth, alleging that since this Thomas was identical in look to Christ, he was equal in piety. The apostle completed the conversion of a Malabar prince, and founded a church on the prince's grounds. According to the Gospel of Thomas, he later was buried in the foundation of that building, located by tradition near Mumbai (formerly Bombay).

Christianity was later consolidated in India, by the arrival of Syriac Jewish-Christians now known as [[Knanaya]] people in the second century A.D. This ancient ethnic Christian community of [[Kerala]] is known as [[Nasrani]] or [[Syrian Christian]]. The [[Nasrani]] people and especially the [[Knanaya]] people within the Nasranis have strong Jewish historical ties. Their form of Christianity is one of the most ancient: [[Syriac Christianity]] which is also known as the Eastern Orthodox Church and referred to in India as [[Saint Thomas Christians]]. It should be noted that the term "Saint Thomas Christians" is a loose term that many non-Nasranis Christians in Kerala are often labelled. 

[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] reached India during the period of [[Europe]]an colonization, which began in 1498 when the Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] arrived on the [[Malabarian Coast|Malabar coast]]. There are over 17 million Catholics in India, which represents 1.5% of the total population. Christian missionary activity increased in the early [[19th century|1800s]]. Today Christianity is the third largest religion of India making up 2 - 2.9% of the population. Christianity is prevalent in South & North-east India.  Christians make up majority population in the states of [[Meghalaya]], [[Nagaland]] and [[Mizoram]].  All these states are tribal and have extremely low population when compared to the larger states in India.

==Judaism==
[[Image:Jewish synagouge kochi india.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The old [[Paradesi synagogue]] in Kochi.]]
{{main|Jews in India}}
Trade contacts between the [[Mediterranean]] region and the west coast of India probably led to the presence of small [[Jew]]ish settlements in India as long ago as the early first millennium B.C. In [[Kerala]] a community of Jews tracing its origin to the fall of [[Jerusalem]] in A.D. 70 has remained associated with the cities of [[Kodungallur]] (formerly known as Cranganore) and [[Kochi (India)|Kochi]] (formerly known as Cochin) for at least 1,000 years. The Paradesi Synagogue in Kochi, rebuilt in 1568, is in the architectural style of Kerala but preserves the ritual style of the [[Sephardic]] rite, with [[Babylonian]] and [[Yemenite]] influence as well. 
The [[Cochin Jews|Jews of Kochi]], concentrated mostly in the old "Jew Town," were completely integrated into local culture, speaking [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] and taking local names while preserving their knowledge of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and contacts with [[Southwest Asia]]. A separate community of Jews, called the [[Bene Israel]], had lived along the [[Konkan]] Coast in and around [[Bombay]], [[Pune]], and [[Ahmadabad]] for almost 2,000 years. Unlike the Kochi Jews, they became a village-based society and maintained little contact with other Jewish communities. They always remained within the Orthodox Jewish fold, practising the Sephardi rite without [[rabbis]], with the [[synagogue]] as the centre of religious and cultural life. Following trade routes established by the expansion of the [[British Empire]], a third group of Jews, the [[Baghdadi Jews]] immigrated to India, settling primarily in Bombay and [[Calcutta]]. Many of the Baghdadi traders became wealthy and participated prominently in the economic leadership of these growing cities. As a result of religious pressure elsewhere, including the [[Religious conversion|forced conversion]]s of [[Mashhad]] (''see [[Muslim Jew]]''), their numbers were increased by religious refugees. The Baghdadis came mostly from the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]], and [[Afghanistan]].

The population of the [[Cochin Jews|Kochi Jews]], always small, had decreased from 5,000 in 1951 to about fifty in the early 1990s. During the same period, the [[Bene Israel]] decreased from about 20,000 to 5,000, while the [[Baghdadi Jews]] declined from 5,000 to 250. Emigration to [[Australia]], [[Israel]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[North America]] accounts for most of this decline. According to the 1981 Indian census, there were 5,618 Jews in India, down from 5,825 in 1971. The 1991 census showed a further decline to 5,271, most of whom lived in [[Maharashtra]] and [[Kerala]].

The [[Knanaya]] and [[Nasrani]] Christian groups also have strong historical ties to Judaism.


==Zoroastrianism==
[[Image:Parsi-navjote-sitting.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Parsi]] ''Navjote'' ceremony (rites of admission into the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] faith)]]
{{main|Parsi}}
Zoroastrianism was founded by the [[Magi]] known as Zoroaster. His religion was popular on the [[Iranian Subcontinent|Greater Iran]]. 

Subsequent to the fall of the [[Persian Empire]], after which [[Zoroastrianism]] was gradually supplanted by Islam, many Zoroastrians fled to other regions in the hope of preserving their religious tradition. Among them were several groups who migrated to [[Gujarat]], on the western shores of the [[Indian subcontinent]], where they finally settled. The descendants of those refugees are today known as the [[Parsi]]s.<!--The year of arrival on the subcontinent cannot be precisely established and Parsi legend and tradition assigns various dates (936 CE, 765 CE and 716 CE) to the event.-->

In contrast to their co-religionists elsewhere, in India the Zoroastrians enjoyed tolerance and even admiration from other religious communities. From the 19th century onward, the Parsis gained a reputation for their education and widespread influence in all aspects of society, partly due to the divisive strategy of [[British Empire|British colonialism]] which favored certain minorities. As such, Parsis are generally more affluent than other Indians and are stereotypically viewed as among the most Anglicised and "Westernised" of Indian minority groups. They have also played an instrumental role in the economic development of the country over many decades; several of the best-known business conglomerates of India are run by Parsi-Zoroastrians, including the [[Tata]], [[Godrej]], and [[Wadia]] families.

As of the census of 2001, the Parsis represent approximately 0.06% of the total population of India, with a concentration in and around the city of [[Mumbai]] (previously known as Bombay).

==Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith==
:''Main article: [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s in India]]''

About 2.2 million people in India follow the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]]. They are the largest community of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s in the world. The [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> House of Worship##Delhi.2C India|Lotus Temple]] in New Delhi is one of the main symbols of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith in India.  Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s are spread all over India and have recently increased in number. The Bahai see the icons of all religions whether they be [[Krishna]] or [[Mohammed]], as the [[forms|avatar]] or incarnation of God.

==Ayyavazhi==   
:''Main article: [[Ayyavazhi]]''   
Ayyavazhi is a religion which originated in south India in the 19th century. Officially, in India, it is considered a sect within [[Hinduism]], and its followers are counted as Hindus in the census. Ayyavazhi is also viewed as a Hindu Renaissance. [[Ayyavazhi]] has transformed itself into a distinctive and recognisable religion, having made its presence felt in southern India starting in the mid 1830s. Ayyavazhi served initially also as a reformatory system in the society of [[Travancore]], which was noted, unlike any other part of India, for the rule of caste order. It has more than 8000 worship centers throughout India, mostly in the southern parts of [[Tamil Nadu]] and south [[Kerala]].   
    
Alhough it shares ideas with Hinduism, the Ayyavazhi scriptures reformulate them into versions distinct from Hinduism. The religion has separate [[Ayyavazhi mythology|mythology]], [[Ayyavazhi theology|theology]], [[Ayyavazhi holy sites|holy places]], [[Worship centers of Ayyavazhi|worship centers]] and religious [[Swamithope pathi|headquarters]].

==Atheism and agnosticism==
India is also home to a considerable number of [[atheist]]s and [[agnostic]]s. [[Bhagat Singh]], one of India's prominent freedom fighters, was an atheist.
{{section-stub}}
==Tribal religions==
There are various tribal religions in India followed by many people. Many of these tribals practice Hinduism as well to achieve [[Moksha]] or [[Mukti]].<ref>http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/books/wiah/ch9.htm</ref> However, they have some traditions separate from Hinduism. Generally the number is either quite small or the people are found in the remotest area thus they are overlooked during census-taking. However, there are a number of traditional religions praciced in India, including '''Donyi-Polo''' and '''Rangfrah'''. These religions are mainly followed in Arunachal Pradesh. '''Animism''' is also followed by many tribes in southern India and Bihar. 

'''Mahima''' is another religion followed in India. This religion is not very common but is unknown to most of the people in India. It is mainly followed by the tribal people of Orissa. The full name of the religion is Satya Mahima Alekha Dharma, which means the true path of indescribable grace. The religion is essentially monotheistic in nature. Mahimaa religion strictly prescribes the caste system, idol worship and, in its initial stages at least, was virulently anti-Hindu and anti-Vedas. The religion strictly forbids adultery, the consumption of any intoxicants, violence, and the consumption of any flesh apart from fish. Eating of food after the sunset is also a taboo. In its essence it is essentially anti-hierarchical and is anarchistic in its criticism of the existing state system of late nineteenth/early twentieth century tribal dominated Western Orissa. The religion has a monastic order. But the members of the monastic order, like Buddhist monks, do not constitute a priestly class and have no control over the lay practitioners. They have to lead a life of poverty, celibacy, piety and constant movement, as the monks are not allwoed to sleep in the same place on two consecutive nights.
