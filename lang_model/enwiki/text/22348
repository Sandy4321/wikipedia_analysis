With an interest in the performing arts, both in music and in theatre, Palmer spent time [[busking]] as a [[living statue]] called "The Eight Foot Bride" in [[Harvard Square]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]; Edinburgh, Scotland; Australia (where she met [[Jason Webley]]);<ref>{{citation|title=Controversial Musician Prepares for Local Debut|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&story_id=29563|journal=St. Petersburg Times|date=August 4, 2009|first=Sergey|last=Chernov}}</ref> as well as many other locations. She references this line of work on The Dresden Dolls' [[The Dresden Dolls (album)|self-titled]] CD, with the song "The Perfect Fit": <blockquote>"I can paint my face<br />

===The Dresden Dolls===
[[File:Amanda Palmer, Auckland, 8.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Amanda Palmer performing with The Dresden Dolls at Kings Arms Tavern in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, September 2006]]
At a [[Halloween]] party in 2000, Palmer met drummer [[Brian Viglione]] and afterwards they formed [[The Dresden Dolls]]. In an effort to expand the performance experience and interactivity, Palmer began inviting [[Lexington High School (Massachusetts)|Lexington High School]] students to perform drama pieces at her live shows. The Dirty Business Brigade, a troupe of seasoned and new artists, performed at many gigs. The invited costumed characters mingled with the crowd before and during the show, and veteran groups sometimes joined in with a choreographed stage act. Life-sized marionettes, coin-operated boys, living statues, and other undergroundlings greeted fans while circus and burlesque drew the audience into the Dolls' music, creating a participatory atmosphere that allowed the audience to experience numerous types of art simultaneously.

After developing a [[cult following]], the band recorded their [[eponymous]] debut album, ''[[The Dresden Dolls (album)|The Dresden Dolls]]'', in 2002 with producer [[Martin Bisi]] (of Indie, Brooklyn, New York fame). They produced the album before being picked up by [[Roadrunner Records]].

In 2006, ''[[The Dresden Dolls Companion]]''<ref name="DDcompanion">The Dresden Dolls Companion, by Amanda Palmer, eight foot music publishing, June 2006, ISBN 1-57560-888-X ISBN 978-1-57560-888-4</ref> was published, with words, music & artwork by Amanda Palmer.<ref name="DDcompanion"/> In it she has written a history of the album ''The Dresden Dolls'' and of the duo, as well as a partial autobiography. The book also contains the lyrics, [[sheet music]], and notes on each song in the album, all written by Palmer, as well as a DVD with a 20 minute interview of Amanda about making the book.

In June 2007, as part of the Dresden Dolls, she toured with the [[True Colors Tour 2007]],<ref>[http://www.truecolorstour.com/ True Colors Tour web site.]</ref> including her debut in New York City's [[Radio City Music Hall]],<ref name="nyt20070620">{{cite news

====The Onion Cellar and Cabaret====
Palmer conceived the musical/production ''[[The Onion Cellar]]'', based on a short story from [[The Tin Drum]] by [[G<U+00FC>nter Grass]]. From December 9, 2006 through January 13, 2007, [[The Dresden Dolls]] performed the piece in conjunction with the [[American Repertory Theater]] at the [[Zero Arrow Theatre]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. While Palmer was openly frustrated with the direction of the show, fan and critical reviews were very positive.<ref>{{cite web

A companion book of photos of Palmer looking as if she were murdered was released in July 2009 featuring photography by [[Kyle Cassidy]] and accompanying writing by [[Neil Gaiman]].

[[August Strindberg]] was indirectly referenced in a song by Palmer titled "Strength Through Music," which contains an audio clip of a web cartoon called ''[http://www.strindbergandhelium.com/ Strindberg and Helium]''. The cartoon almost exclusively quotes Strindberg's work.

In July 2007, Palmer played three sold out shows (in Boston, Hoboken, and NYC) in a rare "with band" format. Her backing band was Boston alternative rock group [[Aberdeen City (band)|Aberdeen City]], who also opened along with [[Dixie Dirt]]. In August 2007, Amanda traveled to perform in the [[Famous Spiegeltent|Spiegeltent]] and other venues at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in Scotland, and also performed on [[BBC Two]]'s ''The Edinburgh Show''. She collaborated with Australian theater company, [[The Danger Ensemble]]; both again appeared at the [[Spiegeltent]] in Melbourne and at other venues around Australia in December 2007. In September 2007 Palmer collaborated with [[Jason Webley]] to release [[Evelyn Evelyn]]'s debut EP "Elephant Elephant" via Jason's [http://www.elevenrecords.com/ Eleven Records]. In June 2008, Palmer established her solo career with two well-received performances with the [[Boston Pops]].<ref>{{cite news

But the performance turned out to be so starkly intense it could not remain a joke. So she began taking a ukulele everywhere, and before long she had recorded a full album: <U+201C>Amanda Palmer Performs the Popular Hits of Radiohead on Her Magical Ukulele,<U+201D> released last year.

That Ms. Palmer absorbed the basics in a day <U+2013> her usual instrument is the piano <U+2013> indicates one of the ukulele<U+2019>s great advantages: it<U+2019>s so easy to learn that it<U+2019>s said to be almost impossible to play it badly. Even when slightly off key, it serves as a blank canvas that can accent the character of any voice. And in the right hands, it can strip a song to its skeletal core.

As Ms. Palmer sees it, the ukulele is the zeitgeist instrument for the D.I.Y. age. <U+201C>This is the age of the democratization of music,<U+201D> she says. <U+201C>Anyone can be a musician.

===Controversies===
====Dispute with Roadrunner Records, fans' "ReBellyon"====
[[File:AmandaPalmer live.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Photo taken during her 2008 tour promoting ''[[Who Killed Amanda Palmer|Who Killed Amanda Palmer?]]]]
After the release of her music video for the song "Leeds United," Palmer sparked controversy with a post in her blog. She claimed [[Roadrunner Records]] had wanted to pull certain shots from the video that exposed her stomach, because "...they thought I looked fat." After her fans read about this, they posted pictures of their stomachs online with messages to Roadrunner, lyrics, and words of comfort. They then sent their pictures to the record label, and started a web site.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The fans coined a term for the movement: The ReBellyon, and put together a book, "The Belly Book," of over 600 pictures and stories from fans. The book was sold over the internet to fans all over the world.<ref>[http://www.therebellyon.com/The_Rebellyon/Home.html Rebellyon Web Site]{{Dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> ''[[Pitchfork Magazine]]''<ref>[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/147869-dresden-dolls-palmer-tangles-with-label-over-tummy Dresden Dolls' Palmer Tangles With Label Over Tummy <U+2013> Pitchfork]</ref> and ''[[The Guardian]]''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/dec/03/dresden-dolls-roadrunner |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=Dresden Dolls fans have had a bellyful of their record label | first=Emine | last=Saner | date=December 3, 2008 | accessdate=April 23, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100422022152/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/dec/03/dresden-dolls-roadrunner| archivedate= April 22 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> were among publications reporting on the controversy.

Partly because of the Leeds video controversy,{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Palmer attempted to disengage from her contract with Roadrunner Records, going as far as composing and performing a song called "Please Drop Me," which asked the label to free her from the contract.<ref>[http://pitchfork.com/news/34979-amanda-palmer-tells-roadrunner-records-please-drop-me/ Amanda Palmer Tells Roadrunner Records: "Please Drop Me" <U+2013> Pitchfork]</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMi7wRfmoMs Live recording (March 28, 2009) Fort Lauderdale]</ref> 

After a long legal battle between Palmer and Roadrunner, and her repetitive pleas to discontinue her contract with Roadrunner, Palmer announced<ref name="blog.amandapalmer.net-free-at-last-free-at-last-dear-roadrunner-records"/> that Roadrunner Records finally released her from their label. Her appreciation was punctuated with another new song: "Do You Swear to Tell the Truth the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth So Help Your Black Ass" as a free download to celebrate her new freedom. She repeated the announcement during an appearance on the Australian music [[Game show|quiz show]] ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]''.<ref>{{citation|title=DOWNLOAD: New Amanda Palmer Song|url=http://spin.com/articles/download-new-amanda-palmer-song|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=April 7, 2010|first=Michael|last=Sheffield}}</ref>

===="Oasis" controversy====
Palmer's song "Oasis" and its follow-up video sparked more controversy. The song's fictional story deals with an [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] fan and rape victim who has an abortion. Despite these tragic events, she states that "I've seen better days, but I don't care", and directly after, informs the listener what just happened involving her process of communicating to Oasis through [[fan mail]], first, "I just sent a letter in the mail", then, "Oasis got my letter in the mail", and finally, toward the end of the song, "I just got a letter in the mail."<ref>{{cite web

Palmer, in response, wrote on her blog "I suggested that I might be allowed to play it if I just slowed it way down and played it in a minor key. Think about it. If they heard the same lyrics against the backdrop of a very sad and liliting [sic] piano, maybe with some tear-jerking strings thrown in for good measure, would they take issue?"<ref>{{cite web

===="I Kissed a Girl" skit====
In December 2008, Palmer performed an anti-[[Proposition 8]] [[agitprop]] skit at the Henry Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles where a [[Katy Perry]] look-alike came onstage and began singing her controversial song "[[I Kissed a Girl]]," only to be interrupted, kissed, and fondled by Palmer and comedian [[Margaret Cho]]. The skit ended with the two binding and gagging "Perry," who is forced into a mock wedding with Palmer, followed by the raising of an anti-Proposition 8 banner. Palmer mentioned, on her blog, the discontent some in the LGBT community had with Perry over her exploitation of their identity in her song "I Kissed a Girl," and said she meant the piece as a protest against [[Proposition 8]].<ref>{{cite web

@AmandaPalmer When we nominated AMANDA PALMER for "Best Twitter Feed," nobody asked us the obvious question: "Which one?" She's on the Twitterz so much that she's now got at least two. But the mothership, @AmandaPalmer, is the half-million-follower-strong engine of her virality and vitality. From it, YouTube uke covers of Rebecca Black songs go platinum; kickstarter campaigns sell out; impromptu Australian streetcorner busks turn into flash mobs; Friday night boredom turns into hashtag-driven e-commerce success stories, and, occasionally, lyrics for new songs are crowdsourced. Twenty tweets is a slow day for Ms. Palmer, who has never met an at-reply she couldn't respond to with a gentle quip, a lick of encouragement, or an all-caps gasp of amazement. Unless you're dumb enough to put her famous husband on a list of unsexy celebrities <U+2013> in which case (trust us), look out. http://twitter.com/amandapalmer |date=April 13, 2012 |volume=LXXVI |issue=16 |pages=24 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref>

 | quote = About a year ago Amanda Palmer of The Dresden Dolls and Jason Webley received Myspace messages from the most unusual profile either of them had ever seen <U+2013> conjoined twin sisters, both named Evelyn. Intrigued and charmed, they began corresponding with the twins hoping to lure them into the studio. The result is an EP that sounds like something the Andrews Sisters might have recorded if they had grown up in the circus listening to new wave music.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web
