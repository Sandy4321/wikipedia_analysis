'''John Alexander "Johnny" Gee, Jr.''' (December 7, 1915 <U+2013> January 23, 1988), sometimes known as "Long John Gee" and "Whiz",<ref name=BR/> was a professional [[baseball]] and [[basketball]] player.  

Gee played [[Major League Baseball]] for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] from 1939 to 1944 and for the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]]  from 1944 to 1946.  In August 1939, he was one of the top pitching prospects in the minor leagues when he was purchased by the Pirates in exchange for $75,000 and four players <U+2013> the highest price paid by the Pirates for a player until the purchase of [[Hank Greenberg]] in 1947.  After suffering an injury to his throwing arm during spring training in 1940, his performance suffered, and he was sometimes referred to as the "$75,000 Lemon."<ref name=Lemon/><ref name=Arm/>

At six feet, nine inches, Gee was the tallest person to play [[Major League Baseball]] until [[Randy Johnson]] debuted for the [[Montreal Expos]] in September 1988.  Gee also played professional basketball for the [[Syracuse Nationals]].  In November 1946, he became the leading scorer for the Nationals in their first home game and first win as a member of the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]].

Gee also played college baseball and basketball at the [[University of Michigan]] from 1935 to 1937.  He was the captain of the 1936-37 Michigan Wolverines basketball team and struck out batters in a June 1937 baseball game.   He received the Big Ten Medal of Honor as the student in the Class of 1937 who had best demonstrated proficiency in both scholarship and athletics.

==Early years==
Gee was born in [[Syracuse, New York]], in 1915.  His parents were John Alexander Gee, Sr., and Anna Alvira (Nicholson) Gee.  At the time of the 1920 U.S. Census, Gee was living with his parents and older sister Mildred in Syracuse's 13th Ward.  His father was employed as a janitor at a school.<ref>Census entry for John Gee and family.

After graduating from high school, Gee enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1933.  While attending Michigan, he played center for the [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball]] team from 1934 to 1937.  He was the tallest basketball player in the [[Big Ten Conference|Western Conference]] at the time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Flight of Time|newspaper=The Argus-Press|date=January 29, 1977|page=3|url=}}("40 Years Ago <U+2013> Johnny Gee, Michigan captain and center, is six feet nine inches tall and the tallest basketball player in the Western Conference.")</ref>  As a sophomore, Gee was the second leading scorer on the 1934-35 Wolverines basketball team, scoring 64 points in 17 games.<ref name=BB>{{cite web|title=University of Michigan Basketball Record Book|publisher=University of Michigan|pages=26-27|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/mich/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/bkm-through-the-years.pdf}}</ref>  He added 74 points as a junior during the 1935-36 season and was selected as the captain of Michigan's 1936-37 basketball team.

Although known principally as a basketball player at Michigan, the school's baseball coach [[Ray Fisher]], who had been a pitcher for the [[New York Yankees]] and [[Cincinnati Reds]], persuaded Gee to play baseball as well.<ref name=Fisher/>  Gee was a pitcher for the [[Michigan Wolverines baseball]] team for three years from 1935 to 1937.<ref name=MBase>{{cite web|title=University of Michigan Baseball Record Book|publisher=University of Michigan|page=9|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/mich/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/bsb-recordbook-2012.pdf }}</ref>  On June 3, 1937, Gee struck out 21 batters and allowed only three hits in a 12-2 victory over the [[University of Toledo]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Johnny Gee Whiffs 21 as Wolverines Defeat Toledo Nine|newspaper=Syracuse Herald|date=June 3, 1937|page=34}}</ref>

==Professional baseball==
===Syracuse Chiefs===
After graduating from Michigan, Gee signed to play professional baseball with his hometown team <U+2013> the [[Syracuse Chiefs]] of the [[International League]].  On August 3, 1937, he threw a two-hit shutout against the [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Toronto Maple Leafs]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Gee Blanks Maple Leafs After Fussell Saves a Game|newspaper=Syracuse Herald|date=August 3, 1937|page=16}}</ref>  Gee appeared in 16 games for the Chiefs in 1937, compiling a 4-3 record and a 2.90 [[earned run average]] (ERA).<ref name=BRM>{{cite web|title=Johnny Gee Minor League Statistics & History |publisher=USA TODAY Sports Media Group|work=Baseball-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=gee---001joh }}</ref>

In April 1938, the Chiefs' new manager [[Jim Bottomley]] chose Gee as the team's opening day starting pitcher, making him the first Syracuse native to receive the honor.<ref>{{cite news|title=John Gee Is Mound Choice For Syracuse In 1st Game: Native Son Lefthander Will Oppose Ben Cantwell of Montreal Club|newspaper=Syracuse Herald|date=April 21, 1938|page=27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Syracuse Prevails, 3-1; Gee, Home Town Boy, Hurls Victory Over Montreal|newspaper=The New York Times|Date=April 22, 1938|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0D1EFA3F5C1B7A93C0AB178FD85F4C8385F9 }}</ref>  Gee allowed only six hits as the Chiefs defeated the [[Montreal Royals]], 3-1, in front of an opening day crowd of 8,000 spectators.<ref>{{cite news|title=Johnny Gee Man of Hour As He Wins First Game: Tall Syracusan Holds Montreal to Six Hits for 3 to 1 Triumph|newspaper=Syracuse Herald|date=April 22, 1938|page=20}}</ref>  Gee appeared in 32 games for the Chiefs in 1938, 30 as a starter, and compiled a 17-11 record with a 2.71 ERA.<ref name=BRM/>

In 1939, Gee returned even stronger than 1938.  He appeared in 35 games for the Chiefs, all but one as a starter, and compiled a record of 20-10 with a 3.11 ERA.<ref name=BRM/>

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
====Purchase by Pittsburgh====
By the end of July 1939, Gee had a 16-4 record and had become one of the most sought-after pitchers in the minor leagues.  Insiders opined that Gee was the best baseball player to come out of the University of Michigan since [[George Sisler]].<ref name=Lieb>{{cite book|author=Fred Lieb|title=The Pittsburgh Pirates|page=266}}(<U+201C>They said big Johnny was Michigan's top baseball prize since George Sisler, the big fish that got away from Barney Dreyfus.<U+201D>)</ref>

A reputed $75,000 was paid for Pitcher Johnn Gee, who was never able to make the grade, but most of the team's buys in the past were at comparatively modest levels.")</ref>  The purchase of Gee was called "the biggest deal made in the [International League] since Baltimore peddled [[Lefty Grove]] to the Philadelphia Athletics."<ref name=Waner>{{cite book|title=Big and Little Poison|author=Clifton Blue Parker, Paul Waner, Lloyd Waner|pages=213-214}}</ref>  Because of Gee's limited success in the major leagues, it has also been called "one of the biggest busts in Pirates history."<ref name=Waner/>

====Tallest player in the major leagues====

====1939 season====
Gee made his major league debut on September 17, 1939, against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].

====1940 season====
After Gee's showing in 1939, Pirates' manager [[Frankie Frisch]] looked for Gee to become one the team's regular starters in 1940.<ref name=PPG/>  However, Gee injured his throwing arm at the beginning of the Pirates' 1940 spring training camp and was bothered by a sore pitching arm for the remainder of the spring.<ref name=Fisher/>  Gee reportedly sustained the injury when he "opened up by throwing curves."<ref name=Ready>{{cite news|title=Pitcher John Gee Now Appears Ready|newspaper=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix|date=March 25, 1944|page=12}}</ref>  He later recalled, "I guess I just threw too hard too soon."<ref name=Ready/>

Gee remained with the Pirates during the opening weeks of the regular season, but he did not appear in any games.  In an attempt to treat the pain in Gee's arm, the Pirates reportedly "sent him to specialists all over the country."<ref name=Lieb/>  He even had two teeth removed "in the belief that this might help with his recovery."<ref name=PPG/>  On May 9, 1940, the Pirates returned Gee to the Syracuse Chiefs with an option to recall him on 24 hours' notice.<ref name=PPG>{{cite news|author=Al Abrams|title=Bucs Lose Ninth In Row: Mueller and Gee Sent to Minors; Expensive Battery Cut Loose; Strings Are Attached To Hurler, Catcher In Latest Moves|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=May 9, 1940|page=55}}</ref>  Gee's pitching arm did not improve in Syracuse, and on June 25, 1940, the Chiefs informed the Pirates that the option had been canceled.  With no room on the major league roster, the Pirates placed Gee on the voluntarily retired list for a minimum of 60 days.  At the time, Gee predicted that he would be ready to return to the Pirates when the 60-day voluntary retirement period lapsed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pirates Put Gee on Retired List|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=June 25, 1940|page=29}}</ref>

In July 1940, the Pirates optioned Gee to the [[Albany Senators]] in the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Pirates Send Gee to Albany|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 16, 1940|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F2061EFF3558127A93C4A8178CD85F448485F9 }}</ref>  Gee refused to report to Albany and was placed on the ineligible list by Pirates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Johnny Gee Faced With Suspension|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=July 24, 1940|page=21}}</ref>  Gee said at the time that he was not ready to pitch and that it was unlikely he would be able to pitch again during the 1940 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pittsburgh Returns Pitcher Johnny Gee To Ineligible List|newspaper=Syracuse Herald Journal|date=August 4, 1940|page=31}}</ref>  Instead of going to Albany, Gee went to the Vermont summer home of his college coach [[Ray Fisher]].<ref name=Fisher/>

====1941 season====
[[File:Ray Fisher.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Michigan baseball coach [[Ray Fisher]] continued to mentor Gee during his professional baseball career.]]
In the weeks leading up to 1941 spring training, Gee traveled to Ann Arbor to train with Michigan's coach Fisher and "in an effort to recover his former ability and work the kinks out from his ailing arm."<ref>{{cite news|title=John Gee Planning To Visit Ann Arbor For Basket Ball Drills|newspaper=Syracuse Herald Journal|date=January 9, 1941|page=32}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Coach Fisher to Help Gee|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 18, 1941|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30910F83A5F167B93CAA8178AD85F458485F9 }}</ref>  Gee told reporters, "I'm placing myself entirely under Fisher's directions. . . . He taught me all I know and he's the one who can straighten me out."<ref name=Fisher/>  He worked out daily with Fisher at the [[Yost Ice Arena|Yost Fieldhouse]] on the University of Michigan campus.   In late January 1941, Fisher told the press: "All the soreness seems to be out.  We don't know for sure until he starts bearing down next week, but Johnny should be a lot better pitcher this year.  He's only 25 and should have a lot of good baseball ahead of him."<ref name=Fisher>{{cite news|title=Gee's Pitching Arm Has Lost Soreness: Pirate Hurler Responding to Coach Fisher's Treatment|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 21, 1941|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E16F6355F167B93C3AB178AD85F458485F9 }}</ref> 

Gee reported to the Pirates at their [[San Bernardino, California]], training camp in late February 1941.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gee, Bauers To Test Sore Arms Wednesday|newspaper=The Daily Times|date=February 27, 1941|page=26}}</ref>  However, by late March, the Pirates optioned Gee to the [[Portland Beavers]] in the [[Pacific Coast League]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Portland to Get Johnny Gee From Pittsburgh|newspaper=San Jose News|date=March 22, 1941|page=39}}</ref>  Gee appeared in only two games for the Beavers, compiling a 1<U+2013>0 record with a 4.50 ERA.<ref name=BRM/>  The Beavers returned Gee to the Pirates on May 16, 1941, and the Pirates  immediately optioned him to the [[Dallas Rebels]] in the [[Texas League]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Gee Shifted Again; Sent to Dallas|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=May 17, 1941|page7}}</ref>  Gee was in Dallas for less than a week and did not appear in any games.

I like Dallas."<ref>{{cite news|title=Gee Blames Pirates For His Troubles|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=May 27 1941|page=24}}</ref>

In late June 1941, after Gee advised that he would probably remain out of baseball for the remainder of the season, the Dallas Rebels reassigned Gee to the Pirates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gee "Sent" back To Bucs|newspaper=The Windsor Daily Star|date=June 26, 1941|page=55}}</ref><ref name=Lemon>{{cite news|title=$75,000 Lemon Goes Back Home|newspaper=Edmonton Journal|date=June 27, 1941|page=16}}</ref>

====Retirement in 1942====
With the United States entering [[World War II]] after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, many of the best players in the major leagues were lost to military service.  Gee was designated [[4F]] and ineligible for military service due to his height.<ref name=TSNobit/><ref name=Ready/><ref>{{cite book|author=Charles N.

In 1942, Gee was assigned to the Toronto Maple Leaves in the International League.  He appeared in five game for the Maple Leafs, pitching 34 innings and compiling a 2<U+2013>2 record with a 4.50 ERA.<ref name=BRM/>  In late June 1942, Gee was optioned to the [[Atlanta Crackers]] of the Southern Association.<ref>{{cite news|title=Johnny Gee Moves Again|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=June 20, 1942|page=12}}</ref>  Gee refused to report to Atlanta and said, "My arm just isn't right."<ref name=July1942>{{cite news|title=Johnny Gee Placed on Retired List|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=July 3, 1942|page=11}}</ref>  In early July 1942, Gee applied to Commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] for voluntary retirement, and his request was granted.<ref name=July1942/>  Later that month, Gee accepted a position as a physical education teacher at Adams High School in [[Adams, New York]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Gee to Coach at High School|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 25, 1942|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00917F73B58167B93C7AB178CD85F468485F9 }}</ref>

In June 1944, the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] purchased Gee from the Pirates at the waiver price of $7,500.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|title=Adams and Jurges Among 4 Giants Who Engage in Their First Drill: Gee, Reporting Arm Improved, and Berres Also See Action|author=John Drebinger|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 3, 1945|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0815FE3C5F1B7B93C6A9178FD85F418485F9 }}</ref>  After undergoing treatment in New York for his throwing arm, Gee appeared in his first game for the Giants on July 1, 1944, retiring the side in a ninth inning as a relief pitcher against the Pirates.

====1946 season====
In early June 1946, Gee notified Giants' manager [[Mel Ott]] that he was ready and willing to resume pitching.  He reported that his arm was completely recovered and that he believed he could be successful in the major leagues.<ref name=PS2/>  The Giants invited Gee back, and he made his first start in late July, a 2<U+2013>1 win against the [[Cincinnati Reds]].  Gee pitched 8-2/3 innings, did not allow a run until the ninth inning, and went two-for-four as a batter.<ref name=PS2>{{cite news|title=Gee and Blackwell Win As Reds<U+2013>Giants Divide|newspaper=The Post Standard|date=July 22, 1946|page=10}}</ref>  A wire service report on the game opened as follows:<blockquote>"Baseball fans throughout the nation rejoiced today in the successful comeback made by Johnny Gee, the tall man with the short name.

Five days later, Gee got his second consecutive win, pitching a complete game and holding the Reds to seven hits and two runs.  After the game, the Associated Press reported that "the giant Syracusan has become one of the surprises of mid-season."<ref>{{cite news|title=Gee Beats Reds, Blackwell Loser|newspaper=The Post Standard (AP story)|date=July 27, 1946|page=9}}</ref>  In early August 1946, ''The Sporting News'' published a lengthy feature story about Gee's comeback.  The article noted:<blockquote>"The six-foot-eight-inch southpaw retired last summer after trying to cure a sore arm for five years. But so determined was he to become a winning big leaguer that he reported to the Giants a month ago.  Suddenly he disappeared, only to bob up again.  Later he explained that before giving up a good school job in Waterloo, N.Y., he wanted to be sure he was okay, so he left the Giants to pitch a semi-pro game.  Satisfied, he rejoined the team and on July 21 shut out the Reds for eight innings."<ref>{{cite news|author=Ken Smith|title=Back as Winner After Five-Year Sore Arm: Gee Whizzing Ball for Giants; Long Johnny Starts Mound Staff on Streak, Despite Voiselle's Injury|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=August 7, 1946|page=9}}</ref></blockquote>

The victory over Cincinnati in late July proved to be Gee's final win as a major league pitcher.  He appeared in his final major league game on September 26, 1946.<ref name=BR/>  During the 1946 season, Gee appeared in 13 games for the Giants (six as a starter), pitched 47-1/3 innings, and compiled a 2<U+2013>4 record with a 3.99 ERA.<ref name=BR/>

Skiddy|newspaper=Syracuse Herald Journal|date=May 15, 1947|page=43}}</ref>

During the 1947 and 1948 seasons, Gee was not permitted to play professional baseball, as he had been classified as a holdout by the Giants.<ref name=Geneva/>  Accordingly, Gee played semi-professional baseball.  In late June 1947, Gee was playing for a baseball team in [[Palmyra, New York]].  After a game in which he struck out 13 batters and allowed only three hits and one run, Gee noted that he planned to report to the Giants the following week.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gee Hurls 3-Hit Game, But Bows To Homer, 1 to 0|newspaper=The Post Standard|date=June 21, 1947|page=9}}</ref> (No record has been found indicating that Gee did report to the Giants during the 1947 season.)

====Geneva Robins====
In August 1949, Gee obtained a release from the Giants, allowing him to return to professional baseball after an absence of three years.  He promptly signed with the Geneva Robins in the Class C Border League.<ref name=Geneva>{{cite news|title=Geneva Signs Gee, Ex-Giant|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 16, 1949|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F10FB3A58177B93C4A81783D85F4D8485F9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Gee to Hurl For Geneva in Border Loop|newspaper=The Post Standard|date=August 16, 1949|page=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Geneva Signs Johnny Gee|newspaper=Syracuse Herald Journal|date=August 15, 1949|page=18}}</ref>   After one season with Geneva, Gee left organized baseball for two years.<ref name=Auburn/>

====Auburn Cayugas====
Gee made a final comeback attempt in 1951 at age 35.  In late May 1951, he signed with the Auburn Cayugas of the Class C Border League.<ref name=Auburn>{{cite news|title=Auburn Ball Club Announces Gee Signed to Pitch|newspaper=The Post Standard|date=May 30, 1951|page=12}}</ref> He appeared in six games for Auburn, compiling a 4-2 record with a 2.49 ERA.<ref name=BRM/>

==Professional basketball==
Gee played semi-professional basketball during the 1941<U+2013>42 basketball season.  He was the starting center for the Celtics in the Herald-Journal League.<ref>{{cite news|title=Celtics Open With PLAV In Cage Race|newspaper=Syracuse Herald Journal|date=December 11, 1941|page=46}}</ref>

In January 1946, a Syracuse newspaper reported that [[Turk Karam]], manager of the Syracuse Stars basketball team, was hoping to sign Gee.  At the time, Gee was a physical education instructor in [[Waterloo, New York]], and reported to be "in the best of physical condition and ready for competition."<ref name=PS1>{{cite news|title=Syracuse Stars Will Tackle Rens at Armory Tuesday|newspaper=The Post Standard|date=January 27, 1946|page=13}}</ref>  In March 1946, Gee was reportedly playing with an All-Syracuse basketball team that was combined with Karam's Syracuse Stars.<ref>{{cite news|title=Syracusans Enter Pro Promotion With Triple Bill|newspaper=The Post Standard|date=March 21, 1946|page=14}}</ref>  He also played for the Auburn All-Stars in a March 1946 games against the [[Harlem Globe Trotters]]; Gee was the leading scorer in the game with 14 points.<ref>{{cite news|title=Harlem Trotters Win Over Auburn|newspaper=Syracuse Herald Journal|date=March 28, 1946|page=4}}</ref>

Gee joined the Syracuse Nationals for the 1946<U+2013>47 season, the team's inaugural season in the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]].  (The Nationals  would become one of the original teams in the [[National Basketball Association]] when it was established in 1949.)   While playing for the Nationals, Gee  continued with his teaching job in Waterloo.  Because of his obligations as a teacher, Gee was unable to travel with the team on most road trips and appeared only in home games.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nats Return Home, Oppose Bears Tonight|newspaper=The Post Standard|date=December 10, 1946|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nationals Play Five Games on Mid-West Tour|newspaper=The Post Standard|date=January 26, 1947|page=12}}</ref>  On November 14, 1946, Gee was the high scorer for the Nationals in the team's first victory, and first home game, in the National Basketball League.  Gee scored 17 points, 10 in the second half, before he fouled out of the game.  The Nationals won the game by a 67-64 score against the Youngstown Bears in front of 1,600 spectators in Syracuse.<ref>{{cite news|title=First Cage Win For Syracuse|newspaper=The Windsor Daily Star|date=November 15, 1946|page=32}}</ref>

By January 1947, the Stars had acquired a full-time center who could play on road trips, and Gee was no longer the starting center.  However, he was reportedly "clicking" as a replacement.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nationals Make Presence Felt In Cage Circuit|newspaper=The Post Standard|date=January 15, 1947|page=11}}</ref>  In March 1947, Joe Reichler wrote a nationally syndicated story for the [[Associated Press]] about the influx of Major League Baseball players into the newly-formed professional basketball leagues.  Reichler cited Gee, [[Howard Schultz]], and [[Frankie Baumholtz]] as the first group to make the jump.  He noted: "Another who appears to prefer basketball to baseball is Long Johnny Gee, the 6<U+2013>9 New York Giants southpaw who has balked at signing the baseball club's terms and is content to star for the Nationals."<ref>{{cite news|author=Joe Reichler|title=Big Leaguers In Basketball|newspaper=Gettysburg Times (AP story)|date=March 3, 1947|page=2}}</ref>

During the 1947<U+2013>48 season, Gee played professional basketball for the Oneida Indians from [[Oneida, New York]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Binghamton To Meet Oneida Five|newspaper=Syracuse Herald Journal|date=March 1, 1948|page=3}}</ref>
