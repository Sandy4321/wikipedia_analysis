'''Brunt<U+00E1>l''' ({{IPA-cs|<U+02C8>brunta<U+02D0>l}}; {{lang-de|Freudenthal}}, {{lang-pl|Bruntal}}, [[Latin]]: ''Vallis Gaudiorum'', ''Vrudental'') is a town located near the western boundary of [[Moravian-Silesian Region]], in [[Czech Silesia]]. A suitable position in the middle of the [[Jesen<U+00ED>ky Mountains]] provides an ample number of touristic opportunities to the town. The cultural importance of Brunt<U+00E1>l lies in its possession of a Baroque castle and many historical buildings.

== Geography ==
Brunt<U+00E1>l is situated between the Hrub<U+00FD> Jesen<U+00ED>k mountains and the rolling hills of the N<U+00ED>zk<U+00FD> Jesen<U+00ED>k mountains. The town lies in a valley surrounded by several hills (''Uhl<U+00ED><U+0159>sk<U+00FD> vrch'', 672 m; ''Vod<U+00E1>rensk<U+00FD> vrch'', 599 m; ''Zadn<U+00ED> Zelen<U+00FD> vrch'', 563 m; ''Kozinec'', 639 m). The Black Creek (''<U+010C>ern<U+00FD> potok'') with its tributaries, the Oak Creek (''Bukov<U+00FD> potok''), the Mare Creek (''Kobyl<U+00ED> potok''), and the Waterworks Creek (''Vod<U+00E1>rensk<U+00FD> potok''), run through Brunt<U+00E1>l. The Mare Pond (''Kobyl<U+00ED> rybn<U+00ED>k'') is located in the middle of the town. The Oak Pond (''Bukov<U+00FD> rybn<U+00ED>k''), with a surface area of 5 ha,<ref>Czech Fishing Union. 2006. ''Fishing Waters, Non-Salmonid Waters, Bukov<U+00FD> rybn<U+00ED>k 1 A - MO Brunt<U+00E1>l 5 ha'' http://crs-ova.fishnet.cz/index.php?path=reviry/view.php&typ=m&revir=471169. Retrieved June 28, 2009.</ref> lies almost 1&nbsp;km northwest of the town. A dam reservoir the Slezsk<U+00E1> Harta, 870 ha of sheet in size,<ref>Povod<U+00ED> Odry, the State Public Enterprise. 1998. ''The Waterwork of Slezsk<U+00E1> Harta''. http://www.pod.cz/harta.html. Retrieved June 28, 2009.</ref> is located approximately 5&nbsp;km southeast of the town. There are many residues resembling volcanic activity which took place in the [[Quaternary]] era. Uhl<U+00ED><U+0159>sk<U+00FD> vrch (672 m), Venu<U+0161>ina sopka (655 m), Velk<U+00FD> Roudn<U+00FD> (780 m), Mal<U+00FD> Roudn<U+00FD> (770) and others belong among extinct volcanos. These volcanoes are a part of the Slune<U+010D>n<U+00E1> Highlands (''Slune<U+010D>n<U+00E1> vrchovina''). The Slune<U+010D>n<U+00E1> Highlands is 16&nbsp;km long and it lies southwards from Brunt<U+00E1>l to Moravsk<U+00FD> Beroun, it includes the highest mountain of the N<U+00ED>zk<U+00FD> Jesen<U+00ED>k mountains, Mount Slune<U+010D>n<U+00E1> (800 m).

== Geology ==
Brunt<U+00E1>l belongs to the Czech Massif which is the main geologic structure in the Czech Republic. Brunt<U+00E1>l lies in the Moravian-Silesian Unit which is a preplatform unit formed until the end of the [[Variscan orogeny]] (''Hercynian orogeny''). Brunt<U+00E1>l is a part of the region consisting foremost of sedimentary rocks formed during the [[Mississippian|Mississippian Epoch]] of the [[Carboniferous]] period. In terms of Czech geology, this geologic period is called ''kulm''. The mentioned region stretches from [[Brno]] to [[Krnov]].

The main geologic formations distributed across the town and its surroundings are [[turbidite]]s. The most common rock in the area is [[slate]]. In the west of the town slate enriched by [[apatite]] and [[zircon]] can be found. In the east of the town lighter forms of slate occur. [[Fluvial]] [[sand]]s and [[rubble]] together with [[deluvial]] sediments of [[clay]] and sand origin lie along the rivers and creeks. [[Eluvial]] sediments prevail in the west part of the town.

The most remarkable geologic site in the surroundings of the town is Uhl<U+00ED><U+0159>sk<U+00FD> vrch. Originally, Uhl<U+00ED><U+0159>sk<U+00FD> vrch was a [[Volcano|stratovolcano]] (''compositive volcano'') formed by both explosive and effusive eruptions, thus it is composed of [[pyroclastic|pyroclastic rocks]]. 40-80% of the mentioned pyroclastic rocks consist of [[lapilli]], 10-50% consist of [[volcanic bombs]], the rest is made from [[volcanic ash]].<ref name="Zapletal">Zapletal, Jan. 1995. ''38 - Uhl<U+00ED><U+0159>sk<U+00FD> vrch u Brunt<U+00E1>lu''. In: Ji<U+0159><U+00ED> Zim<U+00E1>k, Jarom<U+00ED>r Demek, Ilja Pek, and Jan Zapletal, ''The Guide for Geologic Excursions. Middle and Northern Moravia and Silesia'' [Pr<U+016F>vodce ke geologick<U+00FD>m exkurz<U+00ED>m. St<U+0159>edn<U+00ED> a severn<U+00ED> Morava a Slezsko]. Olomouc: Vydavatelstv<U+00ED> Univerzity Palack<U+00E9>ho, s. 39. ISBN 80-7067-537-3.</ref> In addition, it is possible to perceive a frequent occurrence of [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[xenolith]]s dated back to the [[Mississippian|Mississippian Epoch]] of the [[Carboniferous]] period. The colors of the pyroclastic rocks vary from brown to yellow. The older effusive eruptions resulted in an occurrence of [[nephelinite|nepheline basalt]] and [[nephelinite]]. The effusive phase is approximately 2.4 <U+00B1> 0.5 million years old<ref name="Zapletal" /> and therefore it dates back to the [[Pliocene]] (also called ''Pleiocene'') and [[Pleistocene]] [[Geologic time scale|Epoch]].

== History ==
The only source referring to the founding of the town is the Uni<U+010D>ov Charter issued by Czech king [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|P<U+0159>emysl I Otakar]] (1155<U+2013>1230) in 1223. There it is stated that the town of Brunt<U+00E1>l was the first town in [[Bohemia]] that had been granted [[Magdeburg Rights]] ten years before the issue of the charter. Possession of these rights shows the importance of the town because [[Magdeburg Rights]] are considered as one of the most remarkable set of Germanic [[medieval]] [[city laws]]. The reasons leading the king P<U+0159>emysl I Otakar to pursuit a founding of a new town were twofold. The northern border of [[Moravia]] had faced many attempts of colonization under auspices of the Bishops of Breslau ([[Wroc<U+0142>aw]]) so the necessity to prevent these actions was obvious. Also a discovery of ore deposits in the surroundings of Brunt<U+00E1>l contributed to establishing the town. These facts have made historians assume Brunt<U+00E1>l was founded by [[Vladislaus III of Bohemia|Vladislav Jind<U+0159>ich]], the [[Margrave]] of [[Moravia]], in 1213.

The mining of [[noble metal]]s contributed to emerging of the town significantly, which was reflected by the first appearance of [[Brunt<U+00E1>l symbols|Brunt<U+00E1>l coat of arms]] dated back to 1287. The town became a center of local crafts and [[trade]]. In addition, endowing with [[Magdeburg Rights]] Brunt<U+00E1>l was the highest appellate jurisdiction for even [[Olomouc]] until 1352. Originally, Brunt<U+00E1>l belonged to the domain of [[Moravia]]n [[Margrave]]s but in 1269 Brunt<U+00E1>l was in part transferred into the possession of the Dukes of Opava and finally they took control over the whole Brunt<U+00E1>l territory in 1318. Between 1385 and 1467 (1473) Brunt<U+00E1>l was severally mortgaged and sold. Finally, the Lords of Vrbno gained Brunt<U+00E1>l into their domain.

The first person of the House of Vrbno was John of Brunt<U+00E1>l and Vrbno, reigning from 1576 to 1577. His heirs, who had not reached their legal age at the time of the death of their father, were given the domain of Brunt<U+00E1>l in 1506 by the [[Princess]] [[Barbara]] of Opava, Ratibo<U+0159>, and Krnov upon a condition of being a close ally to the Principality of Krnov. But the Lords of Vrbno preferred ties with the Principality of Opava and therefore they managed to gain an approval from [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]] in 1523 which granted an embodying of Brunt<U+00E1>l domain into the Principality of Opava. The most important owner of Brunt<U+00E1>l domain was Hynek The Older of Vrbno reigning from 1582 to 1596 who enjoyed a respect from the emperors [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] (1526<U+2013>1564), [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] (1564<U+2013>1576), and [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] (1576<U+2013>1612). The last Lord of Vrbno was Hynek The Younger of Vrbno reigning from 1613 to 1614.

Intensive mining backed by the Lords of W<U+00FC>rbenthal led to a founding of several neighbouring towns (e.g. And<U+011B>lsk<U+00E1> Hora about 1550, [[Vrbno pod Prad<U+011B>dem]] in 1611). In addition, many kinds of [[industry]] took place at these times (e.g. smithery at [[Such<U+00E1> Rudn<U+00E1>]] in 1405 and [[Mezina]] in 1567, 7 timber mills in 1579). In May 1617 Brunt<U+00E1>l was bought by the last Lord of Vrbno John IV of Vrbno, who joined the [[Thirty Years' War|Uprising of the Estates]] and gained a rank of the Director in 1619. His close ties to the "Winter King" [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], who was John's guest in February 1620, posed him into a very dangerous circumstances after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in1620. He was forced to leave his Freudenthal possessions and escape from the country in 1620. The emperor Ferdinand II (1619<U+2013>1637) confiscated the Brunt<U+00E1>l domain and gave it to his brother Karl I of Austria (1619<U+2013>1624) who was the Grand Master (Hochmeister) of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]].

The Freudenthal domain together with other properties of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] was under the direct administration of the Grand Master and therefore a lieutenancy was established in 1625. The [[Thirty Years' War]] damaged the town significantly and after that conflict, Freudenthal has never achieved its previous importance again. During the 18th century many disasters challenged the town (e.g. the plague in 1714 and 1739, the great fire in 1748 and 1764). Neverthenless, many new baroque buildings were built during this period. Other improvements took place in Freudenthal, a new [[post office]] was established in 1748. Development of [[Industrial Revolution|industry]] could be perceived in Freudenthal during the 19th century. In terms of textile industry, Brunt<U+00E1>l belonged to the most important towns in [[Silesia]]. In 1885, a public [[hospital]] was opened as the first in [[Czech Silesia]]. In addition, many new high schools were established during the second half of the 19th century. During [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, Freudenthal was occupied by the [[Prussia#Imperial Prussia|Prussian]] Army and the Freudenthal Castle served as a hospital for soldiers.

According to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] census of 1910 the town had 8,066 inhabitants, 7,965 of whom had permanent residence there. Census asked people for their native language, 7,939 (99.7%) were German-speaking. [[Jews]] were not allowed to declare [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], most of them thus declared the German language as their native. Most populous religious groups were [[Roman Catholics]] with 7,725 (95.8%), followed by [[Protestants]] with 229 (2.8%) and the [[Jews]] with 97 (1.2%).<ref>Ludwig Patryn (ed): ''[http://www.sbc.org.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=11734 Die Ergebnisse der Volksz<U+00E4>hlung vom 31. Dezember 1910 in Schlesien]'', Troppau 1912.</ref>

After the [[World War I]], a German-led uprising took place in Brunt<U+00E1>l but it was suppressed by the Czech Army in December 1918. Between 1919 and 1924, the possessions of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] in Brunt<U+00E1>l were put under the state administration. Within the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia]], Brunt<U+00E1>l belonged to the towns with significant preponderance of German inhabitants, only a very small Czech minority lived in Brunt<U+00E1>l at that times. Not surprisingly, German [[nationalism]] gained many sympathizers among German inhabitants of Brunt<U+00E1>l, which was reflected in an attempt for uprising in September 1938. After signing the [[Munich Agreement]] on September 29, 1938, Brunt<U+00E1>l was occupied by German troops. Brunt<U+00E1>l was liberated by the Soviet army ([[Red army|Red Army]]) on May 7, 1945. In 1946 the possessions of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] were confiscated in accordance with the Decree of the President [[Edvard Bene<U+0161>]] and transferred to the [[Czechoslovakia: 1945-1948|Czechoslovak Republic]]. As was the case in most of the former Czechoslovakia, the German population was forcefully expelled.

== Education ==
A wide arrange of educational facilities is available in Brunt<U+00E1>l. Czech educational system distinguishes four basic levels of [[schools]]. A [[nursery school]] is an educational facility aimed at providing a care for children, who has turn at least 2 years, throughout a day. The second level of education (which is perceived as [[primary education]]) is represented by [[primary schools]], where attendance is compulsory for children from their 6 (in certain cases 7) years until they turn 15 years. Various sorts of [[high schools]] present the third level of Czech educational system (which is perceived as [[secondary education]]). Individual schools placed in the mentioned category differs in their specialization one another. The supreme level of school system is a [[university]] (which is perceived as [[higher education]]).

According to the mentioned scheme, it is possible to distinguish schools located in Brunt<U+00E1>l as follows. There are 6 nursery schools, 5 primary schools, and 6 high schools. In addition, the Business School Ostrava (a private-owned [[university]] style institution) has placed its consultation center into Brunt<U+00E1>l. Therefore Brunt<U+00E1>l inhabitants were given a chance to study a [[university]] in their own town. Moreover, a special school (in Czech terminology called ''Speci<U+00E1>ln<U+00ED> <U+0161>kola'') provides an education for Brunt<U+00E1>l children with specific health difficulties (e.g. mentally affected children). There is also an art school in Brunt<U+00E1>l. However, the Czech term ''Art School'' refers to a facility operating mostly on the levels of [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], which is independent of both primary and high schools.

Another notable educational facility is the House of Children and Youth (in Czech terminology ''D<U+016F>m d<U+011B>t<U+00ED> a ml<U+00E1>de<U+017E>e''). This facility is aimed at providing various [[leisure|leisure activities]] for [[children]] (6<U+2013>15 years), [[Adolescence|young people]] (15-18), and [[adults]] of all ages. Understandably, attendance to this type of educational facility is entirely optional. The current sorts of activities offered by the House of Children and Youth vary from [[sports]] ([[belly dancing]], [[volleyball]], [[gymnastics]], etc.) to [[fine arts]] ([[pottery]], playing various musical instruments).
