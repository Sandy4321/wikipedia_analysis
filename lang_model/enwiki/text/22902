'''Chicago Midway International Airport''' {{airport codes|MDW|KMDW|MDW}}, also known simply as '''Midway Airport''', is an [[airport]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[United States]], located on the city's southwest side, eight miles from Chicago's [[Chicago Loop|Loop]]. The airport's current [[IATA code]] "MDW" has been in use since it was implemented in 1949 when Chicago Municipal Airport was renamed Chicago Midway Airport. It is bordered by (clockwise from N) 55th Street, Cicero Avenue (terminal entrance), 63rd Street, and Central Avenue. The airport's northern half is within the [[Garfield Ridge, Chicago|Garfield Ridge]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]], and the southern half is within the [[Clearing, Chicago|Clearing]] community area. The airport is managed by the Chicago Airport System, which also oversees operations at [[O'Hare International Airport]] and [[Gary/Chicago International Airport]]. Midway is heavily used by [[low-cost carrier]]s, such as [[AirTran Airways]], [[ATA Airlines]], and [[Southwest Airlines]], and to a lesser extent by [[legacy carrier]]s, such as [[Continental Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[Northwest Airlines]]. Both the [[Stevenson Expressway]] and [[Chicago Transit Authority|Chicago Transit Authority's]] [[Chicago 'L' |"L" Train]] [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange Line]] provide passengers easy access to downtown [[Chicago]].

Chicago Midway Airport is the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest passenger airport in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]], and is the 2<sup>nd</sup> busiest in the state after [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare International Airport]]. In 2006, 18,868,388 passengers traveled through Chicago-Midway, second behind [[O'Hare International Airport]], and ahead of [[Gary/Chicago International Airport]] and [[Chicago/Rockford International Airport]]. In 2005, Chicago Midway International Airport was the 30<sup>th</sup> busiest airport in the United States in terms of passenger traffic. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aci-na.org/asp/traffic.asp?art=215
| title = 2005 North America Final Traffic Report : Total Passengers| publisher =Airports Council International North America| date = 2007-04-08}}</ref> In its 80 year history of passenger traffic, Midway Airport has had 21 incidents and accidents, and only one since [[1976]].

Today, Midway Airport serves as a [[focus city]] for [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]-based [[Southwest Airlines]] <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.southwest.com/about_swa/press/factsheet.html
| title = Southwest Airlines Fact sheet| publisher =Southwest Airlines | date = 2007-04-08}}</ref> and [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]-based [[AirTran Airways]], and is also the main operations base for [[ATA Airlines]] (ATA), which, in addition to its domestic network, flies internationally from Midway to cities in [[Mexico]]. [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]] is the dominant carrier at Midway, controlling 29 of the airport's 43 gates. Currently, the airline offers 218 daily departures to 47 destinations. [[AirTran Airways|AirTran]] is the second largest carrier at Midway, offering 27 daily nonstop flights to 9 destinations. [[AirTran Airways|AirTran]] has continued its Chicago (Midway) expansion in recent months with the additions of new nonstop flights to [[Southwest Florida International Airport|Fort Myers]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], and [[Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]].<ref>{{cite web | url =

== History ==
===Early history===
Originally named '''Chicago Air Park''' <ref>{{cite web | url =http://destinations.usatoday.com/chicago/transportation/| title = Chicago Transportation: Chicago Midway Airport | publisher =USATODAY.com | date = 2007-05-12}}</ref>, Midway Airport was built on 320 acres in 1923 and consisted of a single [[cinder]] runway that primarily served [[airmail]] services. In 1926, the [[Chicago City Council]] leased the land for commercial purposes from the [[Chicago#Education|Chicago Board of Education]] at a rate of $1560 per year. <ref>{{cite web | url =http://destinations.usatoday.com/chicago/transportation/| title = Chicago Transportation: Chicago Midway Airport | publisher =USATODAY.com | date = 2007-05-12}}</ref> On December 12, 1927, Midway was dedicated as "'''Chicago Municipal Airport'''" by [[Mayors of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[William H. Thompson]] <ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.flychicago.com/news/pdf/MDWVisitorsGuide2005Revised.pdf| title = Midway Airport Visitors Guide (History Section) | publisher =FlyChicago.com | date = 2007-05-12}}</ref>, and became known as "Munie" to many early pilots. The unique one square mile footprint of Midway Airport is due to its connection to the Chicago Board of Education.  When the state of [[Illinois]] was created, land was divided into townships and each [[Township (United States)|township]] included a section (one square mile or 640 acres) devoted to education and in most instances the one room school houses were located on this land, the balance of which was farmed to provide funds for the operation of the school.  As township school districts consolidated, much of this excess land was sold for other purposes but the Chicago Board of Education continued to own the Midway Airport section and rent it to the City of Chicago for airport operations until the early 1980s when an education funding crisis forced the Board of Education to sell the land to the City. 
[[Image:MidwayHistory1.gif|thumb|left|<center>Chicago Midway Airport (formerly Chicago Municipal Airport) as it looked in 1927</center>]]

During its first full year of operation in 1928, the airfield was home to twelve [[hangar]]s and four runways, lit for night operations. Air traffic control was handled by flagmen, who would be positioned at the end of the runways, where they were responsible that year for controlling 14,498 flight operations carrying 41,660 passengers. <ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.flychicago.com/news/pdf/MDWVisitorsGuide2005Revised.pdf| title = Midway Airport Visitors Guide (History Section) | publisher =FlyChicago.com | date = 2007-05-12}}</ref> The official observation site for Chicago's weather records was also moved to Midway during that year from the downtown area and would remain there until it was moved again, this time to O'Hare, in 1958.

[[Image:KMDW Airport Map.png|thumb|right|<center>Midway Airport Diagram<center>]]
[[Image:MDWModern.jpg|thumb|right|<center>The former Main Terminal entrance of<br>Chicago Midway Airport before the<br>airport's recent expansion project</center>]]
A new passenger terminal and administration building, funded by a bond issue, was dedicated in 1931 by [[Mayors of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Anton Cermak]] and in the following year, Midway Airport earned the title of "World's Busiest" with over 100,846 passengers riding on 60,947 flights. <ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.flychicago.com/news/pdf/MDWVisitorsGuide2005Revised.pdf| title = Midway Airport Visitors Guide (History Section) | publisher =FlyChicago.com | date = 2007-05-12}}</ref> Midway held that title for three decades until O'Hare claimed it in 1962.

In 1941, Midway Airport joined [[World War II]] efforts because of its long runways and mid-continent position. <ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.flychicago.com/news/pdf/MDWVisitorsGuide2005Revised.pdf| title = Midway Airport Visitors Guide (History Section) | publisher =FlyChicago.com | date = 2007-05-12}}</ref> The war years proved to be a boom for Midway, which saw new construction funded in part by $1 million in Federal monies from the [[Works Progress Administration]], and work on additional runways moved forward in 1941 when a court ordered the [[Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad]] to reroute tracks in the vicinity of the airfield. Midway handled a full 25% of the Nation's 417,000 passengers during that year. 

The airport was officially renamed on July 8, 1949, by a unanimous vote in the City Council, to "Chicago Midway Airport" in honor of the [[World War II]] [[Battle of Midway]] (and not after [[Midway Airlines (ML)|Midway Airlines]] as many thought) <ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.flychicago.com/news/pdf/MDWVisitorsGuide2005Revised.pdf| title = Midway Airport Visitors Guide (History Section) | publisher =FlyChicago.com | date = 2007-05-12}}</ref>, and saw 3.2 million passengers carried on 223,000 flights during that year. The number of passengers rose to 3.5 million the next year and reached a height of 10 million in 1959. This [http://youtube.com/watch?v=Cm66qtg65DY Video of Chicago Midway Airport in 1954] helps show the increase in traffic that Midway Airport experienced throughout the 1950s. However, by 1959, the airport had proved unable to handle larger aircraft and higher passenger loads. By 1961, the airport faced a 60% drop in passenger traffic, largely due to the opening of O'Hare in 1955. United Airlines, the first major carrier to serve Midway, ceased operations at the airport, the last remaining carrier to do so during this period of decline.

===Post O'Hare History===
By 1967, reconstruction had begun at the airport, adding three new concourses with 28 gates and three ticket counters <ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.flychicago.com/news/pdf/MDWVisitorsGuide2005Revised.pdf| title = Midway Airport Visitors Guide (History Section) | publisher =FlyChicago.com | date = 2007-05-12}}</ref>, and in 1968, the City invested $10 million in renovation funds. The funds partly supported construction of the [[Stevenson Expressway]], which proved to be a major route for passengers to the airport, and Midway saw the return of major airlines during that year, serving 1,663,074 passengers on more than 274,062 flights <ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.flychicago.com/news/pdf/MDWVisitorsGuide2005Revised.pdf| title = Midway Airport Visitors Guide (History Section) | publisher =FlyChicago.com | date = 2007-05-12}}</ref>, aided in part by the introduction of jets, such as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]], [[Boeing 727]], and [[Boeing 737]], that were capable of using Midway's shorter runways, which the [[Boeing 707]] and [[Douglas DC-8]] could not.

In 1979, [[Midway Airlines (ML)|Midway Airlines]] began operations <ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.flychicago.com/news/pdf/MDWVisitorsGuide2005Revised.pdf| title = Midway Airport Visitors Guide (History Section) | publisher =FlyChicago.com | date = 2007-05-12}}</ref>, the first to do so after the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] of 1978, and went on to become the flagship carrier at Midway before ending its operations in 1991. Midway Airlines helped revitalize the airport and led the way for other discount carriers, who benefitted from Midway's lower costs and close proximity to Chicago's Loop, to prosper. [[Southwest Airlines]], which began operations at Midway in 1985 <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.southwest.com/about_swa/press/factsheet.html#Top%20Ten%20Airports
| title = Southwest Airlines Fact Sheet| publisher =Southwest Airlines| date = 2007-05-12}}</ref>, was one such beneficiary. Three years earlier, in 1982, the City of [[Chicago]] purchased Midway Airport from the Chicago Board of Education for $16 million. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.flychicago.com/events/KidsPage2006/MidwayHistory.shtm
| title = History of Midway International Airport| publisher =Fly Chicago| date = 2007-04-28}}</ref>

The [[Chicago Transit Authority]] displaced the Carlton Midway Inn to open a new [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|CTA terminal]] at the airport on October 31, 1993 for the newly established [[Chicago 'L']] [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange Line]], which connected Midway to Chicago's Loop. <ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.flychicago.com/news/pdf/MDWVisitorsGuide2005Revised.pdf| title = Midway Airport Visitors Guide (History Section) | publisher =FlyChicago.com | date = 2007-05-12}}</ref> The CTA's Orange Line connects Chicago Midway International Airport to [[downtown Chicago]] via elevated train transportation. Midway Airport is the terminus of the line, which traverses the southwest portion of the city before ending up in the loop and cycling back to Midway again. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/44185/midway_airport_in_chicago_train_and.html | title = Midway Airport in Chicago: Train and Bus Transportation - Connecting with Chicago's Other Airport| publisher = AssociatedContent.com| date = 2007-05-13}}</ref> The Orange Line does not run 24 hours a day, but does operate extensive hours from about 4:00 A.M. to 1:00 A.M., running at an average of 8 minute intervals. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/44185/midway_airport_in_chicago_train_and.html | title = Midway Airport in Chicago: Train and Bus Transportation - Connecting with Chicago's Other Airport| publisher = AssociatedContent.com| date = 2007-05-13}}</ref>

===Recent History===
In 1996, Chicago [[Richard M. Daley|Mayor Richard M. Daley]] announced the historic Midway Airport Terminal Development Program, which was launched the next year. At the time, it was the largest public works project in the state.<ref>{{cite web | url =
http://www.thetracon.com/MidwayHistory.htm| title = Early History/Post O'hare history| publisher =The Tracon | date = 2007-04-06}}</ref> The Midway Airport Parking Garage opened in 1999, bringing covered parking to the airport for the first time. The garage, offering 3,000 hourly and daily parking spaces, is connected to the Midway Terminal Building for convenient access to ticket counters and baggage claim areas. 
[[Image:Midway Airport Terminal (Allen Yao).jpg|thumb|left|<center>Midway Airport's new passenger terminal. In the background are ticket counters for Southwest Airlines, Frontier Airlines, and Delta Air Lines.</center>]]

Continuing with the expansion project, in 2000, a pedestrian bridge over Cicero Avenue was constructed. The bridge connects the new terminal to the new concourses. In 2001, the new 900,000 square foot (84,000 square meter) Midway Airport terminal building opened, offering expanded ticket counters, spacious baggage claim areas, traveler information and a short walking distance to airline gates. A 50,000 square-foot food court opened with Chicago-style food and retail options, and in 2002, Midway welcomed the return of direct international service after a 40-year absence with the opening of the new Federal Inspection Service facility in [[Chicago Midway International Airport#Concourse A|Concourse A]].<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/midway/| title = New Midway Terminal| publisher =Airport-Technology.com | date = 2007-04-06}}</ref> 

In June 2004, Mayor Daley and airline officials celebrated the completion of the Terminal Development Program. The expansion project resulted in the addition of 14 gates (from 29 to 43), with the airport now providing 43 gates on 3 concourses. A new 6,300 space economy parking garage, including a new bridge and roadway used exclusively for buses shuttling passengers to and from the terminal opened in December 2005. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.flychicago.com/events/KidsPage2006/MidwayHistory.shtm
| title = History of Midway International Airport| publisher =Fly Chicago| date = 2007-04-28}}</ref> 

Simultaneous to Midway's expansion, [[ATA Airlines]] began rapid expansion at Chicago-Midway in the early 2000s, and prior to 2004, ATA offered significant scheduled service to destinations from Midway Airport and was the airport's dominant carrier, occupying and operating 14 of the 17 gates in [[Chicago Midway International Airport#Concourse A|Concourse A]]. However, after the airline declared bankruptcy in October 2004, scheduled service from Midway significantly decreased. Due to repeated cancellations to its schedule, [[ATA Airlines|ATA]] now offers only 20 daily non-stop flights to 7 destinations, and mainly operates out of only 2 gates in [[Chicago Midway International Airport#Concourse B|Concourse B]]. Recently, on May 11, 2007, the airline added new service from Chicago to Oakland and Ontario, California. These new additions mark the first time ATA has increased service at Chicago-Midway in almost three years.

Both [[American Airlines]] <ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.usatoday.com/sky/2006/05/american_to_pul.html
| title = American to pull out of Chicago Midway| publisher =USA Today | date = 2007-04-06}}</ref> and [[United Airlines]] <ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.usatoday.com/sky/2006/06/united_to_pull_.html
| title = United to pull out of Chicago Midway| publisher =USA Today | date = 2007-04-06}}</ref> ended all scheduled service to Midway in September 2006, in favor of concentrating Chicago-area operations at the larger nearby [[O'Hare International Airport]]. However, despite its small size compared to O'Hare, Midway is still a vital Chicago transportation terminal. Its key advantage is that it is closer to the Loop than [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]]. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/44185/midway_airport_in_chicago_train_and.html | title = Midway Airport in Chicago: Train and Bus Transportation - Connecting with Chicago's Other Airport| publisher = AssociatedContent.com| date = 2007-05-13}}</ref> Depending on where you embark or disembark in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]], the average train ride on the [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange Line]] to Chicago Midway International Airport is about 20 - 25 minutes. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/44185/midway_airport_in_chicago_train_and.html | title = Midway Airport in Chicago: Train and Bus Transportation - Connecting with Chicago's Other Airport| publisher = AssociatedContent.com| date = 2007-05-13}}</ref>

===New airlines===
[[Big Sky Airlines]] announced on November 1, 2006, the commencement of scheduled service nonstop flights between [[Springfield, Illinois]], and Midway to start on December 3. Four weekday flights will be offered, with two flights being offered on the weekends. Big Sky recently also announced they would begin a daily nonstop flight to [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]] beginning on March 17.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bigskyair.com/| title = Big Sky Airlines Service | publisher =Big Sky Airlines | date = 2007-04-06}}</ref>

[[Air Midwest]], a subsidiary of [[Mesa Air Group]], also confirmed that scheduled service flights would commence between Midway and [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]] and [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]], [[Illinois]] on February 1, 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20061107/ai_n16823275| title = Air Midwest Service | publisher =Chicago Sun Times | date = 2007-04-06}}</ref>

===Previous airline service===
Before the rise of O'Hare in the late 1950s, Midway was the [[world's busiest airport]] and one of the key hubs in the U.S. airline system. [[United Airlines]] was headquartered at Midway in the pre-O'Hare days, and [[American Airlines]] was originally based at Midway until it moved its headquarters to [[New York City]] in the mid-[[1930s]]. There was also a very large presence from [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] and [[Eastern Air Lines]], as well as several others. The airport was extensively renovated in [[1958]] and, again, in [[1967]], after in which several of the [[legacy carrier]]s resumed service after a period of some years. Midway was also a hub for the startup [[Midway Airlines (ML)|Midway Airlines]] in the 1980s, and a focus city for former [[Vanguard Airlines]] from 1997 - 2000.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2775.html| title = Midway Airlines | publisher =Encyclopedia of Chicago | date = 2007-04-27}}</ref>

== Airfield ==
[[Image:Midway Airport Runway 4R (Brett B. Despain).jpg|thumb|right|<center>Runway 4R at Chicago's Midway Airport.<br>In the background is the [[Chicago]] skyline.</center>]] 

The original fully-developed [[1940s]] layout included 8 [[runway]]s that crisscrossed the 8-block-by-8-block (one square mile) property. All terminals and hangars were on the square periphery. By the late [[1970s]] the shorter north-south and east-west runway pairs had been closed. 4 of the original runways remain, all significantly strengthened and enhanced, but essentially the same lengths as always. A short runway for light aircraft was added in [[1989]].
 
Chicago Midway International Airport covers 650 acres and currently has five runways: <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.airnav.com/airport/KMDW
| title = MDW FAA Information Effective 15 March 2007| publisher =AirNav| date = 2007-04-28}}</ref> 
* Runway 13C/31C: 6,522 x 150 ft. (1,988 x 46 m), air carrier runway, [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] equipped.
* Runway 4R/22L: 6,446 x 150 ft. (1,965 x 46 m), air carrier runway, ILS equipped.
* Runway 4L/22R: 5,507 x 150 ft. (1,679 x 46 m), general aviation & air taxi.
* Runway 13L/31R: 5,141 x 150 ft. (1,567 x 46 m), general aviation & air taxi.
* Runway 13R/31L: 3,859 x 60 ft. (1,176 x 18 m), light aircraft only.

Because Midway is surrounded by buildings and other development, the landing thresholds of the runways are [[Displaced threshold|displaced]] to provide a proper obstacle clearance. Both the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] and the airlines assure safety by limiting loads and adhering to adjusted weather minimums. Also because of displaced thresholds the runways are actually a lot shorter in terms of take-offs and landings. 13C/31C, the longest runway, only has a maximum take-off and landing distance of 6059 feet, and on the opposite end of the runway the maximum take-off and landing distance is 5826 feet. All the other runways have a maximum take-off and landing distance below 5930 feet.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.airnav.com/airport/KMDW

== Airlines and destinations ==

The carriers transporting the most passengers from Chicago Midway Airport are [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]], [[AirTran Airways|AirTran]], and [[ATA Airlines|ATA]]. These airlines, along with the 6 other airlines that serve Chicago-Midway make up the passenger traffic. In 2006, these airlines carried a total of 18,868,388 passengers through MDW, a 5.6% increase over the previous year. Also in 2006, 298,548 aircraft passed through Midway Airport, a 3.1% increase over 2005. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.flychicago.com/statistics/stats/December2006FinalSummary.pdf

=== Incidents Involving Chicago Midway Airport ===
On [[June 30]] [[1956]] [[United Airlines Flight 718]], a [[Douglas DC-7]], was headed for Midway Airport. Over the [[Grand Canyon]] it collided with a [[TWA]] [[Lockheed Constellation|Super Constellation]] killing all 128 people on both planes. This became the impetus for the modern air traffic control system.

=== December 8 Incidents ===

On [[December 8]] [[1972]], [[United Airlines Flight 553]], a [[Boeing 737-200]], crashed into a residential area outside of Midway during landing. The crash of the 737-200 killed 43 of the 61 on board, and two on the ground.

Exactly 33 years later, on [[December 8]] [[2005]], [[Southwest Airlines Flight 1248]], a [[Boeing 737-700]] inbound from [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport|Baltimore-Washington International Airport]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], slid off the runway while attempting to land at the airport in heavy snow and winds. The airplane broke through the barrier fence of the airport and came to rest in the intersection of 55th Street and Central Avenue bordering the airport at its northwest corner.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=1388217 | title = Jet Slides Off Runway at Chicago's Midway | publisher = ABC News | date = 2005-12-08}}</ref> A 6-year-old boy was killed as a passenger in a vehicle that was struck by the plane after it skidded into the street.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=1388565 | title = Jet Slides Off Chicago Runway; Boy Dies | publisher = ABC News | date = 2005-12-08}}</ref>
