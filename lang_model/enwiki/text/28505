== Early life ==
[[File:Flowers in a Green Vase by Leon Dabo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Flowers in a Green Vase,'' Pastel]]
Dabo, the eldest of three brothers (he also had five sisters), was possibly born in [[Paris]], France<ref>Ignatius Schott family, The 1880 U.S. Census, Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan, p.64A</ref><ref>Sweeney, J. Gray (1987). Artists of Michigan from the Nineteenth Century. Muskegon Museum of Art. p.155</ref> but recently available documents state he was born in [[Saverne]].<ref name="optants"/> His father [[Ignace Scott Dabo]] was a professor of [[aesthetics]] and a [[classics|classical scholar]], who moved the family to [[Detroit, Michigan]] in 1870 to escape the [[Franco-Prussian War]].<ref name="aw">{{cite book | title=After Whistler: The Artist and His Influence on American Painting | first=Linda (editor) | last=Merrill | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2003 | isbn=0-300-10125-2 | page=168 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=zQBQaaQVbz0C&pg=RA1-PA251&dq=leon+dabo}}</ref><ref>Ignatius Schott family, The 1870 U.S. Census, Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan, p.37-38</ref> He supplemented Leon's formal education with [[Latin]], [[French language|French]], and drawing. After his father's death in 1883, the Dabo family moved to [[New York City]], whereupon he found a job as an architectural designer, working to support the family so that his younger brother Scott, who was considered the talented one, could focus on his art.<ref name="today"/> He then became a student of [[John LaFarge]], and the two of them would remain close friends until LaFarge's death. When Dabo decided to pursue studies in [[Paris]], LaFarge wrote letters of introduction, enabling Dabo to meet [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], who would become his mentor, and to gain entry to the [[<U+00C9>cole nationale sup<U+00E9>rieure des arts d<U+00E9>coratifs]]. He also studied part-time at the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie Colarossi]] and the [[<U+00C9>cole des Beaux-Arts]]. Although [[Impressionism]] was gaining hold at this time, Dabo did not find that movement to his taste.<ref>Narodny, p. 34</ref>

Dabo also studied briefly at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Munich]], but the nascent form of [[German Expressionism]] did not appeal to him and he moved on to [[Italy]], where he stayed for three years. This was followed by a year in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France, studying [[color]] with [[<U+00C9>mile Lauge]], a [[physicist]]. Finally, he spent some time in [[London]] around 1886, where he made the acquaintance of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], who also apparently was a fellow student of [[Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre]] with Dabo's father. Whistler would have a profound influence on Dabo's style.<ref name="aw">{{cite book | title=The Life of James McNeil Whistler, 5th Edition | first=Joseph | last=Pennell | publisher=J. B.

While in London, Dabo met Mary Jane "Jennie" Ford, they married in 1889 and the couple had two children: Madeleine Helen (b. 1891), Leon Ford "George" (b. 1892),<ref name="whos">{{cite book | title=Who's who in New York (City and State) | first=Lewis Randolph | last=Hamersly | coauthors=Leonard, John W.; Mohr, William Frederick; Knox, Herman Warren; Holmes, Frank R.; Downs, Winfield Scott | publisher=L.

== Artistic success ==
He returned in New York in 1890 and began his career as a [[mural]]ist, but by the beginning of the 20th century had turned to painting landscapes instead. For years, Dabo's paintings were rejected for exhibition by the major juries of the United States, until respected French painter [[Edmond Aman-Jean]] recognized his talents and began showing Dabo's work in France, whereupon he became a major success.<ref name="today"/> His work was on display in museums all around the world, including [[Mus<U+00E9>e du Luxembourg]], the [[National Gallery of Canada]], the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in Manhattan, and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Boston.<ref name="time">{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,787709,00.html | title=Simple Things | date=May 25, 1931 | publisher=Time | accessdate=2008-12-11}}</ref> Noted critics such as [[Sadakichi Hartmann]], [[Royal Cortissoz]] and [[J.

As Dabo's success grew, it was met with by jealousy on the part of Scott. By all accounts, Leon consistently championed his brother's work and the two of them often exhibited together. He even held [[power of attorney]] to act as Scott's representative with prospective buyers in Europe. When Scott went to study in Paris in 1902, Leon wrote letters of introduction on his behalf. However, reviews in the press were usually more favorable to Leon, buyers were more interested in Leon's work, and it sold for more as well. Finally at one point, the youngest brother Louis returned from Europe with a new power of attorney statement placing himself in charge of Scott's work, charging that Leon had imitated Scott's style, undermined him with buyers, and misappropriated the proceeds from the sales of Scott's work. Although the Dabo sisters sided with Louis and Scott, Leon simply refuted the charges and ''[[The New York Times]]'' did not much stock into Louis' statements.<ref>{{cite news | title=BROTHERS IN ART AT LOGGERHEADS | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0DE5DE1738E033A25757C2A9659C946697D6CF | publisher=The New York Times | date=March 24, 1907 | accessdate=2008-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=DABO FAMILY ROW ON BROTHER'S ART | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C01E5DE1F3AE133A25755C2A9659C946697D6CF | publisher=The New York Times | date=March 26, 1907 | accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>

Aligning himself with the insurgents of the art world, Dabo participated in the "Exhibition of Contemporary Art" at the [[National Arts Club]] in 1908.<ref>"ART EXHIBITS AT THE CLUBS," The Evening Mail (January 6, 1908) p.6</ref>  Later that year he showed with the [[Allied Artists' Association]], a newly organized artist group in London mounting non-juried exhibitions.<ref>"THE LONDON SALON," The Queen (July 18, 1908) p.137</ref>  In 1909 he curated and participated in an art exhibition for the [[Rand School of Social Science]]<ref>"NOTES OF THE ART WORLD" The New York Herald (May 14, 1909) p.9</ref> and in 1910, he participated in the "[[Exhibition of Independent Artists]]" held by members of the [[Ashcan School]].<ref>"WITH THE INDEPENDENT ARTISTS," The Evening Mail (April 4, 1910) p.7</ref>  In that same year Dabo became the leader of [[The Pastellists]], a somewhat radical artist exhibition society.<ref>"PASTELLISTS," American Art Annual (1911) p.210</ref>  He was an initial exhibitor at the [[MacDowell Club (New York)|MacDowell Club]] in their non-juried exhibitions, the brainchild of the Ashcan School's [[Robert Henri]].<ref>"A NEW TYPE OF EXHIBITION," The New York Times (October 29, 1911) 5:15</ref>  A charter member of the [[Association of American Painters and Sculptors]],<ref>{{cite news | title=ARTISTS IN REVOLT, FORM NEW SOCIETY | publisher=The New York Times | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F03E5D9163CE633A25750C0A9679C946396D6CF | date=January 3, 1912 | accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> Dabo was a principal organizer of the [[International Exhibition of Modern Art]].

== World War I ==

During [[World War I]], the [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] Dabo went to France and offered his services to Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]]. He ended up serving as an officer in the French and British Armies successively and exposed a number of German spies, using his ear for dialect and accent. He even played the role of spy once, going behind German lines to gain information.<ref name="time"/> For the U.S., he was part of a commission that investigated alleged atrocities that happened in France during the course of the war, and reported that they were indeed true.<ref>{{cite book | title=Current History | publisher=The New York Times Co. | year=1918 | page=515 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=U18MAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA515&dq=leon+dabo}}</ref> He was commissioned as a captain in the [[United States Army]] and served as an interpreter for the [[American Expeditionary Force]]<ref name="cooley"/> as well as an [[aide-de-camp]] to Major General [[Mark L. Hersey]] of the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Fourth Division | first=Christian Albert | last=Bach | coauthors=Hall, Henry Noble | publisher=United States Army | year=1920 | page=xv | url=http://books.google.com/?id=pssMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR15&dq=leon+dabo}}</ref>

== Later life ==
After the war, his artistic output decreased. He began to feel that American men had become too [[materialism|materialistic]], but women, he felt, were of a more spiritual nature, and could "save" art from indifference. As a result, he became a popular lecturer, often speaking to as many as fifteen women's clubs a month on art all around the country.<ref name="time"/>

In the 1920s, he taught and painted in various artists' colonies in the [[Litchfield Hills]] of [[Connecticut]]. Starting in 1933, he began to exhibit flower paintings and pastels, a departure from the landscapes with which he had become associated. They were well received, with ''The New York Times'' saying the works were "a distinct contribution to be associated with the flower harmonies of [[Odilon Redon]] and of [[Henri Fantin-Latour|Fantin-Latour]]."<ref name="cooley">{{cite web | url=http://www.cooleygallery.com/d_inv/dabo.htm | title=Leon Dabo | publisher=The Cooley Gallery | accessdate=2008-12-11}}</ref>

In 1937, he returned to France and established a studio there, where he painted French landscapes. With war approaching, Dabo helped artists such as [[Walter Sickert]] and [[Fernand L<U+00E9>ger]] transport their works out of the country to avoid their being [[Nazi plunder|confiscated]]. He escaped the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of France]] in late 1940, through Portugal. After the war, he returned to France in 1948 and painted more landscapes, most notably of [[Montagne Sainte-Victoire]]. These paintings were highly received and he was invited to exhibit them at the "Painters of Mont Ste. Victoire: Tribute to [[Paul C<U+00E9>zanne|C<U+00E9>zanne]]" show in 1951. That year, he returned the United States for the last time.<ref name="swh"/>

Dabo died in Manhattan in 1960 at the age of 95. He is buried in [[Long Island National Cemetery]].
