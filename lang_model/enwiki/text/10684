'''[[Ratu]] George Cakobau, Jr.''', also known as '''Ratu Jioji Cakobau''', is a [[Fiji]]an [[Ratu|chief]] and political leader.  The son of the late [[List of Governors-General of Fiji|Governor-General]], [[George Cakobau|Ratu Sir George Cakobau]], who was also the ''[[Vunivalu of Bau]]'' (widely considered to be Fiji's most senior chiefly position).  A meeting of elders from the [[Tui Kaba]] clan, to which he belongs, tentatively proposed him as the next ''Vunivalu'' in June [[2005]].  The position has been vacant since the death of his father in [[1989]], owing to disagreements over the succession.

In [[2001]], Cakobau was appointed to the [[Senate (Fiji)|Senate]] by the [[Great Council of Chiefs (Fiji)|Great Council of Chiefs]], having been nominated by the [[Tailevu Province, Fiji|Tailevu]] [[Local government of Fiji|Provincial Council]].  During his term, which ended in [[2006]], he took a strongly nationalistic position, opposing the [[Constitution of Fiji|constitution]] adopted in [[1997]] and calling for political control to be restored to Fiji's chiefs.  In October [[2004]], he said that people unhappy with the [[Fiji Week (Fiji)|Fiji Week]] reconciliation ceremonies, which ran from [[4 October|4]] to [[11 October]], should get out of Fiji.  He said that it was not usual for chiefs to apologise to their people, and that if chiefs did go down on their hands and knees, they should be respected for doing so.  Those unwilling to accept their apology "wholeheartedly" should ''"find another country."'' The Fijian people had had enough, he said.  These comments drew a storm of protest from some fellow-Senators, politicians, and the Military. 

Later that month, he said that fellow-Senator [[Atu Emberson-Bain]] was not [[Fijian people|indigenous]] and therefore had no right to presume to speak for the Fijian people.  Cakobau's clashes with Bain continued, and in May [[2005]], he repeatedly interrupted her during a Senate debate.  The Senate Privileges Committee is [[December 2005|currently]] investigating a complaint subsequently laid against him by Bain and by fellow-Senator [[Ponipate Lesavua]].

Cakobau's sister, [[Litia Cakobau|Adi Litia Cakobau]], was also a Senator (one of 9 appointed by the [[List of Prime Ministers of Fiji|Prime Minister]]), and whose nationalist views were regarded as even more strident than his own.  On [[6 December]] [[2005]], she publicly called for the complaints against her brother to be withdrawn, saying that his own outbursts had been provoked by the complainants. She would not be pressured into vacating her Privileges Committee while her brother's case was being heard, she declared, despite calls from opponents to do so.

In another controversy, Cakobau accused the [[Native Land Trust Board (Fiji)|Native Land Trust Board]] on [[6 December]] [[2005]] of neglecting indigenous landowners who were living in poverty.  ''"Poverty in Fiji is caused by lack of vision and poor management by those entrusted with the land, marine and forest resources of the people,"'' he said.  He called for landowners to be given easier access to the [[Fiji Development Bank]].

Cakobau made headlines at a [[United Fiji Party]] (SDL) campaign meeting on [[18 March]] [[2006]].  According to the [[Fiji Village]] news service, he strongly opposed the renomination on [[Adi (title)|Adi]] [[Asenaca Caucau]] and [[Irami Matairavula]], neither of whom had done anything for Tailevu constituents over the past five years, he claimed.  Confronting campaign director [[Jale Baba]] and [[Cabinet (Fiji)|Cabinet Minister]] [[Ratu]] [[Naiqama Lalabalavu]], he angrily demanded that the two names be withdrawn.

[[Fiji Village]] reported on [[6 June|6]]-[[7 June]] [[2006]] that Cakobau was angry at the decision of the Tailevu Provincial Council not to renew his membership of the Senate, having chosen [[Eminoni Ranacou]] in his place.  Confronting the council, he said they were acting disrespectfully towards his chiefly household, which prompted one councillor to retaliate that he himself was acting disrespectfully towards the council.
