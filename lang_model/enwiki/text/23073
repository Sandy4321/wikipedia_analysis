'''Nelson Hale Cruikshank''' ([[June 21]] [[1902]] - [[June 19]] [[1986]]) was known nationally in the [[United States]] as an expert on [[Social Security (United States|Social Security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and policy on aging. He was a [[Labor unions in the United States|labor union]] activist and staff member with the [[AFL-CIO]] before entering government service in his mid-60s.

Cruikshank is considered the most important non-[[legislator]] responsible for the enactment of [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] in [[1956]] and Medicare in [[1965]].<ref>[[Wilbur Cohen]] is another non-legislator widely acknowledged as equally important in the passage of Medicare. See Koff, and Park, ''Aging Public Policy: Bonding the Generations,'' 2nd ed., 1999.</ref>

==Early life and career==
Cruikshank was born in [[Bradner, Ohio]] in 1902 to Jesse and Jessie (Wright) Cruikshank. His father, a grain dealer, eventually moved the family to [[Texas]]. Cruikshank worked as a deck hand on freighters on the [[Great Lakes]] before attending [[Oberlin College]]. He transferred to [[Ohio Wesleyan University]], where he graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[economics]] and [[theology]].

He married Florence Crane on [[August 30]] [[1928]]. They had one child, Alice.

A devout [[Methodism|Methodist]], Cruikshank entered [[Union Theological Seminary]] in [[1926]] and obtained a [[master of divinity]] degree in [[1929]]. During his time at Union Theological Seminary, Cruikshank became acquainted with the [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] theologian [[Reinhold Neibuhr]]. Neibuhr's teachings about the [[social gospel]] as well as his deep involvement in the labor union (he was an outspoken critic of [[Henry Ford]] and allowed union organizers to speak from his pulpit on union issues) were highly influential in forming Cruikshank's personal beliefs and life.

After graduation, Cruikshank was [[ordination|ordained]]. He became an assistant pastor at a Methodist church in [[Brooklyn]]. He rose to become director of social services for the Brooklyn Federation of Churches. His experiences working with the poor and elderly convinced him of the need for legislation to address the problems of these groups.

Cruikshank was later transferred to a Methodist church in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], where he continued his social work. Cruikshank worked closely with local labor unions, eventually splitting his time between pastoral work and union organizing. He became close friends with Frank Fenton, who later became the director of organizing for the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL). Working with the Connecticut [[AFL-CIO]], he organized unions at a number of local businesses<U+2014>even serving briefly as the business agent for a local of the [[United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America|UE]] at the [[Eli Whitney Blake, Jr.|Whitney Blake Company]]. He also became tangentially involved in the [[Workers' Education Bureau of America]]. But Cruikshank was dissatisfied with pastoral work. He saw his career as a pastor taking him away from felt that people's needs were so great that in [[1936]], Cruikshank moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] and took a series of government jobs. He first worked for the [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA) as a labor relations officer. He later transferred to the FSA's Migratory Farm Labor Program, where he worked to establish several hundred camps for farm workers migrating out of the [[Dust Bowl]]<U+2014>a program later made famous in [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''.

When [[World War II]] began, Cruikshank took a position in [[1942]] with the [[War Manpower Commission]].

==AFL-CIO career==
Cruikshank began working for the AFL-CIO in [[1944]]. He initially worked as a [[lobbying|lobbyist]] before joining the American Federation of Labor in 1944 as the director of social insurance. He worked closely with AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer [[George Meany]], and became influenced by Meany's internationalist outlook.

Cruikshank was appointed to the National Advisory Council on Social Security Financing in [[1947]], where he became the AFL's point-man on old age and health issues.

Cruikshank left the AFL in [[1951]] and returned to government service. He became director of the European Labor Division of the Office of the Special Representative of the President for Europe, which was part of the [[Marshall Plan]], but returned to the U.S. after just a year.

===Role in enactment of Social Security Disability Insurance===
Cruikshank returned to the AFL in [[1953]]. He performed various duties for Meany, who now was running the AFL-CIO behind the scenes as president [[William Green (labor leader)|William Green]]'s health declined. In [[1955]] Cruikshank was named the director of the AFL's newly-formed Department of Social Security. He continued in that role after the AFL and [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) merged in 1955. Cruikshank used his position to protect and enhance Social Security. He created the AFL-CIO's Social Security Advisory Committee as a political group to press for higher and expanded benefits. In [[1956]], Cruikshank's efforts were instrumental in winning passage of the [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] amendments, which provided income assistance to permanently disabled workers.

===Role in enactment of Medicare===
Cruikshank immediately turned his attention to health care for the elderly. In [[1960]], as planning for the first [[White House Conference on Aging]] got underway, Cruikshank worked with Meany friend [[Nelson Rockefeller]] to secure the appointment of a liberal [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] as chair of the conference. He also won placement for senior citizens' health care issues in a favorable committee, to protect it from the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) (which was vehemently opposed to national health insurance). The 1960 presidential election occurred concurrent with planning for the conference, and Cruikshank used the AFL-CIO's involvement in the election to build an organization of more than 500 health care and seniors' groups. When the White House Conference on Aging convened in [[1961]], Cruikshank mobilized his campaign group to defend and advance the national health insurance scheme and win the Conference's approval.

In July 1961, at the urging of Rep. [[Aime J. Forand]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Rhode Island]]), Cruikshank transformed the coalition he had created into the [[Alliance for Retired Americans|National Council of Senior Citizens]] (NCSC). Forand, now retired from Congressional service, became its first president.

From 1961 to [[1965]], Cruikshank worked closely with NCSC. In April [[1963]], the group won a presidential proclamation establishing "Senior Citizen's Month" (now Older Americans Month). But his most important accomplishment was working behind the scenes to win passage of Medicare<U+2014>national health insurance for the elderly. Cruikshank played a critical role in coordinating the efforts of NCSC, the AFL-CIO and other groups in a massive lobbying effort, and helped engineer a nationally-televised speech by President [[John F. Kennedy]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] on [[May 20]] [[1962]].<ref>Kennedy's speech was one of the worst of his career. He discarded his prepared speech while in his limousine on his way to the Garden, and attempted to write a new one. Kennedy spoke extemporaneously and badly, making numerous misstatements of fact. The tone of his remarks addressed the senior citizens in the Garden, who already knew the importance of national health insurance. But on television, where most viewers were not familiar with the issue, the president's performance fell flat. See Weeks and Berman, ''Shapers of American Health Care Policy: An Oral History,'' 1985.</ref>

Cruikshank was a critical lobbyist for passage of Medicare. He helped eliminate any role for insurance companies as underwriters of national insurance. Medicare had been bottled up in committee for years, never having enough votes to be reported out onto either chamber's floor. After the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]], President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] demanded that Rep. [[Wilbur Mills]] (D-[[Arkansas]]), chair of the powerful [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]], to enlarge his committee and stack it with members who would approve Medicare. Mills co-opted the AMA and grafted [[Medicaid]] onto the bill, which then easily passed the House.

But in the Senate, Cruikshank had to work quickly to avoid disaster. Sen. [[Russell B. Long]] (D-[[Louisiana]]) offered an amendment in the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]] which would have turned Medicare into a catastrophic health insurance plan, rather than a general insurance program. He misused a proxy vote<ref>A proxy vote allows a senator to cast a vote in committee for an absent senator. Senate Rule XXVI provides that proxies may not be voted when the absent senator has not been informed of the matter on which his proxy may be cast, and has not requested that his proxy be cast for that matter.[http://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/proxy_voting.htm]</ref> from Sen. [[J. William Fulbright]] (D-Arkansas) to help win passage of the amendment, and misled Sen. [[Paul Douglas]] (D-[[Illinois]]) that he could vote to approve the amendment because another vote would be held later after costs had been calculated (a vote Long had no intention of seeking). Knowing that the Long amendment would not pass the House nor be backed by the AFL-CIO, Cruikshank convinced Douglas to exercise his parliamentary rights and ask for reconsideration of the Long amendment.<ref>Senate Rule XIII provides that any senator voting with the prevailing side or who has not voted may move to reconsider the bill, resolution, report, amendment, order, or message upon which a vote has been taken. Every motion to reconsider is decided by a majority vote.[http://rules.senate.gov/senaterules/rule13.php]</ref> Efforts were made to find a compromise between the Long amendment and the original bill, but backers of the original bill felt they had already compromised too much. Working with Sen. [[Clinton Presba Anderson|Clinton P. Anderson]] (D-[[New Mexico]]), Cruikshank mustered a majority in the Finance Committee in favor of the original bill. The deciding vote came from Sen. [[Harry F. Byrd]] (D-[[Virginia]], who had openly voted against Medicare in the past. Cruikshank made the critical decision to ask Anderson to go ahead with the vote after receiving assurances that Byrd would vote for the bill in committee but would, on principle, vote against the bill on the Senate floor.

The Medicare legislation passed the Senate, was approved by a [[United States Congress Conference committee|conference committee]], and was signed by President Johnson on [[July 28]] [[1965]].

Cruikshank retired from the AFL-CIO in 1965.

==Later career==
Cruikshank did not leave the labor movement entirely, however. The year that he retired from the AFL-CIO, he became executive director of the NCSC, the AFL-CIO's retiree organization affiliate. In 1969, he was elected president of NCSC following Aime Forand's retirement.

Cruikshank's wife died in [[1967]]. 

In [[1969]], Cruikshank obtained a position as a visiting professor at the Labor Studies Center at [[Pennsylvania State University]].

From [[1971]] to [[1974]], he served as chair of the [[American Hospital Association]]'s Citizens Advisory Committee on Health.

Cruikshank retired as NCSC president in [[1977]] to become President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s advisor on aging. He was appointed chair of the [[Federal Council on Aging]]. Cruikshank had a rocky tenure as a Carter administration official, often speaking publicly against various administration legislative efforts.

In [[1980]], Cruikshank left the Carter administration to head up an education and research effort with the organization [[Save Our Security]] (SOS). SOS was established in [[1979]] by [[Wilbur Cohen]], one of the original drafters of the Social Security Act. SOS was a coalition of over 200 organizations<U+2014>primarily labor unions and advocacy groups for the disabled and the aged<U+2014>formed in response to [[Social Security (United States)#The 1970s and the New Negative Financial Outlook of Social Security|efforts to weaken Social Security]]. Later, SOS proposed expanding Social Security disability payments and Medicare benefits, and fought to secure benefits for so-called "notch" beneficiaries.<ref>For a description of Social Security "notch" problem, see [http://www.aarp.org/money/social_security/a2003-03-26-ssnotch.html "Understanding the Social Security Notch," AARP, no date.] accessed Jan. 7, 2007.</ref> Cruikshank directed the Nelson Cruikshank Social Insurance Study Project for SOS. The project developed curricula and educational materials for elementary, secondary and post-secondary students to increase awareness of social insurance.

Concurrently with his role in SOS, Cruikshank served as NCSC's president emeritus.

Cruikshank moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] in [[1984]]. His health began to fail, and he died in a nursing home in 1986.
