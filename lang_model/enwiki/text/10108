In the episode, the Simpson children are put in the custody of [[Ned Flanders|Ned]] and [[Maude Flanders]] after a series of misadventures. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] have to attend a class for bad parents so that they can get their children back. Learning that none of the children have been [[baptized]], Flanders sets up a baptism, but Homer and Marge are able to stop him just in time.

The episode was written by [[Jon Vitti]] and directed by [[Susie Dietter]]. The story was pitched by another writer on the show, [[George Meyer]]. It was the first episode on which writers [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] served as [[show runner]]s. The episode features cultural references to the 1965 film ''[[Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!]]'' and [[Sonny & Cher]]'s song "[[I Got You Babe]]". Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a [[Nielsen rating]] of 9.0, and was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.

==Plot==
When [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] is sent home from school with [[Head-louse infestation|head lice]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] without shoes, Marge and Homer are accused of being negligent parents. Two [[Child Protective Services]] agents arrive at their house and take Bart, Lisa, and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] to a [[foster home]]<U+2014>right next door, at [[Ned Flanders]]'s house.

The kids have to get used to bedtime at seven o'clock with the sunlight still out, and hours of [[Bible]] board games. Bart and Lisa hate the Flanders house, but Maggie enjoys being there as she gets more attention from Flanders than she did with Homer. Meanwhile, Homer and Marge have to attend a special class for bad parents so that they can get their children back.

When Flanders finds out that Bart and Lisa were not [[baptism|baptized]], he takes it upon himself to give the kids an emergency baptism. When Homer and Marge are declared decent parents, they quickly head for the Springfield River to stop Flanders. Just as Flanders is about to pour [[holy water]] on Bart, Homer shoves Bart over to prevent the water from hitting him. The Simpson family is reunited, and they head home together.

==Production==

"Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" was the first episode to be made after [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] became [[show runner]]s of ''The Simpsons''. They wanted to start the season with an episode centering on the Simpson family.<ref name="Weinstein">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The story was [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] by writer [[George Meyer]] at a story retreat.  Story retreats were held twice a year at a hotel room close to the studio lot, where all the writers gathered to pitch their ideas.<ref name="Vitti">{{cite video | people=Vitti, Jon|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Seventeen episodes were pitched at this particular story retreat. Out of them all, Weinstein considered this episode to be the best, and he thought the pitch by Meyer was the "best" he had ever heard.<ref name="Weinstein"/> Oakley and Weinstein selected former full-time staff writer [[Jon Vitti]] to write the episode, wanting a "heavy hitter", since it was going to start the seventh production season. Vitti retained in his script most of what Meyer pitched at the retreat.<ref name="Oakley">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The episode was directed by [[Susie Dietter]]. There is a statue portraying ''The Simpsons'' writer [[John Swartzwelder]] outside the courthouse in the episode. Oakley said that this was a mistake because he and Weinstein thought that [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] was located in [[Swartzwelder County]], incorrectly going off a montage in the season three episode "[[Dog of Death]]". That montage depicts Springfield as being located in [[Springfield County]]; while Swartzwelder is the adjoining county.<ref name="Oakley"/> The female Child Protective Services agent, in appearance, is based on a teacher both Oakley and Weinstein had in high school that they "hated".<ref name="Weinstein"/> [[List of cast members of The Simpsons|Cast]] member [[Hank Azaria]]'s [[voice acting|voice]] for the character [[Cletus Spuckler|Cletus]] was off in this episode because, over the summer between seasons, Azaria and the producers had forgotten what Cletus sounds like.<ref name="Weinstein"/>

==Cultural references==
Ned and Maude Flanders sing Maggie to bed with their own version of [[Sonny & Cher]]'s song "[[I Got You Babe]]". The ''[[Itchy & Scratchy]]'' cartoon that Lisa and Bart watch is called "Foster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!", a reference to the 1965 film ''[[Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!]]''. Flanders says that he used to let his sons watch ''[[My Three Sons]]'', but it got them "all worked up" before bedtime.<ref name="BBC"/> The headline of a newspaper that Marge gives to Lisa for her history project is "40 Trampled at Poco Concert", a reference to American rock band [[Poco]].<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|isbn=0-00063-8898-1|page=183}}</ref> While riding in Flanders's car, Maggie spins her head around with a scary smile on her face to look at Bart and Lisa, as in the 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.<ref name="Dietter">{{cite video | people=Dietter, Susie|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that "its best elements come from the amusing bizarreness of the Flanders home, but Homer and Marge<U+2019>s classes are also fun. Chalk this one up as season seven's first great episode."<ref name=dvdmovieguide>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-12-01|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonseven.shtml|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season (1995)  |publisher=DVD Movie Guide|date=2006-01-05|author=Jacobson, Colin }}</ref> Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Marge tells Bart and Lisa that someday they will have to be adults and take care of themselves, just before Homer comes to Marge about a spider near his car keys. She concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-12-01|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason7.php|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season |publisher=DVD Verdict|date=2006-01-16|author=Malkowski, Judge }}</ref> The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it "one of the most disturbing episodes, as Bart and Lisa are dragged into the Flanders' sinister lifestyle." They thought the ending, when Ned tries to baptize the children, was "nail-biting stuff", and Maggie's second first-word was "a truly shocking moment". The authors added: "It's astonishing that anything this radical made it on to prime time television. The final moments are perhaps the most moving in the entire series, a wonderful affirmation of everything the series, and the Simpson family, are about."<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season7/page3.shtml|title=Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily|accessdate=2009-01-04|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |year=2000|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>

''The Register-Mail'''s Bill Gaither named it the best episode of the show, and added: "I particularly enjoyed this episode because I dated a girl in high school that was a live version female Ned Flanders, just with better looks."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.register-mail.com/stories/080207/FEA_BDUAK0RF.GID.shtml|title=Best Episodes of 'The Simpsons'|last=Gaither|first=Bill|date=August 2, 2007|work=The Register-Mail|accessdate=2009-01-06}}</ref> [[Matt Groening]], the creator of ''The Simpsons'', thought the episode was "fantastic" and he called it one of his favorites.
