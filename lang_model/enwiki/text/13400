{{IPA notice}}
'''Ottawa''' (or '''Odawa''') is a [[dialect]] of the [[Ojibwe language]], spoken by the [[Odawa people|Ottawa people]] in southern [[Ontario]] in Canada, and northern [[Michigan]] in the United States. Descendants of migrant Ottawa speakers live in [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. The first recorded meeting of Ottawa speakers and Europeans occurred in 1615 when a party of Ottawas encountered explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] on the north shore of [[Georgian Bay]]. Ottawa is written in an alphabetic system using [[Latin script|Latin letters]], and is known to its speakers as ''Nishnaabemwin'' "speaking the native language" or ''Daawaamwin'' "speaking Ottawa".

Ottawa is one of the Ojibwe dialects that has undergone the most [[language change]], although it shares many features with other dialects. The most distinctive change is a pervasive pattern of vowel [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] that deletes short vowels in many words, resulting in significant changes in their [[Phonology|pronunciation]]. This and other innovations in pronunciation, in addition to changes in [[morphology (linguistics)|word structure]] and [[Lexicon|vocabulary]], differentiate Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe.

Like other Ojibwe dialects, Ottawa grammar includes [[Grammatical gender#Animate and inanimate|animate and inanimate]] noun [[Grammatical gender|gender]], subclasses of [[verb]]s that are dependent upon gender, combinations of [[prefix]]es and [[suffixes]] that are connected with particular verb subclasses, and complex patterns of [[word formation]]. Ottawa distinguishes two types of [[Grammatical person|third person]] in sentences: [[Grammatical person#Additional persons|proximate]], indicating a [[noun phrase]] that is emphasized in the discourse, and [[Grammatical person#Additional persons|obviative]], indicating a noun phrase that is less prominent. Ottawa has relatively flexible word order compared with languages such as English.

Ottawa speakers are concerned that their language is [[Language death|endangered]] as the use of English increases and the number of fluent speakers declines. [[Language revitalization]] efforts include [[second language learning]] in primary and secondary schools.

==History of scholarship==

==Classification==
{{see also|Ojibwe dialects}}
Ottawa is known to its speakers as ''Nishnaabemwin'' "speaking the native language" (from ''Anishinaabe'' "native person" + verb suffix ''-mo'' "speak a language" + suffix ''-win'' "[[Nominalization|nominalizer]]", with regular deletion of short vowels); the same term is applied to the [[Eastern Ojibwa language|Eastern Ojibwe]] dialect.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, p. 17</ref> The corresponding term in other dialects is ''Anishinaabemowin''.<ref>Nichols, John and Earl Nyholm, 1995, p. 10</ref> ''Daawaamwin'' (from ''Odaawaa'' "Ottawa" + verb suffix ''-mo'' "speak a language" + suffix ''-win'' "nominalizer", with regular deletion of short vowels) "speaking Ottawa" is also reported in some sources.<ref>Baraga, Frederic, 1878, p. 336 gives <Otawamowin>.</ref> The name of the Canadian capital [[Ottawa]] is a [[loanword]] that comes through [[French language|French]] from ''odaawaa'', the self-designation of the Ottawa people.<ref>Rayburn, Alan, 1997, p. 259</ref><ref>See Bright, William, 2004, p. 360 for other uses of "Ottawa" as a place name.</ref> The earliest recorded form is "Outaouan", in a French source from 1641.<ref>Feest, Johanna and Christian Feest, 1978, p. 785</ref>

Ottawa is a dialect of the Ojibwe language, which is a member of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language family.<ref name="Goddard DVM">Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. 95</ref> The varieties of Ojibwe form a [[dialect continuum]], a series of adjacent dialects spoken primarily in the area surrounding the [[Great Lakes]] as well as in the Canadian provinces of [[Quebec]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Saskatchewan]], with smaller outlying groups in [[North Dakota]], [[Montana]],  [[Alberta]], and [[British Columbia]]. [[Mutual intelligibility]] is the linguistic criterion used to distinguish languages from dialects.<ref>Hock, Hans, 1991, p. 381</ref><ref name="Mithun, Marian, 1999, p.298">Mithun, Marian, 1999, p. 298</ref> In straightforward cases, varieties of language that are mutually intelligible are classified as dialects, while varieties of speech that are not mutually intelligible are classified as separate languages.<ref>Campbell, Lyle, 2004, p. 217</ref> Linguistic and social factors may result in inconsistencies in how the terms "language" and "dialect" are used.<ref name="Mithun, Marian, 1999, p.298-299">Mithun, Marian, 1999, pp. 298<U+2013>299</ref>

Languages spoken in a series of dialects occupying adjacent territory form a dialect continuum or language complex, with some of the dialects being mutually intelligible while others are not. Adjacent dialects typically have relatively high degrees of mutual intelligibility, but the degree of mutual intelligibility between nonadjacent dialects varies considerably. In some cases speakers of nonadjacent dialects may not understand each other's speech.<ref name="Mithun, Marian, 1999, p.298-299"/><ref>Hockett, Charles F., 1958, pp. 323<U+2013>326 develops a model of language complexes; he uses the term "L-complex"</ref>

A survey conducted during the 1980s and 1990s found that the differences between Ottawa, the [[Anishinini language|Severn Ojibwe]] dialect spoken in northwestern Ontario and northern Manitoba, and the [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]] dialect spoken in western [[Quebec]] result in low levels of mutual intelligibility.<ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994"/> These three dialects "show many distinct features, which suggest periods of relative isolation from other varieties of Ojibwe."<ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, pp. 43<U+2013>44">Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, pp. 43<U+2013>44</ref> Because the dialects of Ojibwe are at least partly mutually intelligible, Ojibwe is conventionally considered to be a single language with a series of adjacent dialects.<ref name="RhodesTodd52">Rhodes, Richard and Evelyn Todd, 1981, p. 52</ref> Taking account of the low mutual intelligibility of the most strongly differentiated dialects, an alternative view is that Ojibwe "could be said to consist of several languages",<ref name="RhodesTodd52"/> forming a language complex.<ref>As in e.g. [[H.C. Wolfart|Wolfart]], H. Christoph, 1989, p. 1</ref>

==Geographic distribution==
The Ottawa communities for which the most detailed linguistic information has been collected are in Ontario. Extensive research has been conducted with speakers from Walpole Island in southwestern Ontario near [[Detroit]], and [[Wikwemikong]] on [[Manitoulin Island]] in [[Lake Huron]]. South of Manitoulin Island on the [[Bruce Peninsula]] are [[Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation|Cape Croker]] and [[Saugeen First Nation|Saugeen]], for which less information is available.<ref>Significant publications include Bloomfield, Leonard, 1958; Piggott, Glyne, 1980; Rhodes, Richard, 1985; Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994; Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001</ref> The dialect affiliation of several communities east of Lake Huron remains uncertain. Although "the dialect spoken along the eastern shore of Georgian Bay" has been described as [[Eastern Ojibwa language|Eastern Ojibwe]], studies do not clearly delimit the boundary between Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe.<ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001"/><ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994"/><ref>Rhodes, Richard, 1985, p. x</ref>

===Population movements===
At the time of first contact with Europeans in the early 17th century, Ottawa speakers resided on Manitoulin Island, the Bruce Peninsula, and probably the north and east shores of Georgian Bay. The northern area of the [[Lower Peninsula]] of Michigan has also been a central area for Ottawa speakers since the arrival of Europeans.<ref name="Feest, J. 1978, p. 772">Feest, Johanna and Christian Feest, 1978, p. 772</ref>

Population movements of Ottawa speakers since the arrival of Europeans have been complex,<ref name="Feest, J. 1978, p. 772"/> with extensive migrations and contact with other Ojibwe groups.<ref>Rogers, Edward, 1978, pp. 760, 764, 764, Fig. 3</ref> Many Ottawa speakers in southern Ontario are descended from speakers of the [[Southwestern Ojibwe language|Southwestern Ojibwe]] dialect (also known as "Chippewa") who moved into Ottawa-speaking areas during the mid-19th century. Ottawa today is sometimes referred to as "Chippewa" or "Ojibwe" by speakers in these areas.<ref name="Rhodes, Richard, 1985, pp. x<U+2013>xi"/> As part of a series of population displacements during the same period, an estimated two thousand American [[Potawatomi (language)|Potawatomi]] speakers from Wisconsin, Michigan and [[Indiana]] moved into Ottawa communities in southwestern Ontario.<ref>Clifton, James, 1978, p. 739</ref> The non-Ottawa-speaking Ojibwes who moved to these areas [[Language shift|shifted]] to speaking Ottawa, as did the Potawatomi migrants. As a result of the migrations, Ottawa came to include Potawatomi and Ojibwe loanwords.<ref>Rhodes, Richard, 1985 p. xi</ref>

Two subdialects of Ottawa arise from these population movements and the subsequent language shift. The subdialects are associated with the ancestry of significant increments of the populations in particular communities, as well as with differences in the way the language is named in those locations.<ref name="Rhodes1985,4">Rhodes, Richard, 1982, p. 4</ref> On Manitoulin Island, where the population is predominantly of Ottawa origin, the language is called "Ottawa", and has features that set it off from other communities that have significant populations of Southwestern Ojibwe (Chippewa) and Potawatomi descent. In the latter communities the language is called "Chippewa", but is still clearly Ottawa. Dialect features found in "Ottawa Ottawa" that distinguish it from "Chippewa Ottawa" include deletion of the sounds ''w'' and ''y'' between vowels, [[glottalization]] of ''w'' before consonants,<ref>Rhodes, Richard, 1985, p. li</ref> changes in vowel quality adjacent to ''w'',<ref name="Rhodes, Richard, 1985, pp. xxxix<U+2013>xliii">Rhodes, Richard, 1985, pp. xxxix<U+2013>xliii</ref> and distinctive intonation.<ref name="Rhodes1985,4"/><ref>Rhodes, Richard, 1976a, p. 135</ref>

==Phonology==
{{Main|Ottawa phonology}}
Ottawa has seventeen [[consonant]]s and seven [[Vowel|oral]] [[vowel]]s; there are also long [[Nasal vowel|nasal]] vowels whose [[Phonology|phonological]] status is unclear.<ref>See e.g. Nichols, John and Earl Nyholm, 1995, for the segmental inventories of Southwestern Ojibwe, and Todd, Evelyn, 1970 for Severn Ojibwe</ref> In this article, Ottawa words are written in the [[Ottawa language#Modern orthography|modern orthography]] described below, with phonetic transcriptions in brackets using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]] as needed.<ref>See Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 29<U+2013>32 for a discussion of the relationship between sounds and orthography</ref>

The most prominent feature of Ottawa phonology is [[Ottawa phonology#Vowel syncope|vowel syncope]], in which short vowels are deleted, or in certain circumstances reduced to schwa {{IPAblink|<U+0259>}}, when they appear in [[Metrical phonology|metrically defined]] weak syllables. Notable effects of syncope are:<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 51<U+2013>67</ref>
#Differences in pronunciation between Ottawa and other dialects of Ojibwe, resulting in a lower degree of mutual intelligibility.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 52<U+2013>54, 57<U+2013>59</ref>
#Creation of new consonant clusters that do not occur in other dialects, through deletion of short vowels between two consonants.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 76<U+2013>83</ref>
#Adjustments in the pronunciation of consonant sequences.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 73<U+2013>74</ref>
#New forms of the person prefixes that occur on nouns and verbs.<ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph 2001, pp. 59">Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 59<U+2013>67</ref>
#Variability in the pronunciation of words that contain vowels subject to syncope, as speakers frequently have more than one way of pronouncing them.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 66<U+2013>67, 71</ref>

===Consonants===
The table of consonants uses symbols from the modern orthography with the corresponding symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) following where the two vary, or to draw attention to a particular property of the sound in question.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 50</ref>

The [[plosive]], [[Fricative consonant|fricative]], and [[Affricate consonant|affricate]] consonants are divided into two sets, referred to as [[fortis and lenis]]. Fortis (or "strong") consonants are typically distinguished from lenis (or "weak") consonants by features such as greater duration or [[Gemination|length]], are [[Voice (phonetics)|voiceless]] where lenis consonants are typically [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]], and may be [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]].<ref>Nichols, John and Earl Nyholm, 1995, p. xxxvi</ref><ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 48<U+2013>49</ref> In Ottawa, each fortis consonant is matched to a corresponding lenis consonant with the same [[place of articulation]] and [[manner of articulation]]. Ottawa fortis consonants are voiceless and phonetically long,<ref name="Rhodes, Richard, 1985">Rhodes, Richard, 1985, pp. xlix<U+2013>l, l<U+2013>li, xlvii,</ref> and  are aspirated in most positions: {{IPA|[p<U+02D0><U+02B0>]}}, {{IPA|[t<U+02D0><U+02B0>]}}, {{IPA|[k<U+02D0><U+02B0>]}}, {{IPA|[t<U+0283><U+02D0><U+02B0>]}}. When following another consonant they are unaspirated or weakly articulated.<ref>Rhodes, Richard, 1985, p. xlvii</ref> The lenis consonants are typically voiced between vowels and word-initially before a vowel, but are [[Voice (phonetics)|devoiced]] in word-final position. The lenis consonants are subject to other [[Ottawa phonology#Secondary consonant clusters|phonological processes]] when adjacent to fortis consonants.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 74<U+2013>81</ref>

[[Labialisation|Labialized]] stop consonants {{IPA|[<U+0261><U+02B7>]}} and {{IPA|[k<U+02B7>]}}, consisting of a consonant with noticeable lip [[Roundedness|rounding]], occur in the speech of some speakers. Labialization is not normally indicated in writing, but a subscript dot is utilized in a widely used dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe to mark labialization: ''{{unicode|<U+0261><U+0323>taaji}}'' "he is afraid" and ''{{unicode|aa<U+1E33>zi}}'' "he is sick".<ref>Rhodes, Richard, 1985, pp. xvlvi, xlvii</ref>

===Vowels===
Ottawa has seven oral [[vowel]]s, four [[Vowel length|long]] and three [[Vowel length|short]]. There are four long nasal vowels whose status as either phonemes or [[allophone]]s (predictable variants) is unclear.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 34<U+2013>41</ref> The long vowels {{IPA|/i<U+02D0>, o<U+02D0>, a<U+02D0>/}} are paired with the short vowels {{IPA|/i, o, a/}},<ref name="Rhodes, Richard, 1985, pp. xxxix<U+2013>xliii"/> and are written with double symbols ''ii, oo, aa'' that correspond to the single symbols used for the short vowels ''i, o, a''. The long vowel {{IPA|/e<U+02D0>/}} does not have a corresponding short vowel, and is written with a single ''e''.<ref>Rhodes, Richard, 1985, p. xlii</ref> The phonological distinction between long and short vowels plays a significant role in Ottawa phonology, as only short vowels can be [[Ottawa phonology#Metrical feet and syllable weight|metrically weak]] and undergo [[Ottawa phonology#Vowel syncope|syncope]]. Long vowels are always [[Ottawa phonology#Metrical feet and syllable weight|metrically strong]] and never undergo deletion.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 54</ref>

The long nasal vowels are ''iinh'' ({{IPA|[<U+0129><U+02D0>]}}), ''enh'' ({{IPA|[<U+1EBD><U+02D0>]}}), ''aanh'' ({{IPA|[<U+00E3><U+02D0>]}}), and ''oonh'' ({{IPA|[<U+00F5><U+02D0>]}}). They most commonly occur in the final syllable of nouns with [[diminutive]] suffixes or words with a diminutive connotation,<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 185<U+2013>188</ref> as well as in the suffix ''(y)aanh'' ([-{{IPA|(j)<U+00E3><U+02D0>]}}) 'first person (Conjunct) Animate Intransitive'.<ref name="Valentine, J.

==Grammar==
{{see also|Ojibwe grammar}}
[[File:AndrewBlackbirdHistoryGrammarP120.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Printed text with columns of English words and corresponding Ottawa terms. Page from Andrew Blackbird's 19th-century ''History of the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan'', which includes a grammatical description of the Ottawa and Southwestern Ojibwe (Chippewa) dialects of Ojibwe.<ref>Blackbird, Andrew J., 1887, p. 120</ref> Retrieved April 12, 2009 from [http://www.archive.org/details/historyofottawac00blac History of the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan: A grammar of their language, and personal and family history of the author].]] Ottawa shares the general grammatical characteristics of the other dialects of [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]. Word classes include [[noun]]s, [[verb]]s, [[grammatical particle]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[preverb]]s, and [[prenoun]]s.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, Ch. 3</ref> 

Ottawa [[Noun class#Algonquian languages|grammatical gender]] classifies nouns as either animate or inanimate.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 113</ref> Transitive verbs encode the gender of the grammatical [[Object (grammar)|object]], and [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] verbs encode the gender of the grammatical [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], creating a set of four verb subclasses.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 114<U+2013>121, 130<U+2013>135</ref> The distinction between the two genders also affects verbs through [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] patterns for number and gender.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 114<U+2013>121</ref> Similarly, [[demonstrative]] pronouns agree in gender with the noun they refer to.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 116</ref>

===Morphology===
{{main|Ottawa morphology}}

Ottawa has complex systems of both [[inflection]]al and [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] morphology. Inflectional morphology has a central role in Ottawa grammar. Noun inflection and particularly verb inflection indicate grammatical information through the use of prefixes and suffixes that are added to word stems.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 104<U+2013>105</ref>

Notable grammatical characteristics marked with inflectional prefixes and suffixes include:

#A distinction between [[Grammatical person#Additional persons|obviative]] and [[Grammatical person#Additional persons|proximate]] third person, marked on both verbs and nouns.<ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph 2001, pp. 623">Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 623<U+2013>643</ref>
#Extensive marking on verbs of inflectional information concerning [[Grammatical person|person]].<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, Chapters 5<U+2013>8; pp. 62<U+2013>72</ref>
#[[Grammatical number|Number]] (singular and plural).<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 178</ref>
#[[Grammatical tense|Tense]].<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 759<U+2013>782</ref>
#[[Linguistic modality|Modality]].<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 759</ref>
#[[Evidentiality]].<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 830<U+2013>837</ref>
#[[Negation (linguistics)|Negation]].<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 837<U+2013>856</ref>

Prefixes mark grammatical person on verbs, including first person, second person, and third person.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 62<U+2013>72</ref> Nouns use combinations of prefixes and suffixes to indicate [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]]. Suffixes on nouns mark [[Grammatical gender|gender]],<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 177<U+2013>178</ref> [[Locative case|location]],<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 743<U+2013>748</ref> [[diminutive]],<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 185<U+2013>190</ref> [[pejorative]],<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 190<U+2013>193</ref> and other categories.<ref>See Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, Ch. 5 for an extensive survey.</ref> Significant agreement patterns between nouns and verbs involve gender, [[Grammatical number#Singular versus plural|singular and plural]] number, as well as obviation.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, Chs. 4<U+2013>8</ref>

Ottawa derivational morphology forms basic [[word stem]]s with combinations of word [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] (also called ''initials''), and [[affix]]es referred to as ''medials'' and ''finals'' to create words to which inflectional prefixes and suffixes are added.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 318<U+2013>335</ref> Word stems are combined with other word stems to create [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] words.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 335, 515<U+2013>522</ref>

Innovations in Ottawa morphology contribute to differentiating Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe. These differences include: the reanalysis of person prefixes and word stems;<ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph 2001, pp. 59"/> the loss of final /-n/ in certain inflectional suffixes;<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 18<U+2013>19</ref> a distinctive form for the verbal suffix indicating doubt;<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, pp. 427<U+2013>428</ref> and a distinctive form for the verbal suffix indicating plurality on [[intransitive verb]]s with grammatically inanimate subjects.<ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, p. 430">Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, p. 430</ref>

The most significant of the morphological innovations that characterize Ottawa is the restructuring of the three person prefixes that occur on both nouns and verbs. The prefixes carry grammatical information about grammatical person (first, second, or third). Syncope modifies the pronunciation of the prefixes by deleting the short vowel in each prefix.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 63<U+2013>64</ref>

{| class="wikitable" border="2" align="center" cellpadding="3"

|-
| (b) ''second person prefix''|| gi- || g-
|-
| (c) ''third-person''|| o- || <U+2014> (no form)
|-
|}

The third-person prefix /o-/, which occurs with both nouns and verbs, is completely eliminated in Ottawa.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 64</ref> As a result there is no grammatical marker to indicate third-person on inflected forms of nouns or verbs. For example, where other dialects have ''jiimaan'' "a canoe" with no person prefix, and ''ojimaan'' "his/her canoe" with prefix ''o-'', Ottawa has ''jiimaan'' meaning either "canoe" or "his/her canoe" (with no prefix, because of syncope).<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 64<U+2013>67, 82<U+2013>83</ref> Apart from the simple deletion of vowels in the prefixes, Ottawa has created new variants for each prefix.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, pp. 143<U+2013>147</ref> Restructuring of the person prefixes is discussed in detail in [[Ottawa morphology]].

===Syntax===
[[Syntax]] refers to patterns for combining [[word]]s and [[phrase]]s to make [[clause]]s and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 916</ref> Verbal and nominal inflectional morphology are central to Ottawa syntax, as they mark grammatical information on verbs and nouns to a greater extent than in English (which has few inflections, and relies mainly on word order).<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 918</ref> Preferred [[word order]]s in a simple [[Transitivity (grammatical category)|transitive]] sentence are verb-initial, such as [[verb<U+2013>object<U+2013>subject]] (VOS) and [[verb<U+2013>subject<U+2013>object|VSO]]. While verb-final orders are avoided, all logically possible orders are attested.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 934<U+2013>935</ref> Ottawa word order displays considerably more freedom than is found in languages such as English, and word order frequently reflects [[Discourse analysis|discourse]]-based distinctions such as [[Topic (linguistics)|topic]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]].<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 951<U+2013>955</ref>

Verbs are marked for grammatical information in three distinct sets of inflectional paradigms, called [[Ojibwe grammar#Verbs|Verb orders]]. Each order corresponds generally to one of three main sentence types: the Independent order is used in [[Sentence (linguistics)|main clauses]], the Conjunct order in [[Dependent clause|subordinate clauses]], and the Imperative order in [[Imperative mood|commands]].<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 991<U+2013>996</ref>

Ottawa distinguishes [[yes-no question]]s, which use a verb form in the Independent order, from content questions formed with the Ottawa equivalents of [[Interrogative words|"what", "where", "when", "who"]] and others, which require verbs inflected in the Conjunct order.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 975<U+2013>991</ref>

Ottawa distinguishes two types of grammatical [[Grammatical person|third person]] in sentences, marked on both verbs and animate nouns. The [[Grammatical person#Additional persons|proximate]] form indicates a more salient noun phrase, and [[Grammatical person#Additional persons|obviative]] indicates a less prominent noun phrase. Selection and use of proximate or obviative forms is a distinctive aspect of Ottawa syntax that indicates the relative discourse prominence of noun phrases containing third persons; it does not have a direct analogue in English grammar.<ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph 2001, pp. 623"/>

==Vocabulary==
Few vocabulary items are considered unique to Ottawa.<ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, p. 430"/> The influx of speakers of other Ojibwe dialects into the Ottawa area has resulted in mixing of dialects that were historically distinct. Given that vocabulary spreads readily from one dialect to another the presence of a particular vocabulary item in a given dialect is not a guarantee of the original source of the item.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, pp. 430<U+2013>431</ref> Two groups of [[function word]]s are characteristically Ottawa: the sets of demonstrative pronouns and interrogative adverbs are both distinctive relative to other dialects of Ojibwe. Although some of the vocabulary items in each set are found in other dialects, taken as a group each is uniquely Ottawa.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, pp. 424, 428</ref>

===Demonstrative pronouns===
Ottawa uses a set of [[demonstrative]] pronouns that contains terms unique to Ottawa, while other words in the set are shared with other Ojibwe dialects. Taken as a group the Ottawa set is distinctive.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 18</ref> The following chart shows the demonstrative pronouns for: (a) Wikwemikong, an Ottawa community; (b) Curve Lake, an Eastern Ojibwe community; and (c) Cape Croker, an Ottawa community that uses a mixed pronoun set. The terms ''maaba'' 'this (animate)', ''gonda'' 'these (animate)', and ''nonda'' 'these (inanimate)' are unique to Ottawa.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, p. 424</ref>

===Interrogative pronouns and adverbs===

==Writing system==
{{see also|Ojibwe writing systems}}
[[File:O'MearaChippBible.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Alt=Printed page with title at top followed by body text|Page from a nineteenth-century Ottawa language publication by Frederick O'Meara, based on his work among Ottawa speakers on Manitoulin Island.<ref name="OMeara54">O<U+2019>Meara, Frederick, 1854</ref><ref>Pilling, James, 1891, p. 381</ref>  Retrieved from [http://www.archive.org/details/biblechippewa00unknuoft "Ewh oowahweendahmahgawin owh tabanemenung Jesus Christ..."] (a version of the New Testament in Ojibwe) 1854.]]

Written representation of Ojibwe dialects, including Ottawa, was introduced by European explorers, missionaries and traders who were speakers of English and French. They wrote Ottawa words and sentences using the letters and orthographic conventions of their own languages, adapting them to the unfamiliar new language.<ref>Hanzeli, Victor, 1961; see especially Chs. 5 and 6</ref><ref>Goddard, Ives, 1996b, pp. 17, 20</ref> Indigenous writing in Ottawa was also based upon English or French, but only occurred sporadically through the nineteenth and 20th centuries.<ref>Pentland, David, 1996, pp. 261<U+2013>262</ref><ref>For general discussion see Walker, Willard, 1996, pp. 158, 173<U+2013>176</ref><ref>Rhodes, Richard and Evelyn Todd, 1981, pp. 62<U+2013>65</ref> Modern focus on literacy and use of written forms of the language has increased in the context of second language learning, where mastery of written language is viewed as a component of the language learning process.<ref name="NicholsWhiteiii"/> Although there has never been a generally accepted standard written form of Ottawa, interest in standardization has increased with the publication of a widely used dictionary in 1985 and reference grammar in 2001, which  provide models for spelling conventions.<ref name="Rhodes, Richard, 1985"/><ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001"/> A conference held in 1996 brought together speakers of all dialects of Ojibwe to review existing writing systems and make proposals for standardization.<ref>Ningewance, Patricia, 1999</ref>

===Early orthographic practices===
19th-century missionary authors who wrote in Ottawa include [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] missionary [[Frederic Baraga]] and [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican]] Frederick O<U+2019>Meara (illustration, this section).<ref name="OMeara54" /><ref>Baraga, Frederic, 1832</ref><ref>O<U+2019>Meara, Frederick, 1844</ref> Ottawa speaker Andrew Blackbird wrote a history of his people in English; an appended grammatical description of Ottawa and the Southwestern Ojibwe (Chippewa) dialect also contains vocabulary lists, short phrases, and translations of the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Lord's Prayer]].<ref name="Blackbird, Andrew J., 1887"/> Accurate transcriptions of Ottawa date from linguist Leonard Bloomfield<U+2019>s research with Ottawa speakers in the late 1930s and early 1940s.<ref name="Bloomfield, Leonard, 1958"/><ref>Nichols, John and Leonard Bloomfield, 1991</ref>

A tradition of indigenous literacy in Ottawa arose in the 19th century, as speakers of Ottawa on Manitoulin Island became literate in their own language.<ref name="Corbiere">Corbiere, Alan, 2003</ref> Manitoulin Island Ottawas who were Catholic learned to write from French Catholic missionaries using a French-influenced orthography,<ref>Pentland, David, 1996, p. 267</ref> while [[Methodism|Methodist]] and Anglican converts used English-based orthographies.<ref name="Corbiere58">Corbiere, Alan, 2003, p. 58</ref> Documents written in Ottawa by Ottawa speakers on Manitoulin Island between 1823 and 1910 include official letters and petitions, personal documents, official Indian band regulations, an official proclamation, and census statements prepared by individuals.<ref>Corbiere, Alan, 2003, pp. 58, 65, 68, 70</ref> Ottawa speakers from Manitoulin Island contributed articles to ''Anishinabe Enamiad'' ("the Praying Indian"), an Ojibwe newspaper started by [[Franciscan]] missionaries and published in [[Harbor Springs, Michigan|Harbor Springs]], Michigan between 1896 and 1902.<ref name="Corbiere"/>

It has been suggested that Ottawa speakers were among the groups that used the [[Great Lakes Algonquian syllabary]], a syllabic writing system derived from a European-based alphabetic orthography,<ref>Walker, Willard, 1996, pp. 168-169</ref> but supporting evidence is weak.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1996, pp. 126<U+2013>127</ref>

===Modern orthography===
Although there is no standard or official writing system for Ottawa, a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe,<ref name="Rhodes, Richard, 1985"/> a collection of texts,<ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph, 1998"/> and a descriptive grammar.<ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001"/> The same system is taught in programs for Ojibwe language teachers.<ref>Native Language Instructors' Program. [http://education.lakeheadu.ca/?display=page&pageid=174 Native Language Instructors' Program, Lakehead University] Faculty of Education, Lakehead University. Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. Retrieved on March 27, 2009.</ref><ref name="Ningewance, Patricia, 1999, p. 2">Ningewance, Patricia, 1999, p. 2</ref> One of its goals is to promote standardization of Ottawa writing so that language learners are able to read and write in a consistent way. By comparison, [[Ojibwe writing systems#Folk Spelling|folk phonetic spelling]] approaches to writing Ottawa based on less systematic adaptations of written English or French are more variable and idiosyncratic, and do not always make consistent use of alphabetic letters.<ref name="NicholsWhiteiii">Nichols, John and Lena White, 1987, p. iii</ref> While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications, its acceptance is not universal. Prominent Ottawa author [[Basil H. Johnston|Basil Johnston]] has explicitly rejected it, preferring to use a form of folk spelling in which the correspondences between sounds and letters are less systematic.<ref>Johnston, Basil, 2007, pp. vii-viii</ref><ref>Johnston, Basil, 1979</ref> Similarly, a lexicon representing Ottawa as spoken in Michigan and another based on Ottawa in Oklahoma, use English-based folk spellings distinct from that employed by Johnson.<ref name="Dawes, Charles, 1982"/><ref>Cappell, Constance, 2006, pp. 157-196, 232</ref>

The Ottawa writing system is a minor adaptation of a very similar one used for other dialects of [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] in Ontario and the United States, and widely employed in reference materials and text collections.<ref name="Nichols Nyholm Dict">Nichols, John and Earl Nyholm, 1995</ref><ref>Kegg, Maude, 1991</ref> Sometimes referred to as the [[Ojibwe writing systems#Double vowel system|Double Vowel system]]<ref name="Ningewance, Patricia, 1999, p. 2"/> because it uses doubled vowel symbols to represent Ottawa long vowels that are paired with corresponding short vowels, it is an adaptation attributed to Charles Fiero<ref name="NicholsWhiteiii" /> of the linguistically oriented system found in publications such as Leonard Bloomfield<U+2019>s ''Eastern Ojibwa.''<ref name="Bloomfield, Leonard, 1958"/> Letters of the [[English alphabet]] substitute for specialized [[International Phonetic Alphabet|phonetic symbols]], in conjunction with orthographic conventions unique to Ottawa. The system embodies two basic principles: (1) alphabetic letters from the English alphabet are used to write Ottawa, but with Ottawa sound values; (2) the system is [[Phoneme|phonemic]] in nature, in that each letter or letter combination indicates its basic sound value, and does not reflect all the phonetic detail that occurs. Accurate pronunciation cannot be learned without consulting a fluent speaker.<ref>Nichols, John and Earl Nyholm, 1995, p. xxiii</ref>

The Ottawa variant of this system uses the following consonant letters or [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: <blockquote>''b, ch, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, sh, t, w, y, z, zh''</blockquote>

The letters ''f, l,'' and ''r'' are found in loan words, such as ''telephonewayshin'' "give me a call" and ''refrigeratoring'' "in the refrigerator".<ref>Rhodes, Richard, 1985, pp. xxxi, xxxv</ref> Loan words that have recently been borrowed from English are typically written in standard [[English orthography]].<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 90</ref>

The letter ''h'' is used for the [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[<U+0294>]}}, which is represented in the broader Ojibwe version with the apostrophe. In Ottawa the apostrophe is reserved for a separate function noted below.<ref name ="Nichols Nyholm Dict"/> In a few primarily expressive words, orthographic ''h'' has the phonetic value [h]: ''aa haaw'' "OK".<ref>Rhodes, Richard, 1985, xlvi</ref>

Vowels are represented as follows:<blockquote>Long ''ii, oo, aa, e;'' Short ''i, o, a''</blockquote>

By convention the three long vowels that correspond to a short vowel are written double, while the single long vowel written as orthographic ''e'' that does not have a corresponding short vowel is not written doubled.<ref>Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 34</ref>

The apostrophe ''<nowiki><U+2019></nowiki>''&nbsp; is used to distinguish primary (underlying) consonant clusters from secondary clusters that arise when the rule of syncope deletes a vowel between two consonants. For example, orthographic ''ng'' must be distinguished from ''n<U+2019>g''. The former has the phonetic value {{IPA|[<U+014B>]}} (arising from place of articulation [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of {{IPA|/n/}} to the following velar consonant {{IPA|/<U+0261>/}}, which is then deleted in word-final position as in ''mnising'' {{IPA|[mn<U+026A>s<U+026A><U+014B>]}} "at the island"), while the latter has the phonetic value {{IPA|[n<U+0261>]}} as in ''san<U+2019>goo'' {{IPA|[san<U+0261>o<U+02D0>]}} "black squirrel".<ref name="Rhodes1985, xlix">Rhodes, Richard, 1985, p. xlix</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Algonquian languages|Ojibwe dialects}}

In the general model of linguistic change, "a single ancestor language (a proto-language) develops dialects which in time through the accumulation of changes become distinct languages."<ref name="Campbell2004,212-214">Campbell, Lyle, 2004, pp. 211<U+2013>212</ref> Continued changes in the descendant languages result in the development of dialects which again over time develop into distinct languages.<ref name="Campbell2004,212-214"/> The Ojibwe language is a historical descendant of [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]], the reconstructed ancestor language of the Algonquian languages. Ojibwe has subsequently developed a series of dialects including Ottawa, which is one of the three dialects of Ojibwe that has innovated the most through its historical development, along with Severn Ojibwe and Algonquin.<ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, pp. 43<U+2013>44"/>
