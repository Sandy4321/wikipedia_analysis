Agnosticism sometimes indicates [[doubt]] or a [[Skepticism|skeptical]] approach to questions.  In the popular sense, an agnostic is someone who neither believes nor disbelieves in the existence of a deity or deities, whereas a [[theist]] and an [[atheist]] believe and disbelieve, respectively.<ref name=RoweRoutledge/>

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]], an English biologist, coined the word ''agnostic'' in 1869. However, earlier thinkers have written works that promoted agnostic points of view. These thinkers include [[Sanjaya Belatthaputta]], a 5th-century [[Before Common Era|BCE]] Indian philosopher who expressed agnosticism about any afterlife,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html |title=Sama<U+00F1><U+00F1>aphala Sutta: The Fruits of the Contemplative Life | others=a part of the Digha Nikaya translated in 1997 by Thanissaro Bhikkhu |quote=If you ask me if there exists another world (after death),&nbsp;...

Since the time that [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] coined the term, many other thinkers have extensively written about agnosticism. {{TOC limit|3}}

{{quote|Agnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle&nbsp;... Positively the principle may be expressed: In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration. And negatively: In matters of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable.}}

According to philosopher [[William L. Rowe]], in the strict sense agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of rationally justifying the belief that deities do, or do not, exist.<ref name=RoweRoutledge/>

===Etymology===
''Agnostic'' ({{ety|grc|<U+1F00>- (a-)|without||[[wikt:<U+03B3><U+03BD><U+1FF6><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03C2>|<U+03B3><U+03BD><U+1FF6><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03C2>]] (gn<U+014D>sis)|knowledge}}) was used by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in a speech at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1869 to describe his philosophy which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Dixon| first = Thomas| title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2008| location = Oxford| page = 63| isbn = 978-0-19-929551-7}}</ref><ref name=EB-Agnosticism>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Antony|first=Flew|title=Agnosticism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/9356/agnosticism|work=Encyclopaedia Britannica online|accessdate=2011-12-15}}</ref>

Early [[Christian]] church leaders used the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[gnosis]]'' (knowledge) to describe "spiritual knowledge". Agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of [[Gnosticism]] in particular; Huxley used the term in a broader, more abstract sense.<ref name = "nknxjx">{{cite web|title=ag<U+00B7>nos<U+00B7>tic|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2011|website=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=agnostic&submit.x=20&submit.y=28|accessdate= 2013-11-15}}</ref>
Huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of [[Skepticism|skeptical]], evidence-based inquiry.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=97DaE6BzKTsC&pg=PA41 |title=Aphorisms and Reflections |first=Henrietta A. last=Huxley|publisher=Kessinger Publishing |date=2004 (reprint) |pages=41<U+2013>42|isbn=978-1-4191-0730-6}}</ref>

In recent years, scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used the word to mean "not knowable".<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, Additions Series, 1993</ref>
In technical and marketing literature, "agnostic" can also mean independence from some parameters<U+2014>for example, "platform agnostic"<ref name=SparkSheet>{{cite web|title=What Does Platform Agnostic Mean?|author=Sophie Woodrooffe and Dan Levy|website=Sparksheet|url=http://sparksheet.com/what-does-platform-agnostic-mean/|date=2012-09-09|accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> or "hardware agnostic"<ref name=Datacenterdynamics>{{cite web|website=Datacenter Dynamics|title=EMC AND NETAPP&nbsp;<U+2013> A SOFTWARE-DEFINED STORAGE BATTLE: Interoperability no longer matter of choice for big storage vendors|url=http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/focus/archive/2013/07/emc-and-netapp-%E2%80%93-software-defined-storage-battle|author=Yevgeniy Sverdlik|date=2013-07-31|accessdate = 2013-11-15}}</ref>

===Qualifying agnosticism===
[[Scottish Enlightenment]] philosopher [[David Hume]] contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt. He asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition (i.e. [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] such as "all bachelors are unmarried" or "all triangles have three corners").<ref>Hume, David, "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" (1748)</ref>

===Types of agnosticism===
A person calling oneself 'agnostic' is stating that he or she has no opinion on the existence of God, as there is no definitive evidence for or against.  Agnosticism has, however, more recently been subdivided into several categories. Variations include:
;[[Agnostic atheism]]: The view of those who do not ''believe'' in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to ''know'' if a deity does or does not exist.<ref name=Smith1979>{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=FI7ZAAAAMAAJ&dq=atheism+the+case+against+god&q=agnostic+theist#search_anchor |title=Atheism: The Case Against God |first=George H |last=Smith |authorlink=George H. Smith |pages=10<U+2013>11 |quote=Properly considered, agnosticism is not a third alternative to theism and atheism because it is concerned with a different aspect of religious belief. Theism and atheism refer to the presence or absence of belief in a god; agnosticism refers to the impossibility of knowledge with regard to a god or supernatural being. The term ''agnostic'' does not, in itself, indicate whether or not one believes in a god. Agnosticism can be either theistic or atheistic. |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-87975-124-1 }}

In his 1844 book, ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'', Kierkegaard writes:<ref>Kierkegaard, S<U+00F8>ren. ''Philosophical Fragments''. Ch. 3</ref>
{{quote|Let us call this unknown something: God. It is nothing more than a name we assign to it. The idea of demonstrating that this unknown something (God) exists, could scarcely suggest itself to Reason. For if God does not exist it would of course be impossible to prove it; and if he does exist it would be folly to attempt it. For at the very outset, in beginning my proof, I would have presupposed it, not as doubtful but as certain (a presupposition is never doubtful, for the very reason that it is a presupposition), since otherwise I would not begin, readily understanding that the whole would be impossible if he did not exist. But if when I speak of proving God's existence I mean that I propose to prove that the Unknown, which exists, is God, then I express myself unfortunately. For in that case I do not prove anything, least of all an existence, but merely develop the content of a conception.}}

===Thomas Henry Huxley===
[[File:ThomasHenryHuxley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Henry Huxley]]]]
Agnostic views are as old as [[philosophical skepticism]], but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the "unconditioned" (Hamilton) and the "unknowable" ([[Herbert Spencer]]). Though Huxley began to use the term "agnostic" in 1869, his opinions had taken shape some time before that date. In a letter of September 23, 1860, to [[Charles Kingsley]], Huxley discussed his views extensively:<ref name="Huxley1997">{{cite book|author=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=The Major Prose of Thomas Henry Huxley|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OAdUIXC32GkC&pg=PA357|year=1997|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-1864-6|pages=357<U+2013>}}</ref><ref name="Huxley2012">{{cite book|author=Leonard Huxley|title=Thomas Henry Huxley A Character Sketch|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YKNj1u0R4JcC&pg=PT41|date=7 February 2012|publisher=tredition|isbn=978-3-8472-0297-4|pages=41<U+2013>}}</ref>

Of the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude, Huxley gave the following account:<ref>{{cite book| title=Collected Essays, Vol. V: Science and Christian Tradition| first=Thomas| last=Huxley| isbn= 1-85506-922-9| publisher=Macmillan and Co 1893| pages=237<U+2013>239}}</ref>

The one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from them. They were quite sure they had attained a certain "gnosis,"<U+2013>had, more or less successfully, solved the problem of existence; while I was quite sure I had not, and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble. And, with Hume and Kant on my side, I could not think myself presumptuous in holding fast by that opinion&nbsp;...

So I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of "agnostic."

In 1939, Russell gave a lecture on ''The existence and nature of God'', in which he characterized himself as an atheist. He said:<ref>{{cite book| last=Russell| first= Bertrand| title=Collected Papers, Vol 10|page=255}}</ref>
{{quote|The existence and nature of God is a subject of which I can discuss only half. If one arrives at a negative conclusion concerning the first part of the question, the second part of the question does not arise; and my position, as you may have gathered, is a negative one on this matter.}}

{{quote|That sort of God is, I think, not one that can actually be disproved, as I think the omnipotent and benevolent creator can.}}

In Russell's 1947 pamphlet, ''Am I An Atheist Or An Agnostic?''

==Criticism==
Agnosticism is criticized from a variety of standpoints. Some religious thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to [[materialism]].  Some atheists criticize the use of the term ''agnosticism'' as functionally indistinguishable from ''atheism''; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the 'atheist label'.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Sofroniou|first=Andreas|title=Huxley's nonreligious agnosticism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/9356/agnosticism|work=Moral Philosophy, from Hippocrates to the 21st Aeon|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>

Some thinkers and philosophers deny the validity of agnosticism, seeing it as a check of man's capacity to know the reality.
by asserting that human intelligence, has a non-material, [[Spirituality|spiritual]] element.  They affirm that "not being able to see or hold some specific thing does not necessarily negate its existence," using [[gravity]], [[entropy]], [[reason]] and [[thought]] as examples.<ref name="Smith2012" />

===Theistic===
Theistic critics claim that agnosticism is impossible in practice, since a person can live only either as if God did not exist (''[[etsi deus non daretur]]''), or as if God did exist (''etsi deus daretur'').<ref name=SM>

====Christian====
According to [[Joseph Ratzinger]], ''strong agnosticism'' in particular limits contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific [[truth]].<ref name=YOJC/><ref name=TT/>  He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters.<ref name=YOJC>{{cite book| title=The Yes of Jesus Christ: Spiritual Exercises in Faith, Hope, and Love| first=Joseph| last=Ratzinger|publisher=Cross Roads Publishing|year=2005}}
</ref><ref name=TT>{{cite book| title=Truth and Tolerance: Christian Belief And World Religions| first=Joseph| last=Ratzinger|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2004}}</ref><ref>Benedict XVI, [http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/papal-address-at-university-of-regensburg Address at the University of Regensburg 2006]</ref> "Agnosticism", said Ratzinger, "is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man&nbsp;... The knowledge of God has always existed."<ref name=TT/> He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the [[scientific method]], a readiness to be purified by the truth.<ref name=YOJC/>

The [[Catholic Church]] sees merit in examining what it calls Partial Agnosticism, specifically those systems that "do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Agnosticism, II., |publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01215c.htm}}</ref> However, the Church is historically opposed to a full denial of the capacity of human reason to know God. The Council of the Vatican, relying on biblical [[scripture]], declares that "God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Agnosticism, VIII. |publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01215c.htm}}</ref>

Christian Philosopher [[Blaise Pascal]] argued that even if there were truly no evidence for God, agnostics should consider what is now known as [[Pascal's Wager]]: the [[Infinity|infinite]] expected value of acknowledging God is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence, and thus it is a safer "bet" to choose God.<ref name=PKPW>{{cite web |url=http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics/pascals-wager.htm| title=Argument from Pascal's Wager| year=2007 | accessdate=2008-05-25| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080605044148/http://peterkreeft.com/topics/pascals-wager.htm| archivedate=2008-06-05 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}

===Atheistic===
According to [[Richard Dawkins]], a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity. About himself, Dawkins continues that "I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden."<ref>''[[The God Delusion]]'' p.&nbsp;74</ref>
Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics: ''Temporary Agnostics in Practice'' (TAPs), and ''Permanent Agnostics in Principle'' (PAPs).  Dawkins considers temporary agnosticism an entirely reasonable position, but views permanent agnosticism as "fence-sitting, intellectual cowardice".<ref>''[[The God Delusion]]'' p.&nbsp;70</ref>

If the chosen definition is not coherent, the ignostic holds the [[theological noncognitivism|noncognitivist]] view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_noncognitivism/ |title=The Argument From Non-Cognitivism |accessdate=2010-10-01 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6N59bmP1Y |archivedate=2014-02-02}}</ref>

[[Alfred Ayer|A.J. Ayer]], [[Theodore Drange]], and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on the grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept "a deity exists" as a meaningful proposition which can be argued for or against.<ref>Ayer, ''Language'', 115: "There can be no way of proving that the existence of a God&nbsp;... is even probable.&nbsp;... For if the existence of such a god were probable, then the proposition that he existed would be an empirical hypothesis. And in that case it would be possible to deduce from it, and other empirical hypotheses, certain experimental propositions which were not deducible from those other hypotheses alone. But in fact this is not possible."</ref><ref name="Drange">Drange, ''Atheism''</ref>
