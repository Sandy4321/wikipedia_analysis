{{nihongo|'''Seta S<U+014D>jir<U+014D>'''|<U+702C><U+7530> <U+5B97><U+6B21><U+90CE>}}, addressed as '''Sojiro Seta''' in the [[English language|English-language]] [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]], is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' [[Fictional universe|universe]] created by [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]] for the series and developed into a [[media franchise]], which consists of a series of [[manga]], [[anime]], [[Original video animation|OVAs]], [[Film|movies]], [[soundtrack]]s, [[video game]]s, and other [[collectible]]s. In the story, he is [[Shishio Makoto]]'s right hand man. S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> has been favorably popular with the ''Rurouni Kenshin'' reader base, placing high in several popularity polls.<ref name="popular">{{cite book |title= Rurouni Kenshin, Volume 16 |last= Watsuki |first= Nobuhiro |publisher= Viz Media |year= 2005|chapter=Chapter 135|isbn= 1-59116-854-6 }}</ref>

==Creation and conception==
Nobuhiro Watsuki has stated that the character design of S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> is loosely based on [[Okita S<U+014D>ji]], the captain of the first Squad of the [[Shinsengumi]]. The name Seta S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> originates from "Okita S<U+014D>jir<U+014D>," the name Okita had in his early life. The specific personality model is from the Okita in [[Ry<U+014D>tar<U+014D> Shiba]]'s novel ''[[Shinsengumi Keppuroku]]'' ("Record of Shinsengumi Bloodshed"); in that version Okita "lost an important part in his human heart," making him without emotions and "pretty scary." Watsuki reported that some fans did not like the fact that a character modeled on Okita is a villain; Watsuki argued that since S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> is based on the ''Shinsengumi Keppuroku'' Okita, the design "works well" and that S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> is "a strong antagonist." Watsuki felt that S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> was more difficult to draw than Watsuki initially anticipated, and that he only accomplished around one fourth of what he imagined the character would appear in his mind. Watsuki had no design model for S<U+014D>jir<U+014D>; Watsuki envisioned Okita as having bangs ([[fringe (hair)|fringes]])<!--The English translation of Watsuki's statements uses bangs, so we use U.S. English-->, so to Watsuki it was no surprise that S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> also had bangs. Watsuki gave S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> a "slightly feminized air" so that S<U+014D>jir<U+014D>'s smile would "look good" on the character. In Volume 9 Watsuki stated that he wants to properly portray S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> since he is a popular character.<ref name="ProfileVol9">{{cite book |title= Rurouni Kenshin, Volume 9 |year= 2004|last= Watsuki |first= Nobuhiro |publisher= Viz Media |chapter=The Secret Life of Characters (26), Seta S<U+014D>jir<U+014D>|page= 86|isbn= 978-1591166696 }}</ref>

The fact that S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> has no emotions is also based on Shiba's version of Okita S<U+014D>ji. Watsuki said that this concept became one of the most difficult aspects to reflect in the drawing. Okita died when he was young, but Watsuki decided not to kill S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> in the story in order to atone for the murders he committed, but instead start living on his own instead of having someone make his decisions for him. He hoped to draw him in more of the next chapters but soon thought that would not be possible.<ref>{{cite book |title= Rurouni Kenshin, Volume 16 |year= 2005|last= Watsuki |first= Nobuhiro |publisher= Viz Media |chapter=The Secret Life of Characters (26) Amendment, Seta S<U+014D>jir<U+014D>|page= 122|isbn= 978-1591168546 }}</ref>

==Character outline==
===Personality===
[[Image:Soijiro Seta.JPG|thumb|220px|S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> as he appears in the [[anime]].]]
S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> is Shishio's right hand man, a young assassin trained by Shishio himself. S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> is known for his lack of ''kenki'' (offensive aura), or, simply, emotion. He possesses no anger and incites no fear in his enemies, other than with his sword. This is reflected in his appearance, as he looks very ordinary and has no distinctive features in either his dress or his face.

S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> is often seen smiling and has polite manners, always referring to others with Japanese suffixes. He is sarcastic, hiding his true emotions behind his smiling face. However, he does have a special relationship with [[List of Rurouni Kenshin characters#Komagata Yumi|Komagata Yumi]], who functions as an older-sister figure towards him. S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> usually dresses up in a blue [[Kimono#Men.27s_kimonos|kimono]] with white handguards.

===Background===
S<U+014D>jir<U+014D>'s constantly smiling face and polite manners stem from his tragic past. Born in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] during the first year of [[Bunky<U+016B>]] (1861),<ref name="The Second Secret">{{cite book |title= Rurouni Kenshin, Volume 16 |year= 2005|last= Watsuki |first= Nobuhiro |publisher= Viz Media |chapter=Act 134: The Second Secret|page= 83|isbn= 978-1591168546 }}</ref> S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> is an [[Legitimacy (law)|illegitimate child]]. S<U+014D>jir<U+014D>'s father left him in the care of his family, who badly mistreat him. He is assigned chores such as carrying rice to and from the family warehouse, and whenever he faltered, he was [[Physical abuse|beaten]] by his family. S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> built a defense against their lashings; he put on a smiling face, and endured the torture until they got tired of beating him and left him alone. 

One night, he meets Shishio, who was on the run from the police. S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> witnesses Shishio kill some police officers and Shishio is about to kill him for it until he notices S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> smiling and therefore spares him in exchange for food and bandages. Shishio tells S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> that only the strong may live and that his predicament is his own fault for being weak. This new mentality, and a sword given to him by Shishio, determine his defence when his family finds him housing Shishio. Sojiro quickly finds himself cornered by them, attempting to murder him and blame his death on Shishio, and lashes out, killing every one of them at the age of eight.<ref name="The Second Secret"/>

===Techniques===
[[Image:Shukuchi.JPG|thumb|220px|S<U+014D>jir<U+014D>'s ''[[shukuchi]]'' is fast enough that he can instantaneously appear behind [[Himura Kenshin]].]]
S<U+014D>jir<U+014D>'s apparent lack of emotion, his simple, insensitive mentality that ''the strong will live and the weak shall die'', and his skills make him a formidable foe for Kenshin. As a master swordsman of his own style, S<U+014D>jir<U+014D>'s abilities have earned him the nickname of {{nihongo|"Heaven's Sword"|<U+5929><U+5263>|''Tenken''|''Ten'' meaning Heaven and ''Ken'' meaning Sword, "Tenken" means swordsmanship of natural endowments}}. His ''[[shukuchi]]'' utilizes such powerful speed that, to an observer, it appears that the distance between the two fighters has shrunk (hence the name ''shukuchi'', which means "reduced earth"). 

During his fight with Kenshin, S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> continually states he's only moving "three steps below ''shukuchi''" or "two steps below ''shukuchi''." While moving at the speed his ''shukuchi'' utilizes, the only thing that can be seen is S<U+014D>jir<U+014D>'s footsteps ripping through the tatami mats. During "one step below ''shukuchi''", he is able to attack from an omni-directional angle, utilizing not only horizontal but veritical space.<ref>{{cite book |title= Rurouni Kenshin, Volume 16 |last= Watsuki |first= Nobuhiro|year=2005|publisher= Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 133|isbn= 1-59116-854-6 }}</ref> While performing true ''shukuchi'', he completely disappears and cannot be seen, even by Kenshin. S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> can dodge the {{nihongo|''Kuzu-ry<U+016B>sen''|<U+4E5D><U+982D><U+9F8D><U+9583>||lit. "Nine-headed Dragon Flash"}},<ref name="RKv15ch129">{{cite book |title= Rurouni Kenshin, Volume 15 |last= Watsuki |first= Nobuhiro|year=2005|publisher= Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 129|isbn= 1-59116-810-4 }}</ref> a move which apparently cannot be evaded even by Kenshin himself. S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> is also the first one ever to slash Kenshin in the back in the series.<ref name="RKv15ch129"/>

S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> is also well versed in the ''Batt<U+014D>jutsu'' style like Kenshin, as is evident when he decides to use a stance similar to Kenshin's and when he destroys Kenshin's first ''[[Rurouni Kenshin#Sakabat<U+014D>|sakabat<U+014D>]]''. Combining the true speed of ''shukuchi'' with the Batt<U+014D>jutsu, he has created his only named technique, {{nihongo|''Shuntensatsu''|<U+77AC><U+5929><U+6BBA>||lit. "Instant Heaven Kill"}}, meaning "immediate killing by heaven's sword". It is named this because the speed behind the attack is so swift that the opponent dies instantly before falling to the floor. Judging by its appearance in the anime, it appears that the Shuntensatsu is very similar to Kenshin's Amakakeru Ryu no Hirameki, except that it uses speed rather than strength.

==Plot overview==
S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> first appears when he assassinates <U+014C>kubo, who is on the way to a meeting. S<U+014D>jir<U+014D>'s usage of his superhuman speed allows him to enter <U+014C>kubo's carriage unnoticed. Disgruntled Samurai are already on their way to kill <U+014C>kubo, but S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> finishes him off before they can, although it is the samurai who officially take the credit (the real-life <U+014C>kubu being killed by them).
Later, after Senkaku is defeated by Kenshin, S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> duels with Kenshin using [[Batt<U+014D>jutsu]], resulting in a tie due to the breaking of their swords. S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> is then assigned by Shishio to gather the Ten Swords located in the east side of Japan.

When Kenshin finally arrives at the Room of Reduced Space in Shishio's lair, he finds S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> waiting for him. As they begin to duel, it seems Sojiro holds the upper hand, bewildering Kenshin with his superior speed. But when the confrontation forces S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> to question Shishio's principles, his true emotions surface, allowing Kenshin to negate his advantage by reading/predicting his moves. As he struggles with his own confusion, the battle reaches its climax with Kenshin using the Amakakeru Ry<U+016B> no Hirameki and S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> using his Shuntensatsu. The result is a victory for Kenshin, but S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> discovers the key to his move, having spotted it before he used the Amakakeru Ry<U+016B> no Hirameki. 

S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> informs Yumi of the key to Kenshin's ultimate attack and asks her to tell Shishio. Before she leaves, he asks her for one last favor; to return the Wakizashi to Shishio that had once saved him from being murdered (by his family). S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> then leaves Shishio's faction to become a wanderer seeking to find his own truth.

==Reception==
Daryl Surat of ''[[Otaku USA]]'' said that while S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> is a "kid," the character scored highly in popularity polls among readers because S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> always smiles despite the abuse inflicted upon him. Surat used S<U+014D>jir<U+014D> as an example of ''Rurouni Kenshin'' being a "neo-shonen" work that appeals to boys and girls.<ref name="Surat34">Surat, Daryl. "Heart of Steel." ''[[Otaku USA]]''.
