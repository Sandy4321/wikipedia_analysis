'''Cyclone Kalunde''' (also known as '''Intense Tropical Cyclone Kalunde''') was the strongest storm of the [[2002<U+2013>03 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season]]. The eleventh [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] and sixth cyclone of the season, Kalunde formed on March&nbsp;4 from an area of disturbed weather east<U+2013>southeast of [[Diego Garcia]]. The storm steadily strengthened and attained [[Tropical cyclone scales#South-Western_Indian_Ocean|severe tropical storm intensity]] on March&nbsp;6. After starting a phase of [[rapid deepening]], Kalunde attained cyclone intensity the next day. Kalunde attained its peak intensity on March 10, becoming an intense tropical cyclone. It maintained its peak strength for a day; shortly thereafter, the system began to weaken. After undergoing an [[eyewall replacement cycle]], the storm brushed Rodrigues. Shortly after doing so, Kalunde weakened into a tropical cyclone and later a severe tropical storm. Two days later, on March&nbsp;16, the cyclone transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] and dissipated the next day.

Cyclone Kalunde brought [[United States Dollar|US]]$3.15&nbsp;million in damage to Rodrigues Island. A total of 1,600&nbsp;homes and 40&nbsp;boats were damaged. Severe coastal damage took place across the island; many roads were washed out. [[Power outage]]s also occurred across the island, delaying residents access to information pertaining to Kalunde. About 80&nbsp;percent of the drinking water was contaminated and the entire food crop was destroyed. However, no deaths were reported.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Kalunde 2003 track.png}}
An area of [[convection]] developed on March&nbsp;3 several hundred miles to the east<U+2013>southeast of [[Diego Garcia]]. The next day, [[Meteo-France]] (MFR) issued the first bulletin on Tropical Disturbance&nbsp;14 while located {{convert|580|mi|km|abbr=on}} east<U+2013>southeast of Diego Garcia. In an environment of weak to moderate [[wind shear]], MFR upgraded the system to tropical depression status. Later on March&nbsp;4, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) issued a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert]] (TCFA) for the disturbance as shower activity increased, though it initially concentrated west<U+2013>southwest of the [[atmospheric circulation]]. MFR upgraded the depression to [[tropical cyclone scale|moderate tropical storm]] status at 0600&nbsp;[[Universal Time Coordinate|UTC]] on March&nbsp;5; subsequently, the Meteorological Service of [[Mauritius]] assigned the system the name ''Kalunde''.<ref name=gpsummary /> Moving west<U+2013>northwest, the JTWC issued their first warning on the system.<ref name=jtwcreport>{{cite report|title=2003 Annual Tropical Cyclone Report|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/2003atcr.pdf|publisher=[[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]|accessdate=October 14, 2012|author=Furze, Peter|coauthors=Preble, Amanda|pages=467<U+2013>770}}</ref> Initially, Kalunde did not become much better organized even though deep convection was still increasing. Cyclone Kalunde steadily intensified over the next couple of days while performing a small clockwise loop. MFR upgraded Kalunde to severe tropical storm status at 1200&nbsp;UTC on March&nbsp;6. At 1800&nbsp;UTC, JTWC reported <small>1-minute sustained</small> winds of {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}. On March&nbsp;7, Kalunde began to undergo [[rapid deepening|rapid intensification]], and at 0600&nbsp;UTC the MFR upgraded it to a tropical cyclone. At the same time, JTWC also estimated winds of 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph), the equivalent of a [[Category 1 hurricane]] on the [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale]] (SSHWS).<ref name=gpsummary />

[[File:TC Kalunde 12 mar 2003 0610Z.jpg|thumb|175px|Kalunde undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle.]]
After the formation of an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], Kalunde continued to intensify rapidly and at 1800&nbsp;UTC March&nbsp;7 MFR declared the system an intense cyclone. Simultaneously, JTWC estimated that Kalunde had attained winds of {{convert|215|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}} while located several hundred miles south<U+2013>southwest of Diego Garcia. Continuing to trek southwest by a [[ridge (meteorology)|mid-level ridge]] to the southeast, the rapid intensification trend continued until it leveled off early on March&nbsp;8. At this time, the JTWC reported winds of {{convert|255|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}, equivalent to Category 5 intensity on the SSHWS. Subsequently, MFR remarked that the Intense Tropical Cyclone had reached its peak wind speed of {{convert|215|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}. After attaining peak intensity, MFR and the JTWC began to lower their intensity estimates as thunderstorms began to erode in the northwestern quadrant of the [[eyewall]].<ref name=gpsummary />

Moving slowly southwest, Intense Tropical Cyclone Kalunde underwent an eyewall replacement cyclone late on March&nbsp;9. The next day, the JTWC notes that Kalunde re-intensified somewhat; however, this is not supported by MFR<U+2019>s estimates. While slowly approaching the small island of Rodrigues, Kalunde was estimated (according to MFR) to have winds of {{convert|140|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}. On March&nbsp;12, Kalunde passed 55&nbsp;km (35&nbsp;mi) away from Rodrigues. Meanwhile, the JTWC reported winds of {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}. After passing {{convert|410|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=5}} southwest of Rodrigues, MFR downgraded Kalunde to severe tropical storm status at 0000&nbsp;UTC on March&nbsp;14. Twelve hours later, the center of circulation became exposed from the convection. Kalunde continued trekking south-southeastward on the March&nbsp;15 as it underwent [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical transition]]. The JTWC stopped monitoring the low at 1200&nbsp;UTC while estimating winds of {{convert|55|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}. At 1800&nbsp;UTC on March&nbsp;15, MFR declared the system extratropical, located approximately {{convert|690|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=5}} south-southeast of Rodrigues. The agency officially stopped tracking the system at 1200&nbsp;UTC the next day<ref name=gpsummary>{{cite report|title=Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary March 2003|url=http://www.australiansevereweather.com/cyclones/2003/summ0303.htm|publisher=Australian Severe Weather Index|accessdate=November 24, 2012|author=Padget, Gary}}</ref> though the storm finally dissipated on March 17. <ref name=CS>{{cite web|title=2003 KALUNDE (2003062S10080)|url=http://storm5.atms.unca.edu/browse-ibtracs/browseIbtracs.php?name=v03r02-2003062S10080#source|publisher=Climate Stewardship|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref>
