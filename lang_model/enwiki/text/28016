==History==
{{Main|History of Milton Keynes}}

===Birth of a "New City"<!-- Leave this as 'city', it's in inverted commas for a reason. All the 1960s government papers and MKDC design documents described it as a 'new city'. The term 'New City' remains in common use locally, particularly to distinguish the wider urban area from the existing towns that contributed to it. Towns within a town would be totally confusing. -->===
In the 1960s, the British government decided that a further generation of [[new towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] in the south-east of England was needed to relieve housing congestion in London.

Planning control was taken from elected [[Local government|local authorities]] and delegated to the [[Milton Keynes Development Corporation]] (MKDC).

The Corporation's strongly [[Modern architecture|modernist]] designs featured regularly in the magazines ''[[Architectural Design]]'' and the ''[[Architects' Journal]]''. MKDC was determined to learn from the mistakes made in the earlier [[New Towns]] and revisit the [[Garden city movement|Garden City ideals]]. They set in place the characteristic [[Milton Keynes grid road system|grid roads]] that run between districts, as well as the intensive planting, lakes and parkland that are so evident today. Central Milton Keynes was not intended to be a traditional [[town centre]] but a business and shopping district that supplemented the Local Centres in most of the Grid Squares.<ref name="llewelyn-david"/>  This non-hierarchical devolved city plan was a departure from the English New Towns tradition and envisaged a wide range of industry and diversity of housing styles and tenures across the city. The largest and almost the last of the British New Towns, Milton Keynes has stood the test of time far better than most, and has proved flexible and adaptable.<ref name="bishop1">Jeff Bishop ''Milton Keynes{{spaced ndash}} the Best of Both Worlds?

The Government wound up MKDC in 1992, 25 years after the new town was created, transferring control to the Commission for New Towns (CNT) and then finally to [[English Partnerships]], with the planning function returning to local authority control (since 1974 and the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the  Borough of Milton Keynes). From 2004 to 2011, a Government [[quango]], the [[Milton Keynes Partnership]], had development control powers to accelerate the growth of Milton Keynes.

Along with many other towns and boroughs, Milton Keynes competed for [[city status in the United Kingdom|formal city status]] in the 2000, 2002 and 2012 competitions, but was not successful. Nevertheless, the term "city" is used by its citizens, local media and bus services to describe itself, perhaps because the term "town" is taken to mean one of the constituent towns. Road signs refer to "Central Milton Keynes" or "Shopping" when directing traffic to the town centre.

===Prior history===
{{main|History of Milton Keynes}}
[[File:MiltonKeynesHoard.JPG|thumb|upright|Reproductions of the [[Milton Keynes Hoard]] ([[Milton Keynes Museum]])]]
The area that was to become Milton Keynes encompassed a landscape that has a rich historic legacy. The area to be developed was largely farmland and undeveloped villages, but with evidence of permanent settlement dating back to the [[Bronze Age]]. Before construction began, every area was subject to detailed archaeological investigation: doing so has provided a unique insight into the history of a large sample of the landscape of south-central England. There is evidence of [[Iron Age]], [[Romano-British]], [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]], [[Anglo-Norman]], [[Medieval]] and [[Industrial revolution]] settlements. Collections<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clutch.open.ac.uk |title=Welcome to the Millennium CLUTCH Project |publisher=Clutch.open.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> of [[oral history]] covering the 20th century completes a picture that is described in detail in [[History of Milton Keynes|another article]].

When the boundary of Milton Keynes was defined in 1967, some 40,000 people<ref name="population">{{cite web|url=http://www.mkweb.co.uk/Milton_Keynes_General/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=285 |title=History in Milton Keynes &#124; History Timeline, Local Town History & Visitor Map <U+2013> Modern Milton Keynes |publisher=Mkweb.co.uk |date=22 October 2004 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> lived in three towns and seven villages in the "designated area" of {{convert|21863|acre|sqkm}}.

:''The concepts that heavily influenced the design of the town are described in detail in article [[urban planning]]{{spaced ndash}} see 'cells' under [[Urban planning#Planning and aesthetics|Planning and aesthetics]] (referring to grid squares).See also article [[single-use zoning]].''

Since the radical plan form and large scale of Milton Keynes attracted international attention, early phases of the town include work by celebrated architects, including [[Richard MacCormac|Sir Richard MacCormac]], [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Lord Norman Foster]], [[Henning Larsen]], [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]], [[John Winter (architect)|John Winter]], and Martin Richardson.<ref name="bishop2">Jef Bishop ''Milton Keynes{{spaced ndash}} the Best of Both Worlds? Public and professional views of a new city.'' University of Bristol School for Advanced Urban Studies. Retrieved 13 February 2007.</ref>  The Corporation itself attracted talented young architects led by the young and charismatic Derek Walker. Though strongly committed to sleek "Miesian" [[minimalism]] inspired by the German/American architect [[Mies van der Rohe]] they also developed a strand of [[contextualism]] in advance of the wider adoption of commercial [[Postmodernism|Post-Modernism]] as an [[architectural style]] in the 1980s. In the Miesian tradition were the Pineham Sewage Works, which Derek Walker regarded as his finest achievement, and the [[Milton Keynes Shopping Centre|Shopping Building]] designed by Stuart Mosscrop and Christopher Woodward, which the [[Twentieth Century Society]] ''[[inter alia]]'' regards as the finest twentieth century retail building in Britain. The contextual tradition that ran alongside it is best exemplified by the Corporation's infill scheme at Cofferidge Close, Stony Stratford, designed by [[Wayland Tunley]], which carefully inserts into a historic stretch of High Street a modern retail facility, offices and [[Parking lot|car park]]. The [[Development Corporation]] also led an ambitious [[Art in Milton Keynes#Public art|Public art]] programme.

===Grid squares===

Do you lay it out like an American city, rigid orthogonal from side to side?  Being more sensitive in 1966-7, the designers decided that the grid concept should apply but should be a lazy grid following the flow of land, its valleys, its ebbs and flows. That would be nicer to look at, more economical and efficient to build, and would sit more beautifully as a landscape intervention.

{{Main|Milton Keynes grid road system||List of districts in Milton Keynes}}
Milton Keynes Development Corporation planned the major road layout according to [[street hierarchy]] principles, using a [[Grid plan|grid pattern]] of approximately {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} intervals, rather than on the more conventional [[wikt:radial|radial]] pattern found in older settlements. Major internal roads run between communities, rather than through them: these distributor roads are known locally as ''grid roads'' and the spaces between them{{spaced ndash}} the districts{{spaced ndash}} are known as ''grid squares''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Derek |last=Walker |title=The Architecture and Planning of Milton Keynes |publisher=Architectural Press |year=1982 |pages=&nbsp;8 |location=London|isbn=0-85139-735-2}} cited in {{cite book|first=Mark |last=Clapson |title=A Social History of Milton Keynes: Middle England/Edge City |pages=&nbsp;40 |publisher=Frank Cass |location=London |year=2004|isbn=0-7146-8417-1}}</ref> Intervals of {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} were chosen so that people would always be within walking distance of a bus stop. Consequently each grid square is a semi-autonomous community, making a unique collective of 100 clearly identifiable neighbourhoods within the overall urban environment. The grid squares have a variety of development styles, ranging from conventional urban development and industrial parks to original rural and modern urban and pseudo-rural developments. Most grid squares have Local Centres, intended as local retail hubs and most with community facilities as well. Originally intended under the Master Plan to sit alongside the Grid Roads, the Local Centres were mostly in fact built embedded in the communities and some are becoming unviable as a result of this and pressure from the new hypermarkets.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Roads and cycleways===
{{Main|Milton Keynes redway system|Segregated cycle facilities}}
[[Roundabout]] junctions were built at intersections because the [[Milton Keynes grid road system|grid roads]] were intended to carry large volumes of traffic: this type of junction is efficient at dealing with these volumes. The major roads are [[dual carriageway]], the others are [[single carriageway]]. Along one side of each [[single carriageway]] grid road there is a (grassed) reservation to permit dualling or additional transport infrastructure at a later date. The edges of each grid square are landscaped and densely planted, some additionally have [[berm]]s. The purpose of the [[berms]] is to reduce traffic noise for adjacent residents, but traffic noise can be significant at many locations even some distance from the grid roads.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Traffic movements are fast, with relatively little congestion since there are alternative routes to any particular destination. The [[national speed limit]] applies on [[dual carriageway]] sections of the grid roads ({{convert|70|mph|abbr=on|0}}) and most single carriageway grid roads ({{convert|60|mph|abbr=on|0}}), although some single carriageway [[speed limit]]s have now been reduced to {{convert|40|mph|abbr=on}}. Consequently the risk to unwary [[pedestrians]] and turning traffic is significant, although pedestrians rarely need to cross grid roads [[At-grade intersection|at grade]], as [[underpass]]es exist in several places along each stretch of all of the grid roads. However, the new districts to be added by the [[expansion plans for Milton Keynes]] will depart from this model, with less separation and using 'at grade' crossings. Monitoring station data<ref name="localair">{{cite web|author=Milton Keynes Council |url=http://www.mkweb.co.uk/environmental-health/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=17335 |title=Milton Keynes Council- Local Air Quality Management <U+2013> Environme |publisher=Mkweb.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> shows that pollution is lower than in other settlements of a similar size. This can be partially attributed to the large number of trees, especially as trees line grid roads in most places.

There is a separate [[cycleway]] network (the "[[Milton Keynes redway system|redways]]") that runs through the grid-squares and sometimes runs alongside the grid-road network. This was designed to segregate slow moving cycle and pedestrian traffic from fast moving motor traffic. In practice, it is mainly used for leisure [[cycling]] rather than commuting, mainly because the cycle routes include many underpasses beneath the grid-roads and because they take meandering scenic routes rather than straight lines. Despite what appears to be a desirable facility, rates of cycle commuting in Milton Keynes are well below the national average for urban areas. The [[Milton Keynes redway system|detailed article]] includes a critical appraisal.

===Height===
[[File:The Hub Milton Keynes towers.jpg|thumb|The Hub:MK, built between 2006 and 2008. The taller glass tower, Manhattan House, has fourteen stories.]]
The original design guidance declared that "no building [be] taller than the tallest tree". However, the [[English Partnerships#Milton Keynes Partnership|Milton Keynes Partnership]], in its [[expansion plans for Milton Keynes]], believed that [[Central Milton Keynes]] (and elsewhere) needed "landmark buildings" and subsequently lifted the height restriction for the area. As a result, high rise buildings have been built in the central business district. Four of the pedestrian underpasses were closed in order to 'normalise' the streetscape of Central Milton Keynes and the character of the area was set to change under government pressure to increase densities of development. These changes are being opposed by pressure groups such as [[Urban Eden]] and the Milton Keynes Forum. More recent local plans have protected the existing boulevard framework and underpasses following the dissolution of Milton Keynes Partnership.

Recent large-scale buildings include ''The Pinnacle:MK'' on Midsummer Boulevard and the ''Vizion'' development on Avebury Boulevard. The Pinnacle was the largest office building to be constructed in Milton Keynes in 25 years. More recently the Network Rail National Centre has been built at the western limit of Silbury Boulevard; this building occupies a large land area but only rises to the equivalent of six stories; a return towards the design of the original Central Milton Keynes developments.

===Linear parks===
[[File:Caldecotte Lake.jpg|thumb|Caldecotte Lake, Milton Keynes]]
The [[flood plain]]s of the [[River Great Ouse|Great Ouse]] and of its tributaries (the [[River Ouzel|Ouzel]] and some brooks) have been protected as [[linear park]]s that run right through Milton Keynes. The [[Grand Union Canal]] is another green route (and demonstrates the level geography of the area{{spaced ndash}} there is just one minor lock in its entire {{convert|10|mi|abbr=on}} route through from [[Fenny Stratford]] to the "Iron Trunk" [[Navigable aqueduct|Aqueduct]] over the Ouse at [[Wolverton]]). The [[Milton Keynes redway system]] of cycleways and footpaths uses these and other routes. The [[Park system]] was designed by [[landscape architect]] Peter Youngman, who also developed landscape precepts for the whole town: groups of grid squares were to be planted with different selections of trees and shrubs in order to give them distinct identities. However the landscaping of parks and of the grid roads was evolved under the leadership of Neil Higson, who from 1977 took over as Chief Landscape Architect and made the original grand but not entirely practical landscape plan more subtle.

A policy of creating "settings, strings, beads" for landscape features was introduced: 'settings' for historic villages and landscape features, 'strings' of landscape to make the linear parks hang together and 'beads' of [[public space]] where residents might linger. Higson also made the landscaping of the Grid Roads, one of the features of Milton Keynes, more subtle, with 'windows' cut into the roadside planting so that motorists travelling through had a sense of the major town they were in; early critics had said of Milton Keynes 'there is no there there', as the town could not be seen by the motorist just passing through. Now that the trees and shrubs have matured, the skill and lavish scale of the Grid Road planting makes a dramatic and welcome change from the monotony of many British towns and cities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==="City in the forest"===
The original Development Corporation design concept aimed<ref name="walker2"/> for a "forest city" and its foresters planted millions of trees from its own nursery in Newlands in the following years. As of 2006, the urban area has 20 million trees. Following the [[Liquidation|winding up]] of the Development Corporation the lavish landscapes of the Grid Roads and of the major parks were transferred to The Parks Trust, a [[Foundation (charity)|charity]] which is independent from the municipal authority and which was intended to resist pressures to build on the parks over time. The Parks Trust is endowed with a portfolio of commercial properties, the income of which pay for the upkeep of the green spaces, a maintenance model which has attracted international attention.<ref name="parkstrust1">[http://www.theparkstrust.com/parks-trust/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=33214 ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref>

===Further development plans===

In June 2004 [[Milton Keynes Partnership]] Committee (MKPC), was created by the Government and was a committee of the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA), the national housing and regeneration agency for England. MKPC was created to ensure a co-ordinated approach to planning and delivery of growth and development in the <U+2018>new city<U+2019>.

The Partnership brought together Milton Keynes Council, HCA, Local Strategic Partnership representatives from the health, community and business sectors and independent representation. The role of MKPC was to co-ordinate and implement the delivery of growth and ensure that homes, infrastructure, jobs and community facilities were provided as part of a joined up approach.

The day-to-day activities of MKPC were carried out by its staff of management, professional and technical experts, known collectively as Milton Keynes Partnership (MKP).

Milton Keynes Partnership was disbanded in 2011,<ref name="mkp1">{{cite web|url=http://www.miltonkeynespartnership.info |title=Milton Keynes Partnership |publisher=Miltonkeynespartnership.info |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> holding its last meeting in March of that year.

There are two museums: the [[Bletchley Park]] complex, which as well as housing the museum of wartime cryptography, also hosts the National Museum of Computing including a working replica of the [[Colossus computer]], and the [[Milton Keynes Museum]], which includes the Stacey Hill Collection of rural life that existed before the foundation of the new town.

The town also has a literature scene, with groups like Speakeasy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mkweb.co.uk/Art/Speakeasy |title=Milton Keynes <U+2013> Speakeasy |publisher=MKWeb |date=22 October 2004 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> meeting regularly and hosting performance events, and the town's only poetry magazine, [[Monkey Kettle]] coming out twice a year. In addition, two [[performance poetry]] groups exist in the town{{spaced ndash}} Poetry Kapow!,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetrykapow.co.uk |title=MK Poetry Kapow! Homepage |publisher=Poetrykapow.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> an offshoot of Monkey Kettle though now independent of the parent organisation, specialising in live, multi-discipline, interactive poetry/art/music events, usually featuring [[poetry slam|slam]]s; and Tongue in Chic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tongueinchicpoets.com |title=Tongue in Chic Poets <U+2013> supporting performance of poetry and the spoken word |publisher=Tongueinchicpoets.com |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> a regular [[open mic]] poetry event which features headline poets such as [[Rachel Pantechnicon]] and [[John Hegley]]. Between them, the two groups supply members of Bardcore,<ref>[http://www.poetrykapow.co.uk/bardcore ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> a semi-professional group of 4<U+2013>6 poets who work collaboratively on performance poetry projects.

In May 2011, the outgoing Mayor, Debbie Brock announced the appointment of Mark Niel as the first official Milton Keynes' Poet Laureate.<ref>{{citation|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-13502872| title = Mark Niel appointed Milton Keynes' first Poet Laureate| date = 23 May 2011| publisher = BBC| work = www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

In July 2010, Milton Keynes' first independent Central Arts Centre was opened by Radio One DJ [[Jo Whiley]]. The centre is regenerated from the disused Central Bus Station and former Chicago Rock Cafe. It is home to the existing "Buszy"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebuszy.com |title=Ultra Modern Youth & Community, Cultural & Arts Hub |publisher=Buszy |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> Skate Plaza, which is where the name for the regenerated venue has come from. It is managed and operated by Make a Difference<ref>[http://www.mad-uk.org]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> a community interest company which in 2011 was awarded a "Big Society" award for their positive activities and opportunities for young people and the wider community. The Buszy is the social enterprise arm of Make a Difference. All profits raised by the cultural activity at the venue are re-invested into Make a Difference. The venue hosts independent cinema, live performance, gigs, art shows/exhibitions, dance activity, a thrift shop, office and conference facilities and the city's only social enterprise hub.

'''Westbury Arts Centre''' is situated in the west of Milton Keynes, near Shenley Wood. And is based in a 16th Century grade 2 listed Farmhouse building. The Art Centre has been providing spaces for professional working artist to create work since 1994. The oldest part of the house was built in the sixteenth century and has been greatly extended over the years. It has several acres of garden and is home to several protected species of bats and newts. Including moat.
[[File:ConcreteCows.jpg|thumb|left|Liz Leyh's iconic "[[Concrete Cows]]"]]
Milton Keynes also boasts several [[choir]]s{{spaced ndash}} the OU Choir, the Milton Keynes Chorale, the New English Singers, the Cornerstone Choir, Quorum,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quorummk.org.uk |title=Quorum choir at Milton Keynes |publisher=Quorummk.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> and others, along with a variety of amateur drama groups, and amateur musical theatre groups.

In 1981, the main shopping area in the town centre was used as the filming location for the music video to [[Cliff Richard|Cliff Richard's]] hit [[Wired for Sound]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://learningfrommiltonkeynes.com/2008/12/22/cliff-richard-is-wired-for-sound-in-mk/ |title=Cliff Richard is Wired for Sound in MK |publisher=Learning From Milton Keynes |date=22 December 2008 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> Milton Keynes Forum<ref>{{cite web|author=Milton Keynes Council |url=http://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/coin/home.asp?ID=2121 |title=Milton Keynes Council <U+2013> COIN |publisher=Milton-keynes.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> is the registered [[civic society]] for the town.

==Education==
[[File:Milton Keynes University.JPG|thumb|University Centre Milton Keynes.]]
The [[Open University]]'s headquarters are based in the Walton Hall district, though as this is a [[distance learning]] institution, the only students resident on campus are approximately 200 full-time postgraduates. [[Cranfield University]], an all-postgraduate institution, is in nearby [[Cranfield]], Bedfordshire. [[Milton Keynes College]] provides [[further education]] up to [[foundation degree]] level, however a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]]<ref>Milton Keynes College, UCMK. [http://www.mkcollege.ac.uk/Default.aspx?pageId=2&CourseLevel=Higher&CourseCode=0881-1%2f1 Postgraduate Certificate in Education, in partnership with and accredited by Oxford Brookes University] Retrieved 6 August 2009</ref> course is available; run in partnership with and accredited by [[Oxford Brookes University]].

In 1991 [[Leicester Polytechnic]] established a purpose built [[polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnic]] campus in Kents Hill in Milton Keynes, opposite the Open University's Walton Hall site, which was officially opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1992. This was originally branded 'The Polytechnic: Milton Keynes'. Later in 1992 Leicester Polytechnic gained [[university]] status and was renamed [[De Montfort University]] and the site was rebranded De Montfort University Milton Keynes. However, DMU closed the MK site in 2003 and the Open University has expanded to take over the buildings.

Although the town does not yet have its own conventional local university, its founders hope that the [[University Campus Milton Keynes]] will be the seed for a future 'Milton Keynes University'. It is currently the UK's largest population centre without its own university proper.

Like many parts of the UK, the state secondary schools in Milton Keynes are [[Comprehensive school]]s, such as [[Stantonbury Campus]] and [[Denbigh School]], although schools in the rest of Buckinghamshire still use the [[Tripartite System]]. Results are above the national average, though below that of the rest of Buckinghamshire{{spaced ndash}} but the [[demography]] of Milton Keynes is also far closer to the national average than is the latter. Access to selective schools is still possible in Milton Keynes as the grammar schools in Buckingham and Aylesbury accept some pupils from within the unitary authority area, with Buckinghamshire County Council operating bus services to ferry pupils to the schools.

Private schools in Milton Keynes include the 3 to 18 mixed sex [[Webber Independent School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webberindependentschool.com/home.php |title=The Webber Independent School |publisher=The Webber Independent School |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> and the 2<U+00BD> to 11 mixed sex Milton Keynes Preparatory School.<ref>{{cite web|author=Autumn Term 2012 |url=http://www.mkprep.co.uk/ |title=Private school for children aged 2 months to 11 years old &#124; Milton Keynes Preparatory School |publisher=Mkprep.co.uk |date=5 September 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref>

The [[Safety Centre]] is a purpose-built interactive centre which provides safety education to visiting schools and youth groups via its full-size interactive demonstrations known as Hazard Alley. Another educational organisation is the Milton Keynes City Discovery Centre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mkcdc.org.uk |title=MKCDC at Bradwell Abbey |publisher=Mkcdc.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> at [[Bradwell Abbey#Bradwell Abbey today|Bradwell Abbey]], which holds an extensive archive about Milton Keynes. MKCDC is therefore a research facility, as well as offering a broad education programme (with a focus on urban geography and local history) to schools, universities and professionals. MKCDC also holds an annual programme of events at the medieval [[priory]] site on which they are based.

==Government and infrastructure==
[[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) previously had been located in Milton Keynes but moved to [[Cheltenham]] in the early 1950s.<ref>MacAskill, Ewen, Julian Borger, Nick Hopkins, Nick Davies and James Ball. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-mastering-the-internet Mastering the internet: how GCHQ set out to spy on the world wide web]." ''[[The Guardian]]''. Friday 21 June 2013. Retrieved on 21 June 2013.</ref>

==Communications and media==
Milton Keynes has two [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial radio]] stations, [[Heart Four Counties]]<ref>[http://www.heart.co.uk%20]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> covering Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Northamptonshire, and MKFM which broadcasts on DAB Digital Radio full-time and on twice-yearly 28 day FM trial broadcasts. [[BBC Three Counties Radio]] is the local [[BBC Radio]] station, covering Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, but has different programming from the [[Bow Brickhill]] transmitter at breakfast. CRMK Online<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crmk.co.uk |title=Radio for Milton Keynes |publisher=CRMK |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> is a voluntary station broadcasting on the Internet.

For television, the area is in the overlap between the [[Oxford]] and the [[Sandy, Bedfordshire|Sandy]] transmitters and so receives [[BBC]] South and BBC East, and ITV [[Central Television|Central]] and [[Anglia Television|Anglia]]. Signal quality is weak in many areas due to distance and "terrain shadow".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithia.com/elect/terrain.html |title=Terrain <U+2013> shows radio profile between two UK sites to optimise you DTT, Freeview, DAB or analogue TV reception |publisher=Megalithia.com |date=4 August 2005 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> It was for this reason among others that Milton Keynes had a dedicated [[Cable television|Cable TV]] network from the outset, although it is now ageing and in need of modernisation to cope with the imminent digital TV switchover; many residents have already opted for roof-top aerials and satellite dishes. All homes in the post-designation and/or post expansion areas of Milton Keynes are already on-net cable homes{{spaced ndash}}, although (as of 2013) only in [[analog television|analogue]]. Milton Keynes is notable for being the only remaining town in the UK to broadcast TV in [[Analogue television in the United Kingdom|analogue]] signals, due to a long dispute between the local cable company [[Virgin Media]] and [[BT]]. The [[digital switchover]] for the Sandy transmitter took place in two phases over March/April 2011.

Milton Keynes has two free-to-residents local newspapers, the [[Milton Keynes Citizen]], which is twice-weekly in some areas, and the [[MK News]], a weekly.

In the early days of land-line broadband, parts of Milton Keynes were so far from BT exchanges as to have a poor or no service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mkbag.org/fibre |title=Campaigning for better broadband in MK |publisher=MKBAG |date= |accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref> Recent work by BT to enhance its network (including [[FTTC]] and [[FTTP]]) should see the issue resolved for up to 50% of customers before end of 2013 <U+2013> but the Eastern & Western Expansion Areas, plus rural exchanges such as Woburn Sands are in the "final third of roll-outs", meaning upgrades there won't occur until around 2017, if at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkbroadband.com/news/4177-broadband-campaign-final-third-first-launched.html |title=Broadband Campaign "Final Third First" launched |publisher=thinkbroadband |date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> There is a frequently updated unofficial fibre rollout guide available from MK Broadband Action Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mkbag.org/fibre |title=Fibre Broadband Update |publisher=MKBAG |date= |accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>

A survey in spring 2011 reported that the performance of the broadband-over-3G mobile service provided to customers in Milton Keynes was the slowest of the towns/cities surveyed.<ref>[http://top10.com/company/press/uk_s_worst_3g_locations_milton_keynes_in_broadband_slow_lane/ ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref>  In 2006 Milton Keynes Council planned to roll out a high speed [[WiMax]] network; which would allow access to the internet from anywhere with signal coverage in Milton Keynes<ref name="wimax1">{{cite news |title=Milton Keynes to get blanket WiMax coverage |url=http://www.pocket-lint.co.uk/news.php?newsId=4384 WiMax in MK |accessdate=3 April 2007 |date=18 August 2006 |work=Pocket-lint.co.uk |first=Stuart |last=Miles}}</ref> through a scheme called ConnectMK,<ref>{{cite web|title=Milton Keynes WiMAX Network|url=http://www.sparkcentral.co.uk/showcase/show/milton-keynes-wimax-network|work=Spark Central|accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref>  and the central area additionally has a free [[WiFi]].<ref name="wimax2">{{cite news |title=Milton Keynes sets Wi-Fi free |url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2166772/free-wi-milton-keynes |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=3 April 2007 |work=vnunet.com |first=Will |last=Head}}</ref>

==Business==
In November 2012, the [[Milton Keynes Citizen]] reported ratings company [[Experian]] as describing Milton Keynes as one of the leaders in a prospective economic recovery.<ref name=citizen181012>[http://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/news/business/milton-keynes-is-leading-the-way-to-recovery-1-4596616 Milton Keynes is leading the way to recovery] {{ndash}} [[Milton Keynes Citizen]], 18 December 2012</ref> The same report quoted the Estate Gazette as placing it first outside the M25 for office property growth.<ref name=citizen181012 />

Milton Keynes is home to several national and international companies, including the UK headquarters of [[Home Retail Group|Argos]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Marshall Amplification]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Suzuki]], [[Volkswagen AG]] and [[Yamaha|Yamaha Kemble]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Selected Headquarters in Milton Keynes|url=http://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/investmk/documents/Headquarters_List.pdf|work=Invest MK|accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref>

==Sport==
{{main|Sport in Milton Keynes}}
[[File:StadiumMKEnglandU21.jpg|thumb|View towards the North Stand as of 9 June 2009 in an England U21 international at [[stadium mk]]]]
Milton Keynes has professional teams in [[Association Football|football]] ([[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.]] at [[Stadium:mk]]), in [[ice hockey]] ([[Milton Keynes Lightning]]), and in [[Formula One]] ([[Red Bull Racing]]). The town hosted professional basketball between 1998<U+2013>2012 until the [[Milton Keynes Lions]] of the [[British Basketball League]] were forced to re-locate after the closure of [[Prestige Homes Arena]]. 

Milton Keynes is also home to the [[Xscape (building)|Xscape]] indoor ski slope, the Airkix indoor [[sky diving]] facility, the Formula Fast Indoor [[Karting]] centre, and the National Badminton Centre.

The site presently occupied by Network Rail, at the southern end of centre:mk, was formerly the home of the [[National Hockey Stadium]].

==Centre==
{{Main|Central Milton Keynes|Milton Keynes Shopping Centre|Milton Keynes Central railway station}}
As a key element of the New Town vision, Milton Keynes has a purpose built centre, with a very large "covered high street" shopping centre, theatre, [[art gallery]], two multiplex cinemas, hotels, business district, ecumenical church, [[Borough of Milton Keynes|Borough Council offices]] and [[Milton Keynes Central railway station|central railway station]].

==Other amenities==
[[File:Gnarled Tree.jpg|thumb|Part of the Blue Lagoon]]
*Milton Keynes has a 125-mile (200-km) network of [[segregated cycle facilities|cycleways/footpaths]] for pedestrians and cyclists called [[Milton Keynes redway system|the Redway system]], generally surfaced with red tarmac, which criss-cross most of town. The national [[Sustrans]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sustrans.org |title=Join the movement |publisher=Sustrans |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> cycle network runs to and through the town. The [[Swan's Way (footpath)|Swan's Way]] [[Long-distance trail|long distance path]] does the same.
*Also near the station there is a covered "urban [[skateboard]]ing" arena known as the Buszy, but the wide expanses and slopes of the station plaza remain very popular among skaters.
*There is a high security prison, [[Woodhill (HM Prison)|HMP Woodhill]], on the western boundary of the town.
*[[Willen Lake|Willen Lakeside Park]] hosts [[watersports]], and the [[Willen Lake|North Lake]] is a [[bird sanctuary]].

Milton Keynes consists of many pre-existing towns and villages, as well as new infill developments. The designated area outside the four main towns (Bletchley, Newport Pagnell, Stony Stratford, Wolverton) was largely rural farmland but included many picturesque North Buckinghamshire villages and hamlets: [[Bradwell, Milton Keynes|Bradwell]] village and [[Bradwell Abbey|its Abbey]], [[Broughton, Milton Keynes|Broughton]], [[Caldecotte, Milton Keynes|Caldecotte]], [[Fenny Stratford]], [[Great Linford]], [[Loughton, Milton Keynes|Loughton]], [[Middleton, Milton Keynes|Milton Keynes Village]], [[New Bradwell]], [[Shenley Brook End]], [[Shenley Church End]], [[Simpson, Milton Keynes|Simpson]], [[Stantonbury]], [[Tattenhoe]], [[Tongwell]], [[Walton, Milton Keynes|Walton]], [[Water Eaton, Milton Keynes|Water Eaton]], [[Wavendon]], [[Willen]], [[Woolstone, Milton Keynes|Great and Little Woolstone]], [[Woughton on the Green]]. The historical settlements have been focal points for the modern development of the new town. Every grid square has historical antecedents, if only in the field names. The more obvious ones are listed below and most have more detailed articles.

[[Bletchley]] was first recorded in the 12th century as ''Blechelai''. [[Bletchley railway station|Its station]] was a major [[Victorian era|Victorian]] junction (the [[London and North Western Railway]] with the Oxford-Cambridge [[Varsity Line]]), leading to the substantial urban growth in the town in that period. It expanded to absorb the villages of [[Water Eaton (Milton Keynes)|Water Eaton]] and [[Fenny Stratford]].

[[Bletchley Park]] was home to the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] during the Second World War. The famous [[Enigma code]] was cracked here, and the building housed what was arguably the world's first programmable computer, [[History of computing hardware|Colossus]]. The house is now a museum of war memorabilia, cryptography and computing.

The [[Benedictine]] [[Priory]] of [[Bradwell Abbey]] at '''[[Bradwell (Milton Keynes)|Bradwell]]''' was of major economic importance in this area of north Buckinghamshire before the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. The routes of the medieval trackways (many of which are now Redways or bridleways) converge on the site from some distance. Nowadays there is only a small medieval chapel and a manor house occupying the site.

'''[[New Bradwell]]''', to the north of the medieval Bradwell (Abbey) and just across the canal and the railway to the east of Wolverton, was built specifically for railway workers. It has a working [[windmill]], although technically this lies just a few yards outside of the parish boundary. The level bed of the old [[Wolverton to Newport Pagnell Line]] ends here and has been converted to a Redway, making it a favourite route for cycling.

'''[[Great Linford]]''' appears in the [[Domesday Book]] as ''Linforde'', and features a church dedicated to [[Saint Andrew]], dating from 1215. Today, the outer buildings of the 17th century [[manor house]] form an [[Arts centre|Arts Centre]], and [[Linford Manor]] is a prestigious recording studio.

'''[[Middleton, Milton Keynes|Milton Keynes Village]]''' is the original village to which the New Town owes its name. The original village is still evident, with a pleasant [[thatch]]ed [[pub]], [[village hall]], church and traditional housing. The area around the village has reverted to its original name of '''[[Middleton (Milton Keynes Village)|Middleton]]''', as shown on old maps of the 1700s. The oldest<ref name="pastpresentfuture">{{cite web|author=Milton Keynes Council |url=http://www.mkweb.co.uk/statistics/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=11415 |title=Milton Keynes Council <U+2013> Statistics |publisher=Mkweb.co.uk |date=30 November 2004 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> surviving domestic building in the area, a 14th-century manor house, is here.

There has been a market in '''[[Stony Stratford]]''' since 1194 (by charter of [[Richard I of England|King Richard I]]). The ''Rose and Crown Inn'' at Stratford is reputedly the last place the [[Princes in the Tower]] were seen alive.

The manor house of '''[[Walton, Milton Keynes|Walton]]''' village, '''[[Walton Hall, Milton Keynes|Walton Hall]]''', is the headquarters of the [[Open University]] and the tiny [[parish church]] (deconsecrated) is in its grounds.

The tiny Parish Church (1680) at [[Willen]] contains the only unaltered building by the architect and physicist [[Robert Hooke]]. Nearby, there is a [[Buddhist]] Temple and a [[Peace Pagoda]]. The district borders the [[River Ouzel]]: there is a large [[balancing lake]] here, to capture [[flash flood]]s before they cause problems downstream on the [[River Great Ouse]]. The north basin is a wildlife sanctuary and a favourite of migrating aquatic birds. The south basin is for leisure use, favoured by wind surfers and dinghy sailors. The circuit of the lakes is a favoured "fun run". <!-- This is just a summary. Please add any new content to the main Willen article -->

The original [[Wolverton]] was a medieval settlement just north and west of today's town. The [[Ridge and Furrow]] pattern of agriculture can still be seen in the nearby fields and the Saxon (rebuilt in 1819) '''Church of the Holy Trinity''' still stands next to the Norman [[Motte and Bailey]] site. Modern Wolverton was a 19th-century New Town built to house the workers at the [[Wolverton railway works]] (which built engines and carriages for the [[London and North Western Railway]]).

==Economy, demographics, geography and politics==
{{Main|Borough of Milton Keynes}}
Data on the economy, demographics and politics of Milton Keynes are collected at the Borough level and are detailed at [[Borough of Milton Keynes#Economy|Economy of the Borough]] and [[Borough of Milton Keynes#Demographics|Demographics of the Borough]]. However, since the urban area is predominant in the Borough, it is reasonable to assume that, other than for agriculture, the figures are broadly the same. For the borough as a whole, the service sector (including energy and construction) is the largest, followed by manufacturing (which includes hunting and forestry).

Milton Keynes is one of the more successful (per capita) economies in the South East, with a [[gross value added]] per capita index that was 47% higher than the national average (2005 data).<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/RegionalGVA.pdf Regional Gross Value Added] pp&nbsp;240<U+2013>253 pub. Office for National Statistics</ref>  Service industries dominate the economy, making it susceptible to economic downturn.

The population is significantly younger than the national averages{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}. According to 2011 census, the ethnic group categories makeup of Milton Keynes Urban Area is: 78.4% [[White people|White]], 8.7% [[South Asian People|South Asian]], 7.5% [[Black People|Black]], 3.5% [[Mixed Race]], 1.2% [[Chinese British|Chinese]] and  0.7% [[Other ethnic group (United Kingdom Census)|other]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Neighbourhood Statistics |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadAreaSearch.do?a=7&i=1001&m=0&s=1361137535513&enc=1&areaSearchText=milton+keynes&areaSearchType=140&extendedList=false&searchAreas= |title=Milton Keynes  Urban Area Output Areas|publisher=Neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref>

[[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] [[vacuum tube|valve]] amplifiers and some [[Guitar speaker|speaker cabinets]] are hand-built in [[Bletchley, Milton Keynes]].

The [[Grand Union Canal]] between London and Birmingham provides a major axis in the design of Milton Keynes.

Milton Keynes is served by five [[railway stations]].  [[Milton Keynes Central]] is served by inter-city services. [[Wolverton railway station|Wolverton]], Milton Keynes Central and [[Bletchley railway station|Bletchley]] stations are on the [[West Coast Main Line]].

[[Woburn Sands railway station]], also on the Marston Vale line, is just outside the urban area in the small town of [[Woburn Sands]], but is still within the Borough.

The [[M1 motorway]] runs east of the town, and is served by junctions 13, 14, and 15A. The [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5 road]] is west of the town. Other main roads are the [[A509 road|A509]] linking Milton Keynes with Wellingborough and Kettering, and the [[A421 road|A421]] running west to [[Buckingham]] and east to [[Bedford]]. Proximity to the M1 has led to a [[distribution center]], ''[[Magna Park, Milton Keynes|Magna Park]]'' at the A421/A5130 junction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeley.com/Our_Site/Details/52| title = Magna Park, Milton Keynes| work = Gazeley.com| publisher = Gazeley Limited|accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref>
