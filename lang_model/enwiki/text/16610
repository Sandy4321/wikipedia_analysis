'''Edward VIII''' (Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David; later '''The Duke of Windsor'''; 23 June 1894 <U+2013> 28&nbsp;May 1972) was [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[British Dominions]], and [[Emperor of India]] from 20 January 1936 until his [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]] on 11 December 1936.

Before his accession to the throne, Edward held successively the titles of Prince Edward of York, Prince Edward of Cornwall and York, [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay|Rothesay]], and [[Prince of Wales]]. As a young man, he served in the First World War, undertook several foreign tours on behalf of his father, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], and was associated with a succession of older, married women.

Only months into his reign, Edward caused a [[constitutional crisis]] by proposing marriage to the American divorc<U+00E9>e [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]]. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing that the people would never accept her as queen. Edward knew that the government led by British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have dragged the King into a [[general election]] and ruined irreparably his status as a politically neutral [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]]. Rather than give up Mrs. Simpson, Edward [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|chose to abdicate]]. He was succeeded by his younger brother, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]]. With a reign of 325 days, Edward is one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] history, and was never [[Coronation of the British monarch|crowned]]. He was the third and final British monarch to serve his entire reign as the [[Emperor of India]].

After his abdication, he was created [[Duke of Windsor]], and in 1937 toured [[Nazi Germany]]. During the Second World War, he was at first stationed with the [[British Military Mission to France]], but after private accusations that he held [[Nazism|pro-Nazi]] sympathies, he was moved to [[the Bahamas]] as [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|Governor]]. After the war, he was never given another official appointment, and spent the remainder of his life in retirement.

==Early life==
Edward VIII was born on 23 June 1894, at [[White Lodge, Richmond Park|White Lodge]] in [[Municipal Borough of Richmond (Surrey)|Richmond]], England.<ref>Windsor, p. 1</ref> He was the eldest son of [[George V of the United Kingdom|The Duke of York]] (later King George V), and [[Mary of Teck|The Duchess of York]] (formerly Princess Victoria Mary of Teck). His father was the second son of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|The Prince of Wales]] (later King Edward VII) and [[Alexandra of Denmark|The Princess of Wales]] (formerly Princess Alexandra of Denmark). His mother was the eldest daughter of [[Prince Francis, Duke of Teck|The Duke of Teck]] and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|The Duchess of Teck]] (formerly Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge). As a great-grandson of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in the male line, Edward was styled ''His Highness Prince Edward of York'' at birth.

He was baptised Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David in the Green Drawing Room of White Lodge on 16 July 1894, by [[Edward White Benson]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref>His twelve godparents were [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]], the [[Christian IX of Denmark|King]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen of Denmark]] ([[Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge|Prince Adolphus of Teck]] and [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Fife|The Duchess of Fife]] stood proxy), the [[William II of W<U+00FC>rttemberg|King of W<U+00FC>rttemberg]] ([[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|The Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] stood proxy), the [[Olga Konstantinovna of Russia|Queen of Greece]] ([[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria of Wales]] stood proxy), the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsarevich of Russia]], the [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] ([[Prince Louis of Battenberg]] stood proxy), the [[Prince Francis, Duke of Teck|Duke]] and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|Duchess of Teck]] and the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]].</ref> The names were chosen in honour of [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Edward's late uncle]], who was known to his family as "Eddy" or Edward, and his great-grandfather King [[Christian IX of Denmark]]. The name Albert was included at the behest of Queen Victoria, and his last four names<U+2014>[[Saint George|George]], [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]], [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]] and [[Saint David|David]]<U+2014>came from the [[Patron Saint]]s of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. He was always known to his family and close friends by his last given name, David.

Edward's parents, The Duke and Duchess of York, were often removed from their children's upbringing, like other upper-class English parents of the day. Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies. One of his early nannies abused Edward by pinching him before he was due to be presented to his parents. His subsequent crying and wailing would lead the Duke and Duchess to send Edward and the nanny away.<ref>Windsor, p. 7</ref> The nanny was subsequently discharged.

[[File:Edward VIII boy.jpg|left|thumb|upright|200px|''Little David'', photographed by his grandmother Queen Alexandra]]

Edward's father, though a harsh disciplinarian,<ref>Windsor, pp. 25<U+2013>28</ref> was demonstrably affectionate,<ref>Ziegler, pp. 30<U+2013>31</ref> and his mother displayed a frolicksome side with her children that belies her austere public image. She was amused by the children making tadpoles on toast for their French master,<ref>Windsor, pp. 38<U+2013>39</ref> and encouraged them to confide in her.<ref>Ziegler, p. 79</ref>

==Education==
At first, Edward was tutored at home by Helen Bricka. Following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, his parents travelled the British Empire for almost nine months. Young Edward and his siblings stayed in Britain with their grandparents, Queen Alexandra and King Edward VII, who showered their grandchildren with affection. On the return of his parents, Edward was placed under the care of two men, Frederick Finch and Henry Hansell, who virtually brought up Edward and his siblings for their remaining nursery years.<ref>Parker, pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref>

Edward was kept under the strict tutorship of Hansell until nearly 13; Hansell had wanted Edward to enter school earlier, but his father disagreed. Edward took the examination to enter [[Osborne Naval College]], and began there in 1907.<ref>Parker, pp. 13<U+2013>14</ref> Following two years at Osborne College, which he did not enjoy, Edward moved on to the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College]] at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]]. A course of two years followed by entry into the [[Royal Navy]] was planned. However, Edward automatically became [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]] when his father, George V, ascended the throne on 6 May 1910 following the death of Edward VII. Edward was created [[Prince of Wales]] a month later on his 16th birthday, on 23 June 1910, and the preparations began in earnest for his future duties as King. He was withdrawn from his naval course before his formal graduation, served as [[midshipman]] for three months aboard the battleship [[HMS Hindustan|''Hindustan'']], then immediately entered [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], for which in the opinion of his biographers, he was underprepared intellectually. He left Oxford after eight terms without any academic credentials.<ref>Parker, pp. 14<U+2013>16</ref>

==Prince of Wales==
[[File:Edward Albert Prince of Wales Investiture Medallion 1911.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Medallion celebrating the investiture of Edward as Prince of Wales, 1911]]
[[File:Edward V111 circa1915.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Edward during the First World War]]

Edward was officially invested as Prince of Wales in a special ceremony at [[Caernarfon Castle]] on 13 July 1911.<ref>{{citation|last=Weir|first=Alison|authorlink=Alison Weir (historian)|title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy Revised edition|year=1996|publisher=Pimlico|location=London|page=327|isbn=0712674489}}</ref> For the first time since 1616<U+2014>and the evidence for that ceremony is thin<U+2014>the investiture took place in Wales, at the instigation of the Welsh politician [[David Lloyd George]], Constable of the Castle and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government.<ref name="duke">Windsor, p. 78</ref> Lloyd George invented a rather fanciful ceremony in the style of a Welsh pageant, and coached Edward to speak a few words in Welsh.

When the First World War (1914<U+2013>18) broke out, Edward had reached the minimum age for active service and was keen to participate.<ref>Windsor, pp. 106<U+2013>107 and Ziegler, pp. 48<U+2013>50</ref> He had joined the [[Grenadier Guards]] in June 1914, and although Edward was willing to serve on the front lines, [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if the heir to the throne was captured.<ref>Roberts, p. 41 and Windsor, p. 109</ref>

Despite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare firsthand and attempted to visit the front line as often as he could, for which he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, made him popular among veterans of the conflict.<ref>Ziegler, p. 111 and Windsor, p. 140</ref> Edward undertook his first military flight in 1918 and later gained his pilot's licence.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/TheHouseofWindsor/EdwardVIII.aspx|title=Edward VIII (Jan<U+2013>Dec 1936)|publisher=Official website of the British monarchy|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>

Throughout the 1920s Edward, as Prince of Wales, represented his father, King George V, at home and abroad on many occasions. He took a particular interest in visiting the poverty stricken areas of the country,<ref>Windsor, p. 215</ref> and undertook 16 tours to various parts of the [[British Empire|Empire]] between 1919 and 1935, in the process acquiring the Bedingfield ranch, near [[Pekisko, Alberta|Pekisko]], Canada. In 1924, he donated the [[Prince of Wales Trophy]] to the [[National Hockey League]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/wales.html|title=Prince of Wales Trophy|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>

His attitudes towards many of the Empire's subjects and various foreign peoples, both during his time as Prince of Wales and later as Duke of Windsor, were little commented upon in their time but have soured his reputation subsequently.<ref name="ziegler">Ziegler, p. 448</ref> He said of [[Indigenous Australians]]: "they are the most revolting form of living creatures I've ever seen!! They are the lowest known form of human beings & are the nearest thing to monkeys."<ref>{{citation|last=Godfrey|first=Rupert (editor)|year=1998|title=Letters From a Prince: Edward to Mrs. Freda Dudley Ward 1918<U+2013>1921|chapter=11 July 1920|publisher=Little, Brown & Co|isbn=0751525901}}</ref>

His rank, travels, good looks, and unmarried status gained him much attention; he soon became the 1920s version of a latter-day movie star. At the height of his popularity, he became the most photographed celebrity of his time and he set men's fashion.<ref>{{citation |last=Broad |first=Lewis |title=The Abdication: Twenty-five Years After. A Re-appraisal |year=1961 |publisher=Frederick Muller Ltd |location=London |pages=4<U+2013>5}}</ref>

==Romances==
Edward's compulsive womanising and other instances of reckless behaviour during the 1920s and 1930s worried Prime Minister Baldwin, King George V, and those close to the prince. Edward's private secretary for eight years during this period, [[Alan Lascelles]], believed that "for some hereditary or physiological reason his normal mental development stopped dead when he reached adolescence".<ref>{{citation|authorlink=Alan Lascelles|author=Lascelles, Sir Alan 'Tommy'|title=Prince Charmless: A damning portrait of Edward VIII|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-417388/Prince-Charmless-A-damning-portrait-Edward-VIII.html| journal=Daily Mail|date=20 November 2006|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> George V was disappointed by Edward's failure to settle down in life and disgusted by his many affairs with married women. The King was reluctant to see Edward inherit the Crown, and was quoted as saying of Edward: "After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself in 12 months."<ref>{{citation|last=Middlemas|first=Keith|coauthors=Barnes, John|title=Baldwin: A Biography|year=1969|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|isbn=0297178598|page=976}}</ref>

In 1929, ''Time'' magazine reported that Edward teased his new sister-in-law, [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Elizabeth]], the wife of his younger brother [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Albert]], by calling her "Queen Elizabeth". The magazine asked if "she did not sometimes wonder how much truth there is in the story that he once said he would renounce his rights upon the death of George V<U+2014>which would make her nickname come true".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,769224,00.html|title=Foreign News: P'incess Is Three|publisher=Time|date=29 April 1929|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> Edward grew older and remained unmarried, but his brother and sister-in-law had two children, including [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth]]. King George V said of his son Albert ("Bertie"), and granddaughter Elizabeth ("Lilibet"): "I pray to God that my eldest son [Edward] will never marry and have children, and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne."<ref>{{citation|last=Airlie|first=Mabell|authorlink=Mabell Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie|title=Thatched with Gold|year=1962|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London|page=197}}</ref>

In 1930, the King gave Edward a home, [[Fort Belvedere, Berkshire|Fort Belvedere]], near [[Sunningdale]], England.<ref>Windsor, p. 235</ref> There, Edward had relationships with a series of married women including half-British, half-American textile heiress [[Freda Dudley Ward]], and [[Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness|Lady Furness]], an American of part-[[Chile]]an ancestry, who introduced the Prince to fellow American [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]]. Mrs. Simpson had divorced her first husband in 1927 and had subsequently married [[Ernest Simpson]], a half-British, half-American businessman. Mrs. Simpson and the Prince of Wales, it is generally accepted, became lovers while Lady Furness travelled abroad, though Edward adamantly insisted to his father, the King, that he was not intimate with her and that it was not appropriate to describe her as his mistress.<ref>Ziegler, p. 233</ref> Edward's relationship with Mrs. Simpson further weakened his poor relationship with his father. Although the King and Queen met Mrs. Simpson at Buckingham Palace in 1935,<ref>Windsor, p. 255</ref> they later refused to receive her.<ref>Bradford, p. 142</ref> But Edward had now fallen in love with Wallis and the couple grew ever closer.

Edward's affair with the American divorc<U+00E9>e led to such grave concern that the couple were followed by members of the Metropolitan Police [[Special Branch]], who examined in secret the nature of their relationship. An undated report detailed a visit by the couple to an antique shop, where the proprietor later noted: "that the lady seemed to have POW [Prince of Wales] completely under her thumb."<ref>{{citation|last=Boycott|first=Owen|coauthors=Bates, Stephen|title=Car dealer was Wallis Simpson's secret lover|periodical=The Guardian|date=30 January 2003|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,885144,00.html|accessdate=1 May 2010|location=London}}</ref> The prospect of having an American divorc<U+00E9>e with a questionable past having such sway over the [[heir apparent]] led to anxiety amongst government and establishment figures.

==Reign==
[[File:EVIIIR.PNG|thumb|left|upright|[[Royal Cypher]] of Edward VIII]]

King George V died on 20 January 1936, and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. The next day, he broke royal protocol by watching the proclamation of his own accession to the throne from a window in the company of the then still-married Mrs. Simpson.<ref>Windsor, p. 265</ref> Edward VIII became the first monarch of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s to fly in an [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aeroplane]], when he flew from [[Sandringham, Norfolk|Sandringham]] to London for his [[Accession Council]].<ref name="matthew">[[Colin Matthew|Matthew, H. C. G.]] (September 2004; online edition January 2008) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31061 "Edward VIII, later Prince Edward, duke of Windsor (1894<U+2013>1972)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, [[doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/31061]], retrieved 1 May 2010 (Subscription required)</ref>

Edward caused unease in government circles with actions that were interpreted as interference in political matters. On visiting the depressed coal mining villages in [[South Wales]] the King's observation that "something must be done"<ref name="matthew" /> for the unemployed coal miners was seen as directly critical of the Government, though it has never been clear whether Edward had anything in particular in mind. Government ministers were reluctant to send confidential documents and state papers to Fort Belvedere because it was clear that Edward was paying little attention to them and because of the perceived danger that Mrs. Simpson and other house guests might see them.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 273<U+2013>274</ref>

Edward's unorthodox approach to his role also extended to the currency which bore his image. He broke with the tradition that on coinage each successive monarch faced in the opposite direction to his or her predecessor. Edward insisted that he face left (as his father had done),<ref>Windsor, pp. 293<U+2013>294</ref> to show the parting in his hair.<ref>A.Michie, God Save The Queen, p.___</ref> Only a handful of coins were actually struck before the abdication, and when George VI succeeded he also faced left, to maintain the tradition by suggesting that had any coins been minted featuring Edward's portrait, they would have shown him facing right.<ref>{{citation|url= http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coinageandbanknotes.aspx|title=Coinage and bank notes|publisher=Official website of the British monarchy|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>

[[File:EdwardVIIIcoin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Left-facing currency portrait of Edward VIII]]

On 16 July 1936 an attempt was made to assassinate Edward. An Irish malcontent, Jerome Brannigan (otherwise known as George Andrew McMahon), produced a loaded revolver as the King rode on horseback at [[Constitution Hill, London|Constitution Hill]], near [[Buckingham Palace]]. Police spotted the gun and pounced on him; he was quickly arrested. At Brannigan's trial, he alleged that "a foreign power" had approached him to kill Edward, that he had informed [[MI5]] of the plan, and that he was merely seeing the plan through to help MI5 catch the real culprits. The court rejected the claims and sent him to jail for a year. It is now thought that Brannigan had indeed been in contact with MI5 but the veracity of the remainder of his claims remains open.<ref>{{citation|last=Cook|first=Andrew|title=The plot thickens|periodical=The Guardian|date=3 January 2003|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,867861,00.html|accessdate=1 May 2010|location=London}}</ref>

In August and September, Edward and Mrs. Simpson cruised the Eastern Mediterranean on the steam yacht ''Nahlin''. By October it was becoming clear that the new King planned to marry Mrs. Simpson, especially when divorce proceedings between Mr. and Mrs. Simpson were brought at [[Ipswich]] Crown Court.<ref>Broad, pp. 56<U+2013>57</ref> Preparations for all contingencies were made, including the prospect of the coronation of King Edward and Queen Wallis. Because of the religious implications of any marriage, plans were made to hold a secular coronation ceremony not in the traditional religious location, [[Westminster Abbey]], but in the [[Banqueting House]] in Whitehall.<ref>Antiques Roadshow, BBC One, 14 October 2007. Banqueting House staff discovered plans for the coronation, including a hand-drawn scheme for the decoration of the hall.</ref>

==Abdication==
{{Main|Edward VIII abdication crisis}}
On 16 November 1936, Edward invited [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] to [[Buckingham Palace]] and expressed his desire to marry [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] when she became free to re-marry. Baldwin informed the King that his subjects would deem the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the [[Church of England]], and the people would not tolerate Wallis as Queen.<ref>Windsor, pp. 330<U+2013>331</ref> As King, Edward held the role of [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], and the clergy expected him to support the Church's
teachings.

[[File:King Edward VIII and Mustafa Kemal.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Edward with [[Mustafa Kemal]] in [[Turkey]], 4 September 1936]]

Edward proposed an alternative solution of a [[morganatic marriage]], in which he would remain King but Wallis would not become Queen. She would enjoy some lesser title instead, and any children they might have would not inherit the throne. This too was rejected by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]]<ref>Windsor, p. 346</ref> as well as other [[British Dominions|Dominion]] governments,<ref>Windsor, p. 354</ref> whose views were sought pursuant to the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which provided in part that "any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]."<ref>{{citation|title=Statute of Westminster 1931 c.4|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1081723|publisher=The UK Statute Law Database|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> The Prime Ministers of [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] made clear their opposition to the King marrying a divorc<U+00E9>e;<ref>Ziegler, pp. 305<U+2013>307</ref> the [[Irish Free State|Irish]] premier expressed indifference and detachment, while the Prime Minister of [[New Zealand]], having never even heard of Mrs. Simpson before, vacillated in disbelief.<ref>Bradford, p. 187</ref> Faced with this opposition, Edward at first responded that there were "not many people in Australia" and their opinion did not matter.<ref>Bradford, p. 188</ref>

The King informed Baldwin that he would abdicate if he could not marry Mrs. Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate.<ref>Windsor, pp. 354<U+2013>355</ref> It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Mrs. Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis.<ref>{{citation|last=Beaverbrook|first=Lord|authorlink=Max Aitken, Baron Beaverbook|title=The Abdication of King Edward VIII|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|location=London|coauthor=Edited by [[A. J. P. Taylor]]|year=1966|page=57}}</ref> He chose to abdicate.<ref>Windsor, p. 387</ref>

Edward duly signed the instruments<ref>There were fifteen separate copies <U+2013> one for each Dominion, the Irish Free State, India, the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the Prime Minister, amongst others.</ref> of abdication at Fort Belvedere on 10 December 1936, in the presence of his three surviving brothers, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|The Duke of York]], [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|The Duke of Gloucester]] and [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|The Duke of Kent]] (the youngest brother, Prince John, had died in 1919).<ref>Windsor, p. 407</ref> The next day, the last act of his reign was the [[royal assent]] to [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]]. As required by the Statute of Westminster, all the Dominions consented to the King's abdication,<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/324/Independence.html|accessdate=1 May 2010|last=Heard|first=Andrew|title=Canadian Independence|year=1990|publisher=Simon Fraser University, Canada}}</ref> though the Irish Free State did not pass the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]], which included the abdication in its schedule, until 12 December.

On the night of 11 December 1936, Edward, now reverted to the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] of prince, made a broadcast to the nation and the Empire, explaining his decision to abdicate. He famously said, "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love."<ref>{{citation|author=Edward VIII|title=Broadcast after his abdication, 11 December 1936|publisher=Official website of the British monarchy|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/pdf/edwardviii.pdf |accessdate=1 May 2010|format=PDF}}</ref>

After the broadcast, Edward departed the United Kingdom for Austria, though he was unable to join Mrs. Simpson until her divorce became absolute, several months later.<ref>Ziegler, p. 336</ref> His brother, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Prince Albert, Duke of York]], succeeded to the throne as George VI. George's elder daughter, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth]], became first in the line of succession, as [[heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]].

==Duke of Windsor==
[[File:Wallis and Edward.jpg|thumb|The Windsors on their wedding day]]
On 12 December 1936, at his Accession [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], George VI announced he was to make his brother Duke of Windsor, and also re-admit him to the highest degrees of the various [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|British Orders of Knighthood]]. He wanted this to be the first act of his reign, although the formal documents were not signed until 8 March of the following year. During the interim, Edward was universally known as the Duke of Windsor. The King's decision to create Edward a [[Dukes in the United Kingdom|royal duke]] ensured that he could neither stand for election to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] nor speak on political subjects in the [[House of Lords]].<ref>[[Clive Wigram, 1st Baron Wigram|Clive Wigram]]'s conversation with Sir [[Claud Schuster]], Clerk to the Crown and Permanent Secretary to the [[Lord Chancellor]] quoted in Bradford, p. 201</ref>

However, [[letters patent]] dated 27 May 1937, which re-conferred upon the Duke of Windsor the "title, style, or attribute of Royal Highness", specifically stated that "his wife and descendants, if any, shall not hold said title or attribute". Some British ministers advised that Edward had no need of it being conferred because he had not lost it, and further that Mrs. Simpson would automatically obtain the rank of wife of a prince with the style ''Her Royal Highness''; others maintained that he had lost all royal rank and should no longer carry any royal title or style as an abdicated King. On 14 April 1937, [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] Sir [[Donald Somervell, Baron Somervell of Harrow|Donald Somervell]] submitted to [[Home Secretary]] Sir [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]] a memorandum summarising the views of [[Lord Advocate]] [[Thomas Cooper, 1st Baron Cooper of Culross|T. M. Cooper]], Parliamentary Counsel Sir Granville Ram, and himself:
<blockquote>
# We incline to the view that on his abdication the Duke of Windsor could not have claimed the right to be described as a Royal Highness. In other words, no reasonable objection could have been taken if the King had decided that his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.
# The question however has to be considered on the basis of the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.
# We came to the conclusion that the wife could not claim this right on any legal basis. The right to use this style or title, in our view, is within the prerogative of His Majesty and he has the power to regulate it by Letters Patent generally or in particular circumstances.<ref>Attorney General to Home Secretary (14 April 1937) National Archives file HO 144/22945 quoted in Velde, Fran<U+00E7>ois (6 February 2006) [http://heraldica.org/topics/britain/drafting_lp1937.htm#documents_ The drafting of the letters patent of 1937].

The Duke of Windsor married Mrs. Simpson, who had changed her name by [[deed poll]] to Wallis Warfield, in a private ceremony on 3 June 1937, at [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Cand<U+00E9>]], near [[Tours]], France. When the [[Church of England]] refused to sanction the union, a [[County Durham]] clergyman, the Reverend Robert Anderson Jardine (Vicar of St Paul's, [[Darlington]]), offered to perform the ceremony, and the Duke accepted. The new king, George VI, forbade members of the Royal Family to attend<ref>{{citation|last=Williams|first=Susan|title=The historical significance of the Abdication files|work=Public Records Office <U+2013> New Document Releases <U+2013> Abdication Papers, London|publisher=Public Records Office of the United Kingdom|year=2003|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2003/january30/significance.htm|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref><U+2014>Edward had particularly wanted his brothers the Dukes of [[Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]] and [[George, Duke of Kent|Kent]] and his second cousin [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] to be there<U+2014>and this continued for many years to rankle with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 354<U+2013>355</ref>

The denial of the style ''Her Royal Highness'' to the Duchess of Windsor caused conflict, as did the financial settlement<U+2014>the Government declined to include the Duke or the Duchess on the [[Civil List]], and the Duke's allowance was paid personally by the King. But the Duke had compromised his position with the King by concealing the extent of his financial worth when they informally agreed on the amount of the sinecure the King would pay. Edward's wealth had accumulated from the revenues of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] paid to him as [[Prince of Wales]] and ordinarily at the disposal of an incoming king. The new King and Queen also paid Edward for [[Sandringham House]] and [[Balmoral Castle]]. These properties were Edward's personal property, inherited from his father, King George V, and thus did not automatically pass to George VI on his accession.<ref name="settlement">Ziegler, pp. 376<U+2013>378</ref> Relations between the Duke of Windsor and the rest of the Royal Family were strained for decades. Edward became embittered against his mother, writing to her in 1939: "[your last letter]<ref>She had asked [[Alexander Hardinge, 2nd Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Alec Hardinge]] to write to the Duke explaining that he could not be invited to his father's memorial.</ref> destroy[ed] the last vestige of feeling I had left for you&nbsp;<U+2026> [and has] made further normal correspondence between us impossible."<ref>Ziegler, p. 384</ref> In the early days of George VI's reign the Duke telephoned daily, importuning for money and urging that the Duchess be granted the style of Royal Highness, until the harassed King ordered that the calls not be put through.<ref>Ziegler, p. 349</ref>

The Duke had assumed that he would settle in Britain after a year or two of exile in France. However, King George VI (with the support of their mother Queen Mary and his wife [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]]) threatened to cut off Edward's allowance if he returned to Britain without an invitation.<ref name="settlement" />

==Second World War==
[[File:Nazi Windsors.jpg|thumb|275px|The Duke and Duchess of Windsor meet [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1937]]

In October 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited [[Nazi Germany]], against the advice of the British government, and met [[Adolf Hitler]] at his [[Obersalzberg]] retreat. The visit was much publicised by the German media. During the visit the Duke gave full [[Hitler Salute|Nazi salutes]].<ref>Donaldson, pp. 331<U+2013>332</ref> The former Austrian ambassador, [[Count Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein]], who was also a second cousin once removed and friend of George V, believed that Edward favoured German [[fascism]] as a bulwark against [[communism]], and even that he initially favoured an alliance with Germany.<ref>Papers of [[Count Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein]] (1861<U+2013>1945) in the State Archives, Vienna, quoted in {{citation|authorlink=Kenneth Rose|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|year=1983|title=King George V|location=London|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|page=391|isbn=0297782452}}</ref> Edward's experience of "the unending scenes of horror"<ref>Windsor, p. 122</ref> during the First World War led him to support [[appeasement]]. Hitler considered Edward to be friendly towards Nazi Germany and thought that Anglo-German relations could have been improved through Edward if it were not for the abdication. Fellow Nazi [[Albert Speer]] quoted Hitler directly: "I am certain through him permanent friendly relations could have been achieved. If he had stayed, everything would have been different. His abdication was a severe loss for us."<ref>{{citation|last=Speer|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Speer|title=Inside the Third Reich|year=1970|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|page=118}}</ref>

The Duke and Duchess settled in France. On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, they were brought back to Britain by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] on board [[HMS Kelly|HMS ''Kelly'']], and the Duke, although an honorary Field Marshal, was gazetted a [[Major-General]] attached to the British Military Mission in France. In February 1940, the German Minister in [[The Hague]], [[:de:Julius Graf von Zech-Burkersroda|Count Julius von Zech-Burkersroda]], claimed that the Duke had leaked the Allied war plans for the defence of Belgium.<ref>Bradford, p. 434</ref> When Germany [[Battle of France|invaded]] the north of France in May 1940, the Windsors fled south, first to [[Biarritz]], then in June to Spain. In July the pair moved to [[Lisbon]], Portugal, where they lived at first in the home of [[Banco Esp<U+00ED>rito Santo|Ricardo de Esp<U+00ED>rito Santo]], a Portuguese banker with both British and German contacts.<ref>Bloch, p. 91</ref> During the occupation of France, the Duke asked the German forces to place guards at his Paris and Riviera homes: they did so.<ref>Roberts, p. 52</ref> A "defeatist" interview with the Duke that was widely distributed may have served as the last straw for the British government: Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] threatened the Duke with a court-martial if he did not return to British soil.<ref>Bloch, p. 93</ref> In August, a British warship dispatched the pair to [[the Bahamas]], where, in the view of Churchill, the Duke could do the least damage to the British war effort.

The Duke of Windsor was installed as [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|Governor]]. He did not enjoy the position, and referred to the islands as "a third-class British colony".<ref>Bloch, p. 364</ref> The British Foreign Office strenuously objected when the pair planned to tour aboard a yacht belonging to a Swedish magnate, [[Axel Wenner-Gren]], whom American intelligence wrongly believed to be a close friend of [[Luftwaffe]] commander [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]].<ref>Bloch, pp. 154<U+2013>159, 230<U+2013>233</ref> However, the Duke was praised for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands, although he was as contemptuous of the Bahamians as he was of most non-white peoples of the Empire. He said of [[<U+00C9>tienne Dupuch]], the editor of the ''Nassau Daily Tribune'': "It must be remembered that Dupuch is more than half Negro, and due to the peculiar mentality of this Race, they seem unable to rise to prominence without losing their equilibrium."<ref name="ziegler" /> He was praised, even by Dupuch, for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in 1942, even though he blamed the trouble on communist agitators and draft-dodging Jews.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 471<U+2013>472</ref> He held the post until 28 July 1945.

[[File:The Duke of Windsor (1945).jpg|thumb|left|175px|The Duke in 1945]]

Many historians have suggested that Hitler was prepared to reinstate Edward as King in the hope of establishing a fascist Britain.<ref>Ziegler, p. 392</ref> It is widely believed that the Duke and Duchess sympathised with fascism before and during the Second World War, and were moved to the Bahamas to minimise their opportunities to act on those feelings. In 1940 he said: "In the past 10 years Germany has totally reorganized the order of its society&nbsp;... Countries which were unwilling to accept such a reorganization of society and its concomitant sacrifices should direct their policies accordingly."<ref>Bloch, pp. 79<U+2013>80</ref> [[Thomas Inskip, 1st Viscount Caldecote|Lord Caldecote]] wrote to Winston Churchill just before the couple were sent to the Bahamas, "[the Duke] is well-known to be pro-Nazi and he may become a centre of intrigue."<ref>Ziegler, p. 434</ref> The latter, but not the former, part of this assessment is corroborated by [[Operation Willi|German operations designed to use the Duke]]. The Allies became sufficiently disturbed by the German plots that U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered covert surveillance of the Duke and Duchess when they visited [[Palm Beach, Florida]], in April 1941. [[Duke Carl Alexander of W<U+00FC>rttemberg]] (then a monk in an American monastery) had convinced the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] that the Duchess had been sleeping with the German ambassador in London, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], had remained in constant contact with him, and had continued to leak secrets.<ref>{{citation|last=Evans|first=Rob|coauthors=Hencke, David|title=Wallis Simpson, the Nazi minister, the telltale monk and an FBI plot|periodical=The Guardian|date=29 June 2002|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4451107,00.html|accessdate=2 May 2010|location=London}}</ref>

Some authors have claimed that [[Anthony Blunt]], an [[MI5]] agent, acting on orders from the [[British Royal Family]], made a successful secret trip to [[Schlosshotel Kronberg|Schloss Friedrichshof]] in Germany towards the end of the war in order to retrieve sensitive letters between the Duke of Windsor and Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazis.<ref>[[Charles Higham (biographer)|Higham, Charles]] (1988), ''The Duchess of Windsor: The Secret Life'', New York: McGraw-Hill Publishers, pp. 388<U+2013>389; and [[Peter Wright|Wright, Peter]] (1987), ''Spycatcher: The Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer'', Toronto: Stoddart Publishers</ref> What is certain is that George VI sent the [[Royal Librarian]], [[Owen Morshead]], accompanied by Blunt, then working part-time in the Royal library as well as for British intelligence, to Friedrichshof in March 1945 to secure papers relating to the [[Victoria, Princess Royal|German Empress Victoria]], a daughter of Queen Victoria. Part of the castle's archive, including surviving letters between daughter and mother, as well as other valuables were stolen by looters, some of which were only later recovered in Chicago after the war. The papers rescued by Morshead and Blunt, and those returned by the American authorities from Chicago, were deposited in the [[Royal Archives]].<ref>Bradford, p. 426</ref>

After the war, the Duke admitted in his memoirs that he admired the Germans, but he denied being pro-Nazi. Of Hitler he wrote: "[the] F<U+00FC>hrer struck me as a somewhat ridiculous figure, with his theatrical posturings and his bombastic pretensions."<ref>Windsor, p. 277</ref>

==Later life==
The couple returned to France and spent the remainder of their lives essentially in retirement as the Duke never occupied another official role after his wartime governorship of the Bahamas. The Duke's allowance was supplemented by government favours and illegal currency trading.<ref name="matthew"/><ref name="p53"/><ref>Bradford, p. 442</ref> The City of Paris provided the Duke with a house at 4 rue du Champ d'Entra<U+00EE>nement, on the [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] side of the [[Bois de Boulogne]], for a nominal rent.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 534<U+2013>535</ref> The French government exempted him from paying income tax,<ref name="p53">Roberts, p. 53</ref><ref name=tax>Bradford, p. 446</ref> and the couple were able to buy goods duty-free through the British embassy and the military commissary.<ref name=tax/> In 1951, the Duke produced a ghost-written memoir, ''A King's Story'', in which he expresses disagreement with liberal politics.<ref name="duke" /> The royalties from the book added to their income.<ref name="p53"/> Nine years later, he penned a relatively unknown book, ''A Family Album'', chiefly about the fashion and habits of the Royal Family throughout his life, from the time of [[Queen Victoria]] through his grandfather and father, and his own tastes.

[[File:Nixon and the Windsors.jpg|thumb|250px|U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1970]]

The Duke and Duchess effectively took on the role of minor celebrities and were regarded as part of [[caf<U+00E9> society]] in the 1950s and 1960s. They hosted parties and shuttled between Paris and New York; many of those who met the Windsors socially, including [[Gore Vidal]], reported on the vacuity of the Duke's conversation.<ref>{{citation|last=Vidal|first=Gore|authorlink=Gore Vidal|title=Palimpsest: a memoir|year=1995|isbn=0679440380|page=206|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}</ref> The couple doted on the [[pug]] dogs they kept.<ref>Farquhar, Michael (2001), ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', New York: Penguin Books, p. 48, ISBN 0739420259</ref>

In June 1953, instead of attending the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of Queen Elizabeth II in London, the Duke and Duchess watched the ceremony on television in Paris. The Duke said that it was contrary to precedent for a Sovereign or former Sovereign to attend any coronation of another. The Duke was paid to write articles on the ceremony for the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' and ''Women's Home Companion'', as well as a short book, ''The Crown and the People, 1902<U+2013>1953''.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 539<U+2013>540</ref>

In 1955, they visited President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] at the [[White House]]. The couple appeared on [[Edward R. Murrow]]'s television interview show ''Person to Person'' in 1956,<ref>{{citation |periodical=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,824447,00.html|date=8 October 1956|title=Peep Show|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> and a 50-minute BBC television interview in 1970. That year, they were invited as guests of honour to a dinner at the [[White House]] by President [[Richard Nixon]] in repayment for their having entertained Nixon in Paris during the mid-1960s when his political fortunes were low.

The Royal Family never fully accepted the Duchess; Queen Mary refused to receive her formally. However, the Duke sometimes met with his mother and brother, King George VI, and attended George's funeral. Queen Mary maintained her anger with Edward and her indignation over his marriage to Wallis: "To give up all this for that", she said.<ref>Bradford, p. 198</ref> In 1965, the Duke and Duchess returned to London. They were visited by the Queen, [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]], and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood]]. A week later, the Princess Royal died, and they attended her memorial service. In 1967, they joined the Royal Family for the [[centenary]] of Queen Mary's birth. The last royal ceremony the Duke attended was the funeral of Princess Marina in 1968.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 554<U+2013>556</ref> He declined an invitation from the Queen to attend the [[Investiture of the Prince of Wales]] in 1969, replying that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] would not want his "aged great-uncle" there.<ref>Ziegler, p. 555</ref>

In the 1960s, the Duke's health deteriorated. In December 1964, he was operated on by [[Michael DeBakey]] in [[Houston]] for an [[aneurysm]] of the [[abdominal aorta]], and in February 1965 a [[Retinal detachment|detached retina]] in his left eye was treated by Sir [[Stewart Duke-Elder]]. In late 1971, the Duke, who was a smoker from an early age, was diagnosed with [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] and underwent [[cobalt therapy]]. Queen Elizabeth II visited the Windsors in 1972 while on a state visit to France; however, only the Duchess appeared with the royal party for a photocall.

On 28 May 1972, the Duke died at his home in Paris, at the age of 77. His body was returned to Britain, lying in state at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]]. The funeral service was held in the chapel on 5 June in the presence of the Queen, the Royal Family, and the Duchess of Windsor, and the coffin was buried in the [[Royal Burial Ground]] behind the Royal Mausoleum of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at [[Frogmore]]. The Duchess stayed at Buckingham Palace during her visit.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 556<U+2013>557</ref> Until a 1965 agreement with Queen Elizabeth II, the Duke and Duchess had previously planned for a burial in a purchased cemetery plot at [[Green Mount Cemetery]] in [[Baltimore]], where the father of the Duchess was interred.<ref>{{citation|title=Windsors had a plot at Green Mount|last=Rasmussen|first=Frederick|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|location=Baltimore|date=29 April 1986}}</ref>

Frail, and suffering increasingly from [[senile]] [[dementia]], the Duchess died 14 years later, and was buried alongside her husband simply as "Wallis, Duchess of Windsor".<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/29/newsid_2500000/2500427.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Simple funeral rites for Duchess | date=29 April 1986|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>

As Prince of Wales, Edward's arms were the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]], differenced with a blank three-point label, with an inescutcheon of the Royal arms of Wales, surmounted by a coronet (identical to those of the current [[Prince of Wales]], [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]). As Sovereign, he bore the arms undifferenced, and upon his abdication, he used the arms, again differenced, but this time with the centre point bearing an imperial crown.<ref>{{Citation|last=Prothero|first=David|title=Flags of the Royal Family, United Kingdom|date=24 September 2002|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-rooth.html|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>
