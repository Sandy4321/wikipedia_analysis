[[Image:HadleyCross-sec.jpg|thumb|This depiction of the [[Hadley cell]] shows the process which sustains low pressure areas.  Diverging winds aloft allow for lower pressure and convergence at the Earth's surface, which leads to upward motion.]]

A '''low pressure area''', or "'''low'''", is a region where the [[atmospheric pressure]] at [[sea level]] is below that of surrounding locations.  Low pressure systems form under areas of wind divergence which occur in upper levels of the [[troposphere]].  The formation process of a low pressure area is known as [[cyclogenesis]].  Within the field of [[Meteorology#Dynamic meteorology|atmospheric dynamics]], areas of wind divergence aloft occur in two areas.  The first area is on the east side of upper troughs which form half of a [[Rossby wave]] within the [[Westerlies]] (a trough with large [[wavelength]] which extends through the (troposphere).  A second area of wind divergence aloft occurs ahead of [[Shortwave (meteorology)|embedded shortwave troughs]] which are of smaller wavelength.  Diverging winds aloft ahead of these troughs cause [[atmospheric]] lift within the troposphere below, which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts the force of gravity.

[[Thermal low]]s form due to localized heating caused by greater sunshine over deserts and other land masses.  Since localized areas of warm air are less dense than their surroundings, this warmer air rises which lowers atmospheric pressure near that portion of the [[Earth]]'s surface.  Large-scale thermal lows over [[continent]]s help drive [[monsoon]] circulations.  Low pressure areas can also form due to organized thunderstorm activity over warm water.  When such an occurrence occurs over the tropics in concert with the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], it is known as a [[monsoon trough]].  Monsoon troughs reach their northerly extent in August and their southerly extent in February.  When a convective low acquires a well-defined circulation in the tropics it is termed a [[tropical cyclone]].  Tropical cyclones can form during any month of the year globally, but can occur in either the northern and southern hemisphere during November.

Atmospheric lift will also generally produce [[cloud cover]] through [[adiabatic lapse rate|adiabatic]] cooling once the air becomes saturated as it rises, although the low pressure area typically bring cloudy skies, which act to minimize [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal temperature extremes]]. Since clouds reflect [[sunlight]], incoming [[shortwave radiation|shortwave]] [[solar radiation]] is less which causes lower [[temperature]]s during the day. At night, the absorptive effect of clouds on outgoing [[longwave radiation]], such as heat energy from the surface, allows for warmer diurnal low temperatures in all seasons.  The stronger the area of low pressure, the stronger the [[wind]]s which are experienced in its vicinity.  Globally, low pressure systems are most frequently located over the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and in the lee of the [[Rocky mountains]].  In Europe (particularly in the [[United Kingdom]]), recurring low pressure weather systems are typically known as depressions.

In [[desert]]s, lack of ground and plant moisture that would normally provide [[evaporative cooling]] can lead to intense, rapid solar heating of the lower layers of air. The hot air is less dense than surrounding cooler air.

[[Wind]] is initially accelerated from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.<ref>BWEA (2007). [http://www.bwea.com/edu/wind.html Education and Careers: What is wind?] British Wind Energy Association. Retrieved on 2009-02-16.</ref>  This is due to [[density]] (or temperature and moisture) differences between two [[air mass]]es.  Since stronger high pressure systems contain cooler or drier air, the air mass is more dense and flows towards areas that are warm or moist, which are in the vicinity of low pressure areas in advance of their associated [[cold front]]s.  The stronger the pressure difference, or [[pressure gradient]], between a high pressure system and a low pressure system, the stronger the wind.<ref name="jet"/>  Thus, stronger areas of low pressure are associated with stronger winds.

The [[Coriolis force]] caused by the [[Earth]]'s rotation is what gives winds within low pressure systems their counterclockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere (as the wind moves inward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure) and clockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere (as the wind moves inward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure).  Friction with land slows down the wind flowing into high pressure systems and causes wind to flow more inward, or flowing more [[geostrophic wind|ageostrophically]], toward their centers.<ref name="jet">JetStream (2008).
