The '''Sei Whale''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]]: {{IPA|[se<U+026A>]}} or {{IPA|[sa<U+026A>]}}), ''Balaenoptera borealis'', is a [[baleen whale]], the third largest member of the [[Balaenopteridae]] family after the [[Blue Whale]] and the [[Fin Whale]].<ref name="mfr">{{cite journal | author= S.L.

==Taxonomy and naming==
[[Image:Rorqual phylogenetic tree.PNG|left|thumbnail|250px|A [[cladogram]] of animals related to the Sei Whale.  Click on the picture to enlarge.]] 
The species was first described by [[Ren<U+00E9>-Primev<U+00E8>re Lesson]] in 1828, but a further description was given by [[Karl Asmund Rudolphi]] and the species is often referred to as '''Rudolphi's Rorqual''' in older texts.<ref name="encyclopedia.org">{{cite web | url=http://83.1911encyclopedia.org/R/RO/RORQUAL.htm | title = Rorqual | publisher = LoveToKnow Classic Encyclopedia | accessdate = 2006-11-03 }}</ref> Other common names for the species include the '''Pollack Whale''' and '''Coalfish Whale'''.

Sei Whales are [[rorquals]] (family [[Balaenopteridae]]), a family that includes the [[Humpback Whale]], the [[Blue Whale]], [[Bryde's Whale]], the [[Fin Whale]] and the [[Minke Whale]]. The family [[Balaenopteridae]] is believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder [[Mysticeti]] as long ago as the middle [[Miocene]].<ref name="evolution">{{cite book | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gingeric/PDFfiles/PDG413_whalesmhyst_opt.pdf | format = PDF | title = McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science & Technology | year = 2004 | publisher = The McGraw Hill Companies | chapter = Whale Evolution | author = Gingerich, P.}}</ref>  However, it is not known when the members of these families diverged from each other.

The word Sei comes from the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word ''seje'' for [[pollock]], a close relative of codfish.  Sei Whales appeared off the coast of [[Norway]] at the same time as the pollock, both coming to feed on the abundant [[plankton]].<ref name="acs"/>  Two geographically separated [[subspecies]] have been identified - the '''Northern Sei Whale''' (''B. b. borealis'') and '''Southern Sei Whale''' (''B. b. schleglii'').<ref name="ITIS">{{ITIS | ID = 180526 | taxon = Balaenoptera borealis | year = 2006 | date = 10 November}}</ref>

==Physical description and behaviour==
[[Image:Baleen Whale Physical Characteristics.png|thumb|right|450px|Physical characteristics of [[baleen whale]]s.  Click on the picture to enlarge.]]

The Sei Whale is the third largest member of the [[Balaenopteridae]] family, after the [[Blue Whale]] and the [[Fin Whale]].<ref name="mfr"/>  Mature adults typically measure between 12.2 and 15.2&nbsp;metres (40&ndash;50&nbsp;ft)<ref name="adw"/> and weigh 20,000 to 30,000&nbsp;kilograms (44,000&ndash;66,000&nbsp;lb).  The Southern Sei Whale is larger than the Northern Sei Whale, and females are considerably larger than males.<ref name="nmfs"/>   The largest known Sei Whale measured 20&nbsp;metres (66&nbsp;ft),<ref name="adw"/> and weighed between 40,000 and 45,000&nbsp;kilograms (88,000&ndash;100,000&nbsp;lb).  The largest specimens taken off [[Iceland]] were slightly longer than 16&nbsp;metres (52&nbsp;ft).<ref name="martin83">{{cite journal | author = Martin, A.R. | year = 1983 | title = The sei whale off western Iceland.

The whale's body is typically a dark steel grey with irregular light grey to white markings on the [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] surface.  The whale has a series of 32-60 [[pleat]]s or grooves along the bottom of the body that allow the [[throat]] area to expand greatly during feeding.   It has a [[sickle]]-shaped [[dorsal fin]] that ranges in height from 25 to 61&nbsp;[[centimetre]]s (10 to 24&nbsp;[[inch|in]]).  The [[snout]] is pointed and the [[Fish anatomy|pectoral fins]] are short.<ref name="adw"/>  It has single ridge extending from the tip of the snout to the paired [[Blowhole (biology)|blowholes]].  The whale's [[skin]] is often marked by pits or [[wound]]s, which after healing become white [[scar]]s.  These are believed to be caused by [[Parasitism|ectoparisitic]] [[copepod]]s (''Penella'' spp.),<ref name="ivashin">{{cite journal | author = Ivashin, M.V. | coauthors = Yu.P.

[[Image:Baleen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A close-up view of baleen plates.  The plates are used to strain food from the water]]

This rorqual is a [[filter feeder]], using its [[baleen]] to obtain its food from the water by opening its mouth, engulfing large amounts of water, then straining it out through its [[baleen plate]]s, trapping any food items inside the mouth.  An adult has between 300 and 380 ashy-black baleen plates on each side of the mouth, about 48&nbsp;centimetres (19&nbsp;in) long.   Each plate is made of [[fingernail]]-like [[keratin]] that frays out into whitish fine hairs on the ends inside the mouth near the [[tongue]].<ref name="adw"/>  The very fine bristles of the Sei Whale's baleen (about 0.1&nbsp;mm, .004&nbsp;in) are cited as the most reliable feature distinguishing it from all other baleen whales.<ref name="mead">{{cite journal | author = Mead, J.G. | year = 1977 | title = Records of sei and Bryde's whales from the Atlantic coast of the United States, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean. | journal = Rep. Int. Whal. Commn | volume = Spec. Iss. 1 | pages = 113-116}}</ref>

The Sei Whale looks similar to other large baleen whales.  The best way to distinguish between it and the [[Bryde's Whale]], apart from differences in each whale's baleen, is by the presense of lateral ridges on the dorsal surface of the Bryde's Whale's head.   Large Sei Whales can be confused with [[Fin Whale]]s unless the Fin Whale's asymmetrical head colouration is clearly seen; the right side of the lower jaw of the Fin Whale is white, and the left side is grey.  Viewed from the side, the Sei Whale's head has a slight arch that differs from the comparatively flat profile of the Fin Whale.<ref name="nmfs"/>

Sei Whales usually move alone<ref name="edds84">{{cite journal | author = Edds, P.L. | coauthors = T.J. MacIntyre, and R. Naveen | year = 1984 | title = Notes on a sei whale (''Balaenoptera borealis'' Lesson) sighted off Maryland | journal = Cetus | volume = 5 | number = 2 | pages = 4-5 }}</ref> or in small groups of up to six individuals.<ref name="schilling"/>  Larger groups have been seen at particularly abudant feeding grounds.  They appear to not have any well-defined [[social structure]].<ref name="mfr"/>

The whale's dive sequence is more regular than its close relatives. Blows occur at intervals of about 40 to 60&nbsp;seconds for a few minutes followed by a "deep dive" lasting five to fifteen&nbsp;minutes. Between shallow dives the whale stays close to the surface and remains visible in clear, calm waters.  Unlike the Fin Whale, the Sei Whale tends not to roll high out of the water as it dives.  The [[Blowhole (biology)|blowholes]] and dorsal fin are often exposed above the water surface simultaneously.  The whale almost never extends its flukes above the surface, and it rarely [[Whale behaviour|breaches]].<ref name="nmfs"/>

===Feeding===
[[Image:Krill swarm.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Image of a swarm of [[krill]], one of the Sei Whale's major foods.]]

The whale feeds near the surface of the ocean, swimming on its side through swarms of [[prey]].  An average Sei Whale eats about 900&nbsp;kilograms (2,000&nbsp;lb) of food each day.<ref name="adw"/>  In the [[North Atlantic]], the Sei Whale feeds primarily on [[Calanoida|calanoid copepods]], with a secondary preference for [[krill|euphausiids]].<ref name="christensen92">{{cite journal |author = Christensen, I. |coauthors = T.

Sei Whales are found worldwide in a band stretching from about 60&nbsp;degrees south [[latitude]] to 60&nbsp;degrees north latitude, preferring deep off-shore waters<ref name="Gambell85a"/> and tending to avoid [[tropical]] waters.<ref name="nmfs"/>   The difficulty of distinguishing Sei Whales at seas from their close relatives, [[Bryde's Whale]]s and in some cases from [[Fin Whale]]s, has created confusion about their distributional limits and frequency of occurance, especially in warmer waters where Bryde's Whales are most common.

In the [[North Atlantic]], the range of the Sei Whale extends from [[southern Europe]] or [[Northwest Africa|northwestern Africa]] to [[Norway]] in the east, and from the [[southern United States]] to [[West Greenland]] in the west.<ref name="Gambell85a"/>  The southernmost confirmed records are strandings along the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]] and in the [[Greater Antilles]].<ref name="mead"/>  Throughout its range, the whale tends to avoid semi-enclosed bodies of water such as the Gulf of Mexico, the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]], [[Hudson Bay]], the [[North Sea]], and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref name="nmfs"/>   It occurs predominantly in deep water, occuring most commonly over the [[continental slope]],<ref name="CETAP">{{cite paper | author = CETAP | year = 1982 | title = Final Report of the Cetacean and Turtle Assessment Program, University of Rhode Island, to Bureau of Land Management | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior.

In the North Pacific, the Sei Whale is found from 20<U+00B0>N to 23<U+00B0>N [[latitude]] in the winter, and from 35<U+00B0>N to 50<U+00B0>N latitude in the summer.<ref name="masaki76">{{cite journal | author = Masaki, Y. | year = 1976 | title = Biological studies on the North Pacific sei whale | journal = Bull.

In general, the Sei Whale migrates annually from cool and subpolar waters in summer to temperate and tropical waters for winter.<ref name="nmfs"/>  In the northwest Atlantic, sightings and catch records suggest that the whale moves north along the shelf edge to arrive in the areas of [[Georges Bank]], [[Gulf of Maine|Northeast Channel]], and [[Gulf of Maine|Browns Bank]] by mid to late June.  They are present off the south coast of [[Newfoundland]] in August and September, and a southbound migration begins moving west and south along the [[Nova Scotia]]n shelf from mid-September to mid-November.  Whales in the [[Labrador Sea]] as early as the first week of June may move farther northward to waters southwest of [[Greenland]] later in the summer.<ref name="mitchell and chapman">{{cite journal | author = Mitchell, E. | coauthors = D.G.

Large females lead the northward migration and reach the [[Denmark Strait]] earlier and more reliably than other sexes and classes, arriving in mid-July and remaining through mid-September.  In some years, males and younger females remain at lower latitudes during the summer months.<ref name="martin83"/> 

Despite knowing some general trends in the migration pattern of the Sei Whale, exact migration routes are not known<ref name="martin83"/> and it is not easy to predict exactly where groups will appear from one year to the next.

[[Image:Whaling harpoon.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A whaling harpoon.]]

The development of explosive [[harpoon]]s and steam-powered catcher boats in the late nineteenth century allowed the exploitation of previously unobtainable large whales by commercial [[Whaling|whalers]].  Because of their quick speed and elusiveness,<ref name="sigurj<U+00F3>nsson88">{{cite journal | author = Sigurj<U+00F3>nsson, J.|year =  1988 |title= Operational factors of the Icelandic large whale fishery | journal = Rep.

===Southern Hemisphere===
A total of 152,233 Sei Whales were caught in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] between 1910 and 1979.<ref name="horwood87"/>   Whaling in the [[southern ocean]]s originally targeted [[Humpback Whale]]s.  By 1913, this target species became rare and the catch of [[Fin Whale|Fin]] and [[Blue Whale]]s began to increase.  As these species likewise became scarce, Sei Whale catches increased rapidly in the late 1950s and early 1960s.<ref name="mizroch84"/>  The catch peaked in 1964 at over 20,000 Sei Whales, but by 1976, this number had dropped to below 2,000 and commercial whaling for the species ended in 1977.<ref name="mfr"/>

===International protection===
[[Image:Members_of_the_International_Whaling_Commission.PNG|330px|thumb|Member states of the International Whaling Commission (in blue).]]

The Sei Whale did not have meaningful protection at the international level until 1970, when catch quotas for the [[North Pacific]] began to be set on a species basis by the [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC).  Prior to that time, the kill was limited only by whalers' ability to find the whales.<ref name="allen80">{{cite book | author = Allen, K.R. | year = 1980 | title = Conservation and Management of Whales | publisher = Univ. of Washington Press | location = Seattle, WA }}</ref>  The Sei Whale was given complete protection from commercial whaling in the North Pacific in 1976, and quotas on Sei Whales were introduced in the North Atlantic in 1977.  With the moratorium on commercial whaling taking effect in the Northern Hemisphere in 1986, all legal whaling for Sei Whales stopped.<ref name="nmfs"/>  In the late 1970's, some "[[pirate]]" whaling took place in the eastern [[North Atlantic]].<ref name="best92">{{cite journal | author = Best, P.B. | year = 1992 | title = Catches of fin whales in the North Atlantic by the M.V.

Populations in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] are listed as [[CITES]] Appendix II, indicating that they are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but may become so if they are not listed.<ref name="adw"/>

===Current whaling===
Since the moratorium on commercial whaling, some Sei Whales have been caught and killed by [[Iceland]]ic and [[Japan]]ese whalers under the IWC's scientific research programme.  Iceland carried out four years of scientific whaling between 1986 and 1989, catching up to 40 Sei Whales a year.<ref name="wwf-iceland">{{cite press release | publisher = WWF-International | title = WWF condemns Iceland<U+2019>s announcement to resume whaling | date = [[2003-08-07]] | url = http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/arctic/news/index.cfm?uNewsID=8221 | accessdate = 2006-11-10 }}</ref>  Japanese scientists kill approximately 50 Sei Whales each year for this purpose.  The main focus of the research is to examine what Sei Whales eat and to determine the level of competition between whales and fisheries.  Dr. Seiji Ohsumi, Director General of the [[Institute of Cetacean Research]] in [[Tokyo]], said "It is estimated that whales consume 3 to 5 times the amount of marine resources as are caught for human consumption, so our whale research is providing valuable information required for improving the management of all our marine resources."<ref name="icr02a">{{cite press release | publisher = The Institute of Cetacean Research, Tokyo, Japan | title = Japan not catching endangered whales | date = [[2002-03-01]] | url = http://www.icrwhale.org/eng/SEI.pdf | accessdate = 2006-11-10}}</ref>  He later added that "...Sei Whales are the second most abundant species of whale in the western North Pacific, with an estimated population of over 28,000 animals.  [It is] clearly not endangered."<ref name="icr02b">{{cite press release | publisher = The Institute of Cetacean Research, Tokyo, Japan | title = Japan's senior whale scientist responds to New York Times advertisement | date = [[2002-05-20]] | accessdate = 2006-11-10 | url=http://www.icrwhale.org/eng/NYTimes.pdf }}</ref>  Environmental campaigners dispute the necessity of the research, saying that it is known that Sei Whales feed primarily on [[squid]] and [[plankton]] not hunted by humans, and only rarely on [[fish]].  They claim that the programme is "nothing more than a plan designed to keep the whaling fleet in business, and the need to use whales as the scapegoat for over-fishing by humans."<ref name="wwf05"/>  The scientific quality of the research itself has been criticised as being very poor; at the 2001 meeting of the IWC Scientific Committee, 32 scientists submitted a document expressing their belief that the Japanese programme lacked scientific rigour and would not meet minimum standards of [[academic review]] that are widely used in science world-wide.<ref name="clapham02">{{cite journal | author = Clapham, P. et al. | year = 2002 | title = Relevance of JARPN II to management, and a note on scientific standards.

==Historic and current abundance==
The global population of the Sei Whale is estimated at only 54,000, about one fifth of the  population before the era of commercial [[whaling]].<ref name="acs"/>  In the [[North Atlantic]], the most current (1991) estimate based upon the history of catches and catch per unit effort (CPUE) data is 4,000.<ref name="braham84">{{cite journal | author = Braham, H.W. | year = 1984 | title = The status of endangered whales: an overview | journal = Mar.
