The '''10% of brain myth''' is the widely-perpetuated [[myth]] that most or all [[human]] beings only make use of 10 [[percent]] of their [[human brain|brain]]s. By association, it is often suggested that by some process a person may harness this unused potential and in so doing increase their [[intelligence]].

Though many factors of intelligence may be increased with training, the idea that large parts of the brain remain unused is without substantial foundation. Although many mysteries regarding brain function remain, every part of the brain has a known function.<ref name="snopes10pct">{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/10percnt.htm| title=The Ten-Percent Myth| first=Benjamin| last=Radford| publisher=snopes.com| date=8 February 2000| accessdate=2006-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.brainconnection.com/topics/?main=fa/brain-myth| title=Myths About the Brain: 10 percent and Counting| first=Eric| last=Chudler| accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.twopercentco.com/rants/archives/2005/03/a_piece_of_our.html| title=A Piece of Our Mind - About Ten Percent| publisher=The Two Percent Company| accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The myth originated in 1890s [[reserve energy]] theories of Harvard psychologists [[William James]] and [[Boris Sidis]] who tested the theory in the accelerated raising of child prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> [[William Sidis]] to affect an adulthood [[IQ]] of 250-300; a theory latter famously summarized in 1936 by American writer [[Lowell Thomas]] to the effect that <U+201C>the average person develops only 10 percent of his latent mental ability."{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Misattributions==
The myth has been variously misattributed to a number of people including [[Albert Einstein]]:

*The 10% myth most likely arose from a misunderstanding (or public misrepresentation) of neurological research undertaken in the late 1800s or early 1900s when researchers either:
**discovered that only about 10% of the neurons in the brain are [[action potential|firing]] at any given time; or
**announced that they had only mapped the functions of 10% of the brain at that time (accounts differ on this point).
*Another possible origin of the 10% myth is that neurons only compose approximately 10% of the cells in the brain; the rest are [[glial cells]] that, despite being involved in learning, function differently from neurons.
*Albert Einstein is reported as quipping that people typically only use 10% of their brains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=people-only-use-10-percent-of-brain| title=Do People Only Use 10 Percent Of Their Brains| publisher=[[Scientific American]]| date=7 February 2008| accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref>
*There is not a direct relationship between the performance of the brain and its level of activation; this variable has confounded scientists, because some 'gifted' individuals showed less brain activity than those with brain performance considered average. Haier proposed that indeed more gifted individuals might possess more efficient brain circuits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
*Dr. James W. Kalat, author of the textbook Biological Psychology, points out that neuroscientists in the 1930s knew about the existence of the large number of "local" neurons in the brain, but only knew that these cells were small. The misunderstanding of the function of local neurons may have led to the 10% myth.<ref>Kalat, J.W., Biological Psychology, sixth edition, Pacific Grove: Brooks/Cole Publishing Co., 1998, p. 43.</ref>

==Refutation==
Neuroscientist [[Barry Beyerstein]] sets out seven kinds of evidence against the ten percent myth:<ref name="beyerstein">{{cite book|last=Beyerstein|first=Barry L.|title=Mind Myths: Exploring Popular Assumptions About the Mind and Brain|editor=Sergio Della Sala|publisher=Wiley|date=1999|pages=3<U+2013>24|chapter=Whence Cometh the Myth that We Only Use 10% of our Brains?|isbn=0471983039}}</ref>

* Studies of brain damage: If 90% of the brain is normally unused, then damage to these areas should not impair performance. Instead, there is almost no area of the brain that can be damaged without loss of abilities. Even small areas of damage can have profound effects.
* Evolution: The brain is enormously costly to the rest of the body, in terms of oxygen and nutrient consumption. If 90% of it were unnecessary, there would be a large survival advantage to humans with smaller, more efficient brains. So the process of [[natural selection]] would have eliminated the inefficient brains.
* Brain imaging: Technologies such as [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) and [[Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (fMRI) allow the activity of the living brain to be monitored. They reveal that even during [[sleep]], all parts of the brain show some level of activity. Only in the case of serious damage does a brain have "silent" areas.
* Localization of function: Rather than acting as a single mass, the brain has [[Localization of brain function|distinct regions for different kinds of information processing]]. Decades of research has gone into mapping functions onto areas of the brain, and no function-less areas have been found.
* Microstructural analysis: In the [[single-unit recording]] technique, researchers insert a tiny electrode into the brain to monitor the activity of a single cell. If 90% of cells were unused, then this technique would have revealed that.
* Metabolic studies: Another scientific technique involves studying the take-up of [[radioactive tracer|radioactively labelled]] [[2-deoxyglucose]] molecules by the brain. If 90 percent of the brain were inactive, then those inactive cells would be show up as blank areas in a [[radiograph]] of the brain. Again, there is no such result.
* Neural disease: Brain cells that are not used have a tendency to degenerate. Hence if 90% of the brain were inactive, [[autopsy]] of adult brains would reveal large-scale degeneration.

==Perpetuation==
The 10% myth has been spread both unwittingly, by individuals believing it to be fact, and deliberately as an advantageous deception. It is frequently used to give strength to arguments in [[cognitive training]] or counseling.

The 10% brain myth occurs frequently in advertisements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/tenper.html| title=Neuroscience For Kids| publisher=Eric H. Chudler, Ph.d(University of Washington, Director of Education and Outreach)}}</ref>

Some [[New Age]] proponents propagate this belief by asserting that the "unused" ninety percent of the human brain is capable of exhibiting [[psionics|psychic powers]] and can be trained to perform [[psychokinesis]] and [[extra-sensory perception]].<ref name="snopes10pct" /><ref name="beyerstein" />  In addition to the fact that humans use their entire brain, there is no scientific evidence supporting the existence of psychic powers at all.<ref name="beyerstein" />

==In popular culture==
* The [[DC Comics]] character [[Deathstroke]] gained superhuman powers by increasing the use of his brain from 10% to 90%.
* In the film ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'', [[Owen Wilson]] uses the myth as a pick up line for the bridesmaid "You know how they say we only use 10 percent of our brains, I think we only use 10 percent of our hearts."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396269/quotes| title=Wedding Crashers (2005) - Memorable quotes(IMDB)}}</ref>
* In [[Stargate]], mainly in the [[Stargate SG-1]] and [[Stargate Atlantis]] series, the Ancients [[Ascension (Stargate)#Ascension|ascended]] to an all powerful form of being after expanding their brain function above 90%.<ref>Stargate Atlantis Season 3 eps 54 "Tao of Rodney"</ref>
* In [[Kyle XY]] the main character uses 70% of his brain, having supernatural powers and being able to learn as quickly as snapping fingers.
* In [[The Simpsons]] episode [[Brother's Little Helper]], Bart takes a prescription pill called ''Focusyn''. When bragging about his newfound smarts, Bart tells his sister Lisa, "Did you know that most people use 10% of their brains? I am now one of them!"
* In the 2009 film [[Race to Witch Mountain]], the extraterrestrial humans Sarah and Seth have access to [[telekinesis]], [[telepathy]], and [[Phasing (ability)|phasing]], which Sarah states the humans on Earth can not use yet, because they "haven't learned to use that part of [their] brain yet." Ironically, in an interview with [[AnnaSophia Robb]], who plays Sarah, she confirmed that the director wrote that line in because he wanted to be "as scientifically accurate as possible."
* The 'fact' of small percentage of brain use is central to the plot of the film [[Defending Your Life]]. People from Earth are said to use only 3-5% of their brains, and hence derisively called "little brain" by people in Judgment City who use higher percentages.
* The concept of increased brain usage resulting in superhuman powers such as telekinesis etc. is also central to the plot of the film [[Phenomenon (film)|Phenomenon]], where [[John Travolta]]'s character George gains the aforementioned powers due to an eventually fatal brain tumour that 'activates' more of his brain than in the case of any human ever tested.
*In the 1995 movie [[Powder (film)|Powder]], the title character apparently uses more than 10% of his brain and is therefore gifted with supernatural and/or psychic abilities. [[Jeff Goldblum]]'s character suggests that if one were to use 100% of their brain, they would no longer require a physical body and would transform into "pure energy". This statement is illustrated when Powder turns into lightning at the end of the movie, suggesting he had finally used all of the remaining 90% of his brain.
*In the film ''[[My Stepmother Is an Alien]]'', the alien Celeste explains that "We use 104% of our brain capacity, as opposed to your 36%."
* In the book ''[[The Zombie Survival Guide]]'', when talking about how the undead are able to track prey equally well, whether they still have their eyes intact or not, it's mentioned that this might be because the undead brain functions differently from the human brain and might exploit the other 90%.
* In the 2010 film ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010 film)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'', the character Balthazar explains to Dave that sorcerers use 100% of their brain, unlike normal humans who use only 10%.
* In the 2010 film ''[[Inception (2010 film)|Inception]]'', the character Dom Cobb explains to Ariadne that people use 100% of their brain while they are asleep, opposed to when they are awake. Then they only use 10%.
* In the 1986 film ''[[Flight Of The Navigator]]'', Max, the drone ship's AI, had discovered that humans only use 10% of their brain. So as an experiment filled Joey's head with star charts and other various but alien information.
