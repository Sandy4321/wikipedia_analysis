A {{nihongo|'''capsule hotel'''|<U+30AB><U+30D7><U+30BB><U+30EB><U+30DB><U+30C6><U+30EB>|kapuseru hoteru}} is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features a large number of extremely small "rooms" (capsules) intended to provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require the services offered by more conventional hotels.

==Description==
The guest room is a modular plastic or [[fiberglass]] block roughly {{Convert|2|by|1|by|1.25|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Facilities differ, but most include a television, an electronic console, and [[wireless internet]] connection. The capsules are stacked side-by-side, two units high, with steps providing access to the second level rooms.  The open end of the capsule can be closed, for privacy, with a curtain or a fibreglass door. Luggage is stored in a locker; and washrooms are communal. Guests are asked not to smoke or eat in the capsules.<ref>Solomon, Leonard (1997). ''Japan in a Nutshell''. Top Hat Press, 115-166. ISBN 0-912509-06-6.</ref> Some hotels also provide restaurants (or at least [[vending machine]]s), pools, and other entertainment facilities.<ref>Schreiber, Mark, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110116x2.html Back to the future of a 'hotel for 2001']", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 16 January 2011, pp. 7<U+2013>8.</ref>

Capsule hotels vary in size, from fifty or so capsules to 700, and they are used primarily by men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2025.html#capsule |title=Accommodation in Japan |publisher=Japan-guide.com |date=2012-11-11 |accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref> Some capsule hotels offer separate sections for male and female guests. Clothes and shoes are sometimes exchanged for a ''[[yukata]]'' and slippers on entry. A towel may also be provided. The benefit of these hotels is convenience and price, usually around <U+00A5>2000-4000 (USD {{To USD|2000|JPN|round=yes}}-{{To USD|4000|JPN|round=yes}}) a night.  They provide an alternative for those who (especially on weeknights) may be too [[drunk]] to return home safely, or too embarrassed to face their spouses.<ref>Wardell, Steven (October 1994), "Capsule cure". ''Atlantic Monthly''. '''274''' (4):42-47.</ref> With continued [[Japanese Recession|recession in Japan]], as of early 2010, more and more guests - roughly 30% at the Capsule Hotel Shinjuku 510 in [[Tokyo]] - were unemployed or [[underemployment|underemployed]] and were renting capsules by the month.<ref>Tabuchi, Hiroko.

This style of hotel has not gained wide popularity outside of Japan, although Western variants known as "pod hotels"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/news/story_2357.html|title=Pod Hotels: Small, Stylish, and Cheap|author=Fodor's Editors|publisher=Fodors.com|date=December 31, 2007|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}</ref> have been developed, with larger accommodations and often private baths.

==History==
The first capsule hotel to open was the Capsule Inn Osaka, designed by [[Kisho Kurokawa]] and located in the [[Umeda]] district of [[Osaka]]. It opened in 1979.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://capsulehotel-inn-osaka.com/|title= Capsule Inn Osaka|publisher= |location= |language= Japanese|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 24 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kotobuki.co.jp/company/history.html|title= Kotobuki Corporation History|publisher= Kotobuki Corporation|location= |language= Japanese|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 24 December 2010}}</ref>
