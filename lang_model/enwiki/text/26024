}}</ref>   On ocean basin scales, this technique is also known as acoustic thermometry.  The technique relies on precisely measuring the time it takes sound signals to travel between two instruments, one an acoustic source and one a [[hydrophone|receiver]], separated by ranges of 100<U+2013>5000&nbsp;km.    If the locations of the instruments are known precisely, the measurement of time-of-flight can be used to infer the speed of sound, averaged over the acoustic path.  Changes in the [[speed of sound]] are primarily caused by changes in the temperature of the ocean, hence the measurement of the travel times is equivalent to a measurement of temperature.     A 1 <U+00B0>C change in temperature corresponds to about 4&nbsp;m/s change in sound speed.   An oceanographic experiment employing tomography typically uses several source-receiver pairs in a [[Mooring (oceanography)|moored]] array that measures an area of ocean.

== Motivation ==
[[Seawater]] is an [[electrical conductor]], so the oceans are opaque to [[electromagnetic energy]] (e.g., [[light]] or [[radar]]). The oceans are fairly transparent to low-frequency acoustics, however.  The oceans conduct sound very  efficiently, particularly sound at low frequencies, i.e., less than a few hundred hertz.<ref name="HIFT">{{cite web

<ref name="stormy"/> to suggest "acoustic tomography" for ocean measurement in the late 1970s.  The advantages of the acoustical approach to measuring temperature are twofold.  First, large areas of the ocean's interior can be measured by [[remote sensing]].  Second, the technique naturally averages over the small scale fluctuations of temperature (i.e., noise) that dominate ocean variability.  

From its beginning, the idea of observations of the ocean by acoustics was married to estimation of the ocean's state using modern [[Global climate model|numerical ocean models]] and the techniques assimilating data into numerical models.  As the observational technique has matured, so too have the methods of [[data assimilation]] and the computing power required to perform those calculations.

==Multipath arrivals and tomography==
[[Image:Rays test.gif|thumb|right|436px| Propagation of acoustic ray paths through the ocean.  From the acoustic source at left, the paths are [[refraction|refracted]] by faster sound speed above and below the [[SOFAR channel]], hence they oscillate about the channel axis.  Tomography exploits these "multipaths" to infer information about temperature
variations as a function of depth.  Note that the aspect ratio of the figure has been greatly skewed to better illustrate the rays; the maximum depth of the figure is only 4.5&nbsp;km, while the maximum range is 500&nbsp;km.]]

One of the intriguing aspects of tomography is that it exploits the fact that acoustic signals travel along  a set of generally stable ray paths.    From a single transmitted acoustic signal, this set of rays gives rise to multiple arrivals at the receiver, the travel time of each arrival corresponding to a particular ray path.   The earliest arrivals correspond to the deeper-traveling rays, since these rays travel where sound speed is greatest.  The ray paths are easily calculated using computers ("[[Ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]]"), and each ray path can generally be identified with a particular travel time.  The multiple travel times measure the sound speed averaged over each of the multiple acoustic paths.  These measurements make it possible to infer aspects of the structure of temperature or current variations as a function of depth.  The solution for sound speed, hence temperature, from the acoustic travel times is an [[inverse problem]].

==The integrating property of long-range acoustic measurements==
Ocean acoustic tomography integrates temperature variations over large distances, that is, the measured travel times result from the accumulated effects of all the temperature variations along the acoustic path, hence measurements by the technique are inherently averaging.    This is an important, unique property, since the ubiquitous small-scale turbulent and internal-wave features of the ocean usually dominate the signals in measurements at single points.  For example, measurements by [[thermometers]] (i.e., moored thermistors or [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo]] drifting floats) have to contend with this 1-2 <U+00B0>C noise, so that large numbers of instruments are required to obtain an accurate measure of average temperature.  For measuring the average temperature of ocean basins, therefore, the acoustic measurement is quite cost effective.  Tomographic measurements also average variability over depth as well, since the ray paths cycle throughout the water column.

==Reciprocal tomography==
"Reciprocal tomography" employs the simultaneous transmissions between two acoustic transceivers.  A "transceiver" is an instrument incorporating both an acoustic source and a receiver.  The slight differences in travel time between the reciprocally-traveling signals are used to measure [[ocean current]]s, since the reciprocal signals travel with and against the current.  The average of these reciprocal travel times is the measure of temperature, with the small effects from ocean currents entirely removed.   Ocean temperatures are inferred from the ''sum'' of reciprocal travel times, while the currents are inferred from the ''difference'' of reciprocal travel times.  Generally, ocean currents (typically 10&nbsp;cm/s) have a much smaller effect on travel times than sound speed variations (typically 5&nbsp;m/s), so "one-way" tomography measures temperature to good approximation.

==Applications==
In the ocean, large-scale temperature changes can occur over time intervals from minutes ([[internal waves]]) to decades (oceanic [[climate change]]).   Tomography has been employed to measure variability over this wide range of temporal scales and over a wide range of spatial scales.  Indeed, tomography has been contemplated as a measurement of ocean climate using transmissions over [[antipodes|antipodal]] distances.<ref name="HIFT" />

One of the earliest applications of tomography in ocean observation occurred in 1988-9.  A collaboration between groups at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] and the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] deployed a six-element tomographic array in the [[abyssal plain]] of the [[Greenland Sea]] [[Oceanic gyre|gyre]] to study [[Thermohaline_circulation#Formation_of_deep_water_masses|deep water formation]] and the gyre circulation.<ref name="GSP1">{{cite news

==Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC)==
Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) is an idea to observe the world's [[ocean]]s, and the ocean climate in particular, using trans-[[Oceanic basin|basin]] [[acoustics|acoustic]] [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmissions]].  Prototype measurements of [[temperature]] have been made in the [[North Pacific|North Pacific Basin]] and across the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic Basin]].<ref name="OAT"/>

The original ATOC program implemented in the North Pacific Ocean formally ended in 2006.  Acoustic transmissions were made from 1996 through Fall 2006, when agreed-upon environmental protocols ended.  The decade-long deployment of the acoustic source showed that the observations are sustainable on even a modest budget.  The transmissions have been verified to provide an accurate measurement of ocean temperature on the acoustic paths, with uncertainties that are far smaller than any other approach to ocean temperature measurement.<ref name='Science-1998'>{{cite news

}}</ref> Public discussion was complicated by technical issues from a variety of disciplines ([[physical oceanography]], [[underwater acoustics|acoustics]], marine mammal biology, etc.) that makes understanding the effects of acoustics on marine mammals difficult for the experts, let alone the general public.  Many of the issues concerning acoustics in the ocean and their effects on marine mammals were unknown.  Finally, there were a variety of public misconceptions initially, such as a confusion of the definition of sound levels in air vs. sound levels in water.  If a given number of decibels in water are interpreted as decibels in air, the sound level will seem to be orders of magnitude larger than it really is - at one point the ATOC sound levels were erroneously interpreted as "louder than 10,000 [[Boeing 747|747]] airplanes".<ref name="stormy">{{cite book

The ocean carries sound so efficiently that sounds do not have to be that loud to cross ocean basins.

In the case of the ATOC, the source was mounted on the bottom about a half mile deep, hence marine mammals, which are bound to the surface, were generally further than a half mile from the source.  This fact, combined with the modest source level, the infrequent 2% duty cycle (the sound is on only 2% of the day), and other such factors, made the sound transmissions benign in its effect on marine life.

==Types of transmitted acoustic signals==
Tomographic transmissions consist of long coded signals (e.g., [[Maximum length sequence|"m-sequences"]]) lasting 30 seconds or more.  The frequencies employed range from  50 to 1000&nbsp;Hz and source levels range from 100-250 W, depending on the particular goals of the measurements.  With precise timing such as from [[GPS]], travel times can be measured to a nominal accuracy of 1 millisecond.  While these transmissions are audible near the source, beyond a range of several kilometers the signals are usually below ambient noise levels, requiring sophisticated [[spread-spectrum]] [[signal processing]] techniques to recover them.
