'''Daniel Lambert''' (13 March 1770&nbsp;<U+2013> 21 June 1809) was a gaol{{#tag:ref|In this period, a gaol was a building used for holding suspects awaiting trial and recently convicted criminals awaiting transfer to prison, transportation or execution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/routcbh/gaol_delivery|title=Gaol Delivery|last=Arnold-Baker|first=Charles|year=2001|work=The Companion to British History}} (subscription required)</ref> The term was sometimes spelled "jail", but in official usage was always "gaol"; the institution of which Lambert was keeper was named the County Gaol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://record-office-catalogue.leics.gov.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqSearch=%28RefNo==%27QS/32/3%27%29|title=County Gaol And House Of Correction|publisher=The Record Office for Leicestershire, Leicester & Rutland|accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref>|group=n}} keeper and animal breeder from [[Leicester]], [[England]], famous for his unusually large size. After serving four years as an apprentice at an engraving and [[die casting]] works in [[Birmingham]], he returned to Leicester in around 1788 and succeeded his father as keeper of Leicester's gaol. He was a keen sportsman and extremely strong, on one occasion fighting a bear in the streets of Leicester. He was an expert in [[sporting animals]], widely respected for his expertise on dogs, horses and [[cockfight|fighting cocks]].

At around the time of his return to Leicester his weight began to increase steadily, even though he was a keen sportsman and, by his own account, abstained from alcohol and did not eat unusual amounts of food. In 1805 the gaol of which Lambert was keeper closed. By this time he weighed 50&nbsp;stone (700&nbsp;lb; 320&nbsp;kg), and had become the heaviest authenticated person in recorded history. Sensitive about his bulk and unemployable, Lambert became a recluse.

In 1806 poverty forced Lambert to put himself on exhibition to raise money. In April 1806 he took up residence in London, charging spectators to enter his apartments to meet him. Visitors were impressed by his intelligence and personality, and visiting him became highly fashionable. After some months on public display Lambert grew tired of exhibiting himself, and in September 1806 he returned wealthy to Leicester, where he bred sporting dogs and regularly attended sporting events. Between 1806 and 1809 he made a further series of short fundraising tours.

In June 1809 he died suddenly in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]]. At the time of his death he weighed 52&nbsp;stone 11&nbsp;lb (739&nbsp;lb; 335&nbsp;kg), and his coffin required 112 square feet (10.4&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) of wood. Despite the coffin being built with wheels to allow easy transport, and a sloping approach being dug to the grave, it took 20 men almost half an hour to drag his casket into the trench, in a newly opened [[burial ground]] to the rear of [[St Martin's Church, Stamford|St Martin's Church]]. While others have since overtaken Daniel Lambert's record as the [[List of the heaviest people|heaviest person in history]], he remains a popular character in Leicester, and in 2009 was described by the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'' as "one of the city's most cherished icons".

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Daniel Lambert was born at his parents' house in Blue Boar Lane, [[Leicester]], on 13&nbsp;March 1770.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=112}}{{#tag:ref|Blue Boar Lane is best known as the site of the Blue Boar, the [[coaching inn]] in which [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] spent his last night on 21&nbsp;August 1485 before his death at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]]. A blue boar was the emblem of the [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford|13th Earl of Oxford]], who was aligned with [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] against Richard; it is thought that at the time of Richard's stay the inn was known as the Blue Bell.{{sfn|Thompson|1849|p=198}}|group=n}} His father, also named Daniel Lambert, had been the [[fox-hunting|huntsman]] to [[Harry Grey, 4th Earl of Stamford]],<ref name="DNB">{{citation|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15932|title=Daniel Lambert|last=Seccombe|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Seccombe|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}} (subscription or [http://www.oup.com/oxforddnb/info/freeodnb/libraries/ UK public library membership] required)</ref> and at the time of his son's birth was the keeper of Leicester's [[bridewell]] (gaol).{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=112}} The eldest of four children, Daniel Lambert had two sisters, and a brother who died young.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=4}}

From his early teens Lambert was a keen sportsman.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=4}} At the age of eight he was a keen swimmer,{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=10}} and for much of his life he taught local children to swim.{{sfn|Timbs|1866|p=273}}  Lambert's paternal uncle<U+2014>like his father<U+2014>also worked with animals, but as a professional [[gamekeeper]], and his maternal grandfather was a breeder of champion [[fighting cock]]s.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=4}}  Lambert grew up with a strong interest in field sports,{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=4}} and was particularly fond of [[otter hunting]], [[fishing]], [[Shooting sports|shooting]] and [[horse racing]].{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=21}}  By his late teens he was considered an expert in the breeding of [[hunting dog]]s.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=113}}

In 1784 he was [[apprentice]]d to Messrs Taylor & Co, an engraving and [[die casting]] works in [[Birmingham]] owned by a Mr&nbsp;Benjamin Patrick.<ref name="DNB" />  The engraved buckles and buttons in which Patrick's factory specialised became unfashionable however, and the business went into decline.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=113}} In 1788 Lambert returned to Leicester, to serve as his father's assistant at the gaol<ref name="DNB" /> (some sources date Lambert's return to Leicester to 1791, following the destruction of the building housing Messrs Taylor & Co in the [[Priestley Riots]] of July 1791).{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=113}}  His father soon retired, and Lambert succeeded as gaol keeper.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=114}} The younger Daniel Lambert was a much-respected gaoler; he befriended many of the prisoners, and made every effort to help them when they went to trial.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=114}}{{#tag:ref|"Whatever severity he might be under the necessity of exercising towards the unhappy objects committed to his care during their confinement, he never forbore to make the greatest exertions to assist them, at the time of their trials. Few left the prison without testifying their gratitude, and tears often bespoke the sincerity of the feelings they expressed."{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=11}}|group=n}}

===Weight===
Although by his own account Lambert did not eat unusually large amounts of food, at about the time of his return to Leicester his weight began to increase steadily, and by 1793 he weighed 32&nbsp;stone (450&nbsp;lb; 200&nbsp;kg).<ref name="DNB" /> Concerned for his fitness, in his spare time he devoted himself to exercise, building his strength to the point where he was able to easily carry five&nbsp;hundredweight (560&nbsp;lb; 250&nbsp;kg).{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=113}} On one occasion, while he was watching a [[dancing bear]] on display in Blue Boar Lane, his dog slipped loose and bit it.  The bear knocked the dog to the ground, and Lambert asked its keeper to restrain it so he could retrieve his wounded animal, but the keeper removed the bear's muzzle to allow it to kill the dog.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=113}} Lambert reportedly struck the bear with a pole, and with his left hand punched its head, knocking it to the ground; the dog escaped successfully.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=114}}{{#tag:ref|While Daniel Lambert having fought a bear is not disputed, the account of Lambert's victory in the fight may not be accurate. Some sources say that the bear was victorious and Lambert only narrowly escaped with his life.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=126}} For a full account of Lambert's fight with the bear, published during Lambert's lifetime and with his approval, see {{harvnb|Wilson|1806|pp=6<U+2013>8}}.|group=n}}

Despite his increasingly large girth, Lambert remained fit and active, once walking seven&nbsp;miles (11&nbsp;km) from [[Woolwich]] to the [[City of London]] "with much less apparent fatigue than several middle-sized men who were of the party".{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=10}}  Although not particularly agile, he was not significantly restricted by his bulk, and was able to stand on one leg and kick the other to a height of 7&nbsp;feet (2.1&nbsp;m).{{sfn|Timbs|1866|p=273}} He continued to teach swimming in Leicester, and was able to stay afloat with two grown men sitting on his back.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=114}} He disliked changing his clothes, and each morning habitually wore the clothes he had worn the day before, regardless of whether they were still wet;{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=22}} by Lambert's own account he suffered no colds or other ill effects from this behaviour.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=23}}

By 1801 Lambert's weight had increased to about 40&nbsp;stone (560&nbsp;lb; 250&nbsp;kg), and as his bulk meant neither he nor his horse were able to keep up with the hunt he was forced to give up hunting.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=114}} He continued to maintain an interest in field sports, keeping a pack of 30&nbsp;[[terrier]]s.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=21}} By this time, although he retained his solid reputation as a gaoler, serious concerns were being raised about his fitness for the post.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=115}} Traditional gaols were falling out of favour and being replaced with [[forced labour]] institutions, and in 1805 the old Bridewell gaol was closed.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=11}} Lambert was left without a job, but was granted an [[Annuity (European financial arrangements)|annuity]] of <U+00A3>50 (about <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50|1805|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) a year by the Leicester magistrates, in recognition of his excellent service as gaol keeper.{{sfn|Dickens|1852|p=548}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}}

===Unemployment===
Lambert's girth was then enormous; six men of normal size could fit together inside his waistcoat,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=127}} and each of his stockings was the size of a sack.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=112}}  His <U+00A3>50 annuity did not adequately cover his living costs, and his bulk also prevented him from working.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=116}}  He became a virtual recluse.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|pp=11<U+2013>12}}  Stories of his bulk had by then begun to spread, and travellers visiting Leicester would use various pretexts to visit his home. One such visitor asked Lambert's servant to allow him entry, as he wished to ask Lambert's advice about fighting cocks; Lambert leaned out of the window and told the servant to "tell the gentleman that I am a [[Cock throwing|shy cock]]".{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=12}} On another occasion he admitted into his house a [[Nottingham]] man who sought his advice about a mare's pedigree; on realising the man was only visiting to look at him, Lambert told him that the horse in question was "by Impertinence out of Curiosity".{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=115}}  

Sensitive about his weight, Daniel Lambert refused to allow himself to be weighed, but in around 1805, some friends persuaded him to come with them to a cock fight in [[Loughborough]]. Once he had squeezed his way into their carriage, the rest of the party drove the carriage onto a large weighing machine and jumped out. After deducting the weight of the (previously weighed) empty carriage, they calculated that Lambert's weight was now 50&nbsp;stone (700&nbsp;lb; 320&nbsp;kg), and that he had thus overtaken [[Edward Bright]], the {{convert|616|lb|adj=on}} "Fat Man of Maldon",{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=28}} as the heaviest authenticated person in recorded history.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=116}}{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=129}}

Despite his shyness he badly needed to earn money, and saw no alternative to putting himself on display, and charging his spectators.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=116}} So, on 4&nbsp;April 1806 he boarded a specially built carriage and travelled from Leicester{{sfn|Timbs|1866|pp=273<U+2013>274}} to his new home at 53&nbsp;[[Piccadilly]], then near the western edge of [[London]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=116}} For five hours each day he welcomed visitors into his home, charging each a&nbsp;[[shilling (British coin)|shilling]] (about <U+00A3>{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|.05|1806|r=1}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}<ref name="1806 Times ad">{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Exhibition |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/712/329/118142162w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS16919170&dyn=9!xrn_2_0_CS16919170&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib |format=subscription required |section=Classified advertising |day_of_week=Wednesday  |date=1806-04-02 |page_number=1 |issue=6700 |column=B }}</ref>

Lambert shared his interests and knowledge of sports, dogs and animal husbandry with London's middle and upper classes,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=118}} and it soon became highly fashionable to visit him, or become his friend.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=118}} Many called repeatedly; one banker made 20&nbsp;visits and paid on each occasion.{{sfn|Dickens|1852|p=548}} During this period of English history no real stigma was attached to obesity, and Lambert was generally considered a wonder to be marvelled at, rather than a freak to be gawped or sneered at.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=118}} His venture was immediately successful, drawing around 400&nbsp;paying visitors per day.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=117}} His home was described as having the air of a fashionable resort, rather than that of an exhibition, and he was pleased to find that his customers generally treated him with courtesy, and not simply as a spectacle.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=13}} He insisted on maintaining amongst his visitors an atmosphere of civility; all men entering his rooms were obliged to remove their hats.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=118}} One visitor refused to remove his hat, "even if the King were present". Lambert replied that ""Then by G<U+2014><U+2014>, Sir, you must instantly quit this room, as I do not consider it a mark of respect due to myself, but to the ladies and gentlemen who honor me with their company."{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=14}})

Lambert's popularity inspired an imitator in "Master Wybrants, Mr. Lambert in miniature", exhibited a short distance away in Sackville Street.{{sfn|Altick|1978|p=254}} A handbill described Wybrants as "Master Wybrants the Modern Hercules, who at the age of 4&nbsp;Months weighed 39&nbsp;pounds, measured 2&nbsp;feet round the Body 15&nbsp;Inches round the thigh and 8&nbsp;Inches round the Arm, to be seen at the corner of Sackville Street Piccadilly".{{sfn|Altick|1978|p=254}}

People would travel long distances to see him (on one occasion, a party of&nbsp;14 travelled from [[Guernsey]] to London to do just that),{{#tag:ref|"He was one day visited by a party of fourteen, eight ladies and six gentlemen, who expressed their joy at not being too late, as it was near the time of closing the door for the day. They assured him that they had come from Guernsey on purpose to convince themselves of the existence of such a prodigy as Mr.&nbsp;Lambert had been described to be by one of their neighbors, who had seen him; adding, that they had not even one single friend or acquaintance in London, so that they had no other motive whatever for their voyage.<U+2014>A striking illustration of the power of curiosity over the human mind."{{sfn|Wilson|1806|pp=14<U+2013>15}}|group=n}} and many would spend hours speaking with him on animal breeding.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=118}} A life-sized waxwork of Lambert was displayed in London, where it became extremely popular.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=126}} Daniel Lambert soon became a popular subject with cartoonists, who often depicted him as [[John Bull]].{{sfn|Altick|1978|p=254}} He mixed well with the upper classes, and on one occasion met [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George&nbsp;III]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=118}} The King's and Lambert's reactions to each other are not recorded.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=118}}

===Medical examination===
[[File:Daniel Lambert.jpg|right|thumb|Daniel Lambert during his first exhibition in London|alt=Smartly dressed fat man with dark hair sitting on a chair]]
Lambert soon came to the attention of the medical profession, and shortly after his arrival in London the ''Medical and Physical Journal'' published an article on him.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=117}} They confirmed that he weighed {{convert|50|st|lb kg}}, and measured his height as {{convert|5|ft|11|in}}.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=117}} A thorough medical examination found that his bodily functions worked correctly, and that he breathed freely.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=117}}{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=2}} Lambert was described as active and mentally alert,{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=2}} widely read, and with an excellent memory.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=3}} He was fond of singing,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=118}} and had a normal speaking voice which showed no signs of pressure on the lungs.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=2}} Doctors found [[tumefaction]] of his feet, legs and thighs, and accumulation of fat within the abdomen,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=117}} but other than scaly and thickened skin on his legs caused by previous attacks of [[erysipelas]], he had no health problems. Lambert told the doctors that he ate normal quantities of ordinary food.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=117}} He claimed that since about 1795 he had drunk nothing but water,{{sfn|Dickens|1864|p=355}} and that even while young, and a regular party-goer, he did not join his fellow revellers in drinking.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=19}} Lambert estimated that he was able to walk about a quarter of a mile (400&nbsp;m) without difficulty.{{sfn|Wilson|1842|p=20}} He slept regularly for no more than eight hours per night, always with his window open, and was never heard to snore;{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=20}} on waking he was always fully alert within five minutes,{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=20}} and he never napped during the day.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=2}}

====Possible causes====
It is impossible to be certain about what caused Daniel Lambert's extreme weight, but it is considered unlikely to have been caused by an [[endocrine]] (glandular) or genetic disorder.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=131<U+2013>132}} Other than his weight gain he showed no symptoms of a thyroid disorder,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=131<U+2013>132}} and none of his many portraits show the [[moon face]] of a patient with [[Cushing's syndrome]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=132}} Patients with [[Bardet<U+2013>Biedl syndrome]] and [[Prader<U+2013>Willi syndrome]], genetic syndromes which can lead to obesity in patients, also suffer from [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] and muscular weakness, but all those who knew Lambert agreed that he was highly intelligent, extremely strong physically, and other than erysipelas and venous insufficiency ([[varicose veins]]) in his legs did not suffer from any health problems;{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=132}} one contemporary commentator remarked that "Mr. Lambert scarcely knows what it is to be ailing or indisposed".{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=19}} Lambert's only recorded psychological problem was an occasional "depression of the spirits", during his time in London.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=22}} Although he had an aunt and uncle who were overweight, his parents and surviving siblings remained of normal build throughout their lives.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|pp=3<U+2013>4}}

Consequently, it is likely that Lambert's weight gain was caused not by a physical disorder but by a combination of overeating and a lack of exercise.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=132}} Although heavily built in his teens, he began to gain weight only when he took up the relatively sedentary job of prison keeper.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=133}} A biography of Lambert published during his lifetime recounted that "it was within a year of this appointment that his bulk received the greatest and most rapid encrease".{{sfn|Wilson|1806|pp=9<U+2013>10}} Although he claimed to eat little, and to abstain from alcohol, it is unlikely that a man with his lifestyle and position in society would not have eaten large amounts of meat, or drunk beer at social events.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=133}}

===J<U+00F3>zef Boruw<U+0142>aski===
After some months in London, Lambert was visited by [[J<U+00F3>zef Boruw<U+0142>aski]], a 3-foot 3-inch (99&nbsp;cm) dwarf then in his seventies.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=119}} Generally considered to be the last of Europe's court dwarfs,{{sfn|Leroi|2003|p=175}} Boruw<U+0142>aski was born in 1739 to a poor family in rural [[Pokuttya]].{{sfn|Leroi|2003|p=170}}  He was introduced to the [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Empress Maria Theresa]] in 1754,{{sfn|Leroi|2003|p=171}} and after a short time residing with deposed Polish king [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Leszczy<U+0144>ski]]{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=119}} he exhibited himself around Europe, thus becoming a wealthy man.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=211}} At age&nbsp;60 he retired to [[Durham]],{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=212}} where he became such a popular figure that the City of Durham paid him to live there.{{sfn|Leroi|2003|p=174}}  He became one of its most prominent citizens.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=212}}{{#tag:ref|Boruw<U+0142>aski was a popular figure in Durham, and is buried in [[Durham Cathedral]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=212}}|group=n}}  Boruw<U+0142>aski had a superb memory, and recalled that Lambert, while still employed by Patrick's die casting works and before he grew fat, had paid to see him in Birmingham.  Boruw<U+0142>aski remarked "I have seen this face twenty years before at Birmingham, but certainly it be another body".{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=119}} He had been told that Lambert's bulk was a hoax, and he therefore felt his leg to prove to himself that it was not.  They also compared their respective outfits, and calculated that one of Lambert's sleeves would provide enough cloth to make an entire coat for Boruw<U+0142>aski.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=16}} Lambert enquired after Boruw<U+0142>aski's wife, Isalina Barbutan,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=119}} whereupon the latter replied "No, she is dead, and I am not very sorry, for when I affront her, she put me on the mantle-shelf for punishment."{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=16}}

The meeting of Lambert and Boruw<U+0142>aski, the largest and smallest men in the country,{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=16}} was the subject of enormous public interest; one newspaper reported that "It was ''Sir John Falstaff'' and ''Tom Thumb'', which must have afforded a ''double'' treat to the curious".{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=119}}  Boruw<U+0142>aski lived to see his 98th year, despite the prediction of the money-lender who sold him his annuity<U+2014>that his small stature would make him prone to illness.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=212}}

===Disillusionment===
{{Quote box|width=24em|salign=right|quote=The half-courteous, half-sullen manner in which this "gross fat man" received the majority of his visitors met the humour of my husband, and he liked as well as pitied him; for it was distressing sometimes to hear the coarse observations made by unfeeling people, and the silly unthinking questions asked by many of them about his appetite,&nbsp;&c.|source=Anne Mathews (n<U+00E9>e Jackson), widow of [[Charles Mathews]], on Mathews' relationship with Lambert{{sfn|Mathews|1860|p=384}}}}
Although generally respected by London society, the longer he remained there, the more irritable he became.  Shy and self-conscious,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=120}} he was annoyed at repeatedly being asked about the size of his clothes.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=120}}  In answer to one request, to a woman who enquired as to the cost of his coat, he replied "I cannot pretend to charge my memory with the price, but I can put you into a method of obtaining the information you want. If you think proper to make me a present of a new coat, you will then know exactly what it costs".{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=18}}  Another interested spectator claimed that since his entrance fee was paying for Lambert's clothing, he had the right to know about it; Lambert replied "Sir, if I knew what part of my next coat your shilling would pay for, I can assure you I would cut out the piece".{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=17}} Lambert calculated in 1806 that a full suit of clothes cost him <U+00A3>20,{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=34}} about <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20|1806|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}.{{Inflation-fn|UK}}

===Return to Leicester===
Lambert had the acumen to refuse the management offers of various impresarios and agents,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=121}} and by September 1806, he had returned to Leicester as a wealthy man.{{sfn|Wilson|1806|p=19}}  He returned to his favourite pastimes, breeding sporting dogs and fighting cocks.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=122}} A terrier bitch, for which he was offered 100&nbsp;[[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (about <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|105|1806|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK}} was said to be the finest in England.  He refused to sell the dog, which became his lifetime companion.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=122}} He began again to attend sporting events,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=121}} as a report on the [[Leicester Racecourse|Leicester Races]] of 19&nbsp;September 1806 reported that "Among the distinguished characters upon the turf we were glad to see our old friend, Mr&nbsp;Daniel Lambert, in apparent high health and spirits".<ref>{{citation|date=1806-09-19|journal=Leicester Journal|location=Leicester}}, quoted {{harvnb|Bondeson|2006|p=122}}</ref> Although too heavy to follow hunts on horseback, he used a portion of the money earned in London to build up a pack of [[greyhound]]s, watching from his carriage as they [[hare coursing|coursed hares]] in the Leicestershire countryside.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=122}}

In December 1806 Lambert went on a brief fundraising tour, and exhibited himself in Birmingham and [[Coventry]].  Early the next year he returned to London, and stayed in the fashionable [[Leicester Square]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=122}}  There he fell ill; his physician Dr&nbsp;Heaviside felt that his illness may have been caused by the polluted London air, and Lambert returned to Leicester.{{sfn|Timbs|1866|p=274}} He recovered, and later in 1807 made a series of tours of England.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=122}}

Bondeson</ref>}}
In summer 1808 Lambert briefly returned to the capital, where he sold a pair of [[spaniel]]s for 75&nbsp;guineas (about <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|78.75|1808|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) at [[Tattersalls]].{{Inflation-fn|UK}}{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=122}} Later that year he exhibited himself in [[York]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=123}} In June 1809 he set off on another tour of [[East Anglia]], to conclude in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] during the Stamford Races.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=123}} One account suggests that this tour was intended to be his last, as he was then sufficiently wealthy enough to retire.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=123}} While on the tour Lambert was weighed in Ipswich; his weight was 52&nbsp;stone 11&nbsp;lb (739&nbsp;lb; 335&nbsp;kg).{{sfn|Timbs|1866|p=274}} No longer able to use stairs, he took lodgings on the ground floor of the Waggon & Horses inn at 47&nbsp;Stamford High Street on 20&nbsp;June.<ref name="DNB" />{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=123}}

===Death===
Following his arrival at Stamford, Lambert sent a message to the ''[[Stamford Mercury]]'', ordering advertisements and handbills.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=124}} Stating that "as the Mountain could not wait upon Mahomet, Mahomet would go to the mountain", he asked the printer to visit him at the Waggon & Horses, to discuss his printing requirements.{{sfn|Wilson|1842|p=19}} That evening Lambert was in bed and admitted to feeling tired, but nonetheless he was able to discuss his requirements with the printer, and was anxious that the handbills be delivered on time.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=124}}

On the morning of 21&nbsp;June Lambert woke at his usual time and appeared in good health.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=124}} As he began to shave, he complained of breathing difficulties.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=124}} Ten minutes later, he collapsed and died.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=124}}

There was no autopsy, and the cause of Lambert's death is unknown.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=134}} While many sources say that he died of a fatty degeneration of the heart or of stress on his heart caused by his bulk, his behaviour in the period leading to his death does not match that of someone suffering from [[cardiac insufficiency]]; witnesses agree that on the morning of his death he appeared well, before he became short of breath and collapsed.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=134}} Bondeson&nbsp;(2006) speculates that the most consistent explanation of his death, given his symptoms and medical history, is that he had a sudden [[pulmonary embolism]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=134}}

==Burial==
Lambert's corpse rapidly began to [[putrefaction|putrefy]].  There was no question of his body being returned to Leicester, and so on 22&nbsp;June it was placed inside an <!-- 112 square feet (10.4&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) -->[[elm]] coffin, 6&nbsp;feet 4&nbsp;inches long, 4&nbsp;feet 4&nbsp;inches wide and 2&nbsp;feet 4&nbsp;inches deep (193&nbsp;cm&nbsp;<U+00D7> 132&nbsp;cm&nbsp;<U+00D7> 71&nbsp;cm), built on wheels to allow it to be moved.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=124}}{{sfn|Wilson|1842|p=19}}  The coffin was so large that to wheel it out of the inn and to the newly opened [[burial ground]] at the rear of [[St Martin's Church, Stamford|St Martin's Church]], the window and wall of his apartment were demolished.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Human Obesity |format=subscription required|url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/55/35/84001986w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS135185670&dyn=8!xrn_2_0_CS135185670&hst_1?sw_aep=wes_ttda|section=News |day_of_week=Monday |date=1883-08-06 |page_number=8 |issue=30891 |column=C }}</ref>  A suitably sized grave had been dug, with a sloping approach to avoid the need to lower the coffin from above, but on 23&nbsp;June it nonetheless took almost half an hour for twenty men to pull Lambert's enormous coffin into the grave.{{sfn|Timbs|1866|pp=275<U+2013>276}}

==After death==
In late 1809, a Mr&nbsp;J. Drakard released ''The life of that wonderful and extraordinary heavy man, the late Danl. Lambert, from his birth to the moment of his dissolution, with an account of men noted for their corpulency, and other interesting matter'', the first full biography of Lambert to be released after his death.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=125}} Lambert's position as the heaviest person in recorded history was soon overtaken by the American [[Mills Darden]] (1799<U+2013>1857), but Lambert had by now become a cult figure, and virtually every item connected with him was preserved for posterity.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=126}} His clothes and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, and many of them are preserved in museums today.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=126}}

Across England many public houses and inns were renamed after Daniel Lambert, particularly in Leicester and Stamford.

[[File:Lambert engraving.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Print of "Daniel Lambert, of surprising corpulency", published in 1821|alt=Smartly dressed fat man with dark hair sitting on a chair]]
The term "Daniel Lambert" entered common use in English speech and writing, to refer to any fat man.{{sfn|Gilman|2010|p=3}} His name continued in this use long after the details of his life had been largely forgotten; in 1852, [[Charles Dickens]] remarked that "Lambert's name is known better than his history".{{sfn|Dickens|1852|p=547}} Dickens's ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'' compares the obese [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] to Lambert,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=128}} and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] used the term in ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' to refer to the obese Joseph Sedley,{{sfn|Thackeray|1848|p=50}}{{#tag:ref|'Jos, that fat ''gourmand'', drank up the whole contents of the bowl; and the consequence of his drinking up the whole contents of the bowl was, a liveliness which at first was astonishing, and then became almost painful; for he talked and laughed so loud as to bring scores of listeners round the box, much to the confusion of the innocent party within it; and, volunteering to sing a song (which he did in that maudlin high key peculiar to gentlemen in an inebriated state), he almost drew away the audience who were gathered round the musicians in the gilt scollop-shell, and received from his hearers a great deal of applause. "Brayvo, Fat un!" said one; "Angcore, Daniel Lambert!" said another; "What a figure for the tight-rope!" exclaimed another wag, to the inexpressible alarm of the ladies, and the great anger of Mr. Osborne.'{{sfn|Thackeray|1848|pp=49<U+2013>50}}|group=n}} and in ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'' to refer to the fat servant Tim.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=128}} As time progressed, "Daniel Lambert" came to mean anything exceptionally large; [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''The Study of Sociology'' used the phrase "a Daniel Lambert of learning",<ref name="Spencer">{{citation|last=Spencer|first=Herbert|authorlink=Herbert Spencer|date=1873-06|title=The Study of Sociology|journal=The Popular Science Monthly|location=London|volume=3|issue=9|page=p.&nbsp;50}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|"When facts are not organised into faculty, the greater the mass of them the more will the mind stagger along under its burden, hampered instead of helped by its acquisitions.

In 1838, the ''[[English Annual]]'' published a series of poems, purportedly written by Lambert and found amongst his papers at the Waggon and Horses after his death. No source published during Lambert's lifetime mentions his having any interest in poetry or in any reading matter other than periodicals on field sports, and it is unclear why his papers should have been with him in Stamford at his death, rather than at his home in Leicester. The discoverer of the poems is credited only as "Omega".<ref>{{citation|last="Omega"|year=1838|title=Some account of the late Daniel Lambert, Esq, with selections from his papers|journal=The English Annual|publisher=Edward Churton|location=London|pages=pp.&nbsp;282<U+2013>300}}</ref> It is possible that the poems are a hoax.

===P. T. Barnum and General Tom Thumb===
[[P. T. Barnum]] and the 25-inch (64&nbsp;cm) tall [[General Tom Thumb]] (Charles Sherwood Stratton) visited Stamford in 1846 and donated one of Thumb's costumes to Dixon to be displayed alongside Lambert's.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=127}} General Tom Thumb visited Stamford again in 1859 and was tied up inside one of Lambert's stockings.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=127}} In 1866 General Tom Thumb, with his equally short wife [[Lavinia Warren]] (Mercy Lavinia Warren Bump), her sister [[Minnie Warren]] (Huldah Pierce Warren Bump) and Barnum's other celebrated dwarf [[Commodore Nutt]] (George Washington Morrison Nutt) visited Stamford.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=127}} All four were able to pass through the knee of Lambert's breeches together.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=127}} In 1866 Lambert's and Tom Thumb's clothes were sold to the Old London Tavern in Stamford;{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=127}} they are now on display at the [[Stamford Museum]].<ref name="Stamford Museum">{{citation|url=http://www.localauthoritypublishing.co.uk/councils/stamford/buildings.html|title=Buildings and features of interest|publisher=Stamford Town Council|page=1|accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref> (In June 2010 it was announced that the Stamford Museum is to close in June 2011.

The 1806 waxwork of Lambert was exported to the United States, and was on show in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], by 1813.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=126}} By 1828 the statue was in the [[Washington Gardens (Boston)|Boston Vauxhall Gardens]], dressed in a complete set of Lambert's clothes.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=126}} The statue was later bought by P. T. Barnum, and displayed at [[Barnum's American Museum]] in New York. In the 1865 fire which destroyed the first American Museum, workmen endeavoured to save the waxwork but it melted in the heat and was destroyed.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=126}}

===In popular memory===
Lambert is still a popular character in Leicester, described in 2009 by the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'' as "one of the city's most cherished icons";<ref>{{citation|title=Pick of the day|date=2009-08-25|work=Leicester Mercury|page=21|accessdate=24 June 2010|location=Leicester}}</ref> several local public houses and businesses are named after him.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=112}} [[Sue Townsend]]'s play ''The Ghost of Daniel Lambert'', in which Lambert's ghost watches disapprovingly over the 1960s demolition and redevelopment of Leicester's historic town centre, premiered at Leicester's [[Haymarket Theatre (Leicester)|Haymarket Theatre]] in 1981.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Leicester Lamented |author=Ned Chaillet |section=Reviews |day_of_week=Monday |date=1981-06-15 |page_number=7 |issue=60954 |column=E |format=subscription required|url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/55/35/84001986w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS118327503&dyn=16!xrn_72_0_CS118327503&hst_1?sw_aep=wes_ttda}}</ref> Lambert is also a popular figure in Stamford, and local football team [[Stamford A.F.C.]] are nicknamed "The Daniels" after him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stamfordafc.net/club/history/|title=History|last=ETD Media|publisher=Stamford Association Football Club Ltd.|accessdate=2010-08-06|location=Stamford}}</ref>
