Kerala is often referred to as ''Keralam'' by the native [[Malayalis]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2cbCr7M4SJ8C&pg=PA117&dq=keralam&q=keralam|title=Asceticism and its critics: historical accounts and comparative perspectives|author=Oliver Freiberger|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=0195307917}}</ref> Scholars agree that ''Kerala'' transliterates [[Tamil language|Classical Tamil]] ''Cheralam'' ("Land of the [[Chera Dynasties|Cheras]]") or ''chera-alam'', ("[[wikt:declivity|declivity]] of a hill or a mountain slope/range").

==Kerala in religious traditions==
The oldest of the surviving [[Hindu]] [[Puranas]], the [[Matsya Purana]], sets the story of the first of the [[Dashavatara|incarnations]] of Lord [[Vishnu]], the [[Matsya]] [[Avatar]], and King [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] (King Satyavrata, mankind's ancestor), among Kerala's [[Malaya Mountains]].<ref>[http://www.indiadivine.org/articles/442/1/The-Matsya-Purana/Page1 Indiadivine.org]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://vedicschool.org/stories/matsya.html Vedic School for Kids <U+2013> for kids ages 7 to 12<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=GOCT9uTULJgC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=Matsya+Malaya+Malabar&source=bl&ots=fzkli-Tzfc&sig=kNz5dkAsysoj8Xp1eY8kv2OJDhQ&hl=en&ei=B_9CTaKmOtGxrAe51t0e&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CD0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=Matsya%20Malaya%20Malabar&f=false History of the Brahmans: a research ... <U+2013> Google Books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/01-10/features1629.htm The Sampradaya Sun <U+2013> Independent Vaisnava News <U+2013> Feature Stories <U+2013> January 2010<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

The earliest Sanskrit text to mention Kerala by name is the [[Aitareya Aranyaka]] of [[Rigveda]].<ref name="lit" />

The legendary king [[Mahabali]] is said to have ruled from Kerala in a reign of universal happiness and prosperity. On his passing away he was appointed ruler of the netherworld (''Patalam'') by ''[[Vamana]]'', the fifth ''avatar'' of Lord ''[[Vishnu]]''. There is a belief that, Once a year, during the [[Onam]] festival, he returns to Kerala.

In the religious texts known as the [[Puranas]], Kerala is ''Parasurama Kshetram'' ("The Land of Parasurama"). [[Parasurama]] was a warrior sage and an [[Avatar]] of [[Mahavishnu]]. When he threw his battle axe from [[Gokarna, India|Gokarna]] into the sea at [[Kanyakumari]], the land of Kerala arose from the waters.<ref>{{cite book |author=Aiya VN |title=The Travancore State Manual |publisher=Travancore Government Press |pages=210<U+2013>212 |year=1906 |accessdate=2007-11-12 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=RdzaPW-kEvQC }}</ref> Tradition says that Parasurama minted gold coins called Rasi, sowed some of them in [[Travancore]] and buried the surplus in cairns.<ref>Nagendra Kumar Singh,  ''Encyclopaedia of Hinduism'', p. 1931.</ref> Similar legends link Parasurama to the [[Pandyan]] dynasty.<ref>One such legend one names the spear thrower as Vadimbalamba Ninrapandyan; in another, he is Ukkira Pandiyan, who obtains the spear from the Sivan of Madura.

====Post-Chera period====
The Kulasekhara dynasty came to an end by twelfth century, weakened by the invasions and military subjugations of [[Rashtrakuta]]s, [[Pandyas|Later Pandyas]], and [[Later Cholas]].<ref name="kerala.gov.in"/> However, King Ravi Varma Kulashekhara of the southern [[Venad|Venad kingdom]] was able to establish a short-lived supremacy over southern India. But, after his death, in the absence of a strong central power, the state fractured into small warring principalities governed by [[Nair]]-[[Brahmin]] chieftains. From these, the kingdoms of [[Venad|Venad (Quilon)]], [[Kolathiri|Kolathiri (Cannanore)]], [[History of Kozhikode|Kozhikode (Calicut)]] [[Samuthiri]] and [[Kingdom of Cochin|Kochi (Cochin)]] emerged.

=== The colonial era ===

The western spice-trade, especially in [[Black pepper|pepper]], became increasingly lucrative. Around the 15th century, the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] began to dominate the eastern shipping trade in general, and the spice-trade in particular, culminating in [[Vasco Da Gama]]'s arrival in [[Kappad]] [[Kozhikode]] in 1498.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Ravindran PN |title=Black Pepper: Piper Nigrum |publisher=CRC Press |year=2000 |accessdate=11 November 2007 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=VaGCgSLrdr4C |page=3 |isbn=9789057024535 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |author=Curtin PD |title=Cross-Cultural Trade in World History |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-5212-6931-8 |page=144}}</ref><ref name="Mundadan_1984">{{Cite book |author=Mundadan AM |year=1984 |title=Volume I: From the Beginning up to the Sixteenth Century (up to 1542) |series=History of Christianity in India |publisher=Theological Publications |others=Church History Association of India |location=Bangalore }}</ref> On 25 March 1505, [[Francisco de Almeida]] was appointed Viceroy of Portuguese India, with headquarters at [[Kochi, India|Kochi]].

The weakened Portuguese were ousted by the [[Dutch East India Company]], who took advantage of continuing conflicts between [[Saamoothiri|Kozhikode]] and [[Kingdom of Cochin|Kochi]] to gain control of the trade. The Dutch in turn were weakened by constant battles with [[Marthanda Varma]] of the [[Travancore Royal Family]], and were defeated at the [[Battle of Colachel]] in 1741. An agreement was signed by the Dutch and Travancore in 1753, in which the Dutch promised not to attack Travancore. This agreement was signed at [[Mavelikkara]], so it is known as the ''Mavelikkara treaty''. The Dutch were allied to French forces in the transcontinental [[Napoleonic Wars]]; forces of the [[British East India Company]] marched against them from [[Calicut]] and took their surrender and possessions on 20 Oct 1795. In 1766, [[Hyder Ali]], the ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] [[Mysorean invasion of Kerala#Invasion by Hyder Ali|invaded northern Kerala]]; his son and successor, [[Tipu Sultan]], [[Mysorean invasion of Kerala#Invasions by Tipu Sultan|launched campaigns]] against the expanding British East India Company, resulting in two of the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Tipu ultimately ceded [[Malabar District]] and [[South Kanara]] to the Company in the 1790s; the Company forged tributary alliances with Kochi in 1791 and Travancore in 1795. Malabar and South Kanara became part of the [[Madras Presidency]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Superintendent of Government Printing |title=Imperial Gazetteer of India (Provincial Series): Madras |publisher=Government of India |location=Calcutta |year=1908 |accessdate=11 November 2007 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=xXglUxeS_WkC |page=22 }}</ref>

===Post Independence===
After [[British India]] was [[Partition of India|partitioned]] in 1947 into India and [[Pakistan]], [[Travancore]] and [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]] joined the [[Union of India]] and on 1 July 1949 were merged to form [[Travancore-Cochin]]. On 1 January 1950 ([[Republic Day of India|Republic Day]]), [[Travancore-Cochin]] was recognised as a state. The [[Madras Presidency]] was organised to form [[Madras State]] in 1947.

On 1 November 1956, the state of Kerala was formed by the [[States Reorganisation Act]] merging the Malabar district, Travancore-Cochin (excluding four southern [[tehsil|taluks]], which were merged with Tamil Nadu), and the taluk of [[Kasaragod Town|Kasargod]], [[South Kanara]].<ref name="Plunkett">{{harvnb|Plunkett|Cannon|Harding|2001|p=24}}</ref> In 1957, elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly were held, and a reformist, [[Communist]]-led government came to power, under [[E.

Kerala is wedged between the [[Lakshadweep sea]] and the [[Western Ghats]]. Lying between north latitudes 8<U+00B0>18' and 12<U+00B0>48' and east longitudes 74<U+00B0>52' and 77<U+00B0>22',<ref name = "GOK_2005b"/><ref>[http://india.gov.in/knowindia/st_kerala.php Kerala <U+2013> States and Union Territories <U+2013> Know India] National Portal of India</ref> Kerala experiences the humid [[equatorial climate|equatorial tropic climate]].

Geographically, Kerala can be divided into three climatically distinct regions: the eastern highlands (rugged and cool mountainous terrain), the central midlands (rolling hills), and the western lowlands (coastal plains). Located at the extreme southern tip of the [[Indian subcontinent]], Kerala lies near the centre of the [[Indian Plate|Indian]] [[tectonic plate]]; hence, most of the state is subject to comparatively little [[earthquake|seismic]] and volcanic activity.<ref>{{Cite map |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |year=2002 |title=Map Showing Multi Hazard Zones in Kerala |url=http://www.undp.org.in/dmweb/Multihazard/Maps/Multihazard/kerala.jpg |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061108004906/http://www.undp.org.in/dmweb/Multihazard/Maps/Multihazard/kerala.jpg |archivedate=8 November 2006 |accessdate=12 January 2006 }}</ref> [[Pre-Cambrian]] and [[Pleistocene]] geological formations compose the bulk of Kerala<U+2019>s terrain.

[[File:Kallar, Kerala.jpg|thumb|Coconut trees]]

The eastern region of Kerala consists of high mountains, gorges and deep-cut valleys immediately west of the Western Ghats' [[rain shadow]]. Forty-one of Kerala<U+2019>s west-flowing rivers, and three of its east-flowing ones originate in this region. The Western Ghats form a wall of mountains interrupted only near [[Palakkad]] (hence also known Pal''ghat''), where the [[Palakkad Gap]] breaks through to provide access to the rest of India. The Western Ghats rises on average to 1,500&nbsp;m (4920&nbsp;ft) above sea level, while the highest peaks reach above 2,500&nbsp;m (8200&nbsp;ft). [[Anamudi]], the highest peak in South India, is at an elevation of 2,695 metres (8,842&nbsp;ft). Just west of the mountains lie the midland plains comprising central Kerala, dominated by rolling hills and valleys.<ref name = "GOK_2005b"/> Generally ranging between elevations of 250<U+2013>1,000&nbsp;m (820<U+2013>3300&nbsp;ft), the eastern portions of the [[Nilgiri Hills|Nilgiri]] and [[Palni Hills]] include such formations as [[Agastya Mala]] and [[Anamala]].

Kerala<U+2019>s western coastal belt is relatively flat, and is criss-crossed by a network of interconnected [[brackish]] [[canal]]s, lakes, [[estuary|estuaries]], and rivers known as the [[Kerala Backwaters]]. Lake [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]], Kerala<U+2019>s largest body of water, dominates the Backwaters; it lies between [[Alappuzha]] and [[Kochi]] and is more than {{convert|200|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in area. Around 8% of India's waterways (measured by length) are found in Kerala.<ref name="IWAI_2005">{{harvnb|Inland Waterways Authority of India|2005}}</ref> The most important of Kerala<U+2019>s [[List of rivers in Kerala|forty-four rivers]] include the [[Periyar River|Periyar]] (244&nbsp;km), the [[Bharathapuzha]] (209&nbsp;km), the [[Pamba River|Pamba]] (176&nbsp;km), the [[Chaliyar River|Chaliyar]] (169&nbsp;km), the [[Kadalundipuzha River]] (130&nbsp;km), the [[Valapattanam River|Valapattanam]] (129&nbsp;km) and the [[Achankovil River|Achankovil]] (128&nbsp;km). The average length of the rivers of Kerala is 64&nbsp;km. Many of the rivers are small and entirely fed by [[monsoon]] rains.<ref name = "GOK_2005b"/> These conditions result in the nearly year-round water logging of such western regions as [[Kuttanad]], 500&nbsp;km<U+00B2> of which lies below sea level. As Kerala's rivers are small and lack [[river delta|deltas]], they are more prone to environmental factors. The rivers also face problems such as sand mining and pollution.<ref name="Padmalal">Padmalal D, Maya K, Sreebha S & Sreeja R, 2007, Environmental effects of river sand mining: a case from the river catchments of [[Vembanad lake]], Southwest coast of India, Environmental Geology 54(4), 879<U+2013>889.

==Subdivisions==
{{Main|Districts of Kerala|Corporations, municipalities and taluks of Kerala}}

[[Districts of Kerala|Kerala's fourteen districts]] are distributed among Kerala's six historical regions: North Malabar (Far-north Kerala), South Malabar (northern Kerala), Kochi (central Kerala), Northern Travancore, Central Travancore (southern Kerala) and Southern Travancore (Far-south Kerala). Kerala's modern-day districts (listed in order from north to south) correspond to them as follows:

''Note that these subdivisions are historical and unofficial, that there was no official subdivisions such as South Malabar-North Malabar, or South-Central-North Travancore''
* [[North Malabar]]: [[Kasaragod District|Kasaragod]], [[Kannur District|Kannur]], [[Mananthavady]] Taluk of [[Wayanad District|Wayanad]], [[Koyilandy]] and [[Vadakara]] Taluks of [[Kozhikode District|Kozhikode]]
* South Malabar: [[Wayanad District|Wayanad]] except [[Mananthavady]] Taluk, [[Kozhikode District|Kozhikode]] except [[Vadakara]] and [[Koyilandy]] Taluks, [[Malappuram District|Malappuram]], [[Palakkad District]] except [[Chittur]] and [[Alathur]] Taluks and a part of [[Thrissur District|Thrissur]]
* [[Kingdom of Cochin|Kochi]]: A part of [[Ernakulam District|Ernakulam]], [[Chittur|Chittur Taluk]] and [[Alathur|Alathur Taluks]] of [[Palakkad District|Palakkad]], and a majority part of [[Thrissur District|Thrissur]].
* [[Northern Travancore]]: Part of Ernakulam, and [[Idukki district|Idukki]].
* [[Central Travancore]]: Southern part of [[Idukki district|Idukki]], [[Kottayam District|Kottayam]], [[Alappuzha District|Alappuzha]], [[Pathanamthitta District|Pathanamthitta]] and northern part of [[Kollam District|Kollam]].
* [[Southern Travancore]]: Southern part of [[Kollam District|Kollam]], [[Thiruvananthapuram District|Thiruvananthapuram]]. Nanchinad in [[Kanyakumari]], which is now in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], was also part of southern Travancore before formation of Kerala.

Kerala's 14 districts, which serve as the administrative regions for taxation purposes, are further subdivided into 63 [[tehsil|taluks]]; these have fiscal and administrative powers over settlements within their borders, including maintenance of local land records.[[Taluks of Kerala|Taluks of kerala]] are further divided into 1453 revenue villages and 1007 [[Gram panchayat]]s.

[[Mah<U+00E9>, India|Mah<U+00E9>]], a part of the Indian union territory of [[Pondicherry]] (Puducherry), is a coastal exclave surrounded by Kerala on all of its landward approaches.

==Government==
{{Main|Government of Kerala }}

===Agriculture===
Kerala produces 97% of national output of [[Black pepper|pepper]] and accounts for 85% out of the area under [[natural rubber]] in the country. [[Coconut]], [[tea]], [[coffee]], [[cashew]], and [[spices]] <U+2014> including [[cardamom]], [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]], and [[nutmeg]] <U+2014> comprise a critical agricultural sector. A key agricultural staple is rice, with some six hundred varieties grown in Kerala's extensive paddy fields. Nevertheless, [[home gardens]] comprise a significant portion of the agricultural sector. Related [[animal husbandry]] is also important, and is touted by proponents as a means of alleviating rural poverty and unemployment among women, the marginalized, and the landless. Feeding, milking, breeding, management, health care, and concomitant micro-enterprises all provide work for around 32 [[lakh]] (3.2 million) of Kerala's 55 lakh (5.5 million) households. The state government seeks to promote such activity via educational campaigns and the development of new cattle breeds such as the "Sunandini".

===Fisheries===
Fisheries contribute about 3% of the total economy of the state. The natural
landforms of the state endow Kerala with a huge output of marine and freshwater fish haul each year. About 10.85 lakh people earn their livelihood from fishing and allied activities such as drying, processing, packaging, exporting and transporting fisheries.The state alone yields 6.75 lakh tonnes of fish every year

=== Inland water transport in Kerala ===
Kerala, with numerous backwaters, is one of the States in India, where waterways are successfully used for commercial Inland Water Transport. The transportation is mainly done with country craft and passenger vessels. There are 41 navigable rivers in Kerala. The total length of the Inland Waterways in the State is 1687&nbsp;km. The main constraints to the expansion of Inland Water transport in the State are lack of depth in the waterway caused by silting, lack of maintenance of navigation system and bank protection, accelerated growth of the water hyacinth, lack of modern inland craft terminals and cargo handling system.
A 205&nbsp;km canal, [[National Waterway 3 (India)|National Waterway 3]], runs between Kottapuram and Kollam.<ref>[http://iwai.gov.in/waterwaysnw3.html Inland Waterways Authority of India website]</ref>

Education in Kerala has been promoted during British rule in India by Catholic and Christian missionaries who were keen on providing education to all sections of society and strengthening of women, without any kind of discrimination. The contributions of Catholic priests and nuns are very crucial and has played a major role in educating women and people belonging to lower strata of society surpassing many social hurdles. A significant figure in the 19th century was Rev.fr.[[Kuriakose Elias Chavara]] who started a system called "A school along with every church" to make education available for both poor and rich which still continues in the present.His work has resulted in promoting education for girls and is notable for becoming a good model for educational system in kerala after independence.Kerala's high literacy rate is attributed to high girl literacy rate as it says when a woman is educated she will make sure that her children are well educated.

Kerala has the highest literacy rate among the states of India. State topped the Education Development Index (EDI) among 21 major states in India in year 2006<U+2013>2007.<ref>{{Cite news|author=D Suresh Kumar |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Kerala_tops_primary_education_index/articleshow/3587924.cms |title=Kerala tops primary education index |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=13 October 2008 |accessdate=30 July 2009}}</ref>

More than 94% of the rural population has access to primary school within 1&nbsp;km, while 98% of population benefits one school within a distance of 2&nbsp;km.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
An upper primary school within a distance of 3&nbsp;km is available for more than 96% of the people, whose 98% benefit the facility for secondary education within 8&nbsp;km. The access for rural students to higher educational institutions in cities is facilitated by widely subsidised transport fares.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Kerala's educational system has been developed by institutions owned or aided by the government.In the educational system prevailed in the state schooling is for 10 years which is subdivided into lower primary, upper primary and high school, After 10 years of secondary schooling, students typically enroll in [[Junior college|Higher Secondary Schooling]] in one of the three major streams<U+2014>[[liberal arts]], [[commerce]] or science.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Upon completing the required coursework, students can enroll in general or professional under graduate programmes.

Schools and colleges are run by the government, private trusts, or individuals. Many of the schools owned by private sector are aided by government. Majority of the public schools are affiliated to [[Kerala State Education Board]]. Other familiar educational boards are [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]] (ICSE), the [[CBSE|Central Board for Secondary Education]] (CBSE), or the [[NIOS|National Institute of Open Schooling]] (NIOS). English is the language of instruction in most self financing schools, while government and government aided schools offer English or Malayalam{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

No fees (or a nominal fees) are required in schools run by or aided by government.
Fees concerning the higher and technical education are very low; the ratio of recovery of government's revenue expenditure was 2.6% in 2006<U+2013>2007.<ref>Najith Kumar, K.K. George, "Kerala's education system: from inclusion to exclusion", [[Economic and Political Weekly]], 10 October 2009, VOL XLIV, NO 41, page 55</ref> However, the lacking of fees or low fees does not imply low educational cost, as the students incur other costs of several types (examination fees, special fees, material costs, clothing travelling, private tuition). In fact, according to the 61st round of National Sample Survey (2004<U+2013>2005), per capita spending on education by the rural households resulted to be more than twice the national average ({{Indian Rupee}} 41 for Kerala, {{Indian Rupee}} 18 for India).Urban India spending, on the contrary, resulted to be greater than Kerala's ({{Indian Rupee}} 74 for India, {{Indian Rupee}} 66 for Kerala). However, the survey reveals that the rural-urban difference in expenditure on education by households was much less in Kerala than in the rest of India.<ref>Najith Kumar, K.K. George, "Kerala's education system: from inclusion to exclusion", Economic and Political Weekly, 10 October 2009, VOL XLIV, NO 41, page 56</ref>

A few universities in Kerala are [[Kannur University]], [[Mahatma Gandhi University]], [[University of Calicut]], [[University of Kerala]], [[Cochin University of Science and Technology]], [[Kerala Agricultural University]], [[Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit]].<ref>{{cite web|date=|author=|url=http://www.kerala.gov.in/education/high.htm|title=Higher Education|accessdate=2011-10-03}}</ref> Premiere educational institutions in Kerala are [[Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode]], one of the thirteen [[Indian Institutes of Management]], [[National Institute of Technology Calicut]] (NITC), [[Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram|Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology]] (IIST). Kerala also has a National law school which is known as the [[National University of Advanced Legal Studies]].

The [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries. In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts including results<U+2014>series expansion for trigonometric functions.

''Kathakali'' and ''Mohiniattam'' are widely recognized Indian Classical Dance traditions from Kerala.

Other forms of art are more religious or tribal in nature. These include ''[[chavittu nadakom]]'' and ''[[oppana]]'' which combines dance, rhythmic hand clapping, and ''ishal'' vocalisations. ''[[Margam Kali]]'' is a traditional group dance form traceable back to 17th century, originally performed during [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christian]] festivals.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/04/29/stories/2011042950750200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Preserving the purity of Margamkali | date=29 April 2011}}</ref> However, many of these art forms are largely performed for tourists or at youth festivals, and are not as popular among most Keralites. Contemporary art and performance styles including those employing mimicry and parody are more popular.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Music of Kerala|Kerala's music]] also has ancient{{Weasel-inline|date=May 2011}} roots. [[Carnatic music]] dominates Keralite traditional music. This was the result of [[Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma]]'s popularisation of the genre in the 19th century.<ref name="Bhagyalekshmy_2004d_29">{{harvnb|Bhagyalekshmy|2004d|p=29}}.</ref><ref name="Bhagyalekshmy_2004d_32">{{harvnb|Bhagyalekshmy|2004d|p=32}}.</ref> Raga-based renditions known as ''sopanam'' accompany ''kathakali'' performances. ''Melam'' (including the ''paandi'' and ''panchari'' variants) is a more percussive style of music; it is performed at ''[[mandir|Kshetram]]'' centered festivals using the ''[[chenda]]''. ''Melam'' ensembles comprise up to 150 musicians, and performances may last up to four hours. ''Panchavadyam'' is a different form of percussion ensemble, in which up to 100 artists use five types of percussion instrument. Kerala has various styles of folk and tribal music. The popular music of Kerala is dominated by the ''[[filmi]]'' music of [[Indian cinema]]. Kerala's visual arts range from [[Murals of Kerala|traditional murals]] to the works of [[Raja Ravi Varma]], the state's most renowned painter.

Kolla Varsham or Malayalam Era, which is assumed to have been established by King Udaya Marthanda Varma in 825 CE, serves as the official calendar of Kerala.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerala.gov.in/disttourism/klm.htm |title=Official website |publisher=kerala.gov.in |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> The [[Malayalam calendar]] is used to plan agricultural and religious activities. Kerala's most popular dish is ''[[Rice and curry]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''[[sadhya]]'' (feast) is traditionally served on green banana leaves. Such dishes as ''[[idli]]'', ''[[payasam]]'', ''pulisherry'', ''puttukadala'', or PuttuPayarPappadam, ''puzhukku'', ''[[rasam]]'', and ''[[sambar (dish)|sambar]]'' are typical. Keralites<U+2014>both men and women alike<U+2014>traditionally don flowing and unstitched garments. These include the ''[[mundu]]'', a loose piece of cloth wrapped around men's waists. Women typically wear the ''[[sari]]'', a long and elaborately wrapped banner of cloth, wearable in various styles. Presently, North Indian dresses such as [[Salwar kameez]] are also popular among women in Kerala.

[[elephants in Kerala culture|Elephants]] are an integral part of daily life in Kerala.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} [[Indian elephant]]s are loved, revered, groomed and given a prestigious place in the state's culture. They are often referred to as {{By whom|date=May 2011}} the 'sons of the ''[[sahyadri|sahya]]''.' Elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the [[Government of Kerala]].

[[Malayalam literature]] is medieval in origin and includes such figures as the 14th century [[Niranam poets]] (Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar), and the 17th century poet [[Ezhuthachan|Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan]] whose works mark the dawn of both modern Malayalam language and indigenous Keralite poetry.  [[Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar]] and [[Kerala Varma Valiakoi Thampuran]] are noted for their contribution to Malayalam prose. The "[[triumvirate poets of modern malayalam|triumvirate of poets]]" (''Kavithrayam''), [[Kumaran Asan]], [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]], and [[Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer]], are recognised for moving Keralite poetry away from archaic sophistry and metaphysics, and towards a more [[lyrics|lyrical]] mode.

In the second half of the 20th century, [[Jnanpith]] awardees like [[G. Sankara Kurup]], [[S. K. Pottekkatt]], [[Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai]], [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]] and [[O. N. V.
