'''''Myrica''''' is a genus of about 35-50 species of small [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s in the family Myricaceae, order Fagales. The genus has a wide distribution, including [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[South America]], and missing only from [[Australasia]]. Some [[botanist]]s split the genus into two genera on the basis of the catkin and fruit structure, restricting ''Myrica'' to a few species, and treating the others in ''Morella''.

Common names include '''Bayberry''', '''Bay-rum tree''', '''Candleberry''', '''Sweet Gale''' and '''Wax-myrtle'''.

The species vary from 1 m shrubs up to 20 m trees; some are [[deciduous]], but the majority of species are [[evergreen]]. The [[root]]s have [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacterium|bacteria]] which enable the plants to grow on soils that are very poor in [[nitrogen]] content. The [[leaf|leaves]] are spirally arranged, simple, 2-12 cm long, oblanceolate with a tapered base and broader tip, and a crinkled or finely toothed margin. The [[flower]]s are [[catkin]]s, with male and female catkins usually on separate plants ([[plant sexuality|dioecious]]). The [[fruit]] is a small [[drupe]], usually with a [[wax]] coating.

The type species, ''Myrica gale'', is [[holarctic]] in distribution, growing in [[acid]]ic [[peat]] [[bog]]s throughout the colder parts of the Northern Hemisphere; it is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 m tall. The remaining species all have relatively small ranges, and are mostly warm-temperate. 

''Myrica faya'', native to the [[volcano|volcanic]] islands of [[Madeira]] and the [[Canary Islands]], has become an [[invasive species]] on the [[Hawaii]]an volcanoes where it was introduced in the 19th century; its ability to fix nitrogen makes it very well adapted to growing on low-nitrogen volcanic soils.

The wax coating on the fruit is indigestible for most [[bird]]s, but a few species have adapted to be able to eat it, notably the [[Yellow-rumped Warbler]] in North America. As the wax is very energy-rich, this enables the Yellow-rumped Warbler to winter further north in colder climates than any other American warbler if bayberries are present. The [[seed]]s are then dispersed in the birds' droppings. ''Myrica'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including [[Brown-tail]], [[Emperor Moth]] and [[Winter Moth]] as well as the [[Bucculatricidae|bucculatricid]] leaf-miners ''Bucculatrix cidarella'', ''Bucculatrix myricae'' (feeds exclusively on ''Myrica gale'') and ''Bucculatrix paroptila'' and the ''[[Coleophora]]'' case-bearers ''C. comptoniella'', ''C. pruniella'' and ''C. viminetella''.

===Uses===
The wax coating on the fruit of several species, known as [[Bayberry wax]], was used in the past to make [[candle]]s. The foliage of ''Myrica gale'' is a traditional [[insect]] repellant, used by [[camping|campers]] to keep biting insects out of [[tent]]s. Several species are also grown as ornamental plants in [[garden]]s.  The fruit of ''[[Myrica rubra]]'' is an economically important crop in [[China]]. Myrica is used to spice [[beer]] and [[snaps]] in [[Denmark]]. The [[Swiss Family Robinson]] used them to make [[candle]]s.
