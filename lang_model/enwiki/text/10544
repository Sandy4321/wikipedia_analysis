The '''plebs''' was the general body of free [[Land tenure|land-owning]] [[Roman citizens]] (as distinguished from [[slave]]s and the [[capite censi]]) in [[Ancient Rome]]. Members of the plebs were also distinct from the higher order of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]s. A member of the ''plebs'' was known as a '''plebeian''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|p|l|<U+026A>-|<U+02C8>|b|i<U+02D0>|<U+0259>|n}}; {{lang-la|plebeius}}). This term is used today to refer to one who is or appears to be of the middle or lower order; however, in Rome plebeians could become quite wealthy and influential. In fact, [[Nero]], a Roman emperor, was born a "pleb". His success was not uncommon and approximately 30% of Roman emperors were "plebs".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Plebs in ancient Rome ==

In Latin the word ''plebs'' is a [[grammatical number|singular]] [[collective noun]], and its [[genitive]] is ''plebis''. Multiple "plebs" are "plebes".

The origin of the separation into orders is unclear, and it is disputed whether the Romans were divided under the early kings into patricians and plebeians, or whether the ''clientes'' (or dependents) of the patricians formed a third group. The nineteenth century historian  [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] held that plebeians began to appear at Rome during the reign of [[Ancus Marcius]], possibly foreigners settling in Rome as naturalized citizens. In any case, at the outset of the [[Roman Republic]], plebeians were excluded from magistracies and religious colleges. Later on, after a general strike by the plebeians{{fact|date=December 2011}}, the Law of the [[Twelve Tables]] was promulgated, and explicitly forbade intermarriage in Tabula XI (a prohibition which was eventually reversed by the [[Lex Canuleia]]). However, before the Twelve Tables plebeians were forbidden to know any laws, but were still punished for breaking them. Despite these inequalities, plebeians still belonged to ''[[Gens|gentes]]'', served in the army, but very rarely became military leaders.

Even so, the "[[Conflict of the Orders]]" over the political status of the plebeians went on for the first two centuries of the Republic, ending with the formal equality of plebeians and patricians in [[287 BC|287&nbsp;BC]]. The plebeians achieved this by developing their own organizations (the ''[[concilium plebis]]''), leaders (the [[tribune]]s and plebeian [[aedile]]s). When the plebeians felt the situation had become dire, they would instigate a ''[[Secessio|secessio plebis]]'', a sort of general strike where plebeians would leave Rome, leaving the patricians to themselves.

==Modern usage==
In Great Britain, Canada, France, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and South African English ''pleb'' is a [[back-formation]], in Dutch it is ''plebs''; a derogatory term for someone thought of as inferior, common or ignorant. The term is often, though not always, synonymous with [[Proletariat|prole]].

==Use in education==

Early [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] in the United Kingdom would enroll pupils as "plebeians" as opposed to sons of gentry and aristocrats.

''Plebes'' may refer to [[freshman|freshmen]] at the [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]], [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]],  [[Valley Forge Military Academy]], the [[Marine Military Academy]], the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|U.S. Merchant Marine Academy]], [[Georgia Military College]], [[California Maritime Academy]] and the Philippine Military Academy.
