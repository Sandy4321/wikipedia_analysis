'''U2''' are <!-- ("They are") Please note that British English uses the plural "are" instead of the Americanised singular "is" -->a [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Dublin]], Ireland.<!-- DO NOT SAY THAT THEY ARE AN IRISH BAND. Not every member was born in Ireland. Saying the band is from Ireland gets the same point across and is more accurate. Do not change without consensus on the talk page. --> The group consists of [[Bono]] (vocals and guitar), [[The Edge]] (guitar, keyboards, and vocals), [[Adam Clayton]] (bass guitar), and [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] (drums and percussion). The band formed at Mount Temple secondary school in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed to [[Island Records]] and released their debut album ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]''. By the mid-1980s, they had become a top international act. They were more successful as a live act than they were at selling records, until their 1987 album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'',<ref>{{cite video | people =[[Paul McGuinness]] | title =Classic Albums: The Joshua Tree | medium =Television documentary | publisher =Rajon Vision |date=1998}}</ref> which, according to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', elevated the band's stature "from heroes to superstars".<ref name="RS_xx">Gardner (1994), p. xx</ref>

Their 1991 album ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' and the accompanying [[Zoo TV Tour]] were a musical and thematic reinvention for the band. Reacting to their own sense of musical stagnation and a late-1980s critical backlash, U2 incorporated [[Electronic dance music|dance music]] and [[alternative rock]] influences into their sound and performances, abandoning their earnest image for a more ironic, self-deprecating tone. Similar experimentation continued for the remainder of the 1990s. Since 2000, U2 have pursued a more conventional sound, while maintaining influences from their earlier musical explorations.

U2 have released 12 studio albums and are among the most critically and [[List of best-selling music artists|commercially successful]] groups in popular music.

[[Image:U2-teenagers.jpg|thumb|U2 in 1980. Shown from left to right: Clayton, Mullen, Bono, The Edge.]]
The band formed in Dublin on 25 September 1976.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 27</ref> <!--as an Irish topic, under Wikipedia rules this article uses international dating, i.e., dd/mm/yyyy not American dating mm/dd/yyyy.--> [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]], then 14 years old, posted a notice on his secondary school ([[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]]) notice board in search of musicians for a new band. Setting up in his kitchen, Mullen later described it as "'The Larry Mullen Band' for about ten minutes, then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge." Mullen was on drums, [[Bono|Paul Hewson (Bono)]] on lead vocals, [[The Edge|Dave Evans (The Edge)]] and his older brother [[Dik Evans]] on guitar, [[Adam Clayton]], a friend of the Evans brothers on bass guitar, and initially Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin, two other friends of Mullen.<ref>Chatterton (2001), p. 130</ref> Soon after, the group settled on the name "Feedback", because it was one of the few technical terms they knew.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 30</ref> Martin did not return after the first practice, and McCormick left the group within a few weeks. Most of the group's material initially consisted of cover versions, which the band said was not their fort<U+00E9>.<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 35, 40</ref> The band's early original material was influenced by [[punk rock]] acts, such as [[The Jam]], [[The Clash]], and [[The Sex Pistols]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In March 1977, the band changed their name to "The Hype".<ref>de la Parra (2003), p. 6</ref> Dik Evans, who was older and by this time at college, was becoming the odd man out. The rest of the band was leaning towards the idea of a four-piece ensemble and he was "phased out" in March 1978. During a farewell concert in the Presbyterian Church Hall in [[Howth]], which featured The Hype playing covers, Dik ceremoniously walked offstage. The remaining four band members completed the concert playing original material as "U2".<ref name="U2_by_U2_46-48">McCormick (2006), pp. 46<U+2013>48</ref> Steve Averill, a punk rock musician and family friend of Clayton's, had suggested six potential names from which the band chose "U2" for its ambiguity and open-ended interpretations, and because it was the name that they disliked the least.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 44</ref>

On [[Saint Patrick's Day]] in 1978, U2 won a talent show in [[Limerick|Limerick, Ireland]]. The prize consisted of <U+00A3>500 and studio time to record a demo which would be heard by CBS Ireland. This win was an important milestone and affirmation for the fledgling band.<ref name="U2_by_U2_46-48"/> The band recorded their first demo tape at Keystone Studios in Dublin, in May 1978.<ref name="Bono">Wall (2005), p. 45</ref> ''[[Hot Press]]'' magazine was influential in shaping the band's future; in May, [[Paul McGuinness]], who had earlier been introduced to the band by the magazine's journalist Bill Graham, agreed to be U2's [[band manager|manager]].<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 53<U+2013>56</ref> U2's first release, an Ireland-only EP entitled ''[[Three (EP)|Three]]'', was released in September 1979 and was the band's first Irish chart success.<ref>de la Parra (2003), p. 8</ref> In December 1979, U2 performed in London for their first shows outside Ireland, although they failed to get much attention from audiences or critics.<ref>de la Parra (2003), p. 10</ref> In February 1980, their second single "[[Another Day (U2 song)|Another Day]]" was released on the CBS label, but again only for the Irish market.<ref>Stokes (1996), p. 142; McCormick (2006), p. 88</ref>

=== ''Boy'', ''October'', and ''War'' (1980<U+2013>83) ===
[[Island Records]] signed U2 in March 1980, and in May, the band released "[[11 O'Clock Tick Tock]]" as their first international single.<ref>Stokes (1996), p. 142</ref> The band's debut album, ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]'', followed in October.

The band's second album, ''[[October (album)|October]],'' was released in 1981 and contained overtly spiritual themes.

(McCormick (2006), p. 151)</ref>

''The Unforgettable Fire'' has a rich and orchestrated sound.

Stung by the criticism of ''Rattle and Hum'', the band made a calculated change in musical and thematic direction for their seventh studio album, ''[[Achtung Baby]]''; the shift was one of their most dramatic since ''The Unforgettable Fire''.<ref>Flanagan (1995), pp. 4<U+2013>6; Graham (2004), p. 43</ref> They began work on the album in East Berlin in October 1990 with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, seeking inspiration on the eve of [[German reunification]].<ref>Flanagan (1995), p. 7</ref> The sessions instead proved to be difficult, as conflict arose within the group over their musical direction and the quality of their material. While Clayton and Mullen preferred a sound similar to U2's previous work, Bono and Edge were inspired by [[alternative rock]] and European [[electronic dance music|dance music]] and advocated a change. Weeks of slow progress, arguments, and tension subsided when the band rallied around a chord progression The Edge had composed to improvise the song "[[One (U2 song)|One]]".<ref>Flanagan (1995), pp. 6<U+2013>11</ref> They completed the album in 1991 in Dublin.

In November 1991, U2 released ''Achtung Baby''. Sonically, it incorporated alternative rock, dance, and [[industrial music|industrial]] influences of the time, and the band referred the album's musical departure as "four men chopping down the Joshua Tree".<ref name="ach-stations">{{cite magazine | title = Achtung Stations (Part 1) | magazine = [[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] | first = Stephen | last = Dalton | date = 26 October 2004}}</ref> Thematically, it was a more inward-looking and personal record; it was darker, yet at times more flippant than the band's previous work. Commercially and critically, it has been one of the band's most successful albums. It produced the hit singles "[[The Fly (U2 song)|The Fly]]", "[[Mysterious Ways (song)|Mysterious Ways]]", and "One", and it was a crucial part of the band's early 1990s reinvention.<ref>Graham (2004), p. 44</ref> Like ''The Joshua Tree'', many publications have cited the record as one of rock's greatest.<ref name="500Greatest"/>

The [[Zoo TV Tour]] of 1992<U+2013>1993 was a [[multimedia]] event and showcased an extravagant but intentionally bewildering array of dozens of video screens, upside-down flying [[Trabant]] cars, mock transmission towers, [[satellite television|satellite TV]] links, and [[subliminal message]]s. Bono featured several over-the-top stage characters, such as "The Fly", "Mirror-Ball Man", and "Mr. MacPhisto", in live performances. The extravagant shows were intentionally in contrast to the austere staging of previous U2 tours and mocked the excesses of rock and roll by appearing to embrace these very excesses. The shows were, in part, U2's way to represent the pervasive nature of cable television and its blurring of news, entertainment, and home shopping.<ref>de la Parra (2003), pp. 139<U+2013>141; Flanagan (1995), pp. 12, 13, 58<U+2013>61; Stokes (1996), pp. 110<U+2013>111</ref> Prank phone calls were made to [[George H. W. Bush|President Bush]], the United Nations, and others. Live satellite uplinks to war-torn [[Sarajevo]] caused controversy.<ref>de la Parra (2003), pp. 153, 166</ref>

Quickly recorded during a break in the Zoo TV tour in mid-1993, the ''[[Zooropa]]'' album continued many of the themes from ''Achtung Baby'' and the Zoo TV Tour. Initially intended as an [[Extended play|EP]], the band expanded ''Zooropa'' into a full-length [[LP album]]. It was an even greater departure from the style of their earlier recordings, incorporating [[techno]] influences and other electronic effects.<ref>Graham (2004), p. 51</ref> [[Johnny Cash]] sang the vocal on "[[The Wanderer (U2 song)|The Wanderer]]". Most of the songs were played at least once during the 1993 leg of the tour, which extended through Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan; half the album's tracks became fixtures in the setlist.<ref>de la Parra (2003), pp. 166<U+2013>172</ref>

=== Passengers, ''Pop'', and PopMart (1994<U+2013>99) ===
In 1995, U2 released an [[experimental music|experimental]] album called ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]''. Brian Eno, producer of three previous U2 albums, contributed as a full partner, including writing and performing. For this reason and due to the record's highly experimental nature, the band chose to release it under the moniker "Passengers" to distinguish it from U2's conventional albums. Mullen said of the album, "There's a thin line between interesting music and self-indulgence. We crossed it on the Passengers record."<ref>{{cite newspaper | title = Eno, U2 Make An 'Original' | newspaper = [[Boston Globe]] | first = Jim | last = Sullivan | date = 7 November 1995}}</ref> It was commercially unnoticed by U2 standards and it received generally poor reviews. However, the single "[[Miss Sarajevo]]" featuring [[Luciano Pavarotti]], which Bono cites as one of his favourite U2 songs,<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 261<U+2013>262</ref> was successful.

The subsequent tour, [[PopMart Tour|PopMart]], commenced in April 1997. Like Zoo TV, it poked fun at pop culture and was intended to send a sarcastic message to those accusing U2 of commercialism.

Bono has nurtured his [[falsetto]] operatic voice<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atu2.com/news/column-off-the-record-vol-6-201.html|first=Marylinn|last=Maione|date=12 February 2006|title=Column: off the record..., vol. 6<U+2013>201|publisher=atu2.com|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> and has exhibited a notable lyrical bent towards social, political, and personal subject matter while maintaining a grandiose scale in his songwriting. In addition, The Edge has described U2 as a fundamentally live band.<ref name="MU_MAG"/>

Despite these broad consistencies, U2 have introduced brand new elements into their musical repertoire with each new album. U2's early sound was influenced by bands such as [[Television (band)|Television]] and [[Joy Division]], and has been described as containing a "sense of exhilaration" that resulted from The Edge's "radiant chords" and Bono's "ardent vocals".<ref>Reynolds (2006), p. 368</ref> U2's sound began with [[post-punk]] roots and minimalistic and uncomplicated instrumentals heard on ''Boy'' and ''October'', but evolved through ''War'' to include aspects of rock anthem, funk, and dance rhythms to become more versatile and aggressive.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Review: War|magazine=Rolling Stone|first=J.D.|last=Considine|date=20 January 1983| issue=387}}</ref> ''Boy'' and ''War'' were labelled "muscular and assertive" by ''Rolling Stone'',<ref name="RS_JT"/> influenced in large part by Lillywhite's producing. ''The Unforgettable Fire'', which began with the Edge playing more keyboards than guitars, as well as follow-up ''The Joshua Tree'', had [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]] at the production helm. With their influence, both albums achieved a "diverse texture".<ref name="RS_JT"/> The songs from ''The Joshua Tree'' and ''Rattle and Hum'' placed more emphasis on Lanois-inspired rhythm as they mixed distinct and varied styles of gospel and blues music, which stemmed from the band's burgeoning fascination with America's culture, people and places. In the 1990s, U2 reinvented themselves as they began using synthesisers, [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]], and [[electronica|electronic]] beats derived from [[alternative rock]], [[industrial music]], [[electronic dance music|dance]], and [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] on ''Achtung Baby'',<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Review: Achtung Baby |magazine=Rolling Stone |first=Elysa |last=Gardner |date=9 January 1992|issue=921}}</ref> ''Zooropa'', and ''Pop''.<ref name="NYT_POP">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/28/arts/under-a-golden-arch-sincerely-u2.html|title=Under A Golden Arch, Sincerely U2|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|first=Jon|last=Pareles|authorlink=Jon Pareles|date=28 April 1997|accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> The 2000s had U2 returning to a stripped-down sound, with a more traditional rhythm and less obvious use of synthesisers and effects.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

=== Lyrics and themes ===
Social and political commentary, often embellished with Christian and spiritual imagery,<ref name="lyrics">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/arts/music/14pare.html?scp=1&sq=U2:%20The%20Catharsis%20in%20the%20Cathedral|title=U2: The Catharsis in the Cathedral|first=Jon|last=Pareles|authorlink=Jon Pareles|date=14 November 2004|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=17 August 2007}}</ref> are a major aspect of U2's lyrical content. Songs such as "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]", "Silver and Gold", and "Mothers of the Disappeared" were motivated by current events of the time. The former was written about [[The Troubles|the troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]],<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 135, 139</ref> while the latter concerns the struggle of COMADRES<U+2014>the Mothers of the Disappeared<U+2014>a group of women whose children were killed or "disappeared" by the government during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].<ref>McGee (2008), p. 98</ref>

Bono's personal conflicts and turmoil inspired family colour songs like "[[Mofo (song)|Mofo]]", "[[Tomorrow (U2 song)|Tomorrow]]" and "[[Kite (song)|Kite]]". An emotional yearning or pleading frequently appears as a lyrical theme,<ref name="ABOUT_TOP10"/> in tracks such as "[[Yahweh (song)|Yahweh]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/u2/reviews/400|title=U2&nbsp;<U+2013> How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb Review|work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|accessdate=18 February 2007}}</ref> "[[Peace on Earth (U2 song)|Peace on Earth]]", and "[[Please (U2 song)|Please]]". Much of U2's songwriting and music is also motivated by contemplations of loss and anguish, coupled with hopefulness and resiliency, themes that are central to ''The Joshua Tree''.<ref name="RS_JT"/> Some of these lyrical ideas have been amplified by Bono and the band's personal experiences during their youth in Ireland, as well as Bono's campaigning and activism later in his life. U2 have used tours such as [[Zoo TV Tour|Zoo TV]] and [[PopMart Tour|PopMart]] to caricature social trends, such as media overload and consumerism, respectively.<ref name="NYT_POP"/>

While the band and its fans often affirm the political nature of their music, U2's lyrics and music have been criticised as apolitical because of their vagueness and "fuzzy imagery", and a lack of any specific references to actual people or characters.<ref>{{cite web|title=The soaring nothingness of U2|author=Plotz, David|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2061087/|date=25 January 2002|work=Slate|accessdate=19 January 2008}}</ref>

Since the early 1980s, the members of U2<U+2014>as a band and individually<U+2014>have collaborated with other musicians, artists, celebrities, and politicians to address issues concerning poverty, disease, and social injustice.

In 1984, Bono and Adam Clayton participated in [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] to raise money for [[Ethiopia]]n famine relief. This initiative produced the hit charity single "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]", which would be the first among several collaborations between U2 and [[Bob Geldof]]. In July 1985, U2 played [[Live Aid]], a follow-up to Band Aid's efforts. Bono and his wife Ali, invited by [[World Vision]], later visited Ethiopia where they witnessed the famine first hand. Bono would later say this laid the groundwork for his Africa campaigning and some of his songwriting.<ref>Tyrangiel, Josh (4 March 2002). [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001931-2,00.html Bono.] ''Time''. Retrieved 16 January 2007; McCormick (2006), p. 289</ref>

In 1986, U2 participated in the [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] tour in support of [[Amnesty International]] and in [[Self Aid]] for unemployment in Ireland. The same year, Bono and Ali Hewson also visited [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]] at the invitation of the [[Sanctuary movement]], and saw the effects of the [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador Civil War]]. These 1986 events greatly influenced ''The Joshua Tree'' album, which was being recorded at the time.

In 1992, the band participated in the "Stop [[Sellafield]]" concert with [[Greenpeace]] during their Zoo TV tour.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 238</ref> Events in Sarajevo during the [[War in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian war]] inspired the song "[[Miss Sarajevo]]", which premiered at a September 1995 [[Luciano Pavarotti|Pavarotti]] and Friends show, and which Bono and the Edge performed at [[War Child (charity)|War Child]].<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 262</ref> A promise made in 1993 was kept when the band played in Sarajevo as part of 1997's PopMart Tour.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 277</ref> In 1998, they performed in [[Belfast]] days prior to the vote on the [[Belfast Agreement|Good Friday Agreement]], bringing [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] political leaders [[David Trimble, Baron Trimble|David Trimble]] and [[John Hume]] on stage to promote the agreement.<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 285<U+2013>286</ref> Later that year, all proceeds from the release of the "[[Sweetest Thing]]" single went towards supporting the [[Chernobyl Children's Project International|Chernobyl Children's Project]].

In 2001, the band dedicated "[[Walk On (song)|Walk On]]" to [[Burma|Burma's]] pro-democracy leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 295<U+2013>296</ref> In late 2003, Bono and the Edge participated in the South Africa HIV/AIDS awareness [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] series of concerts hosted by [[Nelson Mandela]]. The band played 2005's [[Live 8]] concert in London. The band and manager Paul McGuinness were awarded [[Amnesty International]]'s [[Ambassador of Conscience Award]] for their work in promoting human rights.<ref>[http://www.artforamnesty.org/aoc/events_2005.html Ambassador of Conscience Award: 2005 Award Ceremony.] artforamnesty.org.

Since 2000, Bono's campaigning has included [[Jubilee 2000]] with Bob Geldof, [[Muhammad Ali]], and others to promote the cancellation of third world debt during the [[Great Jubilee]]. In January 2002, Bono co-founded the multinational NGO, [[DATA]], with the aim of improving the social, political, and financial state of Africa. He continued his campaigns for debt and HIV/AIDS relief into June 2002 by making high-profile visits to Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/05/24/bono.africa.cnna/index.html|title=CNN Access: Bono backs 'effective aid' for Africa|work=[[CNN.com]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]], Inc.|first=Aaron|last=Brown|date=24 May 2002|accessdate=18 June 2010}}; [http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/africa/05/30/Bono.oneill.kagan.otsc/index.html Bono and O'Neill in Africa: Summing up the trip] CNN.com.

[[Product Red]], a 2006 for-profit brand seeking to raise money for the [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|Global Fund]], was founded, in part, by Bono. The [[ONE Campaign]], originally the US counterpart of [[Make Poverty History]], was shaped by his efforts and vision. In 2007 the [[ONE Campaign]] and [[DATA]] merged into a single organisation, ONE, with Bono a member of the merged organisation's board of directors.

In late 2005, following [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]], The Edge helped introduce [[Music Rising]], an initiative to raise funds for musicians who lost their instruments in the storm-ravaged [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]].<ref>[http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/001351.html The Edge (U2) Announces 'Music Rising', a Campaign to Aid Musicians Affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita] modernguitars.com.

U2 and Bono's social activism have not been without its critics however. Several authors and activists who publish in politically left journals such as [[CounterPunch]] have decried Bono's support of political figures such as [[Paul Wolfowitz]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/okeefe03232005.html | author = O'Keefe, Derrick | title = The Empire Moves and Co-opts in Mysterious Ways | work =CounterPunch|date = 23 March 2005| accessdate = 19 January 2008}}</ref> as well as his "essential paternalism".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/browne05162006.html | author = Browne, Harry | title = RED Light District: Bono's Independent | work =CounterPunch|date = 16 May 2006| accessdate = 19 January 2008}}</ref> Other news sources have more generally questioned the efficacy of Bono's campaign to [[debt relief|relieve debt]] and provide assistance to Africa.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abcnews.go.com/2020/Story?id=1955664&page=4 | title = Will More Foreign Aid End Global Poverty? | author = Stossel, John and Patrick McMenamin | date = 12 May 2006|accessdate = 19 January 2008}}; and {{cite web | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article783901.ece | title = Bono aid is making Africa sick | accessdate = 19 January 2008|work=The Sunday Times|date=1 January 2006}}</ref> Tax and development campaigners have also criticised the band's move from Ireland to the Netherlands to reduce its tax bill.<ref>Richard Murphy, "Bono's Choice", http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2006/08/20/100/</ref>

== Other projects ==
The members of U2 have undertaken a number of side projects, sometimes in collaboration with some of their bandmates. In 1985, Bono recorded the song "[[In a Lifetime]]" with the Irish band [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]]. The Edge recorded a solo soundtrack album for the film ''[[Captive Soundtrack|Captive]]'' in 1986,<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 169</ref> which included a vocal performance by [[Sin<U+00E9>ad O'Connor]] that predates her own debut album by a year.
