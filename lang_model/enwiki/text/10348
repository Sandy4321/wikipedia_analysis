The '''[[Ship prefix|M/V]] ''New Carissa''''' was a [[Cargo ship|freighter]] that ran aground on a [[beach]] near [[Coos Bay, Oregon|Coos Bay]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]], during a storm in [[February 1999]], and subsequently broke apart. An attempt to tow the [[bow (ship)|bow]] section of the ship out to sea failed when the tow line broke, and the bow was grounded again. Eventually, the bow was successfully towed out to sea and sunk. The [[stern]] section remains on the beach near Coos Bay. Fuel on board the ship was burned off ''[[in situ]]'', but a significant amount was also [[oil spill|spilled]] from the wreckage, causing [[ecology|ecological]] damage to the [[coast]]line.

The [[United States Coast Guard]] performed an investigation and found that [[Captain (nautical)|captain]]'s error was the main cause of the wreck; however, no [[criminal law|criminal]] [[liability]] was established and the captain and [[Seafarer's professions and ranks|crew]] were not charged. There were significant legal and financial consequences for the ship's owners and insurer.

There are plans in place to [[ship breaking|dismantle]] the stern section at its current site and remove it from the beach.

==Vessel==
The '''''New Carissa''''' was a [[Panama]]nian-[[flag of convenience|flagged]] dry [[cargo ship|bulk freighter]] optimized for carriage of wood chips owned by the [[Japan]]ese shipping concern [[Nippon Yusen Kaisha]] via a subsidiary, Green Atlas Shipping. The [[ship|vessel]] was built by [[Imabari]] Shipbuilding Co. in Japan using an all-[[steel]] construction, and was [[Glossary of nautical terms#G-L|laid down]] on [[August 30]] [[1989]]. The freighter was 195&nbsp;[[metre|meters]] (639&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) long and 32&nbsp;meters (106&nbsp;ft) wide, with a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of 10.8&nbsp;m&nbsp;(35.5&nbsp;ft) when fully loaded. It had a gross [[tonnage]] of 36,571&nbsp;tons, a net tonnage of 16,524&nbsp;tons, and was powered by an 8,200-[[Horsepower#Brake horsepower (bhp)|bhp]] direct-drive [[diesel engine]]. It had a maximum crew complement of 26 [[Merchant Navy|sailors]], and was in service hauling wood chips (used for [[wood pulp|paper pulp production]]). The ship's home port was [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], and its crew at the time of its grounding consisted entirely of Philippine nationals, commanded by Benjamin Morgado. The ship was insured by Shipowners Insurance and Guaranty Company Ltd. (SIGCo) of [[Hamilton, Bermuda]].<ref name="USCG report">

==Grounding==
[[Image:NewCarissaMap.jpeg|thumb|left|Incident map of the ''New Carissa'' wreck, [[February 14]] [[1999]]]]
On [[February 4]] [[1999]], the ''New Carissa'' was bound for the [[Port of Coos Bay]] to pick up a load of wood chips. The ship's crew was informed by the local [[bar pilot]]s that weather conditions would prevent the ship (which was empty at the time) from entering Coos Bay [[harbor]] until the next morning. The captain ordered the ship to drop [[anchor]] 1.7&nbsp;[[nautical mile]]s&nbsp;(3.1&nbsp;km) off the coast in order to ride out the storm. The crew used a single anchor to secure the ship, and according to a [[United States Coast Guard]] review of the incident, used a chain that was too short. The short chain and the weather conditions, including winds of 20-25&nbsp;[[knot (speed)|knot]]s&nbsp;(37&ndash;46&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]), caused the ship to drag its anchor. Poor navigational techniques and inadequate [[watchstanding|watchkeeping]] led to the crew's failure to notice that the ship was moving. Once movement was detected, the crew attempted to raise anchor and maneuver away from the shore, but the weather and sea conditions made this difficult. By the time the anchor was raised, the ship had been pushed too close to the shore to recover.<ref name="USCG report"/>

The ship ran aground on the beach 2.7&nbsp;[[mile|statute mile]]s (4.5&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) north of the entrance to [[Coos Bay]], and attempts to refloat it failed. Two of the five [[fuel tank]]s on the ship began to leak fuel onto the beach, eventually spilling approximately 70,000&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;[[gallon]]s&nbsp;(262,500&nbsp;[[litre|liters]]) of thick "bunker C" [[Fuel oil#Bunker fuel|fuel oil]] and [[diesel]] onto the beach and into the water.<ref>

Neither the captain nor any of the 22-man crew was injured in the incident.

==Rescue and recovery operations==
Recovery operations began immediately when the grounding was first reported by the ship's crew. Several factors combined to severely complicate the operation. A Unified Command for the operation, consisting of representatives from the Coast Guard, the [[Government of Oregon|State of Oregon]], and rescue party operations, was quickly established.

===Initial rescue attempts===
Initial rescue operations were hampered by inclement weather. Attempts to move the ''New Carissa'' under her own power failed, and [[tugboat]] assistance was not available immediately after the grounding. Only one tugboat was available locally, but it was unable to cross the Coos Bay [[Glossary of nautical terms#A-B|bar]] because of safety concerns. It was also uncertain whether or not the locally available tugboat could have successfully rescued the ''New Carissa''. The nearest [[marine salvage|salvage]] tugboat capable of towing a large ship off a beach, the ''Salvage Chief'', was moored at its home port of [[Astoria, Oregon]], 200&nbsp;statute&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(320&nbsp;km) to the north, a 24-hour journey away. The ''Salvage Chief'' had not sailed in over a year, and it took 18&nbsp;hours to fuel, provision, and find a crew for the ship. Once mobilized, poor weather in the Astoria area prevented the tugboat from crossing the treacherous [[Columbia Bar|Columbia River bar]] for an additional two days. The ''Salvage Chief'' did not arrive in the area until [[February 8]], four days after the grounding occurred.<ref name="DEQ">{{cite paper|

[[Image:Carissawhole.png|right|thumb|The ''New Carissa'', still intact shortly after running aground]]

Continued poor weather drove the ''New Carissa'' closer to the shore. Technical teams from two salvage contractors, Smit International and Salvage Master, had been working with the Coast Guard since [[February 5]] and had drawn up plans to attempt to refloat the vessel, but when cracks in the hull and oil leaks were observed on [[February 8]], any refloating attempts were precluded by the focus on preventing of a large-scale oil spill.<ref name="fws2">

accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> In addition, the ''Salvage Chief'', upon its arrival, was unable to reach the ''New Carissa'' with its tow gear. On [[February 10]], the ''New Carissa'' suffered major [[structural failure]] when the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] breached near the engine room, flooding the engines with seawater (and thus disabling them). The ship's insurers declared the vessel to be a total loss. As a result, the ''New Carissa'' was no longer a salvageable vessel; instead, it had effectively become a [[shipwreck]].<ref name="DEQ"/>

===Wreck recovery operations===
[[Image:Carissafire.PNG|left|thumb|The ''New Carissa'''s fuel tanks are ignited.]]
Since the vessel was no longer seaworthy and could not move under its own power, even if freed from the beach, the focus of the operation changed. Oil from the ship's fuel tanks continued to pose an [[Ecology#Ecological crisis|environmental hazard]], a situation exacerbated by both the ship's structural failure and continuing pounding from the [[ocean surface wave|surf]]. In order to mitigate the situation, the Unified Command decided to set the fuel tanks on fire in order to burn off the oil. The first attempt was made on [[February 10]]. [[Napalm]] and other [[incendiary device]]s were used to ignite the fuel, but only one of the diesel tanks was burned effectively. A second attempt was made on [[February 11]] when [[United States Navy|US Navy]] explosive experts placed 39 [[shaped charge]]s to breach the top of the fuel tanks from within the cargo holds. 2,280&nbsp;liters of napalm and nearly 180&nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] of [[plastic explosive]]s were also used to ignite the fuel on board. The ship burned for approximately 33&nbsp;hours.<ref name="fws2"/> Additional smaller-scale attempts were made to burn more oil over the next two days, with limited success. The total amount of oil that was burned is estimated to be between 165,000 and 255,000&nbsp;gallons (625,000-965,000&nbsp;liters).<ref name="fws2"/> The structural stress caused by the fire, combined with continued severe weather, caused the vessel to break into two sections around midnight on [[February 11]]. 
[[Image:Carissaburns.PNG|right|thumb|The ''New Carissa'''s fuel burns as a [[Common Seal|Harbor Seal]] looks on.]]
On [[March 2]], salvors managed to float the 440&ndash;foot&nbsp;(132&nbsp;m) bow section and tow it out to sea for disposal. The vessel with the bow section under tow encountered another storm 40&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(65&nbsp;km) off the coast, and the tow line broke. The bow section floated for fourteen hours until it ran aground near [[Waldport, Oregon]], approximately 80&nbsp;miles (130&nbsp;km) to the north of the original grounding site. One week later, on [[March 9]], the bow was again refloated and successfully towed by the tugboat ''Sea Victory'' 248&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(400&nbsp;km) off the coast, where the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] is approximately 10,000&nbsp;feet (3,000&nbsp;m) deep. It was sunk at that location by two US Navy ships, the [[destroyer]] [[USS David R. Ray  (DD-971)|USS ''David R. Ray'']] and the [[submarine]] [[USS Bremerton (SSN-698)|USS ''Bremerton'']]. 400&nbsp;pounds (180&nbsp;kg) of [[explosive material|high explosives]] were attached to the bow and detonated.<ref>

The wreck of the ''New Carissa'' caused what is considered by many to be one of the most serious [[oil spill]]s to affect the state of Oregon, and the worst since a 1984 spill near [[Longview, Washington]] which dumped 200,000&nbsp;gallons&nbsp;(750,000&nbsp;liters) of oil into the [[Columbia River]].<ref>{{cite news|

Despite the large loss of [[marine biology|marine life]], the initial burning of the oil and the successful removal of the bow section prevented what could have been a worse spill. Captain Mike Hall of the Coast Guard stated that "at least 82 percent of the oil onboard the ''New Carissa'' never reached the wildlife or the pristine shoreline of Oregon's coast".<ref name=skimmer/> The environmental impact of the sinking of the bow section was thought to be minimized since it was towed out beyond the [[continental shelf]], into very deep water. Any remaining oil on board is unlikely to have affected marine life since the low temperatures at the bottom of the ocean would have caused it to solidify.<ref>

==Legal aftermath==
Subsequent [[litigation]] has proven expensive for the ship's owners, and an investigation into the incident delayed most of the crew's return to their home country.

===Litigation===
In [[2001]], Green Atlas Shipping and its insurer sued the United States for [[United States dollar|US]]$96&nbsp;million, claiming [[negligence]] on the part of the Coast Guard due to faulty [[nautical chart]]s.<ref name="ODSL"/> The U.S. countersued for US$7&nbsp;million in damages. In 2004, the two sides reached an agreement in which Green Atlas would pay the U.S. US$10.5&nbsp;million to assist with cleanup costs, and the U.S. paid Green Atlas US$4&nbsp;million in settlement of the faulty charts claim. The net result of the settlement was payment of US$6.5&nbsp;million to the U.S.<ref name="timeline">

The State of Oregon demanded that the ship's owners or their insurers remove the ship or pay a US$25&nbsp;million [[bond (finance)|bond]] to cover the cost of removing the ship and for environmental damages. The state also filed a lawsuit in Coos County, demanding removal, storage fees of USD&nbsp;$1,500 per day, restoration of the beach, and other unspecified damages. The ship's owners alleged faulty navigational charts, failure on the part of the local bar pilots to advise the ship's crew not to anchor in the area, and an unusually strong [[storm surge]]. On [[November 13]] [[2002]], a Coos County jury found the ship's owners guilty of negligent [[trespass]], and awarded the state US$25&nbsp;million in damages. That sum was placed in [[escrow]], pending appeal.<ref name="ODSL"/> On [[May 23]] [[2006]], a settlement was reached in the appeal in which the state kept US$20&nbsp;million of the US$25&nbsp;million in escrow, plus US$2.1&nbsp;million in interest earned on the escrow account. The remaining US$5&nbsp;million was returned to Green Atlas Shipping. Of the US$22.1&nbsp;million that the state was awarded in the settlement, US$3.1&nbsp;million will be used to pay the state's legal fees. The remaining US$19&nbsp;million will be used for cleanup, including the future removal of the vessel's stern.<ref name="ODSL_settlement">

==Future plans==
[[Image:NewCarissaStern.jpeg|thumb|left|The stern of the ''New Carissa'' rests on the beach, October 7, 1999.]]
While the attempts to tow the stern out to sea failed (and have now been deemed unworkable by authorities), the State of Oregon still intends to see the remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. The settlement of the lawsuit against the ship's owners cleared the legal obstacles that prevented removal, and provided the funds necessary to finance the project. The removal will be complicated by the fact that the ship has become deeply embedded in the sand, with some portions of the stern estimated to be 20&ndash;30&nbsp;feet (6&ndash;9&nbsp;m) below the sand line.<ref name="removal">{{cite news|

A project to remove the stern by dismantling it on the beach is being planned and will begin in 2008, pending [[Oregon Legislative Assembly|legislative]] approval. As of January 2007, the state and the ship's owners are negotiating a contract with Titan Maritime Company, a subsidiary of [[Crowley Maritime|Crowley Maritime Corporation]]. Titan Maritime owns large [[jackup barge]]s and [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] pulling machines that may be able to move the stern out of the sand, allowing crews to cut it into removable pieces.<ref name="removal"/> The project is expected to cost USD&nbsp;$18&nbsp;million, and was approved by the State Legislative Emergency Board in September 2006.<ref name="World">{{cite news|

There has been debate by local residents on whether the wrecked stern should be removed.

The president of the Coos Bay [[city council]] expressed concern that the proposed removal operation could cause ecological damage that would not occur if the ship were left on the beach. He further noted that "shipwrecks on the [[Oregon Coast]] are part of our history. There are a lot of ways you could better spend the money here.<U+201D><ref name="removal"/>

Many others argue that the ship should be removed. According to Louise Solliday, the director of the Department of State Lands, removal of the stern is a necessary step to demonstrate that the state is "serious about removing wrecks". She stated that if the stern were not removed, the argument that the ship is trespassing on state property (used in the state's lawsuit against the ''New Carissa'' owners) would be undermined should another vessel wreck off the Oregon coast.<ref name="oreg"/> The sentiment was later echoed by Oregon [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]] [[Bill Bradbury]], who also noted that the settlement of the lawsuit with the ship's owners leaves the state exposed to any liability issues concerning the ship.<ref name="removal"/> Many environmentalists, as well as federal [[biologist]]s and residents of the local community, remain concerned about the potential for further ecological damage should the vessel leak any of the fuel oil that remains on board.<ref name="ODSL"/> The editorial board of ''[[The Oregonian]]'' argued that allowing the stern to remain would send a message that the state is willing to "tolerate permanent damage to its beaches". The newspaper also rejected the notion that the wreckage should be compared to the ''[[Peter Iredale (ship)|Peter Iredale]]'', a [[sailing ship]] that wrecked on a beach near Astoria in the early 1900s, and whose remnants are a popular tourist draw.<ref>{{cite news|
