'''Clifton Down railway station''' is on the [[Severn Beach Line]] and serves the district of [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] in [[Bristol]], England. It is {{convert|3.9|mi|km}} from {{rws|Bristol Temple Meads}}. Its three letter station code is '''CFN'''. It was opened in 1874 by the [[Great Western Railway|Great Western]] and [[Midland Railway|Midland]] Railways as part of the [[Clifton Extension Railway]]. By 1995 there was talk of the line being closed completely, but services were improved following action by the campaign group [[Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways]], and in the nine years 2002<U+2013>11, the station saw an 130% increase in passenger numbers. As of 2012, it is managed by [[First Great Western]], which is the third franchise to be responsible for the station since [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatisation]] in 1997. They provide all train services at the station, mainly a train every forty minutes in each direction between {{rws|Bristol Temple Meads}} and {{rws|Avonmouth}}.

== Services ==

As Clifton Down is the Severn Beach Line's main passing point, trains to Avonmouth usually arrive at the same time as trains to Bristol Temple Meads.

== History ==
=== Joint railway era ===
The [[Clifton Extension Railway]] was opened from [[Narroways Hill Junction]] to Clifton Down as a joint venture between the [[Great Western Railway]] and [[Midland Railway]] to connect their main lines to the [[Bristol Port Railway and Pier]] in the [[Avon Gorge]].<ref name="Oakley"/> Clifton Down railway station opened on 1 October 1874, when passenger services began, and was for a while the terminal station. It was the second station along the line from [[Narroways Hill Junction]] where the Extension Railway left the [[Bristol and South Wales Union Railway]]'s main line to Wales. It remained the second station until {{rws|Redland}} was opened in 1897.<ref name="Oakley"/> The line was built at {{RailGauge|ussg}} standard gauge.<ref name="maggsbprp">{{cite book|title=The Bristol Port Railway and Pier|author=Maggs, Colin|year=1975|publisher=The Oakwood Press}}</ref>

The station was built by Messrs Baker & Son of [[Cabot (ward)#Canon's Marsh|Canon's Marsh, Bristol]].<ref name="maggsbprp"/> The buildings, constructed in a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, cost <U+00A3>20,000, with the main buildings on the northern platform. There was a large booking hall with sizeable fireplaces at each end. Pointed ground floor doorways gave access to the hall, which was adjacent to the booking offices and waiting rooms. It is believed that the station master's lodgings in this building were never used as such. A wide carriage drive led down to the northern platform, which was linked to the southern platform by a glass-covered footbridge. There was originally no waiting room on the southern platform, but one was built in October 1898. The platforms were mostly covered by "ridge and furrow" glass roofs, supported by iron columns. The station was flooded in August 1883, which resulted in the installation of extra drainage. There was a large goods yard to the south of the platforms, accessed from the west, with a 28-lever [[signal box]] at the west end of the southern platform.<ref name="Oakley"/>

[[File:Clifton Down tunnel - geograph.org.uk - 1249068.jpg|thumb|The [[Clifton Down Tunnel]] is just to the east of the station. The tunnel was opened to freight in 1877, and to passengers in 1885.]]
The initial service provided at Clifton Down by the Midland Railway was to {{rws|Fishponds}} and {{rws|Mangotsfield}}, where passengers could change for services to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Birmingham]] and other Midland destinations. The Great Western provided services from Clifton Down to {{rws|Bristol Temple Meads}}, the city's major station, where passengers could change for trains to [[London]], [[Exeter]] and [[Wales]], among others. The Great Western also provided occasional through services to {{rws|Weston-super-Mare}}. There were a total of 23 trains in each direction between the two companies Monday-Saturday.<ref name="Oakley"/> On Sundays, there was no Midland service, but seven Great Western trains.<ref name="maggs21">{{cite book|title=Rail Centres: Bristol (#21)|author=Maggs, Colin G|year=2008|origyear=First published 1981|publisher=Booklaw Publications|location=[[Nottingham]]|edition=3rd|pages=41<U+2013>42|isbn=1-901945-30-8}}</ref> The fare to Temple Meads was 6d first-class and 3d third-class.<ref name="maggsbprp"/> The [[Clifton Down Tunnel]], the final link to the Bristol Port Railway and Pier, was opened in 1877, initially allowing freight trains to reach [[Avonmouth Docks]]. It was not until 1885 that it was cleared for passenger use, which allowed services to {{rws|Avonmouth}} via {{rws|Sea Mills}} and {{rws|Shirehampton}}. There was a trial Midland service between {{rws|Bristol St Philip's}} and Avonmouth in September 1885, but this was ended after a month.<ref name="Oakley"/> In 1886, the daily Great Western service was six trains each way between Avonmouth and Temple Meads, 24 trains from Clifton Down to Temple Meads and 26 the other direction. The Midland provided 12 services from Clifton Down to Fishponds, and 11 back.<ref name="maggs21"/>

Clifton Down had large numbers of excursion trains, both arriving and departing. There were regular trains during the summer season to Weston-super-Mare and {{rws|Clevedon}}, as well as to {{rws|Weymouth}}, London and, more locally, football specials to {{rws|Ashton Gate}}. There were also regular excursion trains for visitors to the nearby [[Bristol Zoo]]. These services were known as "Monkey Specials". In 1886, the [[Bath and West Show]] being held on [[Durdham Down]] generated some 33,000 extra passengers over five days, with direct services from {{rws|Bath Green Park}} and an extra 16 services from Temple Meads. The Show was held on Durdham Down again in 1921, temporarily increasing traffic from Temple Meads by 12 trains per day, although there was increased competition from local bus services. The station also received visits from [[King Edward VII]] in 1902 and 1908 (the former as a prince), and from a delegation of [[British Empire]] [[Prime Minister]]s in 1907.<ref name="Oakley"/>

The line had initially been managed by the Clifton Extension Railway Joint Committee, but in 1894 the line's management was passed to the Great Western & Midland Railways Joint Committee.<ref name="maggsbprp"/> In 1909, the station master at Redland was withdrawn, his duties incorporated into the job of Clifton Down station master. In 1910, Clifton Down saw 17 Great Western services from Avonmouth to Temple Meads and 15 the other way, a further 20 trains each day operating between Clifton and Temple Meads, and 13 Midland trains each way between Clifton and Fishponds or Mangotsfield. Midland services were suspended from 1 January 1917 to 15 May 1919 due to the [[First World War]].<ref name="Oakley"/> The {{rws|Hotwells}} section of the Bristol Port Railway and Pier closed in 1922, so to compensate, an additional six trains were provided from Clifton Down to Avonmouth, and four back.<ref name="maggs21"/>

In 1923, [[Railways Act 1921|grouping]] resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS.<ref name="maggsbprp"/> From 1924, many trains to Avonmouth were extended to {{rws|Severn Beach}}, a growing seaside resort, and some on to {{rws|Pilning}}, then back to Temple Meads via {{rws|Patchway}}.<ref name="nytbl"/><ref name="maggs21"/> Between 1903 and 1930 the station employed an average of 22 staff, and in 1926 the station master assumed control over Montpelier as well. The platform canopies were partially removed in the 1930s, and bomb-damage during the [[Bristol Blitz]] saw them cut back further. The [[Second World War|war]] also saw the end of services to Fishponds and Mangotsfield, the last operating on 31 March 1941.<ref name="Oakley"/> By 1947, just before the start of the British Rail era, there were 33 services each direction between Avonmouth and Temple Meads, and 18 on Sundays.<ref name="maggs21"/> Some trains made circular trips to and from Temple Meads via Clifton Down and {{rws|Henbury}} or {{rws|Pilning}}.<ref name="nytbl"/><ref name="Oakley"/>

=== British Rail and privatisation ===
[[File:Clifton Down railway station MMB 01.jpg|thumb|The old station building is no longer accessible from the platforms, having been closed in 1967. It is currently in use as an Australian-themed pub.]]
[[File:Clifton Down railway station 1979.jpg|thumb|right|The Clifton Down Shopping Centre was built on the site of the goods yard in the early 1980s.]]
When the railways were [[nationalisation|nationalised]] in [[Transport Act 1947|1948]], services at Clifton Down came under the aegis of the [[Western Region of British Railways]],<ref name="maggsbprp"/> and there remained a strong staff presence in 1958, with a station master, chief booking clerk, four other clerks, six porters, a shunter, a checker and a weighbridge assistant.<ref name="Oakley"/> Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers, and saw the withdrawal of a special schoolchildren's service.<ref name="maggs21"/> A year later in 1963, [[Beeching cuts|the Beeching report]] suggested that all services along the Severn Beach Line be withdrawn. Following meetings with staff, it was decided to keep the line open to Severn Beach, but to close the section to Pilning, and also end services via Henbury.<ref name="maggsbprp"/> These services duly ended,<ref name="nytbl"/> and in July 1965 the goods yard at Clifton Down also closed.<ref name="Oakley"/> The line however was still threatened, and on 10 February 1967 it was announced that all services between {{rws|Stapleton Road}} and Severn Beach would be discontinued. An enquiry followed, and in June that year the decision was reversed, on the condition that tickets be issued on the trains. Thus, on 17 July 1967, all stations along the line, including Clifton Down, had their staff withdrawn.<ref name="Oakley"/><ref name="maggsbprp"/> The decrease of costs allowed a reduction of ticket prices, but the line was still under threat until in June 1969 it was decided that the line's closure would result in significant hardship, and so a grant was allocated to ensure continued services.<ref name="maggsbprp"/> Service levels however still declined: though the "Monkey Specials" were still going strong into the 1960s, with 340,000 excursion passengers arriving between 1958 and 1966, the closure of many of the Welsh [[Valley Lines]] and the construction of the [[Severn Bridge]] led to their demise in the early 1970s. Most of the Severn Beach Line was reduced to single track in late 1970, leaving Clifton Down as one of the few passing places. The glass platform canopies were completely removed in May 1971, and the glass-covered footbridge was also removed, leaving a set of steps from Whiteladies road as the only access to the southern platform.<ref name="Oakley"/> In the 1979 and the early 1980s, the Clifton Down Shopping Centre was built over most of the goods yard,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.completelyretail.co.uk/scheme/Clifton-Down-Shopping-Centre-Bristol/index.html|title=Clifton Down Shopping Centre|work=[http://www.completelyretail.co.uk Completely Retail.co.uk]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref> the rest covered by a housing development.<ref name="OS"/><ref name="Oakley"/>

[[British Rail]] was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Clifton Down passed to [[Regional Railways]]. A programme of refurbishment was carried out in 1992/3, including the installation of a new metal footbridge and ramp access to the southern platform.<ref name="Oakley"/> In December 1994, the station building, which had been bricked up when staff were withdrawn, and was by then the Steam Tavern [[public house]], was designated a grade II [[listed building]], along with the screen walls.<ref name="listed">{{cite web | title=Clifton Down Station, Steam Tavern Public House and attached screen walls | work=[[Images of England]] | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380884 | accessdate=24 March 2007}}</ref> It is still in use as a pub, and has been called the Roo Bar since at least 2005.<ref name="roobar">{{cite web|url=http://www.originalpubco.com/pub-food/roo-bar/pid-P0863?utm_source=g_places&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=pubs&utm_keyword=&utm_content=|title=Roo Bar|accessdate=22 July 2012|work=Original Pub Company}}</ref><ref name="Oakley"/> At this time, all trains ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular.<ref name="nytbl"/> This changed in 1995 when an hourly timetable was introduced for peak times, but services were terminated at Avonmouth, allowing a single [[Sprinter (train)|''Sprinter'']] unit to work the service. There was a better service on Saturdays as more rolling stock was available,<ref name="maggs21"/> but there was no Sunday service.<ref name="difference"/> Talk arose again of the line being closed completely.<ref name="difference"/> Local tourism expert Bernard Lane described the line's state as
<blockquote>...&nbsp;the line the railway wished was not there. It was the line that got bus substitution whenever they were short of trains or queues, when a rugby match in Cardiff needed a special. It has a problem in that the route is slow and not very direct; for years it was invisible, short of marketing and lacking a regular interval timetable.<ref name="nytbl"/></blockquote>
