'''[[Tonga]]''' competed at the  '''[[2008 Summer Olympics]]''', that celebrated in [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], from August 8 to August 24, 2008. Tonga was represented by the [[Tonga Sports Association and National Olympic Committee]], and was one of 117 nations that won no medals at the Games. Tonga was represented by three athletes competing in two sports&ndash;[[Aisea Tohi]] and [[Ana Po'uhila]] in track and field events, and [[Maamaloa Lolohea]] in weightlifting. The delegation's appearance at the Olympics marked its seventh consecutive appearance at the Olympics since its debut at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles. The flag bearer for Tonga in Beijing was field athlete Ana Po'uhila.

==Background==

The [[Tonga|Kingdom of Tonga]] is an archipelago of 169 islands (36 are inhabited by about 100,000 people) that is located in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] to the far east of [[Australia]]. Initially known as the "Friendly Islands" by explorers, The islands of Tonga united under a single monarchy in 1845, and devised a constitution to restrain the monarchy in 1875. It is the only nation in the South Pacific that has neither been formally colonized nor had its original government dissolved, although it became a [[protectorate]] of the United Kingdom on 1900. Tonga renounced British protection in 1970 and, as of 2012, was the only monarchy in the Pacific Ocean.<ref name=cia />

Some 14 years after becoming a sovereign nation in both foreign and domestic affairs, Tonga submitted its first delegation to the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], its largest Olympic team ever as of the Beijing Olympics. The first female Tongan athlete participated in the Olympics at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. Between 1984 and 2008, Tongan athletes have participated at all of the seven summer Olympics. From 1988 to 2008, however, there had not been a Tongan Olympic team greater than five athletes in size. There had been a single Tongan medalist during this time period: [[Paea Wolfgramm]] won a silver medal in  boxing at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia.<ref name=tonga-sr />

Three athletes went to the 2008 Beijing Summer Games to participate on Tonga's behalf. [[Aisea Tohi]] was its sole track athlete, [[Ana Po'uhila]] was its sole field and only female athlete, and [[Maamaloa Lolohea]] was its only weightlifter. At 21 years old, Tohi was the youngest member of the delegation; Lolohea, at 40, was the oldest.<ref name=ton8-sr /> Po'uhila was the nation's flag bearer at the ceremonies.<ref name=tonga-sr />

[[Aisea Tohi]] represented Tonga at the Beijing Olympics in track and field. Born on Tonga's main island of [[Tongatapu]] in the settlement of Tofua, attended the Beijing Olympics at 21 years old, participating in the men's 100&nbsp;meters dash. Tohi had not previously competed in any Olympic games.<ref name=tohi-sr /> During the course of his event's qualification round, which took place on August 14, Tohi was placed in the second heat against seven other athletes. He finished the race in 11.17&nbsp;seconds, placing seventh in his heat ahead of [[Roman William Cress]] from the [[Marshall Islands]] (11.18&nbsp;seconds) and behind [[B<U+00E9>ranger Bosse]] of the [[Central African Republic]] (10.51&nbsp;seconds).

[[Ana Po'uhila]] participated in the women's shot put on the behalf of Tonga at the Beijing Olympics, and was the only female athlete competing for Tonga at the 2008 Olympic games. She was born in Nuku'alofa, the national capital, which lies on the primary Tongan island of Tongatapu. Po'uhila first participated in the Olympics at age 24, when she represented Tonga in shot put at the 2004 Athens games. She represented Tonga again in Beijing at the age of 32.<ref name=ana-sr /> During the qualifying heat of her event, which took place on August 15, the Tongan field athlete was placed in the seventeen-person second heat.<ref name=204ESPN /> Po'uhila was given three attempts to put the shot as far as she could. During the first attempt, she lobbed the shot 16.21&nbsp;meters, ranking 12th in her heat. She bested this ranking on her second attempt when she lobbed it 16.42&nbsp;meters, ranking seventh amongst those who threw during the second try. Her third and final attempt, 16.35&nbsp;meters, did not beat her second attempt.<ref name=ana-sr /> Using her best mark, 16.42&nbsp;meters, Po'uhila placed 12th out of the 16 athletes who finished the event. She ranked ahead of Taiwan's [[Lin Chia-Ying]] (16.32&nbsp;meters) and behind Russia's [[Irina Khudoroshkina]] (16.84&nbsp;meters) in a heat led by China's [[Gong Lijiao]] (19.46&nbsp;meters) and Belarus' [[Nadzeya Ostapchuk]] (19.08&nbsp;meters). Of the 33 athletes who finished the event, Ana Po'uhila ranked 27th. She did not advance to the final round.<ref name=204ESPN />

{{main|Weightlifting at the 2008 Summer Olympics}}

[[Maamaloa Lolohea]] participated in the Beijing Olympics on Tonga's behalf, competing in weightlifting. Lolohea was born in [[Kolofo'ou]], a district of the capital city Nuku'alofa, and competed in Beijing as a 40 year old in the men's [[super-heavyweight]] class division, which encompasses athletes who weigh more than 105&nbsp;kilograms. Lolohea had not previously competed at any Olympic games.<ref name=lolohea-sr /> The Tongan athlete competed in his event on August 19, where he faced 14 other athletes.<ref name=246ESPN /> During the [[snatch (weightlifting)|snatch]] phase of the event, Lolohea was given three attempts. He successfully lifted 127&nbsp;kilograms on his first attempt, 135&nbsp;kilograms on his second attempt, and 140&nbsp;kilograms on his third and final attempt. During the [[clean and jerk]] phase of the event, he successfully lifted 173&nbsp;kilograms on his first try, but unsuccessfully attempted to lift 185&nbsp;kilograms on his second and third attempts. Because his highest scores were 140 in snatch and 173 in clean and jerk, Lolohea's final and total score was 313&nbsp;kilograms.<ref name=lolohea-sr /> Of the 13 competitors who finished the event, Maamaloa Lolohea finished last behind [[Sam Pera Junior|Sam Pera, Jr.]] of the [[Cook Islands]] (350&nbsp;kilograms), who in turn finished behind Finland's [[Antti Everi]] (366&nbsp;kilograms). Gold medalist [[Matthias Steiner]] of Germany, in contrast, lifted a total of 461&nbsp;kilograms.<ref name=246ESPN />
