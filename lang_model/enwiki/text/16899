'''''Drive''''' is a 2011 American drama film directed by [[Nicolas Winding Refn]] that is adapted from [[James Sallis]]'s 2005 novel of the same name. After an unsuccessful attempt to adapt the novel by [[Universal Studios]], this project was greenlit in early 2010. When [[Ryan Gosling]], who plays the unnamed principal character, signed on, he was allowed to choose the director. A fan of his work, the actor chose Refn. Before filming began towards the end of 2010, [[Carey Mulligan]], [[Ron Perlman]], [[Bryan Cranston]], and [[Christina Hendricks]] joined the cast.

Like the book, the movie is about a Hollywood stunt performer (played by Gosling) who moonlights as a getaway driver. Prior to its September 2011 release, it has been shown at a number of film festivals. At the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]], ''Drive'' was lauded with praise and even received a [[standing ovation]]. Reviews from critics have been positive, with many drawing comparisons to work from previous eras. The director himself has said influences came from ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968) and that ''Drive'' was a dedication to [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]].

==Plot==
Driver ([[Ryan Gosling]]), who remains unnamed throughout the film, works in Shannon's ([[Bryan Cranston]]) garage, picks up occasional stunt driving work, and moonlights as a getaway driver. At the start of the film, his driving skills and precision are established as he helps two burglars evade the police. Driver always works anonymously, never for the same crooks twice, and makes a point of only allotting them five minutes to do their business.

Driver becomes involved with his neighbor, Irene ([[Carey Mulligan]]), and her young son, Benicio ([[Kaden Leos]]), when their car breaks down at a grocery store. Driver and Irene appear to be slowly developing a romantic connection when her husband, Standard ([[Oscar Isaac]]), comes home from prison. Standard owes "protection" money to Cook ([[James Biberi]]) from his time in prison. Cook beats him for it and threatens to come after Irene and Benicio if Standard does not do a job for them.

Concerned for Irene, Driver agrees to help Standard placate Cook by robbing a pawn shop. Also participating in the heist is Blanche ([[Christina Hendricks]]), a woman associated with Cook. The job goes fatally wrong as Standard is shot dead by the pawn-shop owner. As Driver and Blanche escape, they are pursued by a mysterious car. As it turns out, Cook had double-crossed them and was planning to steal the money from them after they pulled the job.

Driver and Blanche elude their pursuers and hide out in a motel room. There they discover that the stolen money was much more than they had been told. (Later we learn that it's Mob money being held at the pawn shop.) Cook's men attack them in the motel room, killing Blanche with a shotgun blast and injuring Driver before he's able to kill them.

Driver confronts Cook and learns that Nino ([[Ron Perlman]]) has been behind the heist all along. Nino is an aspiring Jewish mobster who resents the East-Coast Italian mob and has engineered the job to get at them. Nino is also business partners with Bernie Rose ([[Albert Brooks]]) and the two of them had provided the backing for Shannon's scheme to buy a NASCAR racecar and have Driver drive it.

Driver attempts to make a deal with Nino: the money for Irene's safety. However, Nino sends a hitman, which Driver brutally kills in an elevator while Irene cowers in terror. Driver and Bernie meet in a restaurant, ostensibly to broker another deal of money for safety. In the parking lot afterward, as the money is pulled from Driver's car's trunk, Bernie stabs Driver in the abdomen. The attack is not fatal, however, and Driver stabs and kills Bernie, leaving his body on the ground next to the satchel of money. The film closes ambiguously with Driver driving through the night, followed by a [[smash cut]] to black.

==Production==
===Development===
''Drive'' is based on [[James Sallis]]'s 2005 crime novel of the same name.  The novel centers around an unnamed Hollywood stunt driver who also drives getaway cars at night.  He finds himself in a life-threatening position after a bank heist goes wrong. ''Drive'' was optioned by producers [[Marc E. Platt|Marc Platt]] and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions.<ref name="DrivePressKit7">{{cite news |title=Drive Press Kit: The Inspiration |work=FilmDistrict |date=2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> Siegel felt the driver was a rare character: someone who has a purpose, excels at one thing and makes no apologies for it. Platt agreed, noting that the driver reminded him of heroes and movie characters similar to characters [[Clint Eastwood]] used to portray.<ref name="DrivePressKit7" /> The driver is a man of few words and says less 20 sentences in the whole film exemplifying his isolation.
{{quote box|width=40%|quote="I was very taken with this little crime story that James Sallis wrote. I felt that the way the world was presented in the book demanded that its true grit be retained in the script. The grit comes from seeing the world from the point of view of Driver in the car.

[[Academy Award]]-nominated screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] adapted the novel for the screen. He felt it was a rare book to receive from a studio because it was short, gloomy and like a poem.  Because the novel does not present a linear story but has many flashbacks and jumps around in time, Amini found the adaptation challenging. He felt the non-linear structure made it "a very tricky structure" for a feature film.<ref name="DrivePresstKit8">{{cite news |title=Drive Press Kit: The Adaption |work=FilmDistrict |date=2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref>

A film adaption of ''Drive'' was first announced in early 2008, with [[Neil Marshall]] set to direct   what was then being described as "an L.A.-set action mystery" that would be a starring vehicle for [[Hugh Jackman]]. [[Universal Studios]], who had been trying to make a film version for years, was also onboard.<ref name="/Film">{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/neil-marshall-to-direct-hugh-jackman-in-drive |first=Hunter |last=Stephenson |title=Neil Marshall to Direct Hugh Jackman in Drive |work=''[[/Film]]'' |publisher=Peter Sciretta |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref><ref name="NYInfo" />  By February 2010, Marshall and Jackman were no longer attached to the project, and Danish filmmaker [[Nicolas Winding Refn]] was set to direct with [[Ryan Gosling]] in the leading role.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/02/12/ryan-gosling-will-drive-instead-of-hugh-jackman |first=Elisabeth |last=Rappe |title=Ryan Gosling Will 'Drive' Instead Of Hugh Jackman |work=[[Moviefone]] |publisher=[[AOL|AOL Inc.]] |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> When Refn read the first screenplay for ''Drive'', he was more intrigued by the concept of a man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the story itself.<ref name="DrivePresstKit2">{{cite news |title=Drive Press Kit: Nicolas Winding Refn Joins Next |work=FilmDistrict |date=2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref>

===Casting===
''Drive''{{'}}s producer Marc E. Platt contacted Gosling about the movie. He explained, <U+201C>I have this list that I<U+2019>ve created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me <U+2013> writers, directors, actors whom I have to work with before I go onto another career or do something else with my life. Near the top of that list was Ryan Gosling."  Platt heard back from Gosling around 48 hours later. Gosling was attracted to the script because it had a "very strong character" at its core as well as a powerful love story.<ref name="DrivePresstKit">{{cite news |title=Drive Press Kit: Ryan Gosling Climbs Aboard |work=FilmDistrict |date=2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> The actor had always been interested in doing an action-type movie, but often found today's films to focus more on the stunts than on its characters.<ref name="DrivePresstKit" /> He was able to choose the director, which was a first for the actor. "And I thought 'It had to be Nicolas.' There was no other choice," he says.<ref name="indieWire1">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/archives/exclusive_ryan_gosling_talks_drive_says_its_a_cross_between_blue_velvet_pur |title=Exclusive: Ryan Gosling Says He<U+2019>d Love To Do A Sequel To Nicolas Winding Refn<U+2019>s <U+2018>Drive<U+2019> |first=Kevin |last=Jagernauth |work=[[indieWire]] |publisher=[[Snagfilms]] |date=December 8, 2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> However, Gosling was unsure if Refn would do the project as it was not like anything he had ever done before.<ref name="DrivePresstKit2" />

When it came to selecting other cast members, Refn did not cast actors based on casting tapes or auditions. Instead, he required they meet him in person at his house.<ref name="refnav"/> [[Carey Mulligan]] was in negotiations to star in ''Drive'' in August 2010, and she was cast soon after<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/08/23/carey-mulligan-breaking-bad-star-bryan-cranston-lining-up-to-join-ryan-gosling-in-drive |title=Carey Mulligan, 'Breaking Bad' Star Bryan Cranston Lining Up To Join Ryan Gosling In 'Drive' |first=Adam |last=Rosenberg |work=''[[MTV]]'' |publisher=[[Viacom]] |date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> as a Los Angeles-born Anglo mother raising her 7-year-old  Latino child.<ref name="CMCasting" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/feed.asp?NID=28733 |title=Carey Mulligan Wants To Drive |first=James |last=White |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |publisher=[[Bauer Consumer Media]] |date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> She was interested in working with Refn because she was a fan of his films ''[[Bronson (film)|Bronson]]'' and ''[[Valhalla Rising (film)|Valhalla Rising]]''.<ref name="CMCasting" /> The role was originally written as a Latina woman in her late 20s.

He felt her casting would cement the love story in a more engaging way. "It made it more of a ''[[Romeo & Juliet]]'' kind of love story without the politics that would in this day and age be brought into it if you had different nationalities or different religions," Refn explained.<ref name="DrivePressKit4">{{cite news |title=Drive Press Kit: The A-List Cast |work=FilmDistrict |date=2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref>
[[File:Christina Hendricks @ BE booth.jpg|right|180px|Having seen photos of her and thinking she was very beautiful, Refn's wife recommended her to him for Blanche.<ref name="refnav"/>|thumb]]

[[Bryan Cranston]] plays the role of Shannon.<ref name="DrivePressKit4" /> A fan of ''[[Breaking Bad (TV series)|Breaking Bad]]'', he was one of the first actors Refn looked to cast. Knowing the actor had other opportunities, the director tried to interest him by asking Cranston how he would like to develop the role. After not hearing back, Refn called him, who at that very same time was writing on a piece of paper of the pros and cons of doing ''Drive''. Moved by Refn's interest, he accepted the part.<ref name="refnav"/> [[Christina Hendricks]] plays the small but important role of Blanche.<ref name="DrivePressKit4" /> "Trying to work in a more reality arena for a character like that," Refn originally auditioned porn stars for Blanche. However, he was unable to find anyone who was good-enough acting-wise. After meeting with Hendricks, he decided to cast her feeling her "powerhouse" persona would click with the character.<ref name="refnav"/>

[[Albert Brooks]] plays the foul mouthed, morose Bernie Rose. When Refn suggested him, Gosling agreed but thought the actor would not be up for playing a character that is violent and sullen or appearing in a film that he did not work on himself.<ref name="DrivePressKit4" /> Brooks accepted the role to go against [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] and because he loved that Bernie was not cliched. "There are six people you could always get to play this kind of part, and I like that the director was thinking outside of the box. For me, it was an opportunity to act outside the box. I liked that this mobster had real style. Also, he doesn<U+2019>t get up in the morning thinking about killing people. He<U+2019>s sad about it. Upset about it. It<U+2019>s a case of, 'Look what you made me do.'"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/pearlman/7625078-417/albert-brooks-changes-gears-to-play-mob-boss-in-drive.html |title=Albert Brooks changes gears to play mob boss in <U+2018>Drive<U+2019> |first=Cindy |last=Pearlman |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]] |date=September 14, 2011 |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}</ref>

Nino, a key villain, is portrayed by [[Ron Perlman]], one of the last actors to join the cast. Regarding the casting of Perlman, Refn said, "The character of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he<U+2019>s done so many great films. When Ron said, <U+2018>I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster<U+2019>, and I asked why, and he said, <U+2018>because that<U+2019>s what I am <U+2013> a Jewish boy from New York<U+2019>, well, that automatically cemented it for me."<ref name="DrivePressKit4" /> [[Oscar Isaac]] portrays a Latino convict named Standard who is married to Irene and just released from prison aweek after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the [[archetypal]] character into something more. He said of the role, <blockquote>"As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making <U+2018>Standard<U+2019> more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling."<ref name="DrivePressKit4" /></blockquote>

===Filming===
The film was made on a [[production budget]] of about $13 million and shot in various parts of Los Angeles, California.<ref name="Deadline1" /> Refn moved into a Los Angeles home and insisted that the cast members and screenwriter Amini move in with him. They would work on the script and film all day, then watch films, edit or drive at night.<ref name="VS" /> Refn requested that the editing suite be placed in his home as well.<ref name="NYInfo">{{cite web |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/cannes-q-and-a-driving-in-a-noir-l-a |title=Cannes Q. and A.: Driving in a Noir L.A. |first=Dennis |last=Lim |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=May 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}</ref> The film was shot [[digital cinematography|digitally]] using the [[Arri Alexa]] camera.<ref>{{cite web |title=ARRI celebrates the 2011 Cannes Film Festival |url=http://www.arri.de/news.html?article=691&cHash=50c11af7d8 |publisher=[[Arri|ARRI Group]] |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}</ref> Refn spoke to [[Gaspar No<U+00E9>]] and asked him how he did the head-smashing scene in his film ''[[Irr<U+00E9>versible]]'' (2002).<ref name="NYInfo" /> According to ''Drive''{{'}}s executive producer Lancaster, the film contains abundant, evocative, intense images of Los Angeles that are not often seen. "From the little seen back streets of downtown LA to the dry arid outposts on the peaks of the desert landscape surrounding it, Siegel has re-imagined an LA all the way down to the rocky cliffs by the sea."<ref name="DrivePressKit9"/>

With a shooting script of 81 pages, Refn and Gosling continued to trim down dialog during filming.<ref name="refnav"/> Car scenes were filmed with a "biscuit rig", a camera car rig developed for the film ''[[Seabiscuit (film)|Seabiscuit]]'' (2003), which allowed a precision driver to steer the car, freeing Gosling to concentrate on acting. Consistent with Refn's usual visual style, [[wide-angle lens]]es were heavily used by cinematographer [[Newton Thomas Sigel]]. Handheld camerawork was avoided.<ref name="DrivePressKit9">{{cite news |title=Drive Press Kit: Visual Style |date=2011 |work=FilmDistrict |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> Preferring to keep the film more "grounded" and authentic, Refn also avoided use of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI).

Beth Mickle was hired as ''Drive''{{'}}s [[production designer]] after Gosling recommended her, after working together on 2006's ''[[Half Nelson (film)|Half Nelson]]''. Prior to filming, Mickle supervised a crew of 40, routinely working 16-to-18-hour days. Her most expensive film to date, Mickle felt freer since, unlike ''Half Nelson'', "there was another zero added to the budget."<ref name="sets">{{cite web |url=http://articles.mcall.com/2011-09-14/entertainment/mc-movies-0915-20110914_1_movie-carey-mulligan-sets |title=Berks native driven to design movie sets |first=Amy |last=Longsdorf |work=[[The Morning Call]] |publisher=Tribune Company |date=September 14, 2011 |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}</ref> They built Gosling's character's apartment building, which included a hallway and elevator that linked his unit to Irene's.

Journalists and reviewers have called ''Drive'' a "classic Los Angeles heist-gone-wrong story" that is a "tribute to the genre of car films" in the vein of movies like ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968). It combines comic gore, [[film noir]] and [[B-movie]] aesthetics, and Hollywood spectacle, resulting in "a bizarre concoction...reminiscent of [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''...[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', and [with] angst-laden love scenes that would not be out of place in a Scandinavian drama". Other comparisons have been to the works of [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]], [[John Carpenter]] and [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]].

Refn's main inspiration for ''Drive'' came from [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]], and his goal was to make a movie that was structured like a fairy tale:  condensed in its storytelling and with archetypal characters.  Refn sees The Driver as a knight who roams around the countryside searching for people to save. Refn was also inspired by films such as ''[[Point Blank]]'' (1969), ''[[Two-Lane Blacktop]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Driver]]'' (1978). [[Jean-Pierre Melville]]<U+2019>s crime productions influenced the [[cinematography]].<ref name="NYInfo" /><ref name="11indiewire"/> Refn wanted [[electronic music]] for the film. He gave composer [[Cliff Martinez]] a [[music sampling|sampling]] of songs he liked and asked Martinez to emulate the sound, resulting in "a kind of [[retro]], 80ish, [[synthesizer]] [[europop]]".

The film's main character, The Driver, has been compared to [[the Man With No Name]], a character Clint Eastwood portrayed in the [[Sergio Leone]] [[western film|westerns]], because he almost never speaks and communicates mostly non-verbally.<ref name="Salon"/> The Driver's meager dialogue is not designed to present him as tough, but to soften him.

==Release==
Originally planned as a blockbuster, ''Drive'' was eventually re-labeled as an [[independent film]].  Prior to [[principal photography]], Refn went to the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]] in an effort to sell the rights to ''Drive'' and released promotional posters for the film.<ref name="indieWire1" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/bronsonhelmerfancieswonderwomanns_campaign=news&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=totalfilm&ns_linkname=0&ns_fee=0&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+totalfilm%2Fimdbnews+%28Total+Film+IMDb+aggregate%29 |first=Emma |last=Didbin |title=Bronson helmer fancies Wonder Woman |work=[[Total Film]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/promo-poster-nicolas-winding-refns-drive |title=Promo Poster: Nicolas Winding Refn<U+2019>s Drive |first=Peter |last=Sciretta |publisher=Peter Sciretta |work=''/Film'' |date=May 17, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> In November 2010, FilmDistrict acquired North American distribution rights.<ref name="Deadline1">{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/11/filmdistrict-drives-first-big-afm-deal |first=Mike |last=Fleming |title=FilmDistrict Drives To First Big AFM Deal |work=''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' |publisher=[[Mail.com Media|Mail.com Media Corporation]] |date=November 3, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> The owners were so eager to get their hands on ''Drive'', they started negotiating to buy it before seeing any footage, believing it could appeal to people who enjoy a genre movie, as well as the arthouse crowd.<ref name="WSJ">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/05/20/filmdistrict-and-ryan-gosling-mix-art-with-action-in-drive |title=FilmDistrict and Ryan Gosling Mix Art with Action in <U+201C>Drive<U+201D> |first=Anthony |last=Kaufman |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc |date=May 20, 2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> The film has a release date of September 16, 2011, in the United States.<ref name="Deadline1" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/archives/nicolas_winding_refns_drive_will_hit_theaters_september_16_2011_via_film_di |first=Edward |last=Davis |title=Nicolas Winding Refn's 'Drive' Will Hit Theaters September 16, 2011 Via Film District |work=indieWire |publisher=Snagfilms |date=December 12, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref>

''Drive'' has received substantial critical acclaim. As of September 17, 2011, it had  a score of 93% on the review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on reviews from 135 critics, with an average score of 8.3/10;<ref name="RottenTomatoes">{{Cite web |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/drive_2011/ |title=Drive (2011) |work=''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' |publisher=[[Flixster]] |accessdate= September 17, 2011}}</ref> on [[Metacritic]] it had a weighted score of 80/100, based on 39 critics, which it ranks as "generally favorable".<ref name="Metacritic">{{Cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/drive |title =Drive |work=''[[Metacritic]]'' |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=September 11, 2011}}</ref> Gosling's and Brooks' performances, as well as ''Drive''{{'}}s aesthetics, were generally the most praised aspects of the film by movie critics. ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' writer [[Peter Travers]] considered this film to be the type to evoke polarized reception among its viewers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/drive-20110908 |title=Drive |work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] |publisher=[[Jann Wenner]] |first=Peter |last=Travers |authorlink=Peter Travers |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}</ref>

Peter Debruge of [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] praised ''Drive'' for standing out from other similarly themed films whose visuals and narration fall flat. However, Debruge expected more driving scenes and found Mulligan to be a misfit for Irene.<ref name="VarietyCannes" /> Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called ''Drive'' a "tasty, if sketchy, modern noir with car chases and bloody action that should turn the trick for genre-seeking audiences."<ref name="THR" /> Noting ''Drive's'' marvelously assembled cast, he said Gosling takes on the right behavior for his role, making a bid to enter the ranks of Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood. In contrast to Debruge, McCarthy found Mulligan to be a charming choice for Irene.<ref name="THR">{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/drive-cannes-2011-review-190649 |title=Drive: Cannes 2011 Review |first=Todd |last=McCarthy |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=May 20, 2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> Reviewing it for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] wrote: "The entire film, in fact, seems much more real than the usual action-crime-chase concoctions we've grown tired of.

[[Movieline]]'s Stephanie Zacharek thought ''Drive'' defined the current standard for motion pictures,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieline.com/2011/05/cannes-review-ryan-gosling-owns-the-road-in-drive.php |title=Cannes Review: Ryan Gosling Owns the Road in Drive |first=Stephanie |last=Zacharek |work=''[[Movieline]]'' |publisher=Mail.com Media Corporation |date=May 20, 2011 |accessdate=August 27, 2011}}</ref> and Mike D'Angelo of the ''[[The AV Club]]'' gave it a "B+" rating, saying he will remember at least half of the movie's scenes for the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/cannes-11-day-nine-the-two-most-entertaining-films,56384/?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=feeds&utm_source=channel_film |first=Mike |last=D'Angelo |work=[[The AV Club]] |publisher=The Onion Inc |title=Cannes '11, day nine: The two most entertaining films in Competition, and neither one is directed by Pedro Almod<U+00F3>var.  |date=May 20, 2011 |accessdate=August 27, 2011}}</ref> Chris Lackner of the ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' echoed a comment similar to Zacharek's, finding ''Drive'' to be a refreshing different change of pace, avoiding Hollywood's trite film formula routine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Gosling+puts+pedal+metal+Drive/5387326/story.html |first=Chris |last=Lackner |title=Gosling puts pedal to the metal in Drive |work=[[Vancouver Sun]] |publisher=Postmedia Network Inc |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}</ref> Awarding the film a four out five star rating, ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' journalist Roger Moore deemed ''Drive'' to be "the quietest car picture ever" and, based on what he had seen with this production, said he was looking for to future collaborations between the star and director.<ref name="ratedr">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2011/09/movie-review-drive.html |title=Movie Review: Drive |first=Roger |last=Moore |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |publisher=Tribune Company |date=September 14, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref> Jessica Winter of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said the scene involving the twofer car crash makes ''Drive'' for a moment turn into "a lost entry in the [[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween franchise]] {{endash}} ''Michael Myers Hits the Beach''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2093404,00.html#ixzz1Y5pJdlsS |title=Drive, He Said: Ryan Gosling's Latest Star Turn |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |first=Jessica |last=Winter |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}</ref>

Karen Durbin of [[Elle (magazine)|''Elle'']] praised the chemistry between Gosling and Mulligan, pointing out that ''Drive'' does not conform to typical male-entertainment. She also rebuked  Refn for underusing Hendricks.<ref>{{cite news |title=Why Men Hurt |first=Karen |last=Durbin |work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]] |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Media]] |page=342 |date=September 2011 |issue=313 |accessdate=August 27, 2011}}</ref> Grading it a "B+", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reviewer Lisa Schwarzbaum clashed with Durban's opinion on the former, finding the two to never click.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20518295,00.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+entertainmentweekly%2Fmovies%2Freviews+%28Entertainment+Weekly%2FEW.com%27s%3A+Movie+Reviews%29 |title=Drive (2011) |first=Lisa |last=Schwarzbaum |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=Time Warner |date=September 14, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref> Despite giving ''Drive'' a high star rating, ''[[The Arizona Republic]]''{{'}}s Randy Cordova criticized how the plot and characters all easily come together: "It's all too neat; someone like [[John Sayles]] (''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'') could have linked these elements in a far more compelling way."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/movies/articles/2011/09/14/20110914drive-movie-review.html#ixzz1Y0QpD35K |title='Drive,' 4 stars |work=[[The Arizona Republic]] |publisher=Gannett Company |first=Randy |last=Cordova |date=September 14, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref> Giving ''Drive'' four out of five stars, ''The Guardian''{{'}}s Xan Brooks observed the film to be quite "self-consciously retro" with a series "of cool, blank surfaces".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/may/20/cannes-film-festival-2011-drive-review |title=Cannes 2011 review: Drive |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group |first=Xan |last=Brooks |date=May 20, 2011 |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}</ref>

In his polarized analysis of the film, ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[A. O. Scott]] believed its supporting performances saved ''Drive'' from tedium. "''Drive'' is somber, slick and earnest, and also a prisoner of its own emptiness, substituting moods for emotions and borrowed style for real audacity. This is not to say that the movie is bad {{endash}} as I have suggested, the skill and polish are hard to dispute {{endash}} but rather that it is, for all its [[bravery|bravado]], timid and [[conventional]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/movies/drive-with-ryan-gosling-review.html?smid=tw-nytimesmovies&seid=auto |first=A.

Understanding that the level of violence is not uncommon for a Refn film, he stated that it was overdone, disquieting and "throws you out of the picture, diluting the mood rather than enhancing it."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-drive-20110916,0,5263663.story?track=rss |first=Kenneth |last=Turran |title=Movie review: 'Drive' |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Tribune Company |date=September 16, 2011 |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}</ref>

A negative review came from [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] writer David Edelstein, who referred to the film as "higher trash" and deemed ''Drive'' to be on the same level of inane as ''[[Conan the Barbarian (2011 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''. Edelstein went on to chide Gosling for his choice to appear in the production. Suggesting most viewers would watch solely for the [[celebrity|popularity]] of ''Drive''{{'}}s actors, he admitted Brook's performance pleasantly surprised him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/drive-edelstein-2011-9/ |title=Bleed Racer |work=New York Magazine |publisher=The New York Times Company |first=David |last=Edelstein |date=September 11, 2011 |accessdate=September 13, 2011}}</ref> Another published negative analysis came from the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''{{'}}s Michael Phillips. Finding ''Drive''{{'}}s pre-credit sequence to be one of the year's most gripping openings, he stated the film goes from compelling in the beginning to "a muddle of ultraviolence, hypocrisy and stylistic preening" by the end.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0913-drive-20110915,0,718551.column |first=Michael |last=Phillips |title='Drive': Noir lives, dies by its look |work=Chicago Tribune |publisher=Tribune Company |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}</ref>
