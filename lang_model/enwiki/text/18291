'''Thady Connellan''' ({{lang-ga|'''Tadhg <U+00D3> Coinniall<U+00E1>inn'''}}) (1780&ndash;1854) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] school-teacher, poet and historian.

==Life==
He was born in [[Skreen]], [[County Sligo]], and was a relative of the scholar [[Owen Connellan]]. He started a school of his own, but had more success when he became principal of a school established by Albert Blest, a Baptist, in Greenville, [[Coolaney]], in the early 1800s. Like his relative Owen he left the Catholic church and embraced Protestantism. Among other works he produced an Irish-English dictionary and edited a series of song-books.<ref>W. G.
