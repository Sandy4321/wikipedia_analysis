'''Michael Altenburg''' (b. [[Alach]], near [[Erfurt]], 27 May 1584 - d. 12 February 1640) was a German theologian and composer.

Altenburg began attending school in Erfurt in 1590; he began studying [[theology]] at the [[University of Erfurt]] in 1598, and was awarded a bachelor's degree in 1599 and a master's in 1603. From 1600 he taught at the ''Reglerschule'' in Erfurt; he was [[Kantor]] at St. Andreas from 1601 and [[rector]] of the school at St. Andreas in Erfurt from 1607. In 1609 he quit teaching to become a [[pastor]], moving to [[Tr<U+00F6>chtelborn]] and preaching there until 1621. During this period Altenburg published music, and was compared to [[Orlando di Lasso]].

After 1621 he moved to S<U+00F6>mmerda, working at the ''Bonifaciuskirche''. While he continued to publish and was respected for his compositions, the [[Thirty Years War]] sapped his efforts. In 1636 a massive [[Plague (disease)|plague]] wiped out most of his [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]], and his wife and ten of his children died before himself. He returned to Erfurt in 1637, where he remained as [[deacon]] and, from 1638, [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] at St Andreas.

Much of Altenburg's compositional output consists of vocal [[concerto]]s, [[motet]]s and [[chorale]]s.
