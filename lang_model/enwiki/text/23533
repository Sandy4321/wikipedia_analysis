'''Forrest Griffin''' (born [[July 1]], [[1979]]) is the first-season winner of [[Spike TV]]'s ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'', a [[Reality television|reality show]] which showcases [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA). He defeated [[Stephan Bonnar]] in a popular final bout, winning by unanimous decision and landing him a professional contract to fight in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (see [[Forrest Griffin vs. Stephan Bonnar]]). Widely recognized as the [[comic relief]] of his profession, he quickly became an audience favorite. His MMA record is 13-4-0 as of [[December 30]], [[2006]].

Griffin came from [[Athens, Georgia]], where he was once a [[Police|law enforcement officer]] for the University of Georgia. Forrest trained at the HardCore Gym in Athens GA for 5 years under Adam and Rory Singer. He later retired from police service in Augusta, Georgia to pursue professional mixed martial arts.

On [[April 15]], [[2006]], Forrest took on his toughest opponent yet when he fought former Light Heavyweight champion [[Tito Ortiz]] at [[UFC 59]]. Although [[mixed martial arts]] commentator [[Eddie Bravo]] scored the fight in favor of Griffin on the UFC unofficial score card, Forrest lost the fight in a split decision.

At ''[[UFC 62]]'', Griffin fought Stephan Bonnar once again for an anticipated rematch. Griffin won by unanimous decision; according to the ringside judges and [[Eddie Bravo]], Griffin had won all three rounds.

Griffin was defeated by [[Keith Jardine]] at [[UFC 66]] by way of TKO at 4:41 of the first round.  After the fight, a visibly distraught Griffin walked away from Joe Rogan's attempt to interview him, saying "I don't ev--I mean, Keith came in, and he did exactly what I wanted to do, and he knocked me the fuck out. Let's go home." Griffin, seen moments after the stoppage with tears in his eyes, then walked off camera, leaving Joe Rogan to speak to the camera by himself. Moments later Griffin reappeared heading the opposite direction, muttering that "The door is over there", and once more proceeding off camera.

Griffin's next fight will be at [[UFC 70]] against [[Ryoto Machida]] on April 21.<ref name="nok">{{cite web
