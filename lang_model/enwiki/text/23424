'''Branch migration''' describes the ability of a [[DNA]] strand partially paired with its complement in a duplex to extend its pairing by displacing the resident strand with which it is homologous. This usually happens when two homologous double strands form a [[Holliday junction]] and the whole structure slides into one direction; the "branch migrates". This procedure can influence the amount of information that is transferred between two recombining partners. In E. Coli RuvA and RuvB of the [[RuvABC]] protein complex promote branch migration until RuvC binds and resolves the Holliday junction by cleaving.
Another definition for branch migration is the extension of a [[D-loop]] when a single stranded DNA strand invades a "recipient" duplex during recombination or repair.
