'''Sir Wallace Edward Rowling''', {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George|KCMG]] [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]]}} (15 November 1927 &ndash; 31 October 1995), often known as '''Bill Rowling''', was the [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|30th]] [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] of New Zealand. He was in office for just over a year, having been appointed Prime Minister following the death of the highly popular [[Norman Kirk]]. Rowling was unable to retain the premiership but remained leader of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] until 1983.

==Early life==
Rowling was born in a country suburb of Mariri neighbouring the town of [[Motueka]], near [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]]. He was a member of a long-established farming family. He was educated at [[Nelson College]] and the [[University of Canterbury]], gaining a degree in economics. He also attended the Christchurch College of Education (currently, [[University of Canterbury]]), qualifying as a teacher. After completing his education, Rowling taught at several schools around the country, including at [[Motueka]], [[Christchurch]], [[Waverley, Taranaki|Waverley]] and in [[Northland Region|Northland]]. In 1958, Rowling left teaching and joined the [[New Zealand Army]], becoming Assistant Director of Army Education. He spent a short amount of time serving abroad in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], a deployment connected with the [[Malayan Emergency]].<ref name="DNZB Rowling" />

In the [[New Zealand general election, 1960|1960 election]], Rowling was selected as the Labour Party's candidate for the [[Fendalton (New Zealand electorate)|Fendalton]] electorate in Christchurch. Fendalton was regarded as a safe National seat, and Rowling was defeated by the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]'s [[Harry Lake]] (who was appointed [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] in the new National government). Two years later, however, Rowling successfully contested the [[Buller by-election, 1962|by-election]] for [[Buller (New Zealand electorate)|Buller]], which had been caused by the death of prominent Labour MP [[Jerry Skinner]]. Rowling was to hold this seat until the [[New Zealand general election, 1960|election of 1972]], when the seat was dissolved <U+2013> Rowling then contested successfully the new seat of [[Tasman (New Zealand electorate)|Tasman]], which intriguingly he did travelling up and down the electorate by Commer campervan, which he lived in for the time.

When the Labour Party won power under [[Norman Kirk]] in the [[New Zealand general election, 1972|1972 election]], Rowling was appointed [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]]. This could be seen as a considerable promotion for someone without prior ministerial experience. Rowling's term as Minister of Finance was somewhat turbulent, with a number of formidable economic challenges arising during his tenure.

===Prime Minister===
{{main|Third Labour Government of New Zealand}}
When Norman Kirk died unexpectedly in 1974, [[Hugh Watt]], served as Acting Prime Minister for several days while the Labour Party chose a new leader. Rowling, Kirk's deputy, was the front-runner and replaced Kirk, although the party National Executive and the Federation of Labour preferred [[Hugh Watt]].<ref> Auckland Star 5 September 1974 p11 </ref>

Rowling was officially confirmed as party leader and [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|30th Prime Minister]] on 6 September 1974<ref>"Prime Minister Appointed" (6 September 1974) 87 ''[[The New Zealand Gazette]]'' 1899.</ref> taking the role of [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]]<ref>"Ministers Appointed" (10 September 1974) 88 ''[[New Zealand Gazette]]'' 1901.</ref> He had the option of replacing Kirk in the safe Labour seat of [[Sydenham (NZ electorate)|Sydenham]]<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Grant |first=David |title=The Mighty Totara: The life and times of Norman Kirk |year=2014 |publisher=[[Random House]] |location=Auckland |isbn=9781775535799}}p420 </ref>
but chose to remain in his (more marginal) home electorate of [[Tasman (NZ electorate)|Tasman]]

He was later appointed to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]].<ref>"Special Honours List" (26 September 1974) 93 ''[[New Zealand Gazette]]'' 2047.</ref> Unlike the [[pro-life]] Kirk and Muldoon, Rowling was [[pro-choice]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

As leader, Rowling was attacked by the opposition led by [[Robert Muldoon]], and was generally characterised as being weak. His supporters denied this, saying he chose not to participate in the confrontational and aggressive politics that Muldoon favoured.

===Leader of the Opposition===
The [[New Zealand general election, 1975|1975 election]] was a major defeat for the Labour Party. Labour also campaigned with the famous [[Citizens for Rowling]] <U+2013> prominent New Zealanders who backed Rowling. The campaign was labelled as being elitist, and was generally regarded as having backfired on Rowling.<ref name="henderson">''Rowling: The man and the myth'' by John Henderson, Australia New Zealand Press, 1980.</ref>

During the late 1970s, Rowling alienated Maori by removing [[Matiu Rata]], the party's effective and well-regarded Maori Affairs spokesman, from the Opposition front bench. Earlier, Rowling had replaced Rata with himself as convenor of Labour's Maori Affairs Committee. Mat Rata complained about the insensitivity of Labour's Maori policy<ref name="henderson" /> and went onto form his own party, [[Mana Motuhake]], a precursor to the [[M<U+0101>ori Party]].

His approach to the Moyle and O'Brien 'affairs' was regarded as heavy-handed and unnecessary in many circles. In regards to the 'Moyle affair', "it was Rowling who insisted that his close friend, [[Colin Moyle]], must resign".<ref name="henderson" /> Large numbers protested at the 1977 Labour Party Conference; many in the LGBT community never forgave him.<ref>see Henderson, p.&nbsp;167 for more on [[Gerald O'Brien]] and the O'Brien 'affair'</ref>

Rowling, however, managed to retain the party leadership, and gradually managed to improve public perceptions of him. In the [[New Zealand general election, 1978|1978]] and [[New Zealand general election, 1981|1981 election]]s, Labour actually secured more votes than the National Party but failed to gain a majority of seats.

While Rowling had largely managed to undo his negative image, many people in the Labour Party nevertheless believed that it was time for a change. In 1983 Rowling was replaced as leader by the charismatic [[David Lange]], who went on to defeat Muldoon in the [[New Zealand general election, 1984|1984 election]]. Rowling retired from parliament at the same election.

==Later life==
After leaving politics, Rowling was appointed Ambassador to the United States, serving from 1985 to 1988. He held that position when the issue of nuclear weapons and [[ANZUS]] flared up between the United States and New Zealand, and he travelled extensively across the country explaining the policy.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-wallace-rowling-1536763.html OBITUARY: Sir Wallace Rowling], ;;[[The Independent]]'', 1 November 1995</ref> Later, after returning to New Zealand, Rowling became highly involved in a number of community organizations and trusts. He also played a prominent role at the [[Museum of New Zealand]], and is considered to have been the "driving force" behind the eventual establishment of [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Te Papa]]. Honours that Rowling received include being made a Knight Commander of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]], an honorary law doctorate, and being made a Commander in the [[Order of Orange-Nassau|Orde van Oranje <U+2013> Nassau]] ([[Netherlands]]).

Rowling died of cancer in Nelson on 31 October 1995.
