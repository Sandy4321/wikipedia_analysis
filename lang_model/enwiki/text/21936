'''''The Night Battles: Witchcraft and Agrarian Cults in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries''''' is a [[history|historical]] study of the ''[[benandanti]]'' folk custom of 16th and 17th century [[Friuli]], Northeastern Italy. It was written by the Italian historian [[Carlo Ginzburg]], then of the [[University of Bologna]], and first published by the company [[Giulio Einaudi]] in 1966 under the Italian title of ''I Benandanti: Stregoneria e culti agrari tra Cinquecento e Seicento''.  It was later translated into English by John and Anne Tedeschi and published by [[Routledge|Routledge and Kegan Paul]] in 1983 with a new foreword written by the historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]].

In ''The Night Battles'', Ginzburg examines the trial accounts of those ''benandante'' who were interrogated and tried by the [[Roman Inquisition]], using such accounts to elicit evidence for the beliefs and practices of the ''benandanti''. These revolved around their nocturnal visionary journeys, during which they believed that their spirits traveled out of their bodies and into the countryside, where they would do battle with malevolent witches who threatened the local crops. Ginzburg goes on to examine how the Inquisition came to believe the ''benandanti'' to be witches themselves, and ultimately persecute them out of existence.

Considering the ''benandanti'' to be "a fertility cult", Ginzburg draws parallels with similar visionary traditions found throughout the Alps and also from the Baltic, such as that of the [[Thiess of Kaltenbrun|Livonian werewolf]], and also to the widespread folklore surrounding the [[Wild Hunt]]. He furthermore argues that these Late Medieval and Early Modern accounts represent surviving remnants of a pan-European, pre-Christian shamanistic belief concerning the fertility of the crops.

Academic reviews of ''The Night Battles'' were mixed.<ref name="Martin 615">[[#Mar92|Martin 1992]]. p. 615.</ref> Many reviewers argued that there was insufficient evidence to indicate that the ''benandanti'' represented a pre-Christian survival. Despite such criticism, Ginzburg would later return to the theories about a shamanistic substratum for his 1989 book ''[[Ecstasies (book)|Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath]]'', and it would also be adopted by historians like [[<U+00C9>va P<U+00F3>cs]], Gab<U+00F3>r Klaniczay, Claude Lecouteux and [[Emma Wilby]].

==Background==

In the Archepiscopal Archives of Udine, Ginzburg came across the 16th and 17th century trial records which documented the interrogation of several ''benandanti'' and other folk magicians.<ref name="Martin 613-614">[[#Mar92|Martin 1992]]. pp. 613&ndash;614.</ref> Historian John Martin of [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]] would later characterize this lucky find as the sort of "discovery most historians only dream of."<ref name="Martin 613-614"/>

Prior to Ginzburg's work, no scholars had investigated the benandanti, and those studies which had been made of Friulian folklore &ndash; by the likes of G. Marcotti, E. Fabris Bellavitis, V. Ostermann, A. Lazzarini and G. Vidossi &ndash; had all used the term "''benandante''" as if it had been synonymous with "witch". Ginzburg himself would note that this was not because of "neglect nor<U+2026> faulty analysis", but because in the recent oral history of the region, the two terms had become essentially synonymous.<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. p. xxi.</ref>

===English translation===
The translation of ''The Night Battles'' into English was undertaken by John and Anne Tedeschi, a couple who had previously produced the English translation for Ginzburg's 1976 book ''[[The Cheese and the Worms|The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller]]''. In their Translator's Note to the English edition, they proclaimed that they were "very pleased" to have been given the opportunity to translate the book, opining that Ginzburg's two works "represent only a small part of the best of the new social, cultural and religious history being written today by a host of distinguished Italian scholars." The Tedeschis went on to note that in translating ''The Night Battles'', they had decided to adopt the Italian terms ''benandante'' and ''benandanti'' (singular and plural respectively) rather than trying to translate such terms into English. As they noted, a "literal translation" of these words would have been "those who go well" or "good-doers", terms which they felt did not capture the original resonance of ''benandanti''. They also noted that in their translation they had used the term "witch" in the broader sense to refer to both males and females, but that when the Italian text specifically mentioned ''strega'' and ''stregone'' they rendered them as "witch" and "warlock".<ref>[[#Ted83|Tedeschi and Tedeschi 1983]]. pp. xi&ndash;xii.</ref>

The English translation included a foreword by the prominent English historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] (1917&ndash;), in which he argued that the "real interest in [Ginzburg's] extremely interesting book" lay not in its discussion of shamanistic visionary traditions, but in its study of how the Roman Catholic Church intervened in "traditional peasant practices" and warped them to fit their own ideas about witchcraft. He went on to note that ''The Night Battles'' should "fascinate and stimulate all historians of the popular mind."<ref>[[#Hob83|Hobsbawm 1983]]. pp. ix&ndash;x.</ref>

==Synopsis==
''The Night Battles'' is divided into a series of four chapters, preceded by a preface written by Ginzburg himself. In this preface, Ginzburg discusses the various scholarly approaches that have been taken to studying Early Modern witchcraft, such as the rationalist interpretation that emerged in the 18th century and the [[Witch-cult hypothesis]] presented by [[Margaret Murray]]. He then proceeds to offer an introduction to the benandanti, and then thanks those who have helped him in producing his study.<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. xvii&ndash;xxii.</ref>

}}
The first part of ''The Night Battles'' deals primarily with the accounts of two benandante who were interrogated and sentenced for heresy by the Roman Inquisition between 1575 and 1582. These two figures, [[Benandanti#Sgabarizza's investigation: 1575|Paulo Gaspurotto]] of the village of Iassaco and Battista Moduco of the town of [[Cividale del Friuli|Cividale]], first came under investigation from the priest Don Bartolomeo Sgabarizza in 1575. Although Sgabarizza later abandoned his investigations, in 1580 the case was picked up again by the Inquisitor Fra Felice da Montefalco, who interrogated both Gaspurotto and Moduco until they admitted that they had been deceived by the Devil into going on their nocturnal spirit journeys. In 1581 they were sentenced to six months imprisonment for heresy, a punishment that was later remitted.<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 1&ndash;14.</ref>

Ginzburg then goes on to look at the claims of Gaspurotto and Moduco in greater detail, noting that at "this period the benandanti constituted, as we perceive from their confessions, a true and proper sect... The members of this sect (who were dispersed throughout the Friuli, and especially in the eastern sections) were principally united by a common element, that of having been born with a [[caul]]".<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. p. 15.</ref> He proceeds to examine the trances that the benandanti went into in order to go on their nocturnal spirit journeys, debating whether these visions could have been induced by the use of special psychoactive ointments or by [[epilepsy]], ultimately arguing that neither offer a plausible explanation in light of the historical evidence at hand.<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 16&ndash;20.</ref> Following on from this, Ginzburg looks at the agricultural elements to the benandanti's battles with their satanic opponents, arguing that their clashes represent an "agricultural rite" that symbolized the forces of famine fighting the forces of plenty. He suspected that this was a survival from an "older fertility rite" that had originated in pre-Christian Europe but which had subsequently been Christianized.<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 22&ndash;26.</ref> He then goes on to examine the Early Modern accounts of aspects of popular belief across Europe that were similar to those of the benandanti. In particular he highlights the alleged cult of the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] that was recorded in late 15th century [[Modena]] and the case of the [[Thiess of Kaltenbrun|Livonian werewolf]] which occurred in 1692. Ginzburg ultimately argued that these scattered visionary traditions represented surviving elements of a pan-central European agrarian cult that had predated Christianization.<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 27&ndash;32.</ref>

===Part II: The Processions of the Dead===
In the second part of ''The Night Battles'', Ginzburg turns his attention toward those Early Modern Alpine traditions dealing with nocturnal processions of the dead. He initially discusses the [[Benandanti#Anna la Rossa and Donna Aquilina|interrogation of Anna la Rossa]], a self-confessed [[spirit medium]] who was brought before the Roman Inquisition in Friuli in 1582, before detailing two similar cases that took place later that year, that of Donna Aquilina and Caterina la Guercia. The latter of these women claimed that her deceased husband had been a ''benandante'', and that he had gone on a "procession with the dead", but none of them described themselves as being ''benandante''.<ref name="Ginzburg 33-39">[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 33&ndash;39.</ref>

Ginzburg then looks at the ''[[Canon Episcopi]]'', a 9th-century document that denounced those women who believed that they went on nocturnal processions with the goddess Diana; the ''Canon'''s author had claimed that they were deceived by the Devil, but Ginzburg argues that it reflects a genuine folk belief of the period. He connects this account with the many other European myths surrounding the [[Wild Hunt]] or Furious Horde, noting that in those in central Europe, the name of Diana was supplanted by that of [[Holda]] or [[Perchta]]. Ginzburg then highlights the 11th century account produced by French Bishop [[William of Auvergne (bishop)|William of Auvergne]], in which he had described a folk belief surrounding a female divinity named Abundia or Satia, who in William's opinion was a disguised devil. According to William's account, this creature travelled through houses and cellars at night, accompanied by her followers, where they would eat or drink whatever they found; Ginzburg noted parallels with the ''benandanti'' belief that witches would drink all of the water in a house.<ref name="Ginzburg 40-41">[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 40&ndash;41.</ref>

[I]t seems possible to establish the existence of a thread linking the various pieces of evidence that have been examined thus far: the presence of groups of individuals &ndash; generally women &ndash; who during the Ember Days fell into swoons and remained unconscious for brief periods of time during which, they affirmed, their souls left their bodies to join the processions of the dead (which were almost always nocturnal) presided over at least in one case by a female divinity (Fraw Selga). We have also seen that these processions were linked to an older and even more widely diffused myth, that of the 'Wild Hunt'. It was precisely these elements that reappeared, as we shall see more clearly, in the confessions of the female Friulian benandanti."

}}

Ginzburg highlights more evidence of the Wild Hunt folk motif in the Late Medieval accounts of the Dominican monk [[Johannes Nider]]. Nader related that certain women believed that they were transported to the conventicles of the goddess [[Herodias]] on the Ember Days, something which the monk attributed to the trickery of the Devil. Proceeding with his argument, Ginzburg describes an account by the chaplain Matthias von Kemnat, who recorded the persecution of a sect at [[Heidelberg]] circa 1475. According to Kemnat, this sect contained women who believed that they "travelled" during the Ember Days and cast non-fatal spells on men.<ref name="Ginzburg 42-43">[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 42&ndash;43.</ref> Ginzburg then turns his attention to a work of the early 16th century, ''Die Emeis'', written by the Swiss preacher [[Johann Geiler von Kaisersberg]]. In this account, Geiler refers to those people who went on nocturnal visits to see Fraw Fenus (Venus), including those women who fell into a swoon on the Ember Days, and who described a visit to Heaven after they had awoken.<ref name="Ginzburg 44-45">[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 44&ndash;45.</ref>

In further search of references to processions of the dead in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe, Ginzburg then highlights a 1489 trial of the weaver Giuliano Verdana held in [[Mantua]] and the 1525 trial of a woman named Wyprat Musin in [[Burseberg]], in both of which the defendant claimed to have seen a procession of dead spirits led by a female figure.<ref name="Ginzburg 49-51">[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 49&ndash;51.</ref> This is then followed by a discussion of the case of German herdsman Chonrad Stoecklin, who recounted visionary experiences in 1587 before being condemned as a witch.<ref name="Ginzburg 52-53">[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 52&ndash;53.</ref> Following on from this, Ginzburg discussed the existence of ''clerici vagantes'' who were recorded as travelling around the Swabian countryside in 1544, performing folk magic and claiming that they could conjure the Furious Horde.<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. p. 55.</ref> Ginzburg then discusses the case of Diel Breull, a German sorcerer who was tried in [[Hesse]] in 1630; Breull had claimed that on a visionary journey he encountered Fraw Holt, who revealed that he was a member of her nocturnal band.<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 56&ndash;57.</ref>

Ginzburg then makes comparisons between the ''benandanti'' and the ''[[Perchtenlaufen]]'', an Alpine ceremony in which two masked groups of peasants battled one another with sticks, one dressed to appear ugly and the other to appear beautiful.<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 57&ndash;58.</ref> Debating as to whether the traditions surrounding the processions of the dead originated in Germanic or Slavic Europe, Ginzburg then goes on to discuss the significance of the [[caul]] in ''benandanti'' belief.<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 58&ndash;61.</ref>

==Arguments==
===The witch trials===
In his original Italian preface, Ginzburg noted that historians of Early Modern witchcraft had become "accustomed" to viewing the confessions of accused witches as being "the consequences of torture and of suggestive questioning by the judges".<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. p. xvii.</ref>

===The nature of the benandanti===
In Ginzburg's analysis, the ''benandanti'' were a "fertility cult" whose members were "defenders of harvests and the fertility of fields."<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. p. xx.</ref>

===A pan-European fertility cult===

Ginzburg argues that the benandanti fertility cult was connected to "a larger complex of traditions" that were spread "from [[Alsace]] to [[Hesse]] and from [[Bavaria]] to [[Switzerland]]", all of which revolved around "the myth of nocturnal gatherings" presided over by a goddess figure, varyingly known as [[Perchta]], [[Holda]], [[Abundia]], [[Satia]], [[Herodias]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] or [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. He also noted that "almost identical" beliefs could be found in [[Livonia]] (modern Latvia and Estonia), and that because of this geographic spread "it may not be too daring to suggest that in antiquity these beliefs may once have covered much of central Europe."<ref>[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. xx, 44.</ref>

===Relationship to Margaret Murray's theories===
In the first part of the 20th century, the English Egyptologist and anthropologist [[Margaret Murray]] (1863&ndash;1963) had published several papers and books propagating a variation of the [[Witch-cult hypothesis]], through which she claimed that the Early Modern witch trials had been an attempt by the Christian authorities to wipe out a pre-existing, pre-Christian religion focused around the veneration of a [[horned god]] whom the Christians had demonised as the Devil. Although gaining some initial support from various historians, her theories were always controversial, coming under early criticism from experts in the Early Modern witch trials and pre-Christian religion. Eventually, her ideas came to be completely rejected within the academic historical community, although were adopted by occultists like [[Gerald Gardner]] (1884&ndash;1964) who used them as a historical basis in his creation of the [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Pagan]] religion of [[Wicca]].

What had been lacking then, and the need persists today if I<U+2019>m not mistaken, was an all-encompassing explanation of popular witchcraft: and the thesis of the English scholar, purified of its most daring affirmations, seemed plausible where it discerned in the orgies of the sabbat the deformation of an ancient fertility rite."

}}

The "definitive collapse of faith" in the theories of Margaret Murray among academics occurred in the 1970s, when it was attacked by two British historians, [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and [[Norman Cohn]], who pointed out her methodological flaws. At the same time, a variety of scholars across Europe and North America &ndash; such as [[Alan Macfarlane]], Erik Midelfort, William Monter, Robert Muchembled, Gerhard Schormann, Bente Alver and Bengt Ankarloo &ndash; began to publish in-depth studies into the archival records of the witch trials, leaving no doubt that "the people tried for witchcraft in early modern Europe were not practitioners of a surviving pagan religion."<ref>[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 362.</ref>

In the original Italian preface to the book, published in 1966, Ginzburg discussed the work of Murray, claiming that although it contained "a kernal of truth", it had been "formulated in a wholly uncritical way", containing "serious defects".<ref name="Ginzburg xix"/> With the complete academic rejection of Murray's theories in the 1970s, Ginzburg attempted to clarify his work's relationship to Murray's Witch-Cult theory in his "Preface to the English Edition", written in 1982. Here, he expressly stated that "Murray, in fact, asserted: (a) that witchcraft had its roots in an ancient fertility cult, and (b) that the sabbat described in the witchcraft trials referred to gatherings which had actually taken place. What my work really demonstrated, even if unintentionally, was simply the first point."<ref name="Ginzburg xiii">[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. p. xiii.</ref> He proceeded to accept that although he ultimately rejected her ideas, he reiterated that there was a "kernel of truth" in Murray's thesis.<ref name="Ginzburg xiii"/>

The historian Ronald Hutton, in discussing Ginzburg's ideas in both ''The Night Battles'' and his later ''Ecstasies'', noted that Ginzburg's argument, that "ancient dream-worlds, or operations on non-material planes of consciousness, helped to create a new set of fantasies at the end of the Middle Ages", was actually "pretty well the opposite" of what Murray had been arguing.<ref>[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 378.</ref>

==Reception==
Most scholars in the English-speaking world could not read Italian, meaning that when ''I Benandanti'' was first published in 1966, the information which it contained remained out of the grasp of the majority of historians studying Early Modern witchcraft in the United States. In order to learn about the ''benandanti'', these scholars therefore had to rely on the English-language book review produced by the witchcraft historian [[William Monter]], who did read Italian.<ref name="Hutton 276"/>

===Ronald Hutton's critique===
[[File:JamesGeorgeFrazer.jpg|thumb|right|Ronald Hutton asserted that Ginzburg's approach in ''The Night Battles'' was "heavily Frazerian", being based on the theories of Scottish anthropologist Sir James Frazer (1854&ndash;1941), themselves widely discredited in the field of anthropology.<ref name="Hutton 276">[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 276.</ref>]]
In ''[[The Triumph of the Moon]]'', his 1999 work examining the development of [[Wicca|contemporary Pagan Witchcraft]], the English historian [[Ronald Hutton]] (1953&ndash;) of the [[University of Bristol]] asserted that Ginzburg was "a world-class historian" and a "brilliant maverick".<ref>[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 377.</ref> Hutton was of the opinion that Ginzburg's work on ''The Night Battles'' offered "an important and enduring contribution to the study of history", but that Ginzburg's claim that the visionary traditions of the ''benandanti'' were a survival from earlier, pre-Christian practices, was something that rested on "imperfect material and conceptual foundations."<ref>[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 278.</ref> Explaining his reasoning, Hutton remarked that "dreams do not self-evidently constitute rituals, and shared dream-imagery does not constitute a 'cult'," before going on to note that Ginzburg's "assumption" that "what was being dreamed about in the sixteenth century had in fact been acted out in religious ceremonies" dating to "pagan times", was entirely "an inference of his own, representing a striking late application of what anthropologists had come to characterize, and abandon, as 'the ritual theory of myth', one associated especially with [[Jane Ellen Harrison]]'s 'Cambridge group' half a century before, and with [[Sir James Frazer]]."<ref>[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 277.</ref>
