'''Pam Ann''' is the alter ego of Australian comedian [[Caroline Reid]]. An emerging icon in [[gay]] [[culture]], she portrays the air-[[hostess]] Pam Ann, a mixture of [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], [[camp (style)|camp]] and [[glamour]], and a pun on the legendary airline [[Pan Am]]. Reid as Pam Ann can be seen on tour in the [[United Kingdom]] as well as the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]], she also has a guest-role in the [[BBC]] show ''[[Fasttrack]]''.  She also frequently conducts shows in major cities in the [[USA]], [[Canada]] and her native [[Australia]].

Performances tend to emphasise the vagaries of [[air travel]], including the identifying quirks of various [[airlines]] around the world, mixed with a generous dose of ribald humour and [[double entendre]]. Reid often caters to airline employees and frequent travellers in her audience, directly involving them in the performance.

She has drawn criticism for some of her performances, particularly one in which she poked fun at the [[SQ 006]] air crash disaster.

In 2006, [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]] gave some thought to using Pam Ann for their pre-flight Passenger Safety videos, in a bid to keep passengers attention during what is ordinarily a boring (albeit essential) part of everyday flying. However it was decided she may divert attention away from the actual message.
