The '''Luxor Las Vegas''' is a [[hotel]] and [[casino]] located on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]].  It was one of the city's first fully-themed mega-resorts. Ground was broken for the Luxor in 1991, that same year construction began on the [[Treasure Island Hotel and Casino|Treasure Island]] and the current [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]].  It has a pyramid and modern motif and contains a total of 4,407 rooms lining the interior walls of a hollow [[pyramid]] and contained within twin [[ziggurat]] towers that were built as later additions.  The hotel is named after the city of [[Luxor]] (ancient [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]]) in [[Egypt]], the site of the [[Valley of the Kings]], [[Karnak]] and [[Luxor Temple]]s, and scores of other pharaonic monuments&mdash;but no pyramids.

In July 2007, owner [[MGM Mirage]] announced plans to thoroughly renovate the Luxor, spending $300 million to remodel 80 percent of Luxor's public areas, removing much of the ancient Egyptian theme and replacing it with more adult-oriented and modern lounges, restaurants and clubs.<ref name=RJ071207>Howard Stutz, [http://www.lvrj.com/business/8451727.html Luxor's New Look: Farewell to Egypt], ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'', July 12, 2007.</ref> Among the distinctive changes to the exterior occurred in mid-2007, when management covered one of the pyramid's massive black faces with a 15-story sign that advertises [[Absolut Vodka]]. On June 16, 2008 the sign was taken down.

== Location and history ==
The Luxor is located on the southern end of the [[Las Vegas Strip]], opposite the [[McCarran International Airport]]. The resort is flanked by the [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino|Mandalay Bay]] to the south and by the [[Excalibur Hotel and Casino|Excalibur]] to the north; all three are connected by free express and local [[trams]]. All three properties were built by Circus Circus Enterprises, which later became [[Mandalay Resort Group]].

When it opened on October 15, 1993, the pyramid was the tallest building on the strip;<ref> [http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/25575 Benston, Liz, Pyramid-shaped Luxor hotel sheds its Egyptian image, Scripps News, 7/24/07]</ref> it cost $375 million to build.<ref name=RJ071207>Howard Stutz, [http://www.lvrj.com/business/8451727.html Luxor's New Look: Farewell to Egypt], ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'', July 12, 2007 .</ref>  A theater and two additional hotel towers totaling 2,000 rooms were added in 1998 for $675 million.<ref name=RJ071207>Howard Stutz, [http://www.lvrj.com/business/8451727.html Luxor's New Look: Farewell to Egypt], ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'', July 12, 2007 .</ref>  In June 2004, the Mandalay Resort Group was purchased by [[MGM Mirage]], adding this hotel to its vast array of properties on the "Strip".  

When the resort opened, it featured a more heavily Egyptian-themed interior, including a river that encircled the casino with a ferry that would carry guests to different parts of the pyramid. After guests complained that the ferry service took too long, it was turned into the Nile River Tour, a river ride that passed by many pieces of ancient artwork. Most of the ancient Egypt theme and the river ride were taken away as part of a campaign to tailor the property towards more upscale tastes in 1995. According to the unofficial, albeit popular, [[ghost story]], the Nile River attraction was removed because guests kept seeing ghosts of the three workers killed during the Luxor's construction whenever the river passed through dark tunnels. {{citation}}

The resort has been home to some popular entertainment attractions in the Las Vegas area. The main level featured the nightclub,  [[Ra|RA]], which closed indefinitely on July 22, 2006. From 2000 to 2005, the Luxor Theatre was the home of the enormously popular performance-art show [[Blue Man Group]], which has since moved to [[The Venetian (Las Vegas)|The Venetian]]. On February 15, 2006, the main theater became the home of the musical [[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]] which ran until 2006.

In 2006, MGM-Mirage began renovating Luxor. Rooms in the East and West Towers have been refurnished. Two upscale restaurants, Isis and Sacred Sea Room, closed. This space became CatHouse. The RA nightclub, which had previously been one of the most successful in the city but had been seeing reduced attendance in recent years, was shuttered. Replacing it is the Las Vegas branch of [http://www.laxthenightclub.com/ LAX], a [[Los Angeles]] nightclub, which opened on August 31, 2007, in an event hosted by [[Britney Spears]]. The Luxor Steakhouse was renovated and reopened as Tender Steak & Seafood. The former arcade space is now used to host a human bodies exhibition, and the [[IMAX]] theater is being renovated to host an exhibition on the [[RMS Titanic]].

Illusionist [[Criss Angel]] signed a deal in 2006 to tape episodes of his TV series Mindfreak at the hotel. Angel currently has a production office and store in the Luxor. In 2008, Criss Angel starred in a new magic-themed [[Cirque du Soleil]] production at Luxor.<ref>[http://www.happynews.com/news/3222007/magician-criss-angel-new-cirque-show.htm Magician Criss Angel in New Cirque Show<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===2007 explosion incident===
On May 7, 2007, the Luxor Hotel parking garage was the site of a vehicle explosion which killed one of its employees. Local authorities believe the victim, who worked in a business inside the hotel, was the target for this killing. The hotel was not evacuated, and the parking structure where the explosion occurred suffered no damage. Investigations into this incident are ongoing. The explosion is believed to be caused by a homemade bomb. <ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-05-07-vegas-explosion_N.htm 1 dead in casino parking lot explosion - USATODAY.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Design==
[[Image:USA.NV.LasVegas.Luxor.02.jpg|thumb|left|Sphinx guarding the hotel entrance]]
The Luxor is among the most recognizable hotels on the strip because of its striking design.  Designed by hotel architect [[Veldon Simpson]], the main portion of the hotel is a {{convert|350|ft|m|sing=on}}-high (106 m), 30-story pyramid of black glass (in comparison, the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] with original capstone topped out at 481 ft). The footprint of the pyramid is a 556-foot square. The hotel is marked by a large [[obelisk]] with the name of the property in lighted letters, while the [[porte-cochere]] travels underneath a massive recreation of the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]].  The pyramid was originally conceived with a tram connecting the north side of the hotel with the neighboring Excalibur Hotel and Casino. This was soon removed for later property changes.  A second tram linkage now connects the east-facing porte-cochere with both the Excalibur and Mandalay Hotel and Casino. The pyramid is clad in very dark bronze glass, which appears black on clear days and a dark, golden-bronze on overcast days.  There are 30 guest-room floors, six higher service floors (including the SkyBeam lamp room) and a large sublevel (originally site of the King Tut museum). Many of the original aesthetics of the external property have been eliminated. The original front water and laser show was the first to succumb.  The laser show was stopped due to complaints of stray beams illuminating aircraft on approach to the very nearby international airport.  The fountains themselves were removed and replaced by a parking lot and the new tram station.  The tram station and tracks hinder the views of the pyramid tower from the strip.  The pyramid tower is also rather lost to view as it has been surrounded by the large East/West Towers, the two Mandalay Bay towers and the large auditorium on the SW side.  The pyramid tower has also been transformed into a four-sided billboard (with three sides in use as of 3-09) for advertisements. Additionally, the Starlight Lighting System - a nightly remote-controlled show of lights along the pyramids corners powered by thousands of circuit boards and computer chips - was scaled back tremendously as it was plagued by faulty equipment and power shutdowns.  

[[Image:LuxorLight.jpg|thumb|right|The light of the Luxor]]
The tip of the pyramid contains a fixed-position [[Searchlight|spotlight]] that points directly upward and is claimed to be the brightest beam in the world at over 7 million [[candle power]].<ref name=Luxor>{{Cite web |url=http://www.luxor.com/attractions/attractions_property_highlights.aspx |title=Property Highlights - Stairway To The Stars |accessdate=09 January 2009|author=MGM Mirage |date=2009|publisher=[[MGM Mirage]]}}</ref> It is visible from anywhere in the Las Vegas valley at night, and can be seen at flight level from above [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], over 275 miles (440 km) away. At ground level, on clear nights, the beam could also be seen as far south as [[Laughlin, Nevada|Laughlin]] and even as far north as [[Mesquite, Nevada|Mesquite]] or [[Beatty, Nevada|Beatty]]. The beam is visible straight ahead when driving northbound on [[US 93 (AZ)|US 93]] in Arizona, north of [[Kingman, Arizona|Kingman]] before reaching [[Hoover Dam]]. In the spring, the bright light attracts huge numbers of [[moth]]s into the light beam, creating a phenomenon that has been likened to snow. Light is generated using 39 [[Xenon arc lamp|Xenon]] arc lamps of 7 [[Watt|kilowatts]] each. When turned on, the lamps heat up to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The hourly cost, including lamps, electricity, and repairs, is [[United States Dollar|US$]]51 &mdash; roughly two weeks' worth of electricity for the average American household.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/basics/quickelectric.html]</ref> Hotel engineers, as well as the hotel's own website also claim that the light can be observed from space. <ref name=Luxor/>

==Guest rooms and attractions==
[[Image:Inside Luxor 1.jpg|thumb|left|The view inside the Luxor.  The large black shape is the IMAX theater.]]
The guest rooms are situated on the outer walls of the pyramid and are reached by riding in so-called "inclinators" that travel along the inner surface of the pyramid at a 39-degree angle.  Open hallways leading to the rooms overlook the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], which is the largest in the world at 29 million cubic feet (820,000 m<U+00B3>).

An IMAX theater (the third such theater in Las Vegas, although in 1979, Caesars Palace opened an Omnimax Theater, the precursor to IMAX<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/07/30/PKG5JK1DE01.DTL&feed=rss.entertainment|title=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/07/30/PKG5JK1DE01.DTL&feed=rss.entertainment}}</ref>) was closed in 2008; but there is also an IMAX motion simulator ride hosting a variety of rides, including "In Search of the Obelisk," which takes participants into a virtual archeological dig and [[ReBoot]], based on the [[animated series]].  The newest attraction on the Atrium level is BODIES... The Exhibition which opened on August 2, 2008. The "Atrium Showroom" is home to multiple shows: "Fantasy" (a topless [[revue]]), comedian [[Carrot Top]], and the movie/attraction "[[Pirates 4D]]".  The attractions level also featured the "King Tut Museum", an authentic replica of [[KV62|the tomb of]] [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]].  The reproduction was based directly on the descriptions of the tomb recorded by [[Howard Carter (archaeologist)|Howard Carter]], who discovered it in 1922. 

Luxor's most recent live show is "Criss Angel: Believe", a collaboration between magician [[Criss Angel]] and [[Cirque du Soleil]] that began in late 2008 and is set to run for 10 years.

On August 31 2007, LAX Nightclub officially opened for Labor Day weekend. [[Britney Spears]] was the host, who appeared alongside [[Nicky Hilton]] and others. Around 4000 people attended, some who never even entered the nightclub. [[Christina Aguilera]] also hosted an event on September 8, 2007.

==Usage in popular culture ==
This [[destination hotel]] is commonly viewed as one of the finest examples of 1990s [[Postmodern architecture]], and appeared on the cover of architecture scholar James Steele's book ''Architecture Today''.

A copy of the Luxor, named "The Camel's Toe", appeared in the [[Las Venturas]] area of the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' but the hotel it was copied from did not open until 1993, the game is set in 1992''.

A portion of the 1998 music video "[[Gettin' Jiggy wit It]]" by [[Will Smith]] was shot in the foyer of the hotel.

''[[Criss Angel Mindfreak]]'' Seasons Three & Four were taped at the Luxor, and [[Criss Angel]] once lived in a penthouse suite directly beneath the famous light. He also has his own Official Mindfreak merchandise store and production studio. In one episode, he [[levitation|levitated]] {{convert|500|ft|m}} above the light.

Some stunts on ''[[Fear Factor]]'' were held at the Luxor, including sliding down the exterior.

The hotel also appeared prominently in the 1996 film ''[[Mars Attacks!]]''.

This hotel was featured in the popular series, ''[[Great Hotels]]''.

In the cult horror-comedy novel ''[[John Dies at the End]]'' by David Wong, a supernatural battle between good and evil takes place in the Luxor.
