Ahtisaari was a [[United Nations Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo|United Nations Special Envoy for Kosovo]], charged with organizing [[Kosovo status process]] negotiations, aimed at resolving a long-running dispute in [[Kosovo]], which declared its [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|independence]] from [[Serbia]] in 2008. In October 2008, he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] "for his efforts on several continents and over more than three decades, to resolve international conflicts".<ref name="nobelprize1">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2008/ 2008 Nobel Peace Prize]</ref> The Nobel statement said that Ahtisaari has played a prominent role in resolving many conflicts in Namibia; Aceh, Indonesia;<ref name=yle01>[http://yle.fi/uutiset/ahtisaari_tuomioja_haavisto_weigh_in_on_syria/62423931 "Ahtisaari, Tuomioja, Haavisto weigh in on Syria"], ''yle.fi'', 3 August 2012.

== Youth and early career ==
Martti Ahtisaari was born in [[Viipuri]], Finland (now [[Vyborg]], Russia). His father, Oiva Ahtisaari (whose grandfather Julius Marenius Adolfsen had emigrated with his parents to Finland in 1872 from [[Tistedalen]] in Southern Norway) took Finnish [[citizenship]] in 1929 and changed his surname from Adolfsen in 1937. The [[Continuation War]] (World War II) took Martti's father to the front as an [[non-commissioned officer|NCO]] army mechanic, while his mother, Tyyne, moved to [[Kuopio]] with her son to escape immediate danger from the war.<ref name=geneologiafi>[http://www.genealogia.fi/vsk/44/v8-28.pdf President Ahtisaari's ancestors] a study by [[Suomen Sukututkimusseura]] (the Finnish [[genealogy]] [[society]]).</ref> Kuopio was where Ahtisaari spent most of his childhood, eventually attending the Kuopion Lyseo high school.

In 1952, Martti Ahtisaari moved to [[Oulu]] with his family to seek employment. There he continued his education in [[Oulun Lyseon Lukio|high school]], graduating in 1952. He also joined the local [[YMCA]]. After completing his military service (Ahtisaari holds the rank of [[Captain (Land)|captain]] in the [[Finnish Army]] Reserve), he began to study through a distance-learning course at Oulu teachers' college. He was able to live at home while attending the two-year course which enabled him to qualify as a primary-school teacher in 1959. Besides his native language, Finnish, Ahtisaari speaks Swedish, French, English, and German.

In 1960, he moved to [[Karachi]], Pakistan, to lead the YMCA's [[physical education]] training establishment, where he became accustomed to a more international environment. In addition to managing the students' home, Ahtisaari's job involved training teachers. He returned to Finland in 1963, and became active in [[non-governmental organizations]] responsible for aid to developing countries. He joined the international students' organization [[AIESEC]], where he discovered new passions about diversity and diplomacy. In 1965, he joined the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland in its Bureau for International Development Aid, eventually becoming the assistant head of the department. In 1968, he married Eeva Irmeli Hyv<U+00E4>rinen (1936<U+2013>). The couple has one son, [[Marko Ahtisaari]], a noted musician and producer.

== Diplomatic career ==
Ahtisaari spent several years as a [[diplomat]]ic representative from Finland. From 1977 to 1981, he served as [[United Nations Commissioner for Namibia]], working to secure the independence of [[Namibia]] from the Republic of [[South Africa]].

Following the death of a later UN Commissioner for Namibia, [[Bernt Carlsson]], on [[Pan Am Flight 103]] on 21 December 1988&nbsp;<U+2013> on the eve of the signing of the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|Tripartite Accord]] at [[United Nations Headquarters|UN Headquarters]]&nbsp;<U+2013> Ahtisaari was sent to [[Namibia]] in April 1989 as the [[Special Representative of the Secretary-General|UN Special Representative]] to head the [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group]] (UNTAG). Because of the illegal incursion of [[SWAPO]] troops from [[Angola]], the South African appointed Administrator-General (AG), [[Louis Pienaar]], sought Ahtisaari's agreement to the deployment of [[SADF]] troops to stabilize the situation. Ahtisaari took advice from British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who was visiting the region at the time, and approved the SADF deployment. A period of intense fighting ensued when at least 375 SWAPO insurgents were killed.<ref>[[History of Namibia#Independence|Shaky start on the road to independence]]</ref> In July 1989, [[Glenys Kinnock]] and [[Tessa Blackstone]] of the [[British Council of Churches]] visited Namibia and reported: "There is a widespread feeling that too many concessions were made to South African personnel and preferences and that Martti Ahtisaari was not forceful enough in his dealings with the South Africans."<ref>{{cite book
|title=Namibia: Birth of a Nation
|author=[[Glenys Kinnock]]
|publisher=Quartet Books Ltd
|year=1990
|page=19
}}</ref>

Perhaps because of his reluctance to authorise this [[SADF]] deployment, Ahtisaari was alleged to have been targeted by the [[South Africa]]n [[Civil Cooperation Bureau]] (CCB). According to a hearing in September 2000 of the South African [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], two CCB operatives (Kobus le Roux and Ferdinand Barnard) were tasked not to kill Ahtisaari, but to give him "a good hiding". To carry out the assault, Barnard had planned to use the grip handle of a metal saw as a knuckleduster. In the event, Ahtisaari did not attend the meeting at the Keetmanshoop Hotel, where Le Roux and Barnard lay in wait for him, and thus Ahtisaari escaped injury.<ref>http://www.doj.gov.za./trc/amntrans/2000/200928ct.htm</ref>

After the independence elections of 1989, Ahtisaari was appointed an honorary Namibian citizen. South Africa gave him the [[Oliver Tambo|O R Tambo]] award for "his outstanding achievement as a diplomat and commitment to the cause of freedom in Africa and peace in the world".<ref>[http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/orders_list.asp?show=226 Outstanding achievement award]</ref>

Ahtisaari served as UN undersecretary general for administration and management from 1987 to 1991 causing mixed feelings inside the organization during an internal investigation of massive fraud. When Ahtisaari revealed in 1990 that he had secretly lengthened the grace period allowing UN officials to return misappropriated taxpayer money from the original three months to three years, the investigators were furious. The 340 officials found guilty of fraud were able to return money even after their crime had been proven. The harshest punishment was the firing of twenty corrupt officials.<ref name="Sainio">Sainio, Pentti: Operaatio Ahtisaari. Art House, 1993</ref><ref>The Independent On Sunday, 1991 May 19</ref>

== President of Finland ==
Ahtisaari's presidential campaign in Finland began when he was still a member of the council dealing with [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. Finland's ongoing [[recession]] caused established political figures to lose public support, and the [[presidential elections]] were now direct, instead of being conducted through an [[electoral college]]. In 1993, Ahtisaari accepted the candidacy of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]]. His politically untarnished image was a major factor in the election, as was his vision of Finland as an active participant in international affairs. Ahtisaari narrowly won over his second round opponent, [[Elisabeth Rehn]] of the [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]].  During the campaign, there were rumours spread by some political opponents of Ahtisaari that he had a drinking problem or that he had knowingly accepted a double salary from the Finnish Foreign Ministry and from the United Nations while trying to negotiate an end to the Bosnian War. Ahtisaari denied both allegations and no firm proof of them has emerged.  During the three-week campaign between the two rounds of presidential elections, Ahtisaari was praised by his supporters for being more compassionate towards the many unemployed Finns than Rehn, who as Defence Minister had to officially support the Aho government's strict economic policies.  A minor scandal arose during a town hall-style presidential debate in [[Lappeenranta]], southeastern Finland, when an apparently born-again Christian woman in the audience asked Rehn what her relationship with Jesus was.  Rehn replied that she had personally no proof that Jesus had been a historical person.  Ahtisaari ducked a precise answer by stating that he trusted the Lutheran confession even on this issue.<ref name="MMM1995">Mit<U+00E4> Miss<U+00E4> Milloin&nbsp;<U+2014> Kansalaisen vuosikirja 1995 ("What Where When&nbsp;<U+2014> Citizen's Yearbook 1995"), Helsinki:  Otava Publications Ltd., 1994.</ref><ref name="Snellman1994">Anja Snellman and Saska Saarikoski, "The Third Round" / Kolmas kierros, published in Finland in 1994.</ref><ref name="Sainio1993">Pertti Sainio, "Secret Operation Ahtisaari" / Operaatio Salainen Ahtisaari, published in Finland in 1993.</ref>

His term as president began with a schism within the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] government led by prime minister [[Esko Aho]], who did not approve of Ahtisaari's being actively involved in foreign policy. There was also some controversy over Ahtisaari's speaking out on domestic issues such as unemployment. He travelled extensively in Finland and abroad, and was nicknamed "Matka-Mara" (''"Travel-Mara,"'' Mara being a common diminutive form of Martti). His monthly travels throughout the country and his meetings with ordinary citizens (the so-called ''maakuntamatkat'' or "provincial trips") nonetheless greatly enhanced his political popularity. Ahtisaari kept his campaign promise to visit one Finnish historical province every month during his presidency.  He also donated some thousands of [[Finnish mark]]s per month to the unemployed people's organizations, and a few thousand Finnish marks to the Christian social organization of the late lay preacher and social worker [[Veikko Hursti]].<ref>Mit<U+00E4> Miss<U+00E4> Milloin&nbsp;<U+2014> Kansalaisen vuosikirjat 1995, 2000, 2001 ("What Where When&nbsp;<U+2014> Citizen's Yearbooks 1995, 2000, 2001")</ref><ref>Veikko Hursti, "For I Was Hungry ..." / Sill<U+00E4> minun oli n<U+00E4>lk<U+00E4> ... (autobiography), published in Finland in 1997.</ref>

Ahtisaari favoured pluralism and religious tolerance publicly. Privately, he and his wife practice their Christian faith. Contrary to some of his predecessors and his successor as the Finnish President, Ahtisaari ended all of his New
Year's speeches by wishing the Finnish people God's blessing.<ref>The speeches are available in electronic form from Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE's Living Archives, [http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/]</ref>

In January 1998 Ahtisaari was criticized by some NGOs, politicians and notable cultural figures because he awarded medals of honour to the Forest Minister of [[Indonesia]] and to the main owner of the Indonesian RGM Company, a parent company of the April Company. The April Company was criticized by non-governmental organizations for destroying [[rain forest]]s, and Indonesia itself was criticized heavily for human right violations, especially in [[East Timor]]. Ahtisaari's party chairman [[Erkki Tuomioja]] said that giving medals was questionable since he feared the act may tarnish the public image of Finnish human rights policy. Students of the arts had demonstrations in Helsinki against the decision to give medals.<ref>''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', kotimaa, 1998 January 15, p. 1, "Mielenosoitus: Kunniamerkit takaisin Indonesiasta".</ref><ref>''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', Talous, 2000 March 21, p. 3., "Ahtisaari saanee vastaehdokkaan UPM:n hallitus-vaaliin" (t<U+00E4>ss<U+00E4> jutussa on vain Luontoliiton osuus).</ref>

President Ahtisaari supported Finland's entry into the [[European Union]], and in a 1994 [[referendum]], 57 percent of Finnish voters were in favour of EU membership.<ref name="MMM1996">Mit<U+00E4> Miss<U+00E4> Milloin&nbsp;<U+2014> Kansalaisen vuosikirja 1996 ("What Where When&nbsp;<U+2014> Citizen's Yearbook 1996"), Helsinki: Otava Publications Ltd., 1995.</ref> During Ahtisaari's term as president, [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Bill Clinton]] met in [[Helsinki]]. He also negotiated alongside [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]] with [[Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]] to end the [[Kosovo War|fighting]] in the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] province of [[Kosovo]] in 1999.

Often encountering resistance from the Finnish [[parliament]], which preferred a more cautious foreign policy, as well as from within his own party, Ahtisaari did not seek re-election in 2000.  He wanted the Social Democrats to re-nominate him for the presidency without opposition, but two opponents signed up for the party's presidential primary.<ref name="MMM2000">Mit<U+00E4> Miss<U+00E4> Milloin&nbsp;<U+2014> Kansalaisen vuosikirja 2000 ("What Where When&nbsp;<U+2014> Citizen's Yearbook 2000"), Helsinki: Otava Publications Ltd., 1999.</ref> Ahtisaari was the last "strong president", since the [[Constitution of Finland|2000 constitution]] slightly reduced the president's powers. He was succeeded by the foreign minister [[Tarja Halonen]].

In Finnish politics, Ahtisaari has stressed how important it is for Finland [[Enlargement of NATO|to join NATO]].<ref>[http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2008/10/martti_ahtisaari_wants_finland_in_nato_355246.html Martti Ahtisaari Wants Finland in Nato]. YLE. 2008-10-11</ref> Ahtisaari has argued that Finland should be a full member of NATO and the EU in order "to shrug off once and for all the burden of [[Finlandization]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20031215IE6|title= Former President Ahtisaari: NATO membership would put an end to Finlandisation murmurs|work=Helsingin Sanomat|date=2003-12-15| accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref> He believes politicians should file application and make Finland a member.

Since leaving office, Ahtisaari has held positions in various international organizations. Ahtisaari also founded the independent [[Crisis Management Initiative]] (CMI) with the goal of developing and sustaining peace in troubled areas. On 1 December 2000, Ahtisaari was awarded the [[Fulbright Program#J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding|J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding]] by the Fulbright Association in recognition of his work as peacemaker in some of the world's most troubled areas.

In 2000<U+2013>01, Ahtisaari  and [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] inspected [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] weapons dumps for the [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning]], as part of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/decommission/iicdreports.htm#wi |title=Reports of the Weapons Inspectors|work=Reports and Statements by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD)|publisher=[[CAIN]]|accessdate=2008-10-11}}</ref>

In 2005, Ahtisaari  successfully led peace negotiations between the [[Free Aceh Movement]] (GAM) and the [[Indonesia]]n government through his non-governmental organization CMI. The negotiations ended on 15 August 2005 with the signing of the [http://www.aceh-mm.org/download/english/Helsinki%20MoU.pdf Helsinki MOU] on disarmament of GAM rebels, the dropping of GAM demands for an independent [[Aceh]], and a withdrawal of Indonesian forces.

In November 2005, [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] appointed Ahtisaari as Special Envoy for the [[Kosovo status process]] which was to determine whether Kosovo, having been administered by the United Nations since 1999, should become independent or remain a province of [[Serbia]]. In early 2006, Ahtisaari  opened the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo ([http://www.unosek.org UNOSEK]) in [[Vienna]], Austria, from where he conducted the Kosovo status negotiations. Those opposed to Ahtisaari's settlement proposal, which involved an internationally monitored independence for Kosovo, sought to discredit him. Allegations made by Balkan media sources of corruption and improper conduct by Ahtisaari were described by [[US State Department]] spokesman Tom Casey as "spurious", adding that Ahtisaari's plan is the "best solution possible" and has the "full endorsement of the United States".<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2007/jul/88362.htm US State Department press briefing]</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that this criticism of Ahtisaari on the part of the Serbs had led to the "bogging down" of the Kosovo status talks.<ref name=NYTimessept>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/02/world/europe/02kosovo.html?ex=1158984000&en=d4d08af1a6c4944b&ei=5070 ''The New York Times''&nbsp;<U+2013> Serbs Criticize UN Mediator, Further Bogging Down Kosovo Talks].</ref> In November 2008, Serbian media reported Pierre Mirel, director of the EU enlargement commission's western Balkans division as saying: "The EU has accepted that the deployment of [[EULEX]] has to be approved by the [[United Nations Security Council]], and that the mission has to be neutral and will not be related to the Ahtisaari plan," Mirel said, following his meeting with Serbia's vice-president [[Bozidar Djelic]].<ref>{{cite web

In July 2007, however, when the [[European Union|EU]], Russia and the United States agreed to find a new format for the talks, Ahtisaari announced that he regarded his mission as over. Since neither the UN nor the troika had asked him to continue mediations in the face of Russia's persistent refusal to support independence for Kosovo, he said he would nonetheless be willing to take on "a role as consultant", if requested.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2706414,00.html Contact Group Meets on Kosovo's Future as Tensions Rise]</ref> After a period of uncertainty and mounting tension, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia in February 2008.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-07-02-voa66.cfm US Pleased With Post-Independence Progress In Kosovo]</ref>

In his work, he has emphasised the importance of the United States in the peace process, stating that "There can be no peace without America."<ref>{{cite book|last=Cord|first=David J.|title=[[Mohamed 2.0: Disruption Manifesto|Mohamed 2.0]]|year=2012|publisher=Schildts & S<U+00F6>derstr<U+00F6>ms|location=Helsingfors|isbn=978-951-52-2898-7|pages=156}}</ref>

==Nobel Peace Prize ==

On 10 October 2008 Ahtisaari was announced as that year's recipient of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The award includes a medal, a personal diploma, and 10 million Swedish kronor ($1.4 million) in prize money. Ahtisaari received the prize on 10 December 2008 at [[Oslo City Hall]] in Norway.
