The '''Siege of Boston''' ([[April 19]], [[1775]] &ndash; [[March 17]], [[1776]]) was the opening phase of the [[American Revolutionary War]], in which [[New England]] militiamen<U+2014>and then the [[Continental Army]]<U+2014>surrounded the city of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], to prevent movement by the [[British Army]] [[garrison]]ed within. The Americans, led by [[George Washington]], eventually forced the British to withdraw from the city after an 11-month siege. It was the longest single conflict of the War.  

On [[April 20]], the militia surrounded the city on 3 sides, the only one remaining open being the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The [[Continental Congress]] chose to adopt the militia and form the [[Continental Army]]. They unanimously elected [[George Washington]] as Commander in Chief. In June of 1775, the British attempted seize Bunker and Breeds Hills, and did so, but the casualties they suffered were too heavy to continue the attack. For the rest of the siege, there was little action other than occasional raids and sniper fire. 

In the winter of 1775, Washington sent a 25 year-old bookseller turned soldier, named [[Henry Knox]], to take the artillery that had been captured at [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and bring it to Boston. In March, the artillery was put on [[Dorchester Heights]], and the British commander, [[William Howe]], knew he could not hold the city. He chose to evacuate it, on March 17.  

==Background==
The British had imposed taxes onto the Americans, which they did not take kindly to. After British forces were sent to take military supplies from the town of [[Concord]] on [[April 19]], [[1775]], the Massachuttes Militia [[Battle of Lexington and Concord|opposed them]] at [[Lexington]] and then at Concord.<ref>McCullough p.7</ref> At Concord, the British were stopped, forced back, and then were attacked on their retreat to Boston, suffering heavy casualties.

On April 20, The British woke up in Boston to find that the Militia had surrounded the city. At first, General [[Artemas Ward]], as the head of the [[Massachusetts militia]], was in charge of the siege.<ref>McCullough, 35</ref> He set up his headquarters at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and positioned his forces at Charlestown Neck, Roxbury, and the [[Dorchester Heights]]. Initially, the 6,000 to 8,000 rebels faced some 4,000 British regulars under General [[Thomas Gage]] and had them trapped in the city. General Gage wrote of his surprise of the amount of rebels that had surrounded the city:
"The rebels are not the despicable rabble too many have supposed them to be....In all their wars against the French they never showed such conduct, attention, and perseverance as they do now."<ref>Harvey, 1</ref>

==Siege==
===Escalation===
[[Image:Lexington Concord Siege of Boston.jpg|thumb|250px|1775 map of the Battle of Lexington and Concord and the Siege of Boston (contains some inaccurate information).]]
The British were surrounded on land north, west, and south of Boston, but the harbor side of the city remained open for the [[Royal Navy]] under [[Samuel Graves|Vice Admiral Samuel Graves]] to sail in supplies from [[Nova Scotia]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the [[naval supremacy]] of the British fleet and the complete absence of a [[Continental Navy]] in the spring of 1775. Nevertheless, the town and the British forces were on short rations, and prices rose quickly. In addition, the American forces generally had information about what was happening in the city, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.<ref>McCullough, 118</ref>

As soon as the siege began, Gage turned his attention to fortifying easily defensible posistions. In the south, at [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], Gage ordered lines of defenses with 10 twenty-four pound guns. On the peninsula of Boston itself, four hills were quickly fortified. They were to be the main defense of the city.<ref>French, 236</ref> Over time, each of these hills were strenghtened.<ref>French, 237</ref> 

During this period of time, many Loyalists who lived outside of Boston left their home and fled into the city. Most of them felt that it was not safe to live outside of the city, because the Patriots were now in control.<ref>French, 228</ref> The ones who did not leave, stayed, generally because they did not wish to leave their homes and go to Boston. Some of the men, after arriving in Boston, joined the British army.<ref>French, 234</ref> 

Gage had no supply of fresh meat, and many horses needed hay. On the 21st, he orded a party to go to [[Grape Island (Massachusetts)|Grape Island]], in the [[Boston Harbor|harbor]], and bring hay to Boston.<ref name=French248>French, 248</ref> When the Americans heard of this, they took alarm, and the militia came out. As the British party arrived, they were under fire from the American milita. The milita set fire to the barn, destroyed 80 tons of hay, and prevented the British from taking any more than 3 tons.<ref name=French248/>

On [[May 25]], [[1775]], Gage received about 4,500 reinforcements and three additional Generals: Major Generals [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], [[John Burgoyne]], and [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]].  Gage began plans to break out of the city.<ref name=French249>French, 249</ref>

On [[May 27]], American forces strengthened the siege during the [[Battle of Chelsea Creek]] by removing British supplies of livestock from the islands of [[Boston Harbor]]. American fire prevented [[Royal Marines|British Marines]] from landing to recover the animals, and the British [[HM Armed Schooner Diana|schooner ''Diana'']] was destroyed.<ref name=French249/>
[[Image:Boston, 1775bsmall1.png|thumb|right|250px|The British defenses in Boston, 1775.]]
In an attempt to help quell the rebellion, on [[June 12]], Gage offered to pardon all of those who would lay down their arms except [[John Hancock]] and [[Samuel Adams]].<ref name=French251>French, 251</ref> Instead of quelling the rebellion, it ignited anger amongst the Americans, and more people began to take up arms.<ref name=French251/>

===Bunker Hill===
{{main|Battle of Bunker Hill}}

On [[June 15]], the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]] learned of Gage's plans to attack at Dorchester Heights and the Base of the [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown Peninsula]]. They sent word to General Ward to fortify Bunker Hill and the heights; he assigned Colonel [[William Prescott]] the Bunker Hill task.<ref>French, 256</ref>

On [[June 17]], as the result of the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], British forces under General Howe seized the Charlestown peninsula.<ref>French, 288</ref> The British did take their objective,  after two failed charges, but did not break out of Boston because the Americans held the ground at the base of the peninsula. With some 1000 men killed or wounded the British losses were so heavy that there were no more direct attacks on American forces. From this point, the siege essentially became a [[stalemate]].

===Stalemate===

On [[July 3]], George Washington arrived to take charge of the new [[Continental Army]]. Forces and supplies came in from as far away as [[Maryland]]. Trenches were dug on the [[South Boston, Boston, Massachusetts|Dorchester Neck]], and they were extended toward Boston. However, these activities had little effect on the British occupation.<ref>McCullough, 10</ref>

The working parties, the soldiers who worked on the fortifications on the front lines, were fired on from time to time, as well as the [[Sentry|sentries]]. On July 30, in retaliation for an American attack, the British pushed back an American advanced guard, and burned a few houses in Roxbury.<ref>French, 337</ref> Four days later, on August 2, an American rifleman was killed, and his body hung up by the neck. In retaliation, other American riflemen marched to the lines and began to attack the British troops. They continued their sharp shooting all day, killing or wounding many of the British, and losing only one man.<ref>McCullough, 39</ref> On August 30, the British made a surprise breakout from the neck, set fire to a tavern, and withdrew to their defences.<ref name=McCullough39>McCullough, 39</ref> On the same night, 300 Americans attacked Lighthouse Island, killing several British soldiers and capturing 23 at the loss of one life.<ref name=McCullough39/> On another August night, Washington sent 1,200 men to dig entrenchments on a hill near the Charlestown Neck. Despite a British bombardment, the Americans successfully dug the trenches.<ref>French, 311</ref> 
[[Image:Washingtoncommandarmy.jpg|thumb|250px|Washington taking command of the Army.]]
In early September, Washington began drawing up plans for two moves; one, to dispatch 1,000 men from Boston and [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invade Canada]], and two, to launch an attack on Boston.<ref>McCullough, 50</ref> Washington felt that he could afford to send these troops to Canada, as he had received intelligence from British deserters and American spies that the British had no intention of launching an attack until they were reinforced.<ref>McCullough, 51</ref> Washington summoned a council of war, and made a case for an all out amphibious assualt on Boston, by sending troops across [[Back Bay]] in flat-bottomed boats which could hold 50 men each.<ref name=McCullough53>McCullough, 53</ref> Washington believed it would be extremely difficult to keep the men together when winter came. After dissucssion, the plan was unanimously rejected, and the decision was not to attack "for the present at least."<ref name=McCullough53/>

In the fall, Washington ordered a party of soldiers to burn a lighthouse in the [[Boston Harbor|harbor]].  The first party was unable to do so, but a second one was able to finish the job.<ref>French, 319</ref> More expeditions were sent out in an attempt to disrupt the British supply of the city. In early November, the British attacked [[Lechmere Square|Lechmere's Point]], engaged the Americans, losing some men, and then retreated, having taken a couple of [[cows]].<ref>French, 338</ref>

On November 11, 1775, [[George Washington|Washington]] wrote to Congress of an incident during the siege, in which [[Benjamin Ruggles Woodbridge|Col. Woodbridge]] and part of his [[Woodbridge's Regiment of Militia|25th Regiment (Massachusetts)]] joined with [[William Thompson (general)|Col. William Thompson<U+2019>s]] [[1st Pennsylvania Regiment|Pennsylvania Regiment]], defending against a British landing at [[Lechmere Square|Lechmere<U+2019>s Point]].<ref>Sparks, 157.</ref>

On November 29, Captain [[John Manley (naval officer)|John Manley]], commanding the [[schooner]] [[USS Lee (1775)|''Lee'']], captured one of the most valuable prizes of the war&mdash;the British [[brigantine]] ''Nancy'', just outside of Boston Harbor, carrying much [[ordnance]] and military stores for British troops in Boston.  The arms, powder and ammunition proved invaluable to the Continental Army during the [[fortification of Dorchester Heights]] the following March.

As winter approached, both sides faced their own problems. The Americans were so short on gunpowder, that soldiers were given a spear to fight with in the event of a British attack.<ref name=McCullough60>McCullough, 60</ref> Many of the American troops remained unpaid and many of their enlistments would be up at the end of the year. On the British side, wood was so scarce that they began cutting down trees and tearing down old houses. To add to this, supplying the city had become increasingly difficult because of winter storms and American privateers patroling the waters outside of Boston.<ref name=McCullough60/> The British troops were so hungry that many were ready to desert as soon as they could. Worst, [[scurvy]] and [[smallpox]] had broken out in the city.<ref>McCullough, 61</ref> 

Washington again proposed a plan to assault Boston in October, but his officers thought it best to wait until the harbor had frozen over.<ref>French, 330</ref> In February, when the water had frozen between Roxborough and Boston Common, Washington thought that in spite of his shortage in powder he would try an assault by rushing across the ice; but his officers again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in such condition. He had not yet learned how completely he could trust to Howe's inactivity ; and he abandoned the dash across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights, well suited to the British general's temperament, and which was crowned with success.<ref>Fisher, 1</ref>

In mid-January, on orders from London, British Major General [[Henry Clinton (1730&ndash;1795)|Henry Clinton]] and a small fleet were sent to the Carolinas with 1,500 men.<ref>McCullough, 78</ref> In early February a British raiding party crossed the ice and burned several farmhouses in Dorchester.<ref>McCullough, 86</ref>

===End of the Siege===
{{main|Fortification of Dorchester Heights}}

In the winter of 1775<U+2013>76, Henry Knox and his engineers used [[sledges]] to retrieve 60 tons of heavy artillery that had been captured at [[Fort Ticonderoga]]. Bringing them across the frozen [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Connecticut River]]s, they arrived back at Cambridge on [[January 24]], [[1776]].<ref>McCullough, 84</ref>

With some of the guns captured from Ticonderoga, the Americans began to bombard the city on the night of March 2.<ref name=McCullough91>McCullough, 91</ref> The British responded with a cannonade.<ref name=McCullough91/> The American guns, led by Knox, continued to exchange fire with the British until March 4. The exchange of fire did little damage to either side, although it did damage houses and kill some British soldiers in Boston.<ref>McCullough, 92</ref>
[[Image:Siegeofbostonartillery.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Henry Knox bringing his "noble train" of artillery to Cambridge.]]
On March 5, Washington moved artillery and several thousand men overnight to occupy [[Dorchester Heights]], overlooking Boston. Since it was the middle of winter and the continental army was unable to dig into the frozen ground on Dorchester Heights, rather than entrenching themselves, Washington's men used logs, branches and anything else available to fortify the position overnight. General Howe is said to have exclaimed, "My God, these fellows have done more work in one night than I could make my army do in three months."<ref>McCullough, 93</ref> The British fleet ceased to be an asset, because it was anchored in a shallow harbor with limited maneuverability, and the American guns on Dorchester Heights were aimed at the fleet.

The immediate response of the British was a two hour cannon barrage at the heights, which had no effect because the British guns could not reach the American guns at such height.<ref>McCullough, 94</ref> After the failed attempt, Howe and his officers agreed that the colonists must be removed from the heights if they were to hold Boston. They agreed to launch an assault on the heights; however, due to a storm the attack never took place.<ref>McCullough, 95</ref>

On March 8, an unsigned letter was sent from Boston to the Americans, that if the British were allowed to depart unmolested, they had no intention of destroying the town. Washington never recieved the letter, as it was not personally addressed to him, but the news in it was spread around the American camp.<ref name=McCullough99>McCullough, 99</ref> On March 9, after seeing movement on Nook's Hill on Dorchester, the British opened a massive fire  barrage that lasted all night. It killed four men with one cannonball, but that was all the damage that was done.<ref name=McCullough99/> The next day, the colonists went out and collected the 700 cannonballs that had been fired at them.<ref name=McCullough99/>

===Evacuation===
On March 10, Howe issued a proclamation ordering the inhabitants to give up all linen and woolen goods that could be used by the colonists to continue the war. A loyalist, Crean Brush, was authorized to take whatever he wanted that could be used to benifit the army on their journey, in return for certificates, which were, at that point, entirely useless.<ref name=McCullough104>McCullough, 104</ref> 

Over the next week, the British fleet sat in Boston harbor waiting for favorable winds, while loyalists and the remaining British soldiers were loaded onto the ships. On March 15, the wind became favorable, but before they could leave, it turned against them. On March 17 the wind, once again, turned favorable. The troops were authorized to burn the town if there were any disturbances while they were marching to their ships.<ref name=McCullough104/> The troops began to move out at 4:00 a.m., and, by 9:00 a.m., all ships were underway.

From Boston departed 120 ships, with more than 11,000 people. Of those 11,000 people, 9,906 were British troops, 667 were women, and 553 were children.<ref name=McCullough105>McCullough, 105</ref> As they departed, Howe ordered a 21-gun fire salute, along with the 50 guns of Howe's flagship, ''Chatham''.

==Aftermath==
Seeing the British fleet sailing away, the Americans began to cheer. At first, they believed that the British were still on Bunker Hill, but it turned out that they had left dummies in place.<ref name=McCullough105/> Washington let Artemus Ward lead the triumphant entry into Boston because he was from New England.<ref name=McCullough105/> 

Washington feared that the British were going to attack [[New York City]]; on April 4, Washington and his army departed for [[Manhattan]], which would begin the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]].<ref>McCullough, 112</ref>
