:''For the town in Ontario, see [[Swastika, Ontario]].''
The '''swastika''' (from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] <U+0938><U+094D><U+0935><U+093E><U+0938><U+094D><U+0924><U+093F><U+0915> ''{{IAST|svastika}}'') is an [[equilateral]] [[cross]] with its arms bent at [[Angle#Types of angles|right angles]] in either left-facing ({{Unicode|<U+534D>}}) or right-facing ({{Unicode|<U+5350>}}) direction. The swastika is a holy symbol in [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]]. In the [[Western world|West]], it is most widely known and used as a symbol of [[Nazism]]. It is traditionally oriented so that a main line is horizontal, though it is occasionally rotated at forty-five degrees. The [[Hindu]] version is often decorated with a dot in each [[quadrant]]. 

== Overview ==   
The motif seems to have first been used in [[Neolithic]] [[Eurasia]]. The swastika is used in religious and civil ceremonies in India. Most Indian temples, entrance of houses, weddings, festivals and celebrations are decorated with swastikas. The symbol was introduced to [[Southeast Asia]] by Hindu kings and remains an integral part of Balinese Hinduism to this day, and it is a common sight in Indonesia. The symbol has an ancient history in Europe, appearing on artifacts from pre-Christian [[European]] cultures.  It was also adopted independently by several [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures. 
    
In the [[Western world]], the symbol experienced a resurgence following the archaeological work in the late nineteenth century of [[Heinrich Schliemann]], who discovered the symbol in the site of ancient [[Troy]] and associated it with the ancient migrations of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] ("[[Aryan]]" people). He connected it with similar shapes found on ancient pots in Germany, and theorised that the swastika was a "significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors," linking ancient German, Greek and Vedic culture.<ref>Schliemann, H, ''Troy and its remains'', London: Murray, 1875, pp. 102, 119-20</ref> <ref>Sarah Boxer. "[http://faluninfo.net/displayAnArticle.asp?ID=606 One of the world's great symbols strives for a comeback]". ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[July 29]], [[2000]].</ref>  By the early 20th century it was widely used worldwide and was regarded as a symbol of good luck and auspiciousness.

The work of Schliemann soon became intertwined with the ''[[v<U+00F6>lkisch]]'' movements, for which the swastika was a symbol of "Aryan" identity, a concept that came to be equated by theorists like [[Alfred Rosenberg]] with a [[Nordic race|Nordic]] [[master race]] originating in northern Europe. Since its adoption by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] of [[Adolf Hitler]], the swastika has been associated with [[fascism]], [[racism]] ([[white supremacy]]), [[World War II]], and [[the Holocaust]] in much of the West. The swastika remains a core symbol of [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] groups, and is also regularly used by [[activism|activist]] groups to signify the supposed Nazi-like behaviour of organizations and individuals they oppose.

==Etymology and alternative names== 
The word ''swastika'' is derived from the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|svastika}}'' (in [[Devanagari]], {{Unicode|<U+0938><U+094D><U+0935><U+0938><U+094D><U+0924><U+093F><U+0915>}}), meaning any lucky or auspicious object, and in particular a mark made on persons and things to denote good luck. It is composed of ''su-'' (cognate with [[Greek language|Greek]] ''<U+03B5><U+03C5>-'', "eu-"), meaning "good, well" and ''asti'' a verbal abstract to the root ''as'' "to be"; ''svasti'' thus means "well-being". The suffix ''-ka'' forms a diminutive, and ''svastika'' might thus be translated literally as "little thing associated with well-being", corresponding roughly to "lucky charm", or "thing that is auspicious".<ref>"[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/swastika/004.php The Swastika]". Northvegr Foundation. Notes on the etymology and meaning of Swastika</ref> The suffix ''-tika'' also literally means ''mark''; therefore a sometimes alternate name for swastika in India is ''shubhtika'' (literally ''good mark''). The word first appears in the Classical Sanskrit (in the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] epics). 

Alternative historical [[English language|English]] spellings of the Sanskrit word include ''suastika'' and ''svastica''.  Alternative names for the shape are:
*''Black Spider'', to various peoples in middle and western Europe
*''crooked cross''
*''cross cramponned,'' ''~nn<U+00E9>e'', or ''~nny'' (in [[heraldry]]), as each arm resembles a ''crampon'' or angle-iron. (Compare ''Winkelma<U+00DF>kreuz'' in [[German language|German]])
*''cross gammadion'', ''tetragammadion'' or just ''gammadion'', as each arm resembles the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] <U+0393> (''[[gamma]]''). (Compare ''crux gammata'' in [[Latin]], ''croiz gamm<U+00E9>e'' in [[Old French]] and ''croix gamm<U+00E9>e'' in [[French language|French]]; ''cruz gamada'' or ''esv<U+00E1>stica'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])
*''fylfot'' (meaning "four feet", chiefly in heraldry and [[architecture]]). (See [[Fylfot]] for a discussion of the etymology)
*''hooked cross'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''hakenkruis''; [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''kukasti krst''; [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''hakakross''; [[German language|German]]: ''Hakenkreuz''; [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''hakaristi''; [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: ''haakrist''; [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''<U+03B1><U+03B3><U+03BA><U+03C5><U+03BB><U+03C9><U+03C4><U+03CC><U+03C2> <U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03CC><U+03C2> (agylotos stavros)''; [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''hakekors''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''croce uncinata''; [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''Cruce <U+00EE>nc<U+00E2>rligat<U+0103>''; [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''hakkors''; [[Danish language|Danish]]: ''hagekors''; [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''horogkereszt''; [[Czech language|Czech]]: ''h<U+00E1>kov<U+00FD> k<U+0159><U+00ED><U+017E>'')
*''sun wheel'' (German ''Sonnenrad''), (Greek ''<U+03B7><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C7><U+03CC><U+03C2> (iliotrochos)''), a name also used as a synonym for the [[sun cross]]
*''tetraskelion'', Greek "four legged", especially when composed of four conjoined legs (compare [[triskelion]])
*''Thor's hammer'', from its supposed association with [[Thor]], the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[deity|god]] of [[thunder]], but this may be a misappropriation of a name that properly belongs to a Y-shaped or T-shaped symbol. (See Thomas Wilson, [[#References|below]].) The Swastika shape appears in Icelandic [[grimoire]]s wherein it is named ''<U+00DE><U+00F3>rshamar.''
*''thunder cross'' ([[Latvian language|Latvian]]: ''perkonkrusts'')
*''twisted cross''
*''unexpected cross'' ([[Polish language|Polish]] ''krzy<U+017C>yk niespodziany'') or ''highlander cross'' ([[Polish language|Polish]] ''g<U+00F3>ralski krzy<U+017C>'')

==History==
[[Image:KunaFlagMola.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[mola (art form)]] showing a swastika, based on the [[Kuna Yala|Kuna]] flag.]]
In antiquity, the swastika was used extensively by the [[Indo-Aryans]], [[Hittites]] [[Celt]]s and [[Greeks]], among others. In particular, the swastika is a sacred symbol in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. It occurs in other [[Asia]]n, [[Europe]]an, [[Africa]]n and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures &ndash; sometimes as a geometrical motif, sometimes as a religious symbol.

===Origin hypotheses===
[[Image:Hansilk2.png|thumb|290px|left|part of the [[Han Dynasty silk comet atlas]]]] 
The ubiquity of the swastika symbol is easily explained by it being a very simple symbol that will arise independently in any basketweaving society.  The swastika is a repeating design, created by the edges of the reeds in a square basket-weave.  Other theories attempt to establish a connection via [[cultural diffusion]] or an explanation along the lines of [[Carl Jung]]'s  [[collective unconscious]].

While the existence of the swastika symbol in the [[Americas]] may be explained by the basket-weave theory, its American presence weakens the cultural diffusion theory.  While some have proposed that the swastika was secretly transferred to [[North America]] by an early seafaring civilization on Eurasia, a separate but parallel development is considered the most likely explanation.

Yet another explanation is suggested by [[Carl Sagan]] in his book ''Comet''. Sagan reproduces an ancient [[China|Chinese]] manuscript that shows comet tail varieties: most are variations on simple comet tails, but the last shows the comet nucleus with four bent arms extending from it, recalling a swastika. Sagan suggests that in antiquity a [[comet]] could have approached so close to Earth that the jets of gas streaming from it, bent by the comet's rotation, became visible, leading to the adoption of the swastika as a symbol across the world. 

[[Image:Owlvasetroy.png|thumb|170px|right|Two owl-like vases from Schliemann's book ''Ilios'']]
Bob Kobres in  [http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/bronze.html ''Comets and the Bronze Age Collapse''] (1992) contends that the swastika-like comet on the Han Dynasty silk comet atlas was labeled a "long tailed pheasant star" due to its resemblance to a [http://www.wildforlife.org/Creature/GH_Talons.htm bird's foot.], and further suggests that many swastika and swastika-like motifs may have been representations of bird tracks, including many of those found by Schliemann.

Barbara G. Walker, author of ''The Woman's Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects'', claims that the crux dissimulata, an early swastika, represented the four winds. Concerning the short-armed version of this symbol, known as the gammadion because it is made up of four Greek gammas, Walker says this symbol was an emblem of the ancient goddess and probably represented "the solstices and equinoxes, or the four directions, four elements, and four divine guardians of the world."

===Archaeological record===
The earliest swastika symbols of the archaeological record date to the [[Neolithic]].
The symbol was found on a number of shards in the [[Khuzestan]] province of Iran and as part of the "[[Vinca script]]" of [[Neolithic Europe]] of the [[5th millennium BC]].

[[Image:IndusValleySeals.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Seals from [[Indus Valley Civilization]]]]
In the [[Early Bronze Age]], it appears as part of the "[[Indus script]]" and on pottery found in [[Sintashta]]  [http://steppes.ru/foto/keram_shem.jpg]. 

Swastika-like symbols also appear in Bronze and [[Iron Age]] designs of the northern [[Caucasus]] ([[Koban culture]]), and [[Azerbaijan]], as well as of [[Scythian]]s and [[Sarmatian]]s [http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/001/073/5-44.gif]. In all these cultures the swastika symbol does not appear to occupy any marked position or significance, but appears as just one form of a series of similar symbols of varying complexity. 

===Historical use===
In [[Zoroastrian]] [[Persia]], the swastika symbolized the revolving sun (''Garduneh-e Khorshid''), [[Mithra]]'s Wheel (''Garduneh-e Mehr''), [[fire worship|fire]], infinity, or continuing recreation. There is no reference to the swastika in the [[Vedas]], the term ''svastika'' first appearing in [[Epic Sanskrit]], but the symbol rose to importance in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] in [[Maurya]] and [[Gupta]] India.

The use of the swastika by the indigenous [[B<U+00F6>n]] faith of [[Tibet]], as well as [[syncretism|syncretic]] religions, such as [[Cao Dai]] of [[Vietnam]] and [[Falun Gong]] of China, is thought to be borrowed from Buddhism as well. Similarly, the existence of the swastika as a solar symbol among the [[Akan people|Akan]] civilization of southwest [[Africa]] may have been the result of cultural transfer along the [[African slave trade|African slave route]]s around [[1500|AD 1500]]{{fact}}.

===Adoption of the swastika in the West=== 
[[Image:Swastika iran.jpg|thumb|right|This Iranian necklace was excavated from Kaluraz, [[Guilan]], first millennium BC, [[National Museum of Iran]].]]

The discovery of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] group in the 1790s led to a great effort by archaeologists to link the pre-history of [[Europe|European]] peoples to the ancient "[[Aryan]]s" (variously referring to the [[Indo-Iranians]] or the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]). Following his discovery of objects bearing the swastika in the ruins of [[Troy]], [[Heinrich Schliemann]] consulted two leading [[Sanskrit]] scholars of the day, [[Emile Burnouf]] and [[Max M<U+00FC>ller]]. Schliemann concluded that the Swastika was a specifically Indo-European symbol. Later discoveries of the motif among the remains of the Hittites and of ancient [[Iran]] seemed to confirm this theory. This idea was taken up by many other writers, and the swastika quickly became popular in the [[Western world|West]], appearing in many designs from the 1880s to the 1920s.

These discoveries, and the new popularity of the swastika symbol, led to a widespread desire to ascribe symbolic significance to every example of the motif. In [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] countries examples of similar shapes in ancient European artifacts and in folk art were interpreted as emblems of good-luck linked to the Indo-Iranian meaning.

Western use of the motif, along with the religious and cultural meanings attached to it, was subverted in the early [[20th century|twentieth century]] after it was adopted as the emblem of the Nazi Party. This association occurred because Nazism stated that the historical Aryans were the forefathers of modern Germans and then proposed that, because of this, the subjugation of the world by Germany was desirable, and even predestined. The swastika was used as a conveniently geometrical and eye-catching symbol to emphasize this mythical Aryan-German correspondence and instil racial pride. Since [[World War II]], most [[Western world|Westerners]] know the swastika as solely a Nazi symbol, leading to incorrect assumptions about its pre-Nazi use in the West and confusion about its sacred religious and historical status in other cultures.

==Geometry and symbolism==
{{wrapper}}
|[[Image:Cw right-facing swastika.ant.png|thumb|100px|A right-facing swastika may be described as "clockwise"...]]
|-
|[[Image:Ccw right-facing swastika.ant.png|thumb|100px|... or "counter-clockwise"]]
|-
|[[Image:17-square swastika.ant.png|thumb|right|90px|A swastika composed of 17 squares in a 5x5 grid]] 
|}
[[Geometry|Geometrically]], the swastika can be regarded as an irregular [[icosagon]] or 20-sided [[polygon]]. The arms are of varying width and are often rectilinear (but need not be). However, the proportions of the Nazi swastika were fixed: they were based on a 5x5 grid.<ref>"[http://flagspot.net/flags/de%271933.html Swastika Flag Specifications and Construction Sheet (Germany)]". ''[[FOTW|Flags of the World]]''.</ref> 

Characteristic is the 90<U+00B0> [[rotational symmetry]] (that is, the symmetry of the [[cyclic group]] ''C<sub>4h</sub>'') and [[chirality (mathematics)|chirality]], hence the absence of reflectional [[symmetry]], and the existence of two versions which are each other's [[mirror image]].

The mirror-image forms are often described as:
*left-facing and, as depicted across, right-facing;
*left-hand and right-hand;
*[[clockwise and counterclockwise]].

"Left-facing" and "right-facing" are used mostly consistently. Looking at an upright swastika, the upper arm clearly faces towards ''the viewer's'' left (<U+534D>) or right (<U+5350>). The other two descriptions are ambiguous as it is unclear if they refer to the direction of the bend in each arm or to the implied rotation of the symbol.  If the latter, whether the arms lead or trail remains unclear.  The terms are used inconsistently (sometimes even by the same writer) which is confusing and may obfuscate an important point, that the rotation of the swastika may have symbolic relevance.

Nazi [[ensign]]s had a [[through and through]] image, so each version was present on one side, but the [[Flag of Nazi Germany|Nazi flag]] on land was right-facing on both sides ([http://flagspot.net/flags/de1933_o.html], at the bottom).

The swastika is, after the simple equilateral cross (the "Greek cross"), the next most commonly found version of the cross.  

Seen as a cross, the four lines emanating from the center point to the four [[cardinal directions]].  The most common association is with the [[Sun]].  Other proposed correspondences are to the visible rotation of the night sky in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] around [[Polaris]].

As a mystical image, the swastika is often seen in a "vision" as a field of equal "perfect crosses" in rotation, the outer portion of the arms being seen as after images that are seen like the tips of rotating aircraft propellers or fan blades in videos. The direction of rotation seen by the person having the vision is considered to be indicative of the direction of their spiritual movement as either ascendant toward the Light or descendent toward the Darkness. The most auspicious such "vision" is when the person having the "vision" discovers that they can choose through "essential will" (as compared to mechanistic "ego will") and change the direction of rotation first one way, then reverse and then back again. This is considered to be an indication of spiritual maturation and self-responsibility.

===Sauwastika===
{{main|Sauwastika}}
The name [[sauwastika]] is sometimes given for the supposedly "evil", left-facing, form of the swastika (<U+534D>). A common myth is that the left-facing swastika is generally regarded as evil in Hindu tradition. This is because the much more common form in India is the right-facing swastika. Indians of all faiths sometimes use the symbol in both orientations - mostly for symmetry.  Buddhists, outside of India, generally use the left-facing swastika over the right-facing swastika although, again, both can be used.  Despite this, the misconception that the left-facing swastika is evil is widespread, even among some contemporary Indian communities.

Some contemporary writers &mdash; Servando Gonz<U+00E1>lez, for example &mdash; confuse matters even further by asserting that the right-facing swastika, used by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] is in fact the "evil" sauwastika.<ref>Servando Gonz<U+00E1>lez. "The Krohn Connection". ''[http://www.intelinet.org/swastika/swasti01.htm The Swastika and the Nazis'']. 1998.</ref> (Gonz<U+00E1>lez "proves" that the left-facing swastika is the sunwise one with reference to a 1930s box of [[Standard fireworks]] from [[Sivakasi]], India.)  This inversion &ndash; whether intentional or not &ndash; might derive from a desire to prove that the Nazis' use of the right-handed swastika was expressive of their "evil" intent. (''See also [[#Taboo in Western countries|Taboo in Western countries]].'') But the notion that [[Adolf Hitler]] deliberately inverted the "good left-facing" swastika is wholly unsupported by any historical evidence.<ref>J. R. "[http://www.jrbooksonline.com/HTML-docs/The_Backwards_Swastika.htm Debunking the Nazi 'Backwards Swastika' Myth]". ''JR's Rare Books and Commentary''. August 2001.</ref>

==Art and architecture==
[[Image:Romanswastika.JPG|thumb|266px|swastika on a Roman mosaic]]

[[Image:Amiens-pavement-swastika.jpg|right|frame|Interlocking

The swastika is common as a design motif in current [[Hindu]] architecture and Indian artwork as well as in ancient Western [[architecture]], frequently appearing in [[mosaic]]s, [[frieze]]s, and other works across the [[ancient history|ancient]] world. [[Ancient Greek]] architectural designs are replete with interlinking swastika motifs. Related symbols in classical Western architecture include the [[cross]], the three-legged triskele or [[triskelion]] and the rounded [[lauburu]]. The swastika symbol is also known in these contexts by a number of names, especially ''gammadion''. 

In [[China|Chinese]], [[Korea]]n, and [[Japan]]ese art, the swastika is often found as part of a repeating pattern. One common pattern, called ''sayagata'' in Japanese, comprises left and right facing swastikas joined by lines.<ref>"Sayagata<U+3000><U+7D17><U+7DBE><U+5F62>". ''[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/sayagata.htm Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]''.</ref> As the negative space between the lines has a distinctive shape, the sayagata pattern is sometimes called the "key fret" motif in English.

The swastika symbol was found extensively in the ruins of the ancient city of [[Troy]].

In [[Art in Ancient Greece|Greco-Roman]] art and architecture, and in Romanesque and [[Gothic art]] in the West, isolated swastikas are relatively rare, and the swastika is more commonly found as a repeated element in a border or tessellation. The swastika often represented perpetual motion, reflecting the design of a rotating windmill or watermill.  A design of interlocking swastikas is one of several [[tessellation]]s on the floor of the cathedral of [[Amiens]], France.<ref>Robert Ferr<U+00E9>. "[http://www.labyrinth-enterprises.com/amiens.html Amiens Cathedral]". ''Labyrinth Enterprises''.</ref> A border of linked swastikas was a common Roman architectural motif,<ref>Gary Malkin. "[http://romanbristol.tripod.com/avon/tockington.html Tockington Park Roman Villa]". ''The Area of Bristol in Roman Times''. [[December 9]], [[2002]].</ref> and can be seen in more recent buildings as a neoclassical element. A swastika border is one form of [[meander (architecture)|meander]], and the individual swastikas in such border are sometimes called ''Greek keys''.

The [[Laguna Bridge]] in [[Yuma, Arizona]] was built in [[1905]] by the [[United States|U.S.]] Reclamation Department and is decorated with a row of swastikas.

The [[Canada|Canadian]] artist [http://www.manwoman.net/ ManWoman] has attempted to rehabilitate the "[http://www.manwoman.net/swastika/swastika.html gentle swastika]".

==Religion and tradition== 
===Hinduism=== 
[[Image:DiwaliSwastika.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Children light lamps in the shape of Swastika, on the eve of [[Diwali]] (the eve of Hindu new year), a major Hindu festival.]]
The swastika is found all over [[Hindu]] temples, signs, altars, pictures and iconography where it is sacred. It is used in all Hindu weddings, festivals, ceremonies, houses and doorways, clothing and jewelry, motor transport and even decorations on food items like cakes and pastries.

It is one of the 108 symbols of Vishnu and represents the sun's rays without which there would be no life.

The [[Aum]] symbol is also sacred in Hinduism. Whereas Aum is representative of a single primordial tone of creation, the swastika is a pure geometrical mark and has no syllabic tone associated with it.

In [[Hinduism]], the two symbols represent the two forms of the creator god [[Brahma]]: facing right it represents the [[evolution]] of the universe (''Pravritti''), facing left it represents the [[Involution (philosophy)|involution]] of the universe (''Nivritti''). It is also seen as pointing in all four directions (North, East, South and West) and thus signifies stability and groundedness. Its use as a sun symbol can first be seen in its representation of [[Surya]], the Hindu Sun God. The swastika is considered extremely holy and auspicious by all Hindus, and is regularly used to decorate all sorts of items to do with Hindu culture. It is used in all Hindu [[yantra]]s and religious designs. Throughout the subcontinent of India it can be seen on the sides of temples, written on religious scriptures, on gift items, and on letterhead. The Hindu God [[Ganesh]] is often shown as sitting on a lotus flower on a bed of swastikas.

Amongst the Hindus of [[Bengal]], it is common to see the name "swastika" applied to a slightly different symbol, which has the same significance as the common swastika, and both symbols are used as auspicious signs. This symbol looks something like a stick figure of a human being.<ref>Subhayu Banerjee. "[http://www.bengalonthenet.com/php/displayfile.php?article_id=60&section_id=5&sub_id=0 Shubho Nabobarsho]". ''Bengal on the Net''. [[April 16]], [[2001]]</ref> "Swastika" is a common given name amongst Bengalis and a prominent literary magazine in Calcutta is called the ''Swastika''. The stick figure, however, is not mainstream usage in India.

===Buddhism===
[[Image:buddhistswastika.jpg|frame|right|Swastika on a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple in [[Korea]].]] 
[[Buddhism]] was founded by a Hindu Prince and has thus inherited the swastika. These two symbols are included, at least since the [[Liao Dynasty]], as part of the [[Chinese language]], the symbolic sign for the character <U+842C> or <U+4E07> (''w<U+00E0>n'' in Chinese, ''man'' in Japanese, ''v<U+1EA1>n'' in Vietnamese) meaning "all", and "eternality" (lit. [[myriad]]) and as <U+5350> which is seldom used. A swastika marks the beginning of many Buddhist scriptures. The swastikas (in either orientation) appear on the chest of some [[statue]]s of [[Gautama Buddha]] and is often incised on the soles of the feet of the Buddha in statuary. Because of the association with the right facing swastika with [[Nazism]], Buddhist swastikas (''outside'' India only) after the mid-20th century are almost universally left-facing: <U+534D>. This form of the swastika is often found on Chinese food packaging to signify that the product is [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and can be consumed by strict Buddhists. It is often sewn into the collars of Chinese children's clothing to protect them from evil spirits.

In 1922, the Chinese syncretist movement [[Daoyuan]] founded the philanthropic association [[Red Swastika Society]] in imitation of the [[Red Cross]]. The association was very active in China during the 1920s and the 1930s.  

[[Image:Taipei subway temple symbol.jpg|thumb|320px|On maps in the [[Taipei]] subway system a swastika symbol is employed to indicate a temple, parallel to a [[Christian cross|cross]] indicating a Christian church.]]

The swastika used in Buddhist art and scripture is known in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as a ''manji'' (which literally just means "the Chinese character for eternality" <U+4E07><U+5B57>), and represents [[Dharma]], universal harmony, and the balance of opposites. When facing left, it is the ''omote'' (front) ''manji'', representing love and mercy. Facing right, it represents strength and intelligence, and is called the ''ura'' (rear) ''manji''. Balanced ''manji'' are often found at the beginning and end of Buddhist scriptures (outside India).

===Jainism=== 
[[Jainism]] gives even more prominence to the swastika than Hinduism. It is a symbol of the seventh Jina (Saint), the ''Tirthankara Suparsva''. It is considered to be one of the 24 auspicious marks and the emblem of the seventh [[arhat]] of the present age. All Jain temples and holy books must contain the swastika and ceremonies typically begin and end with creating a swastika mark several times with rice around the altar.
Jains use rice to make a swastika (also known as "Sathiyo" in the state of Gujarat, India) in front of idols in a temple. Jains then put an offering on top of this swastika - this offering is usually a fruit, a sweet (mithai), a dried fruit or sometimes a coin or currency note.

===Zoroastrianism===
In [[Surakhany]] (15 km. from [[Baku]] - [[Azerbaijan]])) there is an 'Ateshgah' or '[[Fire temple]]' allegedly built after the 6th Century BC by [[Zoroastrian]] worshipers over a natural gas pocket (now exhausted) that fuelled an 'eternal flame' burning night and day. This temple was also a shrine for [[Parsees]] (Zoroastrian worshipers from [[India]]), [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] pilgrims. The quadrangular pavillon has [[Sanskrit]] inscriptions and is engraved with a swastika.

===The Abrahamic religions=== 
The swastika was not widely utilized by followers of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s. Where it does exist, it is not portrayed as an explicitly religious symbol and is often purely decorative or, at most, a symbol of good luck. One example of scattered use is the floor of the synagogue at [[Ein Gedi]], built during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation of [[Judea]], which was decorated with a swastika.<ref>"[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early%20History%20-%20Archaeology/Ein%20Gedi%20-%20An%20Ancient%20Oasis%20Settlement Ein Gedi: An Ancient Oasis Settlement]". ''Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs''. [[November 23]], [[1999]].</ref> 

In Christianity, the swastika is a symbol representing the resurrection of Jesus Christ(the swastika is seen as a hooked crucifix, symbolizing Christ's victory over death.) Some Christian churches built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] eras are decorated with swastikas, carrying over earlier Roman designs. Swastikas are prominently displayed in a [[mosaic]] in the St. Sophia church of [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] dating to the 12th century. They also appear as a repeating ornamental motif on a tomb in the Basilica of St. Ambrose in [[Milan]]. However, a proposed direct link between it and a swastika floor mosaic in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens]], which was built on top of a pagan site at [[Amiens]], [[France]] in the 1200s, is considered unlikely. 

The [[Islam|Muslim]] "Friday" mosque of [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Iran]] and the [[Taynal Mosque]] in [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]] both have swastika motifs.

===Other Asian traditions===
Some sources indicate that the Chinese [[Empress Wu]] (<U+6B66><U+5247><U+5929>)(684-704) of the [[Tang Dynasty]] decreed that the swastika would be used as an alternative symbol of the sun.  As part of the [[Chinese character|Chinese script]], the swastika has [[Unicode]] encodings U+534D <U+534D> (pronunciation following the Chinese character "<U+842C>": Cantonese: "man"; Mandarin: wan); (left-facing) and U+5350 <U+5350> (right-facing).<ref>"[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U4E00.pdf CJK Unified Ideographs]", ''The [[Unicode]] Standard, Version 4.1''. Unicode, Inc. 2005. ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]] file)</ref>

The Mandarin "Wan" is a homophone for "10,000" and is commonly used to represent the whole of creation, e.g. 'the myriad things' in the [[Dao De Jing]].

In [[Japan]], the swastika is called ''manji''. Since the Middle Ages, it is used as a [[Mon (badge)|family coat of arms]]. On [[Japanese map symbols|Japanese maps]], a swastika (left-facing and horizontal) is used to mark the location of a Buddhist temple. The right-facing ''manji'' is often referred as the ''gyaku manji'' (<U+9006><U+534D>, lit. "reverse ''manji''"), and can also be called ''kagi j<U+016B>ji'', literally "hook cross."   

The left-facing Buddhist swastika also appears on the emblem of [[Falun Gong]]. This has generated considerable controversy, particularly in Germany, where the police have reportedly confiscated several banners featuring the emblem.  A court ruling subsequently allowed Falun Gong followers in Germany to continue the use of the emblem.

===Native American traditions=== 
The swastika shape was used by some Native Americans. It has been found in excavations of [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]]-era sites in the [[Ohio River|Ohio valley]]. It was widely used by many [[Southwestern United States|southwestern]] tribes, most notably the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]]. Among different tribes the swastika carried various meanings. To the [[Hopi]] it represented the wandering Hopi clan; to the Navajo it was one symbol for a [[whirling log]] (''tsil no'oli'''), a sacred image representing a legend that was used in healing rituals.<ref>Dottie Indyke. "[http://www.collectorsguide.com/fa/fa086.shtml The History of an Ancient Human Symbol]".

[[Image:KunaYalaFlag.svg|thumb|right|The Flag of [[Kuna Yala]].]]
A swastika shape is an ancient symbol in the culture of the [[Kuna (people)|Kuna people]] of [[Kuna Yala]], [[Panama]]. In Kuna tradition it symbolises the octopus, which created the world;  its tentacles, pointing to the four cardinal points, gave rise to the rainbow, the sun, the moon and the stars.<ref>[http://www.rainforestart.com/creationch.htm ''Chants and Myths about Creation''], from Rainforest Art.  Retrieved [[February 25]], [[2006]].</ref>

In February, 1925, the Kuna revolted against Panamanian suppression of their culture, and were granted autonomy in 1930; the flag which they adopted at this time is based on the swastika shape, and remains the official flag of Kuna Yala. A number of variations on the flag have been used over the years; red top and bottom bands instead of orange were previously used, and in 1942 a ring (representing the traditional Kuna nose-ring) was added to the centre of the flag to distance it from the symbol of the Nazi party.<ref>[http://www.fotw.us/flags/pa-nat.html ''Panama - Native Peoples''], from Flags of the World.  Retrieved [[February 20]], [[2006]].</ref>

===Pre-Christian European traditions=== 
The swastika (also called a ''[[fylfot]]'', a term coined in the 19th century from a 1500 reference to a figure used to ''fill'' empty space at the ''foot'' of stained-glass windows in medieval churches) appears as an ornament on many pre-Christian artefacts, drawn both left-facing and right-facing. Similar motifs, within a circle or in a swirling form have also been interpreted as "swastikas".

The [[ancient Greece|Greek]] goddess [[Athena]] was sometimes portrayed as wearing robes covered with swastikas.

An [[Ogham]] stone found in Anglish, [[Co Kerry]] ([[CIIC]] 141) was modified into an early Christian gravestone, and was decorated with a [[cross patt<U+00E9>e]] and two swastikas at this time. The pre-Christian [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[ship burial]] at [[Sutton Hoo]], England, contains gold cups and shields adorned with swastika-like shapes. 
[[Image:Broken crossed circle.svg|thumb|right|The ancient Norse [[Sun cross]].]]

The pre-Christian Norse regularly used  the so-called '''[[Sun cross]]''' or '''Sun wheel''' one form of which is often interpreted as a variant of the swastika, and it appears regularly in Scandinavian folk art. Swastika shapes are found, among similar ornaments, on Germanic [[Migration period]] artifacts, such as the Gothic spearhead found  at [[Brest-Litovsk]], Russia, or the [[Younger Futhark]] [[Snoldelev Stone]], in [[Rams<U+00F8>]], Denmark.

In the neopagan religions [[Asatru]] and [[Heathenry]] these swastika-like shapes are often used as religious symbols. Adherents of these faiths argue that their use is not connected to the political implications that the symbol gained under Nazism, claiming pre-Christian Germanic origins of the symbol.

[[Image:Receboga.jpg|thumb|left|The "Hands of Gods" (''r<U+0119>ce boga''), allegedly an old (pre-Christian) Polish  symbol of [[Svarog]].]]

The swastika shape was also present in pre-Christian [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[slavic mythology|mythology]]. It was dedicated to the sun god named [[Svarog]] and called [[kolovrat]], (pol. kolowr<U+00F3>t). In the [[Poland|Polish]] first Republic the symbol of the swastika was also popular with the nobility. According to chronicles, Varangians prince Oleg who in the 9th century with his Rus Vikings had captured Constantinople, had nailed his shield to the city's gates, which had a large red swastika painted on it. The several Polish noble houses, e.g. Boreyko, Borzym, and Radziechowski from Ruthenia also had Swastikas as their coat of arms. The family had reached its greatness in the 14-15th centuries and their crest can be seen in many heraldry books produced at that time.

The [[Vatican Museums]] contain examples of [[Etruscan]] pottery bearing the swastika.

===Medieval Vehmic courts===
Walker (''A Woman's Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects'') states that the double swastika was associated with the [[Vehmic courts]] of the [[Middle Ages]], a "[[secret sect]]" founded to persecute "[[heretics]] and [[Jews]]" before becoming associated with the [[Inquisition]]. These courts, she says, continued as "underground societies of [[summary justice]]" and "hotbeds of [[anti-Semitism]]" during the nineteenth century before being superseded by the [[Nazi]] party, the members of which substituted the single swastika for the doubled version.

==Early 20th century==
===United Kingdom===
[[Image:Kipling swastika.png|frame|right|Logo from a 1911 edition of [[Rudyard Kipling]].]]
The [[United Kingdom|British]] author [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was strongly influenced by [[India]]n culture, had a swastika as his personal [[moniker]] on the dust jackets of all his books until the rise of Nazism made this inappropriate.  One of Kipling's ''[[Just So Stories]]'', "The Crab That Played With The Sea", had an elaborate full-page illustration by Kipling including a stone bearing what was called "a magic mark" (a swastika); some later editions of the stories blotted out the mark, but not its captioned reference, making the readers wonder what the "mark" was.

During [[World War I]], the swastika was used as the emblem of the [[British National War Savings Committee]].<ref>[[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960612/debtext/60612-41.htm Hansard Debates for [[June 12|12 Jun]] 1996 (pt 41)].</ref>

The swastika was also used as a symbol by the [[Scouting|Boy Scouts]] in the United Kingdom, and worldwide. According to "Johnny" Walker,<ref>C.R. "Johnny" Walker. "[http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/badges.htm The Fleur-de-lis and the Swastika]". ''"Johnny Walker's Scouting Milestones Pages''. November 2003.</ref> the earliest Scouting use was on the first Thanks Badge introduced in 1911. [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]]'s 1922 Medal of Merit design adds a swastika to the Scout [[fleur-de-lis]] as good luck to the person receiving the medal. Like Kipling, he would have come across this symbol in India. During 1934 many Scouters requested a change of design because of the use of the swastika by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazis]]. A new British Medal of Merit was issued in 1935.

[[Image:Lotta Sv<U+00E4>rd.jpg|frame|right|The [[Lotta Sv<U+00E4>rd]] emblem was designed by Eric Wasstr<U+00F6>m in 1921. It includes the swastika and [[heraldry|heraldic]] roses.]]

The symbol is emblazened into the back of the door of the "board room" in Aylesbury Grammar School as a monument to an old headmaster and supporter of Mosley's fascist movement in the UK during the [[1930]]'s and early 40's.  The headmaster was imprisoned, but no attempt to remove the swastika has been successful.  A new door is being considered.

===Finland===
In [[Finland]] the swastika was used as the official national marking of the [[Finnish Army|Army]] between 1918 and 1944, and also of the [[Finnish Air Force]] at that time. The swastika was also used by the [[Lotta Sv<U+00E4>rd]] organisation. The blue swastika was the good luck symbol used by the family of [[Sweden|Swedish]] Count [[Eric von Rosen]], who donated the first plane to the Finnish [[White Guard (Finland)|White Army]] during the [[Finnish Civil War]]. It has no official connection to the Nazi use of the swastika but represents the Cross of Freedom, the oldest order in Finland. This, however, remains for some people controversial, because Rosen was later one of the founding members of [[Nationalsocialistiska Blocket]], a Swedish Nazi [[political party]]. Rosen also gained a closer connection to Germany when [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]] married [[Carin von Kantzow]], whose sister was married to Rosen. The swastika also appeared in many Finnish medals and decorations. In the much respected wartime medals of honor it was a visible element, first drafted by [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]] 1918&ndash;19. The [[Mannerheim cross]] with a swastika is the Finnish equivalent of the [[Victoria Cross]], the [[Croix de guerre]] and the [[Medal of Honor]].
[[Image:President-Finland-Flag.png|thumb|150px|Flag of the [[President of Finland]]]]

===Iceland===
The Icelandic Steamship Company, [[Eimskip]] (founded in 1914) used a swastika in its logo.

===Ireland===
In [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], a laundry company known as the ''Swastika Laundry'' existed for many years in [[Ballsbridge]] on the south side of the city.  The company's fleet of electric delivery vans were red, and featured a black swastika on a white background.<ref>See [http://www.askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page_by_place.do?page_id=1255 http://www.askaboutireland.ie] for a picture of a vehicle made up to look like such a van, for the purposes of a television drama. Retrieved [[June 22]], [[2006]].</ref>  The business started in the early 20th century and continued up until recent times. The Laundry's tall chimneystack was emblazoned with a large white Swastika, which was clearly visible from the surrounding streets. One story tells how the physicist [[Erwin Schr<U+00F6>dinger]], in political exile in Ireland after fleeing the Nazi regime, was almost killed by one of these vans when crossing the street, and briefly believed an attempt had been made on his life by the Third Reich.  The name and logo eventually disappeared when the laundry was absorbed into the ''Spring Grove'' company.

===Latvia===
In [[Latvia]], too, the swastika (known as Thunder Cross and Fire Cross) was used as the marking of the [[Latvian Air Force]] between 1918 and 1934, as well as in insignias of some military units.<ref>Dov Gutterman, [http://fotw.vexillum.com/flags/lv%5Eair.html Latvia: Aircraft Marking], June 20, 2004.</ref> It was also used by the Latvian [[fascism|fascist]] movement [[Perkonkrusts]] (Thunder Cross in Latvian), as well as by other non-political organizations.
Latvian left facing swastika or Thunder Cross dates back to Bronze age. It is widely seen scratched on the surfaces like rocks, weapons and pottery as a protector sign.

===North America===
The [[Theosophical Society]], founded in New York in 1875, incorporated the Swastika into its seal because of the Hindu and Buddhist associations of the symbol, combining it with a [[Star of David]], [[Ankh]] and [[Ouroboros]].

The swastika's use by the Navajo and other tribes made it a popular symbol for the [[Southwestern United States]]. Until the 1930s, blankets, metalwork, and other Southwestern souvenirs were often made with swastikas. 

Arizona state highway markers up until 1940 featured a right-facing swastika superimposed on an arrowhead ([http://arizonaroads.com/maps/ Arizona Roads])
[[Image:Arizona highway marker.jpg|right|frame|Arizona state highway marker from late 1920's.]]

*In 1907, the [[Corn Palace]] in [[Mitchell, South Dakota]], featured a design that had a swastika on one of the towers.
In Rapid City, South Dakota, there were swastikas in the lobby of the Alex-Johnson Hotel.  They were decorations honoring the Native American culture of Western South Dakota. When the lobby was remodeled, they all disappeared.

*[[Swastika, Ontario|Swastika]] is the name of a small community in [[Northern Ontario|northern]] [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], approximately 580 kilometres north of [[Toronto]], and 5 kilometres west of [[Kirkland Lake, Ontario|Kirkland Lake]], the town of which it is now part. The town of Swastika was founded in 1906. [[Gold]] was discovered nearby and the Swastika Mining Company was formed in 1908. The government of Ontario attempted to change the town's name during World War II, but the town resisted.

*The foyer of Central High School in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] features right-facing swastikas set into the tile floor. The school was built in 1906.

*In [[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]], [[Nova Scotia]], there was an [[ice hockey]] team from 1905 to 1916 named the Swastikas, and their uniforms featured swastika symbols. There were also hockey teams named the Swastikas in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] (circa 1916), and [[Fernie, British Columbia|Fernie]], [[British Columbia]] (circa 1922).

*The [[U.S. 45th Infantry Division|45th Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] used a yellow swastika on a red background as a unit symbol until the 1930s, when it was switched to a [[Thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbird]].<ref>"[http://www.45thdivisionmuseum.com/History/SwastikaToThunderbird.html From Swastika to Thunderbird]".

*In 1925, [[Coca-Cola]] made a lucky watch formed in the shape of a swastika with the slogan, "Drink Coca Cola five cents in bottles".
*The Health, Physical Education and Recreation Building (HPER) at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] contains decorative Native American-inspired reverse swastika [[tile|tilework]] on the walls of the foyer and stairwells on the southeast side of the building.  HPER was built as the university [[fieldhouse]] in the 1920s, before the Nazi party came to power in Germany.  In recent years, the HPER swastika motif, along with the [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] murals in nearby Woodburn Hall have been the cause of much controversy on campus.
* The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] base at [[Coronado, California]] has a swastika-shaped building. [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=32+40%2734.09%22+N,+117+09%2727.96+W&btnG=Search&ll=32.676138,-117.157763&spn=0.006854,0.009849&t=k] This building predates World War II.
*Shortly after the beginning of World War II, several [[Indigenous peoples in the United States|Native American]] tribes (the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]], [[Apache]], [[Tohono O'odham]], and [[Hopi]]) published a decree stating that they would no longer use the swastika in their artwork. This was because the swastika had come to symbolize evil to them. This decree was signed by representatives of these tribes. The decree states:
: ''Because the above ornament which has been a symbol of friendship among our forefathers for many centuries has been desecrated recently by another nation of peoples.''
: ''Therefore it is resolved that henceforth from this date on and forever more our tribes renounce the use of the emblem commonly known today as the swastika or fylfot on our blankets, baskets, art objects, sandpainting, and clothing.''

===Poland===
[[Image:2PSP.jpg|thumb|240px|left|A military parade held in 1936 to commemorate the regimental feast of the 2nd Podhale Rifles Regiment; [[Sanok]], Poland]]
[[Image:KorpusowkaPodhalanczykow.png|thumb|110px|right|The ''highlander cross'' was the sign of Polish 21st and 22nd Mountain Infantry Divisions]]

Since the early [[Middle Ages]] the sign of the swastika was well-established among all [[Slavs|Slavic]] lands. Known as ''swarzyca'', it was primarily associated with one of the Slavic gods named [[Swarog]]. With time the significance of the symbol faded, but it was preserved in numerous cases as a personal symbol of various personalities, as was the case of the [[Boreyko Coat of Arms]]. It was also preserved in the folk culture of the region of [[Podhale]], where it was used as a [[talisman]] well into the 20th century. As a solar symbol, it was painted or carved on various parts of houses in the [[Tatra Mountains]] and was thought to save the household from evil. 
[[Image:Herb Boreyko.jpg|thumb|right|110px|[[Boreyko Coat of Arms]]]]
[[Image:LOPP.jpg|thumb|110px|left|The blue Swastika emblem was the insignia of the Polish League of Anti-air and Anti-gas Defence (''Liga Obrony Przeciw Lotniczej i Przeciwgazowej'').]]
The ancient symbol used by the [[G<U+00F3>ral]] societies was adopted by the [[Podhale rifles|Polish mountain infantry units]] in the 1920's. It was adopted as a regimental insignia by the artillery units of the [[Polish 21st Infantry Division|21st]] and [[Polish 22nd Infantry Division|22nd Infantry Divisions]], as well as by the soldiers of the [[Polish 4th Legions Infantry Regiment|4th Legions' Infantry]], the [[Polish 2nd Podhale Rifles Regiment|2nd]] and the  [[Polish 4th Podhale Rifles Regiment|4th Podhale Rifles]]. A distinctive blue swastika was a background emblem of [[The Airborne and Antigas Defence League]] (1928-1939, LOPP), which had circa 1,5 million members in 1937.

Outside of the military traditions, the mountaineer's swastika also influenced a number of other symbols and logos used on Polish soil. Among such was the logo of the IGNIS publishing company (est. 1822), and the personal symbol of [[Mieczys<U+0142>aw Kar<U+0142>owicz]], a notable composer and admirer of the Tatras. After his tragic death in the mountains in 1909, the place of his death was marked by a memorial stone and a swastika [http://www.idn.org.pl/medykon/tatry/pomnik.htm]. Finally, it was also used as a personal logo and [[ex libris]] by [[Walery Eliasz-Radzikowski]] of [[Boreyko Coat of Arms]], a Polish author who was also strongly influenced by the Polish mountaineers and had a swastika on the dust jackets of all his books and letters.

[[Image:ASEA logo pre 1933.jpg|thumb|125px|right|[[ASEA]] logo used from the late nineteenth century until 1933]]

===Russia===
The [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Russian Provisional Government]] of 1917 printed a number of new bank notes with right-facing, diagonally rotated swastikas in their centres.  Some have suggested that this may have been the inspiration behind the Nazis adoption of this symbol, as [[Alfred Rosenberg]] was in Russia at this time.

===Sweden===
The [[Sweden|Swedish]] company [[ASEA]], now a part of [[Asea Brown Boveri]], used the swastika in its logo from the 1890s to 1933, when it was removed from the logo.

==Nazi Germany== 
[[Image:Flag of Germany 1933.svg|right|thumb|The flag of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|NSDAP]]<br /><br />''Flag Ratio:'' '''3:5'''<br />''Flag Dimensions:'' '''60 x 100'''<br />''Disc Diameter:'' '''45'''<br />''Arm Width:'' '''6''']]

The [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' or ''NSDAP'') formally adopted the swastika or '''''Hakenkreuz''''' (hooked cross) in 1920. This was used on the party's flag (''right''), badge, and armband. It had also been used unofficially by the NSDAP and its predecessor, the German Workers Party, ''Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' (''DAP''). 

In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', [[Adolf Hitler]] wrote:

: I myself, meanwhile, after innumerable attempts, had laid down a final form; a flag with a red background, a white disk, and a black swastika in the middle. After long trials I also found a definite proportion between the size of the flag and the size of the white disk, as well as the shape and thickness of the swastika.

(Red, white, and black were the colors of the flag of the old [[German Empire]].)

The use of the swastika was associated by Nazi theorists with their conjecture of Aryan cultural descent of the German people. Following the [[Nordic theory|Nordicist]] version of the [[Aryan invasion theory]], the Nazis claimed that the early Aryans of [[India]], from whose Vedic tradition the swastika sprang, were the prototypical white invaders. It was also widely believed that the [[Indian caste system]] had originated as a means to avoid racial mixing. The concept of [[Racial purity]] was an ideology central to Nazism though it is now considered [[Scientific method|unscientific]]. For Rosenberg, the Aryans of India were both a model to be imitated and a warning of the dangers of the spiritual and racial "confusion" that, he believed, arose from the close proximity of races. 

Thus, they saw fit to co-opt the sign as a symbol of the Aryan [[master race]]. The use of the swastika as a symbol of the [[Aryan race]] dates back to writings of [[Emile Burnouf]]. Following many other writers, the German nationalist poet [[Guido von List]] believed it to be a uniquely Aryan symbol. When Hitler created a flag for the Nazi party, he sought to incorporate both the swastika and "those revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past and which once brought so much honor to the German nation" (red, white and black). He also stated that "the red expressed the social thought underlying the movement. White the national thought. And the swastika signified the mission allotted to us <U+2013> the struggle for the victory of Aryan mankind and at the same time the triumph of the ideal of creative work which is in itself and always will be anti-Semitic." (''Mein Kampf'').<ref>"[http://www.crusader.net/texts/mk/mkv2ch07.html Chapter of ''Mein Kampf'' discussing the symbolism of the flag]". [[April 03]], [[2006]]</ref>

In fact, the swastika was already in use as a symbol of German ''v<U+00F6>lkisch'' nationalists movements (''[[V<U+00F6>lkisch movement|V<U+00F6>lkische Bewegung]]''). In ''Deutschland Erwache'' (ISBN 0912138696), Ulric of England (''sic'') says &mdash;
[[Image:Thule-gesellschaft emblem.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thule Society]] Swastika]]
: <U+2026> what inspired Hitler to use the swastika as a symbol for the NSDAP was its use by the [[Thule Society]] ([[German language|Ger.]] Thule-Gesellschaft) since there were many connections between them and the DAP <U+2026> from 1919 until the summer of 1921 Hitler used the special Nationalsozialistische library of [[Friedrich Krohn|Dr. Friedrich Krohn]], a very active member of the ''Thule-Gesellschaft'', <U+2026> Dr. Krohn was also the dentist from Sternberg who was named by Hitler in ''Mein Kampf'' as the designer of a flag very similar to one that Hitler designed in 1920 <U+2026> during the summer of 1920, the first party flag was shown at Lake Tegernsee <U+2026> these home-made <U+2026> early flags were not preserved, the ''Ortsgruppe M<U+00FC>nchen'' flag was generally regarded as the first flag of the Party.

Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Erbez says &mdash;
:The first time the swastika was used with an "Aryan" meaning was on [[December 25]], [[1907]], when the self-named [[Order of the New Templars]], a secret society founded by [Adolf Joseph] Lanz von Liebenfels, hoisted at Werfenstein Castle ([[Austria]]) a yellow flag with a swastika and four fleurs-de-lys.<ref>Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Erbez. "[http://flagspot.net/flags/de%7Dns_or.html#ont Order of the New Templars 1907]". ''[[FOTW|Flags of the World]]''. [[January 21]], [[2001]].</ref>

However, Liebenfels was drawing on an already established use of the symbol. 

On [[14 March]] [[1933]], shortly after Hitler's appointment as Chancellor of Germany, the NSDAP flag was hoisted alongside Germany's national colors. It was adopted as the sole national flag on 15 September 1935.

The swastika was used for badges and flags throughout Nazi Germany, particularly for government and military organizations, but also for "popular" organizations such as the ''Reichsbund Deutsche J<U+00E4>gerschaft''.<ref>Santiago Dotor and Norman Martin. "German Hunting Society 1934-1945 (Third Reich, Germany)" ''[[FOTW|Flags of the World]]''. [[March 15]], [[2003]]. [http://flagspot.net/flags/de@dj933.html The flag of the ''Reichsbund Deutsche J<U+00E4>gerschaft'']</ref> 

While the DAP and the NSDAP had used both right-facing and left-facing swastikas, the right-facing swastika is used consistently from 1920 onwards. However, Ralf Stelter notes that the swastika flag used on land had a right-facing swastika on both sides, while the ensign (naval flag) had it printed through so that you would see a left-facing swastika when looking at the ensign with the flagpole to the right.<ref>Mark Sensen, Ant<U+00F3>nio Martins, Norman Martin, and Ralf Stelter.

Several variants are found:
*a 45<U+00B0> black swastika on a white disc as in the NSDAP and national flags;
*a 45<U+00B0> black swastika on a white lozenge (e.g., [[Hitler Youth]]<ref>Marcus Wendel et al. "[http://flagspot.net/flags/de%7Dns_hj.html Hitler Youth (NSDAP, Germany)]". ''[[FOTW|Flags of the World]]''. [[January 17]], [[2004]].</ref>);
*a 45<U+00B0> black swastika with a white outline was painted on the tail of aircraft of the [[Luftwaffe]];
*a 45<U+00B0> black swastika outlined by thin white and black lines on a white disc (e.g., the German War Ensign<ref>Norman Martin et al. "[http://flagspot.net/flags/de1938~w.html War Ensign 1938-1945 (Germany)]". ''[[FOTW|Flags of the World]]''. The ''"Reichskriegsflagge"''</ref>);
*an upright black swastika outlined by thin white and black lines on a white disc (e.g., Hitler's personal flag, in which a gold wreath encircles the swastika; the ''Schutzstaffel''; and the ''Reichsdienstflagge'', in which a black circle encircles the swastika);

There were attempts to amalgamate Nazi and Hindu use of the swastika. Notably by [[Savitri Devi Mukherji]] who declared Hitler an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] (see [[Nazi mysticism]]).

==Taboo in Western countries==
[[Image:FrenchCemetery103004-01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] defacement of a [[Judaism|Jewish]] cemetery in [[France]]. Although the most well-known version of the Nazi emblem featured a diagonal swastika, the orthogonal swastika, depicted here, has also been used as a symbol of Nazi ideology. (The markings on the gravestone at front left uses the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] logo rather than a swastika.)]]
Because of its use by Hitler and the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazis]] and, in modern times, by [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] and other [[hate group]]s, for many people in the West, the swastika is associated primarily with [[Nazism]], and [[white supremacy]] in general. Hence, outside historical contexts, it has become [[taboo]] in Western countries. For example, the German postwar [[Strafgesetzbuch|criminal code]] makes the public showing of the ''Hakenkreuz'' (the swastika) and other Nazi symbols illegal and punishable, except for scholarly reasons and for the purpose of showing opposition to Nazism (in which case the swastika is crossed out, broken, etc.).[http://www.spcm.org/Journal/article.php3?id_article=1869] It is not clear whether the German postwar code actually bans the construction of Hindu and Jain temples in Germany (Jain temples '''always''' have the swastika on their entrance and Jain ritual typically involves creating seven swastikas from grains of rice around the altar during prayer).

In [[Finland]] some military units still use the swastika ([http://www.ilmavoimat.fi/index.php?id=101],[http://www.ilmavoimat.fi/index.php?id=87],  [http://www.mil.fi./ruotuvaki/index.dsp?action=read_page&pid=36&aid=537]). In 1945 the Air Force changed its national emblem to a roundel but continued to use the swastika elsewhere. In 1963 the chain of the Grand Cross of the [[Order of the White Rose]] was changed. More recently, in [[25 October]] 2005 an official swastika emblem was adopted for use by the Air Force [http://www.helsinginsanomat.fi/uutiset/tuoreet/artikkeli/1101981442511].
The powerful symbolism acquired by the swastika has often been used in graphic design and propaganda as a means of [[reductio ad Hitlerum|drawing Nazi comparisons]]; examples include the cover of [[Stuart Eizenstat]]'s 2003 book ''[[Imperfect Justice]]'',<ref>Harry Kreisler. "[http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people3/Eizenstat/eizenstat-con0.html Conversation with Stuart E. Eizenstat]". ''Conversations with History''. Institute of International Studies, [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]. [[April 30, 2003]].</ref> publicity materials for [[Costa-Gavras]]'s 2002 film ''Amen'',<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1834183.stm Swastika film poster escapes ban]". ''[[BBC News]]''. [[February 21]], [[2002]].</ref> and a billboard that was erected opposite the U.S. Interests Section in [[Havana]], Cuba, in 2004, which juxtaposed images of the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] pictures with a swastika. It is even censored from the lithographs on boxes of model kits sold in Germany, and the decals that come in the box. Also, in [[Australia]], which has taken a considerable number of refugees who suffered under the Nazis, it is (legally) regarded as "racist".

In the leadup and aftermath of the invasion of Iraq some anti-Bush activists have used the swastika in association with [[George W. Bush]]. Nazi symbolism has also been used by musicians to express their disagreement with Bush's policies. This has caused some controversy for some outspoken artists. 

Founded in the 1970s, the [[Raelism|Ra<U+00EB>lian Movement]], a religious sect believing in the possibility of immortality by scientific progress, used a symbol that was the source of considerable controversy: an interlaced [[Star of David]] and swastika. In 1991, the symbol was changed to remove the swastika and deflect public criticism. The [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], which aims to study and recreate [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] history, imposes restrictions on its members' use of the swastika on their arms,<ref>"[http://www.sca.org/heraldry/coagloss.html Glossary of Terms]" of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]]. [[December 23]], [[2003]].</ref> although some arms dating to the early days of the group have the symbol.

[[Image:Raelian symbols.png|thumb|The [[Raelism|Ra<U+00EB>lian]] symbol, before 1991 and after|left]]In recent years, controversy has erupted when consumer goods bearing the symbol have been exported (often unintentionally) to North America. In 2002, [[Christmas cracker]]s containing plastic toy [[Giant Panda|panda]]s sporting swastikas were pulled from shelves after complaints from consumers in [[Canada]], although the China-based manufacturer claimed the symbol was presented in a traditional sense and not as a reference to the Nazis.<ref>"[http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2002/12/30/swastika021230 Toy pandas bearing swastikas a cultural mix-up]". ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]]''. [[December 30]], [[2002]].</ref>  In 1995, the City of [[Glendale, California]] scrambled to cover up over 900 [[cast iron]] lampposts decorated with swastikas throughout the downtown portion of the city; the lampposts had been manufactured by an [[United States|American]] company in the early 1920s, and had nothing to do with Nazism<ref>Scott H. Howard, City Attorney. "[http://www.ci.glendale.ca.us/lampposts.asp Report: Lampposts]". Memo to the City Council of [[Glendale, California]].</ref>.  In the late 1990s, after the destruction of an old building on the main street in  [[Tulare, California]], an ad for White King Soap from the early 1900s was discovered on an outer wall of the adjacent building.  The ad featured a playing card with a king and was adorned with left facing swastikas.  The ad caused much controversy and was vandalized on several occasions due to the combination of swastikas and the name "White King."

==Popular culture and modern media==
[[Image:Fogh7.jpg|thumb|Cartoon using the swastika as a means of criticising the [[Right wing]] in Danish politics]]
{{Main|Swastikas in popular culture}}
Swastikas or swastika-like shapes sometimes appear in modern popular culture, although in the Western world (where the symbol is still usually considered associated with Nazi Germany) considerably less so than in the East (where the symbol is used under a variety of cultural conditions and not considered offensive). An example is the use of the swastika in relation to the [[Flag of Denmark]] in a political satirical cartoon as a critical comment on the [[Right wing]] in [[Denmark|Danish]] politics.

==Contemporary usage==
===South Asian===
[[Image:Nepal-Communist.jpg|thumb|[[Samyukta Janamorcha Nepal]] electoral banner, 1994. The complete lack of any far-right connotations of the swastika in Asia is best illustrated by its use as a generic electoral symbol even by parties of the far-left.]]
In post-Independence India, electoral ballot papers have been stamped with a round swastika (similar to the Norse sun cross). Thus, that variant of the symbol is connected with political elections. Its use as a symbol of wealth, prosperity and good luck is ubiquitous in India, and the symbol is used as a decorative motif in most traditional Hindu homes and most religious ceremonies. Many businesses and other organisations, like the [[Ahmedabad Stock Exchange]], use the swastika in their logos. The Red Swastika was also suggested as an emblem of [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] in [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], but the idea was not put into practice [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/int-ifrc.html]. 

===Tajikistan===
In 2005 authorities in [[Tajikistan]] called for the swastika widespread adoption as a national [[symbol]]. President [[Imomali Rakhmonov]] declared the swastika an "[[Aryan]]" [[symbol]] and 2006 to be "the year of Aryan culture" a time to: <U+201C>study and popularize Aryan contributions to the history of the world civilization; to raise a new generation (of Tajiks) with the spirit of national self-determination; and to develop deeper ties with other ethnicities and cultures.<U+201D>[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/12/27f36005-4b37-4ada-87e0-034f33867c8e.html]

===White supremacists===
Some [[White supremacy|White supremacists]] and [[Right-wing politics|Right-wing]] groups among people of European Heritage use the swastika, claiming it as an [[Aryan]] [[symbol]].

===Coronado Naval Base===
A building complex on US Naval Base Coronado, outside San Diego, CA, forms the image of a swastika.  A large complex of four buildings are arranged to re-create the Swastika.
