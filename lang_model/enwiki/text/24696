'''Fabuland''' was a theme and product range of the [[Lego]] construction toy, aimed at young children, and set in a fantastical world of make-believe. Introduced in 1979, the range aimed to fill the gap between [[Lego Duplo|Duplo]] and the standard Lego product ranges. Aimed at both boys and girls, the range encouraged storytelling, and was the first theme to be extended into books, clothing, and a [[Edward and Friends|TV series]].<ref>{{Cite book|last = Lipkowitz|first = Daniel|title = The Lego Book|publisher = Dorling Kindersley|year = 2009|pages = 126|isbn = 9781405341691}}</ref>

== Characters ==

[[File:Lego Fabuland.JPG|right|thumb|A selection of Fabuland figures and cars]]
Fabuland sets featured [[anthropomorphic]] animal characters. These pieces were larger than standard Lego [[Minifigures]], but smaller than Duplo figures, and included movable arms, feet and head. Some of the characters appeared in more than one set, and were given names, and sometimes even stories. Recurring characters included Edward Elephant, Bonnie Bunny, Max Mouse, Clive Crocodile, and Wilfred Walrus.

==Style==

Fabuland had a distinctive cartoony style, which featured elements larger than typical Lego bricks. For example, a wall or a roof could be a single element. The connecting studs on the elements were of the same size as on regular bricks. Sets included buildings such as a home or a post office, vehicles such as cars and individual characters. The theme was similar to Lego Town, but less contemporary. For example, Fabuland featured 1920's-style cars and a steam boat.

After the discontinuation of Fabuland, bricks originally designed for the theme have appeared in other Lego themes. In particular, the Mickey Mouse theme from 2000 featured many Fabuland elements.
