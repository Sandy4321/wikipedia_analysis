He began performing as a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] in 1989 at the age of 19, and since 1997 has produced ten solo shows which have toured internationally. He has performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] and the Montreal [[Just for Laughs]] festival, earning three consecutive Perrier Award nominations for his Edinburgh shows in 2001, 2002 and 2003.

== Personal life ==
Originally from the Sydney suburb of [[Loftus, New South Wales|Loftus]], Hills developed an interest in comedy after discovering an inflight comedy channel on a plane at the age of eight. Hills was born without a right foot and wears a [[prosthesis]], which has become a frequent source of comedy in his act.<ref name="Di Fonzo, Benito">{{cite web |author=Di Fonzo, Benito | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts-reviews/adam-hills-joymonger/2007/05/17/1178995307115.html | title=Adam Hills: Joymonger |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=17 May 2007|accessdate=19 August 2008}}</ref> He studied for a Bachelor of Arts (Communications) at [[Macquarie University]], graduating in 1991.

In December 2009, Hills married [[opera]] [[soprano]] [[Ali McGregor]].<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/wedding-caps-a-top-month-for-adam-hills/story-e6frfmqr-1225824108869 "Wedding caps a top month for Adam Hills"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' (28 January 2010)</ref>

Their first child, a daughter named Beatrice Pearl, was born on 8 May 2010.

==Career==
===Stand-up career===
Hills entered the comedy scene in 1989 when he made his first appearance at the Sydney Comedy Store at the age of 19. He spent several years from 1991 splitting his time between stand-up gigs and breakfast radio, but by the mid-1990s Hills says the hours had become exhausting and he decided to focus on live comedy. In 1997 he premiered "Stand Up and Deliver", the first of 10 solo shows, all of which have toured internationally. He has travelled widely, performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and the Montreal Just For Laughs festival.<ref>{{cite web |author=Elliott, Tim | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/adam-hills-loves-bringing-people-together/2008/06/27/1214472741818.html | title=Mr Nice Guy |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=28 June 2008|accessdate=19 August 2008}}</ref> He has been nominated for three consecutive Perrier Comedy Awards for his 2001, 2002 and 2003 solo shows at the Edinburgh Fringe.<ref>{{cite web |author=Staff writer|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/a/452/adam_hills|title=Adam Hills|work=Chortle|date= |accessdate=19 August 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080829150440/http://chortle.co.uk/comics/a/452/adam_hills| archivedate= 29 August 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The title of his 2001 show, "Go You Big Red Fire Engine", was coined during a 1999 performance in Melbourne. Hills asked an audience member to yell his name to the audience and for the audience to yell it back, but instead the man yelled "Go you big red fire engine!"<ref name="hill be back">{{cite web |author=Burgess, Marissa | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/comedy/s/133/133570_hill_be_back.html | title=Hill Be Back |work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|date=14 October 2004|accessdate=19 August 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The phrase quickly became an audience chant, and Hills promised he would make it the name of his next show because, he says, "it was such an uplifting and genuinely silly moment."<ref>{{cite web |author=Whittaker, Andrea | url=http://www.reachout.com.au/default.asp?ti=1631 | title=Adam Hills |work=Reach Out! |date= |accessdate=19 August 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080726130000/http://www.reachout.com.au/default.asp?ti=1631 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 26 July 2008}}</ref> "Go You Big Red Fire Engine" later became the name of a second stand-up show and a comedy album; it also appeared in a Detroit newspaper, on a Swedish website and was yelled by Senator [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] in the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]].<ref name="hill be back" />

His artificial right foot is commonly used as a source of humour in his shows and the comedian has been known to remove it and pass it around. However, Hills had been performing live comedy for over a decade before he made reference to his prosthesis on stage, and it was only after "Go You Big Red Fire Engine" was nominated for a Perrier Award in 2001 that he began incorporating it into his act. Hills says he felt he could too easily have become a novelty act and that he "didn't want to be known as the one-legged comedian<U+00A0>... I wanted to prove myself as a comic before talking about this."<ref>{{cite web |author=Scott-Norman, Fiona | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/04/05/1017206254254.html | title=Unspeakably Funny |work=[[The Age]]|date=5 April 2006|accessdate=19 August 2008}}</ref>

Hills regularly has a [[sign language]] interpreter at his festival shows, a move sparked by a performance he did in [[Adelaide]] at a disability art conference.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hills, Adam | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/columnists/adam/060803_index.shtml | title=Sign Here If You're Normal |work=Ouch! |date=6 August 2003|accessdate=19 August 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> An interpreter had been provided at the show, and Hills found that it not only allowed the deaf audience members to enjoy his material but was also an entertaining and fascinating experience for the hearing audience members. "Now I have hearing people who will only book [for signer shows]," he says.<ref name="Di Fonzo, Benito" />
