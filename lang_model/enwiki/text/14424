'''Seoul Station''' is a major railway station in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].  The station is served by the [[Gyeongbu Line]], its [[Gyeongbu Line (KTX)|high-speed counterpart]] and the [[Gyeongui Line]], with frequent [[KTX|high-speed]], express, and local services to various points in [[South Korea]].

== Services ==
The station is the primary terminus for the [[Korea Train Express|KTX]] and express services to [[Busan Station|Busan]] and local service to [[Dorasan Station|Dorasan]].  The station is also served by about a dozen trains per day on the [[Honam Line]] and its [[Honam Line (KTX)|express counterpart]] to [[Gwangju Station|Gwangju]] and [[Mokpo Station|Mokpo]].  The station used to be the terminus for all long-distance trains on the [[Gyeongbu Line|Gyeongbu]], [[Honam Line|Honam]], [[Jeolla Line|Jeolla]], and [[Janghang Line|Janghang]] Lines, but in early [[2004]], the terminus for most [[Honam Line|Honam]], [[Jeolla Line|Jeolla]], and [[Janghang Line|Janghang]] Line trains was moved to [[Yongsan Station|Yongsan]].

Seoul Station is also served by [[Seoul Subway Line 1]] and [[Seoul Subway Line 4|Line 4]].

== History ==
The station opened in [[1900]] as "Gyeongseong Station" and was renamed "Namdaemun Station" in [[1905]], due to its proximity to [[Namdaemun]].  In [[1910]], the name of the city of [[Seoul]] changed from [[Hanseong]] to [[Gyeongseong]] ("Keijo" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), and the station reverted to the name "Gyeongseong Station" in [[1915]].

The old Keijo Station Building, designed by Professor [[Tsukamoto Yasushi]] of [[Tokyo Imperial University]], was finished in [[1925]].  This red brick building resembles [[Tokyo Station|Tokyo Station Building]].  The station was renamed "Seoul Station" in [[1947]].  The station was expanded throughout the post-[[Korean War]] era, and a new adjacent terminal was completed in [[2004]] in time for the new [[KTX]] high-speed rail service.
