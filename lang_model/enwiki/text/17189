'''''Midtown Madness''''' is a [[racing game|racing]] [[video game]] developed for the [[personal computer]] by [[Microsoft Game Studios]] and [[Angel Studios (San Diego)|Angel Studios]], and published by [[Microsoft]] in 1999. A downloadable [[game demo|demo]] was released on  [[January 21]] [[2001]].

The game puts the player in a vehicle on the streets of a recreated simulation of [[Chicago]], with numerous game modes available. There is no storyline; the goal of the game is to obtain all the available cars and win all the races. As well as having multiple game modes to choose from, players can manipulate the weather and traffic of Chicago. ''Midtown Madness'' supports [[multiplayer]] gaming over [[LAN]] or the [[internet]].

''Midtown Madness'' distinguished itself from other racing games by the amount of freedom given to players; where traditionally they would be restricted to a race track, Microsoft and Angel Studios added numerous shortcuts and bonus destinations to the Chicago they designed. The game was generally received positively and scored highly on [[aggregator]] review websites.<ref name=GameRankings /><ref name=MobyRank /> The game was praised for its fun aspect and general gameplay, though some reviewers pointed out that the game's [[non-player character|non-player]] graphics were poor

==Gameplay==
''Midtown Madness'' features four single-player race modes; Blitz, Checkpoint, Circuit, and Cruise. These are distinguished by their objectives<U+2014>in Blitz, the player races against the clock, in Checkpoint, the player races against other cars while dealing with traffic, and in Circuit, the player races through a traffic-free [[Race track|circuit]]. Cruise mode allows the player to drive freely around [[Chicago]]. Players choose from one of ten cars, although only five are initially available<U+2014>the rest can be obtained by achieving criteria such as winning a certain number of races in a specific mode.<ref name=IGNprev>{{cite web|url=http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/131/131322p1.html |title=Midtown Madness Preview|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Trent C.

Players can, before a race, alter the in game weather or the time of the race. Besides the change of environment, these alterations can affect the vehicle's performance. Additionally, the frequency with which [[police car]]s are encountered can be modified, as well as the amount of [[traffic]] and [[pedestrian]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firingsquad.com/games/mtmpreview/page2.asp |title=Details, details|publisher=FiringSquad|author=Bob Colayco|date=[[April 2]] [[1999]]|accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref>

The game is set in a city modeled on the city of Chicago. It includes notable landmarks such as the "[[The Loop (CTA)|El-Train]]", [[Sears Tower]], [[Wrigley Field]], and [[Soldier Field]].<ref name=FSprev1>{{cite web|url=http://www.firingsquad.com/games/mtmpreview/default.asp |title=Chi-town|publisher=FiringSquad|author=Bob Colayco|date=[[April 2]] [[1999]]|accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref> Chicago traffic is controlled by [[traffic light]]s, though the player is under no obligation to obey them.

''Midtown Madness'' supports [[multiplayer]] games in which several players can play together via [[LAN]], [[IP address]], or [[serial cable]] connection. When released, the game was supported by Microsoft's [[MSN Gaming Zone]], though this service was retired on [[June 19]], [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zone.msn.com/en/general/article/midtretiring.htm |title=Midtown Madness and Motocross Madness matchmaking has been retired on MSN Games&nbsp;<U+2013> thank you so much for playing!|publisher=[[MSN Gaming Zone]]|date=[[June 19]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2008-06-21}}</ref> The game is now supported by similar services such as [[GameSpy Arcade]] and [[XFire]], via [[DirectPlay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespyarcade.com/features/games.shtml#m |title=Supported Games (Alphabetical Listing) |publisher=[[GameSpy Arcade]]|accessdate=2008-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/interviews/november00/walla/index2.shtm |title=GameSpy interviews its own Byran "Walla" Gibson-Winge about programming GameSpy Arcade.|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|author=Sean Flinn|accessdate=2008-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfire.com/games/mmad/Midtown_Madness/ |title=Midtown Madness|publisher=[[XFire]]|accessdate=2008-06-21}}</ref> Multiplayer gameplay includes the Cops and Robbers game mode, which Clint Keith of Angel Studios said was the design team's favorite mode.<ref name=PCGpreview /> This mode, inspired by television program ''World's Deadliest Police Chases'', is a [[capture the flag]] style game in which players must secure gold and return it to their hideout.<ref name=IGNInt1 />

==Development==
''Midtown Madness'' was one of the first computer games developed by [[Angel Studios (San Diego)|Angel Studios]]. The studio had previously worked in other [[3D entertainment]] areas, such as the [[Nintendo 64]] console. Microsoft, meanwhile, followed up on their previous ''Madness'' computer games; ''[[Motocross Madness]]'' and ''[[Monster Truck Madness]]''."<ref name=IGNInt1 />

The original idea behind ''Midtown Madness'', according to project director Clint Keith, came to two Microsoft employees while they were "trying to cross a busy Paris street".<ref name=PCGpreview /> They proposed their idea for a game to Angel Studios, who at the time was attempting to sell Microsoft its [[3D computer graphics|3D vehicle simulator]]. Keith notes Angel Studios were initially hesitant to take up Microsoft on its offer of working on the game, as it "seemed too large a challenge to pull off".<ref name=PCGpreview /> They ultimately agreed, and chose Chicago for the backdrop because of its prominence in famous film car chases, such as ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' and ''[[The Blues Brothers]]''. To check that the city was faithfully recreated, Angel Studios had Chicago residents [[Game tester|playtest]] the game. [[Gary Whitta]] of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' reported that the city was mostly accurate, though some landmarks were changed to improve the gaming experience.<ref name=PCGpreview>{{cite news|title=Scoop! Midtown Madness|publisher=''[[PC Gamer]]''|author=[[Gary Whitta]]|date=March 1999|pages=34, 35}}<!-- Contact User:Giggy for magazine scan. --></ref>

The game was distinctly different to those and other racing games<U+2014>[[IGN]] noted the difference to the ''[[Need for Speed]]'' series<U+2014>in what Microsoft called "an unprecedented degree of freedom to drive around in a virtual city."<ref name=IGNInt1>{{cite web|url=http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/067/067312p1.html |title=Pedal to the Metal|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=IGN Staff|date=[[January 26]] [[1999]]|accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> Keith said the idea behind an "open space" game was to give more variety to gameplay, and "an element of discovery", using the example of the shortcuts players can take in game to reach the finish line before a faster car.<ref name=IGNInt1 /> Whitta described the game as "open racing"<U+2014>"you still have checkpoints to hit ...[but] you don't have to follow the A-B-C-D standard to do it".<ref name=PCGpreview />

Angel Studios and Microsoft decided to use some more commonly driven cars as part of ''Midtown Madness'', as well as the "overpowered Italian [[sports car]]s" often seen in racing games.<ref name=IGNDriversFound /> The developers had to obtain permission from the car manufacturers to use the likeness of the vehicles in the game. IGN reported that Microsoft received permission from [[Volkswagon]] for the [[Volkswagon Beetle|Beetle]], and was also planning on using the [[Ford]] [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]] and [[Ford F350|F350]].<ref name=PCGpreview /><ref name=IGNDriversFound>{{cite web|url=http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/067/067180p1.html |title=Drivers Found|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=IGN Staff|date=[[March 4]] [[1999]]|accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> At the start of the game, players can choose their car from half of the list of available vehicles; Angel Studios described this as promoting the "spirit of competitiveness"<U+2014>the design team not including any [[cheat code|cheats]] for unlocking cars also contributed to this.<ref name=sports />

Microsoft specifically told Angel Studios not to allow players to run over [[pedestrian]]s in the game. After deciding against using 2D pedestrians, Angel Studios developed 3D pedestrian models that were able to run and jump out of the way of cars. As pedestrians do not have an impact on gameplay, and as they can significantly affect system performance when in a group, Angel Studios included the option of not displaying them. This in part contributed to the game not requiring a 3D [[graphics card]].<ref name=PCGpreview />

A downloadable [[demo (gaming)|demo]] of the game was released on [[January 27]], [[2001]]. It featured the Mustang, [[Panoz Roadster]], and [[bus|City Bus]], as well as all of the available driving modes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=15688 |title=Midtown Madness Demo Coming Soon|publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]''|accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> It also featured "add-ons the game never enjoyed", such as the ability to send billboards flying.<ref name=demo>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=15698 |title=Midtown Madness Playable Demo|date=[[January 27]] [[2001]]|publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]''|accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> Numerous additional tracks and miscellaneous other features were released on the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=15850 |title=New Midtown Madness Tracks And Add-ons|date=[[January 27]] [[2001]]|publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]''|accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> Furthermore, Angel Studios announced they were considering releasing a custom map designer, but this eventuated.<ref name=sports>{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-gaming.com/racing/midtown_madness/interview1.shtml |title=Midtown Madness (PC) Interview|publisher=Sports Gaming Network|author=Joe McGinn|accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref>

Reception of the game has generally been positive. [[IGN]] rated game's appearance highly, noting that overall "the downtown portion of Chicago is portrayed very accurately", though generic looking portions of the city were noted.<ref name=IGNreview /> [[GameSpot]] approved of the variety in third person, first person dashboard, and widescreen driving views. However, it complained of the game suffering from "choppy frame rates" and unconvincing effects.<ref name=GSpotreview /> ''[[PC Zone]]'' praised Angel Studios for avoiding gimmicks, but instead presenting "accurately modelled cars and a meticulously recreated city" to the player.<ref name=PCZreview /> [[Allgame]] said ''Midtown Madness'' "possesses superb, immersive graphics", noting the changing times of day and weather. However, it noted that non-player cars were lacking in details.<ref name=Allgame /> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' said that as well as being "structurally and visually consistent", the Chicago setting in ''Midtown Madness'' was "brought to life".<ref name=CVGreview /> Total Video Games, however, called the game's presentation "far from optimal" even at the recommended [[system requirements]]. The reviewer pointed out a "a serious lack of detail" and blockiness, especially without a [[graphics card]].<ref name=TVG />

[[Image:Midtown madness screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|A heavily damaged [[Cadillac Eldorado]] hitting oncoming traffic while being pursued by a [[police car]]. [[GameSpot]]'s [[Greg Kasavin]] praised the game for moments like this, stating "it's fun to be able to drive like a maniac...because you know you can't in real life".<ref name=GSpotreview />]]
IGN described in-game narration by [[Marty Lennartz]] as a nice touch, but noted some [[glitch]]es among the otherwise "distinctive engine and horn sounds".<ref name=IGNreview /> GameSpot called the game's sounds exceptional, with its variety of car noises such as the "warning beeps when the bus goes in reverse".<ref name=GSpotreview /> ''PC Zone'' praised the in-game radio system, and the support for external media players.<ref name=PCZreview /> Allgame said players "get a dose of reality" with other drivers and pedastrians "hurling insults and exclamations your way",<ref name=Allgame /> while ''Computer and Video Games'' pointed out that a "city bus legitimately pulling out at a four-way junction can end your attempt instantly and tragically."<ref name=CVGreview /> Total Video Games was critical of the setting, arguing that it felt as if cars "are often driving without noticing you at all".<Ref name=TVG />

Reviews of ''Midtown Madness'' attributed most praise to its gameplay or "fun" elements. IGN wrote the game "doesn't rely heavily on driving authenticity; this game's all about fun", praising the simplicity whereby players can "pick a real-world car and go".<ref name=IGNreview /> GameSpot wrote "it's fun to be able to drive like a maniac...because you know you can't in real life."<ref name=GSpotreview />  ''Computer and Video Games'' said the game contained humor aspects, provided by other drivers, police, contenders (described as maniacs), and the "carnage that unfolds before your windscreen".<ref name=CVGreview /> ''PC Zone'' recommended the game, calling it highly refreshing, while Total Video Games said the game seemed a good choice, but suggested that it would be outdone by [[GT Interactive]]'s ''[[Driver (video game)|Driver]]'', released soon after.<ref name=TVG /> Allgame called it a "must-buy for the driving game enthusiast", and argued it would appeal to those who were not otherwise fans of the genre.<ref name=Allgame />
