[[Image:Bjarmaland, Carta Marina.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Biarmia as illustrated on [[Carta Marina]] ([[1539]]) by [[Olaus Magnus]].]]'''Bjarmaland''' (also spelled ''Bjarmland'' or ''Bjarmia'') was a territory mentioned in [[Norse saga]]s up to the [[Viking Age]] <U+2014> and beyond. Most scholars believe that the term refers to the south shores of the [[White Sea]] and the basin of the [[Northern Dvina]] River. Today, these areas comprise the [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]] of [[Russia]]. 

It is often assumed that the name is derived from a [[Finno-Ugric languages|Fenno-Ugric]] word ''[[Great Perm|perm]]'' which meant "travelling merchants".<ref name="stein">Steinsland & Meulengracht 1998:162</ref> However, some linguists consider this theory to be speculative.<ref>Saarikivi, Janne: ''Substrata Uralica. Studies in Finno-Ugric substrate in northern Russian dialects.'' Doctoral dissertation.

== Identification ==

The name Bjarmaland appears in old [[Norsemen|Norse]] literature, possible for the area where [[Arkhangelsk]] is presently situated, and where it was preceded by a Bjarmian settlement.  The first appearance of the name is in the ''[[Voyage of Ohthere]]'', which was undertaken ca 890. According to Ohthere, it was the first Scandinavian voyage to the Bjarmians, but this information is not reliable.<ref>[http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/iallt2003/oldenglish/OEparagraph-1.html Ohthere's voyage to Bjarmaland]. Original text and its English translation.</ref>

The name [[Komi peoples|Permian]] is found in the oldest [[Rus']], [[Nestor's Chronicle]] (1000-1100). The names of other [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] tribes are also listed including [[Veps]], [[Mari people|Cheremis]], [[Mordvin]] and [[Chudes]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Cp-tB08yd2EC&pg=PA21&ots=iOJ4ee16Aq&dq The Uralic Language Family: Facts, Myths and Statistics., p21-23 ISBN 0631231706]</ref>

The place-name was also used later both by the German historian [[Adam of Bremen]] (11th century) and the Icelander [[Snorri Sturluson]] (1179-1241) in ''[[B<U+00F3>sa saga ok Herrau<U+00F0>s]]'', reporting about its rivers flowing out to [[Gandvik]]. It's not clear if they reference the same Bjarmaland as was mentioned in the ''Voyage of Ohthere'', however. Bjarmian god ''Jomali'' <ref>Most probably originally the same as the Finnish ''jumala'', meaning ''god'', or its alternative in some other [[Finnic]] language. Based on this information, Finnic origin has often been proposed for Bjarmians.</ref> is  [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] but the description of the god is more Siberian, especially the crown adorned with twelve stars in gold, characteristic to Siberian shaman caps.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}

[[Olaus Magnus]] put Bjarmaland in the [[Kola Peninsula]]<ref>[http://www.bell.lib.umn.edu/map/OLAUS/carta.html Olaus Magnus Map of Scandinavia 1539]. See section C.</ref>, while [[Johannes Schefferus]] (1621 - 1679) argued it was equal to [[Lappmarken|Lappland]].

== Early contacts ==
[[Image:Ottars reise.jpg|thumb|350 px|A Norwegian map of the voyage of Ohthere.]]
According to the saga about the ''[[Voyage of Ohthere]]'', the [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] merchant [[Ottar from H<U+00E5>logaland|Ottar]] (Ohthere) reported to king [[Alfred the Great]] that he had sailed for several days along the northern coast and then southwards, finally arriving at a great river, probably the [[Northern Dvina]]. At the estuary of the river dwelt the ''Beormas'', who unlike the [[nomadic]] [[Sami people]]s were sedentary, and their land was rich and populous. Ohthere did not know their language but he said that it resembled the language of the [[Sami people]]. The Bjarmians told Ohthere about their country and other countries that bordered it. 

Later several expeditions were undertaken from Norway to Bjarmaland. In 920, [[Eirik Bloodaxe]] made a Viking expedition, as well as [[Harald II of Norway]] and [[Haakon Magnusson of Norway]], in 1090. 

The best known expedition was that of [[Tore Hund]] (Tore Dog) who together with some friends, arrived in Bjarmaland, in 1026. They started to trade with the inhabitants and bought a great many pelts, whereupon they pretended to leave. Later, they made shore in secret, and plundered the burial site, where the Bjarmians had erected an idol of their god ''Jomali''. This god had a bowl containing silver on his knees, and a valuable chain around his neck. Tore and his men managed to escape from the pursuing Bjarmians with their rich booty.

== Background ==
[[Image:Bajarmaland.jpg|thumb|350px|''The Northern Land'' ([[Viktor Vasnetsov]], 1899).]]
Modern historians suppose that the wealth of the [[Permians|Bjarmians]] was due to their profitable trade along the [[Dvina]], the [[Kama River]] and the Volga to [[Bolghar]] and other trading settlements in the south. Along this route, silver coins and other merchandise were exchanged for pelts and walrus tusks brought by the Bjarmians. Further north, the Bjarmians traded with the Sami who are said to have been tributaries to the Bjarmians.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}

It seems that the Scandinavians made some use of the Dvina trade route, in addition to the [[Volga trade route]] and [[Dnieper trade route]]. In 1217, two Norwegian traders arrived in Bjarmaland to buy pelts; one of the traders continued further south to pass to Russia in order to arrive in the [[Holy Land]], where he intended to take part in the [[Crusades]]. The second trader who remained was, however, killed by the Bjarmians. This caused Norwegian officials to undertake a campaign of retribution into Bjarmaland which they pillaged in 1222.

The 13th century seems to have seen the decline of the Bjarmians, who became tributaries of the [[Novgorod Republic]]. While many Slavs fled the [[Mongol invasion of Russia|Mongol invasion]] northward, to [[Beloozero]] and Bjarmaland, the displaced Bjarmians sought refuge in [[Norway]], where they were given land in [[Malangen]], by [[Haakon IV of Norway]], in 1240. More important for the decline was probably that, with the onset of the [[Crusades]], the trade routes had found a more westerly orientation or shifted considerably to the south.

When the Novgorodians founded [[Velikiy Ustiug]], in the beginning of the 13th century, the Bjarmians had a serious competitor for the trade. More and more [[Pomors]] arrived in the area during the 14th and 15th centuries, which led to the final subjugation and assimilation of the Bjarmians by the Slavs.
