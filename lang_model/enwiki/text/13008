{{Other uses|Brief (disambiguation)}} 
'''Briefs''' are a type of short, tight [[underwear]] and [[swimsuit|swimwear]], as opposed to styles where the material extends down the legs.

A main difference between male briefs and female briefs is that male briefs are often designed with a seam or much larger pouch in the crotch area to accommodate a [[wikt:bulge|bulge]]. This is because men and boys have larger external genitals in comparison to women or girls, thus require more fabric in the crotch area.<ref>New York Magazine - 29 Apr 1985 - Page 30</ref><ref>MENS UNDERWEAR, JS Atlee - US Patent 3,517,666, 1970</ref>

See [[swim briefs]] for the case of briefs as swimwear.

==History==
Briefs were first sold on January 19, 1935 by [[Jockey International|Coopers, Inc.]], in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. They dubbed the new undergarment the "Jockey" because it offered a similar degree of support as the [[jockstrap]] (one style of which is also called ''Jock brief'' or [[Support briefs]]). Thirty-thousand pairs were sold within three months of their introduction. In [[North America]], "Jockey shorts" or "Jockeys" is often used as a [[genericized trademark|generic term]] for men's briefs.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], briefs were first sold in 1938. Soon, shops were selling 3,000 briefs per week. They were so popular that in 1948, every member of the British Olympic team was given a free pair of briefs.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the term "jockeys" has not caught on and briefs are often referred to as "Y-fronts". The term derives from the inverted Y-shape formed by the seams at the front of the [[underpants]] which purports to allow easy access to the penis for urination. The [[colloquialism]] is used even when the fly opening may differ in style, and not actually form the shape of the inverted letter "Y" fly on Cooper Jockey brand briefs. <!--Nonsense?: Or, these are often called as "skimpies". There are certain cases that people with these are called names severely using this name.-->

In [[Australia]], briefs are referred to as "jocks", but should not be confused with [[jockstrap]]s (more specifically used by athletes) which expose the buttocks. Australians generally use the word briefs to refer to the bikini-style underwear for men, which do not have the Y-front opening. 

In the [[United States]], a slang term for briefs is "tighty-whiteys" (with various spellings and inversions: "tidy-whities", "whitie-tighties", etc.). The exact origin of the term is unknown, but it has often been used as an epithet.

In recent years, a hybrid called [[boxer briefs]] has become popular. Like boxers, they have short legs, but like briefs, they are made of elastic, snug-fitting material. A shorter version of boxer briefs are called [[trunks (clothing)|trunks]].

==Design==
Briefs often feature a [[Fly (clothing)|fly]] - a covered opening on the front of the garment which allows for convenience at [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]]s. There are several different fly designs in common use, including but not limited to the standard vertical fly, the horizontal fly, and the y-front fly. The use of a fly is optional, and many styles do not utilize a fly at all.

Traditional size briefs for both sexes cover the upper part of the thigh and extend upward up to (or cover, depending on the design) the navel. This style is often referred to as "full rise" or "full cut". There are also "low rise" and "mid rise" styles whose measurements vary between manufacturers.

==Men's briefs==
In the case of [[underpants|men's underwear]], briefs, unlike [[boxer shorts]], hold the wearer's [[male genitalia|genitals]] in a relatively fixed position, which make briefs a popular underwear choice for men who are participating in athletic activities or who feel they need more support than loose-fitting underwear can provide. In addition, boxers often ride up the body when the wearer is running.

==Women's briefs==

'''Briefs''' also refers to a style of women's and girls' [[panties]] that is typically cut with a high waist to provide full coverage of the hips and buttocks.  A [[control brief]] is a kind of high-waisted panty [[girdle]].  French-cut or high-cut briefs expose more of the front part of the thigh, while [[boyshorts|boy briefs]] have short legs, similar to men's [[boxer briefs]], often combined with a lower waist. 

'''Briefs''' is also the name given to costumed outerwear worn by female dancers and athletes in sports such as [[cheerleading]], [[figure skating]], and [[tennis]].  These briefs are typically worn under a short [[skirt]]; they may be attached to the skirt or dress body, or a separate garment ("cheer briefs").

==Briefs and fertility==

Tight briefs have been blamed for negatively affecting the [[sperm count]], since they may interfere with the cooling of the [[testicle|testes]].<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/features/boxers-vs-briefs-increasing-sperm-count WebMD, Boxers vs Briefs]</ref> However, not all research has come to the same conclusion. A study in the October 1998 Journal of Urology, for example, concluded that underwear type is unlikely to have a significant effect on male fertility.<ref>http://www.brucegilbertmd.com/uploads/assets//Journal_Articles/boxersvbriefs.pdf A critical analysis of the role of underwear type in male subfertility</ref>
