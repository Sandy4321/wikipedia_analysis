'''Brooks & Dunn''' was an American [[country music]] duo consisting of [[Kix Brooks]] and [[Ronnie Dunn]], who were both vocalists and songwriters. The duo was founded in 1990 through the suggestion of [[Tim DuBois]]. Before the foundation, both members were solo recording artists. Brooks wrote songs for [[John Conlee]], [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] and [[Highway 101]] and released a solo album for [[Capitol Records]]; both he and Dunn also charted two solo singles apiece in the 1980s.

Signed to [[Arista Nashville]] in 1991, the duo recorded ten studio albums, one Christmas album and three compilation albums for the label. They also released fifty singles, of which twenty went to number one on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and nineteen more reached top ten. Two of these number-one songs, "[[My Maria]]" (a cover of the [[B.W. Stevenson]] song) and "[[Ain't Nothing 'Bout You]]", were the top country songs of 1996 and 2001, respectively, according to the [[Billboard Year-End]] charts. The latter is also the duo's longest-lasting number one, at six weeks. Several of their songs have also reached the [[Billboard Hot 100]], with the number 25 peaks of "Ain't Nothing 'bout You" and "[[Red Dirt Road (song)|Red Dirt Road]]" being their highest there. Brooks & Dunn also won the [[Country Music Association]] Vocal Duo of the Year award every year between 1992 and 2006, except for 2000. Two of Brooks & Dunn's songs also won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]: "[[Hard Workin' Man (song)|Hard Workin' Man]]" in 1994 and "My Maria" in 1996. All but two of the duo's studio albums are [[Music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]; their highest-certified is their 1991 debut ''[[Brand New Man]]'', which is certified sextuple-platinum for shipments of six million copies.

The duo's material is known for containing influences of [[honky-tonk]], mainstream country, and [[rock music|rock]], as well as the contrast between Brooks' and Dunn's singing voices and on-stage personalities, although some of their music has also been criticized as formulaic. Their 1992 single "[[Boot Scootin' Boogie]]" helped re-popularize [[line dancing]] in the United States, and 2001's "[[Only in America (song)|Only in America]]" was used by both [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]] in their respective presidential campaigns. Brooks & Dunn has collaborated with several artists, including [[Reba McEntire]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Mac Powell]], [[Billy Gibbons]] and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] among others.

Brooks & Dunn announced their retirement in August 2009 and performed their final concert on September 2, 2010 at the [[Bridgestone Arena]] in Nashville, Tennessee. Both Brooks and Dunn have continued to record for Arista Nashville as solo artists. Dunn released a [[Ronnie Dunn (album)|self-titled album]] in 2011 which included the Top 10 country hit "[[Bleed Red]]", while Brooks entered the Top 40 in mid-2012 with "New to This Town".

Steve Huey of Allmusic contrasts Brooks' and Dunn's voices, saying that Dunn "was the quietly intense singer with the soulful voice, while Kix Brooks played the part of the high-energy showman."<ref name="allmusic"/> He also describes their sound as "a winning formula of rambunctious, rocked-up honky tonk with punchy, danceable beats [alternated with] smooth, pop-tinged ballads."<ref name="allmusic"/> In the book ''The New Generation of County Music Stars'', David Dicaire describes Dunn as "posess[ing] a soulful voice with a quiet intensity" and a "traditional country singer", while calling Brooks "the opposite to Dunn's musical personality," "a high-energy showman" and "the perfect accompaniment to his partner".<ref name="newgen">{{cite book|last=Dicaire|first=David|title=The New Generation of Country Music Stars: Biographies of 50 Artists Born After 1940|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ce2IuErOokkC&pg=PA137&dq=%22lost+and+found%22+%22kix+brooks%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dL-oT_jxBKGJ6QGyiaCdBA&ved=0CFIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22lost%20and%20found%22%20%22kix%20brooks%22&f=false|publisher=McFarland|page=137}}</ref> Brooks sang lead on "Lost and Found", "Rock My World", "You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone",<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jessen|first=Wade|date=19 August 1995|title=Country Corner|journal=Billboard|page=26|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xgsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=%22lost+and+found%22+%22kix+brooks%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dL-oT_jxBKGJ6QGyiaCdBA&ved=0CGUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22lost%20and%20found%22%20%22kix%20brooks%22&f=false}}</ref> "Mama Don't Get Dressed Up for Nothing",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&p_theme=sl&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB0508B58B1DB1B&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=''The Greatest Hits Collection'' review|last=Dickinson|first=Chris|date=31 October 1997|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref> "Why Would I Say Goodbye"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=Deborah Price|date=15 March 1997|title=Single reviews|journal=Billboard|page=64|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aA4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64&dq=%22why+would+i+say+goodbye%22+%22kix+brooks%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1cKoT4W5JeLw0gGZp4GJBQ&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22why%20would%20i%20say%20goodbye%22%20%22kix%20brooks%22&f=false}}</ref> and "South of Santa Fe".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Deborah Evans|date=1 May 1999|title=Single reviews|journal=Billboard|page=22|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bw0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&dq=%22south+of+santa+fe%22+%22kix+brooks%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UsSoT63INsTt0gGglq2kBQ&ved=0CEUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22south%20of%20santa%20fe%22%20%22kix%20brooks%22&f=false}}</ref>
