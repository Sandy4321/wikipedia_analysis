'''Charlotte Pass''' is a location (elev. 1,837&nbsp;m) in the [[Snowy Mountains]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] where the [[Kosciuszko Road]] crosses [[Kangaroo Ridge]]. The location is also often referred to as '''Charlotte's Pass''', both colloquially and in official documents.<ref name="dewhanrp">{{cite web |title=National recovery plan for the Threatened Alpine Flora |publisher=[[Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts]] |date=3 September 2007 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/recovery/alpine-flora/index.html}}</ref>[[Image:Charlotte Pass, winter view.jpg|thumb|left|Looking through Charlotte Pass towards the main range in winter.]]

'''Charlotte Pass Village''' (elev. 1,760&nbsp;m) is located at the base of Kangaroo Ridge to the south east of the pass, and is the highest permanent settlement in Australia.

The area is part of [[Kosciuszko National Park]].

The pass and village are named after [[Charlotte Adams]] who, in 1881, was the first European woman to climb Mount Kosciuszko.<ref name="smrto">{{cite web |title=Charlotte Pass |publisher=Snowy Mountains regional tourism organisation |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://snowymountains.com.au/Charlotte_Pass.html}}</ref>

The Kosciuszko Road now terminates at Charlotte Pass. The last 9 kilometres leading to [[Mount Kosciuszko]] have been closed, for environmental reasons, since 1982.<ref name="nswwrij">{{cite web |title=NSW Wilderness Red Index - Jagungal |publisher=Colong Foundation for Wilderness Ltd. |date=1999-09 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www.colongwilderness.org.au/RedIndex/NSW/Jagu99.htm}}</ref>

==History==
The historic [[Kosciuszko Chalet]] was the first building in the village, and was opened on 10 May 1930. The Chalet at Charlotte Pass was one of several alpine area accommodation facilities built by government in Australia, and offered an opulent life style at the time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Recreation in the Australian Alps |publisher=[[Department of the Environment and Heritage (Australia)]], Australian Alps national parks Co-operative Management Program |date=2005-01-24 |accessdate=2008-12-01 |url=http://www.australianalps.deh.gov.au/publications/edukit/rec.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080720114000/http://www.australianalps.deh.gov.au/publications/edukit/rec.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-07-20}}</ref>

The Chalet burnt down in August 1938, and a new Chalet was built in its place the following summer.  [[Image:The Chalet Charlotte Pass Village.jpg|thumb|left|The Chalet during August]] The Chalet is still the largest and most significant building in the village, and remains the heart of the village in winter.

Apart from the Chalet, the village contains 12 commercial and club lodges,<ref name="rlerw">{{cite web |title=Register of leases, easements and rights of way |publisher=[[New South Wales Department of Environment and Climate Change]] |date=14 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www2.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/npws.nsf/Content/Register+of+leases+easements+and+rights+of+way}}</ref> and has the capacity to hold 607 guests.<ref name="cpsra">{{cite web |title=Charlotte Pass Ski Resort - About |publisher=Charlotte Pass Village.

The village and resort precinct are part of the [[Kosciuszko National Park]], and the village is leased to and operated by Charlotte Pass Village Pty Ltd (CPV); all leases are due to expire by June 2015.<ref name="rlerw"/>

The area was one of the end points for the longest ski lift in the world, constructed from the [[Thredbo, New South Wales|Thredbo]] Valley in 1964. Because of high winds and technical difficulties it was closed after one season.<ref name="nswwrij"/> The cable snapped{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}.

==Recreation==
=== Skiing===
An area between [[Kangaroo Ridge]], [[Mount Stillwell]] ridge, and [[Guthries Ridge]] is formally designated as the Charlotte Pass Alpine Resort.<ref>{{cite web |title=Charlotte Pass Alpine Resort - Precinct Map |publisher=[[New South Wales Department of Infrastructure]], Planning and Natural Resources |year=2004 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/plansforaction/pdf/charlotte_pass_precinct_arp.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Charlotte Pass Alpine Resort Precincts |publisher=[[New South Wales Department of Planning]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/plansforaction/pdf/Charlotte_Pass_Precinct_SEPP2.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

It is the oldest and highest ski resort in Australia.<ref name="cpsra"/>

The resort contains five ski lifts, one triple [[chairlift]], one [[T-bar]], two [[platter lift]]s and a beginner's moving carpet (which replaced a rope tow in 2008), accessing 50 hectares of skiable terrain.<ref name="cpsra"/> The highest lifted elevation is 1,964&nbsp;m; the base elevation 1,755&nbsp;m; giving a downhill skier's vertical of 210&nbsp;m.<ref name="cpsra"/> The resort currently only lifts to part of its leased area. A small terrain park was first constructed in 2008. The resort has a few mobile snow guns to top up high traffic areas and help open difficult terrain areas earlier in the season. A list of every ski tow to ever operate at Charlotte Pass can be found at [http://wikiski.com/wiki/index.php/Australian_ski_tow_directory wikiski]

The resort is also very popular with cross-country skiers, as the village provides immediate access to Australia's highest peaks.<ref>{{cite web |title=11 Years of the CCCSC Kosciuszko Tour - 1993 to 2003 |publisher=Canberra Cross-Country Ski Club |date=2004-08-20 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www.cccsc.asn.au/Text/History/KTinfo20.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080424091227/http://www.cccsc.asn.au/Text/History/KTinfo20.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-24}}</ref>

The resort receives, on average, more natural snow than other Australian resorts because of its elevation. In 1981, one weather event dropped snow to the extent that the Kangaroo Ridge triple chair terminus was buried in snow, over the top of the pylon, by the cornice by up to 0.5&nbsp;m.<ref>Photograph displayed in dining room of Tar Gan Gil lodge, Charlotte Pass Village</ref> This level of snow fall is an exception.<ref>{{cite web |title=Climate Education - Abundant snow seasons |publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]], Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp5.htm |accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref>

The Charlotte Pass ski area might be the only area in [[Australia]] with viable natural snow in several years' time, owing to the impact of [[global warming]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Australian ski resorts must diversify or perish: ANU study |publisher=[[Australian National University]] |date=10 June 1997 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://info.anu.edu.au/OVC/Media/Media_Releases/_1997/snow.html }}</ref>

===Cycling===
=== Bushwalking===
During the summer, Charlotte Pass is a base for bushwalkers with intent to walk to the top of [[Mount Kosciuszko]] and access the [[Main Range]]. The mountain is an 18&nbsp;km round trip via the [[Summit Walk]], or a 22&nbsp;km loop via the post [[glacial]] [[Lakes Walk]].<ref name="smrto"/>

A shorter and easier walk to the Kosciuszko summit can be accessed via [[Thredbo, New South Wales|Thredbo]].  The [[Blue Lake (New South Wales)|Blue Lake]] can be accessed by a 4-hour round-trip walk from Charlotte Pass.

==Access==
In summer, access is by [[Kosciuszko Road]] from [[Jindabyne, New South Wales|Jindabyne]].<ref name="smrto"/>

In winter, the area is snow-bound and can only be accessed by snowmobile from the [[Perisher Valley]] [[SkiTube]] terminal, which lies 8 kilometres to the north east, also via [[Jindabyne, New South Wales|Jindabyne]]. Charlotte Pass Village Pty Ltd operates a fleet of three 18 seat 4x4 buses running on snow tracks which ferry visitors in and out of the village every half hour{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}.

The area has not always been regarded as being easily accessible to all people. In the mid 20th century, the Chalet at Charlotte Pass was referred to as a ''breeding ground for snobocracy'' by local [[politician]] [[John Wesley Seiffert]] who by public criticism obtained a reduced bus fare to the area, thus opening the snowfields to a wider range of people.<ref>{{cite web |title='Seiffert, John Wesley (1905 - 1965)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition |publisher=[[Australian National University]] |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160245b.htm}}</ref>

==Environment==
Being an alpine area the area is subject to extremes in temperature, and is a recognised environmentally sensitive zone.<ref name="dewhanrp"/>

The area has been long been used as a base for environmental research, for example for [[plankton]] studies in the nearby post glacial lake [[Blue Lake (New South Wales)]] in 1937 using a flat bottomed boat,<ref>{{cite web |title=WISENET Journal, Number 44, July 1997, Dr Isobel Bennett, AO - An oral history interview by Diana Wyndham |publisher=Women in Science Enquiry Network Inc. |date=1997-01 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www.wisenet-australia.org/ISSUE44/isobelb.html}}</ref> and more recently, for example in 1997 as a heliport for studies of the [[Mountain Pygmy Possum|mountain pygmy possum]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Re-assessment of ''burramys parvus'' population size and distribution of habitat in [[Kosciuszko National Park]]: 1997 Progress Report. |publisher=[[Australian Institute of Alpine Studies]] |date=2 May 1998 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www.aias.org.au/newsletters/newslet2.html}}</ref>

Charlotte Pass has a [[subpolar oceanic climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification|K<U+00F6>ppen]] ''Cfc'') though the higher peaks have an [[alpine climate]] (''ETH''). It has the coldest recorded temperature in Australia (excluding Antarctic territories), of -23.0<U+00B0>C on 28 June 1994.<ref>{{cite web |title=1301.0 - Year Book Australia, 2008 |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |date=7 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/ABS@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/77B606A652911396CA2573D200106C95?opendocument}}</ref>

The area's highest recorded temperature is 33.5<U+00B0>C.<ref name="kpc">{{cite web |title=Kosciuszko National Park - Climate |publisher=[[New South Wales Department of Environment and Climate Change]] |date=22 April 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www2.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/parks.nsf/ParkContent/N0018?OpenDocument&ParkKey=N0018&Type=S}}</ref>

Average temperatures range in summer from about 4<U+00B0>C to 17<U+00B0>C and in winter from about -2<U+00B0>C to 2<U+00B0>C.<ref name="kpc"/>

Annual rain fall averages 2329.6&nbsp;mm,<ref name="kpc"/> with about half falling as snow between late May to late September, although conditions result in snow depth typically never exceeding 2.5&nbsp;m to 3&nbsp;m. Official snow depths are not recorded for Charlotte Pass, but are recorded by the [[Snowy Hydro Limited]] at nearby Spencers Creek (elev. 1,830&nbsp;m). A typical snow depth at its peak is about 1.5&nbsp;m to 2&nbsp;m.<ref>{{cite web |title=Australian Snow Statistics |publisher=Michael Paine - Sydney Australia |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://users.tpg.com.au/users/mpaine/snow.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Snow Depth Chart - 1968 to 2007 |publisher=South East Printing, Cooma |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www.thredbo.com.au/images/pdf/SEPSnowdepthChart.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Chart of Snow Depths |publisher=Canberra Cross-Country Ski Club |year=1999 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www.cccsc.asn.au/Text/snochart.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080722180611/http://www.cccsc.asn.au/Text/snochart.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-07-22}}</ref>

Snow falls have been recorded at all times of the year, some persisting on the ground for days even in the middle of summer.<ref name="stohexec">{{cite web |title=Preliminary Report on Meteorological Aspects of the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race - Executive Summary |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology, Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts

==Management and services==
The area is subject to a wide range of government legislation and environmental plans,<ref name="knpcm"/> and, owing to the environmental sensitivity of the area, is one of the most heavily regulated areas in Australia.

Services such as garbage collection and sewage processing are the responsibility of the area's lessee.
