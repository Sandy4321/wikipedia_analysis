The '''Snyder Estate Natural Cement Historic District''' is located in the [[Rosendale, New York|Town of Rosendale]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. It is a {{convert|275|acre|ha|adj=on}} tract roughly bounded by [[Rondout Creek]], Binnewater and Cottekill roads and Sawdust Avenue. [[New York State Route 213|NY 213]] runs through the lower portion of the district, paralleling the dry bed of the [[Delaware and Hudson Canal]], where the product that gives the district its name was first discovered.

Within the district's bounds are 122 [[contributing property|contributing properties]] representing what remains of five plants that turned out [[Rosendale cement]], and the homes and dependencies of the Snyder family, who originally owned the land. They range in age from the bed of the canal, where the cement was first discovered in 1825 during construction, to some of the last factories built before production was ended in 1970. Included are not just homes, barns and factories but mines, reservoirs and a [[siding (rail)|rail siding]]. After an aborted attempt to secure [[National Historic Landmark|National Historic Landmark District]] status in 1978, the [[historic district|district]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1992.

==Geography==

The district is shaped like a letter "r", solidly bounded by the roads and creek on three of its sides, but with its eastern boundary mostly following old roads between Route 213, Binnewater and Sawdust. Physically, it is dominated by two large hills, [[foothill]]s of the [[Shawangunk Ridge]] to the south, which rise to over 300 feet (91 m) in elevation, more than {{convert|200|ft|m}} above the creek's waters to the south. 

Between them in a narrow valley sit the remains of one the largest cement plants in it. An old [[Wallkill Valley Railroad]] [[siding (rail)|siding]] runs from there to the northeast corner near where it once joined the main line at today's [[Binnewater Historic District]]. Old mines and quarries are tunneled into the sides of both hills.

The property is mostly wooded save for the developed areas. Some of the areas along the road are old fields, today [[meadow]]s.

==History==

Almost as soon as it was initially discovered, production of the cement within the bounds of the district grew rapidly. That changed with the development of Portland cement at the end of the century. Production dropped as demand fell, and only through the creativity of one of the Snyder descendants did the company remain in operation to 1970.

===19th century===

The property had been owned and farmed by the Snyder family since 1755. In 1809, Christopher and Deborah Snyder commissioned a house for their newlywed son Jacob Lowe Snyder, with an accompanying [[gristmill]] on the creek. Known today as the Century House, it is the oldest extant building in the district whose age is precisely known.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

Sixteen years later, Jacob ceded a portion of his land to [[John Jervis]] of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, allowing it to be built across the property with the condition that the company build him a [[Slipway|slip]] so he could use it to ship his produce to market, and a bridge to reach his mill. Crews excavating the area a short while later found large deposits of [[dolostone]], an [[argillaceous minerals|argillaceous mineral]] that could be turned into natural [[cement]], which needed no additives once pulverized and mixed.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

Since similar cement had made construction of the [[Erie Canal]] possible, the company began setting up production facilities almost immediately. Not only would many of the finished canal [[lock (canal)|locks]] use this new cement, it would guarantee the canal another customer besides the [[anthracite]] coal miners it was built to serve.<ref name="cement discovery">{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Rinaldi|title=Hudson Valley Ruins: Forgotten Landmarks of an American Landscape|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8bJ6ai_KRL0C&pg=PA129&dq=Rosendale+Cement%2Bdiscovery&sig=ACfU3U1T8JJuxgGxWDjavPE7BryzHQgLDg|accessdate=2007-10-23|date=2006|publisher=[[University Press of New England]]|location=[[Lebanon, New Hampshire]]|isbn=1584655984|page=129|quote=Immediately upon its discovery, quarries were built, kilns erected and production commenced under contract}}</ref> In 1830 Snyder leased the southeastern corner of his property to Watson Lawrence, who had already built a cement plant on adjacent land. Other mines and cement plants opened up in the {{convert|32|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} area along the Rondout as well, creating a virbant local industry.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

He reinvested a lot of the Lawrence Cement Company's profits in improving its technical quality, and courted procurers for large, high-profile government projects like New York City's [[Old Croton Aqueduct|Croton Aqueduct]] and the docks at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]].<ref name="NRHP nom" /> This helped create a reputation for quality, and soon "Rosendale cement" became a [[Generic brand|generic term]] for any such natural cement regardless of where it was produced.<ref name="Traditional Masonry">{{cite web|last=Grunwald|first=Gayle|coauthor=Werner, Dietrich|title=Keeping Natural Cement Alive|url=http://www.traditionalmasonry.com/Articles/203/203-keeping_natural_cement_alive.cfm|publisher=Professional Trade Publications|work=Traditional Masonry|date=Fall 2007|accessdate=2008-09-07|quote=Rosendale was such a leader in cement production that Rosendale cement had become the generic name for American-made natural cement no matter where it was manufactured ... Musicians have recorded in the mine because of its exceptional acoustics}}</ref> But it also strained the company's finances, and after several crises the company finally failed for good in 1858.<ref name="NRHP nom" />
[[Image:1875 Lawrenceville cement plant.png|left|thumb|The Lawrenceville Cement plant, ca. 1875]]
Lawrence retained control of the new Lawrenceville Cement Company, but after three years he was ousted and William Beach took over. He expanded the production facilities, in time for the rise in demand that occurred as the [[Gilded Age]] saw a rapid increase in demand after the lull caused by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. He died in 1881, and control passed to his son William N. Beach II shortly thereafter.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The younger Beach began taking advantage of the recently-constructed [[Wallkill Valley Railroad]] and its connections to the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central]] network as a way to get product to market, building a siding to the plant. In keeping with a general national trend, this began a shift away from the canal that had spawned the cement works, and within two decades the canal would carry its last loads.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

===20th century===

As the century ended, the natural-cement industry dominated the market. The Snyder family was proud that their cement had been used in the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], an icon of the era. Beach built another new plant in the northeast corner of the property to handle demand. But the development of the cheaper [[Portland cement]] during that time period eventually toppled the Rosendale variety, whose [[market share]] dropped 90% in the first decade of the 20th century. Local industrial magnate Samuel Coykendall eventually tried to salvage the Rosendale industry through mergers, combining all the local companies save the ones on the Snyder property into one. The Consolidated Rosendale Cement Company was no more successful than any of its component companies had been, and was in [[receivership]] by 1918.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

In 1911 an [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] court had forced the sale of the Snyder company from William Snyder to 21-year-old Andrew J. Snyder II after a disagreement over the sharing of [[profit]]s. The younger Snyder dismantled one of the larger plants and built a smaller one in its place. He was able to continue production on a reduced scale through the 1920s, and later in that decade attracted the interest of an investor from [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] named Kling, who leased a portion of the property from Snyder and started the Interstate Cement Company.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The [[Great Depression]] soon put an end to that venture, and by 1935 it had become the Century Cement Manufacturing Co., wholly owned by Snyder. He was able to keep the company going through the later 1930s when he allowed [[Fungiculture|mushroom growers]] to set up shop in the abandoned Beach Mine. Eventually that would produce five tons (4.5 tonnes) per day before it stopped in 1960.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

At the same time he also took advantage of a discovery that Portland cement could be made even more quickly and last longer when combined with natural cement in an 80-20 [[ratio]]. This blend was particularly suited to [[highway]]s, then being built at a great pace everywhere due to the combination of [[New Deal]] [[public works]] projects and increasing [[motorization|automobile use]]. By the start of [[World War II]] production was again on the increase.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

It fell during the war years, but rebounded afterwards to even higher levels as highway construction picked up again with the development of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. In 1954 Rosendale cement was used for the nearby sections of the [[New York State Thruway]]. However, it would be the last major public project in which it was used.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

Snyder had been exploring the possibilities of making Portland cement as well. [[geology|Geologists]] found that there were significant reserves in the Hudson Valley of the type of [[limestone]] needed, so in 1958 the copmpany bought a plant from the [[List of Swiss companies|Swiss company]] Van Roll. Three years later it was built next to the existing facilities and began turning out cement. Around the same time, [[chemistry|chemists]] developed an [[additive]] to Portland cement which eliminated the need for the Rosendale mix, and cut costs even further.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

Snyder and the company's technical team tried to keep up with the changes, but they were as old as he was and had trouble getting the formula right. The market for the natural cement the property still produced was almost negligible, and in 1970 Snyder finally halted production almost a century and a half after Rosendale cement had first been discovered on the bed of the long-abandoned canal. He himself died five years later<ref name="NRHP nom" />

==Preservation==

Recognizing its historic importance not just to the region but the country as a whole, two staffers at the American Association for State and Local History prepared an application to have the district designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1978 that was never completed.<ref name="NRHP nom" /> The Century House Historical Society (CHHS) acquired the {{convert|19|acre|ha}} around the eponymous 1809 building where Jacob Lowe Snyder lived at the time of the canal's construction. It was chartered provisionally in 1992 and fully in 2000.<ref name="CHHS timeline">{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.centuryhouse.org/history.html|publisher=Century House Historical Society|date=2005|accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref> It runs the property as a museum devoted to both [[historic house museum|the house]] and the American natural cement industry.<ref name="Traditional Masonry" />

In the plant's last years, one of the few markets it had left was the [[restoration (building)|restoration]] of historic buildings that had originally used it or similar materials. The factory's closure left those builders without any source of authentic material. In 2004 Edison Coatings, Inc., of [[Plainville, Connecticut]], [[trademark]]ed the [[brand]] Rosendale Natural Cement Products and began offering an authentic, historically accurate replacement.<ref name="Edison Coatings">{{cite web|title=History of Rosendale Cement|url=http://www.rosendalecement.net/html/history_of_rosendale_cement.html|publisher=Edison Coatings, Inc.|work=rosendalecement.net|accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref>

==Significant contributing properties==

Several of the many contributing resources to the district are notable in their own right. None have yet been separately listed on the Register, save the sections of canal bed, a National Historic Landmark:

* '''Century House'''. Jacob Lowe Snyder's 1809 frame house, renovated in the 1940s, is the core of the CHHS property and the oldest building in the district.<ref name="NRHP nom" />
* '''Andrew J. Snyder I House''', known also as the '''Ceramic Brick House'''. Originally built in 1887 as a [[Second Empire]]-style mansion complete with [[mansard roof]], in 1950 the windows and roof were converted to a more standard [[gable]] with [[dormer window|dormers]]. It was also refaced in polychrome glazed brick imported from [[Leeds]]. This drastic exterior redesign did not cost the house its historic status as its original [[framing (construction)|framing]] and interior layout remain intact.<ref name="NRHP nom" />
* '''Canal infrastructure'''. In addition to the canal bed, other aspects of the canal remain within the district. There is a waste [[weir]] next to it, and just west of Binnewater Road is a [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] that was used to keep the canal full during dry stretches. The [[slipway|slip]] that the company built for Snyder is also intact, and is possibly the only remaining slip from the original construction along the entire length of the former canal.<ref name="NRHP nom" />
* '''Widow Jane Mine'''. The oldest cement mine, a [[Drift mining|drift]] into one of the hillsides. The largest of the mines, it has been likened to an underground pillared room.<ref name="NRHP nom" /> It is currently mostly flooded with [[groundwater]], but that has not stopped musicians from recording in it to take advantage of the [[acoustics]].<ref name="Traditional Masonry" />
