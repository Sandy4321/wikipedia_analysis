'''''The Hunger Games''''' is a 2008 [[young adult literature|young adult]] novel by American writer [[Suzanne Collins]]. It is written [[First-person narrative|in the voice of]] 16-year-old [[Katniss Everdeen]], who lives in the [[pre-apocalyptic]] nation of [[The Hunger Games universe#Panem|Panem]], where the countries of North America once existed. [[The Hunger Games universe#The Capitol|The Capitol]], a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation. The Hunger Games are an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged&nbsp;12<U+2013>18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death.

The book received mostly positive feedback from major reviewers and authors, including author [[Stephen King]]. It was praised for its storyline and character development, though some reviewers have noted similarities between Collins' book and the Japanese novel ''[[Battle Royale]]'' (1999), as well as other works. In writing ''The Hunger Games'', Collins drew upon [[Greek mythology]] and contemporary [[reality television]] for thematic content. The novel won many awards, including the [[California Young Reader Medal]], and was named one of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'''s "Best Books of the Year" in 2008.

''The Hunger Games'' was first published in hardcover on September 14, 2008 by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], featuring a cover designed by [[Tim O'Brien (illustrator)|Tim O'Brien]]. It has since been released in paperback and also as an [[audiobook]] and [[ebook]]. After an initial print of 200,000, the book had sold 800,000 copies by February 2010. Since its release, ''The Hunger Games'' has been translated into 26 languages, and publishing rights have been sold in 38&nbsp;territories. The novel is the first in [[The Hunger Games trilogy|''The Hunger Games'' trilogy]], followed by ''[[Catching Fire]]'' (2009) and ''[[Mockingjay]]'' (2010). A [[The Hunger Games (film)|film adaptation]], directed by [[Gary Ross]] and co-written and co-produced by Collins herself, was released in 2012.

==Background==
Collins has said that the inspiration for ''The Hunger Games'' came from [[channel surfing]] on television. On one channel she observed people competing on a [[Reality television|reality show]] and on another she saw footage of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. The two "began to blur in this very unsettling way" and the idea for the book was formed.<ref name="Dark Horse">{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20080609/9915-a-dark-horse-breaks-out.html|title=A dark horse breaks out: the buzz is on for Suzanne Collins's YA series debut.|last=Sellers|first=John A.|date=June 9, 2008|work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> The [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of [[Theseus]] served as a major basis for the story, with Collins describing Katniss as a futuristic Theseus, and Roman [[Gladiator|gladiatorial]] games provided the framework. The sense of loss that Collins developed through her father's service in the [[Vietnam War]] was also an influence on the story, with Katniss having lost her father at age 11, five years before the story begins.<ref name="Margolis">{{cite web|last=Margolis|first=Rick|title=A Killer Story: An Interview with Suzanne Collins, Author of 'The Hunger Games'|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6590063.html|publisher=[[School Library Journal]]|date=September 1, 2008|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}</ref> Collins stated that the deaths of young characters and other "dark passages" were the most difficult parts of the book to write, but that she had accepted that passages such as these were necessary to the story.<ref name="difficult">{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/thehungergames/videos/the-most-difficult-part.htm|title=The Most Difficult Part|format=Video|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=February 25, 2012}}</ref> She considered the moments where Katniss reflects on happier moments in her past to be more enjoyable.<ref name="difficult" />

==Plot==
{{See also|The Hunger Games universe}}
''The Hunger Games'' takes place in a nation known as [[The Hunger Games universe#Panem|Panem]], established in North America after the destruction of the continent's civilization by an unknown apocalyptic event. The nation consists of the wealthy Capitol and twelve surrounding, poorer districts united under the Capitol's control. [[The Hunger Games universe#District 12|District&nbsp;12]], where the book begins, is located in the coal-rich region that was formerly known as [[Appalachia]].<ref name="Collins, Suzanne 2008 p. 41">{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Suzanne|year=2008|title=The Hunger Games|publisher=Scholastic|page=41|isbn=0-439-02348-3}}</ref>

As punishment for a previous rebellion against the Capitol, in which a 13th district was destroyed, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12&nbsp;and 18&nbsp;from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, an event in which the participants (or "tributes") must fight to the death in an outdoor arena controlled by the Capitol, until only one individual remains. The story is narrated by 16-year-old [[Katniss Everdeen]], a girl from District&nbsp;12 who volunteers for the 74th annual Hunger Games in place of her younger sister, [[Primrose Everdeen|Primrose]]. The male tribute chosen from District&nbsp;12 is [[Peeta Mellark]], a former schoolmate of Katniss who once gave her bread from his family's bakery when her family was starving.

Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, where their drunken mentor, [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Haymitch Abernathy|Haymitch Abernathy]], victor of the 50th Hunger Games, instructs them to watch and determine the strengths and weaknesses of the other tributes. "Stylists" are employed to make each tribute look his or her best; Katniss's stylist, Cinna, is the only person at the Capitol with whom she feels a degree of understanding.  The tributes are publicly displayed to the Capitol audience in an interview with television host Caesar Flickerman, and have to attempt to appeal to the television audience in order to obtain "sponsors". During this time, Peeta reveals on-air his longtime unrequited love for Katniss. Katniss believes this to be a ploy to gain sponsors, who can be critical to survival because of their ability to send gifts such as food, medicine, and tools to favored tributes during the Games.

While nearly half the tributes are killed in the first day of the Games, Katniss relies on her well-practiced hunting and survival skills to remain unharmed and concealed from the other tributes. A few days into the games, Katniss develops an alliance with Rue, a 12-year-old girl from the agricultural District&nbsp;11 who reminds Katniss of her own sister. In the meantime, Peeta appears to have joined forces with the tributes from the richer districts.  However, when he has the opportunity to kill Katniss, he instead saves her from the others.  Katniss's alliance with Rue is brought to an abrupt end when Rue is killed by another tribute, whom Katniss then kills with an arrow. Katniss sings to Rue until she dies, and spreads flowers over her body as a sign of respect for Rue and disgust towards the Capitol.

Apparently because of Katniss and Peeta's image in the minds of the audience as "[[Star-crossed|star-crossed lovers]]", a rule change is announced midway through the Games, allowing two tributes from the same district to win the Hunger Games as a couple. Upon hearing this, Katniss begins searching for Peeta. She eventually finds him, wounded and in hiding. As she nurses him back to health, she acts the part of a young girl falling in love to gain more favor with the audience and, consequently, gifts from her sponsors. When the couple remain as the last two surviving tributes, the Gamemakers reverse the rule change in an attempt to force them into a dramatic finale, where one must kill the other to win. Katniss, knowing that the Gamemakers would rather have two victors than none, retrieves highly poisonous berries known as "nightlock" from her pouch and offers some to Peeta. Realizing that Katniss and Peeta intend to commit suicide, the Gamemakers announce that both will be the victors of the 74th Hunger Games.

Although she survives the ordeal in the arena and is treated to a hero's welcome in the Capitol, Katniss is warned by Haymitch that she has now become a political target after defying her society's authoritarian leaders so publicly. Afterwards, Peeta is heartbroken when he learns that Katniss's actions in the arena were part of a calculated ploy to earn sympathy from the audience. However, Katniss is unsure of her own feelings and realizes that she is dreading the moment when she and Peeta will go their separate ways.

In an interview with Collins, it was noted that the novel "tackles issues like severe poverty, starvation, oppression, and the effects of war among others."<ref name="Powell">{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio?show=HARDCOVER:SALE:9780439023511:12.59&page=authorqa|title=Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3)|publisher=Powell's Books|accessdate=February 25, 2012}}</ref> The novel deals with the struggle for self-preservation that the people of Panem face in their districts and the Hunger Games in which they must participate.<ref name="Dark Horse" /> The citizens' starvation and their need for resources, both in and outside of the arena, create an atmosphere of helplessness that the main characters try to overcome in their fight for survival.

"You don<U+2019>t demoralize and dehumanize a subject people by turning them into celebrities and coaching them on how to craft an appealing persona for a mass audience."

Donald Brake from ''[[The Washington Times]]'' and pastor Andy Langford state that the story has Christian themes, such as that of [[self-sacrifice]], which is found in Katniss' substitution for her younger sister, analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus as a [[Substitutionary atonement|substitute]] for the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement of sins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/worlds-best-selling-book/2012/mar/31/religious-and-political-overtones-hunger-games/|title=The religious and political overtones of Hunger Games|last=Brake|first=Donald|date=March 31, 2012|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.independenttribune.com/lifestyles/2012/mar/21/pastors-find-religious-themes-hunger-games-ar-2071082/|title=Pastors find religious themes in 'Hunger Games'|last=Groover|first=Jessica|date=March 21, 2012|work=[[Independent Tribune]]|accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> Brake, as well as another reviewer, Amy Simpson, both find that the story also revolves around the theme of [[hope]], which is exemplified in the "incorruptible goodness of Katniss' sister, Primrose."<ref name=Simpson>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/marchweb-only/hungergamesa.html|title=Jesus in 'The Hunger Games'|last=Simpson|first=Amy|date=March 22, 2012|work=[[Christianity Today]]|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}</ref> Simpson also points to events similar to the [[Passion of Jesus]]; in the Games, "Christ figure" Peeta Mellark is stabbed after warning Katniss to flee for her life, and is then buried in the ground and placed in a cave for three days before emerging with a new lease on life.<ref name="Simpson" /> Further, she finds that the Christian image of the [[Bread of Life]] is used throughout ''The Hunger Games''; in the story, Peeta gives Katniss a loaf of bread, saving the girl and her family from starvation.<ref name="Simpson" />

==Critical reception==
''The Hunger Games'' has been well received by critics. In a review for ''The New York Times'', [[John Green (author)|John Green]] wrote that the novel was "brilliantly plotted and perfectly paced", and that "the considerable strength of the novel comes in Collins's convincingly detailed world-building and her memorably complex and fascinating heroine." However, he also noted that sometimes the book does not realize the [[Allegory|allegorical]] potential that the plot has to offer and that the writing "described the action and little else."<ref name="NYT">{{cite news | first=John |last=Green | title=Scary New World | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/books/review/Green-t.html | newspaper=The New York Times | date=November 7, 2008 | accessdate=December 29, 2008 }}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's review was also positive, stating that it "is a chilling, bloody and thoroughly horrifying book" and praising what it called the "hypnotic" quality of the violence.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lev|last=Grossman|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1919156-2,00.html|title=Review: The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins|work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 7, 2009|accessdate=December 7, 2010}}</ref> In [[Stephen King]]'s review for ''Entertainment Weekly'', he compared it to "shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames in the lobby of the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep plugging in quarters anyway."

The novel has been criticized for its similarities to the 1999&nbsp;novel ''[[Battle Royale]]'', by [[Koushun Takami]]. Collins has stated, "I had never heard of that book or that author until my book was turned in. At that point, it was mentioned to me, and I asked my editor if I should read it. He said: 'No, I don't want that world in your head. Just continue with what you're doing.'
