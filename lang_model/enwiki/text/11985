'''Krinitis''' or '''Krenites Arotras''' ({{lang-el|<U+039A><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BD><U+03AF><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2> or <U+039A><U+03C1><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03AF><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2> <U+1F08><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+1FB6><U+03C2>}}) was a [[Byzantine]] aristocrat and military governor in southern [[Greece]]. He is most notable for suppressing a [[Sclaveni|Slavic]] revolt in the [[Peloponnese]] in 921/22.

==Origin and appointment to the Peloponnese==
Arotras was a scion of the [[Krenites]] family, an aristocratic clan of [[Armenians|Armenian]] origin present in Byzantium since the early 9th century.{{sfn|Charanis|1963|p=41}} In early 921 or 922 (earlier scholars dated this to ca. 935), when he held the rank of ''[[protospatharios]]'' was appointed as military governor (''[[strategos]]'') of the [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of the [[Peloponnese (theme)|Peloponnese]], and tasked with suppressing the revolt of the Slavic tribes of the [[Melingoi]] and [[Ezeritai]].{{sfn|Herrin|2013|p=16}}{{sfn|Curta|2011|p=171}}{{sfn|Runciman|1988|p=73}}

The two tribes had rebelled in the past, in 840<U+2013>42, and after their submission had been obliged to pay an annual tribute of 60 and 300 gold ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]'' respectively.{{sfn|Herrin|2013|p=16}} In ca. 920, they began to disobey the commands of the then ''strategos'', John Proteuon, refusing to accept the rulers ("[[archon]]s") he chose for them and to be conscripted for overseas service in southern Italy against an ongoing [[Lombards|Lombard]] rebellion.{{sfn|Herrin|2013|p=16}}{{sfn|Curta|2011|p=171}} According to the account of Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos]] (r. 913<U+2013>959) in his ''[[De administrando imperio]]'', Arotras began his campaign against them in March, burning and plundering their lands around [[Mount Taygetos]] until November. The two tribes submitted again, and were condemned to pay an increased tribute of 600 ''solidi''. Arotras was transferred (late 922 or early 923) to the neighbouring theme of [[Hellas (theme)|Hellas]], and was replaced by Bardas Platypodes.{{sfn|Herrin|2013|p=16}}{{sfn|Curta|2011|pp=171<U+2013>172}} Under Platypodes, strife in the Peloponnese resumed as he quarrelled with the local nobility, while another revolt by Slavic troops in the Peloponnese followed soon after, which the Melingoi and Ezeritai exploited in getting their tribute reduced to the previous amounts.{{sfn|Herrin|2013|p=16}}{{sfn|Curta|2011|p=172}}{{sfn|Runciman|1988|pp=73<U+2013>74}}

==Possible identifications==
Two 10th-century seals mentioning the "imperial ''[[protospatharios]]'' and ''strategos'' of the Peloponnese Krenites" are known and probably belong to him.{{sfn|Nesbitt|Oikonomides|1994|p=72}} He has also been identified by some with a person of the same name, mentioned in the hagiography of [[Luke of Steiris|Saint Luke of Steiris]]. This Krenites served as ''strategos'' of Hellas from ca. 945 until 952/955, before going on to serve as ''strategos'' of the Peloponnese. Most scholars, however, believe the two to be separate persons.{{sfn|Nesbitt|Oikonomides|1994|p=72}}{{sfn|Perra|2011}} Some scholars, like Runciman, also equated him with another Krenites, who was used by Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] (r. 920<U+2013>944) in diplomatic missions to the [[Medieval Armenia|Armenian princes]].{{sfn|Charanis|1963|p=41}}{{sfn|Runciman|1988|p=73}}
