'''Dr. Jennifer Keller''' is a [[fictional character]] from the Canadian-American [[military science fiction]] series ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series to ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. She is played by Canadian actress [[Jewel Staite]], who previously played the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] Ellia in [[Stargate Atlantis (season 2)|season two]] episode "[[Instinct (Stargate Atlantis)|Instinct]]". She was created by the producers, who wanted someone to fill in for [[Carson Beckett]] after [[Paul McGillion]]'s departure from regular status in the series. Keller had a recurring role in the [[Stargate Atlantis (season 4)|fourth season]], and was later promoted to a regular in [[Stargate Atlantis (season 5)|Season 5]].<ref name="reg_blog">[http://josephmallozzi.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/february-5-2008-extra-extra-read-all-about-it/ Blog] of [[Joseph Mallozzi]], ''Stargate Atlantis'' producer (February 5, 2008).

Dr. Keller was introduced in the third season finale, "[[First Strike (Stargate Atlantis)|First Strike]]". She is a brilliant young doctor and becomes a member of the Atlantis Expedition, and has taken charge as Atlantis' Chief Medical Officer, after the death of Dr. [[Carson Beckett]]. At first, she appears as a non-assertive character, but has proven to be courageous over time. Towards the end of the fifth season, she starts a relationship with fellow expedition member [[Rodney McKay]]. In 2008, Staite was nominated for a [[Gemini Award]] in "Best Performance by an Actress in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role" for her role as Keller, and in 2009, she was also nominated for a [[Leo Award]] in "Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series."

When she gets back to Atlantis, she is the one who discovers that Teyla is pregnant.<ref name="missing"/> After finding the clone of Beckett, she realises that Michael made an injection to keep his cells from deteriorating.

==Conceptual history==
[[File:Jewel Statie @ the Serenity Flanvention.jpg|thumb|Jewel Staite in the 2005 Serenity convention.]]
[[Jewel Staite]], who plays Dr. Keller, previously played [[Wraith characters in Stargate#Ellia|Ellia]] in the ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' episode "[[Instinct (Stargate Atlantis)|Instinct]]". Staite was well-known among sci-fi fans for playing [[Kaylee Frye]] in the cult series ''[[Firefly (television series)|Firefly]]'', and is the third regular ''Firefly'' actor to go on to appear in the [[Stargate|Stargate franchise]]. The others were [[Adam Baldwin]] ([[Jayne Cobb]] in ''Firefly'') who played Colonel Dave Dixon, and [[Morena Baccarin]] ([[Inara Serra]] in ''Firefly'') who played [[Adria (Stargate)|Adria]].

Executive producer [[Martin Gero]] created the character of Jennifer Keller while writing "[[First Strike (Stargate Atlantis)|First Strike]]". The producers decided to cast [[Jewel Staite]] for the role as Keller after they enjoyed working with her previously as Ellia in "Instinct". After [[Paul McGillion]] departed from the series as [[Carson Beckett]], Gero wanted Keller not to replace Beckett, but rather fill in for him. Gero also wanted to make Keller's situation endearing if she was uncomfortable in her new position, and didn't want it in the first place. She was also originally created to be a [[Canada|Canadian]] character, and while fiming the episode, she held a [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag patch]]. However, because [[Paul Mullie]] thought there were already enough Canadian characters in the series (which include [[Rodney McKay]] and [[Chuck (Stargate)|Chuck]]), she was turned into an American instead, after filming was completed, so the visual effects team wiped away the Canadian flag and replaced it with a CGI flag of the US.<ref name="ac_320_mg">{{cite video |people=[[Martin Gero|Gero, Martin]] |date=2007 |title=Audio Commentary for "First Strike" |medium=DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

She was given a recurring status for the [[Stargate Atlantis (season 4)|fourth season]], though the number of episodes she would appear in varied. In October 2006, it was revealed that she would appear in 13 to 15 episodes.<ref name="gateworld061030">{{cite news |url=http://gateworld.net/news/2006/10/jewel_staite_returning_to_iatlan.shtml |title=Jewel Staite returning to Atlantis |work=Gateworld.net |first=Darren |last=Sumner |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2006-10-30}}</ref> However, by February 2007, it was revealed she would appear in eight episodes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2007/02/amanda_tapping_.html |title=Amanda Tapping joins 'Stargate Atlantis' |first=Maureen |last=Ryan |date=February 20, 2007 |accessdate=April 23, 2009 |publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> By the time the season aired, she appeared in eleven episodes in total. She was promoted to a regular for the fifth season.<ref name="reg_blog"/> Reportedly, Staite was eager for her new role as a regular. One of her first roles for the fifth season was "[[The Seed (Stargate Atlantis)|The Seed]]", where Staite had to be up at 4:00am for an extensive three to four hours with [[Prosthesis#Prosthetic enhancement|prosthetics]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Mallozzi |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Mallozzi |url=http://josephmallozzi.wordpress.com/2008/02/11/february-11-2008-script-work-the-doctor-drops-in-and-that-deleted-conversation/ |title=February 11, 2008: Script work, the doctor drops in, and that deleted conversation. |publisher=[[Joseph Mallozzi]]'s Weblog |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref>

==Reception==
For her role as Dr. Keller in the episode "[[Missing (Stargate Atlantis)|Missing]]", Staite was nominated for "Best Performance by an Actress in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role" for the 23rd annual [[Gemini Awards]], 2008.
