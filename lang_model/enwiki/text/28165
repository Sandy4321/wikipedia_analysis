==Profile==
His real name is Leonard Michaels, and his rank is that of corporal E-4. Scoop was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].

Scoop's primary military specialty is [[journalist]], and his secondary military specialty is [[microwave transmission]] specialist. He has an advanced degree in journalism, as well as a masters degree in [[electrical engineering]]. Scoop could have worked for a network news team, but instead opted for service on the G.I.

===Marvel Comics===
In the Marvel comics G.I. Joe series, he first appeared in ''G.I. Joe Special Missions'' #23. He is one of a team sent to [[List of fictional places in G.I. Joe|Sierra Gordo]]. Conflict arises because Scoop, while a trained soldier, barely meets G.I. Joe standards. It is shown how he interacts badly with his teammates [[Muskrat (G.I. Joe)|Muskrat]], [[Leatherneck (G.I. Joe)|Leatherneck]], [[Hit & Run (G.I. Joe)|Hit and Run]], [[Tunnel Rat (G.I. Joe)|Tunnel Rat]] and [[Stalker (G.I. Joe)|Stalker]]. Scoop defeats an [[Iron Grenadiers|Iron Grenadier]] in hand to hand combat, smashing the man in the head with the treasured video footage. This also saves the life of Tunnel Rat, who had been wounded. All the Joes then escape. Scoop earns the respect of the other Joe soldiers.<ref>''G.I. Joe Special Missions'' #23 (Nov. 1989)</ref>
