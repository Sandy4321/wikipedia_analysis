On the 15 January 1953 ''[[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|VX562]]'' a twin-engined [[Vickers Valetta]] transport aircraft of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) collided over the Mediterranean Sea with a four-engined RAF [[Avro Lancaster]] [[maritime patrol]] aircraft. A total of 26 people were killed.<ref name="ASN" />

==Accident==
The Valetta had departed [[RAF Luqa]] with 16 passengers (15 airmen and one [[Royal Navy]] (RN) sailor) on a return flight to the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="Times" /> When just before 05:00 the Valleta was between [[Pantellaria]] and [[Sicily]] it collided in poor visibility and heavy rain with the [[Avro Lancaster]]. <ref name="Times" />

The Lancaster from [[No. 38 Squadron RAF]] was following [[HMS Gambia (48)|HMS ''Gambia'']] and other RN ships on an anti-submarine excercise.<ref name="Times" />  The seven crew on the Lancaster and all on onboard the Valetta where killed. <ref name="Times" />

==Rescue and aftermath==
The ''Gambia'' and other ships searched the scene for survivors but only wreckage was found. Later the destroyer [[HMS Chieftain|HMS ''Chieftain'']] searched east of Pantellaria when a note case belonging to one of the Lancaster crew was found, without success.<ref name="Times" />

==Investigation==
The court of inquiry decided that the weather conditions at the time were a factor with localized [[thunderstorm]]s, heavy rain and [[hail]] and no blame could be attached to any individual. Evidence did reveal that though the Malta Flight Information Centre were not in possession of full information on the Lancaster's sortie, it was not a contributory cause.<ref name="planecrash" />
