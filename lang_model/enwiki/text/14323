'''''Kuehneromyces mutabilis''''' (synonyms: '''''Pholiota mutabilis''''') is an edible fungus which grows in clumps on  tree stumps or other dead wood.  A few other species have been described in the genus  '''''Kuehneromyces''''', but ''K. mutabilis'' is by far the commonest and best known.

==Description==
*The clustered shiny convex caps  are 6-8cm in diameter.  They are very [[hygrophanous]]; in a damp state they are shiny and greasy  with a deep orange-brown colour towards the rim; often there is a disc of lighter (less sodden) flesh in the middle.  In a dry state they are cinnamon-coloured.
*The gills are initially light and later cinnamon brown, and are sometimes somewhat decurrent (running down the stem).
*The stipe is 8-10cm long by about 0.5-1cm in diameter with a ring which separates the bare, smooth light cinnamon upper part from the darker brown shaggily scaly lower part.  This type of stem is sometimes described as "booted".
*This species always grows on wood, generally on stumps of broad-leaved trees (especially beech, birch and alder), and rarely on conifers.
*It is found from April to late October, and also in the remaining winter months where conditions are mild.  It is often seen at times when there are few other fungi in evidence.

==Edibility and possibility of confusion==

The caps of this mushroom can be fried or used for flavouring in sauces and soups (the stems being considered too tough to eat).

''K. mutabilis'' cannot be recommended as an edible mushroom as there is a real possibility that it could be confused with the deadly poisonous ''Galerina marginata'', even by people who are quite knowledgeable.  Although a typical ''K. mutabilis'' is easily distinguished from a typical ''G. marginata'' by the "booted" stipe which is shaggy below the ring (see photos), this character is not reliable and ''G. marginata'' can also have scales.  The main differences are:
[[Image:Galerina marginata 051106Bw.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''Galerina marginata'' (poisonous)]]
[[Image:Kuehneromyces mutabilis 031111Bw.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''Kuehneromyces mutabilis'']]
*while they are both hygrophanous, ''K. mutabilis'' dries from the centre outwards (so having  a lighter colour in the centre) and ''G. marginata'' dries from the edge inwards,
*the stem below the ring is scaly below the ring in ''K. mutabilis'', but normally fibrously silky in ''G. marginata'', 
*''K. mutabilis'' has a  pleasant mushroom smell and mild taste, whereas ''G. marginata'' tastes and smells mealy.
