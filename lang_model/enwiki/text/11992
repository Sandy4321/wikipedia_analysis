'''Phil Harvey''' is an American [[entrepreneur]], [[philanthropist]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] who over the past 42 years has set up large-scale programs that deliver subsidized [[contraceptives]] in poor countries. Harvey is the founder and president of [[DKT International]], the [[Washington, D.C.]]-based charity that implements [[family planning]] and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] prevention programs in 18 countries across [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]]. He is the chief sponsor of the Liberty Project which raises awareness about [[freedom of speech]] issues in the U.S. Harvey is also the president of [[Adam & Eve (business)|Adam & Eve]], the [[North Carolina]]<U+2013>based company that sells [[sex toys]], [[adult films]] and [[condoms]]. Consequently he has been called "one of the most influential figures in the American [[sex industry]] today".<ref name=Reefer>{{cite book|title=Reefer madness: sex, drugs, and cheap labor in the American black market|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|author=Eric Schlosser|year=2004|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=s4FeZmuBAqsC|isbn=0-618-44670-2|page=}}</ref>

Over these years, Harvey has used profits from Adam & Eve to supplement support from international donors to protect millions of poor couples from [[unwanted pregnancies]] and [[HIV]] infections. During 2011, [[DKT International]] provided 24.5 million couple years of protection (CYPs).<ref>http://www.dktinternational.org</ref>

==Biography==
Harvey was born in [[Evanston, Illinois]] to William Dow Harvey and Lucy Smith Harvey as the youngest of five siblings on April 25, 1938. He attended [[Harvard College]] from 1957 and received his bachelor<U+2019>s degree in 1961 in [[Slavic languages]] and literature. Between 1960 and 1962, he did his military service based in [[Ft. Meade]], Maryland, before joining the international charity [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] in 1963 to work in [[India]]. His five years<U+2019> work with CARE on large-scale feeding programs for rapidly growing numbers of Indian children convinced Harvey of the importance of [[family planning]] and planted the first seeds in his mind of starting an initiative that could address the issue on a global scale.

Harvey returned to the U.S. in 1969 and enrolled in the [[University of North Carolina]]<U+2019>s masters degree program in family planning administration. One of his classmates was Tim Black, a British physician (who went on to found [[Marie Stopes]] [[Marie Stopes International|International]], a large [[United Kingdom|British]] charity also focused on family planning services). Harvey and Black founded Population Services International in 1970 which today works in almost 60 countries with an annual budget of $586 million (2010). Harvey remained the executive director of PSI from 1970 to 1977 and remained on the PSI Board until 2003.

He co-founded Adam & Eve in 1972 and continues to remain its president. He founded [[DKT International]] in 1989 and has been its president / chief executive since.

==Business and non-profit enterprises==
Harvey<U+2019>s operational philosophy is unique: it combines [[altruism]] with strong business models. Adam & Eve is one of the largest sex product companies in the world. Harvey<U+2019>s share of profits from it support [[DKT International]] which sells low-priced [[contraceptives]] by using business channels that are found in every corner of the world, including in low-resource settings. Special projects, such as those with the military in [[Ethiopia]] (which obliges all soldiers to carry condoms when they leave the base) or with local medical practitioners in India who make a small profit selling condoms, extend and supplement this approach and ensure the products are widely available.

===History===
Harvey realized the potential of [[mail order]] when, at the University of North Carolina, he joined forces with Tim Black to begin selling condoms through the mail. Their efforts to expand the range of products led to the evolution of the sex products business: in Harvey's own words, "(w)e tried to get our customers to buy leisure wear, shipbuilding kits, belt buckles, model airplanes, but they just yawned at that stuff. Every time we put something with erotic appeal in the catalog, the bells would ring."<ref>http://www.alternet.org/story/13650</ref>

Profit from their mail-order business provided the funds to launch [[Population Services International]] and [[DKT International]], the latter named for the late [[Deep Tyagi|D.K. Tyagi]], an early pioneer of family planning in India.<ref>http://www.motherjones.com/commentary/notebook/2002/11/ma_158_01.html</ref>
