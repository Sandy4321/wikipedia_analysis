}}
The '''loggerhead sea turtle''' (''Caretta caretta''), or loggerhead, is an oceanic [[turtle]] distributed throughout the world. It is a marine reptile, belonging to the family Cheloniidae. The loggerhead is the world's largest hard-shelled turtle, measuring up to {{convert|213|cm|in|sp=us}} long when fully grown. The adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs approximately {{convert|135|kg|lb}}. The skin ranges from yellow to brown in color, and the shell is typically reddish-brown. There are no external differences in gender until the turtle becomes an adult. The most obvious difference being, adult males have thicker tails and shorter [[plastron]]s than the females. 

The loggerhead sea turtle is found in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] oceans as well as the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It spends most of its life in saltwater and [[estuarine]] habitats, with females briefly coming ashore to lay eggs. The loggerhead sea turtle has a low reproductive rate; females lay an average of four egg [[clutch (eggs)|clutches]] and then become [[wiktionary:quiescence|quiescent]], producing no eggs for two to three years. The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17<U+2013>33 years and has a lifespan of 47<U+2013>67 years.

The loggerhead sea turtle is [[omnivore|omnivorous]], feeding mainly on bottom dwelling [[invertebrate]]s. Its large and powerful jaws serve as an effective tool in dismantling its prey. Young loggerheads are exploited by numerous predators; the eggs are especially vulnerable to terrestrial organisms. Once the turtles reach adulthood, their formidable size limits predation to large marine organisms such as sharks.

Loggerheads are considered an [[endangered species]] and are protected by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]]. Untended fishing gear is responsible for many loggerhead deaths. Turtles also suffocate when they are accidentally trapped in [[Trawling|fishing trawls]]. [[Turtle excluder device]]s (TEDs) have been implemented in efforts to reduce mortality by providing the turtle an escape route. Loss of suitable nesting beaches and the introduction of exotic predators has also taken a toll on loggerhead populations. Efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered among several countries.

==Taxonomy==
[[Carolus Linnaeus]] gave the loggerhead its first binomial name, ''Testudo caretta'', in 1758.<ref name="dodd1"/><ref name="seaturtlebook7"/> Thirty-five other names emerged over the following two centuries, with the combination ''Caretta caretta'' first introduced in 1902 by Leonhard Stejneger.<ref name="dodd2"/> The English [[common name]] "loggerhead" refers to the animal's large head.<ref name="noaa"/><ref name="dodd4"/> The Loggerhead sea turtle belongs to the [[Family (biology)|family]] Cheloniidae, which includes all sea turtles except the [[leatherback sea turtle]].<ref name="turtleguide97"/> The subspecific classification of the loggerhead sea turtle is debated, but most authors consider the loggerhead a single [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] species.<ref name="marquez14"/> Molecular genetics has confirmed hybridization of the Loggerhead sea turtle with the [[Kemp's Ridley]], [[Hawksbill turtle]], and [[Green turtle]]. The extent of natural hybridization is not yet determined; however, second generation hybrids have been reported, suggesting that some hybrids are fertile.<ref name="hybrid581"/>

==Habitat==
Loggerhead sea turtles spend most of their life in the open ocean and in shallow coastal waters. They rarely come ashore, with the exception of the females' brief visits to construct nests and deposit eggs. Hatchling loggerhead turtles live in floating mats of ''[[Sargassum]]'' algae.<ref name="spotila172"/> Adults and juveniles live along the continental shelf as well as in shallow coastal estuaries.<ref name="spotila174"/> In the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, age plays a factor in habitat preference. Juveniles are more frequently found in shallow estuarine habitats with limited ocean access compared to non-nesting adults.<ref name="seaturtlebook11"/> Loggerheads occupy waters with surface temperature ranging from {{convert|13.3|<U+2013>|28|C|F}} during non-nesting season. Temperatures from {{convert|27|<U+2013>|28|C|F}} are most suitable for nesting females.<ref name="ernst39"/>

Juvenile loggerheads share the ''Sargassum'' habitat with a variety of other organisms. The mats of ''Sargassum'' contain as many as 100 different species of animals that the juveniles feed on. Some of the prey, such as [[ant]]s, [[fly|flies]], [[aphid]]s, [[leafhopper]]s, and [[beetle]]s are carried by the wind to these areas. [[Endemism|Endemic]] prey of the ''Sargassum'' mats include [[barnacle]]s, small [[crab]] larvae, [[fish eggs]], and [[hydrozoa]]n colonies.<ref name="spotila172"/> Marine mammals and commercial fish such as [[tuna]], [[dolphin fish]], and [[amberjack]]s also inhabit the ''Sargassum'' mats.<ref name="sargassum"/>

===Distribution===
[[File:Loggerhead turtle.png|thumb|center|600px|alt=A map of the range of a loggerhead sea turtle covering the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, and the Mediterranean sea.|Range of the loggerhead sea turtle]]

The loggerhead sea turtle has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], nesting over the broadest geographical range of any sea turtle. The loggerhead inhabits the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea.<ref name="spotila164"/>

In the Atlantic Ocean, the greatest concentration of loggerheads is along the southeastern coast of North America and in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref name="spotila164"/> Very few loggerheads are found along the European and African coastlines.<ref name="spotila165"/> [[Florida]] is the most popular nesting site with over 67,000 nests built per year.<ref name="spotila165"/> Nesting extends as far north as [[Virginia]], as far south as Brazil, and as far east as the [[Cape Verde Islands]].<ref name="spotila165"/> The Cape Verde Islands are the only significant nesting site on the eastern side of the Atlantic. Loggerheads found in the Atlantic Ocean feed from Canada to Brazil.<ref name="spotila164"/>

In the Indian Ocean, loggerheads feed along the coastlines of Africa, the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and in the [[Arabian Sea]].<ref name="spotila166"/> Along the African coastline, loggerheads nest from [[Mozambique]]'s [[Bazaruto Archipelago]] to South Africa's [[iSimangaliso Wetland Park|St Lucia]] estuary.<ref name="seaturtlebook8"/> The largest Indian Ocean nesting site is [[Oman]], on the Arabian Peninsula, which hosts around 15,000 nests, giving it the second largest nesting population of loggerheads in the world. [[Western Australia]] is another notable nesting area, with 1,000<U+2013>2,000 nests per year.<ref name="spotila166"/>

Pacific loggerheads live in [[temperate]] to tropical regions.<ref name="seaturtlebook8"/> They forage in the [[East China Sea]], the southwestern Pacific, and along the [[Baja California peninsula]]. Eastern Australia and [[Japan]] are the major nesting areas. Pacific loggerheads occasionally nest in [[Vanuatu]] and [[Tokelau]]. [[Yakushima Island]] is the most important site with three nesting grounds that 40% of all nearby loggerheads visit.<ref name="spotila166"/> Post-nesting females often find homes in the East China Sea, while the Kuroshio Extension Bifurcation region provides important juvenile foraging areas.<ref name="seaturtlebook8"/> Eastern Pacific populations are concentrated off the coast of Baja California, where upwelling provides rich feeding grounds for juvenile turtles and [[subadult]]s (individuals past the juvenile stage that lack adult characteristics). Nesting sites along the eastern Pacific Basin are rare. mtDNA sequence polymorphism analysis and tracking studies suggest that 95% of the population along the coast of the Americas hatch on the Japanese Islands in the western Pacific.<ref name="Bowen3731"/> The turtles are transported by the prevailing currents across the full length of the northern Pacific, a migration route that is one of the longest of any marine animal.<ref name="Bowen3731"/> The return journey to the natal beaches in Japan has been long suspected, although the trip would cross unproductive clear water with few feeding opportunities.<ref name="Bowen3733"/> Evidence of a return journey came from an adult female loggerhead named Adelita, who in 1996, equipped with a satellite tracking device made the 9,000-mile trip from Mexico across the Pacific. Adelita was the first animal of any kind ever tracked across an ocean basin.<ref name="PBSNature"/>

The Mediterranean is a nursery for juveniles as well as a common place for adults in the spring and summer months.<ref name="spotila165"/><ref name="seaturtlebook20"/> Almost 45% of the Mediterranean juvenile population has migrated from the Atlantic.<ref name="spotila165"/> Loggerheads feed in the [[Alboran Sea]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]].<ref name="spotila165"/>
Greece is the most popular nesting site along the Mediterranean with more than 3,000 nests per year.<ref name="spotila166"/> Because of this, Greek authorities do not allow planes to take off or land at night in [[Zakynthos]] due to the nesting turtles.<ref name="flighttimes"/> In addition to the Greek coast, the coastlines of Cyprus and Turkey are also common nesting sites.<ref name="spotila166"/>

===Evolutionary history===
All modern sea turtles likely descended from a single common ancestor during the Cretaceous Period; however evidence of a specific ancestor is lacking.<ref name="Witherington12"/> Loggerheads, like all other sea turtles excluding the [[leatherback sea turtle]], are members of the ancient [[family (biology)|family]] [[Cheloniidae]]. About 40 million years ago, a branch of the Cheloniidae gave rise to loggerhead sea turtle.<ref name="spotila59"/> Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the [[Kemp's Ridley|Kemp's Ridley sea turtle]], [[olive Ridley]], and the [[hawksbill turtle]] than they are to the [[flatback turtle]] and the [[green turtle]].

Around three million years ago, during the [[Pliocene]] epoch, [[Central America]] emerged from the sea, effectively cutting off currents between the Atlantic and [[Indo-Pacific]] Oceans. The rerouting of ocean currents lead to climatic changes as the Earth entered a glacial cycle. Cold water upwelling around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and reduction in water temperature at [[Cape Horn]] formed cold water barriers to migrating turtles. The result was a complete isolation of the Atlantic and Pacific populations of loggerheads.<ref name="spotila167"/> During the most recent [[ice age]], the beaches of southeastern North America were too cold for sea turtle eggs.  As the Earth began to warm, loggerheads moved farther north, colonizing the northern beaches.  Because of this, turtles nesting between North Carolina and northern Florida represent a different genetic population than those in southern Florida.<ref name="spotila167"/>

The distinct populations of loggerheads have unique characteristics and genetic differences. For example, Mediterranean loggerheads are smaller, on average, than Atlantic Ocean loggerheads.<ref name="spotila166"/> North Atlantic and Mediterranean loggerhead sea turtles are descendants of colonizing loggerheads from [[Tongaland]], South Africa. South African loggerhead genes are still present in these populations today.<ref name="spotila167"/>

==Anatomy and morphology==
[[File:Loggerhead turtle.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photo of the carapace of a loggerhead sea turtle.|The carapace of this loggerhead is reddish-brown; five vertebral scutes run down the turtle's midline bordered by five pairs of costal scutes.]]
The loggerhead sea turtle is the world's largest hard-shelled turtle.<ref name="ernst37"/> Adult loggerheads have an average weight range of {{convert|80|to|200|kg|lb}} and a length range of {{convert|70|to|95|cm|in|sp=us}}.<ref name="ernst37"/> The maximum reported weight is {{convert|545|kg|lb}} and the maximum length is {{convert|213|cm|in|sp=us}}.<ref name="ernst37"/> The head and [[carapace]] (upper shell) range from a yellow-orange to a reddish-brown, while the [[plastron]] (underside) is typically pale yellow.<ref name="turtleguide104"/> The turtle's neck and sides are brown on the tops and yellow on the sides and bottom.<ref name="noaa"/>

The turtle's shell is divided into two sections: carapace and plastron. The carapace is further divided into large plates, or [[scute]]s.<ref name="turtleguide104"/> Typically, there are 11 or 12 pairs of marginal scutes which rim the carapace.<ref name="seaturtlebook7"/> Five vertebral scutes run down the carapace's midline, while five pairs of costal scutes border them.<ref name="turtleguide110"/> The [[:wikt:nuchal|nuchal]] scute is located at the base of the head.<ref name="turtleguide110"/> The carapace connects to the plastron by 3 pairs of inframarginal scutes forming the bridge of the shell.<ref name="turtleguide110"/> The plastron features paired [[gular scute|gular]], humeral, pectoral, abdominal, femoral, and anal scutes.<ref name="seaturtlebook7"/> The shell serves as external armor, although loggerhead sea turtles cannot retract their head or flippers into their shells.<ref name="anatomy"/>

[[Sexual dimorphism]] of the loggerhead sea turtle is only apparent in adults. Adult males have longer tails and claws than females. The males' plastrons are shorter than the females', presumably to accommodate the males' larger tails. The carapace of males are wider and less domed than the females, and males typically have wider heads than females.<ref name="valente22"/> The sex of juveniles and subadults cannot be determined through external anatomy, but can be observed through dissection, [[laparoscopy]] (an operation performed on the abdomen), [[Histology|histological]] examination (cell anatomy), and radioimmunological assays (immune study dealing with [[Isotopic labeling|radiolabeling]]).<ref name="valente22"/>

[[Lachrymal glands]] located behind each eye allow the loggerhead to maintain [[osmotic balance]] by eliminating the excess salt obtained from ingesting ocean water. On land, the excretion of excess salt give the false impression that the turtle is crying.<ref name="peaker231"/>

==Ecology and behavior==

[[File:Loggerhead Sea Turtle (Caretta caretta) 2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A loggerhead sea turtle resting under a rock with its eyes open.|A resting loggerhead sea turtle]]
Loggerhead sea turtles observed in captivity and in the wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, loggerheads spread their forelimbs to about mid-stroke swimming position. They remain motionless with eyes open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. At night, captive loggerheads sleep in the same position with their eyes tightly shut and are slow to react.<ref name="ernst39"/> Loggerheads spend up to 85% of their day submerged, with males being the more active divers than females. The average duration of dives is 15<U+2013>30 minutes, but they can stay submerged for up to four hours.<ref name="ernst44"/> Juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods. Juveniles keep their forelimbs pressed to the side of their carapace and propel themselves by kicking with their hind limbs. As the juveniles mature, their swimming method is progressively replaced with the adults' alternating-limb method. The loggerheads depend entirely on this method of swimming by the time they are one year old.<ref name="ernst43"/>

Water temperature affects the sea turtle's metabolic rate.<ref name="ernst39"/> [[Fatigue (medical)|Lethargy]] is induced at temperatures between {{convert|13|<U+2013>|15|C|F}}. The loggerhead takes on a floating, cold-stunned posture when temperatures drop to approximately {{convert|10|C|F}}.<ref name="ernst39"/> However, younger loggerheads are more resistant to cold and do not become stunned until temperatures drop below {{convert|9|C|F}}. The loggerheads' [[animal migration|migration]] help prevent instances of cold-stunning.<ref name="ernst40"/> Higher water temperatures cause an increase in metabolism and heart rate. A loggerhead's body temperature increases in warmer waters more quickly than it decreases in colder water. The loggerhead sea turtle's [[critical thermal maximum]] is currently unknown.<ref name="ernst40"/>

Female-female [[aggression]], being uncommon (especially in marine [[vertebrates]]), is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps.<ref name="aggression"/> First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, [[sparring]] occurs with turtles snapping at each other<U+2019>s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing one out of the immediate vicinity.<ref name="aggression"/> Escalation is determined by several factors including: [[hormone]] levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds.<ref name="aggression"/> Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.<ref name="ernst44"/>
====Predators====

[[File:Fox up a tree.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A red fox walking along a fallen tree.|The [[red fox]] is a predator of loggerhead nests in Australia.]]
Loggerheads have numerous predators. Egg and nestling predators include [[oligochaete worm]]s, beetles, fly larvae, ants, parasitoid wasp larvae, [[flesh flies]], crabs, snakes, gulls, crows, opposums, bears, rats, armadillos, honey badgers, skunks, [[canids]], [[raccoon]]s, cats, hogs, and humans. During their migration from their nest to the sea, hatchlings are predated by dipteran larvae, crabs, toads, lizards, snakes, birds, and mammals. In the ocean, predators of the loggerhead juveniles and adults include sharks, other fish such as [[parrotfish]], [[moray eel]]s, portunid crabs, gulls, [[monk seal]]s, and [[killer whale]]s. Nesting females are attacked by flesh flies, [[feral]] dogs, and humans. Salt marsh mosquitoes can also pester nesting females.<ref name="ernst52"/><ref name="ernst53"/>

In Australia, the introduction of the red fox (''Vulpes vulpes'') by English settlers in the 19th century lead to significant reductions in loggerhead sea turtle populations. In one coastal section in eastern Australia during the 1970s, predation of turtle eggs destroyed up to 95% of all clutches laid.<ref name="spotila171"/> Aggressive efforts to destroy foxes in the 1980s and 90's has reduced this impact; however, it is estimated that it will be the year 2020 before populations will experience complete recovery from such dramatic losses.<ref name="council62"/>

Along the southeastern coast of the United States, the raccoon (''Procyon lotor'') is the most destructive predator of nesting sites. Mortality rates of nearly 100% of all clutches laid in a season have been recorded on some Florida beaches.<ref name="spotila171"/> This is attributed to an increase in raccoon populations, which have flourished in urban environments. Aggressive efforts to protect nesting sites by covering them with wire mesh has significantly reduced the impact of raccoon predation on loggerhead sea turtle eggs.<ref name="council62"/>

Up to 40% of nesting females around the world have wounds believed to come from shark attacks.<ref name="ernst53"/> Infectious bacteria such as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' attack loggerhead hatchlings and eggs. Fungi such as ''[[Penicillium]]'' infect loggerhead sea turtle nests and cloaca.<ref name="ernst53"/>
{{clear}}

====Disease and parasites====
[[Fibropapillomatosis]] disease threatens loggerheads in the form of the [[Herpesviridae|herpes-type]] virus which causes internal and external [[tumor]]s. These tumors disrupt essential behaviors and, if on the eyes, cause permanent blindness.<ref name="threats"/> [[Trematode]]s of the family [[Spirorchiidae]] inhabit tissues throughout the body of the loggerhead including vital organs such as the heart and the brain.<ref name="trematodes"/> Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, [[inflammation|inflammatory]] trematode [[lesion]]s can cause [[endocarditis]] and [[Neurological disorder|neurological disease]].<ref name="trematodes"/> A [[nematode]], ''[[Angiostoma carettae]]'', also infects loggerheads.<ref name="lungworm"/> The nematodes cause [[histology|histologic]] lesions in the [[respiratory tract]].<ref name="lungworm"/>

More than 100 species of animals from 13 [[Phylum|phyla]] as well as 37 kinds of algae live on loggerheads' backs.<ref name="spotila177"/> These [[parasite|parasitic]] organisms, which increase drag, offer no known benefit to the turtle, although it has been suggested that the dulling effect of organisms on shell color improves [[camouflage|camouflaging]] ability.<ref name="spotila177"/>

===Feeding===
[[File:Moon jelly - adult (rev2).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Translucent moon jelly on black blackground. The jelly contains a solid white mass extending through about 2/3 of its body|An adult [[Aurelia (genus)|Aurelia]] jellyfish which loggerheads eat during migration through the open sea]]

The loggerhead sea turtle is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom dwelling [[invertebrate]]s, such as [[gastropod]]s, [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], and [[Decapoda|decapods]]. The loggerhead has a greater list of known prey than any other sea turtle. Other food items include [[sponge]]s, [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s, [[Polychaete|polychaete worms]], [[sea anemone]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, barnacles, [[brachiopod]]s, [[Isopoda|isopods]], [[insect]]s, [[bryozoa]]ns, [[sea urchin]]s, [[sand dollar]]s, [[sea cucumber]]s, [[starfish]], fish (eggs, juveniles, and adults), [[wrass]]es, hatchling turtles (including members of its own species), algae, and [[vascular plant]]s.<ref name="ernst50"/> During migration through the open sea, loggerheads eat [[jellyfish]], floating mollusks, floating egg clusters, [[squid]], and [[flying fish]].<ref name="noaa"/>

Loggerheads crush prey with their large and powerful jaws.<ref name="noaa"/><ref name="ernst52"/> Projecting scale points on the anterior margin of the forelimbs allow manipulation of the food. These points can be used as "pseudo-claws" to tear large pieces of food in the loggerhead's mouth. The loggerhead will turn its neck sideways to consume the torn food on the scale points.<ref name="ernst52"/> Inward pointing, mucosal ([[mucus]]<U+2013>covered) [[wiktionary:papilla|papillae]] found in the foreregion of the loggerhead's [[esophagus]] filter out foreign bodies, such as fish hooks. The next region of the esophagus is nonpapillated with numerous mucosal folds. The rate of digestion in loggerheads is temperature dependent; digestion rate increases as temperature increases.<ref name="ernst52"/>{{Clear}}

==Life history==
===Early life===
[[File:Babylogger.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt= Loggerhead hatchling crawling through the sand.|A hatchling loggerhead sea turtle on its journey to the ocean]]

Hatchlings range in color from light brown to almost black, lacking the adult's distinct yellows and reds.<ref name="turtleguide104"/> Upon hatching, they measure approximately {{convert|4.6|cm|in|sp=us}} and weigh about {{convert|20|g|oz}}.<ref name="noaa"/> The eggs are typically laid on the beach in an area above the [[strandline|high-tide line]]. The eggs are laid near the water so that hatchlings can return to the sea.<ref name="biologyandconservation10"/> The loggerhead's sex is dictated by the temperature of the underground nest. Incubation temperatures generally range from {{convert|26|<U+2013>|32|C|F}}. Studies show that loggerhead sea turtle eggs that are kept at a constant incubating temperature of {{convert|32|C|F}} become females. Eggs incubating at {{convert|28|C|F}} become males. An incubation temperature of {{convert|30|C|F}} results in an equal ratio of male to female hatchlings.<ref name="yntema1013"/> Hatchlings from eggs in the middle of the clutch tend to be the largest, grow the fastest, and be the most active during the first few days of sea life.<ref name="spotila171"/>

After incubating for approximately 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand to the surface. This usually occurs at night when darkness increases the chance of escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced.<ref name="biologyandconservation10"/> Hatchlings enter the ocean by navigating toward the brighter horizon created by the reflection of the moon and star light off the water's surface.<ref name="artificiallighting"/>

Hatchlings can lose up to 20% of their body mass due to [[evaporation]] of water as they journey from nest to ocean.<ref name="spotila21"/> Hatchlings initially use the [[Undertow (wave action)|undertow]] to push them five to ten yards away from the shore.<ref name="spotila21"/> Once in the ocean, hatchling loggerheads swim for about 20 hours, bringing them far offshore.<ref name="turtleguide104"/> The loggerhead sea turtles have an iron compound, [[magnetite]], in their brains that allows the turtles to perceive the [[Earth's magnetic field]].<ref name="spotila22"/> They use this magnetite for navigation. 
Many hatchlings use ''Sargassum'' in the open ocean as protection until they reach {{convert|45|cm|in|sp=us}}.<ref name="turtleguide104"/> Hatchling loggerheads live in this [[Pelagic zone|pelagic environment]] until they reach juvenile age, and then they migrate to nearshore waters.<ref name="turtleguide104"/>

===Maturation===
[[File:Caretta caretta 060417w2.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Photo of a loggerhead swimming above a reef.|A mature loggerhead sea turtle]]

When ocean waters cool, loggerheads must migrate to warmer areas or [[hibernation|hibernate]] to some degree. In the coldest months, loggerheads submerge for up to seven hours at a time, emerging for only seven minutes to breathe. Although outdone by [[terrapin|freshwater turtles]], these are among the longest recorded dives for any air-breathing marine vertebrate.<ref name="divetimes"/> During their seasonal migration, juvenile loggerheads have the ability to use both magnetic and visual cues.<ref name="orientation cues"/> When both aids are available, they are used in conjunction; if one aid is not available, the other suffices.<ref name="orientation cues"/> 

Like all marine turtles, the loggerhead prepares for reproduction in its foraging area. This takes place several years before the loggerhead migrates to a mating area.<ref name="biologyandconservation5"/> Female loggerheads first reproduce at ages 28<U+2013>33 in Southeastern United States and Australia, and at ages 17<U+2013>30 in South Africa. Age at first reproduction in the Mediterranean, Oman, Japan, and Brazil are unknown.<ref name="spotila16"/> Nesting loggerheads have a straight carapace length of {{convert|70|<U+2013>|109|cm|in|sp=us}}. Because of the large range, carapace length is not a reliable indicator of sexual maturity.<ref name="biologyandconservation5"/> Loggerheads have an estimated maximum lifespan of 47<U+2013>67 years in the wild.<ref name="ernst50"/>

===Reproduction===
[[File:logger eggs 01.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A female loggerhead sea turtle from the back, laying eggs into the hole it has dug.|A loggerhead sea turtle laying eggs]]
Female loggerheads first reproduce between the ages of 17<U+2013>33.<ref name="spotila16"/> The loggerhead mating period lasts up to six weeks.<ref name="biologyandconservation4"/> Loggerhead sea turtles court their mates, however these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined.<ref name="biologyandconservation6"/> Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements.<ref name="biologyandconservation6"/> Studies suggest that females produce [[cloaca]]l [[pheromone]]s to indicate reproductive ability.<ref name="biologyandconservation6"/> Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempt to mount her, while she resists. Next, the male and female begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and require weeks to heal.<ref name="biologyandconservation6"/>
While nesting, females produce an average of 3.9 egg clutches and then become quiescent, producing no eggs for an average of two to three years.<ref name="biologyandconservation4"/><ref name="spotila170"/> Unlike other sea turtles, courtship and mating usually do not take place near the nesting beach but rather along migration routes between feeding and breeding grounds.<ref name="biologyandconservation6"/> Recent evidence indicates that [[ovulation]] in loggerheads is mating-induced.<ref name="induced"/>  Through the act of mating, the female ovulates eggs which are fertilized by the male. This is unique as mating-induced ovulation is rare outside of mammals.<ref name="induced"/> In the Mediterranean, loggerheads mate from late March to early June. The [[nesting season]] peaks in June and July, but varies by nesting beach.<ref name="biologyandconservation9"/>

Loggerheads may display multiple paternity.<ref name="paternity"/> Multiple paternity is possible due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation.<ref name="sperm storage"/> A single clutch may have as many as five fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the clutch.<ref name="paternity"/> Multiple paternity and female size are [[Correlation and dependence|positively correlated]].<ref name="paternity"/> Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One states that males favor large females due to perceived higher [[fecundity]] (ability to reproduce).<ref name="paternity"/> The other states that because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have a longer mating period.<ref name="paternity"/>

All sea turtles have similar basic nesting behaviors. Females return to lay eggs at intervals of 12<U+2013>17 days during the nesting season, on or near the beach where they hatched.<ref name="spotila170"/><ref name="biologyandconservation29"/> They exit the water, climb the beach, and scrape away the surface sand to form a body pit. With their hind limbs, they excavate an egg chamber in which the eggs are deposited.  The females then cover the egg chamber and body pit with sand, and finally return to the sea.<ref name="biologyandconservation13"/> This process takes 1<U+2013>2 hours and occurs in open sand areas or on top of sand dunes.<ref name="spotila170"/> The nesting area must be selected carefully because it affects characteristics such as fitness, emergence ratio, and vulnerability to nest predators.<ref name="biologyandconservation10"/> Loggerhead sea turtles have an average [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] size of 110 eggs.<ref name="biologyandconservation17"/>

==Conservation==
Loggerhead sea turtles were once intensively hunted for their meat and [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], however consumption has decreased due to worldwide illegality. Despite this, turtle meat and eggs are still consumed in countries where regulations are not strictly enforced.<ref name="eatingturtles"/> In Mexico, turtle eggs are a common meal; locals claim that the egg is an [[aphrodisiac]].<ref name="eatturtleeggs"/> Eating turtle eggs or meat can cause serious illness due to harmful bacteria such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'', and high levels of toxic metals that build up through [[bioaccumulation]]<ref name="eatingturtles"/><ref name="seaturtlebacteria"/>

===Threats===
[[File:Loggerhead nesting area.jpg|thumb|left|200px|caption|alt= An orange diamond sign with the words "Loggerhead Turtle Nesting Area" is blocking off a roped-off area on the beach where a loggerhead has laid eggs.|Loggerhead sea turtle nest roped off as part of the Sea Turtle Protection Project on [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina|Hilton Head Island]]]]

Many human activities have negative effects on loggerhead sea turtle populations. The prolonged time required for loggerheads to reach sexual maturity and the high mortality rates of eggs and young turtles from natural phenomena compound the problems of population reduction as a consequence of human activities.<ref name="spotila178"/>

Fishing gear is the biggest threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become entangled in [[Longline fishing|longlines]] or [[gillnet]]s. They also become stuck in traps, pots, [[fishing trawler|trawls]], and [[dredge]]s.<ref name="noaa"/> Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.

Nearly 24,000 metric tons of plastic is dumped into the ocean each year. Turtles ingest a wide array of this floating debris, including plastic bags, plastic sheets, plastic pellets, balloons and abandoned fishing line.<ref name="council114"/> Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns including: intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption, suffocation, ulcerations, malnutrition or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including [[polychlorinated biphenyls]], which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage or deviation from natural behaviors.<ref name="council115"/>

[[Electric light|Artificial lighting]] discourages nesting and interferes with the hatchlings ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block-out the man-made light sources.<ref name="biologyandconservation5"/> Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Loggerheads, confused by the brighter artificial light, navigate inland, away from the protective waters. This exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises.<ref name="artificiallighting"/> Artificial lighting causes tens of thousands of hatchling deaths per year.<ref name="lorne23"/>
 
Destruction and encroachment of habitat by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open sand beaches above the high tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, forcing them to nest closer to the surf.<ref name="spotila170"/> Urbanization often leads to the [[siltation]] of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability.<ref name="spotila170"/> Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles at or near the surface.<ref name="threats"/>

Annual variations in climatic temperatures can effect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios in favor of females. In one study (Mrosovsky, N. & Provancha, J. 1992), nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures over a three year period produced 87<U+2013>99% females. This raises concerns over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction.<ref name="janzen7489"/> A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature. This results in a shift in gender ratios that favor the emergence of male turtles.<ref name="spotila171"/>

===Conservation efforts===
[[File:logger ted 01.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A loggerhead sea turtle escapes a circular fisherman's net via a TED.|Loggerhead sea turtle escapes from fishing net through a [[turtle excluder device]] (TED)]]

Since the loggerhead occupies such a broad range, successful conservation requires efforts from multiple countries.<ref name="noaa"/>

Loggerhead sea turtles are classified as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and are listed under Appendix I of the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]], making international trade illegal.<ref name="noaa"/> In the United States, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS) and [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS) classify them as a threatened species under the [[Endangered Species Act]].<ref name="noaa"/> Loggerheads are listed as endangered under both Australia's [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]] and Queensland's [[Nature Conservation Act 1992]]. The Convention on Migratory Species works for the conservation of loggerhead sea turtles on the Atlantic coast of Africa as well as in the Indian Ocean and South-East.<ref name="southafricaconservation"/><ref name="southeastasiaconservation"/> Throughout Japan, the Sea Turtle Association of Japan aids in the conservation of loggerhead sea turtles.<ref name="japanconservation"/> Greece's [[ARCHELON, the Sea Turtle Protection Society of Greece|ARCHELON]] works for the conservation of loggerheads.<ref name="greececonservation"/> The Marine Research Foundation works for conservation of loggerhead sea turtles in Oman.<ref name="omanconservation"/> Annex 2 of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) Protocol of the Cartagena Convention, which deals with pollution that could harm marine ecosystems, also protects them.<ref name="noaa"/><ref name="cartagenaconvention"/> Conservation organizations worldwide have worked with the shrimp trawling industry to develop TEDs that can exclude even the largest turtles. These devices are mandatory for all shrimp trawlers.<ref name="noaa"/>

In many places during the nesting season, workers and volunteers search the coastline for nests.<ref name="volunteerwork"/> Volunteers may, if necessary, relocate the nests for protection from threats such as high spring tides and predators, and monitor the nests daily for disturbances. After the eggs hatch, volunteers uncover and tally hatched eggs, undeveloped eggs, and dead hatchlings. Any remaining live hatchlings are released or taken to research facilities. Typically, those that lack the vitality to hatch and climb to the surface die.<ref name="seaturtlebook13"/> Hatchlings use the journey from nest to ocean to build strength for the coming swim. Helping them to reach the ocean bypasses this strength building exercise and lowers their chances of survival.<ref name="seaturtlebook13"/>
