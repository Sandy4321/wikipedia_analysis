'''Walter Dix''' (born January 31, 1986 in [[Coral Springs, Florida]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[Sprint (race)|sprinter]] who specialises in the [[100 meters]] and [[200 meters]]. He is the seventh fastest 200&nbsp;m runner with a best of 19.69&nbsp;seconds, and has broken the [[10-second barrier]] in the 100&nbsp;m with a best of 9.91&nbsp;seconds.

Dix was a highly successful amateur athlete, setting a state record in the 100&nbsp;m and trying out for the US Olympic Team at the age of eighteen. He joined [[Florida State University]] and in his first year he broke the 100&nbsp;m American junior record and won at the [[NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship|NCAA Outdoor Championships]]. After a fourth place finish at the 2005 US Championships, Dix continued with his collegiate success, setting a [[NCAA]] record of 19.69 seconds in the 200&nbsp;m and coming within one hundredth of the 100&nbsp;m record. He completed a 100&nbsp;m, 200&nbsp;m, and [[4<U+00D7>100 meter relay]] sweep at the 2007 NCAA Outdoor Championships, the first to do so since [[John Carlos]]. He closed his amateur career in 2008 with a third consecutive 200&nbsp;m title, becoming the third most decorated track athlete in NCAA history, and won gold and silver at the 2008 US Olympic Trials.

Dix turned professional in mid-2008, signing a multi-million dollar contract with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. He reached the Olympic finals in the 100 and 200&nbsp;m, and won two bronze medals; the only American track athlete to win two individual medals at the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]]. He suffered an injury at the 2009 US Championships, thus missing out on the [[2009 World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]], and a contract dispute with his agent resulted in only a handful of appearances that season.

==Early life==
The son of a [[track and field]] coach, Walter Dix competed at athletics meetings from a young age, specialising in [[sprint (race)|sprinting]] and the [[long jump]]. His speed also translated well to the [[American football|football]] field, and he often played the sport at school.<ref name=Tampa>Landman, Brian (2008-07-17).

==College track athletics==
He began attending [[Florida State University]] (FSU) in late 2004, working with coach Bob Braman. At his first regional meeting for the university, he won the [[60-meter dash]], 200&nbsp;m and [[4<U+00D7>400 meter relay]], and was chosen as the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] rookie of the year.<ref>[http://www.seminoles.com/sports/c-track/spec-rel/031005aab.html Seminole Track Headed to Arkansas for National Championships]. [[Florida State Seminoles]]. (2005-03-10).

Retrieved on 2009-09-19.</ref> Following this, he became [[USA Track & Field]]'s Athlete of the Week after setting an [[United States records in track and field|American junior record]] in the 100&nbsp;m. Running in the [[Icahn Stadium]] at the 2005 NCAA East Regional Championships, his heat-winning time of 10.06&nbsp;seconds bettered [[Stanley Floyd]]'s 25-year-old mark. Dix went on to win the 100&nbsp;m final and also won the 200&nbsp;m in 20.23&nbsp;seconds, the fourth fastest time by an American junior sprinter.<ref>[http://www.usatf.org/news/view.aspx?DUID=USATF_2005_06_01_13_44_49 Dix named Athlete of the Week].

At his first [[NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship|NCAA Outdoor Championships]], Dix became FSU's first winner at the championships since 1980, and the first to do so as a [[freshman]]. He won the 100&nbsp;m in 10.21&nbsp;seconds, beating the defending NCAA champions [[DaBryan Blanton]] and [[Tyson Gay]] to the title.<ref>[http://www.seminoles.com/sports/c-track/recaps/061105aaa.html Dix Crowned National Champion in the 100m Dash].

===Multiple NCAA champion===
Dix's second year at FSU was characterised by success in the 200&nbsp;m. He won his first indoor NCAA title in the 200&nbsp;m and was runner-up in the 60&nbsp;m, having set a personal best of 6.59&nbsp;seconds in the heats.<ref name=Seminoles>[http://seminoles.cstv.com/sports/c-track/mtt/dix_walter00.html Florida State University Profile: Walter Dix].

In his third year as an FSU athlete he won four [[NCAA Division I]] titles, starting with a 200&nbsp;m win indoors.<ref>[http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/track_indoor_champs_records/2007/2007_m_idtrack_champs_records.pdf 2007 Indoor Track and Field Division I Men's].

His performance in the 200&nbsp;m was more impressive however: he set the all-time collegiate record of 19.69&nbsp;seconds in the 200&nbsp;m, breaking [[Joe DeLoach]]'s record that had stood since 1988. This made him the sixth fastest 200&nbsp;m runner ever and it was the seventh fastest run in history at the time.<ref>[http://www.usatf.org/news/view.aspx?DUID=USATF_2007_05_29_13_45_48 Dix named Athlete of the Week].

At the NCAA Outdoor Championships that year, he won three separate national titles, beating all opposition in the 100&nbsp;m, 200&nbsp;m, and [[4<U+00D7>100 meter relay]] races. This achievement made him the first man to win the three races at an NCCA Championships since [[John Carlos]] did so in 1969. Dix's time of 9.93&nbsp;seconds in the 100&nbsp;m was a world-leader at that point of the season, and was just 0.01 behind [[Ato Boldon]]'s NCAA record. For these accomplishments, he was again named USATF's Athlete of the Week.<ref>[http://www.usatf.org/news/view.aspx?DUID=USATF_2007_06_12_12_50_58 Dix named Athlete of the Week].

Furthermore, he finished with two indoor titles and 18 [[All-America]]n honors.<ref name=USATF/>

==2008 Olympic Games==
Competing at the [[2008 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships|U.S. Olympic Trials]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]], Dix qualified for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in both the 100 and 200&nbsp;m events.
