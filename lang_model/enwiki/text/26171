==History==
Prior to 1969, [[Utah State Route 55 (1931-1969)|SR-55]] connected [[SR-14 (UT)|SR-14]] with the southern boundary of [[Cedar Breaks National Monument]]. That year, as part of a [[State highways deleted by the Utah State Legislature in 1969|major realignment]] of state highways, SR-55 was deleted and its road was designated as part of [[SR-143 (UT)|SR-143]]. This left SR-143 as a non-contiguous highway, as the portion going through the national monument was not part of the highway designation.<ref name="143 resolution">{{cite web|title=State Route 143 Resolutions|publisher=[[Utah Department of Transportation]]|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=200609181649181|accessdate=2009-07-15|year=2008|month=November|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}</ref>

In 1985, the southern portion of SR-143 between SR-14 and the southern Cedar Breaks National Monument boundary was re-designated State Route 148, with no further changes to this highway. The route was designated as a [[Utah Scenic Byway]] as the Cedar Breaks Scenic Byway, with a [[Forest Service Byway]]s designation following on February 6, 1991.<ref name="Byway Designations">{{cite web|title=Cedar Breaks Scenic Byway (U-148) - Official Designations|url=http://www.byways.org/explore/byways/2022/designation.html|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref>
