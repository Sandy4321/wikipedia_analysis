'''"''Ekbletomys hypenemus''"''' is an [[Extinction|extinct]]<ref>Ray, 1962, table 10</ref> [[oryzomyini|oryzomyine]] [[rodent]] from the islands of [[Antigua]] and [[Barbuda]], [[Lesser Antilles]]. It was described as the only species of the [[subgenus]] '''"''Ekbletomys''"''' of genus ''[[Oryzomys]]'' in a 1962 Ph.D. thesis, but that name is [[unavailable name|not available]] under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] and the species remains formally unnamed. It is currently referred to as "''Ekbletomys hypenemus''" in the absence of a formally available name.<ref>Turvey, 2009, unnumbered table</ref> The species is now thought to be extinct, but association with introduced ''[[Rattus]]'' indicates that it survived until after 1500 CE on Antigua.

It is known from abundant skeletal elements, which document it as the largest known oryzomyine, on par with ''[[Megalomys desmarestii]]'', another Antillean [[endemism|endemic]]. Its morphological features indicate that it is distinct from ''[[Megalomys]]'', which includes various other Antillean oryzomyines, and derives from a separate colonization of the Lesser Antilles by oryzomyines. In the original description, it was placed close to a species now placed in ''[[Nephelomys]]'', but its relationships have not been studied since.

==Taxonomy==
Remains of "''Ekbletomys''" were first found on Barbuda in the summer of 1958<ref>Auffenberg, 1958, p.&nbsp;248</ref> and subsequently on Antigua in 1961. In his 1962 Ph.D. thesis at [[Harvard University]], paleontologist Clayton E. Ray described them as a new species, ''Oryzomys hypenemus'', which he considered distinctive enough to merit its own [[subgenus]], ''Ekbletomys''. The specific name, ''hypenemus'', is derived from <U+03CD><U+03C0><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C2> (hyp<U+00EA>nemos), which means "leeward" in [[Ancient Greek]] and refers to the species' distribution in the [[Leeward Islands]], and the subgeneric name, ''Ekbletomys'', combines Ancient Greek <U+03B5><U+03BA><U+03B2><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2> (ekbl<U+00EA>tos) "cast up" and <U+03BC><U+03C5><U+03C2> (mus) "mouse", referring to the way "''Ekbletomys''" probably reached its islands.<ref>Ray, 1962</ref> Because Ray's thesis was not published in the sense of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN),<ref>International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, 1999, Art. 8. http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp</ref> both new names proposed by Ray are not available and cannot be used in formal zoological nomenclature. The name has rarely been used in the literature on Antillean oryzomyines since, and no formal description has been published; thus, the animal still lacks a formally available name.<ref name=Tn20>Turvey, 2009, unnumbered table, note 20</ref>

Large oryzomyines from Antigua and Barbuda have been reported in several subsequent studies, but these did not explicitly refer the material to Ray's "''Oryzomys hypenemus''". New material has come from Indian Creek and Burma's Quarry on Antigua and from Indiantown Trail and Sufferers on Barbuda.<ref>Steadman et al., 1984; Watters et al., 1984; Pregill et al., 1988, 1994</ref> These studies referred the Antigua and Barbuda material to "[[Rodents of the Caribbean#Antigua|Undescribed species B]]," which is also known from archeological material on [[Guadeloupe]], [[Montserrat]] and [[Marie-Galante]]. In addition to this large species, other, smaller oryzomyines may also have occurred on Antigua;<ref>Pregill et al., 1988, p.&nbsp;22</ref> two species of oryzomyine were also formerly present on Barbuda.<ref name=Tn20/>

==Description==
"''Ekbletomys''" is known from numerous bones from Barbuda, including over a hundred [[femur|femora]] and [[tibiofibula]]e (bones of the hindlimb), four substantial [[cranium]] (skull) fragments, one of which was designated by Ray as the [[holotype]], and various others.<ref>Ray, 1962, pp.&nbsp;112<U+2013>115</ref> At the time of Ray's writing, the material from Antigua had not yet been completely sorted out, and consequently the description is based mainly on specimens from Barbuda.<ref>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;107</ref>

The Barbudan material, and particularly the skulls, shows a number of features distinctive enough for an oryzomyine to persuade Ray to allocate it to its own subgenus and species, including the following:

# short and broad front part of the skull;
# [[interorbital region]] of the skull (located between the eyes) that is narrower than that of any other oryzomyine;<ref>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;107</ref>
# squamosal (back) roots of the [[zygomatic arch]]es (cheekbones) that are oriented perpendicular to the main axis of the skull;
# an extremely short [[incisive foramen|incisive foramina]] (openings in the [[palate]] between the [[incisor]]s and the [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s);
# large molars; 
# short palate, extending barely beyond the third molar;
# [[anterocone]] (front cusp) of the first upper molar that is divided by a marked [[anteromedian flexus]].

The length of the holotype skull is larger than that of all specimens but one of ''[[Megalomys desmarestii]]'', indicating that "''Ekbletomys''" is among the largest oryzomyine species known.<ref>Ray, 1962, pp.&nbsp;107, 116<U+2013>117</ref>

As "''Ekbletomys''" and ''[[Megalomys audreyae]]'' are from the same island, a close relation between the two would be expected,<ref>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;164</ref> but the two differ so much that Ray declared any special relationship between the genus ''[[Megalomys]]'' and "''Ekbletomys''" to be "out of the question".<ref name=p165>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;165</ref> In all measurements that could be examined, ''M. audreyae'', which is known only from an upper incisor and a lower jaw with the first molar missing, falls far outside the range of variation of "''Ekbletomys''"<ref>Ray, 1962, table 33</ref> and in addition, it differs in the shape of the folds of the molars, which are broader than in "''Ekbletomys''", and in the more elongate form of the lower third molar.<ref name=p165/>

More complete material is available for the two ''Megalomys'' species known to have survived into historic times, ''M.&nbsp;desmarestii'' and ''[[Megalomys luciae|M.&nbsp;luciae]]''. ''M.&nbsp;desmarestii'' is about as large as "''Ekbletomys''" and ''M.&nbsp;luciae'' is slightly smaller. In sharp contrast to the relatively narrow interorbital in "''Ekbletomys''", these two taxa show a very broad interorbital.<ref>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;120</ref> Also, "''Ekbletomys''" shows a relatively large zygomatic breadth of the skull, whereas the relative value is at the lower end of the variation among oryzomyines in ''Megalomys''.<ref>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;121</ref> The hamular process of the [[squamosal]] bone is much longer and more slender in "''Ekbletomys''.<ref name=p124>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;124</ref> ''Megalomys'' also has relatively short incisive foramina, but not nearly as short as those in "''Ekbletomys''".<ref name=p124/> Although overall skull length is about equal in both species, molars of ''Megalomys'' are smaller than those of "''Ekbletomys''" and incisors are larger, reflecting relatively large molars and slender incisors in "''Ekbletomys''" and the reverse in ''Megalomys''.<ref>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;127</ref>

Ray considered "''Ekbletomys''" to be most closely related to ''[[Nephelomys albigularis|Oryzomys albigularis]]'', a species which at the time encompassed virtually all forms now placed in the genus ''[[Nephelomys]]''. The two agree in their robust skull with short incisive foramina, a broad [[braincase]], a similarly formed interorbital, supraorbital crests situated close together near the middle of the skull, and presence of an anteromedian flexus on the upper first molar.<ref>Ray, 1962, pp.&nbsp;165<U+2013>166</ref> Ray suggested that the origin of "''Ekbletomys''" lies in a continental ancestor similar to ''Nephelomys''.<ref>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;167</ref><!--Ray's ''O. albigularis'' was apparently really that species: http://emuweb.fieldmuseum.org/mammals/MammalsDisplay.php?irn=2569626 is the specimen he used for postcranial material.-->

==Distribution and habitat==
"''Ekbletomys hypenemus''" is known from material from two small limestone caves at [[Two Foot Bay]] at the eastern side of the island of Barbuda, [[Antigua and Barbuda]] and from a site named Mill Reef in the far east of [[Antigua]], also in Antigua and Barbuda, which has not been described in detail.<ref name=p109>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;109; Pregill et al., 1994, pp.&nbsp;16<U+2013>17</ref> In both Barbuda caves, the "''Ekbletomys''" material was found in red to yellow unconsolidated sediments on the cave floor which were partially overlain by a darker sediment that yielded the introduced ''[[Rattus]]'', indicating deposition after the first European contact around 1500.<ref>Ray, 1962, pp.&nbsp;109<U+2013>110</ref> These sediments are probably ancient [[owl pellet]]s deposited by a [[Burrowing Owl]] (''Athene cunicularia'')<ref>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;110</ref> and they also yielded the frog ''[[Eleutherodactylus johnstonei]]''; the lizards ''[[Thecadactylus rapicauda]]'', ''[[Ameiva griswoldi]]'', and ''[[Anolis leachii]]''; the birds ''[[Puffinus lherminieri]]'', ''[[Zenaida aurita]]'', ''[[Columbina passerina]]'', ''[[Tiaris bicolor]]'', and an unidentified [[Fringillidae|fringillid]]; and the bats ''[[Mormoops blainvillei]]'', ''[[Brachyphylla cavernarum]]'', ''[[Natalus stramineus]]'', ''[[Tadarida brasiliensis]]'', and ''[[Molossus molossus]]''.<ref>Ray, 1962, table&nbsp;10; Frost, 2009, Uetz et al., 2009, Peterson, 1992, Simmons, 2005, for nomenclature</ref> The deposits that included "''Ekbletomys''" are probably very late Quaternary, but [[Columbian Exchange|pre-Columbian]], and the Antigua material ranges in age from about 2500 BCE to post-Columbian.<ref>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;112</ref>

In order to colonize Barbuda and Antigua, "''Ekbletomys''" must have reached the islands through overwater dispersal, probably by means of [[Rafting event|raft]]ing.<ref>Ray, 1962, pp.&nbsp;176<U+2013>185</ref> Ray thought it improbable that the ancestor of the animal reached the islands through repeated overwater dispersal ([[island hopping]]) from mainland South America along the Lesser Antilles all the way to Barbuda. Even when sea levels dropped during the [[Pleistocene]], the animal would still have been required to overcome seven water barriers, a series of voyages "no less wondrous than those of Sindbad."<ref>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;188</ref> Instead, he argued that the animal reached the islands directly on a raft from mainland South America, probably from one of the continent's large rivers.<ref>Ray, 1962, p.&nbsp;189</ref>
