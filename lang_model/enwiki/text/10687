The '''T-6''' was a single-engine advanced [[trainer aircraft]] designed by [[North American Aviation]], used to train [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilots of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], [[United States Navy]], [[Royal Air Force]] and other [[air force]]s of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] during [[World War II]]. The T-6 is known by a variety of designations depending on the model and operating air force. The USAAC called it the "AT-6", the US Navy, the "SNJ", and the Commonwealth air forces, the '''Harvard'''. It remains a popular [[warbird]] aircraft.

==Development==
The T-6 originated from the [[North American NA-16]] prototype (first flown on [[April 1]], [[1935 in aviation|1935]]) which, modified as the NA-26, was submitted as an entry for a [[USAAC]] "Basic Combat" aircraft competition in March, [[1937 in aviation|1937]]. The first model went in to production and 180 were supplied to the USAAC as the '''BC-1''' and 400 to the RAF as the '''Harvard I'''. The US Navy received 16 modified aircraft, designated the '''SNJ-1''', and a further 61 as the '''SNJ-2''' with a different engine.

A further 92 '''BC-1A''' and three '''BC-2''' aircraft were built before the shift to the "advanced trainer" designation, '''AT-6''', which was equivalent to the BC-1A. The differences between the AT-6 and the BC-1 were new squared-off wingtips and a straight-edged rudder, producing the definitive Texan appearance. The AT-6 was designated the '''Harvard II''' for RAF/RCAF orders and 1,173 were supplied by purchase or [[Lend Lease]], mostly operating in [[Canada]] as part of the [[Empire Air Training Scheme]].

Next came the '''AT-6A''' which was based on the NA-77 design and was powered by the [[Pratt & Whitney R-1340|Pratt & Whitney R-1340-49]] Wasp radial engine. The USAAF received 1,549 and the US Navy 270 (as the '''SNJ-3'''). The '''AT-6B''' was built for gunnery training and could mount a .30 in [[machine gun]] on the forward fuselage. It utilised the R-1340-AN-1 engine which was to become the standard for the remaining T-6 production. Canada's [[Noorduyn Aviation]] built a R-1340-AN-1 powered version of the AT-6A which was supplied to the USAAF as the '''AT-16''' (1,500 aircraft) and the RAF/RCAF as the '''Harvard IIB''' (2,485 aircraft), some of which also served with the [[Fleet Air Arm]].

The NA-88 design resulted in 2,970 '''AT-6C''' Texans and 2,400 as the '''SNJ-4'''. The RAF received 726 of the AT-6C as the '''Harvard IIA'''. Modifications to the electrical system produced the '''AT-6D''' (3,713 produced) and '''SNJ-5''' (1,357 produced). The AT-6D, redesignated the '''Harvard III''', was supplied to the RAF (351 aircraft) and Fleet Air Arm (564 aircraft). Subsequently the NA-121 design gave rise to 25 '''AT-6F''' Texans for the USAAF and 931, as the '''SNJ-6''' for the US Navy. The ultimate version, the '''Harvard 4''' (oftern erroneously referred to as the Harvard IV), was produced by Canada Car and Foundry during the 1950s, and supplied to the RCAF, USAF and Bundeswehr. 

===Production===
The T-6 Texan formed the basis for the Australian Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation [[CAC Wirraway|Wirraway]], of which 755 were built between 1939 and 1946.

A total of 15,495 T-6s of all variants were built.

==Service record==

[[Image:North American Harvard at Onerahi Aerodrome, New Zealand 1961.jpg|thumb|250px|RNZAF North American Harvards at Onerahi Aerodrome, near Whangarei, New Zealand in 1961.]]

During the [[Korean War]] and to a lesser extent, the [[Vietnam]] war, T-6's were pressed into service as [[forward air control]] aircraft. These aircraft were designated T-6 "Mosquito"s [http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/air_power/ap55.htm]. The RAF used the Harvard in Kenya against the [[Mau Mau]] in the 1950s where they operated with 20 lb bombs and machine guns against the gangs. Some operations took place at altitudes around 20,000 ft.

Since the Second World War, the T-6 has been a regular participant at [[airshow|air show]]s, and was used in many [[Film|movie]]s. For example, in ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'', converted single-seat T-6s painted in [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] markings represent [[Mitsubishi Zero]]es. The [[New Zealand]] Warbirds "Roaring 40s" aerobatic team use ex-[[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] Harvards.
