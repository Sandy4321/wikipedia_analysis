'''Robert Duncan''' ([[January 7]], [[1919 in poetry|1919]] <U+2013> [[February 3]], [[1988 in poetry|1988]]) was an [[American poetry|American]] poet and a student of [[H.D.]] and the [[Western esoteric tradition]] who spent most of his career in and around [[San Francisco]]. Though associated with any number of literary traditions and schools, Duncan is often identified with the [[New American Poetry]] and [[Black Mountain poets]]. Duncan's mature work emerged in the [[1950s]] from within the literary context of [[Beat generation|Beat culture]] and today he is also identified as a key figure in the [[San Francisco Renaissance]].

==Birth and Early Life==
Duncan was born in [[Oakland, California]] as Edward Howard Duncan Jr. His mother, Marguerite Pearl Duncan, had died in childbirth and his father was unable to afford him, so in [[1920]] he was adopted by Edwin and Minnehaha Symmes, a family of devout [[Theosophy|Theosophist]]s.  They renamed him Robert Edward Symmes; it was only after a psychiatric discharge from the army in [[1941]] that he formed the composite of his previous names and became Robert Edward Duncan.  

The Symmeses had begun planning for the child's arrival long prior to his adoption.  There were terms for his adoption that had to be met: he had to be born at the time and place appointed by the [[Astrology|astrologers]], his mother was to die shortly after giving birth, and he was to be of [[English people|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Protestant]] descent.  His childhood was stable, and his parents were popular and social members of their community--Edwin was a prominent architect and Minnehaha devoted much of her time to volunteering and serving on committees.  Robert grew up surrounded by the occult in one form or another; he was well aware of the circumstances of his fated birth and adoption and his parents carefully interpreted his dreams.  He was also told that in his lifetime he would witness a second death of civilization through a holocaust.  The family adopted a second child, Barbara Eleanor Symmes, in [[1920]].  She was born almost one year after him, on [[January 6]] of that year, and was chosen under circumstances similar to that of her brother; her presence was expected to bring good [[karma]] into the family.  

At age three Duncan was injured in an accident on the snow which resulted in his becoming cross-eyed and seeing double.  In ''Roots and Branches'', his second major book, he wrote, "I had the double reminder always, the vertical and horizontal displacement in vision that later became separated, specialized into a near and a far sight. One image to the right and above the other. Reach out and touch. Point to the one that is really there."

After his adopted father's death in [[1936]], Duncan started studying at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  He began writing poems inspired in part by his [[left wing politics]] and acquired a reputation as a bohemian.  His friends and influences  included Mary and Lilli Fabilli, [[Virginia Admiral]], [[Pauline Kael]], and [[Ida Bear]], among others.  Duncan thrived as storyteller, poet, and fledgling bohemian, but by his sophomore year he had begun to drop classes and had quit attending obligatory military drills. 

In [[1938]], he briefly attended [[Black Mountain College]], but left after a dispute with faculty on the subject of  the [[Spanish Civil War]].  He spent two years in [[Philadelphia]] and then moved to [[Woodstock (town), New York|Woodstock]], [[New York]], to join a [[commune]] run by [[James Cooney]]. There he worked on Cooney's magazine ''The Phoenix'' and met [[Henry Miller]] and [[Anais Nin]], who both admired his poetry.  Cooney was less fond of its [[pagan]] tendencies.

==Duncan and Homosexuality==
In Philadelphia, Duncan had a relationship with a male instructor he had first met in Berkeley. In [[1941]] he was drafted and declared his homosexuality to get discharged. In [[1943]], he had his first heterosexual relationship. This ended in a short, disastrous marriage. In [[1944]], he published ''The Homosexual in Society'', an essay in which he compared the plight of homosexuals with that of African Americans and Jews. From [[1951]] until his death, he lived with the artist [[Jess Collins]]. Before then, he had a relationship with [[Robert De Niro Sr]], the father of famed actor [[Robert De Niro]] Jr.

==San Francisco==
Duncan returned to San Francisco in [[1945]] and was befriended by [[Helen Adam]], [[Madeline Gleason]], and [[Kenneth Rexroth]] (with whom he had been in correspondence for some time). He returned to Berkeley to study [[Medieval literature|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance literature]] and cultivated a reputation as a shamanistic figure in San Francisco poetry and artistic circles. He also became friends with fellow poets [[Jack Spicer]] and [[Robin Blaser]]. In the early 1950s he started publishing in [[Cid Corman]]'s ''Origin'' and the ''Black Mountain Review'' and in [[1956]] he spent a time teaching at the [[Black Mountain College]]. These connections were instrumental in getting some of the [[Black Mountain poets]] involved in the San Francisco Renaissance.

==Mature Works==
During the 1960s, Duncan achieved considerable artistic and critical success with three books; ''The Opening of the Field'' ([[1960]]), ''Roots and Branches'' ([[1964]]), and ''Bending the Bow'' ([[1968]]). These are generally considered to be his most significant works. After ''Bending the Bow'', he vowed to avoid the distraction of publication for fifteen years. Duncan's friend and fellow poet, [[Michael Palmer]], writes about this time in his essay "Ground Work: On Robert Duncan" :

{{cquote|The story is well-known in poetry circles: around 1968, disgusted by his difficulties with publishers and by what he perceived as the careerist strategies of many poets, Duncan vowed not to publish a new collection for fifteen years. (There would be chapbooks along the way.) He felt that this decision would free him to listen to the demands of his (supremely demanding) poetics and would liberate the architecture of his work from all compromised considerations. ...It was not until 1984 that ''Ground Work I: Before the War'' appeared, for which he won the National Poetry Award, to be followed in February 1988, the month of his death, by ''Ground Work II: In the Dark''. <ref>http://jacketmagazine.com/29/palmer-duncan.html</ref>}}
