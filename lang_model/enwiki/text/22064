'''Odwalla Inc.''' ({{pron-en|o<U+028A>.<U+02C8>dw<U+0251>.l<U+0259>}}) is a [[health food]] company founded in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[California]] in 1980 that sells fruit juice and [[food bars]]. Odwalla, a wholly-owned subsidiary of [[Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], is headquartered in [[Half Moon Bay, California]], with a production facility in [[Dinuba, California]]. The name "Odwalla" was taken from that of a character in the song "Illistrum" written by the [[Art Ensemble of Chicago]] jazz group as a metaphor for the company.

The company experienced strong growth from its incorporation in 1985, expanding its distribution network from California to most of North America, and went public in 1993. However, a period of decline occurred as a result of a fatal outbreak of ''[[Escherichia coli O157:H7|E.&nbsp;coli O157:H7]]'' [[bacteria]] in 1996 caused by contamination of its apple juice. Odwalla recalled its juices and experienced a ninety-percent reduction in sales following the event. The company gradually recovered, and, after a few years, was making a profit again. Odwalla was acquired by the [[Coca-Cola Company]] in 2001 for [[USD|$]]181&nbsp;million.

Odwalla's range of products includes juices, [[smoothie]]s, dairy-free [[soy milk]], and similar organic beverages, as well as several flavors of energy bars, known as [[food bars]], and [[Bottled water|bottled spring water]]. While Odwalla originally sold unpasteurized juices (because the process of pasteurization alters the flavor of juice), following the ''E. coli'' outbreak, Odwalla adopted [[flash pasteurization]] and other industry-standard safety procedures.

===1996 ''E. coli'' outbreak===
====Safety issues prior to the ''E.&nbsp;Coli'' outbreak====
The Odwalla plant had several minor food safety issues, many of which arose because Odwalla did not [[pasteurize]] its juice.<ref name="deadly"/> Tests discovered low levels of [[listeria monocytogenes]], a pathogen that can harm [[pregnant]] women, at the Odwalla factory in 1995.<ref>{{cite press release

The next year, Dave Stevenson, Odwalla's technical services director who oversaw quality assurance, suggested to Odwalla executives that the company should add a chlorine rinse to guard against bacteria on the skin of processed fruit, supplementing its existing phosphoric acid wash process. However, this plan was dropped by Chip Bettle, Odwalla's senior vice president, who feared that the chemicals would harm the fruit and alter the flavor of the juice.<ref name="deadly"/><ref name="questions">{{cite web

In a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' written on January 5, 1998, Odwalla's director of communications, Christopher C. Gallagher, wrote that "Odwalla continuously upgraded its manufacturing process in the period leading up to the recall. Moreover, our primary indicator of overall quality was daily bacteria-level readings, which were relatively low and decreasing in apple juice".<ref>{{cite web

====Outbreak and subsequent recall====
On October 30, 1996, health officials from the state of Washington informed Odwalla that they had found a link between an outbreak of the ''[[Escherichia coli O157:H7|E.&nbsp;coli&nbsp;O157:H7]]'' bacterium and a batch of Odwalla's fresh apple juice produced on October 7. This was confirmed on November 5, and may have resulted from using rotten fruit; one account tells of fruit being used that was highly decayed.<ref name="deadly"/> Another possible source of contamination was fallen apples ("grounders"), that had come into contact with animal [[feces]] and not been properly cleaned.<ref name="CNN1">{{cite web
