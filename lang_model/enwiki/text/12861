'''''The Histories''''' of [[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] is considered the first work of [[history]] in [[Western literature]]. Written about [[440 BC]], ''The Histories'' tells the story of the war between the [[Persian Empire]] and the [[Greek city-states]] in the [[5th century BC]]. Herodotus traveled extensively around the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], conducting interviews and collecting stories for his book. At the beginning of ''The Histories'', Herodotus sets out his reasons for writing it:

<blockquote>
''Herodotus of Halicarnassus here displays his enquiry, so that human achievements may not become forgotten in time, and great and marvellous deeds &ndash; some displayed by [[Greeks]], some by [[barbarian]]s &ndash; may not be without their glory; and especially to show why the two peoples fought with each other.'' ([[Aubrey de Selincourt]] translation)
</blockquote>

''The Histories'' is divided into nine books, each named after one of the [[Muses]].  The rise of the Persian Empire is chronicled, and the causes for the conflict with [[Greece]].  Herodotus treats the conflict as an ideological one, frequently contrasting the absolute power of the Persian king with the democratic government of the Greeks. ''The Histories'' contains a famous account of the [[Battle of Marathon]], of which Herodotus wrote:

<blockquote>
''So when the battle was set in array, and the preliminary sacrifice promised success,  instantly the [[Athens|Athenians]], so soon as they were let go, charged the barbarians at a run. Now  the distance between the two armies was little short of eight furlongs. The Persians,  therefore, when they saw the Greeks coming on at speed, made ready to receive them,  although it seemed to them that the Athenians were bereft of their senses, and bent upon  their own destruction; for they saw a mere handful of men coming on at a run without  either horsemen or archers. Such was the opinion of the barbarians; but the Athenians in  close array fell upon them, and fought in a manner worthy of being recorded.'' (unknown translation)
</blockquote>
