Entered combat in mid-December 1943, supported the [[D-Day|invasion of Normandy]] during June 1944 by patrolling the [[English Channel]], escorting bombardment formations to the French coast, and dive-bombing and strafing bridges, locomotives, and rail lines near the battle area.  After D-Day, engaged chiefly in escorting bombers to oil refineries, marshalling yards, and other targets in such cities as [[Ludwigshafen]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Frankfurt]], Berlin, [[Merseburg]], and Brux.   Continued combat operations until the German capitulation in May 1945.   Returned to the United States and was inactivated in November, 1945.
