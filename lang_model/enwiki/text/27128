Prewitt Diaz helped to train Red Cross volunteers in mental health support in the wake of the 2001 El Salvador earthquakes. While in El Salvador he was awarded the American Red Cross Lifesaving Award.

When the 2004 tsunami battered the shores of South Asian countries, the American Red Cross psychosocial support team based in India and led by disaster mental health expert, Dr. Joseph Prewitt-Diaz, quickly responded to the devastated to Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Indonesia to assist in developing programs.<ref name="TRP">[http://www.redcross.org/tsunamirelief/plan/ American Red Cross Tsunami Relief Plan]</ref>.

Prewitt Diaz made signi<U+FB01>cant adaptations to the psychosocial support program on the basis of his extensive experience in Hurricane Mitch in Central  America, the earthquake-affected area in Bhuj and the riot-torn camps in Gujarat. Part of the adaptation was to build a detailed career ladder of advanced training, enabling paid and volunteer local staff to build their knowledge and expertise over time in a well-structured process. <ref>[www.scribd.com/doc/20713524/Jacobs-Intervention]</ref>. According to Jacobs (2007) The work of Prewitt Diaz have been the foundation of a virtual quantum leap in psychological support in the South Asia region and have produced a second generation of psychological support programs.

In the critical early weeks following the tsunami, American Red Cross-trained volunteers in psychological first aid.<ref name="TRP"/> These psychosocial programs initiated by the American Red Cross team planned to provide service to the children and their families in communities and schools. Five years later psychosocial support services has been provided to more than 733,700 people). 

The team focused on training Red Cross/Red Crescent paid and volunteer staff to reach the most vulnerable of the tsunami affected areas.<ref name="TRP"/> Five years later 277,000 Red Cross Red Crescent staff and volunteers, and implementing a variety of activities such as support groups, events that bring communities back together, livelihoods programs and play activities for children have been trained.

An ethnographic study<U+201D> <ref name="HB">[http://highbeam.com/doc/1G1-7848104.html high beam]</ref>. The study documents for the first time the existence of the <U+201C>culture of migrancy<U+201D> and its effects on children and their schooling.
