The '''University of Michigan''' ('''UM''', '''U-M''', '''UMich''', or '''U of M'''), frequently referred to as simply '''Michigan''', is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] located in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], [[United States]]. It is the state's oldest university and has two satellite campuses located in [[University of Michigan<U+2013>Flint|Flint]] and [[University of Michigan<U+2013>Dearborn|Dearborn]]. The university was founded in 1817 in [[Detroit]] as the ''Catholepistemiad'', or ''University of Michigania'', about 20 years before the [[Michigan Territory]] officially became a state. What would become the university moved to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] in 1837 onto {{convert|40|acre|ha}} of what is now known as Central Campus. Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the university campus has expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than 31 million gross square feet (712&nbsp;acres or 2.38&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), and has transformed its academic program from a strictly classical curriculum to one that includes science and research.

The university has very high research activity and its comprehensive graduate program offers doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and [[STEM fields]] (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) as well as professional degrees in medicine, law, social work and dentistry. Michigan was one of the founding members of the [[Association of American Universities]], and its body of living alumni (as of 2012) comprises more than 500,000.

Michigan's athletic teams compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and are collectively known as the [[Michigan Wolverines|Wolverines]]. They are members of the [[Big Ten Conference]].

The University of Michigan was  established in Detroit in 1817 as the ''Catholepistemiad'', or University of Michigania, by the governor and judges of [[Michigan Territory]]. The Rev. John Monteith was one of the university's founders and its first President. Ann Arbor had set aside {{convert|40|acre|ha}} that it hoped would become the site for a new state capitol, but it offered this land to the university when [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] was chosen as the state capital. What would become the university moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 thanks to governor [[Stevens T. Mason]]. The original {{convert|40|acre|m2}} became part of the current Central Campus.<ref name="central campus history">{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/pres/history/markers/diag.html|title=The Central Forty and The Diag (1837)|year=2006| publisher=University of Michigan History and Traditions Committee|accessdate=April 29, 2007}}</ref> The first classes in Ann Arbor were held in 1841, with six freshmen and a sophomore, taught by two professors. Eleven students graduated in the first commencement in 1845.<ref name="university history">{{cite web|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/umtimeline/general.php|title=University of Michigan Timelines: General University Timeline|publisher=Bentley Historical Library|date=July 5, 2007|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}</ref> By 1866 enrollment increased to 1,205 students, many of whom were [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veterans.  Women were first admitted in 1870.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/research/topics/gendersp.php|title=Suggested Research Topics - Gender and Social Space on the University Campus, 1870-1970|publisher=Bentley Historical Library|date=September 26, 2008|accessdate=December 25, 2008}}</ref> [[James Burrill Angell]], who served as the university's president from 1871 to 1909, aggressively expanded U-M's curriculum to include professional studies in [[dentistry]], [[architecture]], [[engineering]], [[government]], and [[medicine]]. U-M also became the first American university to use the [[seminar]] method of study.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brubacher, John Seiler|title=Higher Education in Transition|date=July 1, 1997|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=187|isbn=1-56000-917-9}}</ref>

From 1900 to 1920 the university constructed many new facilities, including buildings for the dental and pharmacy programs, chemistry, natural sciences, [[Hill Auditorium]], large hospital and library complexes, and two residence halls. In 1920 the university reorganized the [[University of Michigan College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] and formed an advisory committee of 100 industrialists to guide academic research initiatives. The university became a favored choice for bright Jewish students from New York in the 1920s and 1930s when the [[Ivy League]] schools had quotas restricting the number of Jews to be admitted.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.gladwell.com/2005/2005_10_10_a_admissions.html|title=Getting In|work=The New Yorker|date=October 10, 2005| accessdate=October 26, 2007}}</ref> As a result, U-M gained the nickname "Harvard of the West," which became commonly parodied in reverse after [[John F. Kennedy]] referred to himself as "a graduate of the Michigan of the East, Harvard University" in his speech proposing the formation of the [[Peace Corps]] while on the front steps of the [[Michigan Union]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=about.history.speech|title=Remarks of Senator John F. Kennedy|publisher=Peace Corps| date=October 14, 1960|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref> During [[World War II]], U-M's research grew to include [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] projects such as [[proximity fuze]]s, [[PT boat]]s, and [[radar jamming]].

By 1950, enrollment had reached 21,000, of whom more than one third or 7,700 were veterans supported by the [[G.I. Bill]]. As the [[Cold War]] and the [[Space Race]] took hold, U-M became a major recipient of government grants for strategic research and helped to develop peacetime uses for [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. Much of that work, as well as research into alternative energy sources, is pursued via the Memorial Phoenix Project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.umich.edu/about/#history|title=MMPEI<U+2013>History|year=2010|publisher=Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy Institute|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>

[[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s speech outlining his [[Great Society]] program was given during U-M's 1964 spring commencement ceremony.<ref name="university history"/> During the 1960s, there were numerous protests against the Vietnam War and related to other issues at the U-M. On March 24, 1965, a group of U-M faculty members and 3,000 students held the nation's first ever faculty-led "teach-in" to protest against American policy in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ns.umich.edu/MT/95/Oct95/mt11o95.html|title=Vietnam teach-in 30 years ago|author=Newman, Matthew|journal=Michigan Today|date=October 1995|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/dissent/teachins.php|title=A Decade of Dissent:Teach-Ins|publisher=Bentley Historical Library|date=December 22, 2008|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref> In response to a series of [[sit-in]]s in 1966 by ''Voice''<U+2013>the campus political party of [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]], U-M's administration banned sit-ins. In response, 1,500 students had a one-hour sit-in the LSA Building, which housed administrative offices.

Former U-M student and noted architect [[Alden B. Dow]] designed the current Fleming Administration Building, which was completed in 1968. The building's plans were drawn in the early 1960s, before student activism prompted a concern for safety, but the Fleming Building's narrow windows, all located above the first floor, and fortress-like exterior led to a campus rumor that it was designed to be riot-proof. Dow denied those rumors, claiming the small windows were designed to be energy efficient.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2007/04/06/CampusLife/Explained.Colemans.Castle-2827579.shtml|author=Holmes, Jake|title=Explained: Coleman's castle|work=The Michigan Daily|date=April 6, 2007|accessdate=April 6, 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080626012736/http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2007/04/06/CampusLife/Explained.Colemans.Castle-2827579.shtml|archivedate=June 26, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

During the 1970s, severe budget constraints challenged the university's physical development; but, in the 1980s, the university received increased grants for research in the social and physical sciences. The university's involvement in the anti-missile [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] and investments in [[South Africa]] caused controversy on campus.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/week-daily-history-37|title=This Week in Daily history|date=September 23, 2003|work=The Michigan Daily|accessdate=December 25, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Michiganensian Yearbook (Class of 1984)| publisher=University of Michigan|date=1984-1985|page=164}}</ref> During the 1980s and 1990s, the university devoted substantial resources to renovating its massive hospital complex and improving the academic facilities on the North Campus. In its 2011 annual financial report, the university announced that it had dedicated $497 million per year in each of the prior 10 years to renovate buildings and infrastructure around the campus. The university also emphasized the development of computer and information technology throughout the campus.

In the early 2000s (decade), U-M also faced declining state funding due to state budget shortfalls. At the same time, the university attempted to maintain its high academic standing while keeping [[tuition]] costs affordable. There were disputes between U-M's administration and labor unions, notably with the Lecturers' Employees Organization (LEO) and the Graduate Employees Organization (GEO), the union representing graduate student employees. These conflicts led to a series of one-day walkouts by the unions and their supporters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2005/03/25/News/Gsis-Walk.Out-1429731.shtml| title=GSIs walk out|author=Saini, Kjyot|date=March 25, 2005|work=The Michigan Daily|accessdate=April 28, 2007|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184907/http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2005/03/25/News/Gsis-Walk.Out-1429731.shtml|archivedate=September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The university is currently engaged in a $2.5 billion construction campaign.<ref name="Schneider">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/realestate/commercial/31michigan.html|title=A Rust Belt Oasis, the University of Michigan Is Spending Billions to Grow |last=Schneider|first=Keith |date=December 31, 2008|work=New York Times|pages=B6|accessdate=December 31, 2008}}</ref>

[[File:UniversityofMichiganLawLibrary.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Law Library Interior|alt=Law Library]]
In 2003, two lawsuits involving U-M's [[affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] admissions policy reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] (''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'' and ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]''). President [[George W. Bush]] took the unusual step of publicly opposing the policy before the court issued a ruling.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/01/20030115-7.html |title=President Bush Discusses Michigan Affirmative Action Case |publisher=Office of the Press Secretary, White House |date=January 15, 2003 |accessdate=December 27, 2008}}</ref> The court found that race may be considered as a factor in university admissions in all public universities and private universities that accept federal funding. But, it ruled that a point system was unconstitutional. In the first case, the court upheld the [[University of Michigan Law School|Law School]] admissions policy, while in the second it ruled against the university's undergraduate admissions policy.

The debate continues because in November 2006, Michigan voters passed [[Michigan Civil Rights Initiative|Proposal 2]], banning most affirmative action in university admissions. Under that law, race, gender, and national origin can no longer be considered in admissions.<ref name="NoAffirAct">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011002095.html | title=University of Michigan Drops Affirmative Action for Now | date=January 11, 2007 | agency=Associated Press | work=The Washington Post | accessdate=January 12, 2007 | first=David N. | last=Goodman}}</ref> U-M and other organizations were granted a stay from implementation of the passed proposal soon after that election, and this has allowed time for proponents of affirmative action to decide legal and constitutional options in response to the election results. The university has stated it plans to continue to challenge the ruling; in the meantime, the admissions office states that it will attempt to achieve a diverse student body by looking at other factors, such as whether the student attended a disadvantaged school, and the level of education of the student's parents.<ref name="NoAffirAct" />

== Campus ==
The Ann Arbor campus is divided into four main areas: the North, Central, Medical, and South Campuses. The physical [[infrastructure]] includes more than 500 major buildings,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oseh.umich.edu/environment/floodcontrol.shtml | title=Environmental Protection Management Practices: Flood Control | year=2010 | publisher=University of Michigan Occupational Safety and Environmental Health | accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref> with a combined area of more than 31 million square feet or {{convert|712|acre|km2|adj=on}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oseh.umich.edu/pdf/09_report.pdf | title=2009 Annual Environmental Report | publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan | year=2009 | page=7 | accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref> The Central and South Campus areas are contiguous, while the North Campus area is separated from them, primarily by the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://campusinfo.umich.edu/maps/ann-arbor | title=Ann Arbor Map | year=2008 | publisher=University of Michigan, MM&D | accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref> There is also leased space in buildings scattered throughout the city, many occupied by organizations affiliated with the University of Michigan Health System. An East Medical Campus has recently been developed on Plymouth Road, with several university-owned buildings for outpatient care, diagnostics, and outpatient surgery.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www2.med.umich.edu/pcdv2/maps/dsp_maps.cfm?maplocation=AmbulatorySurgeryandMedicalProceduresCenter&hc_id=ASMPC | title=Street Map to Rachel Upjohn Building | publisher=University of Michigan Health System | year=2008 | accessdate=October 25, 2008}}<U+2014>The linked map shows the entire East Medical Campus.</ref>

In addition to the U-M Golf Course on South Campus, the university operates a second golf course called "Radrick Farms Golf Course" on Geddes Road. The golf course is only open to faculty, staff, and alumni.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://radrick.umich.edu/ | title=Welcome to Radrick Farms Golf Course | publisher=University of Michigan | year=2013 | accessdate=April 8, 2013}}</ref> Another off-campus facility is the Inglis House, which the university has owned since the 1950s. The Inglis House is a {{convert|10,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} mansion used to hold various social events, including meetings of the board of regents, and to host visiting dignitaries.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://umhistory.dc.umich.edu/history/publications/inglis/ | title=The Inglis House Estate at the University of Michigan | author=Duderstadt, Anne | year=2007 | publisher=University of Michigan | accessdate=April 28, 2007}}</ref> The university also operates a large office building called Wolverine Tower in southern Ann Arbor near Briarwood Mall. Another major facility is the [[Matthaei Botanical Gardens]], which is located on the eastern outskirts of Ann Arbor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aec.bf.umich.edu/campus.plans/Phase1/Phase1%20Overview%20-%204-22-98%20Introduction%20and%20Summary.pdf | title=Campus Planning - Overview Report 1998 (Introduction and Summary) | date=April 22, 1998 | page=3 | publisher=University of Michigan - Architecture, Engineering and Construction | accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref>

All four campus areas are connected by bus services, the majority of which connect the North and Central Campuses.

=== Central Campus ===
[[File:Hill Auditorium 2010.jpg|240px|thumb|Hill Auditorium and Burton Tower|alt=Red brick building with white stone facade. A tall white-colored stone clock tower with a green roof is in the background]]
Central Campus was the original location of U-M when it moved to Ann Arbor in 1837. It originally had a school and dormitory building (where Mason Hall now stands) and several houses for professors on forty acres of land bounded by North University Avenue, South University Avenue, East University Avenue, and State Street. The President's House, located on South University Avenue, is the oldest building on campus as well as the only surviving building from the original forty acre campus.<ref name="central campus history"/> Because Ann Arbor and Central Campus developed simultaneously, there is no distinct boundary between the city and university, and some areas contain a mixture of private and university buildings.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oseh.umich.edu/pdf/08_report.pdf | title=2008 Annual Environmental Report | publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan | year=2008 | page=9 | accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref> Residence halls located on Central Campus are split up into two groups: the Hill Neighborhood and Central Campus.<ref name="CampusHousing">{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Housing Overviews|url=http://www.housing.umich.edu/undergrad|publisher=University of Michigan Division of Student Affairs | year=2013 | accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref>

Central Campus is the location of the [[University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts|College of Literature, Science and the Arts]], and is immediately adjacent to the medical campus. Most of the graduate and professional schools, including the [[Ross School of Business]], the [[Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy]], the [[University of Michigan Law School|Law School]] and the [[University of Michigan School of Dentistry|School of Dentistry]], are on Central Campus. Two prominent libraries, the [[Hatcher Graduate Library|Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library]] and the Shapiro Undergraduate Library which are connected by a [[skyway|skywalk]], are also on Central Campus,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.si.umich.edu/aboutsi/campus | title=The University of Michigan Campus | publisher=University of Michigan School of Information | year=2013 | accessdate=April 8, 2013}}</ref> as well as [[Museums at the University of Michigan|museums]] housing collections in [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[paleontology]], [[zoology]], [[dentistry]], and art. Ten of the buildings on Central Campus were designed by Detroit-based architect [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]] between 1904 and 1936. The most notable of the Kahn-designed buildings are the [[Burton Tower|Burton Memorial Tower]] and nearby [[Hill Auditorium]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/campus_tour/chronology.php | title=A Chronology of University of Michigan Buildings, 1840-1999 | date=July 5, 2007 | publisher=Bentley Historical Library | accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>

North Campus is the most contiguous campus, built independently from the city on a large plot of farm land<U+2014>approximately {{convert|800|acre|km2}}<U+2014>that the university bought in 1952.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://blog.mlive.com/ann_arbor_business_review/2008/01/contest_seeks_um_north_campus.html | title=Contest seeks U-M North Campus hub designs | author=Migliore, Greg | work=Ann Arbor Business Review | date=January 31, 2008 | accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref> It is newer than Central Campus, and thus has more [[modern architecture]], whereas most Central Campus buildings are classical or gothic in style. The architect [[Eero Saarinen]], based in [[Birmingham, Michigan]], created one of the early master plans for North Campus and designed several of its buildings in the 1950s, including the Earl V. Moore School of Music Building.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Carter, Brian | year=2000 | title=Eero Saarinen-Operational Thoroughness A Way of Working | journal=Dimensions Volume Fourteen | pages=32<U+2013>39}}</ref> North and Central Campuses each have unique bell towers that reflect the predominant architectural styles of their surroundings. Each of the bell towers houses a grand [[carillon]]. The North Campus tower is called [[Lurie Tower]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Duderstadt | first=Anne | title=The University of Michigan College of Engineering | url=http://umhistory.dc.umich.edu/history/publications/Downloads/AMD%20Engineering%20Book.pdf | year=2003 | page=83 | publisher=Millennium Project, University of Michigan}}</ref> The University of Michigan's largest residence hall, [[Bursley Hall]], is located on North Campus.<ref name="CampusHousing" />

North Campus houses the [[University of Michigan College of Engineering|College of Engineering]], the [[University of Michigan School of Music|School of Music, Theatre & Dance]], the [[University of Michigan School of Art & Design|School of Art & Design]], the [[Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning]], and an annex of the School of Information.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://campusinfo.umich.edu/maps/north-campus| title=North Campus Map | publisher=University of Michigan Division of Student Affairs | date=August 16, 2012 | accessdate=April 8, 2013}}</ref> The campus is served by the Duderstadt Center, which houses the Art, Architecture and Engineering Library. The Duderstadt Center also contains multiple [[computer lab]]s, [[non-linear editing system|video editing]] studios, electronic music studios, an audio studio, a video studio, multimedia workspaces, and a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[virtual reality]] room.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dc.umich.edu/Welcome.htm | title=Welcome to the James and Anne Duderstadt Center | date=February 1, 2006 | publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan | accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref> Other libraries located on North Campus include the [[Gerald R.

=== South Campus ===
South Campus is the site for the athletic programs, including major sports facilities such as [[Michigan Stadium]], [[Crisler Center]], and [[Yost Ice Arena]]. South Campus is also the site of the Buhr library storage facility, the Institute for Continuing Legal Education,<ref name="SouthCampus">{{cite web |url=http://campusinfo.umich.edu/maps/south-campus | title=South Campus Map | year=2013 | publisher=University of Michigan Division of Student Affairs | accessdate=April 8, 2013}}</ref>  and the Student Theatre Arts Complex, which provides shop and rehearsal space for student theatre groups.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://campusinvolvement.umich.edu/article/94 | title=Student Theatre Arts Complex | publisher=University of Michigan Division of Student Affairs | date=August 16, 2012 | accessdate=April 8, 2013}}</ref> The university's departments of public safety and transportation services offices are located on South Campus.<ref name="SouthCampus" />

U-M's golf course is located south of Michigan Stadium and Crisler Arena. It was designed in the late 1920s by [[Alister MacKenzie]], the designer of [[Augusta National Golf Club]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]] (home of The [[Masters Tournament]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mgoblue.com/facilities/golf-course.html | title=University of Michigan Golf Course | year=2010 | work=MGoBlue | publisher=University of Michigan Athletic Department | accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref> The course opened to the public in the spring of 1931.

The University of Michigan consists of a flagship campus in Ann Arbor, with two regional campuses in [[University of Michigan<U+2013>Dearborn|Dearborn]] and [[University of Michigan-Flint|Flint]]. The Board of Regents, which governs the university and was established by the Organic Act of March 18, 1837, consists of eight members elected at large in biennial state elections<ref name=Hebel2004>{{harvnb|Hebel|2004}}</ref> for overlapping eight-year terms.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://regents.umich.edu/about/ | title=About the Board of Regents | year=2008 | publisher=University of Michigan Board of Regents | accessdate=December 25, 2008}}</ref><ref>

Instead a rotating roster of professors carried out the day-to-day administration duties.<ref name=Hinsdale1906_37>{{harvnb|Hinsdale|1906|p=37}}</ref>

The [[President of the University of Michigan]] is the principal executive officer of the university. The office was created by the [[Michigan Constitution]] of 1850, which also specified that the president was to be appointed by the Regents of the University of Michigan and preside at their meetings, but without a vote.<ref name=StateOfMichigan1850>{{harvnb|State of Michigan|1850}}, Article 13, section 8</ref> Today, the president's office is at the Ann Arbor campus, and the president has the privilege of living in the President's House, the university's oldest building located on Central Campus in Ann Arbor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/campus_tour/preshouse.php | title=President's House | date=October 3, 2007 | publisher=Bentley Historical Library | accessdate=December 26, 2008}}</ref> [[Mary Sue Coleman]] is the 13th president of the university and has served since August 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/pres/aboutmsc.php |title=About Mary Sue Coleman |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate= October 1, 2010}}</ref> Her compensation for 2008<U+2013>2009 totaled $783,850.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/premium/stats/990/public.php?keyword=Mary+Sue+Coleman&radio=Prez |title=Presidents' Pay and Benefits at Public Institutions |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |accessdate=October 1, 2010}}</ref>

=== Endowment ===
As of September 2013, U-M's [[financial endowment]] (the "University Endowment Fund") was valued at $8.75 billion.<ref name="endowment" /> In 2008, Michigan's endowment was the [[List of U.S. colleges and universities by endowment|seventh largest]] endowment in the U.S. and the third-largest among U.S public universities at that time, as well as the [[List of U.S. colleges and universities by endowment#Certain institutions by endowment growth|fastest growing]] endowment in the nation over the last 21 years.<ref>{{cite news | author=Keenan, Matthew | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=afIqiSrR2HUY | title=Yale Posts Highest Endowment Returns, Topping Stanford, Harvard | date=November 22, 2005 | work=Bloomberg | accessdate=August 31, 2010}}</ref> The endowment is primarily used according to the donors' wishes, which include the support of teaching and research. In mid-2000, U-M embarked on a massive fund-raising campaign called "The Michigan Difference," which aimed to raise $2.5 billion, with $800 million designated for the permanent endowment.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.giving.umich.edu/news/images/pdf/fall2004.pdf | title=Leaders & Best - Philanthropy at Michigan | year=2004 | publisher=The University of Michigan Office of Development | accessdate=August 28, 2010|format=PDF}}</ref> Slated to run through December 2008, the university announced that the campaign had reached its target 19 months early in May 2007.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mlive.com/news/aanews/index.ssf?/base/news-22/117949939798070.xml&coll=2 | title=U-M's Michigan Difference campaign hits goal | author=Gershman, Dave | date=May 18, 2007 | work=Ann Arbor News | accessdate=May 18, 2007}}</ref> Ultimately, the campaign raised $3.2 billion over 8 years.

=== Student government ===

Housed in the Michigan Union, the [[Student governments in the United States#University of Michigan|Central Student Government]] (CSG) is the central student government of the University. With representatives from each of the University's colleges and schools, the CSG represents students and manages student funds on the campus. In recent years CSG has organized airBus, a transportation service between campus and the [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]], and has led the university's efforts to register its student population to vote, with its Voice Your Vote Commission (VYV) registering 10,000 students in 2004. VYV also works to improve access to non-partisan voting-related information and increase student voter turnout.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.msa.umich.edu/mgovote2006/about.html | title=About Voice Your Vote | year=2007 | publisher=University of Michigan CSG | accessdate=March 21, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071003010504/http://www.csg.umich.edu/mgovote2006/about.html |archivedate = October 3, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> CSG has also been successful at reviving [[Homecoming]] activities, including a carnival and parade, for students after a roughly eleven-year absence in October 2007.<ref>{{cite news | author=Shubert, Cathe | url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2007/09/19/StudentGovernment/Homecoming.Parade.Carnival.To.Return-2977420.shtml | title=Homecoming parade, carnival to return | work=The Michigan Daily | date=September 19, 2007 | accessdate=April 6, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625211641/http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2007/09/19/StudentGovernment/Homecoming.Parade.Carnival.To.Return-2977420.shtml |archivedate = June 25, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

There are student governance bodies in each college and school. The two largest colleges at the University of Michigan are the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LS&A) and the [[University of Michigan College of Engineering|College of Engineering]]. Undergraduate students in the LS&A are represented by the LS&A Student Government (LSA SG).<ref>{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=https://csg.umich.edu/about/who-we-are|accessdate=2/11/13}}</ref>  The University of Michigan Engineering Council (UMEC) manages undergraduate student government affairs for the College of Engineering. Graduate students enrolled in the Rackham Graduate School are represented by the Rackham Student Government (RSG). In addition, the students that live in the residence halls are represented by the University of Michigan Residence Halls Association (RHA).<ref>{{cite web|title=Residence Hall Government|url=http://www.housing.umich.edu/reshalls/rha|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=2/11/13}}</ref>

A longstanding goal of the student government is to create a student-designated seat on the Board of Regents, the university's governing body.<ref name="student regent">{{cite news | url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/jun/06-29-98/edit/edit1.html | title=Denied again: University should have a student regent | work=The Michigan Daily | date=June 29, 1998 | accessdate=September 15, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060429235333/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/jun/06-29-98/edit/edit1.html |archivedate = April 29, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Such a designation would achieve parity with other Big Ten schools that have student regents. In 2000, students Nick Waun and Scott Trudeau ran for the board on the state-wide ballot as third-party nominees. Waun ran for a second time in 2002, along with Matt Petering and Susan Fawcett.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0203/Oct21_02/14.shtml | title=Regent candidates discuss tuition, health care issues at forum | date=October 21, 2002 | work=The University Record Online | accessdate=April 28, 2007}}</ref> Although none of these campaigns has been successful, a poll conducted by the State of Michigan in 1998 concluded that a majority of Michigan voters would approve of such a position if the measure were put before them.<ref name="student regent" /> A change to the board's makeup would require amending the [[Michigan Constitution]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/sep/09-08-98/news/news20.html | title=Board of regents says no to MSA student regent campaign fee | author=Holmes, Erin | date=September 8, 1998 | work=The Michigan Daily | accessdate=April 28, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013222504/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/sep/09-08-98/news/news20.html |archivedate = October 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

===School songs===
The University of Michigan's [[fight song]], "[[The Victors]]," was written by student [[Louis Elbel]] in 1898 following the last-minute football victory over the [[University of Chicago]] that won a league championship. The song was declared by [[John Philip Sousa]] as "the greatest college fight song ever written."<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Hondorp, Fabrikant Alexis|title=University of Michigan College Prowler Off the Record |date=January 1, 2005 |publisher=College Prowler, Inc|isbn=1-59658-163-8 |page=118}}</ref> The song refers to the university as being "the Champions of the West." At the time, U-M was part of the Western Conference, which would later become the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Michigan was considered to be on the Western Frontier when it was founded in the old Northwest Territory. Although mainly used at sporting events, the fight song can be heard at other events. President [[Gerald Ford]] had it played by the [[United States Marine Band]] as his entrance anthem during his term as president from 1974 to 1977, in preference over the more traditional "[[Hail to the Chief]]"<ref>{{cite book | title=The Press and the Ford Presidency | author=Rozell, Mark J. | date=October 15, 1992 | publisher=University of Michigan Press | isbn=0-472-10350-4 | page=38}}</ref> and the [[Michigan Marching Band]] performed a slow-tempo variation on the fight song at his funeral.<ref>{{cite news | author=Michelle Singer | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/02/politics/main2320308.shtml | title=Gerald Ford Returns Home For The Last Time | date=January 3, 2007 | work=CBS News | accessdate=February 18, 2010}}</ref> The fight song is also sung during graduation commencement ceremonies. The university's [[alma mater]] song is "[[The Yellow and Blue]]." A common rally cry  is "Let's Go Blue!,"  had a complementary short musical arrangement written by former students Joseph Carl, a sousaphonist, and Albert Ahronheim, a [[drum major]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Stieg, Bill | url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122081/index.htm | title=A Catchy Intro To A Cheer Became Music To The Ears Of Myriad Fans | date=May 21, 1984 | work=Sports Illustrated | accessdate=December 25, 2008}}</ref>
