'''Raymond C. Watson, Jr., Ph.D., P.E.''' ([[Professional Engineer]]), is a science, engineering, and [[management consultant]] and also a technical historian. His firm, R. C. Watson and Associates, is located in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], and serves the space, defense, and intelligence communities.

A native of [[Anniston, Alabama]], Watson began his career in 1942, after becoming an "instant engineer" in the now-forgotten Engineering, Science, and Management War Training (ESMWT) college program. During 1944-46, he served in the U.S. Navy, first completing the year-long Electronics Training Program, then instructing in airborne radar and related technologies.

After military service, Watson formed the Dixie Service Company, recognized by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] as a consulting firm. Simultaneously he returned to academic studies, eventually earning graduate degrees in physics, engineering science, and business administration, all on a part-time basis. While continuing as a consultant, in 1953 he joined the faculty of Jacksonville State Teachers College (now [[Jacksonville State University]]) and soon headed the Physics and Engineering Department. Named a Faculty Fellow by the [[National Science Foundation]], he built a radio astronomy observatory for the [[University of Florida]]. As a consulting engineer, he assisted in establishing the Alabama Educational Television Network (now [[Alabama Public Television]]), the first of this type in the nation.

In 1960, Watson joined Brown Engineering Company (later [[Teledyne Brown Engineering]]) in Huntsville, Alabama, and served many years in technical and executive positions. He led in the development of [[laser Doppler velocimetry]], forerunner of the laser radar, and was awarded the NASA Public Service Medal for contributions to the Apollo [[Moon Landing]] program. He had a major involvement in [[National missile defense]] research, including the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]. In parallel with his industrial activities, Watson was on the faculty of the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] and, later, President and Professor of [[Southeastern Institute of Technology]].

During the 1990s, Watson served as the Managing Director of N.I. Medical, LLC, the American arm of an Israeli firm, and CEO/President of Vision Technologies Kinetics, Inc., a subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Engineering. As of 2009, he still works full-time as a consultant and is also Chair of the Engineering and Technology Advisory Board of [[Alabama A&M University]]. His latest books are ''Solving the Naval Radar Crisis'' (Trafford 2007) and ''Radar Origins Worldwide'' (Trafford 2009).
