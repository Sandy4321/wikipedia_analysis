During his lifetime he was solitary and never had children. He was described as shy, simple and prudent who did not like to be the center of attention. He had a particular affinity for the state of Veracruz, considering himself one at heart, prompting him to work on many artistic and other projects in [[Xalapa]], the [[Veracruz, Veracruz|city of Veracruz]] and [[San Andr<U+00E9>s Tuxtla]]. As a member of the Taller de Gr<U+00E1>fica Popular, he believed that artists should work for the people rather than for themselves.

He lived simply and saved much of the money he earned or won through prizes without ever spending it.<ref name="gsalas"> {{cite web |url= http://www.stunam.org.mx/8prensa/8forouniver1/forouni11/8fu11-15.html |title= ALBERTO BELTR<U+00C1>N: el gran artista olvidado |last= Salas Zimbr<U+00F3>n |first= Gabriela |month=May |year=2007 |work= Foro Universitario |publisher= Sindicato de Trabajadores de UNAM |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans_title=Alberto Beltr<U+00E1>n: the great forgotten artist |accessdate=August 17, 2012 }} </ref>

In 1972 he did a monumental glass piece for the Civil Registry of Veracruz. In 1988, he painted a mural in acrylic for the Attorney General<U+2019>s office in Mexico City.<ref name="jgenis"/>

One other late project was the creation of the Centro de Informaci<U+00F3>n y Documentaci<U+00F3>n Alberto Beltr<U+00E1>n, created in 1971 with the collaboration of the Direcci<U+00F3>n General de Arte Popular and the Secretar<U+00ED>a de Educaci<U+00F3>n P<U+00FA>blica.

However, despite the awards he is relatively unknown, even in Mexico.<ref name="gsalas"/> One of his drawings, that of [[Benito Ju<U+00E1>rez]] entering Mexico City, was exhibited for decades in the [[Metro Z<U+00F3>calo|Zocalo metro station]] as a mural, but misattributed to <U+201C>an unknown artist of the last (19th) century.<U+201D> Beltr<U+00E1>n comment this was that he wished he had lived in the 19th century instead of the 20th.<ref name="jgenis"/> 

In the last year of his life, there were three exhibitions of his life<U+2019>s work to honor him but much of it was exhibited as copies as the originals were lost and many of the originals were in poor condition. It is not known exactly how many works he created during his lifetime or where those that still exist are. However, those works which have been authenticated are valuable.<ref name="jgenis"/> A large quantity of his work, probable the largest collection of his to exist, was donated by the artists to [[UNAM]], which the university edited into a book in 2003 called ''Alberto Beltr<U+00E1>n, 1923-2002 Cronista e Ilustrador''.  The book also included essays by [[Vicente Quitarte]], [[Ernesto de la Torre Villar]], [[Silvia Gonz<U+00E1>lez]] and Elena Poniatowska.

Most of his work was related to publications.

These were used to illustrate publications such as literature published by the Instituto Nacional Indigenista and a book called Relatos, mitos y leyendas de la Chinantla by Roberto Weitlaner. The book Los mexicanos se pintan solos by Ricardo Cort<U+00E9>s Tamayo features images by  him illustrating various scenes featuring the common people of the country in the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name="jgenis"/>

His work with the Taller de Gr<U+00E1>fica Popular focused on anti-[[ American imperialism|US imperialism]], [[Nazism]], [[fascism]] and [[Francoist Spain]].
