The '''Atlantic Coast Conference''' ('''ACC''') is a [[List of college athletic conferences|collegiate athletic league]] in the [[United States]]. Founded in 1953, the ACC sanctions competition for its twelve member [[university|universities]] in twenty-three sports in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]. Football teams participate in the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the higher of two levels of Division I [[college football]]. 

The ACC is considered one of the six "power conferences," and the ACC football champion receives an automatic bid to one of the [[Bowl Championship Series]] games each season.

== History ==

Seven universities became charter members of the ACC: [[Clemson University|Clemson]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]], [[North Carolina State University|North Carolina State]], [[University of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]]. They had previously been members of the [[Southern Conference]], but they left partially due to that league's ban on post-season play. After drafting a set of bylaws for the creation of a new league, the seven withdrew from the Southern Conference at the Spring Meeting on the morning of May 8, 1953. The bylaws were ratified and the ACC officially came into existence on June 14, 1953. On December 4, 1953, officials convened in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[North Carolina]], and admitted [[University of Virginia|Virginia]] into the conference.<ref>http://www.theacc.com/this-is/acc-this-is.html Retrieved 2008-07-17.</ref>

In 1971, the ACC lost a member in [[University of South Carolina|South Carolina]], which two decades later in 1991 became a member of the [[Southeastern Conference]]. The ACC operated with seven members until the addition of a former Southeastern Conference member, [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] from the [[Metro Conference]] on April 3, 1978. The addition of [[Florida State University|Florida State]], also formerly from the Metro Conference, on July 1, 1991, brought the total to nine. 

{{See also|2005 NCAA football realignment}}
The ACC added three members from the [[Big East Conference]] during the 2005 cycle of conference realignment: [[University of Miami|Miami]] and [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]] joined on July 1, 2004, and [[Boston College]] joined on July 1, 2005, as the league's twelfth member and the first and only one from [[New England]]. The expansion was not without controversy, since [[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]], [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]], and [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]] (and, initially, Virginia Tech) filed lawsuits against the ACC and against Miami and Boston College for conspiring to weaken the [[Big East Conference]].

In early 2011 the ACC Hall of Champions will open next to the Greensboro Coliseum arena, making the ACC the first college sports conference to have a hall of fame.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

=== History ===
[[Image:Acclocationsmap2.png|325px|right|thumb|Locations of Atlantic Coast Conference member institutions.]]
Historically, the ACC has been considered one of the most successful conferences in men's basketball. The early roots of ACC basketball began primarily thanks to two men: [[Everett Case]] and [[Frank McGuire]].

The [[North Carolina State University|North Carolina State]] coach [[Everett Case]] had been a successful high school coach in [[Indiana]] who accepted the Wolfpack's head coaching job at a time that the school's athletic department had decided to focus on competing in football on a level with [[Duke University|Duke]], then a national power in college football. Case's North Carolina State teams dominated the early years of the ACC with a modern, fast-paced style of play. He became the fastest college basketball coach to reach many "games won" milestones.

Case eventually became known as ''The Father of ACC Basketball.'' Despite his success on the court, he may have been even a better promoter off-the-court. Case realized the need to sell his program and university. That is why he organized the funding and construction of [[Reynolds Coliseum]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], as the new home court for his team. At the time, the Reynolds Coliseum was the largest on-campus arena in America, and it was therefore used as the host site for many Southern Conference Tournaments, ACC Tournaments, and the ''[[Dixie Classic (basketball tournament)|Dixie Classic]]'', an annual event involving the four ACC teams from North Carolina as well as four other prominent programs from across the nation. The Dixie Classic brought in large revenues for all schools involved and soon became one of the premier sporting events in the South.

At North Carolina, [[Frank McGuire]] was hired as the men's basketball coach to counter Case's personality, as well as the dominant success of his program. McGuire began recruiting in his home area of New York. McGuire knew that basketball was the major high school athletic event of the region, unlike football in the south. Case and McGuire literally ''invented'' a rivalry. Both men realized the benefits created through a rivalry between them. It brought more national attention to both of their programs and increased fan support on both sides. For this reason, they often exchanged verbal jabs at each other in public, while maintaining a secret working relationship in private.

In 1957, when McGuire's North Carolina team won the national championship, an entrepreneur from Greensboro named Castleman D. Chesley noticed the popularity that it generated. He developed a five-station television network which began broadcasting regular season ACC games the following season. From that point on, ACC basketball gained large popularity.

The ACC has been the home of many prominent basketball coaches, including [[Terry Holland]], [[Everett Case]], [[Frank McGuire]], [[Vic Bubas]], [[Press Maravich]], [[Dean Smith]], [[Norm Sloan]], [[Bones McKinney]], [[Al Skinner]], [[Lefty Driesell]], [[Jim Valvano]], [[Mike Krzyzewski]], [[Bobby Cremins]], [[Rick Barnes]], [[Gary Williams]], and [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]].

=== Present day schedule ===
With the expansion to 12 teams in the 2005-2006 season, the ACC schedule could no longer accommodate a home-and-away series between every pair of teams each season. In the new scheduling format that was agreed to, each team is assigned two permanent partners and nine rotating partners over a three-year period. Teams play their permanent partners in a home-and-away series each year. The rotating partners are split into three groups: three teams who are played in a home-and-away series, three teams who are played at home, and three teams who are played on the road. The rotating partner groups are rotated over the three-year period.

The table below lists each school's two permanent scheduling partners.

=== National Championships ===
Over the course of its existence, ACC schools have captured 12 NCAA men's basketball championships. [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] has won five, [[Duke Blue Devils basketball|Duke]] has won four, [[NC State Wolfpack|North Carolina State]] has won two, and [[University of Maryland athletics|Maryland]] has won one. In addition, 8 of the 12 members have advanced to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Final Four|Final Four]] at least once.

In women's basketball, the ACC has won two national championships, with [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball|North Carolina]] and [[Maryland Terrapins women's basketball|Maryland]]. In 2006, Duke, Maryland, and North Carolina all advanced to the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]], the first time a conference placed three teams in the women's Final Four. Both 2006 NCAA women's finalists were from the ACC, with Maryland defeating Duke for the title.

===Divisions===
In 2005, the ACC began divisional play in football. Division leaders compete in a playoff game to determine the ACC championship. The inaugural Championship Game was played on December 3, 2005, in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], at the stadium then known as [[Jacksonville Municipal Stadium|Alltel Stadium]], in which Florida State defeated Virginia Tech to capture its 12th championship since it joined the league in 1992. The [[2009 ACC Championship Game]] was played at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida]] with [[Georgia Tech]] defeating [[Clemson]] by a score of 39-34.

The ACC is the only NCAA Division I conference whose divisions are not divided geographically (North/South, East/West).<ref>[http://espn.go.com/college-football/standings NCAA College Football Standings] Accessed March 3, 2010</ref>

This division structure leads to each team playing the following games:
* Five games within its division (one against each opponent)
* One game against a designated ''permanent rival'' from the other division (not necessarily the school's closest traditional rival, even within the conference); this is similar to the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] setup
* Two rotating games (one home, one away) against teams in the other division

In the table below, each column represents one division. Each team's designated permanent rival is listed in the same row in the opposing column.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theacc.com/genrel/101804aaa.html | title=ACC Unveils Future League Seal, Divisional Names | date=October 18, 2004 | publisher=Atlantic Coast Conference | accessdate=October 18, 2009}}</ref>

=== Bowl Games ===
Within the [[Bowl Championship Series]], the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] serves as the home of the ACC champion against another BCS at-large selection unless the conference's champion is selected for the national championship game.

The other bowls pick ACC teams in the order listed. The [[ACC Championship Game]] runner-up is guaranteed to fall no lower than the [[Sun Bowl]], the 4th pick, in the conference bowl hierarchy.<ref>http://espn.go.com/blog/acc/post/_/id/7643/new-acc-bowl-selection-process-in-effect-for-2010</ref> Previously the ACC Championship Game runner-up had been guaranteed the [[Music City Bowl]] with usually then the 5th pick.<ref>http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/112508aaa.html</ref>  The other rule change that will be in effect for the next four years is that the ACC has eliminated the clause in the contract that states if a bowl team has already selected the runner-up, it doesn't have to choose it again. <ref>http://espn.go.com/blog/acc/post/_/id/7643/new-acc-bowl-selection-process-in-effect-for-2010</ref>

Moreover, a bowl game can bypass a team in the selection process only if the two teams in question are within one game of each other in the overall ACC standings. This rule was instituted in response to concerns over the 2005 bowl season, in which Atlantic Division co-champion Boston College fell to the then last-pick [[MPC Computers Bowl]] (the MPC Computers Bowl is now the [[Humanitarian Bowl]]).

The following is the bowl selection order starting in 2010 and through 2013 and the teams involved in each bowl.
