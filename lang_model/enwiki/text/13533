'''Stephen Johnson Field''' ([[November 4]], [[1816]] &ndash; [[April 9]], [[1899]]) was an associate justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]] from [[May 20]], [[1863]], to [[December 1]], [[1897]].  Prior to this, he was the 5th Chief Justice of the [[California Supreme Court]].

Born in [[Haddam, Connecticut]], he was the sixth of the nine children of David Dudley Field, a [[Congregationalist]] minister, and his wife Submit Dickinson.  He grew up in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], and went to [[Turkey]] at thirteen with his sister and her missionary husband.   He graduated from [[Williams College]], [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], in [[1837]].  While attending [[Williams College]] he joined [[Delta Upsilon]]  Fraternity.  After studying law in [[New York, New York|New York City]] with his brother [[David Dudley Field]], they practiced law together until [[1848]] when he went west to [[California]] in the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]].  There his legal practice boomed and he was the mayor of [[Marysville, California|Marysville]].  The voters sent him to the [[California Assembly]] in [[1850]], but lost a race the next year for the [[California Senate]].  His successful legal practice led to his election to the [[California Supreme Court]] in [[1857]], serving six years.

[[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed him to the newly created tenth Supreme Court seat, to achieve both regional balance (he was a Westerner) and political balance (he was a Democrat, but a Unionist one).  It would also give the Court someone familiar with real estate and mining issues.

He was a vocal proponent of the [[substantive due process]] theory that protected [[property rights]] from regulation under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]--as illustrated in his dissents to the [[Slaughterhouse Cases]] and [[Munn v. Illinois]].  Field's views, which were not so much grounded in the Constitution's text as his views of [[natural law]], were eventually adopted by the court's majority, but only after his death.  However, he helped end the [[income tax]] ([[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company]]), limit [[anti-trust]] law ([[United States v. E.C. Knight Company]]), and the power of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]].  

Field's concern for individual rights extended to minorities, writing opinions against California's laws discriminating against the Chinese immigrants to that state.

However, Justice Field dissented in [[Strauder v. West Virginia]], a case holding that the exclusion of African-Americans from a jury that convicted Strauder, an African-American, of murder, was a violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[Equal Protection Clause]].

Field insisted on breaking [[John Marshall]]'s record of thirty-three years on the court, even though he was not able to handle the workload.  His colleagues asked him to resign due to his being intermittently [[senile]][http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c03_f.html] but he refused, staying on until [[1897]].  He lived only two years more, dying in [[Washington, D.C.]], and buried there in the [[Rock Creek Cemetery]].

There was an assassination attempt on Justice Field by a former associate of his on the California Supreme Court, [[David S. Terry]].  Terry was shot and killed by Field's bodyguard.  See George C. Gorham, <U+201C>The Story of the Attempted Assassination of Justice Field by a Former Associate on the Supreme Bench of California<U+201D>, Journal of the Supreme Court Historical Society, Volume 30; Issue 2 (2005).
