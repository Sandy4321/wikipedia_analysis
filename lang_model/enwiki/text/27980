Dudeney was best known for her [[drama]]tic and [[romance novel|romance fiction]], though her books often touched upon social issues affecting the English working and lower middle classes.<ref name="Cardinal"/> She was often touted by her publishers as "the novelist of the [[Weald]] and the Marsh and the [[South Downs|Down]] Countries".<ref name="Cardinal"/>  She is also considered an early [[Feminist history in the United Kingdom#19th century|Victorian feminist writer]] whose popular "[[domestic drama|marriage problem]]" novels, along with those of her contemporary, [[M.P. Willcocks]], showed female characters who were often frustrated with problems in their own marriages.<ref>Miller, Jane Eldridge. ''Rebel Women: Feminism, Modernism, and the Edwardian Novel''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997. (pg. 70) ISBN 0-226-52677-1</ref>

In 1998, author Diana Crook edited and published Dudeney's personal diaries titled ''A Lewes Diary: 1916<U+2013>1944'' describing her life living in Lewes with Henry Dudeney prior to and during the [[interwar years]]. The book's success saw renewed interest in her work and resulted in the reprinting of several of her novels in 2008 and 2009.

==Biography==
Alice Dudeney was born to Frederick Whiffin, a master tailor, and his wife Susan Howe in [[Brighton]] on 21 October 1864. She was educated in [[Hurstpierpoint]],<ref name="Addison">Addison, Henry R., Charles H. Oakes, William J. Lawson, and Douglas Sladen, eds. "Dudeney, Mrs. Henry." Who's Who, 1906. London: Adam & Charles Black, 1906: 504+.</ref> a region of [[West Sussex]] which she would use as a setting for her later novels, and later introduced to 25-year old [[Henry Dudeney]] through a mutual friend. The two were married at [[St Andrew, Holborn|St. Andrew Church]], [[Holborn]], [[London]] on 3 November 1884.<ref name="Sutherland">Sutherland, John. ''The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1990. ISBN 0-8047-1842-3 (pg. 200-201)</ref>

The newlyweds rented a house in Great James Street, Bedford Row, close to the [[printing house]]s. Dudeney, then an aspiring writer, wrote a few short stories intended for publication but much of her time was taken up as a [[housewife]] and [[pregnancy|expectant mother]]. Their first child, Phyllis Mary, was born in May 1887 but died after four months.<ref name="Guy">Guy, Richard K. and Robert E. Woodrow, ed. ''The Lighter Side of Mathematics: Proceedings of the Eug<U+00E8>ne Strens Memorial Conference on Recreational Mathematics and Its History''. Washington, D.C.: Mathematical Association of America, 1994. (pg. 297, 299-300) ISBN 0-88385-516-X</ref>

Distraught over the loss of their baby, Dudeney stopped writing for a time and took a job as assistant secretary to then head of the [[Cassell, Petter, Galpin & Co|Cassells publishing firm]], [[Thomas Wemyss Reid|Sir Wemyss Reid]]. The literary atmosphere of Cassells eventually prompted her to return to writing and would eventually launch her career as a novelist. Within a short time, three of her short stories appeared in several Cassells journals and led to her writing full-length novels. Her connections with Cassells also allowed Henry another outlet for his work.<ref name="Guy"/>

The couple's second child, Margery Janet, was born in 1890 and they decided to move away from London. They decided on a rented cottage near the Surrey-Sussex border, in a small hamlet north of [[Billingshurst]], and found themselves preferring life in the English countryside. Within several years, they were able to purchase a three-acre plot of land on the outskirts of [[Horsell]]. With the help of Henry's brother-in-law Maurice Pocock, then living with his wife, Kate Dudeney, in nearby [[Chertsey]], they planned the construction of a [[English country house|country estate]] named Littlewick Meadow in 1897. The house was so large that they hired several servants to help run it. Having a common interest in [[antique furniture]], they also attended sales in the local area and furnished their home with a unique collection of [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] and later period antiques.<ref name="Guy"/> Much of Dudeney's personal life was described as "very domestic". In a [[Who's Who]] interview, her hobbies were listed as "gardening and collecting old oak furniture".<ref name="Putnam"/><ref name="Addison"/><ref name="Sutherland"/> She was also involved in the restoration of dilapidated English historical homes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.uiuc.edu/default/Scripting/ArticleViewExt.asp?BaseHRef=DIL/1929/01/15&EntityId=Ar00407 |title=Alice Dudeney |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=15 January 1929 |month= |year= |work= |publisher=UIUC Library |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |format= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}</ref>

That same year<!--which, 1897?-->, Dudeney published her first novel ''A Man with a Maid''. Much of her early work was dramatic fiction dealing with then controversial moral topics (''e.g.'', [[Legitimacy (law)|illegitimate pregnancy]]) and domestic life among the working and lower middle classes.<ref name="Sutherland"/>  ''Folly Corner'' (1899) deals with a young woman who moves from London to live on an ancestral Sussex farm and becomes involved in a [[bigamy|bigamous]] relationship.<ref name="Sutherland"/> ''Maternity of Harriott Wicken'' (1899) is a murder story which ends with the death of a mother and her child from measles.<ref name="Sutherland"/> ''Men of Marlowe's'' (1900) is a collection of [[bohemian]] short stories which take place in [[Gray's Inn|Gray's Inn, London]].<ref name="Sutherland"/> ''The Third Floor'' (1901) follows another young girl who, living alone in London, becomes a victim of sexual abuse.<ref name="Sutherland"/>

As Dudeney's success as a writer grew, the money from her writing provided for much of the family's income. By the turn of the 20th century, her popularity had gained her and Henry entry to both literary and court circles. In 1912, her literary work was profiled by [[Frederic Taber Cooper]] in ''Some English Story Tellers: A Book of the Younger Novelists''. She was also a regular guest of [[Sir Philip Sassoon, 3rd Baronet|Sir Philip Sassoon]] and his sister [[Sybil Sassoon|Sybil]] at their home in [[Port Lympne Wild Animal Park|Port Lympne]]. Her novel ''Head of the Family'' (1917) was dedicated to Philip at his request, and she often received presents from him, such as a tortoiseshell bag, a jade brooch, and a fur wrap.<ref>Stansky, Peter. ''Sassoon: The Worlds of Philip and Sybil''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2003. (pg. 157) ISBN 0-300-09547-3</ref> She later donated a series of letters sent to her by Philip to biographer [[Cecil Roth]] who used them in his book ''The Sassoon Dynasty''.<ref>Roth, Cecil. ''The Sassoon Dynasty''. New York: Arno Press, 1977. (pg. 6, 15)</ref>  Marital troubles, including Alice's affair with the artist [[Paul Hardy (illustrator)|Paul Hardy]], caused her to separate from Henry, resulting in the sale of Littlewick.  They eventually reconciled following their daughter Margery Janet's marriage and emigration to Canada, and moved to Castle Precincts House, [[Lewes]] in 1916.<ref name="Guy"/>

In 1920, she was given honorable mention with a number of other non-American authors who were excluded by [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences|American Society of Arts and Sciences]] from receiving the ''O. Henry Memorial Award''.<ref>Williams, Blanche Colton, Harry Hansen and Herschel Brickell, ed. ''O. Henry Memorial Award Prize Stories of 1920''. Garden City, New York, and Toronto: Doubleday, Page and Company, 1921.</ref> Her 1929 novel ''The Peep Show''<ref>"The Peep Show". ''Outlook and Independent''. Vol. 151 (1929): 9+.</ref> was adapted into a [[Broadway show]] by playwright [[Elsie Schauffler]].<ref>"Woman Playwright Leaves For London". ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]''. 20 April 1933.</ref>

After Henry's death in 1930, Dudeney remained in Lewes and continued writing up until 1937. She died on 21 November 1945, after suffering a stroke and was buried alongside her husband in the Lewes town cemetery. Their grave is marked by a copy of an 18th-century Sussex sandstone obelisk, which Alice had copied after Henry's death to serve as their mutual tombstone.<ref>Dudeney, Mrs. Henry (editor: Diana Crook).  ''A Lewes Diary: 1916<U+2013>1944''.  1998.</ref>

Over 50 years following her death, Alice's personal diaries were edited by Diana Crook and published in 1998. The book, titled ''A Lewes Diary: 1916<U+2013>1944'', described her sometimes troubled married life with Henry Dudeney during their 30-years living in Lewes. Several anecdotes were used in later books of wartime diaries.<ref>Aldrich, Richard J. ''Witness to War: Diaries of the Second World War in Europe and the Middle East''. London: Doubleday, 2004. (pg. 389-390, 422-423) ISBN 0-385-60678-8</ref><ref>Taylor, Irene and Alan, ed. ''The War Diaries: An Anthology of Daily Wartime Diary Entries Throughout History''. Edinburgh: Canongate, 2005. (pg. 532) ISBN 1-84195-720-8</ref> The success of this book resulted in several of her stories being reprinted, including ''Spindle and Plough'', ''Men of Marlowe's'' and ''Robin Brilliant'' in 2008 and ''The Maternity of Harriott Wicken'', ''Rachel Lorian'', ''The Story of Susan'', ''Trespass'', ''A Large Room'', ''The Battle of the Weak, Or, Gossips Green'' and ''Folly Corner'' in 2009.
