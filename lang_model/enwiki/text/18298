'''Crucifixion darkness''' is a three hour period of darkness in the middle of the day, described in the Christian [[synoptic Gospels]] as part of their account of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]]. 

Ancient and medieval Christian writers treated this as a [[miracle]], and believed it to be one of the few episodes from the [[New Testament]] which were confirmed by non-Christian sources. Pagan commentators of the [[Roman era]] explained it as an [[eclipse]], although Christian writers pointed out that an eclipse during [[Passover]], when the crucifixion took place, would have been impossible; an eclipse cannot happen during the [[full moon]].

Modern scholarship, noting the way in which similar accounts were association in ancient times with the deaths of notable figures, tends to look upon this phenomenon as a literary invention, attempting to convey a sense of the power of Jesus in the face of death, or a sign of God's displeasure with the [[Jewish people]]. Scholars have also noted the ways in which this episode appears to draw on earlier biblical accounts of darkness from the [[Book of Amos]] and the [[Book of Exodus]].

==Biblical account==
{{Gospel Jesus}}
The original biblical reference is in the [[Gospel of Mark]], from around the year 70.{{sfnp|Witherington|2001|p=31|ps=: 'from 66 to 70, and probably closer to the latter'}}{{sfnp|Hooker|1991|p=8|ps=: 'the Gospel is usually dated between AD 65 and 75.'}} In its account of the crucifixion, on the eve of [[Passover]], it says that after Jesus was crucified at nine in the morning, darkness fell over all the land, or all the world ({{lang-grc-gre|<U+03B3><U+1FC6><U+03BD>|g<U+0113>n}} can mean either) from around noon ("the sixth hour") until 3 o'clock ("the ninth hour").<ref>{{bibleref2|Mark|15:33|NRSV}}</ref> It adds, immediately after the death of Jesus, that 'the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom'.<ref>{{bibleref2|Mark|15:38|NRSV}}</ref>

The [[Gospel of Matthew]], written around the year 85 or 90, and using Mark as a source,{{sfnp|Harrington|1991|p=8}} has an almost identical wording: 'From noon on, darkness came over the whole land [''or'', earth] until three in the afternoon.'<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:45|NRSV}}</ref> The author adds some dramatic details, including an earthquake and the raising of the dead, which were stock motifs from Jewish apocalyptic literature:{{sfnp|Yieh|2004|p=65}}{{sfnp|Funk|1998|pp=129<U+2013>270|ps=, "Matthew".}} 'The earth shook, and the rocks were split. The tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.' <ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:51-54|NRSV}}</ref>

The [[Gospel of Luke]], written around the year 90 and also using Mark as a source,{{sfnp|Davies|2004|p=xii}} has none of the details added in the Matthew version, moves the tearing of the temple veil to before the death of Jesus{{sfnp|Evans|2011|p=308}} and includes an explanation that the sun was darkened,{{sfnp|Henige|2005|p=150}}{{sfnp|Funk|1998|pp=267<U+2013>364|ps=, "Luke".}}.

<blockquote>It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land [''or'', earth] until three in the afternoon, while the sun<U+2019>s light failed [''or'', the sun was eclipsed]; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.<ref>{{bibleref2|Luke|23:44-45|NRSV}}</ref></blockquote>

The majority of manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke have the phrase 'the sun was darkened', but the earliest manuscripts say 'the sun<U+2019>s light failed', appearing to explain what happened as an eclipse.{{sfnp|Loader|2002|p=356}} This earlier version is likely to have been the original one, amended by later scribes to correct what they assumed was an error, since they knew that an eclipse was impossible during Passover.<ref>[http://bible.org/article/errors-greek-text-behind-modern-translations-cases-matthew-17-10-and-luke-2345 Errors in the Greek Text Behind Modern Translations? The Cases of Matthew 1:7, 10 and Luke 23:45]</ref> One early Christian commentator even suggested that the text had been deliberately corrupted 
by opponents of the Church to make it easier to attack.{{sfnp|Allison|2005|p=89}}

The account given in the [[Gospel of John]] is different: it takes place on the day of Passover,{{sfnp|Barclay|2001| p=340}} the crucifixion does not take place until after noon, and there is no mention of darkness, the tearing of the veil, or the raising of the dead.{{sfnp|Broadhead|1994|p=196}}

==Later versions==

===Apocryphal writers===
A number of accounts in [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal literature]] build on the synoptic accounts. In the ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', from the second century, as one writer puts it, "accompanying miracles become more fabulous and the apocalyptic portents are more vivid".{{sfnp|Foster|2009|p=97}} In this version the darkness which covers the whole of Judaea leads people to go about with lamps believing it to be night.{{sfnp|Roberts|Donaldson|Coxe|1896|loc=Volume IX, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf09.iii.i.html "The Gospel of Peter"] 5:15, p. 4}} The fourth century ''[[Gospel of Nicodemus]]'' describes how Pilate and his wife are disturbed by a report of what had happened, and the Judeans he has summoned tell him it was an ordinary solar eclipse.{{sfnp|Barnstone|2005|pp=351, 368, 374, 378<U+2013>379, 419}} Another text from the fourth century, the purported ''Report of Pontius Pilate to Tiberius'' claimed the darkness had started at the sixth hour, covered the whole world and, during the subsequent evening, the full moon resembled blood for the entire night.{{sfnp|Roberts|Donaldson|Coxe|1896|loc=Volume VIII, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf08.vii.xix.html "The Report of Pontius Pilate"], pp. 462<U+2013>463}} In a fifth- or sixth-century text by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], the author claims to have observed a solar eclipse from [[Heliopolis (ancient)|Heliopolis]] at the time of the crucifixion.{{sfnp|Parker|1897|pp=148<U+2013>149, 182<U+2013>183}}

===Ancient historians===
There are no original references to this darkness outside of the New Testament; the only possible contemporary reference may have existed in a work by the chronicler [[Thallus (historian)|Thallus]]. In the ninth century, the Byzantine historian [[George Syncellus]] quoted from the third-century Christian historian [[Sextus Julius Africanus]], who remarked that "Thallos dismisses this darkness as a solar eclipse".<ref name=Africanus>[[George Syncellus]], ''Chronography'', [http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/syncellus/#E1 chapter 391].</ref> It is not known when Thallus lived, and it is unclear whether he himself made any reference to the crucifixion.{{sfnp|Alexander|2005|p=225}} [[Tertullian]], in his ''[[Apologeticus]]'', told the story of the crucifixion darkness and suggested that the evidence must still be held in the Roman archives.{{sfnp|Roberts|Donaldson|Coxe|1896|loc=Volume III, "The Apology" [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.iii.i.html chapter 21], pp. 34<U+2013>36}}

Until the Enlightenment era, the crucifixion darkness story was often used by Christian apologists, because they believed it was a rare example of the biblical account being supported by non-Christian sources. When the pagan critic [[Celsus]] claimed that Jesus could hardly be a God because he had performed no great deeds,  the third-century Christian commentator [[Origen]] responded, in ''[[Against Celsus]]'', by recounting the darkness, earthquake and opening of tombs. As proof that the incident had happened, he referred to a description by [[Phlegon of Tralles]] of an eclipse accompanied by earthquakes during the reign of Tiberius (probably that of 29 CE).{{sfnp|Roberts|Donaldson|Coxe|1896|loc=Volume IV, "Contra Celsum", [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.iii.i.html Book II, chapter 23] p. 441}}

In his ''Commentary on Matthew'', however, Origen offered a different approach. Answering criticisms that there was no mention of this incident in any of the many non-Christian sources, he insisted that it was local to Palestine, and therefore would have gone unnoticed outside. To suggestions it was merely an eclipse, Origen pointed out that the crucifixion took place at Passover, and so an eclipse was impossible. He suggested other explanations instead, such as heavy clouds, drawing only on the accounts given in Matthew and Mark, which make no mention of the sun.{{sfnp|Allison|2005|pp=88<U+2013>89}}

==Explanations==

===Miracle===
Because it was known in ancient and medieval times that a solar eclipse could not take place during Passover (solar eclipses require a [[new moon]] while Passover only takes place during a [[full moon]]) it was considered a miraculous sign rather than a naturally occurring event.{{sfnp|Chambers|1899|pp=129<U+2013>130}} The astronomer [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]] wrote, in his [[De sphaera mundi|The Sphere of the World]], "the eclipse was not natural, but, rather, miraculous and contrary to nature".{{sfnp|Bartlett|2008|pp=68<U+2013>69}} Modern writers who regard this as a miraculous event tend either to see it as operating through a natural phenomenon - such as volcanic dust or heavy cloud cover - or avoid explanation completely.{{sfnp|Allison|2005|pp=68<U+2013>69}}

===Naturalistic explanations===
[[File:Solar eclipse 1999 4 NR.jpg|thumbnail|right|Some commentators suggested the darkness was an eclipse.]]
The Gospel of Luke account appears to describe the event as an eclipse, and some non-Christian writers appear to have dismissed it in these terms. However, the biblical details do not accord with an eclips: a solar eclipse could not have occurred on or near the Passover, when Jesus was crucified, and would have been too brief to account for three hours of darkness.  The  maximum possible duration of a total solar eclipse is seven minutes and 31.1 seconds.{{sfnp|Meeus|2003}} A total eclipse on 24 November 29 CE  was visible slightly north of Jerusalem at 11:05 AM.{{sfn|Espenak|loc="Total Solar Eclipse of 0029 Nov 24"}} The period of totality in Nazareth and Galilee was one minute and forty-nine seconds, and the level of darkness would have been unnoticeable for people outdoors.{{sfnp|Kidger|1999|pp=68<U+2013>72}}

In 1983, [[Colin Humphreys]] and W. G. Waddington, who had used astronomical methods to calculate the crucifixion date  crucifixion as 3 April 33,{{sfnp|Humphreys|Waddington|1983}} argued that the darkness could be accounted for by a partial ''lunar'' eclipse that had taken place on that day.{{sfnp|Humphreys|Waddington|1985}} Astronomer [[Bradley E. Schaefer]], on the other hand, pointed out that the eclipse would not have been visible during daylight hours.{{sfnp|Schaefer|1990}}{{sfnp|Schaefer|1991}} Humphreys and Waddington speculated that the reference in the Luke Gospel to a solar eclipse must have been the result of a scribe wrongly amending the text, a claim historian [[David Henige]] describes as 'indefensible'.{{sfnp|Henige|2005|p=150}}

Some writers have explained the crucifixion darkness in terms of sunstorms, heavy cloud cover or the aftermath of a volcanic eruption.{{sfnp|Brown|1994|p=1040}} Another possible natural explanation is a [[khamsin]] dust storm that tends to occur from March to May.{{sfnp|Humphreys|2011|p=84}}

===Literary creation===
A common view in modern scholarship is that the account in the synoptic gospels is a literary creation of the gospel writers, intended to heighten the importance of what they saw as a theologically significant event. [[Burton Mack]] describes it as a fabrication by the author of the Gospel of Mark,{{sfnp|Mack|1988|p=296|ps=, 'This is the earliest account there is about the crucifixion of Jesus. It is a Markan fabrication'}} while [[W. D. Davies]] and [[Dale Allison]] conclude "It is probable that, without any factual basis, darkness was added in order to wrap the cross in a rich symbol and/or assimilate Jesus to other worthies".{{sfnp|Davies|Allison|1997|p=623}}

The image of darkness over the land would have been understood by ancient readers as a cosmic sign, a typical element in the description of the death of kings and other major figures by writers such as [[Philo]], [[Dio Cassius]], [[Virgil]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Josephus]].{{sfnp|Garland|1999|p=264}} [[G<U+00E9>za Vermes]] describes the darkness account as "part of the Jewish eschatological imagery of the day of the Lord. It is to be treated as a literary rather than historical phenomenon notwithstanding naive scientists and over-eager television documentary makers, tempted to interpret the account as a datable eclipse of the sun. They would be barking up the wrong tree".{{sfnp|Vermes|2005| pp=108<U+2013>109}}

==Interpretations==
This sequence plays an important part in the gospel's literary narrative. The author has been described as operating here "at the peak of his rhetorical and theological powers". One suggestion is that the darkness is a deliberate inversion of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]],{{sfnp|Black|2005|p=42}} while the earlier discourse of Jesus, about a future tribulation, {{bibleref2|Mark|13:24|NRSV}} which speaks of the sun being darkened, can be seen as a foreshadowing of this scene.{{sfnp|Healy|2008|p=319}} Striking details such as the darkening of the sky and the tearing of the temple veil may be a way of focusing the reader away from the shame and humiliation  of the crucifixion; one professor of biblical theology concluded, "it is clear that Jesus is not a humiliated criminal but a man of great significance. His death is therefore not a sign of his weakness but of his power."{{sfnp|Winn|2008|p=133}}

Another approach has been to consider the theological meaning of the event. Some authors have interpreted the darkness as a period of mourning by the cosmos itself at the death of Jesus.{{sfnp|Donahue|2002|pp=451<U+2013>452}} Others have seen it as a sign of God's judgement on the Jewish people, sometimes connecting it with the destruction of the city of Jerusalem in the year 70; or as symbolising shame, fear or the mental suffering of Jesus.{{sfnp|Allison|2005|pp=97<U+2013>102}}

Many writers have adopted an [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] approach, looking at earlier texts from which the author of the Mark Gospel has probably drawn. In particular, parallels have often been noted between the darkness and the prediction in the [[Book of Amos]] of an earthquake in the reign of King [[Uzziah of Judah]]: "On that day, says the Lord God, I will make the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in broad daylight" ({{bibleref2|Amos|8:8-9|NRSV}}). Particularly in connection with this reference, read as a prophecy of the future, the darkness can be seen as portending the [[end times]].{{sfnp|Allison|2005|pp=100<U+2013>101}}

Another likely literary source is {{Bibleverse-lb||Exodus|10:22|HE}}, in which Egypt is covered by darkness for three days. It has been suggested that the author of the Matthew Gospel changed the Marcan text slightly to more closely match this source.{{sfnp|Allison|2005|pp=182<U+2013>83}} Commentators have also drawn comparisons with {{Bibleverse-lb||Genesis|1:2|HE}}, {{Bibleverse-lb||Jeremiah|15:9|HE}} and {{Bibleverse-lb||Zechariah|14:6-7|HE}}.{{sfnp|Allison|2005|pp=83<U+2013>84}}
