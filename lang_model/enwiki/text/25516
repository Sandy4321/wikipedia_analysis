'''Newton's Parakeet''' or the '''Rodrigues Parakeet''' (''Psittacula exsul'') is an extinct species of [[parrot]] that was [[Endemism in birds|endemic]] to the [[Mascarene]] island of [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]] in the western [[Indian Ocean]]. The [[Alexandrine Parakeet]] of the same [[genus]] is a close relative and probable ancestor. Several of its features diverged from related species, indicating long-term isolation on Rodrigues and subsequent adaptation.

Around {{convert|40|cm|in}} long, Newton's Parakeet was roughly the size of a [[Rose-ringed Parakeet]]. Its plumage was mostly greyish or [[slate blue]] in colour, which is unusual in ''[[Psittacula]]'', a genus containing mostly green species. The male had stronger colours than the female and possessed a reddish instead of black beak, but details of a mature male's appearance are uncertain; only one male specimen is known, and it is believed to be immature. Mature males might have possessed red patches on the wing like the Alexandrine Parakeet. Both sexes had a black collar running from the chin to the [[nape]], but this was clearer in the male. The legs were grey and the iris yellow. 17th-century accounts indicate that some members of the species were green, which would suggest that there were both blue and green [[colour morphs]], but there is no definitive explanation for these reports. Little is known about its behaviour in life, but it may have fed on the nuts of the [[Cassine orientale|bois d<U+2019>olive]] tree, along with leaves. It was very tame, and was able to mimic speech.

Newton's Parakeet was first written about by the French [[Huguenot]] [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Leguat]] in 1708, and was only mentioned a few times by other writers afterwards. The specific name "''exsul''" is a reference to Leguat, who was exiled from France. Only two life drawings exist, both of a single specimen held in captivity in the 1770s. The first specimen known to science, a female, became the [[holotype]] when the species was described in 1872. A male was collected in 1874, and these two specimens are the only ones that exist today. It became scarce due to deforestation and perhaps hunting, but it is thought that it was finally wiped out by a series of [[cyclones]] and storms that hit Rodrigues in the late 19th century. There was unfounded speculation about the possible survival of the species as late as 1967.

Newton's Parakeet was first recorded by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Leguat]] in his 1708 memoir, ''A New Voyage to the East Indies''. Leguat was the leader of a group of nine [[French Huguenot]] refugees who colonised [[Rodrigues]] between 1691 and 1693 after they were [[marooned]] there.<ref>{{cite book | last= Leguat | first= F. | editor= [[Samuel Pasfield Oliver]] | year= 1891 | title= The voyage of Fran<U+00E7>ois Leguat of Bresse, to Rodriguez, Mauritius, Java, and the Cape of Good Hope | volume= 2 | publisher= Hakluyt Society | location= London }}</ref> Subsequent accounts are by Julien Tafforet, who was also marooned on the island in 1726, and then by the French mathematician [[Alexandre Pingr<U+00E9>]], who travelled to Rodrigues to view the [[1761 transit of Venus]].<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>

The first specimen known to science was a female collected by George Jenner, then the [[magistrate]] of Rodrigues, in 1871. The specimen was preserved in alcohol and given to [[Edward Newton]], a colonial administrator in [[Mauritius]], who sent it to his brother, the British ornithologist [[Alfred Newton]]. Alfred Newton scientifically described the bird in 1872 and gave it the [[scientific name]] ''Palaeornis exsul''. "Exsul" ("exiled") refers to Fran<U+00E7>ois Leguat, in that he was exiled from France when he gave the first description of the bird. Newton had tried to find a more descriptive name, perhaps based on colouration, but found it difficult. He refrained from publishing a figure of the female in his original description, though the journal ''[[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]]'' had offered him the space. He instead wanted to wait until a male specimen could be procured, since he imagined it would be more attractive.<ref name=Newton1872>{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1474-919X.1872.tb05858.x}}</ref> The female, which is the [[holotype specimen]] of the species, is housed in the [[Cambridge University Museum]] as specimen UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/I.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>

Alfred Newton requested further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 he finally published a plate of the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and Alfred Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Mr. Slater, had seen a live Newton's Parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a gun at the time.<ref name="Palaeornis">{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1474-919X.1875.tb05978.x}}</ref> On 14 August 1874, a Mr. Vandorous shot a male specimen.

Caldwell.<ref name="Psittaci"/> This is the [[paratype]] of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>

Edward Newton noted that he had expected the male would be adorned with a red patch on the wing, but that the absence of this indicated it was immature. He still found it more beautiful than the female.<ref name="Psittaci">{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1474-919X.1876.tb06925.x}}</ref> These two specimens are the only preserved individuals of the species.<ref name="Rothschild">{{Cite book

===Evolution===
[[File:P. exsul.jpg|thumb|Sternum and mandible extracted from the female specimen]]
The [[Alexandrine Parakeet]] (''Psittacula eupatria'') has been proposed as the [[founder population]] for all ''Psittacula'' species on Indian Ocean islands during southward colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Subfossil remains of Newton's Parakeet show that it differed from other Mascarene ''Psittacula'' species in some [[osteological]] features, but also had similarities, such as a reduced sternum, which suggests a close relationship. Skeletal features indicate an especially close relationship with the Alexandrine Parakeet, but the many [[derived features]] of Newton's Parakeet indicates it had long been isolated on Rodrigues.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> The [[Rose-ringed Parakeet]] (''Psittacula krameri'') also appears to be closely related.<ref name="Extinct Birds">{{cite book

Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the [[Dodo]], are descended from South Asian ancestors, and the English palaeontologist [[Julian Hume]] has proposed that this may also be the case for all parrots there. Sea levels were lower during the [[Pleistocene]], so it was possible for species to colonise some of these less isolated islands.<ref name="Lost Land"/> Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared common features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] bones, and robust leg bones. Hume has suggested that they have a common origin in the [[Evolutionary radiation|radiation]] of the [[Psittaculini]] [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]], members of which are known as Psittaculines, basing his theory on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features and the fact that ''Psittacula'' parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots">{{Cite journal|last=Hume|first=J.

==Description==
[[File:Psittacula exsul (extinct) by J.G. Keulemans.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Keulemans' plate from [[Walter Rothschild]]'s 1907 book ''[[Extinct Birds (Rothschild book)|Extinct Birds]]'']]
Newton's Parakeet was about 40&nbsp;cm (16&nbsp;in) long - roughly the size of the Rose-ringed Parakeet.<ref name="Lost Land"/> The wing of the male specimen was 198&nbsp;mm (7.7&nbsp;in), the tail 206&nbsp;mm (8.11&nbsp;in), the [[culmen (bird)|culmen]] 25&nbsp;mm (0.9&nbsp;in), and the [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] was 22&nbsp;mm (0.8&nbsp;in). The wing of the female specimen was 191&nbsp;mm (7.5&nbsp;in), the tail 210&nbsp;mm (8.2&nbsp;in), the culmen 24&nbsp;mm (0.9&nbsp;in), and the tarsus was 22&nbsp;mm (0.8&nbsp;in). The male specimen was greyish blue (also described as "[[slatey]] blue") tinged with green, and darker above. The head was bluer, with a dark line running from the eye to the [[cere]]. It had a broad black collar running from the chin to the [[nape]], where it became gradually narrower. The underside of the tail was greyish, the upper beak was dark reddish brown, and the mandible was black. The legs were grey and the iris yellow. The female was similar, but had a greyer head and a black beak. The black collar was not so prominent as that of the male, and did not extend to the back of the neck.<ref name = Fuller/> The general appearance of Newton's Parakeet was similar to the extant ''Psittacula'' species, including the black collar, but the bluish grey colouration set it apart from other members of its genus, which are mostly green.<ref name = Fuller>{{Cite book |last = Fuller |first = E. |title = Extinct Birds |pages = 225<U+2013>227  | year = 2000| publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford |isbn = 0-670-81787-2}}</ref>
[[File:Psittacula exsul Jossigny.jpg|thumb|Jossigny's other 1770s life drawing]]
[[Philibert Commerson]] received a live specimen on Mauritius in the 1770s and described it as "greyish blue". Jossigny made two illustrations of this specimen, the only known depictions of Newton's Parakeet in life, unpublished until 2007.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> Though both existing specimens are blue, some early accounts from Rodrigues have caused confusion over the colouration of the plumage.<ref name = Fuller/> One of these is Leguat's following statement:
{{Quotation|There are abundance of green and blew Parrets, they are of a midling and equal bigness; when they are young, their Flesh is as good as young Pigeons.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>}}
If the green parrots Leguat referred to were not the [[Rodrigues Parrot]] (''Necropsittacus rodericanus''), they may perhaps have been a green [[colour morph]] of Newton's Parakeet, as Julian Hume has suggested. As Alfred Newton observed in his original description, some feathers of the female specimen display both blue and green tinges, depending on the light. This may explain some of the discrepancies.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> The green parrots mentioned could also instead have been storm-blown members of ''Psittacula'' species from other islands, that survived on Rodrigues for a short time.<ref name = Fuller/> The two existing specimens were originally preserved in alcohol, but though this can discolour specimens, it is not probable that it could turn green to blue.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>
[[File:Alexanderine Parakeet.jpg|thumb|upright|The related [[Alexandrine Parakeet]] has red shoulder patches, as seen in this adult male]] 
Julien Tafforet also described what appears to be green Newton's Parakeets in his 1726 ''Relation de l'<U+00CE>le Rodrigue'', but the issue of colouration was further complicated:
{{Quotation|The parrots are of three kinds, and in quantity&nbsp;... The second species [mature male Newton's Parakeet?] is slightly smaller and more beautiful, because they have their plumage green like the preceding [Rodrigues Parrot], a little more blue, and above the wings a little red as well as their beak. The third species [Newton's Parakeet] is small and altogether green, and the beak black.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>}}
It has been proposed that the last two types mentioned were male and female Newton's Parakeets, and that the differences between them were due to [[sexual dimorphism]].<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1017/CBO9780511735769.003}}</ref> Alexandre Pingr<U+00E9> also mentioned green birds, perhaps with some red colours, but his account is partially unintelligible and therefore ambiguous. A red shoulder patch is also present on the related Alexandrine Parakeet.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> None of the existing Newton's Parakeet specimens have red patches. The single-known male specimen may have been immature, judged on the colour of its beak, and this may also explain the absence of the red patch.<ref name = Fuller/> When ''Psittacula'' are bred by [[aviculturalists]], blue is easily produced from green; the production of blue may suppress red colouration, so blue morphs may have lacked the red patch.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>

==Behaviour and ecology==
[[File:Rodrigues.jpg|thumb|left|Leguat's map of pristine Rodrigues; his settlement can be seen to the northeast|alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with Solitaires]]
Almost nothing is known about the behaviour of Newton's Parakeet, but it is probable that it was similar to that of other members of its genus. Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island mainly ate the nuts of the bois d<U+2019>olive tree (''[[Cassine orientale]]'').<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> It may have fed on leaves as the related [[Mauritius Parakeet]] (''Psittacula echo'') does. The fact that Newton's Parakeet survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues Parrot.<ref name="Lost Land"/>

Leguat and his men were hesitant to hunt the parrots because they were so tame and easy to catch.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> Leguat's group took a parrot as a pet and were able to teach it to speak:
{{Quotation|Hunting and Fishing were so easie to us, that it took away from the Pleasure. We often delighted ourselves in teaching the Parrots to speak, there being vast numbers of them. We carried one to Maurice Isle [Mauritius], which talk<U+2019>d French and Flemish.<ref name="Lost Land"/>}}
As the kind of parrot mentioned here by Leguat is not specified, some sources attribute it to Newton's Parakeet, and others to the Rodrigues Parrot.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/><ref name = Fuller/>

Many other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem remains heavily 
damaged. Forests covered the entire island before humans arrived, but very little forestation can be seen today. Newton's Parakeet lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the [[Rodrigues Solitaire]], the Rodrigues Parrot, the [[Rodrigues Rail]], the [[Rodrigues Starling]], the [[Rodrigues Owl]], the [[Rodrigues Night Heron]], and the [[Rodrigues Pigeon]]. Extinct reptiles include the [[domed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], the [[saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], and the [[Rodrigues day gecko]].<ref name="Lost Land"/>

==Extinction==
[[File:Vadaspark Madarak 01.jpg|thumb|Statues of Newton's Parakeet and the likewise extinct [[Broad-billed Parrot]] of Mauritius, in Hungary]] 
Of the roughly eight parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the Mauritius Parakeet has survived. The others were likely all made extinct by a combination of excessive hunting and [[deforestation]].<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> Leguat stated that Newton's Parakeet was abundant during his stay. It was still common when Tafforet visited in 1726, but when Alexandre Pingr<U+00E9> mentioned it in 1761, he noted that the bird had become scarce. It was still present on southern islets off Rodrigues (Isle Gombrani), along with the Rodrigues Parrot. After this point, much of Rodrigues was severely deforested and used for [[livestock]].<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> According to early accounts praising its flavour, it appears Newton's Parakeet was commonly eaten by visitors.<ref name="Lost Land"/> Several individuals would likely be needed to provide a single meal, owing to the bird's small size.<ref name = Fuller/> Pingr<U+00E9> stated: 
{{Quotation|The perruche [Newton's Parakeet] seemed to me much more delicate [than the flying-fox]. I would not have missed any game from France if this one had been commoner in Rodrigues; but it begins to become rare. There are even fewer perroquets [Rodrigues Parrots], although there were once a big enough quantity according to Fran<U+00E7>ois Leguat; indeed a little islet south of Rodrigues still retains the name Isle of Parrots [Isle Pierrot].<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>}}

According to government surveyor Thomas Corby, Newton's Parakeet may still have been fairly common in 1843. Henry H. Slater reported that he saw a single specimen in south western Rodrigues during his three-month stay to observe the [[1874 Transit of Venus]], and assistant colonial secretary William James Caldwell saw several specimens in 1875 during his own three-month visit. The male that he received in 1875 and gave to Newton is the last recorded member of the species. A series of [[cyclones]] struck the following year and may have devastated the remaining population.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> Further severe storms hit in 1878 and 1886, and since few forested areas were left by this time, there was little cover to protect any remaining birds. The male could therefore have been the last of the species alive.<ref name="Lost Land"/>

There were unfounded rumours of its continued existence until the beginning of the 20th century.<ref name="Lost Land"/> In 1967 [[James Greenway]] stated that an extremely small population might still survive on small offshore islets, since this is often the last refuge of endangered birds.<ref name =Greenway>{{cite book
