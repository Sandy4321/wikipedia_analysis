The '''Australian contribution to the Battle of Normandy''' involved hundreds of military personnel operating under British command. It has been estimated that as many as 3,000 Australian military personnel took part in the [[Normandy landings]] on 6&nbsp;June 1944, including between 2,000 and 2,500 [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) airmen in Australian and British [[Royal Air Force]] units, 500 members of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] serving in [[Royal Navy]] vessels and about a dozen [[Australian Army]] officers attached to [[British Army]] units. Australians also took part in the subsequent [[Battle of Normandy]] during the northern summer of 1944. While these operations involved all the RAAF units stationed in the UK, Australian personnel only made up a small share of the Allied force.

==Background==
In 1944 Australia's war effort was focused on the [[Pacific War]], and most elements of the military were in Australia and the islands to its north.<ref name="Stanley_2004">Stanley (2004)</ref> Nevertheless, substantial numbers of RAAF personnel were stationed in the United Kingdom and took part in operations against Germany. As of April 1944, about 1,500 Australians were posted to RAF units. In addition, ten RAAF squadrons were stationed in the UK. These included one regular RAAF unit, [[No. 10 Squadron RAAF|No. 10 Squadron]], and nine [[Article XV squadrons]] manned by graduates of the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. While these Article XV squadrons were nominally Australian, most included a substantial proportion of personnel from Britain and other Commonwealth countries.<ref name="Long_377">Long (1973), p. 377</ref>

All ten RAAF squadrons in the UK participated in the invasion of Europe. Three <!-- or just 456 Sqn? --> of the RAAF squadrons in the UK formed part of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|Second Tactical Air Force]] (2TAF) which was to provide direct support to the Allied armies during the campaign in Europe. These units were [[No. 453 Squadron RAAF|No. 453 Squadron]], which was equipped with [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters, as well as [[No. 456 Squadron RAAF|No. 456]] and [[No. 464 Squadron RAAF|No. 464 Squadrons]] which operated with [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] aircraft. In addition, [[No. 460 Squadron RAAF|No. 460 Squadron]], [[No. 463 Squadron RAAF|No. 463 Squadron]], [[No. 466 Squadron RAAF|No. 466 Squadron]] and [[No. 467 Squadron RAAF|No. 467 Squadron]]s operated [[heavy bomber]]s as part of [[RAF Bomber Command]]. While the heavy bomber squadrons were mainly tasked with participating in the strategic bombing of Germany, Bomber Command's units played an important role in attacking targets in France ahead of the invasion, and later provided direct support for the ground troops during major offensives.<ref name="Stanley_1987_149">Stanley (1987), p. 147</ref> Three other RAAF squadrons in the UK would also support operations in Normandy as part of [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]]; No. 10 Squadron and [[No. 461 Squadron RAAF|No. 461 Squadrons]] were equipped with [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] flying boats and flew patrols of the waters around the UK and [[No. 455 Squadron RAAF|No. 455 Squadron]] operated against German shipping using [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]] strike aircraft.<ref name="APDC_2004_2">Air Power Development Centre (2004), p. 2</ref>

In addition to the RAAF personnel operating as part the RAF in the UK, hundreds of RAN personnel were serving with the Royal Navy (RN) at the time of the Battle of Normandy. No Australian warships took part in the operation, however. Most of the Australian officers serving with the RN were members of the [[Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve]] (RANVR).<ref name="Gill_445">Gill (1968), p. 445</ref> About twelve Australian Army officers were also attached to British Army units which took part in the invasion; these officers had been posted to the UK to gain experience in [[amphibious warfare]] ahead of planned Australian landings in the Pacific.<ref name=Stanley_2004 />

During early 1944 the Allies conducted a large scale air offensive against German positions and transport infrastructure in France in preparation for the D-Day landings at Normandy on 6 June. The RAAF squadrons in the UK, and Australians posted to RAF units, participated in these attacks. In addition, Australian fighter pilots, including the [[night fighter]]s of No. 456 Squadron, flew patrols over the ports on the south coast of England where the invasion fleet was being gathered in an effort to protect them from German air attack.<ref>Long (1973), pp. 377<U+2013>378</ref> During this period Coastal Command stepped up its efforts to sink German submarines which were operating near France, and succeeded in destroying six submarines within eleven days during May; Australian aircrew contributed to three of these sinkings.<ref name="Long_379">Long (1973), p. 379</ref>

==Australians at D-Day==
On the night of 5/6&nbsp;June, and in the early hours of 6&nbsp;June, Bomber Command conducted precision attacks on ten German [[coastal artillery]] batteries near the beaches at which Allied troops were to land. Each battery was targeted by approximately 100 heavy bombers, and all four Australian heavy bomber squadrons took part in the operation. No. 460 Squadron dispatched 26 aircraft which were evenly split between attacking the batteries at Fontenay-Crisbecq and St Martin de Varreville. No. 466 Squadron provided 13 aircraft to the raid on batteries at Merville-Franceville Maisy, 14 aircraft from No. 463 Squadron struck Pointe du Hoe and a further 14 No. 467 Squadron bombers attacked batteries at [[Ouistreham]].<ref name="Herington_120">Herington (1963), p. 120</ref> Many RAAF aircrew posted to British squadrons also participated in this attack, and overall 14.8 percent of the 1,136 Bomber Command aircraft involved in the raid were either part of RAAF squadrons or were flown by Australians.<ref name="Stephens_2006_90">Stephens (2006), p. 90</ref><ref>Herrington (1963), pp. 120<U+2013>122</ref>

Australians posted to RAF units also landed [[paratrooper]]s in Normandy and took part in other supporting operations. On the night of 5/6 June several Australian aircrew served in heavy bombers which dropped "Window" [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]] to simulate convoys headed for the [[Pas de Calais]] region of France in an attempt to deceive the Germans of the Allies true intentions. Other Australians served in aircraft which dropped dummy paratroopers and jammed German [[radar]]. One Australian pilot posted to [[No. 139 Squadron RAF]] took part in the 'intruder' bombing raids on western Germany and the low countries which sought to divert German aircraft away from Normandy.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 116<U+2013>117</ref> Australian aircrew also served aboard the transport aircraft of [[No. 38 Group RAF]] and [[No. 46 Group RAF]] which flew the British [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th Airborne Division]] from the UK to Normandy on the night of 5/6&nbsp;June. About 14 percent of the transport aircraft in No. 38 Group were piloted by Australians, though the proportion of Australians in No. 46 Group was much lower. There were no completely Australian crews in either group.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 118<U+2013>119</ref>

Australian aircrew supported the fighting on 6 June. No. 453 Squadron was one of the 171 Allied squadrons allocated to defend the invasion fleet and beachhead from German aircraft and provide close air support to the Allied troops during daylight hours, and No. 456 Squadron formed part of the force which provided air defence at night. In addition, about 200 Australian pilots were spread across the dozens of RAF fighter and fighter-bomber units which supported the landings.<ref name="Herington_123">Herington (1963), p. 123</ref> A small number of Australian aircrew also served in 2TAF's light bomber squadrons which saw combat over France.<ref name="Herington_128">Herington (1963), p. 128</ref> On 6 June No. 453 Squadron was one of 36 Allied squadrons which provided low-altitude air defence for the fleet and landing force. Many of the squadron's pilots flew several sorties, though they did not encounter any German aircraft.<ref name="Herington_124">Herington (1963), p. 124</ref> The three Australian squadrons assigned to Coastal Command flew only a small number of sorties on 6&nbsp;June as few German [[submarine]]s or torpedo boats put to sea that day.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 128<U+2013>129</ref>

In addition to the RAAF contribution to D Day, about 500 Australian served on board RN ships involved in the operation. While most formed part of the crew of RN warships, several Australian officers commanded flotillas of landing craft and other Australians commanded individual landing craft.<ref name=Stanley_2004 /> Some of the warships with Australian crew members which supported the landings were {{HMS|Ajax|22|6}} (which had three RANVR officers on board), {{HMS|Ashanti|F51|2}}, {{HMS|Enterprise|D52|2}}, {{HMS|Eskimo |F75|2}}, {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|2}}, {{HMS|Mackay|D70|2}} and {{HMS|Scylla|98|2}}.<ref name=Gill_445 />

By the end of D-Day, the Allied forces had made a successful landing in Normandy and were poised to continue the advance. The total number of Australians killed on 6&nbsp;June was 14, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two were members of the RAN.<ref name=Stanley_2004 />

==Subsequent fighting==
The fighting in Normandy continued until August 1944, when the Allies made a successful breakout and rapidly liberated most of France and reached the German border. Australian airmen and naval personnel supported this campaign.<ref name=Stanley_2004 />

===June===
Australian airmen were involved in Allied efforts to delay German reinforcements from reaching Normandy. On the night of 6/7 June 20 Mosquitos from No. 464 Squadron were dispatched to attack German road convoys and trains in northern France.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 127<U+2013>128</ref> The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons also participated in raids on French towns on this night; while those conducted by No. 463, No. 466 and No. 467 Squadrons mainly targeted railway facilities in the towns, No. 460 Squadron formed part of an attack on [[Vire]] which sought to destroy the town in order to prevent the Germans from using the roads which passed through it.<ref name="Herington_131">Herington (1963), p. 131</ref> Following these raids, Bomber Command continued to target railway infrastructure in France in an attempt to disrupt the movement of German reinforcements to Normandy.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 131<U+2013>132</ref> The command operated intensively during the week after the invasion, and some Australian aircrew flew raids on consecutive nights during this period.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 133<U+2013>134</ref> Bomber Command made a further 16 raids against railway facilities in France between 13 and 30 June, of which six involved RAAF squadrons.<ref>Herington (1963), p. 158</ref> No. 464 Squadron also operated against German vehicles travelling at night and bombed railway yards, and flew 75 sorties between the nights of 7/8 and 12/13 June.<ref name="Herington_131">Herington (1963), p. 143</ref> Overall, the squadron conducted attacks on 13 nights during June.<ref>Herington (1963), p. 162</ref>

Australians also contributed to the defence of the Allied beachhead against German air and naval attacks. No. 453 Squadron and the Australian fighter pilots in other units continued to fly patrols over the beachhead in the week after D-Day, but only rarely encountered German aircraft.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 137<U+2013>138</ref> From 11 June the squadron's aircraft frequently operated from airfields which had been built at Normandy, and on the 25th of the month it moved from the UK to Advanced Landing Ground B11 within the beachhead.<ref name="RAAF_HS_fighters_128">RAAF Historical Section (1995), ''Volume 2 Fighter Units'', p. 128</ref> By late June No. 453 Squadron and the other RAF Spitfire units were regularly attacking German positions in Normandy as well as providing air defence for the Allied forces in the area.<ref>Herington (1963), p. 164</ref> A small number of Australians posted to RAF squadrons equipped with [[Hawker Typhoon]] fighter-bombers also attacked German vehicles and positions in direct support of the Allied ground troops.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 165<U+2013>166</ref> No. 456 Squadron, which was one of four night fighter squadrons assigned to protect the beachhead, frequently met German aircraft and shot down twelve of them in the week after the landing.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 138<U+2013>139</ref><ref name="Long_380">Long (1973), p. 380</ref>

Following the invasion, German submarines and surface warships were sortied to attack the Allied fleet, and the Australian members of Coastal Command participated in attacks on these vessels. While the Sunderlands of No. 10 and No. 461 Squadrons attacked a number of submarines and [[Schnellboot|E-boats]] in the week after D-Day, they did not achieve any sinkings. The aircrew of two of the British [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberators]] which sank German submarines during this period included Australian personnel, however, and Australians were on board several of the other British aircraft which flew anti-submarine and anti-shipping patrols. In addition, No. 455 Squadron took part in attacks on E-boats operating near Normandy and German shipping travelling through the English Channel.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 144<U+2013>147</ref> The two Australian flying boat squadrons operated intensively throughout June, but did not sink any German ships or submarines.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 151<U+2013>153</ref> No. 460 Squadron and Australians in other Bomber Command units also took part in heavy bomber raids on E-Boat bases at [[Le Havre]] and [[Boulogne]] on the nights of 14/15 June and 15/16 June respectively.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 154<U+2013>155</ref>

===July and August===
By July the Allied armies were having difficulty advancing against the German forces in Normandy. In an attempt to allow a breakthrough, the Allied air commanders decided to use heavy bombers to attack German positions.<ref name="Long_383">Long (1973), p. 383</ref> The first of these attacks was made by 467 Bomber Command aircraft on 7 July and targeted German forces near [[Caen]], as well as the city itself. The Australian contribution to this raid included 20 [[Avro Lancasters|Lancasters]] from No. 460 Squadron and 14 [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifaxes]] from No. 466 Squadron and aircrew in RAF squadrons. One of No. 460 Squadon's aircraft made a crash landing within the Allied beachhead after being damaged by German anti-aircraft guns, but its crew survived and were evacuated back to the UK. While the attack devastated Caen, the ground troops were only able to capture the northern half of the city when they advanced on 8 July.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 226<U+2013>227</ref> All four Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in a series of attacks on German positions on 18&nbsp;July as part of [[Operation Goodwood]], but this offensive also failed to result in an Allied breakthrough.<ref name=Long_383 /> On 30&nbsp;July No. 463, No. 466 and No. 467 Squadrons contributed aircraft to another major bombardment of German positions near [[Caumont-sur-Orne|Caumont]] ahead of [[Operation Bluecoat]]; overall, 693 heavy bombers were involved in this attack, of which 39 were from the Australian squadrons, but many were unable to drop their bombs due to cloud over the target area.<ref name="Herington_231">Herington (1963), p. 231</ref> All four Australian heavy bomber squadrons were involved in the next major bombardment, which took place on the night of 7/8 August to support [[Operation Totalize]], but many did not drop their bombs as cloud and smoke obscured the target area.<ref name="Herington_232">Herington (1963), p. 232</ref> The four squadrons again attacked German Army positions on 14 August in support of [[Operation Tractable]].<ref name="Herington_233">Herington (1963), p. 233</ref> By this time the Allied armies had successfully broken out of Normandy, and no further heavy bomber attacks were required.<ref name="Herington_234">Herington (1963), p. 234</ref>

Australians also continued to be involved in the Allied air attacks which sought to disrupt the movement of German troops and supplies to Normandy during July and August. As well as supporting the ground forces in Normandy and bombing [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1 flying bomb]] launch facilities in northern France, Bomber Command attacked railway facilities in France during July and August, and at least one Australian squadron participated in 15 of the 25 raids conducted against these targets.<ref name="Herington_235">Herington (1963), p. 235</ref><ref>Long (1973), p. 380<U+2013>382</ref> No.&nbsp;464 Squadron also flew more than 350 sorties during July and 400 in August against transport infrastructure in France and convoys of German vehicles. These operations, which were generally conducted at night, cost the unit three aircraft.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 240<U+2013>241</ref>

No. 453 Squadron operated from Normandy during July and August, and mainly patrolled behind the German front line in search of motor transport to attack. It occasionally encountered German aircraft during this period and shot down several [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Me 109]] and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]] fighters. The squadron flew 727 sorties during July, but lost several of its Spitfires to German anti-aircraft guns. No. 453 Squadron continued to operate against German transport during August, and moved to an airfield near [[Ling<U+00E8>vres]] on the 13th of the month. This airfield was attacked by a German aircraft the next day, resulting in the death of one Australian pilot and another three wounded. The squadron experienced considerable success during the Allied break-out, and claimed the destruction of dozens of German vehicles during August.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 241<U+2013>243</ref> While No. 456 Squadron operated over Normandy in early July, from the 6th of the month it was transferred to defensive duties in the UK as part of efforts to shoot down V-1 flying bombs.<ref name="Herington_249">Herington (1963), p. 249</ref>

The Australian flying boat squadrons assigned to Coastal Command also continued to support the invasion during July and August. On 8&nbsp;July a No. 10 Squadron Sunderland sank the German submarine [[German submarine U-243|''U-243'']] {{convert|130|mi|km}} south-west of [[Brest, France|Brest]].<ref name="Long_384">Long (1973), p. 384</ref> During July No. 10 Squadron flew 56 patrols and No. 461 Squadron conducted 67, most of which were made at night.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 244<U+2013>245</ref> No. 461 Squadron damaged the submarine [[German submarine U-385|''U-385'']] {{convert|150|mi|km}} south of Brest 10 August, and it was sunk the next day by {{HMS|Starling|U66|6}}. On 13 August another No. 461 Squadron Sunderland attacked and sank [[German submarine U-270|''U-270'']]. No. 10 Squadron flew a similar number of patrols to that it had conducted during August, but did not encounter any submarines.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 245<U+2013>246</ref> No. 455 Squadron took part in attacks on German shipping travelling off Holland and in the [[North Sea]] during July and August, but these were not directly related to supporting the invasion.<ref>Herington (1963), pp. 246<U+2013>249</ref>
