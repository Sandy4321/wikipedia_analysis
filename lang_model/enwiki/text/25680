SR&nbsp;409 originates at the ferry dock on Puget Island which serves as the northern end of the Wahkiakum County Ferry. From the dock, the road travels north past the island's interior, before turning northwest to parallel the [[Cathlamet Channel]]. After intersecting Little Island Road, the highway immediately turns onto the [[Julia Butler Hansen Bridge]] spanning over the Cathlamet Channel. Once SR&nbsp;409 exits off the bridge in Cathlamet, it becomes Front Street. Later, after intersecting River Street and Columbia Street, the highway becomes Main Street, the designation used from the intersection point to SR&nbsp;4.<ref name="map"/><ref>{{cite map |title=Official State Highway Map |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/87105CAD-83A9-49A7-80F3-5719637C1E2D/0/FrontMapBig.pdf |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |location=Olympia, Washington |year=2008 |edition=2008-2009 |scale=1:842,000 |series=Official State Highway Maps |cartography=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |section=G2 |accessdate=2008-11-09}}</ref>
