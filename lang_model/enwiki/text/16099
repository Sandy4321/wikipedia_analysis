'''David Arthur Overstreet''' ({{birth date|1958|09|20}} <U+2013> {{death date|1984|06|25}}) was a [[running back]] in the [[Canadian Football League]] and [[National Football League]].

A native of [[Big Sandy, Texas]], Overstreet prepped at [[Big Sandy High School]], where one of his teammates was [[Lovie Smith]]. Big Sandy won three consecutive Class B state championships 1973-75. After scoring 362 points in 1975<U+2014>which is third all-time in Texas high school history behind [[Kenneth Hall (football player)|Ken Hall]] of [[Sugar Land, Texas|Sugar Land]] and [[Robert Strait]] of [[Cuero, Texas|Cuero]]<U+2014>Overstreet played his [[college football]] at the [[University of Oklahoma]].

He was drafted in the [[1981 NFL Draft]] by the [[Miami Dolphins]] in the first round, 13th pick overall. A contract dispute with the Dolphins led him to sign with the [[Montreal Alouettes]], who, under the ownership of [[Nelson Skalbania]], tried to buy a big money winning team.

His first season ([[1981 CFL season|1981]]) was successful, as he rushed for 952 yards and was the Alouettes [[rookie]] of the year. His second season, with the newly renamed and dreadful [[Montreal Concordes]], was plagued by injury, and he only gained 190 yards rushing.

He returned to the Dolphins in 1983, and showed much promise, rushing for 392 yards in 14 games with a 4.6 yards per carry average.

Overstreet was killed in a car accident in June 1984. He was driving northbound in his 1980 Mercedes on [[Texas State Highway 155]], when his car swerved off the road about 10 miles northeast of [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]] into gasoline pumps at a service station and exploded.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/25/obituaries/david-overstreet-killed-in-car-crash.html |title=David Overstreet Killed in Car Crash |date=June 25, 1984 |newspaper=New York Times }}</ref>

He was survived by his son David Overstreet Jr., who played [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] at the [[University of Missouri]] from 2003 to 2006.
