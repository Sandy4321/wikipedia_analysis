'''''Unintended Consequences''''' is a novel by author [[John Ross (author)|John Ross]], first published in 1996 by Accurate Press. The lengthy (863 pages) story chronicles the history of the [[gun culture]], [[gun rights]] and [[gun control]] in the [[United States]] from the early 1900s through the late 1990s. Although clearly a work of [[fiction]], the story is heavily laced with accurate historical information, including real-life figures who play minor supporting roles. The novel also features unusually detailed and intricate facts, figures and explanations of many [[firearm]]s-related topics. The cover has a picture of [[Lady Justice]] being assaulted by an [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] agent.

== Background ==
The story hinges upon the enactment and subsequent [[unintended consequence]]s of several important pieces of U.S. gun control legislation and regulation: the [[National Firearms Act]] of 1934, the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]], the [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] of 1986, the Assault Weapons Importation Ban enacted by Presidential [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] in 1989 and the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]] of 1994. 

Its thesis, as discussed in the ''Author's Note - A Warning and Disclaimer'' in the beginning of the book, pp.&nbsp;9-10,  is that enough bullying by what, rightly or wrongly, is widely perceived as a hostile outside occupation government will inevitably end in revolt if the area involved is large enough and has a separate enough culture and that this revolt will be undefeatable if the rebels use very-low-tech "[[leaderless resistance]]."

== Major characters ==
'''Henry Bowman''' is the principal character, although the story begins in 1906, long before Bowman's birth on January 10, 1953. The story is told primarily from his perspective when he is in his early forties. Bowman grows up in the [[St. Louis, Missouri]] area, where much of the story takes place. He is a trained [[geologist]], a self-taught expert [[marksman]], a [[firearm]]s, [[ammunition]], and [[self-defense]] authority, and a pilot. Bowman lives on a rural acreage near the [[St. Louis, Missouri]] metropolitan area. There is a abandoned stone [[quarry]] on his land which Bowman uses for recreational shooting. Bowman, in the novel, enjoys owning performance automobiles and driving at high rates of speed on interstate highways. In one part of the novel, he races his hot-rodded GMC truck against a rival [[Porsche]], with Bowman winning, driving in excess of 140MPH to win. Bowman also has several [[Identity Theft|forged identities]] that he uses for various purposes in the novel. Bowman is a proficient [[Skydiving|skydiver]].      

'''Walter (Blackout) Bowman''' is Henry's father. A skilled pilot and [[U.S. Navy]] officer, who trained naval aviators during [[World War II]], retiring at the rank of Lieutenant. He represents the studious, responsible and thoughtful side of young Bowman. The author has stated that the elder Bowman is based on his own father.

'''Max Collins''' is Bowman's uncle. He is portrayed as a larger-than life character who is an expert marksman, professional gambler and accomplished ladies' man. He served in the airborne troops of D-Day, and killed a German army officer in combat with his [[sniper rifle]]. In the novel, at a 1960's [[Nevada]] shooting competition, he bets on his nephew Henry's shooting, winning $10,000. He represents the adventurous, spontaneous and aggressive side of Bowman. The author has stated that Collins is based on his own uncle.

'''Irwin Mann''' is a survivor of [[The Holocaust]] and the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], and a key participant in the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. His inclusion in the story permits a study of the use of firearms by average citizens to repel an oppressive government, and connects [[Nazism|Nazi]] gun control measures to U.S. gun control efforts.

'''Ray Johnson''' is a [[New York City, New York|New York]] attorney, originally from Aspen [[Colorado]], who moves to [[Africa]] in 1963 and becomes a big-game safari guide. His return to the U.S. in 1994 serves to illustrate how much U.S. gun owners' freedoms have been eroded, due to legislation and an executive order enacted during his absence.  At the airport, the customs officials attempt to confiscate an English double rifle worth some $40,000 USD, a Belgian [[FN FAL]] semi-automatic rifle, a Smith & Wesson 2" Chief's Special revolver, and his hat which wears a leopard skin hat band. Ray calls his Friend Henry, and Henry calls in a favor with a friend who is a high ranking agent of Customs. Ray is allowed to keep his firearms and enter the United States. 

'''Allen Kane''' is a major machine gun dealer who is Henry's lifelong friend. A major shift in the novel's plot occurs when Henry finds corrupt [[BATFE|ATF]] agents framing Allen. Allen aids and accompanies Henry in much of the novel.

'''Cindy Caswell''' is a victim of [[child abuse|childhood abuse]] and [[organized crime]] who becomes important in the freedom struggle as it develops. In the novel, she is from [[Rolla, Missouri]]. She is abducted by [[mafia]] thugs during a trip to [[Chicago, Illinois]], who force her to become a sex slave for mafia bosses and leaders. After several years, she escapes and meets Henry Bowman at an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting. She assassinates many pro-gun control and big-government politicians and legislators in the novel. The author has been criticized for creating an "adolescent fantasy" with this character. Ten years after writing the novel, Ross met [[Tammy Chapman]], whose life and personality traits bore eerie resemblances to the fictional Cindy Caswell. Ross and Chapman now live together in St. Louis.<ref>[http://www.john-ross.net/cindy.php Author's website]</ref>

== Plot summary ==
The novel's protagonist, Henry Bowman, shows an early proficiency with firearms, practicing whenever he can find the time. Encouraged by his father, he gathers an impressive firearms collection and gains extensive experience in piloting small aircraft. During college, Bowman is robbed, beaten, and sexually assaulted by a rural [[gang]]. The incident has a profound effect on his life and causes him to become an [[alcoholic]] for a period.

While at a [[gun show]] in his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri, with friend Allen Kane, Bowman publicly embarrasses an agent of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF), Wilson Blair. One of Blair's men was trying to trick and entrap a fellow [[firearms dealer]]. Blair takes the offense personally, and with the support of the ATF's director, begins to plan revenge. Several years later, Blair and subordinate agents of the ATF plan to frame Henry and his friends as terrorists, smugglers, and counterfeiters. They plan to plant "evidence" when the men are away on vacation. Unbeknownst to Blair, Bowman delays his departure and is on a friends' property when the agents arrive. Bowman assumes the men are burglars and engages in a gun battle with them, killing all but Blair before he discovers the truth. 

Bowman realizes that his life has been irrevocably changed. He makes Blair record a video taped confession of his illegal actions, then kills Blair and disposes of all forensic evidence of the agents' presence. Afterwards, he hunts down and kills Blair's remaining subordinates. Bowman and his closest friends begin to systematically kill ATF agents around the nation, whom Bowman views as supporting the infringement of citizen's constitutional rights, and abusing government powers. Simultaneously Bowman releases the video tape of Blair to [[CNN]], which claims that Blair and his companions have had a change of heart, realize what they are doing is wrong, and are now dedicated to killing other ATF agents. Amidst the national search for Blair and company, Bowman continues to rack up the body count.

== Fictionalized accounts of historical events ==
The story contains several partially-fictionalized accounts of real-life historical events. The author inserts fictional characters, dialog and the unspoken thoughts of real and fictional characters into these events. Although the additions seem plausible for the most part, they are clearly fictional. These events are not merely used as settings or backdrops for the action in the novel; instead, detailed treatments of some of these events occupy dozens of pages. In particular, the following events are featured prominently:

* [[Bonus Army|Bonus Army March]] on [[Washington, DC]] (1932)
* [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] (1943)
* [[Ken Ballew raid]] (1971)
* [[MOVE]] raid in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] (1985)
* [[FBI Miami shootout, 1986|FBI shootout]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] (1986)
* John Lawmaster raid in [[Tulsa]] (ATF) (1991)
* [[Ruby Ridge]] incident in [[Idaho]] (1992)
* [[Waco Siege]] (1993)
* [[Oklahoma City bombing]] (1995)

== Timothy McVeigh Controversy ==

[[Timothy McVeigh]] read the novel while awaiting his trial for the [[Oklahoma City bombing]]. He loved the book, and noted that if it had come out a few years earlier, he would have given serious consideration to using sniper attacks in a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against the government instead of bombing a federal building:<ref>{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|page=304}}</ref>
{{cquote|If people say ''[[The Turner Diaries]]'' was my Bible, ''Unintended Consequences'' would be my [[New Testament]]. I think ''Unintended Consequences'' is a better book. It might have changed my whole plan of operation if I'd read that one first.}}
John Ross has posted a response to Timothy McVeigh's comments on his website:<ref name="John Ross.net FAQ"/> 
{{cquote|First of all, authors have no control over who decides to admire their work. Remember that when the FBI searched [[Unabomber]] Ted Kaczinski<U+2019>s shack (after his brother turned him in), they found only a handful of personal items and just a single, well-read book. What was the one title that the Unabomber felt was so important it was his only reading material? [[Earth in the Balance]], by [[Al Gore]].}}

Critics{{Who|date=December 2009}} argue that Ross' argument is specious since Gore does not condone nor glorify [[eco-terrorism]] in his book while Ross does seem to condone and glorify [[leaderless resistance]] in his book. Ross' argument is further undermined by the fact that according to court documents the Unabomber had dozens of books in his possession at the time of his arrest, none of which appear to be the aforementioned title.<ref>http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0811062tedk10.html</ref>
