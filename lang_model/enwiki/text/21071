'''Saint Eunan's College''' ({{lang-ga|Col<U+00E1>iste Adhamhn<U+00E1>in}}) is an all-male voluntary [[Secondary education|secondary school]]. Located in Glencar, [[Letterkenny]], [[County Donegal]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the building is a three-storey castle with four round towers at each corner of the building. The school is named after the [[Abbot of Iona]] [[Eunan|Saint Eunan]], a native of Donegal and [[patron saint]] of the [[Diocese of Raphoe (Roman Catholic)|Diocese of Raphoe]]. The college celebrated its [[centenary]] in 2006.<ref>[http://www.sainteunans.com/history.htm Information and References], Saint Eunan's College website. (accessed 2008-07-06)</ref>

==History==
Saint Eunan's College was founded as a [[boarding school]] in 1906 by the then [[Diocese of Raphoe (Roman Catholic)|Bishop of Raphoe]], [[Patrick O'Donnell (cardinal)|Patrick O' Donnell]]. Originally intended as a [[seminary|minor seminary]], it was designed to prepare students for the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[priesthood]]. Diocesan colleges became an increasingly popular feature at the time and were designed to give the best possible [[Catholic]] education to boys of every class.
[[File:College Letterkenny Eunan.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Saint Eunan's College]]

The student population expanded in the 1920s and it was necessary to build a new extension to the College in the early 1930s. The current recreation hall was built in 1958 and the science block in 1968. The College Chapel was designed by J.J. Robinson, the architect of [[Galway Cathedral]]. It was completed in 1961 at a cost of <U+00A3>42,000.<ref>''Did You Know'', Published in the 1995 edition of the Letterkenny and District Christmas Annual</ref>

The 'new building' was opened in 1979 to cater for the 500 students enrolled at the time. Due to the growth of other second level schools in the area the number of boarders dropped extensively and in 1992, the boarding wing was finally shut down. Saint Eunan's College continues to this day as a Catholic School under the trusteeship of the Bishop of [[Raphoe]].

The school currently serves approximately 900 students from Letterkenny and its surrounding area, and is one of the few remaining all-male schools in the north-western part of [[Ireland]]. The president, since 2009, is Christopher Darby and the vice [[Principal (school)|principal]], since 2010, is Mary Cunningham.

In 2007, the school came to the attention of the national media. Retailers were urged not to sell eggs and flour to students following a spate of attacks on passing cars.<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/garda-crackdown-on-bad-eggs-in-rural-town-61690.html Irish Independent - Garda crackdown on 'bad eggs' in rural town]</ref>

In 2009, Christopher Darby became the first lay person to become president of the college, taking over from Father Michael Carney.<ref>[http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/donegalnews/New-president-for-St-Eunan39s.5423522.jp New president for St Eunan's College], Donegal Democrat, 2 July 2009</ref>

===Allegations of child abuse===
In his autobiography which was released in 2010, internationally renowned chef [[Conrad Gallagher]] told of the abuse he received at the college. He discussed how the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] would feel him up and attempt to interfere with him. However he has decided not to press charges against the abusers. He stated that he wishes to put it all behind him. However, St Eunan's is not a Christian Brothers school, which casts some doubt on this statement.<ref>[http://www.silobreaker.com/chefs-bitter-taste-of-st-eunans-revealed-in-new-book-5_2263970584918491196 Chef's bitter taste of St Eunan's revealed in new book], Donegal Democrat, December 2010</ref>

==Centenary celebrations==
Centenary celebrations began on Friday 6 October 2006 with an exhibition of photographs and the launch of the centenary booklet. The photographic exhibition included photographs from down through the years. It included photos of past and present staff and students as well as sports teams from the past one hundred years. Books, uniforms and other memorabilia were on display. The exhibition was opened by [[S<U+00E9>amus Hegarty]], Bishop of Derry, a past student and a former patron of the school. On Saturday a sporting exhibition took place on the pitch. A veterans soccer match was organised along with a veterans gaelic football match. Mass was celebrated on Sunday by [[Philip Boyce]], [[Bishop of Raphoe]] in [[Cathedral of St. Eunan and St. Columba|St. Eunan's Cathedral]]. A dinner dance was held in the ''Mount Errigal Hotel'' later that evening.<ref>[http://archives.nwipp-newspapers.com/archive_detail.php?archiveFile=2006/September/22/GeneralNews/7122.xml&start=0&numPer=20&keyword=St+Eunans+College&sectionSearch=&begindate=1%2F1%2F2003&enddate=10%2F17%2F2008&authorSearch=&IncludeStories=1&pubsection=&page=&IncludePages=1&IncludeImages=1&mode=allwords&archive_pubname=Donegal+News%0A%09%09%09 Plans for St Eunan's College Centenary celebrations], Donegal News, September 22, 2006</ref>

On Sunday 8 April 2007, golfer [[Paul McGinley]] launched the College Centenary Golf Classic. It was the final event in the centenary year celebrations and was played at [[Letterkenny Golf Club]].<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/sport/golf/college-backed-by-mcginleys-44076.html College backed by McGinleys], Irish Independent, April 18, 2007</ref>

==Building==
In recent years there has been an attempt to build a new extension.<ref>[http://www.sainteunans.com/extension.htm New Building/Extension], Saint Eunan's College Website</ref> Two plans were drawn up, but an approach has not yet been confirmed.

In meeting with planning regulations, the school has installed a series of ramps and two chair-lifts for the benefit of those attending or visiting the school who may need them. Three [[Prefabricated building|prefabs]] were installed in the Summer of 2008 as well as four more Prefabs that were installed in the Summer of 2010 to cater for the growing number of incoming first-years.

==Academic==
In common with the vast majority of secondary schools in the Republic of Ireland, St Eunan's currently provides the qualifications of the [[Junior Certificate]] and the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]]. It also provides the facilities for [[Transition Year]] which includes two work experience allotments and a choice between Computer or Sport [[GCSEs]]. The college is one of only 18 schools in the county that offers the [[Leaving Certificate Applied|LCA]] programme.<ref>[http://lca.slss.ie/school/proglist?place_id=38 Schools in Donegal providing the LCA], Leaving Certificate Applied website</ref>

At Junior Certificate level, the school offers art, woodwork and technical drawing. The college currently offers two foreign languages, French and German, at Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate levels, but Irish is also compulsory, subject to some exemptions, as in all other secondary schools in Ireland. Spanish is offered during Transition Year along with French and German.

Transition Year modules (taken on a Friday afternoon) include first-aid, cooking, car maintenance, tourism and electronics. Yoga and juggling were introduced in 2007. Towards the end of the year, more diverse modules are offered such as tennis, karate, and drama (at [[An Grian<U+00E1>n Theatre]]).

Junior and Leaving Certificate students usually undertake pre-test exams every February or March or April whilst the real exams follow swiftly in June.

==Sport==
Physical education and team activities are important to the school, with several national titles, particularly in Soccer<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/sport/2004/0504/schools.html "Saint Eunan's claim schools double"], RT<U+00C9> Sport. (accessed 2008-07-06</ref> and Gaelic Football. [[Colm McFadden]] and [[Mickey Huston]] currently teach in the school. Mickey is a former club manager and was also a team selector for the [[Donegal GAA]] team but quit after a row with the manager. He was enjoying the game when his authority was undermined and substitutions were made without his consultation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/northern_ireland/1359703.stm BBC Sport - Houston's big problem]</ref>

===McLarnon Cup===
[[File:TowerTurret.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Saint Eunan's College round towers & turrets.]]
The senior Gaelic team has in the past eight years won the [[McLarnon Cup]] twice, the latest occasion being 2007. On Sunday March 25, 2007, the College, beat [[Rathmore Grammar School|Rathmore]] by 1-09 to 2-03 at [[Casement Park]] in [[Belfast]], having travelled there six days earlier only for the match to be postponed. The senior team then went on to beat [[Rice College]] of [[Westport, County Mayo|Westport]] in the All-Ireland B Colleges semi-final but were beaten themselves by St. Mary's of [[Edenderry]] in the All-Ireland Final at [[Breffni Park]], [[County Cavan]] on Saturday April 21, 2007. The match went to extra time after a penalty save by Saint Eunan's goalkeeper John Carr, but the College eventually lost by 2-12 to 0-14. The team reached the semi-final of the [[MacRory Cup]] in 2008, only to be defeated by [[St. Michael's College Enniskillen|St. Michael's College]] of [[Enniskillen]] 1-17 to 0-7 on February 22, 2008.

Saint Eunan's College, with future inter-county footballers Rory Kavanagh and Colm McFadden part of the team, (indeed McFadden himself was to become a future teacher at the school) also won the McLarnon Cup in 2000 for the first time since 1979,<ref>[http://www.sainteunans.com/gaamaclarnon.htm MacLarnon Cup], Saint Eunan's College Website</ref> as well as the Ulster Herald Cup in 2004.<ref>[http://www.sainteunans.com/gaaherald.htm Herald Cup], Saint Eunan's College Website</ref> The Herald Cup win was the school's first in 25 years.

Three students have achieved Ulster All-Stars while playing for the college, ''Mark McGowan'',<ref>[http://www.sainteunans.com/gaamcgowan.htm Mark McGowan], Saint Eunan's College Website</ref> ''Hugh Brendan Kerr'' and ''Sean McEwen''.<ref>[http://www.sainteunans.com/gaastars.htm All Stars], Saint Eunan's College Website</ref> [[Rory Kavanagh]], [[Colm McFadden]], [[Neil Gallagher]] and [[Michael Boyle (Gaelic footballer)|Michael Boyle]], who all previously played with college teams, are now members of the senior [[Donegal GAA|Donegal Gaelic]] team.<ref>[http://www.sainteunans.com/gaa.htm Gaelic Football], Saint Eunan's College Website</ref>

Even hurling teams, a sport which is not seen as very popular in Donegal, have reached the semi-finals of some competitions.<ref>[http://www.sainteunans.com/hurling.htm Hurling], Saint Eunan's College Website</ref> There is also a school rugby team and table tennis team.

==Extra-curricular activities==

Every year a selection of teachers and students head for the European ski-slopes during the holidays.<ref>[http://www.sainteunans.com/skitrips.htm Ski Trips], Saint Eunan's College Website</ref> The 2008 trip to the US was eventful, as the plane home experienced engine difficulties and had to return to Boston.<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/0111/breaking1.html Aer Lingus flight to Shannon aborted, [[Irish Times]], January 11, 2008]</ref>
