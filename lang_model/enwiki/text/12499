Formerly '''Longacre Square''', Times Square was renamed in April 1904 after ''[[The New York Times]]'' moved its headquarters to the newly erected Times Building (now called [[One Times Square]]), the site of the annual [[Times Square Ball|ball drop]] on [[New Year's Eve]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timessquare.com/NYC__/Times_Square_History/Times_Square:_Part_of_New_York_City_History/|title=Times Square: Part of New York City History|author=VR Macbeth|publisher=(C) 1980 <U+2013> 2010 TimesSquare.com A Dataware Corporation Company|date=November 17, 2005|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}</ref> a tradition which began on December 31, 1907 and continues today, attracting thousands to the Square every New Year's Eve.

The northern triangle of Times Square is [[Duffy Square]], which was dedicated in 1937 to Chaplain [[Francis P. Duffy]] of New York City's "[[U.S. 69th Infantry Regiment|Fighting 69th]]" Infantry Regiment; a memorial to Duffy is located there, along with a statue of [[George M. Cohan]], and the [[TKTS]] discount theatre tickets booth. The stepped red roof of the TKTS booth also provides seating for various events. The statue of Duffy and Duffy Square were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2001.<ref>Harris, Stephen L. ''Duffy's War: Fr. Francis Duffy, Wild Bill Donovan, and the Irish Fighting 69th in World War I'', Potomac Books, 2006</ref>

===Early history===

When [[Manhattan]] Island was first settled by the Dutch, three small streams united near what is now 10th Avenue and 40th street. These three streams formed the "Great Kill" (Dutch: ''Grote Kill''). From there the Great Kill wound through the low-lying Reed Valley, known for fish and waterfowl<ref>Gerard T. Koeppel, ''Water for Gotham: A History'', 2001:10.</ref> and emptied into a deep bay in the [[Hudson River]] at the present 42nd Street.<ref>Edric W. Sanderson, ''Mannahatta: A Natural History of New York City'', 2009: Appendix A p 253; refs. G.E. Hill and G.E. Waring Jr, "Old wells and water-courses on the isle of Manhattan", in ''Historic New York'', M.W. Goodwin, A.C. Royce, and R. Putnam, 1897; and others.</ref> The name was retained in a tiny hamlet, Great Kill, that became a center for carriage-making, as the upland to the south and east became known as Longacre.<ref>Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace, ''Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898'', 1999, p.721.</ref>

Before and after the [[American Revolution]], the area belonged to [[John Morin Scott]], a general of the [[New York militia]], in which he served under [[George Washington]]. Scott's [[manor house]] was at what is currently 43rd Street, surrounded by countryside used for farming and breeding horses. In the first half of the 19th century, it became one of the prized possessions of [[John Jacob Astor]], who made a second fortune selling off lots to hotels and other real estate concerns as the city rapidly spread [[Upper Manhattan|uptown]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ulam |first=Alex |url=http://therealdeal.com/newyork/articles/john-jacob-astor-the-making-of-a-hardnosed-speculator |title=John Jacob Astor: The making of a hardnosed speculator &#124; The Real Deal &#124; New York Real Estate News |publisher=The Real Deal |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref>

By 1872, the area had become the center of New York's carriage industry. The area not having previously been named, the city authorities called it Longacre Square after [[Long Acre (street)|Long Acre]] in London, where the carriage trade in that city was centered and which was also a home to stables.<ref>Kelly, Frank Bergen. [http://books.google.com/books?id=v4cGmMe6_okC&pg=PA121&dq=longacre+bloomingdale&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HYbeT-XVGuTX6gGy1vmFCw&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=longacre%20bloomingdale&f=false ''Historical Guide to the City of New York''] New York: Frederick A. Stokes Co., 1909</ref> [[William Henry Vanderbilt]] owned and ran the American Horse Exchange there until the turn of the 20th century.

As more profitable commerce and industrialization of [[lower Manhattan]] pushed homes, theaters, and prostitution northward from the [[Tenderloin, Manhattan|Tenderloin District]], Long Acre Square became nicknamed the ''Thieves Lair'' for its rollicking reputation as a low entertainment district. The first theater on the square, the [[Olympia Theatre (New York)|Olympia]], was built by cigar manufacturer and [[impresario]] [[Oscar Hammerstein I]].  "By the early 1890s this once sparsely settled stretch of Broadway was ablaze with electric light and thronged by crowds of middle- and upper-class theatre, restaurant and cafe patrons."<ref>Burrows and Wallace 1999:1149.</ref>

===1900s<U+2013>1960s===
In 1904, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' publisher [[Adolph Ochs|Adolph S. Ochs]] moved the newspaper's operations to a new skyscraper on 42nd Street at Longacre Square, on the site of the former [[Pabst Hotel]], which had existed on the site for less than a decade. Ochs persuaded Mayor [[George B. McClellan, Jr.]] to construct a [[Times Square <U+2013> 42nd Street (New York City Subway)|subway station]] there, and the area was renamed "Times Square" on April 8, 1904. Just three weeks later, the first electrified advertisement appeared on the side of a bank at the corner of 46th Street and Broadway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM7J68_Times_Square_New_York_New_York |title=Times Square <U+2013> New York, New York <U+2013> Scenic at Night on |publisher=Waymarking.com |date= |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref> The north end later became Duffy Square.

''The New York Times'', according to Nolan, moved to more spacious offices west of the square in 1913. The old Times Building was later named the [[Allied Corp.|Allied Chemical]] Building. Now known simply as [[One Times Square]], it is famed for the Times Square Ball drop on its roof every New Year's Eve.

In 1913, the [[Lincoln Highway Association]], headed by entrepreneur [[Carl G. Fisher]], chose the intersection of 42nd Street and Broadway, at the southeast corner of Times Square, to be the Eastern Terminus of the [[Lincoln Highway]], the first road across the United States, which originally spanned {{convert|3389|mi|km}} coast-to-coast through 13 states to its Western Terminus in [[Lincoln Park, San Francisco|Lincoln Park]] in San Francisco, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=18026 |title=The Lincoln Highway Marker |publisher=Hmdb.org |date= |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref>

As the growth in New York City continued, Times Square quickly became a cultural hub full of theatres, [[music hall]]s, and upscale hotels.

{{Quote|Times Square quickly became New York's [[agora]], a place to gather to await great tidings and to celebrate them, whether a World Series or a presidential election|[[James Traub]]|''The Devil's Playground: A Century of Pleasure and Profit in Times Square''||color=#B2B7F2}}

Celebrities such as [[Irving Berlin]], [[Fred Astaire]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]] were closely associated with Times Square in the 1910s and 1920s. During this period, the area was nicknamed ''[[Tenderloin, Manhattan|The Tenderloin]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebase.com/view/en/tenderloin_manhattan |title=Tenderloin facts |publisher=Freebase |date=May 30, 2009 |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref> because it was supposedly the most desirable location in Manhattan. However, it was during this period that the area was besieged by crime and corruption, in the form of gambling and prostitution; one case that garnered huge attention was the arrest and subsequent execution of police officer [[Charles Becker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/cops_others/becker/2.html |title=Killer Cop: Charles Becker <U+2013> Crime Library on |publisher=Trutv.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131212212812/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/cops_others/becker/2.html|archivedate=2014-11-18|accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref>

The general atmosphere changed with the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s. Times Square acquired a reputation as a dangerous neighborhood in the following decades. From the 1960s to the early 1990s, the seediness of the area, especially due to its [[go-go bars]], [[sex shops]], and adult theaters, became an infamous symbol of the city's decline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/207131/new_york_guide/times_square_new_york_city.html |title=Times Square New York City |publisher=Streetdirectory.com |date= |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref>

===1970s<U+2013>1980s===
As early as 1960, 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenue, was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "the 'worst' [block] in town",<ref name="bracker">Milton Bracker, "Life on W. 42nd St. a study in decay," New York Times, March 14, 1960, at 1, 26.</ref> Times Square in that decade, as depicted in ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', was gritty, dark and desperate, and it got worse in the 1970s and 1980s, as did the [[Crime in New York City|crime situation]] in the rest of the city things were worse still. By 1984, an unprecedented 2,300 annual crimes occurred on that single block, of which 460 were serious felonies such as murder and rape. At the time, since police morale was low, misdemeanors were allowed to go unpunished. [[William Bratton]], who was appointed [[New York City Police Commissioner]] in 1994 and again in 2014, stated, "The [NYPD] didn't want high performance; it wanted to stay out of trouble, to avoid corruption scandals and conflicts in the community. For years, therefore, the key to career success in the NYPD, as in many bureaucratic leviathans, was to shun risk and avoid failure. Accordingly, cops became more cautious as they rose in rank, right up to the highest levels."<ref>William J. Bratton and William Andrews, "What we've learned about policing," City Journal, Spring 1999, available at http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_2_what_weve_learned.html (accessed Feb. 3, 2009).</ref> As the city government did not implement [[broken windows theory]] at first, the allowance of low-profile crime in the city caused more high-profile crimes to occur.<ref>George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson, "Broken Windows," The Atlantic, March 1982, available at http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/198203/broken-windows (accessed Feb. 3, 2009).</ref> The area was so abandoned at one point during the time that the entire Times Square area paid the city only $6 million in property taxes, which is less than what a medium-sized office building in Manhattan typically would produce in tax revenue today in 1984 dollars.

In the 1980s, a commercial building boom began in the western parts of Midtown as part of a long-term [[development plan]] developed under Mayors [[Ed Koch]] and [[David Dinkins]]. In the mid-1990s, [[Rudolph Giuliani]] led an effort to clean up the area, increasing [[security]], closing [[pornography|pornographic]] theaters, pressuring undesireables to relocate, and opening more [[tourist]]-friendly [[attractions]] and [[luxury good|upscale]] establishments. Advocates of the [[remodeling]] claim that the neighborhood is safer and cleaner. Detractors have countered that the changes have homogenized or [[Disneyfication|"Disneyfied"]] the character of Times Square and have unfairly targeted lower-income New Yorkers from nearby neighborhoods such as [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Macek |first=Steve |title=Urban Nightmares: The Media, the Right, And the Moral Panic Over the City |location=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |page=2006 |isbn=9780816643608 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NzfLbx1rkxoC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=New+York+Times+Disneyfication+Times+Square+Giuliani&source=bl&ots=wQmWrjFsX6&sig=vgtipwzlh700oc7gY2e-7jnGe_A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qVJgU9aUE8uWyATnnIHYDw&ved=0CCYQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=New%20York%20Times%20Disneyfication%20Times%20Square%20Giuliani&f=false |page=111 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Rofes |first=Eric E. |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/glq/summary/v007/7.1rofes.html |title=Imperial New York: Destruction and Disneyfication under Emperor Giuliani.

===1990s===
In 1990, the state of New York took possession of six of the nine historic theatres on 42nd Street, and the [[New 42nd Street]] [[non-profit organization]] was appointed to oversee their restoration and maintenance. The theatres underwent renovation for Broadway shows, conversion for commercial purposes, or demolition.

The theatres of Broadway and the huge number of animated [[neon sign|neon]] and [[LED]] signs have long made them one of New York's iconic images, and a symbol of the intensely urban aspects of Manhattan. Times Square is the only neighborhood with [[zoning ordinance]]s requiring building owners to display illuminated signs.<ref>{{cite news | last = Oser | first = Alan S. | title = GREAT WHITE WAY; Planning for a Brighter Times Sq. | work = New York Times | date = December 14, 1986 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/realestate/perspectives-great-white-way-planning-for-a-brighter-times-sq.html | accessdate = August 22, 2009}}</ref> The neighborhood actually has a minimum limit for lighting instead of the standard maximum limit.<ref>[http://www.archdaily.com/241079/architect-robert-a-m-stern-presence-of-the-past/ "Architect Robert A.M.

Officially, signs in Times Square are called "spectaculars", and the largest of them are called "[[jumbotron]]s."

Notable signage includes the [[Toshiba]] billboard directly under the NYE ball drop and the curved seven-story [[NASDAQ]] sign at the [[NASDAQ MarketSite]] at [[4 Times Square]] on 43rd Street and the curved [[Coca-Cola sign]] located underneath another large LED display owned and operated by [[Samsung]]. Both the Coca-Cola sign and Samsung LED displays were built by LED display manufacturer [[Daktronics]].

In 1992, the Times Square Alliance (formerly the Times Square [[Business improvement district|Business Improvement District]], or "BID" for short), a coalition of city government and local businesses dedicated to improving the quality of commerce and cleanliness in the district, started operations in the area.<ref>[http://www.timessquarenyc.org/about_us/info_center.html Times Square Alliance] Tourist information center in former Embassy Theater</ref> Times Square now boasts attractions such as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Times Square Studios]], where ''[[Good Morning America]]'' is broadcast live, an elaborate [[Toys "R" Us|Toys "<U+042F>" Us]] store, and competing [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's]] and [[M&M's]] stores across the street from each other, as well as restaurants such as Ruby Foo's (serving [[Chinese food]]), the [[Bubba Gump Shrimp Company]] ([[seafood]]), [[Planet Hollywood|Planet Hollywood Restaurant and Bar]] (a [[theme restaurant]]) and Carmine's ([[Italian cuisine|Italian]]) along with a number of multiplex movie theaters. It has also attracted a number of large financial, publishing, and media firms to set up headquarters in the area. A larger presence of police has improved the safety of the area.

In 2002, New York City's mayor, [[Rudy Giuliani]], gave the oath of office to the city's next mayor, [[Michael Bloomberg]], at Times Square after midnight on January 1 as part of the 2001<U+2013>2002 New Year's celebration. Approximately 500,000 revelers attended. Security was high following the [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]], with more than 7,000 [[New York City Police Department|New York City police officers]] on duty in the Square, twice the number for an ordinary year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/searchlight/bloomberg_inaug.shtml |title=Inaugural Address Of Mayor Michael Bloomberg |publisher=Gothamgazette.com |date=January 1, 2002 |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref>

Since 2002, the summer solstice has been marked by "Mind over Madness", a mass yoga event involving up to 15,000 people.

From August 14, 2003 to August 15, 2003, the lights of Times Square went dark as a result of the [[Northeast blackout of 2003|2003 Northeast blackout]], which paralyzed most of the region and parts of Canada for over 24 hours. Power was finally restored to the area on the evening of Friday, August 15.

On the morning of March 6, 2008, [[2008 Times Square bombing|a small bomb]] caused minor damage but no reported injuries.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7280963.stm BBC News] March 6, 2008</ref>

On February 26, 2009, Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] announced that traffic lanes along [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] from [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] to 47th Street would be de-mapped starting Memorial Day 2009 and transformed into pedestrian plazas until at least the end of the year as a trial. The same was done from 33rd to 35th Street. The goal was to ease traffic congestion throughout the Midtown grid. The results were to be closely monitored to determine if the project worked and should be extended.<ref>{{cite news | last = Seifman | first = David | title = Broadway Cars Can Take A Walk | work = New York Post | date = February 26, 2009 | url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/02262009/news/regionalnews/broadway_cars_can_take_a_walk_157028.htm | accessdate = August 22, 2009}}</ref> Bloomberg also stated that he believed the street shutdown would make New York more livable by reducing pollution, cutting down on pedestrian accidents and helping traffic flow more smoothly.<ref>{{cite news | last = Vanderford | first = Richard | last2 = Goldsmith | first2 = Samuel | title = Walk, bike or sit, car-free, in Times Square and Herald Square | work = New York Daily News | date = May 25, 2009 | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/05/25/2009-05-25_broadway_stroll_walk_bike_or_sit_and_check_email_carfree_in_times__herald_sqs.html | accessdate = August 22, 2009}}</ref> The project was originally opposed by local businesses, who thought that closing the street to cars would hurt business.<ref>[http://americancity.org/daily/entry/citing-livability-and-mobility-bloomberg-declares-broadway-plazas-a-success Citing "Livability and Mobility," Bloomberg Declares Broadway Plazas a Success <U+2013> Next City].

===New Year's Eve celebrations===
{{See also|Times Square Ball}}
[[File:Times Square ball.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The Times Square Ball in 2007]]

Times Square is the site of the annual New Year's Eve ball drop. About one million revelers crowd Times Square for the New Year's Eve celebrations, more than twice the usual number of visitors the area usually receives daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timessquarenyc.org/nye/nye.html |title=Times Square Alliance <U+2013> New Year's Eve |publisher=Timessquarenyc.org |date= |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref> However, for the millennium celebration on December 31, 1999, published reports stated approximately two million people overflowed Times Square, flowing from 6th Avenue to 8th Avenue and all the way back on Broadway and Seventh Avenues to 59th Street, making it the largest gathering in Times Square since August 1945 during [[Victory over Japan Day|celebrations marking the end of World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|author=www.nyctourist.com |url=http://timessquare.nyctourist.com/ |title=Times Square New York City, New York City Times Square by NYCTourist.com |publisher=Timessquare.nyctourist.com |date= |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref>

On December 31, 1907, a ball signifying New Year's Day was first dropped at Times Square,<ref name=TSLNY /> and the Square has held the main New Year's celebration in New York City ever since. On that night, hundreds of thousands of people congregate to watch the [[Waterford Crystal]] ball being lowered on a pole atop the building, marking the start of the new year. It replaced a lavish fireworks display from the top of the building that was held from 1904 to 1906, but stopped by city officials because of the danger of fire. Beginning in 1908, and for more than eighty years thereafter, Times Square sign maker [[Artkraft Strauss]] was responsible for the ball-lowering. During World War II, a minute of silence, followed by a recording of church bells pealing, replaced the ball drop because of wartime blackout restrictions. Today, Countdown Entertainment and One Times Square handle the New Year's Eve event in conjunction with the Times Square Alliance.<ref name=TSLNY />

A new energy-efficient LED ball, celebrating the centennial of the Times Square ball drop, debuted for the arrival of 2008. The 2008/2009-ball, which was dropped on New Year's Eve (Wednesday, December 31, 2008)<ref name=TSLNY>{{cite web|url=http://www.timessquarenyc.org/nye/nye_ball.html |title=Times Square Alliance <U+2013> New Year's Eve <U+2013> About The Ball |publisher=Timessquarenyc.org |date=November 11, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref> for the arrival of 2009, is larger and has become a permanent installation as a year-round attraction, being used for celebrations such as Valentine's Day and Halloween.

==In popular culture==
Times Square has been featured countless times in literature, on television, in films, in video games, and in music videos.

An immediately recognizable location, Times Square has been frequently attacked and destroyed in a number of movies, including ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'', when a [[solar flare]] destroys New York City, ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'', when a [[tsunami]] created from a [[meteor]] impact destroys New York City, Stephen King's ''[[The Stand (TV miniseries)|The Stand]]'', where the intersection is overcome by total anarchy, the ending of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', and ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''. Films have also employed the opposite tactic, depicting the typically bustling area as eerily still, such as in ''[[Vanilla Sky]],'' as well as the post-apocalyptic ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'', in which [[Will Smith]] and his dog go hunting for deer in the deserted urban canyon. Times Square was also depicted in the 2011 movie, ''[[New Year's Eve (film)|New Year's Eve]]'', and was also seen in the festival battle scene in the 2002 film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', and a stand-off in later film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''. The ara was shown in the 1980 film ''[[Times Square (film)|Times Square]]'', which featured a [[punk rock]]/[[new wave music|new wave]] soundtrack. It also has featured prominently in video games, such as ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', in which a recreation of the Times Square area is included in the game's fictional "[[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto IV era)|Liberty City]]" setting; ''[[Battlefield 3]]'', where the final fight with the main antagonist takes place, where the player must stop him from detonating a nuke in the square; and ''[[Crysis 2]]'', in which player must fight off attacking alien forces in order to assist US Marines to evacuate the area.
