'''Pelicans''' are a [[genus]] of large [[water bird]]s comprising the [[family (biology)|family]] Pelecanidae. They are characterised by a long [[beak]] and large [[throat pouch]] used in catching [[Predation|prey]] and draining water from the scooped up contents before swallowing. They have predominantly pale plumage, the exceptions being the [[Brown Pelican|Brown]] and [[Peruvian Pelican]]s. The bills, pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brightly coloured before the breeding season. The eight living pelican species have a patchy global distribution, ranging [[latitude|latitudinally]] from the [[tropics]] to the [[temperate zone]], though they are absent from interior South America as well as from [[polar region]]s and the open ocean. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back at least 30 million years, to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from [[Oligocene]] strata in France.

Long thought to be related to [[frigatebird]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[tropicbird]]s, [[Sulidae|gannets and boobies]], pelicans are now known instead to be most closely related to the [[Shoebill]] and [[Hamerkop]], and are placed in the order [[Pelecaniformes]]. [[Ibis]]es, [[spoonbill]]s and [[heron]]s are more distant relatives, and have been classified in the same order. Pelicans frequent inland and coastal waters where they feed principally on fish, catching them at or near the water surface. [[wikt:Gregarious|Gregarious]] birds, they often hunt cooperatively and breed [[bird colony|colonially]]. Four white-plumaged species tend to nest on the ground, and four brown or grey-plumaged species nest mainly in trees.

The relationship between pelicans and people has often been contentious. The birds have been persecuted because of their perceived competition with commercial and recreational fishers. They have suffered from habitat destruction, disturbance and environmental pollution, and three species are of conservation concern. They also have a long history of cultural significance in [[mythology]], and in Christian and [[heraldry|heraldic]] [[iconography]].

===Etymology===
The genus ''Pelecanus'' was first formally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in 1758, in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]''. He described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip, linear nostrils, a bare face, and fully webbed feet. This early definition included [[frigatebird]]s, [[cormorant]]s, and [[Sulidae|sulids]] as well as pelicans.<ref name="linnaeus">{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C. | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis.

===Taxonomy===
{{main|Pelecaniformes#Systematics and evolution}}
Pelicans give their name to the [[Pelecaniformes]], an [[order (biology)|order]] which has had a varied taxonomic history. [[Tropicbird]]s, [[darter]]s, cormorants, [[gannet]]s, [[booby|boobies]] and frigatebirds, all traditional members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, [[Phaethontiformes]], and the remainder into [[Suliformes]]. In their place, [[heron]]s, [[ibis]]es, [[spoonbill]]s, the [[Hamerkop]] and the [[Shoebill]] have now been transferred into Pelecaniformes.<ref name=Hackett/> Molecular evidence suggests that the Shoebill and the Hamerkop form a [[sister group]] to the pelicans,<ref name="smith2010">{{cite journal | last= Smith | first= N.D. | year=2010 | title= Phylogenetic Analysis of Pelecaniformes (Aves) Based on Osteological Data: Implications for Waterbird Phylogeny and Fossil Calibration Studies | journal= PLoS ONE | volume=5 | issue = 10 | page= e13354 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013354 | editor1-last= Desalle | editor1-first= Robert | pmid=20976229 | pmc=2954798}}</ref> though there is some doubt as to the exact relationship between the three lineages.<ref>{{cite doi| 10.1111/j.1439-0469.2007.00433.x}}</ref>

===Living species===
The eight living pelican species can be divided into two groups, one containing four ground-nesters with mainly white adult plumage ([[Australian Pelican|Australian]], [[Dalmatian Pelican|Dalmatian]], [[Great White Pelican|Great White]], and [[American White Pelican]]s), and one containing four grey or brown plumaged species which nest preferentially either in trees ([[Pink-backed Pelican|Pink-backed]], [[Spot-billed Pelican|Spot-billed]] and [[Brown Pelican]]s), or on sea rocks ([[Peruvian Pelican]]). The largely marine Brown and Peruvian Pelicans, formerly considered [[conspecific]],<ref name=NSS/> are sometimes separated from the others by placement in the [[subgenus]] ''[[Leptopelicanus]]''<ref name="hanzab1a">{{cite book| author = Marchant, S.; Higgins, P.J.

Thus, ''Leptopelicanus'' (if valid<!-- depending on whether American White has an older (sub)genus name -->) would include the American White Pelican too.<!-- Mol Phylogent Evol 66:215 --> The Dalmatian Pelican was considered to be a subspecies of the Spot-billed, though it differs in both nesting habits and morphology; it is now accepted as a full species.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/dalmatian-pelican-pelecanus-crispus |title=Dalmatian Pelican |accessdate=19 May 2012 |work=Internet Bird Collection |publisher=Lynx Editions}}</ref>

Pelicans are very large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook at the end of the upper mandible, and the attachment of a huge [[gular skin|gular]] pouch to the lower. The slender [[Ramus of the mandible|rami]] of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and, sometimes, rainwater,<ref name=hanzab1a/> though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bird, its Form and Function |author=Beebe, C.

===Air sacs===
Anatomical dissections of two Brown Pelicans in 1939 showed that pelicans have a network of subcutaneous [[Bird_anatomy#Skeletal_system|air sacs]] under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast and undersides of the wings, as well as having air sacs in their bones.<ref name="richardson39"/> The air sacs are connected to the airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its [[glottis]], but it is not clear how air sacs are inflated.<ref name="richardson39">{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Frank|year=1939|title=Functional Aspects of the Pneumatic System of the California Brown Pelican|journal=The Condor|volume=41|issue=1|pages=13<U+2013>17|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v041n01/p0013-p0017.pdf|doi=10.2307/1364267}}</ref> The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water<ref>{{cite book| last = Bumstead| first = Pat| title = Canadian Feathers : a Loon-atics Guide to Anting, Mimicry and Dump-nesting| url = http://books.google.com/?id=vmkmuyvhxqAC| year = 2001| publisher = Simply Wild Publications| location = Calgary, Alberta| isbn = 0968927807| page = 129 }}</ref> and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish.<ref name="richardson39"/> Superficial air sacs may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.<ref name="richardson39"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
Modern pelicans are found on all continents except Antarctica. They primarily inhabit warm regions, although breeding ranges extend to latitudes of 45<U+00B0> South ([[Australian Pelican]]s in [[Tasmania]]) and 60<U+00B0> North ([[American White Pelican]]s in western Canada).<ref name="NSS">{{cite book| last = Nelson| first = J.

==Behaviour and ecology==
[[File:Australian pelican in flight.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Australian Pelican gliding|An Australian Pelican gliding with its large wings extended]]
Pelicans swim well with their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub the backs of their heads on their [[preen gland]]s to pick up an oily secretion, which they transfer to their [[plumage]] to waterproof it.<ref name=NSS/> Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface.<ref name="beaman"/> They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter <U+2013> rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote [[evaporative cooling]].<ref name=hanzab1a/> They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.<ref name=hanzab1a/>

A fibrous layer deep in the breast muscles can hold the wings rigidly horizontal for gliding and soaring. Thus they use [[thermal]]s for soaring to heights of 3000&nbsp;m (10,000&nbsp;ft) or more,<ref name=ag/> combined both with gliding and with flapping flight in [[V formation|V-formation]], to commute distances of up to {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} to feeding areas.<ref name=NSS/> Pelicans also fly low (or "skim") over stretches of water, using a phenomenon known as [[Ground effect (aircraft)|ground effect]] to reduce [[Lift-induced drag|drag]] and increase [[Lift (force)|lift]]. As the air flows between the wings and the water surface it is compressed to a higher density and exerts a stronger upward force against the bird above.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loyno.edu/lucec/natural-history-writings/bird-flight-over-water|title=Bird Flight Over Water|last=Thomas|first=Bob|date=2 June 2011|work=College of Social Sciences Intranet |publisher=Center for Environmental Communication, Loyola University|accessdate=1 August 2012|location=New Orleans, Louisiana}}</ref> Hence substantial energy is saved while flying.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hainsworth|first=F.

Pelicans are [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] and nest colonially. Pairs are monogamous for a single season, but the pair bond extends only to the nesting area; mates are independent away from the nest. The ground-nesting (white) species have a complex communal courtship involving a group of males chasing a single female in the air, on land, or in the water while pointing, gaping, and thrusting their bills at each other. They can finish the process in a day. The tree-nesting species have a simpler process in which perched males advertise for females.<ref name=NSS/> The location of the breeding colony is constrained by the availability of an ample supply of fish to eat, although pelicans can use thermals to soar and commute for hundreds of kilometres daily to fetch food.<ref name=enc/>

The Australian Pelican has two reproductive strategies depending on the local degree of environmental predictability. Colonies of tens or hundreds, rarely thousands, of birds breed regularly on small coastal and subcoastal islands where food is seasonally or permanently available. In arid inland Australia, especially in the [[endorheic basin|endorheic]] [[Lake Eyre basin]], pelicans will breed opportunistically in very large numbers of up to 50,000 pairs, when irregular major floods, which may be many years apart, fill [[ephemeral]] [[salt lake]]s and provide large amounts of food for several months before drying out again.<ref name="ag">{{cite web |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/pelicans-in-australia.htm |title=Mysteries of the Australian pelican |accessdate=18 June 2012 |first=Julian |last=Reid |publisher=Australian Geographic |date=28 April 2010}}</ref>

In all species copulation takes place at the nest site; it begins shortly after pairing and continues for 3<U+2013>10&nbsp;days before egg-laying. The male brings the nesting material, in ground-nesting species (which may not build a nest) sometimes in the pouch, and in tree-nesting species crosswise in the bill. The female then heaps the material up to form a simple structure.<ref name=NSS/>

The eggs are oval, white and coarsely textured.<ref name=hanzab1a/> All species normally lay at least two eggs; the usual clutch size is one to three, rarely up to six.<ref name=hanzab1a/> Both sexes incubate with the eggs on top of or below the feet; they may display when changing shifts. Incubation takes 30<U+2013>36 days;<ref name=hanzab1a/> hatching success for undisturbed pairs can be as high as 95 percent but, because of sibling competition or [[siblicide]], in the wild usually all but one nestling dies within the first few weeks (later in the Pink-backed and Spot-billed species). Both parents feed their young. Small chicks are fed by [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]]; after about a week they are able to put their heads into their parent<U+2019>s pouch and feed themselves.<ref name="DofB">{{cite book| author = Campbell, Bruce; & Lack, Elizabeth.

Parents of ground-nesting species sometimes drag older young around roughly by the head before feeding them. From about 25 days old,<ref name=hanzab1a/> the young of these species gather in "pods" or "cr<U+00E8>ches" of up to 100 birds in which parents recognise and feed only their own offspring. By 6<U+2013>8&nbsp;weeks they wander around, occasionally swimming, and may practice communal feeding.<ref name=NSS/> Young of all species [[fledge]] 10<U+2013>12&nbsp;weeks after hatching. They may remain with their parents afterwards, but are now seldom or never fed. They are mature at three or four years old.<ref name=hanzab1a/> Overall breeding success is highly variable.<ref name=NSS/> Pelicans live for 15 to 25 years in the wild, although one reached an age of 54 years in captivity.<ref name=enc/>

==Status and conservation==

===Populations===
Globally, pelican populations are adversely affected by four main factors: declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution, destruction of habitat, direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies, hunting and culling, entanglement in fishing lines and hooks, and lastly the presence of pollutants such as DDT and endrin. Most species' populations are more or less stable, although three are classified by the IUCN as being at risk. All species breed readily in zoos, which is potentially useful for conservation management.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/0006-3207(84)90063-6}}</ref>

The combined population of Brown and Peruvian Pelicans is estimated at 650,000 birds, with around 250,000 in the United States and Caribbean, and 400,000 in Peru.{{efn|The US Government has not accepted the elevation of the two taxa into separate species.<ref name=FWS/>}} The [[National Audubon Society]] estimates the global population of the Brown Pelican at 300,000.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://birds.audubon.org/species-search/Brown%20Pelican |title=Brown Pelican |accessdate=9 August 2012 |work=Species profile |publisher=National Audubon Society}}</ref> Numbers of Brown Pelican plummeted in the 1950s and 1960s, largely as a consequence of environmental [[DDT]] pollution, and the species was listed as endangered in the US in 1970.

The Peruvian Pelican is listed as Near Threatened because, although the population is estimated by [[BirdLife International]] to exceed 500,000 mature individuals, and is possibly increasing, it has been much higher in the past. It declined dramatically during the 1998 [[El Ni<U+00F1>o<U+2013>Southern Oscillation|El Ni<U+00F1>o]] event and could suffer similar declines in the future. Conservation needs include regular monitoing throughout the range to determine population trends, particularly after El Ni<U+00F1>o years; restricting human access to important breeding colonies; and assessing interactions with fisheries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3816 |title=Peruvian Pelican |accessdate=7 August 2012 |work=BirdLife species factsheet |publisher=BirdLife International}}</ref>

The Spot-billed Pelican has an estimated population between 13,000 and 18,000 and is considered to be Near Threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Numbers declined substantially during the 20th century, one crucial factor being the eradication of the important [[Sittaung River|Sittaung valley]] breeding colony in Burma through deforestation and the loss of feeding sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3812 |title=Spot-billed Pelican |accessdate=11 August 2012 |work=Species factsheet |publisher=BirdLife International}}</ref> The chief threats it faces are from habitat loss and human disturbance but populations have mostly stabilised following increased protection in India and Cambodia.<ref name="iucnphillippenis">{{IUCN2010 |assessors=BirdLife International |year=2011 |id=106003812 |title=Pelecanus philippensis |version=2011.2 |downloaded=10 May 2012}}</ref>

The Pink-backed Pelican has a large population ranging over much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. In the absence of substantial threats or evidence of declines across its range, its conservation status is assessed as being of Least Concern. Regional threats include the drainage of wetlands and increasing disturbance in southern Africa. The species is susceptible to bioaccumulation of toxins and to the destruction of nesting trees by logging.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3810|title=Pink-backed Pelican |accessdate=7 August 2012 |work=BirdLife species factsheet |publisher=BirdLife International}}</ref>

The American White Pelican has increased in numbers,<ref name=Keith05/> with its population estimated at over 157,000 birds in 2005, becoming more numerous east of the continental divide while declining in the west.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=D.

Great White Pelicans range over a large area of Africa and southern Asia. The overall trend in numbers is uncertain, with a mix of regional populations that are increasing, declining, stable or unknown, but there is no evidence of rapid overall decline and the status of the species is assessed as being of Least Concern. Threats include the drainage of wetlands, persecution and sport hunting, disturbance at the breeding colonies, and contamination by pesticides and heavy metals.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3809|title=Great White Pelican |accessdate=7 August 2012 |work=BirdLife species factsheet |publisher=BirdLife International}}</ref>

The Dalmatian Pelican is the rarest species with a population estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 following massive declines in the 19th and 20th centuries. The main ongoing threats include hunting, especially in eastern Asia, disturbance, coastal development, collision with overhead power lines and the over-exploitation of fish stocks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3811 |title= Dalmatian Pelican |accessdate=9 August 2012 |work=Species factsheet |publisher=BirdLife International}}</ref> It is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as the population trend is downwards, especially in Mongolia where it is nearly extinct.

===Culling and disturbance===
Pelicans have been persecuted by humans for their perceived competition for fish, despite the fact that their diet overlaps little with fish caught by people.<ref name=Keith05/> Starting in the 1880s, American White Pelicans were clubbed and shot, their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed, and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management schemes and wetland drainage.<ref name=Keith05/> Even in the 21st century, an increase in the population of American White Pelicans in south-eastern Idaho in the US was seen to threaten the recreational [[cutthroat trout]] fishery there, leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and [[culling]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Management of American White Pelicans in Idaho.

Great White Pelicans on Dyer Island, in the Western Cape region of South Africa, were culled during the 19th century because their predation of the eggs and chicks of [[guano]]-producing seabirds was seen to threaten the livelihood of the guano collectors.<ref name=esr/> More recently, such predation at South African seabird colonies has impacted on the conservation of threatened seabird populations, especially Crowned Cormorants, Cape Cormorants and [[Bank Cormorant]]s. This has led to suggestions that pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies.<ref name=esr/>

Apart from habitat destruction and deliberate, targeted persecution, pelicans are vulnerable to disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers, photographers and other curious visitors. Human presence alone can cause the birds to accidentally displace or destroy their eggs, leave hatchlings exposed to predators and adverse weather, or even abandon their colonies completely.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.showFile&rep=file&fil=CodeofPractice.pdf |title= Code Of Practice for the Protection of the Dalmatian Pelican: |accessdate=3 August 2012 |work=Information leaflet |publisher=Life Natura Program}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/statewide/archive/2012/05/loving-em-to-death.shtml|title=Loving 'em to death |accessdate=3 August 2012 |work=Minnesota Today |first=Dan |last=Gunderson |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio |date=16 May 2012 }}</ref><ref name="cfgc07">{{cite book |title= Status Review of California Brown Pelican |author=Burkett, Esther; Logsdon, Randi J.; Fien, Kristi M. |year=2007 |series=California Fish and Game Commission Reports |publisher= U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Planning and Evaluation|url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/wildlife/nongame/publications/docs/BRPEStatusReviewJan0308.pdf }}</ref>

[[DDT]] pollution in the environment was a major cause of decline of Brown Pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic [[food web]], contaminating and [[Bioaccumulation|accumulating]] in several species, including one of the pelican<U+2019>s primary food fish <U+2013> the northern anchovy. Its [[metabolite]] [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] is a reproductive [[toxicant]] in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding Brown Pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.<ref name="usepa1980">{{cite book |title= National accomplishments in pollution control, 1970<U+2013>1980: some case histories|isbn=1236274539 |author=Anon |year=1980 |publisher= U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Planning and Evaluation|pages=183<U+2013>184}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/DDT_and_Birds.html |title=DDT and Birds |accessdate=6 August 2012 |author=Ehrlich, Paul R.; Dobkin, David S.; Wheye, Darryl |publisher=Stanford University |year=1988}}</ref>

In the late 1960s, following the major decline in Brown Pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide [[endrin]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&dat=19820428&id=075dAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Fl4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=3543,7071462|title= Bird species regroup with residue decline |accessdate=8 August 2012 |work=The Victoria Advocate: Julius Ermis<U+2019> Outdoors |author=Ermis, Julius |publisher=Google News |date=29 April 1982}}</ref> About 14,000 pelicans, including 7500 American White Pelicans, perished from [[botulism]] after eating fish from the [[Salton Sea]] in 1990.<ref name=Keith05/> In 1991 abnormal numbers of Brown Pelicans and [[Brandt's Cormorant]]s died at [[Santa Cruz, California]], when their food fish ([[anchovy|anchovies]]) were contaminated with [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] [[domoic acid]], produced by the [[diatom]] ''[[Pseudo-nitzschia]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Work, Thierry M.; Barr, Bradd; Beale, Allison M.; Fritz, Lawrence; Quilliam, Michael A.; Wright, Jeffrey L.C. |year=1993|title=Epidemiology of domoic acid poisoning in Brown Pelicans (''Pelecanus occidentalis'') and Brandt's Cormorants (''Phalacrocorax penicillatus'') in California|jstor=20460314 |journal=Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=54<U+2013>62}}</ref>

As waterbirds that feed on fish, pelicans are highly susceptible to [[oil spill]]s, both directly by being oiled and by the impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that, during the previous 20 years, some 500<U+2013>1000 Brown Pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California.<ref name=cfgc07/> A 2011 report by the [[Center for Biological Diversity]], a year after the April 2010 [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], said that 932 Brown Pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed as a result of the spill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_and_gas/gulf_oil_spill/pdfs/GulfWildlifeReport_2011.pdf |title=A Deadly Toll |accessdate=6 August 2012 |work=Report |publisher=Center for Biological Diversity |date= April 2011}}</ref>

Where pelicans interact with fishers, through either sharing the same waters or scavenging for fishing refuse, they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded fishing lines. [[Fish hook]]s are swallowed or catch in the skin of the pouch or webbed feet, and strong [[monofilament fishing line]] can become wound around bill, wings or legs, resulting in crippling, starvation, and often death. Local rescue organisations have been established in North America and Australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sbwcn.org/#!news-&-events/vstc3=pelican-crisis |title=The Brown Pelican Crisis|accessdate=5 August 2012 |work=News and Events |publisher= Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://collier.ifas.ufl.edu/SeaGrant/pubs/PelicanPub.pdf |title=Quick Reference for Rescuing Hooked Pelicans |accessdate=5 August 2012 |publisher=University of Florida}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= The Impact of Recreational Fishing on Estuarine Birdlife on the Far North Coast of New South Wales |author=Ferris, Lance; Ferris, Rochelle |year=2004 |publisher=Australian Seabird Rescue |location=Ballina, New South Wales |url= https://www.box.com/shared/8fcmrpsvobv8y7yg0uap }}</ref>

===Parasites and disease===
As with other bird families, pelicans are susceptible to a variety of [[parasitism|parasites]]. Specialist [[bird louse|feather lice]] of the genus ''Piagetella'' are found in the pouches of all species of pelican, but are otherwise only known from New World and Antarctic cormorants. [[Avian malaria]] is carried by the [[mosquito]] ''Culex pipens'', and high densities of these biting insects may force pelican colonies to be abandoned. [[Leech]]es may attach to the [[cloaca|vent]] or sometimes the inside of the pouch.<ref name="Rothschild ">{{cite book |title= Fleas, Flukes and Cuckoos. A Study of Bird Parasites |author= [[Miriam Rothschild|Rothschild, Miriam]]; Clay, Theresa |year= 1953 |publisher= Collins |location= London |pages = 32, 121, 147, 215 |url= http://archive.org/details/fleasflukescucko017900mbp |accessdate=29 June 2012}}</ref> A study of the parasites of the American White Pelican found 75 different species, including [[cestoda|tapeworms]], [[trematoda|flukes]], [[fly|flies]], [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s and [[nematode]]s. Many of these do little harm, but flies may be implicated in the death of nestlings, particularly if they are weak or unwell, and the [[Argasidae|soft tick]] ''Ornithodoros capensis'' sometimes causes adults to desert the nest. Many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups, but several [[louse|lice]] are very [[host (biology)|host-specific]].<ref name= overstreet/>

Healthy pelicans can usually cope with their lice, but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals, which hastens their demise. The pouch louse ''Piagetiella peralis'', which occurs in the pouch and therefore cannot be removed by preening, is usually not a serious problem, even when present in such numbers that it covers the whole interior of the pouch, but sometimes inflammation and bleeding may harm the host.<ref name="overstreet">{{cite journal | last= Overstreet | first= Robin M. | coauthors= Curran, Stephen S. | year=2005 | title= Parasites of the American White Pelican | journal= Gulf and Caribbean Research | volume= 17 |pages= 31<U+2013>48 | url =http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=parasitologyfacpubs&sei-redir=1 |format =PDF}}</ref> The Brown Pelican has a similarly extensive range of parasites.

The pelican (''Henet'' in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]) was associated in [[Ancient Egypt]] with death and the [[afterlife]]. It was depicted in art on the walls of tombs, and figured in [[funeral|funerary]] texts, as a protective symbol against snakes. Henet was also referred to in the [[Pyramid Texts]] as the "mother of the king" and thus seen as a goddess. References in non-royal funerary [[papyrus|papyri]] show that the pelican was believed to possess the ability to prophesy safe passage in the [[underworld]] for someone who had died.<ref>{{cite book| author = Hart, George| title = The Routledge Dictionary Of Egyptian Gods And Goddesses| series = Routledge Dictionaries| year = 2005| publisher = Routledge| location = Abingdon, United Kingdom| isbn = 978-0-415-34495-1| page = 125 }}</ref>

An [[Myth of origins|origin myth]] from the [[Murri people]] of [[Queensland]], cited by [[Andrew Lang]], describes how the Australian Pelican acquired its black and white plumage. The pelican, formerly a black bird, made a canoe during a flood in order to save drowning people. He fell in love with a woman he thus saved, but she and her friends tricked him and escaped. The pelican consequently prepared to go to war against them by daubing himself with white clay as war paint. However, before he had finished, another pelican, on seeing such a strange piebald creature, killed him with its beak, and all such pelicans have been black and white ever since.<ref>{{cite book| author = Lang, Andrew| title = Myth, Ritual & Religion, Volume 1| year = 1887 (reprinted 2005)| publisher = Cosimo Inc| location = New York, New York| isbn = 978-1-59605-204-8| pages = 140<U+2013>41 }}</ref>

===Christianity===
In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe, the pelican was thought to be particularly attentive to her young, to the point of providing her own blood by wounding her own breast when no other food was available. As a result, the pelican came to symbolise the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of Jesus and the [[Eucharist]],<ref>{{cite book| author = Gauding, Madonna| title = The Signs and Symbols Bible: The Definitive Guide to Mysterious Markings| url = http://books.google.com/?id=SImTll3uupIC| accessdate = 29 June 2012| year = 2009| publisher = Sterling Publishing Company| location = New York, New York| isbn = 1402770049| page = 263 }}</ref> and usurped the image of the lamb and the flag.<ref name="mcgrath">{{cite book| author = McGrath, Alister E.| authorlink = Alister McGrath| title = In the beginning: the story of the King James Bible and how it changed a nation, a language and a culture| url = http://books.google.com/?id=kcPkMxCWcZQC| accessdate = 29 June 2012| origyear = 2002| year = 2012| publisher = Anchor Books, a Division of Random House, Inc| location = New York| isbn = 1444745263 }}</ref> A reference to this mythical characteristic is contained for example in the hymn by [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], "[[Adoro te devote]]" or "Humbly We Adore Thee", where in the penultimate verse he describes Christ as the "loving divine pelican, able to provide nourishment from his breast".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marajoy.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/better-translation-please-vote.html |title=Adore Te Devote |author=Joy, Mara |accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref><!-- The mention of the pelican is in the extra verse included in the comments.--> [[Elizabeth I of England]] adopted the symbol, portraying herself as the "mother of the Church of England".

The self-sacrificial aspect of the pelican was reinforced by the widely read mediaeval [[bestiary|bestiaries]]. The device of "a pelican in her piety" or "a pelican vulning (from Latin ''vulno'' to wound) herself" was used in [[heraldry]]. An older version of the myth is that the pelican used to kill its young then resurrect them with its blood, again analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus. Likewise a folktale from [[India]] says that a pelican killed her young by rough treatment but was then so contrite that she resurrected them with her own blood.<ref name=NSS/>

The legends of self-wounding and the provision of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill. In reality, it often presses this onto its chest in order to fully empty the pouch. Another possible derivation is the tendency of the bird to rest with its bill on its breast; the Dalmatian Pelican has a blood-red pouch in the early breeding season and this may have contributed to the myth.<ref name=NSS/>

====Heraldry====
Pelicans have featured extensively in [[heraldry]], generally using the Christian symbolism of the pelican as a caring and self-sacrificing parent. The image became linked to the medieval religious feast of Corpus Christi. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge each have colleges named for the religious festival nearest the dates of their establishment,<ref name=mcgrath/><!-- cites previous three sentences--> and both [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]],<ref name="Corpus">{{cite web|url=http://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/about-corpus/maps-and-tours/take-a-virtual-tour/199|title=College Crest|publisher=Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |year=2011 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref> and [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], feature pelicans on their coats of arms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccc.ox.ac.uk/Home/ |title=Corpus Christi |publisher=Corpus Christi College, Oxford |accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref>
