:''For a statistical breakdown by season, see [[Gillingham F.C. seasons]]''
[[Gillingham F.C.]] is an [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]], [[Kent]].  The '''history of Gillingham F.C.''' covers the years from the club's formation to the present day.  The club was formed in [[1893 in football (soccer)|1893]], and played in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] until [[1920 in football (soccer)|1920]], when that league's top division was absorbed into the [[Football League]] as its new Division Three.  The club was voted out of the league in favour of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] at the end of the [[1937-38 in English football|1937&ndash;38]] season, but returned 12 years later, when that league was expanded from 88 to 92 clubs. 

Twice in the late 1980s Gillingham came close to winning promotion to the second tier of English football, but a decline then set in and in [[1993 in football (soccer)|1993]] the club narrowly avoided relegation to the [[Football Conference]].  In [[2000 in football (soccer)|2000]], the "Gills" reached the second tier of the English league for the first time in the club's history and went on to spend five seasons at this level, achieving a club record highest league finish of eleventh place in [[2002-03 in English football|2002<U+2013>03]].  The only honour the club has won at a professional level was the [[Football League Fourth Division]] championship in [[1963-64 in English football|1963&ndash;64]].

New Brompton joined the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] upon its creation in 1894, being placed in Division Two because it was one of the last clubs to be invited to join the league. Upon joining the league, New Brompton turned [[professional]], with the players agreeing to be paid 12 [[shilling]]s per match, and promptly won the Division Two championship in the [[1894-95 in English football|1894&ndash;95]] season.
