The '''Wayne Fitzgerell State Recreation Area''' is a 3,300-acre (13.4 km<U+00B2>) state park bordering [[Rend Lake]] near [[Benton, Illinois]].  The state park is managed by the [[Illinois Department of Natural Resources]] to concentrate on shoreline recreation, including [[boating]], [[fishing]], and [[picnicking]].

After Rend Lake was completed by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1970, much of the land acquired by the Army Corps for dam and reservoir construction was available for open-space use.  Starting in [[1975]], the Army Corps leased the Wayne Fitzgerell parcel of land to the state of Illinois.  The state park is named for Wayne Fitzgerell, a member of the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] from nearby [[Wayne County, Illinois|Wayne County]] in the 70th through 74th General Assemblies.  Fitzgerell had been one of the local leaders who had called for the damming of the [[Big Muddy River]] and creation of Rend Lake.

Wayne Fitzgerell was originally dedicated as a state park but changed its name in the 1990s to reflect its identity as a space managed for [[sportsmen]].  1,000 acres (4.0 km<U+00B2>) of the park is consciously managed for the hunting of [[deer]], upland birds such as [[pheasant]]s, and small game.   

The park is a focus of public access to Rend Lake, which is managed for the fishing of [[largemouth bass]], [[bluegill]], [[channel catfish]], and [[crappie]].

Wayne Fitzgerell is one of the few state parks in Illinois which is bisected by a limited-access highway, [[Interstate 57]].  Many visitors to the park use I-57's Exit 77, near the park's headquarters at [[Whittington, Illinois]].
