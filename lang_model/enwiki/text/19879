'''12 Squadron''' was a [[South African Air Force]] squadron that served in World War II in East Africa and the Western Desert as a medium bomber squadron. After the war, the squadron was used in various roles, including that of a helicopter squadron until 1963 when it was equipped with Canberra light bombers - remaining a light bomber and reconnaissance squadron until disbanded in 1990.
