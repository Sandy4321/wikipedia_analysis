[[Image:02matt4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Matt in Digimon Adventure 02 (season 2)]]
In the sequel, ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]'', Matt appears less frequently due to relinquishing his abilities to [[Davis Motomiya]], but still volunteers when needed.<ref name="toei2" /> Taking place roughly four years after ''Digimon Adventure'' (three years in the original version), Matt is now in tenth grade and fifteen years old (eighth grade and fourteen years old in the original version). He is in the same class as [[Yolei Inoue|Yolei's]] second oldest sister. Near the end of the series, Matt falls in love with [[Sora Takenouchi|Sora]], and in the epilogue they are married with a daughter and a son, both of whom are partnered with a [[Yokomon]] and [[Tsunomon]] respectively. He has also become an [[astronaut]] with Gabumon.

===In the video games===
Matt makes a cameo as a [[non-playable character]] in the [[WonderSwan]] game ''[[Digimon Adventure: Anode/Cathode Tamer]]'', where he is captured by [[Milleniummon]] and jailed with [[Joe Kido|Joe]] and [[Hikari "Kari" Kamiya|Kari]] until [[Ryo Akiyama]] comes to their rescue.

When the film featurette release of ''Digimon Hurricane Landing!'' and its second part, ''Supreme Evolution! The Golden Digimentals'', which also made the third part of ''Digimon: The Movie'', Matt is captured by [[Wendigomon]] during his search for Willis and is de-aged until Davis and Willis defeat him. Due to ''Digimon Hurricane Landing!/Supreme Evolution!

===In the CD dramas===
Matt is featured in supplementary audio dramas released on CD during the television series' run, most of which consist miscellaneous adventures with the other DigiDestined that do not relate to the overall plot of the show. These include Matt being trapped in T.K.'s dream during New Years <ref name="audio1">{{cite video |people= |date=January 7, 2000 |title=Digimon Adventure: Character Song + Mini Drama 3 |url= |format=CDA |medium= |language=Japanese |publisher=King Records |location=Japan |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2011-01-22 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> and tap dancing to distract [[Boltmon]] on [[Valentine's Day]].<ref name="audio2">{{cite video |people= |date=February 7, 2001 |title=Digimon Adventure 02: Michi he no Armor Shinka |url= |format=CDA |medium= |language=Japanese |publisher=King Records |location=Japan |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2011-01-22 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>

Unlike the other characters, Matt was given his own audio drama CD, titled {{nihongo|''Digimon Adventure 02: Yamato Ishida: Tegami ~Letter~''|<U+30C7><U+30B8><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30A2><U+30C9><U+30D9><U+30F3><U+30C1><U+30E3><U+30FC><U+FF10><U+FF12><U+3000><U+77F3><U+7530><U+30E4><U+30DE><U+30C8><U+3000><U+624B><U+7D19>~Letter~|Dejimon Adobench<U+0101> Zero Ts<U+016B> Ishida Yamato Tegami ~Letter~}}, which was released on March 7, 2001.

==Development==
Matt's character was designed for the pilot movie storyboard by [[Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru]]. In an exclusive interview released with the ''Digimon Adventure'' DVD box on December 21, 2007, producer [[Satoru Nishizono]] revealed that as the staff had agreed on deciding Tai's name, he had tried to name the other characters similarly with [[kanji]] that related to "luck." <ref name="staff1">{{cite web | url=http://digitalscratch.wordpress.com/2009/08/01/interview-memories-of-da-pt-6 | title=Memories of Our Digimon Adventure, Part 6 | accessdate=2010-12-26}}</ref>

[[Jeff Nimoy]], co-screenwriter of the English version of ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' and ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]'', noted that if there were anything he could change about Matt, it would be making him "less indecisive", citing his complication of adapting the script of the scene where Matt confronts his feelings in a cave with Gabumon.<ref name="nimoy">{{cite web | url=http://withthewill.net/index.php?topic=1647.msg26999#msg26999 | title=Jeff Nimoy - Information, Post Your Questions, and Answers | date=2006-12-23 | accessdate=2011-01-22}}</ref>

In Japan, excluding the pilot film ''Digimon Adventure'', all of Matt's appearances were voiced by [[Y<U+016B>to Kazama]],<ref name="toei1" /> although he auditioned for Gabumon and [[Joe Kido|Joe]].<ref name="voice">{{cite web | url=http://digitalscratch.wordpress.com/2009/08/01/interview-memories-of-da-pt-2 | title=Memories of Our Digimon Adventure, Part 2 | accessdate=2010-12-26}}</ref> [[Masami Kikuchi]] auditioned for Matt, but was casted as [[Joe Kido|Joe]] instead.<ref name="voice2">{{cite web | url=http://digitalscratch.wordpress.com/2009/08/01/interview-memories-of-da-pt-4 | title=Memories of Our Digimon Adventure, Part 4 | accessdate=2010-12-26}}</ref> At first, Kazama felt that he couldn't voice a "pretty boy character" like Matt, but later discovered he related to him and ultimately felt as though he "lived as [him]."<ref name="voice" />

In the English dub, [[Michael Reisz]] provides his voice.

==Merchandise==
