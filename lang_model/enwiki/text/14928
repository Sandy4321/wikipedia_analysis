'''Saginaw Trail''' is the collective name for a set of connected roads in Southeastern Michigan that runs from [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] to [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]] through [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] and [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]]. It was originally a foot trail created by the [[Sac (people)|Sauk]] Tribe. On December 7, 1818 the [[Michigan Territory|Michigan Territorial government]] authorized the building of a road from Detroit to Saginaw along the trail. The road has gone through a number of designation changes in the last two centuries, both in name and number. Since the Michigan portion of [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]] (I-75) was completed in 1973, it has been a secondary route. 

Today, drivers can follow the path of the Saginaw Trail starting with Woodward Avenue in Detroit north to Genesee Avenue in Saginaw. It is currently state-maintained as different sections of [[Michigan highway system|state trunkline highways]] bearing the designations [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|M-1]], [[U.S. Route 24 in Michigan|US Highway 24]] (US&nbsp;24) and [[M-54 (Michigan highway)|M-54]]. Other sections are maintained as county roads or city streets. Several landmarks can be found on these roads, and numerous historical events have taken place on them. The road has also been featured in some films and TV shows.

==History==
===The original trail===
====Sauk Tribal foot path====
The [[Sac (people)|Sauk]] tribe may have had their original territory along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. However, migration patterns of other tribes drove them to [[Michigan]] around [[Saginaw Bay]].  Due to the yellow clay soils found around Saginaw Bay, their self-designation became ''O<U+03B8>aakiiwaki'' which is often interpreted to mean "yellow-earth".  The [[Ojibwa|Ojibwe]] and [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]] name for the tribe is ''Ozaagii'', meaning "Those at the Outlet", whence they were known by the French as "Sac" or by the English as "Sauk".  With the [[Anishinaabe]] expansion and [[Huron]]s attempts at gaining regional stability, the Sauks were driven away by the [[Huron]]s armed with French weapons. The Sauk then occupied territory in parts of what are now northern [[Illinois]] and [[Wisconsin]].<ref name=>{{cite web |author= Sultzman, Lee |url=http://www.tolatsga.org/sf.html |title=Sauk and Fox History |work=First Nations Histories |date=November 24, 1999 |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref>

The Sauk tribe created an unnamed foot trail from Detroit to Saginaw. When European settlers arrived, they too began using the trail, which they dubbed the Saginaw Trail. These settlers determined the government should modernize it for the use of their horses and carriages. The name Saginaw is believed to mean "where the Sauk were" in the [[Ojibwe language]], which is used by the [[Chippewa]] tribe.<ref name="barnett"/>

====Government builds a road====
The Michigan Territorial Legislature approved the building of the Saginaw Turnpike (also called the Detroit<U+2013>Saginaw Turnpike) on December 7, 1818. Michigan Territory Governor [[Lewis Cass]] established by proclamation on December 15, 1819 the building of the section from Saginaw to Pontiac. The Legislature approved the request to build the southern half, from Pontiac to Detroit, on June 22, 1822. However, the Michigan government could not find the needed money in its budget to do so. Therefore, in 1826, the Michigan Territory asked for federal money to do so. After months of consideration, the federal government approved the request on March 2, 1827. The Detroit to Flint section was finished in 1833, and the Flint to Saginaw half was finished in 1841.<ref name="barnett"/>

====Private ownership====
In 1848 and 1850, the Michigan government determined it was too expensive to maintain the road, and therefore turned it over to a private plank company who kept it up, in return for tolls to travel on it.<ref name="barnett"/>
Tolls on the road were regulated by the state legislature. A charge of two cents a mile was made for a wagon or carriage drawn by two horses, and one cent a mile for every sled or sleigh so drawn. If more than two horses were used, an additional charge of three-quarters of a cent per mile for each additional animal was levied. A toll of one cent per mile was made for a vehicle drawn by one horse, as well as for a horse and rider. Tolls of one-half cent a mile were levied for every score of sheep or swine; for every score of "neat cattle," two cents a mile.<ref>[[#Mason|Mason]]</ref> Sixty years later in 1910, the leases expired and the road was turned back over to state control, at which time all fees were lifted.<ref name="barnett"/>

===State controls the road again===

In 1909, Woodward Avenue between Six Mile Road and Seven Mile Road became the first mile (1.6&nbsp;km) of paved highway in the United States. In 1916, the {{convert|27|mi|km|adj=on}} portion of Woodward from Detroit to Pontiac was paved. The nation's first tri-colored traffic light was installed on Woodward in 1919.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_Woodward_Heart_and_Soul_170072_7.pdf |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Woodward Avenue: A Road to the Heart and Soul of America |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |format=PDF}}</ref> Portions of the trail were part of the [[Dixie Highway]] from 1915 to 1927.<ref>{{cite map |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dixie_Highway_Map.gif |title=Outline of the Dixie Highway |publisher=Dixie Highway Association |date=1922 |accessdate=March 14, 2009}}</ref> From 1919-1926, the trail was designated [[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]].<ref name="MSHD19">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=State of Michigan: Lower Peninsula |url= http://maps.lib.msu.edu/miroadmaps/1919-lp.htm |year=1919 |cartography= MSHD |accessdate=March 2, 2008 }}</ref>

Starting in 1926, when the [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Highway System]] was created, [[U.S. Route 10 in Michigan|US&nbsp;10]] ran along the trail. The section between Downtown Flint and Saginaw also carried [[U.S. Route 23 in Michigan|US&nbsp;23]].<ref name="USH">{{cite map| publisher=[[Bureau of Public Roads]] |title=United States System of Highways |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:1926us.jpg |year=1926 |accessdate=May 10, 2008}}</ref> In 1928, the segment between Dort Highway's northern terminus and Dort Highway's former southern terminus was changed to [[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]], which was the second incarnation of M-10.<ref name="MSHD29-05">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=May 1, 1929 |cartography= MSHD }}</ref> In 1941 or 1942, that designation of M-10 was changed to [[U.S. Route 10 Business (Flint, Michigan)|Business US&nbsp;10]] (BUS&nbsp;US&nbsp;10).<ref name="MSHD42-06">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=1942 Official Michigan Highway Map |year=June 1, 1942 |edition=Summer |cartography=Rand McNally |section=}}</ref> In 1957, US&nbsp;23 was moved from the trail to its current route.<ref name="MSHD57-10">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=1957 Official Highway Map |year=October 1, 1957 |section=}}</ref>

Several changes were made to the Saginaw Trail in 1962. US&nbsp;10 and BUS&nbsp;US&nbsp;10 were removed from I-75 exit 106 to Dort Highway's northern terminus. M-54 opened, running along Saginaw Street between I-75 exit 106, through Grand Blanc to Dort Highway's former southern terminus. Saginaw Street between Dort Highway's former southern terminus and northern terminus was renamed BUS&nbsp;M-54. The designation of US&nbsp;10 between the former southern terminus of M-54 and Clarkston was moved to the new I-75 freeway.<ref name="MSHD62">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Map |year= 1962 |section=}}</ref><ref name="MSHD63">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Map |year=1963 |section=}} </ref>

In 1970, US&nbsp;10 was moved between Pontiac and Detroit, and Woodward Avenue was redesignated as M-1. US&nbsp;10 was routed along the [[M-10 (Michigan highway)|Lodge Freeway]] and [[Telegraph Road (Michigan)|Telegraph Road]].<ref name="MDSH70">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of State Highways |title=Official Highway Map |year=1970 |scale=1 in.:14.5 mi. |section=}}</ref><ref name="MDSH71">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of State Highways |title=Official Highway Map |year=1971 |scale=1 in.:14.5 mi. |section=}}</ref> The BUS&nbsp;M-54 signs were removed in 1984 along Saginaw Street.<ref name="MDOT84">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Transportation Map |year=1984 |scale=1 in.:14.5 mi./1 in.:23 km. |section=}}</ref><ref name="MDOT85">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Transportation Map |year=1985 |scale=1 in.:14.5 mi./1 in.:23 km. |section=}}</ref> US&nbsp;10 was truncated in 1986, removing the designation from the highway system south of Bay City.<ref name="MDOT86">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Transportation Map |year=1986 |scale=1 in.:14.5 mi./1 in.:23 km. |section=}}</ref><ref name="MDOT87">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Transportation Map |year=1987 |scale=1 in.:14.5 mi./1 in.:23 km. |section=}}</ref> The section of M-54 from Dort Highway's former southern terminus was rerouted along a new extension and M-54 no longer ran along Saginaw Street through Grand Blanc like it did previously, making its current southern terminus at I-75 exit 109 in 1987.<ref name="MDOT87"/><ref name="MDOT88">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Department of Transportation Map |year=1988 |scale=1 in.:14.5 mi./1 in.:23 km. |section=}}</ref>

==Route description==
===Wayne County===
[[Image:Tigers opening day2 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Comerica Park]] in Downtown Detroit is near the trail]]
[[Image:Detroitfox3.jpg|thumb|The historic [[Fox Theatre (Detroit, Michigan)|Fox Theatre]] is on Woodward]]
The old Saginaw Trail is known as [[Woodward Avenue]] (M-1) in [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]]. Woodward Avenue starts in [[Downtown_Detroit#Downtown|Downtown Detroit]] at [[Jefferson Avenue]] near the [[Renaissance Center]], the world headquarters of the [[General Motors Corporation]]. From this starting point, the street runs northwesterly through Downtown Detroit, passing through [[Campus Martius Park]] and Grand Circus Park. The north side of the latter park is on Adams Avenue, which marks the start of the [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|M-1]] designation and state maintenance. The historic [[Fox Theatre (Detroit, Michigan)|Fox Theatre]], which was built in 1928, is on Woodward Avenue, and next door to it is [[The Fillmore Detroit]], a concert venue. Across the street is [[Comerica Park]], home of the [[Detroit Tigers]].  Next to it is [[Ford Field]], home of the [[Detroit Lions]]. Both sports venues are west of Woodward Avenue, between Adams and the [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]] freeway. <ref name="google"/> Further north is the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].

Woodward Avenue continues northwesterly crossing through the campus of [[Wayne State University]] and the city of [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]] before re-entering Detroit at McNichols Road, which occupies the 6 Mile location in the [[Mile Road System (Detroit)|Mile Road System]] in Detroit. At [[8 Mile Road]], Woodward Avenue crosses out of Detroit for the final time near the State Fairgrounds into [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] and [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]].<ref name="MDOT09D">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Department of Transportation Map |year=2009 |scale= 1&nbsp;in.:2.5&nbsp;mi/1&nbsp;cm:1.75&nbsp;km |inset=Detroit area}}</ref>

Woodward Avenue in Detroit has been mentioned in popular culture several times, such as in the season-6 episode of the Detroit-based 1990s sitcom ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' titled "My Son, the Driver". The character [[Brad Taylor|Brad]] mentions he was "rear-ended over on Woodward".<ref name="HI">{{cite episode |title=My Son, the Driver |url= |series=Home Improvement |serieslink=Home Improvement (TV series) |credits= Gelman, Laurie (writer); Tsao, Andrew (director) |network=ABC |airdate=April 1, 1997  |season=6 |number=20 |minutes= |transcript= |transcripturl=}}</ref> Woodward is also known internationally for its annual "Woodward Dream Cruise" in which classic car enthusiasts showcase their vehicles.<ref name="WDC">{{cite web |url=http://www.woodwarddreamcruise.com/faq.php |title=Dream Cruise FAQ |publisher= Woodward Dream Cruise, Inc |date=2010 |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref>

===Oakland County===
Woodward Avenue continues north toward Pontiac. It passes through the suburbs of Ferndale, [[Royal Oak, Michigan|Royal Oak]], [[Birmingham, Michigan|Birmingham]] and [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills]]. Royal Oak is the location of the John Almon Starr House which is adjacent to the original trail.<ref name="ashlee"/> In Bloomfield Hills, the M-1 designation ends at Square Lake Road. Woodward Avenue continues north into downtown [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] as part of [[Interstate 75 Business (Pontiac, Michigan)|Business Loop I-75]] (BL&nbsp;I-75) and [[U.S. Route 24 Business (Pontiac, Michigan)|BUS&nbsp;US&nbsp;24]]. Through downtown, the highway splits along two streets of a [[one-way pair]], using Woodward Avenue northbound and Wide Track Drive southbound. BL&nbsp;I-75 turns off along Perry Street, and BUS&nbsp;US&nbsp;24 continues north along Oakland Avenue northbound and Cass Avenue southbound. The two streets merge together along Oakland Avenue north of Montcalm Street. North of Kennett Road, the street name changes to Dixie Highway.<ref name="google">{{Google maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Woodward+Ave+%26+Jefferson+Ave,+Detroit,+MI+48226&daddr=MI-1%2FWoodward+Ave+to:Lothrop+Ave+to:MI-1%2FWoodward+Ave+to:MI-1%2FWoodward+Ave+to:MI-1%2FN+Woodward+Ave+to:US-24+to:Dixie+Hwy+to:Grand+Mall%2FS+Saginaw+Rd+to:S+Saginaw+St+to:N+Saginaw+St+to:MI-54%2FN+Saginaw+Rd+to:Dixie+Hwy+to:E+Genesee+Ave+to:43.435003,-83.948722&hl=en&geocode=%3BFfwvhgIdMKAM-w%3BFayJhgId8WIM-w%3BFdrDhwIddI8L-w%3BFYRkiAIdPgwL-w%3BFQDiiQIdKLAJ-w%3BFco5iwIdxuYH-w%3BFRuRjQIdyPME-w%3BFaSxjgIdklAE-w%3BFeYYkAIdgCwD-w%3BFU77kAIdBO8C-w%3BFf0hkwId8WQC-w%3BFV7zlAIdTgUB-w%3BFbcKlgIdFL7_-g%3B&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=14&sz=15&via=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13&rtol=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13&sll=43.439584,-83.941898&sspn=0.019881,0.029011&ie=UTF8&ll=42.938329,-83.62793&spn=1.282847,1.856689&z=9 |accessdate=March 15, 2009}}</ref>

Dixie Highway was named as a part of the original [[auto trail]] of the [[Dixie Highway|same name]]. When the road meets [[Telegraph Road (Michigan)|Telegraph Road]], it loses the BUS&nbsp;US&nbsp;24 designation in favor of US&nbsp;24. Dixie Highway, and the Saginaw Trail, pass a number of lakes north of Pontiac before meeting I-75 in [[Independence Township, Michigan|Independence Township]] at exit 93. This is the eastern end of US&nbsp;24, which runs {{convert|2478|mi|km|0}}, all the way from [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. Dixie Highway continues northwesterly and parallels I-75, using roadway that was once US&nbsp;10. The grounds for the annual [[Michigan Renaissance Festival]], which is unofficially dubbed "Hollygrove" for the festival, are located on Dixie Highway in both [[Holly Township, Michigan|Holly Township]] and [[Groveland Township, Michigan|Groveland Township]]. The festival grounds was the primary shooting location of the 2009 [[romantic comedy film]] ''[[All's Faire in Love]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2008/09/local_residents_getting_in_on.html|title=Local residents getting in on movie-making action at Renaissance Festival|last=Azizian|first=Carol|date=September 20, 2008|work=The Flint Journal |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> Mount Holly Ski Area is also located on Dixie Highway in Holly Township.
