===Sheffield Wednesday===
Hemmingham started playing music at football matches in 1993 when he took a bugle to a Sheffield Wednesday match away at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]'s [[Goodison Park]] and played the fanfare to [[Aida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://englandfans.thefa.com/ef/pages/news.aspx?id=45636dd8-a94b-444a-97a3-c6bee0e4d081 |title=Band Aid |publisher=The Football Association |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> The action was noticed by local newspapers and after a phone call to Hemmingham from Sheffield Wednesday manager, [[Trevor Francis]],<ref name=fl /> Sheffield Wednesday then hired Hemmingham and group of Sheffield Wednesday supporters to form an official club band which became known as the "''Kop Band''".<ref>{{cite web|author=Duleep Allirajah |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000002D3E3.htm |title=The Sheffield Wednesday Kop Band banned |publisher=Spiked Online |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> Although the band became popular, Hemmingham and the Kop Band have been banned from [[Steel City derby]] rivals [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]'s stadium, [[Bramall Lane]] a number of times. In 2002, they were banned from Bramall Lane because Sheffield United were concerned that playing music might lead to "unsafe crowd movement" and "unacceptable structural movement" by Sheffield United's safety officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3A+BRASSED+OFF+BAND.-a082280522 |title=Brassed off Band. |publisher=''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' (The Free Library) |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> In 2007, they were also banned because it was claimed by Sheffield United officials that playing music might cause structural damage to the stands to which, Hemmingham led criticism of it calling the ban "laughable".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/120431/.html |title=All the top football stories |work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |date=2007-08-03 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>

== Football administration ==
Hemmingham first started in football administration as the chief executive of an independent supporters group called The Owls Trust, which he helped establish, in 2001.<ref name=chad /> The Owls Trust was disliked by many Sheffield Wednesday fans and by Sheffield Wednesday chairman [[Dave Allen (football chairman)|Dave Allen]] as it was perceived that it was a vehicle leading towards a takeover by [[Ken Bates]] as The Owls Trust controlled a large amount of shares and Hemmingham had publicly stated support for Bates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_wed/3696187.stm |title=Owls ambition drives Bates |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2004-05-10 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> 

After an attempted [[boardroom coup]] by The Owls Trust to remove Allen from the chairmanship in an [[extraordinary general meeting]] in October 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_wed/3763914.stm |title=Trust seek to oust Owls chairman |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2004-10-21 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> in 2005, The Owls Trust were evicted from their offices at [[Hillsborough Stadium]], Hemmingham was banned from executive areas of the stadium<ref>{{cite web|author=Amy Lawrence |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2004/nov/07/newsstory.sport4 |title=The game that ate itself |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=2004-11-07 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> and The Kop Band was asked to reduce its numbers by Allen.
