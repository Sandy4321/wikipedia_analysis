==Bottle history==
The three generations of the bottle are shown to the right. The first generation is an 11 oz. [[cone (geometry)|conical]] bottle and the second generation is a 14 oz. tapered [[cylindrical]] bottle with different mod designs on each flavour's bottle. In 2006 the bottle received a third design that is once again clear and has textured maple leaves around the top. This bottle's labels also feature "Canadian" definitions of distinctly Canadian terms. All have an [[aluminium|aluminum]] screw-on cap with built-in [[tamper-proof]] (the lower portion of the cap breaks when opened).
