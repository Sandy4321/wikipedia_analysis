{{For|the dam in Oklahoma|Fort Gibson Dam}}

'''Gibson Dam''' is a concrete arch dam on the [[Sun River]], a tributary of the [[Missouri River]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} west of [[Great Falls, Montana]] in the [[United States]]. Located on the eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]], the dam was built by the [[U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]] (USBR) between 1926 and 1929 as part of the Sun River Project to develop about {{convert|93000|acre|ha}} of irrigated land in the Sun River Valley.

==Specifications==
The dam is a {{convert|199|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|960|ft|m|abbr=on}} long arch gravity structure, with a base thickness of {{convert|115|ft|m|abbr=on}} tapering to {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} at the crest. As a whole the dam contains about {{convert|167500|yd3|m3|abbr=on}} of concrete.<ref name="dimensions"/> The impounded water forms [[Gibson Reservoir]], which can store up to {{convert|96477|acre feet|m3|abbr=on}} at full water levels of {{convert|4724|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="hydro"/> When full, the reservoir covers {{convert|1296|acre|ha|abbr=on}}, with a shoreline of roughly {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} and a maximum depth of {{convert|195|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="hydro"/><ref name="MTFWP">{{cite web

Gibson Dam's main function is to capture spring snowmelt and release it during summer for the irrigation for about {{convert|81000|acre|ha}} of land on the north side of the Sun River and {{convert|10150|acre|ha}} south of the river. Water released from Gibson travels downstream for about {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} before it is intercepted by the Sun River Diversion Dam, which diverts water into the Pishkun Supply Canal, which sends water to the [[offstream reservoir|offstream]] Pishkun Reservoir. The Sun River Slope Canal System takes water from Pishkin Reservoir to serve the irrigated lands on the north side of the river. The headworks for the Fort Shaw Canal, which serves the lands south of the river, are located further downstream and take water directly from the river. The lands north of the river comprise the Greenfields Irrigation District, while the south side is run by the Fort Shaw Irrigation District.<ref name="MTFWP"/><ref name="project">{{cite web

==History==
On September 26, 1906, the [[U.S. Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] authorized the USBR's Sun River Project, under pressure from local residents, namely those of Great Falls, who wanted the irrigation of lands east of the Rocky Mountains along the Sun and [[Teton River (Montana)|Teton]] Rivers. Early proposals included the diversion of streams from west of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] to augment the arid region's water supply, but eventually the project was pared down to comprise two storage dams on the Sun River and a tributary, Willow Creek; two off-stream reservoirs and a diversion dam; and seven main canals.<ref name="history">{{cite web

As early as 1889, the Gibson Dam site <U+2013> located in a narrow mountain gap a few miles above the mouth of the Sun River canyon <U+2013> had been identified by U.S. surveyor Herbert Wilson as an excellent location to develop water storage on the Sun River. More detailed studies in 1911 by the USBR (then the U.S. Reclamation Service) confirmed Wilson's idea, and the first plans for a dam were drafted around 1920.<ref name="history"/> However, it was not until September 1926 when the $1.5 million main construction contract was given to [[Utah Construction Company]]. The dam was one of the first to be built using the trial-load method, which relies primarily on mathematical calculations to determine the pressure of water on the structure, and thus the dam's final design. This method allowed the USBR to save an estimated {{convert|41000|yd3|m3|abbr=on}} of concrete, lowering costs significantly, since otherwise a considerable safety margin would have had to be built into the dam.<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:GibsonR.jpg|thumb|left|Gibson Reservoir seen from above]]
Actual construction started in December 1926, with Albert E. Paddock as project superintendent and Ralph Lowry as construction engineer. Preliminary excavations and site clearing were followed by the placement of a wooden flume to divert the river before concrete pouring in the foundation work could begin. When the foundations were complete, the flume was closed and water allowed to pass through outlet holes in the base of the dam. Concrete for the dam was mixed at a site roughly {{convert|1500|ft|m|abbr=on}} downstream and transported to the construction site via a light railway. The concrete was then placed via buckets transported by a cableway system, supported by two {{convert|280|ft|m|abbr=on}} high towers.<ref name="history"/> 

Two penstocks were installed on the south side of the dam and {{convert|28|mi|km}} of transmission lines were built connecting the dam and [[Augusta, Montana]] in preparation for future hydroelectric generation. However, after determining that the future reservoir would not have enough capacity to sustain power production, USBR sealed the penstocks and the power lines fell into disuse.<ref name="history"/> The dam was completed and the first water stored in December 1929 after three years of construction. At least two people were killed on the project, including Paddock and an unknown workman; the latter fell from a {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} height and struck the former. In 1938, gates were installed in the spillway, increasing the reservoir's storage capacity by 20 percent.<ref name="history"/>

==Flood control==
By halting the Sun River's spring freshet, Gibson Dam has prevented an estimated $3,044,000 in flooding damage between 1950 and 1999.<ref name="project"/>

In 1964, western Montana experienced one of the greatest flooding events in its recorded history,<ref>{{cite web

On June 8, after reports of at least three dam failures on tributaries of the Missouri sent local residents into a panic, there were rumors that the Gibson Dam had failed. A [[U.S. Forest Service]] pilot was sent to investigate and found that water was overtopping the dam by over {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The USBR later estimated the peak flow over the dam at {{convert|66000|cuft/s|m3/s}}, of which at least half was over the crest.<ref>{{cite news

==Hydroelectric power proposal==
A subsidiary of Toll House Energy Company, Gibson Hydro, has proposed the addition of a 15 [[megawatt]] (MW) powerhouse at the base of the dam which would utilize the original 1929 penstocks that were installed by USBR. The powerhouse would generate electricity from irrigation water releases with an estimated annual production of 42.9 million [[kilowatt hour]]s.<ref>{{cite web
