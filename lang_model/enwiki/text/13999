The '''list of sled dog races''' contains dozens of contests created by supporters of [[mushing]], the sport of racing [[sled dog]]s. It is unknown when the first sled dog race was held. Humans have domesticated dogs for tens of thousands of years, and sled dogs have been used for transportation in [[Arctic]] areas for almost as long. The first sled dog race to feature a codified set of rules was the [[All-Alaska Sweepstakes]], which first took place in 1908. This was followed in 1917 by the [[American Dog Derby]], which was the first sled dog race outside [[Alaska]] or the [[Yukon]].<ref>International Sled Dog Racing Association.

The most famous sled dog race is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, an annual 1,200-mile competition in Alaska. It commemorates the [[1925 serum run to Nome]] but was not begun until 1973. The Iditarod helped restart worldwide interest in mushing, which had been thought of as anachronistic after the spread of snowmobiles. Since mushing's resurgence, the sport has proliferated and sled dog races are hosted in towns around the world, from Norway and Finland to Alaska and Michigan. Due to the cold temperatures needed for sled dog racing, most races are held in winter in cold climates, but occasional carting events have been held in warmer weather. These are not included in this list because they do not use sleds.

Today, sled dog races typically take one of three types: sprint, mid-distance, and long-distance. Sprint races involve mushers and teams competing on a course of no more than about 12 miles, with times measured in minutes and seconds. Teams sometimes run the same course several times, and the team with the lowest total time is declared the winner. The best example of this type of race is the [[Open North American Championship]]. Mid-distance races have some aspects of sprint racing, but they also incorporate the need to camp at least one night on the trail. Mid-distance races cover between 200 and 800 miles, and often take several days to complete. Long-distance races are the marathons of the mushing world. Teams compete to be the first to traverse a set distance (usually more than 200 miles), limited assistance is available, and mushers typically have to camp on the trail overnight. In long-distance races, teams typically fight weather conditions and exhaustion as much as other teams on the trail. A fourth type of race, the stage race, also exists. Stage races are similar to [[cycling]]'s [[Tour de France]] in that a long-distance competition is broken into several sections, or stages. Between stages, mushers and teams can rest, modify equipment, and treat dogs. Racers' finishing times for each stage are added to determine an overall winner.
