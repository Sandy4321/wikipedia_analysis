{{Anthroposophy}}
The '''Goetheanum''', located  in [[Dornach]] (near [[Basel]]), [[Switzerland]], is the world center for the [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] movement. Named after [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], the center includes two performance halls (1500 seats), gallery and lecture spaces, a library, a bookstore, and administrative spaces for the [[Anthroposophical Society]]; neighboring buildings house the Society's research and educational facilities. Conferences focusing on themes of general interest occur several times a year. Specialist conferences for teachers, farmers, doctors, therapists, and other professions are held regularly, as well.

The Goetheanum is open for visitors seven days a week and offers tours several times daily.

Numerous visual artists contributed to the building: architects created the unusual double-dome wooden structure over a curving concrete base, stained glass windows added color into the space, painters decorated the ceiling with motifs depicting the whole of human evolution, and sculptors carved huge column bases, capitals, and architraves with images of metamorphoses.<ref name=Adams/><ref name=Schwarz/> 
Already during the construction, musicians, actors and movement artists began performing a wide variety of pieces in a neighboring workshop. When the Goetheanum hall was completed, in 1919, these performances moved onto the stage located under the Goetheanum's smaller cupola. The auditorium was located under the larger cupola.

In the course of 1923, Steiner designed a building to replace the original. This building, now known as the Second Goetheanum, was wholly built of cast [[concrete]]. Begun in 1924, the building was not completed until 1928,<ref name="Steinberg"/> after the architect's death. It represents a pioneering use of visible concrete in architecture<ref>{{HDS|1098|Dornach}}</ref> and has been granted protected status as a Swiss national monument.<ref>Hans Hasler, "A sculptural expression of harmony", ''Architects' Journal '', '''S9'''(3), March 4, 1999.</ref> Art critic Michael Brennan has called the building a "true masterpiece of 20th-century expressionist architecture".<ref>Michael Brennan, "Rudolf Steiner", review in ''artnet Magazine'', 3/18/98. [http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/reviews/brennan/brennan3-18-98.asp Artnet review]</ref>

The present Goetheanum houses a 1000-seat auditorium, now the center of an active artistic community incorporating performances of its in-house theater and [[eurythmy]] troupes as well as visiting performers from around the world. Full remodelings of the central auditorium took place in the mid-1950s and again in the late 1990s. The stained glass windows in the present building stem from Steiner's time; the painted ceiling and sculptural columns are contemporary replications or reinterpretations of those in the First Goetheanum.

In a dedicated gallery, the building also houses a nine-meter high wooden sculpture, ''The Representative of Humanity'', by [[Edith Maryon]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]].

==Architectural principles==
Steiner's architecture is characterized by a liberation from traditional architectural constraints, especially through the departure from the right-angle as a basis for the building plan. For the first Goetheanum he achieved this in wood by employing boat builders to construct its rounded forms; for the second Goetheanum by using concrete to achieve sculptural shapes on an architectural scale.<ref>Richard Reid, ''The book of buildings: Ancient, medieval, Renaissance & modern architecture of North America & Europe'', ISBN 0-442-27805-5. Chapter title "Modern Architecture", subsection "Switzerland".</ref> The use of concrete to achieve organically expressive forms was an innovation for the times; in both buildings, Steiner sought to create forms that were spiritually expressive.<ref name=Blaser/>

Steiner suggested that he had derived the sculptural forms of the first Goetheanum from the spiritual world, rather than by imitating forms of the physical world or through abstract theorizing.<ref>Rudolf Steiner, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA286/English/APC1927/WA1927_index.html ''Ways to a New Style in Architecture''], five lectures given at Dornach, Switzerland during the building of the First Goetheanum, 1914. Also published as  ''Architecture as a Synthesis of the Arts'', 1999, ISBN 1-85584-057-X</ref>

===Additional buildings===
Steiner designed approximately 12-13 other built structures, principally residences in and around Dornach<ref name=Blaser>Werner Blaser, ''Nature in Buildings: Rudolf Steiner in Dornach 1913-1925'', ISBN 3-7643-6541-2</ref> as well as purpose built buildings such as the Glass House which houses the School of Spiritual Sciences.<ref>John Paull (2012) [http://orgprints.org/22346/22/22346.pdf "The Glass House: Crucible of Biodynamic Agriculture"]. Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania, 108 (Summer), pp. 18-23.</ref> Steiner is one of very few major architects<ref>Adolf K. Placzek, editor in chief.   Published  New York : Free Press ; London : Collier Macmillan, 1982.
