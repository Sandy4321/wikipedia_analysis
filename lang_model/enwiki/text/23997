'''Port-Gentil''' (1993 est. pop. 80,000) is the second-largest [[city]] of [[Gabon]] and a leading [[seaport]]. It is the center of Gabon's [[petroleum]] and [[timber]] industries.  Although it lies inshore, the nearby mainland is a remote forest area and it is not connected by road to the rest of the nation. The city lies close to [[Cape Lopez]], the westernmost point in Gabon.

The settlement was established on [[Mandji Island]] in the delta of the [[Ogowe River]] by the [[France|French]], who signed a treaty with the [[Orungu]] people in [[1873]]. It was used as a base for the expeditions of [[de Brazza]] into the interior, then in [[1894]] a [[customs]] post was set up, becoming the nucleus of a trading center that included [[Hatton & Cookson]], [[John Holt (businessman)|John Holt]], [[Woermann]], [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> du Haut-Ogoou<U+00E9>]], and [[Compagnie d'Exploitations Foresti<U+00E8>res Africaines]]. The main products were initially [[rubber]] and [[ivory]], gradually supplemented by [[wood]]s, particularly [[okoum<U+00E9>]] for [[plywood]].

The town was named after the French colonial administrator [[<U+00C9>mile Gentil]] in [[1900]]. After [[World War I]] it became a port for [[timber]], but it grew rapidly only after [[Elf Aquitaine|Elf]] began [[oil]] exploration in the area.

A 1947 population of 4,500 grew to 21,000 by 1960. An [[oil refinery]] was established by [[SOGARA]] in the [[1960s]], with [[natural gas]] added in [[1968]].

The town is now known for its [[hotel]]s and its [[nightlife (activity)|nightlife]], while attractions include the [[St Louis Church]] (built in [[1927]]), a [[zoo]], a [[casino]], [[beach]]es and a [[golf course]], as well as the [[wildlife]] in local [[swamp]]s.

==Transportation==

Port Gentil is technically on an island, and no bridge connects it to the mainland. The limited number of paved roads within the city are also poorly maintained. It has an airport serving as the main channel of transportation with the world. Regular flights are operated from the airport to [[Libreville]], capital of [[Gabon]]. Oil company charters to other destinations are a regular sight from the airport.
