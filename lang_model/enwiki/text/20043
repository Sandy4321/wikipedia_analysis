{{Politics of Gibraltar}}
'''[[Gibraltar]]''' is a [[self-governance|self-governing]] [[British overseas territory]] near the southernmost tip of the [[Iberian peninsula]] subject to a [[List of irredentist claims or disputes|disputed irredentist claim]] by [[Spain]].
 
Gibraltar was [[History of Gibraltar#The Gibraltar capture|captured]] in 1704, during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701-1714). Spain formally ceded the territory under [[:s:Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht between Spain and Great Britain#ARTICLE X|article X]] of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in perpetuity to the British Crown in 1713. This was confirmed in later treaties signed in Paris and Seville.

Spain later attempted to recapture the territory militarily, with a number of failed [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|sieges]], and reclamation of the territory by peaceful means remains Government policy. For their part, the [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]] reject any claim and no [[List of political parties in Gibraltar|political party or pressure group]] in Gibraltar supports union with Spain. In a [[Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 2002|referendum in 2002]] the people of Gibraltar soundly rejected a joint [[sovereignty]] proposal.<ref name="ref2002">{{cite web | url=http://www.gibnet.com/texts/ref2.htm | title=The 2002 referendum | accessdate=2008-09-15|date=[[7 November]] [[2002]]|publisher=Gibnet}}</ref>

[[Image:Gdemo2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|right|25,000 people demonstrated in Gibraltar on 18 March 2002.]]
Despite this, an overwhelming majority of the population holds the view that better relations with Spain are desirable. A mass demonstration held in March 2002, whilst condemning the idea of joint sovereignty, called for ''Good, neighbourly European relations with Spain based on reasonable dialogue and mutual respect.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibnet.com/images/demo2.htm|title=The March 2002 Demo|accessdate=2008-09-15|date=[[18 March]] [[2002]]|publisher=Gibnet}}</ref>

The territorial claim was formally restarted by the Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] in the 1960s and has been continued by successive [[Spanish government]]s. They have insisted that the Gibraltar dispute is a purely bilateral matter and that the current Gibraltarians are mere settlers whose role and will are irrelevant. This vision underlies the [[United Nations]] resolutions driven by Spain on the [[decolonisation]] of Gibraltar in the 1960s, which focused on the "interests" and not the "wishes" of the Gibraltarians. However, the strategy of ignoring the Gibraltarians has proven to be a dead end for Spain. Speaking to the [[Special Committee on Decolonization|UN C24]] in 2006, the [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar]], [[Peter Caruana]], stated: "It is well known and documented and accepted by all that, since 1988 Gibraltar has rejected the [[:s:Brussels Agreement|Bilateral Brussels Process]], and will never be content with it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2006/291-2006.pdf|format=PDF|title= Press Release: Chief Minister<U+2019>s address at the United Nations Fourth Committee on 4 October 2006.|accessdate=2008-10-17|date=[[5 October]] [[2006]]|first=Peter|last=Caruana | publisher = Government of Gibraltar}}</ref>

In 2002 an agreement in principle on joint sovereignty over Gibraltar between the governments of United Kingdom and Spain was reached. There was a robust campaign against these proposals by both the Government and people of Gibraltar, culminating in [[Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 2002|the decisive referendum]]. Gibraltarians have further argued that one cannot claim to be acting in the "interests" of a population, while at the same time ignoring its wishes and democratic rights.

With the election of a [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|moderate left-wing government in Spain]] (2004), Spanish officials noted that, even if Spain does not give up its claim to assume the sovereignty of Gibraltar, no advance could be achieved without taking into account the wishes of the Gibraltarians. The result of this new approach was the creation of a [[Tripartite Forum]] with equal participation by the [[Government of Gibraltar]]. Such movement was qualified by [[People's Party (Spain)|Spanish right-wing parties]] as a surrender. Gibraltarians remain suspicious of the Spanish Government, despite improved relations, and note Spanish intransigence demonstrated with issues like the opposition to [[Gibraltar Football Association|Gibraltar's membership]] of [[Union of European Football Associations]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/12/27/wgib27.xml|title=Rocky road for Gibraltar's footballers|accessdate=2008-09-15|date=[[27 December]] [[2006]]|first=Fiona|last=Govan|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>

==The capture of Gibraltar and the Treaty of Utrecht==
An Anglo-Dutch force led by Admiral Sir [[George Rooke]] captured Gibraltar in 1704 on behalf of the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]], pretender to the Spanish Throne. The territory was eventually ceded to [[Great Britain]] by Spain in the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] as part of the settlement of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. In that treaty, Spain ceded to Great Britain: {{cquote|the full and entire propriety of the town and castle of Gibraltar, together with the port, fortifications, and forts thereunto belonging [<U+2026>] for ever, without any exception or impediment whatsoever.}}

The treaty stipulates that no overland trade between Gibraltar and Spain is to take place, except for emergency provisions in the case that Gibraltar is unable to be resupplied by sea.

In a reversion clause, should the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]] ever wish to relinquish Gibraltar, Spain was promised it will be offered to it first: {{cquote|And in case it shall hereafter seem meet to the Crown of Great Britain to grant, sell or by any means to alienate therefrom the propriety of the said town of Gibraltar, it is hereby agreed and concluded that the preference of having the sale shall always be given to the Crown of Spain before any others.}}

The [[United Kingdom]] and Spain are both members of the [[European Union]] (EU), with Gibraltar joining as a [[Special Member State territories and the European Union|Special Member State territory]] under the UK's Treaty of Accession in 1972. The EU is committed to free movement of goods and services and respect for human rights, thus the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]] and the Government of Gibraltar claim that this supersedes any outdated "restrictions" contemplated in 1713.

== Differing positions ==
===British position===
In his evidence to the UK Parliament [[Foreign Affairs Committee]] in 2008, [[Jim Murphy]] MP, [[Minister of State for Europe]] stated:

{{cquote|The UK Government will never - "never" is a seldom-used word in politics - enter into an agreement on sovereignty without the agreement of the Government of Gibraltar and their people. In fact, we will never even enter into a process without that agreement. The word "never" sends a substantial and clear commitment and has been used for a purpose. We have delivered that message with confidence to the peoples and the Governments of Gibraltar and Spain. It is a sign of the maturity of our relationship now that that is accepted as the UK's position.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmfaff/147/8032602.htm Answer to Q257 at the FAC hearing]</ref>}}

===Gibraltar position===
The UK government and Gibraltarians state that the Spanish claims are baseless, pointing to the right to [[self-determination]] of all peoples, guaranteed and enshrined by the UN, according to the UN Charter. Its article 1 states that: 

{{cquote|The Purposes of the United Nations are [...] to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.}}

To the same section 2 of [[:s:United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514|Resolution 1514 (XV)]] states:

{{cquote|All peoples have the right to self-determination; by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.}}

Furthermore, resolution 2231 (XXI) itself recalls and demands implementation of Resolution 1514(XV) (guaranteeing Gibraltar's right to self-determination) and therefore the Spanish claim for its territorial integrity (which would not be affected by Gibraltar's decolonisation) cannot displace or extinguish the rights of the people of Gibraltar under resolution 1514(XV) or under the Charter.<ref>[http://www.gibnet.com/texts/jbun0601.htm Joe Bossano addresses the UN]</ref>

Any additional right that Spain could claim by virtue of the "reversionary" clause contained in the Treaty of Utrecht is overruled and annulled under article 103 of the [[UN Charter]]:

{{cquote|In the event of a conflict between the obligations of the Members of the United Nations under the present Charter and their obligations under any other international agreement, their obligations under the present Charter shall prevail.}}

Finally, it is pointed out that there is in fact no principle in International Law or UN doctrine that can displace the inalienable right to self-determination, and that the UN itself and the International Court of Justice have repeatedly stated that: 

{{cquote|In the process of decolonisation there is no alternative to the principle of self-determination.}}

The Gibraltar Government has also argued that Gibraltar is a British territory and therefore by definition not an integral part of any other state, therefore Spain's territorial integrity cannot be affected by anything that occurs in Gibraltar:

{{cquote|Even if integration of a territory was demanded by an interested State it could not be had without ascertaining the freely expressed will of the people, the very sine qua non of all decolonisation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gibnet.com/texts/pcun0601.htm | title = Full text of an address by the Chief Minister of Gibraltar Peter Caruana to the United Nations Committee of 24.}}</ref>}}

Consequently the decolonisation of Gibraltar cannot affect the territorial integrity of a country of which it does not form part. It further points out that it is not possible to respect the "interests" of the people of Gibraltar, while at the same time ignoring their wishes, and their democratic rights. They consider it hypocritical for the Spanish Government to claim to respect democratic values while at the same time stating that the democratic wishes of 30,000 Gibraltarians are irrelevant. The Gibraltarian point of view can be extensively seen in the speech of Chief Minister Joe Bossano at the United Nations in 1994.<ref>{{cite web | author=Joe Bossano | year=1994 | url=http://www.gibnet.com/texts/jbun1.htm | title=The Fight for Self - Determination. Joe Bossano at the United Nations | publisher=Gibraltar... The unofficial homepage. Reference Documents about Gibraltar and its political struggles | accessdate=2005-12-16}}</ref>

In a referendum held in Gibraltar in September 2002, the people of Gibraltar united to reject the concept of even partial Spanish sovereignty.<ref name="ref2002"/>

Speaking to the UK Parliament Foreign Affairs committee in March 2008 [[Peter Caruana]] the Chief Minister of Gibraltar noted:

{{cquote|Spain does not dispute that Gibraltar is properly, in law, British territory. Therefore, this is not disputed land. She has a political claim to the return of Gibraltar sovereignty, but she does not dispute the fact that in proper international law, she ceded sovereignty to Britain in perpetuity and therefore it is undisputed British sovereign territory.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmfaff/147/8030502.htm Answer to Q215 at the FAC hearing]</ref>}}

===Spanish position===
The traditional Spanish position relies on claiming the right to its territorial integrity. According to the Spanish interpretation, as the UN comprises states, the concept of territorial integrity complements and constrains the right to self-determination, citing [[:s:United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514|UN Resolution 1514 (XV)]] from 1960 which says:

{{cquote|Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.}}

During the sixties, the UN General Assembly passed two resolutions on the issue (2231 (XXI), "Question of Gibraltar"<ref>{{cite web | author=UN General Assembly | year=1966 | url=http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/21/ares21.htm | title=Resolution 2231(XXI). Question of Gibraltar | format=PDF | work=Resolutions adopted by the General Assembly during its Twenty-First Session | publisher=United Nations | accessdate=2005-12-16}}</ref> and 2353 (XXII), "Question of Gibraltar"<ref>{{cite web | author=UN General Assembly | year=1967 | url=http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/22/ares22.htm | title=Resolution 2353(XXII). Question of Gibraltar | format=PDF | work=Resolutions adopted by the General Assembly during its Twenty-Second Session | publisher=United Nations | accessdate=2005-12-16}}</ref>). The latter states that:

{{Cquote|any colonial situation which partially or completely destroys the national unity and territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and especially with paragraph 6 of Resolution 1514 (XV) of the General Assembly [...] Invites the Governments of Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to resume without delay the negotiations provided for in General Assembly Resolutions 2070 (XX) and 2231 (XXI), with a view to putting an end to the colonial situation in Gibraltar and to safeguarding the interests of the population.}}

From such a point of view, Gibraltarians would be mere settlers from Britain and other places and only their interests, not their wishes (as the right to self-determination would involve), need be safeguarded.

With the arrival of the democracy, such a "traditional" position seems to have been softened and aimed to some sort of temporal or permanent joint sovereignty (similar to the agreement announced between the Spanish and British governments in the Spring of 2002, which was eventually shelved after sustained and united opposition by the Gibraltarians).

== The isthmus ==
{{main|Disputed status of the isthmus between Gibraltar and Spain}}
The territory of Gibraltar contains an {{convert|800|m|adj=on|0}} section of the isthmus that links The Rock<ref>Gibraltar is frequently known as ''The Rock''</ref> with mainland Spain.

Spain does not acknowledge British sovereignty over Gibraltar beyond the fortified perimeter of the town as that of 1704. The United Kingdom claims that its title to the southern part of the isthmus is based on continuous possession over a long period.

As well as the [[Gibraltar Airport|airport]], there are two substantial housing estates, a [[Victoria Stadium (Gibraltar)|sports stadium]], a [[Bayside Comprehensive School (Gibraltar)|secondary school]], a marina and a [[Eastern Beach, Gibraltar|beach]] on this land, which is an integral part of the territory of Gibraltar.

==Territorial waters==
The Treaty of Utrecht did not specify [[territorial waters]], because the concept did not exist at the time it was signed.

By the first half of the 18th century the concept of the {{convert|3|nmi|km|adj=on|lk=in}} wide sovereign territorial sea emerged, this was eventually adopted by most countries as the basis of marine jurisdiction, until the [[UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]] 1982, which entered into force in 1995, set a new standard of {{convert|12|nmi|km}}. Gibraltar's territorial waters currently extend up to 3 nautical miles, but could be extended if required &mdash; the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea set a standard of the latter distance for all of its signatories.<ref>[http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]</ref> [[Spain]] included a declaration, the content of which was rejected by the UK. [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar|Chief Minister]] [[Peter Caruana]] noted:

{{cquote|Spain subscribed to that treaty, making no reservation whatsoever in relation to the Gibraltar question. International law makes Spain's denial of territorial waters in Gibraltar completely unsustainable in law.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmfaff/147/8030502.htm Q218 FORAFFCOM evidence 2008]</ref>}}

; The Spanish statement upon ratification of the Convention
{{cquote|2. In ratifying the Convention, Spain wishes to make it known that this act cannot be construed as recognition of any rights or status regarding the maritime space of Gibraltar that are not included in article 10 of the Treaty of Utrecht of 13 July 1713 concluded between the Crowns of Spain and Great Britain. Furthermore, Spain does not consider that Resolution III of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is applicable to the colony of Gibraltar, which is subject to a process of decolonization in which only relevant resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly are applicable.<ref>[http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_declarations.htm#Spain%20Upon%20signature United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea: Declarations made upon signature, ratification, accession or succession or anytime thereafter (Spain)]</ref>}}

; The British statement upon ratification of the Convention
{{cquote|With regard to point 2 of the declaration made upon ratification of the Convention by the Government of Spain, the Government of the United Kingdom has no doubt about the sovereignty of the United Kingdom over Gibraltar, including its territorial waters. The Government of the United Kingdom, as the administering authority of Gibraltar, has extended the United Kingdom's accession to the Convention and ratification of the Agreement to Gibraltar. The Government of the United Kingdom, therefore, rejects as unfounded point 2 of the Spanish declaration.<ref>[http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_declarations.htm#UK%20Upon%20accession United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea: Declarations made upon signature, ratification, accession or succession or anytime thereafter (United Kingdom)]</ref>}}

Article 310 of the 1982 Convention makes it clear that "such statements and declarations cannot exclude or modify the legal effect of the provisions of the Convention" in their application.

The dispute over territorial waters, which was rekindled over the fishing dispute seems likely to become more important with the discovery of a British treasure ship, [[HMS Sussex (1693)|HMS Sussex]], and the [[Black Swan Project]] controversy. Questions about the waters have previously been asked in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and answered as follows:

{{cquote|Under international law, States are entitled, but not required, to extend their territorial sea up to a maximum breadth of 12 nautical miles. Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent, the general rule is that neither is entitled, unless they agree otherwise, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line. The UK Government considers that a limit of three nautical miles is sufficient in the case of Gibraltar.}}

The Government of Gibraltar for its part holds that there is no economic or social need for more than three nautical miles of territorial water.

In May 2009 there were a number of Spanish incursions into British Waters around Gibraltar leading to intervention by the Police and a diplomatic protest by the UK. <ref>[http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=16173 Britain tells Spain violation unacceptable]</ref> <ref>[http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/102828/Return-of-the-Armada-as-Spain-invades-Gibraltar Return of the Armada]</ref>

==1953: rekindling the dispute==
In 1954, despite objections by Spain, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] visited Gibraltar in May. Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] had renewed claims to The Rock. Based on [[The National Archives|British National Archives]] files from 1953, Franco claimed that Spain had been promised The Rock in return for not attacking the territory during the [[World War II]]. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] Sir [[Winston Churchill]] denied that he promised to give Gibraltar to Spain.

The [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] conducted a full review of their files to see whether Franco's claim had any foundation. A confidential memo called the Spanish communiqu<U+00E9> "a flimsy and unconvincing document", and the Government put an end to the dispute by refusing to comment on the claims.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4117495.stm Files reveal 1953 Gibraltar row]</ref>

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Gibraltar}}

Repeated stories in the Spanish media that Gibraltar banks are used for [[tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]] and [[money laundering]] have been determined to be baseless after an inquiry by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]]. This found that Gibraltar has always complied with all international and EU requirements to prevent such activity.

{{cquote|We conclude that the series of allegations which Spain makes against Gibraltar appear almost wholly to be without substance. In many cases, it is not just the Government of Gibraltar but the British Government as well which is traduced. It is deeply regrettable that allegations are made that cannot be sustained by a basis in fact. If concrete evidence of wrong-doing were produced, the British Government should act promptly to deal with the problem. But so long as allegations are unsubstantiated, the British Government should continue to rebut them promptly and decisively.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmfaff/366/36606.htm]</ref>}}
 
Similarly positive assessments have been made by international bodies such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).<ref>[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/gov_depts/finance/IMF_Reports/Detailed_Assessment_Report_on_Anti-Money_Laundering_and_Combating_the_Financing_of_Terrorism.pdf Detailed Assessment Report on Anti-Mone Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism]</ref><ref name=AFSSR>[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/gov_depts/finance/IMF_Reports/Assessment_of_Financial_Sector_Supervision_and_Regulation..pdf Assessment of Financial Sector Supervision and Regulation]</ref><ref>[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/gov_depts/finance/IMF_Reports/Detailed_Assessment_Report_of_Observance_of_the_Insurance_Core_Principles.pdf Detailed Assessment Report of Observance of the Insurance Core Principles]</ref><ref>[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/gov_depts/finance/IMF_Reports/Detailed_Assessment_Report_of_Observance_of_the_Basel_Core_Principles.pdf Detailed Assessment Report of Observance of the Basel Core Principles]</ref>

According to the executive summary of a 2007 IMF Report:

{{Cquote|Gibraltar has a well-regulated financial sector. The Gibraltar authorities are concerned with protecting the reputation and integrity of Gibraltar as a financial center, and are cognizant of the importance of adopting and applying international regulatory standards and best supervisory practices. Gibraltar has a good reputation internationally for cooperation and information sharing.<ref name=AFSSR/>}}

Along with the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Cyprus]], Gibraltar has been used as an [[Financial centre|international finance centre]] by the [[Russia]]n [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[Yukos]]/[[Bank Menatep|Menatep]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/031117/yukos.html]</ref>

The Spanish Government has also accused Gibraltarian [[motorboat]]s of engaging in tobacco smuggling. However, since 1996 there has been a [[Law of Gibraltar|law in Gibraltar]] controlling fast launches licensing their ownership and importation and prohibiting the entry of unlicensed craft into Gibraltar waters.

==Referenda==
In a [[Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 1967|1967 referendum on sovereignty]] organised by the British Government, Gibraltarians ignored Spanish pressure and 99.6% of voters voted to remain a under British sovereignty.

More recently, in a second [[Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 2002|referendum on sovereignty]] held in November 2002 by the Government of Gibraltar, 99% of the voters rejected any proposal to share sovereignty between the UK and Spain.

The wording of the question being:

{{cquote|Do you approve of the principle that Britain and Spain should share sovereignty over Gibraltar? <ref>[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/Referendum/votingpaper.htm 2002 Referendum question]</ref>}}

The result was a decisive 17,900 NO, 187 YES<ref>[http://www.electionguide.org/resultsum/gibraltar_sovereigntyref_02.htm Referendum result]</ref>.

==Recent disputes==
2000 - An issue of contention was the repair of the [[Nuclear submarine|nuclear powered submarine]], [[HMS Tireless (S88)|HMS Tireless]]. The Government of Spain expressed its concern about the effective safety for the inhabitants of Gibraltar and those living in the ''[[Campo de Gibraltar]]'' the adjacent area in Spain, some 250,000 people.

The inhabitants of the area saw this repair as a precedent of future repair operations in Gibraltar rather than the one-off emergency the British Government has claimed (no other nuclear submarine has been repaired in Gibraltar since). On the other hand, the Government of Gibraltar accused Spain of using this incident as an excuse to justify its 300 year old sovereignty claim to Gibraltar. Despite many protests, the Government of Gibraltar allowed the work to be done after employing its own experts to confirm it could be undertaken safely. The submarine was in Gibraltar for a year before leaving, during which the repair was completed without incident.

Subsequently Spanish politicians have complained about every nuclear submarine visit to Gibraltar, and have tried unsuccessfully to get a reassurance that this would totally stop. There have been no further protests against nuclear submarines in Gibraltar. Commenting, the Government of Gibraltar said:

{{cquote|Nuclear submarine visits to Gibraltar are a matter for UK and Gibraltar. Visits for operational or recreational purposes are welcome by the Gibraltar Government [...] To our knowledge, it is not the position of the present Spanish Government or any previous Spanish Government, that it is opposed to visits by nuclear submarines.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2005/223-2005.htm | title = Press release: Trilateral Forum - Submarines | author = Government of Gibraltar | accessdate = 2008-10-17}}</ref>}}

2002 - In the months that predated the referendum called by the Gibraltar government on the joint sovereignty agreement disagreements could be categorised as:
* Control of the Military Installations. Spain wished to control the military installations of the territory, even in the event of joint sovereignty. This pretension was considered unacceptable by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]].
* The Referendum itself. Both the Spanish and British governments stated that the referendum had no legal effect, but it clearly indicated the democratically expressed will of the people of Gibraltar to <U+201C>not be Spanish<U+201D>. As the British Government is committed to respect those wishes, the idea of a joint sovereignty deal has been abandoned.

2004 - A visit by [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]] in June 2004, the brief return of HMS Tireless in July 2004, together with the [[Gibraltar Tercentenary Celebrations|Tercentenary Celebrations]] of the capture of The Rock were subjects of complaint by the Spanish Government.

A new round of talks on a tri-lateral basis were proposed in October 2004 to discuss regional co-operation. In February 2005 the first talks took place at a meeting held in M<U+00E1>laga and subsequently in [[Portugal]] and [[London]].

This is the first sign of formal recognition of the Government of Gibraltar, and has been generally welcomed. The main issues of the talks have been a new agreement on the [[Gibraltar Airport|airport]], the pensions of the Spanish workers that worked in Gibraltar during the sixties, and the removal of [[Telephone numbers in Gibraltar|Spanish restrictions on telecommunications]].

2006 - Those issues were successfully resolved in September 2006 in the [[C<U+00F3>rdoba Agreement]]. The process continues.

2007 - A bulk carrier, the [[MV New Flame]], ran aground south of [[Europa Point]] in Gibraltar and broke up on the [[reef]] in August 2007, generating accusations of pollution in Spain and claims not only against the Government of Gibraltar but also against that of Spain.<ref>[http://www.ecologistasenaccion.org/spip.php?article9263 El New Flame ha vertido a la Bah<U+00ED>a de Algeciras], 2007 October {{es}})</ref> Its cargo was scrap metal and the vessel's fuel was promptly drained.{{cite}} The Government of Gibraltar claimed in December 2007 that the operation did not represent a material risk to the environment since the vessel had been defuelled and only small, remnant amounts of fuel remained in the engines themselves.<ref>[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2007/282-2007-EN.pdf Government of Gibraltar Press Release on the New Flame] (24 December, 2007)</ref> The Spanish branch of [[Greenpeace]] claimed that, as late as February 2008, fuel spills from the New Flame had polluted Spanish beaches around the [[Bay of Gibraltar]].<ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org/espana/news/greenpeace-se-ala-la-gravedad Greenpeace se<U+00F1>ala la gravedad del <U+00FA>ltimo vertido del New Flame], 2008 February 11th {{es}}.</ref> Official Spanish sources played this down stating that the fuel reaching the beaches of Algeciras was in "insignificant amounts".<ref>[http://www.europasur.es/article/andalucia/51891/espana/llama/consultas/la/embajadora/reino/unido/por/la/actuacion/gibraltar.html Spanish Environment Minister Cristina Narbona comments]</ref>

2009 - The dispute over Gibraltar's Territorial Waters gained prominence with deliberate incursions and inflammatory headlines in the UK tabloid press. <ref>[http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/102828/Return-of-the-Armada-as-Spain-invades-Gibraltar Return of the Armada]</ref>

==Spanish restrictions==
Despite both Gibraltar and Spain being members of the EU, Spain continued to place restrictions on communications with Gibraltar, which affected telecommunications and blocks any EU or international agreements, like the [[Hague Convention 1996]] that mention the Gibraltar Airport. Under the [[:s:Lisbon Agreement|Lisbon agreement]] of 1980:

{{cquote|Both Governments have reached agreement on the re-establishment of direct communications in the region. The Spanish Government has decided to suspend the application of the measures at present in force.}} 

This was to include re-instatement of a ferry service from [[Algeciras]], which has yet to happen.

At the end of 2006, the restrictions on the airport were removed as a result of the C<U+00F3>rdoba Agreement (2006) and direct flights from Madrid by [[Iberia airlines|Iberia]] started operation. <ref>{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://www.gibnews.net/cgi-bin/gn_view.pl/?GPIX061216_1.xml | title=First Iberia flight | publisher=gibnews.net| accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> 

However, On 22 September 2008, Iberia announced that it would cease its flights to Madrid by 28 September due to "economic reasons", namely, lack of demand. This left Gibraltar without any air links with Spain, <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Business/Spanish-Airline-Iberia-Suspends-flights-between-Madrid-and-Gibraltar-For-Economic-Reasons/Article/200809415104894?lpos=Business_First_Home_Article_Teaser_Region_1&lid=ARTICLE_15104894_Spanish_Airline_Iberia_Suspends_flights_between_Madrid_and_Gibraltar_For_Economic_Reasons|title=

==Political development==
The Gibraltarians have sought a more modern status and relationship with the United Kingdom reflecting, and expanding the present level of [[self-governance|self-government]].

A new constitution was approved in a [[Gibraltar constitutional referendum, 2006|referendum in 2006]] which moved Gibraltar to a more [[Crown dependency]]-like relationship with the UK, rather than the previous colonial status. [http://www.chronicle.gi/Features/Gib%20Day/Gib%20Day.htm] The new constitution came into effect in January 2007.

In a letter to the UN the British representative, [[Emyr Jones Parry]], writes:

{{cquote|The new constitution provides for a modern relationship between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom. I do not think that this description would apply to any relationship based on colonialism.<ref>[http://www.gibnet.com/texts/un_let.htm Letter to the UN]</ref>}}

Chief Minister Peter Caruana addressed the UN Special Committee on Decolonization regarding the new constitution in 2008. He put forth his Government's view that:

{{cquote|As far as we are concerned, the decolonisation of Gibraltar is no longer a pending issue.<ref>{{cite web | author=UN General Assembly | year=2008 | url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/gacol3179.doc.htm | title=As Special Committee on Decolonization considers question of Gibraltar, territory's chief minister says its decolonization 'no longer pending.' | work=Special Committee on Decolonization Ninth Meeting | publisher=United Nations | accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref>}}

Parallel with this, the Government of Gibraltar has engaged in talks with Spain to resolve other disputes, setting aside the issue of sovereignty.
