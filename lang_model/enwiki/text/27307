'''''Niebla  ramosissima''''' is a rare [[fruticose lichen]] that grows on soil on [[San Nicolas Island]] in the [[Channel Islands]] of California.<ref name="Spjut1996">Spjut, R. W. 1996.  ''Niebla'' and ''Vermilacinia'' (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14</ref>  The epithet, ''ramosissima'', is in reference to the very much branched thallus.

==Distinguishing Features==

''Niebla  ramosissima'' is distinguished by a mat-like, flaccid thallus, very much divided into numerous tangled narrow sublinear-prismatic branches<ref>Linear: having parallel margins 10 or more times longer than wide. Prismatic: shaped like a prism in cross section of branches</ref> to 16 cm across, the individual branches only 0.5<U+2013>1.0 mm in diameter, and by containing divaricatic acid, with triterepenes.<ref name="Spjut1996" /> ''Niebla juncosa'', a species with the same chemistry and similarly shaped branches, which  occurs on the [[Baja California]] peninsula, differs by its turgid thallus with larger branches, 2<U+2013>5 mm in diameter, and further differs in their spreading to erect habit and in their elliptical shape in cross section.<ref name="Spjut1996" />

==Taxonomic History==

''Niebla ramosissima'' was recognized as a result of undertaking a taxonomic revision of the genus in regard to developing a lichen flora of [[Baja California]], which began in 1986. A peer review of the manuscript in 1990 suggested that additional [[herbarium]] collections be studied, especially of ''Niebla'' on the California mainland and in the [[Channel Islands]]. Additional specimens were studied through loans obtained by the United States National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution, Museum of Natural History, Botany Department) from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] and from the [[Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History]]. ''Niebla ramossisima'' was discovered among the borrowed specimens (of ''Niebla''). The species is known only from the holo[[type (biology)]].  It was collected by Charis Bratt, 12 February 1993.<ref name="Spjut1996" /> ''Niebla ramosissima'' has also been included under an extremely broad interpretation of ''[[Niebla homalea]]'' based on the assumptions that morphological variation in ''Niebla'' is environmentally induced and that chemical variation represents chemo-syndrome variation;<ref>Bowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004. ''Niebla''. <U+2018>Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2<U+2019>: 368<U+2013>380.</ref> however, this broad interpretation of ''N. homalea'' and other related species has inconsistencies in the taxonomic treatment of the genus.<ref>Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert: Book Review, Richard Spjut, web page, retrieved 22 Dec 2014, http://www.worldbotanical.com/lichen%20flora%20review.htm</ref>
