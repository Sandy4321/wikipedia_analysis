'''William Pantulf''' (d. 16 April probably in 1112) was an [[Anglo-Norman]] nobleman and [[Baron of Wem]]. He was born in [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], a region of Normandy, where his family had lived since around 1030. Pantulf held lands in [[Shropshire]] following the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. A [[vassal]] of [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Roger of Montgomery]], the [[Earl of Shrewsbury]], Pantulf was accused of murdering Roger's wife but proved his innocence of the charge by a [[trial by ordeal]]. When Roger's son [[Robert of Bell<U+00EA>me, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury|Robert]] rebelled against King [[Henry I of England]], Pantulf did not take part and sided with the king. Upon his death, which most likely occurred in 1112, Robert inherited his English lands, and his eldest son the Norman lands.

==Background and family==

Pantulf was from [[Noron]] in the [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]] region of Normandy.<ref name=Loyd76>Loyd ''Origins'' p. 76</ref> His family had lived there since at least around 1030, as a [[charter]] of [[Jumi<U+00E8>ges Abbey]] shows the family as vassals of the [[Roger de Montgomery, seigneur of Montgomery|House of Montgomery]] in the Montgomery lands near [[S<U+00E9>es]].<ref name=Achieve116/>{{efn|The charter was granted by [[Roger de Montgomery, seigneur of Montgomery]] and was witnessed by a William Pantulf, but whether the William the witness and the later William were the same person is not known.<ref name=Douglas95>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 95</ref>}} Pantulf's mother was named Beatrice, and his sister was named Helwise, but his father's name and other siblings are not known.<ref name=DP493/>

==After the Conquest==

After the [[Norman Conquest of England]], Pantulf held lands in [[Shropshire]] from Earl [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Roger de Montgomery]].<ref name=DP493/> The earl settled a number of his Norman vassals, including Pantulf, on his new lands in [[Sussex]] and Shropshire.<ref name=Arist46>Green ''Aristocracy'' p. 46</ref> Pantulf's grants totalled eleven manors located in [[Hodnet Hundred]].<ref name=DNB>Bateson "Pantulf, William" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> Pantulf's lands in England were centered on [[Wem]], and are considered a [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]], making Pantulf the first [[Baron of Wem]].<ref name=Sanders94/>

Pantulf was present at the consecration of the church at [[Bec Abbey]] on 23 October 1077, along with King [[William the Conqueror]] of England.<ref name=DNB/> Pantulf lost his lands temporarily because he was suspected of murdering Roger's wife [[Mabel de Bell<U+00EA>me]],<ref name=DP493/> around 1077.<ref name=Bates161>Bates ''Normandy Before 1066'' p. 161</ref>{{efn|The actual murderer was [[Hugh Bunel]],<ref name=Bates243/> sometimes known as [[Hugh d'Igle]].<ref name=DNB/>}} Pantulf came under suspicion because Mabel had seized a castle at [[Peray en Saonnais]] held by Pantulf.<ref name=DNB/> When he was accused of the murder,<ref name=World14>Chibnall ''World of Orderic Vitalis'' pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref> Pantulf was in southern Italy, which had also been conquered by Normans.<ref name=Bates243>Bates ''Normandy Before 1066'' p. 243</ref> Pantulf sought refuge at the [[Abbey of Saint-Evroul]] in Normandy while he was under suspicion; he and his family were under the protection of the abbot.<ref name=World14/>

Pantulf regained his lands after he cleared himself of the charge,<ref name=DP493>Keats-Rohan ''Domesday People'' pp. 493<U+2013>494</ref> through the mechanism of a [[trial by ordeal]].{{efn|One source gives the type of ordeal as being that of the hot iron.<ref name=World14/>}} It is not clear why the ordeal was required, with the historian [[David Bates (historian)|David Bates]] speculating that either the evidence of Pantulf's involvement was not conclusive or that murder victim's family demanded the ordeal because they suspected any evidence pointing to Pantulf's innocence.<ref name=Bates161/> By 1086 he held 29 manors in Shropshire, along with other lands in [[Staffordshire]] and [[Warwickshire]].<ref name=DNB/> When Roger's son [[Robert of Bell<U+00EA>me, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury|Robert de Bell<U+00EA>me]] became Earl of Shrewsbury in 1098, Pantulf was once more deprived of those lands he held as a vassal of the Earl.<ref name=DNB/>

==Role in rebellion==

In 1102 Robert de Bell<U+00EA>me rebelled against King [[Henry I of England]]. Although Pantulf was still deprived of his previous holdings, he offered to support Robert, but was rebuffed and instead supported the king.<ref name=DNB/> Henry placed [[Stafford Castle]] in Pantulf's custody.<ref name=Achieve116>Douglas ''Norman Achievement'' p. 116</ref> Besides controlling Stafford Castle, Pantulf mediated between Henry and some of the Welsh princes, who had previously sided with Robert, and helped secure their support for the king.<ref name=Henry159>Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 159</ref> Later Pantulf again acted as an envoy for the king, being sent to secure the switch of sides of Robert's men who were holding [[Bridgnorth]]. Pantulf won their change of sides by offering the men lands worth a 100 [[pound (currency)|pounds]] on the king's behalf.<ref name=Green71>Green ''Henry I'' p. 71</ref> His services to the king earned Pantulf the restoration of his confiscated estates as well as the grant of further lands<U+2014>including the fief of [[Roger de Courcelles]].<ref name=DNB/>

==Death and legacy==

Pantulf married Lescelina and they had four sons&nbsp;<U+2013> Philip, Ivo, Arnald and Robert. He and his wife founded [[Noron Priory]],<ref name=DP493/> in 1073. This was located in Normandy and was founded as a small [[priory|dependent priory]] of Saint Evroul.<ref name=World14/> Besides Noron, Pantulf was also a benefactor of the Saint-Evroul.<ref name=Loyd76/>  In 1092 Pantulf journeyed to southern Italy again, this time to secure a relic of [[Saint Nicholas]] for his foundation at Noron.<ref name=Bates243/>{{efn|The exact relic was a tooth.<ref name=World106>Chibnall ''World of Orderic Vitalis'' p. 106</ref>}} During this visit, he was offered extensive lands in Apulia by [[Robert Guiscard]], but declined the offer and returned to the north.<ref name=Achieve116/> Pantulf died on 16 April, probably in 1112,<ref name=DNB/> when his English lands were transferred to his second son Robert. The Norman lands went to the eldest son, Philip.<ref name=Sanders94>Sanders ''English Baronies'' pp. 94<U+2013>95</ref> Pantulf and his wife were buried at Noron in the cloister of his priory there.<ref name=DNB/>
