{{Nihongo|'''''Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru'''''|<U+51E6><U+5973><U+306F><U+304A><U+59C9><U+3055><U+307E><U+306B><U+604B><U+3057><U+3066><U+308B>||lit. ''The Maidens are Falling in Love with Elder Sister''}}, commonly known as {{Nihongo|'''''Otoboku'''''|<U+304A><U+3068><U+30DC><U+30AF>}}, is a [[Japan]]ese [[visual novel]] developed by [[Caramel Box]] and released on [[January 28]] [[2005]] as a limited edition. The original version, first available on the [[Personal computer|PC]], contains [[Eroge|adult-only]] content of a [[Hentai|sexual nature]]. Subsequent releases included a consumer port on the [[Playstation 2]] with the adult content removed and a version of the game which was a [[DVD]] playable on a PC and included full [[voice acting]]. The story centers around a [[femininity|feminine]] male high school student named Mizuho Miyanokouji, who transfers into an all-girls school due to his grandfather's will. A common theme throughout the series is the [[Yuri (animation)|pseudo-lesbian]] relationships that Mizuho gets put into for being a very popular student at his new school.

''Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru'' has made several transitions to other media. Two separate novel series were created in 2005 followed by a [[manga]] illustrated by [[Kanao Araki]]. An [[anime]] was quickly adapted as well which first aired on [[October 8]] [[2006]] in Japan and contained twelve episodes, with an extra episode included in the last DVD that went on sale on [[April 4]] [[2007]]. There have been four [[drama CD]]s released.

The original title uses the kanji {{Nihongo|<U+51E6><U+5973>|shojo}}, which can mean both "virgin" and "young lady". The creators added [[furigana]] subscript to indicate they wanted it read "otome" meaning young maiden. Additionally, furigana was added above {{Nihongo|<U+304A><U+59C9><U+3055><U+307E>|Oneesama}} to indicate that they wanted it read "boku", in order to highlight the fact the main character was actually male. Despite the different [[kanji]], the official reading is "Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru", meaning "Maidens are Falling in Love with Me". When the game was ported to the PlayStation 2, it was renamed as <U+4E59><U+5973><U+306F><U+304A><U+59C9><U+3055><U+307E><U+306B><U+604B><U+3057><U+3066><U+308B>, which uses the actual {{Nihongo|"otome"|<U+4E59><U+5973>}} kanji. The latter name was kept for the manga and anime releases.

==Plot==
{{spoilers}}
''Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru'' revolves around the lives of a group of friends at {{Nihongo|''Seio Girls School''|<U+8056><U+61C9><U+5973><U+5B66><U+9662>|Sei<U+014D> Jogakuin}} (or written as "<U+8056><U+592E><U+5973><U+5B66><U+9662>" in the PlayStation 2 version) and their interactions with each other after the main protagonist, Mizuho Miyanokouji, transfers to the school. Mizuho is a nice person with morals who was born in a good and loving family, but after his grandfather passes away and his last [[Will (law)|will in testament]] is reviewed, it is discovered that it was his desire to have his grandson transfer to an all-girl's school - the same one his own mother attended and his ancestors founded. Abiding by the will, Mizuho [[crossdress]]es in order to attend the school as a female.

Upon attending the school, only the headmistress (incidentally a nun who knew Mizuho's mother as a former student of the school), Hisako Kajiura (Mizuho's homeroom teacher) and Mariya Mikado, his childhood friend who aided in his transformation, initially knows his secret. However, both Shion Jujo, one of his classmates, and Ichiko Takashima, a ghost residing in Mizuho's dorm building, also find this out relatively early in the series. From the start, Mizuho was very popular among the other students who would often talk about how pretty, nice and athletic Mizuho was. This rampant popularity soon escalated to the point where he was even nominated against his will to join in on the Elder election. There is an old tradition at Seio Girls School every June where one of the students is elected by her peers to be the "Elder", who is seen as the number-one "Elder Sister" in the entire school. Until her graduation, she is referred to by her peers as {{Nihongo|''[[Oneesama]]''|<U+304A><U+59C9><U+3055><U+307E>}}. If there is no one else in the election, the current year's student council president becomes the Elder. By these terms, the current student council president, Takako Itsukushima, attempts to run against Mizuho in the election to see who comes out on top. Her motivation to do so is more complex than a simple desire for prestige, however.

After the dust settles from this struggle, and Mizuho comes out on top as the Elder, he progressively gets more popular among the entire student body since Mizuho is now a symbol of the school's excellence. In the proceeding months, Mizuho starts to get to know some of the girls closer which often brings about themes dealing with [[Yuri (animation)|lesbianism]], though this can only be taken at face value since Mizuho is still very much male, even though most of the student body thinks otherwise.

Incidentally, the name of the school the characters attend was {{Nihongo|''Keisen Girls School''|<U+6075><U+6CC9><U+5973><U+5B66><U+9662>|Keisen Jogakuin}} at first. This was used in original PC version, the [[List of Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru albums#Drama CDs|drama CD of the visual novel]] and for the ''[[Caramel Box Yarukibako]]'' fan disc. This name was later ascertained to be similar to a name of an actual school, which led to the school's name officially changing to {{Nihongo|''Seio Girls School''|<U+8056><U+61C9><U+5973><U+5B66><U+9662>|Sei<U+014D> Jogakuin|<U+8056><U+5FDC><U+5973><U+5B66><U+9662> as written in PlayStation 2 version}}.<ref name="caramel box">{{citeweb|url=http://www.caramel-box.com/history/history2006.html|title=Caramel Box Information|accessdate=2007-02-22|language=Japanese}}</ref> Since then, Seio is used in PS2 version, DVD edition, ''Caramel Box Yarukibako Fukkoku-ban'' and anime series.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:OtoBoku game screenshot.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Example of what average conversation looks like in ''Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru''. Here, Mizuho is talking with Kei (left) and Sion (right).]]
The gameplay in ''Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru'' follows a linear plotline where the player interacts at pre-determined times to choose from several options that appear on the [[Computer display|moniter]], as is typically found in the [[visual novel]] style of video games. Each path is divided into eight episodes, one interlude episode and an epilogue. At the end of an episode, an announcement of the next episode appears showing a preview of what is to consist in the next episode. When the game was released on [[DVD]], this same structure was followed. Each episode took place within the span of one month between June and March from episode one to the epilogue. The interlude episode was placed between the second and third episodes.

The goal of the original version's gameplay was for the player to enable to viewing of several [[Hentai|H scenes]] depicting Mizuho and one of the six heroines having [[sexual intercourse]]. When the game was ported to the [[PlayStation 2]] console, the gameplay was altered a little. The PlayStation 2 version, and later the anime adaptation, both had the [[hentai|sexual content]] removed, and in these versions there is no evidence that physical relationships actually take place between any of the students.

There are eight additional sub-episodes and a special sub-episode. The CD and DVD editions contain four sub-episodes, the fandisc ''[[Caramel Box Yarukibako]]'' contains four sub-episodes and a special episode, and the PlayStation 2 version contains six sub-episodes, though the order in which they appeared was altered.
