'''Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.''' (born '''Leslie Lynch King, Jr.''', [[July 14]], [[1913]] &ndash; [[December 26]], [[2006]]) was the 38th [[President of the United States]] (1974&ndash;1977) and 40th [[Vice President of the United States]] (1973&ndash;1974). Prior to 1973, he served for over eight years as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]] of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]; he was first elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1948 from [[Michigan's 5th congressional district]].

Ford was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]], and became President upon [[Richard Nixon]]'s resignation. As president, he signed the [[Helsinki Accords]], marking a move toward [[d<U+00E9>tente]] in the [[Cold War]], even as the former ally [[South Vietnam]] was invaded and conquered by [[North Vietnam]]. Ford did not intervene in Vietamese affairs, but did help extract friends of the U.S. Domestically, the economy suffered from [[inflation]] and a [[recession]] under President Ford. One of his more controversial decisions was granting a presidential [[pardon]] to President [[Richard Nixon]] for his role in the [[Watergate scandal]]. In [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], Ford narrowly defeated [[Ronald Reagan]] for the Republican nomination, but ultimately lost the presidential election to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Jimmy Carter]].

After experiencing health troubles and being admitted to hospital four times in 2006, Ford [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|died]] on [[December 26]] of that year, aged 93.

==Early life==
===Family Life===
[[Image:Gerald Ford 1914.gif|right|thumb|Leslie Lynch King, Jr. (later known as Gerald R. Ford) at age three, 1916]]
Ford was born named Leslie Lynch King, Jr. on [[July 14]], [[1913]], at 12:43 a.m. [[Central Time zone|CST]], at [[Gerald R. Ford Birthsite and Gardens|3202 Woolworth Avenue]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]]. His parents, [[Leslie Lynch King, Sr.]], a wool trader whose father was a prominent banker, and his wife, the former [[Dorothy Ayer Gardner Ford|Dorothy Ayer Gardner]], separated 16 days after his birth. His mother took him to the [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]], [[Illinois]] home of her sister Tannisse and her husband, Clarence Haskins James. From there she moved to the home of her parents, Levi Addison Gardner and his wife, the former [[Adele Augusta Ayer]], in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]]. Ford's parents divorced the following December, the mother gaining full custody.

Gerald Ford later said his biological father was [[spousal abuse|abusive]] and had a history of hitting his mother.<ref name="ford-Nebraska"> {{cite web | last =Funk | first =Josh | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/12/27/nebraska_born_ford_left_state_as_infant/ | title = Nebraska - Born, Ford Left State As Infant | format = | work = Associated Press | publisher = Boston.com | accessdate = 2007-10-06}}</ref> James M. Cannon, who was the executive director of the domestic council during the Ford administration, wrote in a biography of the former president that the Kings' separation and divorce were sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King, Sr. threatened his wife, Dorothy, with a butcher knife and announced his intention to kill her, the baby, and the baby's nursemaid. His first abusive action, according to Ford, occurred on the couple's honeymoon, when King hit his wife for smiling at another man.<ref name="pbs-knife"> {{cite web | last = Cannon | first = James | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/ford.html | title = Gerald R.

Ford was not aware of his biological parentage until he was 17, when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth.

===Sports===
[[Image:Gerald Ford on field at Univ of Mich, 1933.jpg|right|thumb|Ford as a University of Michigan [[American football|football]] player, 1933]]
Ford attended Grand Rapids South High School and was a star athlete and [[captain (sports)|captain]] of his [[American football|football]] team. In 1930, he was selected to the All-City team of the [[Grand Rapids City League]]. He also attracted the attention of college recruiters.<ref name="kunhardt"> {{cite book | last = Kunhardt, Jr. | first = Phillip | authorlink = | coauthors = | origyear = 1999 |title = | url = http://www.americanpresident.org/history/geraldford/biography/resources/ArticlesCopy1/KunhardtFordBio.article.shtml | title = Gerald R.

Attending the [[University of Michigan]] as an undergraduate, Ford played [[center (football)|center]] and [[linebacker]] for the school<U+2019>s football team and helped the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Wolverines]] to undefeated seasons and [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|national titles]] in 1932 and 1933. The team suffered a steep decline in his 1934 senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the team<U+2019>s star nonetheless, and after a game during which Michigan held heavily favored [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach [[Bennie Oosterbaan]] later said, <U+201C>When I walked into the dressing room at half time, I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them.  Ford and [Cedric] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense.<U+201D> Ford himself later recalled, <U+201C>During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds.<U+201D>  His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, <U+201C>They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause.<U+201D><ref name="perry">{{cite book | last = Perry | first = Will | authorlink = | coauthors = | origyear = 1974 |title = | url = http://www.aafla.org/SportsLibrary/FootballStudies/1999/FS0202h.pdf | title = The Wolverines: A Story of Michigan Football|chapter=No Cheers From the Alumni |pages=pp. 150<U+2013>152 | publisher = The Strode Publishers | location = Huntsville, Alabama| isbn = 0-87397-055-1| accessdate = 2006-12-28}}</ref> 

During the same season, in a game against the [[University of Chicago]], Ford <U+201C>became the only future U.S. president to tackle a future [[Heisman Trophy]] winner when he brought down running back [[Jay Berwanger]], who would win the first Heisman the following year.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news | title = Ford one of most athletic Presidents | publisher = [[Associated Press]] via [[MSNBC]] | date = [[2006-12-27]] | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16367165/ | accessdate = 2006-12-31}}</ref> In 1934 Gerald Ford was selected for the Eastern Team on the Shriner<U+2019>s East West Crippled Children game at San Francisco (a benefit for crippled children), played on [[January 1]] [[1935]]. 

As part of the 1935 Collegiate All-Star football team, Ford played against the [[Chicago Bears]] in an exhibition game at [[Soldier Field]].<ref name="greene">{{cite book | last = Greene | first = J.R. | authorlink = | coauthors = | origyear = 1995 |title = | url = | title = The Presidency of Gerald R.

At Michigan, Ford became a member of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity and washed dishes at his fraternity house to earn money for college expenses. Following his graduation in 1935 with a degree in [[political science]] and [[economics]], he turned down contract offers from the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] of the [[National Football League]] in order to take a coaching position at [[Yale University|Yale]] and apply to its law school.

===Law===
Ford hoped to attend Yale's law school beginning in 1935 while serving as boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach, but Yale officials initially denied his admission to the law school, because of his full-time coaching responsibilities.  He spent the summer of 1937 as a student at the [[University of Michigan Law School]]<ref name=umlaw"> {{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.umich.edu/ford/timeline.html | title = The U-M Remembers Gerald R.

His introduction to politics came in the summer of 1940 when he worked in Wendell Willkie's presidential campaign.
While attending [[Yale Law School]], he joined a group of students led by R. Douglas Stuart, Jr., and signed a petition to enforce the 1939 [[Neutrality Act]]. The petition was circulated nationally and was the inspiration for the [[America First Committee]], a group determined to keep the U.S. out of [[World War II]].<ref name="onlinereader"> {{cite web | last = Doenecke| first = Justus D.| authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1990 | url = http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0817988416/ | title = In Danger Undaunted: The Anti-Interventionist Movement of 1940<U+2013>1941 As Revealed in the Papers of the America First Committee (Hoover Archival Documentaries) | format = | work = | publisher = Hoover Institution Press | accessdate = 2006-12-28}} p. 7</ref> Ford's position on U.S. involvement in the war would soon change.

Ford graduated from law school in 1941, and was admitted to the Michigan [[bar (law)|bar]] shortly thereafter. In May 1941, he opened a Grand Rapids law practice with a friend, Philip Buchen,<ref name="utexas-grf-timeline" /> who would later serve as Ford's White House counsel.

==Naval service in World War II==
Ford received a commission as [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]] on [[April 13]], [[1942]]. On [[April 20]], he reported for active duty to the V-5 instructor school at [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], [[Maryland]]. After one month of training, he went to Navy Preflight School in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[North Carolina]], where he was one of 83 instructors and taught elementary seamanship, ordnance, gunnery, first aid and military drill. In addition, he coached in all nine sports that were offered, but mostly in swimming, boxing and football. During the one year he was at the Preflight School, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade|Lieutenant Junior Grade]] on [[June 2]], [[1942]], and to [[Lieutenant]] in March 1943.
[[Image:GeraldFord1945.jpg|left|thumb|Ford in [[United States Navy|Navy]] uniform, 1945]]
Applying for sea duty, Ford was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment for the new aircraft carrier [[USS Monterey (CVL-26)|USS ''Monterey'']], at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], [[New Jersey]]. From the ship's commissioning on [[June 17]], [[1943]] until the end of December 1944, Ford served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board the ''Monterey''. While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]] with the [[United States Third Fleet|Third]] and [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleets]] during the fall of 1943 and in 1944. In 1943, the carrier helped secure [[Makin Island]] in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against [[Kavieng]], New Ireland in 1943. During the spring of 1944, the ''Monterey'' supported landings at [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] and participated in carrier strikes in the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], [[Caroline Islands|Western Carolines]], and northern [[New Guinea]], as well as in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].<ref name="hove"> {{cite book | last = Hove | first = Duane | authorlink = | coauthors = | origyear = 2003 |title = | url = | title = American Warriors: Five Presidents in the Pacific Theater of World War II |pages= |publisher = Burd Street Press | location = | id = ISBN 1-57249-307-0| accessdate =}}</ref><ref name="pacific5"> {{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.americanwarriorsfivepresidents.com/ | title = American Warriors:  Five Presidents in the Pacific Theater of World War II | format = | work = | publisher = Americanwarriorsfivepresidents.com | accessdate = 2006-12-29}}</ref> After overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from the ''Monterey'' launched strikes against [[Wake Island]], participated in strikes in the Philippines and [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyus]], and supported the landings at [[Leyte Island|Leyte]] and [[Mindoro]].

Although the ship was not damaged by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces, the ''Monterey'' was one of several ships damaged by the [[typhoon]] that hit [[Admiral]] [[William Halsey, Jr.|William Halsey]]'s Third Fleet on [[Typhoon Cobra|December 18<U+2013>19, 1944]]. The Third Fleet lost three [[destroyer]]s and over 800 men during the typhoon. The ''Monterey'' was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's aircraft tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hanger deck. During the storm, Ford narrowly avoided becoming a casualty himself. After he left his battle station on the bridge of the ship in the early morning of [[December 18]], the ship rolled twenty-five degrees, which caused Ford to lose his footing and slide toward the edge of the deck. The two-inch steel ridge around the edge of the carrier slowed him enough so he could roll, and he twisted into the catwalk below the deck. As he later stated, "I was lucky; I could have easily gone overboard."

After the fire the ''Monterey'' was declared unfit for service, and the crippled carrier reached [[Ulithi]] on [[December 21]] before proceeding across the Pacific to [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], [[Washington]] where it underwent repairs. On [[December 24]], [[1944]] at Ulithi, Ford was detached from the ship and sent to the Athletic Department of the Navy Pre-Flight School at [[Saint Mary's College of California]], where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945. One of his duties was to coach football. From the end of April 1945 to January 1946, he was on the staff of the Naval Reserve Training Command, [[Naval Air Station Glenview|Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois]] as the Staff Physical and Military Training Officer. On [[October 3]], [[1945]] he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander. In January 1946, he was sent to the Separation Center, [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] to be processed out. He was released from active duty under honorable conditions on [[February 23]], [[1946]]. On [[June 28]], [[1946]], the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] accepted Ford's resignation from the Naval Reserve.

For his naval service, Gerald Ford earned the [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with nine engagement stars for operations in the [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Marshall Islands]], Asiatic and Pacific carrier raids, [[Battle of Hollandia|Hollandia]], Marianas, Western Carolines, Western New Guinea, and the Leyte Operation. He also received the [[Philippine Liberation Medal]] with two bronze stars for Leyte and Mindoro, as well as the [[American Campaign Medal|American Campaign]] and [[World War II Victory Medal|World War II Victory]] medals.<ref name="navy"/>

Ford was a member of several civic organizations, including the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]], [[American Legion]], [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], and [[AMVETS]].Gerald R.

==Marriage and children==
[[Image:Fords wedding 1948.gif|right|thumb|The Fords on their wedding day, [[October 15]], [[1948]]]]
On [[October 15]], [[1948]], at Grace [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] in Grand Rapids, Ford married [[Betty Ford|Elizabeth Bloomer Warren]], a department store fashion consultant. Warren had been a [[John Robert Powers]] fashion model and a dancer in the auxiliary troupe of the [[Martha Graham]] Dance Company. She had previously been married to and divorced from William G.

At the time of his engagement, Ford was campaigning for what would be his first of thirteen terms as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The wedding was delayed until shortly before the elections because, as [[The New York Times]] reported in a 1974 profile of Betty Ford, "Jerry was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced ex-dancer."<ref>{{cite news |first = Jane|last = Howard|author = |coauthors = |url = |title = The 38th First Lady: Not a Robot At All |work = |publisher = The New York Times|pages = |page = |date = [[1974-12-08]]|accessdate = }}</ref>

Following his return from the war, Ford became active in local Republican politics. Grand Rapids supporters urged him to take on [[Bartel J. Jonkman]], the incumbent Republican congressman. Ford had changed his view of the world as a result of his military service; "I came back a converted internationalist", Ford stated, "and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated [[United States non-interventionism|isolationist]]. And I thought he ought to be replaced. Nobody thought I could win. I ended up winning two to one."<ref name=AP/>
During his first campaign in [[United States House elections, 1948|1948]], Ford visited [[Agriculture in the United States|farmer]]s and promised he would work on their farms and milk the cows if elected&mdash;a promise he fulfilled.<ref>{{cite news |first = Melissa|last = Kruse|author = |coauthors = |url =http://www.englishcottagegardens.com/barnhistory.html |title = The Patterson Barn, Grand Rapids, Michigan - Barn razing erases vintage landmark|work = |publisher = The Grand Rapids Press|pages = |page = |date = [[2003-01-03]]|accessdate =2006-12-29}}</ref> In 1961, the U.S. House membership voted Ford a special award as a "Congressman's Congressman" that praised his committee work on military budgets.<ref name="nlhistory"> {{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/P/gf38/about/fordbio.htm | title = Gerald R.

Ford was a member of the House of Representatives for twenty-four years, holding the Grand Rapids [[congressional district]] seat from 1949 to 1973. It was a tenure largely notable for its modesty. As an editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him, Ford "saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler, and the record shows it: he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career."<ref name="nyt-editorial"> {{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =[[2006-12-28]] | url = http://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/ford.html | title = Gerald R.

Appointed to the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]] two years after being elected, he was a prominent member of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense|Defense Appropriations Subcommittee]]. Ford described his philosophy as "a moderate in domestic affairs, an internationalist in foreign affairs, and a [[fiscal conservatism|conservative]] in fiscal policy."

In November 1963, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] appointed Ford to the [[Warren Commission]], a special task force set up to investigate the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the accused assassin.<ref>In 1997 the [[Assassination Records Review Board]] (ARRB) released a document that revealed that Ford had altered the first draft of the report to read: "A bullet had entered the base of the back of [Kennedy's] neck slightly to the right of the spine." Some believed that Ford had elevated the location of the wound from its true location in the back to the neck to support the single bullet theory. ({{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAfordG.htm | title = Gerald Ford | format = | work = | publisher = Spartacus Schoolnet | accessdate = 2006-12-29}}) The original first draft of the Warren Commission Report stated that a bullet had entered Kennedy's "back at a point slightly above the [[shoulder]] and to the right of the [[vertebral column|spine]]." <p>Ford replied in an introduction to a new edition of the Warren Commission Report in 2004:
<blockquote>I have been accused of changing some wording on the Warren Commission Report to favor the lone-assassin conclusion. That is absurd. Here is what the draft said: "A bullet had entered his back at a point slightly above the shoulder and to the right of the spine.<U+201D> To any reasonable person, <U+201C>above the shoulder and to the right<U+201D> sounds very high and way off the side <U+2014> and that<U+2019>s what it sounded like to me. That would have given the totally wrong impression. Technically, from a medical perspective, the bullet entered just to the right at the base of the neck, so my recommendation to the other members was to change it to say, <U+201C>A bullet had entered the back of his neck, slightly to the right of the spine.<U+201D> After further investigation, we then unanimously agreed that it should read, <U+201C>A bullet had entered the base of his neck slightly to the right of the spine.<U+201D> As with any report, there were many clarifications and language changes suggested by several of us.</blockquote>
Ford's description matched a [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0501a.htm drawing] prepared for the Commission under the direction of Dr. James J. Humes, supervisor of Kennedy's autopsy, who in his [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh2/html/WC_Vol2_0178a.htm testimony to the Commission] said three times that the entrance wound was in the "low neck." The Commission was not shown the autopsy photographs.</ref> The Commission's work continues to be debated in the public arena.  

In 1965, Republican members of the House elected Ford as its [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]]. During the eight years (1965&ndash;1973) he served as Minority Leader, Ford won many friends in the House because of his fair leadership and inoffensive personality.<ref name="nlhistory"/> But President Johnson disliked Ford for the congressman's frequent attacks on the administration's "[[Great Society]]" programs as being unneeded or wasteful, and for his criticism of the President's handling of the [[Vietnam War]]. As Minority Leader in the House, Ford appeared in a popular series of televised [[press conference]]s with famed [[Illinois]] Senator [[Everett Dirksen]], in which they proposed Republican alternatives to Johnson's policies. Many in the press jokingly called this "The Ev and Jerry Show".<ref name="ussenate"> {{cite web | last = Ford | first = Gerald | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = [[2001-05-23]] | url = http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Leaders_Lecture_Series_Ford.htm | title = Address by President Gerald R.

==Vice Presidency, 1973&ndash;74==
On [[October 10]], [[1973]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew]] resigned and then pleaded no contest to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering, part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme wherein he accepted $29,500 in bribes during his tenure as governor of Maryland. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Nixon sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement.  The advice was unanimous. 'We gave Nixon no choice but Ford,' [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Carl Albert]] recalled later".<ref name="nyt-editorial" /> 

[[Image:Mr. and Mrs. Ford and Nixon 13 Oct 1973.jpg|left|thumb|The Fords and the Nixons in the White House [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]] following President Nixon's nomination of Ford to be [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], October 1973]]
Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on [[October 12]], the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] had been implemented. The [[United States Senate]] voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on [[November 27]], and on [[December 6]], the House confirmed him 387 to 35.

Ford's tenure as Vice President was little noted by the media. Instead, reporters were preoccupied by the continuing revelations about criminal acts during the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]] and allegations of cover-ups within the [[White House]]. Ford said little about the [[Watergate scandal]], although he privately expressed his personal disappointment in the President's conduct.

Following Ford's appointment, the Watergate investigation continued until [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Alexander Haig]] contacted Ford on [[August 1]], [[1974]], and told him that "[[smoking gun]]" evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had been a part of the Watergate cover-up. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated [[Number One Observatory Circle|vice president's residence]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] However, "Al Haig [asked] to come over and see me," Ford later related, "to tell me that there would be a new [[Watergate tapes|tape]] released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.'"<ref name=AP/>

Immediately after taking the oath of office in the [[East Room (White House)|East Room]] of the [[White House]], he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation.

{{wikisource|Proclamation 4311|The Nixon Pardon}}

The Nixon pardon was highly controversial. Critics derided the move and claimed, a "[[corrupt bargain]]" had been struck between the men.<ref name="kunhardt" /> They claimed Ford's pardon was ''[[quid pro quo]]'' in exchange for Nixon's resignation that elevated Ford to the Presidency. Nixon's Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig, did in fact offer a deal to Ford. [[Bob Woodward]], in his book ''Shadow'', recounts that Haig entered Ford's office on [[August 1]], [[1974]] while Ford was still Vice President and Nixon had yet to resign. Haig told Ford that there were three pardon options: (1) Nixon could pardon himself and resign, (2) Nixon could pardon his aides involved in Watergate and then resign, or (3) Nixon could agree to leave in return for an agreement that the new president would pardon him. After listing these options, Haig handed Ford various papers; one of these papers included a discussion of the president's legal authority to pardon and another sheet was a draft pardon form that only needed Ford's signature and Nixon's name to make it legal. Woodward summarizes the setting between Haig and Ford as follows: "Even if Haig offered no direct words on his views, the message was almost certainly sent. An emotional man, Haig was incapable of concealing his feelings; those who worked closely with him rarely found him ambiguous." 

Despite the situation, Ford never accepted the offer from Haig and later decided to pardon Nixon on his own terms. Regardless, historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons Ford lost the [[United States presidential election, 1976|election in 1976]], an observation with which Ford concurred.<ref name="shanescott">{{cite news |first= Scott |last= Shane |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= For Ford, Pardon Decision Was Always Clear-Cut|url= |format= |work= |publisher= The New York Times|id= |page= A1 |date= |accessdate= 2006-12-29 |quote= }}</ref> In an editorial at the time, ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that the Nixon pardon was "a profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act" that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's "credibility as a man of judgment, candor and competence."<ref name="nyt-editorial" />

Ford's first press secretary and close friend [[Jerald terHorst|Jerald Franklin terHorst]] resigned his post in protest after the announcement of President Nixon's full pardon.  Ford also voluntarily appeared before [[United States Congress|Congress]] on [[October 17]], [[1974]] to give sworn testimony&mdash;the only time a sitting president has done so&mdash;about the pardon.<ref name="utexas-grf-timeline" />

After Ford left the White House in 1977, intimates said that the former President privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of ''[[Burdick v. United States]]'', a 1915 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt.<ref name="shanescott"/>  In 2001, the [[John F. Kennedy Library|John F. Kennedy Library Foundation]] awarded the [[John F. Kennedy]] [[Profile in Courage Award]] to Ford for his pardon of Nixon.<ref name="anoun"> {{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = [[2001-05-01]]| url = http://www.jfklibrary.org/Education+and+Public+Programs/Profile+in+Courage+Award/Award+Recipients/Gerald+Ford/Award+Announcement.htm| title =Award Announcement | format = | work = | publisher = JFK Library Foundation | accessdate =2007-03-31}}</ref>

The 1974 Congressional midterm elections took place less than three months after Ford assumed office. Occurring in the wake of the Watergate scandal, the Democratic Party was able to turn voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the [[United States House elections, 1974|House elections]], taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, and increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats, which was one more than the number needed (290) for a 2/3rds majority, necessary in order to over-ride a Presidential [[veto]] (or to submit a Constitutional Amendment). Perhaps due in part to this fact, the [[94th United States Congress|94th Congress]] overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since [[Andrew Johnson]] was President of the United States (1865<U+2013>1869).<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2007/05/bush-vetoes-less-than-most-presidents.html Bush vetoes less than most presidents], CNN, [[May 1]], [[2007]].

The [[Economy of the United States|economy]] was a great concern during the Ford administration. In response to rising [[inflation]], Ford went before the American public in October 1974 and asked them to "'''W'''hip '''I'''nflation '''N'''ow." As part of this program, he urged people to wear "[[Whip Inflation Now|WIN]]" buttons.<ref>[http://millercenter.virginia.edu/scripps/diglibrary/prezspeeches/ford/grf_1974_1008.html Gerald Ford Speeches: ''Whip Inflation Now''] ([[October 8]], [[1974]]), Miller Center of Public Affairs.

The economic focus began to change as the country sank into a mild [[recession]] and in March 1975, Congress passed and Ford signed into law [[income tax]] rebates as part of the [[Tax Reduction Act of 1975]] to boost the economy. When [[New York City]] faced [[bankruptcy]] in 1975, [[List of mayors of New York City|Mayor]] [[Abraham Beame]] was unsuccessful in obtaining Ford's support for a federal bailout.

Ford was confronted with a potential [[swine flu]] [[pandemic]]. Sometime in the early 1970s, an [[influenza]] strain [[H1N1]] shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans. On [[February 5]], [[1976]], an [[United States Army|Army]] recruit at [[Fort Dix, New Jersey|Fort Dix]] mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized; [[Centers for Disease Control|health officials]] announced that "swine flu" was the cause. Soon after, public health officials in the Ford administration urged that every person in the United States be [[vaccination|vaccinated]].<ref>[http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.htm?programID=06-P13-00009&segmentID=1 Pandemic Pointers.] [[Living on Earth]], [[March 3]], [[2006]].

Despite his reservations about how this program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight public budgeting, Ford still signed the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] of 1975, which established special education throughout the United States. Ford expressed "strong support for full educational opportunities for our handicapped children" according to the official White House press release for the bill signing.<ref>[http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/speeches/750707.htm President Gerald R.

Ford was an outspoken supporter of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], issuing Presidential Proclamation 4383.
<blockquote>
In this Land of the Free, it is right, and by nature it ought to be, that all men and all women are equal before the law.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

===Foreign policy===
[[Image:vietnamescape.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[South Vietnam]]ese civilians scramble to board a U.S. [[helicopter]] during the [[Fall of Saigon|U.S evacuation of Saigon]].]]
All U.S. military forces had withdrawn from Vietnam in 1973. As the North Vietnamese invaded and conquered the South in 1975, Ford ordered the final withdrawal of U.S. civilians from [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] in '[[Operation Frequent Wind]]', and the subsequent [[fall of Saigon]]. On [[April 29]] and the morning of [[April 30]], [[1975]], the U.S. embassy in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] was evacuated amidst a chaotic scene. Some 1,373 U.S. citizens and 5,595 Vietnamese and third country nationals were evacuated by military and [[Air America]] helicopters to [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] ships off-shore.

Ford also faced a foreign policy crisis with the [[Mayaguez Incident]]. In May 1975, shortly after the [[Khmer Rouge]] took power in [[Cambodia]], Cambodians seized the American merchant ship ''Mayaguez'' in international waters. Ford dispatched [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] to rescue the crew, but the Marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as, unknown to the U.S., the ''Mayaguez'' sailors were being released.

===Assassination attempts===
[[Image:Frommeassassinationattempt.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents rush Ford to safety after an assassination attempt by Lynette Fromme.]]
Ford faced two [[assassination attempt]]s during his presidency, occurring within three weeks of each other: while in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[California]] on [[September 5]], [[1975]], [[Lynette Fromme|Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme]], a follower of [[Charles Manson]], pointed a [[M1911 Colt pistol|Colt 45]]-caliber [[handgun]] at Ford. As Fromme pulled the trigger, [[Larry Buendorf]],<ref> http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1026_041026_tv_secret_service2_2.html </ref> a Secret Service agent, grabbed the gun and managed to insert the webbing of his thumb under the hammer, preventing the gun from firing. It was later found that, although the gun was loaded with four cartridges, it was a [[semi-automatic pistol]] and the slide had not been pulled to place a round in the firing chamber, making it impossible for the gun to fire. Fromme was taken into custody; she was later convicted of attempted assassination of the President and was sentenced to life in prison.<ref name="squeakeyparole"> {{cite web | last =McLaren | first = Janet| authorlink = | coauthors = | year = [[2005-06-26]] | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/322697p-275745c.html | title ='Squeaky' up for parole | format = | work = | publisher = New York Daily News | accessdate = 2006-12-31}}</ref>

Seventeen days later, another woman, [[Sara Jane Moore]], also tried to kill Ford while he was visiting [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], but her attempt was thwarted when former Marine [[Oliver Sipple]] deflected her shot.

===Supreme Court appointment===
In 1975, Ford appointed [[John Paul Stevens]] as [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] to replace retiring Justice [[William O. Douglas]]. Stevens had been a judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], appointed by President Nixon.<ref name="stephensJP"> {{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/legal_entity/101/biography | title =John Paul Stevens | publisher = OYEZ| accessdate = 2006-12-31}}</ref> During his tenure as House Republican leader, Ford had led efforts to have Douglas impeached.

===1976 presidential election===
{{main|United States presidential election, 1976}}
Ford reluctantly agreed to run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination. Then-former [[Governor of California]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and the party's [[American conservatism|conservative]] wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in [[South Vietnam]], for signing the Helsinki Accords and for negotiating to cede the [[Panama Canal]] (negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]]). Reagan launched his campaign in the autumn of 1975 and won several [[United States presidential primary|primaries]] before withdrawing from the race at the [[1976 Republican National Convention|Republican Convention]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]]. The conservative insurgency convinced Ford to drop the more [[American liberalism|liberal]] Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of [[Kansas]] Senator [[Bob Dole]].<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/analysis/back.time/9603/29/index.shtml Another Loss For the Gipper.] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[March 29]], [[1976]]. Retrieved on [[2006-12-31]].</ref>

In addition to the pardon dispute and lingering anti-Republican sentiment, Ford had to counter a plethora of negative media imagery. [[Chevy Chase]] often did [[pratfall]]s on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', imitating Ford, who had been seen stumbling on two occasions during his term. As Chase commented, "He even mentioned in his own autobiography it had an effect over a period of time that affected the election to some degree."<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/10-19-2004/0002287784&EDATE= VH1 News Presents: Politics: A Pop Culture History Premiering Wednesday, October 20 at 10:00 p.m. (ET/PT).] ''PRNewswire'' [[October 19]], [[2004]].

President Ford's 1976 election campaign had the advantage that he was an incumbent President during several anniversary events held during the period leading up to the [[United States Bicentennial]]. The Washington, D.C. [[fireworks]] display on the [[Fourth of July]] was presided over by the President and televised nationally.<ref>[http://www.c-span.org/classroom/govt/1976.asp Election of 1976: A Political Outsider Prevails.] C-SPAN.

The 200th anniversary of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] in Massachusetts gave Ford the opportunity to deliver a speech to 110,000 in Concord acknowledging the need for a strong national defense tempered with a plea for "reconciliation, not recrimination" and "reconstruction, not rancor" between the United States and those who would pose "threats to peace."<ref>Shabecoff, Philip. "160,000 Mark Two 1775 Battles; Concord Protesters Jeer Ford -- Reconciliation Plea."

[[Image:Carter and Ford in a debate, September 23, 1976.jpg|thumb|left|Ford (at right) and Jimmy Carter [[United States presidential election debates|debate]].]]
Democratic nominee and former [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor]] Jimmy Carter campaigned as an outsider and reformer; he gained support from voters dismayed by the Watergate scandal. Carter led consistently in the polls, and Ford was never able to shake voter dissatisfaction following Watergate and the Nixon pardon. 

[[United States presidential election debates|Presidential debates]] were reintroduced for the first time since the [[United States Presidential election, 1960|1960 election]]. While Ford was seen as the winner of the first debate, during the second debate he inexplicably blundered when he stated, "There is no Soviet domination of [[Eastern Europe]] and there never will be under a Ford Administration." Ford also said that he did not "believe that the [[Poland|Poles]] consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/debates/history.story/1976.html Election 2000: 1976 Presidential Debates.] ''CNN'' (2001).  Retrieved on [[2006-12-31]].</ref>  In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the ''spirits'' of eastern Europeans seeking independence.  However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner [[Max Frankel]] was visibly incredulous at the response.<ref name="pbs2000">{{cite web | last = Lehrer| first = Jim| authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2000 | url = http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/dod/1976-broadcast.html | title = 1976:No Audio and No Soviet Domination | format = | work = Debating Our Destiny| publisher = PBS| accessdate = 2007-03-31}}</ref>

In the end, Carter won the election, receiving 50.1% of the popular vote and 297 [[United States Electoral College|electoral vote]]s compared with 48.0% and 240 electoral votes for Ford. The election was close enough that had fewer than 25,000 votes shifted in [[Ohio]] and [[Wisconsin]] &ndash; both of which neighbored his home state &ndash; Ford would have won the electoral vote.<ref>[http://www.multied.com/elections/1976state.html Presidential Election 1976 States Carried.] miltied.com.  Retrieved on [[2006-12-31]].</ref> Though he lost, in the three months between the Republican National Convention and the election Ford managed to close what was once a 34-point Carter lead to a 2-point margin. In fact, the [[Gallup poll]] the day before the election showed Ford held a statistically insignificant 1-point advantage over Carter.<ref name="gallup1">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =  | url = http://www.heartheissues.com/americanson-geraldford-200612-g.html | title =Americans On - Gerald Ford| format = | work = Hear The Issues | publisher = Gallup Poll | accessdate = 2007-01-24}}</ref>

Had Ford won the election, he would have been disqualified by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]] from running in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], since he served more than 2 years of Nixon's term.

An article published in ''[[Newsweek]]'' shortly after Ford's death in 2006 discussed the former President's spiritual beliefs and cited evidence that Ford's preference not to openly express his Episcopalian faith in public contributed to his loss to [[Southern Baptist]] former Sunday School teacher Jimmy Carter. Ford's lowest level of support was in the [[Bible Belt]] states of the [[Deep South]] (Carter won every Southern state that year except [[Virginia]]). The 1976 election was arguably the last time to date that the Republican Presidential candidate could be considered the ''less'' conservative candidate relative to his Democratic opponent. While Ford's views on [[abortion]] were often ambiguous, he is often considered the last Republican President to hold [[pro-choice]] views.

==Post-presidential years, 1977<U+2013>2006==
===Activity===
The pardon controversy eventually subsided. Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, opened his 1977 [[inaugural address]] by praising the outgoing President, saying "For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land."<ref name="JC">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = [[1977-01-20]] | url = http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/history/us1945/docs/pres60.htm | title = Jimmy Carter | format = | work = Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents | publisher = University of Seattle | accessdate = 2007-01-17}}</ref>

Ford remained relatively active in the years after his presidency and continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In 1977, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M.

On [[29 October]], [[2001]], in an article by Deb Price, a columnist with the ''[[Detroit News]]'', Ford broke with conservative members of the Republican party by stating that gay and lesbian couples "ought to be treated equally. Period."  He became the highest ranking Republican to embrace full equality for gays and lesbians, stating his belief that there should be a federal amendment outlawing anti-gay job discrimination and expressed his hope that the Republican Party would reach out to gay and lesbian voters.<ref> Price, Deb.

On [[November 22]], [[2004]], New York Republican Governor [[George Pataki]] named Ford and the other living former Presidents (Carter, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) as honorary members of the board rebuilding the [[World Trade Center]].

In a prerecorded [[news embargo|embargoed interview]] with [[Bob Woodward]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in July 2004, Ford stated that he disagreed "very strongly" with the Bush administration's choice of Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction as justification for its decision to [[Iraq War|invade Iraq]], calling it a "big mistake" unrelated to the national security of the United States and indicating that he would not have gone to war had he been President.

On [[August 28]], Ford was released from the hospital and returned with his wife Betty to their California home. On [[October 13]], he was scheduled to attend the dedication of a building of his namesake, the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, but due to poor health and on the advice of his doctors he did not attend, much to his personal disappointment. The previous day, on [[October 12]], however, Ford entered the hospital yet again for undisclosed tests at the Eisenhower Medical Center;<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2006/10/former-president-ford-in-hospital-for.html Former President Ford in hospital for tests.] ''[[Associated Press]]'' via CNN</ref> he was released on [[October 16]]. As a result of his frail health it was announced on [[October 17]] that Ford was considering selling his home near Vail due to the uncertainty as to whether he would be able to return.
