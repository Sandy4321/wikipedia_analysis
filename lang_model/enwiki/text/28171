'''Koenraad Elst''' is a [[Belgian]]  [[writer]] and [[orientalist]] (without [[Academic institution|institutional]] affiliation). He has authored fifteen books on topics related to [[Hinduism]], [[Indian history]], and [[Indian politics]].

== Biography ==
{{Hindu politics}}He was born in [[Leuven]], [[Belgium]], on [[7 August]] [[1959]], into a [[Flemings|Flemish]] [[Catholic]] family. He graduated in [[Indology]], [[Sinology]] and [[Philosophy]] at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]]. He then obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the same university. The main portion of his Ph.D. dissertation on [[Hindu revivalism]] and Hindu reform movements eventually became his book [[Decolonizing the Hindu Mind]]. Other parts of his Ph.D. thesis were published in ''[[Who is a Hindu]]'' and ''[[The Saffron Swastika]]''. He also studied at the [[Banaras Hindu University]] in India. Several of his books have been published by [[Voice of India]].

During a stay at the [[Banaras Hindu University]] between 1988 and 1992, he interviewed many Indian leaders and writers.<ref>Elst, K. Negationism in India</ref> He wrote his first book about the [[Ayodhya]] [[Ayodhya#Ayodhya_Debate|conflict]]. While establishing himself as a columnist for a number of [[Belgian]] and [[India]]n papers, he frequently returned to India to study various aspects of its ethno-religio-political configuration and interview Hindu and other leaders and thinkers. 

In 1989, Elst met [[Sita Ram Goel]] after reading Goel's book ''History of Hindu Christian Encounters''. Elst later sent Goel a manuscript of his first book ''Ram Janmabhoomi Vs. Babri Masjid: A Case Study in Hindu Muslim Conflict''. Goel was impressed with Elst's script: "I could not stop after I started reading it. I took it to [[Ram Swarup]] the same evening. He read it during the night and rang me up next morning. Koenraad Elst's book, he said, should be published immediately."<ref>Goel:How I became a Hindu. ch.9</ref> In August 1990, [[L. K. Advani]] released Koenraad Elst's book about the Ayodhya conflict at a public function.<ref>Goel:How I became a Hindu. ch.9</ref>

He has also written about [[multiculturalism]], [[language policy]] issues, ancient [[Chinese history]] and [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]], [[comparative religion]], and the [[Aryan Invasion Theory (history and controversies)|Aryan invasion]] debate. Elst became a well-known author on Indian politics during the 1990s in parallel with the [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]]'s rise to prominence on the national stage.

==Opinions==

Elst has written at length about fascism and [[totalitarianism]] in India and the West. His book ''[[The Saffron Swastika]]'' analyses the rhetoric of "Hindu fascism". He argues that "while one should always be vigilant for traces of totalitarianism in any ideology or movement, the obsession with [[fascism]] in the [[anti-Hindu]] [[rhetoric]] of the [[Indian secularism|secularists]] is not the product of an analysis of the data, but of their own political compulsions."<ref>Ayodhya and After: Issues Before Hindu Society (1991)</ref>

==Influences ==

Elst has published in English and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. He contributed for example to the conservative magazine [http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_%28tijdschrift%29 Nucleus].<ref>[http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/articles/dutch/afghanistan.html bharatvani.org op.cit.]</ref> He is also a contributor to the "conservative-libertarian" internet magazine [[The Brussels Journal]], the Flemish satirical weekly [['t Pallieterke]] and other Belgian & Dutch publications. He has also written for mainstream Indian magazines like [[Outlook India]]. He wrote a postcript to a book written by American neoconservative and middle-east scholar [[Daniel Pipes]] (''The Rushdie Affair: The Novel, the Ayatollah, and the West''). He has also published critiques of [[Islamism]] in the West.<ref>[http://www.meforum.org/article/395 The Rushdie Rules, by Koenraad Elst, ''Middle East Quarterly'', June 1998]</ref>

He has described himself as "a secular humanist with an active interest in religions, particularly [[Taoism]] and [[Hinduism]], and keeping a close watch on the variegated [[Neopaganism|Pagan]] revival in Europe."<ref>[http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/articles/chr/missionaries.html bharatvani.org op. cit.]</ref> 

He has not adopted Hinduism: "I am neither a [[Hindu]] nor a nationalist. And I don<U+2019>t need to belong to those or to any specific ideological categories in order to use my eyes and ears."<ref>[http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/interviews/sulekha.html Elst interview]</ref> And he wrote: "However, I do readily admit to being a <U+201C>[[Fellow traveller|fellow-traveller]]<U+201D> of [[Dharmic religion|Dharmic civilization]] in its struggle for survival against the ongoing aggression and subversion by well-organized hostile ideologies."<ref>[http://koenraadelst.voiceofdharma.com/reviews/saffronwave.html Voice of Dharma review]</ref>  This admission extends to his political sympathies; "Rest assured that in Hindutva circles, many people count as far more important than I."<ref>[http://koenraadelst.voiceofdharma.org/articles/fascism/PolSec03AyubKhan1.html]</ref> He resists any attempts at direct association with the [[Sangh Parivar]], however, calling his ideology 'Hindu Revivalism'.

Elst had for some years a leftist phase, and had also some interest in the New Age movement, though he writes that  by 1985 he had had enough of the "superficiality and flakiness" of the New Age scene.<ref>[http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/articles/politics/bogey.html Hinduism, Environmentalism and the Nazi Bogey]</ref> In the 1990s he became interested in the European [[Neopagan]] movement, and wrote for some Neopagan publications until 1998.<ref>[http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/articles/politics/bogey.html Hinduism, Environmentalism and the Nazi Bogey]</ref>
