'''Marie Jansen''' (c. 1857 <U+2013> March 20, 1914), was an American actress best known for her roles in musical theatre at the end of the 19th century.  She starred in a number of successful [[Edwardian musical comedies]], [[comic operas]] and comic plays in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and London during the 1880s and 90s. After receiving notice for her role in the American production of ''[[Les noces d'Olivette|Olivette]]'', she became known for her performances in the title role of the original American production of ''[[Iolanthe]]'', in the long-running comic opera ''[[Erminie]]'', the title roles in ''Featherbrain'' and ''Nadjy'', and her role in ''The Oolah''. Later in her career, she performed in [[vaudeville]] and formed her own touring theatre company. Jansen ran into financial difficulties, by the late 1890s, partly due to losses as a producer, that left her in reduced circumstances for the remainder of her life.

==Early life==
Jansen was born in Boston, where she was adopted as an infant by Benjamin and Harriet Johnson and named, '''Harriet "Hattie" Mary Johnson'''.<ref name= Bankruptcy>"Made $500,000, Marie Jansen Went Through It All", ''Lowell Sun'', June 2, 1904, p. 11</ref> Her father was a merchant with the means to send his daughter to the [[New England Conservatory of Music]]. There she appeared in music hall concerts and caught the eye of the British-American orchestra conductor and composer [[John Joseph Braham, Sr.| John Braham]], who felt that she had stage presence and later helped her secure a position with the Comley-Barton Opera Company.<ref name= "Queens">[http://books.google.com/books?id=jJQVAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Queens+of+the+stage++By+Alan+Dale&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ID7qT4fNH-TD6gGHzOjOAQ&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Queens%20of%20the%20stage%20%20By%20Alan%20Dale&f=false Dale, Allen.

From her work in ''The Beggar Student'', Jansen was next chosen by Rudolph Aronson, early in 1884, to sing at New York's [[Casino Theatre (New York City)|Casino Theatre]]. In the spring of 1884 [[Charles Wyndham]] signed Jansen to create at London's [[Criterion Theatre]] the lead role, Mrs. Coney, in ''Featherbrain,'' from the French play ''La T<U+00E9>te de Linotte'' by [[Th<U+00E9>odore Barri<U+00E8>re]] and [[Edmond Gondinet]]. Featherbrain had a successful run of eight months.<ref>"Criterion Theatre", ''London Evening News'', June 24, 1884, p. 2</ref> 

Jansen played the title role in a four month run at the Boston Museum of the comic opera ''Fantine'', by Firmin Bernicat and [[Andr<U+00E9> Messager]] that was adapted by B. E. Woolf and R. M. Field (manager Boston Museum), with additional music supplied by Woolf.<ref>Boston Museum (advertisement), ''[[Boston Daily Globe]],'' January 31, 1885, p. 9</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=UO4PAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Fantine:+A+Comic+Opera+in+Three+Acts%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nPe9UvXiFofpoATz1YLACw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Fantine%3A%20A%20Comic%20Opera%20in%20Three%20Acts%22&f=false "Bernicat and Messager"], ''Fantine: A Comic Opera in Three Acts,'' 1884.

''The Black Hussars'', 1885] Retrieved December 27, 2013</ref>  A year later at the Casino Theatre, she played Javotte in ''[[Erminie]]'', the hit comic opera composed by [[Edward Jakobowski]]. When she joined the cast of ''Erminie'', Aronson added a song for her, ''Sunday after Three, My Sweetheart Comes to Me'', that he adapted from an old German tune. In May 1888, again at the Casino, Jansen created for the American stage the title role in ''Nadjy'', adapted by Alfred Murray from the [[Francis Chassaigne]] operetta, ''Les noces improvises''. Jansen performed the role after only five days rehearsal following [[Sadie Martinot|Sadie Martinot's]] last minute departure over a creative dispute. ''Nadjy'' went on to have a run of 256 performances.<ref>Aronson, Rudolph.

[[File:Marie Jansen as Angelina in The Lion Tamer.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Marie Jansen as Angelina in ''The Lion Tamer'', c. 1892]]
In May 1889 Jansen played Tourouloupi, the wife of Cadi, in ''The Oolah'', the first of three successful comic operas she performed in with [[Francis Wilson (actor)|Francis Wilson's Opera Company]] at the old Broadway Theatre on 41st Street, New York. The Oolah, by Sydney Aronson and [[Charles Lecocq]], was memorable in part for Jansen<U+2019>s rendition of the song, ''Be Good,'' which some considered too suggestive.<ref>"Wilson in ''Oolah''", ''New York World'', May 14, 1889, p. 5</ref><ref>''Be Good,'' ''Emmet County Republican,'' July 18, 1889, p. 3</ref> She was Tessa in Wilson's 1890 Philadelphia production of ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.<ref name=Whowaswho/> In August 1890 she was Lazuli, a traveling perfume peddler, to Wilson's King Anso, in ''The Merry Monarch'', by J. Cheever Goodwin and composers [[Woolson Morse]] and [[Emmanuel Chabrier]], adapted from ''[[L'<U+00E9>toile (opera)|L'<U+00E9>toile]]'' by Chabrier. Jansen next played Angelina, a circus equestrian, opposite Wilson, in ''The Lion Tamer'', opening on December  30, 1891, with book and lyrics by Goodwin, music by Richard Stahl and orchestrations by [[John Phillip Sousa]]. In November 1893 Jansen began a long tour at Boston<U+2019>s [[Howard Athenaeum]] as Trixie Hazelmere the Queen of the Vaudevilles in ''Delmonico's at Six'', a comic play written specifically for her by [[Glen MacDonough]]. Over the season of 1897<U+2013>98 she played Pearl Dodo in a musical farce by Frank Tannehill, Jr., entitled ''The Nancy Hanks''. A subsequent venture into [[vaudeville]] with her own company<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=WOUXAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA877 "''The Junior Munsey''"], Volume 11, October 1901 to March 1902, p. 877. Retrieved December 31, 2013</ref> failed, and by 1904 Jansen was forced into [[bankruptcy]].<ref name= Bankruptcy/>

==Later years==
Jansen was thought to have earned over her career an estimated $500,000,<ref name= Bankruptcy/> but by the time of her bankruptcy she was unable to pay a $7 a-week bill for lodging while working as seamstress and occasionally appearing on stage in minor roles. Reportedly because of her drinking, Jansen<U+2019>s relationship with her twice widowed father<ref>"Marie Jansen's Loss", ''Boston Daily Globe'', March 20, 1894, p. 11</ref> and Lulu, his third wife, soured around 1901. As a result, after Benjamin Johnson's death in January 1906, Jansen received only $500 from his $30,000 estate, with the bulk of the funds going to Lulu Johnson. Jansen eventually failed to convince a Boston court that her stepmother had an undue influence over her father in drafting his final will.<ref>"Marie Jansen", '' Lowell Sun,'' September 22, 1906, p. 4</ref> 

Jansen's last known stage appearance came in the fall of 1908 at New York's Olympic Theatre as a principal performer in comedian Edmond <U+201C>The Wise Guy<U+201D> Hayes' vaudeville show, ''Mardi Gras Beauties''. <ref>"Vaudeville", ''The New York Times'', October 11, 1908, p. X2</ref>

==Death==
Jansen died in March 1914, at [[Winthrop, Massachusetts]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that at the time she was sixty-five. In letters to the Times' editor, both Francis Wilson and William T. Carleton, actors who had known her nearly all her professional life, wrote that Jansen could not have been much older than fifty at the time of death.<ref>"Marie Jansen Dies at 65", ''The New York Times,'' March 21, 1914, p. 13</ref><ref>"Marie Jansen", ''The New York Times,'' Francis Wilson, March 22, 1914, p. 14; "Marie Jansen in ''lolanthe''", ''The New York Times,'' W. T. Carleton, March 27, 1914, p. 10</ref>
