'''Albert Edward Clapp''' (3 May 1867 <U+2013> 3 June 1936) was an English [[Amateur status in first-class cricket#Distinction between amateurs and professionals|professional]] [[cricket]]er who played for [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] and [[Shropshire County Cricket Club|Shropshire]] between 1885 and 1895. He played most of his career in the second tier of [[county cricket]], but did appear ten times for Somerset in [[first-class cricket]]. A right-handed batsman, Clapp began his career playing first-class cricket with Somerset in 1885, and from 1891 he alternated between both Somerset and Shropshire. He made his final county appearance in 1896, while his final recorded match was two years later. He achieved his highest first-class score of 60 [[not out]] against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in his penultimate first-class match.

==Life and career==
Clapp was born in [[Chelsea]], in the west of London on 3 May 1867.<ref name="ciprof">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/10730.html |title=Player profile: Albert Clapp |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref> Eighteen years later, he made his [[county cricket]] debut for [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] as a [[Amateur status in first-class cricket#Distinction between amateurs and professionals|professional]].<ref name="Foot2729">Foot (1986), pp. 27<U+2013>29.</ref> His first match was against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]], and batting as part of the [[Batting order (cricket)#Middle order|middle order]], Clapp scored three runs in the first [[Innings#Cricket|innings]], but was out without scoring in the second.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2987.html |title=Somerset v Hampshire: County Match 1885 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref> He made two further appearances for Somerset that year: in his second, he achieved his highest score of the season, 23 [[not out]], against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2999.html |title=Gloucestershire v Somerset: County Match 1885 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref> while in the third he was recorded as "absent hurt" in both innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3007.html |title=Surrey v Somerset: County Match 1885 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref> At the end of the 1885 season, Somerset were stripped of their first-class status due to their poor performances, and inability to field a full side in all their fixtures.<ref name="foot2328">Foot (1986), pp. 23<U+2013>28.</ref>

During Somerset's years as a "second-class" county, Clapp continued with the team, batting throughout the order as required, and occasionally bowling his [[Types of bowlers in cricket|medium-pace]] deliveries. He achieved two half-centuries for the county during this time, against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] in 1887, and [[Staffordshire County Cricket Club|Staffordshire]] in 1889. His score of 85 not out in the first of those matches was the highest score he made for Somerset, while a return of two wickets for 17 runs against the same team in 1886 was his best bowling analysis for the county.<ref name="Somsdetail">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=3482&opponentmatch=All&playername=R&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=&startscore=&team=Somerset&startseason= |title=Player oracle: AE Clapp where team is Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref> In 1890, Clapp played in eleven of Somerset's scheduled thirteen fixtures, of which the club won all but won, which was a tie against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]]. As a result of this successful season, Somerset were readmitted to first-class cricket for the subsequent 1891 season. For his work, Clapp was allocated part of the <U+00A3>132 that Somerset allocated between their three professional players that summer.<ref name="Foot2729"/>{{efn|According to [[The National Archives]]' currency converter, <U+00A3>132 in 1890 would be the equivalent of <U+00A3>7,905.48 in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/results.asp#mid |title=Currency converter |publisher=[[The National Archives]] |accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref>}}

From 1891, Clapp only appeared infrequently for Somerset, instead playing more often for [[Shropshire County Cricket Club|Shropshire]], a team which primarily played against other "second-class" counties, or against club sides. In late May of 1891, he travelled with Somerset to London to play two matches, against Middlesex and [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]; in his three batting innings he aggregated seven runs, and did not appear for Somerset again that year.<ref name="Somsdetail"/> For the remainder of the season, Clapp appeared for Shropshire, which was highlighted by him scoring a half-century for them against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in August.<ref name="Shropsdetail">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=3482&opponentmatch=exact&playername=R&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=&startscore=&team=Shropshire&startseason= |title=Player oracle: AE Clapp where team is Shropshire |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref> For the following two seasons, Clapp did not play for Somerset, but made his county appearances solely for Shropshire. During this time, he achieved a batting average of 35.66 for Shropshire, and scored six half-centuries and one century, the latter score coming in the second innings of a match against [[Oxfordshire County Cricket Club|Oxfordshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/260/260469.html |title=Oxfordshire v Shropshire: Other matches in England 1893 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref> He also bowled regularly with some success, taking 74 wickets at 16.66.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=3482&opponentmatch=exact&playername=R&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=1893&startscore=&team=Shropshire&startseason=1892 |title=Player oracle: AE Clapp where team is Shropshire from 1892 to 1893 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref>

Clapp made five further first-class appearances for Somerset in 1894 and 1895, though in ten innings he only reached double figures batting twice. On the first of those occasions, he made his highest total in first-class cricket, scoring an unbeaten 60 against Hampshire.<ref name="Somsdetail"/> He also played in a match against the [[South African cricket team in England in 1894|touring South Africans]], though this was not considered first-class, and scored 66 and 84 not out in a high-scoring win for Somerset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/105/105717.html |title=Somerset v South Africans: South Africa in British Isles 1894 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref> He made his final first-class appearance in June 1895, facing Middlesex at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]].<ref name="Somsdetail"/> In all in first-class cricket, Clapp scored 152 runs at an average of 10.85.<ref name="ciprof"/> He continued to play with Shropshire, and scored centuries in consecutive months for the county against the Gentlemen of Cheshire: in July 1895 he scored 141 not out, while in August he improved slightly, being dismissed for 142.<ref name="Shropsdetail"/> His final recorded match for Shropshire was in July 1896, against the Harrow Wanderers, when he got a [[Glossary of cricket terms#P|pair]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/260/260488.html |title=Shropshire v Harrow Wanderers: Other matches in England 1896 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref> In his history of Somerset cricket, David Foot describes Clapp as an "amiable but undistinguished pro".<ref name="Foot2729"/> He died in Bristol on 3 June 1936, aged 69.<ref name="ciprof"/>
