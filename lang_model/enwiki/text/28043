'''Normanby Homestead''' is a heritage-listed [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] at Cunningham Highway, [[Warrill View, Queensland|Warrill View]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It was designed by [[Charles Balding]] and built from 1866 to 1867.  It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 21 October 1992.<ref name=qhr>{{cite QHR|15512|Normanby Homestead|600737|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref>

== History ==
Normanby Homestead was constructed in 1866-67 for the [[George Thorn (senior)|George Thorn]] family of [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]], to a design by Ipswich architect and surveyor, Charles Balding.<ref name=qhr/>

The Normanby Plains south of Ipswich, on which the homestead is located, were named by government surveyor Robert Dixon in 1839, and occupied by European pastoralists from the 1840s.  Initially, Normanby was part of Rosebrook, a 10,000 hectare run on the western side of the Normanby Plains, taken up {{circa|1843}} by NSW pastoralist Donald McIntyre. In 1845 the Rosebrook lease was transferred to George Thorn of Ipswich, former superintendent of the government cattle station at Limestone from 1838, and one of the earliest free settlers at [[Moreton Bay]].  Whilst still a government employee, he had obtained permission to operate a small general store at Limestone, and in 1842 resigned from government service to establish Ipswich's first hotel, the Queen's Arms.  Known as the "father of Ipswich", Thorn represented [[West Moreton]] in the first Queensland Legislative Assembly.  His sons [[George Thorn|George]], [[Henry Thorn|Henry]], [[John Thorn (Queensland politician)|John]] and [[William Thorn (Queensland politician)|William]] followed their father into Queensland politics, with son George becoming the [[Premier of Queensland]].<ref name=qhr/>

In mid-1848, Thorn's property on the Normanby Plains was referred to as Rosebrook.  Later, his son Charles took over a portion of the run, retaining the name Rosebrook; the remainder, about 8,000 hectares, was named Normanby.<ref name=qhr/>

By 1855 George Thorn had made improvements worth about &pound;500 to the property, but the present house was erected only after he acquired the freehold to the homestead block., in 1861.  In September 1866, Ipswich architect Charles Balding called tenders for the construction of a villa residence and outbuildings at Normanby for George Thorn, and it is believed the house was completed in 1867.<ref name=qhr/>

In the early 1870s [[John Thorn (Queensland politician)|John Thorn]] managed Normanby Station for his father until the latter's death in 1876.  In 1875 the homestead was described as a "pine palace" with a lofty, spacious, splendidly polished, and lined interior.  The property was running 20,000 sheep and 2,000 cattle at the time.  In 1878, when Normanby station was put up (unsuccessfully) for auction, the homestead consisted of a roomy house with a verandah all around, kitchen, servants' rooms, stables, coachhouse, outbuildings, garden and orchard.<ref name=qhr/>

In 1881 the property was transferred to Donald Smith Wallace of Melbourne, who had married Thorn's daughter Ida Australia in 1876. The station was run from 1883 to 1893 by managing partner [[Reginald Gardiner Casey]], who in 1888 married Thorn's granddaughter, Evelyn Jane Harris.  Casey was the [[Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly]] for [[electoral district of Warrego|Warrego]] from 1888 to 1893.  Their son, [[Richard Gavin Gardiner Casey]], was to become [[Governor-General of Australia]]. Normanby was still carrying sheep during the Wallace-Casey period.<ref name=qhr/>

In 1893 the Wallace-Casey partnership was dissolved and the property passed in 1894 to the Union Mortgage & Agency Co. of Australia Ltd, and in 1901 to Australian Estates, who subdivided and sold off the run in the following decade, with the first subdivisional sale taking place in November 1906.  During this period the station was run by a series of managers, and cattle became the principal interest.  John Bligh Nutting, a station inspector for Australian Estates, resided in the homestead for some years until acquiring the house and about 360 hectares in 1911.<ref name=qhr/>

George Hunt purchased the homestead on about 13 hectares in 1931, and the present owners have occupied the building since the early 1960s.<ref name=qhr/>

The original gateway to the property still stands, opposite the Warrill View State School.  None of the earlier outbuildings or the former kitchen wing remains, but some vestiges of the 19th century formal garden layout are discernible.  The house was renovated in the 1960s.<ref name=qhr/>
