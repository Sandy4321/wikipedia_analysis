'''Tekno Team 2000''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[tag team]] that competed in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) from 1995 to 1996. The team was composed of Troy ([[Erik Watts]]) and Travis ([[Chad Fortune]]). Although the team started off with a strong [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] from the WWF, they did not continue their initial success. Tekno Team 2000 also left the WWF temporarily to make several appearances in the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA). After returning to the WWF, the team continued to lose matches and was eventually disbanded.
