In [[geology]], '''permafrost''' or '''permafrost soil''' is soil at or below the freezing point of water (0 <U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] or 32 <U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]) for two or more years. Ice is not always present, as may be in the case of nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and it may be in amounts exceeding the potential hydraulic saturation of the ground material. Most permafrost is located in high [[latitude]]s (i.e. land in close proximity to the North and South poles), but '''alpine permafrost''' may exist at high [[altitude]]s in much lower latitudes.

The extent of permafrost can vary as the [[climate change]]s. Today, approximately 20% of the [[Earth]]'s land mass is covered by permafrost (including discontinuous permafrost) or [[glacier|glacial ice]].  Overlying permafrost is a thin ''[[active layer]]'' that seasonally thaws during the summer. [[Plant]] life can be supported only within the active layer since growth can occur only in soil that is fully thawed for some part of the year. Thickness of the active layer varies by year and location, but is typically 0.6&ndash;4 [[metre|m]] (2 to 12 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]]) thick. In areas of continuous permafrost and harsh winters the depth of the permafrost can be as much as 1493&nbsp;m (4510 ft) in the northern [[Lena River|Lena]] and [[Yana River]] basins in [[Siberia]].

==Continuous and discontinuous permafrost==
Permafrost will typically form in any [[climate]] where the mean annual air temperature is less than the freezing point of [[water]]. Exceptions are found in moist-wintered forest climates, such as in Northern Scandinavia and North-Eastern Russia west of the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]], where snow acts as an insulating blanket. The bottoms of glaciers can also be free of permafrost, although this is not common.

Typically, the below-ground temperature will be less variable from season to season than the air temperature, with temperatures tending to increase with depth. Thus, if the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below 0 <U+00B0>C (32 <U+00B0>F), permafrost will form only in spots that are sheltered &mdash; usually with a northerly [[aspect (geography)|aspect]]. This creates what is known as ''discontinuous permafrost''. Usually, permafrost will remain discontinuous in a climate where the mean annual soil surface temperature is between &minus;5 and 0 <U+00B0>C (23 to 32 <U+00B0>F). In the moist-wintered areas mentioned before, there may not be even discontinuous permafrost down to &minus;2 <U+00B0>C. Discontinuous permafrost is often further divided into ''extensive discontinuous permafrost'', where permafrost covers between 50 and 90 percent of the landscape and is usually found in areas with mean annual temperatures between &minus;2<U+02DA> and &minus;4<U+02DA>C (28<U+02DA> and 25<U+02DA> F), and ''sporadic permafrost'', where permafrost cover is less than 50 percent of the landscape and typically occurs at mean annual temperatures between 0<U+02DA> and &minus;2<U+02DA>C (32<U+02DA> and 28<U+02DA>F).

In soil science, the sporadic permafrost zone is abbreviated '''SPZ''' and the extensive discontinuous permafrost zone '''DPZ'''.

There are exceptions in ''un-glaciated'' [[Siberia]] and [[Alaska]] where the present depth of permafrost is a relic of climatic conditions during glacial ages where winters were up to 11 <U+00B0>C (20 <U+00B0>F) colder than those of today. At mean annual soil surface temperatures below &minus;5 <U+00B0>C (23 <U+00B0>F) the influence of aspect can never be sufficient to thaw permafrost and a zone of ''continuous permafrost'' (abbreviated to '''CPZ''') forms. There are also "fossil" cold anomalies in the [[Geothermal gradient]] in areas where deep permafrost developed during the Pleistocene that still persists down to several hundred metres. The Suwa<U+0142>ki cold anomaly in Poland led to the recognition that similar thermal disturbances related to Pleistocene-Holocene climatic changes are recorded in boreholes throughout Poland.

A '''line of continuous permafrost''' in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] (Frozen Ground 28, 2004, p5) is formed from the most northerly points at which permafrost sometimes thaws or is interrupted by regions without permafrost. North of this line all land is covered by permafrost or glacial ice.  The "line" of continuous permafrost lies further north at some [[longitude]]s than others and can gradually move northward or southward due to regional climatic changes.  In the [[southern hemisphere]], most of the equivalent line would fall within the [[Southern Ocean]] if there were land there. Most of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic continent]] is overlain by glaciers.

==Permafrost extent==

Measurement of the depth and extent of permafrost may be an indicator of [[global warming]] as recent years (1998 and 2001) have seen record thawing of permafrost in [[Alaska]] and [[Siberia]]. This thawing has led to stands of trees falling, labelled [[drunken trees]], due to insufficient rooting. In the [[Yukon]], the zone of continuous permafrost has moved 100 kilometres poleward since 1899, but accurate records only go back 30 years. It is thought that permafrost thawing could exacerbate global warming by releasing [[methane]] and other [[hydrocarbon]]s, which are powerful [[greenhouse gases]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1546824,00.html The Guardian]</ref> It also could encourage [[erosion]] because permafrost lends stability to barren Arctic slopes. 

At the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], continuous permafrost covered a much greater area than it does today, covering all of ice-free [[Europe]] south to about [[Szeged]] and the [[Sea of Azov]] (then dry land) and [[China]] south to [[Beijing]]. In [[North America]], only an extremely narrow belt of permafrost existed south of the [[ice sheet]] at about the latitude of [[New Jersey]] through southern [[Iowa]] and northern [[Missouri]]. In the southern hemisphere, there is some evidence for former permafrost from this period in central [[Otago]] and [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Patagonia]], but was probably discontinuous.

==Patterned ground==

[[Patterned ground]] is a term used to describe the distinct, and often symmetrical geometric shapes formed by ground material in periglacial regions.

It has been calculated that the time required to form the deep permafrost underlying [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska]] is 500,740 years. This time extends over several glacial and interglacial cycles of  the  [[Pleistocene]] and suggests that the present climate of Prudhoe Bay is probably considerably warmer than it has been on average over that period. Such warming over the past 15,000 years is widely accepted.<ref>[http://www.crrel.usace.army.mil/techpub/CRREL_Reports/reports/CR95_08.pdf *PAGES for web pdf<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
The table to the right shows that the first hundred metres of permafrost forms relatively quickly but that deeper levels  take progressively longer.

==Construction on permafrost==
[[Image:Raised pipes in permafrost.jpg|thumb|right|Utility lines in a permafrost zone must be above ground]]
Building on permafrost is difficult due to the heat of the building (or [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]) melting the permafrost and sinking.  This problem has three common solutions: using [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] on wood [[pile]]s; building on a thick [[gravel]] pad (usually 1-2 meters/3.3-6.6 feet thick); or using anhydrous ammonia [[heat pipe]]s.  The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] uses insulated heat pipes to prevent the pipeline from sinking. [[Qingzang railway]] in [[Tibet]] was built using a variety of methods to keep the ground cool.

At the ''Permafrost Research Institute'' in [[Yakutsk]], it has been found that the sinking of large buildings into the ground (known to the [[Yakuts]] before Yakutsk was founded) can be prevented by using stilts extending down to about fifteen metres or more. At this depth the temperature does not change with the seasons, remaining at about -5 <U+00B0>C (23F).
