'''Bradley E. Manning''' (born December 17, 1987) is a [[United States Army]] soldier who was arrested in May 2010 in [[Iraq]] on suspicion of having disseminated restricted material to the website [[WikiLeaks]]. He was charged in July that year with transferring [[classified information|classified]] data onto his personal computer and communicating national defense information to an unauthorized source. An additional 22 charges were [[Preferred charge|preferred]]<!-- "preferred" is indeed the correct term, RCM Rule 301. Do not change--> in March 2011, including "aiding the enemy," a capital offense, though prosecutors said they would not seek the [[death penalty in the United States|death penalty]].<ref name=Nicks>Nicks, Denver.

Manning had been assigned in October 2009 to a unit of the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]], based near Baghdad. There he had access to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network ([[SIPRNet]]), used by the United States government to transmit classified information. He was arrested after [[Adrian Lamo]], a computer hacker, reported to the FBI that Manning had told him during online chats in May 2010 that he had downloaded material from SIPRNet and passed it to WikiLeaks. The leaked material is said to have included 250,000 [[United States diplomatic cables leak|U.S. diplomatic cables]], footage of a July 2007 [[July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike|Baghdad airstrike]], and footage of the May 2009 [[Granai airstrike]] in Afghanistan.<ref name=PoulsenJune62010/>

Manning was held in maximum custody from July 2010 in the [[Marine Corps Brig, Quantico]], Virginia, which in effect meant [[solitary confinement]], conditions that [[Amnesty International]] called harsh and punitive. In April 2011, 295 American legal scholars signed a letter saying the detention conditions amounted to a violation of the United States Constitution. Later that month the Pentagon transferred him to a medium-security facility in [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas, allowing him to interact with other pre-trial detainees.<ref name=APApril202011>[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/04/19/us/politics/AP-US-US-WikiLeaks-Army-Private.html?scp=2&sq=%22Bradley+Manning%22&st=nyt "WikiLeaks Suspect Transferred to Fort Leavenworth"], Associated Press, April 20, 2011.</ref>

He was arraigned on February 23, 2012 at Fort Meade, Maryland, as part of the court-martial process, where he declined to enter a plea. No trial date has been set.<ref name=formal_charge>Rizzo, Jennifer [http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/23/bradley-manning-charged/?hpt=hp_t3 "Bradley Manning charged"], CNN, 23 February 2012.</ref> 

==Background==
===Early life and education===
Manning and an older sister were born in [[Crescent, Oklahoma]], to Susan Fox, born in 1953 in Wales, and her American husband, Brian Manning.<ref>Fishman, Steve. [http://nymag.com/news/features/bradley-manning-2011-7/index1.html "Bradley Manning<U+2019>s Army of One"], ''New York'', July 3, 2011, p. 2ff.</ref> His father had been in the [[United States Navy]] for five years; his parents met when his father was stationed in Wales at [[RAF Brawdy#Cawdor Barracks|Cawdor Barracks]]. Manning was raised in Crescent, where his father worked as an IT manager for a rental car agency. The younger Manning was small for his age <U+2013> as an adult, he reached just 5&nbsp;ft 2 in (1.57 m) and weighed 105&nbsp;lb (47.6&nbsp;kg) <U+2013> good at the saxophone, science, and computer games, and even in elementary school had said he wanted to join the U.S. Army. One teacher told reporters that Manning was smart and opinionated, but was never in trouble. He was one of the few people in his community who openly rejected religion; [[David Leigh]] and [[Luke Harding]] write that he would refuse to do homework related to the Bible, and remained silent during the reference to God in the [[Pledge of Allegiance]]. They also write that his father was strict with him, which may have contributed to his becoming introverted and withdrawn, something that deepened when at age 13 he began to question his sexual orientation.<ref name=Leigh201120>Leigh, David and Harding, Luke.

[[File:Haverfordwest Main Street South Wales.jpg|thumb|220px|High Street in [[Haverfordwest]], Wales, where Manning went to secondary school.]]
One neighbor said his mother had difficulty adjusting to life in the U.S., and his father was often away, so Manning was largely left to fend for himself. His parents divorced when he was 13, and he moved with his mother to [[Haverfordwest]], Wales, attending the local [[Tasker-Milward V.C. School|Tasker Milward school]].<ref name=Nicks/> Tom Dyer, who was at school with him, told reporters Manning would speak out if there was anything he disagreed with, which included having altercations with teachers. He said Manning was bullied because he was an American, the only one at the school; other students would imitate his accent and mannerisms.<ref>For his mother not adjusting, and Manning fending for himself, see Thompson, Ginger.

He was miserable in Wales, and decided to return to the United States after sitting his [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]], moving in with his father, sister, and his father's second wife in Oklahoma City. He took a job with a software company, Zoto, and was apparently happy for a time, but was let go after four months, and became increasingly depressed. In March 2006, he reportedly threatened his father's wife with a butcher's knife during an argument. She called the police, and he was escorted from the house. He lived in the pick-up truck his father had given him, and took several low-paid jobs, before moving in with his father's sister, Debra Manning, in Washington, D.C.<ref>[http://nymag.com/news/features/bradley-manning-2011-7/index2.html Fishman, July 3, 2011], p. 3.</ref>

===Enlistment in the U.S. Army and deployment to Iraq===
He enlisted in the army in October 2007, doing his basic training at [[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]], Missouri. Six weeks after enlisting, he was sent to the discharge unit, after doubts arose about his suitability for the army. He was allegedly being bullied for being small and for apparently being gay, and in the opinion of a soldier who spent time with him in the discharge unit was having a breakdown. The decision to discharge him was revoked, for reasons unknown.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/28/bradley-manning-video-transcript-wikileaks "Bradley Manning: fellow soldier recalls 'scared, bullied kid'"], ''The Guardian'', May 28, 2011.

After graduating in April 2008, he moved to [[Fort Huachuca]], Arizona, where he trained as an [[Intelligence analysis|intelligence analyst]]. Nicks writes that he was reprimanded while there for posting messages to friends on ''YouTube'' that apparently revealed sensitive information.<ref name=Nicks/> In August 2008, he was sent to [[Fort Drum]] in Jefferson County, New York, where he trained for a deployment to Iraq.<ref name=Leigh201125>Leigh and Harding 2011, pp. 25<U+2013>26.</ref> It was while there in the fall of 2008 that he met Tyler Watkins, with whom he had his first serious relationship, posting happily on Facebook about it. Nicks writes that it appears to have ended by September 2009, though Leigh and Harding say it ended around May 5, 2010.<ref>[http://thislandpress.com/09/23/2010/private-manning-and-the-making-of-wikileaks-2/ Nicks, September 23, 2010].
* Leigh and Harding 2011, p. 72.</ref> Watkins was studying neuroscience and psychology at [[Brandeis University]] near Boston, and Manning would regularly travel there to visit him. It was at Brandeis that he was introduced to Watkins's network of friends, and the university's [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker community]]. He visited Boston University's "[[hackerspace]]" workshop, and met its founder, David House, the computer scientist and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] researcher who has been allowed to visit him in jail twice a month.<ref name=Leigh201125/>

While at Fort Drum, according to Steve Fishman in ''New York'' magazine, Manning continued to display emotional problems, falling out with roommates and screaming at superior officers, and by August 2009 had been referred to an Army mental-health counselor.<ref name=Fishman1>[http://nymag.com/news/features/bradley-manning-2011-7/ Fishman, July 3, 2011], p. 1.</ref> In October 2009, despite doubts about his fitness to be deployed, he was sent to Iraq with the [[2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division (United States)|2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division]], based at Forward Operating Base Hammer, near Baghdad. His unhappiness and loneliness continued there. Analysts were working 14<U+2013>15 hours at a time in what he described as "a dimly lit room crowded to the point you cant move an inch without having to quietly say <U+2018>excuse me sir,<U+2019> <U+2018>pardon me sergeant major<U+2019><U+200A> ... cables trip you up everywhere, papers stacked everywhere ..." He called it [[Groundhog Day (film)#Legacy|Groundhog Day]].<ref>[http://nymag.com/news/features/bradley-manning-2011-7/index3.html Fishman, July 3, 2011], p. 4.</ref>

===Gender identity disorder, demotion, and discharge===
{{seealso|Trans woman}}
In November 2009 <U+2013> the same month he allegedly first contacted WikiLeaks <U+2013> Manning wrote to a gender counselor in the United States, said he felt female, and discussed having surgery. The counselor later told Steve Fishman that it was clear Manning was in crisis, partly because of his gender confusion, but also because he was opposed to the kind of war he found himself involved in.<ref>[http://nymag.com/news/features/bradley-manning-2011-7/index4.html Fishman, July 3, 2011], p. 5.</ref> 

In April 2010, Manning sent an e-mail to his sergeant major, in which he said he was suffering from [[gender identity disorder]], and to which he attached a photograph of himself dressed as a woman. Capt. Steven Lim, Manning's commander in Baghdad, first became aware of this after Manning's arrest in June 2010, when army investigators found medical information about [[Hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]] in Manning's room in Baghdad, and learned that he had been calling himself Breanna Manning, something his lawyers later referred to as a "female alter-ego."<ref name=Radia>Radia, Kirit and Martinez, Luis.

On May 7 that year, after he punched a female intelligence analyst, Specialist Shulman, in the face, he was demoted from [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] to [[Private First Class]], and was told he would be discharged from the army.<ref name=OKaneMay272011>O'Kane, Maggie; Madlena, Chavala; Grandjean, Guy; and Fisher, Daniel.

==Disclosure of classified material==
===WikiLeaks===
{{seealso|Information published by WikiLeaks}}
[[File:26C3 Assange DomscheitBerg.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=photograph|[[Julian Assange]] and [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]] at the [[Chaos Communication Congress]], Berlin, December 2009. It was Assange who had the idea in 2006 of creating an open-source, democratic intelligence agency.<ref name=Leigh201152/>]]
WikiLeaks was set up in late 2006 as a disclosure portal, initially using the Wikipedia model, where volunteers would write up and analyze classified or restricted material submitted by whistleblowers, or material that was in some other way legally threatened. It was [[Julian Assange]] <U+2013> an Australian with a background in computer hacking, and the ''de facto'' editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks <U+2013> who had the idea of creating what he saw as an "open-source, democratic intelligence agency." The wiki element was abandoned, but the site remained open for the anonymous submission of leaked documents, using [[OpenSSL]], [[Freenet]], [[PGP]], and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].<ref name=Leigh201152>Leigh and Harding 2011, pp. 52<U+2013>56.</ref>

''The New York Times'' wrote in December 2010 that the U.S. government was trying to discover whether Assange had been a passive recipient of material from Manning, or had encouraged or helped him to extract the files; if the latter, Assange could be charged with conspiracy. According to Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a former WikiLeaks spokesman, part of the WikiLeaks security concept was that they did not know who their sources were.<ref name=Assange/>

WikiLeaks did not identify Manning as the source of the material, and according to NBC in January 2011, the U.S. government could find no evidence of direct contact between Manning and Assange. Manning told Lamo during their online chats in May 2010 that he had developed a relationship with Assange, but knew little about him. Lamo alleged later that Manning also said he had communicated directly with Assange using an encrypted Internet conferencing service, and that Assange had "coached" him. Lamo is the only source of these allegations; he said these statements from Manning were in the unpublished parts of the chat logs, but that the FBI had taken his hard drive so he no longer had access to the logs.<ref name=Assange>For the U.S. government trying to determine whether Assange encouraged Manning, and that the government took Lamo's hard drive, see Savage, Charlie.

===Manning's access to SIPRNet, material released by WikiLeaks===
Manning is said to have first contacted WikiLeaks in November 2009, days after it posted [[Information published by WikiLeaks#9/11 pager messages|570,000 pager messages]] from the [[9/11|September 11, 2001, attacks]].<ref>Leigh and Harding, 2011, p. 31.</ref> From his workstation in Iraq, Manning had access to SIPRNet and the [[Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System]], and in late 2009 he found the Apache helicopter video. He told Lamo: "At first glance it was just a bunch of guys getting shot up by a helicopter. No big deal ... about two dozen more where that came from, right? But something struck me as odd with the van thing, and also the fact it was being stored in a JAG officer<U+2019>s directory. So I looked into it."<ref name=PoulsenJune62010/>

[[File:CollateralMurder.ogv|thumb|220px|alt=video|Manning said he gave WikiLeaks the "[[July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike|Apache airstrike]]" video in February 2010.]]
Manning's former partner, Tyler Watkins, told reporters that, while on leave in Boston in January 2010, Manning said he had found some sensitive information and was considering leaking it.<ref name=PoulsenJune62010/> During the same month Manning began posting on Facebook in a way that suggested he was upset about something. According to ''The Daily Telegraph'', he wrote, "Bradley Manning didn't want this fight. Too much to lose, too fast," and said he was livid after being "lectured by ex-boyfriend."<ref>Blake, Heidi; Bingham, John; and Rayner, Gordon.

On February 18, WikiLeaks posted the first of the material that allegedly came from him, a diplomatic cable dated January 13, 2010, from the [[Iceland&nbsp;<U+2013> United States relations#U.S. embassy|U.S. Embassy]] in [[Reykjavik]], Iceland <U+2013> a document now known as Reykjavik13. In the chat log, Manning called this a "test" document.<ref name=Nicks/> On March 15, WikiLeaks posted a 32-page report written in 2008 by the U.S. Department of Defense about WikiLeaks itself. On March 29, it posted U.S. State Department profiles of politicians in Iceland.<ref>For the publishing sequence, see Leigh and Harding 2010, p. 70.

On April 5, it published the Apache helicopter video of the July 2007 Baghdad airstrike, which Manning is alleged to have passed on in February; WikiLeaks called it the "Collateral Murder" video, and it attracted widespread coverage. On July 25, it released the [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghan war documents]], and in October the [[Iraq War documents leak|Iraq War documents]], internal military war logs and diaries. Manning is also alleged to have given them 251,287 U.S. state department cables <U+2013> written by 260 embassies and consulates in 180 countries <U+2013> which were passed by Assange to several news organizations. Several thousand of them were published in stages, the first by WikiLeaks in February 2010 (the Reykjavik13 document), then from November 29 by ''The New York Times'', ''Der Spiegel'', ''The Guardian'', ''El Pa<U+00ED>s'', and others.

===Chats with Adrian Lamo===
[[File:Lamo-Mitnick-Poulsen.png|thumb|220px|alt=photograph|[[Adrian Lamo]] (left) and ''Wired'''s [[Kevin Poulsen]] (right), photographed in 2001 with former computer hacker [[Kevin Mitnick]]]]
Manning had been demoted and told on May 7, 2010 that he was about to be discharged after the incident in which he punched a female intelligence analyst (see above).<ref name=OKaneMay272011/> On May 20, he contacted Adrian Lamo, a former "[[grey hat]]" hacker convicted in 2004 of having accessed ''The New York Times'' computer network without permission. Lamo had been profiled that day by [[Kevin Poulsen]] in ''Wired'' magazine after being hospitalized and diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]]. Poulsen, by then a reporter, was himself a former hacker who had used Lamo as a source several times over the years.<ref>Poulsen, Kevin.

According to Lamo, Manning sent him several encrypted e-mails on May 20 after seeing a tweet from Lamo about WikiLeaks. Lamo said he was unable to decrypt the e-mails but replied anyway, not knowing the recipient or being able to read the content, and invited the e-mailer to chat on AOL IM. Manning sent him more e-mails, also encrypted. Lamo said he later turned these and the earlier e-mails over to the FBI without having read them.<ref name=GreenwaldJune182010>Greenwald, Glenn.

Lamo told him: "I'm a journalist and a minister. You can pick either, and treat this as a confession or an interview (never to be published) & enjoy a modicum of legal protection."

He said he hoped the material would lead to "worldwide discussion, debates, and reforms," and if not we're "doomed as a species...".

===Lamo's approach to the FBI, partial publication of the chat logs===
Lamo told ''Wired'' he had given money to WikiLeaks in the past, and that the decision to go to the authorities had not been an easy one. He said he believed lives were in danger: "[Manning] was in a war zone and basically trying to vacuum up as much classified information as he could, and just throwing it up into the air." Lamo said he had offered journalist-source anonymity to Manning during the chats, but he approached federal agents shortly after their first chat.<ref name=GreenwaldJune182010/> [[Jonathan V. Last]] wrote that Lamo discussed what Manning had told him with Chet Uber of the volunteer group, Project Vigilant, which researches cyber crime, and Uber reportedly told Lamo to go to the FBI. On May 25, Lamo met with FBI and Army CID officers at a Starbucks near his home in California, where he showed them the chat logs. He met them again on May 27, at which point they told him Manning had been arrested in Iraq the day before.<ref name=PoulsenJune62010>Poulsen, Kevin and Zetter, Kim.

The news of Manning's arrest was broken on June 6 by ''Wired'' reporter [[Kevin Poulsen]], who had written the May 20 ''Wired'' profile of Lamo. Daniel Domscheit-Berg described it as the worst moment in the history of WikiLeaks.<ref>Domscheit-Berg 2011, p. 164.</ref> ''Wired'' published around 25 percent of the chat logs on June 6 and June 10, saying the remainder either infringed Manning's privacy or compromised sensitive military information. Ellen Nakashima of ''The Washington Post'' published excerpts on June 10, and on June 19 ''BoingBoing'' published what it said was a more complete version.<ref name=Greenwald1/>

[[Glenn Greenwald]], writing in ''Salon'' in December 2010, called the failure to publish the logs in full "easily one of the worst journalistic disgraces of the year," writing that Poulsen and ''Wired'' had helped conceal the truth about the arrest. "In doing so," he argued, "they have actively shielded Poulsen's longtime associate, Adrian Lamo <U+2013> as well as government investigators <U+2013> from having their claims about Manning's statements scrutinized, and have enabled Lamo to drive much of the reporting of this story by spouting whatever he wants about Manning's statements without any check."<ref name=Greenwald1>Greenwald, Glenn.

===Arrest and charges===

{{seealso|United States v. Bradley Manning}}
Manning was arrested on May 26, 2010, and held at first in a military jail at [[Camp Arifjan]] in Kuwait.<ref name=PoulsenJune162010>Poulsen, Kevin and Zetter, Kim. [http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/06/manning-detainment/ "Three Weeks After Arrest, Still No Charges In WikiLeaks Probe"], ''Wired'' magazine, June 16, 2010.</ref> He was charged on July 5 under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ) with violations of UCMJ Articles 92 and [[General article (military law)#United States|134]] for "transferring classified data onto his personal computer and adding unauthorized software to a classified computer system in connection with the leaking of a video of a helicopter attack in Iraq in 2007," and "communicating, transmitting and delivering national defense information to an unauthorized source and disclosing classified information concerning the national defense with reason to believe that the information could cause injury to the United States," between November 19, 2009, and May 27, 2010.<ref name=CNNAug312010>[http://articles.cnn.com/2010-08-31/us/wikileaks.suspect.attorney_1_bradley-manning-wikileaks-website-leaker?_s=PM:US "Attorney for WikiLeaks suspect says he's seen no evidence on documents"], CNN, August 31, 2010.

On March 1, 2011, an additional 22 charges were preferred<!--this is not a typo, see editor's note above-->, including wrongfully obtaining classified material for the purpose of posting it on the Internet, knowing that the information would be accessed by the enemy; the illegal transmission of defense information; fraud; and aiding the enemy. CBS reported that the new charges involved the leaking of the Afghan and Iraq war logs, and a quarter of a million State Department cables; according to ABC News, the charge sheets said Manning had transferred 380,000 records about Iraq and 90,000 about Afghanistan. In all, CBS said, he stood accused of having leaked over half a million documents and two videos. Prosecutors told Manning's lawyers they would not seek the death penalty, though the charge of aiding the enemy is a capital offense. They said if convicted he would face life imprisonment, reduction in rank to the lowest enlisted pay grade, a [[US Military discharge#Dishonorable|dishonorable discharge]], and loss of pay and allowances.<ref>Miklaszewski, Jim and Kube, Courtney.

===Detention at Marine Corps Base Quantico===
On July 29, 2010, Manning was moved from Kuwait to the Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, and classified as a "maximum custody detainee" held under a "Prevention of Injury" assignment until April 2011. At Quantico he was detained in a 6 x 12&nbsp;ft cell, with no window, furnished with a bed, toilet and sink, and with meals taken in his cell. According to ''The Washington Post'', the facility had 30 cells built in a U shape, and although the detainees could talk to one another, they were unable to see each other, according to his lawyer, [[David Edward Coombs|David Coombs]], a former military attorney and member of the [[United States Army Reserve]]. Coombs said in December 2010 that the guards were professional, and had not tried to bully, harass, or embarrass Manning. He was allowed outside his cell to walk for up to one hour a day, shackled. There was access to television for limited periods when it was placed in the corridor outside his cell. He was allowed to keep one book and one magazine in his cell <U+2013> according to Leigh and Harding, he requested [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781) <U+2013> but otherwise no writing materials, though access to them was given during allotted times. He was shackled during visits.<ref name=detention/>

A Prevention of Injury order is one stop short of suicide watch. It entails checks by guards every five minutes, and no sleeping during the day. His lawyer said he was not allowed to sleep between 5 am (7 am at weekends) and 8 pm, and if he tried to, was made to stand or sit up. He was required to remain visible at all times, including at night, which entailed no access to sheets, no pillow except one built into his mattress, and a blanket designed not to be shredded. Until March 2011, he was required to sleep in boxer shorts, and had experienced chafing of the skin from the heavy blanket.<ref name=detention>For a description of the jail, see Nakashima, Ellen.

On March 2, 2011, he was told that an Article 138 complaint filed in January by his lawyer <U+2013> asking that he be removed from maximum custody and prevention-of-injury watch <U+2013> had been denied. His lawyer said Manning subsequently joked to the guards that, if he wanted to harm himself, he could do so "with the elastic waistband of his underwear or with his flip-flops." This resulted in him being required to sleep without clothing and present himself naked outside his cell for morning inspection, which his lawyer described as ritual humiliation, though from around March 10 onwards he was given a wrap-around smock with Velcro fasteners to sleep in. In response to the incident, the brig psychiatrist classified him as at low risk of suicide.<ref>For details of the new rule, and the brig psychiatrist's classification, see Nakashima, Ellen.

====Manning letter from jail====
Manning's lawyer released an 11-page letter from Manning on March 10, 2011, written to the U.S. military in response to their decision to retain his Prevention of Injury status. In the letter, he described having been placed on suicide watch for three days in January, and having had his clothing removed, apart from underwear, as well as prescription eyeglasses; he said the loss of the latter forced him to sit in "essential blindness."<ref name=PilkingtonMarch112011/>

He wrote that he believed this was done as retribution for a protest his supporters had held outside the jail the day before; he alleged that, just before the suicide watch began, the guards began harassing him and issuing conflicting orders, telling him to turn left, then not to turn left. He also described being required to sleep without clothes and stand naked for morning parade: "The guard told me to stand at parade rest, with my hands behind my back and my legs spaced shoulder width apart. I stood at "parade rest" for about three minutes until the DBS [duty brig supervisor] arrived. ... The DBS looked at me, paused for a moment, and then continued to the next detainee's cell. I was incredibly embarrassed at having all these people stare at me naked. ..." He wrote that the smock he was later given to wear at night was coarse and uncomfortable, and that he regarded the removal of his other clothing as unlawful pretrial punishment.<ref name=PilkingtonMarch112011>Pilkington, Ed.

====Complaints, government response====
The conditions of his detention prompted international concern. David House, the computer scientist allowed to visit him twice a month, said in December 2010 that he had watched Manning change from an intelligent young man to someone who appeared catatonic and had difficulty conducting a conversation. Democratic Rep. [[Dennis Kucinich]] and [[Pentagon Papers]] whistleblower [[Daniel Ellsberg]], a WikiLeaks volunteer, compared the treatment to what happened inside the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib]] prison in Iraq. Ellsberg wrote that it amounted to [[Enhanced interrogation|"no-touch torture"]], and that its purpose was to demoralize Manning so he would implicate WikiLeaks and Julian Assange.<ref>For David House's view, see Brooke, Heather.

A Quantico spokesman said in January 2011 that allegations of mistreatment were "poppycock," and that Manning had been designated "maximum custody" because his escape would pose a national security risk. The spokesman said Manning could talk to guards and prisoners in other cells, though he could not see the prisoners, and left his cell for a daily hour of exercise, and for showers, phone calls, meetings with his lawyer, and weekend visits by friends and relatives. Pentagon spokesman [[Geoff S. Morrell|Geoff Morrell]] and Pentagon General Counsel [[Jeh Johnson]] visited Quantico in February 2011 to examine the conditions of the detention. Morrell said he was impressed by the professionalism of the staff, and that Manning's housing and treatment were appropriate. He said: "It just so happens that the configuration of the brig is that every individual is confined to his or her own cell. He's being provided well-balanced, nutritious meals three times a day. He receives visitors and mail, and can write letters. He routinely meets with doctors, as well as his attorney. He's allowed to make telephone calls. And he is being treated just like every other detainee in the brig."<ref>For the Quantico spokesman's description of detention, see Shane, Scott.

He is an American, and is proud to be serving in the United States Army. His current confinement conditions are troubling to many both here in the United States and abroad. This concern, however, is not a citizenship issue."</ref>

In March 2011, State Department spokesman [[Philip J. Crowley]], speaking to a small audience, called Manning's treatment "ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid"; he resigned two days later, reportedly under pressure from the White House. His remark, described as a personal opinion, prompted reporters to ask President Obama to comment on Manning's detention at a news conference; he replied: "I have actually asked the Pentagon whether or not the procedures that have been taken in terms of his confinement are appropriate and are meeting our basic standards. They assured me that they are. I can't go into details about some of their concerns, but some of this has to do with Private Manning's safety as well."<ref name=Crowley>For Philip J.

In April, 295 American legal scholars signed a letter published in the ''New York Review of Books'' objecting to the conditions of Manning's detention. Signatories included [[Yochai Benkler]] and [[Laurence Tribe]] of [[Harvard Law School]] and [[Bruce Ackerman]] of [[Yale Law School]]. The letter said the conditions of the detention were a violation of the U.S. Constitution, specifically the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment and the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against punishment without trial, and that if the conditions continued they might amount to a violation of the criminal statute against torture: "procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality."<ref name=Ackerman>Ackerman, Bruce and Benkler, Yochai.
