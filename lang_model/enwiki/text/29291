'''Holy Rosary Church''' was a parish erected in 1844 in the small community of [[Manton, Kentucky|Manton]] (also known as Blincoe) in [[Washington County, Kentucky|Washington County]], [[Kentucky]], [[United States]].<ref>Washington County, Annette C. DuPont-Ewing, Arcadia Publishing</ref>  The church was built under the direction of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]].

==Parish and worship space origination==
The cornerstone for Holy Rosary Church, a [[Roman Catholic]] church in Manton was laid November 2, 1844.<ref>''Washington County, Kentucky Bicentennial History 1792-1992''Turner Publishing Company, 1991. ISBN 1-56311-014-8</ref>  The original church is not the one which is presently on this site.  A few years later, in 1848, a new church was built.  This, the present building, was blessed on November 19, 1848.  The building was built of brick with an overall size of 20 x 60 feet.

==Pastors==
One of the first pastors was Rev. Julian Timoleum Pieters.<ref>A History of Kentucky and Kentuckians: The Leaders and Representative Men, E. Polk Johnson, The Lewis Publishing Company, Chicago-New York, 1912</ref>  Records also show Fr. Edward Lynch was an early pastor, who was stationed at Holy Cross between 1866 and 1883.  The current pastor is Fr. Chris Allegra.

==The parish today==
In 1883, a church was built at nearby Fredericktown (also known as 'the Burg').  The parish is a mission church to one at [[Fredericktown, Kentucky]].  The parish is within the [[Diocese of Louisville]].  There are about 200 parishioners.

This historic building is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].
