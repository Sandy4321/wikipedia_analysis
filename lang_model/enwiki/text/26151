A '''heat burst''' is a rare atmospheric phenomenon characterized by gusty winds and a rapid increase in [[temperature]] and decrease in [[dewpoint]]. Heat bursts typically occur during nighttime and are associated with decaying [[thunderstorms]].  While this phenomenon is not fully understood, it is theorized that the event is caused when rain evaporates into a parcel of cold dry air high in the atmosphere making the air more dense that its surroundings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oklahoma "heat burst" sends temperatures soaring|publisher=USA Today|1999-07-08|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wheatbst.htm|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>  The parcel descends rapidly, warming due to compression, overshoots its equilibrium level and reaches the surface, similar to a [[downburst]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Jeffrey|title=Examination of a Long-Lived Heat Burst Event in the Northern Plains|journal=National Weather Digest|volume=27|pages=27-34|publisher=National Weather Association|date=December 2003}}</ref> Recorded temperatures during heat bursts have reached well above 90<U+00B0>F, sometimes rising by 20<U+00B0>F or more.  More extreme events have also been documented, where temperatures have been reported to exceed 130<U+00B0>F, although such extreme events have never been officially verified.
 
==Documented Cases==
*[[Hastings, Nebraska]] experienced a heat burst during the early morning of [[20 June]] [[2006]] when surface temperatures abruptly increased from the mid-70s to 94<U+00B0>F.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}
*On [[16 July]] [[2006]], a heat burst formed in Western Minnesota, pushing [[Canby, Minnesota|Canby]]'s temperature to 100<U+00B0>F, and causing a wind gust of 63 mph <ref>{{cite web|title=Late Night Heat Burst in Western Minnesota on July 16-17, 2006|publisher=National Weather Service, Twin Cities|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mpx/?n=july17,2006|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>.  The [[dew point]] fell from 70<U+00B0>F to 32<U+00B0>F over the course of one hour. 
*[[Oklahoma]], May 22-23, 1999: The temperature in the towns of Chickasha rose from 87.6<U+00B0>F to 101.9<U+00B0>F in just 25 minutes, while the temperature at Ninnekah rose from 87.9<U+00B0>F to 101.4<U+00B0>F in 40 minutes.  In addition, wind damage was reported as winds gusted 95 mph in Lawton, 67 mph in Ninnekah, and 63 mph in Chickasha.  <ref>{{cite web|last=Cappella|first=Chris|title=Heat burst captured by weather network|publisher=USA Today|date=1999-06-23|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wokhtbst.htm|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>
* [[Minnesota]] and [[South Dakota]], March 26, 1998: A temperature increase of 10-20<U+00B0>F was reported in the towns of Marshall, MN, Sioux Falls, SD, Brookings, SD, and Montrose, SD during a two-hour period.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heitkamp|coauthors=Holmes|title=Tri State Area Heat Burst March 26, 1998|publiisher=National Weather Service, Sioux Falls|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/science/heat980326/index.php|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>
*In 1960, the town of Kopperl,[[Texas]], experienced a heat burst sending the air temperature to near 140<U+00B0>F, supposedly causing cotton crops to become desiccated and drying out vegetation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Petricic|first=Dusan|title=It's Raining Eels: A Compendium of Weird Weather|journal=Scientific American Presents|pages=54-55|date=2000|id=ISSN: 1048-0943}}</ref>
*In [[Portugal]] in July 1949, a heatburst reportedly drove the air temperature to 158<U+00B0>F from 100<U+00B0>F two minutes earlier (note that the highest temperature formally recognized on the Earth was 136<U+00B0>F in Libya in 1922, although the former record has not been verified).<ref name="Freaks of the Storm,
