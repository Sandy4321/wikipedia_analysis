==Biography==
Helen Suzman, a native and life-long citizen of South Africa, was born as '''Helen Gavronsky''' in 1917 to  immigrants.

At age 19, she married Dr. Moses Suzman (d. 1994), who was considerably older than she. She had two daughters with him before returning to university as a lecturer in 1944. She gave up teaching for politics, being elected to Parliament in 1953 as a member of the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]]. 

She switched to the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]] in 1959, and represented the [[Houghton Estate, Gauteng|Houghton]] constituency as that party's sole member of parliament, and the sole parliamentarian unequivocally opposed to apartheid, from 1961 to 1974.<ref>In No Uncertain Terms, Memoirs Helen Suzman Jonathan Ball Publishers</ref> She was often harassed by the police and her phone was tapped by them. She had a special technique for dealing with [[eavesdropping]], which was to blow a whistle into the mouthpiece of the phone.<ref name=NYTimesObituary>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/02/world/africa/02suzman.html?pagewanted=1&ref=africa|title=Helen Suzman, Relentless Challenger of Apartheid System, Is Dead at 91 |publisher=New York Times|accessdate=01-10-2009}}</ref>

Suzman was noted for her strong public criticism of the governing [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party's]] policies of [[apartheid]] at a time when this was atypical of white South Africans, and found herself even more of an outsider because she was an English-speaking Jewish woman in a parliament dominated by [[Calvinist]] [[Afrikaner]] men. She was once accused by a minister of asking questions in parliament that embarrassed South Africa, to which she replied: "It is not my questions that embarrass South Africa; it is your answers".<ref>[http://www.hsf.org.za/shelen2.asp The Helen Suzman Foundation]</ref>

Later, as parliamentary white opposition to apartheid grew, the Progressive Party merged with [[Harry Schwarz]]'s Reform Party and became the [[Progressive Reform Party]]. It was renamed the [[Progressive Federal Party (South Africa)|Progressive Federal Party]], and Suzman was joined in parliament by notable liberal colleagues such as [[Colin Eglin]]. She spent a total of 36 years in parliament.<ref>{{cite journal | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Obituary: Helen Suzman | journal =The Economist | volume =390 | issue =8613 | page =73 | publisher =The Economist Newspaper Ltd | location =London, United Kingdom | date =2009-01-10 | url = | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref>

She visited [[Nelson Mandela]] on numerous occasions while he was in prison, and was present when he signed the new [[Constitution of South Africa|constitution]] in 1996.<ref name="C<U+00F4>teSaint-Luc ">{{cite web|url=http://www.cotesaintluc.org/en/HumanRightsWalkway2007|title=C<U+00F4>te Saint-Luc adds name to Human Rights Walkway|accessdate=01-01-2009}}</ref>

Suzman was awarded 27 honorary doctorates from universities around the world, was twice nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]<ref name="Kings">{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news_details.php?news_id=732&year=2008|title=King<U+2019>s confers first Honorary Degree|publisher=kcl.ac.uk|accessdate=01-01-2009}}</ref> and received countless other awards from religious and human rights organizations around the world. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] made her an honorary [[Dame Commander]] (Civil Division) of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1989, becoming a Dame in 1990 with restoration of South Africa to the Commonwealth. <ref name="BBCsuzmandies"/> She was voted #24 in the [[Great South Africans (television series)|Top 100 Great South Africans]] TV series.

Suzman died on [[New Years Day]] [[2009]], aged 91. <ref name="BBCsuzmandies">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7807070.stm|title=Anti-apartheid icon Suzman dies|publisher=BBC|accessdate=01-01-2009}}</ref>  [[Achmat Dangor]], [[Nelson Mandela Foundation]] chief executive, said Suzman was a "great patriot and a fearless fighter against apartheid".
