{{nihongo|'''''Hanzo the Razor'''''|<U+304B><U+307F><U+305D><U+308A><U+534A><U+8535>|Kamisori Hanz<U+014D>}} is a  [[fictional character]] featured in the trilogy of [[Japan]]ese [[jidaigeki]] films of the same name. The films star [[Shintaro Katsu]] (best known for his role as [[Zatoichi]]) as the title character.  He also produced the trilogy through his own Katsu Productions. Lead actresses differ in each film; they include [[Yukiji Asaoka]] playing the character Omino in ''Hanzo the Razor: Sword of Justice''.

==The trilogy==
The trilogy is made up of {{nihongo|''Hanzo the Razor: Sword of Justice''|<U+5FA1><U+7528><U+7259>|Goy<U+014D>kiba}} (1972), {{nihongo|''Hanzo the Razor: The Snare''|<U+5FA1><U+7528><U+7259><U+3000><U+304B><U+307F><U+305D><U+308A><U+534A><U+8535><U+5730><U+7344><U+8CAC><U+3081>|Goy<U+014D>kiba: Kamisori Hanz<U+014D> jigoku zeme}} (1973) and {{nihongo|''Hanzo the Razor: Who's Got the Gold?''|<U+5FA1><U+7528><U+7259><U+3000><U+9B3C><U+306E><U+534A><U+8535><U+3084><U+308F><U+808C><U+5C0F><U+5224>|Goy<U+014D>kiba: Oni no Hanz<U+014D> yawahada koban}} (1974). 

==Premise==
The story is based on the [[manga]] ''Goy<U+014D>kiba'' (<U+5FA1><U+7528><U+7259>) by [[Kazuo Koike]], whose ''[[Lone Wolf and Cub]]'' manga was also adapted as a film series by Katsu, this time starring his brother, [[Tomisaburo Wakayama]].

Each plot details Hanzo Itami's foiling a plot by corrupt officials in [[Edo period]] Japan. Distinguishing characteristics of these films include:

* Hanzo vilifies elitism and corruption, consistently railing against the powers-that-be who continue to threaten Hanzo with hara-kiri for his insolence.
* Hanzo continuously mocks his superior officer, Magobei Onishi, whom Hanzo dubs "Hebi no Magobei" ("Snake Magobei") due to Onishi's penchant for bribes and beautiful women.
* Hanzo is a constable who normally carries a short 2-pronged dagger ([[jutte (weapon)|jutte]]) rather than a sword; this jutte has a hidden, weighted chain within it, which Hanzo uses to block against sword attacks or ensnare fleeing criminals.
* Hanzo consistently utilizes torture (both on himself and on others) as a means of interrogation and self-purification;.
* Hanzo ritualistically [[flagellation|flagellates]] his huge penis so as to make it stronger; this exercise is always followed up by Hanzo's practicing sexual intercourse with a bale of rice. 
* Hanzo's home is filled with exotic traps and weapons to defeat assassins, such as a hidden wall of weapons near his o-furo ([[Furo|Japanese bath]]) and spears that descend from the ceiling.
* Hanzo interrogates female suspects by raping them; later, he drinks sake with them in his o-furo and they immediately become infatuated with him, primarily due to his sexual dexterity.

==Influence on Popular Culture==
* The 2004-2005 anime series ''[[Samurai Champloo]]'' includes occasional appearances by Manzo the Saw, a police inspector who is a parody of Hanzo.
