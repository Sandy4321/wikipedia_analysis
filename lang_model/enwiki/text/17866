==Early life==
Burnett was born in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], in 1838. Determined not to become a [[farmer]], he ran away from home to get an education and eventually married Kitty Hoffman, the daughter of a judge.

==Civil War==
When the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] broke out, Burnett joined the [[2nd Ohio Cavalry]], where he rose to the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]]. After being trampled by a horse and seriously injured, however, he transferred to the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps]] of the [[Department of the Ohio]].

After the assassination of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1865, Burnett was called upon by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin Stanton]] to be an Assistant [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Army|Judge Advocate General]]. Along with him were [[John Bingham]] and [[Joseph Holt]], the Judge Advocate General. The accused conspirators where [[George Atzerodt]], [[David Herold]], [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Lewis Powell]] a.k.a. [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Paine]], [[Samuel Arnold (Lincoln conspirator)|Samuel Arnold]], [[Michael O'Laughlen]], [[Edman Spangler]], [[Samuel Mudd]] and [[Mary Surratt]]. The trail began on May 10, 1865. The three spent nearly two months in court, awaiting a verdict from the jury. Holt and Bingham attempted to obscure the fact that there were two plots. The first plot was to kidnap [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] in exchange for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] prisoners the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] had. The second was to assassinate Lincoln, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] in a plot to throw the government into electoral chaos. It was important for the prosecution not to reveal the existence of a [[diary]] taken from the body of Lincoln's assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]]. The diary made it clear that the assassination plan dated from the 14th of April. The defence surprisingly did not call for Booth's diary to be produced in court. Holt was accused of withholding evidence, but it was never proven.

On June 29, 1865, the eight were found guilty for their involvement in the conspiracy to kill the President. [[Samuel Arnold (Lincoln conspirator)|Arnold]], [[Michael O'Laughlen|O'Laughlen]] and [[Samuel Mudd|Mudd]] where sentenced to life in prison, [[Edman Spangler|Spangler]] six years in prison and [[George Atzerodt|Atzerodt]], [[David Herold|Herold]], [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Paine]] and [[Mary Surratt|Surratt]] were to hang. They were executed July 7, 1865. Surratt was the first woman in American history to be executed. O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Arnold, Spangler and Mudd where pardoned by [[President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] in early 1869.

==Post-Civil War==
After his wife Kitty died, Burnett moved to [[New York]] to practice law, serving as counsel to the [[Buffalo and Erie Railroad]]. He was married a second time, to Sarah Lansing, only to find himself widowed once again in 1877. At this point, Burnett left his children with his late wife's family and relocated to [[New York City]]. He married once again, this time to Agnes Tailer, and moved to an exclusive district of the city. In 1898, [[President of the United States|President]] [[William McKinley]] appointed Burnett federal [[district attorney]] for the southern district of [[New York]] and upon completion of his four-year term, he was reappointed by McKinley's successor, [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. 

Seeking a country home away from the city, Burnett and his wife purchased a horse- breeding farm in [[Goshen, New York]] where Henry raced on the amateur circuit. He died January 4, 1916 and was interred in [[Slate Hill Cemetery]] in Goshen.
