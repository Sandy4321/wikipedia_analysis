'''''Qaisracetus''''' is an extinct [[Protocetidae|protocetid]] [[Archaeoceti|early whale]] known from the [[Eocene]] ([[Lutetian]], {{Mya|48.6|40.4}}) of [[Baluchistan]], [[Pakistan]] ({{Coord|31.0|70.2|display=inline}}, paleocoordinates {{Coord|12.4|65.7|display=inline}}).<ref>{{Paleodb|53242|Qaisracetus}}.

==Etymology==
The genus is named after the [[Qaisrani]] Baloch tribe which assisted Gingerich and his team during their field work.<ref name="q"/> "Qaisra" is also etymologically close to the royal title used in Persian and many Indo-European languages (e.g. Kaiser, Czar, Caesar).<ref name="q">{{Harvnb|Gingerich|Haq|Khan|Zalmout|2001|loc=Etymology, p. 296}}</ref>  The species is named for [[Muhammad Arif]], former paleontologist at the [[Geological Survey of Pakistan]] who contributed significantly to archaeocete paleontology in Pakistan.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gingerich|Haq|Khan|Zalmout|2001|loc=Etymology, p. 298}}</ref>

==Description==
''Qaisracetus'' is known from a dozen specimens, all found in or near the type locality.  Among them are several well-preserved elements, including a well-preserved skull, partial skulls and braincases, several vertebrae including an almost complete sacrum, a left innominate, ribs, and partial limb elements.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gingerich|Haq|Khan|Zalmout|2001|loc=Hypodigm, p. 297}}</ref>

''Qaisracetus'' is smaller than ''[[Pappocetus]]'' and ''[[Babiacetus]]'' but larger than ''[[Indocetus]]''.<ref name="Gin-diagn-296">{{Harvnb|Gingerich|Haq|Khan|Zalmout|2001|loc=Diagnosis, p. 296}}</ref>  ''Qaisracetus arifi'' is almost as complete as ''[[Rodhocetus]] kasranii'', the most complete articulated skeleton of a protocetid, and they were similar in size: the latter had an estimated body weight of {{Convert|620|kg|abbr=on}}, compared to {{Convert|590|kg|abbr=on}} for the former.<ref name="Gin-disc-307">{{Harvnb|Gingerich|Haq|Khan|Zalmout|2001|loc=Discussion, pp. 307<U+2013>8}}</ref>

''Qaisracetus'' has a generalized protocetid skull with the external [[nare]]s located relatively anteriorly (above C<sup>1</sup>) and a relatively broad frontal shield.
The [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] is more narrow in ''Qaisracetus'' than in ''[[Takracetus]]''.<ref name="Gin-diagn-296" />

The four sacral vertebrae are only partially fused: the first two are solidly fused, the third is locked in place by rib-like processes (a [[wikt:pleurapophyis|pleurapophyseal]] [[synchondrosis]]), while the fourth has a caudal (tail-like) morphology including two ventral [[Chevron (anatomy)|chevron processes]].  The fusion between S1 and S2 distinguished ''Qaisracetus'' from other protocetids such as ''[[Protocetus]]'', ''[[Rodhocetus]]'', ''[[Gaviacetus]]'', ''[[Natchitochia]]'', and ''[[Georgiacetus]]''.  ''Qaisracetus''<nowiki>'</nowiki> vertebrae are not [[pachyostosis|dense and thick]] like in ''[[Eocetus]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gingerich|Haq|Khan|Zalmout|2001|loc=Diagnosis, p. 296, 303, Fig. 23}}</ref>  In contrast to ''Qaisracetus'', ''Rodhocetus'' has a sacrum where non of the vertebrae have fused centra, which is [[derived]] to be a protocetid, but ''Rodhocetus'' is [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] in retaining pleurapophyseal connections between all sacral vertebrae.  The sacral morphology of ''Rodhocetus'' and ''Qaisracetus'' indicate protocetids represent a wide range of specializations, although which is ancestral to later whales is unclear.<ref name="Gin-disc-307" />
