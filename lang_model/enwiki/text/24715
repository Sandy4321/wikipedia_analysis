'''Kjerkeberget''' (also called '''Kirkeberget''' or '''Kyrkjeberget''') is a [[hill]] in [[Nordmarka]], [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. 
It lies on the border of the municipalities [[Oslo]] and [[Lunner]] in [[Oppland]].

It is the highest point in the county of [[Oslo]]. During [[World War II]], [[Milorg]] used this hill as a site for parachute drops.

==The name==
The first element is ''kjerke'' f 'church', the last element is the finite form of ''berg'' n 'rocky mountain'. (Several mountains in Norway are called 'the church', because of some likeness in shape with a church.)

The word ''kjerke'' is the form in the dialect of the area - in [[Bokm<U+00E5>l]] ''kirke'', and in [[Nynorsk]] ''kyrkje''.
