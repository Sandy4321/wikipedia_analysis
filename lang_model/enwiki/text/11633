'''Six in the Seven at Eight''', normally called '''6, 7, 8''', is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] TV program broadcasted by [[Canal 7|Channel 7]] since 2009. Its name comes from the fact that in the beginning there were five members in the panel of the program, and its motto was ''you are the sixth one'' (the viewer), transmitting in Channel 7 at 08.00 pm.; abbreviating it so to "6, 7, 8". Late in 2009 the program was moved to 21:00, adding a new broadcasting for the Sundays around the midnight, and adding new guests panelists as well, thus making more than 6 members.<ref>Asteriscos.tv [http://www.asteriscos.tv/noticia-television-472.html Seis, siete, ocho <U+00BF>y ahora a las nueve?] {{es}}</ref>

It was led by [[Mar<U+00ED>a Julia Oliv<U+00E1>n]] and a panel conformed by [[Orlando Barone]], [[Carla Czudnowsky]], [[Eduardo Cabito Massa Alc<U+00E1>ntara]], [[Luciano Galende]] and [[Sandra Russo]], besides a guest analyst who gives his opinion along the program. Mar<U+00ED>a Julia Oliv<U+00E1>n announced in an interview to the internet web site ''Television.com.ar'' that in 2010, January 28 it would be her last participation in the program.<ref>[http://www.tvpublica.com.ar/tvpublica/programa?id=PA-PP-100175 6, 7, 8 en TVP<U+00FA>blica.com.ar]</ref> Thereafter her place was taken by Luciano Galende.

The program was nominated to the 2010 [[Mart<U+00ED>n Fierro Awards]] in the category ''Best Journalistic Program''.

== Synopsis ==

The program reflects critically on the treatment of information by the mass media and on the performance of various political sectors in the country.<ref>[http://www.noticiasurbanas.com.ar/info_item.shtml?sh_itm=f06284f44679db548c81980f3328b787 "678 es un programa de batalla cultural"] {{es}}</ref><ref>[http://argentina-actual.com.ar/actualidad/florencio-randazzo-dijo-que-678-muestra-una-vision-diferente-a-a-la-que-tienen-muchos-medios/ Florencio Randazzo dijo que 678 "muestra una visi<U+00F3>n diferente a a la que tienen muchos medios"] {{es}}</ref>

== Criticism and controversy ==

As of the ''[[Clar<U+00ED>n newspaper]]'' the program uses archive footage to critic the mass media, judges and the political opponents to the national government.<ref>Clarin.com, [http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/2010/01/10/z-02116948.htm <U+00AB>El programa que ataca a los medios cr<U+00ED>ticos cuesta caro<U+00BB>] {{es}}</ref>

On October 13, 2009 the program aired a video that had circulated in blogs. The anonymous video was recorded through a hidden camera, and it shows the journalist and columnist of the newspaper ''[[La Naci<U+00F3>n]]'', [[Carlos Pagni]], in an alleged operation to publish false information for the purpose of damaging the oil company [[Repsol YPF]]. The diffusion of the video was questioned by the [[Partido Solidario]] [[Deputy (legislator)|deputy]] [[Carlos Heller]] who was a guest on the program that day, expressing his objection to the publication of anonymous films. The features of the video were criticised by the panelists after it was shown.
According to an article in La Naci<U+00F3>n that was published the next day about the segment, "the presentation of the ''hidden camera'', and the images of the hiddem camera (Cut, but carefully and professionally edited) don't show at any moment the columnist in situations that could corroborate the serious and injurious charges about corruption that are made in the video through printed boards and a voice-off".<ref name=Video>La Naci<U+00F3>n.com, [http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1186137 <U+00AB>Agravia Canal 7 a un columnista con un video an<U+00F3>nimo<U+00BB>] {{es}}</ref>

In the video, there are appearances by other people who may represent Pagni, receiving money in return for newspaper articles. However, after the airing on October 13, Pagni received the support of the Argentine Journalism Forum (''Foro del Periodismo Argentino'') and other journalists journalists.<ref>[http://www.minutouno.com.ar/minutouno/nota/118506-Periodistas-se-solidarizan-con-Carlos-Pagni/ Cable en Minutouno] {{es}}</ref>

[[YPF]] issued a complaint to investigate who recorded the video, and the veracity of the facts that are seen on it. They assured that "it is true that the video is anonymous and made in a more obscure way. However, it warns that it was a journalistic operation against us".<ref name="p12">[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-133500-2009-10-15.html <U+201C>Igual hubo una operaci<U+00F3>n<U+201D>, por Ra<U+00FA>l Kollmann] {{es}}</ref>

== 678 Facebook ==

The program has a big presence in the social network Facebook where groups and official/unofficial pages show their support to the program.<ref>Facebook, [http://www.facebook.com/pages/678/90091503815 678's Site]</ref> From this space on internet, a manifestation to [[Plaza de Mayo]] was convened to 2010, March 12 to express their support to the government and the TV program. The estimates rounded between 5000 and 15000 people. The newspapers [[Clar<U+00ED>n newspaper|Clar<U+00ED>n]] and [[La Naci<U+00F3>n]] completely ignored the manifestation, and the news channels were absent to cover it. The only presence of media was the one made by the public television ([[Canal 7]]) and by the newspapers ''[[P<U+00E1>gina/12|P<U+00E1>gina 12]]'' and ''[[Diario Perfil|Perfil]]''.<ref>Perfil, [http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2010/03/12/noticia_0039.html Simpatizantes K en la Plaza convocados por "6,7,8"] {{es}}</ref><ref>P<U+00E1>gina 12, [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-141927-2010-03-13.html La emoci<U+00F3>n de estar por lo mismo] {{es}}</ref>

After this event the ''auto-called'' took part of the march for the commemoration and repudiation of the beginning of the [[National Reorganization Process|Last Argentine Dictatorship]] (1976<U+2013>1983). Days later they called to a new mass concentration on April 9 in the [[Obelisk of Buenos Aires]], to defend the new broadcasting law that was approved by the [[Argentine National Congress|congress]] in 2009 and stopped by protective measures made by judges. It also brought a significant number of protesters.<ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-143646-2010-04-10.html <U+201C>Venimos a apoyar la libertad<U+201D>]{{es}}</ref>
