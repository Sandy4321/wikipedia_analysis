{{Smetana operas}}
'''''The Bartered Bride''''' ({{lang-cz|'''Prodan<U+00E1> nev<U+011B>sta'''}}, ''The Sold Fianc<U+00E9>e'') is a [[comic opera]] in three acts by the Czech composer [[Bed<U+0159>ich Smetana]], to a [[libretto]] by [[Karel Sabina]]. The opera is considered to have made a major contribution towards the development of Czech music. It was composed during the period 1863<U+2013>66, and first performed at the [[Provisional Theatre (Prague)|Provisional Theatre]], [[Prague]], on 30 May 1866 in a two-act format with spoken dialogue. Set in a country village and with realistic characters, it tells the story of how, after a late surprise revelation, true love prevails over the combined efforts of ambitious parents and a scheming marriage broker. The opera was not immediately successful, and was revised and extended in the following four years. In its final version, premiered in 1870, it gained rapid popularity and eventually became a worldwide success.

Czech national opera until this time had been represented only by a number of minor, rarely performed works. This opera, Smetana's second, was part of his quest to create a truly Czech operatic genre. Smetana's musical treatment makes considerable use of traditional Bohemian dance forms such as the [[polka]] and [[furiant]], although he largely avoids the direct quotation of folksong. He nevertheless created music which was accurately folk-like, and is considered by Czechs to be quintessentially Czech in spirit. The overture, often played as a concert piece independently from the opera, was, unusually, composed before almost any of the other music had been written.

After a performance at the Vienna Music and Theatre Exhibition of 1892, the opera achieved international recognition. It was performed in Chicago in 1893, London in 1895 and reached New York in 1909, subsequently becoming the first, and for many years the only, Czech opera in the general repertory. Many of these early international performances were in German, under the title ''Die verkaufte Braut'', and the German language version continues to be played and recorded. A German film of the opera was made in 1932 by [[Max Oph<U+00FC>ls]].<ref>{{Imdb title|0023657|Die verkaufte Braut|(1932)}}</ref>

== Context ==
Until the middle 1850s Bed<U+0159>ich Smetana was known in Prague principally as a teacher, pianist and composer of salon pieces. His failure to achieve wider recognition in the Bohemian capital led him to depart in 1856 for Sweden, where he spent the next five years.<ref>Large, pp.&nbsp;67<U+2013>69</ref> During this period he extended his compositional range to large-scale orchestral works in the descriptive style championed by [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]].<ref>Clapham, p.&nbsp;138</ref> Liszt was Smetana's long-time mentor; he had accepted a dedication of the latter's Opus 1: ''Six Characteristic Pieces for Piano'' in 1848, and had encouraged the younger composer's career since then.<ref>Clapham, p.&nbsp;20</ref> In September 1857 Smetana visited Liszt in [[Weimar]], where he met [[Peter Cornelius]], a follower of Liszt's who was working on a comic opera, ''[[Der Barbier von Bagdad]]''.<ref name=Abraham28 /> Reportedly, their discussions centred on the need to create a modern style of comic opera, as a counterbalance to Wagner's new form of [[Gesamtkunstwerk|music drama]]. A comment was made by the Viennese conductor [[Johann von Herbeck]] to the effect that Czechs were incapable of making music of their own, a remark which Smetana took to heart: "I swore there and then that no other than I should beget a native Czech music."<ref name=Abraham28>Abraham, pp.&nbsp;28<U+2013>29</ref>

Smetana did not act immediately on this aspiration. The announcement that a Provisional Theatre was to be opened in Prague, as a home for Czech opera and drama pending the building of a permanent National Theatre, influenced his decision to return permanently to his homeland in 1861.<ref name=Clapham31>Clapham. p.&nbsp;31</ref> He was then spurred to creative action by the announcement of a prize competition, sponsored by the Czech patriot Jan von Harrach, to provide suitable operas for the Provisional Theatre. By 1863 he had written ''[[The Brandenburgers in Bohemia]]'' to a libretto by the Czech nationalist poet [[Karel Sabina]], whom Smetana had met briefly in 1848.<ref name=Clapham31 /><ref>Large, p.&nbsp;43</ref> ''The Brandenburgers'', which was awarded the opera prize, was a serious historical drama, but even before its completion Smetana was noting down themes for use in a future comic opera. By this time he had heard the music of Cornelius's ''Der Barbier'', and was ready to try his own hand at the comic genre.<ref>Large, p.&nbsp;99</ref>

==Writing history==
=== Libretto ===

For his libretto, Smetana again approached Sabina, who by 5 July 1863 had produced an untitled one-act sketch in German.<ref name=Abraham28 /> Over the following months Sabina was encouraged to develop this into a full-length text, and to provide a Czech translation. According to Smetana's biographer [[Brian Large]], this process was prolonged and untidy; the manuscript shows amendments and additions in Smetana's own hand, and some pages apparently written by Smetana's wife Bettina (who may have been receiving dictation).<ref name=Large160 /> By the end of 1863 a two-act version, with around 20&nbsp;musical numbers separated by spoken dialogue, had been assembled.<ref name=Abraham28 /><ref name=Large160>Large, pp.&nbsp;160<U+2013>61</ref> Smetana's diary indicates that he, rather than Sabina, chose the work's title because "the poet did not know what to call it."<ref name=Large160 /> The translation "Sold Bride" is strictly accurate, but the more euphonious "Bartered Bride" has been adopted throughout the English-speaking world.<ref name=Ab31 /> Sabina evidently did not fully appreciate Smetana's intention to write a full-length opera, later commenting: "If I had suspected what Smetana would make of my operetta, I should have taken more pains and written him a better and more solid libretto."<ref name=Abraham28 />

Czech music specialist [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] has observed that, despite the casual way in which ''The Bartered Bride's'' libretto was put together, it has an intrinsic "Czechness", being one of the few in the Czech language written in [[trochee]]s (a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed one) which matches the natural first-syllabus emphasis in the Czech language.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Tyrrell|first= John|editor-first= Laura (ed.)|editor-last= Macy|title= The Bartered Bride (Prodan<U+00E1> nev<U+011B>sta)|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online,|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/|accessdate= 10 June 2009}} {{Subscription}}</ref>

=== Composition ===
As early as October 1862, well before the arrival of any libretto or plot sketch, Smetana had noted down 16&nbsp;bars which later became the theme of ''The Bartered Bride's'' opening chorus. In May 1863 he sketched eight bars which he eventually used in the love duet "Faithful love can't be marred", and later that summer, while still awaiting Sabina's revised libretto, he wrote the theme of the comic number "We'll make a pretty little thing".<ref name=Abraham28 /> He also produced a piano version of the entire overture, which was performed in a public concert on 18 November. In this, he departed from his normal practice of leaving the overture until last.<ref name=Large160 />

The opera continued to be composed in a piecemeal fashion, as Sabina's libretto gradually took shape. Progress was slow, and was interrupted by other work. Smetana had become Chorus Master of the Hlahol Choral Society in 1862, and spent much time rehearsing and performing with the Society.<ref>Large, pp.&nbsp;121&ndash;25</ref> He was deeply involved in the 1864 Shakespeare Festival in Prague, conducting Berlioz's ''Romeo et Juliette'' and composing a festival march.<ref>Clapham.p.&nbsp;32</ref> That same year he became music correspondent of the Czech language newspaper ''N<U+00E1>rodn<U+00ED> listy''. Smetana's diary for December 1864 records that he was still working on the music for ''The Bartered Bride''; the piano score was completed by October 1865. It was then put aside so that the composer could concentrate on his third opera ''Dalibor''.<ref name=Large163>Large, pp.&nbsp;163<U+2013>64</ref> Smetana evidently did not begin the orchestral scoring of ''The Bartered Bride'' until, following the successful performance of ''The Brandenburgers'' in January 1866, the management of the Provisional Theatre decided to stage the new opera that summer. The scoring was completed rapidly, between 20 February and 16 March.<ref name=Large163 />

=== Restructure ===
Smetana began revising ''The Bartered Bride'' as soon as its first performances were complete.<ref name=Ab31>Abraham, p.&nbsp;31</ref> For its first revival, in October 1866, the only significant musical alteration was the addition of a gypsy dance near the start of Act II. For this, Smetana used the music of a dance from ''The Brandenburgers of Bohemia''.<ref name=Large399>Large, pp.&nbsp;399<U+2013>408</ref> When ''The Bartered Bride'' returned to the Provisional Theatre in January 1869, this dance was removed, and replaced with a polka. A new scene, with a drinking song for the chorus, was added to Act I, and Ma<U+0159>enka's Act II aria "Oh what grief!" was extended.<ref name=Large399 />

So far, changes to the original had been of a minor nature; when the opera reappeared in June 1869, however, it had been entirely restructured. Although the musical numbers were still linked by dialogue, the first act had been divided in two, to create a three-act opera.<ref name=Large399 /> Various numbers, including the drinking song and the new polka, were repositioned, and the polka was now followed by a furiant. A "March of the Comedians" was added, to introduce the strolling players in what was now Act III. A short duet for Esmeralda and the Principal Comedian was dropped.<ref name=Large399 /><ref>This duet is reproduced in Large, pp.&nbsp;409<U+2013>13</ref> Just over a year later, ''The Bartered Bride'' reached its final form, when all the dialogue was replaced by [[recitative]].<ref name=Large399 /> Smetana's own opinion of the finished work, given much later, was largely dismissive: he described it as "a toy ... composing it was mere child's play". It was written, he said "to spite those who accused me of being Wagnerian and incapable of doing anything in a lighter vein."<ref>Large, p.&nbsp;160</ref>

==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
[[File:The Bartered Bride as performed at Zoppsot.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=A theatre production, showing a crowd of villagers celebrating outside an inn|Open-air performance at the Waldtheater, Zoppsot, near Danzig, around 1913]]
A crowd of villagers are celebrating at the church fair ("Let's rejoice and be merry"). Among them are Ma<U+0159>enka and Jen<U+00ED>k. Ma<U+0159>enka is unhappy because her parents want her to marry someone she has never met. They will try to force her into this, she says. Her desires are for Jen<U+00ED>k even though, as she explains in her aria "If I should ever learn", she knows nothing of his background. The couple then declare their feelings for each other in a passionate love duet ("Faithful love can't be marred").

As the pair leave separately, Ma<U+0159>enka's parents, Ludmila and Kru<U+0161>ina, enter with the marriage broker Kecal. After some discussion, Kecal announces that he has found a groom for Ma<U+0159>enka <U+2013> Va<U+0161>ek, younger son of Tobi<U+00E1><U+0161> M<U+00ED>cha, a wealthy landowner; the older son, he explains, is a worthless good-for-nothing. Kecal extols the virtues of Va<U+0161>ek ("He's a nice boy, well brought up"), as Ma<U+0159>enka re-enters. In the subsequent quartet she responds by saying that she already has a chosen lover. Send him packing, orders Kecal. The four argue, but little is resolved. Kecal decides he must convince Jen<U+00ED>k to give up Ma<U+0159>enka, as the villagers return, singing and dancing a festive polka.

===Act 2===
The men of the village join in a rousing drinking song ("To beer!"), while Jen<U+00ED>k and Kecal argue the merits, respectively, of love and money over beer. The women enter, and the whole group joins in dancing a furiant. Away from the jollity the nervous Va<U+0161>ek muses over his forthcoming marriage in a stuttering song ("My-my-my mother said to me"). Ma<U+0159>enka appears, and guesses immediately who he is, but does not reveal her own identity. Pretending to be someone else, she paints a picture of "Ma<U+0159>enka" as a treacherous deceiver. Va<U+0161>ek is easily fooled, and when Ma<U+0159>enka, in her false guise, pretends to woo him ("I know of a maiden fair"), he falls for her charms and swears to give Ma<U+0159>enka up.

[[File:Emmy Destinn as Marie.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=An actress in an elaborate head-dress and peasant costume|The celebrated Czech opera singer [[Emmy Destinn]] in the role of Ma<U+0159>enka, circa 1917]]
Meanwhile, Kecal is attempting to buy Jen<U+00ED>k off, and after some verbal fencing makes a straight cash offer: a hundred florins if Jen<U+00ED>k will renounce Ma<U+0159>enka. Not enough, is the reply. When Kecal increases the offer to 300&nbsp;florins, Jen<U+00ED>k pretends to accept, but imposes a condition <U+2013> no one but M<U+00ED>cha's son will be allowed to wed Ma<U+0159>enka. Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract. Alone, Jen<U+00ED>k ponders the deal he has apparently made to barter his beloved ("When you discover whom you've bought"), wondering how anyone could believe that he would really do this, and finally expressing his love for Ma<U+0159>enka.

Kecal summons the villagers to witness the contract he has made ("Come inside and listen to me"). He reads the terms: Ma<U+0159>enka is to marry no one but M<U+00ED>cha's son. Kru<U+0161>ina and the crowd marvel at Jen<U+00ED>k's apparent self-denial, but the mood changes when they learn that he has been paid off. The Act ends with Jenik being denounced by Kru<U+0161>ina and the rest of the assembly as a rascal.

===Act 3===
Va<U+0161>ek expresses his confusions in a short, sad song ("I can't get it out of my head"), but is interrupted by the arrival of a travelling circus. The Ringmaster introduces the star attractions: Esmeralda, the Spanish dancer, a "real Indian" sword swallower, and a dancing bear. A rapid folk-dance, the [[Skocna|sko<U+010D>n<U+00E1>]], follows. Va<U+0161>ek is entranced by Esmeralda, but his timid advances are interrupted when the "Indian" rushes in, announcing that the "bear" has collapsed in a drunken stupor. A replacement is required. Va<U+0161>ek is soon persuaded to take the job, egged on by Esmeralda's flattering words ("We'll make a pretty thing out of you").

[[File:Otto Gortiz as Kezal (white background).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Actor in exaggerated stage pose, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and long heavy coat, carrying an umbrella|The opera singer Otto Gortiz as Kecal, circa 1913]]
The circus folk leave. Vasek's parents &ndash; M<U+00ED>cha and H<U+00E1>ta &ndash; arrive, with Kecal. Va<U+0161>ek tells them that he no longer wants to marry Ma<U+0159>enka, having learned her true nature from a beautiful, strange girl. They are horrified ("He does not want her <U+2013> what has happened?"). Va<U+0161>ek runs off, and moments later Ma<U+0159>enka arrives with her parents. She has just learned of Jen<U+00ED>k's deal with Kecal, and a lively ensemble ("No, no, I don't believe it") ensues. Matters are further complicated when Va<U+0161>ek returns, recognises Ma<U+0159>enka as his "strange girl", and says that he will happily marry her. In the sextet which follows ("Make your mind up, Ma<U+0159>enka"), Ma<U+0159>enka is urged to think things over. They all depart, leaving her alone.

In her aria ("Oh what grief"), Ma<U+0159>enka sings of her betrayal. When Jen<U+00ED>k appears, she rebuffs him angrily, and declares that she will marry Va<U+0161>ek. Kecal arrives, and is amused by Jen<U+00ED>k's attempts to pacify Ma<U+0159>enka, who orders her former lover to go. The villagers then enter, with both sets of parents, wanting to know Ma<U+0159>enka's decision ("What have you decided, Ma<U+0159>enka?"). As she confirms that she will marry Va<U+0161>ek, Jen<U+00ED>k returns, and to great consternation addresses M<U+00ED>cha as "father". In a surprise identity revelation it emerges that Jen<U+00ED>k is M<U+00ED>cha's elder son, by a former marriage <U+2013> the "worthless good-for-nothing" earlier dismissed by Kecal <U+2013> who had in fact been driven away by his jealous stepmother, H<U+00E1>ta. As M<U+00ED>cha's son he is, by the terms of the contract, entitled to marry Ma<U+0159>enka; when this becomes clear, Ma<U+0159>enka understands his actions and embraces him. Offstage shouting interrupts the proceedings; it seems that a bear has escaped from the circus and is heading for the village. This creature appears, but is soon revealed to be Va<U+0161>ek in the bear's costume ("Don't be afraid!"). His antics convince his parents that he is unready for marriage, and he is marched away. M<U+00ED>cha then blesses the marriage between Ma<U+0159>enka and Jen<U+00ED>k, and all ends in a celebratory chorus.

==Reception and performance history==
===Premiere===
The premiere of ''The Bartered Bride'' took place at the Provisional Theatre on 30 May 1866. Smetana conducted; the stage designs were by Josef Macourek and Josef Ji<U+0159>i Kol<U+00E1>r produced the opera.<ref name=Tyrrell>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Tyrrell|first= John|editor-first= Laura (ed.)|editor-last= Macy|title= The Bartered Bride (Prodan<U+00E1> nev<U+011B>sta)|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/|accessdate= 10 June 2009}} {{Subscription}}</ref> The role of Ma<U+0159>enka was sung by the theatre's principal soprano, Eleonora von Ehrenberg <U+2013> who had refused to appear in ''The Brandenburgers'' because she thought her proffered role was beneath her.<ref>Large, p.&nbsp;144</ref> The parts of Kru<U+0161>ina, Jen<U+00ED>k and Kecal were all taken by leading members of the ''Brandenburgers'' cast.<ref>Large, p.&nbsp;164</ref> A celebrated actor, Jind<U+0159>ich Mo<U+0161>na, was engaged to play the Ringmaster, a role which involves little singing skill.<ref name=Tyrrell />

The choice of date proved unfortunate for several reasons. It clashed with a public holiday, and many people had left the city for the country. It was an intensely hot day, which further reduced the number of people prepared to suffer the discomfort of a stuffy theatre. Worse, the threat of an imminent war between Prussia and Austria caused unrest and anxiety in Prague, which dampened public enthusiasm for light romantic comedy. Thus on its opening night the opera, in its two-act version with spoken dialogue, was poorly attended and indifferently received.<ref name=Large165>Large, pp.&nbsp;165<U+2013>66</ref> Receipts failed to cover costs, and the theatre director was forced to pay Smetana's fee from his own pocket.<ref name=Ab31 />

Smetana's friend Josef Srb-Debrnov, who was unable to attend the performance himself, canvassed opinion from members of the audience as they emerged. "One praised it, another shook his head, and one well-known musician ... said to me: 'That's no comic opera; it won't do. The opening chorus is fine but I don't care for the rest.'"<ref name=Ab31 /> Josef Krej<U+010D><U+00ED>, a member of the panel that had judged Harrach's opera competition, called the work a failure "that would never hold its own."<ref name=Large165 />
Press comment was less critical; nevertheless, after one more performance the opera was withdrawn. Shortly afterwards the Provisional Theatre temporarily closed its doors, as the threat of war drew closer to Prague.<ref name=Large165 />

===Later performances===

In the years after its first performance the dearth of available Czech operas meant that ''The Bartered Bride'' reappeared in the Provisional Theatre's repertory at regular intervals. Smetana revived it in October 1866, as part of his first season as the theatre's principal conductor. He brought it back again in January 1869 after revision, and again in the summer of that year, by which time it had had been restructured into three acts. Its metamorphosis was complete by September 1870, when Smetana presented the opera in its definitive version, with all spoken dialogue replaced by recitative.<ref name=Large399 />

A tower in the background is the only other highrise building.|The Metropolitan Opera, New York, around the time of ''The Bartered Bride's'' New York premiere under Gustav Mahler in 1909]]
In February 1869 Smetana had the text translated into French, and sent the libretto and score to the [[Op<U+00E9>ra Comique|Paris Opera]] with a business proposal for dividing the profits. The management of the Paris Opera did not respond.<ref>Large, pp.&nbsp;168<U+2013>69</ref> The opera was first performed outside its native land on 11 January 1871, when [[Eduard N<U+00E1>pravn<U+00ED>k]], conductor of the Russian Imperial Opera, gave a performance at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in St Petersburg. The work attracted mediocre notices from the critics, one of whom compared the work unfavourably to the [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] genre. Smetana was hurt by this remark, which he felt downgraded his opera to [[operetta]] status,<ref>Large, p.&nbsp;171</ref> and was convinced that press hostility had been generated by a former adversary, the Russian composer [[Mily Balakirev]]. The pair had clashed some years earlier, over the Provisional Theatre's stagings of Glinka's ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' and ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]''. Smetana believed that Balakirev had used the Russian premiere of ''The Bartered Bride'' as a means of exacting revenge.<ref>Large, p.&nbsp;210</ref>

''The Bartered Bride'' was not performed abroad again until after Smetana's death in 1884. It was staged by the [[National Theatre (Prague)|Prague National Theatre]] company in Vienna, as part of the Vienna Music and Theatre Exhibition of 1892, where its favourable reception was the beginning of its worldwide popularity among opera audiences.<ref name=Tyrrell /> Since the Czech language was not widely spoken, international performances tended to be in German. The [[United States]] premiere took place at the Haymarket Theatre, [[Chicago]], on 20 August 1893.<ref>{{cite book | last = Holden | first = Amanda | coauthors = (editor), with Kenyon, Nicholas and Walsh, Stephen | title = The Viking Opera Guide | publisher = Viking | location = London | page=989 | isbn = 0-670-81292-7 | year = 1993 }}</ref> The opera was introduced to Germany in 1894 by [[Gustav Mahler]], then serving as Director of the [[Hamburg State Opera]];<ref name=Mitchell111>Hefling, pp.&nbsp;111<U+2013>12</ref> a year later a German company brought a production to the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London.<ref name=Newmarch67>Newmarch, pp.&nbsp;67<U+2013>68</ref> In 1897, after his appointment as Director of the [[Vienna State Opera]], Mahler brought ''The Bartered Bride'' into the company's repertory, and conducted regular performances of the work between 1899 and 1907.<ref name=Mitchell111 /> Mahler's enthusiasm for the work was such that he had incorporated a quote from the overture into the final movement of his First Symphony (1888).<ref name=Mitchell111 /> When he became Director of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York in 1907 he added the opera to its repertory.<ref name=Mitchell111 /> The New York premiere, again in German, took place on 19 February 1909, and was warmly received. ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented on the excellence of the staging and musical characterisations, and paid particular tribute to "Mr. Mahler", whose master hand was in evidence throughout. Mahler chose to play the overture between Acts I and II, so that latecomers might hear it.<ref>{{cite news|title= Bartered Bride at Metropolitan|work= [[The New York Times]]|date= 20 February 1909|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D03E6D91439E733A25753C2A9649C946897D6CF|accessdate= 20 June 2009}} PDF format</ref>

In the years since its American premiere ''The Bartered Bride'' has entered the repertory of all major opera companies, and is regularly revived worldwide. In the English-speaking world, recent productions in London have included the [[Royal Opera House]] (ROH) presentation in 1998, staged at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]] during the restoration of the ROH's headquarters at [[Covent Garden]]. This production in English was directed by [[Francesca Zambello]] and conducted by [[Bernard Haitink]]; it was criticised both for its stark settings and for ruining the Act II entrance of Va<U+0161>ek. It was nevertheless twice revived by the ROH <U+2013> in 2001 and 2006, under [[Charles Mackerras]].<ref>{{cite journal|last= Seckerson|first= Edward|title= Shut your eyes and all is perfect|work= [[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]|date= 11 January 2006|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/the-bartered-bride-royal-opera-house-london--none-onestar-twostar-threestar-fourstar-fivestar-522526.html|accessdate= 21 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= White|first= Michael|title= The bride wore an outfit from Habitat|work= [[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]|date= 13 December 1998|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-critics-the-bride-wore-an-outfit-from-habitat-1191093.html |accessdate= 21 June 2009}}</ref>

The most recent New York Metropolitan staging was in 1996 under [[James Levine]], a revival of John Dexter's 1978 production with stage designs by [[Josef Svoboda]].

==Music==
Although much of the music of ''The Bartered Bride'' is folk-like, the only actual use of authentic folk material is in the Act II furiant,<ref>Large, pp.&nbsp;186<U+2013>87</ref> with a few other occasional glimpses of basic Czech folk melodies.<ref name=Clapham95>Clapham, p.&nbsp;95</ref> The "Czechness" of the music is further illustrated by the closeness to Czech dance rhythms of many individual numbers.<ref name=Tyrrell /> Smetana's diary indicates that he was trying to give the music "a popular character, because the plot [...] is taken from village life and demands a national treatment."<ref name=Large163>Large, pp.&nbsp;163<U+2013>64</ref> According to his biographer John Clapham, Smetana "certainly felt the pulse of the peasantry and knew how to express this in music, yet inevitably he added something of himself."<ref name=Clapham95 /> Historian [[Harold C. Schonberg|Harold Schonberg]] argues that "the exoticisms of the Bohemian musical language were not in the Western musical consciousness until Smetana appeared." Smetana's musical language is, on the whole, one of happiness, expressing joy, dancing and festivals.<ref name=Schonberg>Schonberg, p.&nbsp;78</ref>
{{listen
 | filename = Smetana - Bartered Bride overture.ogg
 | title = Overture to the Bartered Bride
 | description = Performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, 1930}}

The mood of the entire opera is set by the overture, a concert piece in its own right, which Tyrrell describes as "a tour de force of the genre, wonderfully spirited & wonderfully crafted." Tyrrell draws attention to several of its striking features <U+2013> its extended string [[fugato]], climactic [[tutti]] and prominent [[syncopation]]s.<ref name=Tyrrell /> The overture does not contain many of the opera's later themes: biographer Brian Large compares it to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s overtures to ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', in establishing a general mood.<ref>Large, p.&nbsp;173</ref> It is followed immediately by an extended orchestral prelude, for which Smetana adapted part of his 1849 piano work ''Wedding Scenes'', adding special effects such as bagpipe imitations.<ref name=Tyrrell /><ref>Clapham, p.&nbsp;59</ref>

Schonberg has suggested that Bohemian composers express melancholy in a delicate, elegiac manner "without the crushing world-weariness and pessimism of the Russians."<ref name=Schonberg /> Thus, Ma<U+0159>enka's unhappiness is illustrated in the opening chorus by a brief switch to the minor key; likewise, the inherent pathos of Va<U+0161>ek's character is demonstrated by the dark minor key music of his Act III solo.<ref name=Tyrrell /> Smetana also uses the technique of musical reminiscence, where particular themes are used as reminders of other parts of the action; the lilting clarinet theme of "faithful love" is an example, though it and other instances fall short of being full-blown [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] leading themes or ''[[Leitmotif]]s''.<ref name=Large174>Large, pp.&nbsp;174&ndash;75</ref>

Large has commented that despite the colour and vigour of the music, there is little by way of characterisation, except in the cases of Kecal and, to a lesser extent, the loving pair and the unfortunate Va<U+0161>ek. The two sets of parents and the various circus folk are all conventional and "penny-plain" figures.<ref name=Large174 /> In contrast, Kecal's character &ndash; that of a self-important, pig-headed, loquacious bungler &ndash; is instantly established by his rapid-patter music.<ref name=Tyrrell /><ref name=Large174 /> Large suggests that the character may have been modelled on that of the boastful Baron in [[Domenico Cimarosa|Cimarosa]]'s opera ''[[Il matrimonio segreto]]''.<ref name=Large174 /> Ma<U+0159>enka's temperament is shown in vocal flourishes which include [[coloratura]] passages and sustained high notes, while Jen<U+00ED>k's good nature is reflected in the warmth of his music, generally in the G minor key. For Va<U+0161>ek's dual image, comic and pathetic, Smetana uses the major key to depict comedy, the minor for sorrow. Large suggests that Va<U+0161>ek's musical stammer, portrayed especially in his opening Act II song, was taken from Mozart's character Don Curzio in ''The Marriage of Figaro''.<ref>Large, pp.&nbsp;176&ndash;78</ref>

==Film adaptation==
A silent film of ''The Bartered Bride'' was made in 1913 by the Czech film production studio Kinofa. It was produced by Max Urban and starred his wife Andul<U+00E1> Sedlackov<U+00E1>.<ref>{{cite book|last= Osnes|first= Beth|title= Acting|publisher= ABC-Clio|url= http://books.google.com/?id=WTkCI62oXjEC&pg=PA82|location= Oxford|year= 2001|isbn= 0-87436-795-6|accessdate= 13 July 2009}}</ref> A German language version of the opera, ''[[The Bartered Bride (1932 film)|Die verkaufte Braut]]'', was filmed in [[1932 in film|1932]] by [[Max Oph<U+00FC>ls]] (1902&ndash;57), the celebrated German director then at the beginning of his film-making career.<ref name=cinema>{{cite web|title= Moving Pictures: The European Films of Max Ophuls|url= http://cinema.wisc.edu/series/2008_fall/ophuls.htm|publisher= University of Wisconsin|accessdate= 6 July 2009}}</ref> The screenplay was drawn from Sabina's libretto by Curt Alexander, and Smetana's music was adapted by the German composer of film music, Theo Mackeben. The film starred the leading Czech opera singer [[Jarmila Novotn<U+00E1>]] in the role of Ma<U+0159>enka ("Marie" in the film), and the German baritone [[Willi Domgraf-Fassbaender]] as Jen<U+00ED>k ("Hans"). The veteran comedy film actor [[Max Schreck]] also appeared in the film, in the small role of "Muff", the circus comedian.<ref>{{cite web|title= Die verkaufte Braut|url= http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/56514|publisher= British Film Institute|accessdate= 6 July 2009}}</ref>

Ophuls constructed an entire Czech village in the studio to provide an authentic background.<ref name=cinema /> Following the film's US release in 1934, ''The New York Times'' (''NYT'') commented that it "carr[ied] most of the comedy of the original" but was "rather weak on the musical side", despite the presence of stars such as Novotn<U+00E1>. Opera-lovers, the ''NYT'' reviewer suggested, should not expect too much, but the work nevertheless gave an attractive portrait of Bohemian village life in the mid-19th century. The reviewer found most of the acting first-rate, but commented that "the photography and sound reproduction are none too clear at times."<ref>{{cite news|title = Verkaufte Braut (1932)|work= [[The New York Times]]|url= http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9C00E7DB1239E33ABC4F51DFB266838F629EDE&scp=3&sq=Verkaufte%20Braut%20&st=cse|date= 27 April 1934|accessdate= 6 July 2009|datefrmat= dmy}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>
