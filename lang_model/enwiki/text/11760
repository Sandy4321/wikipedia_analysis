Inhabitants of Milan are referred to as "Milanese" (Italian: {{lang|it|''Milanesi''}} or informally {{lang|it|''Meneghini''}} or {{lang|it|''Ambrosiani''}}). The city is nicknamed by Milan<U+00B4>s inhabitants the ''"moral capital"''.<ref name="britannica.com"/> 

== History ==
{{See also|List of rulers of Milan|Governors of the Duchy of Milan}}
=== Etymology ===
The word ''Milan'' derives from the Latin name ''Mediolanum''. This name is borne by a number of Gallo-Roman sites in France, such as [[Mediolanum Santonum]] (Saintes) and [[Mediolanum Aulercorum]] (<U+00C9>vreux) and appears to contain the Celtic element -lan, signifying an enclosure or demarcated territory (source of the Welsh word 'llan', meaning a sanctuary or church). Hence, ''Mediolanum'' could signify the central town or sanctuary of a particular [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]].<ref name="World"/><ref name="InternationalStudent">{{cite web |url=http://internationalrelations.unicatt.it/it/international_student/the_history_of_milan |title=The History of Milan | Relazioni Internazionali - Universit<U+00E0> Cattolica del Sacro Cuore |publisher=internationalrelations.unicatt.it |accessdate=2010-01-14 }}</ref>

The origin of the name and of a [[Wild boar|boar]] as a symbol of the city are fancifully accounted for in [[Andrea Alciato]]'s ''Emblemata'' (1584), beneath a woodcut of the first raising of the [[Defensive wall|city walls]], where a boar is seen lifted from the excavation, and  the etymology of ''Mediolanum'' given as "half-wool",<ref>''medius'' + ''lanum''; Alciato's "etymology" is intentionally far-fetched.</ref> explained in Latin and in French. The foundation of Milan is credited to two [[Celts|Celtic peoples]], the [[Bituriges]] and the [[Aedui]], having as their [[emblem]]s a ram and a boar;<ref>''Bituricis vervex, Heduis dat sucula signum.''</ref> therefore "The city's symbol is a wool-bearing boar, an animal of double form, here with sharp bristles, there with sleek wool."<ref>''Laniger huic signum sus est, anim<U+00E1>lque biforme, Acribus hinc setis, lanitio inde levi.''</ref> Alciato credits the most saintly and learned [[Ambrose]] for his account.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/emblem.php?id=FALc002 |title=Alciato, '&#39;Emblemata'&#39;, Emblema II |publisher=Emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>  

The German name for the city is ''Mailand'', while in the local [[Western dialects of Lombard language|Western Lombard]] dialect, the city's name is Mil<U+00E1>n.

===Celtic and Roman times===
{{Main|Mediolanum}}
[[File:Ruins-imperial-complex-milan-.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of the Emperor's palace in Milan. Here [[Constantine I|Costantinus]] and [[Licinius]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]].]]
Around [[400 BC]], the Celtic [[Insubres]] inhabited Milan and the surrounding region. In [[222 BC]], the Romans conquered this settlement, which imposed the  name [[Mediolanum]], even though the name used by the local people was Mil<U+00E0>n, from the celtic Medhlan.<ref name="InternationalStudent"/> After several centuries of Roman control, Milan was declared the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]] by Emperor [[Diocletian]] in 293 AD. Diocletian chose to stay in the Eastern Roman Empire (capital [[Nicomedia]]) and his colleague Maximianus the Western one. Immediately [[Maximian]] built several gigantic monuments, like a large circus {{convert|470|x|85|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=on}}, the Thermae Erculee, a large complex of imperial palaces and several other services and buildings.
 
In the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, Emperor [[Constantine I]] guaranteed [[freedom of religion]] for [[Christian]]s.<ref name="Edict">{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1990/issue28/2809.html |title=313 The Edict of Milan | Christian History |publisher=www.christianitytoday.com |accessdate=2010-01-14 }}</ref> The city was besieged by the [[Visigoths]] in 402, and the imperial residence was moved to [[Ravenna]]. Fifty years later (in 452), the [[Huns]] overran the city. In 539, the [[Ostrogoths]] conquered and destroyed Milan in the course of the so-called [[Gothic War (535<U+2013>554)|Gothic War]] against [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]]. In the summer of 569, the [[Lombards|Longobards]] (from which the name of the Italian region [[Lombardy]] derives) conquered Milan, overpowering the small [[Byzantine army]] left for its defence. Some Roman structures remained in use in Milan under Lombard rule.<ref>See the ''[[Versum de Mediolano civitate]]''.</ref> Milan surrendered to the [[Franks]] in 774 when [[Charlemagne]], in an utterly novel decision, took the title "King of the Lombards" as well (before then the Germanic kingdoms had frequently conquered each other, but none had adopted the title of King of another people). The [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] dates from this period. Subsequently Milan was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

===Middle Ages===
[[File:IMG 3734 - Milano - Stemma visconteo- sull'Arcivescovado - Foto di Giovanni Dall'Orto - 15-jan-2007.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Biscione]]: the coat of arms of the House of Visconti, from the Archbishops<U+2019> palace in [[Piazza del Duomo, Milan|Piazza Duomo]]. The initals IO<HANNES> stand for archbishop [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop)|Giovanni Visconti]] (1342-1354).]]

During [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], Milan prospered as a centre of trade due to its command of the rich plain of the Po and routes from Italy across the Alps. The war of conquest by [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]] against the Lombard cities brought the destruction of much of Milan in 1162. After the founding of the [[Lombard League]] in 1167, Milan took the leading role in this alliance. As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the [[Peace of Constance]] in 1183, Milan became a duchy. In 1208 [[Rambertino Buvalelli]] served a term as [[podest<U+00E0>]] of the city, in 1242 [[Luca Grimaldi]], and in 1282 [[Luchetto Gattilusio]]. The position could be fraught with personal dangers in the violent political life of the [[medieval commune]]: in 1252 Milanese heretics assassinated the Church's Inquisitor, later known as [[Peter of Verona|Saint Peter Martyr]], at a ford in the nearby ''contado'' [pictured right]; the killers bribed their way to freedom, and in the ensuing riot the ''podest<U+00E0>'' was very nearly lynched. In 1256 the archbishop and leading nobles were expelled from the city. In 1259 [[Martino della Torre]] was elected ''Capitano del Popolo'' by members of the [[guild]]s; he took the city by force, expelled his enemies, and ruled by dictatorial powers, paving streets, digging canals, successfully taxing the countryside.

His policy, however, brought the Milanese treasure to collapse; the use of often reckless mercenary units further angered the population, granting an increasing support for the Della Torre's traditional enemies, the Visconti.

On 22 July 1262 [[Ottone Visconti]] was created [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|archbishop of Milan]] by Pope [[Pope Urban IV|Urban IV]], against the Della Torre candidate, Raimondo della Torre, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Como|Bishop of Como]]. The latter thus started to publicize a allegations of the Visconti's nearness to the heretic [[Catharism|Cathars]] and charged them of high treason: the Visconti, who accused the Della Torre of the same crimes, were then banned from Milan and their properties confiscated. The civil war which ensued caused more damage to Milan's population and economy, lasting for more than a decade.

Ottone Visconti led a group of exiles unsuccessfully against the city in 1263, but after years of escalating violence on all sides, finally, after the victory in the [[Battle of Desio]] (1277), he won the city for his family. The [[House of Visconti|Visconti]] succeeded in ousting the [[della Torre]] forever, ruling the city and its possession until the [[15th century]].

Much of the prior history of Milan was the tale of the struggle between two political factions<U+2014>the Guephs and Ghibellines.  Most of the time the Guelphs were successful in the city of Milan.  However, the Visconti family was were able to seize power (signoria) in Milan, based on their "Ghibelline" friendship with the German Emperors.<ref>Henry S. Lucas, ''The Renaissance and the Reformation'' (Harper & Bros.: New York, 1960) p. 37.</ref>  In 1395, one of these emperors, Wenceslas (1378<U+2013>1400), raised the Milanese to the dignity of a duchy.<ref>''Ibid.'', p. 38.</ref>  Also in 1395, [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] became duke of Milan.  The Ghibelline Visconti family was to retain power in Milan for a century and a half from the early fourteenth century until the middle of the fifteenth century.<ref>Robert S. Hoyt & Stanley Chodorow ''Europe in the Middle Ages'' (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich: New York, 1976) p. 614.</ref>

===The Renaissance and the House of Sforza===

[[File:Milano - Mappa della citt<U+00E0> nel 1621.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Milan in the 17th century]]
In 1447 [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]] was enacted. The Ambrosian Republic took its name from St. Ambrose, popular patron saint of the city of Milan.<ref name="lucas:268">Henry S. Lucas, ''The Renaissance and the Reformation'' p. 268.</ref>  Both the Guelph and the Ghibelline factions worked together to bring  about the Ambrosian Republic in Milan.  However, the Republic collapsed when in 1450, Milan was conquered by [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]], of the [[House of Sforza]], which made Milan one of the leading cities of the Italian [[Renaissance]].<ref name="InternationalStudent"/><ref name="lucas:268"/>

===Periods of French, Spanish and Austrian domination===
[[File:Martin van Meytens 001.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Empress Maria Theresa of Austria|Empress Maria Theresa I of Austria]], the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[Duchy of Milan|duchess of Milan]] from 1740 to 1780.]]
The French king [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] first laid claim to the duchy in 1492. At that time, Milan was defended by [[Swiss mercenaries]]. After the victory of Louis's successor Francis I over the Swiss at the [[Battle of Marignano]], the duchy was promised to the French king [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. When the Habsburg [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] defeated Francis I at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, northern Italy, including Milan, passed to the House of [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]].<ref>John Lothrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' Vol. II (Harper Bros.: New York, 1855) p. 2.</ref>  

In 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]]. Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The [[Italian plague of 1629<U+2013>1631|Great Plague of Milan]] in 1629<U+2013>31 killed an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000. This episode is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long [[pandemic]] of plague which began with the [[Black Death]].<ref>Cipolla, Carlo M. ''Fighting the Plague in Seventeenth Century Italy''.  Madison:  University of Wisconsin Press, 1981.</ref>

In 1700 the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]. After his death, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began in 1701 with the occupation of all Spanish possessions by French troops backing the claim of the French [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]] to the Spanish throne. In 1706, the French were defeated in [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] and [[Battle of Turin|Turin]] and were forced to yield northern Italy to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]]. In 1713, the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Spain's Italian possessions including [[Lombardy]] and its capital, Milan.

===19th century===
[[File:Episodio delle cinque giornate (Baldassare Verazzi).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Milanese]] [[patriotism|patriot]]s fight [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] troops during the [[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]].]]
[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] conquered Lombardy in 1796, and Milan was declared capital of the [[Cisalpine Republic]]. Later, he declared Milan capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and was crowned in the Duomo. Once Napoleon's occupation ended, the [[Congress of Vienna]] returned Lombardy, and Milan, along with [[Veneto]], to Austrian control in 1815.<ref>{{cite web  | last= Bloy| first = Marjie| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = The Congress of Vienna, 1 November 1814 <U+2014> 8 June 1815| work =| publisher = The Victorian Web| date = 30 April 2002| url = http://www.victorianweb.org/history/forpol/vienna.html| doi =| accessdate = 2009-06-09}}</ref> During this period, Milan became a centre of lyric [[opera]]. Here in the 1770s [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] had premiered three operas at the [[Teatro Regio Ducal]]. Later [[La Scala]] became the reference theatre in the world, with its premi<U+00E8>res of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and Verdi. [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] himself is interred in the "Casa di Riposo per Musicisti", his present to Milan. In the 19th century other important theatres were ''La Cannobiana'' and the ''Teatro Carcano''.
[[File:Pozzi, Pompeo (1817-1880) - Milano - Stazione Centrale, dopo 1864.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Milan's central station as it was around 1864.]]
On March 18, 1848, the Milanese rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called "[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]" ([[Italian language|Italian:]] ''Le Cinque Giornate''), and Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] was forced to withdraw from the city temporarily. However, after defeating Italian forces at [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Custoza]] on July 24, Radetzky was able to reassert Austrian control over Milan and northern Italy. However, Italian nationalists, championed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], called for the removal of Austria in the interest of [[Italian unification]]. Sardinia and France formed an alliance and defeated Austria at the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859.<ref name="Solferino">{{cite web | title = Solferino |author=Graham J. Morris | url = http://www.battlefieldanomalies.com/solferino/08_the_battle.htm |accessdate= 2009-06-09 }}</ref> Following this battle, Milan and the rest of Lombardy were incorporated into the Kingdom of Sardinia, which soon gained control of most of Italy and in 1861 was rechristened as the [[Kingdom of Italy]].

The [[Italian unification|political unification of Italy]] cemented Milan's commercial dominance over northern Italy. It also led to a flurry of railway construction that made Milan the rail hub of northern Italy. Rapid industrialization put Milan at the centre of Italy's leading industrial region, though in the 1890s Milan was shaken by the [[Bava-Beccaris massacre]], a riot related to a high [[inflation rate]]. Meanwhile, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading [[financial centre]]. Milan's [[economic growth]] brought a rapid expansion in the city's area and population during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref name="World"/>

===20th century===

[[File:Milano TouringClubItaliano 1914.jpg|thumb|right|A map of the city of Milan in 1914.]]
In 1919, [[Benito Mussolini]] organized the [[Blackshirts]], who formed the core of [[Italian Fascism|Italy's Fascist movement]], in Milan and, in 1922, the [[March on Rome]] began from the city. 

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] Milan suffered severe damage from British and American bombing. Even though [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italy quit the war]] in 1943, the Germans occupied most of [[Northern Italy]] until 1945. Some of the worst [[Allies|Allied]] bombing of Milan was in 1944 and much of them focused around [[Milano Centrale railway station|Milan's main railway station]]. In 1943, anti-German resistance in occupied Italy increased and there was much fighting in Milan.

As the war came to an end, the American [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] advanced on Milan as part of the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Po Valley Campaign]].  But even before they arrived, members of the [[Italian resistance movement]] rose up in open revolt in Milan and liberated the city.  Nearby, Mussolini and several members of his [[Italian Social Republic]] (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana'', or RSI) were captured by the resistance at [[Dongo (CO)|Dongo]] and executed. On 29 April 1945, the bodies of the Fascists were taken to Milan and hanged unceremoniously upside-down at Piazzale Loreto, a major public square.

After the war the city was the [[Milan (camp)|site of a refugee camp]] for Jews fleeing from Austria. During the [[Italian economic miracle|economic miracle]] of the 1950s and 1960s a large wave of internal immigration, especially from [[Southern Italy]], moved to Milan and the population peaked at 1,723,000 in 1971. During this period, Milan saw a re-construction of most of its destroyed buildings and factories, and was affected by a rapid post-war economic growth, called ''Il boom'' in Italy. The city saw the construction of several innovative and modernist buildings and skyscrapers, such as the Torre Velasca and the Pirelli Tower. Milan was, however, in the late-1960s until the late-1970s seriously affected by the Marxist/Leninist/Communist Italian group called ''[[Brigate Rosse]]'', or ''Red Brigades'', and the city was often filled with political manifestations and protests. As a matter of fact, on December 12, 1969, a [[Piazza Fontana bombing|bomb exploded in the National Agrarian Bank in the Piazza Fontana]], killing seventeen and injuring eighty-eight people.

The population of Milan begun to shrink during the late 1970s, so in the last 30 years almost one third of the total city population moved to the outer belt of new suburbs and small cities that grew around Milan proper.<ref name="ISTAT">{{cite web |url=http://demo.istat.it/unitav/index.html?lingua=eng |title=Italian Population Life Tables by province and region of residence |publisher=demo.istat.it |accessdate=2010-01-14 }}</ref> At the same time the city become to attract also increasing fluxes of foreign immigration. Emblematic of the new phenomenon is the quick and great extension of a "[[Milan Chinatown|Milanese Chinatown]]", a district in the area around [[Via Paolo Sarpi]], Via Bramante, Via Messina and Via Rosmini, populated by [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese immigrants]] from [[Zhejiang]], one of today's most picturesque districts in the city. Milan is also home to one-third of all [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] in Italy, harbouring a sizeable and steadily growing population that numbers just over 33,000<ref>{{cite web  | last=| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Backgrounder: Profile of Filipinos in Northern Italy| work =| publisher = Republic of the Philippines Office of the Press Secretary| month = February | year = 2009| url = http://www.ops.gov.ph/feb-visits2009/backgrounder.htm#Northern%20Italy| format =| doi =| accessdate = 2009-06-21}}</ref> with a birth rate averaging 1000 births a year.<ref>{{cite web  | last= Uy| first = Veronica| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Filipinos populating Milan, as 3 are born there daily--exec| work =| publisher = INQUIRER.net| date = 29 April 2008| url = http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20080429-133398/Filipinos-populating-Milan-as-3-are-born-there-daily--exec| format =| doi =| accessdate = 2009-06-21}}</ref>

In the 1980s, Milan's industry began to be extremely successful. As it became a major exporter of textiles and several clothing labels headquartered in the city began to become internationally renowned (such as Armani, Versace and Dolce & Gabbana), Milan began to be recognized internationally as a major fashion capital, and the traditionally affordable and practical, yet stylish and chic attire produced by the city's stylists made it a serious global competitor, threatening Paris' century-long status as the world capital ''haute couture'' or high-fashion. The city also saw a rise in the number of internation tourists, notably from China, Japan or other Far-Eastern countries. This period of prosperity and the new international image of the city being a "capital of fashion" led many journalists to call the metropolis during the period ''"Milano da bere"'', literally "Milan to drink".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/cultura/200804articoli/31497girata.asp |title=L'uomo che invent<U+00F2> la Milano da bere |publisher=Lastampa.It |date=2008-01-04 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> 

In the 1990s, Milan was badly affected by [[Tangentopoli]], a serious political scandal centered in the Palazzo delle Stelline complex, in which several politicians and businessmen were tried for alleged corruption. The city also underwent a financial crisis, and faced sluggish industrial growth, compared to that of the 1950s and 1980s. Despite this, Milan ripened its image as a fashion and design capital, with new labels such as [[Miu Miu]] setting up. By the late-1990s, Milan regained some slight industrial and economic stimulus to grow.      

By the early 2000s, Milan's economy which had been stagnant in the early-1990s began to re-grow slightly again, yet this was short-lived and the city, despite having relieved itself from Tangentopoli's strain, fell into another economic recession and crisis. This period saw a rapid fall in Milan's industrial exports, and the Asian textile and clothing companies began to rival the still strong, yet declining Milanese fashion labels. However, Milan was able to maintain its strong economy, firstly by moving its Fiera (an exposition of products related to mainly industrial design) to a new establishment in [[Rho (Italy)|Rho]] just outside the city,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.storiadimilano.it/cron/dal1991al2000.htm |title=Storia di Milano ::: dal 1991 al 2000 |publisher=Storiadimilano.it |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> and the announcement in 2008 of the city hosting the [[Expo 2015]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.storiadimilano.it/cron/dal2001.htm |title=Storia di Milano ::: dal 2001 |publisher=Storiadimilano.it |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> has brightened prospects for the city's future, with several new plans of regeneration and the planned construction of numerous avant-garde structures.

==Municipal Administration==
[[File:Quartieri.png|thumb|right|The nine districts of Milan]]
===Politics===
{{See also|Mayors of Milan}}
*Name of the Mayor: [[Letizia Moratti]]
*Date of election: May 30, 2006
*Party: [[The People of Freedom]]

Of nine boroughs into which Milan is divided, eight are governed by [[centre-right]] coalition (1-8) and one by [[centre-left]] coalition (9).

===Administrative divisions===
The city of Milan is subdivided into administrative zones, called ''Zona''. Before 1999, the city had 21 ''Zone''; in 1999 the administration decided to reduce the number of these zones from 21 to 9. Today, the ''Zona 1'' is in the "historic centre", the zone within the perimeter of the Spanish-era city walls; the other eight cover the areas from the Zona 1 borders to the city limits.<ref>[http://www.comune.milano.it/dseserver/WebCity/Documenti.nsf/a05ac22aa8296639012567b6005b1193/24ebbbc42dccc2a0c1256d570040abac?OpenDocument web site of Milan]{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}</ref>

==Geography==
===Topography===
The district of Milan is located in the [[Po Valley|Padan Plain]] in the west-central area, inclusive among the rivers [[Ticino]] and [[Adda (river)|Adda]], among the river [[Po (river)|Po]] and the first reliefs of the [[Alps]].  It has a surface area of 181&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and is 122 metres [[above mean sea level|above sea level]].

===Climate===
Milan experiences a [[Humid subtropical climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'')<ref>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/World_Koppen_Map.png</ref> with some [[continental climate|continental]] characteristics. This is typical of Northern Italy's inland plains, where hot, humid summers and cold, damp winters prevail, unlike the [[Mediterranean climate]] characteristic of the rest of Italy.<ref name="NatGeo">{{cite web |url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/cities/city_milan.html |title=Milan, Italy facts, Milan, Italy travel videos, flags, photos - National Geographic |publisher=travel.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=2010-01-04 }}</ref> 

Average temperatures in city center are {{convert|-3|to|4|<U+00B0>C|0|abbr=on}} in January and {{convert|19|to|30|<U+00B0>C|0|abbr=on}} in July. Snowfalls are relatively common during winter, even if in the last 15<U+2013>20&nbsp;years they have decreased in frequency . The historic average of Milan's area is between 35 and 45&nbsp;cm (16"/18"); single snowfalls over 30<U+2013>50&nbsp;cm in 1<U+2013>3&nbsp;days happen periodically, with a record of 80<U+2013>100&nbsp;cm during the famous snowfall of January 1985. Humidity is quite high during the whole year and annual precipitation averages about 1000&nbsp;mm (40&nbsp;in).<ref name="NatGeo"/> In the stereotypical image, the city is often shrouded in the fog characteristic of the Po Basin, although the removal of rice fields from the southern neighbourhoods, the [[urban heat island]] effect and the reduction of pollution levels have reduced this phenomenon in recent years, at least in the city centre.

There are few remains of the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colony that later became a capital of the Western Roman Empire. During the second half of the [[4th century|4th century CE]], [[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]], as bishop of Milan, had a strong influence on the layout of the city, redesigning the centre (although the cathedral and baptistery built at this time are now lost) and building the great basilicas at the city gates: [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio|Sant'Ambrogio]], [[San Nazaro in Brolos]], [[Basilica of San Simpliciano|San Simpliciano]] and [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio|Sant'Eustorgio]], which still stand, refurbished over the centuries, as some of the finest and most important churches in Milan.

During the rule of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]], between the 14th and 15th centuries,  the old Visconti fortress was enlarged and embellished to became the [[Castello Sforzesco]]: the seat of an elegant Renaissance court surrounded by a walled hunting park stocked with game captured around the [[Seprio]] and [[Lake Como]]. Notable architects involved in the project included the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Filarete]], who was commissioned to build the high central entrance tower, and the military specialist [[Bartolomeo Gadio]].<ref>[http://www.milanocastello.it/ing/lungaRicostruito.html <U+2018>The Castle Reconstructed by the Sforza<U+2019>], Castello Sforzesco website.</ref> The political alliance between Francesco Sforza and the Florence of [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo de<U+2019> Medici]] bore architectural fruit, as Milanese building came under the influence of [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]an models of Renaissance architecture. The first notable buildings to show this Tuscan influence were a palazzo built to house the [[Medici Bank]] (of which only the main entrance survives) and the centrally planned [[Portinari Chapel]], attached to San Lorenzo and built for the first manager of the bank<U+2019>s Milan branch. Filarete, while in Milan, was responsible for the great public hospital known as the [[Ospedale Maggiore]], and also for an influential ''Treatise on Architecture'', which included a plan for a star-shaped [[ideal city]] called Sforzinda in honour of [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]] and passionately argued for the centrally planned form. [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who was in Milan from around  1482 until the fall of the city to the French in 1499, was commissioned in 1487 to design a ''tiburio'', or [[crossing (architecture)|crossing tower]] for the cathedral, although he was not chosen to build it.<ref>[http://www.universalleonardo.org/lifeevent.php?event=275 <U+2018>First Milanese period 1481/2 - 1499 (1487)<U+2019>], Universal Leonardo.</ref><ref>[http://www.universalleonardo.org/lifeevent.php?event=276 <U+2018>First Milanese period 1481/2 - 1499 (1488)<U+2019>], Universal Leonardo.</ref> However the enthusiasm he shared with Filarete for the centrally planned building gave rise in this period to numerous architectural drawings [pictured] which were influential in the work of [[Donato Bramante]] and others. Bramante<U+2019>s work in the city, which included [[Santa Maria presso San Satiro]] (a reconstruction of a small ninth-century church), the beautiful luminous tribune of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] and three cloisters for Sant<U+2019>Ambrogio, drew also on his studies of the Early Christian architecture of Milan such as the Basilica of San Lorenzo.<ref name="murray">{{cite book | first= Peter|last= Murray| year=1986| title= The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance| chapter=Milan: Filarete, Leonardo Bramante| editor= | others= | pages=105<U+2013>120 | publisher= Thames and Hudson| id= | url= | authorlink= }}</ref>

The [[Counter-Reformation]] was also the period of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish domination]] and was marked by two powerful figures: [[Charles Borromeo|Saint Charles Borromeo]] and his cousin, [[Federico Borromeo|Cardinal Federico Borromeo]]. Not only did they impose themselves  as moral guides to the people of Milan, but they also gave a great impulse to culture, with the creation of the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]], in a building designed by [[Francesco Maria Richini|Francesco Maria Ricchino]], and the nearby [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]]. Many beautiful churches and Baroque mansions were built in the city during this period by the architects, [[Pellegrino Tibaldi]], [[Galeazzo Alessi]] and Ricchino himself.<ref name="Wittkower">{{cite book | first= Rudolf|last= Wittkower| year=1993| title= Pelican History of Art| chapter= Art and Architecture Italy, 1600-1750| editor= | others=1980 | pages= | publisher= Penguin Books| id= | url= | authorlink= }}</ref>

Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] was responsible for the significant renovations carried out in Milan during the 18th century. She instigated profound social and civil reforms, as well as the construction of many of the buildings that still today constitute the pride of the city, like the [[La Scala|Teatro alla Scala]], inaugurated on 3 August 1778 and today one of the world's most famous [[opera house]]s. The annexed [[Museo Teatrale alla Scala]] contains a collection of paintings, drafts, statues, costumes, and other documents regarding opera and La Scala's history. La Scala also hosts the [[La Scala Theatre Ballet School|Ballet School of the Teatro alla Scala]]. The Austrian sovereign also promoted culture in Milan through projects such as converting the ancient [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] College, in the district of Brera, into a scientific and cultural centre with a Library, an astronomic observatory and the [[botanical garden]]s, in which the [[Pinacoteca di Brera|Art Gallery]] and the [[Brera Academy|Academy of Fine Arts]] are today placed side by side.

Milan was also widely affected by the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] movement in the late-18th and early-19th centuries, transforming its architectural style. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s rule of the city in the early 1800s produced several fine Neoclassical edifices and palaces, including the Villa Reale, or often called the Villa del Belgiojoso (not related to the Palazzo Begiojoso). It is situated on Via Palestro and near to the Giardini Pubblici and it was constructed by [[Leopoldo Pollak]] in 1790.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmilan.com/monuments-in-Milan.html |title=Monuments in Milan |publisher=Aboutmilan.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-14}}</ref> It housed the Bonaparte family, mainly [[Josephine Bonaparte]], but also several others, such as Count [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]] and [[Eug<U+00E8>ne de Beauharnais]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> It is often regarded as one of the best types of [[Neoclassical architecture]] in Milan and Lombardy and is surrounded by an [[English landscape garden]]. Today, it hosts the Galleria d'Arte Contemporanea (English: ''Gallery of Contemporary Art'') and it is lavishly decorated inside with ornate classical columns, vast halls, marble statues and crystal chandeliers.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The Palazzo Belgiojoso was also a grand Napoleonic residence and one of the finest examples of Milanese Neoclassical architecture. There are also several other important Neoclassical monuments in the city include the ''Arco della Pace'' or the Arch of Peace, sometimes called the ''Arco Sempione'' (Sempione Arch) and is situated in Piazza Sempione right at the end of the Parco Sempione. It is often compared to a miniature version of the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris. The work on the arch began in 1806 under Napoleon I and it was designed by [[Luigi Cagnola]]. Just like with the Arc de Triomphe, Napoleon's 1826 defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], halted the construction of the monumental arch, but [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Josef (Francis Joseph) I of Austria]] ordered it to be completed, also as an honour to the [[Vienna Congress]] and peace treaty of 1815. It was completed by [[Francesco Peverelli]] on 10 September 1838.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Another noted Neoclassic building in the city is the Palazzo del Governo, constructed in 1817 by [[Piero Gilardoni]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> 
[[File:Milano Guastalla Velasca.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Torre Velasca]], a symbol of 1950s Milan, built by [[BBPR]].]]
In the second half of the 19th century, Milan assumed the status of main industrial city of the [[Italian Peninsula|peninsula]] and drew inspiration to the urbanization from other European capitals, center of those technological innovations that constituted the symbol of the [[Second Industrial Revolution|second industrial revolution]] and, consequently, of the great [[social change]] that had been put in motion. The great [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], a covered passage that connects [[Piazza del Duomo, Milan]] to the square opposite of [[La Scala]], was built by [[Giuseppe Mengoni]] between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele II]], the first king of united Italy. The passage is covered over by an arching [[glass]] and [[cast iron]] roof, a popular design for 19th-century arcades, such as the [[Burlington Arcade]], [[London]], which was the prototype for larger glazed shopping arcades, beginning with the [[Royal Galleries of Saint-Hubert|Saint-Hubert Gallery]] in [[Brussels]] and the [[The Passage|Passazh]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]]. Another late-19th century eclectic monument in the city is the Cimitero Monumentale (literally, "''Monumental Cemetary'' or ''graveyard''"), which is found in the Stazione district of the city and was built in a [[Neo-Romanesque]] style by several architects from 1863 to 1866.

The tumultuous period of the 20th century also brought several innovations in architecture. A form of [[Art Nouveau]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Fascist architecture|Fascist]] style is seen for the monumental [[Stazione Centrale di Milano|city's Central Station (Stazione Centrale)]]. The post-World War II period of reconstruction saw rapid economic growth that was accompanied by an increase in the population and the founding of new districts, but also for the strong drive for architectural renewal, has produced some of the milestones in the city<U+2019>s [[history of architecture|architectural history]] including [[Gi<U+00F2> Ponti|Gio Ponti]]<U+2019>s [[Pirelli Tower]] (1955<U+2013>59), the [[Torre Velasca|Velasca Tower]] (1958), the creation of new residential districts and, in recent years, the construction of the new [[FieraMilano|exhibition centre]] in [[Rho (Italy)|Rho]] and the urban renewal of once industrial areas, that have been transformed into modern residential districts and services, like the [[CityLife (Milan)|City Life]] business and residential center.

Milan also contains three important botanical gardens: the [[Orto Botanico Didattico Sperimentale dell'Universit<U+00E0> di Milano]] (a small botanical garden operated by the Istituto di Scienze Botaniche), the [[Orto Botanico di Brera]] (another botanical garden, founded in 1774 by Fulgenzio Witman, an abbot under the orders of [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Empress Maria Theresa of Austria]], and restored in 1998 after several years of abandonment) and the [[Orto Botanico di Cascina Rosa]].

On January 23, 2003 a [[Righteous among the Nations|Garden of the Righteous]] was established in Monte Stella to commemorate those who opposed genocides and crimes against humankind. It hosts trees dedicated to [[Moshe Bejski]], [[Andrei Sakharov]], the founders of the Gardens of the Righteous in [[Yerevan]] and [[Sarajevo]] [[Svetlana Broz]] and [[Pietro Kuciukian]], and others. The decision to commemorate a "Righteous" person in this Garden is made every year by a commission of high-profile characters.

The city proper has a population of 1,301,394 inhabitants as of April 2009. Since the population peak of 1971, the city proper has lost almost one third of its population, mostly due to [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]] subsequent to the [[deindustrialization]] process of the last three decades.  The [[urban area]] of Milan, largely coinciding with its administrative [[Provinces of Italy|province]], is the fifth largest in the E.U. with an estimated population of 4.3 million. The growth of many suburbs and satellite settlements around the city proper since the great economic boom of the 1950-60s have defined the extent and pattern of the metropolitan area, and commuting flows suggest that socioeconomic linkages have expanded well beyond the boundaries of the city and its province, creating a metropolitan area of 7.4 million population expanded all over the central section of [[Lombardy]] region.<ref>[http://www.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/get-it.asp?REF=0406051E.PDF&TYPE=browse OECD Territorial Review - Milan, Italy]</ref><ref>[http://urbact.eu/fileadmin/subsites/Metrogov/pdf/Milan_s2.pdf Competitiveness of Milan and its metropolitan area]</ref> It has been suggested that the Milan metropolitan area is part of the so-called ''[[Blue Banana]]'', the area of Europe with the highest population and industrial density.<ref name="Gert">{{cite web | author=Gert-Jan Hospers| year=2002| title=Beyond the Blue Banana?

===Immigration===
{{Seealso|Milan Chinatown}}
Since the end of World War II, Milan has been host to two waves of mass immigration, the first from within [[Italy]], the second from outside the peninsula. These two immigrations have corresponded with two different economic phases. The first immigration coincided with the economic miracle of 1950s and 1960s, a period of extraordinary growth based around classic industry and public works. The second immigration has taken place against the background of a vastly different economy, centered around services, small industry and post-industrial scenarios. The first concerned Italians, from the countryside, the mountains and the cities of the [[Southern Italy|South]], the [[Northeast Italy|East]] or the other provinces of [[Lombardy]]. The second concerns non-Italians, from a myriad of countries but above all from [[North Africa]], [[Sub-saharan Africa]], [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[Caribbean]], [[South America]], [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], and [[Eastern Europe]]. By the end of the 1990s Milan had a 10 per cent foreign immigrant population, the vast majority of whom worked in the low-level service sector (restaurant workers, cleaners, maids, domestic workers) or in factories.<ref name=unpop>{{cite paper | url=http://www.feem.it/NR/Feem/resources/EURODIVPapers/ED2006-025.pdf| title=WMapping Diversity in Milan.

Milan is particularly well-known, also, for its Chinese community in the Via Paolo Sarpi, often called the "Milan Chinatown", which was established in the 1930s, and is the oldest, most significant and biggest Chinese area in Italy.

Milan is one of the world's major financial and business centres, and with a 2004 GDP of <U+20AC> 241.2 billion (US$ 312.3 billion),<ref>[[List of metropolitan areas in the European Union by GDP|List of metropolitan areas in the European Union by GRP]]</ref> the Milan metropolitan area has the 4th highest GDPs in Europe: were it a country, it would rank as the twenty-eighth largest economy in the world, almost as large as the Austrian economy<ref>[[List of countries by GDP (nominal)]]</ref>

It is also the site of the old Milan Stock Exchange.]]

The city is the seat of the Italian [[Stock exchange|Stock Exchange]] (the [[Borsa Italiana]]) and its [[hinterland]] is the largest industrial area in Italy. It was included in a list of ten "[[global city|Alpha world cities]]" by Peter J. Taylor and Robert E. Lang of the [[Brookings Institution]] in the economic report "U.S. Cities in the 'World City Network'" ([http://www.brookings.edu/metro/pubs/20050222_worldcities.htm Key Findings], {{PDFlink|[http://www.brookings.edu/dybdocroot/metro/pubs/20050222_worldcities.pdf Full Report]|940&nbsp;KB}}), along with [[Madrid]], [[Seoul]], [[Moscow]], [[Brussels]], [[Toronto]], [[Mumbai]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]]. 

In the late [[12th century]] the arts flourished and the making of [[armour]]s was the most important industry. This period saw the beginning of those irrigation works which still render the Lombard plain a fertile garden. The development of the [[wool|wool trade]] subsequently gave the first impetus to the production of silk.

As in [[Venice]] and [[Florence]], the making of [[luxury good]]s was an industry of such importance that in the 16th century the city gave its name to the English word <U+201C>''milaner''<U+201D> or <U+201C>''millaner''<U+201D>, meaning fine wares like jewellery, cloth, hats and luxury apparel. By the 19th century, a later variant, <U+201C>[[millinery]]<U+201D>, had come to mean one who made or sold hats.

The [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] in [[Northern Europe]] gave a new prominence to the north area of Milan. It sat on the [[trade route]] for goods coming over the Alps, and built mills powered by water from the many rivers and streams.

In the mid-19th century cheaper silk began to be imported from Asia and the pest phylloxera damaged silk and wine production. More land was subsequently given over to industrialisation. Textile production was followed by metal and mechanical and furniture manufacture.

Today Milan is a major centre for the production of textile and garments, automobiles ([[Alfa Romeo]]) , chemicals, industrial tools, heavy machinery, book and music publishing.

[[FieraMilano]], the exhibition center, had a [[Fair Ground|fair ground]] known as "''FieraMilanoCity''", which was dismantled, except for a few remarkable buildings (including the cycle sports stadium, built in the '20s), to be house for an [[urban planning|urban development]], [[CityLife (Milan)|CityLife]], exploiting its vicinity to the city centre. The new fair ground, in the north-western suburb of [[Rho (Italy)|Rho]], which was opened in April 2005, makes the Fiera Milano the largest trade fair complex in the world.

===Milan and the future===
[[File:Expo2015Milan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Expo 2015]] logo]]
Milan is undergoing an urban re-design. Construction projects are under way to rehabilitate disused industrial areas on the periphery. The schemes include the addition to the [[La Scala|Teatro alla Scala]]; the CityLife project in the old "fiera" site; the new quarter Santa Giulia; and  the Porta Nuova project in the Garibaldi-Repubblica zone. Many famous architects participate, such as [[Renzo Piano]], [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Massimiliano Fuksas]] and [[Daniel Libeskind]]. The tasks will change the skyline of Milan, which would no longer be dominated by the [[Milan Cathedral|Duomo]] and the [[Pirelli Tower]].

Milan will host [[Expo 2015]] as a renewed city in the wake of this modernization.

===International status===
According to the Global City Power Index, Milan was ranked in 2008 as the 27th most powerful city in the world, and 28th in 2009 with a score of 203.5, coming after [[Beijing]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]] and surpassing [[Bangkok]], [[Fukuoka]], [[Taipei]] and [[Moscow]].<ref name="mori-m-foundation.or.jp"/> In the different sectors of the study, Milan arrived worldwide 29th in economics, 30th in R&D, 18th in cultural activities, 18th in livability, 27th in environmental issues, and 15th in accessibility.<ref name="mori-m-foundation.or.jp"/>

Milan was major artistic centre thorughout the centuries. Numerous art institutes, academies and galleries (such as the [[Brera Academy]] and the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]]) exist in the city.

Milan's art flourished in the [[Middle Ages|Middle-Ages]], and with the [[Visconti]] family being major patrons of the arts, the city became an important centre of [[Gothic art]] and architecture ([[Milan Cathedral]] being the city's most formidable work of Gothic architecture).<ref name="aboutmilan.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmilan.com/art-and-culture-of-milan.html |title=Art and Culture of Milan: from the past to the contemporary |publisher=Aboutmilan.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref> Also, rule of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]], between the 14th and [[15th century]], was another period in which art and architecture flourished. The [[Castello Sforzesco|Sforza Castle]] became the seat of an elegant Renaissance court,<ref name="Castello Sforzesco">[http://www.milanocastello.it/intro.html Castello Sforzesco]</ref> while great works, such as the [[Ospedale Maggiore]], the public hospital designed by [[Filarete]] were built, and artists of the calibre of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] came to work in Milan, leaving works of inestimable value, such as the fresco of the [[Last Supper]] and the [[Codex Atlanticus]]. [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]] also came to Milan to work on the construction of some of the most beautiful churches in the city; in [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] the beautiful luminous tribune is by Bramante, as is the church of [[Santa Maria presso San Satiro]].

The city was affected by the [[Baroque]] in the 17th and 18th centuries, and hosted numerous formidable artists, architects and painters of that period, such as [[Caravaggio]]. Caravaggio's Baroque masterpiece "''[[Basket of Fruit (Caravaggio)|Basket of Fruit]]''", is held in Milan's [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]] and his "''[[Supper at Emmaus (Caravaggio), Milan|Supper at Emmaus]]''" is held in the [[Brera Academy]].<ref name="aboutmilan.com"/> Milan became a major European artistic centre during the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], when Milanese Romantic was influenced by the [[Austria]]ns, who ruled Milan at the time. Probably the most notable of all Romantic works of art held in Milan is "''[[The Kiss (Hayez painting)|The Kiss]]''", by [[Francesco Hayez]], which is held in the [[Brera Academy]].<ref name="aboutmilan.com"/> 

Milan and the whole of Italy, was later, in the 20th century, influenced by [[Futurism]]. [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Filippo Marinetti]], the founder of Italian Futurism wrote in his 1909 "''[[Futurist Manifesto]]''" (in Italian, ''Manifesto Futuristico''), that Milan was "''grande...tradizionale e futurista''" ("''grand...traditional and futuristic''", in English).

In the 1950s and 60s, being the main industrial centre of [[Italy]] and one of mainland Europe's most progressive and dynamic cities, Milan became, along with [[Turin]], Italy's capital of post-war design and architecture. Skyscrapers, such as the [[Pirelli Tower]] and the [[Torre Velasca]] were constructed, and architects such as [[Bruno Munari]], [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Enrico Castellani]] and [[Piero Manzoni]], to name a few, either lived or worked in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/milan_turin |title=Frieze Magazine &#124; Archive &#124; Milan and Turin |publisher=Frieze.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref>

===Literature===
{{Main|Milanese literature}}
[[File:Francesco Hayez 040.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Alessandro Manzoni]].]]
In the late 18th century, and throughout the 19th, Milan was an important centre for intellectual discussion and literary creativity. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found here a fertile ground. [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]], with his famous ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'', and Count [[Pietro Verri]], with the periodical ''Il Caff<U+00E8>'' were able to exert a considerable influence over the new [[middle class|middle-class]] culture, thanks also to an open-minded Austrian administration. In the first years of the nineteenth century, the ideals of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus [[Romantic poetry]]. Here, too, [[Giuseppe Parini]], and [[Ugo Foscolo]] published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship. Foscolo's poem ''[[Dei sepolcri]]'' was inspired by a Napoleonic law which<U+2014>against the will of many of its inhabitants<U+2014>was being extended to the city.

In the third decade of the 19th century, [[Alessandro Manzoni]] wrote his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'', considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre. The periodical ''[[Il Conciliatore]]'' published articles by [[Silvio Pellico]], [[Giovanni Berchet]], [[Ludovico di Breme]], who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics.

After the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] in 1861, Milan lost its political importance; nevertheless it retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] gave birth to an Italian movement, ''[[Verismo]]''. The greatest ''verista'' novelist, [[Giovanni Verga]], was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.

{{See also|Milanese grammar|Classical Milanese orthography}}
In addition to [[Italian language|Italian]], approximately a third of the population of western [[Lombardy]] can speak the [[Western dialects of Lombard language|Western Lombard language]], also known as Insubric.

Milan's population, like that of Italy as a whole, is overwhelmingly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].

Other religions practised include: [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Churches]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.it/maps?hl=it&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=chiesa+ortodossa+milano&fb=1&view=text&sa=X&oi=local_group&resnum=1&ct=more-results&cd=1 |title=chiesa ortodossa milano - Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.it |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> [[Buddhism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lankaramaya.com/ |title=Lankarama Buddhist Temple - Milan,Italy |publisher=Lankaramaya.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> [[Judaism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mosaico-cem.it/ |title=Jewish Community of Milan |publisher=Mosaico-cem.it |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> [[Islam]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxeurope.org/page/8/4.aspx |title=Islam in Italy <U+00BB> Inter-Religious Dialogue <U+00BB> OrthodoxEurope.org |publisher=OrthodoxEurope.org<! |date=2002-12-04 |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=7230 |title=Milan: The Center for Radical Islam in Europe |publisher=American Chronicle |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> and [[Protestantism]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Cini |url=http://www.protestantiamilano.it/ |title=Centro Culturale Protestante - Protestanti a Milano delle Chiese Battiste Metodiste Valdesi |language={{It icon}} |publisher=Protestantiamilano.it |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milanovaldese.it/ |title=Chiesa Evangelica Valdese - Milano |publisher=Milanovaldese.it |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>

Milan has its own historic Catholic rite known as the [[Ambrosian Rite]] (Italian: ''Rito ambrosiano''). It varies slightly from the typical Catholic rite (the ''Roman'', used in all other western regions), with some differences in the [[liturgy]] and mass celebrations, and in the calendar (for example, the date for the beginning of [[lent]] is celebrated some days after the common date, so the carnival has different date). The Ambrosian rite is also practised in other surrounding locations in [[Lombardy]] and in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Ticino]].

Another important difference concerns the [[liturgical music]]. The [[Gregorian chant]] was completely unused in Milan and surrounding areas, because the official one was its own [[Ambrosian chant]], definitively established by the [[Council of Trent]] (1545<U+2013>1563) and earlier than the Gregorian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01389a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Ambrosian Chant |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> To preserve this music there has developed the unique ''schola cantorum'', a college, and an Institute in partnership with the "Pontifical Ambrosian Institute of Sacred Music" (PIAMS) in Rome [http://www.unipiams.org/en/1].

===Cinema===
Several (especially Italian) films have been set in Milan, including ''"[[Calmi Cuori Appassionati]]"''', ''"[[The International (film)]]"'', ''"[[La mala ordina]]"'', "''[[Milano calibro 9]]''", "''[[Miracle in Milan]]"'', ''"[[La notte]]''", and "''[[Rocco and His Brothers]]''". 

===Cuisine===
[[File:Panettone aufgeschnitten freigestellt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Panettone]], Milanese traditional Christmas cake]]
Like most cities in Italy, Milan and its surrounding area has its own regional cuisine, which, as it is typical for Lombard cuisines, uses more frequently [[rice]] than [[pasta]], and features almost no [[tomato]].

After [[Bologna]], Milan is the second railway hub of Italy, and the five major stations of Milan, amongst which the [[Milano Centrale railway station|Milan Central station]], are among Italy's busiest. The first railroad built in Milan, the [[Milan<U+2013>Monza railway|Milan and Monza Rail Road]] was opened for service on August 17, 1840.

Since December 13, 2009 two [[High-speed rail|High speed train]] lines link Milan to  [[Milan<U+2013>Bologna high-speed railway|Bologna]], [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Naples]] and [[Salerno]] in one direction, and to [[Turin<U+2013>Milan high-speed railway|Turin]] in another. 

The [[Azienda Trasporti Milanesi]] (ATM) operates within the metropolitan area, managing a [[public transport]] network consisting of three metropolitan railway lines and tram, [[trolleybus|trolley-bus]] and [[bus|bus lines]]. The ATM tramway fleet includes several Peter Witt cars, originally built in 1928 and still working. Overall the network covers nearly 1,400&nbsp;km reaching 86 municipalities. Besides public transport, ATM manages the interchange [[parking lot]]s and the on-street parking spaces in the historical centre and in the commercial zones using the SostaMilano parking card system.
