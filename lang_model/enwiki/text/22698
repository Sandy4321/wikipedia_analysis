Ubuntu is a derivative of [[Debian]], another free operating system. Ubuntu is sponsored by [[Canonical Ltd]], which is owned by [[South Africa]]n entrepreneur [[Mark Shuttleworth]]. The name of the distribution comes from the [[Africa]]n concept of ''[[Ubuntu (philosophy)|ubuntu]]'' which may be rendered roughly as "humanity toward others", "we are people because of other people", or "I am who I am because of who we all are", though other meanings have been suggested.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.easy-ubuntu-linux.com/ubuntu-african-word.html | title=Ubuntu's African Roots | accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref> This Linux distribution is named as such to bring the spirit of the philosophy to the software world. Ubuntu is [[free software]] and can be shared by any number of users.

[[Kubuntu]] and [[Xubuntu]] are official subprojects of the Ubuntu project, aiming to bring the [[KDE]] and [[Xfce]] [[desktop environment]]s, respectively, to the Ubuntu core (by default Ubuntu uses [[GNOME]] for its desktop environment). [[Edubuntu]] is an official subproject designed for school environments and should be equally suitable for children to use at home.<ref>{{cite web |title=Edubuntu - Frequently asked questions |url=http://www.edubuntu.org/faq |accessdate=2006-07-15}}</ref> [[Gobuntu]] is an official subproject that is aimed at adhering strictly to the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s [[Free software#Definition|Four Freedoms]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Gobuntu - What is Gobuntu |url=http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/gobuntu |accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref> [[Ubuntu JeOS]] (pronounced "Juice") is the newest official subproject.

== History and development process ==

Ubuntu's first release was on [[October 20]], [[2004]], as a temporary [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[Debian]] project.<ref name="history">{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/community/ubuntustory | title=ubuntu/history "The Ubuntu Story" | accessdate = 2001-10-21}}</ref> This was done so that a new version of Ubuntu could be released every six months,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases|title=Time Based Releases|accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> resulting in a more frequently updated system. Ubuntu releases always include the most recent [[GNOME]] release, and are scheduled to be released about a month after GNOME.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases|title=Releases|accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> In contrast with previous general-purpose forks of Debian<U+2014>such as [[MEPIS]], [[Xandros]], [[Linspire]], [[Progeny Componentized Linux|Progeny]] and [[Libranet]], many of which relied on [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and [[closed source software|closed source]] add-ons as part of their business model<U+2014>Ubuntu has stayed closer to Debian's philosophy and uses [[free software|free]] (''[[Gratis versus Libre|libre]]'') software most of the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/philosophy |title=ubuntu/philosophy |accessdate = 2006-04-25}}</ref>

The Ubuntu logo and typography has remained the same since that first release. The hand-drawn,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-23773.html|title=Anyone know what font the Ubuntu Logo uses?|accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> lowercase [[OpenType]] font used is called [[Ubuntu-Title]] and was created by Andy Fitzsimon.<ref name="ubuntutitle">{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuTitle|title=UbuntuTitle|accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> The font is distributed under the terms of the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL) and use with logos derived from the Ubuntu logo is encouraged.<ref name="ubuntutitle" /> The font is available as a package for Ubuntu.<ref name="ubuntutitle" />

Ubuntu packages have generally been based on packages from Debian's [[Debian#Development versions|unstable branch]]: both distributions use Debian's [[deb (file format)|deb]] [[Software package (installation)|package]] format and [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]]/[[Synaptic Package Manager|Synaptic]] to manage installed packages, although Debian and Ubuntu packages are not necessarily [[binary compatible]] with each other.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarkShuttleworth | title=Mark Shuttleworth on binary compatibility | accessdate = 2006-04-25}}</ref> Ubuntu cooperates with Debian<U+2014>to some extent pushing changes back to Debian,<ref name="history">{{cite web | url=https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-website/+bug/154274 | title=ubuntu/relationship "Website does not reference Debian visibly" | accessdate = 2007-10-21}}</ref> although there has been criticism concerning lack of occurrence.<ref name="forking">{{cite web | url=http://ianmurdock.com/?p=167 | title=Ubuntu vs. Debian, reprise | accessdate = 2007-10-21 | date=2005-04-20}}</ref> Many Ubuntu developers are also maintainers of key packages within Debian. However, [[Ian Murdock]], the founder of Debian, criticized Ubuntu packages for incompatibilities with Debian, saying Ubuntu had diverged too far from [[Debian Sarge]] to remain compatible.<ref name="forking" />

There are plans for a branch codenamed Grumpy Groundhog. The development will be a permanently unstable development and testing branch, pulling the source directly out of the [[revision control]] of the various programs and applications which are shipped as part of the most recent version of Ubuntu. This will allow power users and upstream developers to test up-to-the-minute versions of individual programs as they would appear if currently packaged for the distribution, without needing to build packages. The early release will be able to provide early warning of build failures on various architectures.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDownUnder/BOFs/GrumpyGroundhog | title=GrumpyGroundhog specification | accessdate = 2006-06-29}}</ref> Grumpy Groundhog should merge with Debian Unstable every six months.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wiki.edubuntu.org/MarkShuttleworth | title=MarkShuttleworth - Ubuntu Wiki | accessdate = 2006-07-13}}</ref>

Ubuntu is currently funded by [[Canonical Ltd]]. On [[July 8]], [[2005]], [[Mark Shuttleworth]] and Canonical Ltd announced the creation of the [[Ubuntu Foundation]] and provided an initial funding of US$10&nbsp;million. The purpose of the foundation is to ensure the support and development for all future versions of Ubuntu. Mark Shuttleworth describes the foundation as an emergency fund in case Canonical's involvement ends.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2005-July/000025.html |title=Announcing Launch of ($10&nbsp;m) Ubuntu Foundation |accessdate = 2007-04-21 |date=2005-07-08 }}</ref>

Ubuntu 8.04, released on [[April 24]], [[2008]], is the current Long Term Support (LTS) release. Canonical has released previous LTS versions separated by two years, and has committed to releasing the next LTS version in 2010, two years after 8.04.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/13/ubuntu_linux_synchronization/|title= Next Ubuntu LTS in 2010, unless Linuxes synchronize|accessdate= 2008-06-03|author= Phil Manchester |last= Manchester

== Vendor support ==

Ubuntu is available pre-installed on computers from a number of different vendors, including [[Dell]], [[Tesco]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://direct.tesco.com/q/R.200-6129.aspx | title=Tesco Shipping Desktops with Ubuntu - eSys ePC|accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> and [[System 76]]. Dell and Tesco have provided this option since 2007, while System 76 has done so since November 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/linux_3x?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs | title=Ubuntu Customers | accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Dell and System76<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/news/system76-certified-servers | title=System76 announces servers with Ubuntu 7.10 and Canonical support services | accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref> customers are able to purchase 30-day, three-month, and yearly support for Ubuntu through Ubuntu's parent company Canonical. Dell later increased the availability of Ubuntu-based computers by offering them for sale in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]], and [[Latin America]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/dell | title=Ubuntu on Dell | accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref> Selected Dell machines running Ubuntu 7.10 have free and legal DVD playback capabilities using [[LinDVD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS7924076658.html|title=Dell announces Ubuntu 7.10 PCs with DVD playback (UPDATED)<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>

== Features ==

[[Image:Ubuntu606.png|right|thumb|A screenshot of Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, showing the ''Dawn of Ubuntu'' wallpaper]]
Ubuntu focuses on [[usability]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ | title=About Ubuntu | accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref> including the widespread use of the [[sudo]] tool for administrative tasks.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo?highlight=%28sudo%29 | title=RootSudo - Ubuntu Wiki | accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref> The Ubiquity installer allows installing Ubuntu to the hard disk from within the Live CD environment without the need for restarting the computer prior to installation. Ubuntu also emphasizes [[accessibility]] and [[internationalization]], to reach as many people as possible. Beginning with 5.04, [[UTF-8]] became the default [[character encoding]].<ref name="hoary_release" /> The default appearance of the user interface in the current version is called Human and is characterized by shades of brown and orange.

The most recent version of Ubuntu comes installed with the a wide range of software including: the [[OpenOffice.org]] productivity suite, the internet browser [[Firefox]], the instant messenger [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]] (formerly known as Gaim), the [[BitTorrent client]] [[Transmission (BitTorrent client)|Transmission]] and the [[raster graphics editor]] [[GIMP]]. Several lightweight [[card game|card]], [[Computer puzzle game|puzzle]] games, and [[board game]]s are pre-installed including [[Sudoku]] and [[chess]]. Ubuntu has all [[TCP and UDP port|networking ports]] closed by default for added security, although its [[firewall]], which offers more fine-grained control of incoming and outgoing connections, is installed but not enabled. Ubuntu is available in many languages. GNOME 2.22<U+2014>the default desktop environment of Ubuntu 8.04<U+2014>offers support for 46 languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.22/#rni18|title=GNOME 2.22 Release Notes - Internationalization|accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> There are numerous ways to install Ubuntu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/|title=Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron)|accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>

==== Desktop CD ====

The [[Live CD|desktop CD]] allows a user to try Ubuntu without actually installing Ubuntu; the user may optionally install Ubuntu later. This is the recommended CD to use. At least 384&nbsp;MB of RAM is required to install from this CD.

[[Image:Ubuntu 804-livecd-20080513-ubiquity-part 05-name and password-cropped.png|thumb|Ubiquity installer in Ubuntu 8.04 (''Hardy Heron'')]]
Ubuntu offers a fully featured set of applications that work straight from the standard install, but nonetheless fits on a single CD. The [[live CD]] allows users to see whether their hardware is compatible before installation to the hard disk. The live CD is then used to install Ubuntu using the Ubiquity installer.<ref name="livecdinstall">{{cite web | url=http://www.easy-ubuntu-linux.com/ubuntu-installation-606-2.html | title=Installing Ubuntu from the Live CD | accessdate=2006-07-08}}</ref> CDs are mailed free to anyone who requests them and CD images for all past and current versions are available for download. The Ubuntu live CD requires (for version 7.10) 256 megabytes of RAM, and once installed on the hard disk, Ubuntu needs four gigabytes of hard disk space.<ref name="hwreq">{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/desktopedition | title=Ubuntu 6.06 Release Notes: Hardware Requirements | accessdate=2006-07-08}}</ref> An alternative installation disc using the standard [[debian-installer]] in text mode is available for download only, and is aimed at people with lower system specifications, computer dealers selling systems already installed with Ubuntu, and for complex [[Disk partitioning|partitioning]] including the use of [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ | title=Ubuntu 6.06 LTS: Download | accessdate=2006-07-30}}</ref>

With the release of Ubuntu 7.04 in April 2007, the Ubuntu installation process changed slightly in that it now supports migration from Microsoft Windows.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.easy-ubuntu-linux.com/ubuntu-feisty-installation.html | title=Ubuntu 7.04 Adds a Migration Tool | accessdate=2006-06-27}}</ref> The new migration tool, called Migration Assistant, imports Windows users' bookmarks, desktop background (wallpaper), and settings for immediate use in the Ubuntu installation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://launchpad.net/migration-assistant|title=migration-assistant in Launchpad<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>

With [[Wubi (Ubuntu)|Wubi]], it is possible to install Ubuntu on a Windows partition, using an ISO file. Wubi also makes use of the Windows migration tool to import user's settings. Wubi was born as an independent project, as such 7.04 and 7.10 are unofficial releases. But since 8.04 the code has been merged within Ubuntu and since 8.04-alpha5, Wubi can also be found in the Ubuntu Live CD.<ref>
{{cite web| url=http://wubi.sourceforge.net/faq.php| title=Wubi - Ubuntu Installer for Windows| publisher=wubi.sourceforge.net| accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref>

Additionally, many programs exist to create a customized Live CD/DVD from an existing Ubuntu installation, such as [[remastersys]], the Ubuntu Customization Kit,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://uck.sourceforge.net/|title= UCK - Ubuntu Customization Kit|accessdate= 2008-06-06}}</ref> and Reconstructor.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://reconstructor.aperantis.com/index.php|title= reconstructor|accessdate= 2008-06-06}}</ref>

==== Alternate Installation ====
In addition to the desktop CD, Ubuntu can be installed through alternate methods. One such method is the alternate install CD.

The alternate install CD is an alternative installation disk designed for specialist installations of Ubuntu by providing a text-based rather than graphical installation. The alternate install CD allows for the creation of pre-configured [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] systems, for the upgrading of older installations without network access, and for installation on systems with less than 320&nbsp;MB of RAM. The alternate install CD also allows [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] and/or [[mdadm|RAID]] partitioning to be set up. The alternate install CD is not a [[Live CD]]. 

[[Image:Ubuntu-hardy-server-20080508.png|thumb|right|Default login screen for Ubuntu 8.04 (''Hardy Heron'')'s server edition]]
Ubuntu can also be installed over a network via the network install CD. The network install CD installs Ubuntu directly from an Ubuntu mirror. Installation from a mirror ensures that installed packages are up-to-date. The network install CD contains only the kernel, to start up the installation. The installation is text-based.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2007/10/08/how-to-install-ubuntu-locally-over-the-network/|title=How To Install Ubuntu Locally Over The Network|accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>

The final alternate installation method is used to install Ubuntu Server. The server install CD contains all packages needed for installation without a network connection. The server installation of Ubuntu does not install a graphical user interface.

== Package classification and support ==

[[Image:Ubuntu8.04.jpg|thumb|Ubuntu 8.04 CD]]

Ubuntu divides all software into four components,<ref name="components">{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components | title=ubuntu/components | accessdate=2006-03-16}}</ref> to reflect differences in licensing and level of support available. Packages are assigned to components as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
!!![[free software]]!!non-free software
|-
| '''supported''' || Main || Restricted
|-
| '''unsupported''' || Universe || Multiverse
|}

Free software here includes only that which meets the Ubuntu license requirements,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/licensing | title=ubuntu/licensing | accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> which correspond roughly to the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]]. There is one exception for Main however; it contains [[firmware]] and [[Computer font|fonts]] which are not allowed to be modified, but are included because their distribution is otherwise unencumbered.<ref name="components">{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/community/ubuntustory/components | title=ubuntu/components | accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref>

Non-free software is usually unsupported (Multiverse), but some exceptions (Restricted) are made for very important non-free software. Supported non-free software includes device drivers that are necessary to run Ubuntu on current hardware, such as binary-only [[graphics card]] [[device driver|drivers]]. The level of support is more limited than for main, since the developers may not have access to the [[source code]]. It is intended that Main and Restricted should contain all software needed for a general-use Linux system. Alternative programs for the same tasks and programs for specialized applications are placed in Universe and Multiverse.

Beyond the official repositories is Ubuntu Backports,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://backports.ubuntuforums.org/ | title=UbuntuBackports | accessdate=2006-03-16}}</ref> which is an officially recognized project to [[backport]] newer software from later versions of Ubuntu. The repository is not comprehensive; it mostly consists of user-requested packages, which are approved if they meet quality guidelines.

Old, unsupported releases are still available and can be updated through apt.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://old-releases.ubuntu.com|title= old-releases.ubuntu.com|accessdate= 2008-06-06
}}</ref>

== Availability of proprietary software ==

Ubuntu has a certification system for third party software.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ubuntu.com/partners/certification/software | title=partners/certification/software | accessdate=2006-03-16}}</ref> Proprietary software certified with Ubuntu should work well in Ubuntu. However, many programs familiar to users of non-free operating systems, such as [[Microsoft Windows]], are incompatible and are not Ubuntu-certified. Some proprietary software that does not limit distribution is included in Ubuntu's multiverse component. The package ubuntu-restricted-extras additionally contains software that may be legally restricted, including support for [[MP3]] and [[DVD-Video|DVD]] playback, Microsoft TrueType core fonts, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun's]] [[Java Virtual Machine|Java runtime environment]], [[Adobe Systems|Adobe's]] [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash Player]] plugin, many common audio/video [[codec]]s, and unrar, an unarchiver for [[RAR (file format)|.rar files]].

== Releases ==

Each release has both a code name and a version number. The version number is based on the year and month of release. For example, the very first release of Ubuntu 4.10 was released on [[October 20]], [[2004]].<ref name="warty_release">{{cite mailing list |url=https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2004-October/000003.html |title=Ubuntu 4.10 announcement |date=[[2004-10-20]] |accessdate=2007-09-25 |mailinglist=ubuntu-announce |last=Shuttleworth |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Shuttleworth }}</ref> Consequently, version numbers for future versions are provisional; if the release is delayed until a different month to that planned, the version number changes accordingly. The first characters of release names form an alphabetical series. This makes it easier to determine which release is newer when comparing two. Exceptions are the first few releases that should have begun with A, B, C.

Releases are timed to be approximately one month after GNOME releases, which are in turn about one month after releases of X.org. Consequently, every Ubuntu release comes with a newer version of both GNOME and X. Release 6.06<U+2014>and recently 8.04<U+2014>have been labeled as a Long Term Support (LTS)<!-- they use the acronym and the capitals -->, to indicate support with updates for three years on the desktop and five years on the server, with paid technical support available from [[Canonical Ltd.]]<ref name="lts">{{cite web | url=https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-April/000065.html | title=Announcing Beta release of Ubuntu 6.06 LTS | accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>

Ubuntu's popularity has climbed steadily since the software's release in 2004. Ubuntu has been the most viewed Linux distribution on [[DistroWatch|Distrowatch.com]] three years running, including 2005,<ref name="distro05" /> 2006,<ref name="distro06" /> 2007<ref name="distro07" /> and is currently the most viewed for 2008.<ref name="distro08">{{cite web|url=http://distrowatch.com/index.php?dataspan=26|title=distrowatch.com/index.php?dataspan=26<!-- INSERT TITLE -->|accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref> This popularity is borne out by a rise in Google searches for "Ubuntu" since 2004 as compared to a shrinking or plateauing number for terms related to other major desktop Linux distributions such as "[[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora]]", "[[Debian]]" or "[[SUSE Linux|SUSE]]" over the same period.<ref>[[Google Trends]], comparing [http://www.google.com/trends?q=Fedora|RHEL|Red+Hat,+Debian,+Ubuntu,+SUSE|OpenSUSE,+Mandrake|Mandriva&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=2 Fedora/RHEL/Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE/OpenSUSE, Mandrake/Mandriva], accessed on [[2008-06-13]]</ref> In an August 2007 survey of 38,500 visitors on DesktopLinux.com, Ubuntu was the most popular distribution with 30.3% of respondents claiming to use it.<ref name="Market Survey 2007" />

Ubuntu has received a few negative assessments. ''[[Ars Technica]]'' concluded in their review of Ubuntu 8.04 that while it was a clear improvement over Ubuntu 7.10, the failure to fix glaring issues detracted from the value of the release.<ref name="Heron has landed">{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/hardy-heron-review.ars|title= The heron has landed: a review of Ubuntu 8.04|accessdate= 2008-06-08|author= Ryan Paul|last= Paul|first= Ryan|date= 2008-05-07|work= [[Ars Technica]]|publisher= Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications}}</ref> Specifically, ''Ars Technica'' felt that [[Transmission (BitTorrent client)|Transmission]] (a BitTorrent client) was too simple and lacked features, that [[Tracker (desktop search software)|Tracker]] was vastly inferior to [[Beagle (software)|Beagle]] which Tracker had been chosen ahead of, and that the [[PulseAudio]] configuration that shipped is buggy.<ref name="Heron has landed" /> ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' criticized the lack of an integrated desktop effects manager, although this did not prevent them from naming Ubuntu the "best all-around Linux distribution available today".<ref name="PCW Ubu V Fed">{{cite web|url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,146400-page,1-c,linux/article.html|title= Desktop Linux Face-Off: Ubuntu 8.04 vs. Fedora 9|accessdate= 2008-06-12|author= Robert Strohmeyer|last= Strohmeyer|first= Robert|date= [[2008-06-02]]|year= 2008|month= June|work= [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|publisher= [[IDG|International Data Group]]}}</ref> ''ChannelWeb'' criticized the [[Wubi (Ubuntu)|Wubi]] installer, noting that it hung [[Windows Vista]] after the installation was complete.<ref name="CW Wins Laurels">{{cite web|url= http://www.crn.com/software/207401927;jsessionid=DRRXPFKYTBXVMQSNDLOSKH0CJUNN2JVN?pgno=2|title= Review: Why Ubuntu 'Hardy Heron' Wins Laurels|accessdate= 2008-06-12|author= Fahmida Y.
