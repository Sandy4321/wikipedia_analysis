'''''Wrecking Ball''''' is a 1995 album by [[Emmylou Harris]] in which she moves away from the traditional acoustic sound for which she had become known, to team up with rock producer [[Daniel Lanois]] (best known for his production work with [[U2]]) and engineer [[Mark Howard (producer)|Mark Howard]].<ref name="Chicago Tribune 1995">{{cite web |author=Hurst, Jack |title=Harris' Saving Grace May Be Her Difference |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-11-07/features/9511070252_1_country-radio-wrecking-ball-country-music |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=07 November 1995 |accessdate=12 May 2011}}</ref> The album has been noted for atmospheric feel, and featured guest performances by [[Steve Earle]], [[Larry Mullen]], [[Lucinda Williams]] and [[Neil Young]], who wrote the title song.

==Background==
Though her choice of songs had always been eclectic, the album was regarded as a departure for Harris who, by the age of 48, had become something of an elder stateswoman in country music. It received almost universally positive reviews, making many critics' year-end "best of" lists, and pointed Harris' career in a somewhat different direction, where she would incorporate a harder, albeit plaintive edge that would single her out from the complacent, [[country music]] mainstream. As a career-redefining album, ''Wrecking Ball'' was likened to [[Marianne Faithfull]]'s 1979 ''[[Broken English (album)|Broken English]]'' album and [[Johnny Cash]]'s later ''[[American Recordings (album)|American Recordings]]''.  ''Wrecking Ball'' won the 1995 [[Grammy Award]] for Best Contemporary Folk Recording.
