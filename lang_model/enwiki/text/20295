The '''Appalachian Mountains''' (French: ''les Appalaches'') are a vast system of mountains in eastern [[North America]].

The range is mostly located in the [[United States]] but extends into southeastern [[Canada]],  forming a zone, from 100 to 300 miles (160 to 480 km) wide, running from the island of [[Newfoundland]] 1,500 miles (2,400 km) south-westward to central [[Alabama]] in the United States (with foothills in northeastern [[Mississippi]]).  The system is divided into a series of ranges, with the individual mountains averaging around 3,000 ft (900 m). The highest of the group is [[Mount Mitchell (North Carolina)|Mt. Mitchell]] in [[North Carolina]] ([[1 E3 m|6,684 ft or 2,037m]]), which is the highest point in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]] as well as the highest point in eastern North America.

The term ''[[Appalachia]]'' is used to refer to different naughty regions associated with the mountain range.  Most broadly, it refers to the entire mountain range with its surrounding hills and the dissected plateau region.  However, the term is often used more restrictively to refer to regions in the central and southern Appalachian Mountains, usually including areas in the states of [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], and [[North Carolina]], and sometimes extending as far south as northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and western [[South Carolina]], as far north as [[Pennsylvania]], and as far west as southern [[Ohio]].

While exploring the northern coast of Florida in 1528, the members of the [[Narv<U+00E1>ez expedition]], including [[<U+00C1>lvar N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez Cabeza de Vaca]], found a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] town which they transliterated as ''Apalachen'' {{IPA|[a.pa<U+02C8>la.t<U+0283><U+025B>n]}}. This name and its pronunciation were applied to the [[Apalachee]] Indians, as well as a nearby body of water, now spelled Apalachee Bay, to the [[Apalachicola River]] and the Apalachicola Bay, and to the city known as [[Apalachicola, Florida]]. 

The word "Apalachen" was also applied to an inland mountain range, and through the course of time it became applied to the entire range and its spelling was changed. 

==Pronunciation==

In northern U.S. and Canadian dialects, the mountains are pronounced the {{IPA|[<U+00E6>.p<U+0259><U+02C8>'''le<U+026A>'''.t<U+0283><U+0259>nz]}}, or {{IPA|[<U+00E6>.p<U+0259><U+02C8>'''le<U+026A>'''.<U+0283><U+0259>nz]}}. The third syllable is like "lay".

In Southern U.S. dialects, the mountains are pronounced the {{IPA|[<U+00E6>.p<U+0259><U+02C8>'''l<U+00E6>'''.t<U+0283><U+0259>nz]}}, and the cultural region of the mountain South is pronounced {{IPA|[<U+00E6>.p<U+0259><U+02C8>'''l<U+00E6>'''.t<U+0283>(i)<U+0259>]}}. The third syllable is like the "la" in "latch".

The whole system may be divided into three great sections: the ''Northern'', from the [[Canadian province]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] to the [[Hudson River]]; the ''Central'', from the Hudson Valley to that of [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] (Great Kanawha), in Virginia and West Virginia; and the ''Southern'', from New River onwards.

The northern section includes the [[Long Range Mountains]] and [[Annieopsquotch Mountains]] on the island of Newfoundland, [[Shickshock Mountains]] and [[Notre Dame Mountains|Notre Dame Range]] in Quebec and New Brunswick, scattered elevations and small ranges elsewhere in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the [[Longfellow Mountains]] in Maine, the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in New Hampshire, the [[Green Mountains]] in Vermont, and [[The Berkshires]] in Massachusetts.  The central section comprises, besides various minor groups, the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|Valley Ridges]] between the [[Allegheny Front]] of the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and the [[Great Appalachian Valley]], the [[New York - New Jersey Highlands]], the [[Taconic Mountains]] in New York, and a large portion of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]].  The southern section consists of the prolongation of the Blue Ridge, the [[Unaka Range]], and the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|Valley Ridges]] adjoining the [[Cumberland Plateau]], with some lesser ranges.

The [[Adirondack Mountains]] in New York are sometimes considered part of the Appalachian chain but, geologically speaking, are a southern extension of the [[Laurentian Mountains]] of [[Canada]].

In addition to the true folded mountains, known as the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|ridge and valley province]], the area of [[dissected plateau]] to the north and west of the mountains is usually grouped with the Appalachians. This includes the [[Catskill Mountains]] of southeastern [[New York]], the [[The Poconos|Poconos]] in [[Pennsylvania]], and the [[Allegheny Plateau]] of southwestern New York, western Pennsylvania, eastern [[Ohio]] and northern [[West Virginia]]. This same plateau is known as the [[Cumberland Plateau]] in southern [[West Virginia]], eastern [[Kentucky]], western [[Virginia]], and eastern [[Tennessee]].

The dissected plateau area, while not actually made up of geological [[mountain]]s, is popularly called "mountains", especially in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia, and while the ridges are not high, the terrain is extremely rugged. In Ohio and New York, some of the plateau has been glaciated, which has rounded off the sharp ridges, and filled the valleys to some extent. The glaciated regions are usually referred to as hill country rather than mountains.

The Appalachian region is generally considered the geographical dividing line between the [[eastern seaboard]] of the United States and the [[Midwest]] region of the country.  The [[Eastern Continental Divide]] follows the Appalachian Mountains from [[Pennsylvania]] to Georgia. 

The [[Appalachian Trail]] is a 2,175 mile hiking trail that runs all the way from [[Mount Katahdin]] in Maine to [[Springer Mountain]] in Georgia, passing over or past a large part of the Appalachian system.  The [[International Appalachian Trail]] is an extension of this hiking trail into the Canadian portion of the Appalachian range.

==The chief summits==

The Appalachian belt includes, with the ranges enumerated above, the plateaus sloping southward to the Atlantic Ocean in New England, and south-eastward to the border of the coastal plain through the central and southern Atlantic states; and on the north-west, the Allegheny and Cumberland plateaus declining toward the Great Lakes and the interior plains. A remarkable feature of the belt is the longitudinal chain of broad valleys<U+2014>the Great Appalachian Valley<U+2014>which in the southerly sections divides the mountain system into two subequal portions, but in the northernmost lies west of all the ranges possessing typical Appalachian features, and separates them from the Adirondack group. The mountain system has no axis of dominating altitudes, but in every portion the summits rise to rather uniform heights, and, especially in the central section, the various ridges and intermontane valleys have the same trend as the system itself. None of the summits reaches the region of perpetual snow.

[[Image:Appalachian fault.jpg|thumb|500px|left|Old fault exposed by roadcut near [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] along [[Interstate 81]]. Such faults are common in the folded Appalachians.]]

Mountains of the [[Long Range Mountains|Long Range]] in [[Newfoundland]] reach heights of nearly 3,000 ft. In the Shickshocks and Notre Dame ranges in Quebec the higher summits rise to about 4,000 ft. elevation. Isolated peaks and small ranges in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] vary from of 1,000 - 2,700 ft.  In [[Maine]] several peaks exceed 4,000 ft., including [[Mount Katahdin]] (5,271 ft.). In [[New Hampshire]], many summits rise above 4,000 feet, including [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] (6,288 ft.), plus [[Mount Adams (New Hampshire)|Adams]] (5,771), [[Mount Jefferson (New Hampshire)|Jefferson]] (5,712), [[Mount Clay|Clay]] (5,533), [[Mount Monroe (New Hampshire)|Monroe]] (5,380), [[Mount Madison|Madison]] (5,367), and [[Mount Lafayette]] (5,260). In the [[Green Mountains]] the highest point, [[Mount Mansfield|Mt. Mansfield]], is 4,393 feet in elevation; others include [[Killington Peak]] at 4,226 ft., [[Camel's Hump (Vermont)|Camel's Hump]] at 4,083 ft., [[Mount Abraham (Vermont)|Mt. Abraham]] at 4,006 ft., and a number of other heights exceeding 3,000 ft.

In Pennsylvania, the summits in the Ridge and Valley region rise generally to about 2,000 ft.  In Maryland, Eagle Rock and Dans Rock are conspicuous points reaching 3,162 ft. and 2,882 ft. respectively. On the same side of the Great Valley, south of the Potomac, are the Pinnacle (3,007 ft.) and Pidgeon Roost (3,400 ft.). In [[West Virginia]], more than 150 peaks rise above 4,000 ft., including [[Spruce Knob]] (4863 ft.), the highest point in the Allegheny Mountains. A number of other points in the state rise above 4,800 ft. Thorny Flat (4,848 ft.) and [[Bald Knob]] (4,842 ft.) are among the more notable peaks in West Virginia. 

The [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], rising in southern [[Pennsylvania]] and there known as [[South Mountain (Maryland and Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]], attain in that state an elevation of about 2,000 ft.; southward to the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] its altitudes diminish, but once in Virginia the Blue Ridge again reaches 2,000 ft. and higher. In the [[Virginia]] Blue Ridge, the following are the highest peaks east of the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]]: Mary's Rock (3,523 ft), Stony Man (4,031), [[Hawksbill Mountain]] (4,066), and [[Peaks of Otter]] (4001 and 3875). 

In the southern section of the Blue Ridge are [[Grandfather Mountain]] (5,964 ft.), with three other summits above 5,000, and a dozen more above 4000. The [[Unaka Range]]s (including the Black and Great Smoky Mountains) have eighteen peaks higher than 5,000 ft., and eight surpassing 6,000 ft. In the [[Black Mountains (North Carolina)|Black Mountains]], [[Mount Mitchell (North Carolina)|Mt. Mitchell]] (the culminating point of the whole system) attains an altitude of 6,684 feet.  In the [[Great Smoky Mountains]], [[Clingmans Dome]] (6,643 ft.) is the highest peak, with several others above 6,000 and many higher than 5,000.

In spite of the existence of the Great Appalachian Valley, the master streams are transverse to the axis of the system. The [[water divide|height of land]] of the Appalachians follows a tortuous course which crosses the mountainous belt just north of the New River in Virginia; south of the New River the rivers head in the Blue Ridge, cross the higher Unakas, receive important tributaries from the Great Valley, and traversing the Cumberland Plateau in spreading gorges, escape by way of the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers to the Ohio and Mississippi, and thus to the Gulf of Mexico; in the central section the rivers, rising in or beyond the Valley Ridges, flow through great gorges (water gaps) to the Great Valley, and by south-easterly courses across the Blue Ridge to tidal estuaries penetrating the coastal plain; in the northern section the height of land lies on the inland side of the mountainous belt, the main lines of drainage running from north to south.

The Appalachians are aging mountains.  A look at rocks exposed in today's Appalachian mountains reveals elongated belts of folded and thrust [[Geologic fault|faulted]] marine [[sedimentary rock]]s, [[volcanic rock]]s and slivers of ancient ocean floor, which provides strong evidence that these rocks were deformed during plate collision.  The birth of the Appalachian ranges, some 300 million years ago, marks the first of several mountain building plate collisions that culminated in the construction of the supercontinent [[Pangea]] with the Appalachians near the center.  Because North America and Africa were connected, the Appalachians form part of the same mountain chain as the [[Anti-Atlas]] in [[Morocco]]. To the northeast, the same mountain chain continues into Scotland, from the North America/Europe collision. 

During the middle [[Ordovician Period]] (about 496-440 million years ago), a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain building event ([[Taconic orogeny]]) in [[North America]].  The once-quiet Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate, the [[Iapetus Ocean|Iapetus]], collided with and began sinking beneath the [[North American craton]].  With the birth of this new [[subduction]] zone, the early Appalachians were born.  Along the continental margin, volcanoes grew, coincident with the initiation of subduction.  Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin.  As mountains rose, erosion began to wear them down. Streams carried rock debris downslope to be deposited in nearby lowlands.  The Taconic Orogeny was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians, culminating in the collision of North America and Africa (see [[Appalachian orogeny]]).

By the end of the [[Mesozoic]] era, the Appalachian Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain.  It was not until the region was uplifted during the [[Cenozoic Era]] that the distinctive topography of the present formed.  Uplift [[rejuvenation (river)|rejuvenated]] the streams, which rapidly responded by cutting downward into the ancient bedrock.  Some streams flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many millions of years earlier.  Other streams [[downcutting|downcut]] so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core, carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures.

The Appalachian Mountains contain major deposits of [[anthracite]] [[coal]] as well as [[bituminous]] coal. In the folded mountains the coal is in metamorphosed form as anthracite represented by the [[Coal Region]] of northeastern Pennsylvania. The bituminous coal fields of western Pennsylvania, western Maryland, southeastern Ohio, eastern Kentucky, and West Virginia is the sedimentary form. Some plateaus of the Appalachian Mountains contain metallic minerals such as [[iron]] and [[zinc]].

==Flora and fauna==
[[Image:Mount Mitchell-27527.jpg|thumb|600px|right|<center>At 6,684 feet, [[Mount Mitchell]] is the highest point in the Appalachians.]]
The floras of the Appalachians are diverse and vary primarily in response to geology, latitude, elevation and moisture availability. They consist primarily of deciduous broad-leaf trees and evergreen needle-leaf conifers, but also contain the evergreen broad-leaf [[American Holly]] (''Ilex opaca''), and the deciduous needle-leaf conifer, the [[Tamarack Larch|Tamarack]], or Eastern Larch (''Larix laricina'').

The dominant northern and high elevation conifer is the [[Red Spruce]] (''Picea rubens''), which grows from near sea level to above 4000 feet (1219 m) above sea level (asl) in northern [[New England]] and southeastern Canada. It also grows southward along the Appalachian crest to the highest elevations of the southern Appalachians, as in North Carolina and Tennessee. In the central Appalachians it is usually confined above 3000 feet (914 m) asl, except for a few cold valleys in which it reaches lower elevations. In the southern Appalachians it is restricted to higher elevations. Another species is the [[Black Spruce]] (''Picea mariana''), which extends farthest north of any conifer in North America, is found at high elevations in the northern Appalachians, and in bogs as far south as Pennsylvania.

The Appalachians are also home to two species of fir, the boreal [[Balsam Fir]] (''Abies balsamea''), and the southern high elevation endemic, [[Fraser Fir]] (''Abies fraseri''), which is confined to the highest parts of the southern Appalachian mountains. By contrast, Balsam Fir is found from near sea level to the tree line in the northern Appalachians, but ranges only as far south as Virginia and West Virginia in the central Appalachians, where it is usually confined above 3900 feet (1189 m)asl, except in cold valleys. Curiously, it is associated with oaks in Virginia. The Balsam Fir of Virginia and West Virginia is thought by some to be a natural hybrid between the more northern variety and Fraser Fir. While Red Spruce is common in both upland and bog habitats, Balsam Fir, as well as Black Spruce and Tamarack, are more characteristic of the latter. However Balsam Fir also does well in soils with a pH as high as 6 <ref>Fowells, H.A., 1965, ''Silvics of Forest Trees of the United States,'' Agricultural Handbook No. 271, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service, Washington D.C.</ref>.

[[Eastern Hemlock|Eastern or Canada Hemlock]] (''Tsuga canadensis'') is another important evergreen needle-leaf conifer that grows along the Appalachian chain from north to south, but is confined to lower elevations than Red Spruce and the firs. It generally occupies richer and less acidic soils than the spruce and firs and is characteristic of deep, shaded and moist mountain valleys and coves. It is, unfortunately, subject to the [[Hemlock Woolly Adelgid]] (''Adelges tsugae''), an introduced insect, that is rapidly extirpating it as a forest tree. Less abundant, and restricted to the southern Appalachians, is [[Carolina Hemlock]] (''Tsuga caroliniana''). Like Canada Hemlock, this tree suffers severely from the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid.

Several species of pines characteristic of the Appalachians are [[Eastern White Pine]] (''Pinus strobus ''), [[Virginia Pine]] (''Pinus virginiana''), [[Pitch Pine]] (''Pinus rigida ''), [[Table Mountain Pine]] (''Pinus pungens'') and [[Shortleaf Pine]] (''Pinus echinata''). [[Red Pine]] (''Pinus resinosa'') is a boreal species that forms a few high elevation outliers as far south as West Virginia. All of these species except White Pine tend to occupy sandy, rocky, poor soil sites, which are mostly acidic in character. White Pine, a large species valued for its timber, tends to do best in rich, moist soil, either acidic or alkaline in character. Pitch Pine is also at home in acidic, boggy soil, and Table Mountain Pine may occasionally be found in this habitat as well. Shortleaf Pine is generally found in warmer habitats and at lower elevations than the other species. All the species listed do best in open or lightly shaded habitats, although White Pine also thrives in shady coves, valleys, and on floodplains.

The Appalachians are characterized by a wealth of large, beautiful deciduous broadleaf (hardwood) trees. Their occurrences are best summarized and described in [[Emma Lucy Braun|E. Lucy Braun]]'s 1950 classic, ''Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America'' (Macmillan, New York). The most diverse and richest forests are the Mixed Mesophytic or medium moisture types, which are largely confined to rich, moist montane soils of the southern and central Appalachians, particularly in the Cumberland and Allegheny Mountains, but also thrive in the southern Appalachian coves. Characteristic canopy species are [[Tilia heterophylla|White Basswood]] (''Tilia heterophylla''), [[Yellow Buckeye]] (''Aesculus octandra''), [[Sugar Maple]] (''Acer saccharum''), [[American Beech]] (''Fagus grandifolia''), [[Tuliptree]] (''Liriodendron tulipifera''), [[White Ash]] (''Fraxinus americana '') and [[Yellow Birch]] (''Betula alleganiensis''). Other common trees are [[Red Maple]] (''Acer rubrum''), [[Shagbark Hickory|Shagbark]] and [[Bitternut Hickory|Bitternut]] Hickories (''Carya ovata ''and ''C. cordiformis'') and [[Sweet Birch|Black or Sweet Birch]] (''Betula lenta ''). Small understory trees and shrubs include [[Flowering Dogwood]] (''Cornus florida''), [[Hophornbeam]] (''Ostrya virginiana''), [[Witch-hazel]] (''Hamamelis virginiana'') and [[Lindera|Spicebush]] (''Lindera benzoin''). There are also hundreds of perennial and annual herbs, among them such herbal and medicinal plants as American [[Ginseng]] (''Panax quinquefolius''), [[Goldenseal]] (''Hydrastis canadensis''), [[Bloodroot]] (''Sanguinaria canadensis'') and [[Black Cohosh]] (''Cimicifuga racemosa'').

The foregoing trees, shrubs and herbs are also more widely distributed in less rich [[mesic habitat|mesic]] forests that generally occupy coves, stream valleys and flood plains throughout the southern and central Appalachians at low and intermediate elevations. In the northern Appalachians and at higher elevations of the central and southern Appalachians these diverse mesic forests give way to less diverse "Northern Hardwoods" with canopies dominated only by American Beech, Sugar Maple, [[American Basswood]] (''Tilia americana'') and Yellow Birch and with far fewer species of shrubs and herbs.

Dryer and rockier uplands and ridges are occupied by Oak-Chestnut type forests dominated by a variety of oaks (''Quercus'' spp.), [[hickory|hickories]] (''Carya'' spp.) and, in the past, by the [[American Chestnut]] (''Castanea dentata''). The American Chestnut was virtually eliminated as a canopy species by the introduced fungal [[Chestnut blight|Chestnut Blight]] (''Cryphonectaria parasitica''), but lives on as sapling-sized sprouts that originate from roots, which are not killed by the fungus. In present day forest canopies Chestnut has been largely replaced by oaks.

The oak forests of the southern and central Appalachians consist largely of [[Black oak|Black]], [[Northern Red Oak|Northern Red]], [[White oak|White]], [[Chestnut Oak|Chestnut]] and [[Scarlet Oak|Scarlet]] Oaks (''Quercus velutina, Q. rubra, Q. alba, Q. prinus and Q. coccinea'') and hickories, such as the Pignut (''Carya glabra'') in particular. The richest forests, which grade into mesic types, usually in coves and on gentle slopes, have dominantly White and Northern Red Oaks, while the driest sites are dominated by Chestnut Oak, or sometimes by Scarlet or Northern Red Oaks. In the northern Appalachians the oaks, except for White and Northern Red, drop out, while the latter extends farthest north.

The oak forests generally lack the diverse small tree, shrub and herb layers of mesic forests. Shrubs are generally ericaceous, and include the evergreen [[Mountain Laurel]] (''Kalmia latifolia''), various species of [[blueberry|blueberries]] (''Vaccinium'' spp.), [[Black Huckleberry]] (''Gaylussacia baccata''), a number of deciduous [[rhododendron]]s (azaleas), and smaller heaths such as [[Teaberry]] ('' Gaultheria procumbens'') and [[Trailing Arbutus]] (''Epigaea repens ''). The evergreen Great Rhododendron (''Rhododendron maximum'') is characteristic of moist stream valleys. These occurrences are in line with the prevailing acidic character of most oak forest soils. In contrast, the much rarer [[Chinquapin oak|Chinquapin Oak]] (''Quercus muehlenbergii'') demands alkaline soils and generally grows where limestone rock is near the surface. Hence no ericaceous shrubs are associated with it.

The Appalachian floras also include a diverse assemblage of [[bryophyte]]s (mosses and liverworts), as well as [[fungi]]. Some species are rare and/or endemic. As with vascular plants, these tend to be closely related to the character of the soils and thermal environment in which they are found.

Eastern deciduous forests are subject to a number of serious insect and disease outbreaks. Among the most conspicuous is that of the introduced [[Gypsy moth|Gypsy Moth]]  (''Lymantria dispar''), which infests primarily oaks, causing severe defoliation and tree mortality. But it also has the benefit of eliminating weak individuals, and thus improving the genetic stock, as well as creating rich habitat of a type through accumulation of dead wood. Because hardwoods sprout so readily, this moth is not as harmful as the [[Hemlock Woolly Adelgid]]. Perhaps more serious is the introduced Beech Bark Disease Complex, which includes both a scale insect (''Cryptococcus fagisuga'')  and fungal components.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries the Appalachian forests were subject to severe and destructive logging and land clearing, which resulted in the designation of the National Forests and Parks as well many state protected areas. However, these and a variety of other destructive activities continue, albeit in diminished forms; and thus far only a few ecologically based management practices have taken hold.

Animals that characterize the Appalachian forests include five species of tree squirrels. The most commonly seen is the low to moderate elevation [[Eastern Gray Squirrel]] (''Sciurus carolinensis'').  Occupying similar habitat is the slightly larger [[Fox Squirrel]] ('' Sciurus niger'') and the much smaller [[Southern Flying Squirrel]] (''Glaucomys volans''). More characteristic of cooler northern and high elevation habitat is the [[American Red Squirrel|Red Squirrel]] (''Tamiasciurus hudsonicus''), whereas the Appalachian [[Northern Flying Squirrel]] (''Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus''), which closely resembles the Southern Flying Squirrel, is confined to northern hardwood and spruce-fir forests.

As familiar as squirrels are the [[Eastern Cottontail]] rabbit ('' Silvilagus floridanus'') and the [[White-tailed Deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''). The latter inparticular has greatly increased in abundance as a result of the extirpation of the [[Gray Wolf]] (''Canis lupus '') and the Eastern [[Cougar]] or Mountain Lion (''Felis concolor cougar'') by Euro-Americans. This has led to the overgrazing and browsing of many plants of the Appalachian forests, as well as destruction of agricultural crops. Other deer include the [[Moose]] (''Alces alces ''), found only in the north, and the [[Elk (Cervus canadensis)|Elk]] (''Cervus canadensis''), which, although once extirpated, is now making a comeback, through transplantation, in the southern and central Appalachians. An additional species that is common in the north but extends its range southward at high elevations to Virginia and West Virginia is the Varying or [[Snowshoe Hare]] (''Lepus americanus'').  However, these central Appalachian populations are scattered and very small.

Another species of great interest is the [[Beaver]] (''Castor canadensis''), which is showing a great resurgence in numbers after its near extirpation for its pelt. This resurgence is bringing about a drastic alteration in habitat through the construction of dams and other structures throughout the mountains.

Other common forest animals are the [[American Black Bear|Black Bear]] (''Ursus americanus''), [[Striped Skunk]] (''Mephitis mephitis''), [[Raccoon]] (''Procyon lotor''), [[Woodchuck]] (''Marmota monax''), [[Bobcat]] (''Felis rufus''), [[Gray Fox]] (''Urocyon cinereoargenteus'') and in recent years, the [[Coyote]] (''Canis latrans''), another species favored by the advent of Europeans and the extirpation of the [[Gray Wolf]].

Characteristic birds of the forest are [[Wild Turkey]] (''Meleagris gallopavo''), [[Ruffed Grouse]] (''Bonasa umbellus''), [[Mourning Dove]] (''Zenaida macroura''), [[Common Raven]] (''Corvus corax''), [[Wood Duck]] (''Aix sponsa''), [[Great Horned Owl]] (''Bubo virginianus''), [[Barred Owl]] (''Strix varia''), [[Scops owl|Screech Owl]] (''Megascops asio''), [[Red-tailed Hawk]] (''Buteo jamaicensis''), [[Red-shouldered Hawk]] (''Buteo lineatus''), and [[Northern Goshawk]] (''Accipiter gentilis''), as well as a great variety of "songbirds" ([[Passeriformes]]), like the warblers in particular.

Of great importance are the many species of [[salamander]]s, and in particular the [[lungless salamander|lungless]] species (Family ''Plethodontidae'') that live in great abundance concealed by leaves and debris, on the forest floor. Most frequently seen, however, is the [[Eastern newt|Eastern or Red-spotted Newt]] (''Notophthalmus viridescens''), whose terrestrial eft form is often encountered on the open, dry forest floor.  It has been estimated that salamanders represent the largest class of animal biomass in the Appalachian forests. Frogs and toads are of lesser diversity and abundance, but the [[Wood Frog]] (''Rana sylvatica'') is, like the eft, commonly encountered on the dry forest floor, while a number of species of small frogs, such as [[Spring Peeper]]s (''Pseudacris crucifer''), enliven the forest with their calls. Salamanders and other amphibians contribute greatly to nutrient cycling through their consumption of small life forms on the forest floor and in aquatic habitats.

Although reptiles are less abundant and diverse than amphibians, a number of snakes are conspicuous members of the fauna. One of the largest is the non-poisonous [[Black Rat Snake]] (''Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta''), while the [[Common Garter Snake]] (''Thamnophis sirtalis'') is among the smallest but most abundant. The [[American Copperhead]] (''Agkistrodon contortrix'') and the [[Timber Rattler]] (''Crotalus horridus'') are poisonous [[pit viper]]s. There are few lizards, but the [[Broad-headed Skink]] (''Eumeces laticeps''), at up to 13 inches (33 cm) in length, and an excellent climber and swimmer, is one of the largest and most spectacular in appearance and action. The most common turtle is the [[Eastern Box Turtle]] (''Terrapene carolina carolina''), which is found in both upland and lowland forests in the central and southern Appalachians. Prominent among aquatic species is the large [[Snapping Turtle]] (''Chelydra serpentina''), which occurs throughout the Appalachians.

Appalachian streams are notable for their highly diverse freshwater fish life. Among the most abundant and diverse are those of the minnow family (Family [[Cyprinidae]]), while species of the colorful [[Darter (fish)|Darters]] (''Percina'' spp.) are also abundant <ref>Page, Lawrence M. and Brooks M. Burr 1991, ''A Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes, North America, North of Mexico,'' Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston</ref>.

A characteristic fish of shaded, cool Appalachian forest streams is the [[Brook trout|Wild Brook or Speckled Trout]] (''Salvelinus fontinalis''), which is much sought after for its sporting qualities. However in past years such trout waters have been much degraded by increasing temperatures due to timber cutting, global warming and by pollution from various sources.

==Influence on history==
For a century, the Appalachians were a barrier to the westward expansion of the British colonies; the continuity of the system, the bewildering multiplicity of its succeeding ridges, the tortuous courses and roughness of its transverse passes, a heavy forest, and dense undergrowth all conspired to hold the settlers on the seaward-sloping plateaus and coastal plains. Only by way of the [[Hudson Valley|Hudson]] and [[Mohawk Valley]]s, and round about the southern termination of the system were there easy routes to the interior of the country, and these were long closed by powerful [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes such as the [[Iroquois]], [[Creek people|Creek]], and [[Cherokee]], among others. British expansion was also blocked by Spanish colonies in the south and French activity throughout the interior.

In eastern Pennsylvania the [[Great Appalachian Valley]], or Great Valley, was accessible by reason of a broad gateway between the end of [[South Mountain (Maryland and Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]] and the Highlands, and here between the Susquehanna and Delaware Rivers settled many [[Germans]] and [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravians]], whose descendants even now retain the peculiar patois known as "[[Pennsylvania Dutch]]". These were late comers to the New World forced to the frontier to find cheap land. With their followers of both German and [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] origin, they worked their way southward and soon occupied all of the [[Shenandoah Valley]], ceded by the Iroquois, and the upper reaches of the Great Valley tributaries of the [[Tennessee]], ceded by the Cherokee.

By 1755, the obstacle to westward expansion had been thus reduced by half; outposts of the English colonists had penetrated the Allegheny and Cumberland plateaus, threatening French monopoly in the transmontane region, and a conflict became inevitable. Making common cause against the French to determine the control of the [[Ohio River|Ohio valley]], the unsuspected strength of the colonists was revealed, and the successful ending of the [[French and Indian War]] extended England's territory to the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]. To this strength the geographic isolation enforced by the Appalachian mountains had been a prime contributor. The confinement of the colonies between an ocean and a mountain wall led to the fullest occupation of the coastal border of the continent, which was possible under existing conditions of agriculture, conducing to a community of purpose, a political and commercial solidarity, which would not otherwise have been developed. As early as 1700 it was possible to ride from [[Portland, Maine]], to southern [[Virginia]], sleeping each night at some considerable village. In contrast to this complete industrial occupation, the French territory was held by a small and very scattered population, its extent and openness adding materially to the difficulties of a disputed tenure. Bearing the brunt of this contest as they did, the colonies were undergoing preparation for the subsequent struggle with the home government. Unsupported by shipping, the American armies fought toward the sea with the mountains at their back protecting them against British leagued with the Aboriginals. The few settlements beyond the Great Valley were free for self-defence because debarred from general participation in the conflict by reason of their position.

Before the [[French and Indian War]], the Appalachian Mountains lay on the indeterminate boundary between Britain's colonies along the Atlantic and French areas centered in the Mississippi basin.  After the French and Indian War, the [[Proclamation of 1763]] restricted settlement for [[Great Britain]]'s thirteen original colonies in North America to east of the summit line of the mountains (except in the northern regions where the [[Great Lakes]] formed the boundary).  Although the line was adjusted several times to take frontier settlements into account and was impossible to enforce as law, it was strongly resented by backcountry settlers throughout the Appalachians. The Proclamation Line can be seen as one of the grievances which led to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Many frontier settlers held that the defeat of the French opened the land west of the mountains to English settlement, only to find settlement barred by the British King's proclamation. The backcountry settlers who fought in the Illinois campaign of [[George Rogers Clark]] were motivated to fight largely because they desired to settle in Kentucky and north of the Ohio River, in direct violation of the colonial law and any number of treaties between Britain and Native American nations.

With the formation of the [[United States of America]], an important first phase of [[westward expansion]] in the late [[18th century]] and early [[19th century]] consisted of the migration of European-descended settlers westward across the mountains into the [[Ohio River|Ohio Valley]] through the [[Cumberland Gap]] and other mountain passes. The [[Erie Canal]], finished in 1825, formed the first route through the Appalachians that was capable of large amounts of commerce.
