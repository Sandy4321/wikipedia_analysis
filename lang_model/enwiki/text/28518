<!--You can add all your notable achievements within the body of the article below, not at the top--summarize everything and please do not use publicist's or press kit words ! -->

==Early life and Discovery==

Cuneta was born on January 6, 1966 to parents, [[Pablo Cuneta]] (former mayor of Pasay City and mayor with the longest years of service in Philippine history) and Elaine Gamboa (sister of 60s Shingaling Sweetheart, [[Helen Gamboa]]). She has lived most of her early years in one of the exclusive villages in the South, [[Dasmarinas Village]].<ref name="goignition.com">http://www.goignition.com/sharon/shawie/wonder01.html</ref>

Cuneta grew up surrounded by music, listening to her dad's collection of 45s, 78s and 331/3s. Cuneta during her early years made her first TV appearance in Kuya Ike Lozada's show, in the Bulilit portion, where she mimicked her Aunt Helen's songs. Cuneta was just as young when she appeared in her first movie, the Rosanna Ortiz-George Estregan starrer 'Lovers for Hire'. She played one of Roderick Paulate's playmates.<ref name="goignition.com"/>

Cuneta attended [[St. Paul University Manila]] and [[International School Manila]] for her primary to secondary education.<ref>http://www.goignition.com/sharon/shawie/wonder02.html</ref>

At the age of 11, in one of the parties Cuneta and her family has attended, she was asked to sing one of Cinderella's 70s hits entitled, '"Bato sa Buhangin". One of the guests in the party was TV host and comedian, Tito Sotto, who was [[Vicor Records]]' vice president at that time. Sotto invited Cuneta to make a record under the label he works for.<ref>http://www.remate.ph/2012/03/127416/#.UhiwwdKmiZg</ref>

Cuneta recorded her first single entitled, "Tawag ng Pag-ibig" (Call of Love) at the age of 12. However, the record received a lukewarm response from the public as they felt that Cuneta was too young to record a love song, yet too old to record a children's song.

===1978<U+2013>1980: Career Beginnings, Jukebox Princess===
After the lukewarm response to her first single, "Tawag ng Pag-Ibig", Sotto tapped composer, [[Rey Valera]] to create a song for the 12 year old aspiring singer. Valera composed, "Mr. DJ" and handed it over to Sotto.

Cuneta first appeared on Philippine pop charts in 1978 with the Filipino pop culture hit "Mr. D.J.". The song became popular that gave her the moniker, "DJ's Pet) (which also became the title of her debut LP. Cuneta release one hit single after another  including "Naaalala Ka", "I-Swing Mo Ako", "Kahit Maputi Na Ang Buhok Ko" and "High School Life" which were also part of the Manila Sound era.

Aside from her recording career, Cuneta also began hosting with her aunt, Helen Gamboa in a variety show entitled, C.U.T.E. or Call Us Two for Entertainment in GMA7.<ref>http://www.sharoncuneta.com/main.php?menu=2&subm=2&art=2</ref>

In 1980, Cuneta was tapped to sing the theme song of a Vilma Santos starrer and a Cebu Film Festival entry entitled, "Langis at Tubig" (Oil and Water). The song was also Cuneta's first George Canseco song.

At the time of the Cebu Film Festival, Santos was pregnant, Director Danny Zialcita asked Cuneta to pinch-hit, to ride the float during the parade. Zialcita told her: "If you would do this for me I will make you a star. It was a commitment, a promise I made to her."<ref>http://www.goignition.com/sharon/megastar/movie02.html</ref>

===1981<U+2013>1983: ''Dear Heart'' and Early Movie Career===
In 1981, Contrary to popular notion, Cuneta's first movie was not produced by Viva Films but by a production outfit known as Sining Silangan. Director [[Danny Zialcita]] was tapped to direct the film; part of his job was also to convince the Cuneta household to allow Sharon to jump into acting.

Almers De Luna, a proud member of the group Sharon's Angels, revealed that the Cunetas asked for a P220,000-talent fee, which at the time was a staggering amount for a newcomer. To the disbelief of Sharon's parents, Sining Silangan agreed to pay the sum without reservation.<ref>http://www.pep.ph/spotlight/looking-back/15732/love-at-first-watch-the-magic-of-dear-heart-revisited/1/1#focus</ref>

Cuneta starred in her very first feature film entitled, ''"Dear Heart"''. She was paired with then Close-Up model and Regal Films' 80s hearthrob, [[Gabby Concepcion]]. '''Dear Heart''' made a killing in terms of blockbuster revenues. But more than the astronomical figures, the film significantly paved the way for the Sharon-Gabby love team mania that swept the <U+2018>80s.<ref>http://www.pep.ph/spotlight/looking-back/15732/love-at-first-watch-the-magic-of-dear-heart-revisited/1/2#focus</ref>

Due to the commercial success of ''"Dear Heart"'' and the team-up of Cuneta and Concepcion (which later on became one of the most successful screen team ups in Philippine movies), it demanded an immediate follow up. Since Sining Silangan didn't have the means to create an immediate follow up movie for Dear Heart, Pablo Cuneta collaborated with Vic Del Rosario, and established Viva Films.

On November 12, 1981, Viva Films released its very first feature film, "P.S. I Love You", still starring Cuneta and Concepcion. The movie became a huge box-office hit as well, which was also followed by another Sharon-Gabby starrer, "My Only Love", released on 1982. Her movies with Concepcion earned her the title, "Popular Teenage Queen of RP Movies" from the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation.<ref name="ReferenceB">http://www.goignition.com/sharon/megastar/movie05.html</ref>

Cuneta was also paired with other leading men, with the likes of [[William Martinez]] (in "Forgive and Forget"), [[Rowell Santiago]] (in "Cross My Heart" and "Friends In Love") and Miguel Rodriguez (in "To Love Again") from 1982 to 1983, which made her the Ms. RP Movies for the years mentioned.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Her early movie roles launched her as a "poor little rich girl". Although raised in an influential rich political family, she appealed to the sosyal (socially rich) and masa (poor masses) crowd of Philippine society, with her intelligence, humor and down-to-earth personality.

Aside from gracing the movies, Cuneta continued hosting with other teenage prodigies on the noon time show, Germspesyal, later called [[GMA Supershow]], with [[German Moreno]]. She also released hit albums such as "PS I Love You" (1981), "Sixteen" (1982) and "Sharon & Love" (1983).

She also recorded theme songs for Viva's heavy drama releases such as "Sinasamba Kita" (1982) and "Init Sa Magdamag" (1983).

===1984: Box-Office Queen and "Megastar"===

She paved her way to fame in the early 1980s as a young recording artist and eventually made it successful as a teen actress. Sharon was one of the top stars amongst her contemporaries together with [[Snooky Serna]], [[Maricel Soriano]] and [[Julie Vega]].

After playing "poor little rich girl" roles in her earlier movies, Viva Films decided to bring Cuneta to a wider variety of roles. After a year of hiatus in the movies, Cuneta was paired once again to Gabby Concepcion via the movie, "''Dapat Ka Bang Mahalin?''" which turned out to be a box office hit and led to the reconciliation of the couple after breaking up in 1982.

In July 1984, Cuneta took on a rags-to-riches role for the first time with the movie, "''Bukas, Luluhod And Mga Tala''". It was shown against the revolt film and [[Vilma Santos]] starrer, "''Sister Stella L''".<ref>http://www.philstar.com/pang-movies/2013/08/11/1078181/sharon-mas-kailangan-ang-pelikula-kesa-sa-tv-show</ref> "''Bukas, Luluhod..''" became a huge box office hit, beating the Santos' starrer, and eventually crowned Cuneta as 1984's Box Office Queen of RP Movies.<ref name="ReferenceC">http://www.goignition.com/sharon/index_megastar.html</ref>

Cuneta also staged a two-night sold-out major concert at the [[Araneta Coliseum]] entitled, "''Sharon Solo with the Boys''" on July 20 & 21, 1984 and was cited as the year's Most Outstanding Female Concert Hall Act by Aliw Awards.<ref>http://www.goignition.com/sharon/megastar/concert04.html</ref>

In September 23, 1984, Cuneta publicly married on-screen partner [[Gabby Concepcion]] at the [[Manila Cathedral]]. The ceremony was filmed and later on released as ''"The Best of Sharon & Gabby"'' on October the same year. It was followed by another Sharon-Gabby starrer entitled, ''"Sa Hirap at Ginhawa"'' the following month.<ref>http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/576993/wedding-everybody-thought-would-end-happily-ever-after</ref>

In 1985, a pet project of the late Mina Aragon-del Rosario, [[Bituing Walang Ningning]] was made into a motion picture by [[Viva Films]] starring Cuneta, [[Christopher de Leon]] and [[Cherie Gil]]. Back then one sure way to ensure great box-office returns was to adapt a komiks story to the screen. '''Bituin..''' was a big seller. Cuneta was then pregnant with [[KC Concepcion]], her first born with Concepcion. The movie was released on Valentine's Day, 1985. The movie was a huge box office success, crowning Cuneta once again as 1985's Box Office Queen of RP Movies and "Bida sa Takilya", the latter given at the 1986 [[FAMAS Awards]]. The monicker, "'''Megastar'''" was also given to her by the press during that year because of her continuous success in the box office<ref>http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/336675/remembering-bituing-walang-ningning</ref>

Cuneta was also recognized as 1984's Best Actress by [[FAMAS]] for her performance in "''Dapat Ka Bang Mahalin''" and by the [[Luna Awards|Film Academy of the Philippines]] for "''Sa Hirap at Ginhawa''".<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

In 1986, Cunets string of hit movies continued as she stars on three big blockbuster movies: "''Nakagapos Na Puso''" (with [[Lorna Tolentino]]), "''Captain Barbell''" (where she played a cameo role as [[Darna]]) and "''Sana'y Wala Nang Wakas''" (with Cherie Gil and [[Dina Bonnevie]]), the latter crowning her once again as 1986's Box Office Queen of RP Movies.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

===1987: Separation from Gabby Concepcion and ''Pasan Ko Ang Daigdig''===

In 1987, Cuneta starred in the comedy flick, ''Jack 'n Jill'', opposite [[Herbert Bautista]]. The movie spelled success in the box-office, which demanded a sequel the following year (''Jack 'n Jill Sa Amerika'').

On August 1987, after almost 3 years of marriage, Cuneta parted ways with then husband [[Gabby Concepcion]] due to irreconcilable differences and bigamy, as Concepcion was already married to a certain Jennifer Martin prior to his marriage with Cuneta.<ref name="spot.ph">http://www.spot.ph/entertainment/37924/top-10-couples-who-never-should-have-been</ref>

Cuneta also worked with National Artist for Film, [[Lino Brocka]], for the first time via the movie "[[Pasan Ko Ang Daigdig]]". The movie didn't fare well at the box office however it has earned Cuneta another Best Actress nomination from [[FAMAS]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

===1990-1995: Box-Office Hall of Fame===
Cuneta's reign as box-office queen even made stronger when she did movies with the popular action stars like [[Fernando Poe Jr.]] ''(Kahit Konting Pagtingin-1990)'' [[Robin Padilla]] '',(Maging Sino Ka Man-1991)'', [[Ramon 'Bong' Revilla Jr.]] ''(Pangako Sa 'Yo-1992)'', [[Rudy Fernandez (actor)|Rudy Fernandez]] ''(Kung Kailangan Mo Ako-1993)'' to name a few. All those movies were certified blockbusters, that though she was already elevated to Hall of Fame as Box-Office Queen in 1990, she was crowned again in 1991 through 1993 because of the success of her movies.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

Cuneta also reconciled with estranged husband, [[Gabby Concepcion]], in three more movies, "''Bakit Ikaw Pa Rin?''" (1990), "''[[Una Kang Naging Akin]]''" (1991) and "''Tayong Dalawa''" (1992), the latter giving her a grandslam Best Actress nomination from [[PMPC Star Awards for Movies]], [[FAMAS]], [[Film Academy of the Philippines]] and [[Gawad Urian]].<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

Even though Cuneta was not in the country, she remained in the limelight because of her many TV commercials that Filipinos were able to view everyday.

When she arrived in 1998 from a year of living in Boston, ABS-CBN produced a talk show for her comeback entitled ''Sharon''. The musical gab fest served as Cuneta's TV comeback after a year of hiatus from show business. The show would've had a successful six-year run becoming a top rating weekly program and clinched Best Talk Show honors and Best Talk Show Host accolades for Cuneta.

===2000s: Multi-media Megastar===

It revolves around a [[barangay]] chairwoman and her struggles in dividing her role as a mother and as a public official.<ref>http://entertainment.inquirer.net/117281/madam-chairman-makes-feisty-first-impression</ref>

==International success==
Cuneta is the first Filipina artist to sell out at the [[Los Angeles]] [[Shrine Auditorium]] first in 1988 and her latest June 11, 2005 concert. Her poster is included in The Shrine's Hall of Fame next to stars [[Michael Jackson]], [[Barbra Streisand]] and the [[Ballet Folklorico de Mexico]].

After hearing of her success, the mayor attended the concert and awarded Cuneta with an Honorary Key to the City of Los Angeles.

She sang a duet in the 2001 with [[Hong Kong]] star [[Andy Lau]], with whom she sang "In Your Eyes" composed by [[Jim Brickman]].

==Personal life==
Cuneta publicly married [[Gabby Concepcion]] on September 23, 1984, but got separated in 1987, and later on annulled in 1993 due to irreconcilable differences. Their wedding ceremony became the most attended nuptial in Philippine history, which was held at the [[Manila Cathedral]] Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, and was personally sponsored by [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and various high-ranking [[Roman Catholic]] prelates of the Republic of the Philippines. Together, they have a daughter, '''Maria Kristina Cassandra Cuneta Concepcion''' or better known as [[KC Concepcion]].

After her separation from Concepcion, Cuneta married [[Kiko Pangilinan]] on April 28, 1996. The two tied the knot in a very private ceremony , attended only by Pangilinan's siblings and principal sponsors Helen Gamboa and husband Tito Sotto III. According to Cuneta's mom Elaine Gamboa-Cuneta, the two had originally planned to hold the wedding at a hotel, but she insisted that they relocate it at her house since Sharon expressed that she didn't want a "circus" similar to her first wedding.<ref>http://www.spot.ph/entertainment/37493/the-10-most-talked-about-weddings-in-philippine-showbiz/4</ref>
