The '''501st Air Defense Group'''  is a disbanded [[United States Air Force]] organization. Its last assignment was with [[Air Defense Command]]'s (ADC) [[4706th Air Defense Wing]] at [[O'Hare International Airport]], Illinois. It was inactivated on 18 August 1955.

==History==
The group was established as the '''501st Air Service Group''' to provide support for flying units in Germany and Austria from 1945 to 1948 as part of a reorganization of Army Air Forces (AAF) support groups in which the [[Army Air Forces]] (AAF) replaced Service Groups that included personnel from other branches of the Army and supported two combat groups with Air Service Groups including only Air Corps units.  It was designed to support a single combat group.<ref name="coleman">Coleman, p. 208</ref>  Its 919th Air Engineering Squadron provided maintenance that was beyond the capability of the combat group, its 743rd Air Materiel Squadron handled all supply matters, and its Headquarters & Base Services Squadron provided other support.<ref name="coleman"/>    The group moved to [[Wiesbaden Air Base]], Germany, where it replaced the 97th Airdrome Squadron as the primary support element for the airfield.<ref>[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/102/826.xml| Abstract, History of 501st Air Service Group, Jan 1947]</ref>  It briefly supported the [[Berlin Airlift]] before inactivation in 1948.<ref>[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/102/843.xml| Abstract, History of 501st Air Service Group, Jun 1948]</ref>  It was replaced by elements of the 7150th AF Composite Wing in the Air Force Wing/Base reorganization (Hobson Plan) in 1948.<ref>[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/110/075.xml| Abstract, History of 7150th Composite Wing, Jul 1948]</ref>  It was disbanded later in 1948. <ref>Department of the Air Force Letter, 322 (AFOOR 887e), 8 October 1948, Subject: Disbandment of Certain Inactive Air Force Units</ref>

The group was reconstituted, redesignated as the '''501st Air Defense Group''', and activated by ADC at O'Hare International Airport on 16 February 1953<ref name=cj82>Cornett, & Johnson, p.82</ref> with responsibility for air defense of the Great Lakes area.{{Citation needed|need support for area of responsibility|date=April 2012}}  It was assigned the [[62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] (FIS), which was already stationed at O'Hare, flying [[F-86 Sabre]]s<ref>Cornett & Johnson, p.117</ref> as its operational component.<ref name="m cs239">Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p.239</ref>  The 62d FIS had been assigned directly to the 4706th Defense Wing.<ref name="m cs239"/>  The group replaced the 83rd Air Base Squadron as USAF active duty host organization at O'Hare IAP.  It was assigned three squadrons to perform its support responsibilities.

The group added the [[42d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]], which was activated at O'Hare eight days later,<ref>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p.195</ref> and also Flew F-86s. <ref name="cj115">Cornett & Johnson, p.115</ref>  In March 1953, the 62d FIS converted to a newer radar equipped model F-86.<ref name="cj115"/>    The group was inactivated<ref name=cj82/> and replaced by the [[56th Fighter Group]] in 1955<ref>Maurer, ''Combat Units'' p. 119</ref> as part of ADC's Project Arrow, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars.<ref>Buss, Sturm, Volan, & McMullen, p.6</ref>  The group was disbanded again in 1984.<ref>Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 575q, 27 Sep 1984, Subject: Disbandment of Units</ref>
