It is the second film in the popular ''[[Munna Bhai]]'' series of [[Bollywood]]. [[Sanjay Dutt]] stars in this film as ''[[Munna Bhai]]'', a [[Mumbai]] (Bombay) underworld don, who begins to see the spirit of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Through his interactions with the image of Gandhi, Munna Bhai begins to practice what he calls ''[[Gandhigiri]]'' ([[Satyagraha]], [[Mahatma Gandhi#Gandhi.27s principles|non-violence, and truth]]) to help ordinary people solve their problems. His [[sidekick]], [[Circuit (film character)|Circuit]], is portrayed by [[Arshad Warsi]].

''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' has had a strong cultural impact in India, popularising ''[[Gandhism]]''  under Munna Bhai's notion of ''Gandhigiri''.<ref name=mridulatoi060929>{{cite news | first=Mridula| last=Chunduri| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2038291.cms| title= Gandhigiri, a cool way to live| work=timesofindia.com|publisher=Times Internet Limited| date=[[2006-09-29]]| accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref><ref name=Sharmaboston>{{cite news | first=Swati Gauri| last=Sharma| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/10/13/how_gandhi_got_his_mojo_back/| title=How Gandhi got his mojo back| work=boston.com|publisher=The New York Times Company |date=[[13 October]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-10-13}}</ref> As noted by critics,<ref name=Sharmaboston/><ref name=shastritribune>{{cite news | first=Shastri | last=Ramachandaran| url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060923/edit.htm#4| title=Jollygood Bollywood:Munnabhai rescues Mahatma| work=tribuneindia.com|publisher=The Tribune Trust| date=[[23 September]] [[2006]]| accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref> the film has "stirred the popular imagination", leading to a number of ''Gandhigiri'' protests in India and in the [[United States]]: "For generations born after Gandhi<U+2019>s assassination, [[Munna Bhai|Munnabhai]], the [[eponymous]] hero of the film, has rendered <U+201C>[[Gandhism]]<U+201D> pass<U+00E9> and <U+201C>[[Gandhian]]<U+201D> arcane.

== Plot ==

The central [[protagonist]], [[Munna Bhai]] ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), interacts with an image of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and learns the principles of [[Gandhian]] philosophy in ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai.'' He is helped by his [[sidekick]],  [[Circuit (film character)|Circuit]] ([[Arshad Warsi]]). They both speak in [[Bambaiya Hindi]], a [[dialect]] specific to the Indian city of [[Mumbai]].

Munna is in love with the voice of Jhanvi ([[Vidya Balan]]), a [[radio jockey]]. He devises a plan to meet her when she announces a contest on the life and beliefs of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] set for [[2 October]]<U+2014>''[[Gandhi Jayanti]]'', a [[Public holidays in India|national holiday]] celebrating the birth of Gandhi. Circuit helps Munna win the contest by kidnapping and then bribing a group of professors. As the winner, Munna is granted an interview with Jhanvi where he lies to her, presenting himself as a professor of [[History of India|history]] and a Gandhi specialist. Jhanvi subsequently asks Munna to present a lecture on Gandhi to a community of [[senior citizen]]s who live in her home, called the ''"Second Innings House"''. In order to prepare for this event, Munna engages in a period of intense study of the life and works of Gandhi. 

[[Image:Gandhi studio 1931.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] in 1931.]]
It is during this period that the image of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] (portrayed by [[Dilip Prabhavalkar]]), referred to by his nickname, "[[Bapu]]", or "father", appears offering help and advice to Munna. He also encourages Munna to tell the truth about himself to Jhanvi. Indeed, Gandhi continues to appear each time Munna sings ''[[Raghupathi Raghava Rajaram]]'' (a song often sung in Gandhi's memory). With Gandhi's help, Munna succeeds in impressing Jhanvi and cultivates a new life based upon [[Gandhism]] (particularly [[Mahatma Gandhi#Gandhi.27s principles|non-violence and truth]]) which transforms everyone with whom he comes into contact. Indeed, Munna starts to co-host a radio-show with Jhanvi and Gandhi's spirit, guiding his audience to use ''[[Gandhigiri]]'' (a [[neologism]] for [[Gandhism]]) to solve everyday problems. 

Several [[subplot]]s in the film highlight the power of ''Gandhigiri''. One of the most prominent of these details the story of Lucky Singh ([[Boman Irani]]) and his daughter Simran ([[Dia Mirza]]). Lucky is an unscrupulous [[businessman]] who employs Circuit and Munna Bhai to conduct "[[Mumbai underworld|underworld]]" activities for him. His daughter, Simran, is engaged to marry Sunny ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]), the son of a powerful businessman, Kkhurana ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]). Kkhurana, however, is [[superstitious]] and his activities are controlled by his [[astrologer]], Batuk Maharaj ([[Saurabh Shukla]]). Maharaj's particular use of [[numerology]] led Kkhurana to add an extra "K" to his real name (Khurana) as well as to the conclusion that the ''"Second Innings House"'' would be the most auspicious place for Sunny and Simran to live. Maharaj also convinces Kkhurana to reject the marriage between Simran and Sunny when it is revealed that Simran is considered to be a ''[[Mangal Dosha|manglik]]'' (an individual whose [[Jyotisha|Vedic astrological]] makeup is believed by some to be devastating for marriage).

After Lucky appropriates ''"Second Innings House"'' through unethical means, Munna launches a "non-violent" protest called "Get Well Soon, Lucky" in which he asks his radio-show audience to send Lucky flowers to help him recover from the "disease of dishonesty". Munna, along with Circuit, Jhanvi and the senior citizens of ''"Second Innings House"'', begin a peaceful ''[[satyagraha]]'' in front of Lucky's house. It is during this time that Munna decides to tell Jhanvi the truth (via a letter he gives to her). Heartbroken, Jhanvi leaves Munna. Munna receives another setback when he is tricked by Lucky into revealing his conversations with Gandhi before a public audience (which serves as proof for a psychiatrist in the audience that Munna is delusional; Gandhi's monologue at the end of the film, however, questions this conclusion). Munna, unperturbed by the setbacks in his life, however, continues to use ''Gandhigiri'', a decision which transforms Lucky, brings Jhanvi back to him, and resolves Simran's marriage.

Additional subplots include the story of Victor D'Souza ([[Jimmy Shergill]]) who, having lost his father's ([[Parikshat Sahni]]) money in stock market, promises to earn back the money as a taxi driver. Another includes the story of a retired teacher who, having been denied his pension, offers everything he owns to the corrupt official in the pension office. 

In this manner, the application of Gandhi's concept of [[satyagraha]] (non-violence) to day-to-day modern life (and thus the revival of Gandhi's "spirit") becomes the central thematic issue of the film. The film also tackles issues related to [[social justice]] such as the impact of [[astrology]] and [[numerology]] on daily life.

Film Director and [[screenwriter]] [[Rajkumar Hirani]] admitted in an interview that he felt the burden of expectation   while writing the screenplay for ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' as he had to create "something to match" the first film.<ref name=rediff010906>{{cite news |url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2006/sep/01hirani1.htm| title=Munna and Circuit are divine fools'| work=rediff.com|publisher= Rediff.com India Limited| date=[[1 September]] 2006|accessdate=2007-01-18}}</ref> Initially there was some effort to incorporate scenes or particulars of the first film into the sequel (such as the idiosyncratic laugh of Dr. Asthana, portrayed by [[Boman Irani]]), but the risks of repetition were then consciously averted.<ref name=rediff010906/> 

One of Hirani's goals in making the film was to revive an interest in [[Mahatma Gandhi]], a figure whom he felt had been forgotten in contemporary India. To highlight this fact, Hirani recounted (during an interview) an incident with a ''[[chai]]-[[Wala|wallah]]'' boy (a boy who brings tea to the crew) during production:

{{cquote|The boy was curious, he was a big [[Munna Bhai|Munnabhai]] fan and kept asking the name of the film. The first working title was 'Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi,' and Shantanu (Moitra, the music director) told him. So he said, 'Munnabhai to theek hai, yeh Mahatma Gandhi kaun hai?' ('Munnabhai is fine, but who is this Mahatma Gandhi?') So this is the sad state of affairs today. I was shocked. And it's not just the chai-wallah. A few days ago on TV a lot of politicians were asked India-related questions on the news channels, and I can't believe a lot of them don't know [[October 2]] is [[Gandhi Jayanti|Gandhiji's birthday]]! Many didn't know his first name. They kept saying, 'what's in a name, we respect his ideals,' but come on! How can you not know his name?<ref name=rediff040906>{{cite news |  url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2006/sep/04hirani.htm| title=Lage Raho will make you laugh with moist eyes| work=rediff.com| publisher=Rediff.com India Limited|date=[[September 4]] [[2006]]| accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>}}

The other screenwriter, [[Abhijat Joshi]] (who teaches in the department of English at [[Otterbein College]] in [[Westerville, Ohio]]) stated that he had been conducting extensive research on Gandhi for some time,<ref name=joshirediff0926>{{cite news

While writing the screenplay, Hirani and Joshi stayed together for more than four months. They developed scenes by going out for a walk and discussing the scene. They would not return home until they had created a scene that would make them laugh, or cry, or had some provocative thought.<ref name=joshirediff0926/> While there was a shortage of resources during the shooting of ''Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.'', the crew did not encounter a financial crisis during the filming of ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai,'' as the team managed to receive whatever was deemed necessary (including a Jimmy Jib, a specific kind of camera crane, just for a single [[crane shot]]).<ref name=rediff010906/> The film was shot on location in and around [[Mumbai]], with [[Goa]] as a backdrop for the filming of a song.<ref name=rediff010906/> 

Only two characters<U+2014>those of [[Munna Bhai]] (portrayed by [[Sanjay Dutt]]) and [[Circuit (film character)|Circuit]] (portrayed by [[Arshad Warsi]])<U+2014>were retained from ''Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.''

The actors used several techniques to develop their characters. Arshad Warsi ("[[Circuit (film character)|Circuit]]") encountered some initial problems reviving his character from the first film. On the first day of the shoot when Arshad, "said his first line, he didn't sound like Circuit at all. He sounded like Arshad Warsi speaking with an accent".<ref name=yahoomovies020806/> Warsi admits that he had "forgotten" the character of Circuit and had to watch the DVD of ''Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.'' three times before being able to film the scene in the correct way.<ref name=yahoomovies020806/> Sanjay Dutt ("[[Munna Bhai]]") also confessed that he had to watch the first film eight to nine times in order to recapture the "persona" of Munna Bhai.<ref name=yahoomovies020806/> In addition, Dutt stated in an interview that he did not read Gandhi's autobiography ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|My Experiments with Truth]]'' as a preparation for ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai''. Rather, he comments, both his father, [[Sunil Dutt]] (who portrays Munna Bhai's father in the first film, ''Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.'') and his mother (the late actress [[Nargis]]) were his role models as they "were basically Gandhians.

==Influences and allusions==
[[Image:Munnaradio.jpg|thumb|Jhanvi (with [[Munna Bhai]]) delivering her trademark ''"Gooooooood Moooooooorninnnng Mumbai!"'']]
Rather than follow the traditional [[sequel]] format, each film in the ''[[Munna Bhai series]]'' features Munna and Circuit in a story which is comprehensive unto itself and is not continued or referred to in another film in the series. Indeed, director [[Rajkumar Hirani]] has  compared this format to the films of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]], as well as to the ''[[James Bond]]'' series.<ref name=rediff010906/> Others have also likened the series to the work of Laurel and Hardy.<ref>{{cite news | first=Sangeetha K.| last=Devi| url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006090103120100.htm&date=2006/09/01/&prd=fr&| title=  Our answer to Laurel and Hardy?| work=hinduonnet.com|publisher=The Hindu| date= [[September 1]] 2006| accessdate=2006-10-06}}</ref> Some, however, have negated this comparison, stating that the series is more akin to the ''[[Road to...]]'' "buddy films" of [[Bob Hope]] and [[Bing Crosby]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Piroj| last=Wadia| url=http://www.screenindia.com/fullstory.php?content_id=13698| title=Carry on with Munnabhai| work=screenindia.com|publisher=Indian Express Newspapers (Mumbai) Ltd| date=[[October 6]] 2006| accessdate=2006-10-06}}</ref> Director Rajkumar Hirani admitted that his work was deeply inspired by the films of [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]].<ref name=rediff040906/>

Cinematic works by [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]] (such as ''[[Parineeta (2005 film)|Parineeta]]'') often contain [[allusion]]s to other important films and works of music or literature. In ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai,'' Jhanvi's  opening line for her radio show, "Gooooooood Moooooooorninnnng Mumbai!", resembles [[Robin Williams]]' opening for his radio show ("Gooooooooood morning, Vietnaaaaaaaaammm!") in the 1987 film, ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam#Quotes|Good Morning, Vietnam]]''.<ref>{{cite news | first=Anthony| last=Mili| url=http://www.helium.com/tm/199266| title= Movie reviews: Lage Raho Munna Bhai| work=helium.com| publisher=helium.com|accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref><ref name=dnakhalid>{{cite news | first=Khalid| last=Mohamed| url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1050758&pageid=2| title= 'Lage Raho Munnabhai' is terrific!| work=dnaindia.com| publisher=Diligent Media Corporation Ltd|date=[[2 September]] [[2006]]| accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> Critics have also noted similarity with the 1977 film ''[[Oh, God!]]'' where God appears as a kindly old man to the protagonist.<ref name=dnakhalid/> In addition, parts of the [[melody]] of the song "Pal Pal...Har Pal" are reminiscent of the [[Cliff Richard]] song "Theme for a Dream".<ref name="Smashits music">{{cite news | author=Satyajit - Eye TV India Bureau | url=http://ww.smashits.com/news/bollywood/music-review/5677/lage-raho-munna-bhai.html| title=Music Review of Lage Raho Munnabhai | publisher=smashits.com| accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref>

===Reviews and critiques===
''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' has received high praise from many critics<ref name=rediff040906/> particularly Poonam Joshi of the ''[[BBC]]'' who notes that "everything about this film works [...] It's rare to see a film that bounces between humour and sentiment so seamlessly. And it is rarer still to see characters become etched in the memory so enduringly that audiences become almost protective of them. It's testimony both to the quality of the writing and the performances, that Munna and Circuit have taken on a life of their own."<ref>{{cite news | first=Poonam| last=Joshi| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/08/29/lage_raho_munna_bhai_2006_review.shtml| title=Review:Lage Raho Munna Bhai| work=bbc.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC]]| date=[[29 August]] [[2006]]| accessdate=2006-12-10}}</ref>  Phelim O'Neill of the ''[[The Guardian]]'' supports this view stating, "as western romantic comedies become more vapid and even stalkerish, this delivers a credible message of peace, while never forgetting to be magnificent entertainment."<ref>{{cite news | first=Phelim| last=O'Neill| url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1862152,00.html| title=Review:Lage Raho Munna Bhai| work=guardian.co.uk|publisher= Guardian News and Media Limited | date=[[1 September]] [[2006]]| accessdate=2006-12-10}}</ref>  Nikhat Kazmi of ''[[The Times of India]]'' also observes that "Vidhu Vinod Chopra gives the great Indian family one more let's-go-goodwill-hunting entertainer, even as director Raju Hirani proves that sequels needn't have the been there-done that feel..."<ref>{{cite news | first=Nikhat| last=Kazmi| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1949085,prtpage-1.cms| title=Review: Lage Raho Munna...| work=timesofindia.com|publisher=Times Internet Limited| date=[[2 September]] [[2006]]| accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref> Furthermore Sparn Verma of ''[[Rediff.com]]'' adds that "we live in a cynical world, but even in such times, sometimes a person, book or film comes along and shows you a tiny crack in the wall behind which there is a lot of light, and suddenly your heart is full of happiness.

==Social and cultural impact==
{{see also|Gandhigiri}}

===Overview===
The decision to include [[Mahatma Gandhi]]  as a central character in the film  introduces, through his interactions with [[Munna Bhai]], important thematic concepts and ideas that draw upon the period of [[Colonial India]] and the [[Indian independence movement]]. Gandhi was a leader in this movement, challenging the occupation of [[British India|India]] by the [[British Empire]] through the use of  ''[[Satyagraha]]'' (non-violence). In this context, Jhanvi and Munna Bhai's non-violent protest against Lucky Singh serves as a [[metaphor]] for the Indian Independence movement and the battle against the [[British Raj]].
[[Image:OddGandhigiriAdvChennai.jpg|thumb|"Do [[Gandhigiri]]" advertisement]]
The thematic attention to Gandhi's theories in ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' has both revived an interest in ''[[Gandhism]]'' under the new term, ''[[Gandhigiri]]'' in [[India]]<ref name=mridulatoi060929/>  and has likewise "made Gandhi suddenly hip.

Theories for this sudden revival vary.

===Gandhigiri-style protests===
[[Image:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|200px|Gandhi leading [[Salt Satyagraha]], a notable example of [[Satyagraha]]]] 
Since the release of the film, there have been a number of [[Gandhigiri]] - style protests.  In the [[United States]] during [[July 2007]], piles of flowers were sent to the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] office by individuals who were legally in the U.S. but caught in a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] backlog. This was an act of [[Gandhigiri]] (or [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] protest) copied from ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai''. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/gandhigiri-works-magic-for-indians-seeking-green-card/45233-2-7.html| title=Gandhigiri works magic for Indians seeking green card| work=[[CNN IBN]]|publisher=[[CNN IBN]] |date=[[19 July]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref> There have been positive reactions to this event. The USCIS shipped the flowers to the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] and Bethesda Naval hospitals. A [[15 July]] [[2007]] editorial in ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' argued, "let's hope their protest gets results <U+2013> because Americans are fortunate to have living among them people who are this ingenious, and this thoughtful of others, and this capable of channeling anger into beauty." <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/bal-ed.flowers15jul15,0,5046454.story?coll=bal-opinion-headlines| title=Flower power| publisher=[[Baltimore Sun]]| date=[[15 July]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-07-15}}{{dead link|date=August 2007}}</ref> 

The filmmakers also issued responses to this event. Producer [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]] stated that, "[[Mahatma Gandhi]] has influenced several personalities, including [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American Civil Rights Leader]] [[Martin Luther King, Jr]]. These young, law-abiding professionals have set out to strive for reform the right way <U+2013> the [[Gandhigiri]] way." In addition, Director [[Rajkumar Hirani]] also noted that "when you feel you have been wronged, you feel angry. The best way to overcome what you think is unjust, is to protest peacefully. Be nice to your opponent and let him see your point of view. My well-wishes go out to these educated, highly-skilled professionals who have abided by the law and have been eagerly waiting in line for their green cards for nearly ten years."<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.glamsham.com/movies/features/07/jul/11_boman_irani_gandhigiri_isn_t_easy_but_works_in_the_long_run.asp| title=Boman Irani- Gandhigiri isn<U+2019>t easy, but works in the long run| work=|publisher=glamsham.com| date=[[11 July]] [[2007]]|accessdate=}}</ref>, <ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.bollyvista.com/article/a/32/7823| title=Gandhigiri wave in USA| work=|publisher=bollyvista.com| date=[[15 July]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-07-15}}</ref> 

On [[17 July]], the USCIS announced that "it will accept applications from foreign professionals seeking permanent residency through an expedited process, reversing its earlier decision." USCIS Director, [[Emilio T. Gonzalez]] noted of the [[Gandhigiri]] protest, "The public reaction to the July 2 announcement made it clear that the federal government's management of this process needs further review [...] I am committed to working with Congress and the State Department to implement a more efficient system in line with public expectations." <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/gandhigiri-works-green-card-seekers-make-us-change-heart/45183-2.html| title='Gandhigiri works!
