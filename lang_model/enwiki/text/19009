'''Parris Nelson Glendening''' (born June 11, 1942), a member of the [[United States Democratic Party]], was the [[List of Governors of Maryland|59th]] [[Governor of Maryland]] from 1995 to 2003. He had also been the [[List of Prince George's County Executives|County Executive]] of [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] from 1982 to 1994.

==Early life and career==
Glendening was born and raised a [[Roman Catholic]] in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]], but later in his youth moved to the state of [[Florida]].  Growing up in poverty, Glendening sought a scholarship to [[Broward Community College]]. Other financial aid later enabled him to attend the [[Florida State University]], where he received a [[bachelor's degree]] (1964), a [[master's degree]] (1965), and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (1967), becoming the youngest student in FSU history to receive a doctorate in [[political science]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fsu.edu/~fstime/FS-Times/Volume4/feb99web/7feb99.html |title=FSU LAUNCHED AN EDUCATION GOVERNOR |accessdate=2007-08-07 |last=Peck |first=Dana |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=1999 |month=February March |format= |work= |publisher=Florida State Times |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=In 1967, at the age of 25, Glendening became the youngest student to receive a Ph.D. in political science at FSU. }}</ref> When he graduated he taught Government and Politics as a professor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] for 27 years. In 1977, he co-authored ''Pragmatic Federalism: An Intergovernmental View of American Government'' with Mavis Mann Reeves.<!--the official Maryland land bio incorrectly states that he wrote it in 1984-->

Glendening's career in public service began in 1973 as a [[city council]]man in the town of [[Hyattsville, Maryland]]. He was elected to the county council of Prince George's County, Maryland in 1974 and twice served as the council chairman. In 1982, he was elected as the County Executive of Prince George's County, and was the first county executive in [[Maryland]] history to be elected to three terms (1982<U+2013>94). Under Glendening's leadership, Prince George's County was selected as an "All America County" by the [[National Civic League]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.org/aac/past_winners/past_winners_state.html |title=All-America City: Past Winners |accessdate=2007-08-06 |format= |work= |quote="Prince George's County, 1986-87"}}</ref> and ''City and State Magazine'' named him the "Most Valuable County Official" in the nation.

Glendening had a brother, Bruce, who died of [[AIDS]] in 1992.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel|last=LeDuc |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Gov.'s Gay Rights Bid Has Family Ties |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/mdleg/glendening9.htm |format= |work= |publisher=Washington Post  |id= |pages= |page= |date=1999-03-09 |accessdate=2007-07-06 |language= |quote=}}</ref>

==Governor of Maryland==
In 1994, Glendening was elected to his first term as [[Governor of Maryland]], edging out [[Ellen Sauerbrey]] by only 5993 votes in a state that is overwhelmingly Democratic. The victory was disputed, and the result was challenged in court. The court refused to overturn Glendening's tentative win, and Glendening became the first Maryland governor elected from the [[Washington, D.C.]] region in over 100 years. In 1998, Governor Glendening won re-election to a second term by a solid but not overwhelming margin&mdash;again beating Sauerbrey, who announced she would make no further runs for the office.

Glendening came into office amid missteps and minor scandals stemming from his tenure as County Executive of Prince George's County. His approval rating was as low as 18% in the spring of 1995. His early administration was marked by tax reform. From 1994 to 1998, he cut or lowered over 50 Maryland taxes, including the state income tax. In addition, Glendening was the sitting governor when the [[Washington Redskins]] (who play in [[Landover, Maryland|Landover]]) and the [[Baltimore Ravens]] arrived in the state, though he was not directly responsible for either move.

During Glendening's second term, serious environmental issues concerning the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the overdevelopment of rural areas prompted him to focus on issues of growth and environmental stewardship. Glendening is widely recognized as a pioneer in land development issues{{Fact|date=April 2009}} and is credited{{Fact|date=April 2009}} for coining the phrase "[[Smart Growth]]."

The final years of his second term as Governor were plagued by a marital crisis (see below) and a $2 billion state [[budget deficit]]. The rural areas of Maryland&mdash;largely Republican&mdash;had long criticized Glendening for what they perceived as overzealous [[environmental regulation]]s as well as ignoring their budgetary needs (bridges, highways, etc.).

Governor Glendening halted [[capital punishment|executions]] in Maryland by an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] on May 9, 2002, but the subsequent governor, [[Robert Ehrlich]] (R), resumed executions in 2004. (See [[Capital punishment in Maryland]].)

In 1995, Glendening declared that he would render any individual serving a [[life sentence]] ineligible for executive [[clemency]] unless they were seriously ill or near death. This policy, termed "life means life," was heavily criticized, and it was abandoned by Glendening's successor, Robert Ehrlich, who created a new policy in which there would be case-by-case judgments.

On January 25, 2002, Glendening divorced his wife and married one of his deputy chiefs of staff, [[Jennifer Crawford Glendening|Jennifer Crawford]], making her Glendening's third wife. Crawford was 35 at the time, considerably younger than the then-59-year-old Glendening, and she was pregnant at the time of their wedding. She gave birth to a baby girl, Gabrielle, on August 18, marking the first time since 1879 that a Maryland governor had a baby born during his term of office.

Glendening was determined by a number of pollsters during his second term to be the least popular governor in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=5810 |title=Governor Glendening Gets a C on His Report Card |accessdate=2008-01-21 |last=Moore |first=Stephen |coauthors=Dean Stansel |date=1998-09-29 |work=cato.org |publisher=[[Cato Institute]]}}</ref>

==2002 Gubernatorial election==
During the 2002 [[Election Results, Maryland governor|Maryland governor election]], Glendening was not eligible to run due to the state constitutional term limit. His lieutenant governor, [[Kathleen Kennedy Townsend]], was nominated by the Democrats to run. Townsend was damaged during the election due to wide criticism by rural voters, especially [[farmer]]s, directed at Glendening for what they considered overzealous environmental legislation that significantly raised the cost of participating in [[agribusiness]].

Townsend lost the election 48% to 52% to the Republican [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] Robert Ehrlich. The Republicans relied in large part on rural counties and low minority turnout&mdash;due to Townsend's unpopular choice for her lieutenant governor, a retired white Admiral, [[Charles R. Larson]], who had changed parties only weeks before&mdash;for Ehrlich to achieve his victory in November 2002, taking office in January 2003. Townsend's pick of Larson, which she made without consulting the influential black Democratic leaders in the state (which is nearly one-third black), was a point of controversy in the campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/05/elec02.md.g.hotrace/index.html |title=Ehrlich wins in Maryland's governor's race |accessdate=2008-01-21 |date=2002-11-02 |work=Inside Politics |publisher=CNN }}</ref>

Not only did Townsend lose the race for governor, but Glendening's hand-picked candidate for the comptroller, John T. Willis, lost to the incumbent, a Glendening nemesis and former two-term Governor [[William Donald Schaefer]], in the Democratic primaries.

In spite of the possibility that his own unpopularity may have harmed Townsend's own gubernatorial bid, Glendening made a harsh comment regarding his Lieutenant Governor's campaign, calling it "one of the worst-run campaigns in the country." This comment may have contributed to a rupture in the personal relationship between the two Maryland leaders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-te.md.partners26nov26,0,836237,full.story?coll=bal-home-headlines |title=For this pair, the talking is over |accessdate=2008-01-21 |last=Koenig |first=Sarah |date=2002-11-26 |publisher=The Baltimore Sun }}</ref>

 }}</ref> and he largely stayed out of the limelight. He and his successor, Robert Ehrlich, informally agreed not to criticize one another. Glendening quietly continued his advocacy work for Smart Growth.

Glendening broke his 3.5-year silence in late August 2006, when he endorsed [[Kweisi Mfume]] for the [[U.S. Senate]]. (Mfume eventually lost the Democratic primary to Congressman [[Ben Cardin]], who went on to win the Senate seat.)<ref>{{cite news
