During the announcing of the iPhone 3G, a new design was unveiled. A glossy plastic back replaced the aluminum back of the original model, and the 16GB model came in black and white. The buttons were also made from plastic to metal. The edges of the phone are also tapered, providing a better grip of the phone.

The dimensions of the iPhone 3G were an improvement over the original iPhone. It was {{convert|4.55|in|mm}} high, {{convert|2.44|in|mm}} wide, and {{convert|0.48|in|mm}} deep, compared to its predecessor, which was {{convert|4.5|in|mm}} high, {{convert|2.4|in|mm}} wide, and {{convert|0.46|in|mm}} deep.

== Features ==
Most of the iPhone 3G's internal components were based on its predecessor, the [[iPhone (original)|iPhone]]. It included a [[Samsung]] [[32-bit]] [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[ARM architecture|ARM]] 620 MHz processor (undercolocked to 412Mhz), a [[PowerVR]] [[PowerVR#MBX|MBX]] Lite 3D [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], and an 128 MB [[eDRAM]].

The improvements to the iPhone 3G were the addition of [[Assisted GPS]] and [[Tri-band UMTS/HSDPA]]. The [[iPhone OS]] 2.0 software with [[App Store]] was included standard. Enterprise support was also added.

The iPhone 3G introduced colors to the iPhone. The 16GB model was available in white and black, while the 8GB model was available only in black.

== Issues ==
A complaint about the iPhone 3G is the durability of its revamped plastic back. Many users reported that the backs of the iPhone suffered hairline cracks, mainly on the white models. <ref>http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/07/30/question-is-your-white-iphone-cracking/</ref>

[[IOS_(Apple)|iOS 4]] was released on June 21, 2010.  Since its release many 3G owners have reported that their phones are performing much slower than they had prior to the update.<ref>http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2500077&tstart=0</ref><ref>http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2475859&tstart=0</ref>  Video comparisons of the performance differences have been posted.<ref>http://www.flickr.com/photos/adriannier/4724180371</ref>
