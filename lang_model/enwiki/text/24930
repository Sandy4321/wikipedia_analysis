The circumstances of his death have long been in question, with some disputing whether he died while in Soviet detention.

Wallenberg has been honored numerous times. He is an honorary citizen of  [[Honorary Canadian citizenship|Canada]], [[Hungary]], [[Israel]] and the [[Honorary citizen of the United States|United States]]. Israel has also designated Wallenberg one of the [[Righteous among the Nations]]. Monuments have been dedicated to him, and streets have been named after him throughout the world. A [[The Raoul Wallenberg Committee of the United States|Raoul Wallenberg Committee of the United States]] was created in 1981 to "perpetuate the humanitarian ideals and the nonviolent courage of Raoul Wallenberg".  It gives the [[Raoul Wallenberg Award]] annually to recognize persons who carry out those goals. 

== Early life ==
[[Image:Raoul Wallenberg young.jpg|right|thumb|Wallenberg as a boy]]
Wallenberg was born in 1912 in Kappsta, [[Liding<U+00F6> Municipality|Liding<U+00F6>]] (near [[Stockholm]]) where his maternal grandparents, professor Per Johan Wising and his wife Sophie Wising, had built a summer house in 1882. His paternal grandfather, Gustaf Wallenberg, was a diplomat and envoy to Tokyo, Istanbul, and Sofia.

His parents, who married in 1911, were Raoul Oscar Wallenberg (1888<U+2013>1912), a Swedish naval officer who died of cancer three months before his son was born, and Maria "Maj" Sofia Wising (1891<U+2013>1979). In 1918, his mother married Fredrik von Dardel (d. 1979)[http://www.raoul-wallenberg.eu/researcher/dardel/]; they had a son, [[Guy von Dardel]],<ref name="profdardel"/> and a daughter, Nina Lagergren 

In 1931, Wallenberg went to study architecture at the [[University of Michigan]] in the [[United States]]. In college, he learned to speak [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]].<ref name=TWS>{{cite web |first=Penny |last=Schreiber |url=http://www.wallenberg.umich.edu/college.html |title=The Wallenberg Story |accessdate=2007-02-14}}</ref> He used his vacations to explore the United States.  Although the [[Wallenberg family]] was wealthy, he worked at odd jobs in his free time.  He joined other young men students as a passenger rickshaw handler at the 1933 Century of Progress [[Expo (exhibition)|World's Fair]] in Chicago[http://www.raoul-wallenberg.eu/background/3%C2%A0-raoul-wallenberg-university-and-training/].

On his return to Sweden, he found his American degree did not qualify him to practice as an architect. Eventually, his grandfather arranged a job for him in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], in the office of a Swedish company that sold construction material.<ref name=JVL/> Between 1935 and 1936, Wallenberg was employed in a minor position at a branch office of the Holland Bank in [[Haifa]].<ref name=JVL/> He returned to Sweden in 1936 and obtained a job in Stockholm with the help of his uncle and godfather, Jacob Wallenberg, at the Central European Trading Company,<ref>The company name is sometimes translated as the "Mid-European Trading Company"</ref> an export-import company trading between Stockholm and central Europe, owned by K<U+00E1>lm<U+00E1>n Lauer, a Hungarian Jew.

== Working in Hungary ==
{{seealso|History of the Jews in Hungary}}
In 1938, [[Hungary]], under the regency of [[Mikl<U+00F3>s Horthy]], passed a series of anti-Jewish measures restricting professions, reducing the number of Jews in government jobs, and prohibiting intermarriage. Lauer found it increasingly difficult to travel to Hungary, and Wallenberg became his trusted representative. Wallenberg soon learned Hungarian, and from 1941 made frequent travels to [[Budapest]].<ref name=NYT03301980>Lester, Elenore and Werbell, Frederick E.; "The Last Hero of Holocaust. The Search for Sweden's Raoul Wallenberg"], ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''; March 30, 1980, ; Retrieved on February 14, 2007</ref> Within a year, Wallenberg was a joint owner and the International Director of the company.<ref name=JVL/>

In April and May 1944, although the loss of the war was a foregone conclusion, the Germans and their Hungarian accomplices began the mass deportation of Hungarian Jews, at the rate of 12,000 per day.<ref>[http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/StaticPages/526.html The Holocaust Chronicle PROLOGUE: Roots of the Holocaust, page 526<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The persecution of the Jews in Hungary soon became well known abroad, unlike the full extent of the Holocaust. In late spring 1944, [[George Mantello]] publicized what is now called the ''[[Vrba-Wetzler report|Wetzler-Vrba Report]]''. World leaders Churchill, Roosevelt and others worked to assist Horthy in stopping the deportations.<ref>[[Winston Churchill]], in a letter to his Foreign Secretary dated July 11, 1944, wrote, "There is no doubt that this persecution of Jews in Hungary and their expulsion from enemy territory is probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed in the whole history of the world...."

In spring 1944, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent [[Iver Olsen]] to Stockholm as an official representative of the [[War Refugee Board|American War Refugee Board]]. He was looking for someone willing and able to go to Budapest to organize a rescue program for the Jews.<ref name=USHMM> United States Holocaust Memorial Museum; [http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/index.php?ModuleId=10005143 Holocaust Encyclopedia]; Retrieved on January 27, 2007</ref>  Olsen believed that Wallenberg was the right man.<ref name=TWS/>

== Diplomat in Budapest ==
On August 10, 1944, Wallenberg traveled to Budapest as the First Secretary to the Swedish legation in Budapest. Together with fellow Swedish diplomat [[Per Anger]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Ilya |last= Garger|authorlink= |title= Milestones: Died. Per Anger.|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501020909-346286,00.html|work= |publisher= [[Time (magazine)]]|date=September 2, 2002 |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> he issued "protective passports" (German: ''Schutz-Pass''), which identified the bearers as Swedish subjects awaiting repatriation and thus prevented their deportation. Although not legal, these documents looked official and were generally accepted by German and Hungarian authorities, who sometimes were also bribed.<ref name=NYT03301980/> The Swedish legation in Budapest also succeeded in negotiating with the Germans so that the bearers of the protective passes would be treated as Swedish citizens and be exempt from having to wear the [[yellow badge]] required for Jews.<ref name=JVL/>

With the money raised by the board, Wallenberg rented 32 buildings in Budapest and declared them to be [[extraterritorial]], protected by [[diplomatic immunity]]. He put up signs such as "The Swedish Library" and "The Swedish Research Institute" on their doors and hung oversize Swedish flags on the front of the buildings to bolster the deception. The buildings eventually housed almost 10,000 people.<ref name=TWS/>

Sandor Ardai, one of the drivers working for Wallenberg, recounted what Wallenberg did when he intercepted a trainload of Jews about to leave for [[Auschwitz]]:

''{{quote|.. he climbed up on the roof of the train and began handing in protective passes through the doors which were not yet sealed. He ignored orders from the Germans for him to get down, then the [[Arrow Cross Party|Arrow Cross]] men began shooting and shouting at him to go away. He ignored them and calmly continued handing out passports to the hands that were reaching out for them. I believe the Arrow Cross men deliberately aimed over his head, as not one shot hit him, which would have been impossible otherwise. I think this is what they did because they were so impressed by his courage. After Wallenberg had handed over the last of the passports he ordered all those who had one to leave the train and walk to the caravan of cars parked nearby, all marked in Swedish colours. I don't remember exactly how many, but he saved dozens off that train, and the Germans and Arrow Cross were so dumbfounded they let him get away with it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/readings/wallenberg.htm |title= The Wallenberg Effect |accessdate=2007-02-15 |publisher = The Journal of Leadership Studies}}</ref>}}''

At the height of the program, over 350 people were involved in the rescue of Jews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rwallenberg-int.org/Programs/RW_Lesson_Secondary_2006/CHAPTER_4.htm |title=Wallenberg Legacy |accessdate=2007-02-14 |publisher=Raoul Wallenberg International Movement for Humanity |work= }}</ref> Sister [[S<U+00E1>ra Salkah<U+00E1>zi]] was caught sheltering Jewish women and was killed by members of the Arrow Cross Party.

Wallenberg started sleeping in a different house each night, to guard against being captured or killed by Arrow Cross Party members or by [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s men.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://raoulwallenberg.org/who/who.html |title=''Final Report of the War Refugee Board from Sweden'' |accessdate=2007-02-14 |work= }}</ref> Two days before the Russians occupied Budapest, Wallenberg negotiated with both Eichmann and General [[Gerhard Schmidthuber]], the commander of the German army in Hungary. Wallenberg bribed Arrow Cross Party member [[P<U+00E1>l Szalai]] to deliver a note in which Wallenberg persuaded the Germans to cancel a final effort to organize a [[death march]] of the remaining Jews in Budapest by threatening to have them prosecuted for war crimes once the war was over.<ref name=JVL/><ref name=NYT03301980/>

People saved by Wallenberg include biochemist [[Lars Ernster]], who was housed in the Swedish embassy, and [[Tom Lantos]], later a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], who lived in one of the Swedish protective houses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.jpost.com/C001/Supplements/Shoah/hol_LantosList.html |title= Lantos's list | quote= Born in Hungary in 1928 to assimilated Jewish parents, he escaped from a forced-labor brigade, joined the resistance and was eventually, with his later-to-be-wife Annette, among the tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews rescued by the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg.|accessdate=2007-02-15 |publisher = [[Jerusalem Post]]}}</ref>

== Detention by the Soviet Union ==
The Soviet [[Red Army]] closed in on Budapest in early 1945.  On January 17, 1945, Wallenberg was called to Marshal [[Rodion Malinovsky]]'s headquarter in [[Debrecen]] on suspicion of being a spy for the United States and that the War Refugee Board was engaged in espionage.<ref name=WP12232000/><ref>"Jews in Hungary Helped by Swede". ''[[The New York Times]]''; April 26, 1945, Thursday; Retrieved on February 14, 2007.</ref><ref name=SWRG/> Wallenberg's last recorded words were, "I'm going to Malinovsky's ... whether as a guest or prisoner I do not know yet."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809115,00.html "Well Taken Care Of".] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''; February 18, 1957; Retrieved on February 14, 2007.</ref> In 2003, a review of wartime Soviet correspondences indicated the agent [[Vilmos B<U+00F6>hm]] may have provided Wallenberg's name to Stalin as a person to detain.<ref>[http://raoulwallenberg.org/heroes/news/news_detail.asp?id=56 "Soviet double agent may have betrayed Wallenberg"]; [[Reuters]]; May 12, 2003; Retrieved on February 14, 2007.</ref>

Wallenberg was transported by train from [[Debrecen]], through [[Romania]], to [[Moscow]].<ref name=SWRG>{{cite web |url=http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/04/11/39/37b7322e.pdf |format=PDF|title=Report of Swedish Russian Working Group |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> The Soviets may have moved him to their capital in hopes of exchanging him for [[defectors]] in Sweden.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/scandinavia/01/12/wallenberg.finding/index.html "Wallenberg fate shrouded in mystery"]; [[CNN]]; January 12, 2001; Retrieved on February 14, 2007</ref> Vladimir Dekanosov notified the Swedes on January 16, 1945 that Wallenberg was under the protection of Soviet authorities.

On March 1, 1945, Richter was moved from his cell and never saw Wallenberg again.<ref name=ROB>{{cite web |url= http://www.raoulwallenberg.org/who/hero.html |title=A Hero for our Time |accessdate=2007-02-12 |author= [[Rachel Oestreicher Bernheim]] |year= 1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Raoul Wallenberg, Life and Work|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/06/world/soviet-turmoil-kgb-chief-to-let-agents-break-silence-about-wallenberg-s-fate.html| quote=The K.G.B. promised today that it would let agents break their vow of silence to help investigate the fate of Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who vanished after being arrested by the Soviets in 1945.| publisher=[[New York Times]]| date=September 6, 1991 |accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref>

On March 8, 1945, Soviet-controlled Hungarian radio announced that Wallenberg and his driver had been murdered on their way to Debrecen, suggesting that they had been killed by the [[Arrow Cross Party]] or the [[Gestapo]].

=== Death ===
On February 6, 1957, the Soviets released a document dated July 17, 1947, which stated "I report that the prisoner Wallenberg who is well-known to you, died suddenly in his cell this night, probably as a result of a heart attack or heart failure.

In 1953, the Hungarian [[State Protection Authority]] ({{lang-hu|<U+00C1>llamv<U+00E9>delmi Hat<U+00F3>s<U+00E1>g}} or [[<U+00C1>VH]]) initiated a [[show trial]] to prove that Wallenberg had not been moved to the Soviet Union in 1945, but was the victim of cosmopolitan Zionists.

In April 1952, Miksa Domonkos, L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Benedek and Lajos St<U+00F6>ckler, three leaders of the Jewish community in Budapest, were kidnapped by <U+00C1>VH officials to extract confessions.<ref name="InterviewIstvanDomonkos">[http://www.szombat.org/2006/0602apamatelhurcoltak.htm Interview with Istv<U+00E1>n Domonkos], son of Miksa Domonkos, who died after the show trial preparations.{{hu icon}}</ref> Two purported eyewitnesses&nbsp;<U+2013> [[P<U+00E1>l Szalai]] and [[K<U+00E1>roly Szab<U+00F3>]]&nbsp;<U+2013> were also arrested and interrogated using [[torture]].

The idea that the "murderers of Wallenberg" were Budapest Zionists was primarily supported by [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungarian Communist]] leader [[Ern<U+0151> Ger<U+0151>]], demonstrated by a note sent by him to First Secretary [[M<U+00E1>ty<U+00E1>s R<U+00E1>kosi]].<ref>[http://www.es.hu/pd/display.asp?channel=PUBLICISZTIKA0442&article=2004-1018-1055-02COSU Kenedi J<U+00E1>nos: Egy ki<U+00E1>ll<U+00ED>t<U+00E1>s hi<U+00E1>nyz<U+00F3> k<U+00E9>pei] {{hu icon}}</ref> The show trial was to be held in Moscow. However, after the death of Stalin and [[Lavrentiy Beria]], the preparations for the trial were stopped and the prisoners were released. Miksa Domonkos spent a week in the hospital and died at home shortly afterward, mainly due to the torture to which he had been subjected.<ref name="InterviewIstvanDomonkos" /><ref>[http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no143/p129.html Hungarian Quarterly] {{hu icon}}</ref>

== Family ==
Raoul's mother and stepfather both committed suicide by overdosing on pills two days apart in 1979.  Their daughter Nina Lagergren, Raoul's half-sister, attributed their suicide to their despair about never finding their son.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090302/en_afp/swedenisraelhungaryholocaust;_ylt=Atz9Ym3dkh4Jh1WfxIMPYQBxFb8C Holocaust Hero's Parents Committed Suicide in Despair] Yahoo News, March 2, 2009</ref>

The [[United States Postal Service]] issued a stamp to honor him in 1997.
