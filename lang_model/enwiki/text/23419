'''Moby''' (born '''Richard Melville Hall''' on [[September 11]], [[1965]] in [[Harlem]], [[New York]], and raised in [[Darien, Connecticut]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[songwriter]], [[musician]] and occasional [[singer]].  ''Moby'' also serves as the name of his live band.

After some limited success in the [[1990s]] with [[techno]] music, his biggest success was his more [[mainstream]] album [[Play (Moby album)|Play]], released in [[1999]], which sold 10 million copies worldwide.<ref> Jerry Armor, [http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910 Moby didn't feel pressure to follow up 'Play'], Yahoo! Music, viewed [[23 February]] [[2007]].</ref> He continues to record and release music today.

Moby plays [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]], [[guitar]], [[bass guitar]] and [[Drum kit|drums]]. He took his nickname from the novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', which was written by [[Herman Melville]], his great-great grand uncle.<ref>[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine, Stephen Thomas]].  [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:be1m964o3epc~T10 "Moby > Biography"].  [[All Music Guide]].  Retrieved [[January 23]], [[2007]].</ref>  He has also released music under the names '''Voodoo Child''', '''Barracuda''', '''UHF''', '''The Brotherhood''', '''DJ Cake''', '''Lopez''', and '''Mindstorm'''.  He has received a lot of attention for his political, environmental and religious beliefs.

==Music career==
[[Image:Moby-RareDJSet.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Moby performs a rare DJ set at NASA Rewind 04-03-2004 in NYC]]
===Early years===
Will Shattler, lead singer of punk band Flipper was thrown in jail when Moby was 16.  Because Moby knew all the lyrics to Flipper's songs, for two days he split singing vocals with Bruce Loose.  
Moby was in a [[punk music|punk]] band called the [[Vatican Commandos]], which was formed in 1980, but was kicked out{{Fact|date=February 2007}} after their first release, a 7-inch titled "Hit Squad for God". He claims it was because he realized his music tastes and growth were going in opposite directions of his previous bands.

He was a house disc jockey at The Beat in [[Port Chester, New York|Port Chester]], [[New York]] from 1985, and signed a recording contract with Instinct records in 1989.  His first success was "Go", a [[progressive music|progressive]] track using the string line from "[[Laura Palmer|Laura Palmer's Theme]]" from the [[Television|TV]] drama ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.  It reached the UK top ten in Autumn 1991 and earned him an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'',<ref name="Mobybio">http://www.moby.com/biography Moby biography, accessed 2 January 2006 </ref> and features on his first album, ''The Story So Far (aka Moby)''. 

In 1993 he toured with [[The Prodigy]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], and the [[Aphex Twin]],<ref name="Mobybio"/> and released a B-sides album named ''Rare: The Collected B-Sides 1989-1993''. One song on this album, "Thousand", earned him a world record for the fastest song ever. It reached 1015 [[beats per minute|BPM]].

===1994-1998===
His first album for [[Mute Records]] was ''[[Everything Is Wrong]]'' in 1995, which earned early critical praise and minor commercial success. (It was distributed in the USA by [[Elektra Records]].) He followed this up in early 1996 with the double album ''Everything Is Wrong - Mixed and Remixed''. 

Later in 1996 he released a [[hard rock]]/electronic album called ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' and toured Europe with the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Unusually for Moby, who usually writes all his own music, occasionally with collaborators, ''Animal Rights'' included a [[cover version]], [[Clint Conley]]'s "That's When I Reach for My Revolver".

In 1997, he released ''[[I Like to Score]]'', a collection of his music that had been used in movies. Among those tracks was an updated version of the "[[James Bond Theme]]" used for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]''. However, both  ''Animal Rights'' and ''I Like to Score'' were commercially unsuccessful, and Elektra declined distribution of future Moby releases.

===1999-2004===
After a decade's worth of music, Moby's breakthrough album was 1999's ''[[Play (Moby album)|Play]]''. Mainstream reviewers raved about his talents on the album (released on [[Mute Records]] and distributed in the US by [[V2 Records]]) though some early fans were let down. The album has 18 tracks and was the first album in history to have all of its tracks commercially licensed (see 'Moby's songs used in other media' below). The album's tracks eventually were accepted in various [[radio]] formats, but because of ''Play''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s extensive licensing, the album could have been financially successful even without radio play. In addition to fame garnered through its licensing, ''Play'' is also notable for its extensive sampling of old [[blues]] recordings collected by [[Alan Lomax]]. In a 2005 posting on his web site, Moby theorized that his eagerness to license his music is a result of "growing up in poverty".<ref name="Moby1">{{cite journal | first = | last = | | title = http://www.moby.com/node/5461| year = }}</ref>

In 2001, Moby founded the [[Area Festival|Area:One Festival]]. It was a popular touring [[rock festival]] that featured an eclectic range of musical genres. A second tour was organized for the following year.

In 2001, Moby also earned the ire of [[Eminem]] after calling his music [[misogyny|misogynist]] and [[homophobia|homophobic]]; Eminem later satirized Moby (among others) in "[[Without Me]]", calling him a "36-year-old baldheaded [[homosexuality|fag]]" and questioning his relevance, and declaring "Nobody listens to techno!" Moby replied that he hadn't played [[techno]] since 1992. The two were in a confrontation at the 2002 [[MTV Video Music Awards]], though Moby expresses respect for Eminem as an artist. 

In 2002, Moby released ''[[18 (album)|18]]'', an album that had 18 tracks. The most popular song on the album was "We Are All Made of Stars". Moby says he wrote "Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday)" in response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|2001 terrorist attacks]], which happened on his birthday.

Moby briefly had a television show on [[MTV]] in 2002, ''[[Se<U+00F1>or Moby's House of Music]]'', which focused mostly on more obscure [[electronic music]]. Moby also appeared on ''[[Ride with Funkmaster Flex]]''.

===2005 to date===
In 2005 Moby released his album ''[[Hotel (album)|Hotel]]''.  Instead of his usual usage of samples, all of the vocals and instruments on ''Hotel'' were performed live in the studio by Moby and vocalist Laura Dawn, who is the Cultural Director of [[MoveOn.org]].

The 2005 multi-award winning documentary ''[[Earthlings (documentary)|Earthlings]]'', narrated by Hollywood actor and [[animal rights]] activist [[Joaquin Phoenix]], features an original score by Moby.

Moby scored the soundtrack for Richard Kelly's 2006 movie ''[[Southland Tales]]''; he was a huge fan of Kelly's previous film, ''[[Donnie Darko]]'', and could not resist the offer the director gave him{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

On November 6, 2006, a [[compilation album]] of his greatest hits, entitled ''[[Go: The Very Best of Moby]]'' was released, which includes a new track, "[[New York New York (Moby song)|New York, New York]]" for which [[Debbie Harry]] provided vocals.  Different versions of this album have his single "[[Slipping Away]]" in different languages and with different co-singers.

Moby has reunited [[Richard Barone]]'s legendary 80s pop group [[The Bongos]] to produce and play on a new version of their song "The Bulrushes." The song will be included as a bonus track on the upcoming special edition release of the band's debut album, ''Drums Along The Hudson'', on [[Cooking Vinyl]] Records, due out in March 2007.

On the 24th February, 2007 Moby announced on his online journal that he was currently in the process of whittling down 400 songs to about 20 for a new album due out around September.

==Innovation==
Moby has used some unusual innovations in his career.  His 1995 single "Everytime You Touch Me" (CDMUTE176) featured a remix by the winner of a competition, Jude Sebastian.  For certain dates on Moby's 2005 European tour, ''[[Live Here Now]]'' provided concert-goers with compact disc recordings of the show 10 minutes after it ended.  His 2005 single "[[Lift Me Up (Moby)|Lift Me Up]]" featured, in addition to numerous remixes, [[United Kingdom|UK]] company Digimpro's software, which allows users to remix the song, using any or all of the samples included, and save it as an [[MP3]] file. Digimpro had previously seen exposure with group [[Erasure]]'s singles "Breathe", "Here I Go Impossible Again", and "Don't Say You Love Me".

==Essays==
Many Moby albums include essays that he has written himself in the inlay card. ''Everything Is Wrong'' had essays on over-consumption ("We use toxic chlorine bleach to keep our underpants white") and US religious leaders ("Why doesn't the Christian right go out and spread mercy, compassion and selflessness?"), and  ''The End of Everything'' discussed being a [[vegetarian]] ("Could you look an animal in the eyes and say to it, 'My appetite is more important than your suffering'?")

==Besides music==

The name Moby comes from the [[Herman Melville]] classic [[Moby-Dick]]. He claims he was able to trace his ancestry back to Melville, and so chose the name Moby in tribute. He is a [[veganism|vegan]],  [[Non-denominational_Christianity|non-denominational Christian]] and self-proclaimed "[[simpleton]]" (for his often sincere and idealistic political assessments). He has expressed [[pro-choice]] views. Moby lives in [[New York City]]'s [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]], where he's lived for a decade in a small [[apartment]] in a five-story building across the street from [[David Bowie]]. Until recently he co-owned a small [[restaurant]] and [[coffee shop]] called [[TeaNY]], where he occasionally waited tables. He also organized the Little Idiot Collective, a group of artists that also includes cartoonist and musician [[James Kochalka]]. 

Moby has signed up to pay $207,000 to become the first pop star to travel into space on the [[space tourism]] company [[Virgin Galactic]]'s [[VSS Enterprise]] spaceship in [[2010]]<ref name="MobySpace">{{cite journal | first = | last = | | title = http://www.nme.com/news/moby/21800 | year = }}</ref>.

==Activism==

Moby is well known advocate for a variety of progressive causes, working with [[MoveOn]] and [[PETA]], among others.  He created MoveOn Voter Fund's "Bush in 30 Seconds" contest along with singer/MoveOn Cultural Director Laura Dawn and MoveOn Executive Director Eli Pariser.

He also actively engages in nonpartisan activism. He has performed [[benefit concert]]s for the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function [http://www.bethabe.org/MUSIC_INSTITUTE55.html], promoting music therapy. Moby also serves on the Board of Directors of Amend.org [http://www.amend.org], a nonprofit that implements injury prevention programs in Africa.

He is an advocate of [[network neutrality]] and he testified before the US House committee debating the issue in 2006<ref name="MobyInt">{{cite journal | first = | last = | | title = http://www.savetheinternet.com/moby | year = }}</ref><ref name="MobyPress">{{cite journal | first = | last = | | title = http://www.freepress.net/news/15579| year = }}</ref>.

==Faith==
In a 2003 [[BBC]] interview, Moby speaks about his encounter with the gospels, "In about 1985 I read the teachings of Christ and was instantly struck by the idea that Christ was somehow divine. When I say I love Christ and love the teachings of Christ I mean that in the most simple and na<U+00EF>ve way. I'm not saying I'm right." <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/04_april/29/moby.shtml "Moby tells BBC World Service that his understanding of Christianity helped him achieve a new balance in life"]. bbc.co.uk 29.04.03 </ref>

In a September 20, 2006, audio interview with ''[[Sojourners]]'' magazine's John Potter, (a magazine considered to be a voice in the evangelical left), he says, "I read the [[New Testament]], specifically the gospels and I was struck at their divinity, feeling that humans could not have figured this out on their own. We're just not bright enough."<ref>[http://www.sojo.net/special/multimedia/audio/061004_moby/player.html "Moby: Everything is complicated"]. John Potter's Sojourners magazine audio interview with Moby, September 20, 2006. </ref> 

He also discusses his faith on his own [[weblog]].  On [[January 19]] [[2007]] in his reaction to seeing Alexandra Pelosi's ''Friend of God'', a film about evangelicalism in the United States, Moby writes, "The movie reminded me just how utterly disconnected the agenda of the evangelical Christian right is from the teachings of Christ." <ref> [http://moby.com/journal/2007-01-19/friend_of_god.html "Moby's blog"]. Moby.com, Journal entry January 19, 2007.</ref>

==Political quotes==
{{wikiquote}}
*<small> "It will be interesting to see what the long term fruits of our national apathy will be, 'cause so far they've been pretty foul."{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

*<small>"[It] seems painfully clear that the [[Bush administration]] have no intention of finding a peaceful resolution to the situation in [[war in Iraq|Iraq]]. Which is a shame. [Because] at the end of the day peace is better than war, right?  Or have things changed? According to the Bush administration and the American media it would seem that most Americans prefer war to peace. I'm guessing that's because most Americans have never actually experienced war... it's a sign of dark and troubled times when a powerful nations leaders do their best to keep people away from the high road."<ref name="Mobypol">{{cite journal | first = | last = | | title = http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=30345| year = }}</ref>.
