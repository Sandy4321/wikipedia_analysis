'''James Thomas Walker''' (20 March 1841 &ndash; 18 January 1923) was a Scottish-born Australian banker and politician.

Walker was born in Scotland but spent his early childhood in [[New South Wales]], before returning to Scotland with his family to study finance. Joining the [[Bank of New South Wales]], he returned to Australia and held various financial positions in New South Wales and [[Queensland]]. Gaining a public reputation for financial expertise, he was active in the [[Australian Federation|Federationist]] cause and was a delegate to the 1897 Constitutional Convention, where he was a significant figure in the development of Commonwealth finance schemes. After assisting the successful "Yes" campaign for the 1898 referendum, he was elected to the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] in 1901 as a [[Free Trade Party|Free Trader]].

As a senator, Walker continued to focus on finance, although his views on social policy sometimes saw him on the outside of his party. He supported the [[White Australia policy]] but disagreed with key elements, and was a leader in opposition to the dictation test, by which a potential immigrant was required to pass a test in any European language before their application was accepted. He also campaigned for a transcontinental railway and for a capital city to be located on federal territory. Attempts to guide financial reform through the parliament as a backbench senator led to frustration, and Walker retired due to ill health in 1913 with his legislation unpassed.

==Early life and career==
Walker was born on [[Leith Walk]] in [[Edinburgh]] to grazier John William Walker and his wife Elizabeth, ''n<U+00E9>e'' Waterston.<ref name=Senate>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Dermody|first=Kathleen|editor-last=Millar|editor-first=Ann|title=Pulsford, Edward (1844<U+2013>1919)|encyclopedia=The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate|volume=1|pages=34<U+2013>38|publisher=Melbourne University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-522-84921-0}}</ref> The family migrated to [[New South Wales]] in 1844 and settled on Castlereads Station near [[Boorowa, New South Wales|Boorowa]].

|accessdate=2012-08-12 }}</ref> James was educated at the [[Stewart's Melville College|Edinburgh Institution]] and [[King's College, London|King's College]] in [[London]] before returning to Edinburgh in 1857.<ref name=adb/> After several years in Scotland working first for the paper manufacturers Cowan & Sons, and then for stockbroker Robert Allan, he joined the [[Bank of New South Wales]]' London branch in March 1860; his cousin, [[Thomas Walker (Australian philanthropist)|Thomas Walker]], was one of the bank's directors.<ref name=adb/> In January 1862 he departed for [[Melbourne]] on [[HMS Swiftsure (1804)|''Swiftsure'']] and was posted to the bank's [[Sydney]] office.<ref name=Senate/>

Walker was then sent by the bank to [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]] in [[Queensland]], where he worked as an accountant until 1866 when he was appointed manager of the [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]] branch.<ref name=adb/> In 1867 he was transferred to the [[Toowoomba, Queensland|Toowoomba]] branch, which he managed until 1878 when he was promoted assistant inspector in [[Brisbane]].<ref name=Senate/> He married Janette Isabella Palmer on 16 April 1868 at Range View. In 1885 he resigned from the Bank of New South Wales to become the first manager of the [[Royal Bank of Queensland]], but in 1887 he returned to New South Wales to manage the estate of [[Eadith Walker]], the daughter of his late cousin Thomas.<ref name=Senate/>

==Federation==

Walker had a strong interest in [[Australian Federation|Federation]] and was a member of the Australasian Federation League of New South Wales. In 1896 he attended the People's Federal Convention in [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], where he proposed a financial scheme that would provide savings for a federal government based on income from state taxes and federal spending.<ref name=Senate/> His reputation for financial expertise saw him elected to the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)#1897<U+2013>1898 convention|Australian Federal Convention]] in 1897. There he supported equal representation for all states in an upper house, Commonwealth control of railways, and a national capital on federal territory.<ref name=Senate/> He reiterated his financial proposals, but was overlooked for the finance and trade committee, having been described by [[Alfred Deakin]] as "a mere commercial man".<ref name=adb/>

Despite this setback, Walker continued to play an active part in the development of the [[Australian Constitution]]. He successfully had the name of the federal upper house changed from the "States Assembly" to the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], although his proposal that the federated colonies adopt the name "Commonwealth of Australasia", with a view to the future inclusion of New Guinea, New Zealand and Fiji, was not adopted.<ref name=Senate/> He also supported a minimum age for senators of twenty-five, rather than twenty-one, and voted for [[Paddy Glynn]]'s proposal to include recognition of a "Divine Sovereign" in the Constitution.<ref name=Senate/>

The second session of the Convention took place in Sydney in September 1897. Walker was appointed to a subcommittee on federal finance, which proposed a financial scheme based on Walker's Bathurst proposal that was adopted by the Convention.<ref name=Senate/> He was active in the Federation referendum campaign, travelling around New South Wales to encourage a "Yes" vote. He mostly focused on financial issues, and in 1899 went to [[Western Australia]], the most reluctant colony, to increase support.<ref name=Senate/>

Following the success of the referendum, Walker was encouraged to stand for the Senate by a petition of over 6500 signatures.<ref name=Senate/> A staunch [[free trade]]r, Walker campaigned as part of the [[Free Trade Party]]'s endorsed ticket. He had resigned as president of the Bank of New South Wales in 1897, but remained a director.<ref name=adb/> At the [[Australian federal election, 1901|first federal election]] in March 1901, Walker was elected as a New South Wales Senator at the head of the poll.<ref name=Psephos>{{cite web|last=Carr|first=Adam|title=Australian Election Archive|work=Psephos, Adam Carr's Election Archive|url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia|year=2008|accessdate=2008-11-10}}</ref>

==Senate career==

As a senator, Walker devoted his support to a variety of causes, including a transcontinental railway and equal pay for women.<ref name=Senate/> He opposed a federal old-age pension scheme on the grounds of lack of funds, and also opposed the [[Immigration Restriction Act 1901|Immigration Restriction Bill]], although he supported the [[White Australia policy]] in principle. He opposed the proposed form of the dictation test and supported [[James Macfarlane]]'s amendment requiring the test to be administered in a language known to the immigrant, moving his own amendment after Macfarlane's was defeated.<ref name=Senate/> He also expressed reservations about the deportation of [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|Kanaka]] labourers, supporting the reduction in their use but advocating that those resident in Australia for at least five years be permitted to remain. He vigorously opposed [[compulsory arbitration]], and voted against the [[Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904|Conciliation and Arbitration Bill]].<ref name=Senate/>

Re-elected as an Anti-Socialist in 1906, Walker expressed the view that the three-party system of the Australian Parliament's first decade was dysfunctional, and implored electors to vote "for either socialism or anti-socialism, and so end this triangular government".<ref name=Senate/> He continued to support the transcontinental railway and lamented the slow progress of the decision on a site for the federal capital, and supported a higher rate of immigration and the watering down of the Immigration Restriction Act.<ref name=Senate/> In 1908, he introduced the Commonwealth Companies Reserve Liabilities Bill, which permitted special reserve funds for banks to assist shareholders during a financial crisis, and in 1910 followed with the similar Commonwealth Banking Companies Reserve Liabilities Bill. He complained of the difficulty of passing private senators' bills, and at the [[Australian federal election, 1913|1913 election]] he retired, suffering from ill health.<ref name=adb/>

==Later life==

Walker maintained an interest in politics after his retirement, and remained a director of the Bank of New South Wales until 1921. He had been president of the Australian Golf Club (1903&ndash;19), a director of the [[Royal Prince Alfred Hospital]], and a member of the [[Presbyterian Church of Australia|Presbyterian Church]]'s finance committee.<ref name=adb/> A fellow of the [[Institute of Bankers]] in London since 1886 and vice-president of the Australian Economic Association, he also continued as a director of the Australian Mutual Provident Society and a councillor of [[St Andrew's College, University of Sydney|St Andrew's College]] at the [[University of Sydney]].<ref name=Senate/> Walker died on 18 January 1923 at [[Woollahra, New South Wales|Woollahra]] in Sydney, and was survived by his wife and five of their seven children. Buried at [[South Head Cemetery]], his estate at his death was worth <U+00A3>27,697.<ref name=adb/>
