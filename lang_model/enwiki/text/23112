'''Courier Chess''' or '''Courier Spiel''' or '''the Courier Game''' is a board game in the [[chess]] family.  The original form is known to have been played for at least six hundred years, after which it was replaced by a more modern form.  It pioneered the modern [[bishop (chess)|chess bishop]], and probably played a part in evolving modern chess out of [[shatranj|Medieval Chess]].  

==The Rules==
Courier Chess is played on a board of eight ranks by twelve files.  Literary and artistic evidence indicate that the board was checkered from the beginning, but that there was no rule as to which squares were dark. The practice is still unsettled, but the more frequent practice seems to be that the square at each player's extreme right is white.<ref group="note">See the Chess Variants website http://www.chessvariants.org/historic.dir/courier.html. Murray 1913, p. 392 (citing Selenus, Gustavus, ''Schach- oder K<U+00F6>nigs-Spiel'', Leipzig, 1616) gives the contrary rule.</ref>  The kings, though, start on squares of their own color, at f1 and f8 by the [[algebraic chess notation|algebraic notation]].  The [[king (chess)|king]] moves one square in any direction, but may not be placed or left in check (at risk).  There is no castling.  Next to the king, on e1 and e8, stands the ''Rath'' or ''Mann'', the counselor or henchman, which moves one square in any direction, but may be placed or left ''en prise'' (at risk).  On the other central file, at g1 and g8, stands the queen, who has the move of the [[ferz]]: one square diagonally.  On the queen's other hand, at h1 and h8, stands a piece known as the ''Schleich'' (sneak or smuggler) or Tr<U+00FC>lle (trull) and sometimes depicted as a jester, moving one square along a rank or file.  The two flanks mirror each other.  At d1, i1, d8, and i8 stands the piece that gave the game its name: the Courier or ''L<U+00E4>ufer'', the runner, still the German name for the [[bishop (chess)|chess bishop]].  Next out, at c1, j1, c8, and j8, stands the ''Bischof'' or bishop, also called the "old man" or "archer": the [[alfil]], leaping diagonally to the second square.  At b1, k1, b8, and k8 stand the [[knight (chess)|knight]], and in the corners the [[rook]].<ref group="note">Bell 1960,1979, pp.62&ndash;63</ref>  

The second rank is filled with pawns.  These move one square forward, capturing one square diagonally forward, except that at the start of the game each player must move his rook-pawns, his queen-pawn, and his queen two squares forward.  Such a two-square leap along a file was called a ''Freudensprung''&mdash;English "joy-leap".<ref group="note">Murray 1913, p.438</ref> The original rule for pawn-promotion is unknown.  The standard medieval rule was that a pawn reaching the farthest rank was promoted at once to (medieval) queen.<ref group="note">Bell 1960, 1979, pp.59&ndash;60</ref>

==History==
Wirnt von Gravenberg, writing early in the thirteenth century, mentioned the Courier Game in his poem ''Wigalois'', and expected his readers to know what he was talking about.  Heinrich von Beringen, about a hundred years later, mentioned the introduction of the couriers as an improvement in chess.  Kunrat von Ammenhausen, still in the first half of the fourteenth century, told how he had once in [[Constance]] seen a game with sixteen more men than in the "right chess": each side having a trull, two couriers, a counsellor, and four extra pawns.  He added that he had never seen the game anywhere else, in Provence, France, or Kurwalhen.<ref group="note">Murray 1913, pp.483&ndash;484</ref>  

Sometime shortly after 1475 someone put the courier on the standard chessboard in place of the old alfil and gave the queen the combined powers of the courier and the rook.<ref group="note">Murray 1913, pp.776&ndash;777, Eales 1985, p. 72</ref>  This game was so much more exciting than medieval chess that it soon drove the older game off the market.<ref group="note">Murray 1913, Chapter XI</ref>  Other improvements were tried out.  One was an optional double first step for the pawns.  This was at first restricted to the king's, queen's, and rooks' pawns, and then gradually extended to the others.<ref group="note">Murray 1913, p.852</ref>

In the early sixteenth century [[Lucas van Leyden]], in the Netherlands, painted a picture called "The Chess Players" in which a woman appears to be beating a man at Courier Chess.  [[Gustavus Selenus]] (Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-L<U+00FC>neburg) in his 1616 book ''Das Schach- oder K<U+00F6>nigs-Spiel'', mentioned the Courier Game as one of three forms of chess played in the village of [[Str<U+00F6>beck]] near [[Halberstadt]] in [[Sachsen-Anhalt]], Germany.  He described it in detail, and gave drawings of the pieces.  The names he gave the pieces do not always match the figures in the drawings: the piece called the ''Schleich'' is depicted as a court jester.  In 1651 [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] and Duke of Prussia, gave to Str<U+00F6>beck a playing board with chess on one side and the Courier Game on the other, and a set of silver pieces.  These pieces were lent in the eighteenth century and never returned, but there is a set of wooden pieces.  In 1821 H. G. Albers reported that Courier Chess was still played in Str<U+00F6>beck, and that some pieces had gained more powerful moves, but a few years later other visitors found that it had been abandoned.<ref group="note"> The Chess Variations website at http://www.chessvariants.org/historic.dir/courierspiel.html mentions H. G. Albers, 1821, and George Hope Verney, ''Chess Eccentricities'', Longmans, Green & Co., London, 1885.</ref>  In 1883 the local chess club revived it.  Playing sets based on Lucas van Leyden's painting are commercially available.<ref group=note>at http://courierchess.com</ref>

==The Modern Rules==
The starting set-up is the same as for medieval Courier Chess.  The king, queen, courier (remember, the German word for a chess bishop), knight, and rook have their modern powers.  The bishop (or archer) can move one square diagonally, or leap diagonally to the second square.  The fool, standing beside the queen, moves one square in any direction.  The sage, standing beside the king, combines the powers of the fool and the knight.  The pawn moves like the modern pawn, except that after reaching the farthest rank it must remain there for two moves before taking up its new career as a piece.  Castling is permitted, if all squares between the king and the rook are vacant, the king has not been checked, the rook is not ''en prise'', neither has moved, and no square between them is under attack.  The king moves to the bishop's square, and the rook leaps over him to the courier's square, in either wing.<ref group="note">Verney, p. 154</ref>
