'''''Rugosodon''''' is an extinct [[genus]] of [[multituberculata|multituberculate]] (rodent-like) [[mammal]]s from eastern [[China]] that lived 160 million years ago during the [[Jurassic period]]. The discovery of its [[type species]] '''''Rugosodon eurasiaticus''''' was reported in the 16 August 2013 issue of ''[[science (journal)|Science]]''. The species is the oldest so far described in the multituberculate [[family (biology)|family]],<ref>{{cite journal |author= Yuan C-X, Ji Q,  Meng Q-J, Tabrum AR, Luo Z-X |title= Earliest evolution of multituberculate mammals revealed by a new Jurassic fossil |url= |journal= Science |volume= 341|issue= 6147 | pages= 779-783 |year= 2013 |pmid= |doi= 10.1126/science.1237970}}</ref> the most successful and long-lasting [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] of all [[mammals]].<ref name=aaas>{{cite web| author=AAAS |title= Unearthed: Fossil of history's most successful mammal|date=15 August 2013 | url= http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-08/aaft-ufo080913.php |work= EurekAlert |publisher= American Association for the Advancement of Science |accessdate= 17 August 2013}}</ref>

==Description==
''Rugosodon'' is represented by a nearly complete fossilized skeleton, including a [[skull]], that bears a strong resemblance to a small [[rat]] or a [[chipmunk]]. The mammal is estimated to have weighed between 65-80 g, about that of an average chipmunk. The [[Generic name (biology)|generic name]] ''Rugosodon'' ([[Latin]] for "wrinkly tooth") refers to the [[rugosity]], or wrinkliness, of the distinctively shaped teeth.<ref>{{cite web| author=Michael Balter |title=ScienceShot: Meet <U+2018>Wrinkly Tooth,<U+2019> the Earliest Rodentlike Creature |date=15 August 2013 | url= http://news.sciencemag.org/paleontology/2013/08/scienceshot-meet-%E2%80%98wrinkly-tooth%E2%80%99-earliest-rodentlike-creature |work= Science |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |accessdate= 18 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=perkins>{{cite news| author= Perkins, Sid|title=Fossil reveals features of mammal line that outlived dinosaurs |date=15 August 2013 | url= http://www.nature.com/news/fossil-reveals-features-of-mammal-line-that-outlived-dinosaurs-1.13568 |work= Nature |publisher= |accessdate= 17 August 2013}}</ref> Its teeth indicate that the animal was an [[omnivore]], well-adapted to [[gnawing]] both plants and animals, including [[fruits]] and [[seeds]], [[Earthworm|worms]], [[insects]] and small [[vertebrates]]. Its [[ankle joint]]s were highly mobile at rotation, a characteristic of mammals living in trees.<ref name=aaas/> This means that the ankle is remarkably flexible, allowing the foot to hyper-extend downward <U+2014> like a [[ballerina]] standing on pointed toes <U+2014> and to rotate through a wide range of motion. This feature, along with highly mobile digits, defines the multituberculates and is not seen in other mammalian lineages of the era. ''Rugosodon'' also had a highly flexible [[Spine (anatomy)|spine]], which would have allowed it to twist both left to right and front to back.<ref name=perkins/>

==Discovery and taxonomic significance==
In 2009, a local fossil hunter unearthed an unusual fossil in the [[Tiaojishan Formation]] of China's [[Liaoning]] province, dating to 160 million years ago. He turned the fossil over to the [[Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences]], where it was eventually identified as a nearly complete skeleton and given the name ''Rugosodon eurasiaticus''.<ref name=TIME>{{cite news|title=An Ancient Mammal Paves the Way for Modern Rodents|work=TIME|date=16 August 2013|author=Veronique Greenwood|url=http://science.time.com/2013/08/16/an-ancient-mammal-paves-the-way-for-modern-rodents/|accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref> The fossil was discovered on what was the shore of an ancient lake.<ref name=NatGeo>{{cite news|title=Fossil Reveals Long-Lived Mammal Group's Secret|author=Ker Than|work=National Geographic|date=15 August 2013|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130815-multituberculate-rugosodon-early-mammal-evolution/|accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref> It was preserved in two shale slabs and measures about 17 cm (6.5 inches) long from head to rump. The site of the discovery consists of lake sediments with embedded [[Volcanic ash|volcanic layers]], which also contained fossils of [[feathered dinosaur]] ''[[Anchiornis]]'' and the [[pterosaur]] ''[[Darwinopterus]]''. The dental features of ''Rugosodon'' most resemble those of multituberculates of the Late Jurassic of [[Western Europe]], suggesting that Europe and Asia had extensive mammal [[Fauna|faunal]] interchanges (hence the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]], ''eurasia'') during the Jurassic.<ref>{{cite web| author=science 2.0 |title=''Rugosodon Eurasiaticus'': Fossil Of History's Most Successful Mammal Unearthed |date=15 August 2013 | url= http://www.science20.com/news_articles/rugosodon_eurasiaticus_fossil_historys_most_successful_mammal_unearthed-118612 |work= science20.com |publisher= ION Publications LLC |accessdate= 18 August 2013}}</ref> 

Prior to the discovery of ''Rugosodon'', scientists knew that multituberculates living 66 million years ago had highly flexible ankles.<ref name=NatGeo /> However, older species were mostly known from small fragments, and it was not proven that the [[Basal (phylogenetics)|trait was ancestral]]. Additionally, it was unknown what sort of diet was primitive in the lineage.<ref name=TIME /> The presence of the characteristic flexible ankles in ''Rugosodon'' demonstrates that the trait is ancestral and provides a strong clue that the trait was a major factor in the lineage's evolutionary success.<ref name=NatGeo /> The animal's diet provides a bridge between very early mammals, which were mostly [[insectivore]]s, and later multituberculates, which were mostly [[herbivore]]s.<ref name=TIME />  The features of ''Rugosodon'' also suggest that the animal initiated [[arboreal|tree-dwelling]] habits among mammals.<ref name=aaas/>
