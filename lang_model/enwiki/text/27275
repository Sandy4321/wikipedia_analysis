'''Celidonius''' is the traditional name ascribed to the "[[Healing the blind at birth|man born blind]]" whom [[Miracles of Jesus|Jesus healed]] in the [[Gospel of John]] {{bibleverse-nb||John|9:1-38}}. This [[Sacred Tradition|tradition]] is attested in both [[Eastern Christianity]] and in [[Catholicism]].

One tradition ascribes to St. Celidonius the founding of the [[Diocese of N<U+00EE>mes|Christian church at N<U+00EE>mes]] in [[Gaul]] (present-day France).

Saint [[Demetrius of Rostov]], in his ''Great [[Synaxarion]]'', also mentions that the blind man's name was Celidonius.<ref>Demetrius of Rostov, ''Great Synaxarion'', entry for January 4, "[[Synaxis]] of the [[Seventy Apostles]]"</ref>

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the account of the healing of Celidonius is recounted on the [http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&ID=1&FSID=40 Sunday of the Blind Man], the Sixth Sunday of [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter). Many hymns concerning the healing and its significance are found in the ''[[Pentecostarion]]'', a [[liturgical book]] used during the [[Paschal season]].
