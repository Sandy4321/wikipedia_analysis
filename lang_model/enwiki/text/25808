'''Naum Veqilharxhi''' born '''Naum Bredhi''' (1797-1854<ref name="Islami134"/>) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] lawyer and scholar. In 1844, he created a unique alphabet for the [[Albanian language]] using characters he had created himself.  Veqilharxhi is one of most prominent figures of the early [[Albanian National Awakening]].

==Life==
Naum Veqilharxhi was born Naum Bredhi in 1797 in the village of [[Vithkuq]], near [[Kor<U+00E7><U+00EB>]] southern [[Albania]]. His father Panajot Bredhi was a [[Steward (office)|steward]] of [[Ali Pash<U+00EB> Tepelena]], the ruler of the [[Pashalik of Janina]]. At an early age Veqilharxhi migrated to [[Romania]] to study law. As a student he took part in the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]]. A few years later he worked in [[Br<U+0103>ila]] as a lawyer, became wealthy and used his money to promote the ideas of the [[Albanian National Awakening]].<ref name="treptow">{{cite book|last=Treptow|first=Kurt|title=From Zalmoxis to Jan Palach: studies in East European history|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=slVpAAAAMAAJ&q=Naum+Veqilharxhi&dq=Naum+Veqilharxhi&hl=en&ei=QycuTPPlKYP68Ab0rZG2Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBzgK|series=East European monographs|volume=328|year=1992|publisher=East European Monographs|isbn=0880332255|page=98}}</ref> In Br<U+0103>ila he joined an intellectual organization of Albanians, who considered the development of Albanian language and culture necessary for the Albanian National Awakening.<ref name="treptow"/>

In 1825, he started the creation of his alphabet of the Albanian language. The final version of his thirty-three-letter alphabet, whose characters were invented by Veqilharxhi was printed as part of primer in 1844-5 titled ''Ev<U+00EB>tori Shqip Fort i Shkurt<U+00EB>r'' ({{lang-en|The most Useful and Concise Albanian Alphabet}}).<ref>{{cite book|last=Norris|first=H.T|title=Islam in the Balkans: religion and society between Europe and the Arab world|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RGmzir-ITtUC&pg=PA247&dq=Naum+Bredhi&hl=en&ei=-CcuTMTGKoG78gamzv2EAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Naum%20Bredhi&f=false|year=1993|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|isbn=0872499774|page=247}}</ref> Veqilharxhi avoided the use of Latin, Greek or Arabic alphabets and characters because of their religious associations and divisions<ref>{{cite book|last=Straehle|first=Carolin|title=International journal of the sociology of language|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fvhhAAAAMAAJ&q=Naum+Veqilharxhi&dq=Naum+Veqilharxhi&hl=en&ei=ZScuTNHXOcT68Abu6f2SAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBzgU|year=1974|publisher=Mouton|page=5}}</ref>

In 1845 Veqilharxhi sent a polemic open letter written in the Greek language to his nephew, who had dared call his patriotic ideas ''chimera'': the letter is considered to be one of the first written documents to record the main ideas of the Albanian National Awakening movement.<ref name="Islami137">Islami, p.137</ref>
