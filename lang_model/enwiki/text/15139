'''''Thriller''''' is a '''[[viral video]]''' featuring the dancing inmates of a high security [[prison|penitentiary]]. In 2007, the inmates of [[Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center]] (CPDRC), a maximum security prison in [[Cebu City|Cebu]], in the [[Cebu (province)|Cebu Province]] of the [[Philippines]], imitated the zombie dance featured in [[Thriller (music video)|the music video]] of [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]". The footage, uploaded onto [[video hosting service|video sharing]] website [[YouTube]], became an immediate internet hit and viral video. The idea behind the dance came from the prison's chief, Byron F. Garcia. Garcia first conceived the idea of exercising as an enjoyable way of keeping the prisoners mentally and physically fit. Music was then added to provide additional motivation. The convicts  marched and danced to several songs, including "[[In the Navy]]" and "[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|Y.M.C.A.]]" by the [[Village People]]. 

Garcia posted the prisoners' dance regimes onto the internet in April 2007. The most popular of the presentations was their ''Thriller'' performance. The video showed over 1,500 male inmates emulating Michael Jackson's dance moves from the original ''Thriller'' short film. Jackson fan Crisanto Nierre played the role of the pop star, with the [[openly gay]] former pizza chef Wenjiel Resane playing his girlfriend. The video became one of the most visited in cyberspace, receiving 300,000 views per day at its peak. As of January 18, 2008, the ''Thriller'' viral video  has received almost 15 million recorded views. The clip also garnered complaints, with one professor stating that the dancing doesn't [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitate]] CPDRC inmates. The prison and it's officers faced allegations of prisoner abuse, claims which both the officers and inmates denied. 

The prisoner's have performed numerous other songs, including "[[Radio Gaga]]", "[[Together in Electric Dreams]]", "[[Holding Out for a Hero]]", and several songs from ''[[Sister Act]]''. As a result of the prisoners' internet fame, many visitors come to CPDRC to view the monthly performances held by the convicts. Their presentations are seen from viewing platforms surrounding the exercise yard. At the jail, visitors can have their pictures taken with the inmates. They can also buy souvenir prison shirts. One of their performances involves the inmates holding portraits of figures such as the [[Dalai Lama]], [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Mahatma Ghandi]].

<blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:30%; float:left; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">I hope that all the people who see us will be happy in knowing that we, despite being prisoners, we were able to do this. Before the dancing, our problems were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.<p style="text-align: right;"><U+2014>Crisanto Nierre, inmate who played Michael Jackson<ref name="Inmate 'Thriller' video is Web hit" /><br /></blockquote>

Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center is a [[maximum security prison]] in [[Cebu City|Cebu]], in the [[Cebu (province)|Cebu Province]] of the [[Philippines]]. The center is run by Warden Byron F. Garcia, and its inmates are either facing trial or are serving sentences for crimes ranging from [[shoplifting]], to murder and rape.<ref name="Boogie Behind Bars: Inmates Dance the Days Away">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=3415920&page=1|title=Boogie Behind Bars: Inmates Dance the Days Away|last=Ferran|first=Lee|date=August 14, 2007|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=May 10, 2009}}</ref> In 2007, more than 300 of the inmates were facing murder charges.<ref name="Inmate 'Thriller' video is Web hit">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2007-08-09-2069158024_x.htm|title=Inmate 'Thriller' video is Web hit|last=Alexander|first=Paul|date=August 9, 2007|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|accessdate=May 24, 2009}}</ref> Garcia initiated the idea of exercising as an enjoyable way of keeping the prisoners mentally and physically fit. "While the goal is to keep the body fit in order to keep the mind fit, such may not happen if it is done in a manner deemed unpleasurable", Garcia said.<ref name="Boogie Behind Bars: Inmates Dance the Days Away" /> Considering music to be "the language of the soul", Garcia added it to the prisoner's workout regime.<ref name="Boogie Behind Bars: Inmates Dance the Days Away" /> Garcia also wanted the music workouts to be a way in which to break down gang factions amongst prison inmates.<ref name="Prisoners dance to Thriller">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/arts_entertainment/film_tv/prisoners+dance+to+thriller/648847|title=Prisoners dance to Thriller|date=(August 2, 2007)|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}</ref> Melita Thomeczeck, the Philippine's deputy consulate general in New York, suspected that the warden added the music in order to take detainee's minds off of other matters.<ref name="Boogie Behind Bars: Inmates Dance the Days Away" /> One of the first songs the prisoners worked with was [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Another Brick in the Wall]]". Garcia  had them march to the music as a bid to increase participation in exercise.<ref name="Philippine jailhouse rocks to Thriller">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_6917000/6917318.stm|title=Philippine jailhouse rocks to Thriller|date=(July 26, 2007)|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=May 25, 2009}}</ref> Other early musical choices included "[[In the Navy]]" and "[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|Y.M.C.A.]]" by the [[Village People]]. The Village People songs were chosen so that macho inmates "wouldn't be offended by being asked to dance".<ref name="Philippine jailhouse rocks to Thriller" />

For [[Filipino people|Filipinos]], music and dancing is said to be a way of life. Natives of the Philippines are reported to have a tendency to "sing and dance their way out of even the most complicated situations".<ref name="Boogie Behind Bars: Inmates Dance the Days Away" /> Thomeczeck stated, "The Filipinos love music and they love to sing and dance. Whatever they are in a natural way, they can continue that habit in prison."<ref name="Boogie Behind Bars: Inmates Dance the Days Away" /> Despite other colleagues' enthusiasm about the dancing, chief administrator Patrick Rubio of the Directorate of Operations within the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology was worried about the volume of inmates dancing, as CPDRC was undermanned. Despite inmate dancing not being prohibited by the center's Operations Manual, Rubio thought of the dance as a disaster waiting to happen. "As a jail officer, I got worried when I saw it", Rubio commented.<ref name="Boogie Behind Bars: Inmates Dance the Days Away" /> The inmates were not fond of the idea either, pelting a visiting [[choreographer]] with slippers the first time he arrived at the prison.<ref name="Prisoners dance to Thriller" /> Prisoners eventually agreed to dance, but admitted that the routines took awhile to master. "It was difficult at first, but eventually we inmates got used to it", inmate Mario Benito revealed.<ref name="Prisoners dance to Thriller" />  The program began as an experiment and, after six months, prison chiefs concluded that it was a successful one.<ref name="Prisoners dance to Thriller" />

==Video and response==
In 2007, Garcia posted several videos of his inmates' performances on [[YouTube]], a [[video hosting service|video sharing]] website where users can upload, view and share [[video clip]]s. He uploaded them in hopes of inspiring other prisons to learn from the experience.<ref name="Prisoners dance to Thriller" /> The clips became some of the most talked about in cyberspace.<ref name="Prisoners dance to Thriller" /> The most popular of the videos was uploaded in April 2007.

Nierre, who at the time was awaiting trial on drug charges, has been a fan of Jackson since he was in a dance troupe at high school. ''[[USA Today]]'' noted that his favorite Jackson tracks were "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" and "[[Smooth Criminal]]".<ref name="Inmate 'Thriller' video is Web hit" /> Former pizza chef Wenjiel Resane, who is [[homosexuality|gay]], played the part of Jackson's girlfriend.

Several of the inmates showed devotion towards their prison chief, with as many as 20 prisoners bearing tattoos with Garcia's name.<ref name="Inmate 'Thriller' video is Web hit" /> Garcia's concept of having prisoners dance as part of a rehabilitation program has been copied by several prisons, including jails in [[Quezon]] province and [[Muntinlupa]]. Garcia commented that the move showed that dancing is not a cruel or unusual punishment. He claimed that his prison showed that negative inmates could be turned into positive individuals, through the concept of a "revolutionized penology".<ref name="A time to dance">{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20071221-108184/A_time_to_dance|title=A time to dance|date=(December 21, 2007)|publisher=''Philippine Daily Inquirer''|accessdate=May 26, 2009}}</ref> Following Garcia's presentation of an inmate performance at the province's Founding Day celebrations, a donation of $35,000 was given to the prison.

The prison inmates ''Thriller'' performance made it to the pages of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''<U+2014>on the international magazine<U+2019>s list of the most watchable Internet videos for 2007. The inmates' interpretation of the ''Thriller'' music video was ranked the fifth of 10 "most popular viral videos" of the year, or the "Web clips we couldn<U+2019>t stop watching".<ref name="Cebu inmates' 'Thriller' in Time most-watched list" /> The list also included appearances by [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Chris Crocker (Internet celebrity)|Chris Crocker]] for his ''Leave Britney Alone!'' clip.<ref name="Cebu inmates' 'Thriller' in Time most-watched list" /> ''Time'' described the convicts as "orange-jumpsuited accused murderers, rapists and drug dealers", and noted that their performance was made in "homage" to Jackson's ''Thriller''.<ref name="Cebu inmates' 'Thriller' in Time most-watched list" /> The magazine stated that the viral video had been downloaded more than nine million times.<ref name="Cebu inmates' 'Thriller' in Time most-watched list" /> (As of January 18, 2008, the reported views of the video have reached almost 15 million).<ref name="Philippines<U+2019> dancing jail <U+2014> everyone wants to go inside">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C04%5C29%5Cstory_29-4-2008_pg9_5|title=Philippines<U+2019> dancing jail <U+2014> everyone wants to go inside|date=(April 29, 2008)|publisher=''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]''|accessdate=May 27, 2009}}</ref>

Edward Latessa, professor and head of division of criminal justice at the [[University of Cincinnati]], declared that the prisoners who are dancing are not being rehabilitated. Latessa stated that the prisoners may think that they are getting something out of the performances, when, in reality, they are not. He described it as having a potentially harmful effect. The professor insisted that more appropriate rehabilitation programs, like [[Drug rehabilitation|substance abuse]] or family reunification programs, should be implemented with as much coordination and vigor.<ref name="Boogie Behind Bars: Inmates Dance the Days Away" /> The detention workers disagreed with the assessment, deeming the activities to be an integral part of rehabilitation. "It combines the need for physical exercise and their love to sing and dance", Thomeczeck argued. "In more ways than one, it contributes to their rehabilitation and eventual reintegration. It's a way to put themselves together physically and probably spiritually. That's good, isn't it?".<ref name="Boogie Behind Bars: Inmates Dance the Days Away" />

==Aftermath==
In late 2007, ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition 2]]'' scheduled a visit from some of its celebrities to the provincial jail. The celebrities danced with 1,600 CPDRC inmates to the tune of "Rico Mambo" as part of their weekly task, set by Big Brother. The request had been made by Maria Rowena Benitez, Pinoy Big Brother production manager.<ref name="Housemates to dance with CPDRC inmates">{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/community/view/20071109-99850/Housemates_to_dance_with_CPDRC_inmates|title=Housemates to dance with CPDRC inmates|last=Salva Alueta|first=Suzzane|date=November 9, 2007|publisher=''Philippine Daily Inquirer''|accessdate=May 26, 2009}}</ref> The housemates were not informed of their task, but were brought to the prison in [[blindfolds]]. They were then subsequently given back their sight, with the inmates surrounding them.<ref name="Housemates to dance with CPDRC inmates" /> Beforehand, it was also announced that the Big Brother celebrity housemates would perform a concert, with the proceeds being donated to CPDRC. The concert, held inside the Pinoy Big Brother house in [[Manila]], was attended by 100 people, who each paid [[Philippine peso|P]]1,000.<ref name="Housemates to dance with CPDRC inmates" />

The CPDRC inmates have performed numerous other songs, including [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Radio Gaga]]" and several songs from ''[[Sister Act]]'', with prisoners dressing as [[nun]]s in [[Religious habit|habits]].<ref name="Boogie Behind Bars: Inmates Dance the Days Away" /><ref name="Prisoners dance to Thriller" /> 44 female inmates, held in a separate wing from the males, joined the men in a dance to "[[I Will Follow Him]]".<ref name="Inmate 'Thriller' video is Web hit" /> "[[Hail Holy Queen]]", from ''[[Sister Act 2]]'', and the [[Algorithm March]] were also performed by the convicts and then upload onto YouTube.<ref name="Cebu inmates' 'Thriller' in Time most-watched list" /> The inmates dance in order to help pass the time while serving their prison sentences or awaiting a trial. More than 900 of the inmates take part in the routines, with a small group of dancers at the core of each performance. Every prisoner at CPDRC, apart from the old and the infirm, has a part in the routine. Garcia directs and choreographs each of the dances.<ref name="Boogie Behind Bars: Inmates Dance the Days Away" /><ref name="Jailhouse rocks: Philippine inmates' Thriller routine an internet hit"/> The inmates' participation is said to be completely voluntary, with no prisoner being forced to dance. "It would be different if they are being forced to dance", declared Rubio. "I've never known any prisoners being forced to dance. It's normal to dance."<ref name="Boogie Behind Bars: Inmates Dance the Days Away" /> The inmates have express pride at their performing success, and routinely query the viewing figures for their routines.<ref name="Jailhouse rocks: Philippine inmates' Thriller routine an internet hit"/> By August 2007, ten of the prisoners' performances had been viewed over 100,000 times each.<ref name="Filipino prison captures YouTube audience with dance">{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003829994_dance10.html?syndication=rss|title=Filipino prison captures YouTube audience with dance|last=Alexander|first=Paul|date=August 10, 2007|publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]''|accessdate=May 26, 2009}}</ref> In 2007, the prisoners stated that they were to perform to [[Vanilla Ice]]'s "[[Ice Ice Baby]]".<ref name="Philippine jailhouse rocks to Thriller" /><ref name="Jailhouse rocks: Philippine inmates' Thriller routine an internet hit"/> At the time, they were also practising [[Philip Oakey]] and [[Giorgio Moroder]]'s "[[Together in Electric Dreams]]", a homage to the inmates' fans.<ref name="Inmate 'Thriller' video is Web hit" />

In January 2008, Garcia requested that the prisoners perform their ''Thriller'' routine at the annual [[Sinulog festival]], a popular street-music festival organised by the Catholic Augustinian in celebration of [[baby Jesus]]. The nine-day fiesta and party is preceded by a solemn religious procession.<ref name="YouTube's dancing prisoners denied new licence to thrill">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/youtubes-dancing-prisoners-denied-new-licence-to-thrill-770911.html|title=YouTube's dancing prisoners denied new licence to thrill|last=Coonan|first=Clifford|date=January 18, 2008|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|accessdate=May 27, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Mayor not keen on inmates joining 'Sinulog'">{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/jan/03/yehey/prov/20080103pro1.html|title=Mayor not keen on inmates joining 'Sinulog'|date=(January 3, 2008)|publisher=''[[The Manila Times]]''|accessdate=May 27, 2009}}</ref> The mayor of Cebu, Tomas Osmena, refused to permit the request, stating that the inmates could dance all they wanted in jail. "I will not allow it even if Michael Jackson joins them", he commented.<ref name="YouTube's dancing prisoners denied new licence to thrill" /><ref name="Mayor not keen on inmates joining 'Sinulog'" /> Garcia had hoped that, by allowing the inmates to be a part of the Sinulog celebrations, Cebu would showcase the success of his rehabilitation programme. "By showing these highly disciplined inmates, perhaps we might just be giving hope that Cebu is not just about the mardi gras, but rather, Cebu is about leadership and good governance."<ref name="YouTube's dancing prisoners denied new licence to thrill" /><ref name="Mayor not keen on inmates joining 'Sinulog'" /> The CPDRC inmates were expected to be tough competition for the Lumad Basakonon, a group which has won the free interpretation category of the Sinulog festival for two consecutive years.<ref name="YouTube's dancing prisoners denied new licence to thrill" /><ref name="Mayor not keen on inmates joining 'Sinulog'" />

As a result of the prisoners' internet fame, many visitors come to CPDRC to view the monthly performances held by the convicts.

They can also buy souvenir prison shirts.<ref name="Philippines<U+2019> dancing jail <U+2014> everyone wants to go inside" /> A research student from The Netherlands, Anne Yzerman, attended one of the two-hour shows and praised the convicts. "They are so good at dancing all the time. I was really impressed."<ref name="Philippines<U+2019> dancing jail <U+2014> everyone wants to go inside" /> The CPDRC inmates dance numbers include a rendition of [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s "[[Holding Out for a Hero]]". The performance involves the inmates holding portraits of figures such as the [[Dalai Lama]], [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Mahatma Ghandi]].<ref name="Philippines<U+2019> dancing jail <U+2014> everyone wants to go inside" />
