'''Henry Luse Fuqua''' ([[November 8]], [[1865]] - [[October 11]], [[1926]]) was a [[Baton Rouge]] [[businessperson|businessman]] and the last [[Louisiana]] [[Governors of Louisiana|governor]] to have died in office. Fuqua defeated both [[Huey Long|Huey Pierce Long, Jr.]], and [[Lieutenant Governor]] (and former [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]]) [[Hewitt Leonidas Bouanchaud]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[gubernatorial]] primary in 1924 to succeed the term-limited [[John M. Parker]]. He died halfway into his term, and Lieutenant Governor [[Oramel H. Simpson]] succeeded to the top post. 

==Early years==

Fuqua was born in Baton Rouge to James Overton Fuqua and the former Jeanette Fowles. He was educated at Magruder's Collegiate Institute and [[Louisiana State University]], both in Baton Rouge. On [[June 4]], [[1890]], Fuqua married the former Laura Matta (1866-1968), and they had two children, Matta Fuqua and Henry L. Fuqua, Jr.

Prior to his entry into politics, Fuqua was the assistant to construction engineers of the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad. He was later a clerk and traveling salesman. He owned and operated his Fuqua [[Hardware]] Company in Baton Rouge from 1883-1922.

==Warden Fuqua==

In 1916, Fuqua became the [[warden]] of the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] at [[Angola, Louisiana|Angola]] in [[West Feliciana Parish]] (pronounced FE LEE SHE ANNA) north of Baton Rouge. He held the position until he became governor.

As warden, he terminated most of the security officers at the penitentiary and instead placed selected inmate trusty guards on duty, primarily as an economic measure but also to encourage cohesion among the inmates. Fuqua abolished  stripes on convict uniforms. The former prison in Baton Rouge was sold to the city and dismantled.

In 1922, a flood ruined the crops of numerous plantations about Angola for the third time in nearly a decade. The owners thereafter agreed to sell land to expand the prison. In a series of eight purchases over some eighteen months, Fuqua arranged the purchase of 10,000 acres (40 km<U+00B2>) at approximately $13 per acre. The acquistions brought the prison to its present size of 18,000 acres (73 km<U+00B2>).

==Fuqua as governor==

Governor Fuqua brought considerable managerial skill to the office, but his lack of political expertise hampered his efforts during his short term. He is remembered for his interest in [[levee]] and road construction and his fight against the resurgent [[Ku Klux Klan]], whom the preceding governor, [[John M. Parker]] had tried to counter as well.  The KKK had initially appeared in the year of Fuqua's birth, not in Louisiana, but in [[Pulaski, Tennessee]].

Louisiana's anti-Klan legislation secured harsh penalties to anyone wearing a mask or to anyone committing a crime while masked. An exception had to be made for the popular masked balls and masquerade parties popular during the celebration of [[Mardi Gras]].

He worked to increase the budget for his ''alma mater'', LSU, and to construct more buildings on the new campus in southern Baton Rouge. In a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] society, he also supported the expansion of the [[African American]] institution of higher education, [[Southern University]] in Baton Rouge.

He ran into trouble when he awarded the [[government-granted monopoly|franchise]] to build a [[toll bridge]] from east [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] to [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]] across [[Lake Pontchartrain]] to a private firm, the Watson-Williams syndicate, represented by former Governor [[Jared Y. Sanders, Sr.]]. Huey Long used this controversial decision in his successful campaign for governor in 1928, when he defeated both Fuqua's successor Simpson and [[U.S. Representative]] [[Riley J. Wilson]] from north Louisiana.

Fuqua was the last governor to have won the office on the strength of the New Orleans [[Choctaw Club]] [[political machine]].

==Fuqua's death==

Fuqua was [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]]. He was initially interred in Magnolia Cemetery in Baton Rouge, but his remains were later relocated to Roselawn Cemetery in Baton Rouge. Some sources spell Fuqua's middle name as "Luce". However, the grave marker is spelled "Luse".
