"'''Big Brother'''" is a song written by [[David Bowie]] in 1973 and intended for his never-produced musical based on [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. In 1974 it was released on the album ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''. It segued into the final track on the record, "[[Chant of the Ever Circling Skeletal Family]]".

Lyrically, the song reflects the ending of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', where [[Winston Smith]]'s brainwashing is complete, and he loves [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]].  This was described by Bowie biographer David Buckley as "a frightening paean to the Super God",<ref>David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination - David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': p.214</ref> while [[Nicholas Pegg]] considered that Bowie was showing how "the glamour of dictatorships is balanced with the banality".<ref name="Pegg">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': pp.38-39</ref> 

The opening trumpet line, played on a [[Chamberlin]], has been compared to [[Miles Davis]]' ''[[Sketches of Spain]]''.<ref>[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': p.64</ref> The melody in the chorus was echoed in Bowie's own "Shining Star (Makin' My Love)" from ''[[Never Let Me Down]]'' (1987).<ref name="Pegg"/>
