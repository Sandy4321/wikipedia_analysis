==Early life==
Morrison was born in the town of [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], [[Warwickshire]], where he was surrounded by the influence of his parents' record collection; his mother was a fan of [[Soul music|soul]] while his father enjoyed listening to [[Folk music|folk]] and [[Country music|country]].<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/james-morrison-p811597/biography|title=James Morrison Biography|last=Deming|first=Mark|work=Allmusic|accessdate=2011-01-23}}</ref> He began playing guitar when his uncle Joe showed him how to play a blues riff.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/moslive/article-1049350/James-Morrison-The-hard-man-rock.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | date=2 September 2008 | first=Simon | last=Lewis}}</ref> As a teenager he started [[busking]] when he lived in [[Porth, Cornwall|Porth]], [[Newquay]], Cornwall, in a local pub called the Phoenix, [[Watergate Bay]]. He used to practice playing his guitar on the prom looking over Porth beach. He took GCSE music at [[Treviglas Community College]]. After some years of covering other musicians' songs, he eventually started to write his own. He attributes his distinctive voice to a severe bout of [[whooping cough]] that nearly killed him when he was a baby.<ref>Speaking on [[Channel 4]] television show [[Richard & Judy]] on 13 February 2007</ref>

Morrison has alluded to an unhappy childhood affected by poverty and illness; he said of his hometown "the best thing is I've got memories of being a kid there and the worst thing is I've got memories of being a kid there."<ref name="Allmusic"/>  When Morrison was only a few weeks old, he contracted [[Whooping Cough|whooping cough]] and was given a 30% chance of survival from doctors, who believed that if he survived, he would be severely brain damaged.<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5192934.stm|title=James Morrison banishes the blues|last=Youngs|first=Ian|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=20 July 2006|accessdate=2011-01-23}}</ref>  He states that he "went blue and stopped breathing and [doctors] had to resuscitate me four times."<ref name="BBC News"/>  After the experience, his parents divorced when he was four years old and he suffered from low [[self esteem]] at school, where he was ostracized for being involved in music rather than sports.  He finally gained confidence when he moved to [[Cornwall]] as a teenager, where people were more accepting of his musical inclinations.<ref name="BBC News"/>

According to Morrison, he was influenced by music from a very young age, listening to artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Al Green]]. Morrison said that the first time he heard Stevie Wonder's voice he was close to tears, and has since been fascinated by the way he utilizes his voice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid3347410001/bclid3343046001/bctid3397640001 |title=James Morrison TV |publisher=Link.brightcove.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>

Working in [[Derby]], Morrison found an Irish bar called "Ryan's" which runs an open mic night on Wednesdays and Sundays. Morrison met Kev Andrews, who later produced Morrison's demo tape.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/content/articles/2006/07/31/james_morrison_interview_july_2006_feature.shtml|publisher=BBC Derby|title=James Morrison|date=31 July 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|work=The Times|title=Significant others|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6405332.ece|date=6 June 2009|location=London|first=Alexia|last=Skinitis}}</ref>

==Career==

===Breakthrough and ''Undiscovered''===
[[File:James Morrison.jpg||left|thumb|220px|Morrison on 24 June 2007 at the [[Glastonbury Festival]]]]
He achieved worldwide success with debut single "[[You Give Me Something]]", which reached #2 in Holland and the #5 spot in the UK. He released his debut album ''[[Undiscovered (James Morrison album)|Undiscovered]]'' on 31 July 2006. The album received generally positive reviews with ''The Sun'',<ref name="offical">[http://www.jamesmorrisonmusic.com James Morrison official website]</ref> claiming "There isn't a bad track on it".{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} An equally positive review by [[The Times]] stated that "Undiscovered may prove to be the least apposite album title for years". It topped the [[UK Albums Chart]] on its first week of its release. The album sold over 1 million copies around the world by the end of 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}, making Morrison the best selling male solo artist of 2006 in the UK.<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx6hOTct3dI&feature=related |title=James Morrison channel 4 part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=27 September 2008 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>

The album's second single was "[[Wonderful World (James Morrison song)|Wonderful World]]", which broke into the top ten in the UK following its CD single release, peaking at #8. The song fared just as well in the Netherlands where it peaked at #8. This was his second top ten single following the success of [[You Give Me Something]]. On 18 December 2006 Morrison's third single, "[[The Pieces Don't Fit Anymore]]" was released. It peaked at #30 in the UK. The fourth single from [[Undiscovered]] was the title song "[[Undiscovered (song)|Undiscovered]]" which was released on 13 March 2007. "Undiscovered" peaked at #63. The song fared better in the Netherlands where it peaked at #30.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acharts.us/song/11705 |title=James Morrison - The Pieces Don't Fit Anymore - Music Charts |publisher=Acharts.us |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>

Morrison was scheduled to play at the 2006 [[V Festival]], in one of the smaller tents there. The audience however, was much larger than expected and couldn't fit into the tent allocated for him. As a  result, he had a ten-minute set on the main stage before [[Hard-Fi]] came on (Weston Park). At the 2007 V Festival he played his full set on the main stage. He also performed "[[You Give Me Something]]" at the 2006 [[Royal Variety Performance]] before [[Prince Charles]] and The [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Duchess of Cornwall]]. He appeared on ''[[Live from Abbey Road]]'' following his live recording session at [[Abbey Road Studios]] on 5 January 2007.

Following the release of ''Undiscovered'', Morrison made his first appearance on national TV in the United States, at the ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' show, in addition to appearing on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'', on 16 March 2007, performing "You Give Me Something" with just guitar and Wurlitzer piano. The album debuted at #24 in the US with 24,000 copies in its first week.

In 2007 Morrison was nominated for 3 [[2007 BRIT Awards|BRIT Awards]] and won the ''Best British Male Solo Artist'' category.  (Other nominations were for the ''Best British Breakthrough Act'', ''Best British Single Shortlist''). On 4 April 2007, he was awarded the title of an AOL Breaker artist,<ref>[http://music.aol.com/franchise/breakers/winner-james-morrison AOL Breaker Winner: James Morrison]</ref> a contest that was voted by the British public.

At the [[Concert for Diana]] on 1 July 2007, he performed the songs "Wonderful World" and "You Give Me Something" in honour of [[Princess Diana]]. During the summer of 2007, Morrison headlined the Forestry Commission's Forest Tour. His fifth UK single, ''One Last Chance'' was released on 2 July 2007 as a download only. The video is being shown on [[The Hits]], [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]] and [[Smash Hits]] music channels. The video was shot in Canada in April 2007. On 29 November 2007, he performed in KL Convention Center for the Acoustic ''Live&Loud KL '07''; a music festival in Malaysia. Morrison performed alongside [[Rick Price]] and local singer Dayang Nurfaizah.

===''Songs for You, Truths for Me''===
[[File:James Morrison at the Newcastle Carling Academe.jpg|220px|right|Morrison playing at the Newcastle Carling Academe]]
Morrison collaborated with [[Jason Mraz]] on the track "Details in the Fabric" on Mraz's new studio album, ''[[We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.]]'', which was released on 13 May 2008.<ref>Jasonmraz.com <U+2013> [http://jasonmraz.shop.musictoday.com/Product.aspx?cp=418_13384&pc=JZ19COMBO We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things Jason Mraz Official Store Pre-Order ]</ref>

On 29 September 2008, Morrison's second album entitled ''[[Songs for You, Truths for Me]]'' was released. In the writing process for this album he worked with [[Ryan Tedder]], [[Martin Terefe]], Martin Brammer, [[Chris Braide]] and [[Steve Robson]]. The album also features a [[duet (music)|duet]] with [[Nelly Furtado]] entitled "Broken Strings" co-written with [[Fraser T Smith]] and Nina Woodford. From October 2008 until the end of the year Morrison has toured throughout Europe. The album performed well, debuting in the top three of the [[UK Albums Chart]] and spending 5 weeks in the top ten. When talking about the album, Morrison stated that the music had 'moved on' a lot from the first album but not to the point where fans of his previous album wouldn't be able to "get it".<ref name="youtube.com"/>

"You Make It Real" was released a week before the release of the album as the lead single. As part of the promotion, Morrison performed the single on [[GMTV]], Radio 1's Live Lounge and the BBC Children in Need charity appeal. The song debuted at number 7 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] giving Morrison his third top ten hit. "You Make It Real" spent a total of eight weeks on the chart. The second single of the album was "[[Broken Strings]]," the collaboration with Nelly Furtado. The single was released on 15 December 2008. It entered the singles charts at number 73 and slowly rose for four weeks before, following a performance of the song with [[Girls Aloud]] on [[The Girls Aloud Party]], broke into the top ten at number 6, giving Morrison his fourth top ten hit. The following week the song rose to a new high, rising to number 4 on the 2008 Christmas chart. This makes [[Broken Strings]] Morrison's most successful single by peak position to date in the UK as, on 11 January 2009 it climbed to number two, being held off the top spot by [[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]], the debut single from [[Lady Gaga]]. The song's highest entry was in Germany's Single Top 100 where it entered the chart at the top spot.

Following the success of Broken Strings, the album which had been gradually descending down the album chart, made a leap from number forty eight to twenty nine and then two weeks later, re-entered the top ten at number seven. It rose again the next week to number four and was charting at number five, twenty weeks after release. The same effect allowed ''Songs For You, Truths For Me'' to gain success in Ireland. After dropping off the [[Irish Albums Chart]] completely, it re-entered the chart at number seventy three. It rose for several weeks until it was charting at number thirteen. The next week the album climbed to the top of the chart, entering the top ten at number one. This gave ''Songs For You, Truths For Me'' its first number one chart placement and gave Morrison his second number one album.

On 30 April 2009, it was announced on [[Take That]]'s official site that Morrison would be supporting the band at some venues and dates on their 2009 tour. Morrison performed along with singer [[Gary Go]], in the Sunderland Stadium of Light on 5 June, the Coventry Ricoh Arena on 9 June, the Cardiff Millennium Stadium on 16 June and 17, the Glasgow Hampden Park on 20 June, the Manchester Old Trafford Cricket Ground on 26 June and in the London Wembley Stadium on 1 July.  That same year, Morrison wrote a song, "Watch and Wait", for the [[Germany|German]] [[comedy film]] ''[[Men in the City]]''.

In 2010 Morrison wrote a song called "Quello Che Dai" for the Italian singer [[Marco Carta]] from his upcoming album "Il Cuore Muove".  On 25 June 2010, Morrison performed a cover of [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Man In the Mirror]]'' live near the [[River Thames]] in London as part of CBS' ''[[The Early Show]]'' special remembrance event entitled "The King Of Pop: One Year Later."<ref>[http://foreign.peacefmonline.com/entertainment/201006/52010.php Peace FM Online: Morrison Sings on Michael Jackson Tribute]</ref> The song was released as a single on iTunes on 24 June 2010, and in the November 2009 European double CD re-issue of ''Songs For You, Truths For Me''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Songs for You Truths for Me (Deluxe Edition): James Morrison|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002TKTOPQ|publisher=[[Amazon.co.uk]]|date=16 Nov 2009}}</ref>

===''The Awakening''===
In 2010, Morrison announced that he had been working on his third studio album. In a June 2010 interview he stated "I've sung too many love ballads. I want to go a bit deeper than that and find more substance. I still don't feel confident enough to write by myself, but that is my aim. I just keep convincing myself that I'm not good enough. There are plenty of good singers out there <U+2013> it's writing that's the key thing. When I'm working with other people I've heard them say 'Let's try to write a James Morrison chorus.' I want to pretend that I haven't made any albums at all and start afresh."<ref name=Devon/>
Morrison has worked with [[Kara DioGuardi]] and [[Toby Gad]] for this album.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

He announced one of the tracks on the album might be called "The Awakening" saying, "I want to write about this idea of an awakening of some kind. I<U+2019>ve written a song with that title, which I<U+2019>m really happy with. There<U+2019>s some funky digeridoo going on".<ref name=Devon>{{cite web
