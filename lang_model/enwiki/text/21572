A '''foursome''' match is a competition between two teams each consisting of two [[golf]]ers. The golfers on the same team take alternate shots on each hole, with the same ball. One team-member tees off on odd-numbered holes, and the other tees off on even-numbered holes. A foursome is usually played as [[match play]], with each hole won by the team that completes it in the fewest shots, but can be played as [[stroke play]]. This form of golf is played in team golf competitions such as the [[Ryder Cup]], [[Seve Trophy]] and the [[Presidents Cup]].
