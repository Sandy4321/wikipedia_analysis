'''Pennsylvania Route 51''' (PA 51) is a major [[state highway]] in [[Western Pennsylvania]]. It runs for 89 miles from [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania|Uniontown]] to the [[Ohio]] state line near [[Darlington, Pennsylvania|Darlington]], where it connects with [[Ohio State Route 14]].  Route 51 is the termination point for [[Pennsylvania Route 43]], [[Pennsylvania Route 48]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 88]].  [[Century III Mall]] is located on this road in [[West Mifflin|West Mifflin]].  The Route is a major connection from Uniontown and the rest of [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette County]] to [[Pittsburgh, PA|Pittsburgh]].

The highway is four-lane highway south of [[Pittsburgh]] as it passes through Pittsburgh's [[South Hills (Pennsylvania)|South Hills]], but narrows to a two-lane road through several boroughs along the [[Ohio River]].  It becomes four lanes again after passing [[Racine, PA|Racine]] in [[Beaver County, PA|Beaver County]] and continues to the Ohio border.  In the South Hills, Route 51 (Saw Mill Run Blvd.), along with [[US 19 (PA)|US 19]], is one of the major routes in and out of Pittsburgh, as it provides access to several bridges and tunnels.  Route 51 is one of the highways that enters the West End Circle, an intersection in the [[West End (Pittsburgh)|West End]].

==Route description==
===Fayette County===
PA 51 begins as Pittsburgh Street in downtown [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania|Uniontown]] at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 40 Business (Uniontown, Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 40 Business]]. As Route 51 heads north, it exits Uniontown and intersects with [[U.S. Route 119]], Uniontown's [[bypass (road)|bypass]]. North of US 119, PA 51 is a rural, multi-lane [[divided highway]] that is also known as Pittsburgh Road. In [[North Union Township, Pennsylvania|North Union Township]], Route 51 divides for 0.7 miles; the road has a large median that is home to several businesses. It then shifts towards the northwest, continuing as a multi-lane divided highway. In [[Perry Township, Pennsylvania|Perry Township]], PA 51 intersects [[Pennsylvania Route 201]] at a [[cloverleaf interchange]]. North of PA 201, it enters the borough of [[Perryopolis, Pennsylvania|Perryopolis]] as Fuller Drive; after leaving the city to the north, PA 51 begins to parallel the [[Youghiogheny River]].<ref>{{cite map|title=PA 51 in Fayette County|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=Pittsburgh+St.+%26+Main+St.,+Uniontown,+PA&daddr=40.128688,-79.774475&hl=en&geocode=&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=14&sll=40.130132,-79.768381&sspn=0.049678,0.076904&ie=UTF8&ll=40.030769,-79.735336&spn=0.398001,0.615234&z=11|publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref>

At the southern tip of [[Pittsburgh]], PA 51 intersects the northern terminus of [[Pennsylvania Route 88]] before continuing towards the north as Saw Mill Run Blvd. It meets with the [[Liberty Tunnel]] connector, which leads towards the [[Liberty Bridge]] and [[Interstate 579]]; PA 51 also begins a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 19 Truck (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 19 Truck]] at this junction. The US 19 Truck/PA 51 concurrency ends when US 19 TRK joins [[Interstate 279]], [[U.S. Route 22]], and [[U.S. Route 30]] at exit 5. PA 51 also begins a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 19]], with which it combines to under the name Saw Mill Boulevard, a short expressway in [[Pittsburgh]]'s [[West End (Pittsburgh)|West End]] section. The US 19/PA 51 concurrency ends at the infamous West End Circle. Heading toward [[McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania|McKees Rocks]], Route 51 continues towards the northwest as Carson Street, paralleling the [[Ohio River]]. Entering McKees Rocks, it makes a 90 degree turn to become Locust Street, then makes another turn to become Chartier Street, and makes a final turn towards the northwest to become Island Avenue. In [[Stowe Township, Pennsylvania|Stowe Township]], PA 51 becomes Robinson Boulevard and passes south of [[Neville Island]] on the Ohio River. After a couple of [[S-curve]]s, Route 51 becomes Coraopolis Road and intersects [[Interstate 79]] at exit 64. It becomes States Avenue in in [[Coraopolis, Pennsylvania|Coraopolis]] before dividing into two [[one-way]] streets called 4th and 5th Avenues. North of Coraopolis, PA 51 continues to parallel the Ohio River as University Boulevard in [[Moon Township, Pennsylvania|Moon Township]]. It then becomes Stoops Ferry Road and passes through Crescent Township on McGovern Road.<ref>{{cite map|title=PA 51 in Pittsburgh and northern Allegheny County|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=McGovern+Blvd%2FPA-51&daddr=Island+Ave%2FPA-51+to:40.456352,-80.04364+to:PA-51%2FRoute+51%2FSaw+Mill+Run+Blvd&hl=en&geocode=Fab2agIdtM03-w%3BFTq-aQIdNjA6-w%3B%3BFUwmaAIdlGI7-w&mra=dpe&mrcr=0&mrsp=2&sz=11&via=1,2&sll=40.486126,-80.051193&sspn=0.233439,0.475159&ie=UTF8&z=11|publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref>

==History==
Route 51 was first signed in 1927.  The north section was signed first, followed by the section between Pittsburgh and Uniontown.  Major constuction projects included a bypass of Perryopolis built in 1950, the West End Bypass in Pittsburgh that was completed in 1953, and the interchange at the southern portal of the Liberty Tunnels in Pittsburgh. <ref name="pah">{{cite web|url=http://www.pahighways.com/state/PA51-100.html|title=Pennsylvania Route 51|publisher=Pennsylvania Highways |last=Kitsko|first=Jeffrey J.|accessdate=2008-10-07}}</ref> 

The Saw Mill Run Boulevard section of the highway was the first direct connection between Pittsburgh and the South Hills once the Liberty Tunnel was completed.  It significantly decreased the driving time to Pittsburgh from the cities of Clairton, Duquesne, [[McKeesport, PA|McKeesport]]. <ref name="prince">{{cite web|url=http://www.gribblenation.com/swparoads/smr/SMR.html|title=Saw Mill Run Blvd--A History|last=Prince|first=Adam|publisher=GribbleNation|accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref>

Improvements are planned at the intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 88|PA 88]] south of Pittsburgh, where bottlenecks occur regularly.  Other improvements planned include new interchanges at the Liberty Tunnel and West End Bridge (West End Cirlce), a center median for the rest of Saw Mill Run Boulevard, and an improved intersection with Woodruff Street.<ref name="prince">{{cite web}}</ref>

===Saw Mill Run Expressway (cancelled)===
The Saw Mill Run Expressway was a proposed highway proposed in the South Hills.  It would have been built on the same right-of-way as Saw Mill Run Boulevard.  In 1964, while designated as "the worst bottleneck in Western Pennsylvania", a plan was made to turn the crowded highway into an expressway.  The plan was proposed to the [[Pennsylvania Department of Highways|Department of Highways]] and included a renovation of the Liberty Tunnel, several widening projects, new turning lanes, and a central median.  The plan would have required much cooperation from the surrounding communities.

The finished product was to include a 5.5 mile limited access expressway from [[Overbrook, Pennsylvania|Overbrook]] to the West End.  It would have been twice the width of the current highway and had a total cost of nearly $150 million.  Interest in the expressway declined once the [[Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Planning Commission]] expressed concerns about business along the corridor, and the project was dropped in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pittsburgh Highways: Saw Mill Run Expressway (Cancelled)|publisher=Pennsylvania Highways |url=http://pittsburgh.pahighways.com/expressways/cancelled/smrexpressway.html|last=Kitsko|first=Jeffrey J.|accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref>
