'''Kate Ellen Louisa Cutler''' (14 August 1864 <U+2013> 14 May 1955) was an English singer and actress, known in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as an ''[[ingenue (stock character)|ing<U+00E9>nue]]'' in [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedies]], and later as a character actress in comic and dramatic plays.  She is possibly best known for walking out of the lead role in [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]]'s ''[[The Vortex]]'' in 1924 shortly before opening night.

==Early years==
Cutler was born in [[Marylebone]], London, daughter of Henry Cutler, a singer, and his wife Mary Ann, ''n<U+00E9>e'' Tims.<ref name=dnb>[[Kurt G<U+00E4>nzl|G<U+00E4>nzl, Kurt]]. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/62592 "Cutler, Kate Ellen Louisa (1864<U+2013>1955)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 29 May 2009</ref> She trained at a conservatoire in [[Watford]], north of London, where one of her tutors described her as "an ideal Cherubino" in [[Mozart]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary notice, 18 May 1955, p.13</ref> Her career, however, took her not into opera, but into [[operetta]] and then [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]].

==Musical stage==
In 1888 she appeared in London at [[Toole's Theatre]] as Inez in [[Charles Lecocq]]'s ''Pepita'', and the following year created the role of Malaguene in [[Robert Planquette]]'s ''Paul Jones''.<ref name=times/> Her debut in musical comedy was in [[George Edwardes]]'s ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in 1893, in a small ''ing<U+00E9>nue'' role and later deputising for the star, [[Florence St. John]].<ref name=dnb/><ref name=times/>  Later that year, she was similarly cast as Lady Edytha Aldwyn in ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'', also covering for and later succeeding [[Decima Moore]] in the lead role.  In 1895, she was a replacement player in the title role in ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' at the Gaiety<ref name=WhosW>[http://www.archive.org/details/whoswhointhethea011179mbp ''Who's Who in the Theatre: A Biographical Record of the Contemporary Stage''], pp. 224<U+2013>25, John Parker (ed.), Small, Maynard & Company, Inc. (1925)</ref> and appeared in ''[[Gentleman Joe]]'' at the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] and as Connie in ''All Abroad'' at the [[Criterion Theatre]].<ref name=WhosW/>

The same year, Cutler played the title role, Trilby, in ''A Model Trilby; or, A Day or Two After Du Maurier'', by [[Charles H. E. Brookfield]] and [[William Yardley]], with music by [[Meyer Lutz]], produced at the [[Opera Comique]] by the retired [[Nellie Farren]].  The piece was a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of the [[Haymarket Theatre]]'s hit adaptation of [[George Du Maurier]]'s popular novel, ''[[Trilby (novel)|Trilby]]''.  ''[[The Times]]'' thought that Cutler was "winsome and engaging".<ref>''The Times'', 18 November 1895, p.3</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that she was "the best and most willing of all the Trilbys, an actress of real charm.   Whenever she warbles a sweet little melody, or prides herself on her string of lovers, or whistles a plaintive refrain, the new Trilby is from first to last attractive and delightful".<ref>''The Daily Telegraph'', 18 November 1895</ref>  In 1896, she played Dorothy in ''[[Monte Carlo (musical)|Monte Carlo]] at the [[Avenue Theatre]].<ref name=WhosW/>

After playing such junior roles in musical comedies, Cutler achieved star status as the title character, Suzette, in ''[[The French Maid]]'' in 1897, followed by further successes as Elsie Crockett in ''Little Miss Nobody'' the following year, Catarma in ''L' Amour Mouille'' in 1899<ref name=WhosW/> and Angela in ''[[Florodora]]'' that same year.  In April 1900, Cutler married her first husband, Sidney Ellison, who was the director and choreographer of ''Florodora''.<ref>[[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Lamb, Andrew]].  ''Leslie Stuart: Composer of Floradora'', p. 93, Routledge (2002) ISBN 0-415-93747-7</ref> The marriage was unsuccessful, and they separated before his death in 1930.<ref name=dnb/>  She next played Victoria Chaffers in ''H.M.S. Irresponsible'' in 1901.<ref name=WhosW/>

Cutler's other successes in this period included ''[[A Chinese Honeymoon]]'' (as a replacement in the role of Princess Soo-Soo in 1902), Norah Chalmers in ''[[The Girl from Kays]]'' (1902), Grace Rockingham in ''The Love Birds'' (1904) and Victoire in ''A Man's Shadow''.  She played this role in a Command Performance at [[Windsor Castle]] on 17 November 1904.<ref name=WhosW/>  The next year, she originated the role of Baroness Papouche in ''[[The Spring Chicken]]'' (1905).<ref name=dnb/><ref name=times/>  Her appearances in musical comedy were well received, with ''[[The Times]]'' commenting, "Miss Cutler may be depended upon to make the most of what she undertakes&nbsp;...  A soothing tint of freshness in a great deal of blare and noise".<ref>''The Times'', 6 April 1899, p. 4; and 11 February 1904, p. 4</ref>  While appearing in ''The Spring Chicken'', Cutler took a special omnibus every day, between acts, from the Gaiety Theatre to the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], where she appeared for 20 minutes in ''Hero and Heroine''.  The bus contained a dressing room in which she changed from one costume to another each way on the short journey.<ref>''The Daily Mirror'', 26 January 1906, p. 8</ref>

==Comedy and character roles==
After 1905, Cutler gave up the musical stage and concentrated on comic plays. She appeared with [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] as Felise in a revival of ''The Red Lamp'' and as Lady Stutfield in ''[[A Woman of No Importance]]'' in 1907.  In 1908, she played Peggy in ''All-of-a-Sudden Peggy'', played Nan in ''Good for Nothing'', toured as Dorothy in ''Her Son'', and had a success as Madame Henriette in ''Bellamy the Magnificent''.  These were followed by roles too numerous to name over the next fifteen years.  She played both in English classics, such as ''[[The Rivals]]'', and in new works by [[Somerset Maugham]] and [[Max Beerbohm]], co-starring with [[Charles Hawtrey (stage actor)|Charles Hawtrey]], [[Marie Lohr]], [[Lewis Waller]] and [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]], among others.<ref name=WhosW/> 

In the 1920s, Cutler, by then in her late fifties,<ref>''The Times'' obituary gave her date of birth as 1870, but the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' states that Cutler falsified her age and was born in 1864</ref> continued to play a varied and busy schedule of leading and character roles appropriate for her age.<ref name=WhosW/>  She is perhaps most remembered, however, for one that she did not play.  Cast as the nymphomaniac mother in [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]]'s early play ''[[The Vortex]]'' (1924), she pulled out of the role less than a week before the piece was due to open, upset by a last-minute rewrite that she believed diminished her role.<ref>[http://www.thecnj.com/review/2008/022808/feature022808_01.html?headline=The_blood_and_guts_of_Coward "The blood and guts of Coward",] ''Camden New Journal'', accessed 1 June 2009</ref> Coward managed to recruit [[Lilian Braithwaite|Dame Lilian Braithwaite]] to take on the role. The play was a sensational success, with Cutler, as Coward said, throwing away one of the best opportunities of her life.<ref>Coward, p. 177</ref> Cutler subsequently had good roles in classic and new plays, including ''[[The Country Wife]]'', and ''Dear Octopus''. 

Cutler also performed in films between 1929 and 1938, including ''[[Such Is the Law (1930 film)|Such Is the Law]]'' (1930), ''[[The Great Gay Road (1931 film)|The Great Gay Road]]'' (1931), ''[[Lord of the Manor (film)|Lord of the Manor]]'' (1933), ''[[Come Out of the Pantry]]'' (1935) and ''[[Moscow Nights (film)|Moscow Nights]]'' (1935).  Her last film was ''[[Pygmalion (1938 film)|Pygmalion]]'' in 1938.<ref name=dnb/> ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' said of her in an obituary notice, "She proved that an actress who can play the lead in musical comedy can go on to play the lead in anything else.&nbsp;...  She was a really accomplished actress with that indefinable quality which we call style."<ref>''The Manchester Guardian'', 18 May 1955, p. 4</ref>

Cutler's second husband, Major Charles Dudley Ward, predeceased her. She died at her home in London, age 90.<ref name=dnb/>
