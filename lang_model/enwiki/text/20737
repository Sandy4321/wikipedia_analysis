'''Roger Anthony Black''' <small>[[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]</small> (born 31 March 1966) is a retired [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Athletics (sport)|athlete]]. During his athletics career, he won individual silver medals in the [[400 metres]] sprint at both the [[Olympic Games]] and [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]], two individual gold medals at the [[European Championships in Athletics|European Championships]], and [[4x400 metres relay]] gold medals at both the World and European Championships. Since retiring from athletics, he has worked as a [[television presenter]] and motivational speaker.

==Early life==
Born in [[Portsmouth]], [[England]], to David (a doctor) and Thelma, with a twin sister Julia, he attended [[Portsmouth Grammar School]], becoming Head Boy in 1983/84.  Black has a collection of fifteen medals from major senior athletics competitions to add to his two [[Europe]]an junior championship [[gold medal]]s, including his 1996 Olympic silver which he keeps on his person at all times.

==Athletics career==
He set the national 400 [[metre]] record of 44.37 [[second]]s on 3 July 1996 in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] but that was subsequently broken a year later by [[Iwan Thomas]] who shaved 0.01s from Black's time. Fellow GB athlete [[Mark Richardson (athlete)|Mark Richardson]] also equalled Black's mark in 1998. Black's time stands as the second fastest of all time recorded by a British runner. 
Black was also part of the British 4 x 400 relay team which upset the strong favourites USA to win the gold medal in the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo.

Black came second in the individual 400m in Tokyo to [[Antonio Pettigrew]]. Pettigrew later admitted the use of performance enhancing drugs from 1997 onwards in June 2008. No clear evidence has emerged - and neither has Pettigrew admitted - using performance enhancing drugs during the 1991 season. 

His greatest individual achievement in track and field was in the [[1996 Olympics]] in Atlanta when in the final of the 400m he finished in second place behind [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]], winning the silver medal in the process.  However, partly due to injuries, he never rediscovered this form, and subsequently retired from the sport only two years later in 1998 after winning gold in the 1997 World Championships 4 x 400 relay.

Black was coached by Mike Smith and Mike Whittingham, and was sponsored by [[Reebok]].

==1997 World Championships==

The World Championships' 4x400m originally saw the USA beat Great Britain by 0.18 seconds in a thrilling finale.  Subsequently, [[Antonio Pettigrew]] admitted to using performance enhancing substances during this period.

On the 7th January 2010, it was announced that Great Britain's 1997 World Championship 4x400m relay team are to be awarded the gold medal due to the disqualification of the USA team.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/8445003.stm</ref>

==Awards==
In 1995 [[Southampton University]] gave Black an [[honorary degree]] and he was also rewarded by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] with an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]].

==Television career==

In 1998 Black appeared on the children's news programme ''[[Newsround]]'' with fellow athlete [[Iwan Thomas]] reporting on childhood obesity. 

Black has worked regularly for the [[BBC]] on programmes such as ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' and ''[[Grandstand (BBC)|Grandstand]]''. In 2004 he was one of the celebrities that took part in the pro-am dancing contest [[Strictly Come Dancing]] on [[BBC One]]. In September 2006, he took part in [[BBC One]]'s ''[[Celebrity MasterChef]]'' programme, reaching the final along with [[Matt Dawson]] and [[Hardeep Singh Kohli]].

==Writing==
Black has written an autobiography, published by Andre Deutsch, entitled ''How Long's the Course?'', ISBN 0-233-99644-3

==Personal life==
Black has been married twice: formerly to French (Martiniquan) athlete Elsa de Vassoigne, with whom he has a daughter, Isabelle (marriage dissolved by divorce), and currently to Julia Burgess, with whom he had twins boys George and Max in 2006.

Despite being born in Portsmouth, Black is a supporter of [[Southampton FC]].
