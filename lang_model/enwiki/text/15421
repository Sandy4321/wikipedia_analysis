'''Griffith Observatory''' is located in [[Los Angeles, California]], [[United States]].
Sitting on the south-facing slope of Mount Hollywood in L.A.'s [[Griffith Park]], it commands a view of the [[Los Angeles Basin]], including [[downtown Los Angeles]] to the southeast, [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to the south, and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the southwest. The [[observatory]] is a popular tourist attraction that features an extensive array of [[space]]- and [[science]]-related displays.

==History==
[[Image:Griffith Observatory south elevation 2006.jpg|300px|thumb|right|View from a trail in [[Griffith Park]] from the south, looking north.]]
The land on which the observatory stands was donated to the City of Los Angeles by Col. [[Griffith J. Griffith]] in 1896. In his will, Griffith donated funds to build an observatory, exhibit hall, and [[planetarium]] on the donated land. Construction began on [[June 20]], [[1933]] using a design developed by architect John C. Austin based on preliminary sketches by [[Russell W. Porter]]. The observatory and accompanying exhibits were opened to the public on [[May 14]], [[1935]]. In its first five days of operation the observatory logged more than 13,000 visitors. [[Dinsmore Alter]] was the museum's director during its first years. Today, Dr. Ed Krupp is the Director of the Observatory.

==Exhibits==
The first exhibit visitors encountered in 1935 was the [[Foucault pendulum]], which was designed to demonstrate the rotation of the Earth. The exhibits also included a twelve-inch (305 mm)  [[Zeiss]] telescope, a solar telescope, and a thirty-eight foot relief model of the moon's north polar region.

Col. Griffith requested that the observatory include a display on evolution which was accomplished with the Cosmochron exhibit which included a narration from [[Caltech]] Professor Chester Stock and an accompanying slide show. The evolution exhibit existed from 1937 to the mid 1960s.

Also included in the original design was a planetarium. The first shows covered topics including the Moon, worlds of the [[solar system]], and eclipses.

During World War II the planetarium was used to train pilots in celestial navigation. The planetarium was again used for this purpose in the 1960s to train [[Apollo program]] astronauts for the first lunar missions.

The planetarium theater was renovated in 1964 and a Mark IV [[Zeiss]] projector was installed.

===Renovation and expansion===
[[Image:GriffithObservatory renovations model.jpg|thumb|A model showing the new underground exhibits]]
The observatory closed in 2002 for renovation and a major expansion of exhibit space. It reopened to the public on [[November 3]], [[2006]], retaining its [[art deco]] exterior. The $93 million renovation, paid largely by a public bond issue, restored the building, as well as replaced the aging planetarium dome. The building was expanded underground, with completely new exhibits<ref name="bdepthsofspace1">{{cite web|url=http://www.lacity.org/rap/observatory/exhibits/bdepthsofspace.html |title=Griffith Observatory Building Features-Gunther Depths of Space |publisher=Lacity.org |date= |accessdate=2009-02-05}}</ref>, a caf<U+00E9>, gift shop, and the new [[Leonard Nimoy]] Event Horizon Theater<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacity.org/rap/observatory/bnimoy.html |title=Griffith Observatory - Building Features: The Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon |publisher=Lacity.org |date= |accessdate=2009-02-05}}</ref>. The Caf<U+00E9> at the End of the Universe, an homage to [[Restaurant at the End of the Universe]], is one of the many caf<U+00E9>s run by [[celebrity chef]] [[Wolfgang Puck]].

The 1964-vintage Zeiss Mark IV star projector was replaced with a Zeiss Mark IX Universarium<ref>{{cite news|last=Broder |first=John M. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/11/us/11griffith.html?ex=1305000000&en=f6023408275065e1&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |title=Observatory Reopens in Fall - New York Times |location=Los Angeles (Calif) |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2006-05-11 |accessdate=2009-02-05}}</ref>. The former planetarium projector is part of the underground exhibit on ways in which humanity has visualized the skies.

Since the observatory opened in 1935, admission has been free, in accordance with Griffith's will. Admission to the museum continues to be free. Tickets for the show [[Centered in the Universe]] in the 290-seat Samuel Oschin Planetarium Theater are purchased separately at the box office within the observatory. Tickets are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. 

Children under 5 are free, but are admitted to only the first planetarium show of the day.  Only members of the observatory's support group, Friends Of The Observatory<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.friendsoftheobservatory.com/popup-benefits.asp |title=Benefit Popup-Friends of the Observatory |publisher=Friendsoftheobservatory.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-05}}</ref>, may reserve tickets for the planetarium show.

[[Centered in the Universe]] features a high-resolution immersive video projected by an innovative laser system developed by [[Evans and Sutherland]] Corporation, along with a short night sky simulation projected by the Zeiss Universarium. A team of animators worked more than two years to create the 30-minute program. Actors, holding a glowing orb, perform the presentation, under the direction of Chris Shelton.

A wildfire in the hills came dangerously close to the observatory on [[May 10]], [[2007]].<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/05/09/la.fire/index.html Firefighters get L.A. blaze under control - CNN.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=February 2009}}</ref>

==Popular culture references==

;Comics
The [[James Dean]] memorial at the Griffith Observatory is an important landmark that memorializes Dean's classic movie [[Rebel without a Cause]].

In Bill Griffith's comic strip [[Zippy the Pinhead]], the cynical Griffy can occasionally be found in Griffith Observatory, aiming its telescope down into the valley to afford himself a view of the comings and goings in Hollywood.

;Video games
In the ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' video game this landmark is featured and is very similar to the real life Griffith Observatory. The observatory is a playable area in the ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines]]'' video game. Also, in the [[Future Cop: LAPD]] video game, the observatory and the whole Griffitth Park are the setting for the first mission of the game, on which the observatory was taken over a villain and turned the telescopes into plasma cannons.

;Music
The song ''Observatory Crest'' by [[Captain Beefheart]] may refer to the location of the Griffith Observatory. The song includes the lyric "...drive up / and watch the city / from Observatory Crest."

;Other
A [[Lego]] model of this building is on permanent exhibit at [[Legoland California]] in the Southern California section of Miniland. It has also been featured in the comic strip "Spiderman."<ref>http://www.chron.com/apps/comics/buildcp.mpl?c=130&page=1&date=2006/11/18&cpp=8&v=3.0&quality=high</ref> 
In "Macross Frontier," Episode 03, two characters hold a conversation in a future replica of the Griffith Observatory.

;Movies
In the movie [[Bowfinger]] with Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy, film producer Bowfinger (Martin) has been secretly filming a movie without Kit Ramsey (Murphy) knowing about it.  The film climaxes  as Ramsey is running through the Griffith observatory.  The camera crew follows him by filming the shots from the surveillance room, trying to catch him saying the phrase, "Gotcha Suckers!" to end the film.

;TV Shows
In the [[Star Trek Voyager]] episode [[Future's End]], Voyager is pushed back in time to 1996, to try and correct errors to the time line.  Rain Robinson, played by [[Sarah Silverman]] is working for the [[SETI]] project in the Griffith Observatory, and notices Voyager in orbit, and tries to contact them with the standard SETI greeting, and eventually helps the crew to recover what was stolen, and escape from earth.
