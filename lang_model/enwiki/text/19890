}}'''St Chad's Church''' is an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church in [[Poulton-le-Fylde]], a town on [[the Fylde]] coastal plain in [[Lancashire]], England. It is an active [[Church of England parish church|parish church]] in the [[Diocese of Blackburn]] and the [[archdeaconry]] of Lancaster. It has been designated a Grade II* [[listed building]] by English Heritage. A church on the site was built no later than the 11th century and may have existed prior to the [[Norman conquest of England]]. The tower dates from the 17th century, and much of the remainder of the building from a major renovation in the 18th century, although some of the fabric of the original structure remains. Further renovation and additions took place in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.

Soon after the Norman conquest, Poulton was granted to [[Lancaster Priory]]. In the 15th century, the church was given by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] to [[Syon Monastery]] in Middlesex. It returned to the Crown following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and from the 16th to the 20th century, the [[advowson]] (the right to appoint a parish priest){{ref|a|A}} belonged to the Hesketh/Fleetwood family.

The red sandstone building is faced with grey [[ashlar]] and consists of a [[nave]], [[chancel]], square tower and a Norman-style [[apse]]. Its furnishings include a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] staircase, a [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] pulpit, box pews and [[hatchment]]s. There are eight bells in the tower. Outside the church are the remains of a stone [[preaching cross]].
==History==
There has probably been a church on the site of the present St Chad's since before the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066,<ref name=HistoricSurvey14 /> and there is written evidence of one from 1094. The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086 mentioned three churches in the [[List of hundreds of England and Wales|hundred]] of [[Amounderness]], although they were not named. Later documentary evidence suggests that they were probably the churches at Poulton, [[Kirkham, Lancashire|Kirkham]] and [[St Michael's on Wyre]].<ref name=Bagley178 /><ref name=Porter32 /> The dedication of Poulton's church to 7th century Anglo-Saxon saint [[Chad of Mercia]] lends weight to its pre-conquest foundation, although it is possible that it was built between 1086 and 1094.<ref name=Storey10 /><ref name=Porter188 />

The first documentary evidence of Poulton's church dates from 1094. After the conquest Amounderness, which included Poulton, was among the lands given by [[William the Conqueror]] to an [[Anglo-Norman]] knight named [[Roger the Poitevin]]. In 1094, Roger founded the [[Benedictine]] [[Lancaster Priory|priory of St. Mary]] at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]],<ref name=Porter32 /> as an offshoot of the Abbey of St. Martin in [[S<U+00E9>es]], [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]].<ref name=Porter188 /> He endowed the priory with the church and land at Poulton, approximately {{Convert|20|mi}} away.<ref name=Porter32 /><ref name=Storey11 /> Roger was eventually banished from the country and his possessions reverted to the Crown. In 1194 the hundred of Amounderness was given by King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] to [[Theobald Walter, 1st Baron Butler]] who became the [[High Sheriff of Lancashire]].<ref name=Porter33 /> Though the [[advowson]] of Poulton (the right to select a parish priest) had been granted by Roger to the monks of Lancaster, Theobald initially thought that it should be included in his entitlements.<ref name=Fox5to6 />{{ref|a|A}} In 1196 he [[quitclaimed|relinquished his right]] to Poulton (along with that of [[Bispham, Blackpool|Bispham]]), although he kept the advowsons of [[City of Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and Kirkham.<ref name=Farrer /><ref name=Bulpit3 />

In 1275 the Lancaster monks installed a vicar at the church.<ref name=Fishwick38 /> In 1291, taxation assessments made on behalf of [[Pope Nicholas IV]] valued St Chad's at <U+00A3>68 13s 4d<U+2014>the third richest church in Lancashire.<ref name=Fox7 /> In 1345, repairs to the [[chancel]] were ordered in a letter from Simon de Bekyngham of [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]] to Sir William, the [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] of Amounderness.<ref name=Bulpit3 /><ref name=Fishwick38 />

In 1415, King [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] dissolved the [[alien priories]] (those under control of religious houses abroad) and the church at Poulton reverted to the Crown. It was given by Henry to [[Syon Monastery]] in Middlesex.<ref name=Fishwick39 /> At the time of the [[English Reformation]] in the 16th century, St Chad's became the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] parish church.<ref name=Fox12 /> Originally, the parish included Poulton, [[Carleton, Lancashire|Carleton]], [[Thornton, Lancashire|Thornton]], [[Hardhorn-with-Newton]] and [[Marton, Blackpool|Marton]].<ref name=Farrer /> The Syon Monastery was suppressed in 1539 during [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and St Chad's again returned to the Crown's possession.<ref name=Fishwick41 /> In the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (after a brief restoration of Syon by [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]), the advowson was granted to John Fleetwood of [[Penwortham]].<ref name=Fox7 /> The Fleetwood family remained the patrons of St Chad's until the early 20th century.<ref name=Storey59 />

Some time in the 17th century, the present tower was built, possibly during [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reign.<ref name=Hartwell /<ref name=Fishwick44 /> In 1751 the church was extensively renovated. It was previously thought that the old church (except the tower) was completely demolished but recent evidence indicates that the "new" building still contains the outer walls of the previous structure.<ref name=Storey36 /><ref name=Hartwell /> These original walls, of red [[sandstone]], were faced with grey [[ashlar]].<ref name=Storey36 /> The nave was rebuilt in 1753 with money from Richard Hesketh of [[Meols]] and his wife Margaret (the daughter of Richard Fleetwood).<ref name=Champness />
[[File:St Chad's Church, Poulton-le-Fylde apse and crocuses.jpg|thumb|The [[apse]] of St Chad's, added in 1868]]
By the 19th century, the graveyard was full and had become a public health concern. It was overrun with rats, and dogs chasing the rats, both of which were damaging the churchyard. Finding sufficient ground for new burials was increasingly difficult and bones were often removed to a nearby [[charnel house]]. In 1849, an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish. In 1884, the churchyard was closed to all burials and a [[cemetery]] was opened in the town.<ref name=Storey86 />{{ref|b|B}}

A round [[Norman architecture|Norman]]-style [[apse]] was added to the church in 1868.<ref name=Hartwell /> The incumbent, the Rev. Thomas Clarke, paid for this addition, but died before its construction was complete.<ref name=Fox17 /> Architect [[J.&nbsp;S. Crowther]] oversaw further alterations in 1881<U+2013>83;<ref name=Hartwell /> a [[baptistery]] was built, the organ was moved and [[choir stalls]] were built in the chancel.<ref name=Fox17 /> Some work was done to the interior of the tower in 1908.<ref name=Farrer /> Renovations in 1955 included the addition of a central [[aisle]] and the removal of some of the church furnishings.<ref name=Fox17 /> The Victorian pulpit was replaced.<ref name=Storey115 /> A small extension was added north of the tower in 2005.<ref name=Hartwell />

The advowson to Poulton, which had been in the possession of the Fleetwood/Hesketh family for approximately 400 years, was sold in 1934 by Major Charles Fleetwood-Hesketh to the [[Diocese of Blackburn]].<ref name=Storey61 />

==Architecture==
===Exterior===
[[File:St Chad's Church, Poulton-le-Fylde, Doorway - geograph.org.uk - 964673.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The entrance to the Fleetwood family vault]]
The outer walls of the church are constructed of red sandstone with grey [[ashlar]] dressings; the roofs are [[slate]].<ref name=EH /><ref name=Fox15 /> The church plan consists of a [[nave]], with a square tower to the west and a [[chancel]] and [[apse|apsidal]] [[sanctuary]] to the east. There is a clergy [[vestry]] at the south-east corner of the building.<ref name=Fox32 />

The tower at the west end of the church dates from the early 17th century.<ref name=Champness /> It sits next to the south-west corner of the nave, aligned with the south wall, because the former church plan included a north aisle;<ref name=Hartwell /> the north wall of the tower meets the nave at its roof ridge.<ref name=EH /> It is [[Battlement|castellated]] and constructed of [[Course (architecture)|coursed]] roughly-dressed stone. It has two diagonal [[buttress]]es, two angled buttresses and four corner [[pinnacle]]s. There are slate [[Bell tower|belfry]] [[louver|louvres]] on each side of the tower and clock faces on the north and south sides.<ref name=Farrer /><ref name=EH />

A small stone porch towards the east end of the south wall leads to the Fleetwood family [[Burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]]. The doorway is inscribed with "Insignia Rici Fleetwood an hujus eccliae patronis, Anno Dni 1699".<ref name=Farrer />{{ref|c|C}} There are two more doorways on the south side of the nave, both have been restored and have [[Tuscan column]]s, [[triglyph]]s and [[pediment]]s. Above the doorways are oval windows, added in the 19th century which, according to Clare Hartwell, "add a touch of sophistication".<ref name=Hartwell /> There are large round-headed pairs of arched windows with Y-[[tracery]], (possibly added later) and plain [[architrave]]s.<ref name=Hartwell /><ref name=EH /> There are three such windows on the north side and four on the south side with more round-headed windows in the apse.<ref name=EH />

===Interior and fittings===
Internally, the nave measures {{Convert|93|ft|6|in|m}} by {{Convert|36|ft|m}}, the chancel (including apse) measures {{Convert|20|ft}} by {{Convert|17|ft|6|in|m}} and the tower measures {{Convert|12|ft}} by {{Convert|12|ft}}.<ref name=Farrer /> The ceiling of the church has shallow [[Romanesque architecture#Ribbed vault|ribbed vaulting]].<ref name=Hartwell /> There are galleries to the north, west and south, accessed by a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] staircase in the north-west that has turned [[baluster]]s.<ref name=Hartwell /><ref name=Fox19 /> The north and south galleries are supported by plain Tuscan columns and both contain [[box pew]]s that date from 1752.<ref name=Hartwell /> [[Stained glass]] dates from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century and includes work by Lancaster designers [[Shrigley and Hunt]].<ref name=Hartwell /> The [[pulpit]] was constructed in 1955 in the [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] style from the four sides of a 17th century pulpit. It has [[arabesque]]s and a portion of an inscription from the [[Book of Isaiah]].<ref name=Hartwell />
[[File:Choir vestry, St Chad's Church, Poulton-le-Fylde.jpg|right|thumb|The choir [[vestry]], constructed from carved pieces of family [[box pews]]]]
In the south-west corner of the nave is a choir [[vestry]], which was originally built as a [[baptistery]].<ref name=Fox18 /> Its screen is made of carved oak, formed in 1883 from one part of the Fleetwood family box pew that was originally situated in the chancel where the choir stalls now sit.<ref name=Hartwell /> In 1883, this pew had been described as "looking like a cross between a railway carriage and the centre piece of a gondola".<ref name=Hartwell /> The wood is carved with emblems of the family including a double-headed eagle, wheat sheaves and a [[griffin]].<ref name=Fox18 /> The screen door comes from the box pew of another prominent local family<U+2014>the Rigbys of [[Layton, Blackpool|Layton]].<ref name=Storey59 /> It has a carving of a goat's head and is inscribed with "AR 1636".<ref name=EH />

Six [[hatchment]]s hang in St Chad's in memory of 18th century members of the Hesketh-Fleetwood family.<ref name=Storey58 /> These hatchments are diamond-shaped representations of individual [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], painted for their funeral processions and then hung in the parish church.<ref name=Fox20 />

There is a [[ring of bells|ring of eight bells]] hung in an iron frame in the tower; they are rung from the ground floor of the tower. Five of the bells were cast in 1741 by [[Abel Rudhall]] of Gloucester. They were rehung in 1908. The sixth bell was recast in 1865 by [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry|Mears and Co.]] of London. In 1919, the church bells were still customarily rung to signal the town [[curfew]] between September and March.<ref name=Cheetham /> Two more bells were added in 1937, cast by [[Mears and Stainbank]].<ref name=Doves />

==Churchyard==
[[File:St Chad's Church, Poulton-le-Fylde, Preaching Stone - geograph.org.uk - 964664.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of a stone [[preaching cross]]]]
To the south of the church there are the remnants of a stone [[preaching cross]].<ref name=HistoricSurvey18 /> The cross was originally situated on Poulton's boundary and marked a resting place for mourners travelling long distances to bury corpses at St Chad's.<ref name=Rothwell41 /> Only the two circular steps into which the original structure was set remain; the cross shaft has been replaced by an octagonal pillar. The pillar was used as a sundial until the early 20th century when the [[gnomon]] was stolen. The steps function as a memorial for present-day mourners at St Chad's, in a small garden of remembrance.<ref name=Rothwell41 /> The churchyard is noted locally for its display of [[crocus]]es and other flowering bulbs in early springtime.<ref name=Champness /><ref name=Rothwell41 />

Although the churchyard has been closed to burials since 1884, the ashes of cremated bodies have been interred in a small area to the west of the church since the 1950s.<ref name=Storey86 /><ref name=Fox29 /> The paths in the churchyard incorporate gravestones that were set horizontally in 1973. There are few gravestones still standing, but there are several table tombs.<ref name=Fox29 /> To the south-east of the church there is a gravestone marking the grave of Edward Sherdley (d. 1741); the stone features carvings of a [[skull and crossbones]] and an hourglass, and is known locally as the "pirate's grave".<ref name=Fox29 />

==Present day and assessment==
St Chad's was designated a Grade II* [[listed building]] by [[English Heritage]] on 23 September 1950.<ref name=EH />  The Grade II* designation<U+2014>the second highest of the three grades<U+2014>is for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest".<ref name=ListedBuildings /> An active church in the [[Church of England]], St Chad's is part of the [[diocese of Blackburn]], which is in the [[Province of York]]. It is in the [[archdeaconry]] of Lancaster and the [[Deanery]] of Poulton; the [[Benefice#Church of England|benefice]] includes Poulton, Carleton and Singleton. The Rev. Martin Keighley was appointed vicar of St Chad's in 2000.<ref name=Keighley /> The [[ecclesiastical parish]] of Poulton-le-Fylde St Chad includes the Church of St Hilda of Whitby in [[Carleton, Lancashire|Carleton]].<ref name=Dioceseparish />
