'''''Mr. Fantasy''''' (not to be confused with "[[Dear Mr. Fantasy]]", the title song on this album) is the debut album by [[England|English]] [[rock band]] [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]]. It was released in 1967. For the recording, group members included [[Jim Capaldi]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Chris Wood (rock musician)|Chris Wood]], and [[Dave Mason]], however Mason left the band before the album was released. The album reached the number 16 position in the UK album chart on 30 December 1967, and reached number 88 in the American ''Billboard'' charts.<ref>[http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=1942 Chart Stats]</ref>

==Overview==
Considered by far the strangest and most [[art rock]] style album that Traffic released, ''Mr. Fantasy'' didn't gain much more than a cult following for Traffic at the time. Critics seemed to like the album, though, and most said it was clear that Steve Winwood and Traffic were good at putting together semi-mainstream [[psychedelic rock]], except this album was not quite mainstream enough. By their next release, the eponymous [[Traffic (album)|''Traffic'']], the band was said to have worked through that.

This album features even more [[horn section|horn]]s, [[flute]]s, and less [[rock music|rock]]-style instruments than most of Traffic's future releases. The [[sitar]] was used much more in this album than any other later Traffic albums, undoubtedly because of Dave Mason's influence.

The first US version of the album on [[United Artists Records]] had a different title ''Heaven Is In Your Mind'' and a different cover that featured 3 members of the group without Dave Mason.  The title was quickly changed back to ''Mr. Fantasy'' but the new cover remained until [[Island Records]] re-issued the UK version in the late 1970s.  Both the US and UK editions of the album were released in substantially different stereo and mono mixes.  

For the original US edition the group changed the album substantially.  The song order was changed and a short looping snippet of the group's November 1967 single "[[Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush (Traffic song)|Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush]]" was added between most of the songs. The US LP also added three songs from the group's UK singles, "[[Paper Sun]]" and "[[Hole In My Shoe]]" and "Smiling Phases" ([[b-side]]) while deleting two Dave Mason songs "Hope I Never Find Me There" and "Utterly Simple."  The final track on the US album "We're A Fade, You Missed This' is actually the ending of the full length version of "Paper Sun."  For most of the songs there are significant differences between the stereo and mono mixes.  One song in particular, "Giving to You", actually was released in 3 different versions, including similar mono and stereo versions from the U.K. album, plus a very different mono U.K. b-side mix, which also was later included on the U.S. mono LP.  The special U.K. b-side mix includes lyrics sung my Winwood during the introduction which are not heard on any other version.  

The album was engineered by Phil Brown who, when asked what was his favourite memory of engineering, responded: "Recording Dear Mr Fantasy, one o'clock in the morning, November 1967."
