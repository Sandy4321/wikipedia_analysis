'''Geoffrey "Geoff" Campbell''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Lincoln Lewis]]. The actor spent two years auditioning for a role on the show, before he was offered the part of Geoff. He was surprised to get the part as he thought his audition had not been very good. Lewis relocated to Sydney for filming and he cut his long hair for the character. His casting was announced on 17 June 2007, while he made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 20 June 2007. After two years on the show, Lewis quit ''Home and Away'' and filmed his final scenes on 18 September 2009. The character made his screen exit on 12 February 2010.

Geoff was portrayed as being an innocent, honest and sensible teenager throughout his duration. Geoff was a devout [[Christian]] and a [[rugby league]] footballer. He and his sister [[Annie Campbell|Annie]] ([[Charlotte Best]]) were raised by their religious grandfather, [[Bruce Campbell (Home and Away)|Bruce]] ([[Chris Haywood]]) on the family farm, following their parents deaths. Due to his upbringing, Geoff's social skills were not the same as other teenager's his age. Geoff developed an "on and off" friendship with [[Aden Jefferies]] ([[Todd Lasance]]) and his storylines often revolved around his romantic relationships. Geoff's first love interest was the equally inexperienced [[Melody Jones]] ([[Celeste Dodwell]]). He then dated [[Nicole Franklin]] ([[Tessa James]]) and lost his virginity to her, while they were stranded on an island. Geoff also dated [[Claudia Hammond (Home and Away)|Claudia Hammond]] (Alexandra Park) and was led to believe that he was the father of her baby. For his portrayal of Geoff, Lewis won the Most Popular New Male Talent [[Logie Award]].

===Friendship with Aden Jefferies===
Geoff's love of football and his faith made him stand out from other guys his age. He developed an "on and off" friendship with [[Aden Jefferies]] ([[Todd Lasance]]).<ref name="LLeaves"/> Aden disliked Geoff at first due to the fact that Geoff was more talented at football and to Aden, represented "the hypocrisy of society." Aden was convinced that Geoff was just "as flawed as everyone else, and just as full of sin."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/homeandaway/character_adenjefferies.html|title=Aden Jefferies|work=[[RT<U+00C9>.ie]]|publisher=[[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann]]|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref> The eventually matured and became friends.

They both came into contact with the trawler's electric wiring, which left Geoff having to rescue Aden.<ref name="LifeonLine"/> Lewis loved the constant feud between his and Lasance's characters. He admitted that they would "amp it up" as much as they could.<ref name="Bye"/>

===Relationships===
====Melody Jones====
Because of Geoff's background, he was "completely clueless" when it came to girls. He was insecure, but he eventually shared a kiss with the equally inexperienced [[Melody Jones]] ([[Celeste Dodwell]]).<ref name="Lip">{{cite journal|date=14<U+2013>20 June 2008|title=Lip service|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|issue=24}}</ref> Lewis thought that Geoff and Melody were similar as they were both naive and had sheltered upbringings. [[Nicole Franklin]] ([[Tessa James]]) took advantage of that and convinced Geoff that Melody "dumped him" because their first kiss was so bad.<ref name="Lip"/> Nicole told Geoff that if he wanted Melody back, then he would have to become a better kisser and she offered to teach him. Geoff became determined to work things out with Melody and accepted Nicole's help.<ref name="Lip"/> Speaking to an ''Inside Soap'' columnist, Lewis explained "Geoff thinks something's not right about it <U+2013> surely Melody wouldn't ditch him after just one bad kiss? But every time he sees Melody now, she's stand-offish."<ref name="Lip"/> Unbeknownst to Geoff, Melody was under the impression that he was being unfaithful to her with Nicole. Having seen them both together, Melody jumped to the wrong conclusion.<ref name="Lip"/> Nicole did not correct her and went out of her way to stir up trouble. Nicole was frustrated that Geoff was not falling for her, so she set out to sabotage his relationship with Melody instead.<ref name="Lip"/>

====Nicole Franklin====
[[File:Tessa James 2012.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Tessa James played Geoff's love interest Nicole Franklin.]]
Geoff became involved in "a sordid love triangle" with Melody and Nicole, which left viewers guessing which girl he would end up with.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=age&kw=nicole+franklin&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=NCH081031861D16Q0TOA|title=Tight-lipped stars happy to be away at bay|last=Lyons|first=Melissa|date=31 October 2008|work=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=5 October 2013}}</ref> Geoff and Nicole eventually began dating. James thought Nicole was the one for Geoff, but Geoff might not be the one for Nicole. Lewis believed that his character had "deep feelings" for Nicole.<ref name="Wed">{{cite journal|date=30 August<U+2013>5 September 2008|title=Geoff and Nicole to wed?|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]|pages=4<U+2013>5}}</ref> During an interview published in ''Inside Soap'', James said Geoff and Nicole were complete opposites, but it worked in their favour. She called their relationship "fiery" and thought they had been through a lot together.<ref name="Hell">{{cite journal|last=Herbison|first=Jason|date=21<U+2013>27 February 2009|title=Heaven and hell!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|pages=44<U+2013>45}}</ref> Lewis commented that Geoff and Nicole were very similar in some of their traits, as they were both stubborn and opinionated.<ref name="Hell"/> He told [[Jason Herbison]] that when Geoff first started dating Nicole, he had a lot of parents and grandparents tell him that Geoff should be with Melody instead, because Nicole was not a good influence.<ref name="Hell"/> James believed that if Geoff and Nicole broke up, they would still stay good friends. While Lewis added that as long as Geoff and Nicole wanted to be together, they could work through anything.<ref name="Hell"/>

Geoff and Nicole were dumped at sea together by [[Elliot Gillen]] ([[Paul Pantano]]) when he sought revenge against Nicole's father.<ref name="Drama">{{cite journal|title=Desert island drama!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=11<U+2013>17 October 2008|page=17}}</ref> The couple washed up on a deserted island, where Geoff nursed his injuries from a fight with Elliot. Neither of them knew where they were and were forced to survive without food, clothing and shelter.<ref name="Drama"/> Geoff and Nicole tried to light a fire and catch some fish, but were not very successful. James called the situation "hopeless", but said that when they found ways to make each other laugh, they realised how much they meant to each other.<ref name="Drama"/> Lewis thought that it did not help that both of them were almost naked. Geoff lost his virginity to Nicole, which left him feeling guilty because he was saving himself for marriage.<ref name="Wed"/> At the time, he felt it was right for him, but later believed that he should have been stronger.<ref name="Wed"/> 

Once they were rescued, Geoff and Nicole returned to the Bay and their romance took another shock turn. Because he and Nicole had sex before marriage, Geoff felt the only way to make things right was to ask Nicole to marry him.<ref name="MarryMe">{{cite journal|date=18<U+2013>24 October 2008|title=Marry me, Nicole!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|issue=43|page=24}}</ref> Geoff believed that if he and Nicole were going to have sex again, they should be married. Though he was not one hundred per cent sure about it, he felt a wedding was the only solution.<ref name="Wed"/> Lewis did not think a proposal was a good idea and quipped that Geoff was not ready to tie his own shoelaces.<ref name="Wed"/> The proposal came as a surprise to Nicole, who turned it down and then vented her disgust at the suggestion.<ref name="MarryMe"/> James quipped "She's really offended <U+2013> it's as though Geoff's ashamed of what happened between them."<ref name="MarryMe"/> Nicole saw the proposal as an attempt to fix a mistake. Nicole found it odd that Geoff thought they should get married at such a young age, and it killed the passion between them and spoiled their relationship.<ref name="MarryMe"/>

When Nicole surprised Geoff with a romantic getaway to the island where they first had sex, the couple were faced with "a homicidal madman" called [[Derrick Quaid]] ([[John Atkinson (actor)|John Atkinson]]).<ref name="Terror">{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Carolyn|date=14<U+2013>20 March 2009|title=Geoff and Nicole's island terror|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]|issue=11|pages=4<U+2013>5}}</ref> The storyline started while Geoff and Nicole's relationship was going through a rough patch. Nicole thought a trip away would help them overcome their issues.<ref name="Terror"/> Lewis told Stewart that Geoff loved the surprise at first, but everything about Nicole made Geoff question his beliefs about premarital sex and whenever they started to get close, Geoff knew that he could give in again and so he tried to back away.<ref name="Terror"/> Things got worse for the couple when Derreck, a complete stranger, turned up at their camp.<ref name="Terror"/> Derreck tried to intimidate Geoff and Nicole and prevented Geoff from calling for help. Geoff and Nicole tried to get away from Derreck, but he pulled out a fishing knife, causing Geoff to panic.<ref name="Terror"/> When asked if Geoff was scared, Lewis replied "He is <U+2013> but, to be honest, he's actually more scared for Nicole's life than his own. Being the kind of guy he is, Geoff puts everyone else before himself. He cares about Nicole more than anyone else in the world and would risk everything to save her."<ref name="Terror"/> Geoff and Nicole's relationship started to crumble and they were constantly "at each other's throats".<ref name="Hook">{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Carolyn|date=21<U+2013>27 March 2009|title=Hot new hook-ups!|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]|issue=12|page=15}}</ref> When Geoff gave her a meaningful gift of a tree cutting, Nicole was unimpressed. Geoff was devastated when he overheard Nicole "dissing" the gift and he broke up with her.<ref name="Hook"/>

Geoff started flirting with his primary school friend, [[Claudia Hammond (Home and Away)|Claudia Hammond]] (Alexandra Park), at a wedding.<ref name="Rebound">{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Carolyn|date=11<U+2013>17 April 2009|title=Rebound romance: Nicole who?|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]|issue=15|page=13}}</ref> He made eye contact with her and kept sneaking over to see her. Geoff had only just broken up with Nicole and a ''TV Week'' reporter questioned whether it was the "real thing" or a rebound romance.<ref name="Rebound"/> After Geoff had sex with Claudia for the first time, they became trapped in a fire that engulfed their caravan.<ref name="Flames">{{cite journal|last=Herbison|first=Jason|date=9<U+2013>15 May 2009|title=Flames of passion|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|issue=18|page=23}}</ref> Lewis told [[Jason Herbison]] from ''Inside Soap'' that when Geoff awoke to find the caravan in flames, he initially believed that he had gone to hell as punishment for having sex before marriage.<ref name="Flames"/> The fire was started accidentally when a fight between [[Jai Fernandez]] ([[Jordan Rodrigues]]) and [[Trey Palmer]] ([[Luke Bracey]]) got out of hand. Lewis explained "They accidentally knock over a barrel which has a fire burning inside it, and a caravan goes up in flames. The pair have no idea that Geoff and Claudia are in there, though."<ref name="Flames"/> As the fire continued to engulf the caravan, Geoff realised that Claudia was succumbing to smoke inhalation. He helped get her out through a window, before collapsing and having to be rescued by Jai and [[Miles Copeland (Home and Away)|Miles Copeland]] ([[Josh Quong Tart]]).<ref name="Flames"/> 

Lewis told Herbison that Geoff thought he was going to die and once he is safe, he can only think about Claudia.<ref name="Flames"/> Once Geoff got to the hospital, he discovered that Claudia had lied about her previous relationship ending.<ref name="Flames"/> He found Claudia talking to a guy he did not recognise and soon learned that he was her on-off boyfriend [[Lachie Cladwell]] (Jackson Heywood).<ref name="Flames"/> Claudia had told Geoff that she and Lachie were broken up, but that was not the case. When Lachie realised who Geoff was, he punched him in the stomach and warned him to stay away from his girlfriend.<ref name="Flames"/> Claudia later discovered that she was pregnant and she and Geoff were forced to consider their future.<ref name="Pause">{{cite journal|date=13<U+2013>19 June 2009|title=Pregnant pause|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|issue=23}}</ref> Due to Geoff's strict religious background, it was hard for him when everyone learnt that Claudia was expecting.<ref name="Pause"/> Lewis explained "His sister, Annie, is disappointed, as Geoff's gone against what they were taught."<ref name="Pause"/> Claudia's father was not supportive of the couple and he kicked his daughter out, which added to the pressure that Geoff was already feeling.<ref name="Pause"/> 

[[Belle Taylor]] ([[Jessica Tovey]]) allowed the couple to stay with her, while Geoff tried to keep the news a secret from his guardian [[Irene Roberts]] ([[Lynne McGranger]]).<ref name="Pause"/> When Claudia admitted to Annie that she was thinking about having an abortion, Geoff was shocked as it went against his faith. Things got too much for Geoff and he went away for a couple of days to think about the situation.<ref name="Pause"/> Of the pregnancy and Claudia and Geoff's relationship, series producer [[Cameron Welsh]] stated "It's not as clear cut as it probably looks on the surface. There's more going on there in their relationship and more than what we can probably see right now. It's an interesting story and will develop over the next couple of weeks."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/interviews/a161623/cameron-welsh-series-producer-home-and-away.html|title=Cameron Welsh (Series Producer, 'Home and Away')|last=Rowe|first=Darren|date=26 June 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=2 October 2013}}</ref> Lachie later tried to injure Geoff during a rugby match, but Geoff tackled Lachie hard, leaving him with no feeling in his legs.<ref name="Stories"/> While they were at the hospital, Geoff and Claudia were "full of guilt" and Geoff tried to apologise to Lachie.<ref name="Stories"/> Claudia then admitted to Geoff that the baby was not his, but Lachie's.
