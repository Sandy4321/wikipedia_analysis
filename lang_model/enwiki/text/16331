'''Social commentary''' is the act of rebelling against an individual, or a group of people by [[rhetoric]]al means, or commentary on social issues or society. This is most often done with the idea of implementing or promoting change by informing the general populace about a given problem and appealing to people's sense of justice.

Two examples of strong and bitter social commentary are the writings of [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Martin Luther]]. Swift exposed and decried the appalling poverty in [[Ireland]] at the time, which was viewed as the fault of the British government. Luther initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]] against practices of the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] Church.

Writers who engage in social criticism are commonly well-educated members of the upper classes but might also come from the lower social strata, as did [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Will Rogers]]. Social commentary is not limited to printed forms, as it is commonly practiced through all forms of communication, from conversations to computerised communication.

== Forms of social commentary ==
This list is far from exhaustive. Examples of social commentary may be found in any form of communication. Artistic works of all mediums are often defined by what they say about society. Despite being wordless, the memorable image of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] may be considered one of the most profound commentaries of the power of the individual.

===Direct publication===
===Public speaking===
Most [[public speaking]] constitutes social commentary of some form. Many [[sermon]]s will describe the ills of society and offer religious solutions. Many politicians may speak in a similar fashion - in [[Julius Caesar (play)|Shakespeare's Julius Caesar]] one can see [[Mark Antony]]'s funeral speech as a commentary. The larger audience offered by radio and television has diminished the significance of public speaking as a means of social commentary.

===Fiction===
Allegorical [[fiction]]al works such as ''[[Animal Farm]]'' clearly contain a social commentary and one can find some degree of social commentary in almost any novel. ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' can be interpreted as a commentary on racial issues, especially given the date of its publication (1960). Another example of social commentary is [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' in which he uses the Utopia to satirize the values of 16th century Britain. Social commentaries have been searched for even in [[fantasy]] novels such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', though such connections often require much conjecture.

===Non-Fiction===

Directly speaking to a topic in the social discourse in writing by defining the audience, the bounds of the topic, and the presenting facts and opinions based on the primarily author and possibly on another's perspective.

===Radio, television and film===
Fictional works in these mediums have a similar scope to that of their literary counterparts and documentaries to the non-fiction works described above. Television and films often use powerful images to enhance their message, for example, [[Michael Moore]]'s films utilise this to great effect in promoting his political beliefs. Some examples of films include ''[[Food, Inc.]]'', ''[[The Story of Stuff]]'' featuring [[Annie Leonard]], and [[Morgan Spurlock]]'s ''[[Super Size Me]]''. And to a lesser degree, the prominent Italian [[exploitation film]] ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' uses graphic violence, shocking imagery, and underlying topics in anthropology to express [[Ruggero Deodato]]'s distaste for modern society - more importantly - what it has become. West Indian calypsonians participate annually in songwriting competitions with the common use of [[double entendre]], humour and metaphor as well as monikers to avoid legal complications (see [[Calypso Music]]).

===Offering One Up===
Typically occurs at a random moment, and is often followed by the peers of the social commentary repeating the phrase "ok, ok"

==Monologists==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
An early radio monologist was [[Will Rogers]], with sharp (yet good humored) observations upon society (1922<U+2013>1935). Current monologists include:
*[[Jay Leno]]
*[[Garrison Keillor]]
*[[Jon Stewart]]
*[[Dick Gregory]]
*[[George Carlin]]
*[[Stephen Colbert]]
*[[Craig Ferguson]]
*[[David Letterman]]
*[[Conan O'Brien]]
*[[Bill Maher]]

==Discussion shows==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
There are a number of discussion shows that do not have a call in segments, but which sometimes have discussions (beyond mere interviews) with personages of current interest. Some such shows include:
*[[Jay Leno]]
*[[David Letterman]]
*[[Oprah Winfrey]]

==Talk shows (call in)==
In the late 20th century through the present, radio and television phone-in shows allow limited discussion and sometimes debate on such issues, although if involving politics or issues exploited for political purposes the discussion is often directed by the "moderator" toward a specific point of view, typically by terminating non-conforming phone calls.

In more balanced forums it is common that a panel of well-known social commentators or experts on aspectc of a topic will respond to comments from listeners after an introductory interactice discussion directed by the moderator, with only the obstreperous or extreme caller sumarrily terminated.

===Newspapers and comic books===
What is probably the most common social commentary is that of the [[editorial]] section of newspapers, where columnists give their opinion on current affairs. The letters section of papers allows a similar platform for members of the public. [[Editorial cartoons]], such as those in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', perform a social commentary, often with a humorous slant. 

The conventional comic section is more limited, but sometimes with social commentary, often subtle and oblique, or more bold, abrasive, and consistently pointed as in, [[Li'l Abner]], [[Pogo]], [[Doonesbury]], [[Bloom County]], and [[Boondocks]] or in [[comic book|pulp comics]] such as [[Howard the Duck]]. Many other even more explicitly provocative comics (usually with a far left of center point of view) appear in various free weekly newspapers such as the [[San Francisco Bay Guardian]] and the  [[East Bay Express]] (in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]) and the [[Village Voice]] (in [[New York City]]), and similarly in many other locals, often those with a strong university or college presence.

===The Internet===
The [[WorldWideWeb|web]] performs a similar function to the letters section described above. It is ripe with social commentary because it allows the dissemination of ideas by anyone with a computer to a potentially enormous audience, as well as instant comment and discussion. Its international scope is particularly attractive, with language the only major barrier to communication. Most [[blog]]s are social commentaries of a fashion. Discussion and debate occurs in many [[Internet forums|forums]] and [[chat rooms]].

The internet is viewed as one of the greatest modern-time advances in terms of freedom of speech and thought; however [[Internet censorship|censorship]] is not impossible, for example that performed by the authorities in [[Internet censorship in mainland China|China]] . W.H. Auden's poetry also served as a medium of social commentary.
