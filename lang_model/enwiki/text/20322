The '''Premier League''' is an English professional league for men's association football clubs. At the top of the [[English football league system]], it is the country's primary football competition. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with [[the Football League]]. Besides English clubs, some of the [[#Wales|Welsh clubs]] can also qualify to play, and [[#Scotland and Ireland|participation by some Scottish or Irish clubs]] has also been mooted.

The Premier League is a corporation in which the 20 member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from August to May, with teams playing 38 matches each, totalling 380 matches in the season.<ref>[http://www.premierleague.com/content/premierleague/en-gb/fans/faqs/when-will-goal-line-technology-be-introduced.html When will goal-line technology be introduced?] The total number of matches can be calculated using the formula n*(n-1) where n is the total number of teams.</ref> Most games are played in the afternoons of Saturdays and Sundays, the other games during weekday evenings. It is currently [[English football sponsorship|sponsored]] by [[Barclays|Barclays Bank]] and thus officially known as the '''Barclays Premier League'''. Outside England, it is commonly referred to as the '''English Premier League (EPL)'''.

The competition formed as the '''FA Premier League''' on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the [[Football League First Division]] to break away from the Football League, which was originally founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,626773,00.html |title=United (versus Liverpool) Nations |newspaper=The Observer |date=6 January 2002 |accessdate =8 August 2006}}</ref> This deal is worth <U+00A3>1&nbsp;billion a year as of 2013<U+2013>14, with [[BSkyB]] and [[BT Group]] securing the rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively.<ref>{{cite news |title=Premier League lands <U+00A3>bn deal |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jun/13/premier-league-tv-rights-3-billion-sky-bt/ |author=Gibson, Owen |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 June 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2012 }}</ref> The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643&nbsp;million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.<ref>{{cite news |title=The World's Most Watched League |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/about/the-worlds-most-watched-league.html |work=Premier League |publisher=PremierLeague.com |date=16 November 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref> In the [[2010<U+2013>11 Premier League|2010<U+2013>11 season]] the average Premier League match attendance was 35,363, the second highest of any professional football league behind the German [[Bundesliga]],<ref>{{cite web|title=German Bundesliga Stats: Team Attendance <U+2013> 2010<U+2013>11|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/ger.1/year/2010/german-bundesliga?cc=4716|work=Soccernet|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> and stadium occupancy was 92.2% capacity.<ref name="premsitehistory"/> The Premier League ranked second in the [[UEFA coefficient|Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) coefficient]]s of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the last five years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~kassiesa/bert/uefa/data/method4/crank2013.html |title=UEFA ranking of European leagues |last=Kassies |first=Bert |publisher=Bert Kassies |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=27 November 2012 }}</ref>

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Despite significant European success during the 1970s and early 1980s, the late '80s had marked a low point for English football. [[Stadium|Stadia]] were crumbling, supporters endured poor facilities, [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]] was rife, and English clubs were banned from European competition for five years following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/31/newsid_2481000/2481723.stm |title=1985: English teams banned after Heysel |work=BBC Archive |publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 August 2006 |date=31 May 1985}}</ref> The [[Football League First Division]], which had been the top level of English football since 1888, was well behind leagues such as Italy's [[Serie A]] and Spain's [[La Liga]] in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.<ref name="premsitehistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/History/0,,12306,00.html |title=A History of The Premier League |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=22 November 2007}}</ref>

However, by the turn of the 1990s the downward trend was starting to reverse; England had been successful in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], reaching the semi-finals. [[UEFA]], European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990 (resulting in Manchester United lifting the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1991) and the [[Taylor Report]] on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadia in the aftermath of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], was published in January of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/communityfootball/violence_taylor_report.asp |title=The Taylor Report |publisher=Football Network |accessdate=22 November 2007}}</ref>

Television money had also become much more important; the Football League received <U+00A3>6.3&nbsp;million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but when that deal was renewed in 1988, the price rose to <U+00A3>44&nbsp;million over four years.<ref name="leicester_tv">{{cite web |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/sociology/css/resources/factsheets/fs8.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110606080220/http://www.le.ac.uk/sociology/css/resources/factsheets/fs8.html|archivedate=6 June 2011 |title=Fact Sheet 8: British Football on Television |publisher=Centre for the Sociology of Sport, University of Leicester |last=Crawford |first=Gerry |accessdate=10 August 2006}}</ref> The 1988 negotiations were the first signs of a breakaway league; ten clubs<ref>{{cite news|title=Super Ten Losing Ground|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZmFPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=I5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=7001%2C3212387|date=14 July 1988|newspaper=New Straits Times|accessdate=9 September 2013}}</ref> threatened to leave and form a "super league", but were eventually persuaded to stay.<ref name="FLhistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10794,00.html |title=The History of the Football League |publisher=Football League |accessdate=12 September 2010 |archivedate=11 April 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080411034859/http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10794,00.html |deadurl=yes}}</ref> As stadia improved and match attendance and revenues rose, the country's top teams again considered leaving the Football League in order to capitalise on the growing influx of money being pumped into the sport.<ref name="FLhistory"/>

=== Foundation ===
{{See also|Foundation of the Premier League}}
At the close of the 1991 season, a proposal for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall was tabled. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |title=In the matter of an agreement between the Football Association Premier League Limited and the Football Association Limited and the Football League Limited and their respective member clubs |work=HM Courts Service |publisher=HM Government |year=2006 |accessdate=8 August 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927222536/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from [[The Football Association]] and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.<ref name="premsitehistory"/>

The managing director of [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT), [[Greg Dyke]], met with the representatives of the "big five"<ref>The big five were Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham, Everton and Arsenal</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thefilter.blogs.com/thefilter/Sports/page/2/ |title=Kerry Packer (1937-2005)|first=Anthony |last=Evans |coauthors=Conolly, Thomas; Lai, Stephen; Whitfield, Matthew; Bainbridge, James; and Mellor, Andrew |date=27 December 2005 |work=The Filter^ }}</ref> football clubs in England in 1990. The meeting was to pave the way for a break away from [[The Football League]]. Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money. The five clubs decided it was a good idea and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of [[The Football Association]] and so [[David Dein]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League's position.

In 1992, the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League ''[[en masse]]'' and on 27 May 1992 the FA Premier League was formed as a [[private limited company by shares|limited company]] working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in [[Lancaster Gate]].<ref name="premsitehistory"/> This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.<ref name="FLhistory"/>

The league held its first season in [[1992<U+2013>93 FA Premier League|1992<U+2013>93]] and was originally composed of 22 clubs. The first ever Premier League goal was scored by [[Brian Deane]] of Sheffield United in a 2<U+2013>1 win against Manchester United.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--the-premier-kickoff-fergusons-false-start-1540915.html |title=The Premier Kick-Off: Ferguson's false start |first=Phil |last=Shaw |newspaper=The Independent |date=17 August 1992 |accessdate=24 August 2010}}</ref> The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?competitionid=1&seasonid=122 |title=Final 1992/1993 English Premier Table |work=Soccerbase |publisher=Racing Post |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] were the three teams relegated from the old first division at the end of the 1991<U+2013>92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season.

=== Development ===
{{See also|List of Premier League seasons}}
Due to insistence by the [[FIFA|International Federation of Association Football]] (FIFA), the international governing body of football, that domestic leagues reduce the number of games clubs played, the number of clubs was reduced to 20 in 1995 when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted. On 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007<U+2013>08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fifa wants 18-team Premier League |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/5061302.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 June 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2006 }}</ref> Ultimately, the 2007<U+2013>08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.

The league changed its name from the ''FA Premier League'' to simply the ''Premier League'' in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/22/65/0,,12306~91426,00.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090304205428/http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/22/65/0,,12306~91426,00.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2009 |title=Premier League and Barclays Announce Competition Name Change |publisher=Premier League |accessdate =22 November 2006 |format=PDF}}</ref>

== Corporate structure ==
The Premier League is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a [[shareholder]], with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs elect a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/fapl.rac?command=setSelectedId&nextPage=enSimpleStories&id=2861&type=com.fapl.website.stories.SimpleStories&categoryCode=Who%20We%20Are&breadcrumb=about_breadcrumb |title=Our relationship with the clubs |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=8 August 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061114102011/http://www.premierleague.com/fapl.rac?command=setSelectedId&nextPage=enSimpleStories&id=2861&type=com.fapl.website.stories.SimpleStories&categoryCode=Who+We+Are&breadcrumb=about_breadcrumb |archivedate=14 November 2006 }}</ref> The current chairman is [[Dave Richards|Sir Dave Richards]], who was appointed in April 1999, and the chief executive is [[Richard Scudamore]], appointed in November 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/jun/10/premierleague.englandfootballteam1|title=Premier League v England time-line|first=Sachin|last=Nakrani|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 June 2008|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> The former chairman and chief executive, [[John Quinton (banker)|John Quinton]] and [[Peter Leaver]], were forced to resign in March 1999 after awarding consultancy contracts to former Sky executives [[Sam Chisholm]] and [[David Chance]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/feb/25/broadcasting3|title=Timeline: a history of TV football rights|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 February 2003|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/fapl.rac?command=setSelectedId&nextPage=enSimpleStories&id=2851&type=com.fapl.website.stories.SimpleStories&categoryCode=Who%20We%20Are&breadcrumb=about_breadcrumb |archivedate=18 March 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060318214006/http://www.premierleague.com/fapl.rac?command=setSelectedId&nextPage=enSimpleStories&id=2851&type=com.fapl.website.stories.SimpleStories&categoryCode=Who+We+Are&breadcrumb=about_breadcrumb |deadurl=yes |title=The Premier League and Other Football Bodies |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref>

== Competition format ==

=== Competition ===
There are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin system]]), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 38 games. Teams receive [[three points for a win]] and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are [[Group tournament ranking system|ranked]] by total points, then [[goal difference]], and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sporting-life.com/football/live/tables/premiership.html |title=Barclays Premier League |work=Sporting Life |publisher=365 Media Group |accessdate=26 November 2007}}</ref> The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the [[Football League Championship]], and the top two teams from the Championship, together with the winner of [[Football League Championship play-offs|play-offs]] involving the third to sixth placed Championship clubs, are promoted in their place.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=294727 |title=Huge Stakes For Championship Play-Off Contenders |work=Goal |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=26 November 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071203202007/http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=294727 <!-- Added by H3llBot --> |archivedate=3 December 2007}}</ref>

An [[Liverpool F.C. 2005<U+2013>06 UEFA Champions League qualification|exception to the usual European qualification system]] happened in 2005, after [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season.

In 2007, the Premier League became the highest ranking European League based on the performances of English teams in European competitions over a five-year period.

Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to [[BSkyB]] in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market, as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.<ref name="leicester_tv"/>

The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European Leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8545202.stm|title=Why TV is the key to Real success|first=Nils|last=Blythe|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=2 March 2010|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> The money is divided into three parts:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/Faqs/0,,12306,00.html |title=Frequently asked questions about the F.A.

The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/premier-league-nets-16314bn-tv-rights-bonanza-1925462.html |title=Premier League nets <U+00A3>1.4bn TV rights bonanza |newspaper=The Independent |last=Harris |first=Nick |date=23 March 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref>

The league brought in <U+00A3>320&nbsp;million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004<U+2013>05 to 2006<U+2013>07.

This occurred following an insistence by the [[European Commission]] that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid a total of <U+00A3>1.7&nbsp;billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3&nbsp;pm match solely for Irish viewers. The [[BBC]] has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on ''[[Match of the Day]]'') for <U+00A3>171.6&nbsp;million, a 63&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent increase on the <U+00A3>105&nbsp;million it paid for the previous three-year period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/match_of_the_day/5060828.stm |title=BBC keeps Premiership highlights |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 June 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2006}}</ref> [[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann]] broadcast the [[Premier Soccer Saturday|highlights package]] in Ireland.

CTV will also broadcast the [[FA Cup Final]] as part of TSN's contract with the Premier League.  On the weeks in which NBC does not air Premier League due to the [[PGA Tour]], matches are cable-exclusive.  All Bell Media cable networks including TSN have exclusive coverage of Survival Sunday (like NBC, CTV devotes the afternoon of Survival Sunday to the [[Players Championship]] golf tournament.)

In Australia, [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] broadcasts all of the season's 380 matches live,<ref>https://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/foxtel-insider/barclays-premier-league-returns-saturday-on-fox-sports-218261.htm</ref> using their 'Viewers Choice' service to give subscribers the option of selecting which Saturday 3pm match to watch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/58663,never-miss-an-epl-moment.aspx |title=Never Miss An EPL Moment... |work=Australian Four Four Two |publisher=Haymarket Media |date=10 August 2007 |accessdate=8 April 2009}}</ref>

Figures from UK tourism body [[VisitBritain]] suggest that 750,000 visitors to Britain attended a Premier League match in 2010, spending a total <U+00A3>595&nbsp;million and an average of <U+00A3>766. Visitors from [[Norway]] are most likely to come to watch Premier League football, with one in 13 Norwegian tourists travelling specifically to attend matches. Second on the list is the [[United Arab Emirates]]. For those visiting family and friends, the most likely to watch a football match are from Japan, China and Australia.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/08/18/uk-soccer-premier-league-idUKTRE77H7KG20110818|title=Premier League draws 750,000 visitors a year|publisher=Reuters|date=19 August 2011}}</ref>

A major criticism of the Premier League in the mid-[[2000s (decade)|2000s]] was the emergence of the so-called "Big Four" clubs: [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article3908394.ece |title=Breaking up the Premier League's Big Four |date=11 May 2008 |last=Northcroft |first=Jonathan |newspaper=The Sunday Times |accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref><ref name=Bestofrest>{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=405515&root=england&&cc=5739 |title=The best of the rest |date=29 January 2007 |work=Soccernet |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=27 November 2007}}</ref> During this decade, and particularly from 2002-2009, they dominated the top four spots, which came with [[UEFA Champions League]] qualification, taking all top four places in 5 out of 6 seasons from 03-04 to 08-09 inclusive. In May 2008, [[Kevin Keegan]] stated that "Big Four" dominance threatened the division, "This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world."<ref>{{cite news |title=Power of top four concerns Keegan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7384247.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=6 May 2008 |accessdate=6 May 2008 }}</ref> Premier League chief executive [[Richard Scudamore]] said in defence "There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting."<ref>{{cite news |title=Scudamore defends 'boring' League |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7388360.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=7 May 2008 |accessdate=9 May 2008 }}</ref> At the height of their dominance in [[2006<U+2013>07 UEFA Champions League|2006-07]], [[2007<U+2013>08 UEFA Champions League|2007-08]] and [[2008<U+2013>09 UEFA Champions League|2008-09]]. the  Big Four formed three of the four UEFA Champions League semi-finalists in each season.

The years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the "Big Four" with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] vying for a place in the top four. <ref name="Jolly">{{Cite web |title=Changing dynamics of the 'Big Six' in Premier League title race |last=Jolly |first=Richard |url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/changing-dynamics-of-the-big-six-in-premier-league-title-race |work=The National |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2013 }}</ref> In the [[2009<U+2013>10 Premier League|2009<U+2013>10 season]], Tottenham pipped Manchester City to finish fourth and become the first team to break the top four since [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2005, with both Manchester City and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] also finishing above Liverpool, formerly a "Big Four" team. In [[2010<U+2013>11 Premier League|2010<U+2013>11]], Manchester City finished third, and won the title in [[2011<U+2013>12 Premier League|2011<U+2013>12 season]], becoming the first club outside of the "Big Four" to win since [[1994<U+2013>95 in English football|1994<U+2013>95]]. That season also saw two of the Big Four (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside of the top four places for the first time since 1994-95. <ref name="Jolly" />

Criticism of the gap between an elite group of "super clubs" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Alex McLeish says Aston Villa struggle to compete with top clubs |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14844717.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=8 September 2011 }}</ref>

=== Widening gap with lower leagues ===
{{See also|Premier League<U+2013>Football League gulf}}
One of the main criticisms levelled at the Premier League is the increasing gulf between the Premier League and the Football League. Since its split with the [[The Football League|Football League]], many established clubs in the Premier League have managed to distance themselves from their counterparts in lower leagues. Owing in large part to the disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues,<ref name="guardian">{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1771399,00.html |title=Rich clubs forced to give up a sliver of the TV pie |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=8 August 2006 |first=David |last=Conn |date=10 May 2006}}</ref> many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the Premier League. In every season except [[2001<U+2013>02 FA Premier League|2001<U+2013>02]] ([[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]) and 2011<U+2013>12 ([[Queens Park Rangers]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]]), at least one Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League. In [[1997<U+2013>98 FA Premier League|1997<U+2013>98]] all three promoted clubs were relegated at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news |title=1997/98 <U+2013> Season Review |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=333233&root=extratime&cc=5739 |last=Brewin |first=John |date=4 July 2005 |accessdate=29 November 2007 |work=Soccernet |publisher=ESPN}}</ref>

The Premier League distributes a small portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from the league in the form of "parachute payments". Starting with the [[2013<U+2013>14 Premier League|2013<U+2013>14]] season, these payments are in excess of <U+00A3>60&nbsp;million over four seasons.<ref name="BBC Sport">{{cite web|title=Premier League's relegated clubs to receive <U+00A3>60m boost|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22171365}}</ref> Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues (the average Premier League team receives <U+00A3>55&nbsp;million<ref name="Mail Sport">{{cite news|title=Hull set for <U+00A3>120m cash windfall if they win promotion to Premier League|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2315255/Hull-set-make-extra-120m-win-promotion-Premier-League.html | work=Daily Mail | first=Paul|last=Collins|date=26 April 2013}}</ref> while the average [[Football League Championship]] club receives <U+00A3>2&nbsp;million<ref name="Guardian Sport">{{cite web |title=Richard Scudamore takes big stick to Championship over parachute money |url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/16/premier-league-championship-parachute-payments }}</ref>), critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1837801,00.html |title=Why clubs may risk millions for riches at the end of the rainbow |date=5 August 2006 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=13 August 2006 |first=Stuart |last=James}}</ref> leading to the common occurrence of teams "[[Premier League<U+2013>Football League gulf|bouncing back]]" soon after their relegation.

Further relegations down the footballing ladder have ensued for several clubs unable to cope with the gap.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/article-23664566-details/Premier+League+casualties+-+clubs+that+have+struggled+since+relegation/article.do |title=Premier League casualties <U+2013> clubs that have struggled since relegation |newspaper=Evening Standard |publisher=Daily Mail & General Trust |first1=Ben |last1=Bailey |first2=Patrick |last2=Whyte |date=19 March 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090322034918/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/article-23664566-details/Premier+League+casualties+-+clubs+that+have+struggled+since+relegation/article.do <!-- Added by H3llBot --> |archivedate=22 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2299511/Down-again-Leicesters-relegation-horror.html |title=Down again: Leicester's relegation horror |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=7 April 2009}}</ref>

====Wales====
Besides English clubs, there are currently also six Welsh clubs ([[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Colwyn Bay F.C.|Colwyn Bay]], [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]], [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]]) that are members of the [[Football Association of Wales]] (FAW), but choose to play in the [[English football league system]] rather than its [[Welsh football league system|Welsh counterpart]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Abbandonato |first=Paul |title=Cardiff, Swansea and Wrexham: Clubs Based in Wales, Who Play Home Matches Here in Wales, but Who the FAW Bar From Representing Us in Europe |work=Western Mail |date=17 December 2004 |page=51 }}</ref> and can thus theoretically qualify to play in the Premier League.

Up to [[2010<U+2013>11 Premier League|2010<U+2013>11]], no Welsh clubs had qualified for the top flight in the Premier League era.

Because they are members of the [[Football Association of Wales]] (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Cardiff and Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused [[Football in England#Welsh clubs|long-running discussions]] in [[UEFA]]. Despite being a member of the FAW, Swansea will be taking up one of England's three available places in the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] in 2013<U+2013>14, thanks to winning the [[Premier League Cup|League Cup]] in 2012<U+2013>13.

== Managers ==
{{See also|List of Premier League managers}}
[[Manager (association football)|Managers]] in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Managers, directors and trust in professional football |first1=Seamus |last1=Kelly |first2=John |last2=Harris |journal=Sport in Society: Cultures, Commerce, Media, Politics |volume=13 |issue=3 |year=2010 |pages=489<U+2013>502 |doi=10.1080/17430431003588150}}</ref> Managers are required to have a [[UEFA Pro Licence]] which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the [[UEFA]] 'B' and 'A' Licences.<ref name="licences">{{cite news|last=White |first=Duncan |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/12/05/sfnkmo05.xml |title=The Knowledge |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 December 2005|accessdate=13 October 2010}}</ref> The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i. e. more than 12 weeks <U+2013> the amount of time an unqualified [[caretaker manager]] is allowed to take control).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/chelsea/article2508204.ece|title=Avram Grant's job under threat from lack of Uefa licence|newspaper=The Times|first1=Matt|last1=Hughes|first2=Martin|last2=Samuel|date=22 September 2007|accessdate=8 November 2010}}</ref> Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker; examples include [[Paul Hart]] at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[David Pleat]] at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

The league's longest-serving manager was [[Alex Ferguson]], who was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012<U+2013>13 season, meaning that he was manager for all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League. [[Ars<U+00E8>ne Wenger]] is now the league's longest-serving current manager, having been in charge of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the Premier League since 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>

No English manager has won the Premier League; the seven managers to have won the title comprise two [[Scotland|Scots]] Alex Ferguson (Manchester United, 13 wins) and [[Kenny Dalglish]] (Blackburn Rovers, one win), a Frenchman ([[Ars<U+00E8>ne Wenger]], Arsenal, three wins), a Portuguese ([[Jos<U+00E9> Mourinho]], Chelsea, two wins), a Chilean ([[Manuel Pellegrini]], Manchester City, one win) and two Italians ([[Carlo Ancelotti]], Chelsea, and [[Roberto Mancini]], Manchester City, one win each).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/winners.html |title=Who won what |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>

At the inception of the Premier League in [[1992<U+2013>93 FA Premier League|1992<U+2013>93]], just eleven players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4487212-3057,00.html |last=Atkinson |first=Ron |title=England need to stem the foreign tide |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 August 2002 |accessdate=10 August 2006}}</ref> By [[2000<U+2013>01 FA Premier League|2000<U+2013>01]], the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the total.

Players in the Premier League compete for the [[Premier League Golden Boot]], awarded to the top scorer at the end of each season, as well as for Golden Boot awards for the first person to score 10, 20 or 30 goals in a season. They can also compete for the informal competitions of [[Goal of the Month (England)|Goal of the Month]] and [[Goal of the Season]]. Former Blackburn Rovers and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] [[Forward (association football)|striker]] [[Alan Shearer]] holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260.
