'''''Collaborations''''' is a four-disc [[compilation album|compilation]] [[box set]] by Indian classical musician [[Ravi Shankar]] and former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]]. Released in October 2010 on [[Dark Horse Records]], it compiles two studio albums originally issued on that label <U+2013> the long-unavailable ''[[Shankar Family & Friends]]'' (1974) and ''[[Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from India]]'' (1976) <U+2013> and ''[[Chants of India]]'' (1997), first issued on [[Angel Records]]. Although all three albums were originally Shankar releases, for which Harrison served in the role of music producer and guest musician, both Shankar and Harrison are credited as artists on the box set. Each of the collaborative projects represents a departure from Shankar's more typical work as a [[sitar]]ist and performer of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani classical]] [[raga]]s, with the box set showcasing his forays into, variously, jazz and rock, Indian folk and orchestral ensembles, and devotional music.

The fourth disc of ''Collaborations'' is a DVD containing previously unissued film of a performance by the Music Festival from India, recorded at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] in September 1974. Filmed by director [[Stuart Cooper]], the footage required substantial restoration for its 2010 release. An audio-only track on the DVD, prepared by [[Anoushka Shankar]] and [[Paul Hicks (musician)|Paul Hicks]], provides a more complete record of the concert.

Issued nine years after Harrison's death, the limited-edition release coincided with celebrations for Shankar's 90th birthday and was overseen by Harrison's widow, [[Olivia Harrison|Olivia]]. Among the lavish packaging for the compilation, each disc appears inside enlarged, 8<U+00BD>-inch sleeves, and each copy of the set is individually numbered. An accompanying book contains a foreword by American composer [[Philip Glass]], rare photographs documenting Shankar and Harrison's 35-year friendship, and commentary from both artists on the projects featured in the box set. While ''Collaborations'' presents only a portion of Shankar and Harrison's work together, music critics have recognised it as a successful representation of the far-reaching cultural legacy of their partnership.

==Background==
In June 1966, while still a member of [[the Beatles]], [[George Harrison]] met Indian classical musician [[Ravi Shankar]] in London and became a student of the [[sitar]]ist.<ref>Tillery, pp. 55, 160.</ref><ref>Leng, pp. 25<U+2013>26.</ref> Harrison later said that, for himself, the music was "like an excuse", and that in reality he was searching for a "spiritual connection" with the culture of India.<ref>Harrison, p. 220.</ref> The association immediately brought Shankar and Indian music unprecedented popularity in the West,<ref name="RoughGuides p 109" /><ref name=Glass>Philip Glass, [http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/09/arts/george-harrison-world-music-catalyst-great-souled-man-open-influence-unfamiliar.html?pagewanted=all "George Harrison, World-Music Catalyst and Great-Souled Man; Open to the Influence of Unfamiliar Cultures"], ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', 9 December 2001 (retrieved 16 August 2014).</ref> while Harrison's introduction of the sitar into the Beatles' sound inspired a new genre known as [[raga rock]].<ref>Schaffner, pp. 64, 66.</ref><ref>Everett, p. 40.</ref> By 1971, a year after [[Break-up of the Beatles|the Beatles' break-up]], and having established himself as a solo artist with his ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' triple album (1970), Harrison began working with Shankar, as his producer.<ref>Lavezzoli, pp. 186, 187.</ref> These 1971 projects, all released on the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label, included the soundtrack to the documentary film ''[[Raga (film)|Raga]]''; Shankar's ''[[Joi Bangla]]'' EP, recorded to raise international awareness for the plight of refugees of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]; and the live album ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]'', which documented the [[UNICEF]] benefit concerts that Harrison and Shankar staged in New York that August.<ref>Rodriguez, pp. 44, 236, 237.</ref><ref>Lavezzoli, pp. 187<U+2013>88, 190, 193<U+2013>94.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|The last of Shankar's releases on Apple, the ''[[In Concert 1972]]'' double live album, recorded with his regular [[jugalbandi]] partner [[Ali Akbar Khan]],<ref name="Hunt/Gramophone">Ken Hunt, "Ravi Shankar Ali Akbar Khan, ''In Concert 1972''", ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', June 1997, p. 116.</ref><ref>''World Music: The Rough Guide'', pp. 75, 78.</ref> was also produced by Harrison.<ref name="Eds of RS p 193" />}}

Twenty-three years older than Harrison, Shankar described their relationship as, variously, that of father and son, with each one adopting either role; close friends; and teacher and student.<ref>Shankar, p. 230.</ref><ref name="Tillery p 141" /> While their musical collaborations continued only intermittently after the mid 1970s, the depth of their friendship remained,<ref name="Tillery p 141">Tillery, p. 141.</ref> such that Harrison would credit Shankar as being "the person who has influenced my life the most".<ref>''Collaborations'', p. 11.</ref> When Harrison died in November 2001, following a four-year battle with cancer, Shankar was at his bedside, along with members of Harrison's family.<ref>Tillery, pp. 148, 167<U+2013>68.</ref>

==Musical content==
The 2010 box set ''Collaborations'' was one of several reissue projects celebrating Shankar's 90th birthday. It compiles three studio albums that he and Harrison worked on together between 1973 and 1996:<ref>Shankar, p. 324.</ref> ''[[Shankar Family & Friends]]'' (1974), ''[[Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from India]]'' (1976) and ''[[Chants of India]]'' (1997).<ref name="Michaels/Guardian" /> The first two of these albums had long been out of print, and their inclusion in the box set marked the debut CD release for both titles.<ref name="Michaels/Guardian" /> Disc four contains a previously unissued concert film from 1974, titled ''Music Festival from India <U+2013> Live at the Royal Albert Hall''.<ref name="AmSong">Evan Schlansky, [http://www.americansongwriter.com/2010/08/george-harrison-and-ravi-shankars-relationship-explored-on-collaborations/ "George Harrison and Ravi Shankar's Relationship Explored on ''Collaborations''"], ''[[American Songwriter]]'', 12 August 2010 (retrieved 15 August 2014).</ref>

Harrison's role on the three studio albums was mainly confined to that of a [[record producer]],<ref name="Unterberger/AM" /> although his name appeared prominently on the front cover of ''Chants of India'', and the latter was marketed as a collaborative work between Shankar and Harrison.<ref>Leng, pp. 280<U+2013>81.</ref> ''Collaborations'' presents the albums in reverse chronological order, with ''Chants of India'' appearing on disc one.<ref name="Pop Matters" />

===''Chants of India''===

{{quote box|quote= ''Chants of India'' is the most vivid in my mind. It was fascinating to witness the creation of that album ...

Shankar and Harrison recorded the album between January and August 1996,<ref>Badman, pp. 551, 554, 556<U+2013>57.</ref> with sessions taking place in the southern India city of [[Madras]], and at Harrison's English home, [[Friar Park]], in [[Henley-on-Thames]].<ref>Tillery, pp. 141<U+2013>42.</ref> The majority of the selections consist of [[Vedic]] prayers and other [[Sanskrit]]-worded, [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious texts that Shankar set to music.<ref name="Lavezzoli p 197" /> He also wrote new pieces in a similarly sacred vein,<ref>Ravi Shankar's liner notes, ''[[Chants of India]]'' CD ([[Angel Records]], 1997; produced by George Harrison).</ref> including "Prabhujee", the only song to contain [[Hindi]] lyrics.<ref>Lavezzoli, pp. 197<U+2013>98.</ref> Among the many musicians and singers on ''Chants of India'' were Shankar's daughter [[Anoushka Shankar|Anoushka]],<ref name="Lavezzoli p 197" /> [[tabla|tablist]] [[Bikram Ghosh]] and [[santoor]] player [[Tarun Bhattacharya]].<ref>Album credits, ''[[Chants of India]]'' CD ([[Angel Records]], 1997; produced by George Harrison).</ref>

The album's creation resulted from Shankar and Harrison having renewed their close friendship in recent years, following a period when, by his own admission, Shankar had partially withdrawal from his Western-musician friends in the late 1970s, stung by persistent criticism from the Indian press that he was "diluting" Indian classical music.<ref>Shankar, pp. 212<U+2013>14, 228.</ref> Other projects that the pair undertook together in the mid 1990s include ''[[Ravi Shankar: In Celebration]]'' (1996), a four-disc career retrospective compiled by Harrison,<ref name="Shankar p 305">Shankar, p. 305.</ref> and ''[[Raga Mala (book)|Raga Mala]]'', Shankar's second autobiography, for which Harrison served as editor.<ref name="Lavezzoli p 197" />{{refn|group=nb|Among their occasional collaborations during the intervening years, Shankar wrote a piece titled "Dhani" as a tribute to Harrison's newborn [[Dhani Harrison|son]] in 1978, which Shankar, Harrison and [[Alla Rakha]] taped at Friar Park,<ref>Shankar, pp. 228<U+2013>29.</ref> and the two musicians recorded the instrumental "Friar Park" in 1986 for Shankar's album ''[[Tana Mana]]''.<ref name="InCelebration booklet" /> In addition, Shankar contributed a sitar part to Harrison's Indian-styled song "[[Ride Rajbun]]", recorded in 1988 for the children's [[Animated series|animated TV series]] ''The Bunbury Tails''.<ref>Leng, pp. 272<U+2013>73.</ref>}}

''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine's reviewer wrote of ''Collaborations'': "there is a heaviness and intensity to each performance that makes this seemingly austere collection quite compelling to rock ears."<ref name="Collaborations/Muze" /> Terry Staunton of ''[[Record Collector]]'' described the set as an "intriguing series of East<U+2013>West summits" and concluded: "It may have limited appeal, even to ardent Beatle-heads, but this box set is a strong testament to two friends' mutual respect and their desire to push musical boundaries."<ref name="Staunton/RecCollect" />

While comparing the set to more highly publicised concurrent reissues from former Beatles [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]], Joe Marchese of The Second Disc praised ''Collaborations'' for the adventurous quality of its music, as well as the lavishness of the packaging. Of the three studio albums in the box set, the reviewer described ''Shankar Family & Friends'' as the "most commercial" and ''Music Festival from India'' as "exotic, but immediately transporting", and wrote that "joy and a celebratory feel exudes from [''Chants of India'']". Marchese added: "[The] albums illuminate an important aspect of the career of George Harrison, for sure. But they also remind one of the immense musical influence of Ravi Shankar ... These once hard-to-find LPs are presented with great integrity here."<ref name="Marchese/Second Disc">Joe Marchese, [http://theseconddisc.com/2010/11/08/review-ravi-shankar-and-george-harrison-collaborations/ "Review: Ravi Shankar and George Harrison, 'Collaborations'"], The Second Disc, 8 November 2010 (retrieved 16 August 2014).</ref>

Writing for AllMusic, [[Richie Unterberger]] qualifies the joint credit afforded Shankar and Harrison, saying: "Without downplaying the closeness of the two musicians' friendship and Harrison's genuine participation in all of these projects, it should be stated up front that this is much more Shankar's music than Harrison's, and much more Indian music than the rock for which Harrison was most famed." Unterberger describes the box set as "a bountiful gathering of some of Shankar's more accessible recordings" and highlights ''Chants of India'' as the most effective collaboration between the two artists.<ref name="Unterberger/AM">Richie Unterberger, [http://www.allmusic.com/album/collaborations-mw0002041725 "George Harrison/Ravi Shankar ''Collaborations''"], [[AllMusic]] (retrieved 11 August 2014).</ref> [[PopMatters]] contributor Sachyn Mital described the box set as "a special gift for [Shankar's] fans" on the occasion of his 90th birthday, and "worthy of a man of such esteemed stature". Mital concludes of the partnership: "The diligence of Harrison brought Ravi Shankar, Indian music and Eastern spirituality soundly into Western collective consciousness."<ref name="Pop Matters" />
