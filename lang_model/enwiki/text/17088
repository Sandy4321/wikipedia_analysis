The '''Harivamsha''' (also '''Harivamsa'''; [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|hariva<U+1E43><U+015B>a}}'' {{lang|sa|<U+0939><U+0930><U+093F><U+0935><U+0902><U+0936>}} "the lineage of [[Hari]] ([[Vishnu]])") is an important work of [[Sanskrit literature]], containing  16,375 [[shloka|verses]]. The text is complex, containing layers that may go back to the 1st or 2nd centuries CE. The bulk of the text is derived from two traditions, the ''{{IAST|pa<U+00F1>calak<U+1E63>a<U+1E47>a}}'' tradition, that is, the "five marks" of the  [[Purana]] corpus one of which is ''{{IAST|va<U+1E43><U+015B>a}}'' "genealogy", and stories about the life of [[Krishna]] as a herdsman. The latter portion  presents the earliest source of Krishna's early life and his affairs with the [[gopis]], presenting him as a tribal hero.

The text was adapted to serve as an appendix to the [[Mahabharata]], which led to the accretion of interpolations, including references to Krishna's nature of an [[avatar]] of Vishnu; these portions date to approximately the 11th century and are influenced by classical Sanskrit court poetry.

There have been translations of the ''Harivamsa'' in many Indian vernacular languages, [[English language|English]] (M. N. Dutt, 1897), [[French language|French]] (M. A. Langlois, Paris, 1834-35), and other languages.

There are also [[Jaini]] Harivamsas in various langauges that present Jainist versions of the Krishna story.
