The '''Diocese of Moray''' was one of the most important of the medieval diocese in [[Scotland]].  It was founded in the early years of the 12th century by [[King David I|David I of Scotland]] under its first bishop, [[Gregoir of Moray|Gregoir]].  These early Moray bishops did not have a fixed seat but took their cathedrals to the culdee centres at Birnie, Kinneddor and lastly Spynie.  

==Spynie Cathedral==
Bishop [[Bricius de Douglas]] finally obtained papal permission on 7 April 1206 to fix the cathedral at the Church of the Holy Trinity at Spynie.<ref>Registrium Episcacopatus Moravienses no.46 </ref>  Authorisation was also granted to create a chapter of eight canons to administer the cathedral.  The chapter based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral.<ref>Registrium Episcacopatus Moravienses, nos. 48, 49 and 93</ref>   It is possible that this decision may have been influenced by the fact that Bricius<U+2019> immediate predecessor was Bishop Richard de Lincoln.  

==Elgin Cathedral==

Bricius saw that Spynie was too remote from those it sought to serve and, with a need to ensure the safety of the clergy, petitioned the pope to grant the moving of the church to relative safety of [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]].<ref>Registrium Episcacopatus Moravienses no. 45</ref>  It was not until after his death, however, that this was achieved under the episcopate of Bishop [[Andreas de Moravia]].<ref>Registrium Episcacopatus Moravienses nos.26, 57 and 58</ref>  This transference took place with the authority of [[Pope Honorius III]] and King [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] on 19 July 1224.<ref>Cant, Robert: Historic Elgin and its Cathedral, Elgin Society, Elgin, 1974, p. 23</ref>

==Bishops of Moray==

Bishop Bricius organised the constitution of the church, but it was Bishop Andreas who increased the number of dignitaries and prebend canons and was responsible for gaining large grants of land from his kinsmen, the powerful de Moravia lords, as well as the king. In the year of his death, Andreas changed the cathedral's constitution to that of Salisbury.<ref>Registrium Episcacopatus Moravienses no. 81</ref>  Other Bishops made a lasting impact on the diocese and probably the most important of these was [[Alexander Bur]] who championed the right of the Moray church to retain its property against a ruthless magnate, [[Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan]] and called the ''Wolf of Badenoch''.<ref>Discussion on the quarrel, see: Grant, Alexander: The Wolf of Badenoch in Moray: Province and People; ed. Seller, W D H, Edinburgh, pp. 143<U+2014>161; Oram, Richard D: Alexander Bur, Bishop of Moray, 1362<U+2014>1397 in Barbera Crawford (ed) Church Chronicle and Learning in Medieval and Early Renaissance Scotland, Edinburgh, 1999, pp. 202<U+2014>204</ref>  The last of the [[Roman Catholic]] bishops was Patrick Hepburn who alienated almost all of the lands pertaining to the church at the time of the [[Scottish Reformation]].

==Extent of the diocese==
[[Image:Medieval Moray.jpg|150px|thumb| Map showing the Diocese, Province and Earldom of Moray]] 
The diocese covered a large area extending from Huntly in the east, within a few miles of the Knoydart Peninsula in the west and, in the south-west, to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at an inlet of [[Loch Linnhe]] in Lochaber. It was divided into the four deaneries of Elgin, [[Inverness]], Strathbogie and Strathspey.  Each of these deaneries contained a number of parishes that provided the mensal and prebendal churches for the church.
