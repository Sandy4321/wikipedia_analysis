The '''St Austell and Clay Country Eco-town''' is a plan to build a new town on a cluster of sites owned by mining company [[Imerys]] near [[St Austell]], in [[Cornwall]]. The plan was given outline outline government approval in July 2009. The plan would need to gain full planning permission before construction commenced.

A number of organisations are involved in the development. A [[joint venture company]] called ECO-BOS has been set up by Imerys, and [[Orascom]], with assistance from the [[Eden Project]]. This company will prepare the planning application and build the development if granted. [[Cornwall Council]] will lead on some part of the project.

==Background==
The plan was provisionally termed '''Imerys China Clay Community''', in 2008 the plan was shortlisted by the [[UK]]'s [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] as one of the 10 [[Eco-towns (UK)|eco-town]]s proposed for construction in the UK. 

Under the company's plans, 5,000 eco-homes would be built on former china clay quarries and other sites owned by Imerys over a 20 year period.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plans for 5,000 clay pit houses|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7336029.stm|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=13 October 2011|date=8 April 2008}}</ref>

A pilot project consisting of 48 homes, community and employment buildings is planned for the Baal & West Carclaze site. The homes will be built with high level of [[Energy efficiency in British housing|energy efficiency]] including some with a ''zero-carbon'' rating. 

The plan include several [[renewable energy]] sources including geo-thermal, solar, biomass generation, wind farms, water source heating/cooling and rainwater harvesting.

==Reception==
The plan has received some local opposition. The "No Ecotown" group has fears that few of the homes will be affordable, increased traffic congestion, lack of employment opportunities, swamping of local villages and damage to wildlife habitats.<ref name=reception /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noecotown.co.uk/|title=No Eco Town}}</ref>
