In [[Greek mythology]] '''Ino''' was a mortal queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], the second wife of [[Athamas]], the mother of [[Learches]] and [[Melicertes]], daughter of [[Cadmus]] and [[Harmonia (Greek goddess)|Harmonia]] and stepmother of [[Phrixus]] and [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]]. She was one of the three sisters of [[Semele]]: [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]], [[Autonoe]] and Ino, who was a surrogate for the divine nurses of [[Dionysus]]:  "Ino was a primordial Dionysian woman, nurse to the god and a divine [[maenad]]" (Kerenyi 1976:246).

Maenads were known to tear their own children limb from limb in their madness. In the [[back-story]] to the heroic tale of [[Argonautica|Jason and the Golden Fleece]], Phrixus and Helle, twin children of Athamas and [[Nephele]], were hated by their stepmother, Ino. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all the crop seeds of [[Boeotia]] so they would not grow (''[[Bibliotheke]]'' i.9.1).<ref>"It is possible, however", Kerenyi suggests (''The Gods of the Greeks'' p 264) "that originally she did not cause the seed-corn to be roasted, but introduced the practice of roasting corn in general."</ref> The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus. Athamas reluctantly agreed. Before he was killed though, Phrixus and Helle were rescued by a flying golden ram sent by Nephele, their natural mother. Helle fell off the ram into the [[Hellespont]] (which was named after her, meaning ''Sea of Helle'') and drowned, but Phrixus survived all the way to [[Colchis]], where King [[Aeetes]] took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter, [[Chalciope]], in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the [[golden fleece]] of the ram, which Aeetes hung in a tree in his kingdom. 

Later, Ino raised [[Dionysus]], her nephew, son of her sister [[Semele]], causing [[Hera]]'s intense jealousy. In vengeance, [[Hera]] struck [[Athamas]] with insanity. Athamas went mad, slew one of his sons, [[Learchus]], thinking he was a ram, and set out in frenzied pursuit of Ino. To escape him Ino threw herself into the sea with her son [[Melicertes]]. Both were afterwards worshipped as marine divinities, Ino as [[Leucothea]] ("the white goddess"), Melicertes as [[Palaemon]].  Alternatively, Ino was also stricken with insanity and killed Melicertes by boiling him in a cauldron, then took the cauldron and jumped into the sea with it.  A sympathetic [[Zeus]] didn't want Ino to die,   and transfigured her and Melicertes as [[Leucothea]] and [[Palaemon]].

The story of Ino, [[Athamas]] and [[Melicertes]] is relevant also in the context of two larger themes.<!--are these themes identified?-->  Ino, daughter of [[Cadmus]] and [[Harmonia (Greek goddess)|Harmonia]], had an end just as tragic as her siblings: [[Semele]] died while pregnant with [[Zeus]]' child, killed by her own pride and lack of trust in her lover; [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]] killed her own son, King [[Pentheus]] while struck with Dionysian madness, and [[Actaeon]], son of [[Autonoe]], the third sibling, was torn apart by his own hunting dogs.  Also, the insanity of Ino and Athamas, who hunted his own son [[Learchos]] as a stag and slew him, can be explained as a result of their contact with Dionysus, whose presence can cause insanity.  None can escape the powers of Dionysus, the god of wine. [[Euripides]] took up the tale in  ''[[The Bacchae]]'', explaining their madness in Dionysiac terms, as having initially resisted belief in the god's divinity.

When Athamas returned to his second wife, Ino, [[Themisto]] (his third wife) sought revenge by dressing her children in white clothing and Ino's in black and directing the murder of the children in black.  Ino switched their clothes without Themisto knowing and she killed her own children.

Transformed into an immortal goddess, Ino also represents one of the many sources of divine aid to [[Odysseus]] in Homer's epic poem, [[The Odyssey]]. Providing him with a veil, she instructs him how he can succeed in his plight to reach land and eventually Ithaca. Homer's [[epithet]] associated with this goddess is "Ino of the slim ankles".

In historical times, a sisterhood of [[maenad]]s of Thebes in the service of Dionysus traced their descent in the female line from Ino; we know this because an inscription at [[Magnesia on the Maeander]] summoned three maenads from Thebes, from the house of Ino, to direct the new mysteries of Dionysus at Magnesia (Burkert 1992:44).
