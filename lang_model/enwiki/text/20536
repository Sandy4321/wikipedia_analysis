The '''APEV Scoutchel''' ({{lang-en|Scout ladder}}) is a [[France|French]] [[amateur-built aircraft]], designed by Daniel Dalby and  produced by [[APEV]] of [[Peynier]]. The aircraft is supplied as plans or as a kit for amateur construction.<ref name="WDLA11">Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: ''World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12'', page 93. WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011.

==Design and development==
The Scoutchel is derived from the earlier [[APEV Demoichelle]], itself an updated version of the pre-[[First World War]] [[Santos-Dumont Demoiselle]].<ref name="WDLA11" />

The Scoutchel features a [[strut-braced]] [[high-wing]], a single-seat open cockpit without a [[cockpit fairing]], fixed [[tricycle landing gear]] and a single engine mounted above the cockpit on the keel tube, in [[tractor configuration]].<ref name="WDLA11" /><ref name="Scoutchel" />

The aircraft is made from bolted-together [[aluminum]] tubing. The wings are the same as those used on the [[Pouchel Light]] and are built around a single aluminium [[Spar (aviation)|spar]], with [[Rib (aircraft)|ribs]] made from extruded [[polystyrene]] with [[plywood]] bracing, all bonded to [[fibreglass]] [[Leading edge|leading]] and [[trailing edge]]s, covered in [[Dacron]] sailcloth. The {{convert|8.30|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} span wing employs a [[NACA airfoil|NACA 23112]] [[airfoil]] and has an area of {{convert|9.96|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, with an [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] of 8:1. A unique roll control system is used as the aircraft has no [[aileron]]s. Instead the wings are pivoted to +4&deg; and -2&deg; to produce and control roll. The wings can be folded for ground transportation or storage.<ref name="WDLA11" /><ref name="Scoutchel" />

Recommended engines are the {{convert|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 377]] or the {{convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 447]] [[two-stroke]] powerplants, although it can also fit [[Electric aircraft|electric motors]] as well.<ref name="WDLA11" /><ref name="Scoutchel" />

The manufacturer estimates building times at 150 hours from the kit and 300 hours from plans.<ref name="Scoutchel" />
