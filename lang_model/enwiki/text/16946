== Biography ==
Legien was born in [[Marienburg]], [[Province of Prussia]], (now [[Malbork]], Poland), to Rudolf, a tax official, and Maria Legien. His parents died in his childhood and Legien grew up in an orphanage in [[Toru<U+0144>|Thorn]], Province of Prussia (now [[Toru<U+0144>]]) from 1867 to 1875. He became a wood turner and served in the [[Prussian Army]] from 1881 to 1884. He joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in 1885, a wood turners<U+2019> union in 1886 and worked as a turner in several cities in Germany until 1891, since 1886 in [[Hamburg]].<ref name=Lane>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VlR8YCE8lkQC&pg=PA556&dq=carl+Legien+marienburg&hl=de&ei=BRwOTuTuH8_HswaryJntDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=carl%20Legien%20marienburg&f=false|title=Biographical dictionary of European labor leaders|first1=A.

Legien became Chairman of the [[International Secretariat of National Trade Union Centres]] in 1903 and first President of the [[International Federation of Trade Unions]] in 1913 until its dissolution in 1919.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/netzquelle/01299.pdf|title=The International Federation of Trade Unions |first1=Edo|last1=Fimmen |publisher=International Federation of Trade Unions|year=1922|isbn= |page=5|language=}}</ref>

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] he supported the war with "patriotic fervor"<ref name=Bookchin/> and the SPD-majority<U+2019>s [[Burgfrieden]]policy, a "civil truce", which assured the German government not to "obstruct the German war effort".<ref name=DHM/><ref>Mommsen, Hans; Forster, Elborg: The rise and fall of Weimar democracy, page 1</ref> Legien and other leading Social Democrats expected this policy to end the animosity and discrimination of socialist workers in Germany, while the German Empire's government (particularly the War Ministry) evaluated organised labour as an important factor in war industries. As a result workers became a mobilized, disciplined loyal force in the war effort in return for concessions, and the German labour movement became an obstacle against opposition to war.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8TTNfbKN5AUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Imperial+Germany+and+the+Great+War,+1914-1918,&hl=de&ei=GpkQTqvBIdD1sgayvo3_Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=legien&f=false|title=Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914-1918|first1=Roger|last1=Chickering |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-521-83908-4|page=151|language=}}</ref> In the context of the separation of the opposing Social Democratic minority, which led to the foundation of the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD), Legien and [[Gustav Bauer]] declared that the "Jewish gang" must be dealt with, in attempt to drive them out of the their faction.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.de/books?id=W3zk3PdfRb8C&pg=PA50&dq=Oscar+Cohn,+Ludger+Heid,+page+82,+Campus+Fachbuch+2002&hl=de&ei=iEwRTo29MoPZsgbg16zDBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=legien&f=false|title=Oskar Cohn: Ein Sozialist und Zionist im Kaiserreich und in der Weimarer Republik |first1=Ludger |last1=Heid|publisher=Campus|year=2002|isbn=3-593-37040-9|page=78|language=German}}</ref>

On 15 November 1918 he signed the [[German Revolution of 1918<U+2013>1919#Stinnes-Legien-Agreement|Stinnes-Legien-Agreement]] with industrialist [[Hugo Stinnes]], an agreement in which the German employers for the first time accepted nationwide unions as legitimate workers-organisations and which introduced an eight-hour day, workers councils in plants with more than 50 employees and parity employment offices. The employers agreed to stop discrimination of union members and their support of "house unions" (yellow unions) while the unions rejected radical socialists<U+2019> demands.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zFBu8ujJWzkC&pg=PA159&dq=carl+Legien+ebert&hl=de&ei=1CgOTt_cGM7usgb0ofj6Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgK#v=snippet&q=Legien%20&f=false|title=A concise history of Germany |first1=Mary|last1=Fulbrock |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-521-83320-5|page=159|language=}}</ref><ref name=Tempel>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VCSP8OagbEcC&pg=PA91&dq=Stinnes-Legien-agreement&hl=de&ei=aBYQTu3gOo34sgbzudWPDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFUQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&q=Stinnes-Legien-agreement&f=false

To Legien the expected loss of [[Upper Silesia]] to [[Poland]] (calling them "primitive Poles") after World War I would intensify the 'psychological' impact of the "draconian peace" on the German working class.<ref>European history quarterly,Volume 31,page 112, Sage Publications Ltd., 2001 "According to the head of the SPD-affiliated trade unions, Carl Legien, the loss of Upper Silesia to the primitive Poles promised to intensify the 'psychological' impact of the draconian peace on the German working class"</ref>
