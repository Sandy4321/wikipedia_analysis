'''Geydar Dzhakhidovich Dzhemal''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0413><U+0435><U+0439><U+0434><U+0430><U+0301><U+0440> <U+0414><U+0436><U+0430><U+0445><U+0438><U+0301><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0414><U+0436><U+0435><U+043C><U+0430><U+0301><U+043B><U+044C>}}; {{lang-az|Heyd<U+0259>r Camal}}; born November&nbsp;6, 1947 in [[Moscow]]) is a [[Russia]]n political figure and thinker of [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] and [[Russians|Russian]] descent. He is the chairman of the Islamic Committee of Russia.

Dzhemal's maternal grandfather, Shapovalov, was the director of the Maly Theater and Vice Minister of Culture in the USSR. Irina Shapovalova gave birth to Geydar at 18, divorcing soon afterwards. Her second marriage was to a military seaman, who moved with her to Estonia (Soviet Estonian Republic). A few years later, already with a third husband, she finally returned to Moscow. Geydar was raised by his grandparents.
  
In 1965, after graduation from school and with assistance from his grandfather, Geydar entered the Institute of Oriental Languages at [[Moscow State University]], but a year later was expelled "for bourgeois nationalism". The drop-out would get a job as an editor at "Medicine" Publishing House, where he met a graduate of the MSU Ilya Moskvin. He worked at the "Medicine" as an editor and had many books on psychiatry. At that time Dzhemal told friends, that Moskvin "had opened a new world for me". In addition to psychiatry, Moskvin introduced to Dzhemal in early 1968 the first "schizoid underground".

In the mid-1970s, friends advised Geydar, who was interested in psychiatry, to play a mental illness in order to solve some problems with the police, who tried to prosecute him "for parasitism". This worked as he was subsequently registered at a psychiatric institution. 

By that time, Dzhemal was already married; he raised his son Yury. 

Since 1979, he was active in the underground All-Soviet Islamic movement. 
In the late 1980s together with [[Alexander Dugin]] Dzhemal became a member of the nationalist and [[Pamyat]] Society, but then took his distances with the organization completely. In 1990, Dzhemal took part in the creation of the Islamic Revival Party in Astrakhan and became a deputy chairman of the party. In the same year he established an information center "Tauhid". From 1991 to 1993 he published the newspaper "Al-Vakhdat" ( "Unity"). From 1993 to 1996, Dzhemal did a few TV shows on Islamic issues   
("Present", "The Minaret", etc.). In 1998, Dzhemal did a lecture tour in South Africa. In 1999 at the Orthodox-Islamic conference in St.&nbsp;Petersburg he put forward the thesis of the possibility of an anti-Imperialist strategic alliance between people of Islam' and Orthodox Christianity's spirituality. 

Dzhemal is among the 34 first signatories of the online anti-Putin manifesto "[[Putin must go]]", published on March&nbsp;10, 2010
