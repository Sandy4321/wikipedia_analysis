'''The Waterloo Hotel''' is a historical [[hotel]] located on Waterloo Place in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. It was the first large scale purpose built hotel in Edinburgh, trading from 1819 to 1898.

==The Waterloo Hotel, Tavern and Coffee House==
The Grade A Listed Georgian building was designed by the Scottish [[architect]] [[Archibald Elliot]] (1761-1823) and constructed between 1815 and 1819. It contained fifty bedrooms, a coffee room, three dining rooms and a large ballroom (80&nbsp;ft by 40&nbsp;ft). In the 1970s, long after the hotel ceased trading, the ballroom was demolished to accommodate an extension, but the cupola (domed window in the ceiling), which would have filled the ballroom with light, has been preserved and can still be seen on the 8th floor of the building.<ref>[http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/hslive/hsstart?P_HBNUM=29896 Listed Building Report]</ref>
