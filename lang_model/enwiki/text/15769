"'''Marry the Night'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Lady Gaga]] from her second [[studio album]], ''[[Born This Way]]'' (2011). It was written and produced by Lady Gaga and [[Fernando Garibay]], and was recorded on the tour bus during [[The Monster Ball Tour]] with Garibay. "Marry the Night" was inspired by the energy of Gaga's previous song "[[Dance in the Dark]]" and the love for her hometown, New York City, which gave her the courage to reject [[Hollywood]]. Gaga first mentioned the song on [[Ryan Seacrest]]'s radio show, ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air with Ryan Seacrest ]]'', in February 2011. The song was released for promotion on [[Farmville]], six days before the release of ''Born This Way.'' 

"Marry the Night" is a [[dance-pop]] song, influenced by [[house music]] and [[electro-pop]]. The song features the sound of an electronic church bell, whose composition inspired Gaga to compose the lyrics. "Marry the Night" also features [[techno]] beats, handclaps and a funk-rock influenced [[break (music)|breakdown]]. The lyrics are about Gaga's love of the night and partying, while serving as a homage to her hometown; it references her party days in the New York downtown music scene. 

The song received mostly positive reviews from critics, with most of them describing it as a staple dance-floor song. Reviewers also found influences of Italian music producer [[Giorgio Moroder]] and American rock musician [[Bruce Springsteen]] in the song. After the release of ''Born This Way'', "Marry the Night" charted in some nations due to digital sales from the parent album. The song debuted at 79 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and entered the [[Canadian Hot 100]] at 91. It also charted in the Walloon region of Belgium, South Korea and the United Kingdom.

"Marry the Night" was written by [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Fernando Garibay]] while on the road for [[The Monster Ball Tour]], and was [[record producer|produced]] by both. It was first mentioned by Gaga as a track from her album, ''[[Born This Way]]'', [[Ryan Seacrest]]'s [[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|radio show]], where she described it as one of her favorite songs from the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ryanseacrest.com/2011/02/15/lady-gaga-whitney-houston-was-my-vocal-idol-growing-up-audio/|title=Lady Gaga: Whitney Houston Was My Vocal Idol Growing Up|last=Seacrest|first=Ryan|authorlink=Ryan Seacrest|work=[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]|date=2011-02-14|accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref> Gaga and Garibay had worked previously on the song "[[Dance in the Dark]]" (2009), from Gaga's previous release, ''[[The Fame Monster]]''. Before starting work on "Marry the Night", Gaga listened to "Dance in the Dark" and decided she wanted to top that song's energy with her new collaboration with Garibay. "I remember being backstage and hearing the concert start, so I go out there and hear 'Dance in the Dark' open up the whole concert, and I wanted to outdo that feeling. I wanted to outdo that moment that opens up the show. I'm just that way."<ref name="insideoutside"/> 

Wanting to have a new style of music, Gaga made it clear she did not want the song to sound anything like her previous work. She wanted to write a song that could define where she was with ''Born This Way'' and her life.<ref name="insideoutside"/> As Gaga performed on The Monster Ball Tour, Garibay started working on the music of the song. After the show was over, Gaga came back to her studio bus and asked him about the progress. Garibay then explained that he had concocted a different kind of music for the song, and played the church-bell inspired music to Gaga. After first hearing it, the singer said that she started to cry, noticing the vastness of the music, and she started writing the lyrics for "Marry the Night".<ref name="insideoutside">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1664761/lady-gaga-marry-the-night-fernando-garibay.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga 'Started To Cry' When She First Heard 'Marry The Night'|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|date=2011-05-27|accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[NME]]'', Gaga explained that the main inspiration behind the song was singer Whitney Houston and also added: "This song is about me going back to New York. I wrote this about the courage it took for me to say 'I hate Hollywood, I just wanna live in Brooklyn and make music'".<ref name="nme">{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Peter|date=2011-04-23|title=Freak Or Fraud?

Evan Sawdey from [[PopMatters]] gave the song a negative review, saying "Marry the Night' very much wants to be top-notch [[Justice (band)|Justice]] knockoff, but by adding a bridge of upbeat platitudes and an utterly pointless instrumental section after the 3:30 mark, she ultimately winds up weakening the power of her 'let<U+2019>s take the night' rallying cry".<ref name="PopMatters">{{cite web|first=Evan|last=Sawdey|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/141861-lady-gaga-born-this-way/|title=Lady Gaga: Born This Way < PopMatters|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|date=2011-05-27|accessdate=2011-05-27}}</ref> Kerri Mason from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' found influences of [[gothic rock]] in it, but went on to call it an "unapologetic disco-powered pop" that could have been a production number on Gaga's debut album, ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/news/lady-gaga-s-born-this-way-track-by-track-1005196832.story#/news/lady-gaga-s-born-this-way-track-by-track-1005196832.story|title=Lady Gaga 'Born This Way': Track-By-Track Review|last=Mason|first=Kerri|date=2011-05-23|accessdate=2011-06-26|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media}}</ref> Neil McCormick from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave an analogy with rock musician "[[Meat Loaf]] going to the disco", while describing the song.<ref name="tele">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8523548/Lady-Gagas-Born-This-Way-track-by-track-review.html|title=Lady Gaga's Born This Way: track-by-track review|last=McCormick|first=Neil|date=2011-05-23|accessdate=2011-06-24|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Ltd}}</ref> ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s Dan Martin felt that the song, although impressive, was conservative as the opening song of ''Born This Way''.
