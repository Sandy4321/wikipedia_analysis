'''Ancient Rome''' was a [[civilization]] that grew from a small agricultural community founded on the [[Italian Peninsula]] in the 9th century BC to a large [[empire]] straddling the [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref>Chris Scarre, ''The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Rome'' (London: Penguin Books, 1995).</ref>  In its twelve centuries of existence, Roman civilization shifted from a [[monarchy]], to a [[Roman Republic|republic]] based on a combination of [[oligarchy]] and [[democracy]], to an increasingly [[autocracy|autocratic]] [[Roman Empire|empire]]. It came to dominate [[Western Europe]] and the area surrounding the [[Mediterranean Sea]] through [[invasion|conquest]] and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. 

The [[Roman empire]] went into decline in the 5th century AD. [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Plagued by internal instability]] and [[Migration period|attacked by various migrating peoples]], the [[Western Roman Empire|western part of the empire]], including [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]], and [[Italian Peninsula|Italy]], broke up into independent kingdoms in the 5th century. The [[Eastern Roman Empire|eastern part of the empire]], governed from [[Constantinople]], survived this crisis, and would live on for another millennium, until its last remains were finally annexed by the emerging [[Ottoman Empire]]. This eastern, [[Middle Ages|medieval]] stage of the Empire is usually referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]] by historians.

Roman civilization is often grouped into "[[classical antiquity]]" with [[ancient Greece]], a civilization that inspired much of the [[culture of ancient Rome]]. Ancient Rome contributed greatly to the development of [[law]], [[war]], [[art]], [[literature]], [[architecture]], [[technology]] and [[language]] in the [[Western world]], and its [[History of Rome|history]] continues to have a major influence on the world today.

{{main|Battle of Allia}}
The early 5th Century BCE saw an influx of [[Gauls]] (Gallic Celts) push south of [[Cisalpine]] [[Gaul]] into [[Etruscan]] territory, which they took by force of arms. The Gauls were lead by [[Brennus]] of the [[Senones]] tribe, and the Romans sent an envoy of three delegates to meet with him and determine his intentions and, covertly, the strength of his army. The meeting did not go well, and ended in violence. [[Brennus]], taken aback by what he referred to as a violation of the '''Laws of War''', demanded the three [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] be handed over to him for punishment. The Romans refused, leading the Gauls to march on Rome in July, 387 BC. In response, the Romans, under [[A.Quintus Sulpicius]], attempted to form a defense against the approaching Gauls. The result was a crushing defeat of the Romans near the [[River Allia]], and the subsequent sack of [[Rome]]. The Romans retreated to the citadel on the [[Capitoline Hill]], and remained in relative safety as they watched the looting and burning of the city. After a period of seven months of Gallic occupation of the city, the Romans approached [[Brennus]] for terms of peace. Brennus settled on the sum of one-thousand pounds of gold, and the Gauls subsequently departed Rome.

Foreign dominance led to internal strife. Senators became rich at the [[Roman province|provinces]]' expense, but soldiers, who were mostly small-scale farmers, were away from home longer and could not maintain their land, and the increased reliance on foreign [[slavery in antiquity|slaves]] and the growth of ''[[latifundia]]'' reduced the availability of paid work.<ref>Duiker, 2001. pages 136-137.</ref><ref>[http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~rauhn/fall_of_republic.htm Fall of the Roman Republic, 133-27 BC].

[[Image:Forum Romanum panorama 2.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Roman Forum]] was the central area around which ancient Rome developed, and served as a hub for daily Roman life.]]

Life in ancient Rome revolved around the city of [[Rome]], located on [[Seven hills of Rome|seven hills]]. The city had a vast number of [[monument]]al structures like the [[Colosseum]], the [[Forum of Trajan]] and the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]. It had fountains with fresh drinking-water supplied by hundreds of miles of [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]], [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]], [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]s, [[thermae|bath complexes]] complete with libraries and shops, marketplaces, and functional sewers. Throughout the territory under the control of ancient Rome, residential [[architecture]] ranged from very modest houses to [[Roman villa|country villas]]. In the [[capital city]] of Rome, there were [[Roman Empire|imperial]] [[House|residences]] on the elegant [[Palatine Hill]], from which the word ''palace'' is derived. The low and middle classes lived in the city center, packed into [[apartment]]s, which were almost like modern [[ghetto]]s.

The imperial city of Rome was the largest urban center of its time, with a population of about one million people (about the size of London in the early 19th century, when London was the largest city in the world), with some high-end estimates of 14 million and low-end estimates of 450,000.<ref>Duiker, 2001. page 149.</ref><ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20586744.html ''Abstrat of'' The population of ancient Rome.] by Glenn R.

Most of these centers had a [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] and temples and same type of buildings, on a smaller scale, as found in Rome.

===Government===
{{details|Democracy in Ancient Rome}}
[[Image:Julius Caesar.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Julius Caesar]], whose rise to power and assassination set the stage for [[Augustus]] to establish himself as the first ''[[Princeps]]''.]]

Initially, Rome was ruled by [[Roman Kingdom|kings]], who were elected from each of Rome's major tribes in turn.<ref>Matyszak, 2003. pages 16-42.</ref> The exact nature of the king's power is uncertain. He may have held near-absolute power, or may also have merely been the [[chief executive]] of the [[SPQR|Senate and the people]]. At least in military matters, the king's authority (''[[Imperium]]'') was likely absolute. He was also the head of the [[Roman religion|state religion]]. In addition to the authority of the King, there were three administrative assemblies: the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], which acted as an advisory body for the King; the [[Curiate Assembly|Comitia Curiata]], which could endorse and ratify laws suggested by the King; and the [[Comitia Calata]], which was an assembly of the priestly college which could assemble the people in order to bear witness to certain acts, hear proclamations, and declare the [[Festival|feast]] and holiday schedule for the next month.

The [[class struggle]]s of the [[Roman Republic]] resulted in an unusual mixture of [[democracy]] and [[oligarchy]]. The word republic comes from the Latin ''res publica'' which literally translates to public business. Roman laws traditionally could only be passed by a vote of the Popular assembly ([[Comitia Tributa]]). Likewise, candidates for public positions had to run for election by the people. However, the [[Roman Senate]] represented an oligarchic institution, which acted as an advisory body. In the Republic, the Senate held great authority (''auctoritas''), but no actual legislative power; it was technically only an advisory council. However, as the Senators were individually very influential, it was difficult to accomplish anything against the collective will of the Senate. New Senators were chosen from among the most accomplished [[patrician]]s by [[Censor (ancient Rome)|Censor]]s (''Censura''), who could also remove a Senator from his office if he was found "morally corrupt"; a charge that could include [[bribery]] or, as under [[Cato the Elder]], embracing one's wife in public. Later, under the reforms of the dictator [[Sulla]], [[Quaestor]]s were made automatic members of the Senate, though most of his reforms did not survive.

The Republic had no fixed [[bureaucracy]], and collected [[Taxation|taxes]] through the practice of [[tax farming]]. Government positions such as [[quaestor]], [[aedile]], or [[praefect]] were funded from the office-holder's private finances. In order to prevent any citizen from gaining too much power, new [[magistrate]]s were elected annually and had to share power with a colleague. For example, under normal conditions, the highest authority was held by two [[consul]]s. In an emergency, a temporary [[Roman dictator|dictator]] could be appointed. Throughout the Republic, the administrative system was revised several times to comply with new demands. In the end, it proved inefficient for controlling the ever-expanding dominion of Rome, contributing to the establishment of the [[Roman Empire]].

In the early Empire, the pretense of a republican form of government was maintained. The [[Roman Emperor]] was portrayed as only a ''[[princeps]]'', or "first citizen", and the Senate gained legislative power and all legal authority previously held by the popular assemblies. However, the rule of the emperors became increasingly [[autocratic]] over time, and the Senate was reduced to an advisory body appointed by the emperor. The Empire did not inherit a set bureaucracy from the Republic, since the Republic did not have any permanent governmental structures apart from the Senate. The Emperor appointed assistants and advisers, but the state lacked many institutions, such as a centrally planned [[budget]]. Some historians have cited this as a significant reason for the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].

The territory of the Empire was divided into [[Roman province|provinces]]. The number of provinces increased with time, both as new territories were conquered and as provinces were divided into smaller units to discourage [[rebellion]]s by powerful local rulers.<ref name=Atlas/> Upon the rise of [[Augustus]] and the [[Principate]], the provinces were divided into imperial and senatorial provinces, depending on which institution had the right to select the governor. During the [[Tetrarchy]], the provinces of the empire were divided into 12 [[diocese]]s, each headed by a ''[[praetor|praetor vicarius]]''. The civilian and military authority were separated, with civilian matters still administered by the governor, but with military command transferred to a ''[[dux]]''.

On a local level, towns were divided into [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]], colonies composed of former soldiers or members of the Roman underclass, and ''municipia'', towns composed of enfranchised provincials. These cities were given constitutions based on the Roman model, with the elected ''duovirs'' and ''aediles'' serving as magistrates, and with the local ''curia'', appointed from men of property for life, serving in an advisory capability, similar to the Senate.

===Law===
{{main|Roman law}}

The roots of the legal principles and practices of the ancient Romans may be traced to the law of the [[twelve tables]] (from 449 BC) to the [[Corpus Iuris Civilis|codification]] of Emperor [[Justinian I]] (around 530 AD). Roman law as preserved in Justinian's codes continued into the [[Byzantine Empire]], and formed the basis of similar codifications in continental [[Western Europe]]. Roman law continued, in a broader sense, to be applied throughout most of Europe until the end of the 17th century.

The major divisions of the law of ancient Rome, as contained within the Justinian and Theodosian law codes, consisted of ''Ius Civile'', ''Ius Gentium'', and ''Ius Naturale''. The ''Ius Civile'' ("Citizen law") was the body of common laws that applied to Roman citizens.<ref>Adkins, 1998. page 46.</ref> The [[Praetor#Praetor Urbanus|''Praetores Urbani'']] (''sg. Praetor Urbanus'') were the individuals who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens. The ''Ius Gentium'' ("Law of nations") was the body of common laws that applied to foreigners, and their dealings with Roman citizens.<ref>Duiker, 2001. page 146.</ref> The [[Praetor#Praetor Peregrinus|''Praetores Peregrini'']] (''sg. Praetor Peregrinus'') were the individuals who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens and foreigners. ''Ius Naturale'' encompassed natural law, the body of laws that were considered common to all being.

===Economy===
{{see|Roman commerce|Roman finance|Roman currency|Roman agriculture}}
[[Image:Maximinus denarius.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman currency|Roman]] [[denarius]], a standardized [[silver]] coin.]]
Ancient Rome commanded a vast area of land, with tremendous natural and human resources. As such, Rome's economy remained focused on [[agriculture]] and trade. Agricultural [[free trade]] changed the Italian landscape, and by the 1st century BC, vast [[grape]] and [[olive]] estates had supplanted the [[yeoman]] farmers, who were unable to match the imported grain price. The [[annexation]] of [[Egypt]], [[Sicily]] and [[Tunisia]] in [[North Africa]] provided a continuous supply of grains. In turn, [[olive oil]] and [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] were Italy's main [[export]]s. Two-tier [[crop rotation]] was practiced, but farm productivity was overall low, around 1 ton per [[hectare]].

[[Industry|Industrial]] and [[manufacturing]] activities were smaller. The largest such activity were the [[mining]] and [[quarrying]] of stones, which provided basic construction materials for the buildings of that period. In manufacturing, production was on a relatively small scale, and generally consisted of workshops and small factories that employed at most dozens of workers. However, some [[brick]] factories employed hundreds of workers.

Some economic historians (like [[Peter Temin]]) argue that the economy of the Early Roman Empire was a market economy and one of the most advanced agricultural economies to have existed (in terms of productivity, urbanization and development of capital markets), comparable to the most advanced economies of the world before the [[Industrial Revolution]], namely the economies of 18th century [[England]] and 17th century [[Netherlands]]. There were markets for every type of good, for land, for cargo ships; there was even an insurance market.

The economy of the early Republic was largely based on smallholding and paid labor. However, foreign wars and conquests made [[slavery in antiquity|slaves]] increasingly cheap and plentiful, and by the late Republic, the economy was largely dependent on slave labor for both skilled and unskilled work. Slaves are estimated to have constituted around 20% of the Roman Empire's population at this time and 40% in the city of Rome. Only in the Roman Empire, when the conquests stopped and the prices of slaves increased, did hired labor become more economical than slave ownership.

Although [[barter (economics)|barter]] was used in ancient Rome, and often used in tax collection, Rome had a very developed [[coinage]] system, with [[brass]], [[bronze]], and [[precious metal]] coins in circulation throughout the Empire and beyond&mdash;some have even been discovered in [[India]]. Before the 3rd century BC, [[copper]] was traded by weight, measured in unmarked lumps, across central Italy. The original copper coins (''[[as (coin)|as]]'') had a face value of one [[Pound (weight)#Origins|Roman pound]] of copper, but weighed less. Thus, Roman money's utility as a unit of exchange consistently exceeded its [[intrinsic value]] as metal. After [[Nero]] began debasing the silver [[denarius]], its [[legal tender|legal]] value was an estimated one-third greater than its intrinsic.

Horses were too expensive, and other [[pack animal]]s too slow, for mass trade on the [[Roman road]]s, which connected military posts rather than markets, and were rarely designed for wheels. As a result, there was little transport of [[commodity|commodities]] between Roman regions until the rise of [[Roman commerce#Sea routes|Roman maritime trade]] in the 2nd century BC. During that period, a trading vessel took less than a month to complete a trip from [[Gades]] to [[Alexandria]] via [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]], spanning the entire length of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].<ref name=Atlas/> Transport by sea was around 60 times cheaper than by land, so the volume for such trips was much larger.

===Class structure===
{{main|Social class in ancient Rome}}
[[Image:Toga Illustration.png|thumb|upright|A Roman clad in a [[toga]], the distinctive garment of ancient Rome.]]

Roman society is largely viewed as [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]], with [[slavery in antiquity|slaves]] (''servi'') at the bottom, [[freedman|freedmen]] (''liberti'') above them, and free-born citizens (''cives'') at the top. Free citizens were themselves also divided by class. The broadest, and earliest, division was between the [[patrician]]s, who could trace their ancestry to one of the 100 [[Patriarchs]] at the founding of the city, and the [[plebs|plebeians]], who could not. This became less important in the later Republic, as some plebeian families became wealthy and entered politics, and some patrician families fell on hard times. Anyone, patrician or plebeian, who could count a consul as his ancestor was a [[nobility|noble]] (''nobilis''); a man who was the first of his family to hold the consulship, such as [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] or [[Cicero]], was known as a ''[[novus homo]]'' ("new man") and ennobled his descendants. Patrician ancestry, however, still conferred considerable prestige, and many religious offices remained restricted to patricians.

A class division originally based on military service became more important. Membership of these classes was determined periodically by the [[Censor (ancient Rome)|Censors]], according to property. The wealthiest were the Senatorial class, who dominated politics and command of the army. Next came the [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrians]] (''equites'', sometimes translated "knights"), originally those who could afford a warhorse, who formed a powerful mercantile class. Several further classes, originally based on what military equipment their members could afford, followed, with the ''proletarii'', citizens who had no property at all, at the bottom. Before the reforms of Marius they were ineligible for military service and are often described as being just barely above freed slaves in terms of wealth and prestige.

Voting power in the Republic was dependent on class. Citizens were enrolled in voting "tribes", but the tribes of the richer classes had fewer members than the poorer ones, all the ''proletarii'' being enrolled in a single tribe. Voting was done in class order and stopped as soon as a majority of the tribes had been reached, so the poorer classes were often unable even to cast their votes.

Allied foreign cities were often given the [[Latin Right]], an intermediary level between full citizens and foreigners (''peregrini''), which gave their citizens rights under Roman law and allowed their leading magistrates to become full Roman citizens. While there were varying degrees of Latin rights, the main division was between those ''con suffrage'' ("with vote"; enrolled in a Roman tribe and able to take part in the ''comitia tributa'') and ''sans suffrage'' ("without vote"; unable to take part in Roman politics). Some of Rome's Italian allies were given full citizenship after the [[Social War (91<U+2013>88 BC)|Social War]] of 91&ndash;88 BC, and full [[Roman citizenship]] was extended to all free-born men in the Empire by [[Caracalla]] in 212. Women shared some basic rights with their male counterparts, but were not fully regarded as citizens and were thus not allowed to vote or participate in politics.

===Family===
[[Image:ValentinianIIIfamily.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A group portrait depicted on glass, dating from c.250 A.D., showing a mother, son and daughter. It was once considered to be a depiction of the family of [[Valentinian III]].]]
The basic units of Roman society were [[household]]s and [[Family|families]].<ref name="Duiker346">Duiker, 2001. page 146.</ref> Households included the head (usually the father) of the household, ''[[pater familias]]'' (father of the family), his wife, children, and other relatives. In the upper classes, slaves and servants were also part of the household.<ref name="Duiker346"/> The head of the household had great power (''patria potestas'', "father's power") over those living with him: He could force marriage (usually for money) and divorce, sell his children into slavery, claim his dependents' property as his own, and even had the right to punish or kill family members (though this last right apparently ceased to be exercised after the 1st century BC).<ref name="Cassonpageset1">Casson, 1998. pages 10-11.</ref>

''Patria potestas'' even extended over adult sons with their own households: A man was not considered a ''paterfamilias'', nor could he truly hold property, while his own father lived.<ref name="Cassonpageset1"/><ref>[http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/1/777777121908/ Family Values in Ancient Rome] by [[Richard Saller]]. The University of Chicago Library Digital Collections: Fathom Archive. Written 2001. Visited 2007-[[April 14|4-14]].</ref> During the early period of Rome's history, a daughter, when she married, fell under the control (''manus'') of the ''paterfamilias'' of her husband's household, although by the late Republic this fell out of fashion, as a woman could choose to continue recognizing her father's family as her true family.<ref>Adkins, 1998. page 339.</ref> However, as Romans reckoned [[Kinship and descent|descent]] through the male line, any children she had would belong to her husband's family.<ref>Adkins, 1998. page 340.</ref>

Groups of related households formed a family (''[[gens]]''). Families were based on blood ties or [[adoption]], but were also political and economic alliances. Especially during the [[Roman Republic]], some powerful families, or ''[[Gens|Gentes Maiores]]'', came to dominate political life.

[[Ancient Roman marriage]] was often regarded more as a financial and political alliance than as a romantic association, especially in the upper classes. Fathers usually began seeking husbands for their daughters when they reached an age between twelve and fourteen. The husband was almost always older than the bride. While upper class girls married very young, there is evidence that lower class women often married in their late teens or early twenties.

===Education===

Accessed 2007-[[April 2|4-2]].</ref>
[[Image:Gobustan Rome.jpg|left|thumb|Roman Inscription near [[Baku]] left by soldiers of [[Legio XII Fulminata]], 1st century AD.]]

While Latin remained the main written language of the Roman Empire, [[Greek language|Greek]] came to be the language spoken by the well-educated elite, as most of the literature studied by Romans was written in Greek. In the eastern half of the Roman Empire, which later became the [[Byzantine Empire]], Latin was never able to replace Greek, and after the death of Justinian Greek became the official language of the Byzantine government.<ref>Adkins, 1998. page 203.</ref> The expansion of the Roman Empire spread Latin throughout Europe, and over time Vulgar Latin evolved and [[dialect]]ized in different locations, gradually shifting into a number of distinct [[Romance language]]s.

Although Latin is an [[extinct language]] with very few remaining fluent speakers, it remains in use in many ways, such as through [[Ecclesiastical Latin]], the traditional language of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the official language of the [[Vatican City]]. Additionally, even after fading from common usage Latin maintained a role as western Europe's ''[[lingua franca]]'', an international language of [[academia]] and [[diplomacy]]. Although eventually supplanted in this respect by [[French language|French]] in the 19th century and [[English language|English]] in the 20th, Latin continues to see heavy use in religious, legal, and scientific terminology&mdash;it has been estimated that 80% of all scholarly English words derive directly or indirectly from Latin.

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in ancient Rome|Roman mythology}}

Archaic [[Roman religion]], at least concerning the gods, was made up not of written [[narrative]]s, but rather of complex interrelations between gods and humans.<ref>Matyszak, 2003. page 24.</ref> Unlike in [[Greek mythology]], the gods were not personified, but were vaguely-defined sacred spirits called ''[[numina]]''. Romans also believed that every person, place or thing had its own ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'', or divine soul. During the [[Roman Republic]], [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] was organized under a strict system of priestly offices, which were held by men of senatorial rank. The College of Pontifices was uppermost body in this hierarchy, and its chief priest, the ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', was the head of the state religion. [[Flamen]]s took care of the cults of various gods, while [[augur]]s were trusted with taking the [[auspice]]s. The [[rex sacrorum|sacred king]] took on the religious responsibilities of the deposed kings. In the Roman empire, emperors were held to be gods, and the formalized [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]] became increasingly prominent.

As contact with the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] increased, the old Roman gods became increasingly associated with Greek gods.<ref>Willis, 2000. page 168.</ref> Thus, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was perceived to be the same deity as [[Zeus]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] became associated with [[Ares]], and Neptune with [[Poseidon]]. The Roman gods also assumed the attributes and mythologies of these Greek gods. The transferral of [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] qualities to Roman Gods, and the prevalence of [[Greek philosophy]] among well-educated Romans, brought about an increasing neglect of the old rites, and in the 1st century BC, the religious importance of the old priestly offices declined rapidly, though their civic importance and political influence remained. Roman religion in the empire tended more and more to center on the imperial house, and several emperors were [[Theosis|deified]] after their deaths.

Under the empire, the Romans absorbed the mythologies of their conquered subjects, often leading to situations in which the temples and priests of traditional Italian deities existed side by side with those of foreign gods.<ref>Willis, 2000. page 166.</ref> Numerous foreign [[cult]]s grew popular, such as the worship of the Egyptian [[Isis]] and the [[Iran|Persian]] [[Mithras]]. Beginning in the 2nd century, [[Christianity]] began to spread in the Empire, despite initial [[persecution]]. Beginning with Emperor [[Nero]], Roman official policy towards Christianity was negative, and at some points, simply being a Christian could be punishable by death. Under Emperor [[Diocletian]], the [[persecution of Christians]] reached its peak. However, it became an officially supported religion in the Roman state under [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] and became exponentially popular. After a brief and unsuccessful pagan revival by the emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]<ref>[http://www.roman-emperors.org/julian.htm Julian the Apostate (360-363 AD)] by Walter Roberts and Michael DiMaio, Jr. De Imperatoribus Romanis.

===Art, music and literature===
{{main|Roman art|Latin literature|Roman sculpture|Roman music}}
<!--Please stick to discussing Roman literature, art, and music in general in this section: few, if any, specific authors, sculptors, etc. should be mentioned. Instead, very brief details about the most major Roman artists and authors should be included in the "Culture of ancient Rome" article, which has multiple distinct sections for art, literature, music, etc.-->

Roman [[painting]] styles show [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] influences, and surviving examples are primarily [[frescoes]] used to adorn the walls and ceilings of country [[villas]], though [[Roman literature]] includes mentions of paintings on [[wood]], [[ivory]], and other materials.<ref name=Addypaint>Adkins, 1998. pages 350-352.</ref><ref name=MetstuffonRpaint>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropt/hd_ropt.htm Roman Painting] from Timeline of Art History. Department of Greek and Roman Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Written 2004-10. Accessed 2007-[[April 22|4-22]].</ref> Several examples of Roman painting have been found at [[Pompeii]], and from these art historians divide the history of Roman painting into four periods. The first style of Roman painting was practiced from the early 2nd century BC to the early- or mid-1st century BC. It was mainly composed of imitations of [[marble]] and [[masonry]], though sometimes including depictions of mythological characters. The second style of Roman painting began during the early 1st century BC, and attempted to realistically depict three-dimensional architectural features and landscapes. The third style occurred during the reign of [[Augustus]] (27 BC <U+2013> 14 AD), and rejected the [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] of the second style in favor of simple ornamentation. A small architectural scene, landscape, or abstract design was placed in the center with a [[wiktionary:monochrome|monochrome]] background. The fourth style, which began in the 1st century AD, depicted scenes from mythology, while retaining architectural details and abstract patterns.<ref name=Addypaint/><ref name=MetstuffonRpaint/>

Portrait sculpture during the period utilized youthful and classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism. During the [[Antonines|Antonine]] and [[Severan dynasty|Severan]] periods, more ornate hair and bearding became prevalent, created with deeper cutting and drilling. Advancements were also made in [[Relief|relief sculptures]], usually depicting Roman victories.

[[Latin literature]] was from its very inception influenced heavily by Greek authors. Some of the earliest extant works are of historical [[Epic poetry|epics]] telling the early military history of Rome. As the Republic expanded, authors began to produce [[poetry]], [[comedy]], [[history]], and [[tragedy]].

[[Roman music]] was largely based on [[Ancient Greek music|Greek music]], and played an important part in many aspects of Roman life.<ref name=iClassics>[http://www.iclassics.com/periodArticle?contentId=3003 Chronology: Ancient and Medieval: Ancient Rome]. iClassics.

===Games and activities===

The youth of Rome had several forms of play and exercise, such as [[jumping]], [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], and [[racing]].<ref name=Cassononsports>Casson, 1998. pages 98-108.</ref> In the countryside, pastimes for the wealthy also included fishing and hunting.<ref name=SPQRonline>[http://library.thinkquest.org/26602/entertainment.htm#leisure Daily Life: Entertainment].

For the wealthy, dinner parties presented an opportunity for entertainment, sometimes featuring music, dancing, and poetry readings.<ref name=Adkinsonparties>Adkins, 1998. page 350.</ref> Plebeians sometimes enjoyed such parties through clubs or associations, although recreational dining usually meant patronizing [[taverns]].<ref name=Adkinsonparties/> Children entertained themselves with toys and such games as [[leapfrog]].<ref name=SPQRonline/><ref name=Adkinsonparties/>

A popular form of entertainment were [[gladiator]]ial combats. Gladiators fought either to the death, or to "first blood" with a variety of weapons and in a variety of different scenarios. These fights achieved their height of popularity under the emperor [[Claudius]], who placed the final outcome of the combat firmly in the hands of the emperor with a hand gesture. Contrary to popular representations in film, several experts believe the gesture for death was not "thumbs down". Although no one is certain as to what the gestures were, some experts conclude that the emperor would signify "death" by holding a raised fist to the winning combatant and then extending his thumb upwards, while "mercy" was indicated by a raised fist with no extended thumb.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/polliceverso.html The Gladiator and the Thumb]. Encyclopedia Romana. University of Chicago. Accessed 2007-[[April 24|4-24]].</ref> Animal shows were also popular with the Romans, where foreign animals were either displayed for the public or combined with gladiatorial combat. A prisoner or gladiator, armed or unarmed, was thrown into the arena and an animal was released.

The ''[[Circus Maximus]]'', another popular site in Rome, was primarily used for [[Horse racing|horse]] and [[chariot racing]], and when the circus was flooded, there were even sea battles. It was also used in many other events.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/circusmaximus/circusmaximus.html Circus Maximus]. Encyclopedia Romana. University of Chicago. Accessed 2007-[[April 19|4-19]].</ref> It could hold up to 385,000 people;<ref>[http://www.athenapub.com/rhone1.htm Athena Review I,4: Romans on the Rh<U+00F4>ne: Arles]</ref> people all over Rome would visit it. Two temples, one with seven large eggs and one with seven dolphins, lay in the middle of the track of Circus Maximus, and whenever the racers made a lap, one of each would be removed. This was done to keep the spectators and the racers informed on the race statistics. Other than sports, the Circus Maximus was also an area of [[marketing]] and [[gambling]]. Higher authorities, like the emperor, also attended games in the Circus Maximus, as it was rude not to. They, knights, and many other people who were involved with the race sat in reserved seats located above everyone else. It was also found rude for emperors to root for a team. The Circus Maximus was created in 600 BC and hosted the last horse-racing game in 549 AD, lasting for over a millennium.

== Technology ==
{{main|Ancient Roman technology}}
[[Image:RomanAbacusRecon.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman abacus]], based on the Babylonian abacus, was one of the first portable calculating devices, and helped speed up the use of [[Roman arithmetic]].]]

Ancient Rome boasted the most impressive technological feats of its day, using many advancements that would be lost in the [[Middle Ages]] and not be rivaled again until the 19th and 20th centuries. But though adept at adopting and synthesizing other cultures' technologies, the Roman civilization was not especially innovative or progressive. Many practical Roman innovations were adopted from earlier Greek designs. New ideas were rarely developed. Roman society considered the articulate soldier who could wisely govern a large household the ideal, and [[Roman law]] made no provisions for [[intellectual property]] or the promotion of invention. The concept of "scientists" and "engineers" did not yet exist, and advancements were often divided based on craft, as groups of [[trade (profession)|artisans]] jealously guarded new technologies as [[trade secret]]s. Nevertheless, a number of vital technological breakthroughs were spread and thoroughly used by Rome, contributing to an enormous degree to Rome's dominance and lasting influence in Europe.

=== Engineering ===
{{main|Roman engineering|Roman military engineering}}

[[Roman engineering]] constituted a large portion of Rome's technological superiority and legacy, and contributed to the construction of hundreds of roads, bridges, [[aqueduct]]s, [[public bathing|bath]]s, [[theater]]s and [[arena]]s. Many monuments, such as the [[Colosseum]], [[Pont du Gard]], and [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], still remain as testaments to Roman engineering and culture.

=== Architecture ===
{{main|Roman architecture}}

The Romans were particularly renowned for their [[Roman architecture|architecture]], which is grouped with Greek traditions into "[[Classical architecture]]". During the Roman Republic, it remained stylistically almost identical to [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek architecture]]. Although there were many differences from Greek architecture, Rome borrowed heavily from Greece in adhering to strict, formulaic building designs and proportions. Aside from two new [[classical order|orders]] of columns, [[composite order|composite]] and [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], and from the [[dome]], which was derived from the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[arch]], Rome had relatively few architectural innovations until the end of the Republic.

Then, in the 1st century BC, Romans started to widely use [[concrete]], invented in the late 3rd century BC. It was a powerful [[cement]] derived from [[pozzolana]], and soon supplanted [[marble]] as the chief Roman building material and allowed many daring architectural schemata. Also in the 1st century BC, [[Vitruvius]] wrote ''[[De architectura]]'', possibly the first complete treatise on architecture in history. In late 1st century BC, Rome also began to use [[glassblowing]] soon after its invention in [[Syria]] about 50 BC. [[Mosaic]]s took the Empire by storm after samples were retrieved during [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]'s campaigns in Greece.

=== Roads ===
[[Image:RomaViaAppiaAntica03.JPG|thumb|The [[Appian Way]] (''Via Appia''), a road connecting the city of [[Rome]] to the southern parts of [[Italy]], remains usable even today.]]

Concrete made possible the paved, durable [[Roman road]]s, many of which were still in use a thousand years after the fall of Rome. The construction of a vast and efficient travel network throughout the Empire dramatically increased Rome's power and influence. It was originally constructed to allow [[Roman legion]]s to be rapidly deployed. But these highways also had enormous economic significance, solidifying Rome's role as a trading crossroads&mdash;the origin of the saying "all roads lead to Rome". The Roman government maintained way stations which provided refreshments to travelers at regular intervals along the roads, constructed bridges where necessary, and established a system of horse relays for [[courier]]s that allowed a dispatch to travel up to 800 kilometers (500 mi) in 24 hours.

=== Aqueducts ===
[[Image:Pont du gard.jpg|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]] in [[France]] is a [[Roman aqueduct]] built in c. 19 BC. It is one of France's top tourist attractions and a [[World Heritage Site]].]]
The Romans constructed numerous [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]] to supply water to cities and industrial sites and to assist in [[Roman agriculture|their agriculture]]. The city of Rome was supplied by 11 aqueducts with a combined length of 350 kilometres (220&nbsp;mi).<ref name=frontinus>Frontinus</ref> Most aqueducts were constructed below the surface, with only small portions above ground supported by arches. Sometimes, where depressions deeper than 50 metres (165&nbsp;ft) had to be crossed, [[inverted siphon]]s were used to force water uphill.{{ref|waterhistory}}

=== Sewers ===
The Romans also made major advancements in [[sanitation]]. Romans were particularly famous for their public [[bathing|baths]], called ''[[thermae]]'', which were used for both hygienic and social purposes. Many Roman houses came to have [[flush toilet]]s and [[domestic water system|indoor plumbing]], and a complex [[sewer]] system, the ''[[Cloaca Maxima]]'', was used to drain the local [[marsh]]es and carry waste into the Tiber river. Some historians have speculated that the use of [[lead]] pipes in the sewer and plumbing systems led to widespread [[lead poisoning]] which contributed to the decline in [[birth rate]] and general decay of Roman society leading up to the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall of Rome]]. However, lead content would have been minimized because the flow of water from aqueducts could not be shut off; it ran continuously through public and private outlets into the drains, and only a small number of taps were in use.<ref>''Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply'' by A.T. Hodge (1992)</ref>

[[Image:Cornicen on Trajan's column.JPG|thumb|200px|Roman soldiers on the cast of [[Trajan's Column]] in the Victoria and Albert museum, London.]]

The early Roman army (c. 500 BC) was, like those of other contemporary city-states influenced by Greek civilization, a citizen ''[[militia]]'' which practiced [[hoplite]] tactics. It was small (the population of free males of military age was then about 9,000) and organized in five classes (in parallel to the ''[[Roman assemblies|comitia centuriata]]'', the body of citizens organized politically), with three providing hoplites and two providing light infantry. The early Roman army was tactically limited and its stance during this period was essentially defensive.<ref>John Keegan, ''A History of Warfare'', Alfred A. Knopf (New York 1993) [ISBN 0-394-58801-0], p.263; David Potter, "The Roman Army and Navy," in Harriet I. Flower, editor, ''The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic'', Cambridge University Press (Cambridge U.K. 2004) [ISBN 0-521-00390-3], pp. 67-69. For a discussion of hoplite tactics and their sociocultural setting, see Victor Davis Hanson, ''The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece'', Alfred A. Knopf (New York 1989) [ISBN 0-394-57188-6].</ref> By the 3rd century BC, the Romans abandoned the hoplite formation in favor of a more flexible system in which smaller groups of 120 (or in some cases 60) men called ''[[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]]'' could maneuver more independently on the battlefield. Thirty maniples arranged in three lines with supporting troops constituted a [[legion]], totaling between 4,000 and 5,000 men. The early Republican legion consisted of five sections, each of which was equipped differently and had different places in formation: the three lines of manipular heavy infantry (''[[hastati]]'', ''[[principes]]'' and ''[[triarii]])'', a force of light infantry (''[[velites]]''), and the cavalry (''[[equites]]''). With the new organization came a new orientation toward the offensive and a much more aggressive posture toward adjoining city-states.<ref>Keegan, p. 264; Potter, pp. 69-70.</ref>

At nominal full strength, an early Republican legion would have included 3,600 to 4,800 heavy infantry, several hundred light infantry and several hundred cavalrymen, for a total of 4,000 to 5,000 men.<ref>Keegan, p.264; Adrian Goldsworthy, ''The Roman Army at War 100 BC - CE200'', Oxford University Press (Oxford 1996) [ISBN 0-19-815057-1], p. 33; Jo-Ann Shelton, ed., ''As the Romans Did: A Sourcebook in Roman Social History'', Oxford University Press (New York 1998)[ISBN 0-19-508974-X], pp. 245-249.</ref> Legions were often significantly understrength from recruitment failures or following periods of active service due to accidents, battle casualties, disease and desertion. During the Civil War, Pompey's legions in the east were at full strength because recently recruited, while Caesar's legions were in many cases well below nominal strength after long active service in Gaul. This pattern also held true for auxiliary forces.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Roman Army'', pp. 22-24, 37-38; Adrian Goldsworthy, ''Caesar: Life of a Colossus'', Yale University Press (New Haven 2006) [ISBN-10: 0300120486, ISBN-13: 978-0-300-12048-6], pp. 384, 410-411, 425-427. Another important factor discussed by Goldsworthy was absence of legionaries on detached duty.</ref>

As described by Goldsworthy, both the Greek and Roman phalanx and the early Republican legions were intended to fight large scale battles involving a single quick, decisive clash with the enemy. At this they were generally very successful.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Roman Army'', pp. 33, 37.</ref> At the time of the [[Marian reforms]] in the late Republic (c. 100 BC), further organizational change created a more flexible, resilient and versatile force. The legion was now divided into ten cohorts of 480 men each, comprising three of the old maniples (now called [[Centuria|''centuriae'']] or "centuries" commanded by a [[centurion]]).<ref>Later in the Imperial period, the first cohort grew to a nominal strength of 800 men organized in five ''centuriae'' commanded by the ''primi ordines'', the senior centurions of the legion. Goldsworthy, ''The Roman Army'', p.14.</ref> Moreover, the ''velites'' (light infantry) and (probably) the ''equites'' were eliminated and replaced by [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|''auxilia'']] (auxiliary units of cavalry, archers and slingers, and light infantry, usually recruited from non-citizens). There were no other subdivisions within a legion, but many men with specialized skills<U+2014>medics, engineers, technicians, artillerymen<U+2014>were included among the legionaries.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Roman Army'', pp. 16-17.</ref> The centuries in a cohort had a unified command structure and were experienced at working with the other centuries in the cohort as a unit. A legion organized in cohorts was easier to control, and cohorts could easily be detached and act independently where that was useful on the battlefield or a separate smaller force was needed. Accordingly, legions organized in cohorts could conduct operations of almost any scale.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Roman Army'', pp.33-35.</ref>

Three long-term trends characterized the development of the Roman army over its history: increasing professionalization, a widening of the base for recruitment, and an increase in the variety and flexibility of military units. Until the late Republican period, the typical legionary was a property-owning citizen farmer from a rural areas (an ''adsiduus'') who served for particular (often annual) campaigns,<ref>Between 343 BC and 241 BC, the Roman army fought every year except for five. Stephen P. Oakley, "The Early Republic," in Harriet I. Flower, editor, ''The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic'', Cambridge University Press (Cambridge U.K. 2004) [ISBN 0-521-00390-3], p. 27.</ref> and who supplied his own equipment and, in the case of ''equites'', his own mount. Harris suggests that down to 200 BC, the average rural farmer (who survived) might participate in six or seven campaigns. Freedmen and slaves (wherever resident) and urban citizens did not serve except in rare emergencies.<ref> P. A. Brunt, "Army and Land in the Roman Republic," in ''The Fall of the Roman Republic and Related Essays'', Oxford University Press (Oxford 1988) [ISBN 0-19-814849-6], p.253; William V. Harris, ''War and Imperialism in Republican Rome 327-70 BC'', Oxford University Press (Oxford 1979) [ISBN 0-19-814866-6], p. 44.</ref> After 200 BC, economic conditions in rural areas deteriorated as manpower needs increased, so that the property qualifications for service were gradually reduced. Beginning with [[Gaius Marius]] in 107 BC, citizens without property and some urban-dwelling citizens (''proletarii'') were enlisted and provided with equipment, although most legionaries continued to come from rural areas. Terms of service became continuous and long<U+2014>up to twenty years if emergencies required it although Brunt argues that six or seven years was more typical.<ref>Keegan, pp. 273-274; Brunt, pp. 253-259; Harris, pp. 44-50.</ref> Beginning in the 3rd century BC, legionaries were paid ''stipendium'' (amounts are disputed but Caesar famously "doubled" payments to his troops to 225 [[Denarius|''denarii'']] a year), could anticipate booty and donatives (distributions of plunder by commanders) from successful campaigns and, beginning at the time of Marius, often were granted allotments of land upon retirement.<ref>Keegan, p. 264; Brunt, pp. 259-265; Potter, pp. 80-83.</ref> Cavalry and light infantry attached to a legion (the ''auxilia'') were often recruited in the areas where the legion served. These troops were familiar with local conditions and fought in a style adapted to the local terrain.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Roman Army'', pp. 35-36.</ref> Caesar formed a legion, the Fifth Alaudae, from non-citizens in Transalpine Gaul to serve in his campaigns in Gaul.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''Caesar'', pp. 391.</ref> During the Civil War when large armies were required, both sides raised legions from non-citizens, as Goldsworthy notes, "without bothering with the formality of granting citizenship to the men on enlistment."<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Roman Army'', pp. 35-36.</ref> By the time of Caesar Augustus, the ideal of the citizen-soldier had been abandoned and the legions had become fully professional. Legionaries were paid 900 [[Sestertius|''sesterces'']] a year and could expect a payment of 12,000 ''sesterces'' on retirement.<ref>Karl Christ, ''The Romans'', University of California Press (Berkeley, 1984)[ISBN 0-520-04566-1], pp. 74-76 .</ref>

At the end of the [[Civil war between Antony and Octavian|Civil War]], Augustus reorganized Roman military forces, discharging soldiers and disbanding legions. He retained 28 legions, which were now based in permanent camps on the frontier along the Rhine and Danube Rivers and in Syria. Composed of about 150,000 citizen legionaries, an approximately equal number of ''auxilia'' and a navy of unknown size, this establishment remained the standard until late in the history of the Empire.<ref> Christopher S. Mackay, ''Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History,'' Cambridge University Press, (Cambridge, U.K. 2004), pp. 249-250. Mackay points out that the number of legions (not necessarily the number of legionaries) grew to 30 by 125 AD and 33 during the [[Severan dynasty|Severan]] period (200<U+2013>235 AD).</ref> During the [[Principate]], with a few exceptions,<ref>For example, the Pannonian Revolt (6<U+2013>9 AD), periodic wars against the Parthians, and campaigns by Domitian and Trajan against the Dacians.</ref>  warfare was conducted on a smaller scale. The ''auxilia'' were not organized into larger units but remained independent cohorts, and legionary troops themselves often operated as groups of cohorts rather than as full legions. A new versatile type of unit, the ''cohortes equitatae'', combining cavalry and legionaries in a single formation could be stationed at garrisons or outposts, could fight on their own as balanced small forces or could combine with other similar units as a larger legion-sized force. This increase in organizational flexibility over time helped ensure the long-term success of Roman military forces.<ref>Goldsworthy, <U+2018><U+2019>The Roman Army<U+2019><U+2019>, p.36-37.</ref>

The Emperor [[Gallienus]] (253<U+2013>268 AD) began yet another reorganization that created the final military structure of the late Empire. Withdrawing some legionaries from the fixed bases on the border, Gallienus created mobile forces (the ''[[Comitatenses]]'' or field armies) and stationed them behind and at some distance from the borders as a strategic reserve. This reduced the need to move troops from one province to another to reinforce the border in case of attacks. The border troops (''limitanei'') stationed at fixed bases continued to be the first line of defense. The Emperor [[Diocletian]] (284<U+2013>305 AD) reversed this reorganization but it became the norm by the middle of the 4th century AD. Diocletian also introduced the so-called [[Tetrarchy]] under which the Eastern and Western halves of the Empire were each governed by an "Augustus" (Emperor) and a "Caesar" (junior Emperor), who resided at different locations near the borders and commanded troops within their respective regions.<ref> Mackay, pp. 275, 279-281.</ref> The basic unit of the field army was the "regiment", ''legiones'' or ''auxilia'' for infantry and ''vexellationes'' for cavalry. Evidence suggests that nominal strengths may have been 1,200 men for infantry regiments and 600 for cavalry, although many records show lower actual troop levels (800 and 400). Many infantry and cavalry regiments operated in pairs under the command of a ''[[comes]]''. In addition to Roman troops, the field armies included regiments of "barbarians" recruited from allied tribes and known as ''[[foederati]]''. By 400 AD, ''foederati'' regiments had become permanently established units of the Roman army, paid and equipped by the Empire, led by a Roman tribune and used just as Roman units were used. In addition to the ''foederati'', the Empire also used groups of barbarians to fight along with the legions as "allies" without integration into the field armies. Under the command of the senior Roman general present, they were led at lower levels by their own officers.<ref>Hugh Elton, ''Warfare in Roman Europe AD 350-425'', Oxford University Press (Oxford 1996)[ISBN 0-19-815241-8] pp. 89-96.</ref>

The nature of military leadership evolved greatly over the course of the history of Rome. Under the monarchy, the hoplite armies would have been led by the kings of Rome. During the early and middle Roman Republic, military forces were under the command of one of the two elected [[Roman consul|consuls]] for the year. During the later Republic, members of the Roman Senatorial elite, as part of the normal sequence of elected public offices known as the [[Cursus honorum|''cursus honorum'']], would have served first as [[Quaestor|''quaestor'']] (often posted as deputies to field commanders), then as [[Praetor|''praetor'']] (sometimes posted as provincial governors in charge of military forces in the relevant province), then as consul (supreme command of all military forces). Following the end of a term as praetor or consul, a Senator might be appointed by the Senate as a [[Promagistrate|''propraetor'']] or [[Promagistrate|''proconsul'']] (depending on the highest office previously held) to govern a foreign province. More junior officers (down to but not including the level of centurion) were selected by their commanders from their own [[Client (ancient Rome)|''clientelae'']] or those recommended by political allies among the Senatorial elite.<ref>T. Correy Brennan, "Power and Process Under the Republican 'Constitution'," in Harriet I. Flower, editor, ''The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic'', Cambridge University Press (Cambridge U.K. 2004) [ISBN 0-521-00390-3], Chapter 2; Potter, pp. 66-88; Goldsworthy, ''The Roman Army'', pp. 121-125. Julius Caesar's most talented, effective and reliable subordinate in Gaul, [[Titus Labienus]], was recommended to him by [[Pompey]]. Goldsworthy, ''The Roman Army'', p. 124.</ref> Under Augustus, whose most important political priority was to place the military under a permanent and unitary command, the Emperor was the legal commander of each legion but exercised that command through a [[Legatus|''legatus'']] (legate) he appointed from the Senatorial elite. In a province with a single legion, the legate would command the legion (''legatus legionis'') and also serve as provincial governor, while in a province with more than one legion, each legion would be commanded by a legate and the legates would be commanded by the provincial governor (also a legate but of higher rank).<ref>Mackay, pp. 245-252.</ref> During the later stages of the Imperial period (beginning perhaps with [[Diocletian]]), the Augustan model was abandoned. Provincial governors were stripped of military authority, and command of the armies in a group of provinces was given to generals ([[Dux|''duces'']]) appointed by the Emperor. These were no longer members of the Roman elite but men who came up through the ranks and had seen much practical soldiering. With increasing frequency, these men attempted (sometimes successfully) to usurp the positions of the Emperors who had appointed them. Decreased resources, increasing political chaos and civil war eventually left the Western Empire vulnerable to attack and takeover by neighboring barbarian peoples.<ref>MacKay, pp. 295-296 and Chapters 23-24.</ref>

Comparatively less is known about the Roman navy than the Roman army. Prior to the middle of the 3rd century BC, officials known as ''duumviri navales'' commanded a fleet of twenty ships used mainly to control piracy. This fleet was given up in 278 AD and replaced by allied forces. The [[Punic Wars|First Punic War]] required that Rome build large fleets, and it did so largely with the assistance of and financing from allies. This reliance on allies continued to the end of the Roman Republic. The [[Quinquereme|quinquireme]] was the main warship on both sides of the Punic Wars and remained the mainstay of Roman naval forces until replaced by the time of Caesar Augustus by lighter and more maneuverable vessels. As compared with a [[trireme]], the quinquireme permitted the use of a mix of experienced and inexperienced crewmen (an advantage for a primarily land-based power), and its lesser maneuverability permitted the Romans to adopt and perfect [[Corvus (weapon)|boarding tactics]] using a troop of approximately 40 marines in lieu of the [[Naval tactics in the Age of Galleys|ram]]. Ships were commanded by a [[Navarch|''navarch'']], a rank equivalent to a centurion, who were usually not citizens. Potter suggests that because the fleet was dominated by non-Romans, the navy was considered non-Roman and allowed to atrophy in times of peace.<ref>This paragraph is based upon Potter, pp. 76-78.</ref>

Available information suggests that by the time of the late Empire (350 AD), the Roman navy comprised a number of fleets including both warships and merchant vessels for transportation and supply. Warships were oared sailing galleys with three to five banks of oarsmen. Fleet bases included such ports as Ravenna, Arles, Aquilea, Misenum and the mouth of the Somme River in the West and Alexandria and Rhodes in the East. Flotillas of small river craft (''classes'') were part of the ''limitanei'' (border troops) during this period, based at fortified river harbors along the Rhine and the Danube. The fact that prominent generals commanded both armies and fleets suggests that naval forces were treated as auxiliaries to the army and not as an independent service. The details of command structure and fleet strengths during this period are not well known although it is known that fleets were commanded by prefects.<ref>This discussion is based upon Elton, pp. 97-99 and 100-101.</ref>

==Scholarly studies==
The interest in studying ancient Rome arose presumably during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in [[France]]. [[Charles Montesquieu]] wrote a work ''Reflections on the Causes of the Grandeur and Declension of the Romans''. The first major work was ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' by [[Edward Gibbon]], which encompassed the period from the end of 2nd century to the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453. Like Montesquieu Gibbon paid high tribute to the virtue of Roman citizens. [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] was a founder of the criticism and wrote ''The Roman History'', carried until the [[First Punic war]]. Niebuhr has made an attempt to determine the way the Roman tradition appeared. According to him, Romans, like other people, had a historical [[ethos]] which was preserved mainly in the noble families. During the [[Napoleonic]] period the work titled ''The History of Romans'' by [[Victor Duruy]] appeared. It highlighted the [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]ean period popular at the time. ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'', ''[[Roman constitutional law]]'' and ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', all by [[Theodor Mommsen]], became very important milestones. Later the work ''Greatness and Decline of Rome'' by [[Guglielmo Ferrero]] was published. The Russian work ''<U+041E><U+0447><U+0435><U+0440><U+043A><U+0438> <U+043F><U+043E> <U+0438><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0440><U+0438><U+043C><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0437><U+0435><U+043C><U+043B><U+0435><U+0432><U+043B><U+0430><U+0434><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F>, <U+043F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0438><U+043C><U+0443><U+0449><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+043E> <U+0432> <U+044D><U+043F><U+043E><U+0445><U+0443> <U+0418><U+043C><U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0438><U+0438>'' (''The Outlines on Roman Landownership History, Mainly During the Empire'') by [[Ivan Grevs]] contained information on the economy of [[Pomponius Atticus]], one of the greatest landowners during the end of the Republic.
