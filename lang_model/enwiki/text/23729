'''Tropical Storm Arthur''' caused minimal flooding in [[the Carolinas]] in mid-June&nbsp;1996. The first tropical cyclone and named storm of the annual Atlantic hurricane season, Arthur originated from an area of increased [[atmospheric convection|convection]] east of the [[Bahamas]] on June&nbsp;16. Gradually, the system increased in organization, and was designated as a tropical depression on June&nbsp;17. The depression tracked north-northwest and became Tropical Storm Arthur while just offshore the [[Southeastern United States]] on June&nbsp;19. Later that day, Arthur peaked with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h), but weakened slightly before making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in [[North Carolina]] early the following day. After striking North Carolina, Arthur tracked out to sea and weakened further to a tropical depression. By June&nbsp;21, Arthur transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]]. Overall, impact from Arthur was minimal, limited to light rainfall and moderate surf in North and [[South Carolina]], as well as a tornado in Florida. Total damage amounted to $1&nbsp;million (1996&nbsp;USD), but no fatalities were reported.<ref name="damage">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|title=Event report for Tropical Storm Arthur (2)|year=1996|publisher=|accessdate=November&nbsp;21, 2011|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~267566}}</ref>

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Arthur 1996 track.png}}
On June&nbsp;16, satellite imagery revealed an area of increased [[atmospheric convection|convection]] east of the [[Bahamas]], which was believed to have been associated with a [[tropical wave]].<ref name="mwr">{{cite web|author=Richard Pasch & Lixion Avila|title=Atlantic hurricane season of 1996|year=1996|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=May&nbsp;1998|accessdate=November&nbsp;21, 2011|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1996.pdf}}</ref> On June&nbsp;17, the convection increased in organization at the lower levels of the atmosphere. By 1800&nbsp;[[UTC]], the system had organized sufficiently to be designated as a tropical depression, making it the first of the season. Initially, the depression tracked north-northwest under the steering currents of the low-level flow around the western periphery of the Atlantic [[subtropical ridge]]. Strong [[wind shear]] due to fast upper-level winds associated with a [[cold-core low]] over the eastern Gulf of Mexico hindered further intensification for a time, but on June&nbsp;18, an area of deep convection developed north of the center of circulation. Based on analysis of reconnaissance data, the tropical depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arthur at 1900&nbsp;UTC on June&nbsp;19.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Max Mayfield|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Tropical Storm Arthur|date=August&nbsp;19, 1996|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=November&nbsp;21, 2011|url= http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1996arthur.html}}</ref>

Further strengthening occurred, as the storm attained peak winds of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="mwr"/> With time, Arthur gradually turned northeast and made landfall near [[Cape Lookout, North Carolina]] early on June&nbsp;20. The center moved over the [[Pamlico Sound]] and the Cape Hatteras National Seashore and exited into the Atlantic. Although the storm contained minimal deep convection, satellite imagery indicated that Arthur had a well-defined low-level center. The tropical storm weakened to a tropical depression about {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina|Cape Hatteras]], and accelerated towards the northeast when westerly steering currents increased. Deep convection increased once again on June&nbsp;21, although the lack of symmetry indicated that the remnants of Arthur were losing tropical characteristics. Forward speed increased to {{convert|40|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and the storm subsequently lost all tropical characteristics at 1200&nbsp;UTC on June&nbsp;21, while centered about {{convert|350|mi|km|abbr=on}} north-northeast of Bermuda. The [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] remnants tracked northeastward for 36&nbsp;hours, and were last identified about midway between [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and the [[Azores]], where it was absorbed by a much larger extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations and impact==
[[Image:TSArthur96NCRadar.png|200px|right|thumb|Radar imagery of Tropical Storm Arthur impacting North Carolina]]
On June&nbsp;18, a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Tropical Storm Warning|tropical storm warning]] was issued for coastal locations from [[Edisto Beach, South Carolina]] to [[Cape Lookout, North Carolina]]. Shortly thereafter, a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Tropical Storm Watch|tropical storm watch]] was issued north of Cape Lookout to the [[North Carolina]]/[[Virginia]] border, including Pamlico and [[Albemarle Sound]]s. The tropical storm watch was later extended from the North Carolina/Virginia border to [[Cape Charles, Virginia]], including [[Virginia Beach]]. By late on June&nbsp;19, all advisories were discontinued.<ref name="tcr"/>

One tornado touched down in Florida, causing no known fatalities or injuries.<ref>{{cite web|author=TornadoProject|title=List of Known Tropical Cyclones Which Have Spawned Tornadoes|year=|publisher=|accessdate=November&nbsp;21, 2011|url=http://www.tornadoproject.com/alltorns/allhurricanes.htm}}</ref> As the center of Arthur passed {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Cape Romain, South Carolina, minor increases in surf were reported. In North Carolina, swells ranged as high as 7&nbsp;ft (2.1&nbsp;m).<ref name="damage"/> Rainfall peaked at {{convert|5.85|in|mm}} in [[Georgetown, South Carolina]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/arthur1996rain.gif|title=Tropical Storm Arthur June 17-20, 1996|author=David Roth|authorlink=David M.

Sustained winds of {{convert|46|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} were reported, and offshore, the ''Atlantic Huron'' reported a sustained wind of {{convert|48|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at 1500&nbsp;UTC on June&nbsp;19, while located {{convert|35|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Arthur's center. In addition, a C-Man station located about {{convert|34.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Cape Fear (headland)|Cape Fear]], North Carolina reported sustained winds of 39&nbsp;mph (64&nbsp;km/h) and gusts up to 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="tcr"/> Overall, damage caused by Arthur was minimal, totaling only $1&nbsp;million (1996&nbsp;USD).<ref name="damage"/>
