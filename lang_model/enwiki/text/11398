'''Yvette of Huy''' , or simply '''Yvette''' ([[1158]]&ndash;[[13 January]] [[1228]]) was a venerated Christian prophetess and [[anchoress]]. Born in [[Huy]], [[Belgium]], she was also known as ''Ivetta, Jufta or Jutta of Huy''.

==Life==
She was born into a wealthy but not particularly religious family and from an early age tried to live a religious life from her home. Yvette was forced into an arranged marriage aged thirteen and had three children before she was widowed at eighteen. She used the opportunity to retire to a leper colony on the river [[Meuse]] to tend to the inmates, and more fully practise a religious life. 

She left her three sons in the care of their grandfather. Ten years later, she became an [[anchoress]] and was enclosed in a chapel cell near the colony in a ceremony conducted by the abbot of [[Orval]]. From there she offered guidance to pilgrims who considered her a prophetess in the apostolic sense of having insight into the divine. She summoned priests and even the dean of the local church to her presence and confronted them about their behavior. She was responsible for the conversion of her father and one of her two surviving sons. Yvette died on [[13 January]] [[1228]] in [[Huy]], [[Belgium]].

Her life was recorded by the [[Premonstratensian]] Hugh of Floreffe.
