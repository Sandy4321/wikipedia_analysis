'''L<U+00E9>opold S<U+00E9>dar Senghor''' (9 October 1906 <U+2013> 20 December 2001) was a [[Senegal]]ese [[poet]], politician, and cultural theorist who for two decades served as the first [[List of Presidents of Senegal|president]] of [[Senegal]] (1960&ndash;1980).  Senghor was the first African elected as a member of the ''[[Acad<U+00E9>mie fran<U+00E7>aise]]''. Before independence, he founded the political party called the [[Senegalese Democratic Bloc]]. He is regarded by many as one of the most important African intellectuals of the 20th century.

==Biography==
Senghor's first marriage was to Ginette Eboue.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|title=L<U+00E9>opold Senghor |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1365925/Leopold-Senghor.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2001-12-21 |accessdate=2012-04-06}}</ref> His second wife, Colette Hubert, who was from France, became Senegal's first [[First Lady]] upon independence in 1960.

==Early years: 1906<U+2013>28==
L<U+00E9>opold S<U+00E9>dar Senghor was born on 9 October 1906 in the city of [[Joal]], some one hundred ten kilometres south of [[Dakar]]. Basile Diogoye Senghor (pronounced: Basile Jogoy Senghor), Sedar Senghor's father, was a businessman belonging to the [[bourgeois]] [[Serer people|Serer tribe]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Bibliographie, Dakar, Bureau de documentation de la Pr<U+00E9>sidence de la R<U+00E9>publique, 1982 (2e <U+00E9>dition), 158 pp.</ref><ref>Robert O.

She gave birth to six children, including two sons.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> His Serer middle name ''S<U+00E9>dar'' comes from the [[Serer language]] meaning "one that shall not be humiliated" or "the one you cannot humiliate".<ref>Universite De La Vallee D'Aoste.

At the age of eight Senghor began his studies in Senegal in the [[Ngasobil]] boarding school of the Fathers of the Holy Spirit. In 1922 he entered a seminary in Dakar. After being told the religious life was not for him, he attended a secular institution. By then, he was already passionate about French literature. He won distinctions in French, Latin, Greek and Algebra. With his Baccalaureate completed, he was awarded a scholarship to continue his studies in France.<ref>Bryan Ryan.

=="Sixteen years of wandering": 1928<U+2013>1944==
In 1928 Senghor sailed from Senegal for France, beginning in his words, "sixteen years of wandering." <ref>Jonathan Peters.

ISBN 0-914478-23-0, ISBN 978-0-914478-23-2</ref> Starting his post-secondary studies at the [[Sorbonne]], he quit and went on to [[Lyc<U+00E9>e Louis-Le-Grand|Louis-Le-Grand]] to finish his prep course for entrance to the ''[[<U+00C9>cole Normale Sup<U+00E9>rieure]]'', a ''[[grande <U+00E9>cole]]''. [[Paul Carey (politician)|Paul Cary]], [[Henri Queff<U+00E9>lec]], [[Robert Verdier]] and [[Georges Pompidou]] were also studying at this elite institution. After failing the entrance exam, Senghor prepared for his grammar ''[[Agr<U+00E9>gation]]''. He was granted his ''agr<U+00E9>gation'' in 1935 after a failed first attempt.<ref>Janet G. Vaillant.

==Academic career==
He graduated from the [[University of Paris]], where he received the [[Agr<U+00E9>gation]] in French Grammar. Subsequently, he was designated [[professor]] at the universities of Tours and Paris, where he taught during the period 1935<U+2013>45.<ref>''The World Book Encyclopedia'', Vol. 17, World Book, 2000. ISBN 0-7166-0100-1, ISBN 978-0-7166-0100-5</ref>

Senghor decided to start his teaching years at the Lyc<U+00E9>e Ren<U+00E9>-Descartes in [[Tours]]; he also taught at the Lyc<U+00E9>e Marcelin Berthelot in [[Saint-Maur-des-Fosses]] near Paris.<ref>Jacques Girault, Lecherbonnier Bernard, Universit<U+00E9> Paris-Nord. Center for Comparative Literary Studies and French. ''Leopold Sedar Senghor: Africanity - universality: 29<U+2013>30 May 2000'', Harmattan, 2002. ISBN 2-7475-2676-3, ISBN 978-2-7475-2676-0</ref> He also studied linguistics taught by [[Lilias Homburger]] at the ''[[<U+00C9>cole pratique des hautes <U+00E9>tudes]]''. He studied with prominent social scientists such as [[Marcel Cohen]], [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Paul Rivet]] (director of the [[Institut d'ethnologie de Paris]]). Senghor, along with other intellectuals of the African diaspora who had come to study in the colonial capital, coined the term and conceived the notion of "[[n<U+00E9>gritude]]", which was a response to the racism still prevalent in France. It turned the racial slur ''n<U+00E8>gre'' into a positively connoted celebration of African culture and character. The idea of ''n<U+00E9>gritude'' informed not only Senghor's cultural criticism and literary work, but also became a guiding principle for his political thought in his career as a statesman.<ref>Michelle M. Wright. ''Becoming Black: creating identity in the African diaspora'', Duke University Press, 2004. 0822332884, 9780822332886</ref>

In 1939, Senghor was enrolled as a French army enlisted man (''2<U+00E8>me Classe'') with the rank of private within the 59th Colonial Infantry division in spite of his higher education and his later acquisition of the French Citizenship in 1932.  A year later in 1940, during the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]], he was taken prisoner by the Germans in [[la Charit<U+00E9>-sur-Loire]]. He was interned in different camps, and finally at Front Stalag 230, in [[Poitiers]]. Front Stalag 230 was reserved for colonial troops captured during the war. German soldiers wanted to execute him and the others the same day they were captured, but they escaped this fate by yelling ''Vive la France, vive l'Afrique noire!'' ("Long live France, long live Black Africa!") A French officer told the soldiers that executing the African prisoners would dishonour the [[Aryan race]] and the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]]. In total, Senghor spent two years in different prison camps, where he spent most of his time writing poems. In 1942 he was released for medical reasons.<ref name="Jamie Stokes 2009">Jamie Stokes. ''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East'', Vol. 1. Infobase Publishing, 2009. ISBN 0-8160-7158-6, ISBN 978-0-8160-7158-6</ref>

He resumed his teaching career while remaining involved in the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] during the Nazi occupation.

==Political career: 1945<U+2013>82==

===Colonial France===
Once the war was over, Senghor was selected as Dean of the Linguistics Department with the ''[[<U+00C9>cole Nationale de la France d'Outre-Mer]]'', a position he would hold until Senegal's independence in 1960.<ref>Selected Poems of Leopold Sedar Senghor. Published by: CUP Archive</ref>  While travelling on a research trip for his poetry, he met the local socialist leader, [[Lamine Gu<U+00E8>ye (politician)|Lamine Gu<U+00E8>ye]], who suggested that Senghor run for election as a member of the [[French National Assembly|Assembl<U+00E9>e nationale fran<U+00E7>aise]]. Senghor accepted and became ''d<U+00E9>put<U+00E9>'' for the riding of S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal-Mauritanie, when colonies were granted the right to be represented by elected individuals. They took different positions when the train conductors on the line Dakar-Niger went on strike.  Gu<U+00E8>ye voted against the strike, arguing the movement would paralyse the colony, while Senghor supported the workers, which gained him great support among Senegalese.<ref>Jacques Louis Hymans. ''L<U+00E9>opold S<U+00E9>dar Senghor: an intellectual biography'', Edinburgh University Press, 1971. 0852241194, 9780852241196</ref>

==Political changes==
In 1947, Senghor left the African Division of the [[French Section of the Workers International]] (SFIO), which had given enormous financial support to the social movement.  With [[Mamadou Dia]], he founded the ''[[Senegalese Democratic Bloc|Bloc d<U+00E9>mocratique s<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>galais]]'' (1948). They won the legislative elections of 1951, and Gu<U+00E8>ye lost his seat.<ref>Gwendolen Margaret Carter, Charles F. Gallagher. ''African One-Party States'', Cornell University Press, 1964</ref>

Re-elected deputy in 1951 as an independent overseas member, Senghor was appointed [[Secretary of State#France|state secretary]] to the Council's president in [[Edgar Faure]]'s government from 1 March 1955 to 1 February 1956. He became mayor of the city of [[Thi<U+00E8>s]], Senegal in November 1956 and then advisory minister in the [[Michel Debre]]'s government from 23 July 1959 to 19 May 1961. He was also a member of the commission responsible for drafting the [[Fifth French Republic|Fifth Republic]]'s constitution, general councillor for Senegal, member of the ''Grand Conseil de l'Afrique Occidentale Francaise'' and member for the parliamentary assembly of the [[European Council]].

In 1964 Senghor published the first volume of a series of five, titled ''Libert<U+00E9>''. The book contains a variety of speeches, essays and prefaces.<ref>Hugues Az<U+00E8>rad, Peter Collier, ''Twentieth-century French poetry: a critical anthology'', Cambridge University Press, 2010. ISBN 0-521-71398-6, ISBN 978-0-521-71398-6</ref>

===Senegal===
Senghor supported federalism for newly independent African states, a type of "French Commonwealth". Since federalism was not favoured by the African countries, he decided to form, along with [[Modibo Keita]], the [[Mali Federation]] with former [[French Sudan]] (present day [[Mali]]). Senghor was president of the Federal Assembly until its failure in 1960.<ref>Africa Bureau (London, England). Africa digest, Volume 8. Africa Publications Trust, 1960</ref>

Afterwards, Senghor became the first President of the Republic of Senegal, elected on 5 September 1960. He is the author of the Senegalese [[Pincez Tous vos Koras, Frappez les Balafons|national anthem]]. The prime minister, [[Mamadou Dia]], was in charge of executing Senegal's long-term development plan, while Senghor was in charge of foreign relations. The two men quickly disagreed. In December 1962, Mamadou Dia was arrested under suspicion of fomenting a ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]''. He was held in prison for twelve years. Following this, Senghor created a presidential regime.<ref>Christof Heyns. ''Human Rights Law in Africa 1998'', Vol. 3 of Human Rights Law in Africa. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2001. ISBN 90-411-1578-1, ISBN 978-90-411-1578-2</ref>

On 22 March 1967, Senghor survived an assassination attempt.<ref>Sheldon Gellar. ''Senegal: an African nation between Islam and the West'', Westview Press, 1995. 0813310202, 9780813310206</ref> The suspect, [[Moustapha L<U+00F4>]], pointed his pistol towards the President after he had participated in the sermon of [[Tabaski]], but the gun [[Firearm malfunction|did not fire]]. L<U+00F4> was sentenced to death for [[treason]] and [[Capital punishment|executed]] on 15 June 1967, even though it remained unclear if he had actually wanted to kill Senghor.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.loffice.sn/Retour-sur-la-tentative-d.html | title = Retour sur la tentative d<U+2019>assassinat de Senghor et le meurtre de Demba Diop en 1967&nbsp;: Quand la peine de mort <U+00E9>tait encore une r<U+00E9>alit<U+00E9> au S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal | first = Abdoulaye | last = Mbow | work = L'OFFice | language = French | date = {{date|2011-04-30}} | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-28}} }}</ref>

Following an announcement at the beginning of December 1980,<ref>"President Leopold Senghor to Retire".  ''Liberian Inaugural'' 1980-12-03: 8.</ref> Senghor resigned his position at the end of the year, before the end of his fifth term. [[Abdou Diouf]] replaced him as the head of the country. Under his presidency, Senegal adopted a multi-party system (limited to three: [[Socialist Party of Senegal|socialist]], [[Party of Independence and Labour|communist]] and [[Senegalese Democratic Party|liberal]]).<ref>Stephan Haggard, Steven Benjamin Webb, World Bank.

ISBN 0-19-520987-7, ISBN 978-0-19-520987-7</ref>  He created a performing education system. Despite the end of official colonialism, the value of Senegalese currency continued to be fixed by France, the language of learning remained French, and Senghor ruled the country with French political advisors.

===Francophonie===
He supported the creation of [[la Francophonie]] and was elected vice-president of the High Council of the Francophonie.

In 1982, he was one of the founders of the Association France and developing countries whose objectives were to bring attention to the problems of developing countries, in the wake of the changes affecting the latter.<ref>Hakim Adi, Marika Sherwood, ''Pan-African History: Political Figures from Africa and the Diaspora Since 1787'', Routledge, 2003. ISBN 0-203-41780-1, ISBN 978-0-203-41780-5</ref>

==Acad<U+00E9>mie fran<U+00E7>aise: 1983-2001==
He was elected a member of l'[[Acad<U+00E9>mie fran<U+00E7>aise]] on 2 June 1983, at the [[List of members of the Acad<U+00E9>mie fran<U+00E7>aise#Seat 16|16th seat]] where he succeeded [[Antoine de L<U+00E9>vis Mirepoix]]. He was the first African to sit at the Acad<U+00E9>mie.<ref name="Jamie Stokes 2009"/> The entrance ceremony in his honor took place on 29 March 1984, in presence of then-French President [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Mitterrand]]. This was considered as a further step towards greater openness in the Acad<U+00E9>mie, after the previous election of a woman, [[Marguerite Yourcenar]].

In 1993, the last and fifth book of the ''Libert<U+00E9>'' series was published: ''Libert<U+00E9> 5: le dialogue des cultures.''

==Death==
[[File:Stamp of Moldova md068cvs.jpg|thumb|right|2006 Memorial stamp from [[Moldova]]]]
He spent the last years of his life with his wife in [[Verson]], near the city of [[Caen]] in [[Normandy]], where he died on 20 December 2001. His funeral was held on 29 December 2001 in [[Dakar]]. Officials attending the ceremony included [[Raymond Forni]], president of the [[French National Assembly|Assembl<U+00E9>e nationale]] and [[Charles Josselin]], state secretary for the minister of foreign affairs, in charge of the Francophonie. [[Jacques Chirac]] (who said, upon hearing of Senghor's death: "Poetry has lost one of its masters, Senegal a statesman, Africa a visionary and France a friend"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1725044.stm|title=Africa mourns Senegal's Senghor|date=2001-12-22|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>) and [[Lionel Jospin]], respectively [[president of the French Republic]] and the [[French prime minister|prime minister]], did not attend. Their failure to attend Senghor's funeral made waves as it was deemed a lack of acknowledgement for what the politician had been in his life. The analogy was made with the [[Senegalese Tirailleurs]] who, after having contributed to the liberation of France, had to wait more than forty years to receive an equal pension (in terms of buying power) to their French counterparts. The scholar [[Erik Orsenna]] wrote in the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' an editorial entitled "J'ai honte" (I am ashamed).<ref>[http://www.sangonet.com/FichPtsdevuesuite/HonteEOlss.html "''J'ai honte''"]</ref>

==Legacy==
Although a [[socialism|socialist]], Senghor avoided the [[Marxist]] and anti-Western ideology that had become popular in post-colonial Africa, favouring the maintenance of close ties with France and the western world. This is seen by many as a contributing factor to Senegal's political stability: it remains one of the few African nations never to have had a coup, and always to have had a peaceful transfer of power.

Senghor's tenure as president was characterized by the development of [[African socialism]], which was created as an indigenous alternative to [[Marxism]], drawing heavily from the ''n<U+00E9>gritude'' philosophy. In developing this, he was assisted by [[Ousmane Tanor Dieng]]. On 31 December 1980, he retired in favour of his prime minister, [[Abdou Diouf]].

Seat number 16 of the Acad<U+00E9>mie was vacant after the Senegalese poet's death. He was ultimately replaced by another former president, [[Val<U+00E9>ry Giscard d'Estaing]].

==Honors==
Senghor received several honours in the course of his life. He was made Grand-Croix of the [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]], Grand-Croix of the l'[[Ordre national du M<U+00E9>rite]], commander of arts and letters. He also received academic palms and the Grand-Croix of the l'Ordre du lion du S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal. His war exploits earned him the medal of Reconnaissance Franco-alli<U+00E9>e 1939<U+2013>1945 and the combattant cross 1939<U+2013>1945. He was named honorary doctor of thirty-seven universities.

Senghor received the Commemorative Medal of the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire|2500th Anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire]] on 14 October 1971.<ref>[http://badraie.com/guests.htm Badraie]</ref>

On 13 November 1978, he received the Collar of the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]] of Spain.<ref>[http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1978/11/22/pdfs/A26529-26529.pdf Bolet<U+00ED>n Oficial del Estado]</ref>

In 1983 he was awarded the [[Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize]] by the [[University of T<U+00FC>bingen]]."<ref>[[Peter L. Berger]], ''Dialog zwischen religiosen Traditionen in einem Zeitalter der Relativitat'', Mohr-Siebeck, 2011. ISBN 978-3-16-150792-2</ref>

The French Language International University in Alexandria was officially open in 1990 and was named after him.

In 1994 he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the [[African Studies Association]]; however, there was controversy about whether he met the standard of contributing "a lifetime record of outstanding scholarship in African studies and service to the Africanist community."<ref>[http://www.africanstudies.org/?page=awards_distinguished "Distinguished Africanist Award 2009" African Studies Association]</ref> [[Michael Mbabuike]], president of the New York African Studies Association (NYASA), said that the award also honors those who have worked "to make the world a better place for mankind."<ref>Bensaid, Alexandra and Whitehead, Andrew (1995) "Literature: Award to Senghor Triggers Debate" IPS-Inter Press Service, 18 April 1995, accessed via the commercial service Lexis/Nexis, 30 December 2008.</ref>

The airport of [[Dakar]] was renamed ''[[L<U+00E9>opold S<U+00E9>dar Senghor International Airport|A<U+00E9>roport International L<U+00E9>opold S<U+00E9>dar Senghor]]'' in 1996, on his 90th birthday.<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.aeroportdakar.com/ A<U+00E9>roport International L<U+00E9>opold S<U+00E9>dar Senghor], official website</ref>

The [[Passerelle Solf<U+00E9>rino]] in [[Paris]] was renamed after him in 2006, on the centenary of his birth.

==Poetry==
[[File:Senghor Universita degli Studi di Genova (Jan. 18 1988).jpg|thumb|Senghor signing a copy of his ''Po<U+00E8>mes'', [[Universita degli Studi di Genova]] (Jan. 18, 1988).]]
His poetry was widely acclaimed, and in 1978 he was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]].
His poem "A l'appel de la race de Saba", published in 1936, was inspired by the entry of Italian troops in Addis Ababa.
In 1948, Senghor compiled and edited a volume of Francophone poetry called ''Anthologie de la nouvelle po<U+00E9>sie n<U+00E8>gre et malgache'' for which [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] wrote an introduction, entitled "Orph<U+00E9>e Noir" (Black Orpheus).

For his epitaph was a poem he had written, namely:

:''Quand je serai mort, mes amis, couchez-moi sous Joal-l'Ombreuse.''
:''Sur la colline au bord du Mamanguedy, pr<U+00E8>s l'oreille du sanctuaire des Serpents.''
:''Mais entre le Lion couchez-moi et l'a<U+00EF>eule Tening-Ndyae.''
:''Quand je serai mort mes amis, couchez-moi sous Joal-la-Portugaise.''
:''Des pierres du Fort vous ferez ma tombe, et les canons garderont le silence.''
:''Deux lauriers roses-blanc et rose-embaumeront la Signare.''

:''When I'm dead, my friends, place me below Shadowy Joal,''
:''On the hill, by the bank of the Mamanguedy, near the ear of Serpents' Sanctuary.''
:''But place me between the Lion and ancestral Tening-Ndyae.''
:''When I'm dead, my friends, place me beneath Portuguese Joal.''
:''Of stones from the Fort build my tomb, and cannons will keep quiet.''
:''Two oleanders -- white and pink -- will perfume the Signare.''

==N<U+00E9>gritude==
With [[Aim<U+00E9> C<U+00E9>saire]] and [[L<U+00E9>on Damas]], Senghor created the concept of ''[[N<U+00E9>gritude]]'', an important intellectual movement that sought to assert and to valorize what they believed to be distinctive African characteristics, values, and aesthetics. This was a reaction against the too strong dominance of French culture in the colonies, and against the perception that Africa did not have culture developed enough to stand alongside that of Europe. Building upon historical research identifying ancient Egypt with black Africa, Senghor argued that sub-Saharan Africa and Europe are in fact part of the same cultural continuum, reaching from Egypt to classical Greece, through Rome to the European colonial powers of the modern age. [[N<U+00E9>gritude]] was by no means<U+2014>as it has in many quarters been perceived<U+2014>an anti-white racism, but rather emphasized the importance of dialogue and exchange among different cultures (e.g., European, African, Arab, etc.).

A related concept later developed in [[Mobutu]]'s [[Zaire]] is that of ''[[Authenticit<U+00E9> (Zaire)|authenticit<U+00E9>]]'' or Authenticity.
