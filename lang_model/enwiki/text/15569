'''Neural Darwinism''', a large scale theory of brain function by [[Gerald Edelman]], was initially published in 1978, in a book called ''The Mindful Brain'' (MIT Press). It was extended and published in the 1989 book ''Neural Darwinism - The Theory of Neuronal Group Selection''.

Edelman won the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1972 for his work in immunology showing how the population of [[lymphocyte]]s capable of binding to a foreign antigen is increased by differential clonal multiplication following [[antigen]] discovery.  Essentially, this proved that the human body is capable of creating [[complex systems|complex adaptive systems]] as a result of local events with feedback.  Edelman<U+2019>s interest in selective systems expanded into the fields of [[neurobiology]] and [[neurophysiology]], and in ''Neural Darwinism'', Edelman puts forth a theory called "neuronal group selection".  It contains three major parts:

# Anatomical connectivity in the brain occurs via selective mechanochemical events that take place [[epigenetic|epigenetically]] during development.  This creates a diverse '''primary repertoire''' by differential reproduction.
# Once structural diversity is established anatomically, a second selective process occurs during [[postnatal]] behavioral experience through epigenetic modifications in the strength of [[synapse|synaptic]] connections between neuronal groups.  This creates a diverse '''secondary repertoire''' by differential amplification.
# Reentrant signaling between neuronal groups allows for spatiotemporal continuity in response to real-world interactions.

== Degeneracy == 

With neuronal heterogeneity (called degeneracy), it is possible to test the many circuits (on the order of 30 billion neurons with an estimated one million billion connections between them in the human brain) with a diverse set of inputs, to see which neuronal groups respond "appropriately" statistically. Functional "distributed" (widespread) brain circuits thus emerge as a result.

Edelman goes into some detail about how brain development depends on a variety of [[cell adhesion molecules]] (CAMs) and [[substrate adhesion molecules]] (SAMs) on cell surfaces which allow cells to dynamically control their intercellular binding properties.  This surface modulation allows cell collectives to effectively "signal" as the group aggregates, which helps govern [[morphogenesis]].  So morphology depends on CAM and SAM function.  And CAM and SAM function also depend on developing morphology. 

Edelman theorized that cell proliferation, cell migration, cell death, neuron arbor distribution, and [[neurite]] branching are also governed by similar selective processes.

== Synaptic modification == 

Once the basic variegated anatomical structure of the brain is laid down during early development, it is more or less fixed.  But given the numerous and diverse collection of available circuitry, there are bound to be functionally equivalent albeit anatomically non-[[isomorphic]] neuronal groups capable of responding to certain sensory input. This creates a competitive environment where circuit groups proficient in their responses to certain inputs are "chosen" through the enhancement of the synaptic [[efficacy|efficacies]] of the selected network.  This leads to an increased probability that the same network will respond to similar or identical signals at a future time.  This occurs through the strengthening of neuron-to-neuron synapses. And these adjustments allow for neural [[plasticity]] along a fairly quick timetable.

== Reentry ==

The last part of the theory attempts to explain how we experience spatiotemporal consistency in our interaction with environmental stimuli.  Edelman proposes a model of reentrant signaling whereby a disjunctive, multimodal sampling of the same stimulus event correlated in time leads to self-organizing intelligence.  Put another way, multiple neuronal groups can be used to sample a given stimulus set in parallel and communicate between these disjunctive groups with incurred [[latency]].

== Support for the theory ==

It has been suggested that [[Friedrich Hayek]] had earlier proposed a similar idea in his book ''The Sensory Order: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Theoretical Psychology'', published in 1952.

Other leading proponents include [[Daniel Dennett]], [[William H. Calvin]], and [[Linda B. Smith]].
