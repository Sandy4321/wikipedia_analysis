'''Deception Island''' is an [[island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]] off the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] which has one of the safest harbours in [[Antarctica]]. A recently active [[volcano]], its eruptions in 1967 and 1969 caused serious damage to the scientific stations there. The only current research bases are run by the [[Argentine Army]] and [[Spain]]. 

==Geography==

The island, located at {{coor dm|62|57|S|60|36|W|}}, is approximately circular with a diameter of about 12 km (7 mi). Its highest point, '''Mt Pond''', has an elevation of 542 m (1778 ft), and over half the island is covered by glaciers. The centre of the island is a [[caldera]] which has been flooded by the sea to form a large bay named '''Port Foster''', about 9 km (5.5 mi) long and 6 km (3.6 mi) wide. The bay has a narrow entrance, just 230 m (754 ft) wide, called '''Neptune's Bellows'''. Adding to the hazard is '''Ravn Rock''', which lies 2.5 m (8 ft) below the water in the middle of the channel. Just inside Neptune's Bellows lies the cove '''Whalers' Bay''', which is bordered by a large black sand [[beach]].

Several [[maar]]s line the inside rim of the caldera, with some containing [[crater lake]]s (including one named Crater Lake). Others form bays within the harbour, such as the 1 kilometre wide Whalers Bay.

==History==

Since the early 19th century Deception Island was a favourite refuge from the storms and [[iceberg]]s of Antarctica.  It was first used by [[sealer]]s, then in 1906 a [[Norway|Norwegian]]-[[Chile]]an [[whaling]] company started using Whalers' Bay as a base for a [[factory ship]], the ''Gobernador Bories''.  Other whaling operations followed suit, and by 1914 there were 13 factory ships based there.

The station did not actually process whale [[blubber]], that being done on the ships, but instead took the carcasses and boiled them down to extract additional [[whale oil]], using large iron [[boiler]]s, and storing the results in iron tanks.

Whale oil prices dropped in the [[Great Depression]], making the station uneconomic, and it was abandoned in 1931.  Advances in factory ships made shore stations for carcass processing unnecessary, and so it was never reoccupied.  45 men were buried in the station's cemetery, but the cemetery was buried in a 1969 eruption, and the only remaining signs are the rusting boilers and tanks.

Other remains at Whalers' Bay include an [[aircraft]] [[hangar]] with a bright orange derelict airplane [[fuselage]] outside (removed in 2004 [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/Living_and_Working/Diaries/RRS_Ernest_Shackleton/antarctic2003_2004/27/] ), and the British scientific station house (Biscoe House), with the middle torn out by the mudflows in 1969.

In the 1940s and 1950s, [[Argentina]] contested control of Deception Island with the [[United Kingdom|UK]] with some removals of the sovereign flag and temporary occupation of the island.

On [[February 3]], [[1944]] the British established a permanent base on Deception Island as part of [[Operation Tabarin]], and occupied it until [[December 5]], [[1967]], when a [[Volcano|volcanic]] eruption forced a temporary withdrawal.  It was used again between [[December 4]], [[1968]] and [[February 23]], [[1969]], when further volcanic activity caused it to be abandoned.

In 1955 Chile inaugurated its station [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]] at Pendulum Cove, to increase the Chilean presence in the sector claimed by that nation.

In 1961 Argentina's president [[Arturo Frondizi]] visited to show his country's interest.

In 1969 a violent volcanic eruption demolished the Chilean stations Pedro Aguirre Cerda and [[Gutierrez Vargas]].

The volcano has mostly taken care of other attempts to maintain permanent facilities, and as of 2000, there were only two scientific stations still in use, both summer-only:  Spain has '''Gabriel de Castilla'''[http://www.newzeal.com/theme/bases/Spain/gabrieldecastilla.htm], and Argentina its '''Decepci<U+00F3>n''' station[http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/Living_and_Working/Diaries/RRS_Ernest_Shackleton/antarctic2003_2004/27/decepcion_bec.jpg].

==Ecology==
[[Image:Penguins on deception island 1962.jpg|thumb|250px|<small>Penguins on Deception Island. January 1962.</small>]]
Deception Island has several colonies of [[chinstrap penguin]]s, and it is possible to make a warm bath by digging into the sands of the beach, so it has become a popular tourist stop in Antarctica.  Baily Head on the west side of the island holds one of the world's largest chinstrap rookeries.

After the Norwegian Coastal Cruise Liner M/S Nordkapp ran aground off the coast of Deception Island on January 30th, 2007, fuel from the ship washed into a bay.  Ecological damage has not yet been determined.  On February 4 2007 the Spanish Gabriel de Castilla research station on Deception Island reported that water and sand tests were clean and that they had not found signs of the oil, estimated as 500-750 litres of light diesel.

==Micro climates==
Deception Island exhibits some wildly varying micro climates. Some water temperatures reach 70<U+00B0>C (158<U+00B0>F). Near volcanic areas, the air can be as hot as 40<U+00B0>C (103<U+00B0>F).
