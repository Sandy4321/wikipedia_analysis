'''''Elliot Minor''''' is the debut album from the English pop rock band [[Elliot Minor]]. The album was released on April 14, 2008.

==History==
The band has released 4 singles before this album's release, "[[Parallel Worlds]]", "[[Jessica (Elliot Minor song)|Jessica]]", "[[The White One Is Evil]]" and "[[Still Figuring Out]]", with "[[Parallel Worlds]]" being re-released a week before the album, on April 7.

The album release date had been pushed back many times throughout the course of 2007, however lead singer/guitarist Alex Davies confirmed on a BBC Radio 1 interview that the album would be released on the 21st April 2008. This has since been revised, and the album was released on April 14.

Several promotion copies were leaked onto [[eBay]], however were swiftly removed. Demos for all of the tracks have been available for sometime on various torrent websites, and several have also been available on the band's MySpace. The track listing has been confirmed by a number of sources since the promotion copy leaked onto eBay.<ref>[http://www.hmv.co.uk/hmvweb/displayProductDetails.do?ctx=220;1;55;-1&sku=736752 Elliot Minor (self titled)(2008)] [[HMV]] track listing and details on Elliot Minors debut album. - ''Retrieved'' - March 30, 2008</ref>
