'''Old Nubian''' is the name given to the written language used in medieval [[Nubia]] from the [[8th century|8th]] to the [[15th century]] AD.  It is an ancient variety of the [[Nubian languages]], which is still spoken in the area; in particular, it is probably ancestral to the modern-day [[Nobiin language|Nobiin]] variety.  It is preserved in at least a hundred pages of documents, mostly of a [[Christianity|Christian]] religious nature, written using a modified form of the [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]]) script; the best known is ''The Martyrdom of [[Saint Menas]]''.  It is the oldest written sub-Saharan [[African language]] apart from [[Meroitic language|Meroitic]] and [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]].

==Writing==

Old Nubian is written with an [[uncial]] variety of the [[Greek alphabet]], extended with three [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] letters &mdash; {{Unicode|<U+03E3>}} "sh", {{Unicode|<U+03E9>}} "h", and {{Unicode|<U+03ED>}} "j" &mdash; and three unique to Nubian: {{unicode|<U+2CE1>}} "ny" and {{unicode|<U+2CE3>}} "w", apparently derived from [[Meroitic script|Meroitic]]; and {{unicode|<U+2CDF>}} "ng", thought to be a [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of two Greek [[gamma]]s.  Each letter could have a line drawn above it, when it was:
* a [[vowel]] which formed a syllable by itself, or was preceded by one of l, n, r, or j;
* a [[consonant]] with an i (sometimes unwritten) preceding it.

The sound /i/ could be written <U+03B5>, {{Unicode|&nbsp;<U+0304>}} <U+03B5><U+03B9>, <U+03B7>;, <U+03B9>, or <U+03C5>; /u/ was normally written <U+03BF><U+03C5>.  In diphthongs, a [[dieresis]] was sometimes used over <U+03B9> to indicate the [[semivowel]] y.

[[Geminate]] consonants were written double; long vowels were usually not distinguished from short ones.  Tones were not marked.

Punctuation marks included a high dot <U+2022>, sometimes substituted by a double backslash \\, used roughly like an English [[Full stop|period]] or [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], a slash / used like a [[question mark]], and a double slash // sometimes used to separate verses.

==Grammar==
===Noun===
Old Nubian has no [[gender]], nor any [[Article (grammar)|article]]s.  The [[noun]] consists of a stem to which [[grammatical case]] [[suffix]]es and [[postposition]]s are added; the main ones are:
* ''-l'' [[nominative]], marking the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]: eg ''diabolos-il'' "the devil (subj.)"; ''iskit-l'' "the earth (subj.)".
* ''-n(a)'' [[genitive]], marking the possessor: eg ''iart-na palkit-la'' "into the sea of thoughts".
* ''-k(a)'' "directive", marking the [[direct object|direct]] or [[indirect object]]: eg ''Mikhaili-ka'' "Michael (obj.), to Michael"
* ''-lo'' [[locative]], meaning "at"
* ''-la'' [[inessive]], meaning "in(to)"
* ''-do'', meaning "on"
* ''-dal'' meaning "with"

The most common plural is in ''-gu-''; eg ''uru-gu-na'' "of kings", or ''gindette-gu-ka'' "thorns ([[object (grammar)|object]])", becoming ''-agui-'' in the predicative.  Rarer plurals include ''-rigu-'' (eg ''mug-rigu-ka'' "dogs (obj.)" (predicative ''-regui-'') and ''-pigu-''.

===Pronoun===

The basic [[pronoun]]s are:
* ''ai-'' "I"
* ''ir-'' "you (singular)"
* ''tar-'' "he, she, it"
* ''er-'' "we (including you)"
* ''u-'' "we (excluding you)"
* ''ur-'' "you (plural)"
* ''ter-'' "they"

Demonstratives include ''in-'' "this", ''man-'' "that"; interrogatives include ''ngai-'' "who?", ''min-'' "what?", ''islo'' "where?", ''iskal'' "how?".

===Verb===

The [[verb]] has five main forms: [[present tense|present]], two different [[preterite]]s, [[future tense|future]], and [[imperative]].  For each of these, there are [[subjunctive]] and [[indicative]] forms.  It conjugates according to person, eg for ''doll-'' "wish" in the present tense:

* ''dollire'' "I wish"
* ''dollina'' "you (singular) wish", "he, she, it wishes"
* ''dolliro'' "we wish", "you (plural) wish"
* ''dollirana'' "they wish"
