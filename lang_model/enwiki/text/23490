The '''Hood River Bridge''' is a [[truss bridge]] with a [[Lift bridge|vertical lift]] that spans the [[Columbia River]] between [[Hood River, Oregon]] and [[White Salmon, Washington]].   

The bridge is currently the second oldest road bridge across the Columbia between Washington and Oregon.  It was built by the Oregon-Washington Bridge Company and opened on December 9, 1924.  The original name was the Waucoma Interstate Bridge.

Construction of the [[Bonneville Dam]] {{convert|23|mi|km}} downstream forced the bridge to be altered in 1938 to accommodate the resulting elevated river levels.  On December 12, 1950 the Port of Hood River purchased the bridge from the Oregon-Washington Bridge Co. for $800,000.

The bridge is operated as a [[toll bridge]] by the Port of Hood River.  Currently the tolls are set to $1.00 per [[axle]] for vehicles, and $0.50 for motorcycles.  Bicycles and pedestrians are prohibited from crossing the bridge.

20 piers are used to support the total length of 4,418&nbsp;ft (1347 m).  When closed the vertical waterway clearance is 67&nbsp;ft (20m).  This increases to 148&nbsp;ft (45 m) when the bridge is open, which typically happens once or twice a month.  The horizontal waterway clearance of the lift span is 246&nbsp;ft (75 m).

It is located at [[river mile]] 169, between [[Bridge of the Gods (modern structure)|Bridge of the Gods]] at RM 148 and [[The Dalles Bridge]] at RM 191.
