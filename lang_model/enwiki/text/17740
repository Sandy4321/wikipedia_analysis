'''Eva Sophie Piper''' (30 March 1757 - 2 February 1816, [[Schloss L<U+00F6>fstad<U+200E>|L<U+00F6>fstad Slott]]), n<U+00E9>e '''Sophie von Fersen''', was a Swedish noble and [[lady in waiting]]. She was the daughter of [[Axel von Fersen the Elder]] and [[Hedvig Catharina De la Gardie]] and the sister of [[Axel von Fersen the Younger]] and [[Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen]]. She is foremost known for her close friendship with [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Queen Hedvig Elizabeth Charlotte]], who dedicated her famous diary to her. 

==Life==
Sophie von Fersen accompanied her mother in the Swedish entourage selected to greet [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Hedvig Elizabeth Charlotte]] upon her arrival in Sweden in 1774, were the two of them became very close and intimate friends. 

Known as one of the beauties of the court of [[Gustav III of Sweden]], Sophie was proposed to by [[Prince Frederick Adolf of Sweden|duke Frederik Adolf]], the king's youngest brother and third in line to the throne, in 1774. The Prince had earlier (1770) proposed to her cousin, [[Ulla von H<U+00F6>pken|Ulrika von Fersen]], but had been declined. Her father forbade the marriage, since he had no wish to bind his family to the royal family. Both Sophie and her father feared that she would have been humiliated by the King and the Queen Dowager, who both disliked the match<ref>

An attempt to elope was prevented by Princess [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Hedvig Elizabeth Charlotte]]. In 1777 she married [[chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] Adolf Ludwig Piper (1750<U+2013>1795). 

According to the historian and gossip-specialist [[Crusenstolpe]], Sophie disliked also Frederik Adolf, whose mental faculties were restricted. This is, however, contradicted by contemporary descriptions made by her father and Princess Hedvig Elizabeth Charlotte. After Prince Frederick Adolf had proposed to Sophie, she informed the Princess, who welcomed her as a sister-in-law because of their friendship but advised her to inform her father. When Frederick Adolf presented his proposal to her father in January 1774, her father declined with the motivation that it was not a suitable match and that although honored, he must decline for the sake of loyalty to the royal house. <ref>Alma S<U+00F6>derhjelm (1945). ''Gustav III:s syskon'' (The siblings of Gustav III) Stockholm: Albert Bonniers F<U+00F6>rlag. 23033 (Swedish)</ref> Sophie was by that time already promised to Count Piper, because he was rich and the families were friends. Frederick Adolf was not met with open opposition by his family, but his mother the Queen dowager and brother the King was in fact opposed to it. Fredrick Adolf was sent away, and the King and the Queen dowager proposed that Sophie be lady in waiting. Her father stated in his papers that the reason for this suggestion was to "abuse the youth and lack of experience of my daughter and, if they could, make her the official mistress of the Duke", and he therefore declined.<ref>Alma S<U+00F6>derhjelm (1945). ''Gustav III:s syskon'' (The siblings of Gustav III) Stockholm: Albert Bonniers F<U+00F6>rlag. 23033 (Swedish)</ref>  When Frederick Adolf continued to be in love with Sophie von Fersen after two years had passed, he and his brother Charles proposed to Sophie von Fersen that they would abduct her from a ball of Princess Hedvig Elizabeth Charlotte to Prince Frederick's residence Tullgarn Palace, where a priest would be waiting to perform the ceremony before it could be prevented.<ref>Alma S<U+00F6>derhjelm (1945). ''Gustav III:s syskon'' (The siblings of Gustav III) Stockholm: Albert Bonniers F<U+00F6>rlag. 23033 (Swedish)</ref>  Sophie declined the offer after having consulted Princess Hedvig Elizabeth Charlotte, mostly, as it seemed, out of pride. She told Frederick Adolf her decision at a masquerade ball in the presence Princess Hedvig Elizabeth Charlotte. When Frederick Adolf tried to convince her to change her mind, she was almost ready to do so, but asked Princess Hedvig Elizabeth Charlotte to take her to another room, so that her feelings would not persuade her to accept. <ref>Alma S<U+00F6>derhjelm (1945). ''Gustav III:s syskon'' (The siblings of Gustav III) Stockholm: Albert Bonniers F<U+00F6>rlag. 23033 (Swedish)</ref> After this, she accepted that her official engagement with Count Piper be proclaimed. After her marriage, Frederick Adolf left for Italy. 

From about 1790, she was involved in a long term relationship with Baron Evert Wilhelm Taube af Odenkat, cousin of [[Hedvig Taube]]. This affair took place in parallel with the affair of her friend Princess Hedvig Elizabeth Charlottes and her younger brother Fabian von Fersen, and the two women gave each other messages in their letters referring to "F." and "T."<ref>Alma S<U+00F6>derhjelm (1945). ''Gustav III:s syskon'' (The siblings of Gustav III) Stockholm: Albert Bonniers F<U+00F6>rlag. 23033 (Swedish)</ref>    

In 1786 Sophie became ''[[hofmeisterin|hovm<U+00E4>starinna]]'' to the royal duchess and later Queen [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Hedwig von Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorf]], known in Sweden as Hedvig Elisabet Charlotta. She was the duchess's closest friend, and the historically-interesting diary of the duchess, which were written in form of a correspondence between them, survives. The duchess called Sophie the only true friend she had ever owned, and in 1816, she wrote a biography of Sophie Piper.

Sophie was also the closest confidante of her brother Axel, known as a favourite and possible lover of [[Marie Antoinette]] - for reasons of caution the letters between Axel and Sophie make numerous references to that relationship, but out of caution Marie is never referred to by name but always as "She" or "Josephine" ; the Swedish historian [[Alma S<U+00F6>derhjelm]] has demonstrated that these are aliases for Marie Antoinette.

After she was widowed in 1795, she followed her lover Evert Willhelm Taube to Germany in 1798: after his death in [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]] in 1799, she returned to Sweden, where she took the responsibility of her brother Axel's household in 1801.

After the deposition of [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]] in 1809, the Fersen siblings were known supporters of the Gustavian party, who wished for the son of the deposed monarch to be acknowledged as heir to the throne. Instead, [[Carl August of Sweden|Carl August, prince of Augustenburg]], was chosen Like her brother Axel, Sophie fell under false and unfounded suspicion of involvement in crown prince [[Carl August of Sweden|Karl August]]'s death in 1810. Both Sophie and Axel were rumored to have poisoned August. Axel was killed in the street on 20 June 1810 by an angry mob while escorting the funeral possession of Carl August. This became known as the Fersen murder. Sophie was also subjected to persecution at this occasion, but she managed to escape. She was warned that she would be forced to share his fate, and she therefore left Stockholm the same night disguised as a maid and sought refuge at [[Rydboholm Castle]]. The day after, she was given permission by the king to be placed in safe custody at [[Vaxholm Castle]]. She demanded a court to investigate her involvement in the death of the crown prince. She remained at Vaxholm until November, when she was cleared from all charges. During the investigation, she received several proposals of marriage, one from Georg Carl von D<U+00F6>beln: she did not accept, but it led to a correspondence between them. Sophie was described as a charming beauty but was also feared for her ambition and sharp tongue.

She lived out her final years retired to [[Schloss L<U+00F6>fstad|L<U+00F6>fstad Slott<U+200E>]] near [[Norrk<U+00F6>ping]].
