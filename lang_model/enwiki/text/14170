'''Sharon Newman''' ([[Name at birth|n<U+00E9>e]] '''Collins'''; formerly '''Abbott''') is a fictional character from the American [[CBS Daytime]] soap opera ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', portrayed by [[Sharon Case]]. Created by [[William J. Bell]] as a [[love interest]] for [[Nicholas Newman]] ([[Joshua Morrow]]), the character made her onscreen debut on March 24, 1994. Before Case permanently took over the role, Sharon was briefly portrayed by [[Monica Potter]] and [[Heidi Mark]], who each played the role for two months. When first introduced, the character was described as a "young girl from the poor side of town". Nick and Sharon were quickly married and had a son, [[Noah Newman|Noah]] ([[Robert Adamson (actor)|Robert Adamson]]), and they later gained custody of [[Cassie Newman|Cassie]] ([[Camryn Grimes]]); the baby Sharon had as a teenager, who she gave up for adoption. The marriage faced countless problems, including infidelities on both sides. Following Cassie's death as a result of a car crash, Nick cheated on Sharon with [[Phyllis Summers]] ([[Michelle Stafford]]), resulting in a pregnancy that ultimately ended Nick and Sharon's 11-year marriage. 

Despite her marriage and subsequent divorce to [[Jack Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|Jack Abbott]] ([[Peter Bergman]]), Nick and Sharon had an affair and conceived a third child, [[Faith Newman]] (Alyvia Alyn Lind). During her pregnancy, Sharon experienced [[kleptomania]]. Faith was kidnapped by [[Adam Newman]] ([[Michael Muhney]]), Nick's brother, leaving Sharon to believe she had died. Sharon then began a relationship with Adam, which led to a brief marriage. Even when Adam's actions were revealed and Faith was returned to Nick and Sharon, she remained in love with him; Case called the pairing surprising, while [[SoapNet]] penned the relationship "dark".<ref name="e"/><ref name="dark"/> 

During head writer and executive producer [[Maria Arena Bell]]'s tenure on the show, the character's storyline changed in direction. In 2011, she was presumed dead and escaped from prison after being falsely sentenced for the murder of [[List of The Young and the Restless characters (2008)#Skye Lockhart Newman|Skye Newman]] (Laura Stone). The following year, Sharon had a romantic relationship with her ex father-in-law, [[Victor Newman]] ([[Eric Braeden]]), which Case labelled [[incest]]uous. This was followed by a plot which saw Sharon manipulatively gain control over his company, Newman Enterprises, while he was missing. The once "beloved" character was then widely received as "crazy", with critics blaming Bell for the character's "royal destruction", "via one ill-conceived storyline and/or romance after another", amid vows to make Sharon stronger.<ref name="ra"/><ref name="MABCritic"/> Bell was fired, and replaced with [[Josh Griffith]] who vowed to rebuild the character,<ref name=rebuild/> which led to Sharon being diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]], explaining her out of character behavior.<ref name="Eppie"/>

Sharon has been characterized as "kindhearted", but also "insecure" and "not your typical romantic lead".<ref name=tvsoap /> Despite crimes and faults, the character is described as a central heroine<ref name="heroine"/> and has been called soap opera's "hottest mess".<ref name=suicide/> The [[supercouple]] pairing of [[Nicholas Newman and Sharon Collins|Nick and Sharon]], dubbed as "Shick" by viewers, has garnered a large fan following. Case has became popular with viewers, gathering multiple awards and nominations including two [[Soap Opera Digest Awards]] and the [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress]] in 1999, among five other Daytime Emmy nominations. Case' performance has received general praise from critics, with many praising her for withstanding Bell's heavily panned storylines.

Prior, Nick cheated on Sharon with Grace which nearly ended their marriage, but Cassie's custody battle reunited them. 

In 2001, Matt ([[Rick Hearst]]) returns to town after plastic surgery with a fake identity, Carter Mills. He attempts to rape Sharon and succeeds; his identity is ultimately revealed and he dies after driving off a cliff. Sharon ends up pregnant, with Matt possibly fathering her child. During an argument with Nick, Sharon trips and falls, giving birth to a stillborn baby girl. After a paternity test, Nick is revealed to be the baby's father. Sharon finds solace in the Newman ranch's handyman [[Diego Guittierez]] ([[Greg Vaughan]]) who had been dating Nick's sister Victoria at the time. Her unfaithfulness resulted in her splitting up with Nick. Nick later sees Sharon kissing Victor, which leaves Sharon humiliated and depressed. She leaves town, and while away, meets Cameron Kirsten, a man who has an affair with her and later abuses her brutally. Sharon returns to Genoa after her wounds healed, but is horrified when Cameron comes to town for business with Newman Enterprises.

Confused, Sharon spirals out of control and experiences [[kleptomania]]. She has a brief affair with Jack's brother, [[Billy Abbott]] ([[Billy Miller (actor)|Billy Miller]]). Sharon ends up pregnant, and Nick jumps back and forth between her and Phyllis. He ultimately remains with Phyllis when Sharon lies by stating Jack is the father of the child. Sharon checks herself into a psychiatric hospital after her kleptomania got out of control. She gives birth to a baby girl named Faith, who is stolen by Adam Newman, Nick's brother, and presents it to Jack's sister [[Ashley Abbott]] ([[Eileen Davidson]]), who he caused to miscarry her own child. Believing her baby is dead, Sharon becomes close with Adam, who bonds with her out of guilt. Sharon and Adam are married, though the truth about Faith is soon revealed and the marriage ends. Months later, Sharon shoots Adam while he tries to visit her at the Abbott cabin, believing he was trying to break in; he survives. Nick and Sharon reunite briefly, but split up once again after she cheats on him with Adam, who follows her to [[New Orleans]] where they slept together.

Adam is believed to be permanently blind and Sharon sympathetically helps him recover from an attack. They reunite, but more of his past schemes are revealed.

During [[Maria Arena Bell]]'s time as the show's executive producer and head writer, the character's storyline descended into an unfavorable creative direction. Bell had made an oath to make the character a "stronger woman". Jillian Bowe of Zap2It heavily criticized Bell for not living up to this pledge. Bowe wrote: "Has transforming Sharon into a promiscuous, recovering kleptomanic, who never considers what her sexual choices will mean for her children, really made her stronger in [Bell]'s eyes?" Additionally, she stated that Sharon's "beloved" character is being "utterly assassinated, via one ill-conceived storyline and/or romance after another".

Kroll of ''Soap Central'' noted that it had "widely been expected" that Morrow and Case would receive nominations in the Outstanding Leading Actress and [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series|Actor]] categories at the [[33rd Daytime Emmy Awards]], which they were not. Despite this, Grimes did receive a nomination for Outstanding Younger Actress.<ref>{{cite web|last=J.

In January 2011, a Daytime Emmy award "Final push" by ''Canyon News'' suggested that her performance needed more "Emmy" attention.<ref>{{cite news|last=Garrett|first=Tommy|title=2011 Daytime Emmy Final Push|url=http://www.canyon-news.com/artman2/publish/Television/2011_Daytime_Emmy_Final_Push.php|accessdate=December 22, 2011|newspaper=Canyon News|date=January 30, 2011}}</ref> Case' performance in 2012, described as a "whirlwind year", was met with critical acclaim, due to writing by Bell that was criticized.<ref name="HwP" /> ''On-Air On-Soaps'' wrote: "Surviving probably one of the worst on-screen character assassinations in soap opera history, which virtually left viewers wondering, what the heck are the writers doing to the integrity of Sharon Newman, the once befallen heroine of Genoa City?, Case rebounded by making her performances noteworthy, no matter what the creative teams decided to do to her character".<ref name="HwP" /> This led ''Soap Opera Uncensored'' to name her "Entertainer of the Year" in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Branco|first=Nelson|title=Nelson Branco's Soap Opera Uncensored: Issue 59|url=https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/273469|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref>
