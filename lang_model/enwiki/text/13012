'''Tyngsborough High School''' (THS) is located at 36 Norris Road in [[Tyngsborough, Massachusetts|Tyngsborough]].

Tyngsborough High School has approximately 490 students, and is part of the Tyngsborough school district.

==History==
The building currently used as Tyngsborough Middle School had been used as the high school until 1988.  The current high school building was built next to the old one, and used to house both the Junior and Senior High Schools from grades seven through twelve.  In 2003 with the construction of a new elementary school in the district during the previous year, younger students were moved out of the old high school, which had been used for grades three through six, and the seventh and eighth graders moved into the old high school building which became Tyngsborough Middle School.  This left the ninth through twelfth graders in the current high school building.<ref name=TMP>{{cite web|url=http://www.toddjerseyarchitecture.com/artman2/publish/schools/Tyngsborough_High_School.shtml |title=Todd Jersey Architecture Tyngsborough High School |publisher=Town of Tyngsborough |year= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref>

==Campus==
The current Tyngsborough High School was opened in 1992 <!-- This section could be expanded. The older school dates to the 1960s. Before that, and certainly back in the 1940s, Tyngsboro kids went to Lowell High -->.  The school which was built next to the previous high school (currently the Jr High School) is two stories tall and contains a gym, cafe, and auditorium.  Designed by Todd Jersey, then of HMFH Architecture Inc., is naturally lit and "organized around an 'interior street' that provides a central gathering and socializing space for students, staff, and faculty in a cold-winter climate."<ref name=TJATHS>{{cite web|url=http://www.tyngsboroughma.gov/download/government/master_plan_tyngsborough.pdf |title=Master Plan for Tyngsborough Massachusetts |publisher=Todd Jersey Architecture |year= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref> In the back of the building, there are two softball/baseball fields that can be converted into a soccer field. The high school also has a turf football field that is used for soccer, lacrosse, football, and many other activities.

==Curriculum==
Tyngsborough is moving to a trimester system starting in the fall of 2011, where courses formerly offered for one semester will now be a 2.5 credit, one tri-mester course.

==Sports==

In 1994 Tyngsborough Football won their first Super Bowl at the Division 5B level, beating [[Nantucket]] 31-7. 

Beginning in 2001, the Tigers football team started a 3-year run as runner-up in MIAA Division 5, losing the Super Bowl three straight seasons. In 2001, they lost to Bellingham High 38-28 (after defeating Cohasset High in the playoff round). In 2002, the team lost to Abington High 25-0 (defeating Hopkinton High to advance there), and in 2003, fell again, this time to Westwood High 21-14 (after defeating Bishop Fenwick in the playoff round). The team would win the CAC title two more years in '04 and '05 (although losing in the playoff round those two years). This long-time dominance was a crucial reason for THS leaving the CAC in 2007.

They entered the Dual County League in 2007. The school experienced little to no success in most sports in the DCL, largely owing to the smaller number of students. In 2011, the athletic program transitioned from Eastern to Central MA, joining the Midland-Wachusett League, C division.

In 2007 and 2008, the Baseball team became Division 3 North Champions.

In 2008 the soccer team made it to the division 3 north finals.

In 2011 The Tyngsboro Boys Soccer Team in the new Mid WACH C Division finished 15-3-1 qualified  for the Division 2 Central Tournament.

In 2011 the Tyngsboro High girls cross country team captured the Division 2 championship in the Central Mass. Cross Country Meet held on November 12 at the Gardner Municipal Golf Course.
