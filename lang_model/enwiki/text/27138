'''George Graham''' (born [[November 30]], [[1944]] in [[Bargeddie]], [[Glasgow]]) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] former [[Football (soccer)|football]] player and [[manager]]. He is best remembered for his success at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], as a player in the 1970s and then as manager from 1986 until 1995. 
==Playing career==
Despite being Scottish, George Graham played exclusively in [[England]] and the USA. He signed for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1961, having just turned 17. He spent three seasons at the [[Birmingham]] club, but only made eight appearances &ndash; though one of them was the club's [[1963 Football League Cup Final|1963]] [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final loss to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] signed him in July 1964 for <U+00A3>5000. Graham scored 35 goals in 72 league games for the club and won a League Cup medal in [[Football League Cup Final 1965|1965]] but he, along with several other Chelsea players, increasingly clashed with their volatile manager [[Tommy Docherty]]. This culminated in Graham and seven others being sent home and disciplined by Docherty for breaking a pre-match [[curfew]] in 1965.

[[Bertie Mee]]'s [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] were looking for a replacement for [[Joe Baker]], and paid <U+00A3>75,000 plus [[Tommy Baldwin]] in 1966 to bring him to [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]]. He made his debut on [[October 1]] [[1966]] on [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], a 4-2 defeat, and immediately became a regular in the Arsenal side. He was Arsenal's top scorer in both [[1966-67 in English football|1966-67]] and [[1967-68 in English football|1967-68]], having started out as a [[centre forward]] for the club, but later moved to [[inside forward]] with [[John Radford]] moving from the wing to up front.

With Arsenal, Graham was a runner-up in both the [[1968 Football League Cup Final|1968]] and [[1969 Football League Cup Final|1969]] League Cup finals, before finally winning a medal with the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1969-70]] [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]]. He followed it up with being an integral part of Arsenal's [[the Double|Double]]-winning side of [[1970-71 in English football|1970-71]], and even had a claim to scoring Arsenal's equaliser in the [[FA Cup]] [[1971 FA Cup Final|Final]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], although [[Eddie Kelly]] is officially credited with the goal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/1321973.stm | title=1971 - King George of Wembley | work=BBC Sport }}</ref>

Winning the Double brought the attention of [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and Graham was selected for the national side for the first time against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] on [[October 13]] [[1971]]. He would go on to win twelve caps over the next two years for Scotland, scoring three goals, his final one coming against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on [[June 30]] [[1973]]. By now, however, Graham was no longer an Arsenal player.

The arrival of [[Alan Ball (footballer)|Alan Ball]] midway through [[1971-72 in English football|1971-72]] had made his place in the Arsenal side less assured; he moved for <U+00A3>120,000 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in December 1972. In total, he played 308 matches for Arsenal, scoring 77 goals. He spent two years at United, and was relegated to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]], before seeing out his career in England at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. He played the summer of 1978 in America playing for the [[California Surf]].<ref>[http://www.nasljerseys.com/Players/G/Graham.George.htm NASL Stats]</ref>

==Managerial career==
===Millwall===

After retiring from playing, he became a coach at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and then later [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]]. On [[6 December]] [[1982]] Graham was appointed manager of [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], who were then bottom of the old [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. Graham turned the side around in a short space of time - they avoided relegation that season and in [[1984-85 in English football|1984-85]] they were promoted to the old [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. After he left the club in 1986, they went on to win the Second Division and win promotion to the First in [[1987-88 in English football|1987-88]]

===Arsenal===

Graham's achievements at Millwall attracted attention from bigger clubs, and he was appointed manager of his old club Arsenal on [[14 May]] [[1986]]. Arsenal had not won a trophy since the FA Cup in [[1978-79 in English football|1978-79]], and were drifting away from the top teams in the League. Graham cleared out much of the old guard and replaced them with new signings and players promoted from the youth team, while imposing much stricter discipline than his predecessors, both in the dressing room and on the pitch. Arsenal's form immediately improved, so much so that the club were top of the League at Christmas 1986, the club's [[centenary]], for the first time in a decade.

Arsenal finished fourth in Graham's first season in charge, and they went on to win the [[1987 Football League Cup Final|1987 League Cup]]. While Arsenal lost the League Cup final the following year (a shock 3-2 defeat to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]), their League form steadily improved. Graham's side featured tight defensive discipline, embodied by his young captain [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]], who along with [[Lee Dixon]], [[Steve Bould]] and [[Nigel Winterburn]], formed the basis of the club's defence for over a decade. However, contrary to popular belief, during this time Graham's Arsenal were not a purely defensive side; Graham also employed capable midfielders such as David Rocastle, [[Michael Thomas]] and [[Paul Merson]], and striker [[Alan M. Smith|Alan Smith]], whose prolific goalscoring regularly brought him more than 20 goals per season.

At the end of Graham's third season ([[1988-89 in English football|1988-89]]), the club won their first League title since 1971, in highly dramatic fashion, in the final game of the season against Liverpool at [[Anfield]]; Arsenal needed to win by two goals to take the title; Alan Smith scored for Arsenal early in the second half to make it 1-0, but as time ticked by Arsenal struggled to get a second, and with 90 minutes gone on the clock, Arsenal still needed another goal. With only seconds to go, a Smith flick-on found Michael Thomas surging through the Liverpool defence; the young midfielder calmly lifted the ball over [[Bruce Grobbelaar]] and into the net, and Arsenal were League Champions.

Unable to retain the league title the following season, Graham signed goalkeeper [[David Seaman]] and [[Sweden|Swedish]] winger [[Anders Limpar]] in the close season; both players proved vital as Arsenal won a second title in [[1990-91 in English football|1990-91]] and reached the FA Cup semi-finals, losing to arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Graham went on to sign striker and eventual second all-time top scorer [[Ian Wright]] from [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in October, and the club's first entry in the European Cup since 1971-72. The European venture went badly; Arsenal were knocked out by [[SL Benfica]] in the second round and failed to make the lucrative group stage. The season went from bad to worse when the Gunners were knocked out of the FA Cup by lowly [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]], though Arsenal recovered to finish fourth in the League. 

After this season, Graham changed his tactics; he became more defensive and turned out far less attack-minded sides, which depended mainly on goals from Wright rather than the whole team. Between [[1986-87 in English football|1986-87]] and [[1991-92 in English football|1991-92]] Arsenal averaged 66 League goals a season (scoring 81 in 1991-92), but between [[1992-93 in English football|1992-93]] and [[1994-95 in English football|1994-95]] only averaged 48;<ref>Statistics sourced from {{cite web | url=http://www.fchd.info/ARSENAL.HTM | title=Arsenal | work=Football Club History Database | accessdate=September 21 | year=2006 }}</ref> this included just 40 in 1992-93, when the club finished 10th in the inaugural season of the [[FA Premier League]], scoring fewer than any other team in the division.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng93.html | title=England 1992/93 | work=RSSSF | accessdate=September 21 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Graham's Arsenal become Cup specialists, and in 1992-93 Arsenal became the first side to win the FA Cup and League Cup double, both times Arsenal beating [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], 2-1 in the [[1993 Football League Cup Final|League Cup Final]] and 2-1 after a replay in the [[1993 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] replay. The next season they continued in the same vein, winning the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], their second European trophy; in the final Arsenal beat favourites and holders [[Parma A.C.|Parma]] 1-0 with a tight defensive performance and Alan Smith's 21st minute goal from a left foot volley.

The 1994 Cup Winners' Cup proved to be George Graham's last trophy at the club; the following February he was sacked after nearly nine years in charge, after it was discovered he had accepted an illegal <U+00A3>425,000 payment from Norwegian agent [[Rune Hauge]] following Arsenal's 1992 acquisition of John Jensen, one of Hauge's clients. Graham was eventually banned for a year by the Football Association for his involvement in the scandal, after he admitted he had received an "unsolicited gift" from Hauge.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,148114,00.html | title=Rune Hauge, international man of mystery | work=The Guardian | accessdate=June 27 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

===Leeds United===

After serving his ban, George Graham's return to football management came with [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in September 1996. He took over a Leeds team that was struggling against relegation at the time and his first priority was the defence; although Leeds scored fewer goals than any other [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] club (28) they still finished in a secure 13th place. Bringing in players such as [[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]] in the close season, [[1997-98 in English football|1997-98]] saw Leeds score twice as many goals as the previous season finish fifth in the Premiership and secure [[UEFA Cup]] qualification.

===Tottenham Hotspur===

In October 1998 Graham's two-year spell as Leeds manager came to an end when he was appointed manager of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Just five months after taking charge he guided the club to victory over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in the [[1999 Football League Cup Final|1999 League Cup Final]], and with it a place in the [[UEFA Cup 1999-00|1999-00 UEFA Cup]]. However, Graham could never get Tottenham above tenth in the Premiership, and he was sacked as Tottenham manager in March 2001 after falling out with the club's new chairman [[Daniel Levy (Tottenham Hotspur)|Daniel Levy]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Despite guiding the club to its first trophy in eight seasons, Graham remained unpopular with a large section of the supporters, because of his previous role at Arsenal, Tottenham's most bitter rivals.

===Since 2001===

He has been out of management ever since, concentrating on his career as a football pundit for [[Sky Sports]]. Towards the end of his tenure at Tottenham, Graham was hospitalised with [[rheumatoid arthritis]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}} However, he has been linked with jobs since.
