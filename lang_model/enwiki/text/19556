Buffum was born in 1828 in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] and enlisted into the 21st Ohio Infantry at [[Gilead Township, Morrow County, Ohio|Gilead, Ohio]] on September 2, 1861.<ref name="Times">{{Cite web |url=http://projects.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=2701 |title=Military Times Hall of Valor |accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref> He was among a group of Ohio men (19 soldiers and 2 civilians) who volunteered to participate in a secret mission to disrupt Confederate communication. In April the group, led by [[James J. Andrews]], which later came to be called ''Andrews' Raiders'', boarded a train in Georgia. On April 12th, after the train had stopped in [[Kennesaw|Big Shanty]], they commandeered the train's engine and three boxcars and headed towards [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. Under pursuit from the Confederates, they destroyed track and telegraph lines along the way. They never made it to Chattanooga but abandoned the engine. They were all captured within a week. Some of the men were hanged. Buffum was taken as a prisoner of war, but was eventually exchanged on 17 March 1863.<ref name="Times"/><ref name="Raid">{{Cite web |url=http://www.andrewsraid.com/buffum.html |title=Private Robert Buffum |accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>
