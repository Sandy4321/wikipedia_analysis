The '''13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS ''Handschar'' (1st Croatian)''' was a [[Waffen-SS]] [[Gebirgsjager|mountain infantry]] [[Formation (military)#Commands.2C formations.2C and units|formation]] used to conduct operations against [[Yugoslav Partisans]] in the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) from March to December 1944.<ref>[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], pp. 498-501</ref> Named ''Handschar'', after a local [[fighting knife]] or [[Scimitar|sword]] carried by Turkish policemen during the Ottoman period,<ref>[[#Tomasevich 2001|''Handschar'' (''Hand<U+017E>ar'') Tomasevich (2001)]], p. 497</ref><ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 47</ref> it was one of thirty-eight [[Division (military)|divisions]] fielded by the Waffen SS during [[World War II]] and the first SS division to be formed entirely of non-Germanic peoples.<ref name="Tomasevich496">[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], p. 496</ref>

The division was composed of [[Bosniaks|Bosnian Muslims]] with some Catholic [[Croats|Croat]] soldiers and mostly German and [[Germans of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Volksdeutsche]] officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s. The division took an oath of allegiance to both [[Adolf Hitler]] and the leader of the NDH, [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]].<ref name="Tomasevich499">[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], p. 499</ref> 

The division initially operated within a designated 'security zone' in north-eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] within the NDH between the [[Sava]], [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]], [[Drina]] and [[Spre<U+010D>a]] rivers, administratively part of the [[Posavje Great Parish|Posavina]] and Usora-Soli counties.<ref name="Lepre143-145">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 143-145</ref> The division also fought briefly in the [[Syrmia]] region north of the Sava, prior to crossing into north-eastern Bosnia and in adjacent areas of Bosnia.<ref name="Lepre145-151">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 145-151</ref> In late 1944, parts of the division were transferred briefly to the [[Zagreb]] area, after which the non-German members began to desert in large numbers. Over the winter of 1944&ndash;1945, the division was sent to the [[Baranya (region)|Baranja region]] where it fought against the [[Red Army]] and [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Bulgarians]] throughout southern [[Hungary during World War II|Hungary]], falling back via a series of defensive lines until they were inside the [[Nazi Germany|Reich]] frontier. Most of the remaining Bosnian Muslims left at this point and attempted to return to Bosnia. The rest retreated further west, hoping to surrender to the [[Western Allies]]. Most of the remaining members became [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]] of the [[British Army during the Second World War|British Army]]. Thirty-eight officers were [[Extradition|extradited]] by the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian authorities]] to face criminal charges, of whom ten were executed.

==Background==
===NDH and Ante Paveli<U+0107>===
[[File:Sve<U+010D>ano otvaranje d<U+017E>amije 18.8.1944.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]] at the official opening of the [[Poglavnik]]'s mosque (the present-day [[Me<U+0161>trovi<U+0107> Pavilion]]) which was an art museum that was converted into a mosque by the addition of [[minaret]]s.]]
After the fall of [[Sarajevo]] to [[Nazi Germany]] on 16 April 1941, the extreme Croat nationalist and fascist [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]], who had been in exile in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], was appointed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' or leader of a new [[Usta<U+0161>e]] state - the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Nezavisna Dr<U+017E>ava Hrvatska}}, NDH). The NDH incorporated the territory of several provinces ({{lang-sh|[[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovina]]}}) of the defeated [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] which were reconstituted as an 'Italian-German quasi-protectorate'.<ref>[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], p. 272</ref> NDH authorities, led by the Usta<U+0161>e, launched a vicious campaign against the [[Serb]] population.<ref>[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], pp. 397-409</ref>

In an effort to secure the loyalty of the Bosnian Muslims, Paveli<U+0107> ordered that a property in [[Zagreb]] be converted into a [[mosque]] that he named 'Poglavnik's Mosque'.<ref>[[#Malcolm_1994|Malcolm (1994)]], pp. 174<U+2013>176</ref> Despite Paveli<U+0107>'s assurances of equality with the Croats, many Muslims became dissatisfied with Croatian rule. An Islamic leader reported that not one Muslim occupied an influential post in the (local) administration. Fierce fighting broke out between the Usta<U+0161>e, [[Chetniks]] and Partisans in NDH territory. Some Usta<U+0161>e units became convinced that the Muslims were communist sympathizers. In response they burned their villages and murdered many civilians.<ref name="Lepre15-16">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 15-16</ref> Chetniks accused Muslims of taking part in the Usta<U+0161>e violence against Serbs and perpetrated similar atrocities against the Muslim population. The Muslim population received little protection from the [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Home Guard]], whom the Germans described as 'of minimal combat value'. Local militias were raised, but these were of limited value and only one, the [[Tuzla]]-based Home Guard '[[Had<U+017E>iefendi<U+0107> Legion]]' led by [[Muhamed Had<U+017E>iefendi<U+0107>]] was of any significance.<ref name="Lepre15-16"/>

===Denunciations and request for protection===

The Bosnian Muslim elite and notables issued resolutions or memoranda in various cities that publicly denounced Croat-Nazi collaborationist measures along with laws and violence against Serbs: [[Prijedor]] (23 September 1941), [[Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims]] (12 October), [[Mostar]] (21 October), [[Banja Luka]] (12 November), [[Bijeljina]] (2 December) and Tuzla (11 December). The resolutions condemned the Usta<U+0161>e in Bosnia and Herzegovina, both for their mistreatment of Muslims and for their attempts to turn Muslims and Serbs against one another.<ref>[[#Hoare_2007|Hoare (2007)]], p. 227</ref> One memorandum declared that since the beginning of the Usta<U+0161>e regime, the Muslims dreaded the lawless activities that some Usta<U+0161>e, some Croatian government authorities and various illegal groups perpetrated against the Serbs.<ref>[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], p. 492</ref>

This dissatisfaction with Usta<U+0161>e rule and need for protection of the Bosnian Muslim population was combined with nostalgia for the period of [[Austria-Hungary|Habsburg]] rule in Bosnia and a generally friendly attitude towards Germany among some prominent Bosnian Muslims. These factors led to a movement towards autonomy for the Bosnian Muslim community which was strongly opposed by Paveli<U+0107> as counter to the integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, the Muslim autonomists led by Uzeiraga Had<U+017E>ihasanovi<U+0107> were desperate to protect their people and wrote to [[Adolf Hitler]] asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the [[Nazi Germany|Reich]].<ref name="Lepre16-17">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 16-17</ref>

==Origin==
On 6 December 1942, ''[[Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] and key Waffen SS recruiting officer ''SS-[[Obergruppenf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Gottlob Berger]] approached Hitler with the proposal to raise a Bosnian Muslim SS division. Both the [[Wehrmacht]] and the Waffen SS were concerned about the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the NDH that tied down German military personnel needed elsewhere.<ref name="Lepre15-16"/> A German source noted that by 1943 over 100,000 Bosnian Muslims had been killed and 250,000 had become refugees. In addition, a serious food shortage threatened the region. "The Muslims" remarked ''[[Obergruppenf<U+00FC>hrer|SS Obergruppenf<U+00FC>hrer and General of Waffen-SS]]'' [[Artur Phleps]], "bear the special status of being persecuted by all others".<ref name="Lepre16-17"/>

The romantic notions that Himmler had for the Bosnian Muslims were probably significant in the division's genesis.<ref name="Tomasevich496"/> Himmler was personally fascinated by the [[Islam]]ic faith and believed that Islam created fearless soldiers.<ref name="Lepre16-17"/> He found their ferocity preferable to the gentility of Christians and believed their martial qualities should be further developed and put to use.<ref name="Tomasevich496"/> He thought that Muslim men would make perfect SS soldiers as Islam "promises them Heaven if they fight and are killed in action."<ref name="Stein182">[[#Stein_1984|Stein (1984)]], p. 182</ref> As for their ethnic background and SS requirements, it appears that Himmler accepted the theories advanced by both Croatian and German nationalists that the Croatian people, including the Muslims, were not ethnic Slavs but pure [[Germanic peoples|Aryans]] of either Gothic or Iranian descent.<ref name="Lepre16-17"/><ref>[[#Bishop & Williams_2003|Bishop & Williams (2003)]], p. 70</ref>

Himmler was inspired by the noted successes of the [[Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry]] in [[World War I]]. George Lepre wrote, "Himmler endeavored to restore what he called 'an old Austrian' tradition by reviving the Bosnian regiments of the former Austro-Hungarian army in the form of a Bosnian Muslim SS Division. Once raised, this division was to engage and destroy [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s Partisan forces operating in north-eastern Bosnia, thus restoring local 'order'. Himmler's primary concern in the region was not the security of the local Muslim population, but the welfare of ethnic German settlers to the north in Syrmia. 'Srem (Syrmia) is the breadbasket of Croatia, and hopefully it and our beloved German settlements will be secured. I hope that the area south of Srem will be liberated by [...] the Bosnian division [...] so that we can at least restore partial order in this ridiculous (Croatian) state."<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 18</ref>

Hitler formally approved the project in mid-February 1943 and Himmler put then ''[[Gruppenf<U+00FC>hrer|SS Gruppenf<U+00FC>hrer and Generalleutnant of Waffen-SS]]'' [[Artur Phleps]], commander of the [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen|7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division ''Prinz Eugen'']] (''SS-Prinz Eugen''), in charge of raising the first SS division to be composed of non-Germanic people.<ref name="Tomasevich496"/><ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 19</ref>

==Recruitment==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Mielke-036-23, Waffen-SS, 13. Gebirgs-Div. "Handschar".jpg|thumb|Soldiers of ''SS-Handschar'' with a brochure about "Islam and Judaism", 1943]]

Phleps travelled to Zagreb to begin formal negotiations with the NDH government on 18 February 1943. He met with German foreign ministry envoy [[Siegfried Kasche]] and NDH Foreign Minister Dr. [[Mladen Lorkovi<U+0107>]] who represented Paveli<U+0107>. Paveli<U+0107> had already agreed to raise the division, but the Waffen SS and NDH governments had very different ideas of how it would be recruited and controlled. Lorkovi<U+0107> suggested that it be named "SS Usta<U+0161>a Division", a Croatian unit raised with SS assistance, with familiar regimental such as ''Bosna'', ''Krajina'' and ''Una''. Paveli<U+0107> and Kasche was concerned that an exclusively Muslim division might aid a Muslim bid for independence. As a compromise, the word "Croatian" was included in its official title and some Croatian Catholic officers were recruited.<ref>[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], pp. 497-498</ref> Himmler and Phleps largely prevailed and created the division as they saw fit, leaving NDH very unhappy with the outcome, particularly regarding its ethnic composition.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 20-24</ref>

''SS-[[Standartenf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Karl von Krempler]], a specialist in [[Islam]] who also spoke Serbo-Croat, was charged by Himmler and Phleps with organising the division. On 3 March 1942, Phleps met with von Krempler, who was to work with NDH government representative Dr. Alija <U+0160>uljak. The campaign began on 20 March 1942, when von Krempler and <U+0160>uljak began an 18 day recruiting tour through 11 Bosnian districts. In the meantime the Germans began raising the divisional headquarters staff in Berlin, including ''SS-Standartenf<U+00FC>hrer'' (of the Reserves) Herbert von Oberwurzer, who was transferred from the [[6th SS Mountain Division Nord|SS Mountain Division Nord]] to command the division.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 24-25</ref>

<U+0160>uljak and von Krempler soon fell out over the aims and purposes of the proposed division. <U+0160>uljak, an entirely political appointee, criticized von Krempler's Serbian dialect and his use of traditional Islamic colours and emblems (green flags and crescent moons) rather than the Usta<U+0161>e symbols during the recruitment drive. When he reached Tuzla in central Bosnia, von Krempler met the Muslim militia leader [[Major]] [[Muhamed Had<U+017E>iefendi<U+0107>]], who was then officially serving in an under-equipped [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Home Guard]] unit. On 28 March, Had<U+017E>iefendi<U+0107> escorted von Krempler to [[Sarajevo]], where he introduced him to Hafiz Muhamed Pand<U+017E>a, who was the leader of the Islamic clergy for Bosnia, the ''Reis-ul-Ulema'' and other leading Muslim politicians not involved with the Usta<U+0161>e. The NDH government and Kasche were furious, demanding von Krempler's immediate removal. The SS ignored the demand and von Krempler continued recruiting, including both Muslim and Catholic deserters from the NDH armed forces.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 27-285</ref>

===Mufti of Jerusalem===
In April 1943, the [[Mufti]] of [[Jerusalem]], [[Haj Amin al-Husseini|Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], was invited by key Waffen SS recruiter ''SS-Obergruppenf<U+00FC>hrer'' [[Gottlob Berger]] to assist in organizing and recruiting Muslims into the Waffen SS and other units. He was escorted by von Krempler, who also spoke fluent [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The Mufti successfully convinced the Muslims to ignore the declarations of the [[Sarajevo]], [[Mostar]] and [[Banja Luka]] ''[[Ulama]]'' (Islamic clerics), who in 1941 forbade them from collaborating with the Usta<U+0161>e.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 31-35</ref> 
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-036-05, Amin al Husseini bei bosnischen SS-Freiwilligen.jpg|thumb|right|Grand Mufti [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], alongside ''[[Brigadef<U+00FC>hrer|SS-Brigadef<U+00FC>hrer and Generalmajor of Waffen SS]]'' [[Karl-Gustav Sauberzweig]], greeting Bosnian SS volunteers together with Nazi officers in November 1943.]]

''The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'' states that "The Germans made a point of publicizing the fact that al-Husayni had flown from Berlin to Sarajevo for the sole purpose of giving his blessing to the Muslim army and inspecting its arms and training exercises". According to Aleksa <U+0110>ilas in ''The Nation That Wasn't'', al-Husayni: "accepted, visited Bosnia and convinced some important Muslim leaders that a Muslim SS division would be in the interest of Islam."<ref>[[#Mousavizadeh_1996|Mousavizadeh (1996)]], p. 23</ref>

The Mufti insisted, "The most important task of this division must be to protect the homeland and families (of the Bosnian volunteers); the division must not be permitted to leave Bosnia", but the Germans paid no attention.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 34</ref>

===Croat Catholic recruitment===
Despite the support of al-Husayni, recruitment for the division fell well short of the numbers needed and to Himmler's dismay, 2,800 Croat Catholics were inducted.<ref name="Lepre35">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 35</ref>  

Hussein Bi<U+0161><U+010D>evi<U+0107> (Husejin Bi<U+0161><U+010D>evi<U+0107> or Bi<U+0161><U+010D>evi<U+0107>-beg; born 28 July 1884) was the highest ranking (and perhaps the oldest) [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnian]] military officer to volunteer. Biscevic had served in the [[Austro<U+2013>Hungarian Army]] and he was appointed ''SS-[[Obersturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' of the anti-aircraft battalion in August 1943. However, he was judged unsuitable and replaced with a German just before the division went into combat.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 118</ref>

==Composition==
Sources differ regarding the division's initial composition. Pavlowitch<ref name="Pavlowitch177">[[#Pavlowitch 2007|Pavlowitch 2007]], p. 177</ref> states that sixty percent of its recruits were Muslims and the rest were [[Germans of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav ''Volksdeutsche'']] who made up the majority of its [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]s, while Tomasevich<ref name="Tomasevich498-499">[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], pp. 498-499</ref> counters that it was formed with 23,200 Muslims and 2,800 Croats, with mostly German officers. He further states it was the largest of the Muslim SS Divisions with 26,000 men.<ref name="Tomasevich498-499"/> Lepre indicates that the division's prescribed strength was reduced from 26,000 to 21,000,<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 138-139</ref> and Cohen states that the division achieved a maximum strength of 17,000 in April 1944.<ref>[[#Cohen 1996|Cohen (1996)]], p. 101</ref> The number of Christians was higher than directed by Himmler, who had allowed a 10% Christian component only after the recruitment of sufficient Muslims proved difficult.<ref name="Lepre35"/> The division had a Muslim [[Imam]] for each battalion other than the all-German signal battalion.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 75</ref> For about six months the division included about 1,000 ethnic [[Albania]]ns from [[Kosovo]] and the [[Sand<U+017E>ak]] region who made up the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment, which later became the 1st Battalion of the 28th Regiment (I/28).<ref name="Tomasevich499"/><ref name="Lepre48-49">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 48-49</ref>

By the time the division had completed its training, its officer corps was almost entirely German but it was about one third short of its goals in both officers and NCOs.<ref name="Lepre48-49"/>

==Formation, training and mutiny==
The division was initially sent to southern France for formation and training, where it was accommodated mainly in towns and villages in the [[Aveyron]] and [[Loz<U+00E8>re]] [[d<U+00E9>partement]]s. For a long period after its official formation, the division was unnamed and was referred to as the 'Kroatishen SS-Freiwillingen-Division' (Croatian SS-Volunteer Division) or the 'Muselmanen-Division' (Muslim Division).<ref name="Stein181">[[#Stein_1984|Stein (1984)]], p. 181</ref> The decision by the Waffen SS to form and train the division outside Bosnia was contrary to advice given by the NDH's German plenipotentiary general, [[Edmund Glaise-Horstenau|Edmund Glaise von Horstenau]]. This advice soon proved prophetic.<ref name="Lepre107">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 107</ref>

===Villefranche-de-Rouergue Mutiny (September 1943)===
[[File:Spomenik u Villefranche de Rouergueu.jpg|thumb|The original memorial to the "Yugoslavian combatants" in Villefranche unveiled in 1952]]
On the night of 16/17 September 1943, while ''SS-Handschar'' was training in [[Villefranche-de-Rouergue]] in France, a group of pro-Partisan soldiers led by Muslim and Catholic junior officers<ref name="Tomasevich499"/> staged a mutiny within the Pioneer battalion. Led by [[Ferid D<U+017E>ani<U+0107>]], [[Bo<U+017E>o Jelinek]] (aka Eduard Matutinovi<U+0107>), Nikola Vukeli<U+0107> and Lutfija Dizdarevi<U+010D>, they captured most of the German personnel and executed five German officers, including battalion commander ''SS-Obersturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer'' Oskar Kirchbaum. Apparently the mutineers believed that many of the enlisted men would join them and they could reach the western Allies.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 82-88</ref>

The revolt was put down with the assistance of the unit Imam, [[Halim Malko<U+0107>]] and unit physician Dr. Willfried Schweiger. Malko<U+0107> told the Bosnian enlisted men of 1st Company that they were being deceived, released the German NCOs and rallied the company to hunt down the ringleaders. Schweiger did the same with 2nd Company. Dizdarevi<U+010D> and D<U+017E>ani<U+0107> were shot and killed during the fighting, Vukeli<U+0107> was captured, while Jelinek/Matutinovi<U+0107> escaped.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 86-103</ref> 

Sources vary on the number of mutineers killed after the revolt was put down. Tomasevich<ref name="Tomasevich499"/> states that 78 of the worst offenders were executed, but Lepre lists only 14 executions<ref name="Lepre103">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 103</ref> while four more deserters were located and shot in late September.<ref name="Lepre106">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p.106</ref> Cohen states that about 150 mutineers were killed immediately.<ref name="Cohen101-102">[[#Cohen 1996|Cohen (1996)]], pp. 101-102</ref> The Germans attributed the infiltration  to Tito's suggestion that his Partisan followers enlist for police duty to receive superior weapons, uniforms and training. Enlistees who were deemed "unsuitable for service" or "politically unreliable" were subsequently purged. Some 825 Bosnians were eventually removed from the division and sent to [[Nazi Germany]] for labor service with ''[[Organisation Todt]]''. Of these, 265 refused and were sent to [[Neuengamme concentration camp]] where dozens of them died.<ref name="Lepre107"/>

Speaking of the Bosnian Muslim troops who had served in the [[Austro<U+2013>Hungarian Army]], Himmler later said, "I knew there was a chance that a few traitors might be smuggled into the division, but I haven<U+2019>t the slightest doubt concerning the loyalty of the Bosnians. These troops were loyal to their supreme commander twenty years ago so why shouldn<U+2019>t they be so today."<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 104</ref> Himmler awarded both Malko<U+010D> and Schweiger the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross Second Class]] for thwarting the mutiny. Five soldiers, including Ejub Ja<U+0161>arevi<U+0107> and Adem Okanad<U+017E>i<U+0107> were also decorated.<ref name="Lepre103"/>

When the city was liberated in 1944, the population decided to pay tribute to the mutineers by naming one of its streets ''Avenue des Croates'' (Bosnian Muslims were seen by the local population as Croats of Islamic faith) and commemorating "the revolt of the Croats" every 17 September. Cohen states that after the war, the Yugoslav government requested it be changed to "the revolt of the Yugoslavs" in order to obscure the mutineers' ethnicity, which was refused by the French.<ref name="Cohen101-102"/> The [[Villefranche-de-Rouergue uprising]] was originally commemorated in the city with a monument designed by Croatian sculptor Vanja Radau<U+0161>.<ref>[[#Corak_2006|Corak (2006)]]</ref>

===Silesia===
As a result of the mutiny, the division was moved to the [[<U+015A>wi<U+0119>tosz<U+00F3>w|Neuhammer]] training grounds in the [[Silesia]]n region of Germany (current day Poland) to complete its training.<ref name="Lepre106"/> During the training phase, the German officers, pleased with its progress, coined the term ''Mujo'' for the Bosnian Muslims.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 64</ref>

On 9 October 1943 SS headquarters officially named the division the 13th SS-Freiwillingen b.h. Gebirgs-Division (Kroatien), but a short time later a change was made to differentiate it from those that were composed of Germans and it became the 13th Waffen-Gebirgsdivision der SS "Handschar" (kroat. Nr. 1).<ref name="Stein181"/>

==Anti-Partisan operations March to May 1944==
[[File:Handzar.PNG|thumb|400px|right|Security zone corresponding to local district subdivisions highlighted in green]]
The division was formed for the primary role of securing around {{convert|6000|km2}} of territory (the designated security zone) in north-eastern Bosnia within the NDH. The security zone encompassed the Posavina, Semberija and Majevica regions between the Sava, Bosna, Drina and Spre<U+010D>a rivers. Himmler saw this task as critical to the safeguarding of important agricultural areas and ''Volksdeutsche'' settlements in the Syrmia region to the north.<ref name="Lepre143-145"/>

The division participated in what may have been the largest anti-Partisan sweep of World War II: ''Operation Maibaum'', in which the ''SS-Prinz Eugen'' was also involved.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 187</ref> ''SS-Handschar'' also participated in a number of other divisional and [[corps]]-sized anti-Partisan operations between March and September 1944.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 213-247</ref>

===Operation ''Wegweiser''===
The division first saw action during Operation ''Wegweiser'' (Signpost) from 9 to 12 March 1944. The aim of Operation ''Wegweiser'' was to clear a part of the [[Syrmia]] region which was occupied by Partisans who threatened the Zagreb-Belgrade railway. The Partisans were operating from  particular forests around [[Bosut (Sremska Mitrovica)|Bosut]] and villages along the [[Sava|Sava river]]. The Partisans avoided decisive engagement and withdrew to the south-east. Sauberzweig claimed the Partisans suffered 573 killed and 82 captured. The operation was a success in clearing the Bosut forests, but the Partisans returned to the area soon after the operation concluded.<ref name="Lepre145-151"/>

===Operation ''Save''===
Begun on 15 March 1944, the objective of Operation ''Save'' (Sava) was the clearing of Partisans from the [[Semberija]] region of the security zone in northeastern Bosnia, across the [[Sava|Sava River]]. Before the crossing, Sauberzweig wrote an open letter to the division: "We have now reached the Bosnian frontier and will (soon) begin the march into the homeland. [...] The F<U+00FC>hrer has provided you with his best weapons. Not only do you (have these) in your hands, but above all you have an idea in your hearts - to liberate the homeland. [...] Before long, each of you shall be standing in the place that you call home, as a soldier and a gentleman; standing firm as a defender of the idea of saving the culture of Europe - the idea of Adolf Hitler."<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 151-152</ref>

Sauberzweig also ordered that each commander read a prepared message as his unit crossed the Sava River, which emphasized that the "liberation of Bosnia" and ultimately the liberation of "Muslim Albania" was their goal, directly appealing to their Albanian troops. The 27th Regiment crossed the Sava at dawn at [[Bosanska Ra<U+010D>a]] near the confluence with the [[Drina]]. The restcrossed at Br<U+0109>ko covered by an intense artillery bombardment. Contact was immediately made with Partisan forces, who quickly withdrew into the forests. The service support units remained in Vinkovci, which became their permanent garrison area. The 27th Regiment advanced easily across the [[Pannonian Plain]] through [[Velino Selo]] to [[Brodac]] and then on to [[Bijeljina]] which was taken against light Partisan resistance late on 16 March.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 151-155</ref>

The 27th Regiment then consolidated its position in Bijeljina while the 28th Regiment and the divisional reconnaissance battalion ({{lang-de|[[Aufkl<U+00E4>rungsabteilung]]}}) bore the brunt of the fighting as they advanced through [[Pukis]], [[Celic]] and Koraj at the foot of the [[Majevica]] mountains. Sauberzweig later recorded that the 2nd battalion of the 28th Regiment (II/28) "at Celic stormed the Partisan defenses with (new) battalion commander [[Hans Hanke]] at the point" and that enemy forces withdrew after a hard battle with heavy losses, low on ammunition.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 155</ref>

Once the area was secured, defensive positions were established along the Celic-Lopare road and units sent out company strength reconnaissance. On the night of 17&ndash;18 March, elements of the Partisan 16th and 36th Vojvodina Divisions mounted unsuccessful attacks against the 28th Regiment's positions at Koraj and Zabrde, losing over 200.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 157</ref>

===Operation ''Osterei''===
After Operation ''Save'', the division remained relatively static for more than three weeks, mopping up and beating off local Partisan attacks. The Muslims were impatient to push further into Bosnia. However, the reconnaissance battalion was heavily engaged on the divisional western flank, attacking positions held by the Partisan 3rd Vojvodina Brigade at [[Gornji Rahi<U+0107>]] on 26 March, killing 124 Partisans and capturing fourteen. The battalion captured several more Partisan positions in the following week.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 162</ref>

Operation ''Osterei'' (Easter Egg) began on 12 April 1944 with the goal of clearing the [[Majevica]] mountain, which was held by elements of the Partisan 3rd Corps led by [[Vladimir Popovi<U+0107> (diplomat)|General Vladimir Popovi<U+0107>]]. The 27th Regiment quickly captured [[Janja]] and drove through [[Trnova|Donja Trnova]] to reach an important economic objective for the German war machine, the [[Ugljevik|Ugljevik coal mines]]. Following fighting which continued into the evening of 13 April, the 27th Regiment reported Partisan casualties of 106 dead, 45 captured and 2 deserters along with large amounts of weapons and ammunition. The regiment also seized a huge amount of medical supplies from aid stations in the area of Donja Trnova.<ref name="Lepre165">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 165</ref>

The 28th Regiment drove south through Ma<U+010D>kovac and during fighting around [[Priboj]], its 1st battalion (I/28), made up of Albanians, incurred heavy casualties. The Partisan 3rd Corps then withdrew the 16th and 36th (Vojvodina) divisions south across the Tuzla-Zvornik road. The reconnaissance battalion continued the advance, driving into the western Majevicas and capturing [[Srebrnik]] and [[Grada<U+010D>ac]] then linking up with the [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Home Guard]] 1st Mountain Brigade. The Germans considered Operation ''Osterei'' a major success, achieving all objectives with minimal losses.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 165-168</ref>

During the final phase of Operation ''Osterei'', I/28 (made up of Albanian soldiers) was withdrawn from the fighting and transferred to [[Pristina]] in [[Kosovo]] to form part of the [[21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian)]] being raised by Himmler's order. A new I/28 was raised from other divisional units and new recruits.<ref name="Lepre165"/>

In the latter part of Operation ''Osterei'', ''Jagdkommandos'', lightly armed and mobile 'hunter teams' of battalion or company strength were used to break up and harass Partisans still operating on the flanks.  These teams killed over 380 Partisans and captured over 200 between 21&ndash;23 April.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 168-169</ref> By mid-April, half of the security zone had been cleared of Partisans.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 180</ref>

===Operation ''Maibaum''===
<!-- image removed: [[File:Operation Maibaum AO.jpg|325px|thumb|right|Operation Maibaum area of operations showing the main axes of advance of SS ''Handschar'' and SS ''Prinz Eugen'']] -->
The ambitious goal of Operation ''Maibaum'' (Maypole) was to destroy the Partisan Third Bosnian Corps. [[Army Group F]] ordered [[V SS Mountain Corps]] to form a blockade along the Drina to prevent the Partisan force from crossing into Serbia. Operation ''Maibaum'' was one of the largest counter-insurgency operations of World War II and included ''SS-Prinz Eugen'' and NDH forces. Under the command of V SS Mountain Corps, the primary tasks were to capture Tuzla and [[Zvornik]], then drive south parallel with the Drina to meet the other elements of V SS Mountain Corps. The original plan included the parachute insertion of [[500th SS Parachute Battalion]] into the [[Vlasenica]] area, but this was cancelled due to unsuitable weather. Flank security was to be provided by the reconnaissance battalion in the Srebrnik area.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 187-189</ref> The deployment south of the Spre<U+010D>a and therefore outside the security zone during Operation ''Maibaum'' was ordered by Corps commander Phleps, against Sauberzweig's opposition. This caused friction between the two which eventually required Himmler's intervention.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 193-194</ref>

On 23 April, the 28th Regiment pushed south along mountain roads through Tuzla then as far as [[Stupari (Lukavac)|Stupari]] the following day. On 25 April, the 27th Regiment advanced south to capture Zvornik. At the same time, the 28th Regiment sent I/28 east towards Vlasenica and II/28 continuing south towards [[Kladanj]], capturing the town on 27 April. Due to the level of the [[Drinja<U+010D>a]] at Klandanj, instead of fording the river and pushing east towards Vlasenica, II/28 continued south-east towards [[Han Pijesak]], where they met elements of ''SS-Prinz Eugen'' advancing north.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 189-191</ref>

I/28 captured Vlasenica on 28 April, but was almost immediately attacked from the east by two Partisan divisions. A third Partisan division surrounded the headquarters of 28th Regiment at [[<U+0160>ekovi<U+0107>i]], some 30 kilometres north-west of Vlasenica. Both II/28 and the reconnaissance battalion were rushed to Vlasenica, where II/28 relieved the battered I/28 and then surrounded <U+0160>ekovi<U+0107>i. After a 48 hour battle, during which II/28 was decimated, the town was taken.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 191-193</ref>

While the battle of <U+0160>ekovi<U+0107>i raged, the 27th Regiment extended the Drina blockade further south, ambushing a Partisan column and reaching [[Nova Kasaba]] on 30 April. After the situation at <U+0160>ekovi<U+0107>i improved on 1 May, the 27th Regiment returned to patrolling the Tuzla-Zvornik road. The 28th Regiment moved to the Simin Han-[[Lopare]] area on 5 May, while ''SS-Prinz Eugen'' pursued the Partisans withdrawing south.<ref name="Lepre193">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 193</ref>

Operation ''Maibaum'' had not only stopped the Partisan 3rd Corps from crossing the Drina into Serbia, it had scattered the Partisan formation and killed nearly a thousand. On 6 May, V SS Mountain Corps ordered the division to return to the security zone north of the Spre<U+010D>a.<ref name="Lepre193"/>

===Operation ''Maigl<U+00F6>ckchen''===
On 17<U+2013>18 May 1944, the division, along with the local [[Majevica]]-Tuzla Chetnik unit commanded by [[Radivoj Kerovi<U+0107>]], commenced Operation ''Maigl<U+00F6>ckchen'' (May Bell) to destroy several Partisan brigades in the Majevicas. The Partisans were encircled in the Stolice heights. An attempt by the Partisan 16th Vojvodina Division to relieve the surrounded force was defeated by the reconnaissance battalion and elements of the 28th Regiment. The relieving column was driven back across the Spre<U+0107>a. After heavy bombardment by the artillery regiment, the trapped Partisan force escaped south out of the pocket under cover of darkness on 18 May. The Partisans suffered considerable casualties, the 17th Majevica Brigade alone losing 16 killed and 60 missing. At the conclusion of Operation ''Maigl<U+00F6>ckchen'', the 27th Regiment remained near Zvornik and the 28th Regiment deployed near Srebrnik.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 194-198</ref>

==Cooperation with local forces in the security zone==
[[File:Hampel and Chetnik.jpg|thumb|Commander of ''SS-Handschar'', ''SS-[[Standartenf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Desiderius Hampel]] confers with a [[Chetnik]] commander - Summer 1944]] 
After Operation ''Maigl<U+00F6>ckchen'', the division shifted to a largely defensive posture aimed at denying Partisans access to the security zone. Since its arrival in the zone the division had been assisted in this task by local forces of varying reliability. These included four groups of Chetniks numbering 13,000, Ne<U+0161>ad Top<U+010D>i<U+0107>'s ''Zeleni kadar'' (or Green Cadres, a Muslim nationalist militia) most of which eventually joined the Partisans and both Usta<U+0161>a militia and Croatian Home Guard, neither of which was effective. These same groups, along with the Partisans, had simultaneously been trying to encourage Bosnian and Croat members to defect. Between March and June 1944, these attempts were largely fruitless, producing fewer than 200.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 198-204</ref>

==Anti-Partisan operations June to August 1944==

===Operation ''Vollmond''===
Following [[Seventh Enemy Offensive|Operation ''R<U+00F6>sselsprung'']] (Knight's Move), the German attempt to kill or capture Tito at [[Drvar]] in western Bosnia on 25 May 1944, the Partisan leader ordered a general uprising. The Partisan 3rd Bosnia Corps planned an offensive that involved three parallel columns of divisional strength thrusting north into the zone to engage and destroy German and local allied forces.<ref name="Lepre213">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 213</ref>       

Operation ''Vollmond'' (Full Moon) was devised quickly after the reconnaissance battalion observed Partisan forces crossing the Tuzla-Zvornik road on the evening of 6 June 1944. Sauberzweig's aim was to assault from the east and north, pushing the advancing Partisan forces against the Drina. However, the German plan underestimated the strength of the Partisan 'Western Column' which consisted of the 16th Vojvodina Division and placed only I/28 on some heights in their path. I/28 included a large number of new recruits who had only recently joined the division and was protecting two batteries of the artillery regiment, one unit of which (7/AR13) was deployed just east of [[Lopare]].<ref name="Lepre213"/>

Late on 7 June, the Partisans scattered I/28 and although II/28 was sent from Srebrenik to assist, the 16th Division surged forward against the positions of 7/AR13, which consisted of 80 men with four 150mm guns and only one [[machine gun]]. After four hours fighting, and with half the battery's personnel dead, the artillerymen ran out of small arms ammunition and scattered into the forest. II/28 counterattacked on the afternoon of 9 June and throughout 10 June, the Partisan 16th Vojvodina Division withdrew that afternoon and II/28 pursued both the Partisan 'Western Column' and 'Centre Column' south. The guns and vehicles of 7/AR13 had been destroyed by the Partisans before they withdrew and there were reports that the German dead at Lopare had been mutilated. The 'Eastern Column' was stopped by the 27th Regiment and the last of the Partisan 3rd Bosnia Corps was pushed back across the Spre<U+010D>a on 12 June.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 214-222</ref>

Operation ''Vollmond'' cost the division 205 dead, 528 wounded and 89 missing. I/28 had been decimated, with only 180 men remaining. However, the Germans had killed over 1,500 Partisans and captured large amounts of arms and ammunition.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 222-223</ref>

At the conclusion of Operation ''Vollmond'', the commander of the 27th Regiment, [[Desiderius Hampel]] was appointed division commander and Sauberzweig was tasked with forming a new corps headquarters, the [[IX Waffen Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian)]]. The commander of the 28th Regiment, Hellmuth Raithel was tasked to raise the new [[23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian)]]. Both the new corps headquarters and new division were to be formed in southern Hungary. Three NCOs from every company of ''SS-Handschar'' along with other personnel, were transferred to form the core of ''SS-Kama''.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 223-230</ref> New commanders were appointed to the two mountain infantry regiments, notably Hans Hanke for the 28th.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 324</ref>

Soon after Hampel's assumption of command, he became aware that local Chetniks were scavenging the Operation ''Vollmond'' battlefields for divisional equipment. He met with the Chetnik leader Kerovi<U+0107> and arranged for the return of the equipment in exchange for small arms ammunition and boxes of hand [[grenade]]s.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 231</ref>

Throughout the remainder of June 1944 and into the first week of July, the division was engaged in fighting off attempted Partisan incursions into the security zone and reinforcing local NDH and Chetnik who were under attack from the Partisans.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 231-234</ref>

===Operation ''Fliegenf<U+00E4>nger''===
Launched on 14 July 1944, Operation ''Fliegenf<U+00E4>nger'' (Flypaper) was to destroy a Partisan makeshift runway in the [[Osmaci]] area about 26&nbsp;km southeast of Tuzla south of the Tuzla&ndash;Zvornik road and destroy the Partisan forces guarding it. The airstrip was just north of the southern boundary of the security zone and was being used by Allied aircraft to bring in supplies and evacuate wounded Partisans to Italy. The airfield was defended by elements of the 19th ([[Bira<U+010D> (region)|Bira<U+010D>]]) Partisan Brigade of the 27th (Eastern Bosnia) Division. Two battalions of the 27th Regiment, along with a battalion of Chetniks captured the towns of Osmaci and [[Memi<U+0107>i (Kalesija)|Memi<U+0107>i]] and destroyed the airfield despite stiff resistance. Forty two Partisans were killed, while the division's losses were four dead and seven wounded. The Partisan force withdrew south to the Vlasenica-Raji<U+0107>i area. The cooperation with the Chetnik battalion was described in the IX SS Mountain Corps war diary as 'effective'.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 234-235</ref>

===Operation ''Heiderose''===
While the division was conducting Operation ''Fliegenf<U+00E4>nger'', Second Panzer Army was developing a plan to block a large Partisan force from moving from central Bosnia into western Serbia to reinforce Partisan forces. Due to issues with the availability of various units of V SS Mountain Corps, the planned 'Operation Rose' was cancelled.<ref name="Lepre235-236">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 235-236</ref>

However, in the interim, since most of the division was deployed in the southern part of the security zone, Hampel decided to develop a divisional-level operation, named Operation ''Heiderose'' (Wild Rose) targeting Partisan positions north-west of <U+0160>ekovi<U+0107>i, south of the Spre<U+010D>a. The 27th Regiment, reinforced by the same Chetnik battalion that cooperated in Operation ''Fliegenf<U+00E4>nger'', would attack east towards <U+0160>ekovi<U+0107>i and the 28th Regiment would push south. A detached battalion of ''SS-Prinz Eugen'' would act as a blocking force driving north. Hampel was apparently unhappy with the performance of the new commander of the 27th Regiment (''SS-Obersturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer'' Hermann Peter) and put the divisional chief of staff, ''SS-Sturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer'' Erich Braun in charge of the 27th Regiment.<ref name="Lepre235-236"/>

On 17 July the operation began. Fierce resistance was immediately encountered by the 28th Regiment, while the 27th Regiment climbed the heights to Udr<U+010D> before dusk without serious opposition.<ref name="Lepre236-237">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 236-237</ref>

Early on 18 July, the Chetniks attacked from Matkovac towards <U+0160>ekovi<U+0107>i. The 27th Regiment reached Ba<U+010D>kovac and seized the high ground south of <U+0160>ekovi<U+0107>i on 19 July 1944. The 28th Regiment forced the Partisan 36th Vojvodina Division back. The battalion from ''SS-Prinz Eugen'' encountered serious resistance around Vlasenica but pushed through. On 19 July, the 28th Regiment drove north towards Gornje Petrovice to attack the Partisan 12th Corps at <U+017D>ivinice. The reconnaissance battalion of ''SS-Prinz Eugen'' pushed in from Vare<U+0161> as a blocking force to stop the Partisans from withdrawing via Kladanj.<ref name="Lepre236-237"/>

The Partisans then committed the 16th Vojvodina Division to assist the 36th Vojvodina Division that had borne the brunt of Operation ''Heiderose'' to this point. Both divisions attacked the 27th Regiment on 20 July, which counterattacked the following day after the Partisans were rebuffed with heavy casualties. On 23 July, the Partisans began to withdraw south out of the area. The division began to search for the hidden Partisan bases that German intelligence had indicated were located in the area. After a day of searching, the division located more than ten Partisan bases, which the cooperating Chetniks began to clear, despite the fact that they had shown little interest in actually fighting the Partisans over the previous days.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 239-240</ref>

Operation ''Heiderose'' was a significant success for the division, causing serious losses to the Partisans. More than 900 Partisans were killed and a large amount of equipment was captured; 1 anti-tank gun, 2 mortars, 22 machine guns, over 800 rifles and nearly 500,000 rounds of small arms ammunition. The division suffered 24 killed and over 150 wounded. Erich Braun was recommended for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross but the recommendation was not supported, apparently due to disagreements between the divisional staff and Phleps that had occurred during the division's formation.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 240</ref>

===Operation ''Hackfleisch''/''R<U+00FC>bezahl''===
In the first week of August 1944, Second Panzer Army was finally ready to move to thwart the Partisan advance from Bosnia into Serbia, originally planned as Operation Rose. Renamed Operation ''R<U+00FC>bezahl'' (Mountain Spirit) the revamped plan required ''SS-Handschar'' and ''SS-Prinz Eugen'' to form the Bosnian phase of the operation, named Operation ''Hackfleisch'' (Minced Meat). ''Hackfleisch'' aimed to drive out the Partisans occupying the area between the towns of [[Kladanj]], [[Vlasenica]], [[Sokolac]] and [[Olovo]], south of the security zone. The overall plan involved columns that were to force the Partisan eastwards into the pincers of the other units, thereby destroying them.<ref name="Lepre241-243">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 241-243</ref>

The columns were allocated tasks and composed as follows:<ref name="Lepre241-243"/>

* the reconnaissance battalion of ''SS-Prinz Eugen'' was to drive west from Vare<U+0161> and attack the Partisans around the town of Olovo, pushing them east
* I/28 from ''SS-Handschar'' was to attack south and south-east from Ribnica towards Olovo
* III/28 from ''SS-Handschar'' was to thrust south and south-east from Klandanj towards the village of Petrovi<U+0107>
* the 27th Regiment of ''SS-Handschar'' was to drive southwards from <U+0160>ekovi<U+0107>i
* parts of the 14th Regiment of ''SS-Prinz Eugen'' were to push north-west between Olovo and Sokolac
* Parts of the 13th Regiment of ''SS-Prinz Eugen'' were to attack northwards through Sokolac

The 27th Regiment became locked in fierce fighting with the Partisan 27th and 38th East Bosnian, which had launched an offensive near Vlasenica. The inability of the 27th Regiment to push forward meant that the plan to encircle the Partisan force was not achieved and the Partisans escaped by crossing the Vlasenica-Han Pijesak road to the east. Other Partisan forces withdrew in the direction of [[Gora<U+017E>de]].<ref name="Lepre241-243"/>

From the German perspective, Operation ''Hackfleisch'' was a moderate success, with 227 Partisans killed and over 50 prisoners taken. It delayed but did not prevent the move of Partisan forces into Serbia.<ref name="Lepre241-243"/><ref>[[#Tomasevich 1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], p. 411</ref> To enable ''SS-Prinz Eugen'' to pursue Partisan forces withdrawing towards central Bosnia, both I/28 and III/28 were placed under command of that division for the period 8&ndash;17 August 1944.<ref name="Lepre241-243"/> During the remainder of August 1944, the rump fought hard to keep the Partisans out of the security zone. The Partisan 11th Border and 38th East Bosnia divisions quickly infiltrated into the southern part of the security zone and the 27th East Bosnia Division crossed into the area north-west of [[Srebrenica]] and drove towards [[Bratunaci]]. After a series of rapid redeployments and battalion and regimental attacks, the division scattered the 11th Border Division and mauled the 27th East Bosnia Division.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 243-247</ref>

The division had by now been fighting almost continuously throughout the summer. According to divisional commander Hampel, had been exhausted even before Operation ''Hackfleisch'' began. The cumulative effect of this exhaustion, the deteriorating situation the Germans faced on all fronts and rumors probably spread among members by the Partisans and/or Usta<U+0161>a, was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 244-252</ref>

==Last battles against the Partisans==
In early September 1944, the division returned north to the security zone, basing the infantry  battalions in the villages of Kurukaja, Vukovije (south of Fo<U+010D>a), [[Osmaci]] and Srebrnik. Almost immediately, the Partisan III Bosnian Corps commenced an offensive, attacking II/28 at Srebrnik. IT held on despite being pressed hard during two days of fighting against the 11th Border Division. By the end of the first week in September, divisional supply columns were being attacked by Chetniks, sensing German weakness and looking for arms and supplies. II/27 was assaulted unsuccessfully at Matkovac. Over the same week, the Allies conducted [[Operation Ratweek]] throughout the Balkans, which involved  Allied air power pounding Axis troop concentrations and key infrastructure in order to impede the German withdrawal from Greece. The local effect was to complicate the division's logistics through destruction of the Sarajevo-Brod railway and mass desertions of NDH troops tasked with securing supply lines.<ref>[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 248-251</ref>

After the first week of September, most of its fighting power was shifted to the western boundary of the security zone to meet Partisan incursions. The division succeeded in dislodging Partisan units from Slatna and Mededa and allied Chetniks captured Skurgi<U+0107>. After relief by NDH forces, the division's fighting regiments withdrew to Br<U+0109>ko for rest and refit. As a result of the shift to the western area of the security zone, the zone's southern area was quickly overrun by Partisan forces. Zvornik and Tuzla had fallen by mid-September.<ref>[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 251-252</ref>

==August 1944&ndash;May 1945==
On 17 August 1944 Tito had offered a general amnesty and many in the division took advantage of this opportunity. During the first three weeks of September, while hard fighting continued, over 2,000 Bosnians deserted, many taking their weapons with them. Some went home, some joined the 'Zeleni kadar' militia and some went over to the Usta<U+015D>e. Many defected to the Partisans, with over 700 having joined the Partisan III Bosnian Corps by early October.<ref>[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 253</ref>

Due to high rates of desertion from ''SS-Handschar'', Sauberzweig proposed to disarm the Bosnians in both ''SS-Handschar'' and ''SS-Kama'', but Himmler instead opted to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of ''SS-Kama'' from Hungary to Bosnia and re-organise the remaining troops of both divisions there, with key support units from ''SS-Handschar'' centralised under IX SS Mountain Corps, which would also move to Bosnia from Hungary.<ref>[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 256-257</ref>

In the early morning of 3 October 1944, the Partisan 28th Slavonia Division assaulted a squadron of the reconnaissance battalion at [[Janja]] close to the Drina on the eastern boundary of the security zone. As they broke out of encirclement to the north, the rest of the reconnaissance battalion drove south from [[Bijeljina]] and stopped the Partisan advance at heavy cost. III/27 rushed towards Janja from the west and came into contact with Partisans around [[Modran]], reaching the Janja barrison at 10&nbsp;PM that night and received artillery reinforcement by 3/AR 13 during the night. At the dawn of the following day, an additional four Partisan brigades attacked the garrison in Janja, with fighting continuing throughout the day before the Partisans withdrew to the south. ''Jagdkommandos'' were sent after the fleeing enemy but were not able to inflict significant losses on them as they had already crossed the Drina into the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia]]. Following this battle, Army Group F concluded that the division's overall combat value was minimal.<ref>[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 261-262</ref>

However, a few days later, the 9th Company of the 28th Regiment (9/28) displayed what could still be achieved by the Bosnians under determined leadership when ''Leutnant'' Hans K<U+00F6>nig ambushed the Partisan XVII Majevica Brigade near [[Vukosavci]], killing at least 67 and capturing orders for future operations. K<U+00F6>nig was awarded the German Cross in Gold for his fanatical leadership.<ref name="Lepre263">[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 263</ref>

===The division splits===
While 9/28 was fighting near Vukosavci, a number of units, consisting mainly of artillery, were temporarily detached for duty with other formations of Second Panzer Army fighting the Russians within the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia. Some did not rejoin the division until January 1945.<ref name="Lepre263"/>  

After a request from Army Group F to Himmler, a decision was made to move IX SS Mountain Corps and the division to perform road and railway security duties near Zagreb. This would relieve LXIX Army Corps from those duties so that it could reinforce a defensive line along the Drina facing the advancing Red Army. The 28th Regiment, I/27 and III/AR 13 were to remain behind at the Br<U+010D>ko bridgehead to keep the Sava river bridge open.<ref>[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 264</ref> While the heavy desertions from the division were the main reason for the move from north-east Bosnia to northern Croatia,<ref>[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], p. 430</ref> the move made matters worse. On 16 October 1944 the move commenced. The Bosnians were very reluctant to leave Bosnia and the already serious desertion rate became a flood. Many took their weapons with them and hundreds joined the Partisans.<ref>[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 264-267</ref>

===Operation ''Herbstlaub''===
On 20 October the Red Army and Partisan forces liberated [[Belgrade]] and the following day the divisional staff Imam, [[Abdullah Muhasilovi<U+0107>]], incited a mutiny and led 100 men back to Bosnia.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 266</ref> Himmler finally agreed to the disarming of the 'unreliable' Bosnians under Operation ''Herbstlaub'' (Autumn Leaves) on 25 October. 900-1,000 Bosnians in the Br<U+010D>ko bridgehead and over 2,300 in Zagreb were allocated to labour battalions and similar non-combatant auxiliary duties, although the disarming operation was not completed in the Zagreb area until mid-November. By the beginning of November the division, which had been 95% non-German in January 1944, was now 50% German. The plans to re-organise the division were abandoned, Sauberzweig was relieved of command, his IX SS Mountain Corps staff was dissolved and the remnant was placed under the command of LXVIII Army Corps, under which it remained for the rest of the war.<ref>[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 268-271</ref>

===Fighting the Russians===
Meanwhile, the advance of the Red Army through Belgrade and north into the Hungarian-occupied Yugoslav region of [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]] made holding the line of the [[Danube]] critical for the Germans. In early November the Russians established a bridgehead over the Danube from [[Apatin]] (in modern-day [[Serbia]]). From 9 November onward the division was committed in several stages to the Eastern Front, starting with the reconnaissance battalion which went into action at [[Darda, Croatia|D<U+00E1>rda]] west of the Apatin bridgehead on 10 November. They were followed by a grouping of three battalions (I/27, II/28 and II/28), an artillery battalion (III/AR 13) and some pioneers. Known as ''[[Kampfgruppe]] Hanke'' after their commander [[Hans Hanke]], they moved from the Br<U+010D>ko bridgehead and joined a blocking position at [[Beli Manastir|P<U+00E9>lmonostor]] on 14 November south-west of a second Russian bridgehead that had been established at [[Batina]] (in modern-day [[Croatia]]). As a result the last Muslim SS troops left Bosnia. Within a week they were joined by the reconnaissance battalion, which had acquitted itself well in fighting west of Apatin. By 20 November, the Red Army was across the Danube in force at Batina. The following day ''Kampfgruppe Hanke'' was driven out of its positions, when the remaining 200 troops withdrew. By 25 November the rest of the division was on its way from the Zagreb area. The remnants of ''Kampfgruppe Hanke'' were placed under command of [[44th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|''Reichsgrenadier Division Hoch und Deutschmeister'']], withdrawing as far as Sikl<U+00F3>s in southern [[Hungary]] by 29 November.<ref>[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 276-281</ref>

Within days ''Kampfgruppe Hanke'' was withdrawn from the front line, moving to [[Barcs]] on the Drava river to rebuild. On 2 December the division was reunited, except for the rest of the pioneer battalion, stranded in Bosnia by damage to bridges and railways until February 1945. As a result of continued desertions and the catastrophic casualties suffered by ''Kampfgruppe Hanke'', the division retained little of its original Bosnian character. Despite the return of some disarmed Bosnians from labour units, the attachment of Hungarian infantry and artillery units and arrival of German replacements meant the division looked little different from any other unit in the Second Panzer Army.<ref>[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 282</ref>

After a short break, the division was allocated to a sector of the 'Margarethe Line', a series  of fixed defensive works south of [[Lake Balaton]] which held up the Russian advance. After several Red Army assaults, the fighting turned into trench warfare for a period over December 1944&ndash;January 1945 before a few units were involved in [[Operation Fr<U+00FC>hlingserwachen]] (Spring Awakening) in early March, which was Germany's last major offensive. From December 1944 to March 1945, the rest had remained at Barcs rebuilding and had been joined by the divisional pioneer battalion. On 16 March the Soviet [[Vienna Offensive]] was launched, bypassing the Barcs area. On the night of 16&ndash;17 March the division attacked the flanks of the Soviet drive at [[Heresznye]]&mdash;its last offensive operation.<ref>[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 282-291</ref>

===Retreat to the Reich===
On 29 March the Soviet 57th Army and Bulgarian First Army assaulted the entire Second Panzer Army front, quickly breaching the line near [[Nagybajom]]. The division, holding positions just south of the penetration, began to withdraw to the north-west. It fell back to the [[Mur (river)|Mura]] and barely managed to cross under constant air and ground attacks, with grievous casualties. Unable to take up effective positions, the division crossed the [[Third Reich|Reich]] frontier on 6 April and took up positions at [[Ptuj|Pettau]] in the so-called 'Reich Defence Line', where it remained until 5 May. The last fighting was around Kiesmanndorff on 19 April.<ref>[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 292-301</ref>

===The end of the division===
On 5 May the remaining men, both German and Bosnian, began to retreat eastwards towards [[Austria]]. On 8 May an order was sent to retreat to [[Wolfsberg, Carinthia]].<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 300</ref> On learning of the orders, unit imams of the 28th Regiment "approached their commander, Hans Hanke and requested that they and their men be discharged and be allowed to attempt to return to their homeland.... Soon, all of the Bosnians remaining in the division were asked if they wished to remain."<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 302</ref> There are two reports of large scale reprisal killings of these members of ''SS-Handschar'' by the Partisans, one of which included the mass shooting of 1,400 soldiers.<ref>[[#Bohme_1962|B<U+00F6>hme (1962)]], pp. 107-109</ref><ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 303-304</ref>

The retreat continued until 11 May. On 12 May Hampel carried out surrender negotiations with the [[British Army during the Second World War|British Army]] at [[Sankt Veit an der Glan]]. On 15 May most of the men were transported to [[Rimini]] in Italy, where they were incarcerated with other [[prisoners of war]] from ''SS-Prinz Eugen'' and [[16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer-SS]].<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 304-308</ref> Some scattered remnants did not surrender until 18 May and many attempted to obliterate their SS blood type tattoos. Hampel escaped from a POW camp in Fallingbostel.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 309-310</ref>

==Reputation and treatment of civilians==
While it achieved some successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations  against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia,<ref>[[#Bishop_2007|Bishop (2007)]], pp. 137-138</ref> the division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations,<ref name="Tomasevich499"/> but also through atrocities committed against Serb civilians in the security zone.<ref>[[#Williamson_2004|Williamson (2004)]], p. 123</ref><ref>[[#Keegan_1970|Keegan (1970)]], p. 105</ref>

==Aftermath==
Thirty eight members were [[extradition|extradited]] to Yugoslavia to face trial. Some committed suicide, including ''[[General (Germany)|Generalleutnant]]'' Sauberzweig on 20 October 1946 and ''SS-Obersturmf<U+00FC>hrer'' Hans K<U+00F6>nig.<ref name="Lepre 1997 p. 311">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 311</ref> Between 22<U+2013>30 August 1947, trials took place at a military court in [[Sarajevo]]. "Although the indictment accused the division of murdering some five thousand people, only seven of the thirty-eight defendants were charged with specific offenses."<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 312</ref> The accused were defended by three Yugoslav lawyers: two civilian and one military officer. All 38 men were found guilty and either sentenced to death (10) or prison terms of between five years and life (28).<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 312-313</ref>  ''SS-Obersturmf<U+00FC>hrer'' Imam [[Halim Malko<U+010D>]] had already been executed at [[Biha<U+0107>]] on 7 March 1947.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 89</ref>

Almost all the prisoners were released early and by 1952 all had been freed, except ''SS-Sturmmann'' Wilhelm Mahn who had died. Having escaped, Hampel never faced a trial and lived until 11 January 1981 in Graz, [[Austria]].<ref name="Lepre 1997 p. 311"/>

==Commanders==
The following officers commanded the division. The first two raised and trained the division in its early stages of development and Sauberzweig and Hampel commanded it on active operations against the Partisans and later against the Red Army and Bulgarians:<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 321</ref>
*''SS-Gruppenf<U+00FC>hrer'' [[Artur Phleps]] (in charge of raising the division, from 13 February 1943)

==Awards==
Several members were decorated with high German military awards, with five awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (including Hampel and Hanke), five awarded the German Cross in Gold (including Hanke) and one awarded the German Cross in Silver.<ref>[[#Lepre_1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 345</ref>

==Order of battle==
*27th Waffen [[Gebirgsj<U+00E4>ger]] (Mountain Infantry) Regiment of the SS (1st Croatian)
*28th Waffen  [[Gebirgsj<U+00E4>ger]] (Mountain Infantry) Regiment of the SS (2nd Croatian)
*13th SS Mountain Artillery Regiment
*13th SS Mountain Reconnaissance Battalion
*13th SS ''[[Panzerj<U+00E4>ger]]'' (Anti-tank) Battalion
*13th SS Mountain Pioneer Battalion
*13th SS Anti-aircraft Battalion
*13th SS Mountain Signals Battalion
*13th SS Division Supply Battalion
*13th SS Logistics Battalion
*13th SS Medical Battalion
*13th SS Replacement Battalion

From 24 September 1944, the supply and logistics battalions were combined to form the 13th SS Service Support/Supply Regiment.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 321-329</ref>

==Uniform==
The uniform was regular SS M43 field-jacket issue, with a divisional collar patch showing an arm holding a [[scimitar]] over a [[swastika]].<ref>[[#German Mountain Warfare 1944|German Mountain Warfare (1944)]], pp. 88-89</ref> On the left arm was a Croatian armshield (red-white chessboard) and on the right an [[Edelweiss]] flower patch. The chessboard armshield was controversial, especially with the Imams, who, after crossing the Sava river, removed them. Former SS personnel serving in the division were entitled to wear a [[Sig Rune]] badge that was attached to the left breast pocket of the tunic.<ref name="Stein182"/><ref name="Lepre346347">[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], pp. 346-347</ref>

Headgear was either the SS M43 [[Fez (clothing)|fez]] which was to be worn by all ranks, while German officers had the option to wear the mountain cap (''Bergm<U+00FC>tze''). The fez was chosen by [[Heinrich Himmler]] because it had having been worn by the [[Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry]] regiments of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] from 1894 to 1918, as well as by the Austro-Hungarian Albanian Legion from 1916-18. There were two versions of the fez: a field gray model to be worn in combat and while on duty and a red model for parades, marching exercises and while off duty. Both the fez and mountain cap bore the death's head and eagle of the SS. The mountain cap was also adorned with an Edelweiss flower patch, worn on the left side of the cap.<ref name="Stein182"/><ref name="Lepre346347"/>

==Division Hymn==
Set to the melody of "Wir fahren gegen Engelland" (Bombs on England) by Herms Niel.<ref>[[#Lepre 1997|Lepre (1997)]], p. 361</ref>
