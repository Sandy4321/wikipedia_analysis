'''Juniper Networks''' is a multinational corporation headquartered in [[Sunnyvale, California]] that develops and markets networking products. Its products include [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Network switch|switches]], [[network management]] software, [[network security]] products and [[software-defined networking]] technology.

Juniper was founded in 1996 by [[Pradeep Sindhu]]. The company received several rounds of funding from venture capitalists and telecommunications companies before going public in 1999. Juniper grew to $673 million in annual revenues by 2000, challenging [[Cisco System|Cisco]]'s once-dominant market-share in networking products.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.networkworld.com/article/2210939/lan-wan/cisco-vs-juniper.html|title = Cisco vs Juniper|last = Duffy|first = Jim|date = June 7, 2010|work = Network World|access-date = April 20, 2015}}</ref><ref name="aoiuhfedo"/> It grew to $4 billion in revenues by 2004 and $4.63 billion in 2014. Juniper appointed [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in 2008, [[Shaygan Kheradpir]] in 2013 and [[Rami Rahim]] in 2014.

Juniper Networks originally focused on [[core router]]s, which are used by [[internet service provider]]s (ISPs) to perform [[Whois|IP address lookups]] and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of [[Unisphere Networks|Unisphere]] in 2002, Juniper entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003, before acquiring security company [[NetScreen Technologies]] the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper has been focused on developing new software-defined networking products.
