As '''Zeus Meilichio''', the [[Olympian gods|Olympian]] of [[Greek mythology]] subsumed as an attributive [[epithet]] an earlier [[chthonic]] ''[[daimon]]'', '''Meilichios''', who was propitiated in [[Athens]] by archaic rituals, as [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] demonstrated in detail in ''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion'' (1903). In the course of examining the archaic aspects of the [[Diasia]] festival, the greatest Athenian festival accorded [[Zeus]], she showed that it had been superimposed upon an earlier propitiatory ceremony.

"Meilichios", the "Easy-to-be-entreated", the gracious, accessible one, was the euphemistic aspect of ''Maimaktes'' the "raging" one, thirsty for blood (Harrison, p.&nbsp;17).<ref>In the [[Attic calendar]], [[Maimakterion]], the "raging" month, arrived in November-December.</ref> 

Explicitly inscribed votive reliefs show that Meilichios was figured in the form of a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], who might be invoked as a kind of [[Ploutos]], bringer of wealth. He had some of the avenging and fearful character of an [[Erinyes|Erynis]], for [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] saw near the River [[Cephissus]] "an ancient altar of Zeus Meilichios; on it [[Theseus]] received purification from the descendants of Phytalos after he after he had slain among other robbers Sinis, who was related to himself".  Meilichios' sacrifice was a [[holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]], which was wholly consumed in fire and not shared by the votaries, "a dread renunciation to a dreadful power" (Harrison, p.&nbsp;16), in nocturnal rites performed in an atmosphere of "chilly gloom" (Harrison), that was rendered in Greek as ''[[Styx (mythology)|stygiotes]]''.

Zeus tended to obscure the earlier figure he had supplanted. An Athenian of the fifth century would likely have conceived Zeus Meilichios as Zeus-Hades, Zeus "in his chthonic aspect".
