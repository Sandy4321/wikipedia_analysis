'''''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'''''<ref>By English typographical conventions, both book titles and ship names are usually italicized when written. Since "Dawn Treader" is part of both, it should in theory be put in Roman text to signify this, but the title would then not be distinct from the context. To avoid confusion, the entire book title is italicized in this article, and the ship name only when mentioned separately from the book title.</ref> is a [[fantasy]] novel for children by [[C. S. Lewis]]. Written in [[1950 in literature|1950]], it was published in [[1952 in literature|1952]] as the third book of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. Current editions of the series are numbered using the internal chronological order making ''Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' the fifth book.

==Plot summary==

The two youngest Pevensie children, [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]] and [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]], are staying with their odious cousin [[Eustace Scrubb]] while their older brother [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]] is studying for his university entrance exams with [[Digory Kirke|Professor Kirke]], and their older sister [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]] is traveling through America with their parents. Edmund, Lucy, and Eustace are drawn into the [[Narnia (world)|Narnian world]] through a picture of a ship at sea. (The painting, hanging neglected in the guest bedroom that the Pevensie children were using, had been an unwanted present to Eustace's parents.) The three children land in the ocean near the pictured vessel, the titular ''[[Dawn Treader]]'', and are taken aboard.

The ''Dawn Treader'' is the ship of [[Caspian X]], King of [[Narnia (country)|Narnia]], who was the key character in the previous book (''[[Prince Caspian]]''). Edmund and Lucy (along with Peter and Susan) helped him gain the throne from his evil uncle [[Miraz]].

Three years have passed since then, peace has been established in Narnia, and Caspian has undertaken his oath to find the [[Seven Great Lords of Narnia|seven lost Lords of Narnia]]. Lucy and Edmund are delighted to be back in Narnia, but Eustace is less enthusiastic, as he has never been there before and had taunted his cousins with his belief that the country never existed. The Talking Mouse [[Reepicheep]] is also on board, as he hopes to find [[Aslan's Country]] beyond the seas of the "utter East".

They first make landfall in the [[Lone Islands]], nominally Narnian territory but fallen away from Narnian ways: in particular the [[slave trade]] flourishes here, despite Narnian law stating that it is forbidden. Caspian, Lucy, Edmund, Eustace and Reepicheep are captured as merchandise by a slave trader, and a man "buys" Caspian before they even reach the slave market. He turns out to be the first lost lord, [[Lord Bern]], who moved to the islands and married a woman there after being banished from Narnia by Miraz. When Caspian reveals his identity, Bern acknowledges him as King. Caspian reclaims the islands for Narnia, and replaces Gumpas, the greedy governor, with Lord Bern, whom he names [[Duke]] of the Lone Islands.

At the second island they visit, Eustace leaves the group to avoid participating in the work needed to render the ship seaworthy after a storm has damaged it, and hides in a dead [[dragon]]'s cave to escape a sudden downpour. The dragon's treasure arouses his greed: he fills his pockets with gold and jewels and puts on a large golden bracelet; but as he sleeps, he is transformed into a dragon. As a dragon, he becomes aware of how bad his previous behaviour was, and uses his strength to help make amends. Caspian recognizes the bracelet: it belonged to Lord Octesian, another of the lost lords. They speculate that the dragon killed Octesian <U+2014> or even that the dragon ''was'' Octesian. Aslan turns Eustace back into a boy, now a much nicer person.

They make stops at Burnt Island; at Deathwater Island (so named for a pool of water which turns everything immersed in it into gold, including one of the missing lords who turns out to have been Lord Restimar); at the [[Dufflepuds|Duffers]]' Island, where Lucy herself encounters Aslan; and at the Island Where Dreams Come True&nbsp;<U+2014> called the Dark Island since it is permanently hidden in darkness. They rescue a desperate [[Lord Rhoop]] from this last. Eventually they reach the Island of the Star, where they find the three remaining lost lords in enchanted sleep. [[Ramandu]], the fallen star who lives on the island, tells them that the only way to awaken them is to sail to the edge of the world and there to leave one member of the crew behind.

The ''Dawn Treader'' continues sailing into an area where [[mermaid|merpeople]] dwell and the water turns sweet rather than salty. At last the water becomes so shallow that the ship can go no farther. Caspian orders a boat lowered and announces that he will go to the world's end with Reepicheep. The crew object, saying that as King of Narnia he has no right to abandon them. Caspian goes to his cabin in a temper, but returns to say that Aslan appeared in his cabin and told him that only Lucy, Edmund, Eustace, and Reepicheep will go on.

These four named venture in a small boat through a sea of lilies until they reach a wall of water that extends into the sky. Fulfilling Ramandu's condition, Reepicheep paddles his [[coracle]] up the waterfall and is never again seen in Narnia (Lewis hints that he reaches [[Aslan's Country]]). Edmund, Eustace, and Lucy find a lamb, who transforms into Aslan and tells them that Edmund and Lucy will not return to Narnia&nbsp;<U+2013> that they should learn to know him by another name in their own world. He then sends the children home.

In their own world, everyone remarks on how Eustace has changed and "you'd never know him for the same boy" - although his mother believes that Edmund and Lucy have been a bad influence on him.

==Differences between British and American editions==

Several weeks or months after reading the proofs for the British edition of ''The Chronicles'', Lewis read through the proofs for the American edition. While doing so, he made several changes to the text. When [[HarperCollins]] took over publication of the series in 1994 they made the unusual decision to ignore the changes that Lewis had made and use the earlier text as the standard for their editions.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schakel | first = Peter | title = Imagination and the Arts in C.S. Lewis: Journeying to Narnia and Other Worlds | page = 35 | publisher = University of Missouri Press | date = 2002 | ISBN = 9780826214072}}</ref>

In ''Dawn Treader'', Lewis made two changes; one minor and one of more substance. The minor change appears in the first chapter where Lewis changes the description of Eustace from "far too stupid to make anything up himself" to "quite incapable of making anything up himself". Paul Ford, author of ''Companion to Narnia'', suggests that Lewis might have felt the need to soften the passage for his American readers or perhaps he was starting to like Eustace better.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ford | first = Paul | title = Companion to Narnia: A Complete Guide to the Magical World of C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia | page = 178 | publisher = HarperCollins Publishers | date = 2005 | ISBN = 9780060791278}}</ref> Peter Schakel, author of ''Imagination and the arts in C.S. Lewis'', notes that the passage should have been changed in either case as "calling a character 'stupid' in a children's book is insensitive and unwise".<ref>{{cite book | last = Schakel | first = Peter | title = Imagination and the Arts in C.S. Lewis: Journeying to Narnia and Other Worlds | page = 37 | publisher = University of Missouri Press | date = 2002 | ISBN = 9780826214072}}</ref> Both Schakel and Ford agree that it is not an accurate depiction of Eustace as Lewis describes him, and this too may be the reason for the change.

The more substantive change appears in Chapter 12, "The Dark Island", where Lewis rewrote the ending in a way that, Schakel maintains, improves the imaginative experience considerably.
:The reader cannot [in this version] dismiss the island as unreal or as no longer existing: it is still there, and anyone who can get to Narnia still could get caught in it. More important, the inserted analogy, with its second-person pronouns, draws readers into the episode and evokes in them the same emotions the characters experience. This is no laughing matter, as the earlier version risks making it.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schakel | first = Peter | title = Imagination and the Arts in C.S. Lewis: Journeying to Narnia and Other Worlds | page = 38 | publisher = University of Missouri Press | date = 2002 | ISBN = 9780826214072}}</ref>

==Reception==
[[Anthony Boucher|Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas|McComas]] found ''Voyage'' "not quite up to the high level set by previous Narnian adventures," they singled out Reepicheep for praise as "one of Lewis's finest imaginings."<ref>"Recommended Reading," ''[[F&SF]]'', February 1953, p.74</ref>

==Influences==

Arguably, ''Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' is the novel which shows the most influence from Lewis' Irish background. It is reminiscent of the ''[[Immram]]'' genre of Irish literature.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0OON/is_1-2_26/ai_n21130446/pg_10/ |title="Deep lies the sea-longing": inklings of home&nbsp;<U+2014> page 10&nbsp;<U+2014> Mythlore |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2010-02-01 | first=Charles A. | last=Huttar}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>Duriez, pp80, 95</ref> However, unlike such voyages, The Dawn Treader travels East, rather than West.

''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' is the third installment in [[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|''The Chronicles of Narnia'' film series]] from [[Walden Media]]. Unlike the earlier two films, it was distributed by [[20th Century Fox]].  [[Michael Apted]] took over as director from [[Andrew Adamson]], who opted to produce with [[Mark Johnson (producer)|Mark Johnson]], [[Perry Moore]] and [[Douglas Gresham]]. [[Will Poulter]] joined the cast as [[Eustace Scrubb]], while [[Georgie Henley]], [[Skandar Keynes]], [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]], [[Liam Neeson]], and [[Tilda Swinton]] all returned.

== Legacy ==

The song ''Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' by [[Bobby Wynn]] is based on 'The Chronicles of Narnia.'  The spaceship ''Dawn Treader'' in [[Greg Bear]]'s novel ''[[Anvil of Stars]]'' is presumably also named for the ship in this book.

''The Dawntreader'' is the title of a song on [[Joni Mitchell]]'s album [[Song to a Seagull]].
