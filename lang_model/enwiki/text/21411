'''St Julians''' ({{lang-cy|Sain Silian}}) is an electoral district ([[ward (politics)|ward]]) and coterminous [[community (Wales)|community]] of the [[Newport|City of Newport]], [[South Wales]].

The ward is bounded by the [[River Usk]] to the west and north, The Moorings, Badminton Road, Reynolds Close, Rembrandt Way, Constable Drive, Heather Road, Kelly Road, Merlin Crescent, Avalon Drive, across St Julian's Road and Norfolk Road to the east, Christchurch Road, Church Road, Clarence Place and [[Newport Bridge, Newport|Newport Bridge]] to the south. The ward includes the districts of [[Barnardtown]], [[Riverside, Newport|Riverside]], and most of St. Julians (the rest being in [[Beechwood, Newport|Beechwood]] ward).

St Julians has two [[primary school]]s, namely Glan Usk Primary School (formerly Durham Road Infant School and Durham Road Junior School) and St Julians Primary School.  

Glan Usk Primary School moved to new school premises in January 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norwest-holst.co.uk/Latest-Group-News/article9.html|title=Glan Usk Primary School|publisher=VINCI Construction UK Limited}}</ref> The new school has been built on a [[hazardous waste]] [[landfill]] at the Glebelands in the western part of St Julians.  The Glebelands site was operated as a landfill between the 1930s and 1960s such that the waste materials contributed to raising this low lying part of Newport by some three to four metres.  The site received domestic, trade, and industrial wastes including unrecorded amounts of hazardous waste such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s, [[asbestos]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[arsenic]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.  The history of this site and concerns about public health and the wider environment resulted in much opposition and delay to construction of the new primary school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=news.pressrelease&contentid=CONT297284|title=Glan Usk meeting reports positive progress|publisher=Newport City Council}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chepstowfoe.org.uk/glebelands/|title=Chepstow Friends of the Earth: Glebelands|publisher=Chepstow Friends of the Earth}}</ref>  The new school also provides [[nursery school]] places, following the closure of Rockfield Nursery.

St Julians Comprehensive School is the one [[comprehensive school]] in the ward.  
 
All the roads in St Julian's estate are named after famous painters. St Julian's itself is named after Saint [[Julius and Aaron|Julius of Caerleon]], the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] martyr. The [[Anglican]] parish [[church (building)|church]] for St Julian's is dedicated to the martyred Saints of [[Julius and Aaron]] and sits mid-way along Heather Road and the [[Roman Catholic]] church on Beaufort Road is dedicated to St Julius.
