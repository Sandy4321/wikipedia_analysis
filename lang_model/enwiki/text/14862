Written by [[Gene Stupnitsky]] and [[Lee Eisenberg]], and directed by [[Ken Whittingham]], the episode first aired in the United States on March 30, 2006 on [[NBC]]. "Michael's Birthday" was watched by 7.8&nbsp;million viewers and received mostly positive reviews from critics.

In the episode, Michael is disappointed when only Dwight celebrates his birthday. Meanwhile, Kevin spends the day waiting to find out if he has skin cancer.

==Plot==
[[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) is excited to be celebrating his birthday, and tries to get the employees excited with him. Unfortunately for Michael, [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) seems to be the only one joining in; the rest of the employees are more concerned about [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]), who is awaiting his results from his [[skin cancer]] screening. [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) and [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) sneak out to buy gifts for Kevin.

When Michael finds out about Kevin's predicament, he gives Kevin his condolences, but subtly remains bitter that Kevin is ruining his birthday fun. Dwight and [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) are less subtle than they think they are being when discussing their secret relationship within earshot of [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]). After goofing around at the store, Jim and Pam return to the office.

To "make Kevin feel better", Michael takes the employees out ice skating. At the rink, he also runs into his real estate agent [[Characters from The Office (US)#Carol Stills|Carol Stills]] ([[Nancy Walls]]) and her children. He entertains them, which makes Carol smile. Kevin gets the word that his screening results are negative, to the relief of everyone except Michael, who believes that negative means he does have cancer. The gifts are passed out to Kevin and Michael, and the episode ends with Pam recalling that she had fun with Jim and it was a "good day".

==Production==
This episode was the second episode of the series directed by [[Ken Whittingham]]. Whittingham had previously directed the [[The Office (U.S. season 1)|first season]] episode "[[Health Care (The Office)|Health Care]]". "Michael's Birthday" was written by [[Gene Stupnitsky]] and [[Lee Eisenberg]].

The ice skating scenes were shot in an actual rink. According to [[Jenna Fischer]], Steve Carell used to play hockey, and the writers had been looking for a reason to use Carell's ice skating skills in an episode. Fischer had also learned to skate in preparation for the movie ''[[Blades of Glory]]'', but the writers decided that there was no reason for Pam to be a good skater, so they had Pam lean on Jim.<ref name="Fischer">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News-Views/Interviews-Features/Article/default.aspx?posting={F35390A6-2471-4CE3-A248-567B1E3A2664} |title=''The Office'' Celebrates Good Times |accessdate=2008-08-04 |last=Fischer |first=Jenna |coauthors= |date=2006-03-30 |work= |publisher=[[TV Guide]]}}</ref> ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' alumna [[Nancy Walls]], who played Carol Stills, is actually Steve Carell's wife.<ref>Interview: Steve Carell (January 11, 2006).
