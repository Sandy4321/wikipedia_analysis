'''Chicago Vocational Career Academy''', commonly referred to as '''Chicago Vocational''' or '''CVS''', is a [[public high school]] serving students in the south side of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. It opened in 1940.

The school was barely opened when the outbreak of [[World War II]]  caused a change in plan.  The school would be a vocational school, but one under the control of the [[United States Navy]], where many mechanics who would build and repair aircraft, among others, were trained.  After the war, the school was instrumental in helping returning veterans who went off to war prior to graduation to earn their diploma.

The school is also closely associated with a few of its notable alumni, none more so than [[Dick Butkus]] who played football at CVS, and at the [[University of Illinois]], before his Hall of Fame career for the [[Chicago Bears]].  While there is great debate as to who is the greatest athlete in the history of Chicago, no athlete has reached the status of Dick Butkus who can also claim to have played his high school, collegiate, and professional careers all in such proximity to Chicago.

==History==
Planning for the school began in 1936 with the need for a new vocational school on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of the city.<ref>[http://www.cvca.cps.k12.il.us/History%20of%20CVCA.htm ''Local Dream, Worldwide Influence'', History of CVCA; accessed 19 August 2008]</ref>  Construction began in 1939, and was partially funded through the [[Works Progress Administration]].<ref name="cvca.cps.k12.il.us">[http://www.cvca.cps.k12.il.us/History%20of%20CVCA.htm ''Local Dream, Worldwide Influence'', History of CVCA;accessed 19 August 2008]</ref>  '''Chicago Vocational School''' opened with an all&ndash;male class of 850 in 1940.<ref name="cvca.cps.k12.il.us"/><ref>[http://www.nileslibrary.org:2065/pqdweb?index=3&did=466230222&SrchMode=1&sid=1&Fmt=10&VInst=PROD&VType=PQD&RQT=309&VName=HNP&TS=1219149640&clientId=68442 ''New Vocational School will be opened in 1940'', 1 January 1940, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p. 32; accessed 19 August 2008]</ref>  Enrollment was further restricted to students who had already completed a year of high school.<ref name="nileslibrary.org">[http://www.nileslibrary.org:2065/pqdweb?index=8&did=495151122&SrchMode=1&sid=1&Fmt=10&VInst=PROD&VType=PQD&RQT=309&VName=HNP&TS=1219149640&clientId=68442 ''Big New School will Train for Heavy Industry'', 4 August 1940, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p.

Johnson, the school's purpose was "the employability of Chicago boys in the heavier trades and industries."<ref name="nileslibrary.org"/>  The ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' noted that the new school was "regarded as the most modern and best equipped trade school in the United States."<ref name="nileslibrary.org"/>

In June, 1941, with entry into [[World War II]]  imminent, the school was turned over to the [[United States Navy]], where the school's emphasis would be on training aviation mechanics.<ref name="cvca.cps.k12.il.us"/><ref>[http://www.nileslibrary.org:2065/pqdweb?index=18&did=517374002&SrchMode=1&sid=1&Fmt=10&VInst=PROD&VType=PQD&RQT=309&VName=HNP&TS=1219150891&clientId=68442 ''U.S. to Operate New Trade School'', 9 February 1941, Paul Healy, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p.

These defense related training courses permitted the Defense Priority Board to free up funds for purchasing more equipment for workshops, and to build a [[United States dollar|$]]500,000 addition to the building.  Construction also included a still&ndash;extant airplane hangar.<ref name="cvca.cps.k12.il.us"/>

During this time, non&ndash;vocational courses were moved to Calumet High School.<ref name="cvca.cps.k12.il.us"/><ref>[http://www.nileslibrary.org:2065/pqdweb?index=59&did=473252142&SrchMode=1&sid=1&Fmt=10&VInst=PROD&VType=PQD&RQT=309&VName=HNP&TS=1219151612&clientId=68442 ''Open Vocational School Spet. 8 in Westcott Unit'', 12 July 1942, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p.

S6; accessed 19 August 2008]</ref>

February 1946 saw the academic classes return from Calumet High School, and a return to the normalcy that the school had virtually never known, with the Navy officially "handing back the keys" to the school on April 30, 1946.<ref>[http://www.nileslibrary.org:2065/pqdweb?index=244&did=463090102&SrchMode=1&sid=1&Fmt=10&VInst=PROD&VType=PQD&RQT=309&VName=HNP&TS=1219152635&clientId=68442 ''Out of the Navy'', 1 May 1946, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p. 4;  accessed 19 August 2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.nileslibrary.org:2065/pqdweb?index=235&did=479165002&SrchMode=1&sid=1&Fmt=10&VInst=PROD&VType=PQD&RQT=309&VName=HNP&TS=1219152444&clientId=68442 ''School Reopens to Give Civilians Training Center'', 24 February 1946, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p.

The Navy had left behind an aircraft hangar, and a small number of  relatively intact aircraft, keeping aviation maintenance in the school's curriculum for several years.  This was highlighted in 1948 when students managed to restore a [[Stinson Aircraft Company|Stinson]] [[monoplane]] to working condition.  Rather than dismantle the plane and shipping it to an airport, the school received permission to wheel the plane on to nearby Anthony Avenue, and arranged for a pilot to take off and fly it to what is now [[Midway Airport]];  all in front of cameras for [[WGN-TV]].<ref>[http://www.nileslibrary.org:2065/pqdweb?index=62&did=483732132&SrchMode=1&sid=2&Fmt=10&VInst=PROD&VType=PQD&RQT=309&VName=HNP&TS=1219243716&clientId=68442 ''Rebuilt Plane Flown From Pavement at Vocational School'', 17 April, 1948, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p. 12;  accessed 20 August 2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.cvca.cps.k12.il.us/History%20of%20CVCA.htm]</ref><ref>[http://www.cvca.cps.k12.il.us/History%20of%20CVCA.htm ''Welcome Home'', History of CVCA (note: the school website lists 1947, but the reuse of the same photo, and the date on the newspaper articles is definitively 1948; accessed 20 August 2008]</ref>

1958 saw the activation of the school's [[ROTC]] program;  the first to be started in a Chicago high school since 1946.  The same article noted that the entire population of the school was 4,000, with the first ROTC class seeing an enrollment of 250.<ref>[http://www.nileslibrary.org:2065/pqdweb?index=215&did=519045092&SrchMode=1&sid=3&Fmt=10&VInst=PROD&VType=PQD&RQT=309&VName=HNP&TS=1219245383&clientId=68442 ''R.O.T.C. Unit at Vocational Attraacts 250'', 6 March 1958, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p. S1; accessed 20 August 2008]</ref>

==Academics==
When the school first opened, it was not a diploma granting institution, with students earning certificates for industry.  Aside from vocational education, students only took courses in English and United States History,<ref name="nileslibrary.org"/>

Being a vocational and career academy, one of the core aspects of the school's curriculum is the ''Education-To-Careers'' (ETC) curriculum.  Within this curriculum, students select a major from one of the "schools".<ref>[http://www.cvca.cps.k12.il.us/ETC.htm Schools of the Education-To Careers curriculum; accessed 19 August 2008]</ref>

In addition to simple preparation for future occupations, some of the majors offer paid work or an opportunity to take licensing exams upon successful completion of the courses.  For example, the Practical Nursing/Health Occupations offers students an opportunity to take the [[Licensed practical nurse|L.P.N.]] certification test.<ref>[http://www.cvca.cps.k12.il.us/HOAPCluster.htm School of Health Occupations; accessed 19 August 2008]</ref>  Students majoring in Diesel Technology who acquire 600 hours of experience work in a salaried position for one semester.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>  The Network Fundamentals major leads to a chance to be [[Cisco Networking Academy|certified]] in [[CISCO]] networking.<ref>[http://www.cvca.cps.k12.il.us/BusinessandFinance.htm School of Business and Finance; accessed 20 August 2008]</ref>
