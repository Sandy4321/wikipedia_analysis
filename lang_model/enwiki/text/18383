The '''''University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law''''' ([[Bluebook]] abbreviation: U. Pa. J. Int'l L.) is a [[Law review|scholarly journal]] focusing on issues of [[international law]], [[international relations]], [[transnational law]] and [[comparative law]]. The ''Journal'' is published quarterly by an organization of second and third year [[Juris Doctor|law students]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].  The journal is one of five major scholarly journals at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and one of the top twenty international law journals in the [[United States]]  based on citations and impact.<ref>http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx</ref>

==History==
The journal was established in 1978 as the ''Journal of Comparative Business and Capital Market Law''. The name of the journal was changed to ''University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Business Law'' in 1986 and then to ''University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Economic Law'' in 1996. In 2007, the journal broadened its scope and merged with the then unofficial ''Journal of International Law and Policy'', becoming the ''University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law''. It now publishes articles on [[public law|public]] and [[private law|private]] [[international law|international]], [[comparative law|comparative]], foreign, and [[transnational law]].

==Selection==
Positions on the journal are filled based in part on students' grades during first year of law school and in part on students' performance during a writing competition conducted at the end of each school year. The writing competition has two major parts: an editing portion and a writing portion. During the 20-hour editing portion, contestants are required to correct a sample portion of a fake law review article prepared by the current board. Contestants have at their disposal a copy of the Bluebook and a packet of source materials provided by the journal. During the writing portion, contestants are required to create a cohesive, thesis-driven essay using only these source materials. The sources cover a variety of topics, and the essay does not need to be law-related.

==Symposia==
Each winter the ''University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law'' hosts a symposium focusing on popular topics in international legal scholarship chosen by the Symposium Editors and features scholars of the [[law]] and related fields. Symposium speakers are invited to publish their work in the journal's annual symposium issue. Some recent topics include "Afro-Descendants and Indigenous Peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean: Legal Rights and Realities" (February 5, 2010)<ref name=2010symp>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jil/panelists2010.html |title=The Journal of International Law - ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM AFRO-DESCENDANTS AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN: LEGAL RIGHTS AND REALITIES |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> and "The Human Market: International Commoditization and Allocation of the Human Body" (February 13, 2009).<ref name=2009symp>{{cite web |url=http://www.pennjil.com/symposium.html |title=The Journal of International Law - 2009 Symposium |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref>
