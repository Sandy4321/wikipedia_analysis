'''The Princess Victoria, Princess Royal''' (Victoria Adelaide Mary Louisa; 21 November 1840 &ndash; 5 August 1901) was the eldest child and daughter of [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. She was created '''[[Princess Royal]]''' of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1841. She became [[German Empire|German Empress]] and [[Queen of Prussia]] by marriage to [[Frederick III, German Emperor|German Emperor Frederick III]]. After her husband's death, she became widely known as '''Empress Frederick''' (or, in German: "Kaiserin Friedrich").

==Early life==
[[File:His Royal Highness Prince Albert, the Princess Royal, and Eos.jpg|thumb|left|Victoria with her father, Albert]]

Princess Victoria was born on 21 November 1840 at [[Buckingham Palace]], [[London]]. Her mother was the reigning [[British monarch]], [[Queen Victoria]], the only daughter of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]'s fourth eldest son, [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]] and [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]]. Her father was [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. She was baptised in the Throne Room of Buckingham Palace on 10 February 1841 by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[William Howley]]. Her godparents were her grand-aunt in law [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]], her grand-uncle King [[Leopold I of Belgium]], her paternal grandfather [[Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (for whom [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|The Duke of Wellington]], [[Leaders of the Conservative Party|Tory Leader in the Lords]], stood proxy), her maternal grand-uncle [[Prince Augustus, Duke of Sussex|The Duke of Sussex]], her maternal grand-aunt [[Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester|The Duchess of Gloucester]] and her maternal grandmother [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|The Duchess of Kent]].<ref>[http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings Yvonne's Royalty Home Page: Royal Christenings]</ref>

As a daughter of the sovereign, Victoria was automatically a [[British princess]] with the style [[Royal Highness|''Her Royal Highness'']], styled ''HRH The Princess Victoria'' (and in addition being [[heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]] to the throne of the United Kingdom before the birth of her younger brother Prince Albert, later [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] on 9 November 1841). In 1841, the Queen created Victoria [[Princess Royal]], giving her an honorary title sometimes conferred on the eldest daughter of the sovereign. Victoria was then styled ''HRH The Princess Royal''. To her family she was known simply as ''Vicky''.

The education of Victoria was closely supervised by her parents. She was precocious and intelligent, unlike her brother Albert Edward. She was taught to read and write before the age of five by her governess Lady Lyttelton and to speak French by her French nursery maid. The Princess Royal learned French and German from various governesses, and science, literature, Latin, and history from Sara Ann Hildyard. Prince Albert tutored her in politics and philosophy.

==Marriage==
*''See also: [[Wedding dress of Princess Victoria, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom|Wedding dress of Princess Victoria, Princess Royal]]
In 1851, Victoria met her future husband, [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Prince Frederick William of Prussia]] (18 October 1831 <U+2013> 15 June 1888), when he and his parents were invited to London by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to attend the opening of the [[Great Exhibition of 1851|Great Exhibition]]. At the time, Frederick, the son of [[William I, German Emperor|Prince William of Prussia]] and Princess [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar]], was second in line to the Prussian throne (after his father). The couple became engaged in 1855 while Frederick was on a visit to [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]]; Victoria was just fourteen, while her future husband was a young man of twenty-four.

The Prussian Court and Buckingham Palace publicly announced the engagement on 19 May 1857. Seventeen-year-old Victoria married Frederick, at Queen Victoria's insistence, at the [[Chapel Royal]], [[St. James's Palace]], on 25 January 1858. The marriage was both a love match and a dynastic alliance. The Queen and Prince Albert hoped that Victoria's marriage to the future king of Prussia would cement close ties between London and [[Berlin]], and possibly lead to the emergence of a unified and liberal Germany. At the time of their wedding, Londoners chanted "God save the Prince and Bride! God keep their lands allied!"

==Crown Princess of Prussia==

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Vicky4.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Victoria with her eldest son, [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm]] and his younger brother, [[Prince Albert Wilhelm Heinrich of Prussia|Heinrich]].]] -->
In January 1861, on the death of his childless uncle [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] and the accession of his father as King William I, Prince Frederick became '''Crown Prince of Prussia''', Victoria therefore became '''Crown Princess'''. The new Crown Prince and Crown Princess, however, were politically isolated; their liberal and Anglophile views clashed with the authoritarian rule of the Prussian minister-president, [[Otto von Bismarck]]. Unfortunately, despite their efforts to educate their son, Wilhelm, in British attitudes of democracy, he favoured his German tutors in aspiring to autocratic rule and thus became alienated from his parents, suspecting them of putting Britain's interests first.

During the three Wars of [[German Unification]] &ndash; the 1864 [[Second Schleswig War|Prussian-Danish War]], the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]], and the 1870<U+2013>71 [[Franco-Prussian War]] &ndash; Victoria and Frederick strongly identified with the cause of Prussia and the [[North German Confederation]]. Their sympathies created a rift among Queen Victoria's extended family, since Victoria's younger brother, the Prince of Wales, was married to Princess [[Alexandra of Denmark]], the elder daughter of [[Christian IX of Denmark]], who was also reigning duke of the [[disputed territories]] of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. At [[Versailles]] on 18 January 1871, the victorious princes of the North German Confederation proclaimed a [[German Empire]] with King William I of Prussia as the hereditary German Emperor (''Deutscher Kaiser'') with the style ''Imperial and Royal Majesty (Kaiserliche und K<U+00F6>nigliche Majest<U+00E4>t)''; Frederick  and Victoria became German Crown Prince and German Crown Princess with the style ''Imperial and Royal Highness (Kaiserliche und K<U+00F6>nigliche Hoheit)''.

==German Empress & Empress Frederick==

On the death of his father on 9 March 1888, the Crown Prince ascended the throne as the Emperor Frederick III (and as King Frederick III of Prussia) and Victoria adopted the title and style of ''Her Imperial and Royal Majesty'' '''The German Empress''', '''Queen of Prussia'''. Frederick, however, was terminally ill with throat cancer and died after reigning 99 days. From then on she was known simply as ''Her Imperial Majesty'' '''The Empress Frederick.'''<ref name="hansard">{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |house=House of Lords |date=1901-08-08 |speaker=[[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|The Marquess of Salisbury]] |position=Prime Minister and Lord Privy Seal |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1901/aug/08/death-of-her-imperial-majesty-the |author=The Marquess of Sallisbury |work=column_start=6 |column_end=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Her Imperial Majesty, The Empress Frederick, soon after Kaiser Frederick's death. |url=http://www.barnardf.demon.co.uk/Letters/EmpressF.htm |publisher=barnardf.demon.co.uk |work=1888 letters |accessdate=2011-05-30}}</ref>

She was often known as ''Die Engl<U+00E4>nderin'' (the Englishwoman) due to her origins in the United Kingdom, even though her ancestry was predominantly German. Indeed, she continued to speak English in her German household.

The widowed Victoria lived in retirement at [[Schlosshotel Kronberg|Castle Friedrichshof]], a castle she had built in memory of her late husband in the hills near [[Kronberg]] not far from [[Frankfurt am Main]]. Politically, she remained a liberal in contrast with her son Emperor [[William II, German Emperor|William II]]. Their relationship had earlier been difficult but improved once she was no longer in the limelight. In Berlin, Victoria established schools for the [[higher education of girls]] and for nurses' training. As a talented and gifted artist in her own right, she was a patron of the arts and learning, becoming one of the organizers of the [[1872 Industrial Art Exhibition]].

Throughout her married life and widowhood, Victoria kept in close touch with other members of the [[British Royal Family]], particularly her younger brother, the future King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]].

She maintained a regular correspondence with her mother. According to the ''[[Royal Encyclopaedia]]'', some 3,777 letters from [[Queen Victoria]] to her eldest daughter have been catalogued, as well as more than 4,000 from daughter to mother. Many of her letters detailed her concern over [[Germany]]'s future under her son. At her request <U+2013> in which she made explicit her concern that the letters, which she had had sent back to herself at Kronberg,<ref>'The fact that she should have sent for these letters, looked through them, deleted passages, and finally have them sent back to England seems to point to her having contemplated their publication.' ''Letters of the Empress Frederick'' edited by Sir Frederick Ponsonby, London, Macmillan, 1928, p. xvi.</ref> should not fall into the hands of her son William II and that he should not know what had happened to them <U+2013> the letters were brought back to England in a [[cloak and dagger|cloak-and-dagger]] operation by [[Frederick Ponsonby, 1st Baron Sysonby|Frederick Ponsonby]], her godson, the private secretary of Edward VII, who was making his (Edward's) final visit to his terminally ill sister in Kronberg for a week up to 1 March 1901. These letters were later edited by Ponsonby and put into context by his background commentary to form the book that was published in 1928.<ref>The 'cloak-and-dagger operation', Ponsonby's position as her godson, and the background to his decision to publish the letters are described in ''Letters of the Empress Frederick'' on pp. ix<U+2013>xix.</ref>

Victoria was diagnosed with inoperable [[breast cancer]] in 1899 during a visit to her mother at [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]]. By the autumn of 1900, the cancer spread to her spine and after much suffering, she died at Castle Friedrichshof on 5<U+00A0>August<U+00A0>1901, less than seven months after the death of her mother, [[Queen Victoria]]. She was buried in the royal mausoleum of the [[Church of Peace (Sanssouci)|Friedenskirche]] at [[Potsdam]] on 13<U+00A0>August<U+00A0>1901. Her tomb has a recumbent marble effigy of herself on top. Next to her lies her beloved husband. Two of her eight children, Sigismund (died age 2) and Waldemar (died age 11), are buried in the same mausoleum.

==Portrayal in film and television==
She has been portrayed in a number of film and television productions since her death. Perhaps the most notable was in 1975 when [[Felicity Kendal]] played Vicky in [[Edward the Seventh]], including the scenes during her final months when the character was 60 years but Kendal was only in her 29th year.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0447555/]</ref> Other portrayals include [[Gemma Jones]] ([[Fall of Eagles]], 1974), [[Wendy Hiller]] ([[Lord Mountbatten: The Last Viceroy]], 1986) and [[Catherine Punch]] ([[Bismarck]], 1990).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0109383/]</ref>

===Arms===
With her style of Princess Royal, Victoria was granted use of the royal arms, as then used: with an escutcheon of the shield of Saxony, the whole differenced by a label argent of three points, the outer points bearing crosses gules, the central a rose gules.<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm Heraldica <U+2013> British Royalty Cadency]. In 1917, the escutcheon was dropped by royal warrant from [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]. Of course Victoria had died in 1901 and the arms had not been used by her since her marriage to Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia, later German Emperor Friedrich III.</ref>
