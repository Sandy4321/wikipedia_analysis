===Early life===
Rodriguez was born in [[Bexar County]], Texas, the daughter of Carmen Milady ([[married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Pared), a native of the [[Dominican Republic]], and Rafael Rodriguez, a [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]] who served in the [[United States|U.S. Army]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Michelle Rodriguez Biography (1978-)|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/14/Michelle-Rodriguez.html|accessdate=2007-12-25|publisher=Film Reference}}</ref> She has a total of ten half-siblings or siblings. She was partly raised by her devoutly religious maternal grandmother and was brought up in her mother's [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] religion, though she has since abandoned that specific faith.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michelle Rodriguez: in role after role, she has kicked the stereotype of the token female in the teeth, leaving an imprint all her own.|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_8_33/ai_106914962|accessdate=2007-12-25|month=September | year=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Religious Affiliation of Actress Michelle Rodriguez|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pr/Michelle_Rodriguez.html|publisher=World Religions|accessdate=2007-12-25|date=2005-08-11}}</ref> Rodriguez moved to the [[Dominican Republic]] with her mother when she was eight and lived in [[Puerto Rico]] when she was 11, later settling in [[Union City]], [[New Jersey]].

===Career ===
Having run across an ad for an open casting call and attending her first audition, Rodriguez beat 350 other applicants to win her first role in the low-budget 2000 [[independent film]], ''[[Girlfight]].'' Rodriguez's performance as Diana Guzman, a troubled teen who decides to channel her aggression by training to become a [[Women's boxing|boxer]], was recognized by both critics and audiences, but despite major industry buzz of a possible [[Academy Award]] nomination, she did not receive the Oscar nod.<ref>[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/3443 A Conversation About "Girlfight"; October 27, 2000]</ref> Rodriguez did however accumulate several other significant awards and nominations for the role in independent circles, including major acting accolades from the [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|National Board of Review]], [[Deauville American Film Festival|Deauville Film Festival]], [[Independent Spirit Awards]], [[Gotham Awards]], [[Las Vegas Film Critics Society|Las Vegas Film Critics Sierra Awards]], and many others. The film itself took home top prizes at both the [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] and [[Cannes Film Festival]]s.

Subsequently, she has had notable roles in other successful movies, including ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'', ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'', ''[[Blue Crush]]'', and ''[[S.W.A.T. (film)|S.W.A.T.]]'' In 2004, Rodriguez lent her voice to the video game ''[[Halo 2]],'' playing a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]].

In early 2000, Rodriguez broke off a near engagement to a [[Muslim]] boyfriend, citing opposition to religious requirements he demanded of her, which included covering herself completely.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rodriguez Turned Down Muslim Marriage|url=http://www.cinema.com/news/item/3790/rodriguez-turned-down-muslim-marriage.phtml|date=2008-06-06}}</ref> Around 2001, Rodriguez dated her ''The Fast and the Furious'' co-star, [[Vin Diesel]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Susan |last=Wloszczyna |title=Vin Diesel, in high gear |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/2002-08-06-vin-diesel_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company|Gannett]] |date=2002-08-06 |accessdate=2007-02-04 }}</ref> In 2003, Rodriguez was photographed sharing a kiss with [[Kylie Minogue]]'s boyfriend [[Olivier Martinez]] and the two were later spotted partying together on [[Puff Daddy]]'s yacht in the south of France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/minogues%20martinez%20linked%20to%20rodriguez|title=Minogue's Martinez linked to Rodriguez|publisher=Contact Music|accessdate=2005-03-03|date=2008-05-02}}</ref>

In early 2007, Rodriguez was again photographed with Olivier Martinez.

When asked by ''Latina'' Magazine in April 2008 about the constant questions and speculation surrounding her sexuality, Rodriguez responded, "I don't answer those questions.

In September 2007 however, Rodriguez allegedly violated her probation by not completing her community service and not following an alcohol education program. It was reported that Rodriguez originally submitted a document stating she performed community service on September 5, 2006, but it was later confirmed she was actually in New York City that day.
