'''Kobler Field''' is a former [[World War II]] airfield on [[Saipan]] in the [[Mariana Islands]].  It was closed in 1977 and is currently unused.

==History==
===World War II===
Kobler Field was constructed in August-October 1944 near [[Aslito]] on the Southern end of Saipan as a base for [[Twentieth Air Force]] [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortresses]] to carry out the strategic bombing campaign against the Japanese Home Islands. The facility had a 200<U+2019> x 8500<U+2019> runway, repair and maintenance facilities, and hardstands for 120 aircraft. The airfield was named after Lt. Wayne F. Kobler, a [[19th Fighter Squadron]] pilot who was killed on 27 June 1944 while flying his [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] on a low level attack mission on [[Tinian]].<ref>{{Cite book| title=73rd Bomb Wing An Illustrated History| publisher=Turner Publishing Company| year=2000| isbn=9781563116025|page=19}}</ref>

As [[Isely Field]], [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field]], and [[Tinian International Airport|West Field]] on Tinian became operational, Kobler Field was increasingly used by the Twentieth Air Force as an auxiliary field for storage and basing of miscellaneous aircraft.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rottman|first=Gordon |title=Saipan & Tinian 1944| publisher=Osprey Publishing| year=2004| isbn=1841768049|page=89}}</ref>

A [[LORAN]] station was established at the end of Kobler Field in November 1944, which the [[United States Coast Guard]] continued to operate until January 1978.

The [[819th Bombardment Squadron]] flying [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberators]] deployed to Kobler Field in August 1944 to undertake attacks on Japanese islands and shipping.

On 22 June 1945, following a raid on [[Kure Naval Arsenal]], a B-29 crashed at Kobler Field while attempting to land on two engines.

===Postwar===
In the postwar era, Kobler Field was transferred to [[US Navy]] administration and remained under US Navy control until placed out of service in the early 1960s. [[VF-133|VF-13A]] flying [[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U-4s]] operated from Kobler Field from 1946 into 1947.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Enlisted Naval Aviation Pilots| publisher=Turner Publishing Company| year=2002| isbn=9781563111105|page=191}}</ref> [[VA-12]] was shore-based at NAB Kobler Field from 21 August<U+2013>19 September and November<U+2013>December 1946.[[VFA-14|VA-1A]] was shore-based at NAB Kobler Field from 28 December 1946 until 9 January 1947. Carrier Aircraft Service Unit (CASU) 47 was also based at NAB Kobler Field.

On 16 May 1968, [[Continental Micronesia]]'s first commercial flight, a [[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-100]] jet known as ''Ju Ju'', took off from Kobler Field to [[Honolulu International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpa.gov.mp/newsitm.asp?newsID=770|title=Continental Micronesia marks 40th year with simple ceremony|publisher=Commonweath Ports Authority|date=17 May 2008|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>Kobler Field operated as the main airfield on Saipan until 25 July 1976, when operations were moved to [[Saipan International Airport]].

==Current status==
Following its closure, Kobler Field was redeveloped as Koblerville, a residential housing area. The runway is now Koblerville Road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=98875&cat=3|title=A different time and place|publisher=Saipan Tribune|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>
