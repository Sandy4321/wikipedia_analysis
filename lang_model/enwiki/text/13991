'''Thomas Albert Tabart''' (10 August 1877, [[Campbell Town, Tasmania]] <U+2013> 29 August 1950, [[East Melbourne, Victoria]]), was a [[cricket]]er who played [[first-class cricket]] for [[Tasmania cricket team|Tasmania]] from 1897 until 1909.

Tabart made his first-class debut in 1896-97. He played his first innings of note in 1902-03 when he batted at number six and top-scored with 43 in Tasmania's second innings against [[Victoria cricket team|Victoria]] at the [[MCG]]. Tasmania won by 57 runs.<ref>[http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/6/6126.html Victoria v Tasmania 1902-03]</ref>

Against [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] in [[Hobart]] in 1904-05 he made Tasmania's top score in the match when he scored 48 in the second innings, adding 83 for the first wicket with Ossie Douglas and giving [[Charles Eady]] and [[Edward Windsor (cricketer)| Edward Windsor]] the chance to bowl New South Wales out for another Tasmanian victory.<ref>[http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/6/6655.html Tasmania v New South Wales 1904-05]</ref>

His best performances came in two matches against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] in January 1907-08 as an opening batsman. In the first match, in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], he top-scored in the first innings with 57, and took three wickets in the MCC first innings, including that of [[Jack Hobbs]], Tabart's second wicket in first-class cricket.<ref>[http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7493.html Tasmania v MCC, Launceston 1907-08]</ref> In the second match, in Hobart a few days later, he made his only other first-class fifty, 55 in the second innings, to help Tasmania hold out for a draw.<ref>[http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7495.html Tasmania v MCC, Hobart 1907-08]</ref>

He captained Tasmania in his final first-class match, against Victoria in Hobart in 1908-09, scoring 22 and 38 in a match that Victoria won by four wickets.<ref>[http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7772.html Tasmania v Victoria 1908-09]</ref>

He played regularly in the biannual intra-state matches in Tasmania between North and South: for the South team from 1896-97 to 1897-98, for North in 1902-03, and for South again from 1903-04 to 1908-09, captaining South in his last match.<ref>[http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/2/2737/Miscellaneous_Matches.html Miscellaneous matches played by Tom Tabart]</ref> In the 1903-04 match in Hobart he scored 130 in the second innings and took five catches in the match.<ref>[http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/179/179422.html South v North 1903-04]</ref>

Although he did not meet the stated criteria for notability, his date of birth (given as 1879) appeared in the Births and Deaths section of ''[[Wisden]]'' until the 1974 edition; his death was never acknowledged.<ref>''Wisden'' 1974, p. 1064, ''Wisden'' 1975, p. 1064.</ref>

His uncle, [[John Tabart]], played for Tasmania in what is now considered to be the first first-class cricket match in Australia, in 1850-51.
