The '''River Wandle''' is a [[river]] in south-east [[England]]. The names of the river and of Wandsworth are thought to have derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''"Wendlesworth"'' meaning ''"Wendle's Settlement"''.  The river runs through southwest [[London]] and is about {{convert|9|mi|km}} long. It passes through the [[London Boroughs]] of [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]], [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]],  [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], and [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]] to join the [[River Thames]] on the [[Tideway]] at [[Wandsworth]].  Much of the River is accessible using the [[Wandle Trail]].

Rain falls on the [[North Downs]], filters through the chalk and emerges on the [[spring line village|spring line]].  At the top of the catchment the river is mostly culverted.  The river is first visible at [[Wandle Park]] in Croydon where it flows briefly [[culvert]]ed into [[Waddon]] Ponds beside Mill Lane.  A second main source, also at about 115&nbsp;ft (38 yd, 35 m) [[Above Ordnance Datum|AOD]] is formed at [[Carshalton]] Ponds, which merges underneath Watermill House in the northern area of Carshalton, ''The Wrythe''.

Other sources include the Norbury Brook/River Graveney tributary which rises near the Lower Addiscombe Road in Croydon and flows through the [[London Boroughs]] of [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]], [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] and [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]].  Two seasonal streams, the Coulsdon Bourne and the Caterham Bourne, run in wet winters.  They join together at Purley, run in a culvert north along the Brighton Road and join the River Wandle at the site of the, now defunct, Swan and Sugarloaf pub in South Croydon.

==Flow==

In the late [[pleistocene]], the river probably sprang from the north of the [[Vale of Holmesdale]] across the [[North Downs]] through the [[Merstham]] Gap, a [[wind gap (topography)|wind gap]].<ref>[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/geodiversity/englands/counties/area_ID34.aspx Natural England - Geodiversity]</ref> In more recent times, rainwater falling on the Down percolates through the chalk and reappears as springs in central Croydon, Beddington, and Carshalton. The occasional stream, known as the Bourne, which runs through the [[Caterham]] valley (and [[Smitham]] Bottom in [[Coulsdon]]) is a source of the River Wandle but only surfaces after heavy rainfall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43062 |title=Parishes: Caterham |author=H.E. Malden (editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1912 |work=A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 4 |accessdate=23 November 2012 }}</ref> A series of ditches and culverts channels the water from [[Purley, London|Purley]] to [[Croydon]].

For many centuries the River Wandle rose from a spring near the Swan and Sugarloaf public house on Brighton Road, (now closed, but the building remains as a "Supermarket") flowing through the Haling neighbourhood of [[Croydon]]. It ran northwards along Southbridge Road and upon reaching Old Town it was {{convert|20|ft|abbr=on}} across and began to divide into smaller channels. The grounds of the Old Palace and Scarbrook Hill had several springs, ponds, streams and canals where fish swam, especially trout. However, as Croydon's population grew and use of the [[water closet]] increased, the Old Town streams became little more than open sewers and were filled in or culverted from 1840 after outbreaks of [[typhoid]] and [[cholera]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43053 |title=Croydon: Introduction and Croydon Palace |author=H.E. Malden (editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1912 |work=A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 4 |accessdate=23 November 2012 }}</ref>

The river then flowed through Pitlake and on through two marshy fields <U+2014> Froggs Mead and Stubbs Mead <U+2014> drained to form [[Wandle Park]] in 1890. Local springs were used to form a boating lake in the park, but frequent drying up problems led to the lake being filled in and the river was [[culvert]]ed in 1967; however, in 2012, the Wandle was restored to the surface in Wandle Park.  The Wandle then continues underground, through where the gas works used to stand, under the [[Purley Way]] road past [[Waddon|Waddon Ponds]] and appears on the surface at the road ''Richmond Green'' where a small [[buffer zone|green buffer]] to its south acts as the green after the footpath at the end of ''Mill Lane'' in Waddon, [[Croydon]].<ref>[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/mapsearch.aspx [[Ordnance Survey]] map, courtesy of [[English Heritage]]]</ref>

A [[tributary]] starts in [[Thornton Heath]] as the [[Norbury Brook]]. This flows north then west to become the [[River Graveney]] and joins the Wandle near Summerstown.

For part of its length, the Wandle forms the boundary between the London Boroughs of Croydon and [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] and, further downstream, the border between [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] and [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]] <U+2013> from 1900 to 1963 the official boundary between Surrey and London.

'Village' names in the Wandle basin include: [[Croydon]], [[Waddon]], [[Beddington]], [[Wallington, London|Wallington]], [[Carshalton]], [[The Wrythe]], [[Hackbridge]], [[Mitcham]], Ravensbury, [[St. Helier, London|St Helier]], [[Morden]], [[Merton Abbey, London|Merton Abbey]], [[Colliers Wood]], [[South Wimbledon]], [[Summerstown, London|Summerstown]], and [[Wandsworth]].

==Use of river==
[[Image:Wandle8.jpg|right|thumb|240px|River Wandle in Wandsworth Town Centre]]The river has been well-used since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times and was heavily [[industry|industrialised]] in the 17th and 18th centuries (the [[industrial revolution]]), and was declared one of the most [[pollution|polluted]] rivers in England.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The main industries then were [[tobacco]] and [[textiles]].  The river was used to power 68 [[water wheel]]s, of which only a few survive, such as at Merton Abbey Mills.<ref>{{cite book|title=The London Encyclopaedia|edition=1991|editors=Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert|publisher=Macmillan|page=947|ISBN=0-333-57688-8}} Retrieved 29 August 2013.</ref>

The [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]] print works and Merton Board Mills once dominated the riverscape in what is now the London Borough of Merton. The concentration of heavy industry in this area resulted in the stretch of the river running between Windsor Avenue and Colliers Wood High Street being diverted during the 18th century. The original course of the river still runs underground beneath Liberty Avenue, surfacing at Runnymede as the Pickle Ditch and rejoining the modern river outside Sainsbury's, while the stretch of the river running past [[Merton Abbey Mills]] craft village and in front of Sainsbury's is man-made.

Subsequent cleanups of the Wandle have improved the water quality dramatically, leading to a return of the river's once famous [[brown trout]]. This improvement in water quality has also seen other fish thrive with stocks of [[European chub|Chub]], [[Common Roach|Roach]] and [[European perch|Perch]] all flourishing once again with the most popular angling spots situated on the river at [[Colliers Wood]].

==Local Nature Reserves==
A stretch of the river between Trewint Street and Plough Lane in Merton has been designated as the Lower Wandle [[Local Nature Reserve]] (LNR). It is lined by mature trees and patches of grassland.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=0&N=&ID=1377|title= Lower Wandle| date = 5 March 2013|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England|accessdate= 20 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&activelayer=lnrIndex&query=REF_CODE%3D%271083011%27|title=Map of Lower Wandle|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England|accessdate= 20 December 2013}}</ref> South of the Lower Wandle, an area of wetland between the River Wandle and the Wandle trail is the Wandle Meadow Nature Park LNR.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=0&N=WANDLE&ID=650 |title= Wandle Meadow Nature Park|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England|accessdate= 20 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&activelayer=lnrIndex&query=REF_CODE%3D%271009355%27|title=Map of Wandle Meadow Nature Park|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England|accessdate= 20 December 2013}}</ref> Another LNR adjacent to the Wandle is the [[Wandle Valley Wetland]] in Carshalton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=0&N=WANDLE&ID=1030 |title=Wandle Valley Wetland |series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England|accessdate= 20 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&activelayer=lnrIndex&query=REF_CODE%3D%271083012%27|title=Map of Wandle Valley Wetland|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England|accessdate= 20 December 2013}}</ref>

==Incidents==
On 17 September 2007, a chemical was accidentally flushed into the Wandle from [[Thames Water]]'s Beddington sewage works. This resulted in over 2,000 fish of various species being killed. The company assumed responsibility for the mistake, and said they were "mortified" by the incident. The company failed to notify the [[Environment Agency]] of the discharge, as the site manager thought it was minor.  [[Sodium hypochlorite]] was being used to clean its tertiary treatment screens, but instead of being circulated back through the treatment works, it was accidentally discharged into the river. The company immediately offered to meet local angling clubs and the [http://www.wandletrust.org Wandle Trust] to discuss restocking and long term support for the work of the Trust.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.24dash.com/environment/27818.htm |title=Thames Water 'mortified' after 2,000 fish die in River Wandle <U+00BB> Environment |publisher=24dash.com |date=2007-09-21 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref>

The company was fined <U+00A3>125,000 for the incident on 26 January 2009, with costs of <U+00A3>21,335.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/news/102385.aspx |title=Environment Agency press release |publisher=Environment-agency.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> This is thought to be the greatest ever penalty for a single offence of polluting controlled waters. However in February 2010, on appeal, the fine was found to be "manifestly excessive" and was reduced to <U+00A3>50,000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8524109.stm Thames Water fine for toxic spill in River Wandle cut] BBC News, 15 February 2010</ref>

==Makeup==
The predominant [[geology]] of the area is [[chalk]] and [[London clay]].

The river is heavily managed with artificial channels, runoff ditches and a few underground stretches.

==Namesakes==
The [[Wandle River]] in [[South Island]], New Zealand is named after the River Wandle.

There have been at least four steamships named [[SS Wandle (1932)|SS ''Wandle'']], three of which were built for the local [[Wandsworth and District Gas Company|Wandsworth, Wimbledon and Epsom District Gas Company]].

In the 1980s, Wandle was the name of one of the districts into which the operation of [[Buses in London|London's buses]] was divided, and named after the river.  Its logo was a water wheel above the [[London Transport (brand)|London Transport roundel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eplates.info/maps/areas.html |title=London Transport - Local Bus Maps |publisher=eplates.info | accessdate=27 August 2013}}</ref>

==Landmarks==

[[Wimbledon Stadium]] and the [[Young's|Ram Brewery]] are both situated on the banks of the Wandle, as was the now-defunct [[Plough Lane]] stadium.
