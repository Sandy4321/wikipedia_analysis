'''State Route 527''' (SR&nbsp;527, also known as the '''Bothell&nbsp;&ndash; Everett Highway'''<ref name="bothell-everett">{{cite news |title=WSDOT Detours Bothell&nbsp;&ndash; Everett Highway Near Silver Lake This Weekend |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/News/2005/04/Apr_25_05_SR527Detour.htm |publisher=[[Washington State Department of Transportation]] |date=2005-04-27 |accessdate=2008-10-07}}</ref>) is a state highway in [[King County, Washington|King]] and [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish]] counties, of the U.S. state of [[Washington]]. It extends {{convert|11.92|mi|km|2}} from [[Washington State Route 522|SR&nbsp;522]] in the city of [[Bothell, Washington]], north to an interchange with [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] (I-5), [[Washington State Route 99|SR&nbsp;99]], and [[Washington State Route 526|SR&nbsp;526]] in [[Everett, Washington]]. SR&nbsp;527 intersects [[Interstate 405 (Washington)|I-405]], [[Washington State Route 524|SR&nbsp;524]], and [[Washington State Route 96|SR&nbsp;96]] before ending in Everett. The route serves as a connector between Bothell, Everett, and [[Mill Creek, Washington|Mill Creek]].

The highway itself did not fully open until October 17, 1969, and since its opening, it has become increasingly busy, with about 57,000 motorists using the highway at its interchange with I-405 in 2004. A large construction project that started in 1991, ended in 2006 after widening the highway and put up [[sound wall]]s along the highway.
