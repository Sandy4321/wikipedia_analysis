Founded in 1989, FSS uses biometric scanning technology to provide services for educational and institutional foodservice providers. The company has established a position of market leadership <ref name="CBS News Fingerprints Pay for Lunch">{{cite news | title=CBS News | work=Fingerprints Pay For School Lunch | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/01/24/national/main266789.shtml | accessdate=November 18, 2007 | date=January 24, 2001}}</ref> addressing two problems in school-based foodservice operations. The first is that school children eligible for free or reduce-fee lunches through government assistance programs often fail to participate because of the perceived social stigma associated with showing a special card or meal ticket in front of other students. The second is that in the foodservice POS industry, software has historically been proprietary, cumbersome for clients to self-administer, and difficult to integrate with other technologies.

FSS also has a webservice, www.myschoolaccount.com where parents can view what their child has been eating, what their lunch account balance is and also make payments with their credit card or checking/savings account.<ref name="Touch Love in the School Lunch Line">{{cite web | title=find Biometrics | work=Tough Love in the School Cafeteria Lunch Line | url=http://www.findbiometrics.com/press-release/4228 | accessdate=November 18, 2007 }}</ref>
