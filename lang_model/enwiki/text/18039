{{Otherships|HMS Kestrel}}
'''HMS ''Kestrel''''' was a Clydebank-built three funnelled 30-knot [[destroyer]] ordered by the Royal Navy under the 1895 <U+2013> 1896 Naval Estimates.  She was the fourth ship to carry this name since it was first used in 1846 for a brigantine.<ref name="Jane-p84-85">{{cite book|last=Jane|first=Fred T.|title=Jane<U+2019>s All The Worlds Fighting Ships 1898|origyear=1898, Sampson Low Marston, London |date= |publisher=ARCO Publishing Company|location=New York|pages=84- 85}}</ref><ref name="Jane-p76">{{cite book|last=Jane|first=Fred T.|title=Jane<U+2019>s Fighting Ships of World War I|year=1990|publisher=Jane<U+2019>s Publishing |origyear=1919|isbn=1 85170 378 0|page=76}}</ref>

In 1913 she was grouped with similar vessels as a [[C class destroyer (1913)|C-class destroyer]].

==Construction==
She was laid down as Yard Number 298 on 2 September 1896 at [[John Brown & Company|J & G Thompson]] shipyard in [[Clydebank]] and launched on 25 March 1898.  During her builder<U+2019>s trials she made her contract speed of 30 knots.  In 1899 during the construction of these ships, steelmaker John Brown and Company of Sheffield bought J&G Thomson's Clydebank yard.  She was completed and accepted by the Royal Navy in April of 1900.<ref name="Jane-p84-85" /><ref name="Jane-p76" />

==Pre-War==
After commissioning she was assigned to the Chatham Division of the [[Harwich Flotilla]].  She was deployed in Home waters for her entire service life.

On 30 August 1912 the Admiralty directed all destroyer classes were to be designated by letters.  Since her design speed was 30-knots and she had three funnels she was assigned to the C Class.  After 30 September 1913, she was known as an C Class destroyer and had the letter <U+2018>C<U+2019> painted on the hull below the bridge area and on either the fore or aft funnel.<ref>{{cite book|title=Conway<U+2019>s All the World<U+2019>s Fighting Ships 1906 to 1922|year=1985, Reprinted 2006|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|isbn=0 85177 245 5|pages=17-19}}</ref>

In 1914 she was in active commission at the Nore based at Shearness tendered to '''HMS ''Actaeon''''', a Royal Navy training establishment.  With the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914 she was assigned to the Nore Local Flotilla.  Her duties included anti-submarine and counter mining patrols in the Thames Estuary.
