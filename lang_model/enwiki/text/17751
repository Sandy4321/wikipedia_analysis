'''Portuguese'''  ({{Audio|pt-Portugues.ogg|''portugu<U+00EA>s''}}, also ''l<U+00ED>ngua portuguesa'') is a [[Romance language]] that originated in what is today [[Galicia (Spain)]] and northern [[Portugal]]. It is the official language of [[Angola]], [[Brazil]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Mozambique]], [[Portugal]] and [[S<U+00E3>o Tom<U+00E9> and Pr<U+00ED>ncipe]], and co-official with [[Chinese language|Chinese]] in the Chinese S.A.R. of [[Macau]] and with [[Tetum]] in [[East Timor]].

Called "the sweet language" by the Spanish author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], and more recently described by the Brazilian poet [[Olavo Bilac]] as ''a <U+00FA>ltima flor do L<U+00E1>cio, inculta e bela'' ("the last flower of [[Latium]], wild and beautiful"), Portuguese is today a major world language, [[List of languages by number of native speakers|ranked]] fifth among the world's languages in number of native speakers (over 200 million). 

It is the language with the most speakers in South America (186 million, over 51% of the continent's population), and also a major [[lingua franca]] in Africa. It spread worldwide in the 15th and 16th century as Portugal set up a vast [[Portuguese Empire|colonial and commercial empire]] (1415&ndash;1999), spanning from [[Brazil]] in the [[Americas]] to [[Macau]] in [[China]]. In that colonial period, many [[Portuguese Creole|Portuguese creoles]] appeared around the world, especially in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and the [[Caribbean]].

[[image:Iilp.png|thumb|240px|The International Institute for the Portuguese Language logo depicts Portuguese as a language spoken in the eight corners of the world (the eight independent nations where it has official status).]]

Portuguese is the official [[language]] of [[Angola]], [[Brazil]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Portugal]] and [[S<U+00E3>o Tom<U+00E9> and Pr<U+00ED>ncipe]] and the most widely used language in [[Mozambique]]. It is also one of the official languages of [[East Timor]] (with [[Tetum]]) and of the Chinese [[Macau|S.A.R. of Macau]] (with [[Chinese language|Chinese]]).  It is widely spoken, but not official, in [[Andorra]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Namibia]] and [[Paraguay]] (in the latter country there were 112,520 native Portuguese speakers according to the 2002 census).  [[Portuguese Creole]]s are, while not official languages, the main one for communication in [[Cape Verde]] and part of [[Guinea-Bissau]]'s population. In Cape Verde most also speak standard Portuguese and have a native level language usage.

[[image:Map-Lusophone World-en.png|thumb|left|400px|Countries and regions where Portuguese has official status.]]
The '''CPLP''' or [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] is an international organization consisting of the eight independent countries which have Portuguese as an official language. Portuguese is also an official language of the [[European Union]], [[Mercosul]] and the [[African Union]] (one of the working languages) and one of the official languages of other organizations. The Portuguese language is gaining popularity in Africa, Asia, and South America as a second language for study.

Portuguese is with Spanish the fastest growing western language, and, following estimates by UNESCO it is the language with the highest potential of growth as an international communication language in Africa (south) and South America. The Portuguese speaking African countries are expected to have a combined population of 83 million by 2050. After Brazil signed into the economic market of [[Mercosul]] with other South America nations, such as Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, there has been an increase in curiosity towards study of Portuguese language in those South American countries. The demographic weight of Brazil in the continent will continue to strengthen the presence of Portuguese language in the region.

The language is also starting to gain popularity in Asia, mostly due to East Timor's boost in the number of speakers in the last five years, and Macau is becoming the Chinese center for learning Portuguese, where in the early 21st century, the language use was in decline, today it is growing as it has become a language for opportunity, due to increased Chinese diplomatic and financial ties with the Portuguese speaking countries.

In March of 2006, the [[Museum of the Portuguese Language]], an interactive museum about the Portuguese language, was founded in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], Brazil, the city with the largest number of Portuguese speakers in the world.

==Dialects==
{{main|Portuguese dialects}}
Portuguese is a [[pluricentric language]]. It has two main groups of dialects, those of [[Brazil]] and those of the [[Old World]]. For historical reasons, the dialects of Africa and Asia are generally closer to those of Portugal than the Brazilian dialects, although in some aspects of their phonology, especially the pronunciation of unstressed vowels, they resemble [[Brazilian Portuguese]] more than [[European Portuguese]]. They have not been studied as exhaustively as European and Brazilian Portuguese. In various parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, [[Portuguese creole]]s are spoken, but they are independent languages which should not be confused with Portuguese itself.  

Some audio samples of some of the main dialects of Portuguese are available below. There are some differences between the areas but these are the best approximations possible. For example, the ''caipira'' dialect has some differences from the one of Minas Gerais, but in general it is very close. A good example of Brazilian Portuguese may be found in the capital city, [[Bras<U+00ED>lia]], due to the generalized population from all parts of the country.

==Classification and related languages==
Portuguese belongs to the [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian]] branch of the [[Romance language]]s, and it has special ties with the following members of this group:

* [[Galician language|Galician]] and the [[Fala language|Fala]], its closest relatives. See below.
* [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the major language closest to Portuguese. See also ''[[Differences between Spanish and Portuguese]]''.
* [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]], another West Iberian language spoken in Portugal.
* [[Judeo-Portuguese]] and [[Ladino language|Judeo-Spanish]], languages spoken by [[Sephardic Jew]]s, which remained close to Portuguese and Spanish. 

===Latin and other Romance languages===
A distinctive feature of Portuguese is that it preserved the stressed vowels of [[Vulgar Latin]], which other Romance languages diphthongized; cf. Fr. ''pierre'', Sp. ''piedra'', Port. ''pedra'', from Lat. ''petra''; or Sp. ''fuego'', It. ''fuoco'', Port. ''fogo'', from Lat. ''focum''. Another characteristic of early Portuguese was the loss of [[intervocalic]] ''l'' and ''n'', sometimes followed by the merger of the two surrounding vowels, or by the insertion of an [[epenthetic vowel]] between them: cf. Lat. ''salire'', ''tenere'', ''catena'', Sp. ''salir'', ''tener'', ''cadena'', Port. ''sair'', ''ter'', ''cadeia''. 

When the [[elision|elided]] consonant was ''n'', it often [[nasalization|nasalized]] the preceding vowel: cf. Lat. ''manum'', ''rana'', ''bonum'', Port. ''m<U+00E3>o'', ''r<U+00E3>a'' (now ''r<U+00E3>''), ''b<U+00F5>o'' (now ''bom''). This process was the source of most of the nasal diphthongs which are typical of Portuguese. In particular, the Latin endings ''-anem'', ''-anum'' and ''-onem'' became ''-<U+00E3>o'' in most cases: cf. Lat. ''canem'', ''germanum'', ''rationem'' with Modern Port. ''c<U+00E3>o'', ''irm<U+00E3>o'', ''raz<U+00E3>o'', and their plurals ''c<U+00E3>es'', ''irm<U+00E3>os'', ''raz<U+00F5>es''.

See ''[[Portuguese vocabulary#From Latin to Portuguese|Portuguese Vocabulary: From Latin to Portuguese]]'', for other sound changes.

In spite of the obvious lexical and grammatical similarities between Portuguese and other Romance languages outside the West Iberian branch, it is not [[mutually intelligible]] with them to any practical extent. Portuguese speakers will usually need some formal study of basic grammar and vocabulary, before being able to understand even the simplest sentences in those languages (and vice-versa):

:''Ela fecha sempre a janela antes de jantar.'' (Portuguese)
:''Ela pecha sempre a fiestra antes de cear.'' ([[Galician language|Galician]])
:''Ella cierra siempre la ventana antes de cenar.'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]])
:''Ella tanca sempre la finestra abans de sopar.'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]])
:''Ella barra sempre la finestra abans de sopar.'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]])
:''Lei chiude sempre la finestra prima di cenare.'' ([[Italian language|Italian]])
:''Ea <U+00EE>nchide <U+00EE>ntotdeauna fereastra <U+00EE>nainte de a cina.'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]])
:''Elle ferme toujours la fen<U+00EA>tre avant de d<U+00EE>ner/souper.'' ([[French language|French]])
:She always shuts the window before dining.

Note that some of the lexical divergence above actually comes from different Romance languages using the same root word with different semantic values. Portuguese for example has the word ''fresta'', which is a cognate of French ''fen<U+00EA>tre'', Italian ''finestra'', Romanian ''fereastra'' and so on, but now means "slit" as opposed to "window." Likewise, Portuguese also has the word ''cear'', a cognate of Italian ''cenare'' and Spanish ''cenar'', but uses it in the sense of "to have a late supper", while the most frequent word meaning "to dine" is actually ''jantar'' (related to archaic Sp. ''yantar'') due to semantic changes in the 19th century. Italian has the word ''ella'', cognate of the other words for ''she'', but is considered archaic in most dialects.

Galician has both ''fiestra'' (from medieval ''f<U+1EBD>estra'' which is the ultimate origin of standard Portuguese ''fresta''), and the less frequently used ''xanela''. Like the northern dialects of Portuguese, it still uses ''cear'' with its original meaning of "dining".

===Galician and the Fala===
The closest language to Portuguese is Galician, spoken in the autonomous community of Galicia (northwestern Spain). The two were at one time a single language, known today as [[Galician-Portuguese]], but since the political separation of Portugal from Galicia they have diverged somewhat, especially in pronunciation and vocabulary. Nevertheless, the core vocabulary and grammar of Galician are still noticeably closer to Portuguese than to Spanish. In particular, it uses the future subjunctive, the personal infinitive, and the synthetic pluperfect (see the section on the grammar of Portuguese, below). Mutual intelligibility (estimated at 85% by R. A. Hall, Jr., 1989<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=glg Ethnologue]</ref>) is good between Galicians and northern Portuguese, but poorer between Galicians and speakers from central Portugal.

The linguistic status of Galician with respect to Portuguese is controversial. Some authors, such as Lindley Cintra<ref>Lindley Cintra, Lu<U+00ED>s F. [http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/cvc/hlp/biblioteca/novaproposta.pdf ''Nova Proposta de Classifica<U+00E7><U+00E3>o dos Dialectos Galego-Portugueses''] (PDF) Boletim de Filologia, Lisboa, Centro de Estudos Filol<U+00F3>gicos, 1971 (in Portuguese).</ref>, consider that they are still dialects of a common language, in spite of superficial differences in phonology and vocabulary. Others, such as Pilar V<U+00E1>zquez Cuesta<ref> V<U+00E1>zquez Cuesta, Pilar [http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/buscavoz/imprimir_noticia.jsp?TEXTO=973946 <U+00AB>Non son reintegracionista<U+00BB>], interview given to ''La Voz de Galicia'' on 22/02/2002 (in Galician).</ref>, argue that they have become separate languages due to major differences in phonetics and vocabulary usage, and, to a lesser extent, morphology and syntax. The official position of the Galician Language Institute is that Galician and Portuguese should be considered independent languages. The standard orthography takes advantage of the divergent features of the phonology of Galician to emphasize its differences from Portuguese, insisting on a phonetic spelling, and rejecting for example Portuguese graphic conventions like the graphemes ''nh'', ''lh'', ''j'' in favour of ''<U+00F1>'', ''ll'', ''x''. See also ''[[Reintegrationism]].''

The Fala language is another descendant of Galician-Portuguese, spoken by a small number of people in the Spanish towns of Valverdi du Fresnu, As Ellas and Sa Mart<U+00ED>n de Trebellu (autonomous community of [[Extremadura]], near the border with Portugal).

===Derived languages===
{{main|Portuguese creole}}
Beginning in the 16th century, the extensive contacts between Portuguese travelers and settlers, African slaves, and local populations led to the appearance of many [[pidgin]]s with varying amounts of Portuguese influence. As these pidgins became the mother tongue of succeeding generations, they evolved into fully fledged [[creole language]]s, which remained in use in many parts of Asia and Africa until the 18th century.

Some Portuguese-based or Portuguese-influenced creoles are still spoken today, by over 3 million people worldwide, especially people of partial [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry.

===Influence on other languages===
Many languages have [[loanword|borrowed words]] from Portuguese, such as [[Bahasa Indonesia|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Tetum language|Tetum]], [[Tsonga language|Xitsonga]], [[Papiamentu]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Lanc-Patu<U+00E1>]] (spoken in northern Brazil) and [[Sranan Tongo]] (spoken in Suriname). It left a strong influence on the ''[[Old Tupi|l<U+00ED>ngua bras<U+00ED>lica]]'', a [[Tupi-Guarani|Tupi-Guarani language]] which was the most widely spoken in [[Brazil]] until the 18th century, and on the language spoken around [[Sikka]] in [[Flores|Flores Island]], [[Indonesia]]. In nearby [[Larantuka]], Portuguese is used for prayers in [[Holy Week]] rituals.	 

The Japanese-Portuguese dictionary ''[[Nippo Jisho]]'' (1603) was the first dictionary of Japanese in a European language, a product of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary activity in [[Japan]]. Building on the work of earlier Portuguese missionaries, the ''Dictionarium Anamiticum, Lusitanum et Latinum'' (Annamite-Portuguese-Latin dictionary) of [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] (1651) introduced ''[[Vietnamese alphabet|qu<U+1ED1>c ng<U+1EEF>]]'', the modern orthography of [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which is based on the orthography of 17th-century Portuguese. The [[Romanization]] of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was also influenced by the Portuguese language (among others), particularly regarding [[List of common Chinese surnames|Chinese surnames]]; one example is "Mei".

==History==
{{Unreferenced|date=December 2006}}
{{main|History of Portuguese}}

Arriving in the Iberian Peninsula in 218 BC, the Romans brought with them the [[Latin language]], from which all Romance languages descend. In the 2nd century BC, southern Lusitania was already Romanized. [[Strabo]], a 1st century [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[geographer]], remarks in his ''[[Geographia (Strabo)|Geographia]]'' "encyclopedia": "they have adopted the Roman customs, and they no longer remember their own language." The language was spread by arriving Roman soldiers, settlers and merchants, who built Roman cities mostly near the settlements of previous civilizations.

Between 409 A.D. and 711, as the Roman Empire collapsed in Western Europe, the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by Germanic peoples ([[Migration Period]]). The newcomers, mainly [[Suevi]] and [[Visigoths]], quickly adopted late Roman culture and the Vulgar Latin dialects of the peninsula. After the [[Moors|Moorish]] invasion of 711, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] became the administrative language in the conquered regions, but most of the population continued to speak a form of [[Romance languages|Romance]] commonly known as [[Mozarabic]]. The influence exerted by Arabic on the Romance dialects spoken in the Christian kingdoms of the north was small, affecting mainly their lexicon.

The earliest surviving records of a distinctively Portuguese language are administrative documents of the [[9th century]], still interspersed with many Latin phrases. Today this phase is known as Proto-Portuguese (between the 9th and the 12th century). Portugal was formally recognized as an independent nation by the [[Kingdom of Leon]] in 1143, with [[Alfonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]] as king. In the first period of Old Portuguese - [[Galician-Portuguese|Portuguese-Galician Period]] (from the 12th to the 14th century) - the language gradually came into general use. Previously it had been the language of preference for [[lyric poetry]] in Christian Iberia, much like [[Occitan]] was the language of the [[Proven<U+00E7>al literature#Poetry of the Troubadours|poetry of the troubadors]]. In 1290, king [[Denis of Portugal|Denis]] created the first Portuguese University in Lisbon (the ''Estudo Geral'') and decreed that Portuguese, then simply called the "Vulgar language" should be known as the Portuguese language and used officially.

In the second period of Old Portuguese, from the 14th to the 16th century, with the [[Age of discovery|Portuguese discoveries]], the language was taken to many regions of [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and the [[Americas]] (nowadays, the great majority of Portuguese speakers live in Brazil, in South America). By the 16th century it had become a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in Asia and Africa, used not only for colonial administration and trade but also for communication between local officials and Europeans of all nationalities. Its spread was helped by mixed marriages between Portuguese and local people, and by its association with [[Roman Catholic]] [[missionary]] efforts, which led to the formation of a creole called ''[[Kristang language|crist<U+00E3>o]]'' ("Christian") in many parts of Asia. The language continued to be popular in parts of Asia until the 19th century. Some Portuguese-speaking Christian communities in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]] preserved their language even after they were isolated from Portugal. 

The end of the Old Portuguese period was marked by the publication of the ''Cancioneiro Geral de Garcia de Resende'', in 1516. The early times of Modern Portuguese, which spans from the 16th century to present day, were characterized by an increase in the number of erudite words borrowed from Classical Latin and Classical Greek during the Renaissance, which greatly enriched the lexicon.

==Vocabulary==
{{main|Portuguese vocabulary}}
Almost 90%{{Fact|date=February 2007}} of the lexicon of Portuguese is derived from Latin. Nevertheless, due to the [[Moors|Moorish]] occupation of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] during the Middle Ages, and the participation of Portugal in the [[Age of Discovery]], it has adopted loanwords from across the world. 

Very few Portuguese words can be traced to the pre-Roman inhabitants of Portugal, which included the [[Phoenicians]], [[Carthaginians]], [[Iberians]], [[Lusitanians]], and [[Celts]]. Some notable examples are ''ab<U+00F3>bora'' "pumpkin" and ''bezerro'' "year-old calf", from [[Iberian languages]]; ''cerveja'' "beer", from [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]; ''saco'' "bag", from [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]; and ''cachorro'' "dog, puppy", from [[Basque language|Basque]]. 

In the 5th century the Iberian Peninsula (the former Roman region of Hispania) was conquered by the [[Suevi]], [[Visigoths]] and [[Alans]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes who had been displaced from [[Central Europe]] by the [[Huns]].  As they adopted the Roman civilization and language, however, these people contributed only a few words to the lexicon, mostly related to warfare <U+2014> such as ''espora'' "spur", ''estaca'' "stake", and ''guerra'' "war", from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''*spa<U+00FA>ra'', ''*stakka'', and ''*wirro'', respectively.

Between the 9th and the 15th centuries Portuguese acquired about 1000 words from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] by influence of [[al-Andalus|Moorish Iberia]]. They are often recognizable by the initial Arabic article ''a''(''l'')''-'', and include many common words such as ''aldeia'' "village" from ''<U+0627><U+0644><U+062A><U+062C><U+0627><U+0631><U+064A><U+0629>'' ''aldaya'', ''alface'' "lettuce" from ''<U+0627><U+0644><U+062E><U+0633>'' ''alkhass'', ''armaz<U+00E9>m'' "warehouse" from ''<U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+062E><U+0632><U+0646>'' ''almahazan'', and ''azeite'' "olive oil" from ''<U+0632><U+064A><U+062A>'' ''azzait''. From Arabic came also the grammatically peculiar word [[Insha'Allah|''oxal<U+00E1>'']] "God willing". The name of the Portuguese town of [[F<U+00E1>tima, Portugal|F<U+00E1>tima]], where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared, is originally the name of one of the daughters of [[Muhammad]].

Starting in the 15th century, the Portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from [[Asia|Asian]] languages. For instance, ''catana'' "cutlass" from Japanese ''katana''; ''corja'' "rabble" from Malay ''k<U+00F3>rchchu''; and ''ch<U+00E1>'' "tea" from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''[[Tea#The word tea|''ch<U+00E1>'']]''.

From South America came ''batata'' "[[potato]]", from [[Taino language|Taino]]; ''anan<U+00E1>s'' and ''abacaxi'', from [[Tupi-Guarani]] ''nan<U+00E1>'' and [[Tupi language|Tupi]] ''ib<U+00E1> cati'', respectively (two species of [[pineapple]]), and ''tucano'' "[[toucan]]" from [[Guarani language|Guarani]] ''tucan''.

From the 16th to the 19th century, the role of Portugal as intermediary in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], with the establishment of large Portuguese colonies in Angola, Mozambique, and Brazil, Portuguese got several words of African and [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|Amerind]] origin, especially names for most of the animals and plants found in those territories.  While those terms are mostly used in the former colonies, many became current in European Portuguese as well.  From [[Kimbundu language|Kimbundu]], for example, came ''kifumate'' <U+2192> ''cafun<U+00E9>'' "head caress", ''kusula'' <U+2192> ''ca<U+00E7>ula'' "youngest child", ''marimbondo'' "tropical wasp", and ''kubungula'' <U+2192> ''bungular'' "to dance like a wizard". 

Finally, it has received a steady influx of loanwords from other European languages.  For example, ''melena'' "hair lock", ''fiambre'' "wet-cured ham" (in contrast with ''presunto'' "dry-cured ham" from Latin ''prae-exsuctus'' "dehydrated"), and ''castelhano'' "Castilian", from Spanish; ''colchete''/''croch<U+00EA>'' "bracket"/"crochet", ''palet<U+00F3>'' "jacket", ''batom'' "lipstick", and ''fil<U+00E9>''/''filete'' "steak"/"slice" respectively, from French ''crochet'', ''paletot'', ''b<U+00E2>ton'', ''filet''; ''macarr<U+00E3>o'' "pasta"", ''piloto'' "pilot", ''carro<U+00E7>a'' "carriage", and ''barraca'' "barrack", from Italian ''maccarone'', ''piloto'', ''carrozza'', ''baracca''; and ''bife'' "steak", ''futebol'', ''rev<U+00F3>lver'', ''estoque'', ''folclore'', from English ''beef'', ''football'', ''revolver'', ''stock'', ''folklore''.

{{main|Portuguese alphabet|Portuguese orthography}}
Portuguese is written with the [[Latin alphabet]], and makes use of the acute accent, the circumflex accent, the grave accent, the tilde, and the cedilla, to denote stress, vowel height, nasalization, and other sound changes. [[Brazilian Portuguese]] also uses the diaeresis mark. Accented letters and digraphs are not counted as separate characters for [[collation]] purposes.

===Brazilian vs. European spelling===
There are some minor differences between the orthographies of Brazil and other Portuguese language countries.  One of the most pervasive is the use of acute accents in the European/African orthography in many words such as ''sin<U+00F3>nimo'', where the Brazilian orthography has a circumflex accent, ''sin<U+00F4>nimo''. Another important difference is that Brazilian spelling often lacks ''c'' or ''t'' before ''c'', ''<U+00E7>'', or ''t'', where the European orthography has them; for example, cf. Brazilian ''fato'' with European ''facto'', "fact", or Brazilian ''objeto'' with European ''objecto'', "object". Some of these spelling differences reflect differences in the pronunciation of the words, but others are merely graphic.

== Phonology ==
{{main|Portuguese phonology}}

There is a maximum of 9 oral vowels and 19 consonants, though some varieties of the language have fewer phonemes (Brazilian Portuguese has only 7 oral vowel phonemes). There are also five nasal vowels, which some linguists regard as allophones of the oral vowels, ten oral [[diphthong]]s, and five nasal diphthongs.<ref>''Handbook of the International Phonetic Association'' pg. 126-130; the reference applies to the entire section</ref>

===Vowels===
[[Image:Portuguese_vowel_chart.png|frame|right|Chart of monophthongs of the Portuguese of Lisbon]]

To the seven vowels of [[Vulgar Latin]], European Portuguese has added two [[Mid-centralized vowel|near central vowels]], one of which tends to be [[elision|elided]] in [[relaxed pronunciation|rapid speech]], like the ''e caduc'' of [[French language|French]] (represented either as {{IPA|/<U+026F><U+033D>/}}, or {{IPA|/<U+0268>/}}, or {{IPA|/<U+0259>/}}). The high vowels {{IPA|/e o/}} and the low vowels {{IPA|/<U+025B> <U+0254>/}} are four distinct phonemes, and they alternate in various forms of [[apophony]]. Like [[Catalan language|Catalan]], Portuguese uses vowel quality to contrast stressed syllables with unstressed syllables: isolated vowels tend to be [[Vowel#Height|raised]], and in some cases centralized, when unstressed. Nasal diphthongs occur mostly at the end of words.

===Consonants===

The consonant inventory of Portuguese is fairly conservative. The medieval affricates {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/dz/}}, {{IPA|/t<U+0283>/}}, {{IPA|/d<U+0292>/}} merged with the fricatives {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|/<U+0283>/}}, {{IPA|/<U+0292>/}}, respectively, but not with each other, and there were no other significant changes to the consonant phonemes since then. However, some remarkable dialectal variants and [[allophone]]s have appeared, among which:

*In many regions of Brazil, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} have the affricate allophones {{IPA|[t<U+0283>]}} and {{IPA|[d<U+0292>]}}, respectively, before {{IPA|/i/}}. ([[Quebec French]] has a similar phenomenon, with alveolar affricates instead of postalveolars.)

*At the end of a syllable, the phoneme {{IPA|/l/}} has the velarized allophone {{IPA|[<U+026B>]}} in European Portuguese, like in the [[Received Pronunciation]] of English. Brazilian Portuguese has the allophone {{IPA|[w]}} instead (''[[L-vocalization#L-vocalization|L-vocalization]]''). 

*In many parts of Brazil and Angola, {{IPA|/<U+0272>/}} is pronounced as a nasal glide {{IPA|[j<U+0303>]}} that nasalizes the preceding vowel, so that for instance {{IPA|/'ni<U+0272>u/}} is pronounced {{IPA|['n<U+0129>j<U+0303>u]}}.

*There is considerable dialectal variation in the value of the [[Rhotic consonant|rhotic]] phoneme {{IPA|/<U+0281>/}}. See ''[[Guttural R#Portuguese|Guttural R in Portuguese]]'', for details. 

*In most of Brazil, the alveolar sibilants {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} occur in complementary distribution at the end of syllables, depending on whether the consonant that follows is voiceless or voiced, as in English. But in most of Portugal and parts of Brazil sibilants at the end of syllables are postalveolar, {{IPA|/<U+0283>/}} before voiceless consonants, and {{IPA|/<U+0292>/}} before voiced consonants. (In [[Ladino language|Judeo-Spanish]], {{IPA|/s/}} is often replaced with {{IPA|/<U+0283>/}} at the end of syllables, too.)

===Stress===
Primary [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] may fall on any of the three final syllables of a word, but mostly on the last two.  There is a partial correlation between the position of the stress and the final vowel; for example, the final syllable is usually stressed when it contains a nasal phoneme, a diphthong, or a [[close vowel]].  The orthography of Portuguese takes advantage of this correlation to minimize the number of diacritics.

Due to the phonetic changes that often affect unstressed vowels, pure lexical stress is less common in Portuguese than in related languages like Spanish, but there is still a significant number of examples of it: 
<!--THIS SHOULD BE A TABLE:-->
: ''d<U+00FA>vida'' {{IPA|/<U+02C8>duvid<U+0250>/}} "doubt" (noun) vs. ''duvida'' {{IPA|/du<U+02C8>vid<U+0250>/}} "he doubts"
:''falaram'' {{IPA|/fa<U+02C8>la<U+027E><U+0250><U+0303><U+0169>/}} "they spoke" vs. ''falar<U+00E3>o'' {{IPA|/fala<U+02C8><U+027E><U+0250><U+0303><U+0169>/}} "they will speak" (Brazilian pronunciation)
:''ouve'' {{IPA|/'ovi/}} "he hears" vs. ''ouvi''  {{IPA|/o'vi/}} "I heard" (Brazilian pronunciation)
:''t<U+00FA>nel'' {{IPA|/'tun<U+025B>l/}} "tunnel" vs. ''tonel'' {{IPA|/tu'n<U+025B>l/}} "wine cask" (European pronunciation)

===Prosody===
[[tone (linguistics)|Tone]] is not lexically significant in Portuguese, but phrase- and sentence-level tone are important. There are of six dynamic tone patterns that affect entire [[phrase]]s, which indicate the mood and intention of the speaker such as implication, emphasis, reservation, etc.  As in most Romance languages, interrogation is expressed mainly by sharply raising the tone at the end of the sentence.

==Grammar==
{{main|Portuguese grammar}}

===Indo-European characteristics===
It is a [[fusional language|fusional]], [[morphosyntactic alignment|nominative-accusative]] language.

===Romance characteristics===
There are definite and indefinite [[article (grammar)|articles]]. Nouns, adjectives and articles show only a limited degree of [[inflection]] (though moreso than in English). There are two [[grammatical gender]]s, masculine and feminine, and two [[grammatical number]]s, singular and plural. [[Grammatical case|Case]] marking on nouns has been completely lost, though a trace of it survives in the personal pronouns.

Verbs are highly inflected, normally having over 50 different forms. There are numerous [[periphrastic]] verbal constructions, as well. There are three [[grammatical tense|tenses]], past, present and future; three [[grammatical mood|moods]], indicative, subjunctive, and imperative; and three [[grammatical aspect|aspects]], imperfect, perfective, and progressive (perfective and progressive forms are mostly periphrastic). It has a [[conditional tense|conditional]] form distinct from the subjunctive, and two [[copula|verbs "to be"]]. It is a [[null-subject language]]. Typical word order is [[word order|SVO]], though it is generally less strict than in English.

===Galician-Portuguese characteristics===
* The future subjunctive tense, which was developed by medieval [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian Romance]], but has now fallen into disuse in Spanish, is still used in [[vernacular]] Portuguese. It appears in dependent clauses that denote a condition which must be fulfilled in the future, so that the independent clause will occur. Other languages normally employ the present tense under the same circumstances:

:''Se <u>for</u>'' ''eleito presidente, mudarei a lei.'' [future subjunctive]
:If <u>I am</u> elected president, I will change the law.

:''Quando <u>fores</u>'' ''mais velho, vais entender.'' [future subjunctive]
:When <u>you are</u> older, you will understand.

* The personal infinitive: it is possible for an [[infinitive]] verb to [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with its subject in person and number, often showing who is supposed to perform a certain act; cf. ''<U+00C9> melhor voltares'' "It is better [for you] to go back.", ''<U+00C9> melhor voltarmos'' "It is better [for us] to go back." Perhaps for this reason, infinitive clauses replace subjunctive clauses more often in Portuguese than in other Romance languages.

===Unique features===
The Portuguese [[present perfect]] has an [[iteration|iterative]] sense which is unique among the Romance languages. It denotes an action or a series of actions which began in the past and are expected to keep repeating in the future. For instance, the meaning of ''Tenho tentado falar com ela'' may be closer to "I have been trying to talk to her" than to "I have tried to talk to her", depending on the context. On the other hand, the correct translation of the question "Have you heard the latest news?" is not ''*Tem ouvido a <U+00FA>ltima not<U+00ED>cia?'', but ''Ouviu a <U+00FA>ltima not<U+00ED>cia?'', since no repetition is implied.
