'''Michigan State University''' ('''MSU''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]], [[Michigan]] [[United States|USA]]. Founded in 1855, it was the pioneer [[land-grant institution]] and served as a model for future land-grant colleges in the United States under the 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]].  MSU pioneered the studies of [[packaging]], [[hotel|hospitality business]], and [[music therapy]]. Its [[study abroad]] program is the largest of any single-campus university in the country, offering more than 200 programs in more than 60 countries on all continents including [[Antarctica]].

Following the introduction of the [[Morrill Act]], the college became [[coeducation]]al and expanded its curriculum beyond agriculture. After [[World War II]], the number of students tripled as the institution became a major university. Today, MSU is the [[List of largest United States universities by enrollment|seventh-largest university]] in the [[United States]], with 45,166 students and 2,311 members of [[faculty]]. 

MSU's [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] sports teams are called the [[Michigan State Spartans|Spartans]]. They compete in the [[Big Ten Conference]] in all sports except ice hockey, in which the team is part of the [[Central Collegiate Hockey Association]].  MSU's [[American football|football]] team won the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] in 1954, 1956, and 1988. Its men's basketball team won the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA National Championship]] in 1979 and 2000. The MSU men's [[ice hockey]] has won [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|national titles]] in 1966, 1986, and 2007.

==History==
{{main|History of Michigan State University}}
===Agriculture school===
[[Image:MSU Beaumont Tower 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Beaumont Tower]] marks the site of the old College Hall.]]
The [[Michigan Constitution]] of 1850 called for the creation of an "agricultural school",<ref>"[http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/historical/miconstitution1850.htm Michigan Constitution of 1850]". ''Michigan Legislature''. Article 13, Section 11. Accessed April 12, 2007.</ref> though it was not until [[February 12]], [[1855]] that Michigan [[List of Governors of Michigan|Governor]] [[Kinsley S. Bingham]] signed a bill establishing the United States' first agriculture college, the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan.<ref>Widder, Keith. "[http://www.s150.msu.edu/history_origins.php Origins of MSU]". ''MSU Sesquicentennial Celebration''. January 16, 2004. Accessed April 12, 2007.</ref> Classes began in May 1857 with three buildings, five faculty members, and 63 male students. The first president, [[Joseph R. Williams]], designed a curriculum that required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced [[science]], [[liberal arts]], and practical training. The curriculum excluded [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] studies, since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily [[manual labour|manual labor]], which kept costs down for both the students and the College.<ref>{{cite book | author=Darling, Birt. | title=City in the Forest; The Story of Lansing | location=New York | publisher=Stratford House | year=1950 | id=LCCN 50008202|pages=121}}</ref> Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as [[elitism|elitist]]. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.

===Land Grant pioneer===
In 1860, Joseph Williams became acting [[lieutenant governor]]<ref>"[http://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/williams.htm Joseph R. Williams Biographical Information]". ''MSU University Archives and Historical Collection'' Accessed April 12, 2007. </ref> and helped pass the Reorganization Act of 1861. This gave the College a four-year curriculum and the power to grant [[master's degree]]s. Under the act, a newly-created body, known as the State Board of Agriculture, took over from the State Board of Education in running the institution.<ref>"[http://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/articlepg1.htm Milestones of MSU's Sesquicentennial]". ''MSU University Archives and Historical Collection'' Accessed April 12, 2007.</ref> The College changed its name to State Agricultural College, and its first class graduated in the same year. However, there was no time for an elaborate graduation ceremony: the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] had just begun, and the first alumni were drafted into the war effort. The following year, [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the First Morrill Act of 1862 to support similar colleges, making the Michigan school a national model. Williams never witnessed the cause to which he had dedicated so much of his life, having taken ill and died the previous year.

===Co-ed college===
[[Image:MSU Alice B Cowles House.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Alice B Cowles House is the official home of the university president and is the oldest existing building on campus.]]
The college first admitted women in 1870, although at that time there were no female residence halls. The few women who enrolled either boarded with faculty families or made the arduous [[stagecoach]] trek from [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]]. Nonetheless, even from the early days female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a "Women Course" that melded a [[Family and consumer science|home economics]] curriculum with [[liberal arts]] and sciences. That same year, the College turned the old Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory and more firmly established itself as co-ed. However, it was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first [[African American]] student, William O. Thompson. He went on to teach at what is now [[Tuskegee University]] under the wing of [[Booker T. Washington]], whom President Jonathan L. Snyder invited to be the Class of 1900 commencement speaker. A few years later, Myrtle Craig became the first female African American student to enroll at the College. Along with the Class of 1907, she received her degree from U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], commencement speaker for the Semi-Centennial celebration. The City of East Lansing was incorporated in that same year,<ref>{{cite book | author=Miller, Whitney. | title=East Lansing: Collegeville Revisited (Images of America) | location=Charleston, South Carolina | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2002 | id=ISBN 0-7385-2045-4 | pages=26}}</ref> and two years later the college officially changed its name to Michigan Agricultural College (M.A.C.).


[[Image:Hannah statue.jpg|200px|thumb|left|As part of its sesquicentennial celebration, MSU erected this 7-foot bronze statue of [[John A. Hannah]], sculpted by California artist Bruce Wolfe.<ref>Anderson, Kristin K. "[http://www.msutoday.msu.edu/news/index.php3?article=17Sep2004-1 Ceremony pays tribute to 'pragmatic visionary']". ''MSU Today''. September 17, 2004. Accessed April 12, 2007.</ref> {{rfu-c|[[2007-04-12]]}}]]
===Big Ten university===
During the early 20th century, M.A.C. expanded its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925, it had expanded enough that it changed its name to Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (M.S.C.). In 1941, the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, [[John A. Hannah]], became president of the College. He began the largest expansion in the institution's history, with the help of the 1945 [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]], which helped World War II veterans to receive an education. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction on a new dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.<ref>{{cite book | author=Heineman, Kenneth J. | title=Campus Wars: The Peace Movement at American State Universities in the Vietnam Era | location=New York | publisher=New York University Press | year=1993 | id=ISBN 0-8147-3512-6|pages=21}}</ref> Hannah also got the chance to improve the athletic reputation of M.S.C. when the [[University of Chicago]] resigned from the [[Big Ten Conference]] in 1946. Hannah lobbied hard to take its place, gaining admission in 1950. Five years later, in its Centennial year of 1955, the State of Michigan renamed the College as Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science.<ref>{{cite book | author=Kuhn, Madison. | title=Michigan State: The First Hundred Years, 1855-1955 | location=East Lansing | publisher=Michigan State University Press | year=1955 | id=ISBN 0-87013-222-9 | pages=471}}</ref> Nine years after that, the University governing body changed its name from the State Board of Agriculture to the MSU Board of Trustees. The State of Michigan allowed the University to drop the words "Agriculture and Applied Science" from its name. Since 1964, the institution has gone by the name of Michigan State University.

===Global leader by 2012===
[[Image:MSU Cyclotron.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory features one of the most powerful instruments of its type in the world.]]
Since the end of the Hannah era, Michigan State has shifted its focus from increasing the size of its student body to advancing its national and global reputation. In recent years, "[[town and gown]]" relations have soured as students and permanent residents looked at each other with increasing hostility. Tensions worsened when East Lansing erupted in riots in 1997,<ref>Terlep, Sharon. "E.L. turmoil angers city". ''The State News''. September 9, 1997.</ref> and 1998.<ref>Mullin, Greg. "17 arrested in weekend riot". ''The State News''. May 4, 1998.</ref><ref>Staff reports. "Thousands of revelers crowd streets in violent, fiery riot". ''The State News''. March 28, 1999.</ref> The most recent disturbance occurred on [[April 2]] [[2005]], after MSU's defeat to [[University of North Carolina|North Carolina]] in the 2005 men's basketball [[Final Four]].<ref>Phillips, Lauren. "[http://www.statenews.com/article.phtml?pk=29446 Police, student actions disputed]". ''The State News''. April 4, 2005. Accessed April 12, 2007.</ref> Officially deemed a "civil disturbance" rather than a riot, the incident sparked a debate over [[police brutality]] in East Lansing, which has yet to be resolved. Despite the damage to MSU's image, the University looks to improve its academic reputation in the 21st century. In September 2005, current president [[Lou Anna Simon]] called for MSU, one of the [[Public Ivy|public ivy institutions]], to become the global model leader for Land Grant institutions by the year 2012. Her plans include creating a new [[residential college]] and increasing [[National Institutes of Health]] donations past the [[United States dollar|$]]100 million mark. While there are over 100 [[Land-grant universities]] in the United States, she has stated that she would like Michigan State University to be the leader.<ref>Darrow, Bob.[http://www.statenews.com/article.phtml?pk=31495 Simon: MSU to be model university].

==Campus==
{{main|Campus of Michigan State University}}
[[Image:MSU Campus Map small rev2.png|thumb|250px|right|MSU's main campus lies north of the CN Railroad.]]
MSU's sprawling campus is located in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]].  The campus is perched on the banks of the [[Red Cedar River (Michigan)|Red Cedar River]]. Development of the campus started in 1857 with three buildings: a multipurpose building called [[College Hall]], a dormitory later called "[[Saints' Rest]]", and a barn. Today, MSU's contiguous campus consists of 5,200&nbsp;[[acre]]s (2,104&nbsp;[[hectare|ha]]), 2,000&nbsp;acres (809.4&nbsp;ha) of which are developed. There are currently 676 buildings: 203 for academics, 154 for agriculture, 245 for housing and food service, as well as 74 other buildings. Overall, the University has 21,931,085 [[square foot|square feet]] (2,037,464.5&nbsp;[[square metre|m<U+00B2>]]) of total indoor space.<ref>"[http://www.pp.msu.edu/Bldg_Info/Bldg_Data_Summary_2004.pdf Building Data Summary]". ''MSU Physical Plant''. 2004. Accessed April 12, 2007.</ref> Connecting it all is 27 [[mile]]s (43 [[kilometer|km]]) of roads and 100 miles (161 km) of sidewalks.<ref>Miller, Matthew. "MSU a 'city' unto itself]". ''Lansing State Journal''.

[[Image:MSU Morrill Hall.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Morrill Hall is amongst the oldest structures still standing on campus.]]
===North campus===
The oldest part of campus lies on the north bank of the Red Cedar. It includes [[Collegiate Gothic]] architecture, plentiful trees, and curving roads with few straight lines. It was in this area that the College built its first three buildings, of which none survive. Other historic buildings north of the river include [[Cowles House]], the president's official residence, and [[Beaumont Tower]], a [[carillon]] clock tower marking the site of [[College Hall]], the original classroom building. To the east lies [[Eustace-Cole Hall]] and [[Marshall-Adams Hall]], America's first freestanding laboratories for [[horticulture]] and [[bacteriology]], respectively.<ref>{{cite book | author=Stanford, Linda O. | title=MSU Campus: Buildings, Places, Spaces | location=East Lansing | publisher=Michigan State University Press | year=2002 | id=ISBN 0-87013-631-3|pages=60}}</ref> Other landmarks include the bronze statue of former president [[John A. Hannah]],<ref>Roeschke, Jaclyn. "[http://www.statenews.com/article.phtml?pk=25569 Former 'U' president immortalized with bronze statue]". ''State News''. September 20, 2004.

Beal Botanical Garden]], and the painted [[boulder]] known as "[[The Rock (Michigan State University)|The Rock]]", which is a popular spot for theatre, [[tailgate party|tailgating]], and candlelight vigils. On the northwest corner of campus lies the University's hotel, the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center.

===South campus===
[[Image:MSU Wharton Center.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Wharton Center for Performing Arts]] hosts many productions throughout the year and was host to the final US Presidential Debate before the 1992 election.]]
The campus south of the river consists mostly of post-World War II [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] buildings with sparse foliage, relatively straight roadways, and numerous parking lots. The "2020 Vision" Master Plan proposes replacing these parking lots with [[multi-storey car park|parking ramps]] and green space,<ref>"[http://www.2020vision.msu.edu/construction/ 2020 Vision Campus Master Plan]". ''MSU Campus Planning and Administration''. 2006. Accessed April 12, 2007.</ref> but these plans will take many years to reach fruition. As part of the master plan, the University erected a new bronze statue of "[[Sparty|The Spartan]]" in 2005. This replica replaced the original [[modernist]] [[terra cotta]] statue,<ref>{{Cite book|author=Stanford, Linda | title=MSU Campus: Buildings, Places, Spaces | location=East Lansing, Michigan| publisher=Michigan State University Press | year=2002|id=ISBN 0-87013-631-3}}</ref> which can still be seen on the west concourse of the [[Spartan Stadium, East Lansing|Spartan Stadium]]. Notable academic and research buildings on the South Campus include the [[National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory|Cyclotron]] and the [[Michigan State University College of Law|College of Law]]. This part of campus is home to the [[Michigan State University Horticulture Gardens|MSU Horticulture Gardens]] and the adjoining [[4-H]] Children's Garden. South of the gardens lie the [[Canadian National]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] railroads, which divide the main campus from thousands of acres of university-owned farmland.

Olds]] helped the program stay afloat with a gift of $100,000.<ref>{{cite book | author=Rodriguez, Michael | title=R.E. Olds and Industrial Lansing | location=Charleston, South Carolina | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2004 | id=ISBN 0-7385-3272-X | pages=117}}</ref> While this opened the door for other types of private donations, MSU has often lagged behind peer institutions in terms of endowments. As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools, with barely over $100 million in endowment funds. However, in the early 2000s, the University started a campaign to increase the size of the endowment. At the close of FY 2004<U+2013>05, the endowment had risen to $1.325 billion, raising the University to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2M of the fifth-rated school.<ref>Seguin, Rick. "[http://newsbulletin.msu.edu/jan2606/endowment.html Endowment surges in growth, rankings]". ''MSU News Bulletin''. 2006. Accessed April 12, 2007.</ref> The rapid increase in the size of the endowment will help to improve outdated facilities, such as the Music Building, which the College of Music hopes to soon replace with money from its alumni fundraising program.<ref>"[http://www.music.msu.edu/alumni/campaign.php Capital Campaign]".

[[Image:MSU South Campus skyline.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The South Campus skyline.]]
===Residential colleges===
MSU has several [[residential colleges]], based on the [[Oxbridge]] "living-learning" model. By putting classes in student domitories, these colleges improve student access to faculty and facilities. MSU's first residential college, [[Justin Morrill]] College started in 1965 with an interdisciplinary curriculum.<ref>"[http://www.enolagaia.com/JMC.html Unofficial website]". Justin Morrill College]. Accessed April 13, 2007.</ref> MSU closed Morrill College in 1979, but today the university has two remaining residential colleges, with a third scheduled to start in 2007.

Started in 1967, [[James Madison College]] tries to merge the best attributes of a small [[public affairs]] college and a major university. Classes in the college are small, with an average of 25 students, and most instructors are [[tenure]] track [[faculty]].  Each of Madison's four [[Academic major|majors]] requires two years of foreign language and one year of "field experience<U+201D> in an [[Intern|internship]] or study abroad program. Although Madison students make up about 4% of MSU graduates, they represent around 35% of the MSU<U+2019>s [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] members.<ref>"[http://www.jmc.msu.edu/quickfacts.asp Quick Madison Facts]".

(The other being the [[University of Florida]])  The Spartans have participated in two events, in basketball and ice hockey, which have set world records for spectator attendances for both sports.

===Football===
{{main|Michigan State Spartans football}}
[[American football|Football]] has a long tradition at Michigan State. Starting as a club sport in 1884, football gained varsity status in 1896.<ref>{{cite book | author=Grinczel, Steve. | title=They Are Spartans | location=Charleston, South Carolina | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2003 | id=ISBN 0-7385-3214-2 | pages=9}}</ref> In the 1950s, MSU led the nation in desegregation, allowing black athletes in all sports. It won the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] in 1954, 1956, and 1988. In 1967 the Spartans accounted for four of the top eight picks in the NFL draft, the only time a college football program has accomplished such feat.

Today, the football team competes in [[Spartan Stadium, East Lansing|Spartan Stadium]], a renovated 75,025 person football stadium in the center of campus. The current coach is [[Mark Dantonio]], who was hired on November 27, 2006.<ref>"[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/27/sports/ncaafootball/27coach.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin Michigan State Looks to Cincinnati for Coach]".

===Men's basketball===
MSU's men's basketball team has won the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|National Championship]] twice: in 1979 and again in 2000. In 1979, [[Magic Johnson|Earvin "Magic" Johnson]], along with [[Greg Kelser]], [[Jay Vincent]], and Mike Brkovich, led the MSU team to a 75-64 win against the [[Larry Bird]]-led [[Indiana State University|Indiana State]] Sycamores. In 2000, three players from [[Flint, Michigan]], [[Morris Peterson]], [[Charlie Bell (basketball)|Charlie Bell]], and [[Mateen Cleaves]] led the team to its second national title. Dubbed the "Flintstones", they were the key to the Spartans' win against the [[University of Florida]]. On [[December 13]], [[2003]], Michigan State and [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]] played in the [[Basketbowl]], in which a record crowd of 78,129 watched the game in [[Detroit]]<U+2019>s [[Ford Field]].

===Activism===
[[Activism|Activists]] have played an important role in MSU history. During the height of the [[Vietnam War]], student protests helped create [[co-ed]] residence halls, and blocked the routing of [[Interstate 496]] through campus. In the 1980s, Michigan State students convinced the University to [[divestment|divest]] the stocks of companies doing business in [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]] from its endowment portfolio, such as [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]].<ref>{{cite book | author=U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. | title=The Anti-Apartheid Act of 1985 | location=Washington | publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office | year=1985|pages=213}}</ref> Today, MSU has many student groups focused on political change. The [[Students' union|student government]] is the [[Associated Students of Michigan State University]] (ASMSU). It is known for its unusual nonpartisan bicameral structure, which includes the parallel [[Student Assembly]] and [[Academic Assembly]].<ref>Associated Students of Michigan State University. [http://asmsu.msu.edu/constitution.php Constitution].</ref> Graduate campus groups include the Graduate Employees Union (GEU) and the Council of Graduate Students (COGS). Michigan State also has a variety of [[Political party|partisan]] groups ranging from [[liberal]] to [[conservatism|conservative]], including the [[College Republicans]], the [[College Democrats]] and several [[third party]] organizations. Other partisan activist groups include [[Young Americans for Freedom]] on the [[Right-wing politics|right]] and Students for Economic Justice and ''Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan'' ([[Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan|MEChA]]) on the [[Social liberalism|left]]. Given MSU's proximity to the Michigan state capital of [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], many politically-inclined Spartans do internships for the state representatives.

===Greek Life===
Michigan State University's [[fraternity and sorority houses|greek system]] consists of around fifty Greek lettered student societies. These chapters are in turn under the jurisdiction of one of MSU's four Greek governing councils. Of these four, the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|Interfraternity Council]] (IFC) and the [[National Panhellenic Conference|Women's Panhellenic Council]] are each entirely responsible for their own budgets, giving them the freedom to hold large fundraising and recruitment events. MSU's fraternities and sororities hold many [[philanthropy]] events and community fundraisers. For example, in March 2006, the Greek system held Greek Week to raise over $170,000 for the [[American Cancer Society]], Ele's Place, the [[Ronald McDonald House]], and the [[Special Olympics]].<ref>Spurlock, Amanda.
