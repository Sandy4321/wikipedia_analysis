'''Montonico bianco''' (also known as '''Mantonico bianco''') is a white [[Italian wine]] grape that is grown in the [[Calabria (wine)|Calabria]] region of southern Italy. [[Ampelographers]] believe that the grape is likely of [[Greek (wine)|Greek]] origins and was transported to southern Italy by [[ancient Greek (wine)|ancient Greek]] settlers. Though the variety has a long history in Calabria, its numbers have been slowly declining with 1100 [[hectares]]/2700 acres planted in the region by the end of the 20th century.<ref name="wine grapes">J.
