'''Brock Speer''' (December 28, 1920-March 19, 1999)<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary: Brock Speer|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-brock-speer-1084785.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> sang bass for the [[Speer Family]] [[Southern Gospel]] musical group and was a leader in [[Southern Gospel]] music.

One might say that [[Southern Gospel]] music was Speer's life. David Liverett's book, ''This Is My Story: 145 of the World's Greatest Gospel Singers'', includes the following comments written by Speer's nephew, Steve Speer, and printed in the program distributed at Brock's funeral: <blockquote>Jackson Brock Speer was born in Winston County, Alabama, just two months before his father and mother began a singing group called the [[Speer Family|Speer Quartet]]. For the remaining seventy-eight years of his life, he was inextricably intertwined with that group. With only one exception -- World War II -- he sang with his family his entire life.<ref>Liverett, David. (2005). ''This Is My Story: 145 of the World's Greatest Gospel Singers''. Thomas Nelson, Inc. ISBN 1-4185-0607-9, P. 255</ref></blockquote>
