'''Zu''' are an  [[Italy|Italian]] instrumental  [[Trio (music)|trio]] from [[Rome]]. 

== Biography ==
Hailing from the catholic block of Rome, Zu are an atypical trio made of drums, electric bass, baritone saxophone and electronics. Formed in Rome in 1997, they began as composers and players for theatre performances. The band is composed of three members: Luca Mai on death [[saxophone]], Massimo Pupillo on [[bass guitar|bass]] and Jacopo Battaglia on [[drum kit|drums]]. Zu have released fourteen [[album]]s, including two live album and two splits, and played in festivals in Europe, America, Asia and Africa. In 2006 the band toured with the Fant<U+00F4>mas Melvins Big Band, a superband which is a fusion of [[Fantomas]] and the [[Melvins]].

The band are members of the Italian folk-jazz group [[Ardecore]].

== Style ==
Although difficult to define, Zu's style could be characterised as a fusion of [[math rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[noise rock]], but with the caveat that it does not respect boundaries or genres. The music is instrumental, and features virtuosic drumming, powerful bass and distorted saxophone.

One constant element in Zu's music is collaboration, and many of the band's albums are billed as collaborations with a guest musician (such as [[Mike Patton]], [[Buzz Osbourne]], and [[Nobukazu Takemura]]). Often, a collaborator will join them at live performances as well.  Members of the band also collaborate with other musical projects, most of which exist only as live performances.

==Reception==
The band's album ''Radiale'', recorded with [[Bob Weston]], was placed in ''[[The Village Voice]]'''s jazz poll for 2004.

[[John Zorn]] described the band as creating "a powerful and expressive music that totally blows away what most bands do these days".
