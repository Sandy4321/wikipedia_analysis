{{Aztec}}

'''Aztec''' is a term used to refer to certain ethnic groups of central [[Mexico]], particularly those groups who spoke the [[Nahuatl language]] and who achieved political and military dominance over large parts of [[Mesoamerica]] in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, a period referred to as the Late post-Classic period in [[Mesoamerican chronology]]. 

Often the term "Aztec" refers exclusively to the people of Tenochtitlan, situated on an island in [[Lake Texcoco]], who called themselves ''Mexica Tenochca'' or Colhua-Mexica.<!--Note: Tenochtitlan is properly spelled without an accent over the "a" when referring to the Aztec capital. See [[Talk:Tenochtitlan]]-->

Sometimes it also includes the inhabitants of Tenochtitlan's two principal allied city-states, the [[Acolhua]]s of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] and the [[Tepanec]]s of [[Tlacopan]], who together with the Mexica formed the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]] which has also become known as the "'''Aztec Empire'''". In other contexts it may refer to all the various [[Altepetl|city state]]s and their peoples, who shared large parts of their ethnic history as well as many important cultural traits with the Mexica, Acolhua and Tepanecs, and who like them, also spoke the Nahuatl language. In this meaning it is possible to talk about an '''Aztec civilization''' including all the particular cultural patterns common for the Nahuatl speaking peoples of the late postclassic period in Mesoamerica.

From the 13th century the [[Valley of Mexico]] was the nucleus of Aztec civilization: here the capital of the Aztec Triple Alliance, the city of [[Tenochtitlan]], was built upon raised islets in [[Lake Texcoco]]. The Triple Alliance formed its tributary empire expanding its political hegemony far beyond the Valley of Mexico, conquering other city states throughout Mesoamerica.  

At its pinnacle Aztec culture had rich and complex [[Aztec mythology|mythological]] and [[Aztec religion|religious]] traditions, as well as reaching remarkable architectural and artistic accomplishments. A particularly striking element of Aztec culture to many was the practice of [[human sacrifice in Aztec culture|human sacrifice]]. 

In 1521, in what is probably the most widely known episode in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]], along with a large number of Nahuatl speaking indigenous allies, conquered Tenochtitlan and defeated the Aztec Triple Alliance under the leadership of [[Hueyi Tlatoani]] [[Moctezuma II]]; In the series of events often referred to as "[[Spanish conquest of Mexico|The Fall of the Aztec Empire]]". Subsequently the Spanish founded the new settlement of [[Mexico City]] on the site of the ruined Aztec capital. 

Aztec culture and history is primarily known:
*From [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence as it is found in excavations such as that of the renowned [[Templo Mayor]] in Mexico City and many others.
*From [[Aztec codices|indigenous bark paper codices]].
*From eyewitness accounts by Spanish conquistadors such as [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]] and [[Bernal D<U+00ED>az del Castillo]].
*And especially from 16th and 17th century descriptions of Aztec culture and history written by Spanish clergymen and literate Aztecs in the Spanish or Nahuatl language, such as the famous [[Florentine Codex]] compiled by the [[Franciscan order|Franciscan]] monk [[Bernardino de Sahag<U+00FA>n]] with the help of indigenous Aztec informants. 

==Nomenclature==
[[Image:MexicanSculptureRememberingTheSignForTenochtitlanFoundation.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Sculpture commemorating the moment when '''Aztecs''' found the sign from the god [[Huitzilopochtli]].]]
According to the mythico-historical [[Aztec codices#Aubin codex|Aubin codex]], seven Nahua tribes lived in [[Aztl<U+00E1>n]] under the rule of a powerful elite. The seven tribes fled [[Aztl<U+00E1>n]], to seek new lands. The Mexicas were the last group to leave. The Aubin Codex relates that after leaving Aztl<U+00E1>n, their god [[Huitzilopochtli]] ordered his people to never identify themselves as Azteca, the name of their former masters. Instead they should henceforth call themselves ''Mex<U+00EC>c<U+00E2>.''

The word "Aztec" was not originally an [[endonym]] for any ethnic group, but achieved wide use as an [[exonym]] first in the [[English language]] and later in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] from the 19th century on. Some modern day scholars use the word "Aztec" to refer to the Nahuatl speaking peoples of Mexico before the Spanish conquest in 1519 and the word "Nahua" to refer to the same peoples after the conquest.<ref>For example Smith (2001) following Lockhart (1994)</ref> Because no people ever referred to itself as "Aztecs", and because the peoples to whom the word is popularly used to refer never saw themselves as a unified ethnic group, many scholars now prefer to refer to particular ethnic groups individually e.g. the "Mexica", "Acolhua" or "Tepaneca" rather than subsuming them under a single term such as "Aztec". 

The Spanish [[conquistador]]es referred to them as "Mexicas" or "Culua-Mexicas". In Mexico, archaeologists and museums use the term Mexicas. The wider population in and outside Mexico generally speaks of Aztecs. In this article, the term "Mexica" is used to refer to the Mexica people up until the time of the formation of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]]. After this, the term "Aztecs" is used to refer to the three peoples who made up the Triple Alliance, or in the wider context to all the Nahuatl speaking peoples as bearers of "Aztec culture".

===Mexica===
:''See also: [[Toponymy of Mexico]]''. 
''Mex<U+00EC>c<U+00E2>'' ({{IPA2|me<U+0283>i<U+0294>ka<U+0294>}}) is a term of uncertain origin. Very different etymologies are proposed: the old [[Nahuatl]] word for the [[moon]], the name of their leader [[Mexitli]], or a type of weed that grows in [[Lake Texcoco]]. Mexican scholar [[Miguel Le<U+00F3>n-Portilla]] suggests that it is derived from ''mexictli'', "navel of the moon", from Nahuatl ''metztli'' (moon) and ''xictli'' (navel).<ref>[http://www.edomexico.gob.mx/identidad/civica/htm/NomMexico.htm Nombre del Estado de M<U+00E9>xico] Gobierno del Estado de M<U+00E9>xico</ref> Alternatively, ''mexictli'' could mean "navel of the [[maguey]]" using the Nahuatl ''metl'' and the locative "co".

According to a Mexica legend, it was [[Huitzilopochtli]], the war deity and patron of the Mexica who gave them their name. The most probable interpretation is that the name comes from ''[[Mexitl]]'' or ''Mexi'' a secret name for the deity.<ref>AGUILAR-MORENO M (2006) ''Handbook to Life in the Aztec World'' Facts of Life, Inc: New York, USA, p. 19</ref>

===Aztec===
In Nahuatl, the native language of the Mexicas, ''Aztecatl'' means "someone who comes from [[Aztl<U+00E1>n]]". In 1810 [[Alexander von Humboldt]] originated the modern usage of "Aztec" as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade, custom, religion, and language to the Mexica state and the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]]. In 1843, with the publication of the work of [[William H. Prescott]], it was adopted by most of the world, including 19th century Mexican scholars who saw it as a way to distinguish present-day Mexicans from pre-conquest Mexicans. This usage has been the subject of debate in more recent years, and the term "Mexica" is becoming more common.<ref name="Port">{{cite encyclopedia | ency=[http://www.ejournal.unam.mx/cultura_nahuatl/ecnahuatl31/ECN03113.pdf Estudios de la cultura nahuatl] | year=2000 | article=Aztecas, disquisiciones sobre un gentilicio | author= Miguel Leon Portilla}}}</ref>

Nahuatl (nahuatl/nawatlahtolli)
'''Classical Nahuatl''' (also known as '''Aztec''', and simply '''Nahuatl''') is a term used to describe the variants of the [[Nahuatl language]]. The majority of the speakers live in Central Mexico in the states of [[Mexico (state)|Estado de Mexico]] El [[Mexico City|Distrito Federal]], [[Puebla]], [[Tlaxcala]], [[Morelos]], [[Guerrero]], [[Veracruz]], [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]] and [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]]. Other variants of the language "Nahuatl" were spoken by many of the central Mexican city-states under the domination of the Aztec Empire. Nahuatl was originally written with a pictographic script which was not a full writing system but instead served as a mnemonic to remind readers of texts they had learned orally.

==History==
{{main|History of the Aztecs}}
===Migrational Period===
The Nahua peoples began to migrate into Mesoamerica from northern Mexico in the 6th century. They populated central Mexico dislocating speakers of [[Oto-Manguean languages]] as they spread their political influence south. As the former nomadic hunter-gatherer peoples mixed with the complex civilizations of Mesoamerica, adopting religious and cultural practices the foundation for later Aztec culture was laid. During the Postclassic period they rose to power at such sites as [[Tula, Hidalgo]]. In the 12th century the Nahua power center was in [[Azcapotzalco]], from where the Tepanecs dominated the valley of Mexico. Around this time the Mexica tribe arrived in central Mexico.

===Rise of the Triple Alliance===    
[[Image:Lake Texcoco c 1519 .png|thumb|right|300px|The [[Valley of Mexico]] at the time of the [[Spanish Conquest of Mexico|Spanish Conquest]].]] 
The true origin of the Mexicas is uncertain. According to their legends, the Mexica tribe place of origin was [[Aztl<U+00E1>n]]. It is generally thought that Aztl<U+00E1>n was somewhere to the north of the [[Valley of Mexico]]; some experts have placed it as far north as [[Southwestern United States]]. Others however suggest it is a mythical place, since Aztl<U+00E1>n can be translated as "the place of the origin".  The mythical story of these travels is recorded in a number of codices from the Spanish colonial era, most prominently the [[Aubin Codex]] and the [[Aztec codices#Boturini Codex|Boturini Codex]].  

Based on these codices as well as other histories, it appears that the Mexicas arrived at [[Chapultepec]] in or around the year 1248.<ref> Smith, (1984) p. 173.</ref>  

At the time of their arrival, the [[Valley of Mexico]] contained many city-states, the most powerful of which were [[Culhuacan]] to the south and [[Azcapotzalco]] to the west. The [[Tepanec]]s of Azcapotzalco soon expelled the Mexicas from Chapultepec. In 1299, Culhuacan ruler Cocoxtli gave them permission to settle in the empty barrens of Tizapan, where they were eventually assimilated into Culhuacan culture.

In 1323, the Mexicas were shown a vision of an eagle perched on a prickly pear cactus, clutching a snake in its talons. This vision indicated that this was the location where they were to build their home.  In any event, the Mexicas eventually arrived on a small swampy island in Lake Texcoco where they founded the town of [[Tenochtitlan]] in 1325. In 1376, the Mexicas elected their first ''[[Huey Tlatoani]]'', [[Acamapichtli]], who was living in [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]] at the time.

For the next 50 years, until 1427, the Mexica were a tributary of Azcapotzalco, which had become a regional power, perhaps the most powerful since the [[Toltec]]s, centuries earlier. [[Maxtla]], son of [[Tezozomoc]], assassinated [[Chimalpopoca]], the Mexica ruler. In an effort to defeat Maxtla, Chimalpopoca's successor, [[Itzcoatl]], allied with the exiled ruler of [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]], [[Nezahualcoyotl]]. This coalition became the foundation of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]].

[[Image:Jaguar warrior.jpg|thumb|300px|Jaguar warrior, from the [[Aztec codices#Codex Magliabechiano|Codex Magliabechiano]]]]
The Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and [[Tlacopan]] would, in the next 100 years, come to dominate the Valley of Mexico and extend its power to both the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]] shore. Over this period, Tenochtitlan gradually became the dominant power in the alliance.

Two of the primary architects of the Aztec empire were the half-brothers [[Tlacaelel]] and [[Moctezuma I]], nephews of Itzcoatl. Moctezuma I succeeded Itzcoatl as ''Hueyi Tlatoani'' in 1440. Although he was also offered the opportunity to be ''tlatoani'', Tlacaelel preferred to operate as the power behind the throne. Tlacaelel reformed the Aztec state and [[Aztec religion|religion]]. According to some sources, he ordered the burning of most of the extant Aztec books claiming that they contained lies. He thereupon rewrote the history of the Aztec people, thus creating a common awareness of history for the Aztecs. This rewriting led directly to the curriculum taught to scholars and promoted the belief that the Aztecs were always a powerful and mythic nation; forgetting forever a possible true history of modest origins. One component of this reform was the institution of ritual war (the [[flower war]]s) as a way to have trained warriors, and created the necessity of constant sacrifices to keep the Sun moving.

===Spanish conquest===
{{main|Spanish conquest of Mexico}}
The empire reached its height during [[Ahuitzotl]]'s reign, 1486 until 1502.  His successor, Motecuz<U+014D>ma Xocoyotzin (better known as Montezuma or [[Moctezuma II]]), had been ''Hueyi Tlatoani''  for 17 years when [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]] and the Spaniards landed on the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]] in the spring of 1519.  

Despite some early battles between the two, Cort<U+00E9>s allied himself with the Aztecs<U+2019> long-time enemy, the Confederacy of [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]], and arrived at the gates of [[Tenochtitlan]] on November 8, 1519.

The [[Spaniards]] and their [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcallan]] allies became increasingly dangerous and unwelcome guests in the capital city. In June, 1520, hostilities broke out, culminating in [[The massacre in the Main Temple, Tenochtitl<U+00E1>n|the massacre in the Main Temple]] and the death of Montezuma. The Spaniards fled the town on July 1, an episode later characterized as [[La Noche Triste]] (the Sad Night). They and their native allies returned in the spring of 1521 to lay [[Siege of Tenochtitlan|siege to Tenochtitlan]], a battle that ended that August 13 with the destruction of the city. During this period the now crumbling empire went through a rapid line of ruler succession. After the death of [[Moctezuma II]], the empire fell into the hands of severely weakened emperors, such as [[Cuitl<U+00E1>huac]], before eventually being ruled by puppet rulers, such as [[Andr<U+00E9>s de Tapia Motelchiuh]], installed by the Spanish. 

Despite the decline of the Aztec empire, most of the Mesoamerican cultures were intact after the fall of Tenochtitlan. Indeed, the freedom from Aztec domination may have been considered a positive development by most of the other cultures. The upper classes of the Aztec empire were considered noblemen by the Spaniards and generally treated as such initially. All this changed rapidly and the native population were soon forbidden to study by law, and had the status of [[minors]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

The Tlaxcalans remained loyal to their Spanish friends and were allowed to come on other conquests with Cort<U+00E9>s and his men.

===Colonial period population decline===
{{main|Population history of American indigenous peoples}}
[[Image:Aztec Empire c 1519.png|thumb|350px|The '''Aztec Empire''', on the eve of the Spanish Conquest.]]
In 1520-1521, an outbreak of [[smallpox]] swept through the population of Tenochtitlan and was decisive in the [[Siege of Tenochtitlan|fall of the city]]. It is estimated that between 10% and 50% of the population fell victim to this epidemic.

Subsequently, the Valley of Mexico was hit with two more epidemics, smallpox (1545-1548) and [[typhus]] (1576-1581). The Spaniards, to consolidate the diminishing population, merged the survivors from small towns in the Valley of Mexico into bigger ones. This broke the power of the upper classes, but did not dissolve the coherence of the indigenous society in greater Mexico. 

The population before the time of the conquest is unknown and hotly contested,<ref>By one series of estimates, the population before the time of the conquest is estimated at 19 million; by 1550, the estimated population was 4 million and by 1581 less than two million {{Fact|date=June 2007}}</ref> but disease is known to have ravaged the region; thus, the indigenous population of the Valley of Mexico is estimated to have declined by more than 80% in the course of about 60 years.<ref>[http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/orlow-e.html Silent Killers of the New World]</ref>

==Cultural patterns==
===Government===
The Aztec [[Empire]] was an example of an empire that ruled by indirect means.
Like most European empires, it was [[ethnically]] very diverse, but unlike most European empires, it was more a system of tribute than a single system of government. In the theoretical framework of imperial systems posited by Alexander J. Motyl<ref name="motyl">{{cite book

}}</ref> the Aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands, it merely expected tributes to be paid. It was also a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected, for example the southern peripheral zones of [[Xoconochco]] were not in direct contact with the center. The hegemonic nature of the Aztec empire can be seen in the fact that generally local rulers were restored to their positions once their city-state was conquered and the Aztecs did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tribute payments were made.<ref>Berdan, ''et al.'' (1996), Aztec Imperial Strategies. Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, DC</ref>

Although the Aztec form of government is often referred to as an empire, in fact most areas within the empire were organized as city-states, known as [[altepetl]] in Nahuatl. These were small polities ruled by a king (tlatoani) from a legitimate dynasty. The Early Aztec period was a time of growth and competition among altepetl. Even after the empire was formed (1428) and began its program of expansion through conquest, the altepetl remained the dominant form of organization at the local level. The efficient role of the altepetl as a regional political unit was largely responsible for the success of the empire's hegemonic form of control.<ref>Smith, Michael E.(2000), Aztec City-States. In A Comparative Study of Thirty City-State Cultures, edited by [[Mogens Herman Hansen]], pp. 581-595. The Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, Copenhagen.</ref>

===Tribute and trade===
Several pages from the [[Codex Mendoza]] list tributary towns along with the goods they supplied, which included not only luxuries such as feathers, adorned suits, and [[Greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] beads, but more practical goods such as cloth, firewood, and food. Tribute was usually paid twice or four times a year at differing times.<ref>The Codex Mendoza, edited by F. Berdan and P. Anawalt, University of California Press, 1992</ref>

Archaeological excavations in the Aztec-ruled provinces show that incorporation into the empire had both costs and benefits for provincial peoples. On the positive side, the empire promoted commerce and trade, and exotic goods from obsidian to bronze managed to reach the houses of both commoners and nobles. Trade partners included the enemy [[Tarascan state|Tarascan]], a source of [[bronze]] tools and jewelry. On the negative side, imperial tribute imposed a burden on commoner households, who had to increase their work to pay their share of tribute. Nobles, on the other hand, often made out well under imperial rule because of the indirect nature of imperial organization. The empire had to rely on local kings and nobles and offered them privileges for their help in maintaining order and keeping the tribute flowing.<ref>Smith, Life in the Provinces of the Aztec empire, Scientific American, September 1997</ref>

===Economy===
The Aztec [[economy]] was an example of a commercial economy. Several types of money were in regular use. Small purchases were made with cacao beans, which had to be imported from lowland areas. In Aztec marketplaces, a small rabbit was worth 30 beans, a turkey egg cost 3 beans, and a tamale cost a single bean. For larger purchases, standardized lengths of cotton cloth called quachtli were used. There were different grades of quachtli, ranging in value from 65 to 300 cacao beans. One source stated that 20 quachtli could support a commoner for one year in Tenochtitlan. A man could also sell his own daughter as a sexual slave or future religious sacrifice, generally for around 500 to 700 beans. A small gold statue (approximately 0.62 kg / 1.37 lb) cost 250 beans. Money was used primarily in the many periodic markets that were held in each town. A typical town would have a weekly market (every 5 days), while larger cities held markets every day. Cort<U+00E9>s reported that the central market of Tlatelolco, Tenochtitlan's sister city, was visited by 60,000 people daily. Some sellers in the markets were petty vendors; farmers might sell some of their produce, potters sold their vessels, and so on. Other vendors were professional merchants who traveled from market to market seeking profits. The pochteca were specialized merchants organized into exclusive guilds. They made lengthy expeditions to all parts of Mesoamerica, and they served as the judges and supervisors of the Tlatelolco market. Although the economy of Aztec Mexico was commercialized (in its use of money, markets, and merchants), it was not "a capitalist economy because land and labor were not commodities for sale."<ref>(Smith, The Aztecs, 2nd edition, chapter 5)</ref>

===Transportation===
The main contribution of the Aztec rule was a system of communications between the conquered cities. In [[Mesoamerica]], without draft animals for transport (nor, as a result, wheeled vehicles), the roads were designed for travel on foot. Usually these roads were maintained through tribute, and travelers had places to rest and eat and even latrines to use at regular intervals, roughly every 10 or 15 km. Couriers (''paynani'') were constantly travelling along those ways, keeping the Aztecs informed of events, and helping to monitor the integrity of the roads.  Due to the steady surveillance, even women could travel alone, a fact that amazed the Spaniards, as that was not at all possible in Europe since the time of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

After the conquest those roads were no longer subject to maintenance and were lost in time.

===Mythology and religion===
{{main|Aztec religion|Aztec mythology}}

[[Image:Coat of arms of Mexico.svg|thumb|300px|left|The [[Coat of Arms of Mexico]], from Aztec mythology]]

The Mexica made reference to at least two manifestations of the supernatural: ''t<U+0113><U+014D>tl'' and ''t<U+0113>ixiptla''. ''T<U+0113><U+014D>tl'', which the Spaniards and European scholars routinely mistranslated as "god" or "demon", referred rather to an impersonal force that permeated the world. ''T<U+0113>ixiptla'', by contrast, denoted the physical representations ("idols", statues and figurines) of the ''t<U+0113><U+014D>tl'' as well as the human cultic activity surrounding this physical representation. The Mexica "gods" themselves had no existence as distinct entities apart from these ''t<U+0113>ixiptla'' representations of ''t<U+0113><U+014D>tl'' (Boone 1989).  

Veneration of [[Huitzilopochtli]], the personification of the sun and of war, was central to the religious, social and political practices of the Mexicas.<ref>The name Huitzil-opochtli is often translated as "Hummingbird to the Left-Side" or "Hummingbird to the South." However, Nahuatl grammar rules indicate that "Hummingbird" is a modifier of "Left." With this consideration, the name of this figure may be glossed as "The Hummingbird Left-Side," likely referring to the resplendent "left side" of the Sun, seen as it crosses the sky from East to West.</ref> Huitzilopochtli attained this central position after the founding of Tenochtitlan and the formation of the Mexica city-state society in the 14th century. Prior to this, Huitzilopochtli was associated primarily with hunting, presumably one of the important subsistence activities of the itinerant bands that would eventually become the Mexica.  

According to myth, Huitzilopochtli directed the wanderers to found a city on the site where they would see an [[eagle]] devouring a snake perched on a fruit-bearing [[nopal]] cactus. (It was said that Huitzilopochtli killed his nephew, C<U+00F3>pil, and threw his heart on the lake. Huitzilopochtli honoured C<U+00F3>pil by causing a cactus to grow over C<U+00F3>pil's heart.) Legend has it that this is the site on which the Mexicas built their capital city of Tenochtitlan. This legendary vision is pictured on the [[Coat of Arms of Mexico]]. 

According to their own history, when the Mexicas arrived in the [[Anahuac]] valley ([[Valley of Mexico]]) around Lake Texcoco, the groups living there considered them uncivilized. The Mexicas borrowed much of their culture from the ancient [[Toltec]] whom they seem to have at least partially confused with the more ancient civilization of [[Teotihuacan]]. To the Mexicas, the Toltecs were the originators of all culture; "Toltecay<U+014D>tl" was a synonym for culture. Mexica legends identify the Toltecs and the cult of [[Quetzalcoatl]] with the mythical city of [[Tollan]], which they also identified with the more ancient Teotihuacan.

===Human sacrifice===
[[Image:Mendoza HumanSacrifice.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Human sacrifice as shown in the [[Aztec codices#Codex Magliabechiano|Codex Magliabechiano]].]]
{{main|Human sacrifice in Aztec culture}}
For most people today, and for the European Catholics who first met the Aztecs, [[human sacrifice]] was the most striking feature of Aztec civilization. While human sacrifice was practiced throughout Mesoamerica, the Aztecs, if their own accounts are to be believed, brought this practice to an unprecedented level. For example, for the reconsecration of [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]] in 1487, the Aztecs reported that they sacrificed 84,400 prisoners over the course of four days, reportedly by [[Ahuitzotl]], the Great Speaker himself.  

However, most experts consider these numbers to be overstated. For example, the sheer logistics associated with sacrificing 84,000 victims would be overwhelming, 2,000 being a more likely figure. A similar consensus has developed on reports of [[cannibalism]] among the Aztecs.

In the writings of [[Bernardino de Sahag<U+00FA>n]], Aztec "anonymous informants" defended the practice of human sacrifice by asserting that it was not very different from the European way of waging warfare: Europeans killed the warriors in battle, Aztecs killed the warriors after the battle.

Accounts by the Tlaxcaltecas, the primary enemy of the Aztecs at the time of the Spanish Conquest, show that at least some of them considered it an honor to be sacrificed. In one legend, the warrior Tlahuicole was freed by the Aztecs but eventually returned of his own volition to die in ritual sacrifice. [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] also practiced the human sacrifice of captured Aztec warriors.

===Social structures===
{{main|Aztec society|Aztec slavery}}

===Class structure===
[[Image:Aztec5figure9.jpg|thumb|300px|A painting from [[Codex Mendoza]] showing elder Aztecs being given intoxicants.]]
The highest class were the ''p<U+012B>piltin'' or nobility.<ref>singular form ''pilli''</ref> Originally this status was not hereditary, although the sons of ''pillis'' had access to better resources and education, so it was easier for them to become ''pillis''. Later the class system took on hereditary aspects. 

The second class were the ''m<U+0101>cehualtin'', originally peasants.  Eduardo Noguera<ref name="Noguera">''Annals of Anthropology'', UNAM, Vol. xi, 1974, p. 56</ref>
estimates that in later stages only 20% of the population was dedicated to agriculture and food production. The other 80% of society were warriors, artisans and traders. Eventually, most of the ''m<U+0101>cehuallis'' were dedicated to arts and crafts. Their works were an important source of income for the city.<ref name="Sanders>Sanders, William T., ''Settlement Patterns in Central Mexico. Handbook of Middle American Indians'', 1971, vol. 3, p. 3-44.</ref>

[[Slavery|Slaves]] or ''tlacotin'' also constituted an important class. Aztecs could become slaves because of debts, as a criminal punishment or as war captives. A slave could have possessions and even own other slaves. However, upon becoming a slave, all of the slave's animals and excess money would go to his purchaser. Slaves could buy their liberty, and slaves could be set free if they had children with or were married to their masters. Typically, upon the death of the master, slaves who had performed outstanding services were freed. The rest of the slaves were passed on as part of an inheritance.

Traveling merchants called ''[[pochteca]]h'' were a small, but important class as they not only facilitated commerce, but also communicated vital information across the empire and beyond its borders. They were often employed as spies.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Aztec cuisine}}
The Aztec staple foods included [[maize]], [[beans]] and [[squash (vegetable)|squash]] to which were often added chilis and tomatoes, all prominent parts of the Mexican diet to this day. They harvested [[acocil]]s, a small and abundant shrimp of Lake Texcoco, as well as [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]] algae, which was made into a sort of cake rich in [[flavonoid]]s. Although Mesoamerican diet was largely vegetarian the Aztecs consumed insects such as grasshoppers (''[[chapulines]]''), [[maguey worm]], ants, larvae, etc. Insects have a higher protein content than meat, and even now they are considered a delicacy in some parts of Mexico. The only domesticated animals known to the Aztecs were [[Xoloitzcuintle|dogs]] and [[turkey]]s which were also both consumed. Wild game was also a part of the Aztec diet. Aztec elites are known to have consumed human flesh in certain ceremonial contexts but it is dubious that it ever formed an important part of their diet.

Aztecs also used [[Century plant|maguey]] extensively; from it they obtained food, sweetening additives (''aguamiel''<U+2013>"honey water"), fibers for ropes and clothing, and drink ([[pulque]], a fermented beverage with an alcoholic content roughly equivalent to beer, used mainly in ceremonial contexts). 

[[Cacao]] beans were used as money and also to make ''xocolatl'', a frothy and bitter beverage, lacking the sweetness of modern chocolate drinks. The Aztecs also kept beehives and harvested honey. 

A study by Ortiz de  Montellano<ref name="Ortiz de Montellano">Medicina, Nutrici<U+00F3>n y Salud Aztecas, 1997</ref>
shows a mean life expectancy of 37 (<U+00B1>3) years for the population of Mesoamerica. After the Spanish conquest, some foods were outlawed, particularly [[amaranth]] because of its central role in religious rituals.  There was less diversity of food which led to chronic malnutrition in the general population.

===Recreation===
As with all Mesoamerican cultures, the Aztecs played a variant of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], named ''tlachtli'' or ''ollamaliztli'' in Nahuatl. The game was played with a ball of solid [[rubber]], called an ''olli'', whence derives the Spanish word for rubber, ''hule''. The players hit the ball with their hips, knees, and elbows and had to pass the ball through a stone ring to automatically win. The Aztec variant of the Mesoamerican ballgame is the only one to be described in postcolonial sources, and not much is known about how other Mesoamerican peoples played the game. 

The Aztecs also enjoyed board games, like ''[[patolli]]'' and ''totoloque''. Bernal Diaz records that Cort<U+00E9>s and Moctezuma II played ''totoloque'' together.

===Education===
[[Image:Educacion azteca.jpg|thumb|Representation of Aztec education.]]
Until the age of fourteen, the education of children was in the hands of their parents, but supervised by the authorities of their ''calp<U+014D>lli''. Part of this education involved learning a collection of sayings, called ''hu<U+0113>huetl<U+00E0>tolli'' ("sayings of the old"), that embodied the Aztecs' ideals. Judged by their language, most of the ''hu<U+0113>huetlatolli'' seemed to have evolved over several centuries, predating the Aztecs and most likely adopted from other Nahua cultures.

At 15, all boys and girls went to school. The Mexica, one of the Aztec groups, were one of the first people in the world to have mandatory education for nearly all children, regardless of gender, rank, or station. There were two types of schools: the ''telpochcalli'', for practical and military studies, and the ''[[calmecac]]'', for advanced learning in writing, astronomy, statesmanship, theology, and other areas. The two institutions seem to be common to the Nahua people, leading some experts to suggest that they are older than the Aztec culture.

Aztec teachers (''tlatimine'') propounded a spartan regime of education with the purpose of forming a stoical people.

Girls were educated in the crafts of home and child raising. They were not taught to read or write. All women were taught to be involved in religion; there are paintings of women presiding over religious ceremonies, but there are no references to female priests.

===Arts===
[[Image:AztecSerpent.JPG|thumb|300px|This ornament features a turquoise mosaic on a carved wooden base, with red and white shells used for the mouths. Probably worn across the chest, this ornament measures 20 cm by 43 cm (8 in by 17 in).  It was likely created by Mixtec artisans from an Aztec tributary state. 1400-1521, from the [[British Museum]] [http://www.bmimages.com/preview.asp?image=00034381001&imagex=6&searchnum=0001].]]
Song and poetry were highly regarded; there were presentations and poetry contests at most of the Aztec festivals. There were also dramatic presentations that included players, musicians and acrobats.

Poetry was the only occupation worthy of an Aztec warrior in times of peace. A remarkable amount of this poetry survives, having been collected during the era of the conquest. In some cases poetry is attributed to individual authors, such as [[Netzahualcoyotl]], ''tlatoani'' of Texcoco, and [[Cuacuatzin]], Lord of Tepechpan, but whether these attributions reflect actual authorship is a matter of opinion. [[Miguel Le<U+00F3>n-Portilla]], a well-respected Aztec scholar of Mexico, has stated that it is in this poetry where we can find the real thought of the Aztecs, independent of "official" Aztec ideology.<ref>Le<U+00F3>n-Portilla, ''Broken Spears''.</ref>

It is also important to note that the Spanish classified many aspects of the Aztec/Nahuatl culture according to the lexicon and organizational categories with which they would distinguish in Europe.  In the same way that the second letter of Cortez made a mention of "mesquitas", or in English, "mosques", when trying to convey his impression of Aztec architecture, early colonists and missionaries divided the principal bodies of nahuatl literature as "poetry" and "prose". "Poetry" was ''in xochitl in cuicatl'' a dual term meaning "the flower and the song" and was divided into different genres. ''Yaocuicatl'' was devoted to war and the god(s) of war, ''Teocuicatl'' to the gods and creation myths and to adoration of said figures, ''xochicuicatl'' to flowers (a symbol of poetry itself and indicative of the highly metaphorical nature of a poetry that often utilized duality to convey multiple layers of meaning). "Prose" was ''tlahtolli'', also with its different categories and divisions (Garganigo et. al).

[[Image:TurquoiseAztecMask.jpg|thumbnail|250px|left|Turquoise mask. Mixtec-Aztec. 1400-1521.]]
The most important collection of these poems is ''Romances de los se<U+00F1>ores de la Nueva Espa<U+00F1>a'', collected (Tezcoco 1582), probably by [[Juan Bautista de Pomar]].<ref>This volume was later translated into Spanish by [[<U+00C1>ngel Mar<U+00ED>a Garibay K.]], teacher of Le<U+00F3>n-Portilla, and it exists in English translation by John Bierhorst</ref> Bautista de Pomar was the great-grandson of Netzahualcoyotl. He spoke Nahuatl, but was raised a Christian and wrote in Latin characters. (''See also: ''"[[s:Is It You?|Is It You?]]"'', a short poem attributed to Netzahualcoyotl, and ''"[[s:Lament on the Fall of Tenochtitlan|Lament on the Fall of Tenochtitlan]]"'', a short poem contained within the "[[Unos Anales Hist<U+00F3>ricos de la Naci<U+00F3>n Mexicana]]" manuscript.'')

The Aztec people also enjoyed a type of dramatic presentation, a kind of theatre. Some plays were comical with music and acrobats, others were staged dramas of their gods. After the conquest, the first Christian churches had open chapels reserved for these kinds of representations. Plays in Nahuatl, written by converted Indians, were an important instrument for the conversion to Christianity, and are still found today in the form of traditional ''pastorelas'', which are played during Christmas to show the Adoration of Baby Jesus, and other Biblical passages.

===City-building and architecture===
[[Image:Tenoch2A.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Tenochtitlan, looking east. From the mural painting at the National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City. Painted in 1930 by [[Dr. Atl]].]]
The capital city of the Aztec empire was [[Tenochtitlan]], now the site of modern-day [[Mexico City]]. Built on a series of islets in [[Lake Texcoco]], the city plan was based on a symmetrical layout that was divided into four city sections called ''campans''. The city was interlaced with canals which were useful for transportation. 

Tenochtitlan was built according to a fixed plan and centered on the ritual precinct, where the [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]] rose 60 m above the city. Houses were made of wood and loam, roofs were made of reed,<ref name="WP">{{cite encyclopedia | ency=[[Winkler Prins encyclopedia]]| edition=8th ed. | year=1975 | article=Azteken}}}</ref> although pyramids, temples and palaces were generally made of stone.

Around the island, ''[[chinampa]]'' beds were used to grow foodstuffs as well as, over time, to increase the size of the island. ''Chinampas'', misnamed "floating gardens", were long raised plant beds set upon the shallow lake bottom. They were a very efficient agricultural system and could provide up to seven crops a year. On the basis of current chinampa yields, it has been estimated that 1 hectare of chinampa would feed 20 individuals and 9,000 hectares of ''chinampas'' could feed 180,000.<ref name="AA">{{cite encyclopedia | ency=[[Anales de Antropologia,UNAM]]| edition=XI ed. | year=1974 | article=Sitios de Ocupacion de la periferia de Tenochtitlan | author= Eduardo Noguera}}}</ref>

Anthropologist Eduardo Noguera estimates the population at 200,000 based in the house count and merging the population of Tlatelolco (once an independent city, but later became a suburb of Tenochtitlan). If one includes the surrounding islets and shores surrounding Lake Texcoco, estimates range from 300,000 to 700,000 inhabitants.<ref name="AA" />

==Relationship to other Mesoamerican cultures==
Aztecs admired Mixtec craftsmanship so much that they imported artisans to Tenochtitlan and requested work to be done in certain Mixtec styles. The Aztecs also admired the Mixtec codices, so some of them were made to order by Mixteca for the Aztecs. In the later days, high society Aztec women started to wear Mixtec clothing, specifically the ''quexquemetl''. It was worn over their traditional ''huipil'', and much coveted by the women who could not afford such imported goods.  

The situation was analogous in many ways to the [[Phoenicia]]n culture which imported and duplicated art from other cultures that they encountered. For this reason, archeologists often have trouble identifying which artifacts are genuinely Phoenician and which are imported or copied from other cultures.

Archaeologists usually do not have a problem differentiating between Mixtec and Aztec artifacts.  However, the Mixtec made some products for "export" and that makes classification more problematic. In addition, the production of craft was an important part of the Mexica economy, and they also made pieces for "export".

==Legacy==
Most modern day Mexicans (and people of Mexican descent in other countries) are mestizos, of mixed indigenous and European Spanish ancestry. During the 16th century the racial composition of Mexico began to change from one that featured distinct indigenous (Mexicas and members of the many other Mexican indigenous groups) and immigrant (mostly Spanish) populations, to the population composed primarily of mestizos that is found in modern day Mexico.

The [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] language is today spoken by 1.5 million people, mostly in mountainous areas in the states of central Mexico. Local dialects of Spanish, Mexican Spanish generally, and the Spanish language worldwide have all been influenced, in varying degrees, by Nahuatl. Some Nahuatl words (most notably ''chocolate'' and ''tomato'') have been borrowed through Spanish into other languages around the world.

[[Mexico City]] was built on the ruins of Tenochtitlan, making it  one of the oldest living cities of America. Many of its districts and natural landmarks retain their original Nahuatl names. Many other cities and towns in Mexico and Central America have also retained their Nahuatl names (whether or not they were originally Mexica or even Nahuatl-speaking towns). A number of town names are hybrids of Nahuatl and Spanish.

[[Mexican cuisine]] continues to be based on and flavored by agricultural products contributed by the Mexicas/Aztecs and Mesoamerica, most of which retain some form of their original Nahuatl names. The cuisine has also become a popular part of the cuisine of the United States and other countries around the world, typically altered to suit various national tastes.

The modern Mexican flag bears the emblem of the Mexica migration legend.

Mexico's premier religious icon, the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] has certain similarities to the Mexica earth mother goddess Tonantzin.

For the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] Adidas designed the official match ball to show in its "triades" Aztec architectural and mural designs [http://www.soccerballworld.com/Azteca1986.htm].

==Modern views of the Aztec culture==
[[Laurette S<U+00E9>journ<U+00E9>]], a French anthropologist, wrote about Aztec and Mesoamerican spirituality. Her depiction of the Aztecs as a spiritual people was so compelling that new religions have been formed based on her writings. Some parts of her work have been adopted by esoteric groups, searching for occult teachings of the pre-Columbian religions. S<U+00E9>journ<U+00E9> never endorsed any of these groups. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}  

[[Miguel Le<U+00F3>n-Portilla]] also idealizes the Aztec culture, especially in his early writings. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Others, such as Antonio Velazco, have transformed the writings by Sejourn<U+00E9> and Le<U+00F3>n-Portilla into a religious movement. Antonio Velasco Pi<U+00F1>a has written three books, ''Tlacaelel, El Azteca entre los Aztecas'', ''La mujer dormida debe dar a luz'', and ''Regina''. When mixed with the currents of Neopaganism, these books resulted in a new religious movement called "Mexicanista". This movement called for a return to the spirituality of the Aztecs. It is argued that, with this return, Mexico will become the next center of power.  This religious movement mixes Mesoamerican cults with [[Hindu]] esoterism. The Mexicanista movement reached the peak of its popularity in the 1990s.

== Discussion of primary sources ==
[[Image:Tlaloc, Codex Rios, p.20r.JPG|thumb|250px|A painting of [[Tlaloc]], as shown on page 20R of [[Codex Rios]].]]
Each of the historical sources has its own unique problems. None of the sources is free from bias and every source must be viewed with some skepticism until cross-checked against other contemporary sources or the archaeological records.  

===Aztec codices===
There are few extant [[Aztec codices]] created before the conquest and these are largely ritual texts.  Post-conquest codices, like [[Codex Mendoza]] or [[Codex Rios]], were painted by Aztec ''tlacuilos'' (codex creators), but under the control of Spanish authorities. The possibility of Spanish influence poses potential problems for those studying the post-conquest codices.

===The conquistadors===
The accounts of the conquistadors are those of men confronted with a new civilization, which they tried to interpret according to their own culture. Cort<U+00E9>s was the most educated, and his letters to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] are a valuable firsthand account. Unfortunately, one of his letters is lost and replaced by a posterior text and the others were censored prior their publication. In any case, Cort<U+00E9>s was not writing a dispassionate account, but letters justifying his actions and to some extent exaggerating his successes and downplaying his failures.

[[Bernal D<U+00ED>az del Castillo]] accompanied Cortes, but he wrote decades after the fact, he never learned the native languages, and he did not take notes. His account is colorful, but his work is considered erratic and exaggerated.  

Although [[Francisco L<U+00F3>pez de G<U+00F3>mara]] was Cortes' chaplain, friend, and confidant, he never visited the New World so his account is based on hearsay.

===Priests and scholars===
The accounts of the first priests and scholars, while reflecting their faith and their culture, are important sources. Fathers [[Diego Dur<U+00E1>n]], [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia|Motolinia]], and [[Geronimo d Mendieta|Mendieta]] wrote with their own religion in mind, Father Duran wrote trying to prove that the Aztec were one of the lost tribes of Israel. [[Bartolom<U+00E9> de las Casas]] wrote instead from an apologetic point of view. There are also  authors that tried to make a synthesis of the pre-Hispanic cultures, like "Oviedo y Herrera", Jose de Acosta, and Pedro M<U+00E1>rtir de Anghera.  

Perhaps the most important source about the Aztec are the manuscripts of [[Bernardino de Sahag<U+00FA>n]], who worked with the surviving Aztec wise men. He taught Aztec ''tlacuilos'' to write the original Nahuatl accounts using the [[Latin alphabet]]. Because of fear of the Spanish authorities, he maintained the anonymity of his informants, and wrote a heavily censored version in Spanish. Unfortunately the Nahuatl original was not fully translated until the 20th century, thus realising the extent of the censorship of the Spanish version. The original Nahuatl manuscript is known as the [[Florentine Codex]].

===Native authors===
Other important sources are the work of Indian and mestizo authors, descendants of the upper classes.  These authors include Don [[Fernando Alvarado Tezoz<U+00F3>moc]], [[Chimalpahin Quauhtlehuanitzin|Chimalpahin Cuauhtlehuanitzin]], [[Juan Bautista de Pomar]], and [[Fernando de Alva Cort<U+00E9>s Ixtlilxochitl]]. Ixtlixochitl, for example, wrote a history of Texcoco from a Christian point of view.  His account of [[Netzahualcoyotl]], an ancestor of Ixtlilxochitl's, has a strong resemblance to the story of King Solomon and portrays Netzahualcoyotl as a monotheist and a critic of human sacrifice.  

[[Diego Mu<U+00F1>oz Camargo]] (1521 - c. 1612), a Tlaxcalan [[mestizo]], wrote the ''[[History of Tlaxcala]]'' six decades after the Spanish conquest.  Some parts of his work have a strong Tlaxcala bias.
