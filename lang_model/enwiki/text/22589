'''James Joseph Leyritz''' (born December 27, 1963 in [[Lakewood, Ohio]]) is a former [[catcher]] and [[infielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]].

==Career==
Leyritz played for the [[New York Yankees]] (1990<U+2013>1996, 1999<U+2013>2000), with whom he debuted on June 8, {{By|1990}}. He played for the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]] (1997), [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] (1997), [[Boston Red Sox]] (1998), [[San Diego Padres]] (1998) and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (2000), pinch-hitting more extensively toward the end of his career. He batted and threw right-handed exclusively in the majors, but was known to switch-hit in the [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]]. He is best known for his 3-run [[home run]] off [[Atlanta Braves]] closer [[Mark Wohlers]] in Game 4 of the [[1996 World Series]]. That home run was significant, as the momentum from then on shifted towards the Yankees. "The King" is known for hitting the last home run of the 1990s in Game 4 of the [[1999 World Series]]. He attended [[Turpin High School (Hamilton County, Ohio)|Turpin High School]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], Middle Georgia Jr. College (Cochran, GA) and the University of Kentucky.

===Idiosyncrasies at the plate===
Leyritz was known for using an unusual stance which involved keeping his front leg (left leg) straight and stiff while his back leg (right leg) behind him considerably bent at the knee. He did this while circling his bat around behind his head, waiting for the pitch. After each pitch that Leyritz did not put into play or strike out on, he would grab the bat by its center and twirl it at his hip like a baton.

===Playoff reputation and exploits===
Leyritz is best known for hitting numerous postseason home runs that either won, tied, or changed the momentum of several series. 

In Game 2 of the [[1995 American League Division Series]] against the [[Seattle Mariners]] at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], Leyritz hit an opposite field two-run home run to right-center into the rain in the 15th inning to win that game 7&ndash;5 for the Yankees and provided them with an ample 2&ndash;0 series lead in the best-of-five series. The home run came off Mariners pitcher [[Tim Belcher]], who was famously involved in a [[profanity]]-laced and threatening incident with a cameraman covering him walking through the [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] tunnel after giving up the home run. The Yankees would eventually squander the series lead by losing the following three games in Seattle's [[Kingdome]], the final two of which were decided in highly dramatic fashion. (The Mariners won Game 5 by a score of 6&ndash;5 with two runs in the bottom of the 11th inning.) As a result, this home run is not as well known because it ultimately did not change the series outcome.

The best known of Leyritz's playoff heroics occurred in Game 4 of the [[1996 World Series]] against the Atlanta Braves at [[Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium]]. The Yankees had lost the first two games of the series at home, and narrowly won Game 3 in Atlanta. Game 4 appeared to be going to the Braves, who led 6-0 after 5 innings. The Yankees rallied for 3 runs in the 6th, setting the stage for Leyritz in the 8th inning. Leyritz stepped up with one out and two men on base and hit a three-run home run to left field to tie the game and cap the improbable Yankee comeback. The home run was hit against Atlanta closer [[Mark Wohlers]] and the Yankees eventually won the game 8&ndash;6 in 10 innings. Leyritz's Game 4 home run remains the most recognizable moment of that series and of his career.

In {{By|1998}}, Leyritz  was on the [[San Diego Padres]]. Leyritz hit a number of unlikely playoff home runs and clutch hits that season, the most dramatic of which was an opposite field home run to right off the foul pole in the top of the 9th inning in the [[Reliant Astrodome|Astrodome]] that tied Game 2 of the [[1998 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] against the [[Houston Astros]]. However, the Astros would later win the game in the bottom of the ninth. In game 3, Leyritz hit the eventually game-winning home run in the bottom of the 7th inning that broke a 1&ndash;1 tie. Overall, Leyritz batted .400 with three home runs and five RBIs in that Division Series. Ironically, Leyritz's Padres would go up against his former team, the Yankees in the [[1998 World Series|World Series]]. The Padres were swept in four games and Leyritz did not record a home run or RBI in any game. 

In {{By|1999}}, Leyritz had rejoined the Yankees and hit a solo home run in the bottom of the 8th inning of Game 4 of the [[1999 World Series|World Series]]. The home run made the score 4&ndash;1. [[NBC]] commentator [[Bob Costas]] remarked incredulously about Leyritz after the home run:

{{cquote|You could send this guy to a resort in the spring and summer, as long as he comes back for October.}}
This was the home run known as the last of the 1990s since it was the final Major League Baseball game of the {{By|1999}} postseason.

==Controversies==
===Amphetamine use===
On June 8, 2006, while doing an interview on the [[Opie and Anthony]] show on [[XM]] Satellite Radio, Leyritz admitted to using [[amphetamines]] after his shoulder surgery in 2001. The statement came in the wake of an admission by pitcher [[Jason Grimsley]] that he used performance enhancing drugs throughout his career.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2476681&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines ESPN - Ex-Yankee Leyritz admits to using amphetamines - MLB<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
===Legal trouble===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:!Leyritzmug1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Leyritz's mug shot.]] -->
On December 28, 2007, Leyritz was arrested in [[Broward County, Florida]] on suspicion of [[drunk driving]] and [[vehicular homicide]] in which Leyritz's car struck Fredia Veitch's car. Veitch, who was returning home from her bartending job, was not wearing a seat belt. She ejected from the car and died at the scene.

Leyritz was released on [[United States dollar|$]]11,000 bond and charged with two counts of drunk driving.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3171228 ESPN - Leyritz charged following accident that killed 30-year-old woman - MLB<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Police collected two blood samples from Leyritz - one 2<U+00BD> hours after the crash and the other about an hour later. The first sample showed a blood-alcohol level of .14, and the second, .13, police said. Florida's legal limit for motorists is .08. Prosecutors say Veitch had a blood-alcohol level of .18.
 
Several days after the accident, it was revealed that Leyritz may face further charges because he had his license suspended in [[New York]] prior to the accident. On June 20, 2007, Leyritz was ticketed outside [[Albany, New York]] for using a cell phone while driving. On November 23, his license was suspended after he failed to appear in court. The state of Florida is processing the suspension notice from New York and could file additional charges once his Florida license is suspended. According to an official from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles: "The department has the statutory ability to suspend his license based on the fact he had knowledge of a suspension in another state and still came to Florida for a driver's license. It is unlawful." Leyritz's lawyer is quoted as saying that Leyritz's license "was not suspended in the state of Florida on the day of the accident, nor is it suspended today."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3177369

On February 13, 2009, Leyritz was ordered back to jail as his bail was revoked following his apparent consumption of alcoholic beverages in violation with his bail conditions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3905755 | title=Leyritz jailed for drinking alcohol | publisher=[[ESPN.com]] | date=2009-02-13 | accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> A judge allowed him to return home on bail on February 23 after agreeing with Leyritz's attorney that his pretrial release conditions were unclear and that Leyritz had misunderstood rather than intentionally violated the terms.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/baseball/mlb/02/23/leyritz.crash.ap/index.html Leyritz To Remain Out of Jail While Awaiting Trial] SI.com, February 23, 2009{{dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref>

On May 13, 2009, Leyritz was hospitalized in Florida. Reports on [[ESPN]] claimed Leyritz had threatened suicide, but Leyritz issued a statement later saying he was not suicidal but stressed out. Leyritz ran into trouble on May 14 when he attempted to start his car but the alcohol monitoring device on the car malfunctioned, leading to a false positive and triggering an automatic urine test for Leyritz. The test showed he had not consumed any alcohol and a judge cleared him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4171349|title= Leyritz was 'stressed out'}}</ref>

On July 2, 2009, Leyritz was arrested for battery.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2009/07/02/Ex-Yankee-Leyritz-accused-of-battery/UPI-49781246563847/ Ex-Yankee Leyritz accused of battery] UPI.com, July 2, 2009 (UPI)</ref>

On November 1, 2010, Leyritz's trial for the December 2007 DUI crash began.  If convicted, he faces a sentence of four to 15 years in prison.<ref>http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/broward/fort-lauderdale/fl-ex-yankee-leyritz-trial-begins-20101101,0,6983233.story</ref>  On November 20, Leyritz was acquitted of DUI Manslaughter, but was convicted of driving under the influence, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail.<ref>"[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5829184 Jim Leyritz acquitted of DUI manslaughter in Florida]".  Associated Press.  November 20, 2010.</ref>
