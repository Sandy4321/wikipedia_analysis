'''''Riven''''' is a [[point-and-click]] [[adventure game|adventure]] [[personal computer game|computer game]], the [[sequel]] to ''[[Myst]]''. Developed by [[Cyan Worlds]], it was initially published by [[Br<U+00F8>derbund]]. ''Riven'' was distributed on five compact discs and released on October 29, 1997 in [[North America]]; it was later released on a single DVD-ROM, with improved audio and a fourteen-minute "[[making-of]]" video.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|date=1998-08-17|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/060/060078p1.html|title=News Briefs: Duke Movie news; Broderbund tackles DVD, and Simon & Schuster picks the Pink Panther|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref> In addition to the PC versions, ''Riven'' was [[Porting|ported]] to several other platforms, including the [[PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]].

The story of ''Riven'' is set immediately after the events of ''Myst''. Having been rescued from the efforts of his sons, the main non-player protagonist [[Atrus]] enlists the help of the [[player character]] to free his wife from his power-hungry father [[Characters of Myst#Gehn|Gehn]]. Unlike ''Myst'', which took place on several worlds known as Ages, linked together by special books, ''Riven'' takes place almost entirely on the Age of Riven, a world slowly falling apart due to Gehn's destructive rule.

Development of ''Riven'' began soon after ''Myst'' became a success, and spanned more than three years. In an effort to create a visual style distinct from that of ''Myst'', director [[Robyn Miller]] and his brother, producer [[Rand Miller]] recruited former ''[[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]]'' [[production designer]] [[Richard Vander Wende]] as a co-director. Br<U+00F8>derbund employed a [[United States dollar|US$]]10&nbsp;million advertising campaign to publicize the game's release.<ref name="business week-more magic"/>

''Riven'' was praised by professional reviewers, with the magazine ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' proclaiming that the game approaches the level of [[art]].<ref name="riven rapt"/> Critics positively noted the puzzles and immersive experience of the gameplay, though publications such as ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' felt that the nature of point-and-click gameplay limited the title heavily.<ref name="edge riven"/> The best-selling [[1997 in video gaming|game of 1997]], ''Riven'' sold 1.5&nbsp;million copies in one year.<ref name="myst is riven"/> After the game's release, the [[Miller Brothers|Miller brothers]] drifted apart, with Robyn Miller forming his own development studio while the older brother, Rand, stayed at Cyan and continued to work on ''Myst''-related products,<ref name="myst is riven"/> including the novel ''[[Myst: The Book of D'ni]]''. The next entry in the ''Myst'' series, ''[[Myst III: Exile]]'', was developed by [[Presto Studios]], and published by [[Ubisoft]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Riven-prison.png|thumb|left|A screenshot of ''Riven'', showing one of the five islands that make up the Age of Riven. The graphics and visuals of ''Riven'' were critically praised upon release.]]
Like its predecessor, ''Riven'' is a [[point-and-click]] adventure game played from a [[first-person narrative|first-person]] perspective. The player explores immersive, [[prerendering|prerendered]] environments using [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] clicks for movement.<ref name="play">{{cite book|title=Riven: The Sequel to Myst - User's Manual|publisher=[[Br<U+00F8>derbund]]|author=[[Cyan Worlds|Cyan]]|year=1997|edition=[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version|pages=9<U+2013>10|series="Playing the Game"}}</ref> By operating mechanical contraptions and [[cryptanalysis|deciphering]] codes and symbols discovered in the surroundings, the vaguely explained goal can eventually be reached.<ref name="nyt-personal computers">{{cite news|author=Maines, Stephen|date=1997-11-04|url=<!--http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2DF1230F937A35752C1A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all-->|title=Riven Picks Up Where Best-Selling Myst Left Off|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

To navigate the world, the player simply clicks in the direction they want to walk or turn. The [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] changes in appearance, depending on its position on the [[Display device|screen]] and what it is hovering over, to show what effect clicking will have.<ref name="play"/>  For instance, if the player positions the cursor hand near the side of the screen, it may show a pointing finger, indicating that clicking will turn the view in that direction.<ref name="play"/> The cursor also changes in context to show when players can drag or toggle switches, or when certain [[Item (game)#Items in adventure games|item]]s can be picked up and carried.<ref name="play2">{{cite book|title=Riven: The Sequel to Myst - User's Manual|publisher=[[Br<U+00F8>derbund]]|author=[[Cyan Worlds|Cyan]]|year=1997|edition=[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version|pages=11<U+2013>12|series="Manipulating Objects"}}</ref> Such items can then be examined at any time,<ref name="play2"/><ref name="gamespot preview"/> and either reveal clues to puzzles or provide information on the game's setting and story.  Like ''Myst'', ''Riven'' has an optional method of navigation known as ''Zip Mode'', which allows players to skip to areas already explored, but may cause them to miss important clues.<ref name="play"/> 

Whereas in ''Myst'' the objective of the game is to travel to different Ages to solve puzzles before returning to a "hub Age", ''Riven''{{'}}s gameplay takes place on the five islands of the Age of Riven. Much of it consists of solving puzzles to access new areas of the islands, though players are also able to explore without fulfilling objectives.<ref name="gamespot preview"/> Many puzzles' sole purpose is to advance the backstory.<ref name="making of riven"/>

==Plot==
''Riven''{{'}}s story continues where ''[[Myst]]'' and its companion novel, ''[[Myst: The Book of Atrus]]'', left off. The player assumes the role of the [[Characters of Myst#The Stranger|Stranger]], the protagonist of the first game and friend of [[Characters of Myst#Atrus|Atrus]]. Atrus is the creator of "linking books" that serve as [[Portals in fiction|portals]] to other worlds, known as "Ages"; the ability to write these books is known as the "Art".<ref name="washingtonpost-plot">{{cite news|author=Streitfeld, David|date=1997-11-01|title=Another Myst Opportunity; With Riven, Fans Can Click On, and On, and On|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|page=C1}}</ref> Atrus needs the Stranger's help to free his wife, [[Characters of Myst#Catherine|Catherine]], who is held hostage on the slowly collapsing Age of Riven. Her captor is [[Characters of Myst#Gehn|Gehn]], Atrus' manipulative father and self-appointed ruler of Riven. Gehn is himself trapped on Riven, as Atrus and Catherine had previously removed all linking books from the Age; the very last book to be removed, linking to the [[Ages of Myst#Myst Island|Age of Myst]], was the one they held to escape Riven. In the misbelief that it would be destroyed, they let the book fall into the Star Fissure, a rift leading out of the damaged Age of Riven into a mysterious, [[Wormholes in fiction|spacelike void]]. Catherine was later tricked into returning to Riven by her sons, whereupon she was taken hostage by Gehn. Eventually, the Stranger discovered the unharmed Myst book, sparking the events of ''Myst'' and, some time later, ''Riven''.<ref name="washingtonpost-plot"/>

At the beginning of ''Riven'', Atrus equips the Stranger with a trap book<U+2014>a snare that functions as a one-man prison, yet looks identical to a linking book<U+2014>and his personal diary. This diary summarizes the history of events leading to the Stranger's present situation; Atrus cannot explain in depth, as he is engaged in rewriting the descriptive book of Riven, in an attempt to slow its deterioration. The Stranger must enter the Age with no way of leaving, as they cannot risk sending a real linking book to Riven until Gehn is safely imprisoned, in case he should seize the book and use it to escape his confinement. <ref name="gamespot preview">{{cite web|author=Muldoon, Moira|date=1997-10-31|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/riven/|title=Featured Preview: Riven|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref> Instructing the Stranger to capture Gehn in the trap book, find Catherine, and then signal him, Atrus holds out the link book that will transport the Stranger to Riven.

Once there, the Stranger explores the islands of Riven, eventually finding Catherine's prison. The Stranger also travels to the Age of the Moiety, rebellious inhabitants of Riven who, under the leadership of Catherine, are attempting to overthrow Gehn's rule. Because of the decay of Riven's structure, the only way to clearly signal Atrus is to bring about a massive disturbance in the Age's stability<U+2014>accomplished by reopening the Star Fissure, which Gehn had closed. When it opens, Atrus immediately links to Riven to investigate, and meets the Stranger at the brink of the Fissure. Depending on the player's actions, the ending to ''Riven'' [[alternate ending|varies]]. In the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] ending, the Stranger tricks Gehn into the prison book and releases Catherine. Atrus and Catherine thank the Stranger, before linking back to the Age of Myst. The Stranger then falls into the Star Fissure, to be taken on the path back to his world. Different player actions can result in the Stranger's entrapment in the prison book, or even his [[Game over|death]].

==Development==
Cyan started working on ''Riven'' [[1993 in video gaming|in 1993]], immediately after ''Myst''{{'}}s release. Before development began, when even the name of the game was undecided, the brothers [[Miller Brothers|Robyn and Rand Miller]] said they wanted a "natural flow" from the first game to the sequel.<ref name="cnn - fans">{{cite web|author=Baxter, Steve; Nelson, Brian |date=1997-10-31|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9710/31/riven/index.html|title=Fans say Riven release lives up to hype|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> As ''Myst'' proved to be a popular and commercial success, the two developers were able to expand their four-person team to a much larger crew of designers, artists, programmers, and sound designers.<ref name="making of riven">{{cite video|people=[[Miller Brothers]], Cyan|date=1997|title=The Making of Riven: The Sequel to Myst| publisher=[[Cyan Worlds|Cyan]]/[[Br<U+00F8>derbund]]|  medium|[[CD-ROM]]|format=}}</ref> Development spanned more than four years, and was a much larger undertaking than for the first game;<ref name="making of riven"/> ''Riven'' had a budget of between [[United States dollar|US$]]5&nbsp;and $10&nbsp;million, more than ten times the cost of developing ''Myst''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Takashi, Dean|date=1997-08-26|title=Can Myst's Sequel Live Up to Expectations?|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref>

The design for ''Riven'' stemmed from a desire to create something different and more dynamic than the [[Romanticism|romantic]] style of ''Myst''. The first stage of development was to create the puzzles, in an attempt to integrate them as smoothly as possible into the areas in the game. The Millers met their co-designer, [[Richard Vander Wende]], at a demonstration of ''Myst'' for the Digital World Expo in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name="making of riven"/> Wende had previously worked for [[Industrial Light & Magic|ILM]],<ref name="making of riven"/> and at [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] as a designer for the animated feature ''[[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]]''.<ref name="driven">{{cite journal|author=Carroll, John|year=1997|month=September|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.09/riven.html|title=(D)Riven|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|issue=9|volume=5|pages=1<U+2013>15}}</ref> As the third member of ''Riven''{{'}}s conceptual team, Wende ended up contributing what Robyn Miller described as an "edgier" and complementary vision, that made the game dramatically different than its predecessor.<ref name="making of riven"/>

As in ''Myst'', the topology of the islands was originally created as grayscale images, where brightness corresponded to elevation.<ref name="making of riven"/><ref name="driven"/> In [[Autodesk Softimage|Softimage]], these maps were turned into the terrain models seen in the game.<ref name="driven"/><ref name="computergraphicsworld">{{cite journal|author=Forcade, Tim|year=1998|month=February|title=Unraveling Riven|journal=Computer Graphics World}}</ref> The large island objects were broken apart to facilitate efficient rendering, which required them to be created using polygonal geometry.<ref name="computergraphicsworld"/> All other objects were modeled using [[B-spline]]s and [[Nonuniform_rational_B-spline|NURBS]].<ref name="computergraphicsworld"/>

Many of the [[texture mapping|textures]] were accumulated during a three-day trip to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. The artists took hundreds of photos of wood, adobe, sand, stucco and other materials, which were treated in [[Photoshop]] before being mapped onto the [[3D modeling|3D geometry]].<ref name="making of riven"/><ref name="computergraphicsworld"/> Whereas many [[computer graphics|computer-generated]] environments of the time ended up looking smooth, like plastic,<ref name="making of riven"/> the Millers and Wende developed a more gritty and weathered design, with corroded and aged elements, to imply reality.<ref name="making of riven"/><ref name="driven"/> The artists considered how objects would look and function if they were real, where and how they would be worn, and created corresponding details.<ref name="computergraphicsworld"/> While [[bump map]]s were occasionally used to simulate geometry, even small details such as screws were often individually modeled.<ref name="computergraphicsworld"/>

Rendering was executed in [[Mental Ray]], using numerous custom-made [[shader]]s to produce lifelike lighting, water and landscapes.<ref name="computergraphicsworld"/> In total ''Riven'' has over three hours of video<ref name="driven"/> and almost five thousand images;<ref name="making of riven"/> rendering was a major bottleneck in production despite the use of 18 dedicated [[workstation]]s.<ref name="computergraphicsworld"/> Some scenes consisted of tens of thousands of individual models and textures and more than a hundred virtual light sources. Loading a single island model could take two hours.<ref name="computergraphicsworld"/> Runtime animation effects were created by Mark DeForest, to add flying insects and simple water ripples.<ref name="computergraphicsworld"/>

''Riven'' combined the pre-rendered backgrounds with [[live action]] footage, in order to increase the player's immersion level.<ref name="making of riven"/><ref name="gamespot preview"/> ''Riven'' was the first game in which any of its designers had directed live actors, and Wende was apprehensive about their use.<ref name="making of riven"/> Rand Miller had to reprise his role of [[Atrus]] from ''Myst'', even though he hated acting.<ref name="driven"/> All the actors were filmed with a blue screen as a backdrop, which was removed in post-production by [[chroma key]], so that the actors would blend into the virtual environment.<ref name="driven"/> Real world stairs, doorways and studio lights had to be meticulously positioned on the live stage to match their CG equivalents. Some sequences were seamlessly cut together with [[morphing]], to allow for partial variations due to the [[Linearity (video games)|nonlinearity]] of the gameplay.<ref name="computergraphicsworld"/>

At the time of ''Riven''{{'}}s development, publisher [[Br<U+00F8>derbund]] was facing falling revenues as development costs rose. Br<U+00F8>derbund's stock dropped from $60 a share to $22 [[1996 in video gaming|in 1996]], causing a delay in the publishing of ''Riven''.<ref name="business week-more magic" /> Even though ''Riven''{{'}}s sales were expected to be higher than any other game [[1997 in video gaming|that holiday season]], Br<U+00F8>derbund launched a $10&nbsp;million marketing campaign<ref name="business week-more magic">{{cite web|author=Browder, Seanna|date=1997-10-06|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1997/40/b3547133.htm|title=More Magic From the Makers of 'Myst'?|work=[[BusinessWeek]]|accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> and developed a retail marketing partnership with [[Toshiba]] America.<ref>{{cite news|author=Winkler, Eric|title=Riven: The Sequel to Myst Tops 1 Million Units Sold Through to Consumers in North America|publisher=[[Business Wire]]|date=1998-03-08}}</ref> Anticipation for the game was high even among non-gamers, helped by web-based word of mouth and well-placed media coverage.<ref name="nyt-personal computers"/><ref name="boston globe-riven door">{{cite news|author=Saunders, Michael|date=1997-11-09|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|title=Riven opens door to mystical world}}</ref>

===Audio===
Robyn Miller composed ''Riven''{{'}}s music, which was later packaged and released by [[Virgin Records]] as ''Riven: The Soundtrack''. Miller designed the liner notes and packaging, which included English translations of the [[conlang|language found in the game]].<ref name="Houston Chronicle-riven ost">{{cite news|author=Schein, Amy|date=1998-02-01|title=Out of the Myst comes Riven, the soundtrack|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]}}</ref> Whereas the music to ''Myst'' was, at first, only available by mail-order from Cyan, Virgin Records had bought the rights to release it initially, prompting Miller to make sure that it could stand alone in CD form.<ref name="denver post-sound">{{cite news|author=Thomas, David|date=1998-05-08|title=Mastermind of Myst, Riven also has a talent for music|work=[[The Denver Post]]}}</ref> The compact disc was released on February 24, 1998, with 54&nbsp;minutes of music.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Riven: The Sequel to Myst|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dxfexq9jldae|accessdate=2010-01-13}}</ref>

Miller established three [[leitmotif]]s for the game's three central characters, Atrus, Catherine, and Gehn.<ref name="riven notes">{{cite album-notes |authorlink=Robyn Miller |last=Miller |first=Robyn |notestitle=Introduction |year=1997 |title=Riven: The Soundtrack |publisher=[[Virgin Records]]}}</ref> Gehn's theme is only heard in its complete form near the end of the game, but portions of the melody can be heard throughout Riven, highlighting his control of the Age.<ref name="virgin product">{{cite web|author=Virgin Records America|year=1997|url=http://www.virginrecords.com/riven/|title=Riven: The Soundtrack product page|work=[[Virgin Records]]|accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref> Miller tried to let the environment dictate the resulting sound, in order to make the music as immersive as possible.<ref name="Houston Chronicle-riven ost"/> He blended live instrumentation with [[synthesizer]]s: "By mixing and matching conventional instrumentation, you can create an odd, interesting mood," Miller said. Ultimately, he wanted the music of ''Riven'' to reflect the game itself, which he described as having "a familiar-yet-strange feel to it."<ref name="riven notes"/>

Miller described his biggest challenge in writing ''Riven''{{'}}s music as reconciling the linear, pleasing construction of music with the [[Linearity (video games)|nonlinearity]] of the gameplay. As players can freely explore all areas, Miller explained in an interview, "the music can't say anything too specific. If it says something, if it builds in intensity and there starts to be a climax, and people are just standing in a room looking around, and they're thinking 'What's going on in here? Is something about to jump out from behind me?' You can't have the basic parts of music that you'd like to have, you can't have a basic structure. It's all got to be just flowing, and continue to flow."<ref name="denver post-sound"/> [[Allmusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] argued that the soundtrack is "appealingly atmospheric", but "lacks definition", and that the music loses impact when separated from the game.<ref name="AMG" />

Nevertheless, several publications found fault with aspects of ''Riven''. ''Computer Gaming World'' felt that the gameplay was too similar to the original ''Myst'', making ''Riven'' the "same game with a new title"; the magazine also criticized the minimal character interaction.<ref name="cvg"/> Gaming magazine ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' felt that although ''Riven'' was a good game, the solitary atmosphere and lack of mobility was steadily becoming outdated, as games like ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' sacrificed graphical fidelity for an increase in freedom.
