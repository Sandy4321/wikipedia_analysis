The '''2006 Pacific hurricane season''' was the most active since [[2000 Pacific hurricane season|2000]], which also produced 19&nbsp;[[tropical cyclone|tropical storms]] or hurricanes.<ref name="epachurdat"/> Eighteen developed within the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) area of warning responsibility, which is east of [[140th meridian west|140<U+00B0>W]], and one storm formed between [[140th meridian west|140<U+00B0>W]] and the [[International Date Line]], which is under the jurisdiction of the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] (CPHC). Of the 19&nbsp;total storms, eleven became hurricanes, of which six attained [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane status]]. Within the NHC portion of the basin, the season officially began on May&nbsp;15, and in the CPHC portion, it started on June&nbsp;1; the season officially ended on November&nbsp;30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern [[Pacific hurricane|Pacific basin]].

The strongest storm of the season was [[Hurricane Ioke]], which reached [[List of Category 5 Pacific hurricanes|Category 5]] status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]] in the central Pacific Ocean; Ioke passed near [[Johnston Atoll]] and later [[Wake Island]], where it caused heavy damage but no deaths. The deadliest storm of the season was [[Hurricane John (2006)|Hurricane John]], which killed six people after striking the [[Baja California Peninsula]], and the costliest storm was [[Hurricane Lane (2006)|Hurricane Lane]], which caused $203&nbsp;million in damage in southwestern Mexico.

Seasonal activity began on May&nbsp;27 when [[Tropical Storm Aletta (2006)|Tropical Storm Aletta]] formed off the southwest coast of Mexico. No storms formed in June, though the season became active in July when five named storms developed, including [[Hurricane Daniel (2006)|Hurricane Daniel]] which was the second strongest storm of the season. During August, Hurricanes Ioke and John formed, as well as four other storms. September was a relatively quiet month with two storms, of which one was Hurricane Lane. Three storms developed in October and two formed in November; this marked the first time on record when more than one tropical storm developed in the basin during the month of November.

On May&nbsp;22, 2006, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) released their forecasts for the 2006 [[2006 Atlantic hurricane season|Atlantic]], East Pacific, and Central Pacific hurricane seasons. The Pacific season was expected to be hindered by the decades-long cycle that began in [[1995 Pacific hurricane season|1995]], which generally increased [[wind shear]] across the basin. NOAA predicted a below-normal level of activity in the Eastern Pacific, with 12&ndash;16&nbsp;named storms, of which 6&ndash;8 were expected to become hurricanes, and 1&ndash;3 expected to become major hurricanes.<ref name="NOAA May">{{cite web| author=Climate Prediction Center, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]| year=2006-05-22| title= NOAA Expects Below Average 2006 East Pacific Hurricane Season| publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration| accessdate=2006-05-22|url=http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2006/may06/noaa06-054.html}}</ref> The Central Pacific basin was also expected to be below average, with only two to three tropical cyclones expected to form or cross into the area.<ref name="NOAA May CP">{{cite web| author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]| year=2006-05-22| title= NOAA Announces Central Pacific Hurricane Season Outlook| publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration| accessdate=2006-06-10|url=http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2006/may06/noaa06-r254.html}}</ref> They expected that neither [[El Ni<U+00F1>o Southern Oscillation|El Ni<U+00F1>o]] nor La Ni<U+00F1>a would affect conditions significantly.<ref name="NOAA May"/>

===May and June===
[[Image:Tropical Storm Aletta (2006).jpg|right|thumb|Satellite image of [[Tropical Storm Aletta (2006)|Tropical Storm Aletta]], the first storm of the season]]
{{anchor|Tropical Storm Aletta}}On May&nbsp;15, the hurricane season began in the Eastern Pacific basin, which is the area of the northern [[Pacific Ocean]] east of 140<U+00BA>[[Longitude|W]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|date=2006-05-15|title=Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-04|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-P/2006051511.ABPZ20}}</ref> Twelve days later, an area of disturbed weather developed into the first tropical depression of the season, about 190&nbsp;[[mile|mi]] (310&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) south of [[Acapulco]], [[Mexico]]. It quickly intensified into a tropical storm, and upon doing so was named [[Tropical Storm Aletta (2006)|Aletta]]. The storm drifted northeastward toward the coast, bringing light rainfall before turning southward. [[Wind shear]] weakened the storm, and on May&nbsp;31 Aletta dissipated about 200&nbsp;mi (320&nbsp;km) west-northwest of where it formed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard J.

{{anchor|Tropical Depression Two-E}}On June&nbsp;1, the season began in the Central Pacific basin, which is the region between 140<U+00BA>[[Longitude|W]] and the [[International Dateline]]; however, no storms occurred in the basin until July.<ref>{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|date=2008-07-02|title=Mission Statement|accessdate=2008-09-04|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/pages/mission.php}}</ref> In the Eastern Pacific, [[Tropical Depression Two-E (2006)|Tropical Depression Two-E]] formed on June&nbsp;3 about 145&nbsp;mi (245&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Zihuatanejo]], Mexico. It tracked eastward and brought heavy rainfall to the coastline, with a report of about 11&nbsp;[[inch]]es (280&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]]) in Acapulco. Land interaction weakened the depression, and it dissipated on June&nbsp;5.<ref name="td2tcr">{{cite web|author=Lixion Avila|date=2006-07-05|title=Tropical Depression Two-E Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-05|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP022006_Two-E.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> No tropical storms developed in June in the basin, which was unusual compared to the average of two storms forming during the month. Since 1966, there have been only three other seasons in which a tropical storm did not form in June, these being [[1969 Pacific hurricane season|1969]], [[2004 Pacific hurricane season|2004]], and [[2007 Pacific hurricane season|2007]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Beven, et al.|date=2007-07-01|title=June Monthly Weather Tropical Summary|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-05|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/tws/MIATWSEP_jun.shtml?}}</ref>

===July===
{{anchor|Hurricane Bud}}After about a month of no storms, the basin became active in July. The first storm of the month was [[Hurricane Bud (2006)|Hurricane Bud]], which developed early on July&nbsp;11 about 805&nbsp;mi (1300&nbsp;km) south of [[Cabo San Lucas]]. Moving west-northwestward, it encountered conditions for quick strengthening, and within 24&nbsp;hours of forming it attained hurricane status. Bud continued strengthening, reaching [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane status]], or Category&nbsp;3 status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]], and peak winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) on July&nbsp;13. Thereafter, cooler waters and stable air caused the hurricane to quickly weaken. On July&nbsp;14, Bud weakened to tropical storm status, and two days later it degenerated into a remnant [[low pressure area]]. The remnants of Bud dissipated on July&nbsp;17 about 750&nbsp;mi (1210&nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Hawaii]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Knabb|date=2006-11-20|title=Hurricane Bud Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-07|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP032006_Bud.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

{{anchor|Hurricane Carlotta}}One day after Bud formed, a tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression about 290&nbsp;mi (465&nbsp;km) off the coast of Mexico, which would later become [[Hurricane Carlotta (2006)|Hurricane Carlotta]]. A large cyclone, its outer rainbands brushed the coastline of Mexico, as it steadily intensified to reach tropical storm and later hurricane status within 30&nbsp;hours of forming. [[Outflow (meteorology)|Outflow]] from Hurricane Bud prevented Carlotta from strengthening much further, though for a period of about 60&nbsp;hours it fluctuated between strong tropical storm status and minimal hurricane status. Cooler waters weakened the storm, and on July&nbsp;16 Carlotta degenerated into a remnant low. Its low-level circulation persisted for three days before dissipating.<ref name="ctcr">{{cite web|author=James Franklin|date=2006-09-04|title=Hurricane Carlotta Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-07|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP042006_Carlotta.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>
[[Image:Hurricane daniel 2006.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hurricane Daniel (2006)|Hurricane Daniel]] near peak intensity]]

{{anchor|Hurricane Daniel}}As the previous two storms were dissipating, a new tropical depression formed off the southwest coast of Mexico on July&nbsp;16, which would later become [[Hurricane Daniel (2006)|Hurricane Daniel]]. It moved westward, gradually intensifying under favorable conditions. On July&nbsp;22, it attained peak winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h), a Category&nbsp;4 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]] and making Daniel the strongest hurricane during the season in the NHC area of responsibility. Maintaining Category&nbsp;4 status for about three days, the hurricane subsequently weakened quickly due to cooler waters.<ref name="danieltcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|date=2006-11-30|title=Hurricane Daniel Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-13|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP052006_Daniel.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Daniel was briefly forecast to move through the [[Hawaiian Islands]] as a tropical storm;<ref name="disc31">{{cite web|author=Houston|date=2006-07-24|title=Hurricane Daniel Discussion Thirty-One|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-28|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/tcpages/archive/2006/TCDCP1.EP052006.31.0607241510}}</ref> however, the storm continued to weaken, degenerating into a remnant low on July&nbsp;27 about 800&nbsp;mi (1290&nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Hilo, Hawaii]]. Its remnants brought moderate rainfall to the region, though no damage or deaths were reported.<ref name="cphc">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|month=July | year=2007|title=Overview of the 2006 Central North Pacific Tropical Cyclone Season|accessdate=2008-09-13|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/2006.php}}</ref>

{{anchor|Tropical Storm Emilia}}Another tropical depression formed off the coast of Mexico on July&nbsp;21. It tracked northward toward the coast, strengthening into [[Tropical Storm Emilia (2006)|Tropical Storm Emilia]] and attaining peak winds of 65&nbsp;mph (105&nbsp;km/h). It briefly developed an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], though weakened due to increased [[wind shear]] as it turned away from the coast. Emilia later turned to the north, restrengthening to its peak intensity before weakening and paralleling the coastline of the [[Baja California peninsula]]. After dropping moderate rainfall along the peninsula, it weakened further as it turned out to sea, and on July&nbsp;27 degenerated into a remnant low.<ref name="etcr">{{cite web|author=Stacy R.

{{anchor|Tropical Storm Fabio}}The final storm of the month formed on July&nbsp;31 from a tropical wave, well to the southwest of Mexico. It maintained a steady westward track throughout its duration, and quickly intensified into [[Tropical Storm Fabio (2006)|Tropical Storm Fabio]]. On August&nbsp;1 it attained peak winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h), but subsequently began gradually weakening due to wind shear. Fabio degenerated into a remnant low on August&nbsp;4, and a few days later brought locally heavy rainfall to [[Hawaii]].<ref name="ftcr">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP072006_Fabio.pdf|format=PDF|title=Tropical Storm Fabio Tropical Cyclone Report|author=Jamie R.

===August===
[[Image:Ioke IR from Guam 2006 09 01.png|thumb|right|Typhoon Ioke after brushing [[Wake Island]]]]
{{anchor|Tropical Storm Gilma}}Within the basin, more tropical cyclones developed in August than in any other month.<ref name="epachurdat"/> The first storm of the month was [[Tropical Storm Gilma (2006)|Tropical Storm Gilma]], which in terms of winds was tied with [[Tropical Storm Rosa (2006)|Rosa]] for the weakest named storm of the season. Gilma developed on August&nbsp;1 off the southwest coast of Mexico, attaining peak winds of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h). The storm was disorganized due to persistent [[wind shear]], which prevented further strengthening. On August&nbsp;5 the cyclone dissipated without ever having affected land.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michelle Mainelli|title=Tropical Storm Gilma Tropical Cyclone Report|date=2006-08-23|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-23|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP082006_Gilma.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

{{anchor|Hurricane Hector}}After a period of inactivity lasting a week and a half, a tropical depression formed southwest of Mexico on August&nbsp;15. It tracked generally west-northwestward for its entire duration, eventually becoming [[Hurricane Hector (2006)|Hurricane Hector]]. On August&nbsp;18, it attained peak winds of 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h), before gradually weakening due to cooler waters. Weakening to a tropical storm on August&nbsp;20, it later turned sharply to the west, degenerating into a remnant low on August&nbsp;23 and dissipating the next day without affecting land.<ref>{{cite web|author=Daniel P.

Late on August&nbsp;22 it rapidly weakened to Category&nbsp;2 status before crossing over [[Johnston Atoll]], where 12&nbsp;people rode out the storm in a [[Hurricane proof building|hurricane-proof]] bunker. Two days later, favorable conditions again allowed for [[rapid deepening|rapid strengthening]], and Ioke attained Category&nbsp;5 status on August&nbsp;25 before crossing the [[International Date Line]].<ref name="cphc"/> As it continued westward its intensity fluctuated, and on August&nbsp;31 it passed near [[Wake Island]] with winds of {{convert|155|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward, and by September&nbsp;6 transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]]. The remnants of Ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into [[Alaska]].<ref name="cphc"/>

{{anchor|Hurricane Ileana}}On August&nbsp;21 shortly after the previous storm formed, [[Hurricane Ileana (2006)|Hurricane Ileana]] developed off the southwest coast of Mexico. It generally paralleled the coastline throughout its duration, ultimately reaching peak winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) before weakening. Around the time of peak intensity, the hurricane passed near [[Socorro Island]], where it produced hurricane-force wind gusts. On August&nbsp;27, Ileana degenerated into a remnant low, and two days later dissipated well offshore.<ref>{{cite web | author = Eric S.

[[Image:Hurricane John Aug 31 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Hurricane John on August 31]]

{{anchor|Hurricane John}}The next tropical depression, which would eventually become [[Hurricane John (2006)|Hurricane John]], formed on August&nbsp;28 about 250&nbsp;mi (400&nbsp;km) off the coast of Mexico.<ref name="johntcr">{{cite web|author=Richard J.

Hurricane John continued [[rapid deepening|rapid intensification]] and reached peak winds of 135&nbsp;mph (215&nbsp;km/h) on August&nbsp;30 while just off the Mexican coast. Land interaction weakened the hurricane, and still tracking northwestward it struck the eastern portion of the [[Baja California peninsula]] on September&nbsp;2 as a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane. John dissipated on September&nbsp;4, though its remnants brought rainfall to the southwest United States.<ref name="johntcr"/>

{{anchor|Hurricane Kristy}}The last storm to develop in August was [[Hurricane Kristy (2006)|Hurricane Kristy]], which formed on August&nbsp;30 about 935&nbsp;mi (1505&nbsp;km) west-northwest of Hurricane John. It initially tracked northwestward, reaching peak winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) within 36&nbsp;hours of forming. Outflow from Hurricane John caused Kristy to weaken, and at the same time, the storm's motion became nearly stationary as steering currents collapsed. On September&nbsp;2 it turned to a southeast drift, and degenerated into a tropical depression around the same time. Kristy later turned to the west, oscillating between tropical depression and tropical storm status until dissipating on September&nbsp;9.<ref name="lanetcr">{{cite web|author=Lixion A.

===September===
[[Image:TS Miriam 17 sept 2006.jpg|right|thumb|[[Tropical Storm Miriam (2006)|Tropical Storm Miriam]], one of two storms to form in September]]
{{anchor|Hurricane Lane}}[[Hurricane Lane (2006)|Hurricane Lane]] developed from a [[tropical wave]] on September&nbsp;13 to the south of Mexico. It moved northwestward parallel to the coast of Mexico, and steadily intensified in a favorable environment. After turning to the northeast Lane attained peak winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h), and made landfall in the [[Political divisions of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Sinaloa]] at peak strength. It rapidly weakened and dissipated on September&nbsp;17, and later brought precipitation to southern [[Texas]].<ref name="lanetcr">{{cite web|author=Richard Knabb|date=2006-11-30|title=Hurricane Lane Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP132006_Lane.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> 

{{anchor|Tropical Storm Miriam}}An area of disturbed weather associated with the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] spawned a tropical depression on September&nbsp;16 off the coast of Mexico. Despite being disorganized, it quickly strengthened into [[Tropical Storm Miriam (2006)|Tropical Storm Miriam]]. The storm was [[wind shear|sheared]] throughout its duration, and after encountering cooler waters Miriam dissipated on September&nbsp;18 near the [[Baja California peninsula]].<ref name="miriamtcr">{{cite web|author=James Franklin|date=2006-10-29|title=Tropical Storm Miriam Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP142006_Miriam.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

On September&nbsp;18, an area of disturbed weather in the central Pacific became sufficiently organized and was designated Tropical Depression Two-C. Vertical wind shear caused the depression to weaken into a remnant low on September&nbsp;20, it never having attained tropical storm status. The depression was initially thought to be a regeneration of earlier Hurricane Kristy.<ref name="cphc"/>

On September&nbsp;26, another area of disturbed weather in the Central Pacific near the [[International Date Line]] became organized and was designated Tropical Depression Three-C. However, wind shear and the presence of dry air to the west inhibited further development, and the system dissipated 12&nbsp;hours later; at around the same time, the system crossed into the Western Pacific.<ref name="cphc"/>

===October===
[[Image:Hurricane Paul TRMM Image (2006).jpg|right|thumb|[[TRMM]] satellite image of the rainfall from Hurricane Paul]]
{{anchor|Tropical Storm Norman}}The first cyclone to develop in the month of October was [[Tropical Storm Norman (2006)|Tropical Storm Norman]], which formed well off the coast of Mexico on October&nbsp;9. It quickly reached peak winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h), though almost as quickly the cyclone degenerated into a remnant low due to wind shear. Its remnants turned to the east, and on October&nbsp;15 regenerated into a tropical cyclone just off the coast of Mexico after merging with another disturbance. Norman quickly dissipated as unfavorable conditions returned, although it brought heavy rainfall to the Mexican coastline.<ref name="ntcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|date=2006-11-30|title=Tropical Storm Norman Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-08-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP152006_Norman.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> 

{{anchor|Tropical Storm Olivia}}[[Tropical Storm Olivia (2006)|Tropical Storm Olivia]] formed on October&nbsp;9 about 700&nbsp;mi (1120&nbsp;km) west of Norman. Tracking northeastward and attaining tropical storm status, it failed to strengthen significantly due to wind shear. Olivia weakened to tropical depression status on October&nbsp;11, and turning to the east-southeast degenerated into a remnant low two days later. Its remnants were later absorbed by a larger disturbance that included the remnants of Norman.<ref name="nov06"/>

{{anchor|Tropical Depression Four-C}}The final cyclone to develop within the CPHC area of responsibility was [[Tropical Depression Four-C (2006)|Tropical Depression Four-C]], which formed on October&nbsp;13 to the southwest of [[Hawaii]]. Within 24&nbsp;hours of forming, it degenerated into a remnant disturbance due to unfavorable wind shear. Moisture from the depression contributed to heavy rainfall in Hawaii.<ref name="cphc"/>

{{anchor|Hurricane Paul}}The strongest hurricane during the month was [[Hurricane Paul (2006)|Hurricane Paul]]. Forming on October&nbsp;21, it did not strengthen much initially due to the presence of wind shear. However, a decrease in shear allowed Paul to strengthen rapidly, and in a 24-hour period it developed from a moderate tropical storm to a 105&nbsp;mph (170&nbsp;km/h) hurricane, its peak intensity. By that time, it had turned northeastward and entered an unfavorable environment, which caused Paul to steadily weaken to tropical storm status. After passing south of the [[Baja California peninsula]] it deteriorated to tropical depression status and moved ashore in northwestern [[Sinaloa]].<ref name="paultcr">{{cite web|author=Jamie R.

{{anchor|Tropical Depression Eighteen-E}}On October&nbsp;26 shortly after Paul dissipated, another tropical depression formed off the southwest coast of Mexico. Moving southwestward, it encountered unfavorable wind shear, which prevented strengthening.

====Unclassified storm====
{{main|2006 Central Pacific cyclone}}
An [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] storm persisted in the extreme northern central [[Pacific Ocean]] in late October. It drifted over unusually [[sea surface temperature|warm waters]] up to 3.6[[Fahrenheit|<U+00BA>F]] (2[[degrees Celsius|<U+00B0>C]]) above normal, and gradually developed convection near the center. By November&nbsp;2, [[QuikSCAT]] satellite suggested the system attained winds of up to 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) about 900&nbsp;mi (1450&nbsp;km) west of [[Oregon]]. The system also developed an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] and an eyewall. The cyclone tracked northeastward as it gradually weakened, and dissipated on November&nbsp;4. [[NASA]] considered the cyclone to be a [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical storm]]. However, as it formed outside of the territory of any monitoring organization, it was not named. Operationally, the [[United States Navy]] treated the system as a tropical disturbance, numbered 91C.<ref name="NASA-91C">{{cite web | author = David Herring | publisher = [[NASA]] | title = Subtropical Storm off the Coast of Oregon | date = November 2, 2006 | accessdate=2007-12-11 | url = http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/natural_hazards_v2.php3?img_id=13951}}</ref>

{{anchor|Tropical Storm Rosa}}Tropical activity within the basin in November&nbsp;2006 was the most active on record, based on the [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy]] (ACE) Index. Three tropical cyclones formed, of which two became tropical storms; only one other season on record, 1966, produced two tropical storms in the month of November. The first storm of the month was [[Tropical Storm Rosa (2006)|Tropical Storm Rosa]], which formed on November&nbsp;8 as a tropical depression off the southwest coast of Mexico. Immediate development was hampered by wind shear, although an increase in thunderstorms on November&nbsp;9 brought the depression to tropical storm status. Continued shear prevented intensification, and Rosa dissipated on November&nbsp;10.<ref name="nov06">{{cite web|author=Pasch, et al.|date=2006-12-01|title=Summary of the 2006 Pacific Hurricane Season|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-03|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/tws/MIATWSEP_nov.shtml?}}</ref> Rosa was the first Eastern Pacific tropical storm in November since another storm named Rosa in the [[2000 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Rosa|2000 season]].<ref name="epachurdat"/>

{{anchor|Hurricane Sergio}}The final storm of the season was [[Hurricane Sergio (2006)|Hurricane Sergio]], which was both the strongest and longest-lived November Pacific hurricane on record. It formed on November&nbsp;13 about 460&nbsp;mi (740&nbsp;km) south of [[Manzanillo, Colima]], and steadily intensified while tracking southeastward. It reached peak winds of 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h) on November&nbsp;15, and subsequently began to weaken due to increased wind shear as it turned to the north. Sergio later turned to the west, remaining well off the coast of Mexico, and dissipated on November&nbsp;20 about 320&nbsp;mi (515&nbsp;km) west-northwest of it originally formed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Pasch and David Roberts|date=2006-11-29|title=Hurricane Sergio Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-10-03|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP212006_Sergio.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The storm brought light rainfall to the Mexican coastline, though no major effects were reported.<ref name="sergiosmn">{{cite web|author=Servicio Meteorol<U+00F3>gico Nacional|year=2006|title=Resumen del Huracan "Sergio" del Oc<U+00E9>ano Pac<U+00ED>fic|accessdate=2007-02-13|language=Spanish|url=http://smn.cna.gob.mx/ciclones/tempo2006/pacifico/sergio/sergio.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

==Storm names==
The following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast Pacific in 2006.<ref name="name">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Worldwide Tropical Cyclone Names|year=2008|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2008-05-14|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml}}</ref> This is the same list that was used in the [[2000 Pacific hurricane season|2000 season]]. Names that were not assigned are marked in <font color="gray">gray</font>. There were no names retired from the northeast Pacific list. Therefore, the same list will be reused in the 2012 season.

Storms that formed in the central Pacific are given names from a sequential list; in 2006, the name ''[[Hurricane Ioke|Ioke]]'' was used from this list, the first time a name from the Central Pacific list had been used since the [[2002 Pacific hurricane season|2002 season]].

===Retirement===
The name ''Ioke'' was [[List of retired Pacific hurricane names|retired]] from the north-central Pacific list by the [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]] in the spring of 2007 and replaced with Iopa.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dennis H. McCarthy|year=2007|title=National Weather Service Instruction Tropical Cyclone Names and Pronunciation Guide|accessdate=2007-12-29|url=http://www.weather.gov/directives/sym/pd01006006curr.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, the Hawaii State Civil Defense requested the retirement of the name ''Daniel'', citing that the storm had become memorable due to threat or damage.<ref>{{cite web|author=Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference|year=2007|title=The Nation<U+2019>s Hurricane Program: An Interagency Success Story|accessdate=2007-12-29|url=http://www.ofcm.gov/ihc07/web-61st-IHC-Booklet.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> However, the request was denied, as the name remains on the tropical cyclone naming list.<ref name="name"/>
