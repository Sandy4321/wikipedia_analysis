'''''Oddfellows''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] by musical [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Tomahawk (band)|Tomahawk]]. The album is the first to feature new bass player [[Trevor Dunn]], who has replaced previous member [[Kevin Rutmanis]]. ''Oddfellows'' was recorded live in the Easy Eye Sound Studio in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], after a brief period of rehearsal. Guitarist [[Duane Denison]] favored the location as its cheaper studio costs allowed for longer periods of song-writing.

The album was released on January 29, 2013 through the record label [[Ipecac Recordings]]. The release of ''Oddfellows'' was preceded by a single, "Stone Letter", first released on November 23, 2012 as part of [[Record Store Day]]'s "Black Friday" event. Reviews for ''Oddfellows'' have been positive, and Dunn's presence has been seen by critics as a positive addition. The album reached chart positions in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium and the United States.
