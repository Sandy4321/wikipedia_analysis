'''Neuro-linguistic programming''' ('''NLP''') is a set of techniques, [[axioms]] and [[belief]]s that adherents use primarily as an approach to [[personal development]]. It is based on the idea that mind, body and language interact to create an individual's perception of the world and that perceptions, and hence behaviors, can be changed by the application of a variety of techniques; in particular, "modeling" which involves the careful reproduction of the behaviors and beliefs of those who have achieved 'excellence'. The early focus of NLP was the study of the underlying patterns in the language and techniques of noted and successful therapists in [[hypnotherapy]], [[gestalt therapy]] and [[family therapy]]. The patterns discovered were adapted for general communication and effecting change.

{{Neuro-linguistic programming}}

==General description==
NLP was influenced by [[hypnotherapy]], [[psychotherapy]] and the [[human potential]] movement. Its basic ideas were developed circa 1973. Bandler and Grinder originally focused on ''modeling'' the communication (verbal and [[non-verbal communication|non-verbal]]) and thinking strategies of noted psychotherapists. Although its theoretical principles have not been supported by psychological and experimental research,<ref name="Sharpley 1987">{{cite journal | author=Sharpley C.F.| title=Research Findings on Neuro-linguistic Programming: Non supportive Data or an Untestable Theory| journal=Communication and Cognition|year=1987 |volume=Journal of Counseling Psychology, 1987 Vol. 34, No. 1 | pages=103-107,105 | url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?nfpb=true&_pageLabel=RecordDetails&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ352101&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&objectId=0900000b8005c1ac}}</ref><ref name="Druckman & Swets 1998" /> many of its techniques are derived from existing therapeutic techniques<ref name="Sharpley 1987">{{cite journal | author=Sharpley C.F.| title=Research Findings on Neuro-linguistic Programming: Non supportive Data or an Untestable Theory| journal=Communication and Cognition | year=1987 | volume=Journal of Counseling Psychology, 1987 Vol. 34, No. 1 | pages=103-107,105 | url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?nfpb=true&_pageLabel=RecordDetails&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ352101&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&objectId=0900000b8005c1ac}}</ref>.

There are many definitions and variations of NLP amongst its proponents. Bandler defines NLP as "an attitude and a methodology which leaves behind a trail of techniques" whereas Grinder defines NLP as "the study of excellence and how to reproduce it".<ref name="Labouchere 2004">Peter Labouchere (2004) [http://www.ee4.org/Papers/EE4_Labouchere.pdf Using participatory story telling, forum theatre and NLP concepts and techniques to create powerful learning experiences around issues of HIV prevention, support and positive living] paper presented at at ''EE4 - Fourth International Entertainment Education Conference''</ref> NLP author [[Robert Dilts]] calls the system "the study of the structure of subjective experience".<ref>{{cite book | author= Dilts, R., Grinder, J., Delozier, J., Bandler,R., | title=Neuro-Linguistic Programming: Volume I (The Study of the Structure of Subjective Experience) | publisher=Meta Publications | year=1980 | pages=1 | id=ISBN 0916990079}}</ref> 
NLP techniques may be used in group trainings, seminars, or individual consultations. Practitioners deal with personal issues like reframing what they consider to be negative beliefs, dealing with [[stage fright]] and simple [[phobias]], or [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Adherents may take up NLP as a skill set for coaching, consulting, or counseling.<ref name="sch<U+00FC>tz">{{cite web | author=Sch<U+00FC>tz, P. | title=A consumer guide through the multiplicity of NLP certification training | url=http://www.nlpzentrum.at/institutsvgl-english.htm | publisher=. | accessdate=December 2006}}</ref>  Trainers may mix NLP techniques with ideas about [[motivation|motivational techniques]], adult learning, management, sales training, [[popular psychology]] and even [[Speed Seduction#Speed Seduction|seduction]]. It is also used as an adjunct by therapists in other therapeutic disciplines{{FACT|July 2007}}.

==Concepts and methods==
{{main|Methods of neuro-linguistic programming}}

NLP is based on the idea that human senses are limited in scope, hence a person perceives only a small part of the world via those senses. Thus, proponents state that a person's view of the world is filtered by biology, experience, beliefs, values and assumptions. These filters form a person's logical construct of the world, referred to by NLP adherants as a "map". NLP advocates hold that the human mind-body (neuro) complex and what people say (linguistic), interact together to form perceptions of the world, or maps (programming). 

A core tennet is [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s idiom, [[the map is not the territory]]: in other words  people act and feel based on their perception or maps of the world rather than the actual world.  Practitioners of NLP believe that most people's maps are an impoverished, distorted representation of the actual world. This then leads people to create what are considered to be unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking. By exploring and challenging parts of their map, the practitioner seeks to modify, replace or reframe these thought patterns in order to improve the clients internal experience and achieve more effective and flexible behavior.<ref name="Bandler and Grinder 1975a"/><ref name="Bandler & Grinder 1979" /><ref name="Bandler & Grinder 1983">{{cite book | author=Bandler, Richard & John Grinder | title=Reframing: Neurolinguistic programming and the transformation of meaning | location=Moab, UT | publisher=Real People Press. | year=1983 | pages=appendix II,p.171}}</ref><ref name="Bandler & Grinder 1975a" />

One NLP method for doing this is 'modeling'. NLP holds that language and behaviors (whether functional or dysfunctional) are highly structured, and that this structure can be 'modeled' or copied into a reproducible form.<ref name="Bandler & Grinder 1979">{{cite book | author=Bandler, R., Grinder, J. | title=Frogs into Princes: Neuro Linguistic Programming | location=Moab, UT | publisher=Real People Press. | year=1979 | | pages=149(pp.15,24,30,45,52) | id=ISBN 0911226192}}</ref> The founders, Bandler and Grinder, started by analysing in detail and then searching for what made successful [[psychotherapist]]s different from their peers. The original models were: [[Milton Erickson]] ([[hypnotherapy]]), [[Virginia Satir]] ([[family therapy]]), and [[Fritz Perls]] ([[gestalt therapy]]). 
The patterns discovered were adapted for general communication and effecting change.<ref name="Bandler & Grinder 1979">{{cite book | author=Bandler, Richard & John Grinder | title=Frogs into Princes: Neuro Linguistic Programming | location=Moab, UT | publisher=Real People Press | year=1979 | pages=15,24,30,45,52.}}</ref> NLP embodies many techniques, including hypnotic techniques, which proponents claim can affect changes in the way people think, learn and communicate.<ref name="Dilts et al 1980">{{cite book | author=Dilts, R.B., Grinder, J., Bandler, R., DeLozier, J.A. | title=Neuro-Linguistic Programming: Volume I - The Study of the Structure of Subjective Experience | publisher=Meta Publications | date=1980 | id=ISBN 0916990079 | pages=284(pp.3-4,6,14,17)}}</ref> NLP is an eclectic field, often described as a 'toolbox', which has borrowed heavily from other fields in collating its presuppositions and techniques. 

===Modeling===
{{main|Modeling (NLP)}}

"Modeling" in NLP is the process of adopting the behaviors, language, strategies and beliefs of another in order to 'build a model of what they do...we know that our modeling has been successful when we can systematically get the same behavioral outcome as the person we have modeled'.<ref name="Bandler & Grinder 1979">{{cite book | author=Bandler, R., Grinder, J. | title=Frogs into Princes: Neuro Linguistic Programming | location=Moab, UT | publisher=Real People Press. | year=1979 | | pages=149(pp.15,24,30,45,52) | id=ISBN 0911226192}}</ref> The 'model' is then reduced to a pattern that can be taught to others. NLP modeling methods are designed to unconsciously assimilate the tacit knowledge of what the master is doing, and of which the master is not aware, and can involve modeling "exceptional" people.<ref name="Jacobson 1994">Jacobson, S. (1994)  Info-line: practical guidelines for training and development professionals, ''American Society For Training and Development'' Alexandria, VA [http://sidjacobson.com/institute/history.html Adapted version available online  ]</ref> Bandler and Grinder state "the function of NLP modeling is to arrive at descriptions which are useful."<ref name="Bandler & Grinder 1979"/> Einspruch & Forman 1985 state that "when modeling another person the modeler suspends his or her own beliefs and adopts the structure of the physiology, language, strategies, and beliefs of the person being modeled. After the modeler is capable of behaviorally reproducing the patterns (of behavior, communication, and behavioral outcomes) of the one being modeled, a process occurs in which the modeler modifies and readopts his or her own belief system while also integrating the beliefs of the one who was modeled."<ref name="Einspruch & Forman 1985">{{cite journal | author=Einspruch, Eric L., Forman, Bruce D. | title=Observations Concerning Research Literature on Neuro-Linguistic Programming | journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology | year=1985 | volume=32(4) | pages=pp. 589-596}}</ref> Modeling is not confined to therapy, but is applied to a broad range of human learning. Another aspect of modeling is understanding the patterns of one's own behaviors in order to 'model' the more successful parts of oneself.

===Meta model=== 
{{main|Meta model (NLP)}}

In NLP the Meta-model is a set of specifying questions or language patterns designed to challenge and expand the limits to a person's model or 'map' of the world. It is based on the verbal patterning of [[Fritz Perls]] and [[Virginia Satir]] and is intended to facilitate the detection of limiting beliefs and restrictive thinking. When a person speaks about a problem or situation their choice of words, (or <U+2018>indicators<U+2019>), will ''distort'', ''generalize'', and ''delete'' portions of their experience. The questions in the meta-model are designed to bring clarity to the client's language and so to their underlying restrictive thinking and beliefs.

By listening to and responding to these language patterns the practitioner seeks to help the client to recover the information that is under the surface of the words. A therapist who 'listens' on the basis of their existing belief systems may miss important aspects.

===Milton model=== 
{{main|Milton model}}

The '''Milton model''' is a way of communicating based on the hypnotic language patterns of [[Milton Erickson]].<ref name="Barretta 2004">Norma Barretta (2004) Review of Hypnotic Language: Its Structure and Use. American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis. Bloomingdale: Jan 2004. Vol.46, Iss. 3;  pg. 261, 2 pgs</ref> It has been described as "a way of using language to induce and maintain trance in order to contact the hidden resources of our personality".<ref name="OConnor & Seymour 2002">{{cite book | author=Joseph O'Connor, John Seymour | title=Introducing NLP | location=London | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2002 (first published 1990) | url=http://www.reiters.com/index.cgi?ISBN=1855383446&f=p | id=1855383446}}</ref>  The Milton model has three primary aspects: Firstly, to assist in building and maintaining rapport with the client. Secondly, to overload and distract the conscious mind so that [[unconscious communication]] can be cultivated. Thirdly, to allow for interpretation in the words offered to the client.<ref name="Pruett 2002">Pruett, Julie Annette Sikes (2002) The application of the neuro-linguistic programming model to vocal performance training D.M.A., The University of Texas at Austin, 151 pages; AAT 3108499 </ref> Furthermore, communicating with metaphor was an essential part of Milton's methods providing a platform whereby Erickson could smoothly deliver his therapeutic suggestions.

=====Building rapport=====

First, building '''[[Rapport (NLP)|rapport]]''', or empathy, is done to achieve better communication and responsiveness. NLP teaches 'mirroring' or matching body language, posture, breathing, predicates and voice tonality. Rapport is an aspect of 'pacing' or tuning into the client or learner's world. Once pacing is established, the practitioner can 'lead' by changing their behavior or perception so the other follows. O'Connor & Seymour, in "Introducing NLP", describe rapport as a 'harmonious dance', an extension of natural skills, but they warn against mimicry.<ref name="OConnor & Seymour 2002">{{cite book | author=Joseph O'Connor, John Seymour | title=Introducing NLP | location=London | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2002 (first published 1990) | url=http://www.reiters.com/index.cgi?ISBN=1855383446&f=p | id=1855383446}}</ref>  Singer gives examples of the pantomime effect of mere mimicry by some practitioners which does not create rapport.<ref name="Singer & Lalich 1997">{{cite book | author= Singer, Margaret & Janja Lalich | title=Crazy Therapies: What Are They? Do They Work? | publisher=Jossey Bass | year=1997 | id=ISBN 0787902780}}</ref>

=====Conscious/Unconscious attention=====

Second, Erickson used ambiguous language, that is, words and sentences with multiple meanings. The clients conscious memory would be overloaded creating an opportunity for unconscious communication and resources to become available to the client. The milton model attempts to capture these patterns in artfully vague language, ambiguity, and metaphor.
Erickson was aware that the capacity limit of short term, conscious memory was seven (plus or minus two) elements, called 'chunks' or the "[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|magical number seven]]", introduced by Miller (1956)<ref name="miller">Miller, G. A. (1956). [http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html The magical number seven, plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for processing information.] Psychological Review, 63, 81-97</ref>.

=====Indirect communication=====

Furthermore, indirect communication is purposely kept vague and metaphoric to assist the client and practitioner to work with the unconscious mind. Indirect communication is also used to soften the meta model and make indirect suggestions.<ref name="Bandler & Grinder 1976">Bandler, Richard & John Grinder (1976). Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. Erickson, M.D. Volume 1. Cupertino, CA :Meta Publications. ISBN 0-916990-01-X.</ref>

=====Communicating with metaphor=====
Largely derived from the ideas of [[Gregory Bateson]] and the techniques of Erikson, 'metaphor' in the milton model ranges from simple figures of speech to allegories and stories. It tends to be used in conjunction with the skills of the Milton model to create a story which operates on many levels with the intention of communicating with the unconscious and to find and challenge basic assumptions.<ref name="Dilts & Delozier 2000">{{cite book | last = Dilts | first =  Robert B | coauthors =  DeLozier, Judith A | title = Encyclopedia of Systemic Neuro-Linguistic Programming and NLP New Coding | publisher = NLP University Press |date= 2000  | url = http://www.nlpuniversitypress.com/ | id = ISBN 0970154003}}</ref><ref name="OConnor & Seymour 2002">{{cite book | author=Joseph O'Connor, John Seymour | title=Introducing NLP | location=London | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2002 (first published 1990) | url=http://www.reiters.com/index.cgi?ISBN=1855383446&f=p | id=1855383446}}</ref>

===Representational systems=== 
{{main|Representational systems (NLP)}}

The notion that experience is processed by the sensory systems or representational systems was incorporated into NLP from psychology and Gestalt therapy shortly after its creation.<ref name="Bandler & Grinder 1979">{{cite book | author=Bandler, R., Grinder, J. | title=Frogs into Princes: Neuro Linguistic Programming | location=Moab, UT | publisher=Real People Press. | year=1979 | | pages=149(pp.15,24,30,45,52) | id=ISBN 0911226192}}</ref> This holds that people perceive the world through the senses and store the information from the senses in the mind. Memories are closely linked to sensory experience. When people are processing information they see images and hear sounds and voices and process this with internally created feelings. Some representations are within conscious awareness but information is largely processed at the unconscious level. When involved in any task, such as making conversation, describing a problem in therapy, reading a book, kicking a ball or riding a horse, their representational systems, consisting of [[Visual thinking|images]], [[auditory|sounds]], [[kinesthetic|feelings]] (and possibly [[olfactory|smell]] and [[gustatory|taste]]) are being activated at the same time.<ref name="Druckman & Swets 1998">Druckman and Swets (eds) (l988) [http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037921/html/133.html Enhancing Human Performance: Issues, Theories, and Techniques], National Academy Press.</ref> The way representational systems are organised and the links between them is believed to impact on behavioral performance. The purpose of many NLP techniques is to interrupt thought and thus behavior patterns seen as maladaptive, and replace them with patterns seen as more positive and creative.<ref name="Cooper and Seal 2006">Cooper and Seal (2006) "Theory and Approaches - Eclectic-integrative approaches: Neuro-linguistic programming" In Feldtham and Horton (Eds) The SAGE Handbook of Counselling and Psychotherapy 2e </ref>

====Preferred representational systems====
Originally NLP taught that most people had an internal preferred representational system (PRS) and preferred to process information primarily in one sensory modality. The practitioner could ascertain this from external cues such as the direction of eye movements, posture, breathing, voice tone and the use of sensory-based predicates. If a person repeatedly used predicates such as "I can ''see'' a ''bright'' future for myself", the words "see" and "bright" would be considered visual predicates. In contrast "I can feel that we will be comfortable" would be considered primarily kinesthetic because of the predicates "feel" and "comfortable". These verbal cues could also be coupled with posture changes, skin color or breathing shifts. The theory was that the practitioner, by matching and working within the preferred representational system, could achieve better communication with the client and hence swifter and more effective results. Many trainings and standard works still teach PRS<ref name="OConnor & Seymour 2002">{{cite book | author=Joseph O'Connor, John Seymour | title=Introducing NLP | location=London | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2002 (first published 1990) | url=http://www.reiters.com/index.cgi?ISBN=1855383446&f=p | id=1855383446}}</ref> whilst other proponents have de-emphasized the existence and relevance of PRS and instead emphasize working within all representational systems.  In particular, New Code emphasizes  individual calibration and sensory acuity, precluding such a rigidly specified model as the one described above.<ref name="Grinder_1996"/> Responding directly to sensory experience requires an immediacy which respects the importance of context. Grinder has stated that a representational system diagnosis lasts about 30 seconds.<ref name="Grinder_1996">Grinder, J. (1996) [Transcript of Interview  http://www.inspiritive.com.au/grinterv.htm]</ref>

Although there is some research that supports the notion that eye movements can indicate visual and auditory (but not kinesthetic) components of thought in that moment,<ref name="Buckner 1987">Buckner, Meara, Reese, and Reese (1987) Journal of Counselling Psychology , Vol. 34(3), pp.283-287</ref>the existence of a preferred representational system ascertainable from external cues (an important part of original NLP theory) was discounted by research in the 1980s.<ref name="Sharpley 1984">Sharpley, C.

====Submodalities====
{{main|Submodalities (NLP)}}

Submodalities are the fine details of representational systems. In the late 1970s the developers of NLP extended the use visual submodalities (common in sports psychology and meditation), to include other sensory systems involving the relative size, location, brightness of internal images, the volume and direction of internal voices and sounds, and the location, texture, and movement of internally created sensations.<ref name="Tosey & Mathison 2003">Tosey, P. Jane Mathison (2003) Neuro-linguistic Programming and learning theory: a response ''The Curriculum Journal'' Vol.14 No.3 p.371-388 See also (available online): [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/00003319.htm Neuro-linguistic programming: its potential for learning and teaching in formal education]</ref> Submodalities and hypnosis became the focus of Richard Bandler's later work.<ref name="Bandler 1984">eg. Bandler, R. (1984) Using your brain for a change</ref> 

A typical "change" process may involve manipulating the submodalities of internal representations. For example, someone may see their future as 'dark and cloudy' with associated emotions, but would seek through NLP to perceive, and feel it, as 'light and clear'. Other training exercises develop a person's ability to move around internal images, change the quality of sounds and find out how these effect the intensity of internal feelings or other submodalities. Although NLP did not discover submodalities, it appears that the proponents of NLP may have been the first to systematically use manipulation of submodalities for therapeutic or personal development purposes, particularly phobias, compulsions and addictions.<ref name="Dilts & Delozier 2000">{{cite book | last = Dilts | first =  Robert B | coauthors =  DeLozier, Judith A | title = Encyclopedia of Systemic Neuro-Linguistic Programming and NLP New Coding | publisher = NLP University Press |date= 2000  | url = http://www.nlpuniversitypress.com/ | id = ISBN 0970154003}}</ref>

===Aphorisms/presuppositions===
{{main|Principles of NLP}}

*The map is not the territory - a concept/phrase coined by Alfred Korzybski in "General Semantics"
*Life and 'Mind' are Systemic Processes
*Behind every behavior there is a positive intention
*There is no failure, only feedback
*Choice is better than no choice (and flexibility is the way one gets choice)
*The meaning of the communication is the response it produces, not the intended communication
*People already have all the resources they need to succeed
*Multiple descriptions are better than one

===Techniques===
====Anchoring====
NLP proponents state that people make '''[[Anchoring (NLP)|anchors]]''' (associations) between sensations and emotional states. If a person is exposed to a unique stimulus while in a specific emotional state, a connection is made between the emotion and the unique stimulus. If the unique stimulus occurs again, the emotional state will be triggered. Additionally anchors can be deliberately created and triggered to help people access 'resourceful' or other target states.<ref name="Krugman 1985">Krugman, Martin, ''et al.'', (1985): "Neuro-linguistic programming treatment for anxiety: Magic or myth?." Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology. Aug, Vol. 53(4) pp. 526-530.</ref>Anchoring appears to have been imported into NLP from family therapy as part of the 'model' of [[Virginia Satir]].<ref name="Haber 2002">Haber, Russell, (2002): Virginia Satir: An integrated, humanistic approach Contemporary Family Therapy, Vol 24(1), Mar 2002,p32 pp. 23-34 ISSN 1573-3335 {{DOI|10.1023/A:1014317420921}}</ref>

====Swish====
The swish pattern is a process that is designed to disrupt a pattern of thought from one that used to lead to an unwanted behavior to one that leads to a desired behavior.   This involves visualizing a 'cue' which leads into the unwanted behavior, such as a smokers hand moving towards the face with a cigarette in it, and reprogramming the mind to 'switch' to a visualization of the desired outcome, such as a healthy looking person, energetic and fit. In addition to visualization, auditory sound effects are often imagined to enhance the experience.<ref name="Masters et al 1991">Masters, B Rawlins, M, Rawlins, L, Weidner, J. (1991) "The NLP swish pattern: An innovative visualizing technique. Journal of Mental Health Counseling. Vol 13(1) Jan 1991, 79-90. " </ref> Swish is one of the techniques that involves the manipulation of submodalities. 

====Reframing====
'''[[Reframing (NLP)|Reframing]]''' is common to a number of therapies and was not original to NLP.<ref name="Sharpley 1987">{{cite journal | author=Sharpley C.F.| title=Research Findings on Neuro-linguistic Programming: Non supportive Data or an Untestable Theory| journal=Communication and Cognition | year=1987 | volume=Journal of Counseling Psychology, 1987 Vol. 34, No. 1 | pages=103-107,105 | url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?nfpb=true&_pageLabel=RecordDetails&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ352101&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&objectId=0900000b8005c1ac}}</ref>
Reframing functions through "changing the way you perceive an event and so changing the meaning.  When the meaning changes, responses and behaviours will also change. Reframing with language allows you to see the world in a different way and this changes the meaning. Reframing is the basis of jokes, myths, legends, fairy tales and most creative ways of thinking."<ref name=Joseph O'Connor">Joseph O'Connor  ''NLP: A Practical Guide to Achieving the Results You Want: Workbook'' Harper Collins 2001</ref> There are examples in children's literature. [[Pollyanna]] would play [[The Glad Game]] whenever she felt down about life, to remind herself of the things that she could do, and not  worry about the things she couldn't.<ref name="Mills 1999">Alice Mills (1999) ''Pollyanna and the not so glad game.''  Children's Literature. Storrs: 1999. Vol.27 pg. 87, 18 pgs</ref>

====Six step reframe====
An example of reframing is found in the '''[[Reframing (NLP)|six-step reframe]]''' which involves distinguishing between an underlying intention and the consequent behaviors for the purpose of achieving the intention by different and more successful behaviors. It is based on the notion that there is a positive intention behind all behaviors, but that the behaviors themselves may be unwanted or counterproductive in other ways. NLP uses this staged process to identify the intention and create alternative choices to satisfy that intention.

====Well-formed outcome====
In NLP this is one of a number of 'frames' wherein the desired state is considered as to its achievability and effect if achieved. A positive outcome must be defined by the client, be within the clients power to achieve, retain the positive products of the unwanted behaviours and produce an outcome that is appropriate for all circumstances.<ref name="Dilts & Delozier 2000">{{cite book | last = Dilts | first =  Robert B | coauthors =  DeLozier, Judith A | title = Encyclopedia of Systemic Neuro-Linguistic Programming and NLP New Coding | publisher = NLP University Press |date= 2000  | url = http://www.nlpuniversitypress.com/ | id = ISBN 0970154003}}</ref> 

====Ecology====

Ecology in NLP deals with the relationship between a client and their natural, social and created environments and how a proposed goal or change might relate to their relationships and their environment. It is a frame within which the desired outcome is checked against the consequences in the client's life and relationships.

====Parts integration====
'''[[Perceptual positions|Parts Integration]]''' is based on the idea that different aspects of ourselves are in conflict due to different perceptions and beliefs. 'Parts integration' is the process of integrating the disparate aspects of the self by identifying and then negotiating with the separate parts to achieve resolution of internal conflict. Parts integration appears to be modeled on 'parts' from [[family therapy]] and has similarities to [[ego-state therapy]] in psychoanalysis.

====Visual/Kinesthetic Dissociation (VK/D)====
VK/D stands for 'Visual/Kinesthetic Dissociation'. This is a technique designed to eliminate bad feelings associated with past events by re-running (like a film, sometimes in reverse) an associated memory in a [[dissociation|dissociated]] state. It combines elements of Eriksonian techniques, spatial sorting processes from Fritz Perls, reframing and 'changing history' techniques.<ref name="Dilts & Delozier 2000">{{cite book | last = Dilts | first =  Robert B | coauthors =  DeLozier, Judith A | title = Encyclopedia of Systemic Neuro-Linguistic Programming and NLP New Coding | publisher = NLP University Press |date= 2000  | url = http://www.nlpuniversitypress.com/ | id = ISBN 0970154003}}</ref>

=====Sharpley's review of preferred representational systems=====

In 1984, Sharpley, researching for counseling psychology, undertook a literature review of 15 studies on the existence and effectiveness of preferred representational systems (PRS), an important underlying principle of NLP, and found "little research evidence supporting its usefulness as an effective counseling tool" and no reproducible support for preferred representational systems and predicate matching.<ref name="Sharpley 1984">Sharpley, C. F. (1984). Predicate matching in NLP: A review of research on the preferred representational system. Journal of Counseling Psychology, 31(2), 238-248.</ref> 

Einspruch and Forman (1985) broadly agreed with Sharpley (1984) but disputed the conclusions, identifying a failure to address methodological errors in the research reviewed.<ref name="Einspruch & Forman 1985">{{cite journal | author=Einspruch, Eric L., Forman, Bruce D. | title=Observations Concerning Research Literature on Neuro-Linguistic Programming | journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology | year=1985 | volume=32(4) | pages=pp. 589-596}}</ref> Einspruch and Forman stated that "NLP is far more complex than presumed by researchers, and thus, the data are not true evaluations of NLP" adding that NLP is difficult to test under the traditional [[counseling psychology]] framework. Moreover the research lacked a necessary understanding of pattern recognition as part of advanced NLP training, there was inadequate control of context, an unfamiliarity with NLP as an approach to therapy, inadequate definitions of rapport and numerous logical mistakes in the research methodology. 

Sharpley (1987) responded to Einspruch and Forman (1985) with a review of a further 7 studies on the same basic tenets (totalling 44 including those cited by Einspruch and Forman).<ref name="Sharpley 1987">{{cite journal | author=Sharpley C.F.| title=Research Findings on Neuro-linguistic Programming: Non supportive Data or an Untestable Theory| journal=Communication and Cognition | year=1987 | volume=Journal of Counseling Psychology, 1987 Vol. 34, No. 1 | pages=103-107,105 | url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?nfpb=true&_pageLabel=RecordDetails&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ352101&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&objectId=0900000b8005c1ac}}</ref> 

Sharpley's second review (1987) included Elich et al (1985), a study that found no support for the proposed relationship between eye movements, spoken predicates, and internal imagery. Elich et al stated that "NLP has achieved something akin to cult status when it may be nothing more than a psychological fad" (p625)".<ref name="Elich 1985">Elich, M., Thompson, R. W., & Miller, L. (1985).  [http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=RecordDetails&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ327573&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&objectId=0900000b800561ca Mental imagery as revealed by eye movements and spoken predicates: A test of neurolinguistic programming]. Journal of Counseling Psychology, 32(4), 622-625. note: "psychological fad"p.625</ref> 

Sharpley (1987) stated that a number of NLP techniques are worthwhile or beneficial in counselling psychology, citing predicate matching, mirroring clients behaviors, moving sensory modalities, reframing, anchoring and changing history, but said that none of these techniques originated within NLP: "NLP may be seen as a partial compendium rather than as an original contribution to counseling practice and, thereby, has a value distinct from the lack of research data supporting the underlying principles that Bandler and Grinder posited to present NLP as a new and magical theory". Sharpley (1987) concluded that "if NLP is presented as a theory-less set of procedures gathered from many approaches to counselling, then it may serve as a reference role for therapists who wish to supplement their counselling practice by what may be novel techniques to them."

=====Other reviews of evidence=====
In a major review in 1988, Druckman and Swets NRC found that "studies fail to provide an empirical base of support for NLP assumptions...or NLP effectiveness. The committee cannot recommend the employment of such an unvalidated technique".<ref name="Druckman & Swets 1998" /> They also concluded that matching representational systems to gain rapport was ineffective, however the idea of modeling of expert performance "merits further consideration". 

In 2004 Druckman said of the 1988 study "Our experiences with NLP led to two different conclusions. On the one hand, we found little if any evidence to support NLP<U+2019>s assumptions or to indicate that it is effective as a strategy for social influence. It assumes that by tracking another<U+2019>s eye movements and language, an NLP trainer can shape the person<U+2019>s thoughts, feelings, and opinions (Dilts, 1983). There is no scientific support for these assumptions. On the other hand, we were impressed with the modeling approach used to develop the technique. The technique was developed from careful observations of the way three master psychotherapists conducted their sessions, emphasizing imitation of verbal and nonverbal behaviors (Druckman & Swets, 1988, Chapter 8). This then led the committee to take up the topic of expert modeling in the second phase of its work."<ref name="druckman2004">Druckman, Daniel (2004) "[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bell/jasp/2004/00000034/00000011/art00002 Be All That You Can Be: Enhancing Human Performance]" ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'', Volume 34, Number 11, November 2004, pp. 2234-2260(27)</ref> 

The follow up study on expertise by Swets and Bjork (1991) concentrated on cognitive apprenticeship, but NLP was not included except by way of acknowledgment for the idea of modeling.<ref name="Druckman & Bjork 1991">John A. Swets and Robert A. Bjork (1991) Enhancing human performance: An Evaluation of "New Age" Techniques Considered by the U.S</ref>. 

Thereafter it would appear that although individual studies continue to be undertaken in a variety of fields, no further major research reviews have been undertaken and NLP was dropped from the [[experimental psychology]] research stream.<ref name="Von Bergen et al 1997">{{cite journal | author=Von Bergen, C W, Barlow Soper, Gary T Rosenthal, Lamar V Wilkinson | title=Selected alternative training techniques in HRD | journal=Human Resource Development Quarterly | year=1997 | volume=8(4) | pages=281-294}}</ref> 

Similarly in the field of psychotherapy it is stated that the "original interest in NLP turned to disillusionment after the research and now it is rarely even mentioned in psychotherapy".<ref name="efran">Efran, J S. Lukens M.D. (1990) Language, structure, and change: frameworks of meaning in psychotherapy, Published by W.W. Norton, New York. p.122</ref>

=====Empirically validated psychotherapy=====

In 1990 Beyerstein categorised NLP as 'neuromythology', '[[New Age]]' and a [[pseudoscience]].<ref name="Beyerstein 1990">{{cite journal | author=Beyerstein. B.L| title=Brainscams: Neuromythologies of the New Age.| journal= International Journal of Mental Health | year=1990 | volume=19(3) | pages=27-36,27 | url=http://www.sfu.ca/psyc/faculty/beyerstein/research/articles/Brainscams,%20Neuromythologies_of_the_New_Age.PDF}}</ref> He asserts that "though it claims neuroscience in its pedigree, NLP's outmoded view of the relationship between cognitive style and brain function ultimately boils down to crude analogies". With reference to all the 'neuromythologies' covered in his article, including NLP, he states "In the long run perhaps the heaviest cost extracted by neuromythologists is the one common to all pseudosciences <U+2014> deterioration in the already low levels of scientific literacy and critical thinking in society". 

That judgment has been supported by others from the mainstream, empirically based psychology community, such as Lilienfield (2002),<ref name="Lilienfeld 2004">Scott O.

Do They Work? | publisher=Jossey Bass  | year=1997 |  id=0787902780 | p.169- 172}}</ref>
Drenth (2003) uses the "movement known by the name NLP" to illustrate his descriptions of [[pseudoscience]], stating "Unlike diagnosis, prediction of human performance or behavior, and assessment, therapy is not an (applied) scientific activity. Criteria for therapeutic activity is effectiveness, not verity;" ... "But what brings some of these therapeutic approaches into the category of pseudoscience is the claim that their presumptions are predicated on scientific understanding and scientific evidence."<ref name="Drenth 1999">Drenth, P.

Drenth (2003) Growing anti-intellectualism in Europe; a menace to science in ALLEA Annual Report pp.60-72' </ref> 
 
Devilly (2005) states that "at the time of its introduction, NLP was heralded as a breakthrough in therapy and advertisements for training workshops, videos and books began to appear in trade magazines. The workshops provided certification... However, controlled studies shed such a poor light on the practice, and those promoting the intervention made such extreme and changeable claims that researchers began to question the wisdom of researching the area further and even suggested that NLP was an untestable theory"..."NLP is no longer as prevalent as it was in the 1970s or 1980s, but is still practiced in small pockets of the human resource community. The science has come and gone, yet the belief still remains". Eisner expresses a similar view.<ref name="Eisner 2000">[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0275964132/ Eisner, D.  (2000) The Death of Psychotherapy: From Freud to Alien Abductions]</ref>{{dubious}}.
 
Opining that proof of the validity of new practices falls on the proponents of these practices, Lilienfield expresses concern that largely untested treatments, amongst which he includes NLP, comprise a major proportion of the interventions delivered by mental health professionals. He raises concerns about the public's overconfidence in mental health professions and the lack of scientific foundation for these professions.<ref name="Lilienfeld 2002"> {{cite journal | author= Lilienfeld, S.O. | title= Our Raisson D<U+2019>etre | journal= The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice | year=2002 | url= http://www.srmhp.org/0101/raison-detre.html | volume=1(1) | pages=20}}</ref>

Self-help critic Steve Salerno states that [[Anthony Robbins]] "made NLP his own, refining it and personalizing it into what he christened "neuroassociative conditioning" (NAC).

==History and development==
{{main|History of neuro-linguistic programming}}

===1970s: Founding and early development===
NLP was co-founded and developed jointly by [[Richard Bandler]] and then UCSC assistant professor of linguistics [[John Grinder]], under the tutelage of noted [[anthropologist]] [[Gregory Bateson]], at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], during the 1960s and 1970s. At that time the Californian [[human potential movement|human potential seminars]] were developing into a viable industry. Gregory Bateson (see [[Esalen Institute]]) was influenced by [[Alfred Korzybski]], particularly his ideas about human modeling and that '[[the map is not the territory]]'. These ideas were adopted by Bandler and Grinder.<ref name="Bandler & Grinder 1975a"/> 

From 1972, the co-founders of NLP had an interest in the exceptional communications skills of gestalt therapist [[Fritz Perls]], family therapist [[Virginia Satir]] and founding president of the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis, [[Milton H. Erickson]]. Subsequently ''Structure of Magic Series (1975)'' and ''Patterns of Milton H. Erickson (1976, 1977)'' were published using those therapists as models. In the late 1970s, [[Leslie Cameron-Bandler]], [[Judith DeLozier]], [[Robert Dilts]], and [[David Gordon]] worked with the co-founders and separately to contribute to the development of NLP.

===1980s: New developments and scientific assessment===
In the 1980s, shortly after publishing ''Neuro-linguistic Programming Volume 1''<ref name="Dilts et al 1980"/> with Robert Dilts and Judith Delozier, Grinder and Bandler fell out. Amidst acrimony and intellectual property lawsuits, NLP started to be developed haphazardly by many individuals. Given the multiplicity of developers and trainers, there was to be no single definitive system of NLP.<ref name="Druckman & Swets 1998">Druckman and Swets (eds) (l988) [http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037921/html/133.html Enhancing Human Performance: Issues, Theories, and Techniques], National Academy Press.</ref> 

Since the early 1980s, John Grinder collaborated with various people to develop a form of NLP called the [[New Code of NLP]] which attempted to restore a whole mind-body systemic approach to NLP <ref>Turtles all the way down, 1987., Whispering in the Wind, 2001</ref>

Richard Bandler also published new processes based on [[Submodalities (NLP)|submodalities]] and [[Ericksonian hypnosis]]. <ref>eg. ''Using Your Brain: For a Change (1984)'', Persuasion Engineering, Design Human Engineering and recent works.</ref>

[[Anthony Robbins]] who taught NLP in the late 1970s, mass marketed various motivational products incorporating aspects of NLP (renamed as ''[[Neuro Associative Conditioning]]''). 

In the late 1980s, Sharpley's (1984, 1987) research reviews in experimental [[counseling psychology]] and by the [[United States National Research Council]] gave NLP an overall negative assessment marking a decrease in NLP research interest.

===1990s: Controversy, division, and marketing===
In July of 1996 after many years of legal controversy, Bandler filed a lawsuit against John Grinder et al, claiming retrospective sole ownership of NLP, and the sole right to use the term under trademark.<ref name="nlp knowledge centre">Cite web: [http://web.archive.org/web/19990224225605/http://www.nlp.com.au/action/state.htm 'NLP Knowledge Centre']</ref><ref name="nlp schedule">Cite web: [http://www.nlpschedule.com/random/lawsuit-nlpc.html 'NLP Schedule']</ref> Contemporaneous with Bandler's suits in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]{{Fact|date=January 2007}}<!-- Please check that this was the correct court. -->, [[Tony Clarkson]] (a UK practitioner) successfully asked the UK High Court to revoke Bandler's UK [[registered trademark]] of "NLP", in order to clarify legally that 'NLP' was a generic term rather than intellectual property.<ref name="anlp news">Cite web: [http://web.archive.org/web/20010406091232/www.anlp.org/anlpnews.htm#law ''ANLP News: NLP Matters'']</ref> 

Despite the NLP community being [[History of neuro-linguistic programming#Splintered|splintered]], most NLP material acknowledges the early work of the co-founders, Bandler and Grinder, and the development group that surrounded them in the 1970s.

===2000s: Legal settlement and government regulation===
In 2001, the law suits were settled with Bandler and Grinder agreeing to be known as co-founders of NLP. Since 1978, a 20 day NLP practitioner certification program had been in existence for training therapists to apply NLP as an adjunct to their professional qualifications. As NLP evolved, and the applications began to be extended beyond therapy - new ways of training were developed and the course structures and design changed. Course lengths and style vary from institute to institute. In the 1990s, following attempts to put NLP on a more formally regulated footing in the UK, other governments began certifying NLP courses and providers, such as in Australia for example, where a [http://www.ntis.gov.au/?/AccreditedCourse/21576VIC graduate certificate]in Neuro-linguistic programming is accredited under the [[Australian Qualifications Framework|Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF)]].<ref name="ntis">Cite web: [http://www.ntis.gov.au/?/AccreditedCourse/21576VIC ''NTIS: Graduate Certificate in Neuro-linguistic programming'']</ref>However, NLP continues to be an open field of training with no 'official' best practice. With different authors, individual trainers and practitioners having developed their own methods, concepts and labels, often branding them as "NLP",<ref name="skepdic">{{cite web | author=Carroll, Robert T. | title=The Skeptic's Dictionary | url=http://skepdic.com/neurolin.html | publisher=. | accessdate=2003}}</ref> the training standards and quality differ greatly.<ref name="schutz"/> In Europe, the [http://www.eanlpt.org/ European NLP therapy association]has been promoting their training in line with European therapy standards. The multiplicity and general lack of controls has led to difficulty discerning the comparative level of competence, skill and attitude in different NLP trainings. According to Peter Sch<U+00FC>tz the length of training in Europe varies from 2-3 days, for the hobbyist, to 35-40 days over at least nine months to achieve a professional level of competence.<ref name="schutz">Peter Sch<U+00FC>tz (Accessed 24th December 2006) [http://www.nlpzentrum.at/institutsvgl-english.htm A consumer guide through the multiplicity of NLP certification training: A European perspective]</ref>

==Classifying NLP==
{{RRevised|22 December 2006}}
{{See also|NLP and science|List of studies on Neuro-linguistic programming}}

===Associations with science===
NLP's association with science has been complex and controversial.  [[Robert Dilts]] and [[Judith Delozier]] claim "NLP is rooted in the synthesis of three areas of modern science: [[neurophysiology]], [[linguistics]] and [[cybernetics]] ([[computer programming]])."<ref name="Dilts & Delozier 2000">{{cite book | last = Dilts | first =  Robert B | coauthors =  DeLozier, Judith A | title = Encyclopedia of Systemic Neuro-Linguistic Programming and NLP New Coding | publisher = NLP University Press |date= 2000  | url = http://www.nlpuniversitypress.com/ | id = ISBN 0970154003}}</ref> Grinder & Bostic St Clair (2001) make suggestions about what needs to be done next to "improve the practice [of NLP] and take its rightful place as a scientifically based endeavor with its precise focus on one of the extremes of human behavior: excellence and the high performers who actually do it."<ref name="Grinder & Bostic St Clair 2001">{{cite book  | author=Grinder, John & Carmen Bostic St Clair  | title=Whispering in the Wind   | publisher=CA: J & C Enterprises. | year=2001 | pages=  | id=ISBN 0-9717223-0-7}}</ref> They ask those interested to work with researchers in [[cognitive linguistics]] and [[neuroscience]] to begin to improve the relationship with those fields.
 
In the introduction to ''The Structure of Magic Series'', [[Gregory Bateson]] says that Bandler and Grinder "create the beginnings of an appropriate theoretical base for the describing of human interaction......Grinder and Bandler "have succeeded in making linguistics into a base for theory and simultaneously into a tool for therapy."<ref name="Bandler & Grinder 1975a">{{cite book | author=Bandler, Richard & John Grinder | title=The Structure of Magic I: A Book About Language and Therapy | location=Palo Alto, CA | publisher=Science & Behavior Books | year=1975}}</ref>

However, psycholinguist Willem Levelt (1996) stated "NLP is not informed about linguistics literature, it is based on vague insights that were out of date long ago, their linguistics concepts are not properly construed or are mere fabrications, and conclusions are based upon the wrong premises."... "NLP theory and practice has nothing to do with [[neuroscience|neuroscientific]] insights or [[linguistics]], nor with [[informatics]] or theories of [[computer programming|programming]]".<ref name="Drenth 1999" /><ref name=levelt>Willem Levelt (1996) [http://www.skepsis.nl/nlp.html Hoedt u voor Neuro-Lingu<U+00EF>stisch Programmeren!] Skepter Vol.9(3)</ref> Cognitive neuroscience researcher Michael C Corballis (1999) agrees and says that "NLP is a thoroughly fake title, designed to give the impression of [[rigor|scientific respectability]]."<ref name="Corballis 1999">Corballis, M. in Sala (ed) (1999) Mind Myths.  Exploring Popular Assumptions About the Mind and Brain Author: Sergio Della Sala Publisher: Wiley, John & Sons ISBN 0-471-98303-9 p.41</ref> 

Jaap Hollander (1999) in making a number of recommendations for the field of NLP to develop better relationships with science, states that "qualitative scientific inquiry bears a striking resemblance with the process of modelling in NLP. So, NLP, after all, may not be as unscientific as it is often made out to be. Modeling, like qualitative research, uses data from naturalistic settings. Modeling also uses inductive analysis of the data. Rather than testing for the presence of predetermined patterns, the modeler looks for patterns in the observations of the expert, patterns that he or she had not consciously formulated beforehand."<ref name="Hollander 1999">Hollander, J. Ph.D. (1999, November) NLP and Science-Six recommendations for a better relationship [http://www.iepdoc.nl/biblio/artikel_detail.asp?ID=29 Part 1], [http://www.iepdoc.nl/biblio/artikel_detail.asp?ID=30 Part 2], first published in NLP journal/magazine: "NLP World" Nov. 1999 Vol 6(3)</ref>

===Humanistic psychology=== 
Grinder and Delozier (1984) argue that the epistemology of Gregory Bateson (and NLP) attempts to synthesize the overdrawn positions of [[empiricists]]  and [[idealists]].<ref name="Grinder & Delozier 1984">{{cite book  | author=Grinder, John & Judith DeLozier | title=Turtles All the Way Down: Prerequisites to Personal Genius | publisher=Scots Valley, CA: Grinder & Associates. | year=1987 | id=ISBN 1-55552-022-7}}</ref>.  Robert Dilts and Judith Delozier (2000) say "In considering NLP as a science however, it is important to recognise that the [[epistemology]] of NLP is more 'subjective' and '[[systems theory|systematically]]' oriented than many 'hard' sciences, which tend to be more 'objective' and '[[deterministic]]'. That is the patterns explored and identified by NLP are often necessarily contextual and influenced by the perceptual filters of the observer." ... "As a scientific approach, then, NLP tends to be more '[[qualitative]]' than '[[quantitative]]' and more '[[structuralist]]' than '[[materialistic]]'" ...<ref name="Dilts & Delozier 2000">{{cite book | last = Dilts | first =  Robert B | coauthors =  DeLozier, Judith A | title = Encyclopedia of Systemic Neuro-Linguistic Programming and NLP New Coding | publisher = NLP University Press |date= 2000  | url = http://www.nlpuniversitypress.com/ | id = ISBN 0970154003}}</ref>

===Technology===
{{unbalanced-section|This sections gives too much weight to critics. It also focuses on Bandler and Robbins who are not representative of all NLP.}}
NLP critic [[Margaret Singer]] quotes Bandler as saying the term NLP was "phrased on the fly from several book titles on the floor of his car one night when a policeman asked his occupation." (p169). She also quotes Bandler as saying "it wasn't my job to do theory" and Tony Robbins as saying, "NLP is heavily pragmatic: if a tool works, it's included in the model, even if there's no theory to back it up....None of the current NLP developers have done any research to ''prove'' their models correct. The party line is 'pretend it works, try it, and notice the results you get. If you don't get the result you want, try something else'"(p.172)."<ref name="Singer & Lalich 1997">{{cite book | author= Singer, Margaret & Janja Lalich | title=[[Crazy Therapies]]: What Are They? Do They Work? | publisher=Jossey Bass  | year=1997 |  id=0787902780 | p.169- 172}}</ref>
Labouchere states that "NLP has a very pragmatic, applied focus on what is helpful, what works and how to replicate it (Bandler & Grinder, 1990). While NLP draws on and shares common ground with <U+2018>mainstream<U+2019> [[cognitive psychology]], it has, from its inception, continued to develop, refine, and apply its own unique range of concepts, models and techniques." <ref name="Labouchere 2004">Peter Labouchere (2004) [http://www.ee4.org/Papers/EE4_Labouchere.pdf Using participatory story telling, forum theatre and NLP concepts and techniques to create powerful learning experiences around issues of HIV prevention, support and positive living] paper presented at at ''EE4 - Fourth International Entertainment Education Conference''</ref>

Partridge (2003) states that "NLP may be best thought of as a system of psychology concerned with the self development of the human being" and "It is concerned with the function of belief rather than its nature. It is not concerned whether a belief is true or not, but whether it is empowering or disempowering". Similarly, [[Stephen J. Hunt]] states that NLP "is a technique rather than an organised religion and is used by several different [[human potential movement]]s"<ref name="Hunt 2003">Hunt, Stephen J. (2003) [http://books.google.com.au/books?vid=ISBN0754634108 Alternative Religions: A Sociological Introduction] ISBN 0-7546-3410-8</ref>.  [[David V. Barrett]] (2001) also describes NLP as a technique or series of techniques, or a process. He states that that "the balance comes down against it being labeled as a religion."<ref name="Barrett 2001">David V. Barrett (2001) [http://books.google.com.au/books?vid=ISBN1844030407 The New Believers: A Survey of Sects, Cults and Alternative Religions] Available online from Google Books. pp.434,26</ref>.
