'''Rika's Landing Roadhouse''', also known as '''Rika's Landing Site''' or the '''McCarty Roadhouse''', is a [[roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]] located at a historically important crossing of the [[Tanana River]], off mile 274.5 of the [[Richardson Highway]] in [[Big Delta, Alaska|Big Delta]], in the [[Southeast Fairbanks Census Area, Alaska|Southeast Fairbanks Census Area]], [[Alaska]], [[United States]].

The roadhouse is named after Rika Wallen, who obtained it from John Hajdukovich and operated it for many years. It became a hub of activity in that region of the interior. With the construction of the [[ALCAN Highway|ALCAN]] (now Alaska) Highway and the replacement of the ferry with a bridge downstream, patronage declined. The roadhouse is in the [[Big Delta State Historical Park]] and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976.<ref name='nris' />

== Background ==
The [[Richardson Highway]], an important route through the [[Alaska Interior]] that contributed significantly to development and settlement of the region it traversed, began as a pack trail from the port at [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] to [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]], downstream on the [[Yukon River]] from [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson]]. It was built in 1898 by the [[U.S. Army]] to provide an "all-[[United States|American]]" route to the [[Klondike gold rush|Klondike]] gold fields.<ref name='mp09'>

== Early activity ==
The [[Tanana River]] was one of the major rivers to be crossed along the Valdez-Eagle trail. A ferry was established just upriver of the Tanana's confluence with the [[Delta River]], at a location then called Bates Landing. Bates Landing was about {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the current settlement of [[Delta Junction]], in the area known now as Big Delta. The government collected a ferry toll on the south side from all those traveling northbound.<ref name='ah-djh'>

The [[WAMCATS]] telegraph line was relocated to parallel the trail after a fire. McCarty Station was established at the line's crossing of the Tanana in 1907 to maintain the telegraph. Several log cabins housed the telegraph office, a dispatcher, two repairmen and their supplies.<ref name='bdshp' />

A trading post was constructed on the south bank of the Tanana, at Bates Landing in April 1904 by a prospector named Ben Bennett on his claim of {{Convert|80|acre}}, but Bennett sold the post and land to Daniel G. McCarty in April 1905. However since [[E.T. Barnette]], the founder of Fairbanks, and McCarty's former employer, had financed the goods in the post, Barnette retained ownership of them. The post property, now being used as a roadhouse, soon became known as McCarty's. Another prospector named Alonzo Maxey, and a friend, built Bradley's Roadhouse to compete with McCarty's and by 1907, McCarty's had been transferred to Maxey.<ref name='expNBD'>

Hadukovich had other business interests, including prospecting, freighting, acting as a [[Guide#Hunting guide|hunting guide]] by taking hunting parties into the nearby [[Granite Mountains (Alaska)|Granite Mountains]], and trading with, and advocating for, the [[Athabaskan]] natives,<ref name='pd'>

and was not able to personally operate the roadhouse full-time. As with many informally managed roadhouses, Hadukovich asked travelers to "make themselves at home and leave some money on the table" for what they used.<ref name='rvt' /> Despite this informality, the operations prospered.

or certainly by 1910, the [[Alaska Road Commission]] completed the upgrade, upgrading the trail to a wagon road. The head of the project was Major (later U.S. Army General<ref name='bdshp' />) [[Wilds P. Richardson]], for whom the highway was later named. Stages plied the road, using horse drawn sledges in winter and wagons in summer.<ref name='ah-djh-rh' /> By 1913 the roadhouse was a local center of activity for gold prospectors, local hunters, traders, and freighters.<ref name='bdshp' /><ref name='cdj' />

Meanwhile Erika 'Rika' Wallen, born Lovisa Erika Jakobson in 1874 on a farm near [[<U+00D6>rebro]] [[Sweden]], came to America. She first came to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] with her sister in 1891 to join her brother Carl Jakobson, changing their last names to Wallen. After Carl died in an accident, the sisters moved to [[San Francisco]], Rika taking a job as a cook for the [[Hills Brothers Coffee|Hills Brothers]] coffee family which lasted until the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. In 1916 Rika traveled to [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], it is said "because she thought Alaska would be like Sweden".<ref name='tsw'>

== Rika takes over the Roadhouse ==

After jobs cooking at the [[Kennecott, Alaska|Kennecott]] [[copper]] mine and for a Fairbanks [[boarding house]], Rika made her way to Big Delta, and in 1917,<ref name='bdshp' /> or 1918,<ref name='rvt' /> John Hadukovich hired Rika Wallen to manage operations at the roadhouse, then still known as McCarty's.

Although John had many business interests he was not always solvent. For example, in later years he missed being paid for timber supplied to the [[ALCAN Highway]] project due to not keeping records,<ref name='pd-dnw' /> and in either 1918,<ref name='pd-dnw' /> or 1923,<ref name='bdshp' /> ownership of the roadhouse was transferred to Rika for "$10.00 and other considerations," presumably in lieu of back wages.<ref name='bdshp' /> Their friendship and partnership nevertheless continued for many years, although it was not clear exactly what their relationship was.<ref name='pd-dnw' /> The roadhouse was soon named Rika's following local custom.<ref name='cdj'>

By 1925, Rika had applied for US citizenship, and filed a [[Homestead Act|homestead]] claim on {{Convert|160|acre}}<ref name='ahc' /> where she began growing food and raising livestock, including sheep, chicken, and goats. Sheep provided wool that she wove, and goats that she raised provided milk, butter and cheese.<ref name='ahc' /> She also raised silver fox, ducks, geese, rabbits and honeybees, as well as growing grain using a yoke of oxen for plowing.<ref name='kiss'>

Rika was a natural farmer who was able to successfully grow crops where others failed. She developed a heating and ventilation system for her stable to allow her livestock to successfully survive the harsh winters.<ref name='tsw' />

When Rika bought the roadhouse, it still had dirt floors and rough walls. In order to improve the interior, she scavenged random wallpaper, sometimes using different patterns on different walls of the same room,<ref name='scott' /> and made a hardwood [[parquet floor]] with wooden kerosene crates collected from the freighters and boatmen that patronized the roadhouse.<ref name='rvt' /> Her ability to grow crops and to make a pleasant inn meant that travelers would see a table set with fresh milk and eggs, berries, fish, game, and produce picked from the garden and nearby orchard, before retiring to clean comfortable beds in the multistory building.<ref name='ahc' /> A travelog of the Richardson Highway published in 1929 gave this description of Rika's: "a commodious roadhouse boasting of such luxuries as fresh milk and domestic fowls."<ref name='rvt-f'>

In 1926 or thereabouts, Rika added a wing which she used for additional living space, a liquor store, fur storage and the Big Delta (then known as Washburn)<ref name='ahc' /> Post Office.<ref name='scott' />  She was the postmaster until 1946.<ref name='scott' /> Eventually Rika also homesteaded an adjoining piece of land, bringing her holdings to {{Convert|320|acre}}.

== End of an era ==
In the 1930s, with the construction of the [[Alaska Railroad]] completed in 1922, and due to other factors such as the [[Great Depression]], freight traffic declined. In 1935, the Alaska Road Commission, in an attempt to force shippers to use the railroad, raised the toll at the Tanana ferry crossing to almost 10 dollars a ton. The truckers rebelled at this and a series of skirmishes and pirate ferry operations occurred, lasting until the start of World War II.<ref name='rvtF'>

With the coming of the war, and the construction of the [[ALCAN Highway]] which connected to the Richardson south of Big Delta, traffic waned further. The ferry crossing was replaced by a wooden bridge, and then later, a larger steel bridge some distance downriver, and thus the highway was rerouted away from the roadhouse. Rika operated the roadhouse through the 1940s and early 1950s although in later years guests were by invitation only.<ref name='scott' /> John Hajdukovich died in 1965<ref name='pd-dnw' /> and Rika Wallen died four years later in 1969.<ref name='ta-dj' />

== Big Delta State Historical Park ==
According to Judy Ferguson in ''Parallel Destinies'', a biography of John and Rika:

: ''"For fifty years, Rika was a stake in the ground for the roaming John. While John traded and prospected, Rika ran the hub of the Upper Tanana's cross-roads. Her establishment was "town" to the three hundred people who walked the trails to the Alaskan-Canadian border. John and Rika were the history of the Upper Tanana Valley."''<ref name='furQ'>

Rika's Roadhouse and the adjacent outbuildings and property are now the '''Big Delta State Historical Park'''.<ref name='bdshp' /> In 1976 the roadhouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The structure was restored in 1984 by Stanton and Stanton Construction on a new foundation using original timbers, and with a restoration of the packing crate floor in some areas.<ref name='afg' /> It now functions as a museum and some rooms have been fitted with 1920s-1930s period furniture and accessories donated by local residents.<ref name='bdshp' /> The property also has a food service facility called the "Packhouse Pavilion" operated by a local concessionaire.<ref name='afgpp'>
