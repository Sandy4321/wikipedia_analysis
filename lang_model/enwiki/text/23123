The SNP is also currently the largest group in [[Scottish local government]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the Scottish National Party}}
The SNP was formed in 1934 through the merger of the [[National Party of Scotland]] and the [[Scottish Party]]. [[Douglas Young (classicist)|Professor Douglas Young]], who was the leader of the Scottish National Party from 1942 to 1945 campaigned for the Scottish people to refuse [[conscription]] and his activities were popularly vilified as undermining the [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|British war effort]] against the [[Axis powers]]. Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.

The SNP first won a [[UK Parliament|parliamentary]] seat at the [[Motherwell (UK Parliament constituency)|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but Dr [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[UK general election 1945|general election]] three months later. They next won a seat in 1967, when [[Winnie Ewing]] was the surprise winner of a [[Hamilton by-election, 1967|by-election]] in the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].

The high point in a UK general election was when the SNP polled almost a third of all votes in Scotland at the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 general election]] and returned 11 MPs to [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], to date the most MPs it has had. However, the party experienced a large drop in its support at the 1979 General election, followed by a further drop at the 1983 election.

In the [[Scottish general election, 2007|2007 Scottish Parliamentary general election]] the SNP emerged as the largest party with 47 seats, narrowly ousting the [[Scottish Labour Party]] with 46 seats and [[Alex Salmond]] became [[First Minister of Scotland|Scottish First Minister]]. The [[Scottish Green Party]] supported Salmond's election as First Minister, and his subsequent appointments of ministers, in return for early tabling of the [[Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009|climate change bill]] and the SNP nominating a Green MSP to chair a parliamentary committee.<ref>{{cite news|title=SNP and Greens sign working deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6646227.stm|publisher=BBC News Scotland|accessdate=16 March 2013|date=11 May 2007}}</ref>

In [[Scottish general election, 2011|May 2011]], the SNP won an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament with 69 seats. Overall majorities are unusual in the [[Additional member system (Scottish Parliament)|Additional Member system]] that is used for elections to the Scottish Parliament, which was specially designed by the Labour UK government in 1999 to prevent any party gaining overall control of the parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/alex-salmonds-snp-wins-majority-in-scottish-elections |title=alex-salmonds-snp-wins-majority-in-scottish-elections |publisher=channel4.com |date= |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>

In November 2013, some policies the SNP would pursue in an independent Scotland were detailed in ''[[Scotland's Future]]'', the Scottish Government's 670-page [[white paper]] on the case for Scottish independence and the means through which Scotland would become an independent country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25088251|title=Scottish independence: Referendum White Paper unveiled|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=27 November 2013|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''}}</ref>

==Party organisation==
The SNP consists of local branches of party members. Those branches then form an association in the constituency they represent (unless there is only one branch in the constituency, in which case it forms a constituency branch rather than a constituency association). There are also eight regional associations, to which the branches and constituency associations can send delegates.

The SNP's policy structure is developed at its annual national conference and its regular national council meetings.  There are also regular meetings of its national assembly, at which detailed discussion (but not finalising) of party policy takes place.

The party has an active youth wing, the [[Young Scots for Independence]], as well as a student wing, the [[Federation of Student Nationalists]]. There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently-owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.

The SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC) which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference).  The SNP parliamentarians (Scottish, Westminster and European) and councillors have representation on the NEC, as do the Trade Union Group, the youth wing and the student wing.

According to accounts filed with the [[Electoral Commission (UK)|Electoral Commission]] for the year ending 2010, the party had a membership of 16,232,<ref>[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/119450/Scottish-National-Party-SoA-2010.pdf]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref> up from 15,097 in 2008 and 9,450 in 2003.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/SNP39s-membership-surges-by-6037.4836805.jp SNP's membership surges by 60%], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 1 January 2009</ref> In 2004 the party had income of approximately <U+00A3>1,300,000 (including [[bequest]]s of just under <U+00A3>300,000) and expenditure of about <U+00A3>1,000,000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Policy platform==
The SNP's policy base is mostly in the mainstream European [[social democracy|social-democratic]] mould. For example, among its policies are a commitment to [[unilateral nuclear disarmament]], [[progressive tax|progressive personal taxation]], the eradication of poverty, free [[State school|state education]] including support grants for [[Higher education in Scotland|higher education]] students and a pay increase for nurses. It is also committed to an [[independent Scotland]] being a full [[Member states of the European Union|member state of the European Union]], while retaining the [[pound sterling]] as a part of a [[currency union]] with the UK. The party historically opposed EU membership, viewing it as incompatible with Scottish independence,<ref>Tarditi, Valeria. [https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=epern-working-paper-22.pdf&site=266 "The Scottish National Party<U+2019>s changing attitude towards the European Union"].

Retrieved 16 May 2014.</ref> and former leader [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]], former deputy leader [[Jim Sillars]] and other members continue to oppose; although it is noteworthy that Jim Sillars was the architect for the original pro-European change of stance in 1990, and has a book published to that effect. <ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Independence_in_Europe.html?id=KJCKYgEACAAJ&redir_esc=y]</ref>

</ref> The SNP was historically opposed also to membership of [[NATO]], a reflection of its opposition to nuclear weapons; at its 2012 national conference a vote saw party policy change to support of NATO, on the precondition of the removal of all British nuclear weapons from Scottish bases should independence occur.

Contrary to the assumptions of many outwith the party, the SNP is not [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican]], and its general view is that this is an issue secondary to that of Scottish independence. The current stance of the SNP is that an independent Scotland would retain the monarchy which it currently has as part of the United Kingdom.

Following the party's victory in the 2011 Holyrood election, there will be a referendum on Scottish independence, scheduled to take place on the 18 September 2014,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21828424 |title=Scottish independence: Referendum to be held on 18 September, 2014 |publisher=BBC News |date=21 March 2013 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> with the transition to independence in the event of a Yes vote planned for March 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21331302 |title=Scottish independence: Transition plan' outlined |publisher=BBC News |date=5 February 2013 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>

==Party ideology==
By the 1960s, the party was starting to become defined ideologically. It had by then established a National Assembly which allowed for discussion of policy and was producing papers on a host of policy issues that could be described as based on [[social democracy]]. Also, the emergence of [[William Wolfe]] (universally known as Billy) as a leading figure played a huge role in the SNP defining itself as a left-of-centre and social-democratic party. He recognised the need to do this to challenge the dominant political position of the [[Scottish Labour Party]].

He achieved this in a number of ways: establishing the SNP Trade Union Group; promoting centre-left policies; and identifying the SNP with labour campaigns, such as the [[Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in]] and the attempt of the workers at the Scottish ''[[Daily Express]]'' to run as a [[cooperative]]. (The leader of the [[Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in]], the late [[Jimmy Reid]], would later join the SNP.)<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-10919851</ref> It was during Wolfe's period as SNP leader in the 1970s that the SNP became clearly identified as a social-democratic political party.

There were some ideological tensions in the 1970s SNP.  The party leadership under Wolfe was determined to stay on the left of the [[Politics of Scotland|Scottish political spectrum]] and be in a position to challenge the Labour Party.  However, the party's MPs, mostly representing seats won from the [[Scottish Conservative Party|Scottish Conservatives]], were less keen to have the SNP viewed as a centre-left alternative to Labour, for fear of losing their seats back to the Conservatives.

For the party manifestos for the two 1974 general elections, the SNP finally self-identified itself as a social-democratic party,<ref name="Hassan2009">{{cite book|author=Gerry Hassan|title=The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FgouLRV2DzoC&pg=PA121|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3991-5|page=121}}</ref> and there was an abandoned proposal at the 1975 party conference of renaming the party to the Scottish National Party (Social Democrats).<ref name="Hepburn2013">{{cite book|author=Eve Hepburn|title=New Challenges for Stateless Nationalist and Regionalist Parties|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96596-1|page=143}}</ref>

There were further ideological and internal struggles after 1979 with the [[79 Group]] attempting to move the SNP further to the left, away from being what could be described a "social-democratic" party, to an expressly "[[socialism|socialist]]" party.  Members of the 79 Group including current leader Alex Salmond were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a "broad church", apart from arguments of left vs. right.

The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the [[left-wing politics|political left]], for example running campaigns against the [[community charge|poll tax]]. It developed this platform to the stage it is at now: a clear, moderate, centre-left political party. This has itself not gone without internal criticism from the left of the party who believe that in modern years the party has become too moderate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The ideological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by the arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a "step-by-step" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, although much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.

This grouping of "neo-fundamentalists" have their roots within the camp of the former high-profile Labour Party MP [[Jim Sillars]] who left Labour to form the short-lived [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party]] in 1976 (the party had no connection with the [[UK Labour Party]] or the current [[Scottish Labour]] group in the Scottish Parliament). Sillars eventually joined the SNP, winning the Govan, Glasgow, by-election in 1988 to become an SNP MP. He lost the Westminster seat at the 1992 general election and expressed his disappointment by calling the Scottish people "ninety minute patriots". Jim Sillars has since become a vocal critic of Alex Salmond.

Many political analysts take the view that the commitment of ordinary members and leaders to independence is so strong that many of the tensions that arise over internal disagreements over policy are often set aside. However increased media attention on the SNP in the run-up to the referendum has made some of these tensions more visible to the general public. These internal tensions within the SNP have become very acute in [[Argyll and Bute]], where one SNP councillor, Fred Hall, quit the SNP in April 2013, while 4 more SNP councilors, Roddy McCuish (who was leader of the SNP Group in Argyll and Bute Council at the time), Mary Jean Devon (previously a defector from the Liberal Democrats), Robert MacIntyre, and Michael Breslin quit the SNP in October 2013, which led to the collapse of the former SNP-Independent coalition in Argyll and Bute Council.

==European affiliation==
The SNP retains close links with [[Plaid Cymru]], its counterpart in [[Wales]]. [[UK MPs|MPs]] of both parties co-operate closely with each other. They work as a single group within the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and were involved in joint campaigning during the [[2005 UK General Election|2005 General Election]] campaign. Both the SNP and Plaid Cymru are members of the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA), a [[European political party]] for [[regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] national-level political parties. The EFA co-operates with the larger [[European Green Party]] to form [[The Greens<U+2013>European Free Alliance]] (Greens/EFA) group in the [[European Parliament]].

Prior to its affiliation with The Greens<U+2013>European Free Alliance, the SNP had previously been allied with the [[European Progressive Democrats]] (until 1984), [[Rainbow Group (1989<U+2013>1994)|Rainbow Group]] (1989<U+2013>1994) and [[European Radical Alliance]] (1994<U+2013>1999).

==Criticism==

===Accusations of Anglophobia===
Some critics of the SNP accuse the party of being [[Anglophobia|Anglophobic]]. As James Maxwell points out, such allegations have a long history in British politics, becoming particularly pronounced since the rise of the SNP in Labour's West of Scotland heartlands in the 1960s and 70s.<ref>http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2012/04/scottish-labour-party-snp</ref>

During his time as a Liberal Democrat MSP, [[Jamie Stone]] was forced to apologise after calling the SNP "[[xenophobia|xenophobic]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/10213416.stm|title=Lib Dem MSP Jamie Stone to quit Holyrood at election|date=2 June 2010|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=12 July 2010}}</ref> In 2000, the Labour Party claimed that two SNP MSPs were anti-[[English people|English]] after they "registered their support for Germany's [[FIFA World Cup hosts#2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 FIFA World Cup]] bid on its official website" which was then a rival to England's 2006 World Cup bid.<ref name="SNP's German support condemned">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/625090.stm |title=SNP's German support condemned |publisher=BBC News |date=30 January 2000 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref> The SNP responded that they "have no position on where the World Cup is held" and that it was "silly to describe the website entry as anti-English".<ref name="SNP's German support condemned"/> More recently, former Conservative Prime Minister [[John Major]] and former Conservative Cabinet minister [[John Redwood]] have branded the SNP "anti-English".<ref>http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/political-news/redwood-snp-anti-english.17045479</ref>

The SNP have been quick to refute any suggestions of Anglophobia within the party. Former SNP MSP [[Ian McKee]] pointed out in a speech to the Scottish Parliament that, as an Englishman, he was evidence of there being no such anti-English feeling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-07/sor1206-02.htm |title=The Scottish Parliament - Official Report |publisher=Scottish.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref> Indeed, McKee was then one of seven SNP MSPs born in England.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7342692.stm</ref> Other prominent English-born figures in the party include prospective MEP [[Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh]], [[Christine Grahame]] MSP, [[Stuart McMillan]] MSP, [[Nigel Don]] MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning [[Michael Russell (politician)|Mike Russell]], Cabinet Secretary for the Commonwealth Games, Sport, Equalities and Pensioners' Rights [[Shona Robison]] and the party's Westminster leader [[Angus Robertson]] MP.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/>

In 2007/08, 6.7% of SNP members were found to have been born in England, "not far below the 8.1% recorded in the 2001 census for the population as a whole".<ref name="The Modern SNP 2009, p. 70">"The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power", edited by Gerry Hassan, Edinburgh University Press: Edinburgh, 2009, p. 70</ref> Nearly half - 47.2% - of the party reported having lived in England.<ref name="The Modern SNP 2009, p. 70"/>

The SNP's founder, [[R.B. Cunninghame Graham]] is famously quoted as saying: "The enemies of Scottish Nationalism are not the English, for they were ever a great and generous folk, quick to respond when justice calls. Our real enemies are among us, born without imagination."<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radioscotland/2012/09/the-cause-a-history-of-scottis.shtml |title=The Cause: A History of Scottish Nationalism |publisher=BBC Radio Scotland |date=21 September 2012 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> Graham was, along with close friend [[Keir Hardie]], one of the founders<U+2014>indeed, the first president<U+2014>of the [[Scottish Labour Party]] in 1888.<ref name="BBC" /> The party's current leader, [[Alex Salmond]], told the ''Guardian'' newspaper in 2011 that he believed England to be "a great country" of which he was personally very fond.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP0F2BeEQag</ref>

===Accusations of "cash for policies"===

The party has been criticised over a <U+00A3>500,000 donation from the [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] transport businessman [[Brian Souter]]. One month later, in April 2007, the SNP's commitment (made at the party's 2006 conference) to re-regulate the bus network was not included in their 2007 manifesto, although the SNP denies any direct link.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=539&id=621242007 |title=SNP under attack after bus U-turn |publisher=Business.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=20 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> Opposition politicians suggested that the donation and policy shift were linked and that it was a case of "cash for policies", although no official accusations have been made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1346656.0.snp_accused_of_dumping_bus_plan_to_please_millionaire_backer.php |title=SNP accused of dumping bus plan to please millionaire backer |publisher=Sundayherald.com |date=21 April 2007 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref> In spite of Souter's strong opposition,<ref>http://www.christianstogether.net/Articles/287632/Christians_Together_in/Christian_Life/Christians_and_Politics/SNP_millionaire_supporters.aspx</ref> the SNP government moved to legalise same-sex marriage in Scotland. In February 2014, with the overwhelming backing of SNP MSPs, as well as cross-party support, the Scottish Parliament voted to approve the SNP government's plans.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25960225</ref>

Souter went on to make a further donation of <U+00A3>125,000 to the SNP, making him their single biggest donor at that time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Swanson |first=Ian |url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/latestnews/SNP-faces-hovercraft-dustup.3719954.jp |title=SNP faces hovercraft dust-up |publisher=Edinburghnews.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref> Souter made approaches to the SNP government for a <U+00A3>3&nbsp;million subsidy for his company, [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]], to develop a [[hovercraft]] service between [[Kirkcaldy]] and [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]] in Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Hutcheon |url=http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1807832.0.snp_donor_in_3_3m_hovercraft_subsidy_plea.php |title=SNP donor in <U+00A3>3.3m hovercraft subsidy plea |publisher=Sundayherald.com |date=3 November 2007 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref> The service had already received subsidy from the previous Labour administration for the pilot scheme, but was put on hold pending "clarification" of the public sector's involvement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7253201.stm |title=Scotland &#124; Edinburgh, East and Fife &#124; Row over Forth hovercraft freeze |publisher=BBC News |date=19 February 2008 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref>
