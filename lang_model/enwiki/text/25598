The '''Georgia and Florida Railway''' {{Reporting mark|GFRR}} is a [[Short-line railroad|short line railroad]] operating in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Florida]], and is a subsidiary of [[OmniTRAX]]. The railroad spans {{Convert|297|mi|km}} over numerous different rail lines, most of which radiate out of [[Albany, Georgia]].<ref name="GFRR1">{{cite web |url=http://www.omnitrax.com/rail_gfrr.aspx# |title=Georgia & Florida Railway |accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref>

Primary commodities include corn, scrap metal, chemicals, ethanol, cement, paper, cottonseed, clay wood pulp, peanuts, fertilizer, beer, aggregates and others, generating 21,000 annual carloads.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiarailroad.org/gaflorida.html |title=Georgia Railroad Association: Georgia & Florida Railway |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref>

==History==

Upon its start on April 14, 1995 the railroad was named the '''Georgia and Florida Railroad''' and was a [[Gulf and Ohio Railways|Gulf & Ohio]] subsidiary operating over two lines: Albany to [[Sparks, Georgia|Sparks]], and [[Valdosta, Georgia|Valdosta]] to [[Nashville, Georgia|Nashville]] over former Norfolk Southern tracks.<ref name="Lewis1">{{cite book |title=American Shortline Railway Guide |edition=5 |last=Lewis |first=Edward A. |year=1996 |publisher=Kalmbach Publishing Company |isbn=0890242909 |pages=130-131 |}}</ref>

===Original System===

Initially the railroad consisted of approximately {{Convert|130|mi|km}} of track over two separate branches, including trackage rights over [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] to link the disconnected lines. Upon its start, the railroad hauled grain, peanuts, fertilizer, woodchips, and beer, totaling around 10,000 carloads.<ref name=Lewis1 />

====Albany - Sparks====

The Albany - Sparks route actually consists of two different routes meeting at [[Moultrie, Georgia|Moultrie]]. The Albany - Moultrie portion was completed by the [[Georgia Northern Railway]] in 1905.<ref name=Lewis1 /> In 1966, the [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern]] acquired the Georgia Northern and it was merged with the [[Albany and Northern Railway]] subsidiary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railga.com/gnorth.html |title=Georgia Northern Railroad |date=8 August 2010 |accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref> 

The second section from Moultrie to Sparks was originally constructed by the [[Sparks Western Railway]], however, the railroad was acquired by the [[Georgia and Florida Railroad (1926<U+2013>1963)|Georgia and Florida Railway]] in 1910, with the line being completed in 1911. The G&F became a subsidiary of the Southern in 1963.<ref name="GFR">{{cite web |url=http://www.railga.com/gafl.html |title=Georgia & Florida Railway |date=8 August 2010 |accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref>

Both sections, including a bypass around Moultrie, officially became part of Norfolk Southern in 1990 and were leased to the Georgia & Florida Railroad beginning in 1995.

====Valdosta - Nashville====

Tracks from Valdosta to Nashville were built by the [[Douglas, Augusta and Gulf Railway]] and became part of the Georgia & Florida around 1906. The Georgia & Florida later became part of the Southern in 1963 and Norfolk Southern in 1990.<ref name=Lewis1 />

In early 2005 changes came to the branch as the [[Georgia Department of Transportation]] purchased the line from the Georgia & Florida, including an additional section of exempted track from Nashville to [[Willacoochee, Georgia|Willacoochee]], {{Convert|16.6|mi|km}}, owned by the city of Willacoochee. Under the agreement, the Georgia & Florida would continue to operate the entirety of the line from Valdosta to Willachoochee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stb.dot.gov/Decisions/readingroom.nsf/8fd5532a0c425c5c8525740f005f36d4/863972f6d4eca32585256fb90056b7f6?OpenDocument&Highlight=0,Willacoochee |title=STB Finance Docket No. 34665 |date=10 March 2005 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> 

===Live Oak, Perry & Georgia===

Starting around 1896 the [[South Georgia Railroad]] built a line south from a point near Adel to [[Quitman, Georgia|Quitman]]. The line was extended further to [[Greenville, Florida]] in 1901 where it met the [[South Georgia and West Coast Railway]], which ran from Greenville to [[Perry, Florida]]. The entire line was later reorganized as the [[South Georgia Railway]] and became part of the Southern in 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railga.com/soga.html |title=South Georgia Railroad |date=24 July 2005 |accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref>

On December 15, 1995 the LOP&G was purchased as a subsidiary of Gulf & Ohio. The railroad ran from [[Adel, Georgia]] to [[Foley, Florida]], {{Convert|80|mi|km}}, and was operated by the Georgia & Florida.

===Consolidation and Acquisition by RailNet===

On January 21, 1999 Gulf & Ohio consolidated its holdings in the region under a single entity and sold the new network - including the two branches of the neighboring [[Atlantic and Gulf Railroad (1991<U+2013>1999)|Atlantic & Gulf]] railroad - to [[North American RailNet|RailNet]]. The new railroad was renamed '''Georgia and Florida RailNet'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stb.dot.gov/Decisions/readingroom.nsf/8fd5532a0c425c5c8525740f005f36d4/24c5bfd987dfa7f685256768006bf35c?OpenDocument&Highlight=0,33716 |title=STB Finance Docket No. 33716 |date=13 May 1999 |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stb.dot.gov/Decisions/readingroom.nsf/WEBUNID/B2E7FD42E9102A1185256768006BF40B?OpenDocument |title=STB Finance Docket No. 33717 |date=13 May 1999 |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref>

===OmniTRAX===

OmniTRAX acquired the entire Georgia & Florida RailNet in 2005, renaming the railroad '''Georgia and Florida Railway'''. 

A boon came to the railroad in 2006 as an ethanol plant was planned for Camilla, Georgia. The new facility was expected to generate significant traffic for the line when it opened in late 2008. However, due to financial difficulties experienced by the facility, it is unclear whether the effect on the G&F railroad will remain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Urvaksh |first1=Karkaria |year=2009 |title=$196M Georgia Ethanol Plant Facing Bankruptcy |journal=Atlanta Business Chronicle |url= http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2009/08/24/story1.html?page=1 |}}</ref>
