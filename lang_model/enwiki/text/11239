The war was fought between factions of [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and [[Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria|Maximilian III]], with Sigismund eventually being crowned [[King of Poland]] and [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]]. Two major battles of this conflict included the [[Siege of Krak<U+00F3>w (1587)|Siege of Krak<U+00F3>w]], in which Maximilian III failed to capture the capital of the Commonwealth, and the [[Battle of Byczyna]], in which Maximilian he was forced to surrender. Sigismund's victory was significantly the doing of [[kanclerz|Chancellor]] and [[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]], who stood behind both the political intrigue and the military victories of this conflict.

==Background==
In 1576, following the death of previous [[Polish king]], [[Stefan Batory]], the [[Sweden|Swedish]] king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria]] took part in the [[Royal elections in Poland|election to the joint Polish&ndash;Lithuanian throne]].<ref name="Davies2005"/><ref name="HaleckiReddaway"/> Each of the two candidates had supporters in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] with the two opposing sides gathered around pro-Sigismund [[kanclerz|Chancellor]] and [[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]] and the [[Primate of Poland]], [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Karnkowski]] on one side and the pro-Maximilain [[Zborowski]] family on the other.<ref name="Davies2005">{{cite book|author=Norman Davies|title=God's Playground: The origins to 1795|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=07vm4vmWPqsC&pg=PA328|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=30 March 2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231128179|pages=328}}</ref><ref name="HaleckiReddaway">{{cite book|author1=Oskar Halecki|author2=W: F.

Sigismund, supported by Zamoyski and the former king's wife, [[Anna Jagiellon]], was elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth on 19 August 1587 and recognized as such by the ''[[Interrex (Poland)|interrex]]'', the Primate Karnkowski.<ref name="HaleckiReddaway"/> However, the election was disputed by the other candidate, [[Maximilian III of Austria]], and opponents of Sigismund chose not to respect the election outcome, decreeing that Maximilian was the rightful monarch three days later, on 22 August.<ref name="Stone2001">{{cite book|author=Daniel Stone|title=The Polish-Lithuanian state, 1386-1795|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA131|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=1 September 2001|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=9780295980935|pages=131<U+2013>132}}</ref><ref name="HaleckiReddaway"/> Zborowscy called for the [[rokosz]] (legitimate right to rebel), and the election ended in chaos, with several killed and many wounded.<ref name=les/> For both Zamoyski and Zborowski, loosing was not an option, as they knew the loosing side would likely face severe price, from confiscations and prestige loss to a possible death sentence for treason.<ref name=les/>

Neither Sigismund nor Maximilian were present in the Commonwealth at that time.<ref name="HaleckiReddaway"/> After receiving news of his election, both Sigismund and Maximilan made haste for Poland.<ref name="HaleckiReddaway"/> Sigismund arrived at [[Danzig]] (Gda<U+0144>sk) on the 28 September, and after approximately two weeks he had departed to [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], where he arrived in 9 December and was crowned on 27 December.<ref name="HaleckiReddaway"/>

Maximilian attempted to resolve the dispute by bringing a military force to Poland <U+2013> thereby starting the [[War of the Polish Succession (1587-1588)|War of the Polish Succession]].<ref name="Stone2001"/> He took [[Star<U+00E1> <U+013D>ubov<U+0148>a|Lubowla]], but after a failed attempt to [[Siege of Krak<U+00F3>w (1587)|storm Krak<U+00F3>w]] (the capital of Poland) in late 1587, successfully defended by Zamoyski, he retreated to gather more reinforcements, but was pursued by the forces loyal to Sigismund.<ref name="Stone2001"/><ref name="HaleckiReddaway"/> While waiting for reinforcements, he was defeated at the [[Battle of Byczyna]] on January 1588, and forced to surrender.<ref name=les/> This marked the end of this conflict.<ref name=les/>

==Aftermath==
After the intervention of a papal envoy, Maximilian was released, but only after spending thirteen months as a "guest" of Zamoyski.<ref name=les/> In the [[Treaty of Bytom and B<U+0119>dzin]] (signed on 9 March 1589) Maximilian had to renouce the Polish crown, and [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] had to pledge not to make any alliances against Poland with the [[Muscovy]] or [[Sweden]].<ref name=les/> The town of [[Star<U+00E1> <U+013D>ubov<U+0148>a|Lubowla]], taken early in the conflict by Maximilian, was returned to Poland.<ref name=les/> Upon his return to [[Vienna]] he failed to honor his pledge and renounce his claim to the Polish crown (he would do so only in 1598).<ref name="Stone2001"/><ref name=les/> Nonetheless, there would be no serious military tensions between the Commonwealth and the Hapsburgs, as each would quickly became concerned with other issues.
