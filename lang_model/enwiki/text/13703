'''Ahn Eak-tai''' (1906-1965) was a [[Korea]]n [[European classical music|classical]] composer and conductor. He conducted numerous major orchestras across Europe, including the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Rome Philharmonic Orchestra.<ref name="KBS"/> Ahn composed the ''[[Aegukga]]'', now the national anthem of [[South Korea]], ''Korean Dance'',<ref name="DYNAMIC">{{cite web |url= http://dynamic-korea.com/culture/view.php?main=LEC&uid=200600034495|title= Korean Patriot<U+2019>s Musical Scores Uncovered|accessdate=2006-11-29 |format= |work= }}</ref> ''Nongae'',<ref name="DYNAMIC"/> and the ''Symphonic Fantasy Korea''. His unpublished works, some of which having been discovered recently, include ''Poema Synfonic <U+2018>Mallorca'', ''Lo Pi Formentor'', and ''The Death of Emperor Gojong''.<ref name="DYNAMIC"/>

Ahn Eak-tai was born during the [[Japanese occupation]], and attended a school staffed by catholic missionaries. There he was availed with participation as a trumpet player in the school orchestra to begin his interest in music. He received higher education from the Kunitachi Music School in Japan, and at the [[University of Cincinnati]], and the [[Curtis Institute of Music]] in the [[United States]] during the [[Great Depression]]. Ahn continued his study at [[Vienna]] under [[Bernhard Paumgartner]], and under Professor Kodai at the [[University of Budapest]] in [[Hungary]]. Upon a second visit to Vienna, Ahn received assistance from [[Richard Strauss]] to bring ''Symphonic Fantasy Korea'' to near completion. Beginning with a concert in Budapest, Ahn spent the next five years conducting in Europe. Escalation of the [[World War II]] brought Ahn to Spain, where he met Talabella Lolita, his future wife. After their marriage in 1946, the two moved to the United States, where Ahn conducted Philadelphia Orchestra. Then, in 1955, Ahn returned to South Korea, and established and conducted the [[Seoul Philharmonic]] until his death.

==Early life and education==
Ahn was born in [[Pyongyang]], Korea, on [[December 5]], [[1906]], as the third son of Ahn Dukhoon (<U+C548><U+B355><U+D6C8>). Ahn's family was a branch of the extended family of Ahn Soon-hoong (<U+C548><U+C21C><U+D765>), renowned for having produced patriots such as [[An Chang-ho]] (<U+C548><U+CC3D><U+D638>) and [[An Jung-geun]] (<U+C548><U+C911><U+ADFC>).<ref>pp. 6-7 Baek Sukgi</ref> Ahn's father desired western education for his children, and sent the eldest son Ahn Iksam to [[Tokyo]] to attend Japanese schools. Iksam, aware of Ahn's interest in music, enabled Ahn to take his initiatives by buying him a [[Suzuki violin]], and a [[phonograph]] and records.<ref name="DAUM">{{cite web |url= http://enc.daum.net/dic100/viewContents.do?&m=all&articleID=b14a3218a|title= <U+C548><U+C775><U+D0DC>[<U+5B89><U+76CA><U+6CF0>]

In 1914, at the age of ten, Ahn was admitted to the Pyeongyang Jongro Botong School.<ref name="cucucu">{{cite web |url= http://www.cucucu.com/ezboard/ezboard.cgi?db=korean&action=read&dbf=28&page=0&depth=1|title= Han-gook-in, Han-gook-in|accessdate=2007-01-06 |format= |work= }}</ref> Around the same time, Ahn began to play the [[trumpet]].<ref name="hishkim">{{cite web |url= http://hishkim.com.ne.kr/l/comp/aniktae.htm|title= <U+C548><U+C775><U+D0DC> (<U+5B89><U+76CA><U+6CF0><U+318D>1905<U+B144>~1965<U+B144>)|accessdate=2007-01-06 |format= |work= <U+C2DC><U+B300><U+BCC4> <U+B300><U+D45C><U+C801><U+C778> <U+C791><U+ACE1><U+AC00>}}</ref> In 1918, Ahn was admitted to the Pyeongyang Soongsil Middle School<ref name="DAUM"/>, where he participated in the school orchestra; Iksam gave Ahn a cello as a congratulatory gift.<ref>p. 10 Baek Sukgi</ref> To find a tutor for cello, Dr. Mauri, the principal of the middle school, made connection for Ahn to a Canadian missionary called Mr. Greg.<ref name="DAUM"/><ref name="hishkim"/>

In 1919, Dr. Mauri led the school orchestra into participating in the [[March 1st Movement]], a nationwide effort among Koreans to protest against the [[Japanese Occupation|Japanese rule]] over the peninsula.<ref>p. 13 'Baek Sukgi</ref> From this experience, Ahn developed fervor for the [[Korean independence movement]], and began a student-held movement to protest against pro-Japanese teachers; the school deemed Ahn's actions as inappropriate, and sentenced retributions accordingly. Sometime in September, Ahn involved himself with an effort to raid a jail in order to rescue the March 1st Movement activists caught by the Japanese police. When the police raided one of the meetings, Ahn successfully fled to Dr. Mauri's. The doctor treated Ahn's injuries for a week, and, upon receiving requests from the police to submit Ahn, made a personal visit to the local police station to discuss alternatives. Impressed with Dr. Mauri's character, the department head let Ahn bypass imprisonment by forging papers that permitted Ahn to study music in [[Tokyo]].<ref name="ahneaktai">{{cite web |url= http://www.ahneaktai.or.kr/|title= Ahn Eak Tai Foundation|accessdate=2007-01-06 |format= |work= }}</ref>

==Study in Japan==
On [[October 6]], [[1919]], Ahn took a train to [[Busan]] and boarded a ship toward [[Shimonoseki]]. During his stay with brother Iksam, Ahn succeeded in entering the Tokyo Seisoku Middle School<ref name="KBS"/>. In 1926, Ahn was accepted to the [[Kunitachi Music School]].<ref name="DAUM"/> On the summer of that year, Ahn came back to Korea on a music performance trip to gather funds for the reconstruction of a burned down church. He happened to meet [[Yi Sangjae]], the founder of the [[Dokrip Newspaper]],<ref>p. 31-32 Baek Sukgi</ref> and [[Jo Mansik]], an independence movement leader who advocated the use of Korean-made products so that Koreans' debts might be paid. Upon Jo's request, Ahn led a demonstration promoting the use of Korean commodities by playing his cello in an automobile.

In 1928, Ahn's father died, and his mother faced financial difficulty in providing all five of her sons education. Therefore, Ahn was hired into a luxurious restaurant as a cellist.<ref name="ahneaktai"/> Even then, Ahn could not fully pay for the tuition, and the school disallowed Ahn to graduate. Furthermore, Ahn accidentally broke his cello, and had to borrow his classmates'. One of Ahn's Japanese peers expressed his respect for Ahn by purchasing him a new Suzuki violin. Eventually, Ahn was able to graduate when his teacher Hansford paid for all of Ahn's due tution fees.<ref>p. 41-42 Baek Sukgi</ref> Ahn had a late graduation, and, although it was for one person, it proceeded as if it were for many. Upon his teachers' proposals, Ahn performed a concert with his cello; at this performance, a Japanese newspaper appraised Ahn as "the genius with bright future".<ref>p. 43 Baek Sukgi</ref>

In May 1930, Ahn returned to Korea. Upon his visit to the Soongsil Middle School, Dr. Mauri suggested to Ahn about continuing his study in the [[United States]]. After being prohibited by the Japanese police from holding a concert, Ahn concluded that to follow Dr. Mauri's advice would be necessary to avoid the social barriers placed on the Koreans.<ref>p. 45-46 Baek Sukgi</ref>

==United States==
Upon arriving in [[San Francisco]], Ahn was jailed during the scanning process of the immigrants because he refused to hand his cello over to the officials. During the night, Ahn obtained permission from a prison guard to practice on his confiscated cello; unable to make connection between a musician and a criminal, the prison guard investigated the cause of Ahn's imprisonment and arranged for his release the next day.<ref>p. 50 Baek Sukgi7</ref>

Back in San Francisco, Ahn went to a Korean church introduced by Dr. Mauri. During a service led by Pastor Hwang, Ahn heard the first Korean national anthem, which was based on a Scottish song, "[[Auld Lang Syne]]",<ref name="PRIME">{{cite web |url= http://www.opm.go.kr/warp/webapp/content/view?meta_id=english&id=22|title= Anthem|accessdate=2007-01-06 |format= |work= National Symbols}}</ref>. Ahn thought of the tune as unfit for a national anthem, and decided to try composing a new national anthem for Korea.<ref>p. 54 Baek Sukgi</ref> As Ahn waited in the train station to head toward [[Cincinnati]], Pastor Hwang gifted him a black suitcase, and a [[fountain pen]] to write the national anthem.<ref>p. 58 Baek Sukgi</ref>

As arranged by Pastor Hwang, Ahn met Park Wonjung, Ahn's senior alumni at the Soongsil Middle School and the Kunitachi Music School, at the train station. Park, then a student a the [[University of Cincinnati]] College-Conservatory of Music, assisted Ahn to enter the the conservatory.<ref name="topianet">{{cite web |url= http://www.topianet.co.kr/topia/4/4D/41d0901ye.htm|title= <U+C548><U+C775><U+D0DC>|accessdate=2007-01-06 |format= |work= }}</ref><ref name="DAUM"/> Ahn had to work at a restaurant in order to make his living, at a low pay as expected of the [[Great Depression]].<ref>p. 59 Baek Sukgi</ref> In 1930, Ahn was accepted to the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]]<ref name="DAUM"/> as the first cellist,<ref name="cucucu"/> and, during the spring break of his second year, he toured around the United States to play recitals in major cities. In [[New York City]], Ahn was allowed to perform in the [[Carnegie Hall]], a show that New York newspapers wrote about with positive commentaries.<ref>p. 59 Baek Sukgi</ref>

After his successful tour, Ahn changed his career goal from a cellist to a conductor. In 1935, Ahn made a transfer to the [[Curtis Institute of Music]] in the [[University of Pennsylvania]],<ref name="DAUM"/>, and graduated in 1936.<ref name="topianet"/><ref name="DAUM"/> Around this time, Ahn successfully led a choir in Candem Church; having heard about  Ahn and attended a service at the church, [[Leopold Stokowski]] invited him to the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]].<ref>p. 66 Baek Sukgi</ref> On the downside, Ahn was unable to pay his rent, as he was focused in writing his first orchestral score called ''Symphonic Fantasy Korea''; however, the Peables, Ahn's neighbors, offered to pay the rent.<ref>p. 70 Baek Sukgi</ref>

Ahn successfully submitted ''Symphonic Fantasy Korea'' to a competition in the Carnegie Hall, and Ahn was given the chance to conduct the [[New York Philharmonic]] for the work's premiere. However, the performance turned out to be chaotic, as the disrespectful orchestra body refused to fully cooperate. Greatly angered, Ahn threw down his baton. The audience followed with shouts requesting another fresh performance; Ahn refused, expressing his disappointment at the orchestra.<ref>p. 72 Baek Sukgi</ref> The Peables  praised Ahn of his actions, and apologized on behalf of the Americans; they also offered to send Ahn to Europe to study and give support for the tuition.

==Europe==
On [[April 8]], [[1936]], Ahn left [[New York City]], and, upon landing in Europe, headed to [[Berlin]]. Here he completed the ''[[Aegukga]]'' and sent it to a [[Korean independence movement]] organization in San Francisco called the "Korean People Meeting". He also made final touches to the ''Symphonic Fantasy Korea''.<ref>p. 78 Baek Sukgi</ref> Ahn moved to [[Vienna]] in [[Austria]]<ref name="cucucu"/> to study under [[Bernhard Paumgartner]], a famous composer and [[Beethoven]] interpreter. In 1937, Ahn went to [[Hungary]] to study under Professor Kodai, and applied his teachings specific to Asian music to composing the ''Symphonic Fantasy Korea''.<ref name="eighty-three">p. 83 Baek Sukgi</ref><ref name="DAUM"/> 

In 1937, Ahn was invited to [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], to perform ''Symphonic Fantasy Korea''. It easily won the Irish audience, as Ireland had been under the British rule as Korea was under the Japanese occupation.<ref name="eighty-three"/> He then went back to Vienna and met with the famous composer [[Richard Strauss]] to discuss about ''Symphonic Fantasy Korea''. At the same time, Ahn was attending the [[University of Budapest]] with scholarship from the Hungarian government,<ref name="chosun">{{cite web |url= http://www.chosun.com/national/news/200611/200611130590.html|title= <U+201C><U+C548><U+C775><U+D0DC><U+C120><U+C0DD>, <U+D5DD><U+AC00><U+B9AC><U+C815><U+BD80> <U+C7A5><U+D559><U+AE08> <U+BC1B><U+C544> <U+ACF5><U+BD80><U+201D>: <U+D574><U+C678> <U+C720><U+D559> <U+2018><U+D559><U+C801><U+BD80><U+2019> <U+CCAB> <U+BC1C><U+ACAC> <U+CF54><U+B2E4><U+C774> <U+B4F1> <U+B300><U+AC00><U+B85C><U+BD80><U+D130> <U+BC30><U+C6CC>  
|accessdate=2007-01-06 |format= |work= }}</ref> and, in 1939, Ahn graduated from the university. Complimenting on Ahn's talent, Mr. Strauss gave Ahn to conduct a concert in [[Budapest]] in place of him.<ref name="cucucu"/> Unfortunately, Ahn had spent countless hours in preparing for the concert that he collapsed on the last song. Even at this the Hungarian newspapers praised Ahn for his efforts.<ref>p. 90 Baek Sukgi</ref> At Strauss's recommendation, [[Rome Philharmonic Orchestra]] gladly accepted Ahn as its conductor; many other orchestras across Europe followed, and Ahn travelled all over Europe to perform.

In December 1940, Ahn was invited by the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]], the world's greatest orchestra at the time.<ref>p. 91 Baek Sukgi</ref> The German newspapers filled their articles about Ahn with generous praises. Ahn continued to conduct many famous orchestras in Europe. On one occasion, however, Ahn was expelled from the Rome Philharmonic Orchestra for performing the ''Symphonic Korea'', which the Japanese government had discovered as unpleasing.<ref>p. 93 Baek Sukgi</ref> Ahn found another place to work, the [[Orchestre de Paris]], but he was forced to leave in 1944, when [[Paris]] was liberated from the German forces. He was invited by the [[Spanish Embassy|Spanish ambassador]] to conduct for the [[Orquestra Simfonica de Barcelona]].<ref>p. 94-95 Baek Sukgi</ref>

In a social gathering, Ahn was introduced to Talabella Lolita,<ref name="can">{{cite web |url= http://songpr.com/flag3-%BE%C8%C0%CD%C5%C2.htm|title=  <U+C560><U+AD6D><U+AC00> <U+C791><U+ACE1><U+AC00>  <U+C548><U+C775><U+D0DC>|accessdate=2007-01-06 |format= |work= }}</ref> who had become a fervent fan of Ahn when she had seen a film on one of Ahn's performances.<ref>p. 96 Baek Sukgi</ref> Miss Lolita happened to be knowledgeable about the [[Japanese occupation]] of Korea, and Ahn felt understood. The two eventually became engaged, and, on July 5th, 1946, Miss Lolita and Ahn were married,<ref>p. 97 Baek Sukgi</ref> The two went to the island of [[Majorca]],<ref name="DAUM"/> where Ahn founded the [[The Palma de Mallorca Symphony Orchestra]].<ref>p. 94-95 Baek Sukgi</ref><ref name="KBS">{{cite web |url= http://english.kbs.co.kr/news/zoom/1427540_11781.html|title= The Centennial Celebration of National Anthem Composer<U+2019>s Birth|accessdate=2007-01-06 |format= |work= }}</ref> In the same year, he sought to work in the United States, but his past association with Strauss, who was known to be a Nazi party supporter, obstructed his goal for two years; in the end, however, he was admitted to the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]].<ref name="DAUM"/>

==Return to Korea==
On [[August 15]], [[1948]], Ahn's ''Aegukga'' was sung in the ceremony commemorating the establishment of the Korean government. After the [[Korean War]], President [[Syngman Rhee]] invited Ahn as a guest to be part of his 80th birthday celebration,<ref name="DAUM"/> and, on [[February 19]], [[1955]], Ahn returned to his motherland after 25 years away from home.<ref>p. 99 Baek Sukgi</ref> The military band sang the ''Aegukga'' upon Ahn's arrival. Soon after, Ahn was awarded the Cultural Medal of Merit.

Under an invitation from the [[Tokyo Geijutsu Daigaku]], Ahn arrived at the [[Haneda Airport]] in January of 1960,<ref>p. 103 Baek Sukgi</ref> and conducted a concert at the [[Yaon Hibiya Auditorium]] on the night of [[February 4]]. After the success in Tokyo, Ahn flew to [[Osaka]] where he held another concert.<ref>p. 106 Baek Sukgi</ref> After the concert, Ahn urged the Korean population in the area, who had been divided politically between the North and South, for further unity and cooperation.<ref name="one hundred seven">p. 107 Baek Sukgi</ref> Later in 1964, Ahn conducted a concert during the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], as requested by the [[NHK]].<ref>p. 107-108 Baek Sukgi</ref>

After a successful concert in Spain, Ahn organized three successive international music festivals in Seoul,<ref>p. 110 Baek Sukgi</ref> but could not continue the event any further because it disrupted Ahn's work for the [[Seoul Philharmonic]].<ref name="DAUM"/><ref name="EBAY">{{cite web |url= http://listing-index.ebay.com/musicians/Ahn_Eak-tai.html|title= Musicians - Ahn Eak-tai|accessdate=2007-01-06 |format= |work= Listing Index}}</ref> On [[September 16]], [[1965]], Ahn was stricken by a sudden illness and died while staying on the island of Majorca.<ref>p. 111 Baek Sukgi</ref> On [[July 8]], [[1977]], Ahn's ashes were transferred from Majorca to the Korean National Cemetery.<ref name="KBS"/>
