'''America's Space Prize''' was a US$50 million [[space competition]] in [[orbital spaceflight]] established and funded in 2004 by hotel entrepreneur [[Robert Bigelow]]. The prize would have been awarded to the first US-based privately funded team to design and build a reusable manned capsule capable of flying 5 astronauts to a [[Bigelow Aerospace]] inflatable space module.  The prize expired January 10, 2010, without a winner or any test flights attempted.  There must be two flights within 60 days. The teams were required to have been based in the [[United States]].

==Prize rules==

==Contestants==
Since the launch of the prize, 40 companies had expressed interest, but either didn't have the money which would apparently be needed, or, in the case of SpaceX, were ineligible due to having accepted government funding.  Despite the lack of interest, Bigelow did not revise the prize rules, planning instead to seek transportation to space other ways.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Space Review|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/667/2|title=Bigelow Aerospace<U+2019>s big day at the rodeo, part 2|author=Jeff Foust|date=July 24, 2006}}</ref>
