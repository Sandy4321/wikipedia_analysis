{{otheruses4|the bird|the short story|The Resplendent Quetzal}}

The '''Resplendent Quetzal''', ''Pharomachrus mocinno'', is a spectacular bird of the [[trogon]] family.  It is found from southern [[Mexico]] to western [[Panama]] (unlike the other [[quetzal]]s, which are found in [[South America]] and eastern [[Panama]]).  There are two subspecies, ''P. m. mocinno'' and ''P. m. costaricensis'', the [[Costa Rica]]n Resplendent Quetzal.  This quetzal plays an important role in [[Mesoamerica]]n myth.

==Description==
This species is 36 cm (14 in) long, plus up to 64 cm (25 in) of tail streamer for the male, and weighs about 210 g (7 oz). This is the largest representative of the trogon order.<ref>Paul A. Johnsgard, ''Trogons And Quetzals Of The World'', 2001, Smithsonian, ISBN 978-1560983880</ref> 

Resplendent Quetzals have a green body (showing iridescence from green-gold to blue-violet) and red breast. Their green upper [[Wing covert|tail coverts]] hide their tails and in breeding males are particularly splendid, being longer than the rest of the body. The primary wing coverts are also unusually long and give a fringed appearance. The male has a helmet-like crest.  The mature male's beak is yellow and the female's is black.

The skin of the quetzal is very thin and easily torn, so it has evolved thick plumage to protect its skin.{{fact|date=May 2008}} Like other members of the trogon family, it has large eyes that adapt easily to the dim light of its forest home.{{fact|date=May 2008}}

The "song" is a treble syllable described as ''kyow'' or like "a whimpering pup", often in pairs, which may be repeated monotonously.  Resplendent Quetzals have other unmusical calls as well.

==Behavior==
Resplendent Quetzals are considered specialized [[frugivore|fruit-eater]]s, although they mix their diet with [[insect]]s (notably [[wasp]]s, [[ant]]s, and [[larvae]]) and [[frog]]s. Particularly important are wild [[avocado]]s and other fruit of the [[Lauraceae|laurel family]], which the birds swallow whole before regurgitating the pits, which helps to disperse these trees.

Their habitat is montane cloud forests of Central America (from Southern Mexico to Panama). Resplendent Quetzals usually live alone when not breeding.  When breeding, females lay two pale blue eggs in a nest placed in a hole which they carve in a rotten tree. A tree in the required stage of [[decomposition]] is susceptible to weather damage, and the availability of suitable trees may limit the Resplendent Quetzal population.

Both parents take turns at incubating, with their long tail-covert feathers folded forwards over the back and out of the hole, where they tend to look like a bunch of [[fern]] growing out of the hole.  The incubation period lasts about 18 days, during which the male generally incubates the eggs during the day while the female incubates them at night. When the eggs hatch, both parents take care of the young, feeding them fruit, [[berries]], insects, [[lizard]]s, and small [[frog]]s.  However, the female often neglects and even abandons the young near the end of the rearing period, leaving it up to the male to continue caring for the offspring until they are ready to survive on their own. 

Resplendent Quetzals are weak fliers. Their common [[predator]]s include the [[Ornate Hawk Eagle]] and [[owls]] as adults, [[emerald toucanet]], [[squirrel]]s, and the [[Kinkajou]] as nestlings (Pribor 1999).

==Myth and legend==
The Resplendent Quetzal was considered divine, associated with the "snake god", [[Quetzalcoatl]] by [[Pre-Columbian]] Central American civilizations.  Their [[iridescent]] green tail feathers, symbols for spring plant growth, were venerated by the ancient [[Mayas]] and [[Aztecs]], who viewed the quetzal as the "god of the air" and as a symbol of goodness and light.  [[Mesoamerica]]n rulers and some nobility of other ranks wore headdresses made from quetzal feathers, symbolically connecting them to Quetzalcoatl. Since it was a crime to kill a quetzal, the bird was simply captured, its long tail feathers plucked, and was set free. Quetzalcoatl was the creator god and god of wind, often depicted with grey hair. In several [[Mesoamerican languages]], the term for ''quetzal'' can also mean ''precious'', ''sacred'', or ''erected''.

Until recently, it was thought that the Resplendent Quetzal could not be bred or held for any long time in captivity, and indeed it was noted for usually killing itself soon after being captured or caged. For this reason it is a traditional symbol of [[Freedom (political)|liberty]]. However, a zoo in [[Mexico]] has kept this species since 1992, and in [[2004]] [[Reproduction|breeding]] in captivity was announced (Orellana, 2004).

[[Image:1989 halfQuetzal.jpg|thumb|220 px|right|Guatemalan <U+00BD> Quetzal]]
The Resplendent Quetzal is [[Guatemala]]'s national bird, and an image of it is on the [[Flag of Guatemala|flag]] and the [[coat of arms of Guatemala]]. It is also the name of the [[Guatemalan quetzal|local currency]] (abbreviation GTQ). 

The bird is of great relevance to Guatemalan culture, being a character in the widely popular legend of the local hero [[Tec<U+00FA>n Um<U+00E1>n]], a prince and warrior of the [[Quich<U+00E9> people|Quich<U+00E9> Maya]] during the latter stages of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucat<U+00E1>n|Spanish conquest of the region]]. This quetzal was his ''[[nahual]]'' (spirit guide).

The Quich<U+00E9> repelled several attacks from the [[Spain|Spanish]] army, even though outmatched in [[weapon|weaponry]] (guns, armor and [[cavalry]] against [[spear]]s and [[arrow]]s).

Legend has it that on the day the [[conquistador]] [[Pedro de Alvarado]] fought against Tec<U+00FA>n Um<U+00E1>n, there was a quetzal flying overhead. On the first strike Tec<U+00FA>n Um<U+00E1>n, on foot, managed to disable Pedro de Alvarado's horse. Alvarado was then given another horse and on the second strike ran through Tec<U+00FA>n Um<U+00E1>n's chest with a spear. 

The quetzal flew down and landed on Tec<U+00FA>n Um<U+00E1>n, dipping its chest in the warrior prince's blood. It is there that the bird acquired its distinctive red chest feathers. <sup>[http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Pharomachrus_mocinno.html]</sup>

It is debatable whether these events happened, but the Maya fought fiercely for their land and freedom during the conquest. 

One [[Guatemala]]n legend claims that the quetzal used to sing beautifully before the Spanish conquest, but has been silent ever since <U+2014> but will sing once again when the land is truly free.

Stuffed specimens are displayed in the homes of the [[Guatemalan]] wealthy and museums, contributing to the birds' rarity.

==Etymology==
The epithet ''mocinno'' is [[Pablo de la Llave|Llave]]'s Latinization of the name of the biologist [[Jos<U+00E9> Mariano Moci<U+00F1>o|J. M. Moci<U+00F1>o]], a mentor of his.  (It is sometimes spelled ''mocino'', but  "<U+00F1>" was formerly spelled "nn" in Spanish, so the spelling with "nn" is justified and in any case now official.<sup>[http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v076n01/p0108-p0108.html], [http://www.zoonomen.net/avtax/frame.html]</sup>)

The word "quetzal" came from [[Nahuatl]], where ''quetzalli'' (from the [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''quetz'' = "stand") meant "tall upstanding plume" and then  "quetzal tail feather"; from that Nahuatl ''quetzaltot<U+014D>tl'' means "quetzal-feather bird" and thus "quetzal".<ref>J.Richard Andrews, ''Introduction to Classical Nahuatl'', 2003 reprint, University of Oklahoma Press, ISBN 0-8061-3452-6</ref>
