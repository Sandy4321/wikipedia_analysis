The '''Siege of Castelnuovo''' was an engagement during the [[Ottoman<U+2013>Habsburg wars#War in the Mediterranean|Ottoman-Habsburg struggle for control of the Mediterranean]], which took place in July 1539 in the walled town of Castelnuovo, present day [[Herceg Novi]], [[Montenegro]]. Castelnuovo had been conquered by elements of various Spanish tercios the year before during the failed campaign of the [[Holy League (1538)|Holy League]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Eastern Mediterranean]] waters. The walled town was besieged by land and sea by a powerful Ottoman army under Admiral [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who offered an honorable surrender to the defenders. These terms were rejected by the Spanish commanding officer Francisco de Sarmiento and his captains even though they knew that the Holy League's fleet, defeated at the [[Battle of Preveza]], could not relieve them.<ref name="Fern<U+00E1>ndez"/> During the siege the Barbarossa's army suffered heavy losses due to the stubborn resistance of Sarmiento's men. However, Castelnuovo eventually fell into Ottoman hands and almost all the Spanish defenders, including Sarmiento, were killed. The loss of the town ended the Christian attempt to gain control of the Eastern Mediterranean. The courage displayed by the Old Tercio of Naples, however, was praised and admired throughout [[Europe]] and was the subject of numerous poems and songs.<ref name="La<U+00ED>nez"/><ref name="Arsenal33"/>

==Background==
[[File:Battle of Preveza (1538).jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]] defeats the Holy League of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] under the command of [[Andrea Doria]] at the Battle of Preveza (1538). Painting from 1866 by Ohannes Umed Behzad.]] 
In 1538 the main danger to the Christianity in Europe was the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. The armies of the Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] had been [[Siege of Vienna (1529)|stopped]] at [[Vienna]] in 1529, and by the year 1532 the Ottomans had been expelled from their territories in [[Hungary]].<ref name="Arsenal22">Arsenal/Prado, p. 22</ref> In the Mediterranean, a Christian offensive attempted to eliminate the danger of the great Turkish fleet in 1535, when a strong armada under Don [[<U+00C1>lvaro de Baz<U+00E1>n]] and [[Andrea Doria]] [[Raid on Tunis|captured]] the port of [[Tunis]], expelling Admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa from the waters of the Western Mediterranean.<ref name="Arsenal22"/> The Ottoman Admiral was then required to return to [[Istanbul]], where he was appointed commander of a great fleet to conduct a campaign against the [[Republic of Venice]]'s possessions in the [[Ionian Sea]]. Barbarossa captured the islands of [[Syros]], [[Aegina]], [[Ios (island)|Ios]], [[Paros]], [[Tinos]], [[Karpathos]], [[Kasos]], [[Naxos Island|Naxos]], and [[Corfu]].<ref name="Arsenal22"/> The Italian cities of [[Otranto]] and [[Ugento]] and the fortress of [[Castro, Apulia|Castro]], in the province of [[Lecce]], were also looted.<ref name="Arsenal22"/> 

[[File:Emperor charles v.png|thumb|200px|Portrait of [[Charles V]] with a Baton. Copy by [[Rubens]] of a portrait by [[Titian]].]]
The Republic of Venice, frightened by the loss of their possessions and the ruin of their trade, conducted a vigorous campaign for the creation of a "Holy League" to recover the lost territories and expel the Ottomans from the sea.<ref name="Arsenal22"/> In February 1538, Pope [[Paul III]] succeeded in creating a league which united the [[Papacy]] itself, the Republic of Venice, the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Empire of Charles V]], the [[Archduchy of Austria]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]].<ref name="Arsenal23">Arsenal/Prado, p. 23</ref> The Allied fleet for the campaign was supposed to consist of 200 [[galley]]s and another 100 auxiliary ships, and the army of about 50,000 infantry and 4,500 cavalry. But only 130 galleys and an army of around 15,000 infantry, mostly [[Spaniards]], were all that could be gathered.<ref name="Arsenal23"/><ref>Fern<U+00E1>ndez Duro, p. 234</ref> The command of the fleet was given nominally to the Genoese Andrea Doria, but [[Vicenzo Capello]] and [[Marco Grimaldi]], commanding officers of the [[Papal States|Papal]] and Venetian fleets respectively, had almost twice as many ships as Doria.<ref name="Arsenal23"/> The commander of the army was unquestionably [[Hernando Gonzaga]], [[Viceroy of Sicily]].<ref name="Arsenal23"/>

Differences among the commanders of the fleet diminished its effectiveness against an experienced opponent like Barbarossa. This was seen in the [[Battle of Preveza]], fought in the [[Gulf of Arta]]. But the Holy League fleet provided support to the land forces that landed on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast and captured the town of [[Herceg Novi|Castelnuovo]].<ref name="Arsenal24">Arsenal/Prado, p. 24</ref> This small town was a strategic fortress between the Venetian possessions of [[Cattaro]] and [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] in the area known as [[Venetian Albania]]. Venice therefore claimed ownership of the city, but Charles V refused to cede it. This was the beginning of the end of the Holy League.<ref name="Arsenal24">Arsenal/Prado, p. 24</ref><ref>Fern<U+00E1>ndez Duro, p. 269</ref>

[[File:Andrea Doria.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Portrait of Andrea Doria (Sebastiano del Piombo)|Portrait of Andrea Doria]], c. [[1520]], by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]].]]
The town of Castelnuovo was garrisoned with approximately 4,000 men.<ref name="Arsenal24"/> The main force was a [[Tercio]] of Spanish veteran soldiers numbering about 3,500 men under the experienced [[Maestro de Campo]] Francisco Sarmiento de Mendoza y Manuel. This Tercio, named Tercio of Castelnuovo, was formed by 15 flags (companies) belonging to other tercios, amongst them the Old Tercio of Lombardy, dissolved the year before after a mutiny for lack of pay.<ref>''6 flags of the Tercio of Florence, 3 of the Tercio of Lombardy, 2 of the Tercio of Naples, one of the Tercio of Nice and three new flags''. Fern<U+00E1>ndez <U+00C1>lvarez, ''Carlos V, el C<U+00E9>sar y el hombre'', p. 579</ref> The 15 captains in charge of this flags were Mach<U+00ED>n de Mungu<U+00ED>a, <U+00C1>lvaro de Mendoza, Pedro de Sotomayor, Juan Vizca<U+00ED>no, Luis Cer<U+00F3>n, Jaime de Masquef<U+00E1>, Luis de Haro, Sancho de Fr<U+00ED>as, Olivera, Silva, Cambrana, Alcocer, Cus<U+00E1>n, Borgo<U+00F1><U+00F3>n and L<U+00E1>zaro de Coron.<ref name="Sandoval375">De Sandoval, p. 375</ref> Among the garrison there were also 150 [[light cavalry]] soldiers, a small contingent of [[Greek people|Greek]] soldiers and Knights under <U+00C1>ndres Escr<U+00E1>pula, and some [[Artillery|artillery pieces]] managed by 15 gunners under captain Juan de Urr<U+00E9>s.<ref name="Sandoval375"/> The chaplain of Andrea Doria, named Jerem<U+00ED>as, also remained in Castelnuovo along with 40 clerics and traders and was appointed [[bishop]] of the town.<ref name="Sandoval375"/>

The reason for the garrison's large numbers was that Castelnuovo was projected to be the [[beachhead]] for a great offensive against the heart of the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name="Arsenal24"/><ref>Fern<U+00E1>ndez Duro, p. 228</ref> But the fate of the troops who were in the fortress depended entirely on the support of the fleet, and this had been defeated by Barbarossa at Preveza before the capture of Castelnuovo. Moreover, in a short time Venice withdrew from the Holy League after accepting a disadvantageous agreement with the Ottomans.<ref>Levin, p. 159</ref><ref name="Arsenal25">Arsenal/Prado, p. 25</ref> Without Venetian ships, the Allied fleet had no chance to defeat the Ottoman fleet commanded by Barbarossa, who was by this time supported by another experienced officer, [[Turgut Reis]].<ref name="Arsenal25"/>

==Siege==
===First maneuvers===
[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Barbaros Hayreddin Pasha, 16th century contemporary painting, [[Louvre Museum]], Paris.]]
Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] ordered Barbarossa to reorganize and rearm his fleet during the winter months to have it ready for the battle in the spring of 1539. 10,000 infantry soldiers and 4,000 [[Janissaries]] were embarked aboard the warships to reinforce the troops of the galleys.<ref name="Arsenal25"/> According to the orders received, Barbarossa's army, numbering about 200 ships with 20,000 fighting men aboard, would [[Naval blockade|blockade]] Castelnuevo by sea while the forces of the Ottoman governor of Bosnia, a [[Persia]]n named Ulamen, would besiege the fortress by land in command of 30,000 soldiers.<ref name="Arsenal25"/> Sarmiento, meanwhile, used the peaceful months prior to the siege to improve the defenses of the town repairing walls and bastions and building new fortifications. But he could not do much due to a lack of means, as there was no plan to fortify the town since it was supposed to function as a beachhead.<ref name="Arsenal25"/> Captain Alcocer was sent to [[Spain]] with instructions to call for help; Pedro de Sotomayor was sent to [[Sicily]] and Captain Zambrana to [[Brindisi]], all in vain.<ref name="Arsenal27">Arsenal/Prado, p. 27</ref> Andrea Doria, who was in [[Otranto]] with 47 Imperial and 4 Maltese galleys, received news of Castelnuovo's situation, but given the inferiority of his fleet he sent a message to Sarmiento recommending him to surrender.<ref>Fern<U+00E1>ndez Duro, p. 247</ref>

In June Barbarossa sent 30 galleys to block the entrance of the [[Gulf of Cattaro]].<ref name="Arsenal27"/> The vessels reached Castelnuovo on 12 June and disembarked a thousand soldiers with the aim of finding water and capturing Spanish soldiers or local civilians to gain information.<ref name="Arsenal27"/> Once the Spanish were warned of their enemy's presence, Sarmiento dispatched three companies under Captain Mach<U+00ED>n de Mungu<U+00ED>a and the cavalry under L<U+00E1>zaro de Cor<U+00F3>n to attack them before lunchtime.<ref name="Arsenal27"/> After a fierce fight the Ottoman landing party was forced to re-embark, although it returned in the afternoon. Then it was beaten by Francisco de Sarmiento in person, who was waiting for a new attempt together with Captains <U+00C1>lvaro de Mendoza, Olivera and Juan Vizca<U+00ED>no, and 600 soldiers. Three hundred Ottomans were killed during the battle, and another 30 captured.<ref name="Sandoval374">De Sandoval, p. 374</ref> The remainder escaped to their ships.<ref name="Sandoval374"/> 

[[File:EmperorSuleiman.jpg|thumb|180px|Portrait of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] attributed to Titian. c.1530.]]
On 18 July Barbarossa arrived with the main force and immediately began to land troops and artillery while waiting for the arrival of Ulamen, who came along with his army a few days later.<ref name="Arsenal26">Arsenal/Prado, p. 26</ref> The Ottoman [[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]]s spent five days digging [[trench]]es and building ramparts for 44 heavy siege guns carried aboard Barbarossa's fleet or by Ulamen's troops, and even smoothed the fields around Castelnuovo to facilitate maneuvers.<ref name="Arsenal26"/> Castelnuovo was also bombarded by sea, as ten pieces had been previously embarked aboard the galleys.<ref name="Arsenal26"/> The Spanish, meanwhile, undertook several sorties to obstruct the siege works. These raids inflicted many casualties, among them Agi, one of Barbarossa's favorite captains.<ref name="Arsenal26"/> Another sortie by a Spanish force of 800 men surprised several units of Janissaries who were attempting to storm the walls of Castlenuovo, killing most of them and leaving the field strewn with corpses. When Barbarossa was informed about the setback, he severely reprimanded his officers, as the losses of the Ottoman elite corps were difficult to replace. He gave orders forbidding skirmishes to avoid a repeat of the defeat.<ref name="Sandoval374"/>

===The great assault===
By 23 July, Barbarossa's army was ready to begin a general assault and his artillery prepared to break down the walls of Castelnuovo. Enjoying a vast numerical superiority over the Spanish garrison, which was completely isolated and unable to receive support or supplies, Barbarossa offered an honorable surrender to the Spanish.<ref name="Arsenal27"/> Sarmiento and his men would be granted a safe passage to [[Italy]], the soldiers retaining their weapons and flags. Barbarossa added to his offer the incentive of giving each soldier 20 ducats.<ref name="Arsenal27"/> His only demand to Sarmiento was the abandonment of his artillery and [[gunpowder]]. Two squad corporals of Captain Vizcaino's company, Juan Alcaraz and Francisco de Tapia, managed to return to [[Naples]] and write their view of events many years later.<ref name="Arsenal27"/> They recorded the answer given to Barbarossa that "''the Maestro de Campo consulted with all the captains, and the captains with his officers, and they decided that they preferred to die in service of God and His Majesty.''"<ref name="Arsenal27"/>

[[File:Cannon battery at the Siege of Esztergom 1543.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Ottoman siege guns at the [[Siege of Esztergom]], 1543. Painted by [[Sebastian Vrancks]], 17th century.]]
The great assault on the city was launched shortly after, and lasted all day.<ref name="Arsenal28">Arsenal/Prado, p. 28</ref> It was costly in lives, as the Ottomans employed both infantry and artillery at the same time to assault and bombard Castelnuovo, resulting in heavy casualties among the Ottomans themselves due to both [[friendly fire]] and Spanish defending.<ref name="Arsenal28"/> During the night the Spanish improved their defenses and plugged the gaps opened in the walls. When the attack was resumed the next morning, [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] Day, Bishop Jerem<U+00ED>as remained with the soldiers, encouraging them and confessing those who were mortally wounded along the attacked perimeter. About 6,000 Ottoman soldiers were killed in the bloody assault, while the Spanish suffered only 50 killed; although the number of men who died from their wounds was probably large.<ref name="Sandoval375">De Sandoval, p. 375</ref>

Encouraged by the successful defense, several Spanish soldiers decided to conduct a surprise [[Raid (military)|raid]] on the Ottoman camp with the approval of Sarmiento.<ref name="Arsenal29">Arsenal/Prado, p. 29</ref> Thus, one morning, 600 men took the unprepared besiegers by surprise. In some places the assault could not be stopped, and panic spread among the Ottomans. Many troops broke and ran, including some Janissaries who fled throughout their own camp breaking down the [[tent]]s, including that of Barbarossa.<ref name="Arsenal29"/> The Admiral's personal guard feared for the safety of its lord, and, ignoring his protests, took him to the galleys along with the standard of the Sultan.<ref name="Arsenal29"/>

[[File:Battle of Vienna.SultanMurads with janissaries.jpg|thumb|170px|Ottoman [[Janissary|janissaries]].]]
During the following days most of the artillery concentrated its fire on a fort in the upper town. Barbarossa thought that it was the key point of Castelnuovo's fortifications and proposed to capture it.<ref name="Arsenal29"/> The remaining cannons, meantime, continued firing at the fragile walls of the town. On 4 August, Barbarossa ordered an assault against the ruins of the fort, which was now completely shattered, with its casemates ruined. As a major point of the defense, Sarmiento had reinforced the garrison and removed the wounded in the preceding days. The assault began at dawn and the battle lasted all day. Captain Mach<U+00ED>n of Mungu<U+00ED>a distinguished himself in the fight, leading the defenders with great courage.<ref name="Arsenal29"/> By nightfall the remnants of the Spanish garrison retreated to the walls of the town with their wounded, leaving the ruined castle in Barbarossa's hands. The day was very costly in lives. Of the Spanish officers defending the castle only Captains Masquef<U+00E1>, Mungu<U+00ED>a, Haro and a corporal surnamed Galaz survived.<ref name="Arsenal29"/> The remainder had been killed in the battle. Among the very few survivors that the Ottomans captured, they found three deserters. These were immediately brought to Barbarossa and encouraged the Admiral to continue with the assaults, reporting that the Spanish had suffered heavy casualties, lacked gunpowder and shot, and were mostly injured and exhausted.<ref name="Arsenal29"/>

===Ottoman capture===
[[File:Pierre Mortier - Golfo di Cattaro.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Castelnuovo's view in the early 18th century, by [[Pierre Mortier]] (1661<U+2013>1711), circa 1700.]]
On 5 August a new attack was launched against the walls. Barbarossa, after the report of the Spanish deserters, was sure that he could soon capture Castelnuevo. All the Janissaries took part in the action, and the cavalry was ordered to dismount to join the general assault.<ref name="Arsenal30">Arsenal/Prado, p. 30</ref> Despite the overwhelming numerical superiority of the Ottoman troops, the Spanish defense was successful, as no more than a tower of the wall fell to the besiegers that day.<ref name="Arsenal30"/> Sarmiento ordered his sappers to prepare a [[Mining (military)|mine]] to destroy the tower, but the attempt failed when an unexpected burst of the gunpowder killed the soldiers who were working in the mine.<ref name="Arsenal30"/> At dawn on the following day a heavy [[Rain|downpour]] ruined the [[matchlock]]s of the [[harquebus]]es, the few remaining pieces of artillery, and the last gunpowder. The fight was therefore sustained only with [[sword]]s, [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]s and [[knife|knives]], and the wounded Spanish soldiers were forced to take up arms and help defend the walls.<ref name="Arsenal30"/> Only the dying men remained in the hospital. Surprisingly, the few surviving Spanish managed to repel the assault.<ref>Arsenal/Prado, p. 31</ref> 

The last and definitive attack took place the next morning. Francisco de Sarmiento, on horseback, was wounded in the face by three arrows, but he continued to encourage his men.<ref name="Arsenal32">Arsenal/Prado, p. 32</ref> Demolished by heavy gunfire, the ruins of the walls became indefensible. Sarmiento then ordered the 600 Spanish survivors to retreat. His idea consisted of defending a castle in the lower city where the civilian population of Castelnuovo had taken refuge.<ref name="Arsenal32"/> Although the withdrawal was made in perfect order and discipline, Sarmiento and his men found that the doors of the castle were walled at their arrival.<ref name="Arsenal32"/> Sarmiento was offered a rope to raise him to the walls,<ref name="Arsenal32"/> but refused and responded "''Never God wants that I was saved and my companions were lost without me''".<ref name="Sandoval377"/><ref name="Arsenal32"/> After that he joined Mach<U+00ED>n de Mungu<U+00ED>a, Juan Vizca<U+00ED>no and Sancho Frias to lead the [[last stand]]. Surrounded by the Ottoman army, the last Spanish soldiers fought back to back until none were able to fight. At the end of day, Castelnuovo was in Ottoman hands.<ref name="Arsenal34">Arsenal/Prado, p. 34</ref>

Almost all of the Janissaries and 16,000 of other Ottoman units were killed in the assault. According to rumor, Turkish losses amounted to 37,000 dead.<ref name="Arsenal33"/><ref name="Sandoval377"/> Of the Spanish troops only 200 survived, most of them wounded. One of the prisoners was the Biscayan Captain Mach<U+00ED>n de Mungu<U+00ED>a. Barbarossa, upon learning this, offered Mungu<U+00ED>a freedom and a place in his army. The admiral greatly admired him for his actions in the battle of Preveza, where the Spaniard had successfully defended a sinking Venetian [[carrack]] against several Ottoman warships.<ref>Fern<U+00E1>ndez Duro, p. 244</ref> Mungu<U+00ED>a refused to accept and was therefore beheaded on the spur of the admiral's galley.<ref name="Arsenal33"/> Half of the prisoners and all the clerics were also slaughtered to satisfy the Ottoman soldiers, who were angry at the great losses which they had suffered in capturing the city.<ref name="Arsenal33"/> The few survivors were taken as slaves to Istanbul. Twenty-five of them managed to escape from prison six years later and sailed to the port of [[Messina]].<ref name="Arsenal33"/>

Despite the failure of Sarmiento to retain the fortress, Castelnuovo's defense was sung by numerous contemporaneous poets and praised all over Christian Europe.<ref name="Arsenal33"/> The Spanish soldiers who participated in the unequal engagement were compared with [[Greek mythology|mythological]] and [[classical history]] heroes, being considered immortal due the magnitude of their feat.<ref name="Arsenal33"/> Only the enemies of Charles V, such as the [[Padua]]n humanist [[Sperone Speroni]], rejoiced at the annihilation of the Tercio of Castelnuovo.<ref>Croce, p. 317</ref>

The siege of Castelnuovo ended the failed campaign of the Holy League against the power of the Ottoman Empire in the Eastern Mediterranean. Charles V began negotiations with Barbarossa to attract him to the imperial ranks but got nothing and turned all its efforts in a great expedition against Algiers to destroy the Ottoman sea power.<ref>Mart<U+00ED>nez Ruiz/Gim<U+00E9>nez, pp. 145-146</ref> This expedition, known as the [[Journey of Algiers]], ended in a disaster as a storm scattered the fleet and the army had to be reembarked having suffered heavy losses.<ref>Mart<U+00ED>nez Ruiz/Gim<U+00E9>nez, p. 146</ref> A truce between Charles V and Suleiman the Magnificent was signed in 1543. Castelnuovo remained in Ottoman hands for almost 150 years. It was recovered in 1687, during the [[Morean War]], by the Venetian Captain-General at sea Girolamo Cornaro, who in allegiance with Montenegrans under Vuceta Bogdanovic, won a great victory over the Turks near the town and put the fortress under Venetian rule.<ref>Jaques, p. 210</ref>
