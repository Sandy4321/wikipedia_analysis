'''Warwick Castle''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>w<U+0252>r<U+026A>k|En-warwick.ogg}} {{respell|WORR|ik}}) is a medieval [[castle]] in [[Warwick]], the [[county town]] of [[Warwickshire]], England. It sits on a cliff overlooking a bend in the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]]. Warwick Castle was built by [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] in 1068 within or adjacent to [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[burh]] of [[Warwick]]. It was used as a fortification until the early 17th century, when [[Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke|Sir Fulke Greville]] converted it to a [[country house]]. It was owned by the Greville family, who became earls of Warwick in 1759, until 1978

From 1088, the castle traditionally belonged to the [[Earl of Warwick]], and it served as a symbol of his power. The castle was taken in 1153 by [[Henry II of England|Henry of Anjou]], later Henry II. It has been used to hold prisoners, including some from the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]] in the 14th century. Under the ownership of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard Neville]]&nbsp;&ndash; also known as "Warwick the Kingmaker"&nbsp;&ndash; Warwick Castle was used in the 15th century to imprison the English king, [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. Warwick Castle has been compared with [[Windsor Castle]] in terms of scale, cost, and status.<ref name="Brown121">Brown (2004), p.&nbsp;121.</ref>

Since its construction in the 11th century, the castle has undergone structural changes with additions of towers and redesigned residential buildings. Originally a wooden [[motte-and-bailey]], it was rebuilt in stone in the 12th century. During the [[Hundred Years War]], the facade opposite the town was refortified, resulting in one of the most recognisable examples of 14th century military architecture. 

In the 17th century the grounds were turned into a garden. Warwick Castle was purchased by [[The Tussauds Group]] in 1978 and opened as a tourist attraction. It is protected as a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]]<ref name="pastscape">{{cite web |title=Warwick Castle |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=333577 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk}} Retrieved on 19&nbsp;June 2008.</ref> and a Grade I [[listed building]].<ref name="IoE">{{cite web |title=Warwick Castle |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=307361 |publisher=Images of England}} Retrieved on 19&nbsp;June 2008.</ref>

Warwick Castle is situated on a [[sandstone]] [[bluff]] at a bend of the River Avon. The river, which runs below the castle on the east side, has eroded the rock the castle stands on, forming a cliff.  The river and cliff form natural defences. The castle is in the town of Warwick; when construction began in 1068 four houses belonging to the [[History of Coventry#Early history|Abbot of Coventry]] were demolished to provide room. The castle's position made it strategically important in safeguarding the Midlands against rebellion.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick">'The borough of Warwick: The castle and castle estate in Warwick', ''A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 8: The City of Coventry and Borough of Warwick'' (1969), pp.&nbsp;452<U+2013>475.

==History==
===Before the castle===
An Anglo-Saxon [[burh]] was established on the site of the future Warwick Castle in 914;<ref name="The medieval town">'The borough of Warwick: Introduction: the medieval town', ''A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 8: The City of Coventry and Borough of Warwick'' (1969), pp.&nbsp;418<U+2013>427.

Retrieved on 14&nbsp;July 2008.</ref> legend has it that the construction of the fortifications was instigated by [[Ethelfleda]], daughter of [[Alfred the Great]].<ref name="Times article">{{cite news |author=J. Harvey Bloom |title=Warwick Castle |pages=10 |work=[[The Times]] |date=18&nbsp;January 1929}}</ref> The burh she established was one of ten which defended [[Mercia]] against the marauding [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]. Its position allowed it to dominate the [[Fosse Way]], as well as the river valley and the crossing over the River Avon. Although the motte in the south west of Warwick Castle is called "Ethelfleda's Mound" it is in fact part of the later Norman fortifications, rather than an Anglo-Saxon relic.<ref name="The medieval town"/>

===Military institution and power symbol===
[[Image:The Mound 2007.jpg|thumb|right|The motte of the Norman [[motte-and-bailey]] castle is called Ethelfleda's Mound.]]
After the [[Norman conquest of England]], William the Conqueror established a [[motte-and-bailey]] castle at Warwick in 1068 to maintain control of the Midlands as he advanced northwards.<ref name="pastscape"/><ref>Brown (2004), p.&nbsp;32.</ref> A motte-and-bailey castle consists of a mound&nbsp;&ndash; on which usually stands a [[keep]] or tower&nbsp;&ndash; and a bailey, which is an enclosed courtyard. William appointed [[Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick|Henry de Beaumont]], the son of a powerful Norman family, as [[constable]] of the castle.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> In 1088, Henry de Beaumont was made the first [[Earl of Warwick]].<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> He founded the Church of All Saints within the castle walls by 1119; the [[Bishop of Worcester]], believing that a castle was an inappropriate location for a church, removed it in 1127&ndash;28.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> In 1153, the wife of Roger de Beaumont, 2nd&nbsp;Earl of Warwick, was tricked into believing that her husband was dead, and surrendered control of the castle to the invading army of Henry of Anjou, later King Henry II.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/><ref>Liddiard (2005), p.&nbsp;74.</ref> According to the ''[[Deeds of King Stephen|Gesta Regis Stephani]]'', a 12th-century historical text, Roger de Beaumont died on hearing the news that his wife had handed over the castle.<ref>Potter (1955), p.&nbsp;235.</ref> Henry later returned the castle to the Earls of Warwick as they had been supporters of his mother, [[Empress Matilda]], in [[The Anarchy]] of 1135&ndash;54.<ref>Davis (1903), p.&nbsp;639.</ref>

During the reign of King Henry II (1154&ndash;89), the motte-and-bailey was replaced with a stone castle. This new [[archaeological phase|phase]] took the form of a shell keep with all the buildings constructed against the [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]].<ref name="Times article"/> During the [[Revolt of 1173<U+2013>1174|barons' rebellion of 1173&ndash;74]], the Earl of Warwick remained loyal to King Henry II, and the castle was used to store provisions.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> The castle and the lands associated with the earldom passed down in the Beaumont family until 1242. When [[Thomas de Beaumont, 6th Earl of Warwick]], died the castle and lands passed to his sister, [[Margaret de Newburg, Countess of Warwick|Lady Margery, countess of Warwick in her own right]]. Her husband died soon after, and while she looked for a suitable husband, the castle was in the ownership of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]]. When she married John du Plessis in December 1242, the castle was returned to her.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> During the Second Barons' War of 1264&ndash;67, [[William Maudit, 8th Earl of Warwick]], was an inactive supporter of King Henry III.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> The castle was taken in a surprise attack by the forces of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]], from Kenilworth Castle in 1264.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> The walls along the northeastern side of the castle were slighted so that it would be useless to the king.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> Maudit and his countess were taken to Kenilworth Castle and held until a ransom was paid. After the death of William Mauduit in 1267, the title and castle passed to his nephew [[William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick|William de Beauchamp, 9th&nbsp;Earl of Warwick]]. Following William's death, Warwick Castle passed through seven generations of the [[Beauchamp]] family, who over the next 180&nbsp;years were responsible for most of the additions made to the castle. In 1312, [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall]], was captured by [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick]], and imprisoned in Warwick Castle until his execution on 9 June 1312.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/><ref>Keightley (1839), pp.&nbsp;257<U+2013>258.</ref> A group of [[magnate]]s lead by the Earl of Warwick and [[Thomas Plantagenet, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], accused Gaveston of stealing the royal treasure.<ref>Hamilton (1991), p.&nbsp;201.</ref>

[[Image:Caesar's Tower 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Caesar's Tower was built between 1330 and 1360.]]
Under [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl]],<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/><ref name="Liddiard59"/> the castle defences were significantly enhanced in 1330&ndash;60 on the north eastern side by the addition of a [[gatehouse]], a [[barbican]] (a form of fortified gateway), and a tower on either side of the reconstructed wall, named Caesar's Tower and Guy's Tower.<ref name="Liddiard59">Liddiard (2005), p.&nbsp;59.</ref><ref name="Brown104">Brown (2004), p.&nbsp;104.</ref> The Watergate Tower also dates from this period.<ref>Brown (2004), p.&nbsp;103.</ref>

Caesar's and Guy's Towers are residential and may have been inspired by french models (for example [[Bricquebec]]). Both towers are [[machicolation|machicolated]] and Caesar's Tower features a unique double parapet. The two towers are also vaulted in stone on every storey. Caesar's Tower contained a "grim" basement [[dungeon]];<ref name="Friar">Friar (2003), p.&nbsp;25.</ref> according to local legend dating back to at least 1644 it is also known as Poitiers Tower either because prisoners from the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 may have been imprisoned there or because the ransoms raised from the battle helped to pay for its construction.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> The gatehouse features [[murder holes]], two [[drawbridge]]s, a gate, and [[portcullis]]es&nbsp;&ndash; gates made from wood or metal.<ref>Friar (2003), p.&nbsp;128.</ref> The towers of the gatehouse were machicolated.<ref>Friar (2003), p.&nbsp;184.</ref>

The fa<U+00E7>ade overlooking the river was designed as a symbol of the power and wealth of the Beauchamp earls and would have been "of minimal defensive value"; this followed a trend of 14th-century castles being more statements of power than designed exclusively for military use.<ref>Friar (2003), pp.&nbsp;57,&nbsp;70.</ref>

The line of Beauchamp earls ended in 1449 when [[Anne de Beauchamp, 15th Countess of Warwick]], died.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> Richard Neville became the next Earl of Warwick through his wife's inheritance of the title. During the summer of 1469, Neville rebelled against King Edward IV and imprisoned him in Warwick Castle. Neville attempted to rule in the king's name;<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> however, constant protests by the king's supporters forced the Earl to release the king. Neville was subsequently killed in the [[Battle of Barnet]], fighting against King Edward IV in 1471 during the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Warwick Castle then passed from Neville to his son-in-law, [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George Plantagenet]]. George Plantagenet was executed in 1478 and his lands passed onto [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Edward Plantagenet, 17th&nbsp;Earl of Warwick]]; however, Edward Plantagenet was only two when his father died so his lands were taken in the custody of [[The Crown]]. He had a claim to the throne and was imprisoned first by [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], then [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], and finally by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. He was held in the [[Tower of London]] until he was executed for [[high treason]] by Henry VII in 1499;<ref>Fuller and Nuttall (1840), pp.&nbsp;273<U+2013>74.</ref> Edward was the last Earl of Warwick of the title's first creation.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/>

In the early 1480s [[Richard III of England|King Richard III]] instigated the building of two gun towers, Bear and Clarence Towers, which were left unfinished on his death in 1485; with their own well and ovens, the towers were an independent stronghold from the rest of the castle, possibly in case of mutiny by the [[garrison]]. With the advent of gunpowder the position of Keeper of the Artillery was created in 1486.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/>

[[Image:Warwick castle torture.JPG|thumb|upright|right|A [[gibbet]] on display in the dungeon in the basement of Caesar's Tower.]]
When [[antiquary]] [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] visited the castle some time between 1535 and 1543, he noted that:

{{quote|... the dungeon now in ruin standeth in the west-north-west part of the castle. There is also a tower west-north-west, and through it a postern-gate of iron. All the principal lodgings of the castle with the hall and chapel lie on the south side of the castle, and here the king doth much cost in making foundations in the rocks to sustain that side of the castle, for great pieces fell out of the rocks that sustain it.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/>}}

While in the care of The Crown, Warwick Castle underwent repairs and renovations using about 500&nbsp;loads of stone. The castle, as well as lands associated with the earldom, was in Crown care from 1478 until 1547, when they were granted to [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|John Dudley]] with the second creation of the title the Earl of Warwick.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> When making his appeal for ownership of the castle Dudley said of the castle's condition: "... the castle of its self is not able to lodge a good baron with his train, for all the one side of the said castle with also the dungeon tower is clearly ruinated and down to the ground".<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/>

Warwick Castle had fallen into decay due to its age and neglect, and despite his remarks Dudley did not initiate any repairs to the castle.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] visited the castle in 1566 during a [[Royal Entry|tour of the country]], and again 1572 for four nights. A timber building was erected in the castle for her to stay in, and [[Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick|Ambrose Dudley, 3rd&nbsp;Earl of Warwick]], left the castle to the Queen during her visits.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> When Ambrose Dudley died in 1590 the title of Earl of Warwick became extinct for the second time. A survey from 1590 recorded that the castle was still in a state of disrepair, noting that lead had been stolen from the roofs of some of the castle's buildings including the chapel.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> In 1601 Sir Fulke Greville remarked that "the little stone building there was, mightily in decay&nbsp;... so as in very short time there will be nothing left but a name of Warwick".<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/>

===Country house===
In 1604, the ruinous castle was given to Sir Fulke Greville by [[James I of England|King James I]] and was converted into a country house.<ref name="pastscape"/> Whilst the castle was undergoing repairs, it was peripherally involved in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605. The conspirators involved awaited news of their plot in [[Dunchurch]] in [[Warwickshire]]. When they discovered the plot had failed they stole cavalry horses from the stables at Warwick Castle to help in their escape.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> The conversion of the castle coincided with a period of decline in the use of castles during the 15th and 16th centuries; many were either being abandoned or converted into comfortable residences for the gentry.<ref>Friar (2003), pp.&nbsp;90<U+2013>1.</ref> In the early 17th century, [[Robert Smythson]] was commissioned to draw a plan of the castle before any changes were made.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> When the title of Earl of Warwick was created for the third time in 1618, the Greville family were still in possession of Warwick Castle.

Under [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke]], Warwick Castle's defences were enhanced in January to May 1642 in preparation for attack during the [[First English Civil War]]. The garden walls were raised, [[Glossary of architecture#B|bulwark]]s&nbsp;&ndash; barricades of beams and soil to mount artillery&nbsp;&ndash; were constructed and gunpowder and wheels for two [[cannon]]s were obtained.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> Robert Greville was a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] supporter, and on 7 August 1642 a [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] army laid [[siege]] to the castle. He was not in the castle at the time and the garrison was under the command of [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton]], who was [[Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire]]. Parliamentarian General [[William Dugdale]] called for Lord Northampton to surrender the castle, but  he was refused. The besieging army opened fire on the castle, to little effect.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> According to [[Richard Bulstrode]]:

{{quote|... our endeavours for taking it were to little purpose, for we had only two small pieces of cannon which were brought from [[Compton Verney House|Compton House]], belonging to the Earl of Northampton, and those were drawn up to the top of the church steeple, and were discharged at the castle, to which they could do no hurt, but only frightened them within the castle, who shot into the street, and killed several of our men.<ref>Greville (1903), pp.&nbsp;692<U+2013>4.</ref>}}

The siege was lifted on 23 August 1642 when the garrison was relieved by the forces of [[Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham]], and the Parliamentarians were forced to retreat to [[Worcester]].<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> After the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in 1642&nbsp;&ndash; the first pitched battle of the English Civil War&nbsp;&ndash; prisoners were held in Caesar's and Guy's Towers.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> During the [[Second English Civil War]] prisoners were again held at the castle, including those from the [[Battle of Worcester]] in 1651. A garrison was maintained in the castle complete with artillery and supplies from 1643 to 1660, at its strongest it numbered 302 soldiers. In 1660 the [[English Council of State]] ordered the castle governor to disband the garrison and hand over the castle to [[Francis Greville, 3rd Baron Brooke]].<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> The state apartments were found to be outmoded and in poor repair. Under Roger and William Hurlbutt, master carpenters of Warwick, extensive modernization of the interiors was undertaken, 1669-78. To ensure that they would be in the latest taste, William was sent down to Dorset to make careful notes of the interiors recently finished at [[Kingston Lacy]] for Sir Ralph Bankes to designs by  [[Roger Pratt (architect)|Sir Roger Pratt]].<ref>[[Howard Colvin]], ''A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600-1840'', 3rd ed. (Yale University Press), ''s.v.''

[[Image:Warwick Castle, the east front by Canaletto, 1752.JPG|thumb|left|The east front of Warwick Castle from the outer court, painted by Canaletto in 1752.<ref>Buttery (1987), p.&nbsp;444.</ref>]]
[[Francis Greville, 8th Baron Brooke]], undertook a renewed programme of improvements to Warwick Castle and its grounds. The 8th Baron Brooke was also bestowed with the title Earl of Warwick in 1759, the fourth creation of the title. With the recreation of the title, the castle was back in the ownership of the earls of Warwick. [[Daniel Garrett]]'s work at Warwick is documented in 1748; [[Howard Colvin]] attributed to him the [[Gothic Revival|Gothick]] interior of the Chapel.<ref>Colvin, ''s.v.'' "Garrett, Daniel".</ref> [[Lancelot Brown|Lancelot "Capability" Brown]] had been on hand since 1749.<ref>Jacques (2001), pp.&nbsp;48,&nbsp;53.</ref> Brown, who was still head gardener at Stowe at the time and had yet to make his reputation as the main exponent of the [[English landscape garden]], was called in by Lord Brooke to give Warwick Castle a more "natural" connection to its river. Brown simplified the long narrow stretch by sweeping it into a lawn that dropped right to the riverbank, stopped at each end by bold clumps of native trees. A serpentine drive gave an impression of greater distance between the front gates and the castle entrance.<ref>Edward Hyams, ''Capability Brown and Humphry Repton'', 1971:21.</ref> 

[[Horace Walpole]] saw Brown's maturing scheme in 1751 and remarked in a letter: "The castle is enchanting. The view pleased me more than I can express; the river Avon tumbled down a cascade at the foot of it. It is well laid out by one Brown who has set up on a few ideas of [[William Kent|Kent]] and [[Philip Southcote|Mr Southcote]]."<ref>Horace Walpole to George Montague, 22 July 1751,  noted in Jacques 2001:55</ref>

In 1754 the poet [[Thomas Gray]], a member of Walpole's Gothicising circle, commented disdainfully on the activity at the castle:

{{quote|... he [Francis Greville] has sash'd<ref>[[Sash window]]s had replaced casements in the seventeenth century; they were not considered appropriate for "Gothick" building.</ref> the great apartment&nbsp;... and being since told, that square sash windows were not Gothic, he has put certain whimwams withinside the glass, which appearing through are to look like fretwork. Then he has scooped out a little burrough in the massy walls of the place for his little self<ref>Lord Brooke, who was notably short in stature, was called "little Brooke" by [[Horace Walpole]], in his letter describing Warwick Castle in 1751 (Jacques 2001:55).</ref> and his children, which is hung with paper and printed linnen, and carved chimney-pieces, in the exact manner of [[Berkeley Square|Berkley-square]] or Argyle Buildings.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/>}}

Gray's mention of Argyle Buildings, Westminster, London,<ref>Argyle Buildings, Bath (now Argyle Street), were not constructed until ca. 1789 (Colvin, ''s.v.'' "Baldwin, Thomas").</ref> elicited a connotation of an inappropriately modern Georgian urban development, for the buildings in Argyll Street were a speculation to designs of [[James Gibbs]], 1736-40.<ref>Colvin, ''s.v.'' "Gibbs, James"; Terry Friedman, ''James Gibbs'' (1984:304); 'Argyll Street Area', ''Survey of London'': volumes 31 and 32: St James Westminster, Part 2 (1963), pp. 284-307. ([http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41478 on-line text]). Date accessed: 10 September 2008: "The Argyll estate appears never to have been a fashionable place of residence."</ref> 

Greville commissioned Italian painter Antonio Canaletto to paint Warwick Castle in 1747,<ref>Buttery (1987), p.&nbsp;439.</ref> while the castle grounds and gardens were undergoing landscaping by Brown. Five paintings and three drawings of the castle by Canaletto are known, making it the artist's most often represented building in Britain.<ref>Buttery (1987), p.&nbsp;437.</ref> Canaletto's work on Warwick Castle has been described as "unique in the history of art as a series of views of an English house by a major continental master".<ref>Buttery (1987), p.&nbsp;445.</ref> As well as the gardens, Greville commissioned Brown to rebuild the exterior entrance porch and stairway to the Great Hall.<ref name="IoE"/> Brown also contributed Gothick designs for a wooden bridge over the Avon (1758).<ref>Colvin, ''s.v.'' "Brown, Lancelot".</ref> He was still at work on Warwick Castle in 1760. [[Timothy Lightoler]] was responsible for the porch being extended and extra rooms added adjacent to it in 1763&ndash;69.<ref name="IoE"/> and during the same years William Lindley provided a new Dining Room and other interior alterations.<ref>Colvin, ''s.v.''

==Layout==
[[Image:Warwick Castle Plan.svg|thumb|right|Plan of Warwick Castle]]
The current castle, built in stone during the reign of King Henry II, is on the same site as the earlier Norman motte-and-bailey castle. A [[keep]] used to stand on the motte which is on the south west of the site, although most of the structure now dates from the post-medieval period.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> In the 17th century the motte was landscaped with the addition of a path.<ref name="Jacques51">Jacques (2001), p.&nbsp;51.</ref> The [[bailey]] was incorporated into the new castle and is surrounded by stone curtain walls.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/>

When Warwick Castle was rebuilt in the reign of King Henry II it had a new layout with the buildings against the curtain walls. The castle is surrounded by a dry moat on the northern side where there is no protection from the river or the old motte; the perimeter of the walls is {{convert|130|m|yd}} long by {{convert|82|m|yd}} wide.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> The two entrances to castle are in the north and west walls. There was originally a [[drawbridge]] over the moat in the north east. In the centre of the north west wall is a gateway with Clarence and Bears towers on either side; this is a 15th century addition to the fortifications of the castle.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> The residential buildings line the eastern side of the castle, facing the River Avon. These buildings include the great hall, the library, bedrooms, and the chapel.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/>

==Grounds and park==
[[Image:Warwick castle garden.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the rose garden of Warwick Castle]]
Formal gardens belonging to Warwick Castle were first recorded in 1534.<ref name="pastscape gardens">{{cite web |title=Castle Park |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1150800 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk}} Retrieved on 19&nbsp;June 2008.</ref> Landscaping in the 17th century added spiral paths to the castle motte during Fulke Greville's programme of restoration.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/><ref name="Jacques51"/> Francis Greville commissioned Lancelot Brown to relandscape the castle grounds; he began working on the grounds and park in 1749 and had completed his work by 1757, having spent about <U+00A3>2,293 (<U+00A3>{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|2293|1757|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}} on the project.<ref>Jacques (2001), p.&nbsp;48.</ref> The gardens cover {{convert|2.8|km2|acre}}.<ref name="pastscape gardens"/> [[Robert Marnock]] created formal gardens in the castle's grounds in 1868&ndash;69.<ref name="pastscape gardens"/>

Started in 1743 and originally known as Temple Park, Castle Park is located to the south of the castle. Its original name derived from the [[Knights Templar]], who used to own a [[manorialism|manor]] in Warwick. Houses around the perimeter of the park were demolished and the land they stood on incorporated into the park.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> Attempts to make profits from the park in the late 18th century included leasing it for grazing, growing wheat, and keeping sheep.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/>

A water-powered mill in the castle grounds was probably built under Henry de Beaumont, 1st&nbsp;Earl of Warwick.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, on the west bank of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine house had been added to the mill.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/> The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had stopped being used to grind, but once Warwick Castle was fitted with [[mains electricity]] in 1940, the mill was no longer required and was dismantled in 1954.<ref name="The castle and castle estate in Warwick"/>
