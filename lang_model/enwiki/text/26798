'''One Wall Centre''', also known as the Sheraton Wall Centre - north tower, is currently the tallest building in [[Downtown (Vancouver)|downtown Vancouver]], [[Canada]]. The skyscraper is located at a high point on the downtown peninsula of Vancouver and its address is 1088 [[Burrard Street]]. 

One Wall Centre was designed by [[Busby and Associates Architects]]. It was completed in [[2001]] and won the [[Emporis Skyscraper Award]] for the Best New Skyscraper the same year.

Sheraton Wall Centre is the 2nd largest hotel in the nation with 765 rooms, 5-fewer than The [[Fairmont Banff Springs]].

==Background==

One Wall Centre is 48-storeys tall with a total height of 491 feet<ref name=buildings_feet>{{cite web |url = http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/sk/li/?id=100997&bt=2&ht=3&sro=1| title = Vancouver High-rise buildings (in feet)| publisher = Emporis Buildings | accessdate =2007-02-06}}</ref> (150 [[metre|m]]).  The first 27 floors of the building are the 4.5-star [[Sheraton Hotel]]. Floors 28, 29, and 30 are the [[Intrawest|Club Intrawest]] Resort floors; which are operated independent of Sheraton. The remaining 17 floors are private residential [[condominium]]s.  The One Wall Centre tower part of the Wall Centre complex owned by [[Wall Financial Corporation]] and was largely the vision of [[Peter Wall]].

==Construction==

To counteract possible [[harmonic]] swaying during high winds, One Wall has a tuned water [[damping]] system at the top level of the building which consists of two specially designed 50,000 Imperial gallon<ref name=Gotman>{{cite web |url = http://www.glotmansimpson.com/projects/onewallcentre/wallcentre.htm| title = One Wall Centre Project| publisher = Glotman<U+2022>Simpson | accessdate =2007-02-06}}</ref> (227,000 [[Litre|L]]) water tanks. These tanks are designed so that the [[frequency|harmonic frequency]] of the sloshing of the water in the tanks counteracts the harmonic frequency of the swaying of the building.

The tower exterior has a two-tone appearance.  The glass on the lower levels is a dark glass, while the glass on the upper levels is light coloured glass.  To satisfy the City of Vancouver Planning Department, who were concerned that the tower would dominate the downtown [[skyline]], it was agreed that it would have a very "light" appearance that would blend in with a blue sky.  After the design was approved, a minor amendment was requested to change it to a significantly darker glass.  This was approved by a low level staff member in the planning department who apparently did not realize the significance of this change.  When the glass started to be put on the building the city planners noted that this did not meet design that was reviewed by the public and the city planning department.  After many accusations back and forth as to the significance of this change and whether it required public review, the City agreed to compromise and allowed the lower [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] that was already installed to be the dark glazing, but required that the glazing on the upper levels be the light glazing that was originally proposed. 

The end result is the two toned structure that many consider would have been more architecturally stimulating if the single dark glazing had been allowed. Rumour has it that hotel owner Peter Wall threatened to call off the construction if the city forced him to replace all of the dark-paned glass, so a settlement was reached where only the remaining portion of the building (1/3 of its height) was faced with the typical "Yaletown green" lighter-coloured glass now common in the city's newer areas.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The attempt to maintain the dark blue appearance did not end there; the windows in the upper third were installed with dark blue blinds facing outwards. If all blinds were to be drawn at once, the building would achieve the intended dark blue appearance.

The Sheraton Wall Centre required a 75 feet<ref name=Gotman>{{cite web |url = http://www.glotmansimpson.com/projects/onewallcentre/wallcentre.htm| title = One Wall Centre Project| publisher = Glotman<U+2022>Simpson | accessdate =2007-02-06}}</ref> (23&nbsp;m) deep [[Foundation (architecture)|excavation]] &mdash; the deepest excavation prior to [[Living Shangri-La]] for a building in the city.

According to the June 2004 edition of Elevator World, Richmond Elevator
won a contract for the lowest bid to supply the building's elevators, one of the local
elevator firm's first examples of
[[Elevator#Traction elevators|traction elevators]]. Despite the One Wall Centre being the first traction elevator project by the company, most problems ran into during construction were mitigated. The
installation features 10 elevators, 8 of which are high speed geared
machines. The hotel is served by four 3,000 pound traction elevators at 800&nbsp;[[Feet per minute|fpm]] (244&nbsp;m/min),
with a group of 3 for public usage and a single private VIP access
elevator. There are also two hotel service elevators with 4,000 pound (1,800&nbsp;kg) capacity
each at 700&nbsp;fpm (213&nbsp;m/min). The apartments are served by 2 elevators each with a
capacity of 3,500 pounds (1,600&nbsp;kg) at 1,000&nbsp;fpm (305&nbsp;m/min). There are also 2 roped hydraulic elevators:
the 3,000 pounds (1,400&nbsp;kg) to serve the parking garage, and the 5,000 pounds (2,300&nbsp;kg) to serve the
banquet floors. There are 6 escalators installed by Fujitec.
