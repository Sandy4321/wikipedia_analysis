'''''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull''''' is a [[2008 in film|2008]] [[adventure film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], from a story co-written by [[executive producer]] [[George Lucas]]. Set in 1957, the fourth film in the [[Indiana Jones franchise|Indiana Jones film series]] pits an older [[Indiana Jones]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) against agents of the [[Soviet Union]], led by Irina Spalko ([[Cate Blanchett]]), in the search for a [[crystal skull]]. Indy is aided by his former lover [[Marion Ravenwood]] ([[Karen Allen]]), the [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] [[Henry "Mutt" Jones III|"Mutt" Williams]] ([[Shia LaBeouf]]), and fellow adventurer Mac ([[Ray Winstone]]). [[John Hurt]] and [[Jim Broadbent]] also play fellow academics.

The film was in development since the [[1989 in film|1989 release]] of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', because Spielberg and Ford disagreed over Lucas' original concept. Screenwriters [[Jeb Stuart (writer)|Jeb Stuart]], [[Jeffrey Boam]], [[Frank Darabont]] and [[Jeff Nathanson]] wrote drafts, before [[David Koepp]]'s script satisfied all three men. Shooting finally began on [[June 18]], [[2007]], and took place in [[New Mexico]]; [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]; [[Hawaii]]; [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[California]]; and soundstages in [[Los Angeles]]. In order to keep aesthetic continuity with the previous films, the crew relied on traditional stunt work instead of computer-generated stunt doubles, and [[cinematographer]] [[Janusz Kami<U+0144>ski]] studied [[Douglas Slocombe]]'s style from the previous films.

Marketing relied heavily on the public's nostalgia for the series, with products taking inspiration from all four films. Anticipation for the film was heightened by secrecy, which resulted in a legal dispute over an extra violating his [[non-disclosure agreement]], and the arrest of another man for stealing a computer containing various documents related to the production. ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' was released worldwide on [[May 22]], [[2008]].

== Plot ==
<!-- Wikipedia:WikiProject Films/Style guidelines states this section's length should be kept around 700 words.-->
In 1957, Colonel-Doctor Irina Spalko ([[Cate Blanchett]]) and a convoy of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agents posing as [[United States Army|U.S. soldiers]] infiltrate a military base in the [[Nevada]] desert. They force [[Indiana Jones]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) to lead them to a crate in "[[Government Warehouse|Hangar 51]]", which holds the remains of an [[extraterrestrial]] creature that [[Roswell UFO incident|crashed]] ten years before in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. Jones attempts to escape but is foiled by his partner Mac ([[Ray Winstone]]), who reveals that he is working with the Soviets. After a fight and an elaborate vehicle chase through the warehouse, Jones escapes on a [[rocket sled]] into the desert, where he stumbles upon a [[Nevada Test Site|nuclear test town]] and survives a [[nuclear blast]] by hiding in a [[lead]]-lined refrigerator. While being debriefed, Jones discovers he is under [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation because of Mac's Soviet ties. Jones returns to Marshall College, where he is offered a leave of absence to avoid being fired because of the investigation. While leaving, Jones is stopped by [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]] Mutt Williams ([[Shia LaBeouf]]) and told that his old colleague, Harold Oxley ([[John Hurt]]), disappeared after discovering a [[crystal skull]] near the [[Nazca lines]] in [[Peru]].

In Peru, Jones and Mutt discover that Oxley was locked in a church-operated [[psychiatric hospital]] until the Soviets kidnapped him. In Oxley's former cell, Jones discovers clues to the grave of [[Francisco de Orellana]], a [[Conquistador]] who went missing in the [[1500s]] while seeking Akator (also known as [[El Dorado]]). Jones finds the crystal skull that Oxley hid in Orellana's grave. The skull is elongated in the shape that indigenous peoples [[head flattening|formed their own skulls]] into, but the Soviets believe the skull, which [[magnetism|magnetically]] attracts even non-[[iron|ferrous]] objects, is from an extraterrestrial life-form and holds great [[psychic]] power.  The Soviets capture Indy and Mutt and take them to the camp where they are holding Oxley, who has suffered a [[mental breakdown]] from the powers of the skull, and Mutt's mother, [[Marion Ravenwood]] ([[Karen Allen]]), who reveals that Mutt is Jones's son. The four escape from the camp, leading to a lengthy vehicle chase involving sword fights and a pair of Soviet soldiers being killed by [[siafu]] ants. Escaping on an [[amphibious vehicle]], Mutt, Marion, Mac, Oxley, and Jones arrive at the Temple of Akator, a Maya-style pyramid in the [[Amazon rainforest]]. Claiming that he is a [[CIA]] [[double agent]] working ''against'' the Soviets, Mac enters the temple with Jones and the group, but reveals his true allegiance by leaving a trail for Spalko to follow.

The group enters the temple and Jones uses the skull to open the door to a [[chamber tomb]], where thirteen crystal skeletons, one missing a skull, are seated on thrones. When the Soviets arrive and reveal Mac's complicity, Spalko places the skull onto the skeleton, and it begins communicating to the group through Oxley using an ancient [[Mayan]] dialect. Jones translates this to mean that the aliens want to give them a great gift. Spalko demands to know everything, and the skulls begin transferring knowledge into her mind. As a portal to another dimension appears over the room, Oxley regains his sanity and explains that the aliens are inter-dimensional beings who taught the Maya their advanced technology. Jones, Mutt, Marion, and Oxley escape from the temple, but Mac is sucked into the portal. The skeletons form into a single alien which continues to feed Spalko with knowledge; however, the knowledge overwhelms Spalko, causing her to ignite and disintegrate, with her scattered essence sucked into the portal as well. The temple crumbles, and a [[flying saucer]] rises from the debris and disappears. Back home, Jones is made an associate dean at Marshall College and marries Marion.

His physicality is a big part of it, especially the way he gets out of tight situations. But it's not all hitting people and falling from high places.

Ford felt his reprise would also help American culture be less paranoid about aging (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film's family appeal: "This is a movie which is geared not to [the young] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment [...] We've got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints."<ref name=ford>{{cite news|author=Steve Daly|title=Harrison Ford Q&A: Indy speaks!|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=[[2008-04-19]]|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20192918,00.html|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script.<ref name="Koeppmag">{{Cite journal |author=Peter N.

'''[[Cate Blanchett]]''' plays the villainous [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agent '''Irina Spalko'''.

'''[[Karen Allen]]''' reprises the role of '''[[Marion Ravenwood]]''', under the married name of '''Marion Williams''', who appeared in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.

'''[[Ray Winstone]]''' plays '''George "Mac" McHale''', a [[British people|British]] agent whom Jones worked alongside in [[World War II]], but has now allied with the Russians due to his financial problems.

'''[[John Hurt]]''' plays '''Harold Oxley''', Mutt's surrogate father and an old friend of Indiana, whom he lost contact with in 1937. Six months prior to the events of the film, he went insane after discovering the crystal skull, which commanded him to return it to Akator.

During the late [[1970s]], [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] made a deal with [[Paramount Pictures]] for five [[Indiana Jones]] films.<ref>Rinzler, Bouzereau, p. 36</ref> Following the 1989 release of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Lucas let the series end as he felt he could not think of a good [[plot device]] to drive the next installment, and chose instead to produce ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', which explored the character in his early years. [[Harrison Ford]] played Indiana in one episode, narrating his adventures in 1920 [[Chicago]]. When Lucas shot Ford's role in December 1992, he realized the scene opened up the possibility of a film with an older Indiana set in the 1950s. The film could reflect a science fiction [[B movies (Transition in the 1950s)|1950s B-movie]], with aliens as the plot device.<ref name=atomicants>Rinzler, Bouzereau, Chapter 11: "Atomic Ants from Space: May 1989 to June 2007" p. 231&ndash;247</ref>

Ford disliked the new angle, telling Lucas "No way am I being in a Steve Spielberg movie like that."<ref name=untold /> Spielberg himself, who depicted aliens in ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' and ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', resisted it. Lucas came up with a story, which Jeb Stuart turned into a script from October 1993 to May 1994.<ref name=atomicants/> Lucas wanted Indiana to get married, which would allow [[Henry Jones Sr.]] to return, expressing concern over whether his son is happy with what he has accomplished.

Three months later, ''[[Independence Day (film)|Independence Day]]'' was released, and Spielberg told Lucas he would not make another alien invasion film. Lucas decided to focus on the [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequels]].<ref name=atomicants />

=== Filming ===

Unlike the previous Indiana Jones films, Spielberg only shot the film in the United States as he did not want to be away from his family.<ref name=lucasqaa/> Shooting began on [[June 18]] [[2007]]<ref name="shootingstart" /> at [[Deming, New Mexico]].<ref name="isle">{{Cite news | author = John Burnett | title = Ford lands on Big Isle | publisher = [[Hawaii Tribune-Herald]] | date = [[2007-07-11]] | url = http://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/articles/2007/07/11/local_news/local07.txt | accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref> An extensive chase scene set at Indiana Jones's fictional Marshall College was filmed between [[June 28]] and [[July 7]] at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] (where Spielberg's son Theo was studying).<ref name="path">{{Cite news | author=Ed Stannard | title = Casting call creates excitement far and wide | publisher = [[New Haven Register]] | date = [[2007-06-04]]}}</ref><ref name="isle"/><ref name=fandango/>

=== Design ===
Spielberg and [[Janusz Kami<U+0144>ski]], who has shot all of the director's films since 1993's ''Schindler's List'', rewatched the previous films to study [[Douglas Slocombe]]'s style. "I didn<U+2019>t want Janusz to modernize and bring us into the 21st century," Spielberg explained. "I still wanted the film to have a lighting style not dissimilar to the work Doug Slocombe had achieved, which meant that both Janusz and I had to swallow our pride. Janusz had to approximate another cinematographer<U+2019>s look, and I had to approximate this younger director<U+2019>s look that I thought I had moved away from after almost two decades."<ref name="keys" /> Spielberg also did not want to [[fast cutting|fast cut]] action scenes, relying on his script instead for a fast pace,<ref name="keys" /> and had confirmed in 2002 that he would not shoot the film digitally, a format Lucas had adopted.<ref name="lie">{{Cite news | title = Come Lie With Me | pages= 80&ndash;1 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=[[2003-01-03]]}}</ref> Lucas felt "it looks like it was shot three years after ''Last Crusade''.

While shooting ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' in late 2004, Spielberg met with stunt coordinator [[Vic Armstrong]], who doubled for Ford in the previous films, to discuss three action sequences he had envisioned.<ref name="race against time">{{Cite news | author=Nick de Semlyen, Ian Freer, Chris Hewitt, Ian Nathan, Sam Toy | title = A Race Against Time: Indiana Jones IV | pages = 100 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=[[2006-09-29]]}}</ref> However, Armstrong was filming ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'' during shooting of ''Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', so [[Dan Bradley]] was hired instead.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Is Dan Bradley stunt coordinator for Indy 4? | publisher = TheRaider.net | date = [[2007-09-04]] | url = http://www.theraider.net/news/fullstory_indy4.php?id=308 | accessdate=2007-09-11}}</ref> Bradley and Spielberg used [[previsualization]] for all the action scenes, except the motorcycle chase at Marshall College, because that idea was conceived after the animators had left.

=== Effects ===
[[Image:IJandthefakeleaves.jpg|thumb|250px|Stunts involving vehicles were shot on location in Hawaii, while CGI was used to add plants to the forest]]
Producer Frank Marshall stated in 2003 that the film would use traditional stunt work so as to be consistent with the previous films.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Exclusive: B-Movie Feel For Indy IV | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=[[2003-09-09]] | url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?nid=11918|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] was used to remove the visible safety wires on the actors when they did their stunts (such as when Indiana whips on to a lamp).<ref name=empire/> Timed explosives were used for a scene where Indiana drives a truck through a wall, which was dangerous because one explosive did not set off and landed in the seat beside Ford.<ref>{{cite news | author = Chrissy Iley | title = Keeping up with Indiana Jones | publisher = [[The Observer]] | date = [[2008-04-27]] | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2275988,00.html | accessdate=2008-04-30}}</ref>

During filming, Steven Spielberg estimated 30 percent of the film's shots would require CG [[matte painting]]s,<ref name=windingdown/> which contributed to the total 450 effects shots, which also include monkeys, army ants, the infinite warehouse crates, the flying saucer, the City of Gold, its gods and the atomic explosion. Spielberg initially wanted brushstrokes to be visible on the matte paintings for consistency with the effects of the previous films, but decided against it.<ref name=untold/> The script required a non-deforested jungle, but this would have been unsafe. [[Visual effects supervisor]] Pablo Helman (who worked on Spielberg's ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' and ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'') traveled to Brazil and Argentina to photograph elements that were composited into the final images.<ref>{{cite news | author = Derrik J.

Frank Marshall remarked, "In today's information age, secrecy has been a real challenge. [...] People actually said, 'No, we're going to respect Steven's vision." Fans on the internet have scrutinized numerous photos and the film's Lego sets in hope of understanding plot details; Spielberg biographer [[Ian Freer]] wrote, "What Indy IV is actually about has been the great cultural guessing game of 2007/08.

Unlike most film franchises, Paramount is only the distributor of ''Indiana Jones'', whose copyright is owned by [[Lucasfilm]], and their original deal entailed they would only earn 12.5% of the film's revenue. As the $185 million budget was larger than the original $125 million estimate,<ref name="titles" /> Lucas, Spielberg, and Ford turned down large upfront salaries so Paramount could cover the film's costs. In order for Paramount to see a profit beyond its distribution fee, the film must make over $400 million. At that point Lucas, Spielberg, Ford, and those with smaller profit-sharing deals will also begin to collect their cut.<ref name=treasure>{{cite news | author = Claudia Eller | title = Ford, Lucas, Spielberg on risky quest for treasure | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = [[2008-04-21]] | url = http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-indianajones21apr21,1,4784324.story | accessdate=2008-04-21}}</ref>
