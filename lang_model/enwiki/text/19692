'''Karol Borsuk''' ([[May 8]], [[1905]], [[Warsaw]] &ndash; [[January 24]], [[1982]], [[Warsaw]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] mathematician. 
His main interest was [[topology]].

Borsuk introduced the theory of ''absolute retracts'' (ARs) and ''absolute neighborhood retracts'' (ANRs), and the [[cohomotopy group]]s, later called Borsuk-[[Spanier]] cohomotopy groups. He also founded the so called [[Shape theory (mathematics)|Shape theory]]. He has constructed various beautiful examples of topological spaces, e.g. an acyclic, 3-dimensional continuum which admits a fixed point free homeomorphism onto itself; also 2-dimensional, contractible polyhedra which have no free edge. His topological and geometric conjectures and themes stimulated research for more than half a century.

Borsuk received his [[master's degree]] and [[doctorate]] from [[Warsaw University]] in 1927 and 1930, respectively; his [[Ph.D.]] thesis advisor was [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]]. He was a member of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] from 1952.  Borsuk's students included [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Krystyna Kuperberg]].
