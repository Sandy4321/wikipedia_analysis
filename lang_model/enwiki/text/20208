The '''North American XB-21''', also known by the manufacturer's model designation '''NA-21''', and sometimes referred to by the name "Dragon",<ref>Jones 1962, p. 65.</ref> was a prototype [[bomber aircraft]] developed by [[North American Aviation]] in the late 1930s, for evaluation by the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. Evaluated against the [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]], it was found to be considerably more expensive than the rival aircraft, and despite the ordering of a small number of evaluation aircraft, only the prototype was ever built.

==Design and development==
North American Aviation's first twin-engined military aircraft,<ref name="Boeing">Yenne 2005, pp. 64-65.</ref> the NA-21 prototype was constructed at North American's factory in [[Inglewood, California]],<ref name="DD">Donald 1997, p. 696</ref> where work on the aircraft begain in early 1936.<ref name="Baugher">Baugher 1999</ref> The NA-21 was a mid-wing [[monoplane]] of all-metal construction, powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney R-2180]] Twin Hornet [[radial engine]]s,<ref name="Baugher"/> which were fitted with [[turbosupercharger]]s for increased high-altitude performance.<ref name="DD"/>

Flown by a crew of six to eight men,<ref name="USAF"/> the XB-21 featured a remarkably strong defensive armament for the time,<ref name="DD"/> including as many as five .30-calibre [[M1919 Browning machine gun|M1919 machine gun]]s.<ref name="USAF">[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=2491 "Factsheets: North American XB-21"]. ''National Museum of the United States Air Force''. Accessed 2010-05-21.</ref> These were planned to be fitted in hydrauically powered<ref name="Reuter">Reuter 2000, p.38</ref> nose and dorsal [[Gun_turret#Aircraft|turrets]], in addition to manually operated weapons installed in waist and ventral positions.<ref name="DD"/> Up to {{convert|10000|lb}} of [[aerial bomb|bombs]] could be carried in an internal [[bomb bay]], with {{convert|2200|lb}} of bombs being able to be carried over a range of {{convert|1900|mi|km}}.<ref name="DD"/>

==Testing and evaluation== 
Undertaking its maiden flight on December 22 1936 at [[Mines Field]], company test flying indicated a number of minor problems.<ref name="TwoD">Rusinek 2005</ref> Modifications resolving these resulted in the aircraft being re-designated '''NA-39''', and, accepted by the U.S. Army Air Corps as the '''XB-21'''.  The aircraft, which had been assigned the serial number 38-485,<ref name="USAF"/> was evaluated early the following year in  competition against a similar design by [[Douglas Aircraft]], an improved version of the company's successful [[B-18 Bolo]].<ref name="USAF"/> During the course of the [[fly-off]], the gun turrets proved troublesome, their drive motors proving to be underpowered, and issues with wind blast through the gun slots were also encountered.<ref name="Reuter"/> As a result of these problems, the XB-21's nose turret was [[aircraft fairing|faired over]], while the dorsal turret was removed.<ref name="USAF"/>

The XB-21 proved to have superior performance over its competitor,<ref name="TwoD"/> but price became the primary factor distinguishing the Bolo and the XB-21.<ref name="Baugher"/> On this account, the modified B-18 was declared the winner of the competition, Douglas quoting a price per aircraft of $64,000 [[USD]], while North American's estimate was $122,000 USD per aircraft,<ref name="USAF"/> and an order was placed for 177 of the Douglas aircraft, to be designated B-18A.<ref name="Baugher"/> Despite this, the Army Air Corps found the performance of the XB-21 to have been favorable enough to order five pre-production aircraft, to be designated YB-21.<ref name="USAF"/> However, soon after this contract was awarded, it was cancelled, and none of the YB-21s were ever built, leaving the XB-21 as the sole example of the type ever constructed.<ref name="USAF"/> Operated by North American Aviation, the XB-21 served as a research aircraft until its retirement.<ref name="Boeing"/>

==Legacy==
Although the XB-21 failed to win a production contract, it was the first of a long line of North American Aviation medium bomber aircraft, and provided experience and knowledge that assisted in the development of the [[North American NA-40]],<ref>Yenne 2006, p. 87.</ref> which, developed into the [[B-25 Mitchell]], would become one of the Army's standard medium bombers of the [[Second World War]].<ref>Donald 1997, p. 697.</ref>
