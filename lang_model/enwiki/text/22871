The '''Mini''' is a small [[Automobile|car]] that was produced by the [[British Motor Corporation]] (BMC) and its successors from 1959 until 2000. The original is considered an icon of the 1960s,<ref name="reed1">{{cite book | author=Reed, Chris | title= Complete Classic Mini 1959-2000 | isbn=1-899870-60-1 }}</ref><ref name="reed2">{{cite book | author=Reed, Chris | title=Complete Mini: 35 Years Of Production History, Model Changes, Performance Data | isbn=0-947981-88-8 }}</ref><ref name="clausager">{{cite book | author= Clausager, Anders | title=Essential Mini Cooper | isbn=1-870979-86-9 }}</ref> and its space-saving front-wheel-drive layout (that allowed 80% of the area of the car's floorpan to be used for passengers and luggage) influenced a generation of car-makers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Buckley & Chris Rees|title=Cars: An encyclopedia of the world's most fabulous automobiles|year=2006|publisher=Hermes House|isbn=1-84309-266-2|quote=The BMC Mini, launched in 1959, is Britain's most influential car ever.

In 1999 the Mini was voted the second most influential [[Car of the Century|car of the 20th Century]], behind the [[Ford Model T]].

This distinctive two-door car was designed for BMC by [[Sir Alec Issigonis]].<ref name="issigbio">{{cite book | author=Wood, Jonathan | title=Alec Issigonis: The Man Who Made the Mini | publisher=Breedon Books Publishing | year=2005 | isbn=1-85983-449-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Nahum, Andrew | title=Issigonis and the Mini | publisher=Icon Books | year=2004 | isbn=1-84046-640-5}}</ref> It was manufactured at the [[Longbridge plant|Longbridge]] and [[Cowley, Oxfordshire|Cowley]] plants in England, the Victoria Park / Zetland [[British Motor Corporation (Australia)]] factory in [[Sydney]], Australia, and later also in Spain ([[Authi]]), Belgium, Chile, Italy ([[Innocenti]]), Portugal, South Africa, Uruguay, Venezuela and Yugoslavia. The Mini [[Mark I Mini|Mark I]] had three major UK updates: the Mark II, the Clubman and the Mark III. Within these was a series of variations including an [[estate car]], a [[pickup truck]], a [[van]] and the [[Mini Moke]] <U+2014> a [[jeep]]-like buggy. The Mini Cooper and Cooper "S" were sportier versions that were successful as [[rally car]]s, winning the [[Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo Rally]] four times from 1964 through to 1967, although in 1966 the Mini was disqualified after the finish, along with six other British entrants, which included the first four finishing cars, under a questionable ruling that the cars had used an illegal combination of headlamps and spotlights.<ref>{{cite news

Minis were marketed under the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Morris Motor Company|Morris]] names until Mini became a [[marque]] in its own right in 1969.<ref>Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945-1970, 1986</ref>  The Mini was again marketed under the Austin name plate in the 1980s.

== Design and development ==
 
Designed as project ADO15 ([[Austin Motor Company|'''A'''ustin]] '''D'''rawing '''O'''ffice project number '''15'''), the Mini came about because of a fuel shortage caused by the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name=Greatcars>{{cite book |last=Coulter |first=Jeremy |title=The World's Great Cars |year=1989 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |location=London |isbn=0-86283-726-X}}</ref>  Petrol was once again rationed in the UK, sales of large cars slumped, the market for German ''[[Bubble car]]s'' boomed. [[Leonard Lord]], the somewhat [[autocratic]] head of BMC, reportedly decreed:  'God damn these bloody awful Bubble Cars. We must drive them off the road by designing a proper miniature car'. He laid down some basic design requirements: the car should be contained within a box that measured 10 <U+00D7> 4 <U+00D7> 4&nbsp;ft (3 <U+00D7> 1.2 <U+00D7> 1.2&nbsp;m); and the passenger accommodation should occupy 6&nbsp;ft (1.8&nbsp;m) of the 10&nbsp;ft (3&nbsp;m) length; and the engine, for reasons of cost, should be an existing unit. Issigonis, who had been working for [[Alvis cars|Alvis]], had been recruited back to BMC in 1955 and, with his skills in designing small cars, was a natural for the task. The team that designed the Mini was remarkably small: as well as Issigonis, there was Jack Daniels (who had worked with him on the [[Morris Minor]]), Chris Kingham (who had been with him at Alvis), two engineering students and four draughtsmen. Together, by October 1957, they had designed and built the original prototype, which was affectionately named 'The Orange Box' because of its colour.<ref name="reed1"/>

The ADO15 used a conventional [[BMC A-Series engine|BMC A-Series]] [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] [[water-cooled]] engine,<ref name="ado15">[http://www.mgcars.org.uk/carclub/sf020201.html Engines of the ADO15 and family]</ref> but departed from tradition by mounting it [[Transverse engine|transversely]], with the engine-oil-lubricated, four-speed transmission in the [[sump]], and by employing [[front-wheel drive]]. Almost all small front-wheel-drive cars developed since have used a similar configuration. The radiator was mounted at the left side of the car so that the engine-mounted fan could be retained, but with reversed pitch so that it blew air into the natural low pressure area under the front wing. This location saved precious vehicle length, but had the disadvantage of feeding the radiator with air that had been heated by passing over the engine.

[[Image:Morris Mini interior 1959.jpg|thumb|right|1959 Morris Mini-Minor interior]]
The [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system, designed by Issigonis' friend [[Alex Moulton|Dr. Alex Moulton]] at [[Moulton Developments Limited]], used compact rubber cones instead of conventional springs. This ingenious space-saving design also featured rising progressive rate springing of the cones, and provided some natural damping force. Built into the subframes, the rubber cone system gave a raw and bumpy ride which was accentuated by the woven-webbing seats, but the rigidity of the rubber cones, together with the wheels being pushed out to the corners of the car, gave the Mini [[go kart]]-like handling that would become famous. 

Initially an interconnected fluid system was planned <U+2014> similar to the one which Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton were working on in the mid-1950s at Alvis.  They had assessed the mechanically interconnected [[Citroen 2CV]] suspension at that time (according to an interview by Moulton with CAR magazine in the late 1990s), which inspired the design of the Hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Austin 1100, to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the roadwheel under good control and the tyre in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV was very much lacking. The short development time of the car meant this was not ready in time for the Mini's launch.  The system intended for the Mini was further developed and the [[hydrolastic]] system and was first used on the [[Austin 1100]], launched in 1962, with the Mini following two years later. Ten-inch (254&nbsp;mm) wheels were specified, so new tyres needed to be developed, the initial contract going to [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]. Issigonis went to Dunlop stating that he wanted even smaller, {{convert|8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheels (even though ''he'' had already settled on ten-inch). An agreement was made on the ten-inch size, after Dunlop choked on the eight-inch proposition.

Sliding windows allowed storage pockets in the hollow doors; reportedly Issigonis sized them fit a bottle of [[Gordon's Gin]].<ref name="issigbio"/> The [[trunk (automobile)|boot]] lid was designed with the hinges at the bottom so that the car could be driven with it open to increase luggage space. On early cars the [[vehicle registration plate|number plate]] was hinged so it swung down to remain visible when the boot lid was open. This design was later discontinued as it was discovered that exhaust gases could leak into the cockpit while the boot was open.

The Mini was designed as a [[monocoque]] shell with welded seams that are visible on the outside of the car running down the [[A-pillar|A and C pillars]], and between the body and the floor pan showing where the joins are. To further simplify construction, the car had external door and boot hinges.

[[Image:Mini cross section.jpg|thumb|right|Cross-section shows how Mini maximizes passenger space]]

All of these novel and elegant technical innovations resulted in a car with minimum overall dimensions yet maximised space for both passengers and luggage.

Production models differed from the prototype by the addition of front and rear subframes to the unibody to take the suspension loads, and by turning the engine around with the [[carburettor]] at the back rather than at the front. This required an extra gear to be placed between engine and [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] to reverse the engine direction. Making this a reduction gear had the beneficial effect of reducing loads on the gearbox and preventing the rapid wear on the [[synchromesh]] which had been a problem on early prototypes. Having the carburettor at the rear helped to reduce [[carburetor icing|carburettor icing]], but did expose the [[distributor]] to water coming in through the grille. The engine size was reduced from 948&nbsp;cc to 848&nbsp;cc, which reduced the top speed from an unprecedented 90&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]] (145&nbsp;[[Kilometre per hour|km/h]]) to a more manageable (for the time) 72&nbsp;mph (116&nbsp;km/h), as well as reducing cabin noise quite a bit. This decision was reversed in 1967.

Despite its utilitarian origins, the classic Mini shape had become so iconic that by the 1990s, [[MG Rover Group|Rover Group]] <U+2014> the heirs to BMC <U+2014> were able to register its design as a trade mark in its own right.<ref>[http://www.crossguard.info/about-us.html Trade Mark, Copyright and Patent Attorneys in Bromsgrove<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Mark I Mini: 1959&ndash;1967 ==
[[Image:Mini Original 1959.jpg|thumb|right|The first Morris Mini-Minor sold in Texas being delivered to a family in Arlington Texas in 1959.]]
{{see also|Mark I Mini}}	

The production version of the Mini was demonstrated to the press in April 1959, and by August several thousand cars had been produced ready for the first sales.<ref name="autocar59">{{cite journal | title=Happy Events (Editorial) | journal=The Autocar | year=1959 | issue=3315 | pages= 45}}</ref>

The name ''Mini'' did not appear by itself immediately <U+2014> the first models being marketed under two of BMC's brand names, ''Austin'' and ''Morris''. The name '''Austin Seven''' (sometimes written as ''SE7EN'' in early publicity material) recalled the popular small [[Austin 7]] of the 1920s and 1930s. The other name used till 1967 in the United Kingdom (and in Commonwealth countries such as Australia), '''Morris Mini-Minor''', seems to have been a play on words. The Morris Minor was a well known and successful car, with the word ''minor'' being Latin for "smaller"; so an abbreviation of the Latin word for "smallest"<U+2014>''minimus''<U+2014>was used for the new even smaller car. It was originally going to be called the Austin Newmarket.
[[Image:Austin mini850mk1 governorhouse.jpg|thumb|right|1963 Austin Mini 850 Mark I]]

Until 1962, the cars appeared as the ''Austin 850'' and ''Morris 850'' in North America and France, and in Denmark as the ''Austin Partner'' (until 1964) and ''Morris Mascot'' (until 1981). The name ''Mini'' was first used domestically by BMC for Austin's version in 1961, when the ''Austin Seven'' was rebranded as the ''Austin Mini'',<ref name= "brochures">[http://mk1-performance-conversions.co.uk/mini_brochures.htm A list of early Mini advertisement material]</ref> somewhat to the surprise of the [[Bond Cars Ltd|Sharps Commercials]] car company (later known as ''[[Bond Cars Ltd]]'') who had been using the name ''[[Minicar]]'' for their three-wheeled vehicles since 1949. However, legal action was somehow averted, <ref name="bondcars">[http://www.bondownersclub.co.uk Discussion in Bond Owners Club forums]</ref> and BMC used the name ''Mini'' for the remainder of the car's life.<ref name= "mrtb3">{{cite book | title=Mini Road Test Book: Mini Gold Portfolio 1959-69 | isbn=1-85520-300-6 }}</ref>

In 1964, the suspension of the cars was replaced by another Moulton design, the [[hydrolastic]] system. The new suspension gave a softer ride but it also increased weight and production cost and, in the minds of many enthusiasts, spoiled the handling characteristics, for which the Mini was so famous. In 1971, the original rubber suspension reappeared and was retained for the remaining life of the Mini.
[[Image:Mini Van 001.JPG|thumb|right|Austin Mini Van, [[Automobile Association]] livery]] 

From October 1965 the option of an [[Automotive Products]] (AP) designed four-speed [[automatic transmission]] became available.

Slow at the outset, Mark I sales strengthened across most of the model lines in the 1960s, and production totalled 1,190,000.<ref name= "sales">[http://www.miniresource.com/prodmodel.php Production numbers by model]</ref> Sold at almost below cost, the basic Mini made very little money for its owners. However, it still did make a small profit. [[Ford]] once took a Mini away and completely de-constructed it, possibly to see if they could offer an alternative. It was their opinion though, that they could not sell it for what the BMC was. [[Ford]] determined that the BMC must have been losing around 30 pounds per car. The BMC insisted that the way company overheads were shared out, the Mini always made money.<ref>Laban, Brian (2005)The Little Book Of MINI </ref> Larger profits came from the popular ''De Luxe'' models and from optional accessories, such as seat belts, door mirrors, a heater and a radio, which would be considered necessities on modern cars, as well as the various 'Cooper' and 'Cooper S' models, to be discussed later.

The Mini etched its place into popular culture in the 1960s with well-publicised purchases by film and music stars.<ref>Golding, Rob (2007). "Initial sales were worryingly slow. Then to the rescue came the rich and fashionable...[[The Beatles]], [[Princess Margaret]] with [[Lord Snowdon]], [[Peter Sellers]] and [[Mary Quant]], [[Harry Secombe]] and [[Graham Hill]] were all seen around town in Minis." p.33, ''Mini 50 Years'', Motorbooks.

From 1967 to 1970, Issigonis had been designing a replacement for the Mini in the form of an experimental model called the 9X.<ref name="issigbio"/> It was shorter and more powerful than the Mini, but due to politicking inside [[British Leyland]] (which had now been formed by the merger of BMC's parent company [[British Motor Holdings]] and the [[Leyland Motor Corporation]]), the car did not reach production. 

It was an intriguing "might-have-been"; the car was technologically advanced, and many believe it would have been competitive up until the 1980s.

The Mark II Mini featured a redesigned front grille which remained with the car from that point on. Also, a larger rear window and numerous cosmetic changes were introduced. 429,000 Mark II Minis were made.<ref name= "sales"/><ref name="mrtb4">{{cite book | title=Mini Road Test Book: Mini Gold Portfolio 1969<U+2013>80 | isbn=1-85520-301-4 }}</ref><ref name="mrtb6">{{cite book | title=Mini Road Test Book: High Performance Minis Gold Portfolio 1960-73 | isbn=1-85520-317-0 }}</ref>

A bewildering variety of Mini types were made in [[Pamplona]], Spain, by the [[Authi]] company from 1968 onwards, mostly under the Morris name.

The Mini was arguably the star of the 1969 film ''[[The Italian Job]]'', which features a car chase in which a gang of thieves drive three Minis down staircases, through storm drains, over buildings and finally into the back of a moving bus. This film was [[The Italian Job (2003 film)|remade in 2003]] using the [[MINI (BMW)|new MINI]].

[[Image:Riley.elf.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|1968 Mark III Riley Elf.]]
== Variants ==
The popularity of the original Mini spawned many models that targeted different markets:

;[[Wolseley Motor Company|Wolseley]] Hornet and [[Riley (automobile)|Riley]] Elf (1961<U+2013>1969)

Built as more luxurious versions of the Mini, both the Wolseley Hornet and the Riley Elf had longer, slightly finned rear wings and larger boots that gave the cars a more traditional <U+201C>[[notchback]]<U+201D> look. Front-end treatment, which incorporated each marque<U+2019>s traditional upright grille design, also contributed to a less utilitarian appearance. The cars had larger-diameter chrome hubcaps than the Austin and Morris Minis, also additional chrome accents, bumper overriders and wood-veneer dashboards. The Riley was the more expensive version of the two cars.<ref>[http://www.motorbase.com/vehicle/by-id/710/ "Riley Elf", ''Motorbase'']. Retrieved on June 21, 2008.]</ref>  The name "Wolseley Hornet" was first used on a [[Wolseley Hornet (1930)|1930s sports car]], while the name "Elf" recalled the [[Riley Nine|Riley Sprite]] and Imp sports cars, also of the 1930s. The full width dashboard was a differentiator between the Elf and Hornet. This better dashboard was the idea of Christopher Milner the Sales Manager for Riley.

Both cars went through three versions. Initially, they used the 848&nbsp;cc engine, changing to a single carburettor version of the Cooper's 998&nbsp;cc power unit in the Mark II in 1963. The MKIII facelift of 1966 brought wind-up windows and fresh-air fascia vents; also concealed door hinges two years before these were seen on the mainstream Mini. 30,912 Riley Elfs and 28,455 Wolseley Hornets were built.<ref name="sales"/>

[[Image:Mini countryman.jpg|thumb|right|Mark II Austin Mini Countryman]]
;Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman (1961<U+2013>1969, [[United Kingdom|UK]] only)

Two-door estate cars with double "barn"-style rear doors. Both were built on a slightly longer chassis of 84&nbsp;[[inch]] (2.14&nbsp;m) compared to 80.25&nbsp;inch (2.04&nbsp;m) for the saloon.

The luxury models had decorative, non-structural wood inserts in the rear body which gave the car a similar appearance to the larger Morris Minor estate which had some of the look of an American-style 1950s [[Woodie]]. Approximately 108,000 Austin Mini Countrymen and 99,000 Morris Mini Travellers were built.<ref name="sales"/>

;Mini Van (1960&ndash;1982)

A commercial panel van rated at <U+00BC>-ton load capacity. Built on the longer Traveller chassis but without side windows, it proved popular in 1960s Britain as a cheaper alternative to the car as it was classed as a commercial vehicle and carried no sales tax. A set of simple stamped steel slots served in place of a more costly chrome grille. The Mini Van was renamed as the Mini 95 in 1978, the number representing the gross vehicle weight of 0.95&nbsp;tons. 521,494 were built.<ref name="sales"/>

;Mini Moke (1964 and 1968 in the UK, 1966&ndash;1982 in Australia and 1983&ndash;1989 in Portugal)<ref name="mrtb2">{{cite book | title=Mini Road Test Book: Mini Moke Gold Portfolio 1964-94 | isbn=1-85520-240-9 }}</ref>

{{main|Mini Moke}}

A utility vehicle designed for the British Army, for whom 600 twin-engined 4-wheel-drive versions were purpose-built. Although the 4WD Moke could climb a 2-in-1 gradient, it proved to have insufficient ground clearance for military use.<ref>[http://www.theunmutual.co.uk/minimoke.htm Kitcher, Nigel and Davy, Rick. "The Mini Moke", ''The Unmutual Prisoner  Vehicle Guide'']. Retrieved on June 20, 2008.</ref> The single-engined front-wheel-drive Moke enjoyed some popularity in civilian production. About 50,000 were made.<ref name="sales"/> The car featured in the cult 1967 TV series ''[[The Prisoner]]'', and is popular in holiday locations such as Barbados and Macau, where Mokes were used as police cars. Mokes were also available to rent there as recently as March 2006. "Moke" is archaic British slang for a donkey.

[[Image:Mini pickup truck.jpg|thumb|right|A Mini Pickup.]]
;Mini Pick-up (1961&ndash;1982)

A pick-up truck, {{convert|11|ft|m|abbr=on}} from nose to tail,  built on the longer Mini Van platform, with an open-top rear cargo area and a tailgate. The factory specified the weight of the Pickup as less than {{convert|1500|lb|abbr=on}} with a full {{Convert|6|impgal|L usgal|0}} of fuel. 

As with the Van, the Pickup did not have a costly chrome grille. Instead, a simple set of stamped metal slots allowed airflow into the engine compartment. The Pickup was spartan in basic form, although the factory brochure informed prospective buyers that <U+201C>[a] fully equipped Mini Pick-up is also available which includes a recirculatory heater.<U+201D> Passenger-side sun visor, seat belts, laminated windscreen, tilt tubes and cover were available at extra cost.<ref>[http://www.minipickup.org/literature/viewitem.php?p=6519 <U+201C>Dependable in service <U+2013> Austin Mini van and pickup<U+201D>, <U+2018><U+2019>Mini Pick-up International<U+2019><U+2019>].

A total of 58,179 Mini Pickups were built.<ref name="sales"/>

;Morris Mini K (March 1969 &ndash; August 1971 Australia only)
Built in the Australian British Motor Corporation factory at Zetland, NSW using 80% local content, the Morris Mini K was advertised as the "great leap forward".<ref>[http://www.aronline.co.uk/index.htm?akaado15f.htm Scanned copy of the Mini K brochure]</ref> The Mini K ('K' standing for Kangaroo) had a 1098 cc engine and was the last round-nose model to be produced in Australia, originally priced at $1780 (AUD).

== Mini Cooper and Cooper S: 1961&ndash;2000 == <!-- Template:Cooper Car Company links here -->
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Pics 016.jpg|thumb|Mini Cooper S at the Grand Prix de Malte 2007]] -->
Issigonis' friend [[John Cooper (car maker)|John Cooper]], owner of the [[Cooper Car Company]] and designer and builder of [[Formula 1]] and rally cars, saw the potential of the Mini for competition. Issigonis was initially reluctant to see the Mini in the role of a performance car,  but after John Cooper appealed to BMC management, the two men collaborated to create the '''Mini Cooper''', a nimble, economical and inexpensive car. The Austin Mini Cooper and Morris Mini Cooper debuted in 1961.<ref name="issigbio"/><ref name="mrtb1">{{cite book | title=Mini Road Test Book: Mini Cooper Gold Portfolio 1961&ndash;71 | isbn=1-85520-052-X }}</ref>

The original 848&nbsp;cc engine from the Morris Mini-Minor was increased to 997&nbsp;cc, boosting power from 34&nbsp;[[Horsepower|bhp]] to 55&nbsp;bhp (25 to 41&nbsp;[[Watt|kW]]).<ref name="ado15"/> The car featured a racing-tuned engine, twin [[SU carburetor|SU carburettors]], a closer-ratio gearbox and front [[disc brake]]s, uncommon at the time in a small car. One thousand units of this version were commissioned by management, intended for and designed to meet the [[homologation]] rules of [[Group A|Group 2]] rally racing. The 997&nbsp;cc engine was replaced by a shorter stroke 998 cc&nbsp;unit in 1964.
[[Image:63AustinCooperS.JPG|thumb|1963 Austin Mini Cooper S]]

A more powerful Mini Cooper, dubbed the "S", was developed in tandem and released in 1963. Featuring a 1071&nbsp;cc engine and larger [[Vacuum servo|servo-assisted]] disc brakes, 4,030 Cooper S cars were produced and sold until the model was updated in August 1964. Cooper also produced two models specifically for circuit racing, rated at 970&nbsp;cc and a 1275&nbsp;cc, both of which were also offered to the public. The smaller-engine model was not well received, and only 963 had been built when the model was discontinued in 1965. The 1275&nbsp;cc Cooper S models continued in production until 1971.

Sales of the Mini Cooper were as follows: 64,000 Mark I Coopers with 997&nbsp;cc or 998&nbsp;cc engines; 19,000 Mark I Cooper S with 970&nbsp;cc, 1071&nbsp;cc or 1275&nbsp;cc engines; 16,000 Mark II Coopers with 998&nbsp;cc engines; 6,300 Mark II Cooper S with 1275&nbsp;cc engines. There were no Mark III Coopers and just 1,570 Mark III Cooper S's.

The Mini Cooper S earned acclaim with [[Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo Rally]] victories in 1964, 1965 and 1967.<ref name="montecarlo"/> Minis were initially placed first, second and third in the 1966 rally as well, but were disqualified after a controversial decision by the French judges.

In 1971, the Mini Cooper design was licensed in Italy by [[Innocenti]] and in 1973 to Spain by Authi (Automoviles de Turismo Hispano-Ingleses), which began to produce the Innocenti Mini Cooper 1300 and the Authi Mini Cooper 1300, respectively.

A new Mini Cooper named the RSP (Rover Special Products) was briefly relaunched in 1990-1991, with slightly lower performance than the 1960s Cooper. It proved so popular that the new Cooper-marked Mini went into full production in late 1991. From 1992, Coopers were fitted with a [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the 1275&nbsp;cc engine, and in 1997 a multi-point fuel injected engine was introduced, along with a front-mounted radiator and various safety improvements. <ref name="parnell2">{{cite book | last=Parnell| first=John | title=Original Mini-Cooper: The Restorers Guide To All MKL, II, And III Models | isbn=1-870979-32-X }}</ref>

In 1969, under the ownership of British Leyland, the Mini was given a facelift by stylist [[Roy Haynes (designer)|Roy Haynes]], who had previously worked for [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. The restyled version was called the Mini Clubman, and has a squarer frontal look, using the same indicator/sidelight assembly as the [[Austin Maxi]]. The Mini Clubman was intended to replace the upmarket Riley and Wolseley versions. A new model, dubbed the 1275GT, was slated as the replacement for the 998&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper (the 1275&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper S continued alongside the 1275GT for two years until 1971). The Clubman Estate took over where the Countryman and Traveller left off.

The 1275GT is often incorrectly described as the "Mini Clubman 1275GT". The official name was always just the "Mini 1275GT", and it was a separate, distinct model from the Clubman (albeit, it shared the same frontal treatment as the Mini Clubman, and was launched at the same time).

In 1971, the 1275&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper S was discontinued in the UK, leaving the Mini 1275GT as the only sporting Mini on sale for the rest of the decade. Innocenti in Italy, however, continued making their own version of the Mini Cooper for some time, and In Australia from mid 1971 to the end of 1972, the [http://www.clubmangt.com.au Clubman GT] was locally produced. This was essentially a Cooper S in Clubman body, equipped with the same {{convert|7.5|in|mm|sing=on}} disc brakes, twin fuel tanks, and twin-carb Cooper S 1275&nbsp;cc engine. While the UK built 1275GT was not nearly as quick as a 1275 Mini Cooper S, it was cheaper to buy, run, and insure. It was the first Mini to be equipped with a [[tachometer]]. It also featured a standard-fit close-ratio gearbox. Performance of the 1275GT was lively for the time, achieving 0<U+2013>{{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} in 12.9&nbsp;seconds, and the excellent midrange torque offered a {{convert|30|<U+2013>|50|mph|abbr=on}} time in top gear of only nine seconds. The bluff front, however, meant that the model struggled to reach {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The 1275&nbsp;cc A-series engine could be cheaply and easily tuned, though the cheap purchase price and prominent "sidewinder" door stripes meant that this model developed a reputation as something of a "boy-racer special" during the 1970s and into the 1980s.

The Mini Clubman and 1275GT were responsible for two motoring "firsts": they were the first vehicles to use a flexi printed-circuit board behind the dash instruments (universal nowadays, but technically advanced for 1969). Secondly, the 1275GT was the first vehicle to be offered with [[Run flat tire|run-flat tyres]]; from 1974 this model could be ordered with optional Dunlop Denovo tyres on {{convert|12|in|mm|sing=on}} diameter rims. In the event of a puncture, the Dunlop Denovo tyre would not burst and quickly deflate, but could continue to be used safely at speeds of up to {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. This was a useful safety feature, although the increased road noise and relatively poor grip of this tyre meant that many 1275GT buyers ignored this option.
 
Throughout the 1970s, British Leyland continued to produce the classic 1959 "round-front" design, alongside the newer Clubman and 1275GT models. On the Australian market however, all Minis (including the commercial derivatives) gained the Clubman front. Clubman sedans were marketed in Australia under the '''Morris Mini Clubman''' name when introduced in August 1971,<Ref>Green Book Price & Model Guide, July-August 1983, page 71</ref> and as the '''Leyland Mini''' from February 1973.<Ref>Green Book Price & Model Guide, July-August 1983, page 60</ref>

The long-nose Clubman and 1275GT offered better crash safety, were better equipped, and had vastly better under-bonnet access, but they were more expensive and aerodynamically inferior to the original 1959 design. The Mini Clubman and 1275GT were replaced in 1980 by the new hatchback Austin Metro, while production of the original "round-front" mini design continued for another 20 years. At the end of Clubman and 1275GT production, 275,583 Clubman saloons, 197,606 Clubman Estates and 110,673 1275GTs had been made.<ref name="sales"/>

The Mark III Mini had a modified bodyshell with enough alterations to see the factory code change from ADO15 to ADO20 (which it shared with the [[Clubman]]). The most obvious changes were larger doors with concealed hinges. Customer demand led to the sliding windows being replaced with winding windows <U+2014> although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening quarterlight windows). The suspension reverted from [[Hydrolastic]] to rubber as a cost-saving measure.<ref name="mrtb5">{{cite book | title=Mini Gold Portfolio 1981-1997 | isbn=1-85520-385-5 }}</ref>

Production at the Cowley plant was ended, and the simple name '''''Mini''''' completely replaced the separate Austin and Morris brands.<ref>[http://www.histomobile.com/1/Mini/1969/-_.htm?lan=1 Mini - mk III (1969&ndash;2000) history, pictures<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

*Mark III (introduced in November 1969) had wind up windows with internal door hinges except for the van and pickup models. The boot lid lost the original hinged number plate and its recess shape and a large rear colour coded lamp was fitted in its place, along with larger rear side windows. 

*Mark IV (introduced in 1976) had a front rubber mounted subframe with single tower bolts and the rear frame had some larger bushes introduced. Twin stalk indicators were introduced with larger foot pedals. From 1977 onwards, the rear indicator lamps had the reverse lights incorporated in them. 

In the late 1970s, Innocenti introduced the [[Innocenti Mini|Innocenti 90 and 120]], [[Bertone]]-designed hatchbacks based on the Mini platform. Bertone also created a Mini Cooper equivalent, christened the [[Innocenti De Tomaso]], that sported a 1275&nbsp;cc engine similar to the MG Metro engine but with a 11 stud head, a special inlet manifold and uset the A clutch instead of the verto type. The most important feature was the utilization of homocinetic shafts, avoiding the rubber couplings.

By this stage, the Mini was still hugely popular in Britain, but it was looking increasingly outdated in the face of newer and more practical rivals including the [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Vauxhall Chevette]], [[Chrysler Sunbeam]], [[Volkswagen Polo]] and [[Renault 5]]. Since the late 1960s, plans had been in place for a newer and more practical supermini to replace it, though the Mini was still the only car of this size built by British Leyland for the home market. 

Reports of the Mini's imminent demise surfaced again in 1980 with the launch of the [[Austin Metro|Austin Mini-Metro]] (badging with the word ''mini'' in all lowercase). In New Zealand in 1981, the Mini starred in a road trip movie directed by [[Geoff Murphy]] called ''[[Goodbye Pork Pie]]''. The Mini was beginning to fall out of favour in many export markets, with the South African, Australian, and New Zealand markets all stopping production around this time.

Although the Mini continued after the Metro's launch, production volumes were reduced as British Leyland and successor combine Austin Rover concentrated on the Metro as its key supermini. Indeed, 1981 was the Mini's last year in the top ten of Britain's top selling cars, as it came ninth and the Metro was fifth.

== End of production ==
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the British market enjoyed numerous "special editions" of the Mini, which shifted the car from a mass-market item into a fashionable icon. It was this image that perhaps helped the Mini become such an asset for [[BMW]], which later bought the remnants of BMC as the [[MG Rover Group|Rover Group]]. It was even more popular in Japan, where it was seen as a retro-cool icon, and inspired many imitators. The ERA Mini Turbo was particularly popular with Japanese buyers.

In 1994, under [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]], a [[first cousin once removed]] of Issigonis, BMW took control of the Rover Group, which included the Mini, fitting an [[airbag]] to comply with European legislation.

By March 2000, Rover was still suffering massive losses, and BMW decided to dispose of most of the companies. The sell-off was completed in May that year. [[MG (car)|MG]] and Rover went to [[Phoenix Venture Holdings|Phoenix]], a new British consortium; and [[Land Rover]] was sold to [[Ford Motor Company]]. BMW retained the Mini name and the planned new model, granting Rover temporary rights to the brand and allowing it to manufacture and sell the run-out model of the old Mini. By April 2000, the range consisted of four versions: the Mini Classic Seven, the Mini Classic Cooper, the Mini Classic Cooper Sport and <U+2014> for overseas European markets <U+2014> the Mini Knightsbridge. The last Mini (a red Cooper Sport) was built on [[October 4]] [[2000]] and presented to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust in December of that year.<ref name="reed1"/>  A total of 5,387,862 cars had been manufactured.<ref name="sales"/>

After the last of the Mini production had been sold, the 'Mini' name reverted to BMW ownership. The new [[MINI (BMW)|'BMW' MINI]] is technically unrelated to the old car but retains the classic transverse 4-cylinder, front-wheel-drive configuration and iconic "bulldog" stance of the original.

*Mark V (from 1984): all cars had {{convert|8.4|in|mm|sing=on}} brake discs and plastic wheel arches (mini special arches) but retained the same Mark IV body shell shape. 

*Mark VI (from 1990): the engine mounting points were moved forward to take 1275&nbsp;cc power units, and includes the [[HIF]] carb version, plus the single point fuel injected car which came out in 1991. The 998&nbsp;cc power units were discontinued. Internal bonnet release were fitted from 1992. 

*Mark VII was the final twin point injection with front mounted radiator.

== Limited editions ==
{{main|List of Mini limited editions}}
From the Mark V onward, many special limited-production editions of the Mini were offered. These included models that were created to commemorate racing victories or to celebrate an anniversary of the Mini marque. Limited editions generally came equipped with a unique combination of interior and exterior trim and special decals. Examples include Mini Rio, Mini Park Lane, Mini Italian Job, Mini Cooper RSP, Mini Fame and Racing.

== Unproduced prototypes ==
A number of prototypes produced for vehicles based on the Mini but which never saw production are held and sometimes displayed at the British [[Heritage Motor Centre]] museum at [[Gaydon]], [[Warwickshire]]. These included the Twini, a re-engineered [[four-wheel-drive]] Moke with two engines <U+2014> one at the front and another at the back; the Austin Ant, a second attempt to produce a four-wheel-drive vehicle, this time using a [[transfer case]]; and a two-seater convertible MG edition of the Mini, cancelled due to it being perceived as competition for the [[MG Midget]].

== Exotic Minis and celebrities==

The Mini was a cultural icon and shows up in movies such as ''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969), in which 3 Mark I Austin Mini Cooper S cars are used in a gold bullion robbery; in ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'' (2002) as a beat-up but surprisingly capable vehicle for a car chase; ''[[Goodbye Pork Pie]]'' (1981) where a yellow Mini 1000 is used to travel the length of New Zealand, or in ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'' (2001) as a collectible fashion icon garaged alongside other classic sports cars. It has also featured in television shows such as ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' and (as the [[Mini Moke]]) in ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Mini also became a veritable '[[Fashion statement#Fashion and variation|fashion statement]]'. Many celebrities of that era drove Minis that had been customised by famous British [[coachbuilder]]s. Examples include [[Peter Sellers]]' [[wicker]] side-panelled Mini built by [[Hooper (coachbuilder)|Hooper]] (the [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] coachbuilder)<ref name="Rolls Royce">[http://www.rrab.com/faq.htm#q5 Rolls Royce Hooper FAQ site]</ref><ref name="Mini Library">[http://www.comp.glam.ac.uk/~minis/minilib/review10.htm The Mini Library]</ref> which appeared in his movie [[A Shot in the Dark]]. [[Ringo Starr]]'s hatchback designed by Radford, who also built a Mini de Ville for [[Britt Ekland]], Peter Sellers' wife, with a special rear estate wagon door.<ref name="Radford">[http://www.radfordmini.free-online.co.uk/history.htm History on Radford website]</ref> [[Radford]] also built Mini de Villes for [[John Lennon]], [[Marianne Faithfull]] and a [[psychedelic]] version that appeared in the [[Beatles]] movie [[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]] owned by [[George Harrison]] who maintained it through the years and had it restored, including the art, prior to making an appearance with it at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]] as late as June 1998.<ref name="Radford2">[http://www.radfordmini.free-online.co.uk/films.htm Films and celebs on Radford website]</ref>  Marianne Faithfull drove her duo-tone de Ville to the [[Royal Courts of Justice|Law Courts]] to hear [[Mick Jagger]]'s appeal of his drug conviction in 1967.<ref name="Radford2"/> The same year John Lennon drove his de Ville hatchback to [[Apple Records|Apple studios]] after hearing of [[Brian Epstein]]'s death. At around the same time, Radford also extensively customised a 1275 Mini-Cooper S for Monkee [[Michael Nesmith]] which gave dramatically improved performance combined with luxury and silence.<ref name="Radford2"/>  Coachbuilders Wood & Pickett also made special versions called the Margrave and Margrave SE,<ref name="Mini Library"/><ref name="Wood and Pickett">[http://www.woodandpickett.com/ Wood and Pickett website]</ref> sold by [[Mayfair]] dealerships in [[Mod (lifestyle)|mod]] [[London]] and elsewhere.


== Kit cars and customisation ==
[[Image:Outspan Orange.jpg|thumb|right|One of three [[Outspan]] [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]] Minis, photographed on Madeira Drive in Brighton.]]
{{main|List of Mini based cars}}
The cheapness, simplicity and easy availability of used Minis make it an ideal candidate for body replacement.  [[List of Mini based cars|There are over 120]] Mini-based [[kit car]]s from various small companies and individual enthusiasts.  There are also numerous dramatically modified Minis such as a set of three street-legal cars made up to look like giant oranges as a promotion for the [[Outspan]] company, a Mini that was made to look like a [[half-timbered]] cottage, complete with [[thatch|thatched roof]] and windows with curtains.  Some enthusiasts have drastically shortened or lowered their cars to make them yet smaller.  There is also a 'sprint shell' which has a lower roof and a small body chop, which dramatically reduces drag.  Others make small versions of [[Limousine|stretched limos]], [[double-decker bus]]ses, [[monster truck]]s, [[motor home]]s and many other kinds of vehicles from used Minis.

Years after the Mini finally ended its production run, there are still ample third-party parts <U+2013> both spares for restoration and performance parts for race tuning.<ref name="vizard1">{{cite book | author=Vizard, David   | title=How To Modify Your Mini | isbn=0-86343-041-4 }}</ref><ref name="vizard2">{{cite book | author=Vizard, David   | title=Tuning The A-Series Engine | isbn=1-85960-620-2 }}</ref><ref name="porter">{{cite book | author=Porter, Lindsay | title=Haynes Mini Restoration Manual | isbn=1-85960-440-4 }}</ref><ref name="mundy">{{cite book | author=Mundy, Tim      | title=Mini Performance Manual (Haynes Performance Manual Series) | isbn=1-85960-880-9 }}</ref><ref name="parnell3">{{cite book | author=Parnell, John | title=Original Mini-Cooper and Cooper S: The Restorers Guide | isbn=0-7603-1228-1 }}</ref>

Given the low weight and good handling of the Mini it is also popular to do an [[engine swap]] putting in a modern, high performance engine like the Rover K Series, a Honda VTEC B16A2, a Suzuki Swift GTi, a rear mounted Yamaha R1 motorbike engine, or the Vauxhall 16v 2&nbsp;litre c20 XE "red top" engine, amongst various alternatives.<ref>[http://www.16vminiclub.com/index.php www.16vminiclub.comHome Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Awards ==
The Mini has won many awards over the years, perhaps the most notable include: "Car of the Century" (''[[Autocar]]'' magazine 1995), "Number One Classic Car of All Time" (''[[Classic & Sports Car]]'' magazine 1996) and "European Car of the Century" in a worldwide [[Internet]] poll run by the prestigious [[Global Automotive Elections Foundation]] in 1999.  The Mini managed second place (behind the [[Model T Ford]]) for "Global Car of the Century" in that same poll.

In the end 5.3 million Minis were sold, making it by far the most popular British car ever made. Thousands of these are still on the road, with the remaining pre-1980s versions being firmly established as collectors' items.

[[Image:Minis of Texas Meeting Feb 2006.jpg|thumb|right|A typical meeting of the [http://www.miniownersoftexas.org Mini Owners of Texas] club in [[Grapevine, Texas|Grapevine]], [[Texas]].]]

Between 1960 and 1967, BMC exported approximately 10,000 left-hand drive BMC Minis to the United States. Sales were discontinued when stricter federal [[emission standard]]s were imposed; BMC felt that it would be too expensive to make the Mini's engine compliant. Similar legislation was later introduced in Europe, and the A-series engine, with minor modifications, proved perfectly capable of complying with it.

Despite this, a small band of enthusiasts keep the legacy of the original car alive in the US, where cars more than 25 years old are generally exempt from emissions regulations. Minis that were originally sold in the US are becoming hard to find, so most of the restored Minis now running in the US have been imported by individual enthusiasts <U+2013> typically from Australia or New Zealand where the climate has limited the amount of rust formation and cars are available for relatively low prices.  There is increasing difficulty in finding cars that are old enough to meet the 25 year emissions exemption and yet are still in a reasonable condition. This has led some importers to place the [[vehicle identification number]] (VIN) plates from older cars onto Minis that are less than 25 years old <U+2013> claiming that the car was "repaired" by replacing every single part with the exception of the VIN plate.  Such vehicles are termed "re-VINs" and are surprisingly common.<ref>[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/mini-cooper.htm howstuffworks.com]</ref>

== Popularity ==
[[Image:MINI Austin Rover.JPG|right|thumb|An Almond Green Mark I Morris Mini Minor]]
At its peak, the Mini was a strong seller in most of the countries where it was sold, with the United Kingdom inevitably receiving the highest volumes. 

It was a huge seller in the mini-car market, which it virtually monopolised until the arrival of the [[Hillman Imp]] in 1963. It comprehensively outsold the Imp, and it was 16 years before the Mini received a serious threat to its sales success. This threat came in the shape of the much more modern and practical [[Vauxhall Chevette]] of 1975, but the Mini continued to sell in huge volumes and was still very popular when its "replacement" - the [[Austin Metro|Metro]] - arrived in 1980. By this time, the Mini's design had been overtaken by numerous more modern and practical efforts, but it still offered sheer driving fun that was almost unbeatable in this size of car. 

Although the Metro never actually replaced the Mini, production figures for the Mini dipped during the 1980s, and interest in the now-iconic design was not revived until the re-introduction of the famous Mini Cooper in 1989. This helped the car retain its desirability and driver appeal throughout the 1990s, right up to the end of production on 4 October 2000.

Eight years after its demise, the Mini is still a common sight on Britain's roads, and the surviving pre-1980s models in particular are now widely regarded as collector's items.

Throughout its life, the Mini was modified in various ways to improve its safety.

A UK Department for Transport statistics publication, presenting estimates of the risk of driver injury in two car injury collisions, based on reported road accident data, estimated that the 1990&ndash;2000 Mini was one of two small cars (the other being the [[Hyundai Atoz]]), which, with an estimated 84% of drivers likely to be injured, presented the greatest risk of driver injury.  The average risk for the small car category was 76%.<ref>{{cite web

When production of the classic Mini ceased in 2000, BMW (the new owner of the brand) announced the successor to the Mini <U+2013> which is variously called the "BMW MINI" or the "New MINI".  The brand name for the new car is MINI (written in capital letters).<ref name="MiniBrand">{{cite web

Most Mini enthusiasts reject the claim that the MINI is the natural successor of the original car - many simply dislike it - yet a few were amongst the first to buy the new MINI when it was launched.<!-- uncited -->  There are many reasons offered for the negative point of view. One notion is that the classic Mini could have continued in viable production for many more years had it not been 'killed off' to make way for the MINI.<!-- uncited --> The new MINI is larger than the classic Mini.  It is around {{convert|55|cm|in}} longer, {{convert|30|cm|in}} wider, weighing {{convert|1050|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} rather than {{convert|650|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.  That, together with the departure from the spartan minimalism of the original, has proven objectionable to some enthusiasts.<!-- uncited -->  Others resent the manner in which BMW took the Mini brand name from the [[MG Rover Group|Rover group]].<!-- uncited -->  However, many Mini owners take the opposite view and embrace the new car as a logical succession of the original and view it as the only way the concept could have continued in the light of modern safety, emissions and manufacturing principles.<!-- uncited -->  Some Mini clubs go so far as to ban MINIs from their club meetings - others actively seek car enthusiasts from both camps.<!-- uncited -->  This spectrum of attitudes has been noted with other retro-car releases such as the [[Volkswagen Beetle]]<!-- uncited --> and is far from being unique to the Mini community.<!-- citation? -->

On 3 April 2007, the one millionth MINI rolled out of the Oxford Plant after six years of production,<ref><http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6525601.stm></ref> just one month longer than it took the classic Mini to reach the same total in March 1965.
