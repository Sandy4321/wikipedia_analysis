'''Ogle Winston Link'''<ref name="Ancestors">Link was named after two of his maternal ancestors : the twentieth [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[John Winston Jones]] and [[Pennsylvania]]n Representative [[Alexander Ogle]]. ''Last Railroad'' p. 132.</ref> ([[December 16]] [[1914]] &ndash; [[January 30]] [[2001]]), known commonly as '''O. Winston Link''',  was an American [[photographer]]. He is best known for his black and white photography and sound recordings of the last days of [[steam locomotive]] railroading in the [[United States]] in the 1950s and early 1960s. A commercial photographer by trade, Winston Link helped establish [[rail photography]] as a hobby. His [[night photography]] was also pioneering, and produced several very well known examples, including "Hotshot Eastbound," a photograph with steam train passing a [[Drive-in theater|drive-in movie theater]], and "Hawksbill Creek Swimming Pool, [[Luray, Virginia]]" with a train passing children swimming near a bridge.<ref name="OWL Museum site bio page 1955-8"> [http://www.linkmuseum.org/index-1.html O.

==Early life==
Link and his siblings, Eleanor and Albert Jr., spent their childhood in [[Brooklyn, New York]], where they lived with their father, Albert Sr., and their mother, Anne. Albert Link worked in the [[New York City Department of Education|New York City Public School system]], where he taught [[woodworking]]. Albert encouraged this and other skills to his children, including Winston's first introduction to photography.

Link's early photography was created with a borrowed [[medium format]] [[Autographic]] Kodak camera. By the time he was in high school Link had built his own photographic [[enlarger]]. <ref name="GarverLast132-3">''Last Railroad'' pp. 132-3.</ref><ref name="GarverMuseum3">''Museum'' p. 3</ref>

After completing high school, Link attended the [[Polytechnic University of New York|Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn]], receiving a degree in [[civil engineering]]. Prior to his graduation in 1937, Link gave a speech at banquet for the institute's newspaper, where Link served as photo editor. An executive with [[Carl Byoir]]'s public relations firm was in attendance and was much impressed with Link's manner and speaking ability, and offered Link a job as a photographer.<ref name="GarverLast136">''Last Railroad'' p. 136.</ref>

==Career==
Link worked for Carl Byoir and Associates for five years, learning his trade on the job. He adapted to the technique of making posed photographs looking candid, as well as creatively emphasizing a point. Some of Link's photographs from this time included an image of a man aiming a gun at a pig wearing a [[bulletproof vest]], and one eventually known as "What Is This Girl Selling?" or "Girl on Ice," which was widely published in the United States and later featured in [[Life (magazine)|Life magazine]] as a "classic publicity picture." According to Thomas Garver, once assistant to Link, Link's employ at Byoir's firm "clearly defined a point of view and developed working methods that were to shape his entire career."<ref name="GarverLast136-9">''Last Railroad'' pp. 136-9.</ref><ref name="GarverMuseum4">''Museum'' p. 4.</ref>

With [[World War II|war]] consuming much of the rest world and soon to reach the United States, and Link unable to join the military due to [[mumps]]-induced hearing loss, Link left Byoir's employ in 1942 to work for the Airborne Instruments Laboratory, part of [[Columbia University]]. Drawing  on both his university degree and professional photographic experience, Link worked at the laboratory as both project engineer and photographer. At the time, the laboratory was researching a device for low-flying airplanes to detect submarines underwater. Link's main responsibity was photographically documenting the project for the United States' government.<ref name="GarverMuseum5">''Museum'' p. 5.</ref><ref name="GarverLast140">''Last Railroad'' p. 140.</ref>

In 1945, with the end of the war, Link's employment at the Airborne Instruments Laboratory also ended. While Carl Byoir invited Link back, but Link decided to open his own studio instead. It opened in 1946 and his clients included [[Goodrich Corporation|B. F. Goodrich]], [[Alcoa Aluminum]], [[Texaco]], and [[Ethyl Corporation]].<ref name="GarverLast142">''Last Railroad'' p. 142.</ref>

==Later life==
In 1996, Link's second wife, Conchita, was arrested for (and subsequently convicted of) stealing a collection of Link's photographs, after she attempted to sell them, claiming that Link had [[Alzheimer's disease]] and that she had power of attorney.  She served six years in prison.  After being released, she again attempted to sell some of Link's works, that she had stolen, this time using the internet auction site [[eBay]].  She received a three year sentence. <ref name="Ex-Wifes 2nd trial"> [http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2004/05/06/NEWSconchitassentence2.html "Ex-Wife's 2nd Trial"]. [[6 May]] [[2004]].

==Museum==
The rail photography of Winston Link is featured at the O. Winston Link Museum in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] which opened in January, 2004. The museum is housed in the former passenger station of the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] (N&W), the last [[Class I railroad]] to convert from steam motive power in 1960. 
Link's work in the late 1950s was encouraged and facilitated by N&W officials, whose company had long built its own locomotives in the [[Roanoke Shops]] and had refined use of steam locomotives in earning it reputation for "precision transportation." 

Adjacent to the O.W. Link Museum on Roanoke is the [[Virginia Museum of Transportation]]  which includes a special pavilion constructed to house the static display of the Norfolk & Western J-611 and A-1218 steam locomotives which were operated in excursion service in the 1980s and early 1990s.

==In popular culture== 
*Link made a [[cameo appearance]] as a steam locomotive engineer in the 1999 film ''[[October Sky]]''.
* One of Link's photographs, "Hotshot Eastbound," portrayed a night scene of a steam locomotive passing adjacent to a drive-in movie theater, with cars parked inside and an airplane on the screen.  This scene was duplicated in "[[Dumbbell Indemnity]]", an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref name="Simpsons">[http://www.atomicdeathray.com/?p=442 Visual comparison between "Hotshot Eastbound" and ''The Simpsons'' scene]</ref>
