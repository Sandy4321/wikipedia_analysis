"'''Hell Is Other Robots'''" is the ninth episode of season one of ''[[Futurama]]''.  It originally aired in North America on [[May 18]], [[1999]] as the season finale of the first season. The episode was written by [[Eric Kaplan]] and directed by [[Rich Moore]]. Guest stars in this episode include [[The Beastie Boys]] as themselves and [[Dan Castellaneta]] voicing the Robot Devil. The episode is one of the first to focus heavily on [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] as he develops an addiction to electricity.  When this addiction becomes problematic, Bender joins the Temple of [[Religion in Futurama#Robotology|Robotology]]; however, after [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] and [[Turanga Leela|Leela]] successfully tempt Bender with [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[prostitution|prostitutes]], he quits the Temple of Robotology, but receives a visit from the Robot Devil for sinning. When Fry and Leela come to rescue him, the three escape safely. 

The episode introduces [[List of recurring robot characters from Futurama#The Robot Devil|the Robot Devil]], [[List of recurring robot characters from Futurama#Reverend Preacherbot|Reverend Lionel Preacherbot]] and the religion the Temple of Robotology, a ''Futurama'' spoof on the [[Church of Scientology]]. The episode received positive reviews, and was one of four featured on the [[DVD]] boxed set of Matt Groening's favorite episodes: ''Monster Robot Maniac Fun Collection''.

== Plot ==
Bender returns from a Beastie Boys concert and proceeds to attend a party with his old friend, Fender. At the party, robots are abusing electricity by "jacking on" and Bender develops an addiction. After getting an almost lethal dose from an electrical disturbance, Bender realizes he has a problem and searches for help. He joins the Temple of Robotology where he accepts the doctrine of the pain of eternal damnation in Robot Hell should he sin. After [[Baptism|baptizing]] him in oil, the Reverend Lionel Preacherbot welds the symbol of Robotology to Bender's case.

As Bender begins to annoy his coworkers with his new religion, Fry and Leela decide they want the old Bender back. They fake a delivery to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] and tempt Bender with alcohol, prostitutes, and easy targets for theft. He eventually succumbs, rips off the Robotology symbol and throws it away, causing it to beep ominously.

While seducing three female robots Bender is interrupted by a knock at his hotel room door. He opens the door and is knocked unconscious. He awakens to see the Robot Devil and finds himself in Robot Hell. The Robot Devil informs Bender that he agreed to be punished for sinning when he joined Robotology. After discovering Bender is missing, Fry and Leela attempt to track him down using [[Nibbler (Futurama)|Nibbler's]] sense of smell. Eventually, they arrive at an abandoned [[New Jersey]] amusement park where they find the entrance to Robot Hell.

A musical number starts as the Robot Devil begins detailing Bender's punishment. As the song ends, Fry and Leela arrive and try to reason with the Robot Devil on Bender's behalf. The Robot Devil tells them that the only way to win back Bender's soul is to beat him in a musical contest using a solid gold fiddle. After a few notes it is clear Leela's fiddle playing is pathetic, so she uses it to beat the Robot Devil instead. As the three flee the Robot Devil's clutches Bender steals the wings off a flying torture robot, attaches them to his back and airlifts Fry and Leela to safety. Leela drops the heavy golden fiddle onto the Robot Devil's head, making them light enough to successfully escape. Bender promises to never be too good or too evil but to remain as he was before joining the Temple of Robotology.<ref name="Episode">{{cite video|year=1999|title=Plot synopsis information for ''Futurama'' episode "Hell Is Other Robots"| medium=DVD|}}</ref>

==Themes==
This episode is one of very few that focuses on the religious aspects of the ''Futurama'' universe. In most episodes, it is indicated that the Planet Express crew, along with most beings in the year 3000, are "remarkably unreligious".<ref name="Gospel">{{cite book |last=Pinsky |first=Mark |title=The Gospel According to the Simpsons.

Preacherbot, who speaks in a manner typical of inner-city African-American pastor stereotypes, converts Bender to the religion Robotology.<ref name="Gospel" />  This leads to a series of events that are similar in many ways to the experiences of real world religious converts.<ref name="Gospel" />  Mark Pinsky states that the episode has a "double-edged portrayal of religion" as it portrays both an improvement in Bender's character but also some of the "less pleasant characteristics of the newly pious".<ref name="Gospel" />  The Robot Devil is introduced after Bender's fall back into sin.<ref name="Gospel" />  While explaining to Bender his claim on his soul, he uses logic similar to that used by many [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptists]].<ref name="Gospel" />  By the end of the episode Bender has returned to his old ways and states that he will no longer try to be either too good or too bad, a parody and contradiction of the [[Book of Revelation]] statement that one should not be lukewarm in their faith.<ref name="Gospel" />

This episode contains a large amount of religious parody and thus references numerous works of fiction which have a religious focus.  The title of the episode is a comedic pun of the famous line "Hell is other people" from [[Jean Paul Sartre]]'s one act play ''[[No Exit]]'', although the episode has little to do with the actual play.<ref name="Gospel" /><ref name="Drawn To TV" />  The punishments in Robot Hell are similar to the levels and rationale which are portrayed in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', specifically the [[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]].<ref name="Gospel" />  The "Fairness in Hell Act," wherein one must engage in a fiddle battle to save their soul is taken directly from [[The Charlie Daniels Band]] song "[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]."<ref name="Gospel" />  The jokes poking fun at New Jersey in the episode are due to the fact that writer David X. Cohen and actor John DiMaggio both grew up in the Garden State.<ref name="keller" />

The Temple of Robotology is a spoof of the [[Church of Scientology]],<ref name="gospel01">{{cite book |last=Pinsky |first=Mark |title=The Gospel According to the Simpsons |year=2001 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |isbn=0-664-22419-9 |pages=pp. 158<U+2013>159}}</ref><ref name="Drawn To TV" /> and according to series creator Matt Groening he received a call from the Church of Scientology concerned about the use of a similar name.<ref name="groening">{{cite video| people=[[Matt Groening|Groening, Matt]]|year=2003|title=[[Futurama]] season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Hell Is Other Robots"| medium=[[DVD]] |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]}}</ref>  Groening's ''[[The Simpsons]]'' had previously parodied elements of [[Scientology]], in the [[The Simpsons (Season 9)|Season 9]] episode "[[The Joy of Sect]]".<ref name="Mirkin">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David |year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 9 DVD commentary for the episode "The Joy of Sect"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name="turner">{{cite book | last = Turner | first = Chris | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = [[Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation]] | publisher = Da Capo Press |date=2005 | page = p. 269, The First Church of ''The Simpsons''  | isbn = 030681448X}}</ref>  In a review of the episode, ''TV Squad'' later posed the question: "Is the Temple of Robotology a poke at the Church of Scientology?"<ref name="keller" />  When ''TV Squad'' asked actor [[Billy West]] about this, he jokingly sidestepped the issue.<ref name="keller" />
