Locomotive '''5917''' is a two-cylinder, simple, non-condensing, superheated, coal-fired, 2-8-2 <U+2018>Mikado' steam locomotive and one of five [[New South Wales D59 class locomotive|D59 class]] [[locomotive]]s that were preserved.

==In Service==
Locomotive '''5917''' was built in the USA by [[Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corporation]] in 1953 and came into service in Australia on 12 March 1953. The Loco was originally built as an oil burning locomotive which was the NSWGRs original plan when it was submitted to the builders during the Coal shortage in New South Wales. It was later converted to a Coal burner. 5917 was used for freight haulage during its NSWGR service right up to its withdrawal.

==Demise and Preservation==
On 16 August 1972 the locomotive was withdrawn from service.<ref><U+00B0>ARHS Digest September 1972</ref> and stored at Enfield for storage.  5917 was stored in the open on the east side of Enfield No 3 turntable, until mid 1974, when it was moved into Enfield No 1 Shed for preliminary work following purchase by a syndicate of enthusiasts.

Ownership passed to the '5917 Society' being operated and maintain by the [[Lachlan Valley Railway]]. It was moved out of storage at Enfield on 22 October 1974, when it hauled 3046 and 3090TS to the Rhonda Colliery site of the (then) Hunter Valley Steam Railway and Museum.  During 1976, 5917 steamed to Peterborough SA, for an important anniversary there.  In January 1978, 5917 was used on Festival Of Sydney trains to Kiama.  The Loco was leased to [[3801 Limited]] for some steam tours during 2008-2009. 5917 was taken out of service during April 2009 where major boiler work and running repairs commenced on the locomotive at Eveleigh workshops. A steam test was held at Eveleigh in November 2013 saw the locomotive passed a steam test and boiler inspection and is anticipated to return to service for the LVR early 2014. 5917 returned to service on 5 April 2014 for a private charter following a successful trial early hours of Friday 4 April 2014.
