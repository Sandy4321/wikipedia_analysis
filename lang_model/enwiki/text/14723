}}
The '''hawksbill turtle''' ('''''Eretmochelys imbricata''''') is a [[critically endangered]] [[sea turtle]] belonging to the family [[Cheloniidae]]. It is the only species in its [[genus]]. The species itself has a worldwide distribution, but the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific]] populations are divided into two [[subspecies]]. ''Eretmochelys imbricata imbricata'' is the subspecies that includes the Atlantic hawksbill turtle populations and the subspecies ''Eretmochelys imbricata bissa'' refers to the collective population of hawksbill turtles found in the Pacific Ocean.<ref name="ITIS">{{ITIS|ID=173836|taxon=Eretmochelys imbricata|year=2007|date=05 February}}</ref>

The hawksbill's appearance is similar to that of other marine turtles. It has a generally flattened body shape, a protective [[Carapace#Turtles and tortoises|carapace]], and its [[flipper]]-like arms are adapted for swimming in the open ocean. ''E. imbricata'' is easily distinguished from other sea turtles by its sharp, curving [[beak]] with prominent [[tomium]], and the [[serration|saw-like]] appearance of its shell margins.  While the turtle lives a part of its life in the open ocean, it is most often encountered in shallow lagoons and [[coral reef]]s where it feeds on its chosen prey, [[sea sponges]]. Some of the sponges eaten by ''E. imbricata'' are known to be highly toxic and lethal when eaten by other organisms. In addition, the sponges that hawksbills eat are usually those with high [[silica]] content, making the turtles one of few animals capable of eating siliceous organisms. They also feed on other [[invertebrates]], such as [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]] and [[jellyfish]].<ref name="VDGIF"/>

Because of human fishing practices, ''Eretmochelys imbricata'' populations around the world are threatened with [[extinction]] and the turtle has been classified as [[critically endangered]] by the [[IUCN|World Conservation Union]].<ref name="IUCN"/> Several countries, such as [[China]] and [[Japan]], have valued hunting hawksbill turtles for their flesh, which is considered good eating. Hawksbill turtle shells, the primary source of ''tortoise shell'', is used for decorative purposes. By the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]], it is illegal to capture and to trade in hawksbill turtles and products derived from them in many nations.<ref name="CITESAPP"/>

==Anatomy and morphology==
[[Image:Hawksbill turtle doeppne-108.jpg|thumb|right|A young hawksbill in a [[Papua New Guinea]] reef. The carapace's serrated margin is evident in this individual.]]
''Eretmochelys imbricata'' has the typical appearance of a marine turtle. Like the other members of its family, it has a depressed body form and [[Flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]-like limbs adapted for swimming. Adult hawksbill turtles have been known to grow up to a meter in length, weighing around 80&nbsp;kilograms on average. The heaviest hawksbill ever captured was measured to be 127&nbsp;kilograms.<ref name="VDGIF">{{cite web | title =Species Booklet: Hawksbill sea turtle | work =Virginia Fish and Wildlife Information Service | publisher =Virginia Department of Game & Inland Fisheries | date = | url =http://www.dgif.state.va.us/wildlife/species/display.asp?id=030073 | accessdate = 2007-02-06}}</ref> The turtle's shell, or [[Carapace#Turtles and tortoises|carapace]], has an amber background patterned with an irregular combination of light and dark streaks, with predominantly black and mottled brown colors radiating to the sides.<ref name="ARKive">{{cite web  | title =Hawksbill turtle - Eretmochelys imbricata: More information  | work =  | publisher =Wildscreen  | date =  | url =http://www.arkive.org/species/GES/reptiles/Eretmochelys_imbricata/more_info.html  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 }}</ref>

The hawksbill turtle has several characteristics that distinguish it from other, closely-related species. Its elongated, tapered head ends in a [[beak]]-like mouth (from which its common name is derived), its beak more sharply pronounced and hooked than other sea turtles. The hawksbill's arms have two visible claws on each flipper.

[[Image:Hawksbill turtle doeppne-081.jpg|thumb|left|A close-up of the hawksbill's distinct beak.]]
One of the hawksbill's more-easily distinguished characteristics is the pattern of the thick [[scutes]] that make up its carapace. While its carapace has five central scutes and four pairs of [[Anatomical terms of location#Relative directions|lateral]] scutes like several members of the same family, ''E. imbricata'''s [[Anatomical terms of location#Directions: human anatomy|posterior]] scutes overlap in such a way as to give the rear margin of its carapace a [[serration|serrated]] look, similar to the edge of a saw or a steak knife. The turtle's carapace itself has been known to reach almost a meter in length.<ref name="MarineBio">{{cite web  | title =Eretmochelys imbricata, Hawksbill Sea Turtle  | work =  | publisher =MarineBio.org  | url =http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=164  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 }}</ref>

The sand tracks of hawksbill turtles are asymmetrical, as they crawl on land with an alternating gait. This is opposed to the [[green sea turtle]] and the [[leatherback turtle]], which crawl rather symmetrically.<ref name="TurtleOrg">{{cite web  | title =The Hawksbill Turtle (''Eretmochelys imbricata'')| work =  | publisher =turtles.org  | url =http://www.turtles.org/hawksd.htm| accessdate = 2007-02-22 }}</ref><ref name="SeychellesTurtles">{{cite web  | title =Hawksbill | work =SeychellesTurtles.org - Strategic Management of Turtles | publisher =Marine Conservation Society, Seychelles  | url =http://www.seychellesturtles.org/species/hawksbill.html  | accessdate = 2007-02-22 }}</ref>

==Distribution==
Hawksbill turtles have a wide range, found predominantly in tropical reefs of the [[indian ocean|Indian]], [[Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] oceans. Of all the sea turtle species, ''E. imbricata'' is the one most associated with tropical waters.<ref name="FIGIS">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title =Species Fact Sheet: ''Eretmochelys  imbricata'' (Linnaeus, 1766) | work =FIGIS - Fisheries Global Information System

===Indo-Pacific subpopulation===
The species' Indo-Pacific population is widespread throughout the entire region. In the [[Indian Ocean]], hawksbills are a common sight all along the east coast of the African continent, including the seas surrounding [[Madagascar]] and nearby island groups. The species' Indian Ocean range stretches all the way along the coast of [[Asia]], including the [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Red Sea]], along the entire coast of the [[Indian subcontinent]], across the entire [[Indonesian archipelago]] and the northwestern coast of [[Australia]]. The [[Pacific]] range of ''E. imbricata'' is somewhat limited to the ocean's tropical and subtropical regions. Its northernmost reach in the region are the waters off the southwestern tip of the [[Korean peninsula]] and the [[Japanese archipelago]]. The range continues, enveloping the entire region of [[Southeast Asia]], the entire northern coast of Australia all the way south to the northern part of [[New Zealand]]. Across the Pacific, hawksbills are known as far north as the [[Baja peninsula]] in [[Mexico]], along the waters off the Central American and South American coast to the northern tip of [[Chile]].<ref name="FIGIS"/>

==Ecology and life history==
=== Habitat ===
Adult hawksbill turtles are primarily found in tropical [[coral reef]]s. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges in and around these reefs, throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, they have also been encountered in a wide range of habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries.<ref name="MarineBio"/><ref name="Lutz1997">{{cite book  | last =Lutz  | first =P.

While they are known to be omnivorous, the principal food of hawkbill turtles are [[Porifera|sponges]]. Sponges constitute 70<U+2013>95% of the diets of ''E. imbricata'' populations in the [[Caribbean]]. However like many [[spongivore]]s, ''E. imbricata'' feed only on a few select species, and will ignore many others. The Caribbean hawksbill populations were found to feed primarily on sponges from the class [[Demospongiae]], specifically ones belonging to the orders [[Astrophorida]], [[Spirophorida]] and [[Hadromerida]].<ref name="ScienceSpongi">{{cite journal | last =Meylan | first =Anne | authorlink =Anne Meylan | title =Spongivory in Hawksbill Turtles: A Diet of Glass | journal =Science | volume =239 | issue =4838 | pages =393<U+2013>395 | publisher =American Association for the Advancement of Science | date =[[1988-01-12]]  | url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0036-8075%2819880122%293%3A239%3A4838%3C393%3ASIHTAD%3E2.0.CO%3B2-H
  | doi = | id = | accessdate = 2007-02-15 }}</ref> Select sponge species known to be fed on by these turtles include ''[[Geodia gibberosa]]''.<ref name="VDGIF"/> Aside from sponges, hawksbills also feed on algae and [[cnidaria]]ns like [[jellyfish]] and [[sea anemones]].<ref name="MarineBio"/> The hawksbill is also known to feed on the dangerous jellyfish-like [[hydrozoan]], the [[Portuguese Man o' War]] (''[[Physalia physalis]]''). Hawksbills close their unprotected eyes when they feed on these cnidarians, for Man o' War's [[nematocyst|stinging cells]] cannot penetrate the turtles' armoured heads.<ref name="VDGIF"/>

<br/>
''Eretmochelys imbricata'' have shown themselves to be highly resilient and resistant to their prey. Some of the sponges known to be eaten by hawksbills, such as ''[[Aaptos aaptos]]'', ''[[Chondrilla nucula]]'', ''[[Tethya actinia]]'', ''[[Spheciospongia vesparum]]'' and ''[[Suberites domuncula]]'', are highly (often lethally) [[toxic]] to other organisms. In addition, hawksbills are known to choose sponge species that have a significant amount of [[siliceous]] [[spicules]], such as ''[[Ancorina]]'', ''[[Geodia]]'', ''[[Ecionemia]]'' and ''[[Placospongia]]''.<ref name="ScienceSpongi"/>

Mating season for Atlantic hawksbills usually takes place from April to November. For Indian Ocean populations such as the [[Seychelles]] hawksbill population, the mating season is from September to February.<ref name="SeychellesTurtles"/> As with other sea turtles, hawksbills mate in shallow lagoons off the shores of their prospective nesting beaches. After mating, the females drag their heavy bodies high onto the beach during the night. They will then clear out an area and dig a nesting hole using their rear flippers. The female then lays a [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] of eggs in the nest and then covers them with sand. [[Caribbean]] and [[Florida]] nests of ''E. imbricata'' normally contain around 140 eggs. After the several-hour-long process, the female then returns to the sea. This is the only time when hawksbill turtles are known to leave the ocean.<ref name="MarineBio"/><ref name="FWS"/>

The baby turtles, usually weighing less than two dozen grams, hatch during the night after around two months. These newly-emergent [[hatchling]]s are darkly-colored, with heart-shaped carapaces measuring around 2.5 centimeters (1 in) long. They instinctually head for the sea, attracted by the reflection of the moon on the water (a mechanism which can be disrupted by [[anthropogenic]] light sources such as street lamps and lights). While they emerge under the cover of darkness, baby turtles that do not reach the water by daybreak are preyed upon by predators such as [[shorebirds]] and [[Grapsidae|shore crabs]].<ref name="MarineBio"/>

[[Image:HawksbillHatchling.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|240px|left|''E. imbricata'' hatchling in [[Grenada]].]]
The early [[life history]] of juvenile hawksbill turtles is unknown. Upon reaching the sea, the hatchlings are assumed to enter a [[pelagic]] life stage (like other [[sea turtles|marine turtles]]) for an undetermined amount of time. While hawksbill turtle growth rates are not known, when ''E. imbricata'' juveniles reach around 35 cm, they switch from a pelagic life style to a coral reef-associated one. Hawksbill turtles are hypothesized to reach maturity after thirty years.<ref name="FWS"/>

While there is no clear consensus because of a lack of data, hawksbill turtles are believed to live from thirty to fifty years in the wild.<ref name="NewYork">{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Atlantic Hawksbill Sea Turtle Fact Sheet  | work =  | publisher =New York State Department of Environmental Conservation  | date =2003  | url =http://www.dec.state.ny.us/website/dfwmr/wildlife/endspec/athafs.html  | accessdate = 2007-02-05}}</ref> Like other sea turtles, hawksbill turtles are solitary for most of their lives, they only group together to mate. They were once thought to be habitual, but they are now known to be highly [[migratory]].<ref name="ADW"/> Because of their tough [[carapace#Turtles and tortoises|carapaces]], hawksbill turtles have no major predators as there are few creatures that are capable of biting through their protective shell. [[Shark]]s and [[Crocodylus porosus|estuarine crocodiles]] are a few of their natural predators. [[Octopus]]es and some species of pelagic fish have also been known to prey on the adult turtles.<ref name="ADW"/>

==Evolutionary history==
Within the sea turtles, ''Eretmochelys imbricata'' has several unique [[anatomical]] and [[ecological]] traits, including being the only primarily [[spongivorous]] reptle known. Because of this, its evolutionary position has been somewhat unclear. Molecular analyses supports the probability that the Eretmochelydae evolved from carnivorous ancestors rather than herbivorous ones. As the [[Tribe (biology)|taxonomic tribe]] [[Caretta|Carettini]] is composed of [[carnivorous]] species (such as the [[loggerhead turtle]]), the hawksbill most probably evolved from them instead of the [[herbivorous]] [[Chelonia|Chelonini]], which includes the [[green sea turtle|green turtle]].<ref name="MolecularPhylogeny">{{cite journal | last =Bowen | first =Brian W. | authorlink =Brian Bowen | coauthors =William S.

==Etymology and taxonomic history==
[[Image:Haeckel Chelonia.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|250px|right|Hawksbill turtle (top right) in a 1904 plate by [[Ernst Haeckel]].]]
The hawksbill turtle was originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] as ''Testudo imbricata'' in 1766.<ref name="ITIS">{{ITIS|ID=208664|taxon=Testudo imbricata|year=2007|date=05 February}}</ref> It was moved into the genus ''Eretmochelys'' by the Austrian zoologist [[Leopold Fitzinger]] in 1843.<ref name="ITISE">{{ITIS|ID=173835 |taxon=Eretmochelys|year=2007|date=05 February}}</ref> In 1857, the species was redescribed as ''Eretmochelys imbricata squamata'', a designation that is now invalid.<ref name="ITISEIS">{{ITIS|ID=208665 |taxon=Eretmochelys imbricata squamata|year=2007|date=05 February}}</ref>

There are two accepted [[subspecies]] in the ''E. imbricata'' [[taxon]]. ''Eretmochelys imbricata bissa''<small> ([[Eduard R<U+00FC>ppell|R<U+00FC>ppell]], [[1835]])</small> refers to all known populations of the ''Eretmochelys imbricata'' that reside in the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name="ITISEIB">{{ITIS|ID=208666 |taxon=Eretmochelys imbricata bissa|year=2007|date=05 February}}</ref> The [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] population has been found to be a separate subspecies, ''Eretmochelys imbricata imbricata''<small> ([[Linnaeus]], [[1766]])</small>. The subspecies name of ''imbricata'' was retained because the [[Type (zoology)|type specimen]] that Linnaeus used to initially describe the species was from the Atlantic.<ref name="ITISEII">{{ITIS|ID=173836|taxon=Eretmochelys imbricata imbricata|year=2007|date=05 February}}</ref>

[[Leopold Fitzinger|Fitzinger]] derived the genus' name, ''Eretmochelys'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] roots ''eretmo'' and ''chelys'', corresponding to "[[oar]]" and "turtle" respectively. The name refers to the turtles' oar-like front flippers. The species' name ''imbricata'' is [[Latin language|Latin]], corresponding to the English term [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/imbricate imbricate]. This appropriately describes the turtles' overlapping posterior scutes. The Pacific hawksbill's subspecies name, ''bissa'' is Latin for "double". The subspecies was originally described as ''Caretta bissa'' and the term referred to the then-species' being the second species in the genus.<ref name="EBeltz">{{cite web | last =Beltz | first =Ellin | authorlink =Ellin Beltz | title =Translations and Original Descriptions: Turtles | work =Scientific and Common Names of the Reptiles and Amphibians of North America - Explained | publisher =ebeltz.net | date = | url =http://ebeltz.net/herps/etymain.html#Turtles | accessdate = 2007-02-06 }}</ref> ''[[Caretta]]'' is the genus of the hawksbill's much larger relative, the [[loggerhead turtle]].

As far back as the fifth century B.C., sea turtles including the hawksbill were eaten as delicacies in [[China]].<ref name="EatingTurtlesChina">{{cite journal | last =Schafer | first =Edward H. | authorlink =Edward Schafer | title =Eating Turtles in Ancient China | journal =Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume =82 | issue =1 | pages =73<U+2013>74 | publisher =American Oriental Society | date =1962 | url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-0279%28196201%2F03%2982%3A1%3C73%3AETIAC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-R | doi = | id = | accessdate = 2007-02-16 }}</ref> 

Many cultures also use the turtles' shells for decoration. In China where it was known as ''tai mei'', it is called the ''tortoise-shell turtle'', named primarily for its [[tortoiseshell material|shell]] which was used for decoration.<ref name="EatingTurtlesChina"/> In [[Japan]], the turtles are also harvested for their shell [[scutes]], which are called ''bekko'' in the local [[Nihongo]]. It is used in various personal implements, such as eyeglass frames. In 1994, Japan stopped importing hawksbill shells from other nations. Prior to this, the Japanese hawksbill shell trade was around 30,000 kilograms of raw shells per year.<ref name="FisheriesModel">{{cite journal | last =Heppel | first =Selina S. | authorlink =Selina Heppel | coauthors =Larry B.

==Conservation==
General consensus has determined sea turtles, including ''Eretmochelys imbricata'' to be at the very least, threatened species because of their long lifespans, slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles have been killed by humans both deliberately and incidentally. In addition, the nesting sites of the turtles are also threatened by human and animal encroachment. Small mammals have been known to raid the nesting sites and dig up the turtles' eggs.<ref name="MarineBio"/> In the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], ''Eretmochelys imbricata'' nests (along with the nests of other sea turtles like ''[[Dermochelys coriacea]]'') are often raided by [[mongoose]]s right after being laid.<ref name="MongoosePredation">{{cite journal | last =Nellis | first =David W. | authorlink =David Nellis | coauthors =Vonnie Small | title =Mongoose Predation on Sea Turtle Eggs and Nests | journal =Biotropica | volume =15 | issue =2 | pages =159<U+2013>160 | publisher =The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation | date =1983 | url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0006-3606%28198306%2915%3A2%3C159%3AMPOSTE%3E2.0.CO%3B2-N | doi =  | id =  | accessdate = 2007-02-16 }}</ref>

In 1996, the [[IUCN Red List]] of Threatened Species classified ''Eretmochelys imbricata'' as [[Critically endangered species|critically endangered]].<ref name="IUCN">{{IUCN2006|assessors= Red List Standards & Petitions Subcommittee|year=1996|id=8005||title=Eretmochelys imbricata|downloaded=[[February 05]], [[2007]]}}</ref> Its status as an [[endangered species]] was challenged prior to this, with two petitions claiming that the turtle (along with three other species) had several significant stable populations worldwide. These petitions were rejected by the IUCN based on their analysis of data submitted by the [[Marine Turtle Specialist Group]] (MTSG). The data given by the MTSG showed that the worldwide population of hawksbill turtles had been reduced by 80% in the last three of the species' generations, and that was no significant increase in the turtles' populations as of 1996. In light of this data, the IUCN applied the ''critically endangered'' (A1) status upon the species. CR A2 status was denied however, because the IUCN believed that there was insufficient data to show that the population of hawksbill turtles were due to decrease by a further 80% in the future.<ref name="IUCNPetition">{{cite web  | author=Red List Standards & Petitions Subcommittee  | authorlink =IUCN  | title =Ruling of the IUCN Red List Standards and Petitions Subcommittee on Petitions against the 1996 Listings of Four Marine Turtle Species, 18 October 2001  | work =  | publisher =International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources  | date =[[2001-10-18]]  | url =http://app.iucn.org/webfiles/doc/SSC/RedList/MarineTurtleDecisions_18_Oct_01.pdf  | format =PDF  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 }}</ref>

Historically, ''Eretmochelys imbricata'' was first listed as [[endangered species|endangered]] by the IUCN in 1982.<ref name="IUCNGroombridge1982">{{cite book | last =Groombridge | first =B. | authorlink = | title =The IUCN Amphibia-Reptilia Red Data Book, Part 1: Testudines, Crocodylia, Rhynocehapalia | publisher =IUCN | date =1982 | location =Gland, Switzerland | pages = }}</ref> This endangered status continued all the way through several reassessments in 1986,<ref name="IUCN1986">{{cite book | author = IUCN Conservation Monitoring Centre | authorlink =IUCN | title =1986 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals | publisher =IUCN | date =1986 | location =Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK }}</ref> 1988,<ref name="IUCN1988">{{cite book | author = IUCN Conservation Monitoring Centre | authorlink =IUCN | title =1988 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals | publisher =IUCN | date =1988 | location =Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK }}</ref> 1990<ref name="IUCN1990">{{cite book| author = IUCN  | authorlink =IUCN  | title =1990 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals  | publisher =IUCN  | date =1990  | location =Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK.}}</ref> and 1994<ref name="IUCN1994">{{cite book | last =Groombridge | first =B. | authorlink = | title =1994 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals | publisher =IUCN | date =1994 | location =Gland, Switzerland}}</ref> until it was upgraded in status to ''critically endangered'' in 1996 (see above).

The species (along with the entire family '''[[Cheloniidae]]''') has been listed on Appendix I of the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]].<ref name="CITESAPP">{{cite web| author=CITES | authorlink =CITES | title =Appendices | work = | publisher =Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna | date =[[2006-06-14]] | url =http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.shtml | format =SHTML | accessdate = 2007-02-05 }}</ref> It is illegal to import or export turtle products, kill, capture or harass hawksbill turtles.<ref name="CITES">{{cite web| author=UNEP-WCMC| authorlink =UNEP-WCMC  | title =Eretmochelys imbricata  | work =UNEP-WCMC Species Database: CITES-Listed Species  | publisher =United Nations Environment Programme - World Conservation Monitoring Centre | date = | url =http://sea.unep-wcmc.org/isdb/CITES/Taxonomy/tax-species-result.cfm?displaylanguage=eng&Genus=Eretmochelys&Species=imbricata&source=animals&Country=&tabname=all

Local involvement in the conservation efforts for the species have also increased in the past few years. The [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] has classified the hawksbill turtle as endangered since 1970. The U.S. government has several recovery plans in place for protecting its populations of ''E. imbricata''.<ref name="USFWS">{{cite web  | authorlink =  | author =  | title = Species Profile: Hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata)  | work =USFWS Threatened and Endangered Species System (TESS)  | publisher =United States Fish and Wildlife Service  | date = [[1970-06-02]]  | url =http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/SpeciesReport.do?spcode=C00E  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 }}</ref>
