'''Alexander Barrass''' (c1856<U+2013>1929) was a 19th century [[County Durham]] born poet and songwriter

== His life ==
Alexander Barrass was born near Blackhall Mill, between [[Consett]] and [[Stanley, County Durham|Stanley]] in  [[County Durham]] in 1856, and like many youngsters in [[North East England]], started work in the mining industry, in his case at the age of 9 years old.<br/ >
He was an educated man, and bearing in mind his circumstances, possibly self educated. There is a story, although unsubstantiated, that he went into journalism, <br/ >
His first published works were in a volume <U+201C>[[River Derwent, North East England|The Derwent Valley]] and other poems<U+201D> which included songs and poetry. He also wrote a column in the Newcastle Chronicle. <br/ >
His main works were in the form of a play/musical offering called <U+201C>The Pitman's Social Neet<ref>{{cite web|title=Farne Folk Archives (page 1 of 24 pages)|url=http://www.asaplive.com/archive/detail.asp?id=L0200000}}</ref><U+201D> which told a story in song of a night out, and written in a fine [[Geordie dialect words|dialect]] style. <br/ >
His promising career was cut short when he suffered some kind of mental breakdown c1894 and was subsequently admitted to [[Winterton Hospital|Sedgefield Asylum]] for 35 years where he remained for almost 35 years until his death in 1929.

== The Pitman's social neet ==
Is a volume of over eighty pages printed in 1897 by J Dent at the Derwent Press, Victoria Street, [[Consett]]. <br/ >
The play looks back at the harsh and sometimes primitive conditions endured by the manual workers, particularly in the mining industry in the 19th century. It is set in a public house in Stanley where every part is that of someone either working in or connected with the local pit.
