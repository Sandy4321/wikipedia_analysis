'''''Devil May Cry''''' (frequently abbreviated as '''''DMC''''') is an [[action game]] [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Capcom|Capcom Production Studio 4]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by Capcom in 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]]. Although the first game in the ''[[Devil May Cry (series)|Devil May Cry]]'' series, the events in the game are second in the series storyline's chronological order, taking place after events in ''[[Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening]]'', and before ''[[Devil May Cry 2]]'' and ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]''.

Set in modern times on the fictional Mallet Island, the story centers on the characters [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] and [[Characters in Devil May Cry#Trish|Trish]] and their quest to confront the demon lord [[Characters in Devil May Cry#Mundus|Mundus]]. The story is told primarily through a mixture of [[cutscene]]s, which use the [[game engine|game's engine]] and several [[pre-rendered]] [[full motion video]]s.

''Devil May Cry'' received prominent coverage in the video game media, high overall scores from professional reviewers, and has sold more than two million copies.<ref name="devilmaycry">{{cite web | url=http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=4737 | title=Matt<U+2019>s Somewhat Serious Bit | accessdate=2008-07-20 | date=2006-06-09 | author=Matt Keller | publisher=Palgn}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The gameplay consists of [[Level (computer and video games)|levels]] called "missions", where players must fight numerous enemies, perform [[Platform game|platforming]] tasks, and occasionally solve [[Computer puzzle game|puzzles]] to progress through the story. The player's performance in each mission is given a letter grade of A, B, C, or D, with an additional top grade of S. Grades are based on the time taken to complete the mission, the amount of "red orbs" gathered (the in-game currency obtained from defeated enemies), how "stylish" their combat was, item usage, and damage taken.<ref name="booklet">{{cite book|title = Devil May Cry Instruction Booklet|publisher = [[Capcom]]| year = 2001}}</ref>

"Stylish" combat is defined as performing an unbroken series of attacks while avoiding damage, with player performance tracked by an on-screen gauge. The more hits the player makes, the higher the gauge rises. The gauge starts at "Dull"; progresses through "Cool", "Bravo", and "Awesome"; and peaks at "Stylish". The gauge terms are similar to the grades you get at the end of the missions.  When the character receives damage, the style rating resets back to "Dull". Players can also maintain their style grade by taunting enemies at close range.<ref name="booklet"/> These combat mechanics are used for most of the game, with three areas that are exceptions. The first is an underwater [[first-person shooter]] area, where the player battles enemies with a needle gun. Secondly, during the final [[boss (video games)|boss]] battle, the gameplay switches to a [[Shoot_%27em_up#Rail_shooter|rail shooter]]-type environment, and finally a similar rail-shooter level is used for the character's escape from the island by airplane.

The player can temporarily [[Henshin|transform]] the character into a more powerful demonic creature by using the "Devil Trigger" ability. Doing so adds powers based on the current weapon and changes the character's appearance. The transformations typically increase strength and defense, slowly restore health, and grant special attacks. It is governed by the Devil Trigger gauge, which depletes as the ability is used, and is refilled by attacking enemies or taunting in normal form.<ref name="booklet"/>

''Devil May Cry'' contains puzzles and other challenges besides regular combat. The main storyline often requires the player to find key items to advance, in a manner similar to puzzles in the ''[[Resident Evil (video game)|Resident Evil]]'' games, as well as optional platforming and exploration tasks to find hidden caches of "orbs". [[Quest (gaming)#Side-quest|Side quests]], called "Secret Missions" in the game, are located in hidden or out-of-the-way areas and are not required for completion, but provide permanent [[power-ups]]. They typically challenge the player to defeat a group of enemies in a specific manner or within a time limit. Rewards for all optional puzzles and challenges come in different types of "orbs" which give bonuses such as allowing the player to purchase power-ups, extend the Devil Trigger ability, or boost total health.

==Plot==
{{see also|Characters in Devil May Cry}}
''Devil May Cry'' begins with Dante being attacked in his office by a mysterious woman named [[Characters in Devil May Cry#Trish|Trish]]. He impresses her by easily brushing off her assault, and tells her that he hunts demons in pursuit of those who killed his mother and brother.<ref>'''Dante:''' Well the way I figure it, in this business a lot of your kind come along, and if I kill each one that comes, eventually I should hit the jackpot sooner or later. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> She says the attack was a test, and that the demon emperor [[Characters in Devil May Cry#Mundus|Mundus]], whom Dante holds responsible for the deaths of his family, is planning a return.<ref>'''Trish:''' Yes, his powers were sealed by Sparda, he's attempting to take control of the human world again. He has been preparing to open the gate on... Mallet Island. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> The scene jumps to their arrival at an immense [[castle]], whereupon Trish abruptly leaps and vanishes over a high wall.

[[Image:Devil-may-cry-phantom.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Dante encounters Phantom.]]
Dante explores the castle and encounters the game's stock enemies, demonic marionettes. He also finds a new sword called Alastor, and battles the first [[boss (video games)|boss]], a giant [[spider]]/[[scorpion]] demon named Phantom. Dante wins the battle, but in what becomes a recurring theme, the defeated boss monster reappears a short time later in a corridor, forcing the player to choose a narrow escape or to fight in the tight confines. After further exploration and combat, Dante battles a demon named Nelo Angelo who impresses Dante with his confidence.<ref>'''Dante:''' This stinking hole was the last place that I thought I<U+2019>d find anyone with some guts. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> The demon wins, but suddenly flees upon seeing the half-[[amulet]] Dante wears. The demon attacks twice more in later missions, and is eventually revealed to be Dante's [[Twin#Identical twins|identical twin]] brother, [[Characters in Devil May Cry#Vergil|Vergil]]. After Vergil's final defeat, his amulet joins with his brother's half, and "Force Edge", the game's default sword which belonged to the twins' father, changes into its true form and becomes the powerful [[Characters in Devil May Cry#Sparda|Sparda]] sword.


When Dante next meets Trish, she betrays him and reveals that she too is working for Mundus. But when her life is endangered, Dante chooses to save her. Saying he only did so because of her resemblance to his [[Characters in Devil May Cry#Eva|mother]], he warns her to stay away.<ref>'''Trish:''' Uh... Dante! Dante why did you save my life? '''Dante:''' Because you look like my mother... Now get out of my sight! The next time we meet it won<U+2019>t be like this. '''Trish:''' Dante! '''Dante:''' Don<U+2019>t come any closer you Devil! You may look like my mother but you're nowhere close to her. You have no soul! You have the face but you'll never have her fire! (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Yet when he finally confronts Mundus, who is about to kill Trish, Dante again chooses to save her and is injured. Mundus tries to finish him off, but Trish takes the attack instead. This unleashes Dante's full power thus allowing him to take on the form of Sparda.<ref>'''Dante:''' How much longer are you going to keep zapping? Come out and show yourself, Mundus! (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Dante and Mundus then battle on another plane of existence.

Dante is victorious, and leaves the amulet and sword with Trish's immobile body before departing.<ref>'''Dante:''' This was my mother's. Now I'm giving it to you. My father's also here now. Rest... in Peace. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Mundus returns and corners Dante, who is now back to his regular strength, before he can flee the island; Trish also returns and lends Dante her power. Dante defeats Mundus, who vows to return and rule the human world.<ref>'''Trish:''' Dante, use my power! '''Dante:''' Trish! Okay! (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> When Trish tries to apologize she begins to cry, and Dante tells her it means she has become human and not just a devil, because "devils never cry".<ref>'''Dante:''' Trish...devils never cry... These tears, tears are a gift only humans have. (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Dante and Trish escape on a plane as the island collapses. After the credits, it is revealed that Dante and Trish are working together as partners, and have renamed the shop "Devil Never Cry".

==Development==
[[Image:DMCsketch.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Development drawings featuring some scenarios and an early version of [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]].]]

''Devil May Cry'' began its development life as a [[Resident Evil (series)|''Resident Evil'' 4 title]] for PS2, after the completion of ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', under the [[game director|direction]] of Hideki Kamiya and "Team Little Devil".<ref name="OkamiTree">{{cite web|last= Mielke|first= James|publisher= 1UP.com| date= 2006-08-18|title = The Okami Family Tree| url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3152913|accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> Early [[research and development]] work included a trip to [[Spain]], to examine various castles as a basis for the game's environments. However, in [[prototype]] status, the game proved to be a radical departure from the established ''Resident Evil'' formula and the [[survival horror]] genre in general. Rather than abandon the project entirely, the premise was changed and the game eventually became ''Devil May Cry''.<ref name="Interview with Shinji Mikami">{{cite web|date= 2001-05-17|title=Interview with Shinji Mikami| publisher= IGN| url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/094/094860p1.html | accessdate=2008-07-20 | work=E3 2001}}</ref> Some of the major gameplay elements were partially inspired by a bug found in ''[[Onimusha: Warlords]]''. During a test-play, Kamiya discovered that enemies could be kept in the air by slashing them repeatedly, which lead to the inclusion of juggles by gunfire and sword strikes in ''Devil May Cry''.<ref name=egm>''Electronic Gaming Monthly'', December 2001 issue, pg. 56</ref>

According to Kamiya, ''Devil May Cry'' was designed from the ground up around Dante's acrobatics and combat abilities.<ref name="Kamiya Touch">{{cite web|last= Mielke|first= James|date= 2006-08-18| title = The Kamiya Touch| url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3152880|accessdate = 2008-07-20 | publisher=1UP.com}}</ref> The decision was made late in the development process to change the game to a more mission-based advancement, instead of the more open-ended structure of the ''Resident Evil'' games.<ref name="Preview1">{{cite web|last= Ike Sato|first= Yukiyoshi |date= 2001-05-24|title = Capcom changes Devil May Cry gameplay| url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/devilmaycry/news.html?sid=2765132|accessdate = 2008-07-20 | publisher=GameSpot}}</ref> ''Devil May Cry'''s difficulty was intentional, according to Kamiya, who called it his "challenge to those who played light, casual games."<ref name=top200>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-20|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3147448|title=Greatest 200 |publisher=1UP }}</ref>

===Legacy===
''Devil May Cry'' has spawned a sequel (''Devil May Cry 2'') and a prequel (''Devil May Cry 3''); both of which have sold more than one million copies. A fourth game, ''Devil May Cry 4'', was released on February 5, 2008 in the United States for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. The game has likewise resulted in the release of two [[novel]]s by Shinya Goikeda,<ref>{{cite web|last= Goikeda|first= Shinya|title = Amazon.com listing for Devil May Cry Volume 1|url= http://www.amazon.com/Devil-May-Cry/dp/1598164503| accessdate= 2008-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= Goikeda|first= Shinya|title = Amazon.com listing for Devil May Cry Volume 2|url= http://www.amazon.com/dp/1598164511/| accessdate= 2008-07-20}}</ref> and an [[Devil May Cry: The Animated Series|anime series]]. On October 15, 2004, three years after the game's release, a [[Devil May Cry soundtracks#Devil May Cry soundtrack|soundtrack]] containing the game's music was released alongside the soundtrack to ''Devil May Cry 2''. Plans for a [[PlayStation Portable]] installment,<ref>http://psp.ign.com/objects/683/683105.html IGN.com: ''Devil May Cry Series''. Retrieved on November 24, 2007.</ref> tentatively titled ''Devil May Cry Series'', and a [[live action]] [[movie adaptation]]<ref>http://movies.ign.com/articles/422/422228p1.html IGN.com: Games-to-Film: ''Devil May Cry''. Retrieved on November 24, 2007.</ref> have been announced. According to the Internet Movie Database, the film may be released some time during 2010. However, nothing else has been released beyond their announcements.

''Devil May Cry'' has been cited as the beginning of a sub-genre of action games called "Extreme Combat", which focus on powerful heroes fighting hordes of foes with a focus on stylish action.<ref>{{cite book | last= Bateman | first= Chris | coauthors = Richard Boon | title = [[21st Century Game Design]] | publisher = Charles River Media | pages = pp. 246<U+2013>247 | date = 2005-08-29 | isbn = 978-1-58-450429-0 }}</ref> The game has also been described as being the first game that "successfully captured the twitch-based, relentlessly free-flowing gameplay style of so many classic 2D action games".<ref name="Review1"/> The series has become the standard against which other [[3D computer graphics|3D]] action games are measured, with comparisons in reviews of games including ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title= God of War|publisher= [[IGN]]|url= http://ps2.ign.com/objects/661/661321.html#previews| accessdate= 2008-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| date= 2005-06-16| publisher= Playstation World| title= God of War Review |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=120641&site=psw&skip=yes| accessdate= 2008-07-20}}</ref> ''[[Chaos Legion]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last= Varanini|first= Giancarlo| publisher= [[Gamespot]]| date= 2003-08-04| title= Chaos Legion review| url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/chaoslegion/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;review| accessdate= 2008-07-20}}</ref> and ''[[Blood Will Tell]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last= Bedigian|first= Louis| publisher= Gamezone| date= 2004-09-29| title= Blood Will Tell review| url= http://ps2.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r22035.htm| accessdate= 2008-07-20}}</ref>
