"'''Imagine'''" is a song written and performed by the English musician [[John Lennon]].  The best-selling single of his solo career, its lyrics encourage the listener to imagine a world at peace without the divisiveness and barriers of borders, religions and nationalities, and to consider the possibility that the focus of humanity should be living a life unattached to material possessions.

Lennon and [[Yoko Ono]] co-produced the song and [[Imagine (album)|album of the same name]] with [[Phil Spector]]. Recording began at Lennon's home studio at [[Tittenhurst Park]], England, in May 1971, with final overdubs taking place at the [[Record Plant]], in New York City, during July. One month after the September release of the LP, Lennon released "Imagine" as a single in the United States; the song peaked at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the LP reached number one on the UK chart in November, later becoming the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career. Although not originally released as a single in the United Kingdom, it was released in 1975 to promote a compilation LP and it reached number six in the chart that year. The song has since sold more than 1.6 million copies in the UK; it reached number one following Lennon's death in December 1980.

[[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] named "Imagine" one of the 100 most-performed songs of the 20th century. The song ranked number 30 on the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s list of the 365 [[Songs of the Century]] bearing the most historical significance. It earned a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame#500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll|500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. A UK survey conducted by the ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums|Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book]]'' named it the second best single of all time, and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it number 3 in their list of "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]". Since 2005, event organisers have played it just before the New Year's [[Times Square Ball]] drops in New York City. Dozens of artists have [[cover version|performed or recorded]] versions of "Imagine", including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Elton John]], and [[Diana Ross]]. [[Emeli Sand<U+00E9>]] recorded a cover for the [[BBC]] to use during the end credits montage at the close of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] coverage in August 2012. "Imagine" subsequently re-entered the UK Top 40, reaching number 18.

==Composition and writing==
Several poems from [[Yoko Ono]]'s 1964 book ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit]]'' inspired Lennon to write the lyrics for "Imagine"{{sfn|Sheff|1981|pp=212<U+2013>213}}<U+2014>in particular, one which [[Capitol Records]] reproduced on the back cover of the original ''[[Imagine (album)|Imagine]]'' LP titled "Cloud Piece", reads: "Imagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole in your garden to put them in."{{sfn|Spizer|2005|p=54}} Lennon later said the composition "should be credited as a Lennon/Ono song. A lot of it<U+2014>the lyric and the concept<U+2014>came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of ''Grapefruit''."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with [[David Sheff]] for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, Lennon told Sheff that [[Dick Gregory]] had given Ono and him a [[Christian prayer]] book, which helped inspire in Lennon what he described as:

{{quote|The concept of positive prayer&nbsp;... If you can ''imagine'' a world at peace, with no denominations of religion<U+2014>not without religion but without this my God-is-bigger-than-your-God thing<U+2014>then it can be true&nbsp;... the World Church called me once and asked, "Can we use the lyrics to 'Imagine' and just change it to 'Imagine ''one'' religion'?" That showed [me] they didn't understand it at all. It would defeat the whole purpose of the song, the whole idea.{{sfn|Sheff|1981|pp=212<U+2013>213}}}}

With the combined influence of "Cloud Piece" and the prayer book given to him by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as "a humanistic [[paean]] for the people."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} Blaney wrote, "Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} In the opinion of Blaney, with "Imagine", Lennon attempted to raise people's awareness of their interaction with the institutions that affect their lives.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} ''Rolling Stone''{{'s}} David Fricke commented: "[Lennon] calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order: geopolitical borders, organised religion, [and] economic class."{{sfn|Fricke|2012|p=59}}

Lennon stated: "'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is virtually the Communist manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} He told ''[[NME]]'': "There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about&nbsp;... [is] not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice&nbsp;... British Socialism."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}}

Ono described the lyrical statement of "Imagine" as "just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people."{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described its lyrics as "22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself."{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}}{{refn|group=nb|The lyrical content of "Imagine" relates to Lennon's concept of [[Nutopia|Nutopia: The Country of Peace]], which he invented in 1973. Lennon included a symbolically mute anthem to this country on his album ''[[Mind Games]]'' released later that year.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=82}}}}

Lennon composed "Imagine" one morning in early 1971, on a [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] piano, in a bedroom at his [[Tittenhurst Park]] estate in [[Ascot, Berkshire]], England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session.{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}} "Imagine" is in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[C major]]. Its 4-bar piano introduction begins with a C chord then moves to Cmaj7 before changing to F; the 12-bar verses also follow this chord progression, with their last 4 bars moving from Am/E to Dm and Dm/C, finishing with G, G11 then G7, before resolving back to C.{{sfn|Lennon|1983|pp=5<U+2013>9}} The 8-bar choruses progress from F to G to C, then Cmaj7 and E before ending on E7, a C chord substituted for E7 in the final bar. The 4-bar [[Conclusion (music)|outro]] begins with F, then G, before resolving on C. With a duration of 3 minutes and 3 seconds and a [[time signature]] of 4/4, the song's tempo falls around 75 [[beats per minute]].<ref>For the musical notation to "Imagine" see: {{harvnb|Lennon|1983|pp=5<U+2013>9}}; for the piano on which Lennon composed "Imagine" see: {{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/974485.stm |publisher=BBC News| title=George Michael buys Lennon's piano |date=18 October 2000|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref>

==Recording and commercial reception==

Lennon and Ono co-produced the song and album with Phil Spector, who commented on the track: "We knew what we were going to do&nbsp;... It was going to be John making a political statement, but a very commercial one as well&nbsp;... I always thought that 'Imagine' was like the national anthem."<ref>For Spector co-producing with Lennon and Ono see: {{harvnb|Du Noyer|1971|pp=1<U+2013>14}}; for "I always thought that song was like the national anthem" see: {{harvnb|Levy|2005|p=87}}.</ref> Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that<U+2014>[Ono] and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'...&nbsp;I'll get the initial idea and&nbsp;... we'll just find a sound from [there]."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|pp=50<U+2013>51}}

Recording began at [[Tittenhurst Park#Ascot Sound Studios|Ascot Sound Studios]], Lennon's newly built home studio at Tittenhurst Park, in May 1971, with final overdubs taking place at the [[Record Plant]], in New York City, during July.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|pp=50<U+2013>51}} Relaxed and patient, the sessions began during the late morning, running to just before dinner in the early evening. Lennon taught the musicians the chord progression and a working arrangement for "Imagine", rehearsing the song until he deemed the musicians ready to record.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} In his attempt to recreate Lennon's desired sound, Spector had some early tapings feature Lennon and [[Nicky Hopkins]] playing in different octaves on one piano. He also initially attempted to record the piano part with Lennon playing the white [[Piano#Grand|baby grand]] in the couple's all-white room. However, after having deemed the room's acoustics unsuitable, Spector abandoned the idea in favour of the superior environment of Lennon's home studio.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} They completed the session in minutes, recording three takes and choosing the second one for release.{{sfn|Fricke|2012|p=58}} The finished recording featured Lennon on piano and vocal, [[Klaus Voormann]] on  bass guitar, [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] on drums and the Flux Fiddlers on strings.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=53}}

Issued by [[Apple Records]] in the United States in October 1971, "Imagine" became the best-selling single of Lennon's solo career.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=292}} It peaked at number 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=57}} It reached number 1 in Canada on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' national singles chart, remaining there for two weeks.<ref name="RPM71">For "Imagine" at number 1 in Canada on 27 November 1971 see: {{cite web| title= Top Singles&nbsp;<U+2013> Volume 16, No. 15, November 27, 1971 |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.7536&type=1&interval=24 |work= [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |publisher= Library and Archives Canada| accessdate=1 September 2012}}; for "Imagine" at number 1 in Canada on 4 December 1971 see: {{cite web|title= Top Singles&nbsp;<U+2013> Volume 16, No. 16, December 4, 1971|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.7566&type=1&interval=24|work= [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |publisher= Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> Upon its release the song's lyrics upset some religious groups, particularly the line: "Imagine there's no heaven".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=382}} When asked about the song during one of his final interviews, Lennon said he considered it to be as strong a composition as any he had written with [[the Beatles]].{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}} He described the song's meaning and explicated its commercial appeal: "Anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic, but because it is sugarcoated it is accepted&nbsp;... Now I understand what you have to do. Put your political message across with a little honey."{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=87}} Lennon once told [[Paul McCartney]] that "Imagine" was "'[[Working Class Hero]]' with sugar on it for conservatives like yourself".{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=179}} On 30 November 1971, the ''Imagine'' LP reached number one on the UK chart.{{sfn|Badman|1999|p=55}} It became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career.{{sfn|Goldman|1988|p=397}}

In 1972, Lennon and Ono released an 81-minute [[Imagine (1972 film)|film]] to accompany the ''Imagine'' album which featured footage of the couple in their home, garden and the recording studio of their [[Berkshire]] property at Tittenhurst Park as well as in New York City.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=378}} A full-length documentary rock video, the film's first scene features a shot of Lennon and Ono walking through a thick fog, arriving at their house as the song "Imagine" begins. Above the front door to their house is a sign that reads: "This Is Not Here", the title of Ono's then New York art show. The next scene shows Lennon sitting at a white grand piano in a dimly lit, all-white room. Ono gradually walks around opening curtains that allow in light, making the room brighter with the song's progression.<ref>For a description of the room and Ono opening shutters see: {{cite book|last=Edmondson|first=Jacqueline|year=2010|publisher=Greenwood|title=John Lennon: A Biography|isbn=978-0-313-37938-3|page=140}}; for the title of Ono's then New York art show see: {{harvnb|Harry|2000b|pp=907<U+2013>908}}.</ref> At the song's conclusion, Ono sits beside Lennon at the piano, and they share a quaint gaze, then a brief kiss.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=763}}

Several celebrities appeared in the film, including [[Andy Warhol]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Jack Palance]], [[Dick Cavett]] and [[George Harrison]]. Derided by critics as "the most expensive home movie of all time", it premiered to an American audience in 1972.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=378}} In 1986, [[Zbigniew Rybczy<U+0144>ski]] made a [[music video]] for the song, and in 1987, it won both the "[[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival|Silver Lion]]" award for Best Clip at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and the Festival Award at the [[Festival do Rio|Rio International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polishfilmla.org/wocms.php?siteID=13&ID=33|title=Artist/VIP gallery: Zbigniew Rybczynski|publisher=Polish American Film Society|accessdate=25 September 2012}}</ref>

Released as a single in the United Kingdom in 1975 in conjunction with the album ''[[Shaved Fish]]'', "Imagine" peaked at number six on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Following [[Death of John Lennon|Lennon's murder]] in 1980, the single re-entered the UK chart, reaching number one, where it remained for four weeks in January 1981. "Imagine" was re-released as a single in the UK in 1988, peaking at number 45, and again in 1999, reaching number three.

Authors Ben Urish and Ken Bielen criticised the song's instrumental music as overly sentimental and melodramatic, comparing it to the music of the pre-rock era and describing the vocal melody as understated.{{sfn|Urish|Bielen|2007|p=27}} According to Blaney, Lennon's lyrics describe hypothetical possibilities that offer no practical solutions; lyrics that are at times nebulous and contradictory, asking the listener to abandon political systems while encouraging one similar to [[communism]].{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} Author Chris Ingham indicated the hypocrisy in Lennon, the millionaire rock star living in a mansion, encouraging listeners to imagine living their lives without possessions.{{sfn|Ingham|2009|p=99}} Others argue that Lennon intended the song's lyrics to inspire listeners to imagine if the world ''could'' live without possessions, not as an explicit call to give them up.{{sfn|Ingham|2009|p=99}}  Blaney commented: "Lennon knew he had nothing concrete to offer, so instead he offers a dream, a concept to be built upon."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}}

Blaney considered the song to be "riddled with contradictions. Its hymn-like setting sits uncomfortably alongside its author's plea for us to envision a world without religion."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} Urish and Bielen described Lennon's "dream world" without a heaven or hell as a call to "make the best world we can here and now, since this is all this is or will be."{{sfn|Urish|Bielen|2007|p=27}} In their opinion, "because we are asked merely to imagine<U+2014>to play a 'what if' game, Lennon can escape the harshest criticisms".{{sfn|Urish|Bielen|2007|p=27}} Former Beatle [[Ringo Starr]] defended the song's lyrics during a 1981 interview with [[Barbara Walters]], stating: "[Lennon] said 'imagine', that's all. Just imagine it."{{sfn|Urish|Bielen|2007|p=27}}
