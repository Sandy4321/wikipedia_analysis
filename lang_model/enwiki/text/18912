'''[[Chinese folk religion|Shenism]]''' (the [[Han Chinese]] [[ethnic religion]]) '''in [[Southeast Asia]]''' plays a dynamic role in the lives of the [[overseas Chinese|Chinese populations]] that have settled in the countries of this geographic region, particularly [[Chinese people in Burma|Burmese Chinese]], [[Malaysian Chinese]], [[Thai Chinese]] and [[Hoa people|Hoa]]. The [[Indonesian Chinese]], by contrast, were forced to adopt ''en masse'' either [[Buddhism]] or [[Christianity]] in the 1950s and 1960s, abandoning traditional worship, due to [[Indonesia]]'s religious policies which forbade Chinese traditional religion.

The Chinese folk religion of Southeast Asian Chinese people is markedly typified by the interaction with Malay indigenous religions ([[Malaysian folk religion|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian folk religion]]) and the adoption of gods of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] derivation, such as [[Brahma]], [[Ganesha]] and [[Hanuman]]. The philosophical forms of [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] are followed, and [[Chinese salvationist religions|organised forms]] of the Chinese folk faith, such as [[De religion|Deism]], [[Yiguandao]] and [[Zhenkongism]], have taken significant foothold among Southeast Asian Chinese.

In [[Singapore]] about 11% of the total population is Taoist, composed by a 14.4% of the [[Chinese Singaporeans]] identifying as Taoists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/popn/C2010sr1/cop2010sr1.pdf|title=Census of population 2010: Statistical Release 1 on Demographic Characteristics, Education, Language and Religion|author=Singapore Department of Statistics|date=12 January 2011|work=|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref> In [[Malaysia]], around 3% of Chinese Malaysians practice Chinese folk religions, corresponding to around 1% of the whole country population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/census2010/Taburan_Penduduk_dan_Ciri-ciri_Asas_Demografi.pdf|title= 2010 Population and Housing Census of Malaysia|accessdate=17 June 2012|publisher=Department of Statistics, Malaysia}} p. 13</ref> In [[Indonesia]], Taosu Agung Kusumo, leader of the Majelis Agama Tao Indonesia, claims there are 5 million Taoist followers in the country as of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indonesiamatters.com/3778/taoism/ |title=Tao, Taoism Religion |publisher=Indonesiamatters.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>

==By country==
===Indonesia===
[[File:Confucian Temple in TMII, Jakarta.jpg|thumb|150px|Confucian temple in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]].]]
The Chinese folk religion of the [[Chinese Indonesians]] is named "Confucianism", and officially recognised by the government as ''Agama Khonghucu'' or ''religion of [[Confucius]]'', which was chosen because of the political condition in [[Indonesia]] before the end of [[Suharto]] rule in 1998, which saw the Chinese religions forbidden and the Chinese forced to convert to Buddhism or Christianity. The Chinese Indonesians had their culture and religious rights restored only after the fourth president of Indonesia, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], issued a regulation that recognised "Confucianism" among the legal religions of the country. He said that:
{{Quote|All religions insist on peace. From this we might think that the religious struggle for peace is simple... but it is not. The deep problem is that people use religion wrongly in pursuit of victory and triumph. This sad fact then leads to conflict with people who have different beliefs.<ref>[http://www.reverendsunmyungmoon.org/ambassadors_for_peace.html Ambassadors for the Universal Peace Federation]. Reverendsunmyungmoon.org.</ref>}}

The first precept of ''[[Pancasila]]'' (the Five Basic Principles of the Indonesian state) stipulates belief in the one and only [[God]]. The Confucian philosophy is able to fulfill this, for Confucius mentioned only one God in his teaching, the [[Tian|Heaven]] or [[Shangdi]]. The Heaven possess the characteristic of ''Yuan Heng Li Zhen'', or ''Omnipresent'', ''Omnipotent'', ''Omnibenevolent'', ''Just''.<ref name="Matrisia">Bidang Litbang PTITD/Matrisia Jawa Tengah. 2007. ''Pengetahuan Umum Tentang Tri Dharma'', First Edition (July 2007). Publisher: Benih Bersemi, Semarang, [[Indonesia]].</ref>
<blockquote>The Master said, "Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it. How majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he instituted!" (VIII, xix, tr. Legge 1893:214)</blockquote>

Another movement in Indonesia is the ''Tridharma'' ([[Sanskrit]]: "religion of the Three"), [[syncretism|syncretising]] elements of different religions, the Chinese [[three teachings]] amongst others.<ref name="Tsuda Koji">Tsuda Koji. ''"Chinese Religion" in Modern Indonesia: Focusing on the Trend Toward Systematization in the Post-Soeharto Era''. Tokyo University of Foreign Studies.</ref> After the fall of Suharto rule it is undergoing a process of systematisation of doctrines and rituals.<ref name="Tsuda Koji"/> Tridharma temples always consist of three main rooms: the front room for [[Tian]] or God, the middle for the main deity of the temple, the back room for the three teachers and their pantheon: [[Confucius]], [[Laozi]], and [[Buddha]]. There are also many Taoist associations in Indonesia.

===Malaysia===

[[File:Snake Temple, Penang.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Snake Temple]] in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], hosting a Chinese cult of the snake that is unique to the area.]]
In [[Malaysia]] the [[Malaysian Chinese]] constitute a large segment of the population, mostly adherent of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]]. The Chinese traditional religion has a relatively significant following in the states of [[Sarawak]] (6%) and [[Penang]] (5%).

The Chinese folk religion was brought for the first time by [[Chinese emigration|Chinese emigrants]] in the 15th century, with small settlements that were established in [[Melaka]] by [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]] traders, but it was not until the 19th century that there was a mass migration of Chinese. They built shrines dedicated to their [[deities]] and cemeteries for those who died. The Chinese migration during the tin and gold mining days, which were a result of high demand for these products, prompted the need of temples, for practices and religious rituals.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Malaysia'', vol. ''Religions & Beliefs'', edited by Kamal Hassan, Ghazali bin Basri. ISBN 981-3018-51-8 [http://www.selectbooks.com.sg/getTitle.cfm?SBNum=28708]</ref>

Social organisations in the Chinese immigrant society were important, where surnames, dialect, locality and trade mattered. The [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]], [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]], [[Teochew people|Teochew]] and [[Hakka people|Hakka]], respectively formed their [[secret societies]], such as the Ghee Hin and Hai San, and they played [[grassroots]] government of the Chinese communities.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Malaysia'', vol. ''Religions & Beliefs'', edited by Kamal Hassan, Ghazali bin Basri. ISBN 981-3018-51-8 [http://www.selectbooks.com.sg/getTitle.cfm?SBNum=28708]</ref>

A prominent cult is that of [[Tua Pek Kong]] ({{lang|zh|<U+5927><U+4F2F><U+516C>}} ''Dabo Gong''), and it has incorporated the cult of the [[Na Tuk Kong]] ({{lang|zh|<U+62FF><U+7763><U+516C>}} ''Nadu Gong'') of local Malay origin. Other Malay and [[Thai people|Thai]] gods have been incorporated into the pantheon.

===Thailand===
[[Thailand]] has a large population of [[Thai Chinese]], people of Chinese or partial Chinese origin. Most of those who follow Buddhism have been integrated into the [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhist]] tradition of the country, with only a negligible minority still practicing [[Chinese Buddhism]]. However, many others have retained the Chinese folk religions and Taoism.<ref name="Tatsuki Kataoka">Tatsuki Kataoka. ''Religion as Non-religion: The Place of Chinese Temples in Phuket, Southern Thailand''. In ''Southeast Asian Studies'', Vol. 1, No. 3, December 2012, pp. 461<U+2013>485. Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University.</ref> Despite the large number of followers and temples, and although they are practiced freely, these religions have no state recognition, their temples are not counted as places of worship, and their followers are counted as "Theravada Buddhists" in officially released religious figures.<ref name="Tatsuki Kataoka"/> In Thailand, Chinese temples are called ''sanchao'' ({{lang-th|<U+0E28><U+0E32><U+0E25><U+0E40><U+0E08><U+0E49><U+0E32>}}).<ref name="Tatsuki Kataoka"/>

The Chinese folk religion of Thailand has developed local features, including the worship of local gods.<ref name="Tatsuki Kataoka"/> Major Chinese festivals such as the [[Chinese New Year|Nian]], [[Mid-Autumn Festival|Zhongqiu]] and [[Qingming]] are widely celebrated especially in [[Bangkok]], [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], and other parts of Thailand where there are large Chinese populations.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rethinking Assimilation and Ethnicity: The Chinese of Thailand |work=Alternate Identities: The Chinese of Contemporary Thailand |author1=Tong Chee Kiong |author2=Chan Kwok Bun |year=2001 |pages=30<U+2013>34}}</ref>

The Chinese in the city of [[Phuket (city)|Phuket]] are noted for their nine-day vegetarian festival between September and October. During the festive season, devotees will abstain from meat and [[mortification of the flesh]] by Chinese mediums are also commonly seen, along with rites devoted to the worship of [[Tua Pek Kong]]. Such traditions were developed during the 19th century in Phuket by the local Chinese with influences from Thai culture.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Way That Lives in the Heart: Chinese Popular Religion and Spirits Mediums in Penang, Malaysia|author=Jean Elizabeth DeBernardi|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2006|pages=25<U+2013>30|isbn=0-8047-5292-3}}</ref>

===Singapore===
{{See also|Taoism in Singapore}}
Some [[Chinese Singaporeans]] practice [[Taoism]], which in the city state is used as a [[synecdoche]] for broader Chinese folk religion. Taoists in Singapore worship many deities, that oftentime are incarnated and thus ancestral and are subject to a complex Taoist hierarchy of veneration. They also worship some deities of common origins, notably the [[Jade Emperor]], [[Xuan Wu (god)|Xuan Wu]], [[Guan Yu]], and [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]]. Other deities that were venerated and frequently taken as auspicious images include the [[Fu, Lu, and Shou]]. [[Caishen]] is also venerated by many Chinese businessmen. Minor deities, especially ancestral, worshipped by different language groups, may not share a common origin with other Chinese dialect groups. Unlike other groups, some deities worshipped by [[Hakka]] are not depicted in the form of statues. Usually a stone or tablet is used to represent the deity instead.

Adherents of Taoism would place house altars in their living room. This is more frequently seen among Chinese families, rather than individuals. The family god or deity would be placed on the top altar, and a spiritual tablet would be placed at the bottom altar, although ancestral tablets are at times incorrectly placed at the top altar as well. Often, urns, usually placed with some joss sticks, are placed in front of the deity. Oil lamps may also be placed at the sides, and fruit offerings are also placed in front of the deity as offerings.

A [[brazier]], often painted red, may also be seen. They are meant for burning joss papers. They also hang a small altar, painted red, with the words "Heaven Bestows Wealth" (<U+5929><U+5BAE><U+8CDC><U+798F>) painted on it outside the house or simply a small urn filled with ash where joss sticks are placed. The smoke emitted from burning joss sticks is believed to transmit their devotion, and at times requests, to the gods.

===Places of worship and practice===
{{See also|Chinese temple}}
Chinese temples in Indonesia and Malaysia are called ''kelenteng'' or ''klenteng'' in local [[Malay language]]s, or alternatively ''bio'', the southern [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese]] pronunciation of Mandarin ''miao'' ({{lang|zh|<U+5E99>}}). In Thailand their name is ''sanchao'' ({{lang-th|<U+0E28><U+0E32><U+0E25><U+0E40><U+0E08><U+0E49><U+0E32>}}). Items for Chinese religious practices in Southeast Asia are supplied at ''[[religious goods store|sh<U+00E9>n li<U+00E0>o sh<U+0101>ngdi<U+00E0>n]]'' (<U+795E><U+6599><U+5546><U+5E97> "shops of goods for the gods").
