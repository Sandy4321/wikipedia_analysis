The '''USS ''Ponaganset'' (AO-78)''' was an [[Escambia class fleet replenishment oiler|''Escambia''-class fleet oiler]]<sup>1</sup>, of the [[T2 tanker|T2-SE-A2 tanker]] hull type, serving in the [[United States Navy]] during the era of the [[Second World War]]. Laid down [[27 April]] [[1942]], she was named for the [[Ponaganset River]] located in [[Foster, Rhode Island|Foster]] and [[Glocester, Rhode Island|Glocester]], [[Rhode Island]]. 

''Ponaganset'' was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] [[10 July]] [[1943]] after being built at [[Marinship]], [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]], [[California]], under [[Maritime Commission]] contract MC 1265. Sponsored by Mrs. J.W. Fowler, the ship was [[ship commissioning|commission]]ed by the US Navy on [[15 May]] [[1944]], and reported to the [[US Pacific Fleet]], [[25 June]] 1944.

After [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] off the [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]], ''Ponaganset'' arrived [[Pearl Harbor]], [[17 July]], and made a fuel run to [[Eniwetok]] and back before departing again on fueling duties for [[Guadalcanal]], [[Manus Island|Manus]], [[Kossol]], [[Ulithi]], [[Peleliu]], and [[Saipan]], reaching [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] on [[22 March]] [[1945]]. In April she refueled the [[task force]] off [[Okinawa]], returning there during each of the next three months while moving around the western [[Pacific]] touching at Ulithi, [[Guam]], and Leyte where she was to be found at [[World War II]]'s end. She then steamed to Ulithi, the [[Marianas]], and Okinawa, before reaching [[Wakayama]], [[Japan]] [[26 September]]. She operated at various Japanese ports until steaming for [[San Francisco]], arriving [[5 January]] [[1946]]. She then transited the [[Panama Canal]], and arrived [[18 February]] 1946 at her new home yard of [[New York]].

Ponaganset earned two [[battle star]]s for World War II service.

She decommissioned [[26 April]] 1946 and was struck from the [[Navy List]] [[23 April]] [[1947]]. She was returned to the [[Maritime Commission]] for disposal at [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] [[15 May]] 1947. 

In 1947 ''Ponaganset'' fractured into two sections while tied at dockside in [[Boston]]:
:''The source of the fracture was an arc strike located at the toe of a fillet weld that joined a chock in the deck. ... The presence of the sharp cracks in the arc strike located in a region of high residual stress resulting from the fillet weld provided the necessary conditions for fracture initiation at temperatures below the NDT. As indicated by the facture analysis diagram, the failure temperature was 15<U+00B0>F below the NDT temperature of the source plate. The [[steel]] was typical of the World War II production material which features relatively high [[carbon]] and low [[manganese]] contents.'' (US Naval Research Laboratory report 5920)

In the early part of [[1948]] the vessel was reacquired by the Navy "as is where is" [[2 March]] 1948. On [[2 June]] 1948 title was transferred back to the Maritime Commission at the [[Boston Naval Shipyard]] [[30 June]] 1948. She was sold for scrap to [[Northern Metal Company]] [[7 January]] 1949.
