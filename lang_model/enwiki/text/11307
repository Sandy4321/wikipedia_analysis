The '''Bell 47'''  was the first [[helicopter]] certified for civilian use, on [[8 March]] [[1946]].<ref name="helis-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.helis.com/timeline/bell.php|title=Bell Helicopters|publisher=Helicopter History Site}}</ref><ref name="young-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.modelaircraft.org/museum/bio/Young.pdf|title=Biography of ARTHUR MIDDLETON YOUNG}}</ref> It was mostly designed by [[Arthur M. Young]], who joined [[Bell Helicopter]] in 1941. More than 5,600 were produced until 1974, including 1,200 under license in [[Italy]], 239 in [[Japan]], and 239 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It was also the rotorcraft of choice for basic rotatory wing flight instruction for decades and in some countries still is.

The Bell 47 helicopter entered U.S. military service in late 1946, in a variety of versions and designations for three decades. In the [[Korean War]] (1950-1953) it was designated the '''H-13 Sioux''' by the United States Army, a highlight of its extensive career.

Early models were variable in appearance, with open [[cockpit]]s or [[sheet metal]] cabins, covered or open structures, some with four-wheel landing gear. Model D and Korean War types settled to a more utilitarian style. The most common model, the '''47G''' introduced in 1953, can be recognized by the full [[bubble canopy|bubble]] [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]], exposed welded-tube tail boom, saddle [[fuel tank]]s, and skid landing gear. Later '''47H''' and '''47J Ranger''' models had a regular cabin with full cowling and [[monocoque]] tail boom. [[Engine]]s were [[Franklin Engine Company|Franklin]] or [[Lycoming]] horizontally-opposed [[Reciprocating engine|piston engine]]s of 200 to 305 [[horsepower|HP]] (150 to 230 [[watt|kW]]). Seating varied from two to four. Many are still in use as [[trainer (aircraft)|trainer]]s and in [[Agricultural aircraft|agriculture]] (as of 2005).

==Operational history==
[[Image:agusta.bell.47g-3b-1.g-bfef.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Agusta Bell 47G, built 1964]]

[[NASA]] had a number of Bell 47s during the [[Apollo program]], used by astronauts as a trainer for the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Lander]]. [[Eugene Cernan]] had a near disastrous accident shortly before his flight to the moon on [[Apollo 17]] by crashing one into the [[Indian River (Florida)|Indian River]].{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

Initially, the US Navy procured several Bell 47s, designated '''HTL-1''', between 1947 and 1958. The US Coast Guard evaluated this model, and procured two HTL-1s for multi-mission support in the New York Harbor. The most common US Navy version of the 47 was designated the '''HTL-4''', and dispenses with the fabric covering on the tail boom.  The US Coast Guard procured three '''HTL-5'''s in 1952 (similar to the HTL-4 but powered by a Franklin 0-335-5 engine) and used these until 1960.<ref name=pearcy>{{cite book|last=Pearcy|first=Arthur|title=A History of Coast Guard Aviation|publisher=Naval Institute Press|date=1989|id=ISBN 0-87021-261-3}}</ref>

The Coast Guard procured two of Bell's Model 47G and designated them '''HUL-1G''' in 1959.<ref name=pearcy />
 
The British version of the '''47G''', called by the [[British Army]] the '''Sioux AH.1''', was built by [[Westland Helicopters]] for use by the [[Army Air Corps]], who used it until the early 1980s.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The Sioux military version was often equipped with military evacuation panniers, one to each skid, with an [[acrylic glass]] shield to protect the patient from wind.

H-13 were produced in Japan by a Bell and Kawasaki venture;this led to the Bell-Kawasaki KH-4 variant, essentially a three seat version of the Model 47.

===Bell 47 redesignations===
The Bell 47 was designated under multiple systems, see [[United States of America military aircraft designation systems]]. It is best known as the H-13 Sioux, though it actually started as the YR-13 in 1946. It became the H-13 under the USAF, though the USN had called it the HTL. 

In post-1962 US designations combinations with the number 13 are often skipped, but in the older system the R-13/H-13 shared the number with the [[X-13 Vertijet]] and [[XP-13 Viper]] (see [[List of military aircraft of the United States]])

In 1962 Army, Navy, and Air Force versions were redesignated under the new Tri-service system. Mainly, the H-13 based ones were converted to new standards which included a vehicle type designator and a mission symbol (2 letter prefix; OH, UH, XH, etc. This was a shift from the initial USAF 1948 system (with the numbered carried over from the USAAF/C system) and the USN 1922-1962 system to the new 1962 system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/d/o/dob104/aviation/us/index.html|title=U.S. Military Aircraft and Weapon Designations|author=Derek Bridges|accessdate=17 April 2007}}</ref>

The Bell 47 appeared, and played key roles, in film and television productions. It has been associated with both the ''[[M*A*S*H (movie)|M*A*S*H]]'' film, and the ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' television series, and the ''[[Whirlybirds]]'' TV series (1957<U+2013>1959).<ref>[http://cellmath.med.utoronto.ca/B47/history/wbGuide/wbIntro.html University of Toronto Bell 47 Web site project]</ref>
