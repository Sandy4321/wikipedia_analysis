The '''Bergen Line''' ({{lang-no|'''Bergensbanen'''}}), also called the '''Bergen Railway''', is a {{convert|371|km|mi}} [[standard gauge]] [[railway line]] between [[Bergen]] and [[H<U+00F8>nefoss]], [[Norway]].<ref name=jbvstat6 /> The name is often applied for the entire route from Bergen via [[Drammen]] to [[Oslo]], where the passenger trains go, a distance of {{convert|496|km|mi}}.<ref>Jernbaneverket, 2007: 13</ref> It is the highest mainline railway line in Northern Europe,<ref>Finse Tunnel is the highest point in Bergensbanen, in {{cite web|title=Finse|url=http://www.bt.no/kamera/article147.ece?lang=en|publisher=Bergens Tidende|accessdate=2008-06-03}} which is the highest railway in Northern Europe {{cite web|title=Norway in a Nutshell - Norway's most popular round trip tour|url=http://www.norway.com/publish.asp?id=396|date=12 March 2008|publisher=Norgate Online|accessdate=2008-06-03}}</ref> crossing the [[Hardangervidda]] plateau at {{convert|1237|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref name="dland1"/> 

The railway opened from Bergen to [[Voss]] in 1883 as the [[narrow gauge]] [[Voss Line]].

==History==
===First step to Voss===
[[Image:Bergensbanen map.png|thumb|Map of the the Bergen Line and principal stations]]
{{main|Voss Line}}
The first documented idea of building a railway between Norway's two largest cities was launched by [[Hans Gl<U+00F8>ersen]] on 24 August 1871 in [[Bergensposten]]. The forest supervisor in Voss suggested building the railway via Voss and [[Hallingdal]] to connect with the [[Kr<U+00F8>der Line]]. Back in 1866 the same person had launched the idea of the [[J<U+00E6>r Line]]. Within days of the launch of the Bergen Line the city council had assimilated support for the suggestion. In 1872 the railway director [[Carl Abraham Pihl]] and two engineers went on a survey tour to look at the suggested line.<ref>Gubberud, 1983: 16<U+2013>17</ref> At the time it was common that proposals for railways came from local initiative, and that local municipalities and private investors would then pay about 20% of the investments, the state covering the rest, mostly through [[foreign debt]].<ref>Gubberud, 1983: 17<U+2013>19</ref>

====Political processes====
On 20 October 1871 two engineers traversed the two possible routes from Bergen to Voss; the one via [[Fana]], [[Os, Hordaland|Os]] and [[Hardangerfjord]], the other via [[Dale, Hordaland|Dale]] and [[S<U+00F8>rfjord, Oster<U+00F8>y|S<U+00F8>rfjord]]. Though covering a less populated area, the latter would be cheaper to build, and have less elevation. A railway committee was created on 25 January 1872 with a limited mandate, which was increased again 20 December. At the same time there was a dispute between the [[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications|Ministry of Labour]] and Pihl about whether to prioritize the Bergen Line, but in July 1872 surveys were performed in person by Pihl and two engineers, and their report was positive. At the same time he launched the idea of a branch line up [[Valdres]] to [[L<U+00E6>rdal]].<ref>Gubberud, 1983: 19<U+2013>21</ref>

By 1873 agreement had been reached as to the right-of-way to Voss, but not onwards towards Oslo. On 13 January 1874 Bergen city council started issuing stock for the Voss Line, to begin with 400,000 [[Norwegian speciedaler|spd]] (NOK 1.6 million) was issued. In the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1873|1873 parliamentary election]] the railway supporter [[Peter Jebsen]] was elected, spending the next few years furiously defending the railway. The [[Storting|Norwegien Parliament]] chose to not issue new railway projects in the 1874 session, and instead make a complete plan for all railway construction in the country<U+2014>to be proposed by a committee. When the report was launched on 20 March 1875, the Voss Line was not included since it could not show a higher profitability than 1%. During the 1875 session there was not a majority for the Voss Line, partially due to the lack of capital available for local investors. This was based on a claim from [[Johan J<U+00F8>rgen Schwartz]], the chairman of the committee, that the investment costs were underestimated. This was countered by [[Nils Henrik Bruun]], a constructor from Bergen, who was willing to construct all tunnels on the railway for less than the budgeted sum. When Jebsen in addition was willing to act as personal guarantee for Bruun in case of his death, the majority in the parliament shifted. On 9 June 1875 parliament voted with 61 against 42 to build Vossebanen.<ref>Gubberud, 1983: 21<U+2013>27</ref>

====Construction====
[[Image:Bergensbanen-sammenkobling-1907.jpg|thumb|upright|The ceremony at the completion of the track at Ustaoset in 1907.]]
Vossebanen was built with [[narrow gauge]], {{RailGauge|1067}}. The first parts of the construction started in December 1875, while the largest part started in March 1876. During the winter the engineers had done the last finesses on the plans. At any given time at least 800 men worked on construction,<ref>Gubberud, 1983: 30</ref> and at the peak 1,800 men were employed.<ref>Hol<U+00F8>s, 1984: 18</ref> They worked 12 hours per day, for which they had a daily wage of NOK 2.55, the highest wage for [[navvy|navvies]] in the country.<ref>{{cite newspaper |first=L. M. |last=Hille |work=Bergens Aftenblad |date=1881-06-07 |title=Dagsl<U+00F8>nn}}</ref> To a large extent the labor came from Sweden, who had just finished the [[V<U+00E4>neren Line]] and had an excess of skilled labor for construction.  This import of labor had the effect of pumping money into the local economy, and several taverns were built along the line. There were some accidents, and several deaths among the workers.<ref>Gubberud, 1983: 32</ref>

The construction work was finished in 1882 and some test services began, though not scheduled until the spring of 1883. Official opening commenced on 11 July 1883. Many of the navvies settled on Vossebanen after construction, and started working for the [[Norges Statsbaner|NSB]] as part of the operation.<ref>Gubberud, 1983: 32<U+2013>33</ref>

===Across the mountain===
By the time the Voss Line was completed Norway had plunged into [[recession]]. Parliament was not willing go give more money to railways, and the country had to make due with a transport plan launched in 1886 that did not follow up with any funding. On 1 March 1894 parliament after five days of debate chose, with 60 against 53 votes, to build the Bergen Line.<ref>Hol<U+00F8>s, 1984: 28<U+2013>30</ref> Several different routes had been proposed, including over [[Kr<U+00F8>deren (lake)|Kr<U+00F8>deren]], or down [[Numedal]] (which later would get the [[Numedal Line]]). In the end Hallingdal was chosen, connecting to H<U+00F8>nefoss and via Sandvika. To save costs a preliminary line would connect H<U+00F8>nefoss to [[Roa]] with the branch [[Roa-H<U+00F8>nefoss Line]]. The final stage would be along the [[Gj<U+00F8>vik Line]] to Oslo. The line would also connect to the system via the [[Randsfjord Line]] at H<U+00F8>nefoss.

Local financing was ready within a year, yet it took six years to survey the line properly, and construction start had to weight until 1901.<ref>Hol<U+00F8>s, 1984: 31</ref> Construction started with the building of roads to get in supplied to the construction sites, completed in 1902. The construction was exceptionally challenging, at high altitudes in in a region without roads and with a climate that saw many meters of snow in the winter and temperatures far below freezing.<ref>Hol<U+00F8>s, 1984: 33<U+2013>34</ref> 113 tunnels, totaling {{convert|28|km|mi}} had to be built; the longest being the {{convert|5311|m|ft}} [[Gravehalsen Tunnel]], alone costing NOK 3 million and the longest tunnel north of the Alps. It took six years to build, and had to be excavated manually through solid [[gneiss]].<ref>Hol<U+00F8>s, 1984: 38<U+2013>43</ref> Laying of track was started in 1906, and in 1907 the two groups, both having started at their own end, met at Ustaoset. A small celebration was made at the spot (see image).

It had been decided that the Bergen Line, unlike the Voss Line, was to be built with [[standard gauge]]. So the newly laid line from Bergen to Voss had to be converted in time for the opening of the Bergen Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic on the line, with 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10/11 August 1904 all the track was changed and in the morning the trains could operate on standard gauge to Voss.<ref>Hol<U+00F8>s, 1984: 63<U+2013>64</ref>

The first services started on 1 July 1907 from Voss to [[Myrdal]]. An official opening train attempted to cross part of the line to [[Gulsvik]] on 9 December 1907, but got stuck in heavy snow and had to return. It turned out that the railway had to close and it took one and a half month to clear it for snow. It was even the [[rotary snowplow]] at 750 kW was not powerful enough to get rid of it. A new attempt to open the line in 1908 succeeded, and a train went from Gulsvik to Bergen. The line from Roa to Gulsvik was still under construction, so passage was along the [[Drammen Line]] via the [[Kr<U+00F8>der Line]] with ship over [[Kr<U+00F8>deren (lake)|Kr<U+00F8>deren]] to Gulsvik. The first scheduled train from [[Oslo Vestbanestasjon]] en route to Bergen departed 10 June 1908.<ref>Hol<U+00F8>s, 1984: 63-69</ref>

On 25 November 1909 a train en route from Bergen rolled into [[Oslo <U+00D8>stbanestasjon]], and two days later the railway was officially opened at Voss. [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] stated upon the opening that the line was the Norwegian engineering masterpiece of his generation.<ref>Hol<U+00F8>s, 1984: 73-75</ref> 

===Steaming up===
[[Image:Rotating snowplow on Bergensbanen.jpeg|thumb|The rotary snowplow fighting its way across Hardangervidda in 1908.]]
[[World War II]] was a demanding time for the railway line, as the track was in heavy use for both civilian and military transportation, and much of the equipment and maintenance was lacking. On 28 February 1944 a descending eastbound freight train loaded with oil and petrol lost its braking power and became a runaway train, finally ploughing into a westbound passenger train at Breifoss, just east of [[Geilo]]. The crash and subsequent fire killed 25 civilians and an unknown number of German soldiers. Poor lubrication oil combined with the cold weather is believed to have caused the accident.

===White coal across white plains===
[[Image:El18-2243 Finse 2004-07-07.jpg|thumb|An NSB [[NSB El 18|El 18]] hauled express train just leaving the [[Finse Tunnel]].]]
[[Image:NSB BM73 at Oslo S 20080327.jpg|thumb|An NSB [[NSB BM73|type 73]] express train at [[Oslo Central Station|Oslo S]] waiting for departure to Bergen.]]
Norway is a country with abundance of [[hydroelectricity]] and NSB saw huge amounts of money burning up with the imported coal. Plans for [[railway electrification system|electrification]] of the line is as old as the railway itself, and in 1912 the line from Nesttun to Bergen was proposed electrified and rebuilt to double track,<ref>Hol<U+00F8>s, 1984: 93</ref> having seen the [[Thamshavn Line]] open with electric traction in in 1908.<ref name=jbvstat33 /> During the planning of the [[Hardanger Line]] and the Fl<U+00E5>m Line during the 30s the suggestion again arose, and both the branch lines were built with electric traction, but not the main line. Countersuggestions were raised proposing a conversion to the locomotives running on [[petroleum|oil]] or [[coal dust]]. In 1939 a plan for national electrification was launched, and the Voss Line was top priority. But the breakout of World War II set the plans back, and not until the 50s was it again possible to afford such investments.<ref>Hob<U+00F8>l, 1984: 93<U+2013>95</ref> Vossebanen took electric traction into use on 2 July 1954.<ref name=jbvstat33 />

In 1952 a new plan was launched by parliament to electrify {{convert|1153|km|mi}} of railway, with the line from Voss to H<U+00F8>nefoss prioritized fourth. The following year NSB launched the "away with the steam"-campaign, that would replace all [[steam locomotive]]s with electric or [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] traction. Since electrification was not imminent, NSB introduced diesel traction on the Bergen Line in 1958, predominantly using [[NSB Di 3|Di 3]] stock. Travel time between the two termini was reduced by about one hour. During summer the [[NSB BM66|type 66]] [[diesel multiple unit]]s were put into service, but they were not heavy enough to cope with winter and thus only served during the summer months.<ref>Holb<U+00F8>, 1984: 95<U+2013>98</ref> The line was electrified in four stages, from Roa to H<U+00F8>nefoss on 1 February 1961, from H<U+00F8>nefoss to <U+00C5>l on 1 December 1962, from <U+00C5>l to Ustadoset on 15 December 1963 and finally from Ustadoset to Voss on 7 December 1964.<ref name=jbvstat33 /> As the point of electrification moved across the mountain, so did the point NSB changed locomotive on the train. The new locomotive [[NSB El 13|El 13]] was put into service on the electric parts. The electrification cost NOK 143 million.<ref>R<U+00F8>dland, 1999: 103</ref>

The express trains have as one of the main lines always been allocated the newest locomotives by NSB. When the [[NSB El 14|El 14]] was delivered in 1968,<ref>Aspenberg, 2001: 102</ref> it was put into service on Bergensbanen, as was the [[NSB El 16|El 16]] in 1977,<ref>Aspenberg, 2001: 115</ref> the [[NSB El 17|El 17]] in 1981,<ref>Aspenberg, 2001: 118</ref> and finally the [[NSB El 18|El 18]] in 1996.<ref>Aspenberg, 2001: 122</ref> The older locomotives have been relegated to freight service. In 2000 [[electric multiple unit]]s were put into service with the [[NSB BM73|type 73]] [[tilting train]]s, branded as [[NSB Signatur|Signatur]] and capable of {{convert|210|km/h|mph}}. However, they cannot be used at those speed on any part of the Bergen Line, and only some parts of the [[Asker Line]] and around Finse can they operate quicker than the locomotive hauled trains.<ref>Aspenberg, 2001: 188</ref>

===Through the first mountain===
{{main|Ulriken Tunnel}}
The first {{convert|32|km|mi}} form Bergen to Takvam represented a very roundabout way, and it was clear that it would be possible to reduce the line by {{convert|21|km|mi}} with the construction of three tunnels, [[Ulriken Tunnel]] ({{convert|7660|m|ft|disp=s}}), [[Arnanipa Tunnel]] ({{convert|2177|m|ft|disp=s}}) and Tunestveit Tunnel ({{convert|40|m|ft|disp=s}}).<ref>Norsk Jernbaneklubb, 1994</ref> The idea was approved by parliament in 1956, based on private financing from the businessperson [[Fritz Rieber]]. Construction started in 1959 with the tunnels being finished in 1963 while the tracks were finished laid on 29 May 1964 when the first train entered the tunnel.<ref>Hol<U+00F8>s, 1984: 101<U+2013>02</ref> 

Rieber has suggested a package for the politicians, where he would create a company that would borrow money to build both the Ulriken Tunnel, a shortening of the line from H<U+00F8>nefoss to Sandvika (the [[Ringerike Line]]) and electrify the railway. Since NSB based their fares on the route length traveled, financing would be covered by a surcharge equal to the distance saved; ticket price would remain the same and within twenty years the debt would be covered. The government opposed the suggestion<U+2014>[[Trygve Bratteli]] commenting that even though the financing was private, it would still have to use the same funding as government debt, and would jeopardize other projects, like the [[Nordland Line]].<ref>R<U+00F8>dland, 1999: 98<U+2013>102</ref>

In 1980 the [[Oslo Tunnel]] was opened, allowing trains along the Drammen Line to go to the new [[Oslo Central Station]], an upgrade of the former Oslo <U+00D8>. As a consequence of this, passenger trains were since the late 1980s rerouted via Drammen instead of via Roa, following the [[Drammen Line]] and the Randsfjord Line to H<U+00F8>nefoss. This allows the trains to pass through more densely populated areas and on trackage with more capacity. However, the change of route actually increased the length between the two termini with {{convert|23|km|mi}}. But the better track standard via Drammen results in about the same travel time. Freight trains still goes via Roa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/jernbanenettet/stasjonssok/stasjonsoversikt/article.jhtml?articleID=1488717 |title=H<U+00F8>nefoss stasjon |author=Jernbaneverket |accessdate=2008-05-29 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

[[Image:Bergensbanen.jpg|right|thumb|Freight train about to enter the Finse tunnel]]
{{main|Finse Tunnel}}
During winter NSB had large costs keeping the line snow-free. Large diesel-electric snowploughs were stationed at [[Finse]], and tens of kilometers of snow sheds were built on the most vulnerable parts. Especially the {{convert|22|km|mi}} part between [[Finse Station]] and [[Hallingskeid]] was a tear on resources, and heavy snowfall and drifts regularly closed the entire line. A solution was proposed by NSB's director [[Robert Nord<U+00E9>n]] in 1984, involving construction of a {{convert|10.5|km|mi}} tunnel between the two stations.<ref name="dland2">R<U+00F8>dland, 1999: 15<U+2013>34</ref>

In 1989 the [[Stortinget|Norwegian Parliament]] approved the plans, including the upgrade of part of the line east of Finse. In total NOK 750 million was invested in rebuilding {{convert|32|km|mi}} of line, shortening it by {{convert|4.5|km|mi}}. At the same time the permitted speed could be increased from {{convert|70|km/h|mph}} to {{convert|170|km/h|mph}}. The tunnel opened on 16 June 1992 while the rest of the upgrades opened in five steps in the period 1995<U+2013>98. The highest point of the line was reduced from {{convert|1301|m|ft}} to {{convert|1237|m|ft}}<U+2014>located inside the tunnel.<ref name="dland2"/> After the opening the base for snow removal was closed at Finse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/jernbanenettet/stasjonssok/stasjonsoversikt/article.jhtml?articleID=1488729 |author=[[Jernbaneverket]] |title=Finse stasjon |accessdate=2008-05-28 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

==Operation==
Bergensbanen as a through line is used for up to five express trains operated by [[Norges Statsbaner]], as well as freight trains by [[CargoNet]]. From Myrdal to bergen there are commuter rail services operated by NSB.

===Line===
The total distance from Oslo to Bergen via Drammen is {{convert|493|km|mi}}, while Bergensbanen proper is {{convert|372|km|mi}}.<ref name=jbvstat6 /> The line has 182 tunnels,<ref name=jbvstat6 /> totaling ca. {{convert|73|km|mi}}, of which ten are over {{convert|2.0|km|mi}}.<ref>Jernbaneverket, 2007: 26</ref> [[Finse Station]] remains the highest elevated station at {{convert|1222.2|m|ft}}, while the highest point is in the Finse Tunnel at {{convert|1237|m|ft}}.<ref name="dland1"/>  The steepest gradient is on the Voss-Myrdal stretch, at 1:46.5.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

===Commuter rail===
[[Image:Trengereid stasjon.JPG|thumb|An NSB [[NSB BM69|type 69]] passing [[Trengereid Station]]]]
{{main|Bergen Commuter Rail}}
NSB operates a commuter rail service from Bergen with two hourly departures to Arna, plus fourteen daily departures to Voss, of which up to six continue to Myrdal. Rolling stock is the [[NSB BM69|type 69]] multiple units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsb.no/getfile.php/www.nsb.no/nsb.no/PDF/Rutetabeller/Norsk/Ruter%20fra%2015.06.08/045-Bergen-Voss-Myrdal-2008-nynorsk.pdf |title=Bergen - Voss - Myrdal |author=[[Norges Statsbaner]] |date=2008 |accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> The first part to Arna represents an important part of the public transport in Bergen, since the rail direct line through the mountain [[Ulriken]] is considerably faster than driving around. 

===Express service===
Express trains operated by NSB have always been the primary passenger service on Bergensbanen. Passenger trains follow the Drammen Line and the Asker Line to Drammen, before heading north to H<U+00F8>nefoss on the Randsfjord Line. The express trains offer both transport from villages along the line to either Bergen or Oslo, as well travel between Norway's two largest cities. Up to two day trains are provided with [[NSB BM73|type 73]] multiple units, while the remaining services are with locomotive hauled trains. Six nights a week there is a [[NSB Night Train|night train]] service. Several parts of the line service places without road access, such as Finse and Myrdal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsb.no/getfile.php/www.nsb.no/nsb.no/PDF/Rutetabeller/Norsk/Ruter%20fra%2015.06.08/041-Oslo-Bergen-2008.pdf |title=Oslo S-Bergen |author=Norges Statsbaner |date=2008 |accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> Operating deficits are covered by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/SD/Vedlegg/Jernbane/trafikkavtalen_2007-2010.pdf |title=Avtale om utf<U+00F8>relse av persontransport med tog |author=[[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications]] |date=2007-01-23 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Freight===
Freight trains are operated by [[CargoNet]], hauled by [[NSB El 14|El 14]] and [[NSB El 16|El 16]] locomotives. Most transport is from the terminal at Alnabru in Oslo to the terminal at Bergen Station. Freight trains use the Roa-H<U+00F8>nefoss Line instead of going via Drammen since it is shorter<U+2014>distance is more important than speed for freight trains. CargoNet operates up to four daily trains from Oslo, plus one from Drammen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cargonet.no/epibrowser/Dokument/ProduktblNo%20og%20No-Sv%20strekninger/Bergen-6jan08.pdf |title=Produktblad Bergen |date=2008-01-06 |author=[[CargoNet]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Rail freight on Bergensbanen increased by 80% from 2001<U+2013>05, but further growth is not possible without better infrastructure; CargoNet has indicated they want five more [[passing loop]]s, as well as extending them to increase train length from {{convert|400|m|ft}} to {{convert|600|m|ft}}, claiming they could double freight traffic with adequate infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hallingdolen.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071114/LOKALENYHEITER/711150003 |author=[[Hallingd<U+00F8>len]] |title=Vil satse milliarder p<U+00E5> gods |accessdate=2008-06-03 |language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://samferdsel.toi.no/article19265-992.html |author=[[Institute of Transport Economics]] |title=Mer gods p<U+00E5> jernbane - et sp<U+00F8>rsm<U+00E5>l om kvalitet |date=2006 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Heritage===
Parts of the closed sections of Vossebanen, from [[Midttun]] to [[Garnes]] has been converted to a [[heritage railway]]<U+2014>the [[Old Voss Line]]<U+2014>that is operated with steam trains by the [[Norwegian Railway Association]] during the summer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.njk.no/vossebanen/index.php?d=2&m=15&s=16&ID=1397 |title=Gamle Vossebanen Steam Railway |author=[[Norsk Jernbaneklubb]] |accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> At Finse there is a navvy museum, and the old navvy road has become a cycle track.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rallarmuseet.no/ |title=Rallarmuseet |author=Rallarmuseet |accessdate=2008-05-29 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The branch [[Fl<U+00E5>m Line]] has been converted to a tourist route. The railway has spectacular scenery and a vertical decent of {{convert|864|m|ft}} or 5.5% along the {{convert|20|km|mi}} route from Myrdal to Fl<U+00E5>m. Operation is still performed by NSB, but marketing is performed by [[Fl<U+00E5>m Utvikling]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flaamsbana.no/eng/Index.html |title=The Fl<U+00E5>m Railway |author=[[Fl<U+00E5>m Utvikling]] |accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> The stock used on the railway are [[NSB El 17|El 17]] hauling [[NSB B3|B3]] wagons, all painted green.<ref>Aspenberg, 2001: 118<U+2013>21</ref>

==Future propositions==
[[Image:Proposed map of Ringeriksbanen.gif|thumb|upright|Map of the proposed [[Ringeriksbanen]] that would shorten Bergensbanen by 60 km.]]
===Upgrades===
[[Ulriken Tunnel]] represents the largest bottleneck on the Bergen Line, due to the commuter trains to Arna. Building [[double track]] on the westernmost part of Bergensbanen would free up capacity not only of that part of the line, but the whole line across the mountains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/multimedia/archive/01620/KU_dobbeltspor_Arn_1620621a.pdf |title=Konsekvcensutredning Arna - Fl<U+00F8>en |author=Jernbaneverket |date=2008 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The original plans for Bergensbanen from 1894 included the construction of a new line<U+2014>the [[Ringerike Line]]<U+2014>from H<U+00F8>nefoss to [[Sandvika Station|Sandvika]] just west of Oslo. This line would reduce the distance on Bergensbanen by {{convert|60|km|mi}} and 50 minutes travel time. There has been a continual decision to build this railway line, but it has never received any funding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/prosjekter/planlagte/Ringeriksbanen/ |title=Bergensbanens forkortelse, Ringeriksbanen |author=Jernbaneverket |accessdate=2008-05-28 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> These plans were discussed more after 2000, and a detailed plan has been done. Combined with other improvements totaling investments of NOK 7 billion, travel time could be reduced to four and a half hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/incoming/article.jhtml?articleID=1692566 |title=Rask og effektiv Bergensbane for sju milliarder |author=Jernbaneverket |accessdate=2008-05-28 |language=Norwegina}}</ref>. The project is included in the long-term plan for Norwegian railways, to be built around year 2020<U+2013>30. This date is not decided.

===Closing===
In 2002 the Norwegian National Rail Administration warned that lack of funding might lead to a closure of all long-distance passenger trains in Norway, including the Bergen Line. [[Torild Skogsholm]], [[Minister of Transport and Communications (Norway)|Minister of Transport and Communications]] assured that it was not the government's policy to close railway lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/distrikt/sor_trondelag/nyheter/1684825.html |title=Skjebnevalg for norsk jernbane Choice of fate for Norwegian Railways |author=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK S<U+00F8>r-Tr<U+00F8>ndelag]] |date=2002-02-28 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 2004 the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] suggested closing down the railway line and replacing it with a motorway between Bergen and Oslo, arguing that the railway was unprofitable, and that bus transport was cheaper while easier truck transport would aid business. Other political parties rejected the proposal pointing out the better environmental performance of the railway and that the railway transports large volumes of freight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.no/innenriks/article53238.ece |title=Frp: - Steng Bergensbanen (Progress Party: "Close the Bergen Railway") |author=[[Bergens Tidende]] |date=2004-01-16 |language=Norwegain}}</ref>

===High-speed rail===
{{main|High-speed rail in Norway}}
Several suggestions for high-speed rail from Oslo to Bergen have been launched. Preliminary studied performed for the National Rail Administration with positive [[cost-benefit ratio]]s on building high-speed rail from Oslo to Bergen. The most suitable route would approximately follow the existing route (but a new tunnel Oslo<U+2013>H<U+00F8>nefoss). Oslo<U+2013>Trondheim and Oslo<U+2013>Halden are assumed to be built earlier because of lower cost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/english/article.jhtml?articleID=1590400 |title=Highspeed -lines: Further steps should be taken |author=[[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] |date=2008-05-13}}</ref> Two lobbyist suggestions to the route have also been launched. The one involves a "high-speed ring" from Oslo, via Numedal to Geilo, then following Bergensbanen to Bergen and continuing south to [[Stavanger]] and back to Oslo via [[Kristiansand]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hhringen.no/ |title=H<U+00F8>yhastighetsringen |author=H<U+00F8>yhastighetsringen |accessdate=2008-05-28 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> [[Norsk Bane]] has launched the idea of building a common line from Oslo to [[Haukeli]] and then from branching off to Bergen and Stavanger.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norskbane.no/haukeli_b.htm |author=[[Norsk Bane]] |title=Haukelibanen |accessdate=2008-05-28 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Such long-distance high-speed railways are not included in the preliminary long-term plan for 2010<U+2013>2040, and it is likely that railways Hamar<U+2013>Trondheim and Drammen<U+2013>Kristansand will be built first since they are is easier to build. It is likely that a high-speed railway to Bergen will built sometimes in the period 2030<U+2013>2060.
