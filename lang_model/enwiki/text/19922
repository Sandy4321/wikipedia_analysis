'''Abdelaziz Bouteflika''' ({{IPA-ar|<U+0295>a<U+02D0>bd l<U+0295>ziz butfliqa<U+02D0>}}; {{lang-ar|<U+0639><U+0628><U+062F> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0639><U+0632><U+064A><U+0632> <U+0628><U+0648><U+062A><U+0641><U+0644><U+064A><U+0642><U+0629>}}) (born March 2, 1937) is the [[List of presidents of Algeria#Presidents|ninth]] [[President of Algeria]]. He has been in office since 1999. He continued [[emergency rule]] until 24 February 2011, and presided over the end of the bloody [[Algerian Civil War]] in 2002. More recently, thousands in [[Algiers]] have marched calling for his resignation during the [[2010<U+2013>2011 Algerian protests]] following the successful [[2011 Tunisian revolution|popular uprising]] in Tunisia to oust [[Ben Ali]].

He has also served as president of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

== Family ==

Abdelaziz Bouteflika was born on March 2, 1937 in  [[Oujda]], [[Morocco]].<ref name=birth>{{cite book|last=Roger East, Richard Thomas|title=Profiles of people in power: the world's government leaders|year=2003|publisher=Europa Publications|isbn=185743126X|pages=7}}

</ref> 
He was the first child of his mother and the second child of his father (Fatima, his half-sister, preceded him). His father (Ahmed Bouteflika) and mother (Mansouria Ghezlaoui) originated from the region of [[Tlemcen]].<ref name=nahar/> Bouteflika has three half-sisters (Fatima, Yamina, and A<U+00EF>cha), as well as four brothers (Abdelghani, Mustapha, Abderahim and Sa<U+00EF>d) and one sister (Latifa). Sa<U+00EF>d serves as Abdelaziz Bouteflika's personal physician, and is said by some to be an important figure in Bouteflika's inner circle of advisers.

== Early years and War of Independence ==
Bouteflika was raised in [[Oujda]], where his father had emigrated as a youngster.<ref name=nahar/> He successively attended three schools there: "Sidi Ziane", "El Hoceinia" and the "Abdel Moumen" high-school, where he reportedly excelled academically.<ref name=nahar/> He was also affiliated with Kadiri [[Zaouia]] in Oujda.<ref name=nahar/> 

In 1956, Bouteflika went to the village of Ouled Amer near [[Tlemcen]] and subsequently joined -at the age of 19- the [[Arm<U+00E9>e de Lib<U+00E9>ration Nationale|Army of National Liberation]] which was a military branch of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National liberation Front]] party. He was militarily instructed at the "Ecole des Cadres" in [[Dar El Kebdani]], [[Morocco]].<ref name=nahar/> In 1957-1958, He was designated a controller of the Wilaya V,<ref name=nahar/> making reports on the conditions at the Moroccan border and in west Algeria, but later became the administrative secretary of [[Houari Boum<U+00E9>dienne]]. He emerged as one of the closest collaborators of the influential Boum<U+00E9>dienne, and a core member of his [[Oujda group]]. In 1962, at the arrival of [[independence]], he aligned with Boum<U+00E9>dienne and the border armies in support of [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] against the [[Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic]].

==Post-independence political career==
[[Image:Hussein Assad Bouteflika Khaddam.jpg|thumb|right|Bouteflika in the 1970s with [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Hafez al-Assad]]]]

After Algeria's independence in 1962, Bouteflika became deputy of Tlemcen in the Constituent Assembly and Minister for Youth and Sport in the government led by [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. The following year, he was appointed as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and would remain in the post until the death of President [[Houari Boum<U+00E9>dienne]] in 1978.

He was also President of the 29th UN General Assembly in 1974 and that of the Seventh special session in 1975. While in these posts he came in for severe criticism from US for what were regarded as politically partisan decisions.

In 1981, he was sued for having stolen Algerian embassies money between 1965 and 1979. On the 8th of August 1983, Bouteflika was convicted by The Court of Financial Auditors and found guilty of having fraudulently taken 60 million dinars during his diplomatic career.

In his defence Bouteflika said that he ''reserved'' that money to build a new building for the foreign affairs ministry, the court judged his argument as ''fallacious''. In 1979, just after the death of Boum<U+00E9>di<U+00E8>ne, Bouteflika reimbursed 12 212 875, 81 out of the 70 millions that was put in a Swiss bank. Although Bouteflika was granted amnesty by the president Chadli Bendjedid, his colleagues Senouci and Boudjakdji were jailed.

After the amnesty, Bouteflika was given back his diplomatic passport, a villa where he used to live but did not own, and all his debt was erased. He never paid back the money "he reserved for a new foreign affairs ministry's building".<ref>El Moudjahid newspaper, 09th of August 1983</ref>

==Succession struggle and exile==

On Boum<U+00E9>dienne's unexpected death in 1978, Bouteflika was seen as one of the two main candidates to succeed the powerful president. Bouteflika was thought to represent the party's "right wing" that was more open to economic reform and rapprochement with the West. Colonel [[Mohamed Salah Yahiaoui]] represented the "boum<U+00E9>diennist" left wing.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920107-1,00.html New Leader - TIME<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> In the end, the military opted for a compromise candidate, the senior army colonel [[Chadli Bendjedid]]. Bouteflika was reassigned the role of Minister of State, but successively lost power as Bendjedid's policies of "de-Boum<U+00E9>diennisation" marginalized the old guard.

After six years abroad, the army brought him back to the  Central Committee of the FLN in 1989, after the country had entered a troubled period of unrest and disorganized attempts at reform, with power-struggles between Bendjedid and a group of army generals paralyzing decision-making. In 1992, the reform process ended abruptly when the army took power and scrapped elections that were about to bring the fundamentalist [[Islamic Salvation Front]] to power. This triggered a civil war that would last throughout the 1990s. During this period, Bouteflika stayed on the sidelines, with little presence in the media and no political role. In January 1994, Bouteflika is said to have refused the [[Algerian Army|Army]]<U+2019>s proposal to succeed the assassinated president, [[Mohamed Boudiaf]]; he claimed later that this was because the army would not grant him full control over the armed forces. Instead, General [[Liamine Z<U+00E9>roual]] became President.

==First term as President, 1999<U+2013>2004==
[[Image:G8 family photo 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Abdelaziz Bouteflika in the G8 family photo 2010]]
[[Image:Dmitry Medvedev in the United States 25 September 2009-1.jpg|thumb|right|Abdelaziz Bouteflika meets [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in the United States 25 September 2009]]
In 1999, Z<U+00E9>roual unexpectedly stepped down and announced early elections. The reasons behind his decision remain unclear, but it is widely claimed that his pro-reconciliation policies towards the Islamist insurgency had incurred the wrath of a hard-line faction in the armed forces; or that some other disagreement with the military, which still dominated politics, lay behind the schism. Bouteflika ran for President as an independent candidate, supported by the military. He was elected with 74% of the votes, according to the official count. All other candidates withdrew from the election immediately prior to the vote, citing fraud concerns. Bouteflika subsequently organized a [[referendum]] on his policies to restore peace and security to [[Algeria]] (involving [[amnesty|amnesties]] for [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]]) and to test his support among his countrymen after the contested election. He won with 81% of the vote, but this figure was also disputed by opponents.

===Economics===

During his first mandate Bouteflika launched a five year economic plan (2000<U+2013>2004), called the Support Plan for Economic Recovery (PSRE: Plan de Soutien <U+00E0> la Relance Economique). The plan was a package of various sub-plans such as the National Plan for Agricultural Development (PNDA: Plan National pour le D<U+00E9>veloppement Agricole), aimed at boosting agricultural production. Other sub-plans included the construction of social housing units, roads, and other infrastructure projects. The PSRE totalled $7 billion worth of spending, and gave satisfactory results with the economy averaging higher than 5% annual growth rates, with a peak of 6.3% in the year 2003. Bouteflika also pushed through a fiscal reform which contributed to the economic revival.

===Foreign policy===

Bouteflika was also active on the international scene, presiding over what many have characterized as Algeria's return to international affairs, after almost a decade of international isolation. He presided over the [[African Union]] in 2000 and secured the [[Algiers Peace Treaty]] between [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]], and supported peace efforts in the [[African Great Lakes]] region. He also secured a friendship treaty with neighbouring [[Spain]] in 2002, and welcomed president [[Jacques Chirac|Chirac]] of [[France]] on a state visit to [[Algiers]] in 2003. This was intended as a prelude to the signature of a friendship treaty.

Algeria has been particularly active in African relations, and in mending ties with the West, as well as trying to some extent to resurrect its role in the declining non-Aligned movement. However, it has played a more limited role in Arab politics, its other traditional sphere of interest. Relations with the [[Kingdom of Morocco]] remained quite tense, with diplomatic clashes on the issue of the [[Western Sahara]], despite some expectations of a thaw in 1999, which was also the year of [[Mohamed VI]]'s accession to the throne in Morocco.

== Second term as President, 2004<U+2013>09 ==

On April 8, 2004, he was re-elected by an unexpectedly high 85% of the vote in an [[Algerian presidential election, 2004|election]] that was accepted by [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] observers as a free and fair election, despite minor irregularities. This was contested by his rival and former Chief of Staff [[Ali Benflis]]. Several opponents alleged that the election had not been fair, and pointed to extensive state control over the broadcast media. The electoral victory was widely seen as a confirmation of Bouteflika's strengthened control over the state apparatus, and many saw the following retirement of longtime armed forces commander Gen. [[Mohammed Lamari]] in the light of this. He and military commanders allied to him were thought to have opposed Bouteflika's bid for a second term and backed Benflis. Other major military power-brokers would be reassigned to minor posts or withdraw from politics in the years that followed, underlining Bouteflika's gradual monopolizing of decision-making.

The [[Kabyles|Kabyle]] population [[election boycott|boycotted the election]]; participation did not exceed 11%.

===Reconciliation plan===
[[Image:A.Bouteflika.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Poster of Abdelaziz Bouteflika in the suburbs of [[Algiers]]]]
During the first year of his second term, President Bouteflika held [[Algerian national reconciliation referendum, 2005|a referendum]] on his "[[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]]", inspired by the 1995 "[[Sant'Egidio Platform]]" document. Bouteflika's plan aims at concluding his efforts of ending the [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]], from a political and judicial point of view. He obtained large popular support with this referendum and has since instructed the government and [[Politics of Algeria#Legislative branch|Parliament]] to work on the technical details of its implementation. Critics claimed that the plan will only grant immunity to members of the [[Military of Algeria|armed forces]] responsible for crimes, as well as to [[terrorism|terrorists]] and have argued for a plan similar to [[South Africa]]'s "truth and reconciliation commission" to be adopted instead. Bouteflika dismissed the calls, claiming that each country needs to find its own solutions to ending painful chapters of its history. He has received large political support on this issue, from both the [[Islamism|Islamist]] and the [[Nationalism|Nationalist]] camps, and from parts of the [[Democracy|Democrat]]ic opposition.

The amnesty plan was rejected by the main remaining insurgent group, the [[Al-Qaeda Organisation in the Islamic Maghreb|GSPC]], although perhaps as many as several hundred fighters still left their hideouts to claim amnesty. The group's warfare against the Algerian state continues despite reconciliation plan, although Bouteflika's government claims it has had an impact in removing support for the group. In 2006, the GSPC was officially accepted as a branch of al-Qaida in a video message by [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]]; soon thereafter, it changed its name to [[al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb]] (AQIM). Bouteflika has kept the amnesty option open&nbsp;<U+2013> apparently open-ended despite the end of the deadline stipulated by the reconciliation law&nbsp;<U+2013> while simultaneously pursuing the rebel group militarily. Algerian forces have scored several major captures of GSPC/AQIM commanders, but the groups top leadership remains at large, and armed activity is frequent in [[Kabylie]], with AQIM-connected smuggling networks active in parts of the desert south. Unlike in previous years, AQIM have begun using [[suicide attack]] tactics and in 2007-2008 launched several major attacks in Algiers and other big cities.

===Economic policies===

The first year of Bouteflika's second term also featured a new five year plan, much larger this time drafted.<!--what does this clause mean?--> The Complementary Plan for Economic Growth Support (PCSC: Plan Complementaire de la Croissance Economique) aims for the construction of 1 million housing units, the creation of 2 million jobs, the completion of the [[Algeria East-West Highway|East-West highway]], the completion of the Algiers subway project, the delivery of the new [[Algiers airport]], and other similar large scale infrastructure projects. The PCSC totals $60 billion of spending over the five year period.  Bouteflika also aims to bring down the external debt from $21 billion to $12 billion in the same time. He has also obtained from Parliament the reform of the law governing the [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] industries, despite initial opposition from the [[trade union|workers unions]].  However, Bouteflika has since stepped back from this position, supporting amendments to the hydrocarbon law in 2006, which propose watering down some of the clauses of the 2005 legislation relating to the role of [[Sonatrach]], the state owned oil & gas company, in new developments.  It also proposes new provisions enabling the country to benefit from windfall taxes on foreign investors in times of high prices. Bouteflika has also put up for sale 1300 public sector companies, and has already achieved [[privatization]] of about 150 of them, mainly in the tourism, food processing, cement, construction material and chemical industries.

=== Foreign policy ===

On the international scene, Bouteflika's second term has seen diplomatic tensions rise with France due to the controversial voting by the [[French Parliament]] of a law ordering French history school books to teach that [[French colonialism|French colonisation]] had positive effects abroad, especially in [[North Africa]]. The diplomatic crisis which ensued has put on hold the signing of a friendship treaty with France (February 23, 2004, re-endorsed in December 2005). Ties to Russia have been strengthened by large imports of Russian military hardware&nbsp;<U+2013> about 7 billion USD were spent in one single purchase&nbsp;<U+2013> although relations entered a rocky phase, at least temporarily, when Algeria refused to accept some MiG fighter jets due to their allegedly poor quality. Rumors of the two countries negotiating a form of [[cartel]] for [[natural gas]], similar to OPEC's role in oil affairs, with Iran and Qatar also involved, have appeared repeatedly, and Bouteflika has confirmed an interest in the idea. (Russia is the no. 1 gas supplier to the EU, and Algeria the no. 2 supplier.) Bouteflika has also carefully cultivated a relationship with China, with exchanges of state visits between the two countries.

Algeria has remained involved in Arab affairs, and seen a somewhat growing role there. In 2004 Bouteflika also organised the [[Arab League]] Summit and became President of the [[Arab League]] for one year. His calls for reform of the League did not gain sufficient support to pass in during the Algiers summit however. Like in previous years since the late 1980s, Algeria has kept a relatively low profile in the Palestine and Iraq issues. Algeria has remained preoccupied with the Western Sahara issue, counter-lobbying Moroccan attempts to gain international acceptance for Moroccan-ruled [[autonomy]] in the disputed territory, at the expense of Polisario's (and Algeria's) calls for the long-since decided [[self-determination]] referendum to finally be held. Relations with Morocco therefore remain poor, and Algeria in 2008 repeatedly refused to answer Moroccan demands to open the common land border, which has been closed since 1994. Both Morocco and Algeria have since approximately 2005 spent several billion dollars in what could be described as an arms race between them, mainly on modernizing and expanding their air forces.

In sub-Saharan Africa, a major concern of Bouteflika's Algeria has been on-and-off [[Taureg people|Tuareg]] rebellions in northern [[Mali]]. Algeria has asserted itself forcefully as mediator in the conflict, perhaps underlining its growing regional influence. Algerian interest is driven by its extensive interests in the region: smuggling routes as well as legal economic activity crosses these virtually unguarded borderlands, and refugees from the conflict have entered southern Algeria to mix with the [[Taureg people|Tuareg]] populations there. Also, the area is known as a hideout of a southern branch of AQIM, further heightening Algeria's interest in the area. Compromise peace agreements were reached in 2007 and 2008, both mediated by Algiers. The related Touareg revolt in neighbouring [[Niger]] has not seen the same Algerian involvement, even if the anti-government MNJ movement has on at least one occasion called for Algerian mediation similar to in Mali. Algeria's involvement in Africa has otherwise been concerned with supporting the [[African Union]], and been marked by a rapidly strengthening coordination with [[South Africa]], which, among other things, has emerged as Algeria's main ally on the Western Sahara issue.

All in all, Algeria's foreign policy under Bouteflika remains hinged on same axis as under earlier governments, emphasizing South-South ties, especially with growing Third World powers ([[China]], [[South Africa]], [[Brazil]], etc.) and guarding the country's independence in decision-making visavis the West, although simultaneously striving for good trade relations and non-confrontational political relations with the EU and USA.

[[President of Vietnam]] [[Nguyen Minh Triet]] on July 16, 2009 met with Bouteflika on the sidelines of the 15th [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM) summit in [[Egypt]]. President Triet and Bouteflika agreed that the two countries still have great potential for development of political and trade relations. Triet thanked the Algerian government for creating favourable conditions for the [[Vietnam]] Oil and Gas Group to invest in oil and gas exploration and exploitation in Algeria.<ref>[http://english.vietnamnet.vn/politics/2009/07/858636/ VN President meets Algerian leader in Egypt]</ref>

===Hospitalization in 2005 ===

Bouteflika was admitted to a hospital in France on 26 November 2005, reportedly suffering from a [[gastric ulcer hemorrhage]], and discharged three weeks later.<ref>Aomar Ouali, [http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1852444,00.html "Bouteflika 'completely healed'"], Associated Press (news24.com), December 18, 2005.</ref> However, the length of time for which Bouteflika remained virtually incommunicado led to rumours that he was critically ill with stomach cancer.<ref>[http://www.middle-east-online.com/ENGLISH/algeria/?id=15240 middle-east-online.com], no author, date 2005-12-15</ref>  He checked into the hospital again in April 2006.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4926128.stm "Algeria leader in French hospital"], BBC News, 20 April 2006</ref>

A leaked diplomatic cable reveals that by the end of 2008, Bouteflika had developed stomach cancer.<ref>http://213.251.145.96/cable/2007/12/07ALGIERS1806.html</ref>

===Constitutional amendment for a third term===

Bouteflika appointed a new Prime Minister, [[Abdelaziz Belkhadem]], in 2006.  Belkhadem then announced plans to amend the [[Algerian Constitution]] to allow the President to run for office indefinitely and increase his powers.<ref>[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=85&art_id=qw1148593502813B242 iol.co.za], by Hassane Meftahi, May 26, 2006; and [http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=392253 liberation.fr] (in French)</ref> This was widely regarded as aimed to let Bouteflika run for president a third term, and he has not denied that he plans to do so. A referendum was originally scheduled for 2007, but cancelled for reasons never explained. In 2008, Belkhadem was again shifted out of the premiership and his predecessor [[Ahmed Ouyahia]] brought in, having also come out in favor of the constitutional amendment. A constitutional amendment is believed to be planned for 2008&nbsp;<U+2013> before the term expires&nbsp;<U+2013> in the form of a referendum or a parliamentary vote. Observers predict an easy win for Bouteflika in both cases, if he manages to retain the loyalty of major powerbrokers: forces loyal to him dominate the parliament, and he had no trouble winning the presidential election in 2004 by a wide margin. Even so, the proposed amendment remains hotly debated and controversial in Algerian political circles, with many in opposition groups describing it as an undemocratic attempt to further strengthen Bouteflika's personal rule.

The Council of Ministers announced on 3 November 2008 that the planned constitutional revision proposal would remove the presidential term limit previously included in Article 74.<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hWFj--4hc0uaqUAsqgE20UYdruHA "Alg<U+00E9>rie: vers la suppression de la limitation des mandats pr<U+00E9>sidentiels"], AFP, 3 November 2008 {{fr icon}}.</ref> The [[People's National Assembly]] endorsed the removal of the term limit on 12 November 2008; only the [[Rally for Culture and Democracy]] (RCD) voted against its removal.<ref name=Pathetic>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jI1Crc3dM4TjP7NncwbLBC-1bFSg "Algerian opposition pulls out of 'pathetic' presidential vote"], AFP, 15 January 2009.</ref>

==Third term as President, 2009<U+2013>present==
Following the constitutional amendment allowing him to run for a third term, on 12 February 2009, Bouteflika announced his independent candidacy in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]].<ref>[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=85&art_id=nw20090212164058471C414688 "Bouteflika seeks third term in office"], Reuters (''IOL''), 12 February 2009.</ref> On April 10, 2009, it was announced that Bouteflika had won the election with 90.24% of the vote, on a turnout of 74%,<ref name="reuters1">[http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/04/10/us-algeria-vote-idUSTRE5391K520090410 Bouteflika wins third term as Algerian president] - reuters, 10 Apr 2009</ref> thereby obtaining a new five-year term. Several opposition parties had boycotted the election, with the opposition [[Socialist Forces Front]] citing a "tsunami of massive fraud."<ref name="reuters1" />
