'''Yusril Ihza Mahendra''' (born [[February 5]], [[1956]] in [[Belitung]], [[South Sumatra]]) is an [[Indonesia]]n [[politician]]. Yusril was formerly the chairman of [[Crescent Star Party]] (PBB). 

==Early life==
Yusril Ihza Mahendra was born on 5th February 1956 to Idris Haji Sainal and Norsiha <ref>[http://www.freelists.org/archives/ppi/09-2006/msg00254.html FreeLists / ppi / [ppi&#93; [ppiindia&#93; Yusril Nikahi Gadis Belia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in Manggar, Bangka Belitung.

After completing his primary and secondary education, Yusril left for [[Jakarta]] in 1976 to attend the University of Indonesia (UI). To compensate for living costs, Yusril had to lodge at various [[mosque]]s in the city. In addition to that, Yusril had to find part time work to fund his studies. Yusril took on various jobs, becoming a tutor in teaching children in reading the [[koran]], teaching [[martial arts]], and selling fishes and coconuts <ref>[http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/y/yusril-ihza-mahendra/menkeh.shtml Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Menteri Kehakiman dan HAM | Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

Throughout this period, Yusril became close with his lecturer, [[Professor]] Usman. In turn, Usman would introduce Yusril to his political hero, [[Mohammad Natsir]] <ref>[http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/y/yusril-ihza-mahendra/menkeh.shtml Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Menteri Kehakiman dan HAM | Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Natsir was an Islamist politician, former Prime Minister of Indonesia, and Chairman of the Indonesian Muslims Advisory Council (Masyumi), a major Muslim Party that had rivalled [[Nahdlatul Ulama]] (NU) in the 1950s.

Yusril also began to involve himself in organizational activities. In 1981, he became Vice Chairman of the Indonesian Youth Mosque Communication Body. A position which he held until 1982.

==Academic career==
In 1982, Yusril graduated with a [[Bachelor's Degree]] in [[Philosophy]] and followed it up the next year with a [[Bachelor's Degree]] in Governance <ref>[http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/y/yusril-ihza-mahendra/menkeh.shtml Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Menteri Kehakiman dan HAM | Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Following this, Yusril became a lecturer at the [[Muhammadiyah]] University in Jakarta (UMJ), and at the Socialization Skills Academy in the Ministry of Justice. In the meantime, Yusril attended [[postgraduate]] studies.

Yusril then went to [[India]] to attend the [[University of the Punjab]]. In 1984, Yusril graduated with a [[Master's Degree]] in Humanities and Social Science. When he returned to Indonesia, Yusril became a lecturer for UI and UMJ. At UI, Yusril was involved in the law faculty and taught postgraduate courses.

In 1993, Yusril graduated from the [[University of Science]], [[Malaysia]] and became a [[Doctor of Philosphy]].

==Organizational Experiences and Early Governmental Career==
Yusril's Islamist views meant that his scope was not just limited to the academic world. In 1996, Yusril became a member of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Islamic [[Dawah]] Council (DDII). At the same time, he became Chairman of the Legal Department of the Jakarta Branch of the Union of Indonesian Intellectual Muslims (ICMI) while serving as Vice Chairman of the ICMI Council of Experts.

Also in 1996, Yusril was employed by President [[Suharto]] as a [[speechwriter]]. Yusril would go on to write 204 speeches <ref>[http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/y/yusril-ihza-mahendra/menkeh.shtml Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Menteri Kehakiman dan HAM | Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> for Suharto.

When Suharto was re-elected to his final term as President in March 1998, Yusril was appointed Aide to the Assistant of the State Secretary. From this position, Yusril was closely involved in the final moments of Suharto's Presidency. When Suharto finally decided to resign, Yusril was involved in the drafting of the resignation speech, giving input so that the speech was legally accurate <ref>[http://www.soehartocenter.com/biografi/biografi/e-ti/index.shtml Biografi HM Soeharto, Dikhianati Pembantu Dekatnya | Soeharto Media Center - Soeharto Review<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. During the crucial moments, Yusril managed to have a disagreement with Suharto over the speech. Suharto wanted to declare that the cabinet was now disbanded while Yusril argued that the Cabinet would not be disbanded because it will continue under the leadership of the next President <ref>[http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/y/yusril-ihza-mahendra/index.shtml Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Terus Perjuangkan Piagam Jakarta | Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Suharto then personally made the necessary edits. When all was set, Yusril went to see [[Amien Rais]] to inform him that Suharto was resigning <ref>http://www.seasite.niu.edu/indonesian/Reformasi/Chronicle/Kompas/May27/ceri01.htm</ref>. The next morning on 21st May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation.

==Reformasi==
With Suharto's fall from power, opportunity opened up for Yusril to get himself into politics and air his views. As a politician, Yusril was very much influenced by Natsir and called for the [[Jakarta Charter]] to be included in the Constitution. In the 1945 Constitution, Article 29 Section 1 originally read "The State is based on the belief in God with the obligation to obey Sharia law for its adherers" <ref>[http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/y/yusril-ihza-mahendra/index.shtml Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Terus Perjuangkan Piagam Jakarta | Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. However, the Section was edited to "The State is based on the belief in God" <ref>[http://indonesia.ahrchk.net/news/mainfile.php/Constitution/22 UNDANG - UNDANG DASAR REPUBLIK INDONESIA 1945<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> to make it sound more secular.

To achieve his political goal, Yusril formed PBB on 17th July 1998 and was elected as its first Chairman. In June 1999, PBB participated in the 1999 Legislative Elections and came 6th with 2.84% of the votes <ref>http://www.cetro.or.id/pemilu2004/suaradprri2004.pdf</ref>.

In the lead up to the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR) General Session, PBB joined forces with the other Muslim Parties to form the Central Axis. As the MPR assembled in 1999, the Central Axis had their support behind [[National Awakening Party]]'s [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] with their opponents being [[Golkar]]'s President Habibie and the [[Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle]]'s (PDI-P) [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]]. When Habibie's accountability speech was not accepted, he refused to run and the Presidential race came down to Wahid and Megawati. Yusril, perhaps worried that Wahid might also drop out of the race had himself nominated as a Presidential Candidate <ref>http://www.nbr.org/publications/briefing/pdf/brief9.pdf</ref>. However, Yusril would drop out of the race with little time to spare before the election process and Wahid would emerge as the President.

==Wahid and Megawati Presidencies==
When Wahid named his [[National Unity]] Cabinet, Yusril was appointed to the position of Minister of Laws and Legislations. During the Wahid Presidency, Yusril had a major policy difference when Wahid threw up the idea of lifting the ban on [[Marxism-Leninism]]. Yusril responded by threatening to resign from his position.<ref>http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0004/27/UTAMA/yusr01.htm</ref> A threat that was widely supported by PBB. Nevertheless, Wahid's idea never materialized and despite his differences, Yusril was retained as Minister. When political pressure began to put Wahid on the defensive in early 2001, Yusril suggested during a Cabinet Meeting that Wahid resign.<ref>[http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/y/yusril-ihza-mahendra/index.shtml Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Terus Perjuangkan Piagam Jakarta | Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Wahid's response was to remove Yusril from the Cabinet.

Now out of the Cabinet, Yusril and PBB threw their weight behind all the other political parties planning to impeach Wahid through a MPR Special Session. This was achieved in July 2001 when the MPR unanimously impeached Wahid and elected Megawati to the Presidency. In Megawati's Cabinet, Yusril was appointed to the position of Minister of Justice and Human Rights. As Minister of Justice and Human Rights, Yusril worked on the Anti-Terrorism Bill (Which would become the Anti-Terrorism Act) after the [[2002 Bali bombings]].<ref>[http://www.polarhome.com/pipermail/nusantara/2002-October/000522.html [Nusantara&#93; Pemerintah Akan Terbitkan Perpu Antiterorisme<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Yusril also sought to improve the quality of Judges in Indonesia.<ref>[http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/y/yusril-ihza-mahendra/wawancara.shtml Yusril Izha Mahendra Tak Ada Ambisi Jadi Presiden | Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==2004 Elections and the [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono|Yudhoyono]] Presidency==
As 2004 approached, Yusril's name began to emerge as a Presidential Candidate. Yusril said that he was ready to run, provided that PBB finished in the Top 3 in the Legislative Elections <ref>[http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/y/yusril-ihza-mahendra/index.shtml Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Terus Perjuangkan Piagam Jakarta | Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. PBB failed to do this, gaining only 2% of the votes in the Legislative Elections <ref>http://www.cetro.or.id/pemilu2004/suaradprri2004.pdf</ref>. Yusril finally decided to support Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and [[Jusuf Kalla]] in their bid for the Presidency and the Vice Presidency. For his support, Yusril was rewarded with the position of State Secretary.

In 2005, Yusril was replaced as PBB Chairman by [[MS Kaban]] but became the Chairman of PBB's Advisory Council.

On 7th May 2007, Yusril was replaced as State Secretary by [[Hatta Rajasa]].

==Personal life==
Yusril was married to Kessy Sukaesih, with whom he had four children. He divorced Sukaesih in November 2005.

Yusril is currently married to Rika Tolentino Kato, who he married in September 2006 <ref>[http://www.freelists.org/archives/ppi/09-2006/msg00254.html FreeLists / ppi / [ppi&#93; [ppiindia&#93; Yusril Nikahi Gadis Belia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.
