'''Alkerton''' is a  village about {{convert|5|mi|km}} west of [[Banbury]] in [[Oxfordshire]], on the county boundary with [[Warwickshire]].

==History==
The [[Domesday Book]] records that in 1086 Alkerton had two main [[Manorialism|manors]]. [[Miles Crispin]] held the larger manor as part of the [[Honour (land)|Honour]] of [[Wallingford]]. Bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], [[William I of England|William the Conqueror's]] half-brother, held the smaller manor.<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53">Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53</ref>

The oldest parts of the [[Church of England parish church]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael]] are the lower stages of the central [[bell tower]], which date from the 12th century<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/> in the Transitional style between the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] and [[English_Gothic_architecture#Early_English_period.2C_also_known_as_Lancet_Gothic|Early English]] styles.<ref name="Sherwood, 1974, p. 420">Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, p. 420</ref> Towards the end of the 12th century the south [[Aisle#Architecture|aisle]] was added,<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/> linked with the [[nave]] by an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] of two [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] in the [[English_Gothic_architecture#Early_English_period.2C_also_known_as_Lancet_Gothic|Early English style]].<ref name="Sherwood, 1974, p. 420"/> Early in the 13th century the east and west arches of the central tower were replaced with Early English style ones.<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/> A stone effigy of a knight in an early 13th century style<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/> was presumably added about the same time. Early in the 14th century the upper stages of the bell tower were built and the nave was rebuilt.<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/> Late in the 14th century a [[clerestorey]] was added to the nave.<ref name="Sherwood, 1974, p. 420"/> The exterior of the clerestorey is elaborately decorated with figures of men and animals carved from [[Hornton]] stone.<ref name="Sherwood, 1974, p. 420"/> The style of carving belongs to a school of 14th century north Oxfordshire masons<ref name="Sherwood, 1974, p. 420"/> whose work survives also at [[Adderbury]], [[Bloxham]] and [[Hanwell, Oxfordshire|Hanwell]].<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/> Early in the 17th century the [[rector]], the mathematician [[Thomas Lydiat]], had the chancel rebuilt in the [[English_Gothic_architecture#Perpendicular_Gothic|Perpendicular style]].<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/> In 1889 the architect [[Jethro Cossins|J.A. Cossins]] restored the church building and added an organ chamber south of the tower and east of the south aisle.<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/> The tower has a [[Change ringing|peal]] of four bells but they are not currently ringable. The oldest bell was cast in about 1400 and another was cast in 1618.<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/>

Thomas Lydiat was descended from Christopher Lydiat of London, who bought Alkerton manor house in 1567.<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/> Thomas Lydiat became rector of Alkerton in 1612<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/> and had the [[rectory]] built in 1625.<ref>Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, p. 421</ref>

By 1624 Alkerton had a [[watermill]],<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/> presumably on Sor Brook. It was absent from village records by 1778.<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/>

Alkerton's villagers farmed under the [[open field system]] until 1777, when an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] was passed for their lands to be [[Enclosure|enclosed]].<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/>

The main road between Banbury and [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] passes through the northeast part of the former parish of Alkerton. It was made into a [[Toll road|turnpike]] in 1743-44.<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/> Since the 1920's it has been classified as part of the [[A422 road]].

In 1782 Alkerton had a [[public house]], the White Lion.<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/>

An elementary school was established in Alkerton as a [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]], but it failed to attract as many children as it was intended to serve.<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/> In 1905 it was closed and its children were transferred to the larger National School in neighbouring [[Shenington]].<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/>

By 1959 the [[Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway|Oxfordshire Ironstone Company]] was a major owner of land around Alkerton.<ref name="Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pp. 44-53"/>

==Amenities==
Alkerton has a public house, the New Inn, on Stratford Road about {{convert|0.6|mi|km}} northeast of the village.
