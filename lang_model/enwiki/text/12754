== Crooked Tree:  New York Times Bestseller & Movie ==

'''''Crooked Tree''''' by [[Robert C. Wilson]] is a ''New York Times'' bestseller published in 1980. Based on a Native American legend set in Northern Michigan, it was compared with Jaws and the Exorcist for its gripping suspense and terrific horror scenes.  Wilson just finished law school at the University of Michigan and was preparing for his bar exam when he wrote it.

Crooked Tree received rave reviews from major media, including;

"It makes your hair stand on end. A cross between Jaws and The Exorcist."
--Liz Smith, ''New York Newsday''

"An intense, meticulously researched thriller that handles Native American beliefs with both suspense and dignity."
--''New York Times''

"An intelligent horror story with skin-crawling entertainment. Crooked Tree is one of the rare books that uses Indian lore with intelligence and respect. The result is an unusual thriller whose supernatural roots are native witchcraft and the werewolf-like concept of 'the Grizzly Woman'."
--''Denver Post''

"Crooked Tree is a story of considerable suspense and plentiful action."
--''Boston Globe''

"Crooked Tree is flat-out terrific. Well-crafted with lush descriptions of Michigan's north country, this book will send chills down your spine as it builds suspense upon suspense." 
--''Detroit Free Press''

Crooked Tree movie rights have been optioned repeatedly by major studios, including Paramount and Warner Brothers; they were also optioned by William Friedkin of Exorcist fame.  Recently Johnny Depp's name has been linked to the movie by Eonline.

The book was released in the Jaw's era, and the technological challenges that plagued Jaws, got in the way of the movie going into production.

The book was re-released in 2005 by the University of Michigan Press and has initiated talks of a movie again.  Michigan's generous laws that give significant tax advantages for film-makers  who make movies in Michigan (Gran Torino, etc.) has also helped generate interest as the story is set in scenic northern Michigan<U+2014>where the Native American legend came from and is what inspired the book.
