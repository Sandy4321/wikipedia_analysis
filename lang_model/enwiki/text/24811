'''Marcus Aurelius Cleander''', commonly known as '''Cleander''' (?&ndash;190), was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[freedman]] who gained extraordinary power as [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] and [[favourite]] of the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Commodus]], rising to command the [[Praetorian Guard]] and bringing the principal offices of the Roman state into disrepute by selling them to the highest bidder. His career is narrated by [[Dio Cassius]], [[Herodian]] and the ''[[Historia Augusta]]''.

==Career==

Cleander's date of birth is unknown but according to [[Dio Cassius]] he was born in [[Phrygia]] and was sold in Rome as one of a consignment of slaves to be a pack-carrier.<ref name="dio-history-73-12">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.html#72-12 LXXIII.12]</ref> By 182 however he had risen high enough to be an official of the Imperial household, and had married the Emperor's mistress Damostratia.<ref name="dio-history-73-12"/> Cleander was instrumental in the death of Commodus's favourite, the chamberlain [[Saoterus]], attaining his position and soon enjoying the emperor's full confidence.<ref name="dio-history-73-12"/> He began to plot against the [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Tigidius Perennis]], who exercised the chief responsibilities of government since the indolent Commodus preferred not to concern himself with administration.<ref name="dio-history-73-9">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.html#72-9 LXXIII.9]</ref>

In 184 he enabled a detachment of soldiers from [[Great Britain|Britain]] to denounce Perennis to the Emperor and Commodus gave them permission to execute the Prefect.<ref name="dio-history-73-9"/> Cleander proceeded to concentrate power in his own hands and to enrich himself by becoming responsible for all public offices: he sold and bestowed entry to the [[Roman Senate]], army commands, governorships and, increasingly, even the [[suffect consul]]ships.<ref name="dio-history-73-12"/> Early in 188 Cleander disposed of the current praetorian prefect, [[Publius Atilius Aebutianus|Atilius Aebutianus]], and himself took over supreme command of the Praetorians with the rank of ''a pugione'' (dagger-bearer) with two praetorian prefects subordinate to him.<ref>''Historia Augusta'', Life of Commodus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Commodus*.html#6.12 6.12]</ref> Now at the zenith of his power, he continued to sell public offices to the highest bidder as his private business. The climax came in the year 190 which had 25 suffect consuls&mdash;a record in the 1,000-year history of the Roman consulship&mdash;all appointed by Cleander (they included the future Emperor [[Septimius Severus]]).<ref name="dio-history-73-12"/> Cleander shared the proceeds with the Emperor, but also used some of it for buildings and other public works.<ref name="dio-history-73-12"/>

In June 190 Rome was afflicted by a food shortage, which the [[Praefectus annonae|praefectus annonae]] [[Papirius Dionysius]], in charge of the grain supply, contrived to make worse than it actually was and laid the blame on Cleander.<ref name="dio-history-73-13">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.html#72-13 LXXIII.13]</ref> As the contemporary senator and historian [[Cassius Dio]] narrates, at the end of June a mob demonstrated against Cleander during a horse-race in the [[Circus Maximus]].<ref name="dio-history-73-13"/> In response, he sent the praetorian guard to put down the disturbances but [[Pertinax]], the [[Praefectus urbi]] (city prefect of Rome), despatched the [[vigiles|Vigiles Urbani]] to oppose them. Cleander fled to Commodus for protection, but the mob followed him calling for his head. At the urging of his mistress [[Marcia (mistress of Commodus)|Marcia]], Commodus had Cleander beheaded and his son killed.<ref name="dio-history-73-13"/>

==Cleander in popular culture==
Cleander figures as a character in the 1964 film epic ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', where he is played by [[Mel Ferrer]]. He is depicted as a sinister blind man who poisons Commodus's father, the Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]. He thereafter remains a background presence throughout the film and is shown in one scene at the occasion of Commodus's death, by which time the historical Cleander had been dead for two years.
