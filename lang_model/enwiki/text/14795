Or are you going to smile, shut up about your pains, be warmly interested in other people, and forget yourself by helping others?"

Harrison recalled his part in the push to the Rhine: "Our artillery scouts made their own reconnaissance and went into position as an isolated unit; reached the Rhine on March 5, 1945; crossed the Rhine on March 27, 1945."{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=306}} He was then part of the drive to the Elbe and reached [[Hanover, Germany|Hanover]] by April 2, 1945.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=306}}

In Hanover and just three weeks before the war ended,<ref name=Audrey /> Harrison and other American combatants of the No. 1 gun of the 280th Field Artillery were hit by a German gun directed from an observation tower mounted on a steeple of a church.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=306}} The German gun, which had a direct hit on their gunning position, caused three deaths, wounded five and stunned twenty-five American combatants.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=306}} Of the living wounded, Harrison was nearest to death; his left arm was torn off near the shoulder, lost three fingers on his right hand, his right knee had been crushed and his pelvic bones were shattered.{{sfn|Tashjian|1952|p=169}}<ref name=congress>{{cite book|title=Congressional Serial Set 11598|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HWwuAAAAIAAJ&q|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|accessdate=18 June 2013|page=168|year=1951}}</ref> When Harrison demanded a [[tourniquet]], one of the combatants ripped off his web belt and tied it around the leg.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=307}} A moment later a medic applied a real tourniquet.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=307}} Then Harrison was transported to a field hospital where he underwent emergency surgeries. According the Harrison, the doctors stated that "we'd better list him as killed in action" and another said "He'll die on the operating table."{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=307}}

Having survived the surgeries, Sam K. Harrison was then transferred to a hospital in Paris and was not expected to live.{{sfn|Tashjian|1952|p=170}} Even though Harrison showed signs of recovery, his recovery slowed down considerably when news of both his parents death reached him.{{sfn|Tashjian|1952|p=170}}

Once Harrison reached stable condition, he was sent back to the United States and transferred to the Bushnell Hospital in [[Brigham City]], [[Utah]] for more operations.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=308}} Harrison was then transferred to the [[Letterman Army Hospital]] in San Francisco where he was given a wheelchair and intensive rehabilitation. After surgeons had grafted bones into his crushed knee, Harrison began to walk again with the help of a cane and [[leg brace]].{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=308}}
