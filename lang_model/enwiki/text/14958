'''''France''''' was the last ship of the {{sclass|Courbet|battleship}}s, the first [[dreadnoughts]] built for the [[French Navy]]. She was completed just before [[World War I]] as part of the 1911 naval building programme. She spent the war in the Mediterranean, covering the [[Otranto Barrage]] in the [[Adriatic]]. ''France'', accompanied by her [[sister ship]] {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart||2}}, was sent to the [[Black Sea]] in 1919 to oppose the [[Bolsheviks]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Her crew briefly mutinied in April 1919 from a combination of war-weariness, Communist sympathizers in the crew and difficult conditions. The mutiny and general lack of morale among her crew caused her to return to France later that month.<ref name=m6>Masson, pp. 106<U+2013>22</ref> Striking an uncharted rock off the French coast in 1922, she foundered four hours later.

==Description==
[[File:Courbet class diagrams Brasseys 1912.jpg|left|thumb|200px|<center>Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1912</center>]]
''France'' was {{convert|166|m|ftin}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|27|m|ftin}} and at full load a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|9.04|m|ftin}} at the bow. She displaced {{convert|23475|t|LT}} at standard load and {{convert|25579|t|LT}} at full load.<ref name=d3>Dumas, p. 223</ref> She proved to be rather wet in service as she was bow-heavy because of the [[superfire|superimposed]] turrets forward.<ref name=c7>Gardiner & Gray, p. 197</ref>

''France'' had four [[propeller]]s powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] direct-drive [[steam turbine]]s which were rated at {{convert|28000|shp|lk=in|0}}. Twenty-four Belleville [[water-tube boiler]]s provided steam for her turbines. These boilers were coal-burning with auxiliary oil sprayers.<ref name=w6>Whitley, p. 36</ref> She had a designed speed of {{convert|21|knots|lk=in}}.<ref name=d3/> She carried up to {{convert|2700|LT|t}} of coal and {{convert|906|LT|t}} of oil and could steam for {{convert|4200|nmi|km}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn|mph km/h}}.<ref name=c7/>

''France''{{'}}s main armament consisted of twelve [[305mm/45 Mod<U+00E8>le 1906 gun|{{convert|305|mm|adj=on|0}} Mle 1910]] 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] guns were mounted in six twin [[gun turret]]s, with two turrets superimposed fore and aft, and one on each flank of the ship. For anti-[[torpedo boat]] defence she carried 22 [[Canon de 138 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1910 Naval gun|{{convert|138|mm|adj=on}} Mle 1910]] guns, which were mounted in [[casemate]]s. Four {{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on}} Mod<U+00E8>le 1902 [[Hotchkiss gun]]s were fitted, two on each beam. She was also armed with four {{convert|450|mm|in|adj=on|0}} submerged Mod<U+00E8>le 1909 [[torpedo tube]]s with twelve torpedoes.<ref name=w6/>

''France''{{'}}s waterline [[armored belt|armoured belt]] extended well below the waterline as the French were concerned about protection from underwater hits. Her main armour was also thinner than that of her British or German counterparts, but covered more area. It was {{convert|270|mm|in|1}} thick between the fore and aft turrets and tapered to {{convert|180|mm|in|abbr=on}} towards the bow and stern. It extended {{convert|2.4|m|ftin}} below the normal waterline. Above the main belt was another belt, 180&nbsp;mm thick, that covered the sides, and the secondary armament, up to the forecastle deck, {{convert|4.5|m|ftin}} deep, between the fore and aft turrets. The conning tower had armour {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} thick. The main gun turrets had {{convert|290|mm|in|1}} of armour on their faces, {{convert|250|mm|in|1}} on their sides and roofs {{convert|100|mm|in}} thick. Their barbettes had {{convert|280|mm|in|1}} of armour. There was no anti-[[torpedo bulkhead]] although there was a longitudinal bulkhead abreast the machinery spaces that was used either as a coal bunker or left as a void.<ref>Whitley, p. 35</ref>

==Career==
''France'', together with her [[sister ship]] {{ship|French battleship|Paris||2}}, was ordered on 1 August 1911 as part of the 1911 Naval Programme. She was built by the [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]] in [[Saint-Nazaire]]. Her keel was laid down on 30 November 1911 and she was launched on 7 November 1912.<ref>Dumas, p. 162</ref> She was commissioned as part of the [[Bastille Day]] celebrations in 1914. Almost immediately after being commissioned, she, escorted by ''Jean Bart'', carried the President of the French Republic, [[Raymond Poincar<U+00E9>]], on a state visit to [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] in July 1914. They were returning from Russia when World War I began, but made it to France without encountering German ships.<ref>Scheer, Chapter 1</ref>

===World War I===
''France'', upon her return, was ordered, along with her three sister ships, to serve in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] against the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman]] Navies. They spent most of 1914 providing gunfire support for the [[Montenegrin Army]] until the submarine {{SMU|U-12|Austria-Hungary|2}} torpedoed ''Jean Bart'' on 21 December off [[Sazan Island]].<ref name=c7/> This forced the battleships to fall back to either [[Malta]] or [[Bizerte]]. After the French occupied the neutral Greek island of [[Corfu]] in 1916 they moved forward to [[Corfu]] and [[Argostoli]], but their activities were very limited as many of their crews were used to man anti-submarine ships.<ref name=w8>Whitley, p. 38</ref>

After the war, ''France'' and ''Paris'' supported Allied forces in the Black Sea in 1919 during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]].<ref name=c7/> Mutinies briefly broke out on both ships in April 1919, but collapsed when [[Vice-Admiral]] [[Jean-Fran<U+00E7>oise-Charles Amet]] agreed to meet their main demand to take the ships home. 26 crewmen were sentenced to prison terms upon her return, although they were commuted in 1922 as part of a bargain between [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Raymond Poincar<U+00E9>]] and the parties of the Left.<ref name=m6>Masson, pp. 106<U+2013>22</ref> On 26 August 1922, she struck an uncharted rock in [[Quiberon Bay]] and foundered four hours later. Of her crew of 900, only three were lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06E5D61039E133A25754C2A96E9C946395D6CF|title=French Battleship wrecked, 3 men lost|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|date = Sunday 27 August 1922|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref> She was not modernized before her loss.<ref name=d5>Dumas, p. 225</ref>
