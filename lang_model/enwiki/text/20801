'''H<U+00E5>kons Hall''', sometimes [[anglicized]] as '''H<U+00E5>kon Hall''' and '''Haakons Hall''', is an [[arena]] located at [[Stampesletta]] in [[Lillehammer]], [[Norway]]. With a spectator capacity of 11,500 people, it is the largest [[team handball|handball]] and [[ice hockey]] venue in the country. H<U+00E5>kons Hall is regularly used for handball and ice hockey tournaments, concerts, exhibitions, conferences and banquets. The venue is owned by [[Lillehammer Municipality]] via the subsidiary [[Lillehammer Olympiapark]], which owns all the Olympic venues in Lillehammer. The [[Norwegian Olympic Museum]] is located in the arena, which is located next to the smaller [[Kristins Hall]].

The hall opened on 1 February 1993 having cost 238 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK). It was built to host the [[ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|ice hockey tournament]] at the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], and has since hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[1994 Winter Paralympics]], the [[1999 IIHF World Championship]] in ice hockey, the [[World Women's Handball Championship]] in [[1993 World Women's Handball Championship|1993]] and [[1999 World Women's Handball Championship|1999]], the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2004]], the [[2008 European Men's Handball Championship]] and the [[2010 European Women's Handball Championship]]. [[Lillehammer IK]] has occasionally played ice hockey matches at the arena.

Lillehammer received its first indoor ice rink in 1988, with the opening of Kristins Hall. That same year, the town was awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics, which required the construction of a larger venue for the Olympic ice hockey matches. The naming of the arena was decided by the Lillehammer Municipal Council in October 1988, as part of a broader branding policy, based on the history of the [[Birkebeiner]]. H<U+00E5>kons Hall is named for [[Haakon Haakonarson]], a medieval king of Norway who as a child was transported across by mountains by skiers. [[Kristin and H<U+00E5>kon]] became the mascots for the Olympics, and the twin arenas at Stampesletta were named accordingly. Protests were made in Bergen, as local patriots felt it was not suitable that a sports venue had such a similar name to [[H<U+00E5>konshallen]], a medieval hall in Bergen.<ref>{{cite news |title=H<U+00E5>kons hall valgt blant mange forslag |date=7 January 1992 |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |page=43 |last=Svegaarden |first=Knut Espen |last2=Olsen |first2=Geir |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

In June 1989, the municipal council voted to locate most of the Lillehammer venues in the Stampesletta area, and to place H<U+00E5>kons Hall adjacent to Kristins Hall. This was controversial and many councilors voted for the original decentralized plan, with the venues spread out through the municipality.<ref>{{cite news |title=LOOC st<U+00F8>tter r<U+00E5>dmann-instilling, OL-anleggene samles rund Stampesletta? |date=19 June 1989 |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The application for the Olympics called for building up to five ice venues in Lillehammer. For post-Olympic use, Kristins Hall was designated as the main ice rink for Lillehammer, while it was planned that H<U+00E5>kons Hall would be used for larger events.<ref>{{cite news |title=Er OL verd pengene? |date=2 May 1989 |work=[[Aftenposten]] |page=16 |last=Kirkeb<U+00F8>en |first=Stein Erik |language=Norwegian}}</ref> On 8 December 1989, the [[International Olympic Committee]] rejected two demands from the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) for the ability to host a minimum of 12,000 spectators in the larger ice hockey venue and for a women's ice hockey tournament.<ref>{{cite news |title=Svart OL-dag for ishockeysjefen |date=8 December 1989 |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The decision about the location of the ice hockey venues was made on 10 October 1990. H<U+00E5>kons Hall would be the main venue, supplemented by [[Gj<U+00F8>vik Olympic Cavern Hall]] in [[Gj<U+00F8>vik]]. The proposal to have [[figure skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics|figure skating]] at H<U+00E5>kons Hall was rejected, and instead it was to be held at [[Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre]] in [[Hamar]].<ref>{{cite news |title=OL-ishockey p<U+00E5> Lillehammer og GJ<U+00F8>vik |date=10 October 1990 |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 1990, the [[Norwegian Cycling Federation]] recommended H<U+00E5>kons Hall as one of several possible places to build a [[velodrome]] for the [[International Cycling Union]]'s  [[1993 UCI Track Cycling World Championships]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sykkelforbundet m<U+00E5> ha Oslo-garanti for VM-arrangement innen m<U+00E5>nedskiftet |date=25 July 1990 |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The same year, H<U+00E5>kons Hall was proposed to supplement [[Oslo Spektrum]] as a venue for a proposed pan-European professional ice hockey league.<ref>{{cite news |title=Europeisk superliga i ishockey neste sesong? |date=6 September 1990 |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Construction was approved by the [[Parliament of Norway]] in April 1990, including funding.<ref name=looc>{{cite web |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1994/E_BOOK3.PDF |title=1994 Winter Olympics Report, volume III |author=Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee |accessdate=10 December 2010 |pages=27<U+2013>29}}</ref> Original design plans called for a simple hangar-like design, and original cost estimates were for NOK&nbsp;191 million. However, in March 1991, the municipal council decided to increase spending on the venue to make it more aesthetic. The re-design also included telescopic stands and better [[acoustics]], to allow for more flexible use after the Olympics.<ref>{{cite news |title=H<U+00E5>kons hall blir lillehammers "juvel" |date=21 March 1991 |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The main contractor was [[Veidekke]] and construction cost NOK&nbsp;238 million. Grants were given from the [[Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate]] and [[SINTEF]] for energy economization. The work on the hall was concluded on 1 February 1993.<ref name=looc /> It was the 27th [[list of indoor ice rinks in Norway|indoor ice hockey rink in Norway]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockey.no/t2.asp?p=61305 |title=Ishaller |author=[[Norwegian Ice Hockey Association]] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wJrHSWBi |archivedate=7 February 2011 |accessdate=7 February 2011 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=no}}</ref>
