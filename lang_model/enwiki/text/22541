'''Lazarus Whitehead Powell''' (October 6, 1812 - July 3, 1867) was the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|19th]] [[Governor of Kentucky]], serving from 1851 to 1855. He was later elected to represent Kentucky in the [[United States Senator|U.S. Senate]] from 1859 to 1865.

The reforms enacted during Powell's term as governor gave Kentucky one of the top educational systems in the antebellum South. He also improved Kentucky's transportation system and vetoed legislation that he felt would have created an overabundance of banks in the [[Commonwealth (United States)|Commonwealth]]. Powell's election as governor marked the end of [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] dominance in Kentucky. Powell's predecessor, [[John J. Crittenden]], was the last governor elected from the party of the Commonwealth's [[favorite son]], [[Henry Clay]].

Following his term as governor, Powell was elected to the U.S. Senate. Before he could assume office, [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Buchanan]] dispatched Powell and [[Major]] [[Benjamin McCulloch]] to [[Utah]] to ease tensions with [[Brigham Young]] and the [[Mormonism|Mormons]]. Powell assumed his Senate seat on his return from Utah, just prior to the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as president. Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, so much so that the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] asked for his resignation and some of his fellow senators tried to have him expelled from the body. Both groups later renounced their actions.

Powell died at his home near [[Henderson, Kentucky]] shortly following a failed bid to return to the Senate in 1867.

==Early life==
Powell was born on October 6, 1812 near [[Henderson, Kentucky]], the third son of Lazarus and Ann McMahon{{ref|mom|[a]}} Powell.<ref name=biosketch11>''Biographical Sketch'', p. 11</ref> He attended the common schools of Henderson, and was tutored by [[George Gayle]].<ref name=powell>Powell, p. 46</ref> He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from Saint Joseph College in [[Bardstown, Kentucky]] in 1833,<ref name=biosketch18>''Biographical Sketch'', p. 18</ref> and began studying law under [[John Rowan (politician)|John Rowan]].<ref name=kye731>Harrison, p. 731</ref> He then enrolled in the [[Transylvania University]] School of Law, studying under Justice [[George Robertson (Kentucky)|George Robertson]] and Judge [[Daniel Mayes]].<ref name=powell /> He was admitted to the [[bar association|bar]] in 1835, and partnered with [[Archibald Dixon]] to start a law practice in Henderson.<ref name=powell /> The two remained partners until 1839.<ref name=biosketch25>''Biographical Sketch'', p. 25</ref>

On November 8, 1837, Powell married Harriet Ann Jennings.<ref name=biosketch26>''Biographical Sketch'', p. 26</ref> The couple had three sons{{ref|kids|[b]}} before Jennings died on July 30, 1846.<ref name=powell />

==Political career==
A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] district, Powell's political career began with an 1836 bid for a seat in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].<ref name=nga>NGA Bio</ref> He campaigned vigorously while his opponent, John G. Holloway, relied largely on his party affiliation to carry the election.<ref name=starling>Starling in ''Kentucky: History of Henderson County''</ref> This proved a critical misstep for Holloway, as Powell secured the surprise victory. Holloway apparently learned from his mistake. Upon the completion of Powell's term in 1838, Holloway challenged Powell again, and defeated him by a considerable majority.<ref name=starling /> Six year later, Powell was chosen as a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket, supporting [[James K. Polk]].<ref name=mrwk>''Memorial Record of Western Kentucky'', pp. 625&ndash;630</ref>

===Governor of Kentucky===
In 1848, Kentucky Democrats nominated [[Linn Boyd]] for governor, but Boyd declined the nomination. Powell was chosen to replace Boyd on the ticket, largely due to the influence of [[James Guthrie (American politician)|James Guthrie]].<ref name=biosketch40>''Biographical Sketch'', p. 40</ref> The Whig party nominated Senator [[John J. Crittenden]], and the race was complicated by former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Mentor Johnson]]'s announcement that he would run as an independent Democratic candidate.<ref name=starling /> Knowing the Democrats' chances were dimmed by having two candidates in the race, Powell arranged a meeting with Johnson, following which the latter withdrew his candidacy and pledged his support to Powell.<ref name=starling /> Nevertheless, Crittenden won the election.

In the gubernatorial election of 1851, Powell was once again the Democratic Party nominee. The Whigs nominated Powell's friend and law partner, Archibald Dixon. Powell and Dixon traveled the state together, eating at the same taverns, speaking from the same platforms, and generally showing cordiality and friendliness that was rare in Kentucky politics in those days.<ref name=mrwk /> Powell's margin of victory in the general election was a thin 850 votes, while Whig candidate John P. Thompson defeated the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, [[Robert Wickliffe]], by several thousand votes.<ref name=ramage72>Ramage, p. 72</ref><ref name=mrwk /> A third candidate for governor, [[abolitionist]] [[Cassius Clay (1810<U+2013>1903)|Cassius M. Clay]], received 3,621 votes.<ref name=kye731 /> Powell was the first Democrat elected to the office in almost twenty years.<ref name=eok>''Encyclopedia of Kentucky''</ref> ([[John L. Helm]] had ascended to the governorship on Crittenden's resignation.)<ref name=powell />

The Whigs also maintained control of the General Assembly, and although Governor Powell was largely able to cooperate with his political opponents, some clashes did occur. As a result of the [[United States Census, 1850|1850 census]], the General Assembly re-apportioned the state into ten congressional districts. Powell vetoed the redistricting, noting that the districts had been [[Gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] to give the fading Whig party control over the state delegation. The legislature overrode the veto. The governor was successful, however, in vetoing legislation that he felt would have created an overabundance of banks in the [[Commonwealth (United States)|Commonwealth]].<ref name=kye732>Harrison, p. 732</ref>

Powell implemented the use of the state's [[sinking fund]] to pay interest on school bonds, a measure which had passed over Governor Helm's veto, but Helm refused to carry out. In 1855, Kentucky's voters passed by landslide a measure to raise the school tax from two cents per hundred dollars of taxable property to five cents per hundred dollars. The measure enjoyed the support of both Governor Powell and superintendent of public schools [[Robert Jefferson Breckinridge]]. Under the leadership of Powell and Breckinridge, Kentucky's school system became among the strongest in the antebellum South.<ref name=ramage73>Ramage, p. 73</ref>

Among Powell's other successes as governor was his successful lobbying of the legislature to conduct a geological survey in 1854. He also encouraged private investment in transportation in the state. During his term, the state went from having {{convert|78|mi|km}} of railroad track in operation to having {{convert|242|mi|km}} in operation.<ref name=ramage72 />

===United States Senator===
In January 1858, Powell was elected to the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=powell /> In April of that year, [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Buchanan]] appointed Powell and [[Major]] [[Benjamin McCulloch]] commissioners to negotiate settlements with the [[Mormonism|Mormons]] in [[Utah]].<ref name=powell /> On arriving in Utah, Powell and McCulloch issued a proclamation by President Buchanan offering [[clemency]] to Mormons who agreed to submit to Federal authority.<ref name=biosketch52>''Biographical Sketch'', p. 52</ref> The offer was accepted, and violence was averted.<ref name=biosketch52 />

Senator Powell favored Kentucky's neutrality policy during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]],<ref name=kye732 /> but nationally, the conflict put him in a tenuous political situation. On one hand, he was a favored a strong national government and a strict interpretation of the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]]. On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause that legislators from more northern states.<ref name=mrwk /> During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states that refused to abide by the [[Fugitive Slave Act]].<ref name=eok />

In 1861, Senator Powell vigorously condemned President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s decision to suspend the writ of [[habeas corpus]].<ref name=mrwk /> In 1862, he denounced the arrest of some citizens of [[Delaware]]&mdash;officially, the arrests were called "resolutions of inquiry"&mdash;as a violation of constitutional rights.<ref name=mrwk /> These stances led to calls for his resignation by the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] in 1861, and some of his colleagues, led by Kentucky's other senator, [[Garrett Davis]], unsuccessfully attempted to have him expelled from the Senate.<ref name=ramage73 /> Before the end of the war, both the General Assembly and Davis admitted being wrong in their attempts to remove him.<ref name=powell />

Following his successful defense against calls for his removal, Powell continued speaking against what he saw as violations of constitutional rights. In 1864, he condemned [[General Order <U+2116> 11 (1862)|General Order <U+2116> 11]], an edict of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] that barred [[Jew]]s from the Department of Tennessee, which included regions of Kentucky.<ref name=nga /> In the same speech, he rebuked federal military interference with the elections in Kentucky.<ref name=mrwk /> In 1864, however, he opposed a constitutional amendment aimed at freeing the slaves.<ref name=mrwk />

==Later life and legacy==
Following his term in the Senate, he returned to Henderson and resumed his law practice.<ref name=kye732 /> He was a delegate to the Union National Convention in 1866.<ref name=powell /> In 1867, he was again nominated to the U.S. Senate, but after several ballots over several months, the General Assembly had not elected him.<ref name=biosketch89>''Biographical Sketch'', p. 89</ref> Powell believed that many of the legislators had been elected as a result of election interference by Northern forces, and that their intent was to prevent Kentucky from electing a senator at all, diminishing her influence nationally.<ref name=biosketch8990>''Biographical Sketch'', pp. 89&ndash;90</ref> In light of this belief, he urged the Democrats to withdraw his name and nominate someone more palatable to Union sympathizers.<ref name=biosketch90>''Biographical Sketch, p. 90</ref> This they did, putting forth the name of Garrett Davis, who was subsequently elected.<ref name=biosketch90 />

Powell died in his home on July 3, 1867.<ref name=kye732 /> The cause of death was [[apoplexy]], apparently the result of the toll years of [[rheumatism]] had exacted on his nervous system.<ref name=biosketch2829>''Biographical Sketch'', pp. 28&ndash;29</ref> He is buried at the Fernwood Cemetery<ref name=nga /> in [[Henderson, Kentucky]].<ref name=kye732 /> The state erected a {{convert|22|ft|m|sing=on}} high [[marble]] monument over his grave in 1870.<ref name=powell /> [[Powell County, Kentucky]], is named in honor of Governor Powell.<ref name=kye732 />
