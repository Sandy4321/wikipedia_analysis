'''[[Ethiopian Airlines]] Flight 961''', a [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-260ER]], was hijacked on {{date|1996-11-23}},<ref>{{cite news|title= 1996 spawns worst-ever accident totals|agency= [[Flight International]]|newspaper= [[Flightglobal.com]]|date={{date|1997-1-15}}|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/1997/01/15/1383/1996-spawns-worst-ever-accident-totals.html|accessdate= {{date|2011-6-5}}|quote= The 23 November 1996, hijack of an Ethiopian Airlines 767 resulted in the death of 128 people when the pilots were forced to ditch the aircraft near the Comoros Islands.}}</ref> en route from [[Addis Ababa]] to [[Nairobi]] on a [[Mumbai|Bombay]]<U+2013>Addis Ababa<U+2013>Nairobi<U+2013>[[Brazzaville]]<U+2013>[[Lagos]]<U+2013>[[Abidjan]] service,<ref>{{cite news|title=PLANE IS HIJACKED; CRASHES IN OCEAN OFF EAST AFRICA|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E7DA123DF937A15752C1A960958260&scp=6&sq=ethiopian%20airlines&st=cse|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 November 1996|accessdate=20 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Terror Aloft, Death at Sea|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/01/weekinreview/terror-aloft-death-at-sea.html?scp=66&sq=ethiopian%20airlines&st=cse|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 December 1996|accessdate=20 February 2011}}</ref> by three [[Ethiopia|Ethiopian]]s seeking [[Right of asylum|political asylum]] in [[Australia]].<ref name="ASN">{{ASN accident|id= 19961123-0|type= Hijacking|title=|accessdate= {{date|2011-5-24}}}}</ref> The plane crash-landed in the [[Indian Ocean]] near [[Comoros]] due to [[fuel starvation]], killing 125 of the 175 passengers and [[Aircrew member|crew]] on board, along with the hijackers.<ref name="ASN"/> 50 survived with injuries.

==Hijack==
When the aircraft, [[Aircraft registration|tail number]] ET-AIZ,<ref name="ASN"/> nicknamed ''Zulu'' by Ethiopian Airlines' pilots,<ref>[[Mayday (TV series)|Mayday]] series, season 3, episode 13, interview with pilot Leul Abate</ref> was still flying over [[Ethiopia]]n airspace,<ref name="AirDisaster">{{Cite web|title=Air Disaster.Com: Special Report: Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961|publisher=[[AirDisaster.com]]|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/special/ethiopian961.shtml|accessdate=20 February 2011}}</ref> three Ethiopian men charged the [[cockpit]] and [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked the aircraft]] after taking an axe and a fire extinguisher from the cockpit. According to a special ''[[Airdisaster.com]]'' report, "One of the men ran down the aisle toward the cockpit shouting statements that could not be understood, and his two accomplices followed soon after." The report described the men as "young (mid-twenties), inexperienced, psychologically fragile, and [[Drunkenness|intoxicated]]."<ref name="AirDisaster"/> Ethiopian state-operated radio later identified the hijackers as two unemployed high-school graduates and a nurse; their names were Alemayehu Bekeli Belayneh, Mathias Solomon Belay, and Sultan Ali Hussein (they did not say who had which description).<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Minnesota Daily]] (World & Nation digest)|title=Government Names Ethiopian Airlines Hijackers

The men threatened to blow the plane out of the sky if the pilot and co-pilot<U+2014>[[Leul Abate]] and [[Yonas Mekuria]]<U+2014>did not obey their demands. They announced over the intercom that they were opponents of the Ethiopian government seeking political asylum, having recently been released from prison. The hijackers said that there were eleven of them when in fact there were only three. Authorities later determined that the bomb was actually a covered bottle of [[Distilled beverage|liquor]].<ref name="AirDisaster"/><ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news|title=Beirut: 90 feared dead as Ethiopian Airlines plane crashes into Mediterranean|author=Adrian Blomfield|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/lebanon/7069269/Beirut-90-feared-dead-as-Ethiopian-Airlines-plane-crashes-into-Mediterranean.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=25 January 2010|accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref><ref name="AfricanHijack">"African Hijack"/"Ocean Landing," ''[[Mayday (TV series)|Mayday]]''</ref>

The hijackers demanded the plane to be flown to [[Australia]];<ref name="ASN"/><ref name="AirDisaster"/> the in-flight magazine stated the 767 could make the trip on a full tank and the plane had been refueled at its last stopover. Leul<!--Ethiopians do not have family names--> tried to explain they had only taken on the fuel needed for the scheduled flight and thus could not even make a quarter of the journey, but the hijackers did not believe him.<ref name="AfricanHijack"/>

Instead of flying towards Australia, the captain followed the African coastline. The hijackers noticed that land was still visible and forced the pilot to steer east. Leul secretly headed for the [[Comoro Islands]], which lie midway between [[Madagascar]] and the [[Africa]]n mainland.<ref name="AfricanHijack"/>

==Crash landing==
[[File:Ditching of Ethiopian Airlines Flt 961.JPG|thumb|Sequence showing the ditching of the aircraft.]]
The plane was nearly out of fuel as it approached the island group, but the hijackers continued to ignore the captain's warnings. Out of options, Leul began to circle the area, hoping to land the plane at the Comoros's main airport. When the plane ran out of fuel, both engines failed. The crew used a [[ram air turbine]] to preserve the aircraft's most essential functions, but in this mode some hydraulic systems <U+2014> such as the flaps <U+2014> were inoperative. This forced Leul to land at more than 175 [[knot (unit)|knots]] (about 320&nbsp;km/h or 200&nbsp;mph).<ref name="AfricanHijack"/>

Leul tried to make an emergency landing at [[Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport]] on [[Grande Comore]], but a fight with the hijackers at the last minute caused him to lose his visual point of reference, leaving him unable to locate the airport. While still fighting with the hijackers, he tried to ditch the aircraft in shallow waters {{convert|500|yd|sigfig=3}} off Le Galawa Beach Hotel, near [[Mitsamiouli]] at the northern end of Grande Comore island. Leul attempted to land parallel with the waves instead of against the waves in an effort to smooth the landing. ET-AIZ's left engine and wingtip struck the water first. The engine acted as a scoop and struck a [[coral reef]], slowing that side of the aircraft quickly, causing the Boeing 767 to violently spin left and break apart. Island residents and tourists, including a group of [[scuba set|scuba]] divers and some French doctors on vacation, came to the aid of crash survivors.<ref name="AfricanHijack"/><ref>Lendon, Brad.

Many passengers died because they inflated their [[life jacket]]s in the cabin,<ref name="AirDisaster"/><ref name="Telegraph"/> causing them to be trapped inside by the rising water. This led to further notices about not inflating the vests before exiting the plane.

A tourist recorded a video of ET-AIZ crashing; she said that she had begun taping because she initially believed that the 767 formed a part of an air show for tourists.<ref name="Honeymooners">"[http://web.archive.org/web/19990117075208/http:/www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/26/comoros.crash/index1.html Honeymooners capture dramatic images of Ethiopian jet crash]," ''[[CNN|CNN (via Archive.Org)]]''</ref>

One hundred twenty-five of the 175 passengers and crew members were killed, as well as all three hijackers. Many of the passengers who died survived the initial crash, but they had disregarded or did not hear Leul's warning not to inflate their [[Personal flotation device|life jackets]] inside the aircraft, causing them to be pushed against the ceiling of the fuselage by the inflated life jackets when water flooded in. Unable to escape, they drowned. An estimated 60 to 80 passengers, strapped to their seats, presumably drowned.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/23/hijack.ethiopia.update/index.html Ethiopian airline crash kills at least 50].

Leul and Yonas<!--Ethiopians do not have family names--> both survived.

===Notable passengers===
Among those killed was [[Mohamed Amin]], a famous wartime photojournalist and publisher of ''Selamta'', Ethiopian Airlines' in-flight magazine.<ref>Episode Seven, ''[[Mo & Me]]''</ref> He was believed to be standing near the entrance to the cockpit arguing and negotiating with the hijacker presumed to be guarding the cockpit during the final moments of the flight.

[[Franklin Huddle]], the U.S. Consul General of Bombay at the time, and his wife Chanya "Pom" Huddle both survived the crash.<ref name="FinishedLife"/> Huddle said that he chose to fly on Ethiopian Airlines while planning a [[safari]] trip to [[Kenya]] because of the airline's reputation. Huddle said in an interview that Ethiopian Airlines was one of two in Africa to have [[Federal Aviation Administration]] certification. Huddle wanted a flight during the day, reasoning that flying during the day was "safer."<ref name="AfricanHijack"/> Huddle credited his and his wife's survival to a last-minute upgrade to business class.<ref name="Brown">"[http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/may/june-2002/no-resting-place.html No Resting Place]," ''[[Brown University]] Alumni Magazine''</ref>

Other passengers on the aircraft included Lt.Gen.(Ret.)

==Aftermath==
The incident has become a well-known hijacking because of the videotape.<ref name="Honeymooners"/> The video later served as an important tool in studies of aviation crashes and procedures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

This was one of very few large airliner [[water landing]]s, the first hijacked water landing. Both the captain and co-pilot of the flight received aviation awards, and both continued to fly for Ethiopian Airlines.<ref name="AfricanHijack"/>

==In the media==
The crash was featured in [[List of Mayday episodes#Season 3|two episodes]] of ''[[Mayday (TV series)|Mayday]]'' (''Air Emergency'', ''Air Crash Investigation''). One appeared in season 1 to explain what might have happened if [[Air Transat Flight 236]] had ditched instead of landing in a nearby airport. It appeared again in season 3, this time directly explaining the events of Flight 961. It was also featured in a 2010 episode of the [[Biography Channel]] series ''[[I Survived...]]'', in which a survivor told his story of what happened on the plane,<ref name="I Survived">[http://www.biography.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=531484&airingid=17186298]</ref> and also appeared in the documentary ''Out of the Wreckage - Plane Crash Survivors'', which features crashes that were caught on camera and with survivors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
