'''State Highway 101''' or '''SH 101''' is a [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]] that runs from [[Bowie, Texas|Bowie]] to [[Bridgeport, Texas|Bridgeport]].  It was designated along its route in 1976, running from Bowie southeast parallel to [[U.S. Highway 81 (Texas)|US 81]]/[[U.S. Route 287 (Texas)|US 287]] along a previous routing of those US Routes, then turning south toward Bridgeport along a previous portion of [[State Highway 114 (Texas)|SH 114]].  

==Route description==
SH 101 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 81 on the far southeast side of [[Bowie, TX|Bowie]], and travels southteast about 7 miles to [[Sunset, TX|Sunset]].  This section was the original routing of US 81 and US 287 before an upgraded routing was built for those routes.  This section of SH 101 also remains within a mile of the upgraded US 81/US 287 along the entire route. In Sunset, the route sutns to the south, departing from it parallel routing with the US Routes, and continues southward tthrough [[Chico, TX|Chico]] to its southern terminus on the north side of [[Bridgeport, TX|Bridgeport]], where it meets U.S. Route 380 and SH 114.  This section from Sunset to Bridgeport was a previous routing of SH 114 before it was redirected westward in 1976.

[[file:Texas Business 101-B.svg|left|60px]]SH 101 has one business route, 101-B, through the city of Chico.  The route was an original section of SH 114 before it was rerouted east of town in 1961.  The old routing was then named State Loop 352.  In 1991, the route was renamed to coincide with its parent, which had already be renumbered as SH 101.

==History==
SH 101 was previously designated by 1933 on a route from [[Snyder, Texas|Snyder]] through [[Colorado City, Texas|Colorado City]] to [[Sterling City, Texas|Sterling City]].  By 1936, the route was complete from Snyder to Colorado City, but was still an earthen road<ref>{{cite map| title=Official Map of the Highway System of Texas| year=1936| publisher=State Highway Commission ([[Texas Department of Transportation]])}}</ref>.  By 1939, it was completed, with a terminus just west of Sterling City. The section north of Colorado City was transferred to [[State Highway 208 (Texas)|SH 208]] in 1956, with the remaining portion of the route cancelled and transferred to the northern extension of [[State Highway 163 (Texas)|SH 163]] in 1957.  The current route was designated on its current path in 1976 to replace US 81 and US 287, which were routed onto a new built upgraded parallel path, and State Highway 114, which was moved to a different routing in the state.
