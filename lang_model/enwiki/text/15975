'''Williams College''' is a [[private university|private,<noinclude></noinclude>]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] located in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]].  Founded in 1793, Williams is the second oldest college in Massachusetts. According to current and many past [[US News and World Report]] rankings, Williams is the #1 liberal arts college in the United States. As of 2007, the school has an enrollment of 2,003 undergraduate students and 46 graduate students.<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}</ref> Williams forms part of the historic [[Little Three|"Little Three"]], along with [[Wesleyan University]] and [[Amherst College]].

Williams was established in [[1793]] with funds from the estate of [[Ephraim Williams]] as a [[men's college]], located in [[the Berkshires]] in northwestern [[Massachusetts]], at the foot of [[Mount Greylock]]. In [[1834]], the first non-secret fraternity in the [[United States]], [[Delta Upsilon]], was founded on its campus. Fraternities were phased out beginning in [[1962]].<ref>{{cite web
  | title =Elimination of fraternities
  | url =http://wso.williams.edu/wiki/index.php/Elimination_of_fraternities
  | accessdate = 2007-09-19 }}</ref> The college became coeducational in [[1970]]. 

There are three academic curricular divisions ([[humanities]], [[natural sciences|sciences]], and [[social sciences]]), 24 departments, 33 majors, and two small [[master's degree|master's-degree]] programs in [[art history]] and [[development economics]]. There are 315 voting faculty members, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 7:1. The college also sponsors the [[Williams-Mystic]] program at [[Mystic Seaport]]; the Williams-Exeter Programme at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]] of [[Oxford University]]; and Williams in New York (also known as WINY or Williams@NY).

The [[academic year]] follows a 4-1-4 schedule of two four-course [[semester]]s plus a one-course "winter study" term in January.  An intensive summer research schedule involves about 200 students on campus doing projects with professors. 

==History==
[[Image:Chapin.jpg|thumb|Chapin Hall <U+2014> Williamstown, MA, USA]]
Colonel [[Ephraim Williams]] was an officer in the Massachusetts militia and a member of a prominent landowning family. His [[Will (law)|will]] included a bequest to support and maintain a free school to be established in the town of [[Williamstown, Massachusetts|West Hoosac]], Massachusetts, provided that the town change its name to [[Williamstown, Massachusetts|Williamstown]]. Williams was killed at the [[Battle of Lake George]] on [[September 8]], [[1755]].<ref>{{cite web

After [[Shay's Rebellion]], the Williamstown Free School opened with 15 students on [[October 26]], [[1791]]. Not long afterward, the trustees of the school petitioned the Massachusetts legislature to convert the free school to a tuition-based college. The legislature agreed and on [[June 22]], [[1793]], Williams College was chartered.

In [[1806]], a student prayer meeting gave rise to the American Foreign Mission Movement.  In August of that year, five students met in the maple grove of Sloan's Meadow to pray. A thunderstorm drove them to the shelter of a haystack, and the fervor of the ensuing meeting inspired them to take the [[Gospel]] abroad. The students went on to build the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], the first American organization to send [[missionary|missionaries]] overseas.  The Haystack Monument near Mission Park on the Williams Campus commemorates the meeting.  

By [[1815]], Williams had only two buildings and 58 students, and was in serious financial trouble.  In [[1821]], the president of the college, [[Zephaniah Swift Moore]], who had accepted his position believing that the college would move east, abandoned Williams.  He took 15 students with him, and became the first president of [[Amherst College]]. According to legend, Moore also took portions of the Williams College library. Though plausible, the transfer of books is unsubstantiated. Moore died just two years later after founding Amherst, and was succeeded by Heman Humphrey, a trustee of Williams College.<ref>{{cite web

==Academics==

===Reputation===
Williams has produced the most [[Rhodes Scholars]] of any liberal arts college in the country,  with 37. 

Williams has tied for 1st in the "academic reputation" category each year that ''U.S. News'' has produced a survey, sharing that honor with rival [[Amherst College]].


Williams is ranked #1 overall according to the fifth annual report by the National Collegiate Scouting Association which ranks colleges based on student-athlete graduation rates, academic strength and athletic prowess. Rounding out the top five are Amherst College, Duke University, University  of California (San Diego), and the University of Notre Dame.<ref>http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/08-20-2007/0004648309&EDATE=</ref>

Williams currently holds 1st place in [[U.S. News and World Report]]'s most recent ranking of the top liberal arts colleges in America <ref>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1libartco_brief.php</ref> maintaining a streak of five consecutive years as #1. Williams has been 1st seven times since 1989. Williams is ranked eighth in the [[Washington Monthly]] rankings <ref>http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0609.libarts.html</ref>. Williams ranked fifth, after Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Stanford, in a 2004 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' survey of the "feeder schools" to the top fifteen business, law, and medical schools in the country.<ref>http://www.wsjclassroom.com/pdfs/wsj_college_092503.pdf</ref>

===Admissions===
In 2006, Williams College received 6000 applications and admitted 1,145, an acceptance rate of 19 percent.<ref>{{cite web

===Oxford Style Tutorials===
One of the distinctive features of a Williams education is modeled after the tutorial system widely used in the higher education system of the United Kingdom as well as the academic legacy set by [[Mark Hopkins]] sitting on one side of a log with a student on the other. It is particularly aimed at sophomores. In 2001, the faculty voted to expand the signature tutorial program. <ref>http://www.williams.edu/admin/news/strategicplanning/curricularinnovation/facultyvote.html</ref> 

In this system, classes are capped at 10 students. Pairs of students meet with the professor once a week for an hour. Each week, one of the students writes and presents a paper while the other student critiques it. The same pair reverses roles for the next week. Usually, the professor takes a more limited role than in a traditional lecture class.<ref>{{cite web

  | publisher =Williams College
  | url =http://www.williams.edu/home/fast_facts/
  | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}</ref> Students fill out Course Surveys at the end of each semester, which play a large role in determining faculty tenure decisions. Recently, there has been controversy over popular teachers being denied tenure based on other factors, including publication rates. <ref>http://www.williamsrecord.com/wr/?view=article&section=news&id=8830</ref>
Williams offers Olmsted awards to 4 secondary teachers nominated by the graduating class.

Notable former and present faculty include:
*[[Edward Burger]] a [[math]] professor who has written a popular book called "Coincidences, Chaos and all that Math Jazz."  Burger is one of four recipients of the Mathematical Association of America's Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics on the Williams Math faculty.  The other three are Frank Morgan, Colin Adams, and Tom Garrity. 
*[[James MacGregor Burns]] and [[Susan Dunn]], who have authored seminal studies on presidential leadership, notably that of Franklin, Theodore and Eleanor Roosevelt {"The Three Roosevelts")
*[[Raymond Chang]] who has written high school and college textbooks in [[Chemistry]]

One of the onlookers bought ribbons from a nearby millinery store to pin on Williams' players, and the only color available was purple.

<blockquote>I never saw a purple cow <br>
I never hope to see one; <br>
But I can tell you, anyhow, <br>
I'd rather see than be one! <br>

==Student Activities==
===Student media===

'''The Williams Record'''

The longest running independent newspaper at Williams is the [http://www.williamsrecord.com/ ''Williams Record''], a weekly [[broadsheet]] paper published on Wednesdays. The newspaper was founded in 1885, and now has a weekly [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of 3,000 [[broadsheet]] copies distributed in Williamstown, in addition to more than 600 subscribers across the country.

The newspaper does not receive financial support from the college or from the student government, allowing it considerable leeway in criticizing both on its editorial pages. 
To maintain its independent status, the Record relies on revenue generated by local and national ads sales, subscriptions, and voluntary contributions for use of its web site. 

Both Sawyer Library and the College Archives maintain more than a century's worth of publicly accessible, bound volumes of the Record. The newspaper provides access free of charge to a searchable database of articles stretching back to 1998 on its web site.

'''The Gulielmensian'''

The student yearbook is called The Gulielmensian, which supposedly means "Williams Thing" in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]. It was published irregularly in the 1990s, but has been annual for the past several years and dates back to the mid 19th century.<ref>{{cite web

It includes a page titled [http://wso.williams.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page/ Willipedia] which uses the Wikipedia format and focuses on student groups, buildings, people, and events which relate to the college.  Originally founded in 1994, it is one of the oldest college or university student-run online services.

'''Other publications'''

Numerous smaller campus publications are also produced each year, including The Mad Cow, a humor magazine, and the Literary Review, a literary magazine.

===Williams Trivia Contest===
At the end of virtually every semester since 1966, the Williams College radio station has hosted an all-night, eight-hour [[trivia]] contest. Teams of students, alumni, professors, friends and others compete to answer questions on a variety of subjects, while simultaneously identifying songs and performing designated tasks. The winning team's only prize is the obligation to create and host the following semester's contest.<ref name= "trivia rules">{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-09-19 }}</ref>  

The precise date of the debut contest is uncertain. Most spring contests occur in early May, but during its first decade, Williams Trivia was sometimes held in March or February. Assuming a May date, [[Lawrence University]]'s 50-hour-long [[Great Midwest Trivia Contest]], first held on [[April 29]], [[1966]], would be the oldest continuous competition of its sort in the United States, but if the first Williams contest was held earlier, it would be the oldest.<ref>{{cite web

While other college-based trivia contests in the United States emphasize marathon endurance and revel in the obscurity of their arcana, the aim of the Williams contest is to cram as much evocative and entertaining material into as concentrated a space as possible. Lasting just eight hours, a typical Williams Trivia contest will demand between 900 and 1,200 separate "bits" of trivial information in eight hours.<ref name= "trivia rules"/>
===Athletics===
The school's athletic teams are called the Ephmen, or the Ephs (pronounced [if] in [[International Phonetic Alphabet for English|IPA]]) <U+2014> a shortening of the first name of founder Ephraim Williams.  They participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division III and the [[New England Small College Athletic Conference]] (NESCAC). Williams also has 2 Division I sports, skiing and squash.

According to data published by the United States Department of Education<ref>http://ope.ed.gov/athletics/main.asp</ref>, Williams (as of 2004-05) spends more money on its athletic programs than any other Division III school, with the exception of [[Christopher Newport University]], which spends 2% more.  Williams is ranked #1 among Division III schools for athletic spending per student.

Williams has a traditional rivalry with Amherst College and Wesleyan University.  The "[[Little Three]]," a subset of [[NESCAC]], comprises the three schools. Williams and Amherst participate in notably intense competition, dating back more than a century.

Until 1994, Williams was not permitted, by NESCAC rules, to compete in team NCAA competition. By virtue of strong individual competitors, the Williams Women's Swimming & Diving team won the school's first national title in 1981, and claimed the title in 1982 as well.  Williams played in the 2003 and 2004 men's basketball Division III national championship games, winning the title in March 2003. Men's basketball also played in the 1997 and 1998 final fours.  Williams was the first New England basketball team to have won a Division III championship.

Williams teams to win national titles since Williams began participating in NCAA tournaments in 1994 include men's tennis (three titles), women's crew (three), women's tennis (two), men's cross country (two), women's cross country (two), men's basketball, women's indoor track and field, and men's soccer. Other sports include women's lacrosse, women's field hockey, men's golf, men's and women's swimming and diving and men's track and field.

Williams also has had success winning the [[NACDA Director's Cup]], presented to the institution within each NCAA division that has the greatest overall success in NCAA sanctioned-championships.  Williams has won the [[NACDA Director's Cup]] 11 of the 12 years since its inception.

In 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 the college achieved #1 rankings in both academics and athletics within its peer groups (liberal arts colleges as ranked by [[U.S. News and World Report]] and NCAA Division III institutions as ranked by the Director's Cup calculations, respectively).  Dual #1 rankings in any single year was an unprecedented achievement among the 1,053 NCAA member institutions. Williams was also ranked by the National Collegiate Scouting Association in 2006 as number 1 among all colleges and universities across Divisions I-III.
====Club sports====
Williams has an active club and intramural sports program, offering 13 club sports including [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], [[Williams College Rugby Football|rugby]], horseback riding, cycling, volleyball, and water polo.  Approximately 50% of Williams' students compete on at least one varsity, junior varsity, or formal club team.

==Recent events==
[[Image:Ephtowers.jpg|thumb|Thompson Chapel, Lasell Bell Tower <U+2014> Williamstown, MA, USA]]
In 2003 Williams began the first of three massive construction projects. The $60 million '62 Center for Theatre and Dance was the first project to be successfully completed in the spring of 2005.  The other two projects, the $44 million Student Center and $123 million Stetson-Sawyer project, experienced several financial setbacks, but have continued nonetheless with strong support from the Administration and the Board of Trustees.  In fact, the new Student Center, named The [[Paresky Center]] for its principal donors, David '60 and Linda Paresky, is completed, and has been accessible to students since February 16, 2007.

Construction has already begun on the Stetson-Sawyer project with completion scheduled somewhere by the end of the decade.  The entire project calls for two new academic buildings, the removal of the Sawyer Library from its current location, and the construction of a new Library at the rear of a renovated Stetson Hall. College trustees initially balked at the cost of the Stetson-Sawyer project and were calling for upwards of $17 million to be cut from the library component of the project. 

A recent addition to the campus set the tone for style and comprehensiveness for renovations and significant additions to campus buildings in the 21st century. The $38 million Unified Science Center housing Schow Science Library was erected in 2001 and is popular among students. This building unifies the formerly separate lab spaces of the Physics, Chemistry, and Biology departments. In addition, it houses Schow Science library, notable for its unified science materials holdings and architecture. It features vaulted ceilings and an atrium with windows into laboratories on the second through fourth floors of the science center.

===The Williams House System===
After several years of planning, the College decided to group undergraduates starting with the class of 2010 into four geographically coherent clusters, or "Neighborhoods," philosophically related to those at several Ivy League universities.  Since fall 2006, first-years have been housed in Sage Hall, Williams Hall and Mission Park, while upperclassmen inhabit former First-year dormitories East College, Lehman Hall, Fayerweather, and Morgan, as well as the current upperclass dormitories to form the four houses. A student vote on the names of the four "neighborhoods" selected 'Currier', 'Wood', 'Spencer' and 'Dodd' by a simple majority. These were the temporary working names assigned prior to voting. Incoming freshmen are randomly assigned to clusters as an entry (a group of freshmen who live together with a male and female junior advisor). Rising sophomores have the option to be randomly assigned to a different neighborhood from the rest of their entry in groups of six or fewer.  This new system is an attempt to integrate all undergraduates more successfully than was previously possible, mixing students representing a variety of interests and ethnicities, and supporting each House with its own dining and recreational facilities.  Moreover, this new housing system will attempt to abolish the stigmas allegedly associated with certain dormitories.

===Capital campaign===
Williams is currently engaged in one of the largest capital campaigns ever undertaken by a liberal arts college, with a goal of raising $400 million by September, 2008.  The college has raised $400 million towards this goal as of the end of June, 2007, which is a year and a half ahead of schedule. As of June 2006, Williams endowments were valued at approximately $1.6 billion.

===Initiatives===
*Climate Initiative
*Diversity Initiative

==Alumni society==
The Society of Alumni of Williams College is the oldest existing alumni society of any academic institution in the United States, and may be the oldest alumni organization in the world.  The Society of Alumni was founded during the "Amherst crisis" in [[1821]], when Williams College President [[Zephaniah Swift Moore]] left Williams.  Graduates of Williams formed the Society to ensure that Williams would not have to close, and raised enough money to ensure the future survival of the school.

In the years since, the generosity of alumni has given Williams an endowment of over $1 billion, as of 2006.<ref>{{cite web

Not affiliated with the Society of Alumni, but also serving the college's alumni is the [[Williams Club]] in [[New York City]].  Located at 24 East 39th Street in [[Manhattan]], the club is open to the paying public as a hotel and restaurant, and operates as a meeting space for Williams alumni living in and visiting the city.  It is also the headquarters for the Williams@NY program, accommodating Williams college students and the director of the program, Professor Robert Jackall.
