The '''cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact''' covers the potential future implications that [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|contact with extraterrestrial civilizations]] could have on culture, science, technology, politics, religion, law, and other aspects of society. The ultimate results of such contact could vary greatly based on the benevolence or malevolence of the extraterrestrial civilization, the technological advancement of the extraterrestrial culture, whether communication takes place through electromagnetic waves or directly, and the mutual level of understanding between the two cultures which are contacting each other.<ref name=ptrsa-2010 /> Based on these factors, there are various contact scenarios which each cover different types of civilizations and contact, and the specific implications of contact with each type.

The cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact has often been likened to the cultural impact resulting from the meeting of two vastly different human cultures on Earth. Results of such contact have included the devastation of the civilization being contacted, and this has been suggested as one of the possible results of extraterrestrial contact.<ref name=daily-galaxy-1/> However, as the nature of extraterrestrial civilizations is not known, and contact with any such species has not yet taken place, it is impossible to state with absolute certainty what the result of extraterrestrial contact will be for humanity. Nevertheless, various systems of assessment of the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact have been created.<!--All lead material is supported by sources within the body of the article.--><!--This page does not deal with UFOlogy, conspiracy theories, exopolitics (whose page here was deleted), or anything similar.-->

[[File:Arecibo message.svg|thumb|100px|The [[Arecibo message]], sent to the globular cluster [[Messier 13|M13]] after Project Cyclops's recommendations were not implemented.<ref name=phys-imp/>]]To detect extraterrestrial civilizations with radio telescopes, one must identify an artificial coherent signal against a background of various natural astrophysical phenomena which also produce radio waves. Such telescopes include the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]], and the newer<ref>{{cite news |author = [[Daniel Terdiman]] |url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10121889-52.html |title = SETI's large-scale telescope scans the skies |date = 12 December 2008 |work = CNET News |accessdate = 27 March 2012 }}</ref> [[Allen Telescope Array]], located in [[Hat Creek, California]].  Historically, various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding. In the 1970s, [[Project Cyclops]] was commissioned by [[NASA]] in order to investigate the most effective way to search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence.<ref name=phys-imp>{{cite book |title = [[Physics of the Impossible]] |publisher = Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |author = Kaku, Michio |year = 2009 |isbn = 0-307-27882-4 }}</ref> However, following the report's recommendations being not implemented in favor of a much more modest plan of messaging extraterrestrial intelligence, NASA drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to private donations to continue their search.<ref name=seti-funding>{{cite web | url=http://www.seti.org/center-for-seti-research | title=Center for SETI Research | publisher=SETI Institute | work=SETI Institute website | accessdate=May 31, 2012}}</ref>

With the discovery of numerous [[extrasolar planets]] in the late twentieth to early twenty-first centuries, some of which may be habitable, governments have renewed their interest in funding new programs. In 2006, the [[European Space Agency]] launched [[COROT]] to search for exoplanets, the first craft dedicated to that purpose.<ref name=ESAPR2006>{{cite press release |title = Europe goes searching for rocky planets |publisher = ESA |date = 2006-10-26 |accessdate = 26 March 2012 |url = http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=21129 }}</ref> and in 2009, [[NASA]] launched the ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'' spacecraft in 2009 to search for extrasolar planets,<ref Name="BBC7March">{{cite news |author = BBC Staff |title = Nasa launches Earth hunter probe |work = [[BBC News]]|date = 7 March 2009 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7926277.stm |accessdate = 27 March 2012 }}</ref> As of March 2012, ''Kepler'' has detected 61<ref name=keplersite>{{cite web |url = http://kepler.nasa.gov |title = Kepler: A Search for Habitable Planets |work = kepler.nasa.gov |accessdate = March 26, 2012 }}</ref> of the {{extrasolar planet counts|planet_count}} confirmed exoplanets.

The new discoveries of planets, in particular potentially [[habitable planet]]s, have enabled [[SETI]] and [[Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence|METI]] programs to refocus projects related to [[communication with extraterrestrial intelligence]]. In 2009, [[A Message From Earth]] was sent to the [[Gliese 581]] system, which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed [[Gliese 581 d]] and the more habitable but unconfirmed [[Gliese 581 g]].<ref name=astronow>{{cite news |url = http://www.astronomynow.com/news/n1005/03seti6a/ |title = SETI: Cosmic Call |work = Astronomy Now |date = 3 May 2010 |accessdate = March 27, 2012 |author = Cooper, Keith }}</ref> Subsequently, the [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|SETILive]] effort, which began in 2012, aims to use human volunteers to analyze data from the [[Allen Telescope Array]] and search for potential alien signals which computers might miss due to terrestrial [[radio interference]].<ref name=space-12>{{cite news |url = http://www.space.com/14723-seti-live-search-extraterrestrials-public.html |title = New Site Lets you Search for Extraterrestrial Life |work = Space.com |date = 29 February 2012 |agency = Space.com |accessdate = March 27, 2012 |author = Moskowitz, Clara }}</ref> The data used for the study is obtained from observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope.<ref name="SETI exoplanets" />

In addition to radio-based methods, some projects, such as [[SEVENDIP]], are attempting to utilize other areas of the electromagnetic spectrum in order to search for extraterrestrial signals. Various other projects are searching not for electromagnetic signals ''per se'', but want to use electromagnetic radiation in order to find other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, such as [[megascale engineering|megascale]] [[astroengineering]] projects.<ref name=seti-berkeley>{{cite web | url=http://seti.berkeley.edu/ | title=The Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence at Berkeley | publisher=University of California at Berkeley | accessdate=April 05, 2012}}</ref>

While there have been several [[false positive]] signals detected throughout the history of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, such as the [[Wow! signal]], to date, no evidence has been found that these signals are indeed of intelligent origin.<ref name=krulwich-2010>{{cite news | url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2010/05/28/126510251/aliens-found-in-ohio-the-wow-signal | title=Aliens Found In Ohio?

=== Systems for the assessment of the potential impact of extraterrestrial contact ===
Various scales, such as the [[Torino Scale]] and the [[Rio Scale]], have been devised in order to better gauge the types of contact with an extraterrestrial civilization and the consequentiality of each type. The ultimate impact of extraterrestrial impact can be said to depend on the nature of the discovery, the nature of the extraterrestrial beings, and where they are located with respect to the Earth.<ref name=almar-2011>{{cite journal|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AcAau..68..358A|bibcode=2011AcAau..68..358A|title=The discovery of ETI as a high-consequence, low-probability event|author1=Alm<U+00E1>r|first1=Iv<U+00E1>n|last2=Tarter|first2=Jill|volume=68|year=2011|pages=358|journal=Acta Astronautica|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.07.007|issue=3<U+2013>4}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Specific factors include whether communication was conducted through radio, the information content contained in a message, whether such a message was discovered as part of a specialized SETI effort or through general astronomical observations, or whether the civilization is detected through mechanisms like radiation leakage from astroengineering installations as opposed to a deliberately sent message, among other factors.<ref name=almar-1995>{{cite conference|bibcode=1995ASPC...74..499A|title=The Consequences of a Discovery: Different Scenarios|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995ASPC...74..499A| author= Alm<U+00E1>r, Iv<U+00E1>n|year=1993, 1995| conference=''Progress in the Search for Extraterrestrial Life''| proceedings = Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series |editor=Seth Shostak (ed.)| publisher = Astronomical Society of the Pacific|isbn=0-937707-93-7}}</ref> In addition to all of these factors, whether or not the authenticity of a supposed extraterrestrial signal has been confirmed, and to what level of confidence this confirmation is, will play a role in the ultimate impact of extraterrestrial contact.

Another study conducted by Steven Dick at the [[United States Naval Observatory]] has attempted to view the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact through a historical lens.<ref name=dick-1993>{{cite conference|bibcode=1995ASPC...74..521D|title=Consequences of Success in SETI: Lessons from the History of Science|author1=Dick|first1=S.|volume=74|year=1995|pages=521|proceedings=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series|conference=A New Era in Bioastronomy}}</ref> By analyzing events of similar gravity to extraterrestrial contact in the history of science, the study shows that the impact of extraterrestrial contact would be most influenced by the information content of an extraterrestrial message, and the nature of the information received if there is any.<ref name=dick-1993 /> The study recognizes that there would be two classes of impacts of extraterrestrial contact, short-term impact and long-term impact.<ref name=dick-1993 /> Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible contact scenario than physical contact through actual extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study does not see commonly given scenarios of the Europeans colonizing the Americas as an accurate representation of information-only contact, but rather sees events of profound scientific significance, such as the [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican]] and [[History of evolutionary thought|Darwinian revolution]]s as being more representative of how humanity will be impacted by extraterrestrial contact.<ref name=dick-1993 />

The separation between humanity and the contacting civilization in terms of spatial distance has also been used to assess the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact. Historical examples show that, the greater the distance between two different cultures which have come into contact, the less of a threat the contacted civilization sees to itself and its culture.<ref name=schetsche-2005 /> Therefore, contact which takes place within the Solar System, and especially that which takes place in the immediate vicinity of Earth, is likely to cause the greatest immediate disruption of humanity.<ref name=schetsche-2005 /> Furthermore, these effects will be more negative the closer extraterrestrial contact occurs to the Earth.<ref name=schetsche-2005 /> On a smaller scale, people located near the exact epicenter of extraterrestrial contact would feel more of an effect than those living in more remote parts of the world.<ref name=schetsche-2005 /> However, if this contact has multiple epicenters, the shock would be greater and would be more global in nature than a single-epicenter instance of contact.<ref name=schetsche-2005 />

In addition to expert discourse on assessment of contact events, studies have been conducted on the general public to track its beliefs regarding the general result of extraterrestrial contact. A study, involving polling of United States and Chinese university students conducted by [[SETI Institute|Vakoch]] and Lee and published in the journal ''[[Acta Astronautica]]'' in 2000, provides [[factor analysis]]<ref group=note>Each participant of the study was asked to provide a score of 1 to 6 on the survey for each question, with 1 corresponding to complete disagreement and 6 to complete agreement, with values between standing for views of varying certainty and uncertainty depending on their proximity to 1 and 6. A [[varimax rotation]] was subsequently performed on the dataset, in order to find correlations between answers to different questions which may be manifestations of the same concept. Some items on the survey were ''reverse scored'', with a survey input of 6 corresponding to a score of 1, 1 to 6, etc.</ref> on data collected from participants, testing, among other factors, the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will make contact with it eventually.<ref name=vakoch-2000>{{cite journal| title=Reactions to Receipt of a Message from Extraterrestrial Intelligence: A Cross-Cultural Empirical Study | author=Vakoch, D.A and Y. S. Lee | journal=Acta Astronautica | year=2000 | volume=46 | issue=10<U+2013>12 | pages=737<U+2013>744 | doi=10.1016/S0094-5765(00)00041-2}}{{subscription required}}</ref> The studies also show smaller, but still large, weighted correlations between participants believing that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs, and how conservative such religious beliefs may be, with more conservative individuals holding extraterrestrial contact to be more harmful. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.

== Contact scenarios ==
Various models exist in scientific literature as well as [[science fiction]] which attempt to predict how extraterrestrial civilizations will interact with humanity. Predictions of these models range widely, from sophisticated civilizations which could advance human civilization tremendously in many areas, to imperial powers which are willing and able to draw upon vast reserves of force to subjugate humanity.<ref name=ptrsa-2010>{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rsta.2010.0229|accessdate=5 April 2012|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1936/656.full.pdf+html|title=Fear, pandemonium, equanimity and delight: Human responses to extra-terrestrial life|year=2011|last1=Harrison|first1=A. A.|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=369|issue=1936|pages=656}}</ref> Some theories predict that an extraterrestrial civilization may be advanced enough to no longer use biology, instead living inside advanced computers.

The implications of discovery are highly variable, depending on what level of aggressiveness the civilization interacting with humanity has,<ref name=ras-paper/>, the type of ethics the civilization possesses,<ref name=actaastro-11>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.07.003}}{{subscription required}}</ref> and on how much humans and the extraterrestrial species have in common biologically.<ref name=ff-2000>{{cite journal|title=When SETI Succeeds: The Impact of High-Information Contact|year=2000|url=http://www.futurefoundation.org/documents/hum_pro_wrk1.pdf|editor1-first=Allen|editor1-last=Tough}}</ref> This will govern the type and the amount of dialogue which can take place between the two species.<ref name=ff-2000/> Additionally, whether contact takes place physically or through electromagnetic waves will govern the magnitude of the long-term implications of contact.<ref name=ff-2000 /> In the case of electromagnetic-wave contact, the long silences between the reception of one message and another would mean that the content of any message would particularly affect the consequentiality of contact.<ref name=brookings-report>{{cite web | url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19640053196_1964053196.pdf | title=Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs | accessdate=May 19, 2012 | author=Michael, Donald N.

===Benevolent civilizations===
Various predictions have been made with regard to how a benevolent civilization would interact with the human species. Knowing the technological state of humanity, a benevolent species with advancements far beyond that of humanity may teach humanity knowledge such as a physical [[theory of everything]], usage of [[zero-point energy]], and how to travel [[faster than light]], as speculated by Harrison and Dick (2000).<ref name=ff-2000/> Collaboration with such a civilization could initially be in the arts and humanities before moving to the hard sciences, and conversely, artists may spearhead collaboration.<ref name=ff-2000/>

[[File:Ivy_Mike_-_mushroom_cloud.jpg|thumb|250px|An advanced, benevolent extraterrestrial civilization may force humanity to eliminate risks which may destroy its fledgling civilization.]]Knowing its own past of war and plunder, and that it possesses superweapons which may destroy its civilization, Tough (1986) proposes that an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization would be likely to try and help the human species, rather than attempting to destroy it.<ref name=tough-1986>{{cite journal | url=http://ieti.org/articles/future.pdf | title=What Role will Extraterrestrials Play in Humanity's Future? | author=Tough, Allen | journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society | year=1986 | volume=39 | pages=491<U+2013>498 | bibcode=1986JBIS...39..491T}}</ref> On a larger scale, due to the greater longevity of cooperative civilizations versus uncooperative and aggressive ones, extraterrestrial civilizations as a whole would be more likely to aid humanity.<ref name=baum-2011 /> In order to do so, various methods may be used, including intervention only to avert catastrophe, intervention by advice and consent of world leaders, and forcible corrective action.

The first of these methods would involve only limited intervention over time in the affairs of humanity in order to stop events which may destroy human civilization completely, such as nuclear war or asteroid impact.<ref name=tough-1986 /> Intervention by advice or consent of world leaders would more closely involve the extraterrestrials in the affairs of humanity, ''preventing'' human dangers from ever happening at humanity's own discretion.<ref name=tough-1986 /> Forcible corrective action would require humanity to reduce enormous dangers against its will, but will nevertheless be a good-faith attempt to help humanity advance to the next stage of civilization.<ref name=tough-1986 />

Cultural instruction of humanity is another method through which an advanced extraterrestrial society may interact with humanity. It is likely that this information will be of an informed-consent nature, with much advice being offered but nothing being implemented unless world leaders are willing to accept what is given by the extraterrestrial species.<ref name=tough-1986 /> While coercive aid may be possible, and the advanced extraterrestrials would likely see their own cultural practices as far superior to those of humanity, it may be unlikely that this method of aid is used in cultural cooperation.<ref name=tough-1986 /> Instruction of a civilization in its "technological adolescence," such as humanity, would likely not involve discourse in the sciences and technology, but would rather focus on morality and ethics in order to ensure that the civilization does not destroy itself with technology it is not yet ready to use.<ref name=lemarchand-2006>{{cite journal|arxiv=0807.4518|first1=Guillermo A.|last1=Lemarchand|title=Counting on Beauty: The role of aesthetic, ethical, and physical universal principles for interstellar communication}}</ref>

It is unlikely that the prevention of immediate dangers and preventing future catastrophes from occurring will be conducted through radio, as these methods would demand constant surveillance and quick action.<ref name=tough-1986 /> However, cultural cooperation may take place through radio or a space probe in the Solar System, as radio waves can communicate information about advanced technologies and cultures to humanity.<ref name=tough-1986 />

Even if an ancient and advanced extraterrestrial civilization wishes to help humanity, the human species could suffer from a loss of identity and confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the extraterrestrial civilization.<ref name=ff-2000/> However, a benevolent civilization would probably calibrate its contact with humanity in such a way that the unintended consequences are minimized.<ref name=ras-paper />

===Malevolent civilizations===
There is much speculation as to how humanity would react to an extraterrestrial invasion of Earth. Science fiction films often depict humans successfully repelling an alien invasion, but this is disputed by scientists on the grounds that an extraterrestrial civilization with sufficient power to reach the Earth would be able to destroy human civilization with minimal effort.<ref name=phys-imp /><ref name=b-g>{{cite news |url = http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2012/03/13/alien-encounters-a-few-sage-and-sagan-thoughts-on-invasion/ |title = 'Alien Encounters': A few sage (and Sagan) thoughts on invasion |work = Los Angeles Times Hero Complex |date = 13 March 2012 |agency = Los Angeles Times |accessdate = March 28, 2012 |author = Boucher, Geoff }}</ref> Due to the relative ease of conducting interstellar war for a powerful extraterrestrial civilization, operations which are enormous on a human scale, such as destroying all major population centers on a planet, bombarding a planet with deadly neutrons, or even traveling to another planetary system in order to accomplish the task, may be important foreign-policy tools for a malevolent and totalitarian civilization.<ref name=freitas-1978 />

A paper written by James W. Deardorff published in the [[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1986 speculates that a small fraction of the intelligent life-forms in the galaxy may be aggressive, but the actual aggressiveness or benevolence of the civilizations actually covers a wide spectrum, with some civilizations "policing" others.<ref name=ras-paper>{{cite journal |title = Possible Extraterrestrial Strategy for Earth |author = Deardorff, James W. |journal = Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |year = 1986 |bibcode = 1986QJRAS..27...94D |volume = 27 |pages = 94 }}</ref> <!--The paper states in its abstract that any communication by extraterrestrials via radio telescope would be censored by governments initially, though at the time it was written, the [[Cold War]] between the United States and the former Soviet Union was still ongoing.--> Malevolent extraterrestrial life may indeed be rare in the Universe, as, drawing parallels to what has happened on Earth, belligerent and autocratic nations are the ones which have lasted for the shortest periods of time, and humanity is seeing a shift away from these characteristics in its own sociopolitical systems.<ref name=ff-2000 /> In addition, the causes of war may be diminished greatly for a civilization with access to the galaxy, as there are prodigious quantities of natural resources in space which may be used without resort to violence.<ref name=phys-imp /><ref name=ff-2000 />

[[Carl Sagan]] inferred that due to the enormous technological prowess that a civilization would have to attain to reach the stars and come to Earth, it must have transcended war in order to avoid self-destruction. Upon their arrival on Earth, representatives of this civilization would treat humanity with dignity and respect; humanity, due to its technological backwardness with respect to that civilization, would have no choice but to do the same.<ref name=hufpo-sci>{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/29/space-alien-encounter_n_1389896.html |title = Space Alien Encounter Scenario Has Scientists Saying How We Will React |work = HuffPost Science |date = 30 March 2012 |agency = Huffington Post |accessdate = March 30, 2012 }}</ref> [[Seth Shostak]], an astronomer at the SETI Institute, dissented from this view, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and in a later interview,<ref name=space-2012>{{cite news | url=http://www.space.com/15721-battleship-movie-alien-life-seti.html | title=When Aliens Attack: 'Battleship' Strategy with SETI Astronomer Seth Shostak | work=Search for Life | date=May 17, 2012 | agency=Space.com | accessdate=May 19, 2012 | author=Chow, Denise}}</ref> stated that an explorer civilization which would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Taking a similar view, [[Ragbir Bhathal]] has stated that, with the laws of evolution being the same on Earth as they are on another habitable planet, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization could have a colonizer relationship with humanity, much as the Aboriginal peoples of Australia were destroyed by the British colonizers.<ref name=ff-2000 />

Political leaders have also considered the prospect of the human reaction to alien contact. At his 1987 speech to the [[United Nations General Assembly]], [[Ronald Reagan]] stated, "I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world."<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/movies/moviesspecial/02hobe.html |title = The Cold War Sci-Fi Parable That Fell to Earth |work = New York Times Movies |date = 2 November 2008 |agency = The New York Times |accessdate = March 28, 2012 |author = Hoberman, J. }}</ref>

=== Equally-advanced and more-advanced civilizations ===
[[File:Dyson_Sphere_Diagram-en.svg|thumb|250px|An advanced extraterrestrial civilization would likely not attempt projects with severe ecological implications, like the construction of a Dyson sphere.]][[Robert Freitas]] (1978) has speculated that technological advancement and energy usage of a civilization, as measured by its rating on the [[Kardashev scale]], both in absolute terms and relative to another civilization, may play an important role in the result of extraterrestrial contact.<ref name=freitas-1978>{{cite book | title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization | publisher=Xenology Research Institute | author=Freitas Jr., Robert A. | year=1975-1979, 2008 | location=Sacramento, California, United States | url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm}}</ref> In the specific case of humanity, interactions with an extraterrestrial civilization of similar technological prowess would likely take place through radio, given the infeasibility of interstellar spaceflight for species at a similar technological level to that of the human race. Such an interaction would, by its very nature and the long transit times of radio waves between stars, not lead to serious diplomatic relations, or indeed any significant future interaction at all, between the two species.<ref name=freitas-1978/>

Contact with civilizations which are significantly more advanced than humanity would most likely take place within the [[Solar System]], as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. <ref name=freitas-1978 /> Consequently, such contact would most likely take place with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, below which regular interstellar travel would be impossible.<ref name=freitas-1978/> Interactions of this type would most likely be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization in order to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.<ref name=freitas-1978/>

Billingham (2000) has proposed that civilization which is far more technologically advanced than humanity is also likely to be culturally and ethically advanced as well, and would therefore be unlikely to conduct astroengineering projects which would cause harm to civilization. Such projects may include [[Dyson sphere]]s which completely enclose stars and capture all energy coming from them, which while well within the capability of an advanced civilization and providing an enormous amount of energy, would nevertheless not be attempted.<ref name=billingham-2000>{{cite conference | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ASPC..213..667B | title=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series |publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific | accessdate=May 06, 2012 | author=Billingham, John | editor=Lemarchand, G., and Meech, K (eds.)|booktitle=Summary of Results of the Seminar on the Cultural Impact of Extraterrestrial Contact | year=2000 | conference=A New Era in Bioastronomy |pages=667<U+2013>678 | bibcode=2000ASPC..213..667B}}</ref> Consequently, such civilizations would not readily give humanity the knowledge required to build such devices.<ref name=billingham-2000 /> Nevertheless, the existence of such advanced civilizations would, if nothing else, show that civilizations have survived "technological adolescence."<ref name=billingham-2000 /> Despite the caution that such an advanced civilization would have in dealing with the nascent civilization of humanity, the late SETI researcher [[Carl Sagan]] had imagined that an advanced civilization may send those on Earth an ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica|Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Galactica]]'' with the sciences and cultures of many extraterrestrial cultures.<ref name=folger-2011>{{cite news | url=http://www.astro.umass.edu/~wqd/a191/Scientific_American/scientificamerican0111-40_SETI.pdf | title=Contact: The Day After |work=Scientific American | date=January 3, 2011 | agency=Nature Publishing Group | accessdate=May 06, 2012 | author=Folger, Tim | pages=40<U+2013>45}}</ref>

An advanced extraterrestrial civilization may not be coming to Earth in order to expand an already-burgeoning empire, as with their level of advancement they may have achieved an equilibrium, as proposed by <U+0106>irkovi<U+0107> (2008). In such an equilibrium, a civilization would only colonize a small number of stars and attempt to maximize efficiency rather than expand massive and unsustainable imperial structures.<ref name=cirkovik-2008>{{cite journal|arxiv=0805.1821|author=<U+0106>irkovi<U+0107>, Milan M.|title=Against the Empire|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2008.61.246|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|volume=61|pages=246<U+2013>254|year=2008}}</ref> This is in contrast to the classic Type III Kardashev civilization, which has access to the energy output of an entire galaxy and does not impose any limits on its future expansion.<ref name=cirkovik-2008 /> Hence, advanced civilizations in the galaxy may not resemble classic examples in science fiction, but would more closely reflect the small, independent Greek city-states, with an emphasis on cultural rather than territorial expansion.<ref name=cirkovik-2008 />

Baum ''et al.'' speculate that highly advanced civilizations are unlikely to come to Earth in order to enslave humans, as in order to achieve their level of advancement, they would have had to solve the problems of labor and resources through other means, such as creating a sustainable environment and using mechanized labor.<ref name=baum-2011/> Additionally, terrestrial life may be so different from extraterrestrial life that extraterrestrial civilizations may not use humans as a food source,<ref name=phys-imp /> because, among other marked differences in biochemistry,<ref name=phys-imp /> the [[chirality (chemistry)|chirality]], or "handedness," of molecules used by terrestrial biota may differ from those used by extraterrestrial beings.<ref name=baum-2011 />

===Extraterrestrial artifacts===
[[File:Interstellar robotic probe.gif|thumb|Robotic probes may be preferable to radio waves or microwaves as a means of interstellar communication.|left]]An extraterrestrial civilization may choose to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than radio waves for a variety of reasons. While probes themselves may take long to arrive at the Solar System, once there, they will be able to begin a sustained dialogue which cannot occur with radio waves from hundreds or perhaps thousands of light-years away from another civilization.<ref name=tough-1998-2 /> For the purposes of surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, the use of radio waves would be utterly pointless, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option apart from sending large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.<ref name=tough-1998-2 /> Despite the fact that faster-than-light travel is being seriously discussed by scientists, Tough (1998) speculates that the enormous amount of energy required to achieve superluminal speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that sublight robotic probes will still have an advantage for various applications.<ref name=tough-1998-2/>

There are various types of information that an extraterrestrial civilization may want to send to humanity by means of artifacts. Such information may include an ''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Galactica]]'', containing the wisdom of countless extraterrestrial cultures, or perhaps an invitation to engage the extraterrestrial civilization diplomatically.<ref name=tough-1998-2>{{cite journal
|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society
|title=Small Smart Interstellar Probes
|author=Tough, Allen
|volume=51
|pages=167-174
|year=1998
|url=http://www.ieti.org/tough/articles/jbis51.pdf}}</ref> A civilization which sees itself on the brink of decline may use the abilities it still possesses to send probes throughout the galaxy, with its cultures, values, religions, sciences, technologies, and laws, so that they may not die along with the civilization creating the message.<ref name=tough-1998-2 />

Numerous reasons exist as to why interstellar probes may be a preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing to make contact with Earth. As speculated by Freitas (1983), a civilization aiming to learn more about the distribution of life within the galaxy may send probes to a large number of star systems, rather than radio waves, as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the solar systems they survey.<ref name=freitas-1983 /> Furthermore, probes permit surveying of pre-technical intelligent (e.g. ''Homo sapiens'' before the 20th century) or non-intelligent populations, as well as intelligent populations who do not wish to provide information to extraterrestrial civilizations on their whereabouts and characteristics of their planets.<ref name=freitas-1983 />

Civilizations aiming to ensure the success of other populations of verifying the presence of extraterrestrial species may also use probes, due to their ability to store information on long timescales in a way that radio waves cannot, their ability to create a strong signal within a star system which can be unambiguously identified as being intelligent in origin, rather than being dismissed as a [[UFO]] or natural phenomenon, and an ability to modify any signal sent based on environmental factors in a reasonably short period of time.<ref name=freitas-1983>{{cite journal

}}</ref> In addition, the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed, decentralized beacons in individual systems, rather than a small number of powerful, centralized beacons, provides a security advantage to the contactor civilization.<ref name=freitas-1983/> Rather than reveal the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized robotic-probe beacons need not give any information which an extraterrestrial civilization does not wish to be given to others.<ref name=freitas-1983 />

== Further implications of contact ==
=== Theological ===
The confirmation of extraterrestrial intelligence may have a profound impact on religious doctrines as well, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries.<ref name=space-2>{{cite news |url = http://www.space.com/10670-extraterrestrial-life-religious-beliefs.html |title = Could Extraterrestrial Intelligence Sway Religious Beliefs? |work = Space.com |date = 24 January 2011 |agency = Space.com |accessdate = March 30, 2012 |author = Choi, Charles Q. }}</ref> However, a survey of various individuals spanning many religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence,<ref name=space-2 /> and another study conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary shows that the vast majority of individuals would not see their religion's beliefs undercut by the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence.<ref name=peters-2011>{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rsta.2010.0234|title=The implications of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life for religion|year=2011|last1=Peters|first1=T.|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=369|issue=1936|pages=644}}</ref> Surveys of religious leaders also indicate that only a small percentage are concerned about the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence fundamentally contradicting the views of the adherents of their religion.<ref name=elsevier>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.phpro.2011.08.031|title=Astrosociology and the Capacity of Major World Religions to Contextualize the Possibility of Life Beyond Earth|year=2011|last1=McAdamis|first1=E.M.|journal=Physics Procedia|volume=20|pages=338}}</ref> In fact, the chief astronomer of the [[Vatican Observatory]] and an adviser to the [[pope]] on science has stated that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] would likely treat extraterrestrial intelligence warmly.<ref name=keim-2008>{{cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/science/space/news/2008/06/alien_religion | title=Christian Theologians Prepare for Extraterrestrial Life | work=Wired | date=June 13, 2008 | agency=Cond<U+00E9> Nast | accessdate=May 20, 2012 | author=Keim, Brandon}}</ref>

Contact with extraterrestrial intelligence would not be completely inconsequential for religion, though. The same study conducted by Ted Peters showed that the majority of non-religious individuals and a significant majority of religious individuals believe that the world could face a religious crisis even if their own beliefs were unaffected.<ref name=peters-2011 /> Contact with extraterrestrial intelligence is most likely to cause a problem for Western religions, in particular traditionalist Christianity, than for Eastern ones, due to the geocentric nature of such religions.<ref name=kaufman-2012>{{cite book | title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=a_l4cNtcxpcC First Contact: Scientific Breakthroughs in the Hunt for Life Beyond Earth] | publisher=Simon and Schuster | author=Kaufman, Marc | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4391-0901-4}}</ref> However, the discovery of extraterrestrial life does not contradict basic conceptions of God, and in light of previous events and individuals in the history of science, such as the [[theory of evolution]] and the teachings of [[Giordano Bruno]], which have challenged established dogma, it is likely that existing religions will adapt similarly to the new circumstances.<ref name=freitas-1978 />

Although highly speculative, a message from extraterrestrial intelligence that could be decoded may initiate an interstellar exchange of knowledge in various disciplines, including whatever religions an extraterrestrial civilization may host. <ref name=ff-2000/> An extremely advanced but benevolent extraterrestrial civilization may also put an end to the religious conflicts which plague present-day humanity and lead to greater religious toleration worldwide.<ref name=ff-2000/> At the other extreme, contact with extraterrestrial intelligence may eliminate religion as we know it and introduce humanity to an all-encompassing faith.<ref name=daily-galaxy-1>{{cite web | url=http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2008/08/pandemics-from.html | title=The Impact of ET Contact: Europe's Scientists Discuss The Future of Humans in Space | publisher=Daily Galaxy | date=August 1, 2008 | accessdate=April 21, 2012 | author=Kazan, Casey}}</ref>

=== Political ===
Immediately upon contact with an extraterrestrial civilization by radio, Folger (2011) speculates that censorship will be likely impossible and news of the discovery will travel rapidly,<ref name=folger-2011 /> though scientific literature on the subject published during the [[Cold War]] disputes this.<ref name=ras-paper /> Media coverage of the discovery will likely die down quickly, though, as scientists begin to attempt to decipher the message and learn what the true impact of contact will ultimately be.<ref name=folger-2011 /> Different branches<ref group=note>e.g. legislative, executive, judicial</ref> of global governments may pursue their own policies on extraterrestrial contact, potentially causing power struggles within these governments.<ref name=michaud-2006/> Even in the event of contact without any ongoing conversation between extraterrestrial civilizations and humanity, contact via radio may prompt fierce disagreements over which bodies are authorized to represent the human species as a whole.<ref name=baum-2011>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2010.10.012 | arxiv=arXiv:1104.4462v2 | title=Would contact with extraterrestrials benefit or harm humanity?

Contact could create other problems with regard to global diplomacy in addition to the issue of which parties represent the Earth as a whole. The involvement of governments foreign to that whose radio astronomers receive a signal is one such issue.<ref name=michaud-2006>{{cite book | title=Contact with Alien Civilizations: Our Hopes and Fears about Encountering Extraterrestrials |publisher=Copernicus Books |author=Michaud, Michael A. G. | year=2006 | location=New York, New York, United States |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tdAFlJnH648C|isbn=978-0-387-28598-6}}</ref> Various other foreign-relations issues were discussed in the United Nations immediately prior to the launch of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes,<ref name=othman-2011 /> which are currently leaving the Solar System and contain a [[Voyager Golden Record|golden record]] in case they are found by extraterrestrial intelligence.<ref name=voyager-jpl>{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/|title=Voyager - The Interstellar Mission|author=NASA [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]|accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref> Such issues include which messages are representative of humanity, what format such messages should take, how to convey the cultural history of the Earth, and what groups should be formed on an international scale in order to study extraterrestrial intelligence in greater detail.<ref name=othman-2011>{{cite doi|10.1098/rsta.2010.0311}}</ref>

If humanity can open dialogue with an extraterrestrial civilization, Harrison (2000) the communications may ultimately lead to the creation of a "Galactic Club", which would initially begin as a loose confederation but eventually grow to become a powerful union of civilizations.<ref name=ff-2000/> As more extraterrestrial civilizations, or unions thereof, are found, these could also be ultimately assimilated into such a club.<ref name=ff-2000/> Given the age of the galaxy, it is likely that there are already several such clubs in existence,<ref name=ff-2000/> and they are likely to be stable and long-lived due to their large size.<ref name=ff-2000 /> However, due to humanity's low technological advancement, it is not likely that it would meet the basic requirements for membership with present-day technology.<ref name=baum-2011 />

Contact with a powerful extraterrestrial civilization has often been likened to occasions where one powerful civilization destroyed another, such as the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]] into the Americas and the subsequent destruction of the indigenous civilization and way of life.<ref name=daily-galaxy-1/> However, the applicability of such a model to contact with extraterrestrial civilizations, and that specific interpretation of the arrival of the European colonists to the Americas, has been disputed.<ref name=wired-anthropologist>{{cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/04/space-anthropology/ | title=Q&A: The Anthropology of Searching for Aliens | publisher=Wired | work=Wired Science | date=April 4, 2012 | accessdate=April 21, 2012 | author=Mann, Adam}}</ref> Even so, the sheer rift between the power of an extraterrestrial civilization and our own could serve as a demoralizing force with the potential to cause or accelerate societal collapse.<ref name=baum-2011 /> The fact that one has been "discovered" by an extraterrestrial civilization, coupled with continued contact with a "superior" civilization, could cause psychological effects which could destroy a civilization, as has happened in the past on Earth.<ref name=schetsche-2005>{{cite web | url=http://www.astrosociology.com/Library/PDF/Contributions/SETIandConsequences_ENG.pdf | title=SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and the Consequences: Futurological Reflections on the Confrontation of Mankind with an Extraterrestrial Civilization | publisher=Astrosociology.com | date=July 1 [January 7], 2005 | accessdate=May 20, 2012 | author=Schetsche, Michael}}</ref>

=== Legal ===
Contact with extraterrestrial civilizations would raise legal questions, including what rights an extraterrestrial species would have. Not being a member of ''Homo sapiens'', a representative from an extraterrestrial civilization arriving on Earth would only have the protection of animal-cruelty statutes.<ref name=freitas-1978 /> Much as various classes of human beings, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied [[human rights]], so an extraterrestrial species may be denied such rights as well.<ref name=freitas-1978/> Thus, an extraterrestrial being, lacking basic human rights, could be owned and killed in accordance with applicable law.<ref name=freitas-1978 /> If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, demarcating the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal could create a problem, due to the numerous factors which constitute intelligence.<ref name=freitas-1978 />

In addition to problems of legal personhood, problems of nationality and immigration will also arise. A member of an extraterrestrial species would not have a citizenship legally recognized on Earth, and drastic legal measures may be required in order to account for the technically illegal immigration of extraterrestrial individuals.<ref name=freitas-1978 />

If contact takes place through electromagnetic waves, issues of legal personhood pertaining to extraterrestrial species will not arise. Rather, issues relating to patent and copyright law, regarding who has rights to the information from the extraterrestrial civilization, will be the primary legal problem related to information-only contact.<ref name=freitas-1978 />

=== Scientific and technological ===
[[File:Benzopyrene_DNA_adduct_1JDG.png|thumb|left|150px|The discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence may provide us with knowledge on extraterrestrial biochemistry.]]
The scientific and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact would most likely be relatively minimal for contact through electromagnetic waves, especially in the initial stages after reception of an extraterrestrial message.<ref name=freitas-1978 /> However, as humanity deciphers more of an extraterrestrial message, and the message does indeed contain a large amount of information, humanity may gain access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human race itself which may advance its technology and science greatly.<ref name=freitas-1978/> A possible harmful effect of this could be a demoralization of research scientists, who know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.<ref name=freitas-1978 />

In addition to civilizations acting in good faith, extraterrestrial civilizations with malicious intent may send information to humanity which would lead to the destruction of its civilization,<ref name=freitas-1978 /> such as powerful computer viruses, or information on how to make extremely potent weapons which humans are not yet prepared to use responsibly.<ref name=baum-2011 /> While the motives for such an action are unknown, it would require minimal energy usage on the part of the contactor and, if it had a high success rate, would be an effective weapon.<ref name=freitas-1978 />

Extraterrestrial technology may have profound impacts on the nature of human culture and civilization. Just as the invention of the television provided a new outlet for the rapid dissemination of information by a wide variety of political, religious, and social groups, and how the earlier printing press spread the Bible to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology may change humanity in ways not immediately apparent.<ref name=harrison-2002>{{cite book | title=After Contact: The Human Response To Extraterrestrial Life | publisher=Basic Books | author=Harrison, Albert A. | year=2002 | isbn=9780738208466 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u7BnvJMbPrsC}}</ref> In addition, knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies may further expand the already-growing gap between scientific and cultural advancement, leading to mass societal shock and an inability of a civilization to compensate for negative effects of technology, as speculated by Harrison (2002).<ref name=harrison-2002 /> As an example, the improvements in agricultural technology of the past century as a part of the [[Industrial Revolution]] had rendered the services of thousands of farm laborers useless, before society had the ability to retrain these workers for jobs still present in the new society.<ref name=harrison-2002 /> It is possible that contact with an extraterrestrial civilization thousands of times more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything which has been experienced by humanity before.<ref name=harrison-2002 />

The discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence would have various impacts on biology and [[astrobiology]]. Through the discovery of extraterrestrial life in any form, intelligent or non-intelligent, humanity could gain a greater insight into the nature of life on the Earth and improve the conception of how the tree of life is organized.<ref name=mckay-2011>{{cite doi|10.1098/rsta.2010.0247}}</ref> Human biologists may also learn about extraterrestrial [[hypothetical types of biochemistry|biochemistry]] and observe how they differ from those found on Earth.<ref name=mckay-2011/> This knowledge could, in turn, allow human civilization to know about which aspects of life are common throughout the Universe, and which aspects of life are common on Earth out of coincidence.<ref name=mckay-2011/>{{-}}

=== Ecological ===
[[File:Kudzu field horz1.JPG|right|thumb|[[Kudzu]] (''Pueraria lobata''), a vine native to Japan, was introduced to the U.S. in the late 1870s. Here, it has invaded a field in [[Mississippi]], covering everything in its path. It is spreading through the southeastern U.S. at a rate of {{convert|150000|acre|abbr=on}} annually.]]

An extraterrestrial civilization may inadvertently bring with it pathogens or invasive species to Earth, which the extraterrestrial biosphere is immune to being harmed by.<ref name=baum-2011 /> Such pathogens could decimate the human population, which has no immunity to them.<ref name=baum-2011 /> Rather than directly harming humans, a pathogen may use terrestrial livestock or plants as its hosts, causing indirect harm to the human species.<ref name=baum-2011 /> Invasive species brought by extraterrestrial civilizations, while not strictly diseases, could also cause great ecological harm through their novelty and the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against these species.<ref name=baum-2011 /> 

On the other hand, pathogens and invasive species of extraterrestrial extraction may be so different in biology to terrestrial organisms that they might not cause any adverse effects.<ref name=baum-2011 />  Furthermore, pathogens and parasites on Earth are generally suited to only a small and exclusive set of environments,<ref name=loker-2005>{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0010038|pmc=PMC1291355|title=Can Specialized Pathogens Colonize Distantly Related Hosts? Schistosome Evolution as a Case Study|year=2005|last1=Brant|first1=Sara V.|last2=Loker|first2=Eric S.|journal=PLoS Pathogens|volume=1|issue=3|pages=28<U+2013>31}}</ref> which extraterrestrial pathogens would not have had any experience adapting to.

If an extraterrestrial species gained sufficient knowledge of terrestrial biology and weaknesses in the immune systems of terrestrial biota, and possessed malicious intent in its interactions with humanity, it may be able to create biological weapons with the greatest possible adverse effect.<ref name=baum-2011 /> Additionally, a civilization without malicious intent may, when performing unrelated actions, inadvertently cause harm to humanity by not accounting for its existence when performing said actions.<ref name=baum-2011 />

Even if contact with an extraterrestrial civilization takes place by means of electromagnetic radiation only, the civilization, acting in good or in bad faith, may send humanity biological information with which humans themselves create lethal biological weapons.<ref name=baum-2011 />{{-}}
