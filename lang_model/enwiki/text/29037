The '''North Shore''' of [[Long Island]] is the area along Long Island's northern coast, bordering [[Long Island Sound]]. Traditionally, the region has been the most affluent on Long Island and among the most affluent in the [[New York metropolitan area]], which has earned it the [[nickname]] "the Gold Coast." Though some consider the North Shore to include parts of [[Queens]], particularly the quasi-[[suburb|suburban]] northeastern neighborhoods such as [[Douglaston, Queens|Douglaston]], the term is generally used to refer to the Long Island coastline in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]]. It is often used as a generic name for the entire northern half of Long Island rather than just the area immediately next to the coastline.

The North Shore has a long-held reputation of elegance and gentility. Many stately old homes can be found there, and an "old money" atmosphere pervades. In [[popular culture]], it is perhaps best known as the setting of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s 1925 [[novel]] ''[[The Great Gatsby]],'' which centered on the area's wealth and the aspiration of the title character to be accepted as a part of its society. The novel's "West Egg" and "East Egg" were fictionalized versions of the real North Shore villages of [[Kings Point, New York|Kings Point]] and [[Sands Point, New York|Sands Point]]. The distinctive [[upper class]] speech pattern known as [[Locust Valley Lockjaw]] takes its name from the North Shore's [[Locust Valley, New York|Locust Valley]] area.

Despite its waterfront location, relatively few [[beach]]es can be found on the North Shore. Most of Long Island's beaches are located to the south, on the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

Though the western stretch of the North Shore is considered by most locals to be the more fashionable of Long Island's coasts, once the island splits into two forks at its east end, the North Shore becomes largely [[rural]]. This area is known as the [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York|North Fork]], and it contrasts starkly with the [[South Fork, Suffolk County, New York|South Fork]]'s tony [[Hamptons]]. In the past 25 years, the North Fork has reinvented itself as a major center for the production of [[wine]].
