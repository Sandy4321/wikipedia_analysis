[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Adrian Lindley Trevor Cole''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (19&nbsp;June 1895 &ndash; 14&nbsp;February 1966) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Joining the [[Australian Military Forces|army]] at the outbreak of [[World War I]], Cole transferred to the Australian Flying Corps in 1916 and flew with [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Squadron]] in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]] and [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Squadron]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. He became an [[Flying ace|ace]], credited with victories over ten enemy aircraft, and earned the [[Military Cross]] and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. In 1921, he was a founding member of the RAAF. 

"King" Cole had risen to the position of Air Member for Supply by 1933 and gained promotion to [[Group Captain]] in 1935. The following year he was appointed the first Commanding Officer of [[RAAF Base Richmond|Headquarters RAAF Station Richmond]]. During [[World War II]], Cole led North-Western Area in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and held a series of overseas posts in North Africa, England, Northern Ireland, and Ceylon. As Forward Air Controller during the [[Dieppe Raid]] in 1942, he was wounded in action and awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]]. Cole served on corporate [[boards of directors]] following his retirement from the RAAF in 1946. He died in 1966 at the age of seventy.

For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. With another officer he attacked and disorganised six enemy machines that were about to attack our cavalry with bombs.

The day after the action that earned him the Military Cross, Cole was flying a [[Martinsyde G.100|Martinsyde G.100 "Elephant"]] over Tel el Sheria when he was hit by ground fire and forced to crash land behind enemy lines; after setting his aircraft alight he was picked up and rescued by Captain [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]]. On 26&nbsp;June, following an eight-plane raid on Turkish Fourth Army headquarters in [[Jerusalem]], Cole and another pilot suffered engine seizures while undertaking a similar rescue of a downed comrade; all three airmen were forced to walk through [[no man's land]] before being picked up by an [[Australian Light Horse]] patrol.<ref>Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/05.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp.63,66&ndash;67]</ref>

On 7th October this officer carried out a most successful flying raid on enemy railway lines and stations. The success of the attack was largely owing to his cool and determined leadership, and our freedom from casualties was mainly due to the methodical manner in which he collected and reorganised the machines after the raid. He himself displayed marked initiative and courage in attacking troops and other objectives. Since May Capt. Cole has destroyed four hostile machines.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=31170|startpage=2037|date=7 February 1919|accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref>}}

Investigating the matter, Jones was unable to establish whether or not Cole had been drunk but was satisfied that he had not behaved appropriately, and issued him a warning without charging or otherwise disciplining him.<ref name="Helson p.187">Helson, ''10 Years at the Top'', pp.187&ndash;190</ref> Under pressure from the government, Jones dismissed Cole from the position of AMP and posted him to Ceylon in January 1945 as RAAF Liaison Officer to [[South East Asia Command]].<ref name="Dennis"/><ref name="Helson p.187"/> Cole served in this role until the end of the war, taking part in negotiations for the Japanese capitulation and acting as Australia's senior representative at the formal surrender ceremony in [[Singapore]] on 12&nbsp;September 1945.<ref name="ADB"/>

Cole was summarily retired from the RAAF in 1946, along with a number of other senior commanders and veterans of World War&nbsp;I, primarily to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers.
