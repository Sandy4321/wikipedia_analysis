'''Bartholomew JoJo''' '''"Bart"''' '''Simpson''' is a fictional main character in the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and part of the [[Simpson family|eponymous family]]. He is voiced by actress [[Nancy Cartwright]] and first appeared on television in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]" on April 19, 1987. Bart was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. While the rest of the characters were named after Groening's family members, Bart's name was an anagram of the word ''brat''. After appearing on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' for three years, the Simpson family received their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted December 17, 1989.

At ten years old, Bart is the eldest child and only son of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], and the brother of [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. Bart's most prominent character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness and disrespect for authority. He has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''; including [[The Simpsons video games|video games]], ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride]], commercials, and [[List of The Simpsons comics|comic books]]; and inspired an entire line of merchandise.

In casting, Nancy Cartwright originally planned to audition for the role of Lisa, while [[Yeardley Smith]] tried out for Bart. Smith's voice was too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. Cartwright found that Lisa was not interesting at the time, so instead auditioned for Bart, which she thought was a better role. [[#Hallmarks|Hallmarks]] of the character include his [[The Simpsons opening sequence#Chalkboard gag|chalkboard gag]]s in the opening sequence; his prank calls to [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] the bartender; and his catchphrases "Eat my shorts", "<U+00A1>Ay, caramba!", and "Don't have a cow, man!"

During the first two seasons of ''The Simpsons'' (1989<U+2013>1991), Bart was the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]] and "Bartmania" ensued. Bart Simpson T-shirts sporting various slogans and catchphrases became popular, selling at a rate of a million per day at their peak. The song "[[Do the Bartman]]" became a number one charting single and the seventh best-selling song of 1991 in the United Kingdom. Bart's rebellious attitude and pride at underachieving caused many parents and educators to cast him as a bad role model for children. A T-shirt reading "I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?" was banned in several public schools. Around the [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]], the series started to focus more on the family as a group, although Bart remains one of the most prominent characters on the series. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named Bart one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most important people of the 20th century]], and he was named "entertainer of the year" in 1990 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Nancy Cartwright has won several awards for voicing Bart, including a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in 1992 and an [[Annie Award]] in 1995. In 2000, Bart, along with the rest of his family, was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
''The Simpsons'' uses a [[floating timeline]] in which the characters do not age, and as such the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Bart's year of birth was stated in "[[I Married Marge]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 3)|season three]], 1991) as being in the early 1980s.<ref name=IMarriedMarge>{{cite episode |title=I Married Marge|episodelink=I Married Marge|series=The Simpsons|credits=[[Jeff Martin (writer)|Martin, Jeff]]; [[Jeffrey Lynch|Lynch, Jeffrey]]|network=Fox |airdate=1991-12-26 |season=03 |number=12}}</ref> He lived with his parents in the Lower East of Springfield until the Simpsons bought [[742 Evergreen Terrace|their first house]]. When Lisa was born, Bart was at first jealous of the attention she received, but he soon warmed to her when he discovered that "Bart" was her first word.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa's First Word|episodelink=Lisa's First Word|series=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; [[Mark Kirkland|Kirkland, Mark]]|network=Fox |airdate=1992-12-03 |season=04|number=10}}</ref> Bart's first day of school was in the early 1990s. His initial enthusiasm was crushed by an uncaring teacher and Marge became worried that something was truly wrong with him. One day during recess, Bart met [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] and started entertaining him and other students with various gestures and rude words. [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]] told him "you've just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow for the rest of your life! Now, what do you say?" In his moment of truth, Bart responded, "eat my shorts".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa's Sax|episodelink=Lisa's Sax|series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Dominic Polcino|Polcino, Dominic]]|network=Fox |airdate=1997-10-19 |season=09|number=03}}</ref> The episode "[[That 90's Show]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 19)|season nineteen]], 2008) contradicted much of the backstory's time frame; for example, it was revealed that Homer and Marge were childless in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite episode |title=That 90's Show|episodelink=That 90's Show |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Matt Selman|Selman, Matt]]; Kirkland, Mark|network=Fox |airdate=2008-01-27 |season=19|number=11}}</ref>

Bart's hobbies include [[skateboard]]ing, watching television (especially ''The [[Krusty the Clown]] Show'' which includes ''[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show]]''), reading comic books (especially [[List of fictional characters within The Simpsons#Radioactive Man|Radioactive Man]]), playing video games and generally causing mischief.<ref>[[#Turner|Turner]], p. 122</ref> For the duration of the series, Bart has attended [[Springfield Elementary School]] and has been in [[Edna Krabappel]]'s fourth grade class. While he is too young to hold a full-time job, he has had occasional part time jobs. He works as a [[bartender]] at [[Fat Tony]]'s social club in "[[Bart the Murderer]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 3)|season three]], 1991);<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bart the Murderer|episodelink=Bart the Murderer|series=The Simpsons |credits=[[John Swartzwelder|Swartzwelder, John]]; [[Rich Moore|Moore, Rich]]|network=Fox |airdate=1991-10-10 |season=03|number=04}}</ref> as [[Krusty the Clown]]'s assistant in "[[Bart Gets Famous]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 5)|season five]], 1994);<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bart Gets Famous|episodelink=Bart Gets Famous|series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; [[Susie Dietter|Dietter, Susie]]|network=Fox |airdate=1994-02-03 |season=05|number=12}}</ref> as a doorman in Springfield's [[burlesque house]], the Maison Derri<U+00E8>re in "[[Bart After Dark]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 8)|season eight]], 1996);<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bart After Dark|episodelink=Bart After Dark|series=The Simpsons |credits=Appel, Richard; [[Josh Weinstein|Weinstein, Josh]]|network=Fox |airdate=1996-11-04 |season=08|number=05}}</ref> and briefly owns his own factory in "[[Homer's Enemy]]".

===Creation===
[[Image:Matt Groening by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Matt Groening created Bart while waiting in James L. Brooks' office.|alt=A man in glasses and a plaid shirt sits in front of a microphone.]]
[[Matt Groening]] first conceived of Bart and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986, while waiting in the lobby of producer [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', and had intended to present an adaptation of his ''Life in Hell'' comic strip. When he realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction.<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video|people=BBC|date=2000|title='The Simpsons': America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/|format=DVD|location=UK|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> He hurriedly sketched out his version of a [[dysfunctional family]], naming the characters after members of his own family.

===Design===
[[Image:Bart - Good Night.png|right|200px|thumb|Bart in his first televised appearance in [[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|"Good Night"]].]]
The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in [[silhouette]].<ref>Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for "[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/> Bart's original design, which appeared in the first shorts, had spikier hair, and the spikes were of different lengths. The number was later limited to nine spikes, all of the same size.<ref>[[David Silverman|Silverman, David]]; [[Wes Archer|Archer, Wes]]. (2004). Illustrated commentary for "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> At the time Groening was primarily drawing in black and "not thinking that [Bart] would eventually be drawn in color" gave him spikes which appear to be an extension of his head.<ref>[[Mike B. Anderson|Anderson, Mike B.]]; Groening, Matt; [[Pete Michels|Michels, Pete]]; [[Yeardley Smith|Smith, Yeardley]]. (2006). "A Bit From the Animators", Illustrated Commentary for "[[All Singing, All Dancing]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The features of Bart's character design are generally not used in other characters; for example, no other characters in current episodes have Bart's spiky hairline, although several background characters in the first few seasons shared the trait.<ref>Groening, Matt; Reiss, Mike; Kirkland, Mark. (2002). Commentary for "[[Principal Charming]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

The basic rectangular shape of Bart's head is described by director [[Mark Kirkland]] as a coffee can. Homer's head is also rectangular (with a dome on top), while spheres are used for Marge, Lisa, and Maggie.<ref>Archer, Wes; Groening, Matt; Kirkland, Mark. (2005). "A Bit From the Animators", Illustrated Commentary for "[[Summer of 4 Ft. 2]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Different animators have different methods of drawing Bart. Former director [[Jeffrey Lynch]] starts off with a box, then adds the eyes, then the mouth, then the hair spikes, ear, and then the rest of the body. Matt Groening normally starts with the eyes, then the nose, and the rest of the outline of Bart's head. Many of the animators have trouble drawing Bart's spikes evenly; one trick they use is to draw one on the right, one on the left, one in the middle, then continue to add one in the middle of the blank space until there are nine. Originally, whenever Bart was to be drawn from an angle looking down so the top of his head was seen, Groening wanted there to be spikes along the outline of his head, and in the middle as well. Instead, [[Wes Archer]] and [[David Silverman]] drew him so that there was an outline of the spikes, then just a smooth patch in the middle because "it worked graphically."<ref>Groening, Matt; Lynch, Jeffrey; Reardon, Jim; Silverman, David.

In the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]] (1995) episode "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]", Bart (along with Homer) was computer animated into a [[3D computer graphics|three dimensional]] character for the first time for the "Homer<sup>3</sup>" segment of the episode. The computer animation directors was provided by [[Pacific Data Images]].<ref name="3D" /> While designing the 3D model of the character, the animators did not know how they would show Bart's hair. They realized that there were vinyl Bart dolls in production and purchased one to use as a model.<ref name="3D">Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Johnson, Tim; Silverman, David; Mirkin, David; Cohen, David X.

===Voice===

[[Yeardley Smith]] had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, but casting director [[Bonita Pietila]] believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled, "I always sounded too much like a girl. I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'"<ref name=Smith/> Smith was given the role of Lisa instead.<ref>{{cite news|title=She who laughs last|date=2007-12-08|accessdate=2008-02-09|page=8E|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]|last =Miranda | first= Charles}}</ref> On March 13, 1987, Nancy Cartwright went in to audition for the role of Lisa. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the "middle child" and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, who was described as "devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever".<ref>[[#Cartwright|Cartwright]], pp. 35<U+2013>40</ref> Matt Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot.<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1017238.stm|title=Bart's voice tells all|accessdate=2007-05-16|date=2000-11-10|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> Cartwright is the only one of the six main ''Simpsons'' cast members who had been professionally trained in voice acting prior to working on the show.<ref>[[#Turner|Turner]], p. 21</ref>

But Bart is easy to do. I can just slip into that without difficulty."<ref name="My Boy" /> She traditionally does five or six readings of every line in order to give the producers more to work with.<ref name="BBC News" /> In [[flashforward]] episodes, Cartwright still provides the voice of Bart.

Despite Bart's fame, Cartwright is rarely recognized in public. On occasions when she is recognized on the street and asked to perform Bart's voice in front of children, Cartwright will refuse because it "freaks [them] out".<ref name="My Boy" /> During the first season of ''The Simpsons'', the Fox Network did not allow Cartwright to give interviews because they did not want to publicize that Bart was voiced by a woman.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bart Simpson's secret: he's a woman|author=Bark, Ed|accessdate=2008-10-28|date=1990-07-15|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]}}</ref>

===Hallmarks===
In the [[The Simpsons opening sequence|opening sequence]] of many ''Simpsons'' episodes, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart can be seen writing a message on the chalkboard. This message, which changes from episode to episode, has become known as the "chalkboard gag".<ref name=p71>[[#Turner|Turner]], p. 71</ref> Chalkboard messages may involve political humor such as "The First Amendment does not cover burping",<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lemon of Troy|episodelink=Lemon of Troy|series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Brent Forrester|Forrester, Brent]]; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox |airdate=1995-05-14|season=06|number=24}}</ref> [[popular culture|pop culture]] references such as "[[The Sixth Sense|I can't see dead people]]",<ref>{{cite episode |title=Take My Wife, Sleaze|episodelink=Take My Wife, Sleaze|series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; [[Neil Affleck|Affleck, Neil]]|network=Fox |airdate=1999-11-28|season=11|number=08}}</ref> and [[meta-reference]]s such as "I am not a 32 year old woman" and "Nobody reads these anymore".<ref name=p71/> The animators are able to produce the chalkboard gags quickly and in some cases have changed them to fit current events. For example, the chalkboard gag for "[[Homer the Heretic]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]], 1992) read, "I will not defame New Orleans." The gag had been written as an apology to the city for a controversial song in [[A Streetcar Named Marge|the previous week's episode]], which called the city a "home of pirates, drunks and whores".<ref name="Martin">Martin, Jeff (2004).

One of Bart's early [[hallmark]]s were his prank calls to [[Moe's Tavern]] owner [[Moe Szyslak]] in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a [[gag name]]. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but rapidly realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were based on a series of prank calls known as the [[Tube Bar prank calls|Tube Bar recordings]]. Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner [[Louis "Red" Deutsch]], whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent side.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hudsonreporter.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15354520&BRD=1291&PAG=461&dept_id=523586&rfi=6|title=Joke on 'Simpsons' started in JC|accessdate=2008-10-30|date=2005-08-10|publisher=''[[Hudson Reporter]]''|work=[[Jersey City Reporter]]|author=Kaulessar, Ricardo}}</ref> The prank calls debuted in "[[Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)|Homer's Odyssey]]", ([[The Simpsons (season 1)|season one]], 1990) the third episode to air, but were included in "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|Some Enchanted Evening]]", the first episode of the series that was produced.<ref name="Some">[[James L.
