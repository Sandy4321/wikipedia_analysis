'''Boeing Creek''' is a [[stream]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington]], located in the city of [[Shoreline, Washington|Shoreline]], just north of [[Seattle]]. It is about {{convert|1.6|mi|km}} long and empties into [[Puget Sound]].<ref name=ellison/> The creek is heavily modified along its course, and in many places have been diverted into [[culvert]]s. The watershed of Boeing Creek is about {{convert|11.2|mi2|km2}} in size, with two main tributaries aside from the [[Mainstem (hydrology)|mainstem]]. The creek takes its name from [[William Boeing]], who built a mansion along the creek in 1913. Despite the river modifications and stormwater pollution, the creek supports a variety of [[riparian]] habitats, native animals and fishes.

==Course==
Boeing Creek's original headwaters have been placed into underground pipes. The creek's main stem emerges from storm drain [[culvert]]s at the intersection of Greenwood Ave and Carlyle Hall Road, which is considered its source, {{coord|47.7506531|-122.3576292 |type:river_source:gnis-1503466_region:US-WA|name=Boeing Creek source}}.<ref name="gnis">{{cite gnis|id=1503466|name=Boeing Creek|accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref> The creek flows along the [[Shoreline Community College]] campus, through Boeing Creek Park (the northern part of Shoreview Park). At the west end of the park the creek empties into Hidden Lake, {{coord|47.7514864|-122.3712408}}.<ref name="gnis-hl">{{cite gnis|id=1513933|name=Hidden Lake|accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref> Boeing Creek exits Hidden Lake through a culvert under Innis Arden Way and flows west through a ravine and under [[BNSF Railway|BNSF's]] railroad tracks before emptying into Puget Sound.<ref name=ellison>{{cite web

During high flow events, additional water from pipes beneath 175th Street enters Boeing Creek Park, flowing into a stormwater [[detention basin]], then into the northern fork of Boeing Creek.<ref name ="SUN"/>

===Discharge===
[[King County, Washington|King County]] operated six [[stream gage]]s on Boeing Creek during the 1990s. Gage 04j, called "Boeing Creek off Beach DR", was the furthest downstream at approximately [[river mile]] 0.4. It operated from August 7, 1991 to March 19, 1993. The maximum daily discharge measured was 16.86 cfs. The minimum daily discharge was 1.06. The mean discharge over the life of the gage was 2.7 cfs.<ref name="gage-04j">{{cite web |

==Watershed==
According to Rich Ellison, Boeing Creek's [[Drainage basin|watershed]] is {{convert|11.74|sqmi|km2}} large and includes {{convert|3.4|mi|km}} of Puget Sound shoreline.<ref name=ellison/> The watershed is almost entirely within the city of Shoreline, reaching north nearly to the [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish County]] line. Its southern extent reaches slightly into the city of [[Seattle]].<ref name=ellison/> Boeing Creek's watershed borders, to the west, the watersheds of McAleer Creek, [[Thornton Creek]], and Lyons Creek.<ref name=ellison/> King County maps Boeing Creek's watershed slightly differently. According to King County the watershed is completely contained within the City of Shoreline.<ref>{{cite web

==History==
In 1913 [[William Boeing]], founder of the [[Boeing]] company, had a mansion built in The Highlands neighborhood, along Boeing Creek. He lived by himself until 1921, when he married and started a family.<ref name ="boeinghistorylink">{{cite web

He used the land primarily as a hunting retreat and had a small dam made, creating Hidden Lake which he used as a private fishing pond.<ref name="SUN"/> In the 1930s Boeing [[plat]]ted and [[Logging|logged]] 400 acres north of Boeing Creek and sold the land to developers. The Innis Arden neighborhood began to be developed on this land after World War II. The land that today is Boeing Creek Park was partially logged, leaving a number of large mature conifers, some over {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} tall. It is unclear why the area was only partially logged. The steep slopes may have made it too costly to fully log.<ref name="SUN"/>

Much of Boeing Creek's upper course, to Hidden Lake, is within Boeing Creek Park, the northern part of Shoreview Park. Run by the City of Shoreline, these parks together span 88 acres.<ref>{{cite web

In the mid-1970s land was cleared south of Hidden Lake for the construction of Shoreview High School. Funding failed and the school was never built. The cleared and terraced site has become infested with invasive species such as [[Cytisus scoparius|Scotch broom]] and [[Rubus armeniacus|Himalayan blackberry]]. In 1977 King County purchased the land from the Shoreline School District and established Shoreview Park. The City of Shoreline assumed ownership of Shoreview Park and adjoining Boeing Creek Park in 1997. Trails in these parks allow access to the middle portion of Boeing Creek. A few trails are official and maintained, including one that runs along the creek to Hidden Lake. There are a large number of "social trails" as well, which often climb steep, unstable slopes, increasing erosion and overall stream degradation.<ref name="SUN"/> The lower portion of the creek, below Hidden Lake, is not accessible to the public.

==Geology==
The geology of the Boeing Creek's watershed is dominated by [[sand]]s, [[gravel]]s, and [[silt]]s created during the [[last glacial period]].<ref name="SUN"/> Materials present include subglacial [[till]]s made up of silt, sand, and gravel particles; advance [[Sandur|outwash]] deposits, made up of well-sorted sands and gravels; and transitional beds, made up of compacted [[clay]], silt, and sometimes sand.<ref name="SUN"/>

==Natural history==
===Fish===
[[Salmonidae|Salmonid]] use that has been documented in Boeing Creek include [[chinook salmon]] (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), [[chum salmon]] (Oncorhynchus keta), [[coho salmon]] (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and sea run [[cutthroat trout]] (Oncorhynchus clarki).<ref name=ellison/> A study done in 1994 found juvenile coho salmon in the lower portion of Boeing Creek, below the Seattle Golf Course Dam.<ref name="kc-coho">{{cite web

Fish populations are hindered by two storm water detention systems: the M-1 Dam (or "Boeing Creek Detention Facility"), an in-stream retention device on the main fork, and the Retention-Detention Ponds, an off-channel system in Boeing Creek Park.<ref name=ellison/> Three other structures influence stream ecology: Hidden Lake and its associated dam; an artificial waterfall, about ten feet high, constructed from concrete, just downstream from Innis Arden Way; and the "Seattle Country Club Golf Course Dam", a metal dam and pump station about 200 meters downstream of Innis Arden Way, which forms of reservoir that supplies the Seattle Country Club golf course with irrigation water. None of the dams provide [[Fish ladder|fish passage]] and therefore present a total barrier, limiting stream use by [[Fish migration|anadromous]] species to the lower third of the creek.<ref name=ellison/>

===Vegetation===
The [[Riparian zone|riparian]] forest along Boeing Creek in Boeing Creek Park is an intact native ecosystem, mostly free of invasive species. There are a number of mature conifers that escaped being logged, including {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} tall [[Douglas-fir]] and [[Western White Pine]] trees.<ref name="SUN"/> [[Rubus spectabilis|Salmonberry]] shrubs are common along the creek. In some areas [[invasive species]] such as [[Cytisus scoparius|Scotch broom]], [[Rubus armeniacus|Himalayan blackberry]], [[Hedera helix|English ivy]], and [[Geranium robertianum|Herb Robert]] are present. The [[Indigenous (ecology)|native species]] of [[Polystichum munitum|Sword fern]] and [[Stinging nettle]] are common.<ref name="SUN"/>

==Modifications==
Early modifications of Boeing Creek include the logging of the creek's watershed, the creation of Hidden Lake, and the construction of the Seattle Country Club Golf Course Dam. The creek's mouth was crossed by railway tracks, today owned by BNSF, running along the edge of Puget Sound.

In the 1960s a [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] mall complex was built at [[Washington State Route 99|Aurora Avenue]] and 160th Street, covering Boeing Creek's [[wetland]] [[Source (river or stream)|headwaters]].<ref name=ellison/> This and other urban development placed about {{convert|2|mi|km}} of what had been upper Boeing Creek into a patchwork of pipes, most of which are on private property. Within this area there is one {{convert|400|ft|m|adj=on}} segment that flows free from pipes, located in Darnell Park. However a lack of detention facilities and an undersized pipe causes flooding in the vicinity of Darnell Park and contributes to erosive flows downstream. The City of Shoreline is planning on improving the drainage and reducing downstream erosion by building a detention basin and replacing the pipe.<ref>{{cite web

The creek's watershed was heavily [[Urbanization|urbanized]] after [[World War II]], altering the [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] patterns. Increased runoff into Boeing Creek during rainy weather has caused more intense [[erosion]] and [[sediment transport]], leading to the build-up of [[sediment]] in Hidden Lake. In the 1970s heavy rains flushed enough sediment down the creek to completely fill Hidden Lake, which became a meadow. Subsequently, King County Surface Water Division began efforts to control [[stormwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]] in Boeing Creek's watershed. In 1996 [[dredging]] work restored Hidden Lake. On January 1, 1997, a winter storm created a large [[sinkhole]] which ruptured sewer lines on 175th Street, resulting in the Hidden Lake being filled with sediment again. The lake was dredged and restored again.<ref name="SUN"/> The city of Shoreline budgets money for dredging Hidden Lake as needed and continues to seek a long-term solution to the problems of increased storm surge runoff, erosion, and sedimentation.<ref>{{cite web

King County built a stormwater control system in Boeing Creek Park. A large [[detention basin]] stores water during storms, reducing the creek's flood risk. The detention basin is augmented by an underground storage pipe designed to temporarily store up to 500,000 gallons of wastewater during large storms. This storage pipe is located under the detention basin in Boeing Creek Park. The pipe is {{convert|12|ft|m}} in diameter and about {{convert|640|ft|m}} long. Completed in 2007 by King County Public Works, the pipe's purpose is to help keep wastewater within the sewer system and reduce overflows into Puget Sound. The pipe conveys wastewater to the Hidden Lake Pump Station.<ref>{{cite web
